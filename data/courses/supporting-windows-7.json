          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:07.584\n[SOUND]\nIn this segment,\n\n2\n00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:10.610\nwe're gonna introduce you to a new\nshow that we have lined up for you.\n\n3\n00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.720\nIt is supporting Windows 7.\n\n4\n00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.460\nNow this doesn't line up\nwith any exam per se, but\n\n5\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.350\nthe Windows 7 is still a viable option\nout there for you in the IT world.\n\n6\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.780\nSo, you do need to be\nable to support that guy.\n\n7\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.330\nSo, Ronnie, you have done a great job of\n\n8\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.210\ncoming up with a list of things that\nwe're gonna go over in this show.\n\n9\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.100\nSo, I want you to help us out and\n\n10\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.760\nshow these good people\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n11\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.394\n>> All right, we've got to remember that\neven though we are now at least at Windows\n\n12\n00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:38.539\n10, the very fact is most enterprises,\nand even most home users,\n\n13\n00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.360\nare probably still running Windows 7,\nand that accounts for\n\n14\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.110\nabout 65% of the world's\nPCs that are out there.\n\n15\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.960\nAnd that means we as technicians, whether\nor no you're actually working in the large\n\n16\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.310\nenterprise, or whether we're working\nin a small home environment,\n\n17\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.388\nthat we need to be able to have\nthose technical skills ready to go.\n\n18\n00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:56.460\nSo, if you actually did\ncome in doing Windows 8 and\n\n19\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.790\nnow we're actually supporting Windows 10.\n\n20\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.890\nThose are great things\nto actually focus in on.\n\n21\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.690\nBut remember that you have\na lot of the world marketplace\n\n22\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.165\nthat's still on Windows 7.\n\n23\n00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:06.660\nAnd what we wanted to do is we\nwanted to produce a show that would\n\n24\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.570\nhelp us to actually be able to say, look,\nhere's what a technician needs to know.\n\n25\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.610\nSo, this is more about\nthe troubleshooting aspects of somebody,\n\n26\n00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.070\nactually in the field,\nneeding to support Windows 7.\n\n27\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.150\nAnd what we did is we broke up our content\ninto three separate sections here.\n\n28\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.920\nWe talked about installation and\ndeployment.\n\n29\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.070\nWe'll also go over managing and\nmaintaining.\n\n30\n00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.430\nAnd then lastly, we talk about the idea of\noperational issues that we may encounter\n\n31\n00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.700\nas we are supporting Windows 7 as\nan enterprise level technician.\n\n32\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.390\nLet's go ahead and take a look at some\nof these topics that we'll be covering\n\n33\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420\nin this show coming up here.\n\n34\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.390\nSo underneath installation and\ndeployment, we will be talking about\n\n35\n00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.650\nbasic installation issues that\nwe do end up encountering.\n\n36\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.010\nAnd this is when we actually\njust put in the disc and\n\n37\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.620\nsomething ends up happening and\nit's not what we expect.\n\n38\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.180\nWe talk about how to\ntroubleshoot that as well.\n\n39\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.980\nWe'll also take a look briefly\nat image creation issues too.\n\n40\n00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.170\nThis ends up happening a lot\nof times when we are actually\n\n41\n00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.970\ntrying to create an image for our\ndeployment and it doesn't go exactly well.\n\n42\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.830\nWhat are some of the key points\nthat we need to take a look at\n\n43\n00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.560\nto make sure that we can actually\nthe image the way that we want to?\n\n44\n00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.230\nWe even go into a little about\ncreating an answer file as well.\n\n45\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.210\nAnd then lastly,\nworking with their deployment server.\n\n46\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.900\nWhat are some of the encounters\nwe can have there as well?\n\n47\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.910\nAnd those are some of the different\ntechniques that we talk about underneath\n\n48\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.070\ninstallation and deployment.\n\n49\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.270\nWhen we move into the managing and\nmaintaining area, we now actually talk\n\n50\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.920\nabout some of the basic concepts that we\nas technicians need to be familiar with.\n\n51\n00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.870\nIf you're working in an active\ndirectory environment,\n\n52\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.170\nthe idea of working with policies\nare actually clear for what we need to do.\n\n53\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.600\nA lot of times that's gonna\nbe handled a level above\n\n54\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.090\nwhat we're actually doing\nas a support technician.\n\n55\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.340\nBut we do need to understand how that\nactually effects the operating system.\n\n56\n00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.320\nAnd so, we also deal with it\nin terms of a local policy\n\n57\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.370\nas well as the active\ndirectory group policy too.\n\n58\n00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.910\nWe then take a look at\nmonitoring Windows 7.\n\n59\n00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.190\nAnd normally, when we start\nto take a look at monitoring,\n\n60\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.000\nwe're really trying to take a look at\nthe performance issues that end up\n\n61\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.760\nworking inside of Windows 7\nagainst us a lot of times.\n\n62\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.970\nAnd we as technicians need to know that\nthe tools that are actually built in there\n\n63\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.760\nwill help us to effectively be\nable to troubleshoot some of\n\n64\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.110\nthose performance issues, isolate what\nthe issue may be, and even try and\n\n65\n00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.240\nsolve and correct those as well.\n\n66\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.370\nOf course, that means that we also\nneed to deal with security issues.\n\n67\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.820\nAnd these types of security\nissues always pop up,\n\n68\n00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.070\nespecially with the idea of the browser.\n\n69\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.270\nWindows 7, by default,\nactually just has Windows, or\n\n70\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.200\nInternet Explorer 8 actually\nas their default browser.\n\n71\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.100\nBut you can update that and\nthat solves a lot of the issues.\n\n72\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.200\nBut what are some of the other things\nthat we need to be familiar with?\n\n73\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.720\nAnd especially when we actually\ngo to the different websites and\n\n74\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.800\nthey don't work the same way that we a,\nare expecting them to.\n\n75\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.680\nWe need to think about that as\nwell as malicious software.\n\n76\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.440\nAnd of course, updating some of\nthe policies involved in that as well.\n\n77\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.060\nAnd then, or course,\n\n78\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.630\nin security, we also talk about file\nencryption as well as drive encryption.\n\n79\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.592\nAnd we talk about that\na little bit more in-depth,\n\n80\n00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:56.140\nso that you understand that these\nare issues that also come up.\n\n81\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.527\nAnd we're really taking a look at\nall of this from the troubleshooting\n\n82\n00:03:58.527 --> 00:03:59.650\nstandpoint, right?\n\n83\n00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.560\nNot that you know how to\nimplement everything,\n\n84\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.460\nbecause more than likely you already do.\n\n85\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.200\nBut what are some of the things\nthat you may end up encountering\n\n86\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.120\nthat you're not sure of.\n\n87\n00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.655\nAnd so, we actually do spend the time\nin focusing in on that as well.\n\n88\n00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:14.970\nWe also of course, take a look at just\nbasic networking connectivity issues that\n\n89\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.150\nwe have to deal with, and name resolution,\nas well as the command line utilities that\n\n90\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.540\nwe end up using a lot of times\nthat we're troubleshooting.\n\n91\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.145\nAnd then of course, accessing things like\nfiles and other resources in our network.\n\n92\n00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:31.120\nLastly, we also wanted\nto address of course,\n\n93\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.470\noperational issues that tend to come and\nplague us as people supporting Windows 7.\n\n94\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.480\nThe idea that applications and\n\n95\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.850\ninstalling applications can be\ncomplex in most environments.\n\n96\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.470\nBut in today's world, it actually is\na lot easier than it was at one time.\n\n97\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.390\nWhen we were moving from\nWindows XP to Windows 7,\n\n98\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.350\nwe may have had some technical issues.\n\n99\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.340\nAnd a lot of those have now been resolved.\n\n100\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.930\nBut at the same time,\n\n101\n00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.970\nyou may still be supporting a line of\nbusiness application in the background,\n\n102\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.965\nand you're not exactly sure what you\ncan do to deal with that as well.\n\n103\n00:05:00.965 --> 00:05:02.640\nWe'll also take a look at that.\n\n104\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.950\nOf course, the UAC,\nas well as hardware-related issues.\n\n105\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.550\nAnd then lastly,\nthe idea of using accessibility, and\n\n106\n00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.770\nof course availability options too.\n\n107\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.320\nThat really does help someone that\nmay have some type of disability, or\n\n108\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.570\nsome type of other issue that they're\nfacing, and they actually just need to\n\n109\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.000\nbe able to work with Windows 7\na little bit more effectively.\n\n110\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.340\nAs support technicians,\n\n111\n00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.790\nthe very fact is we can't just be\ncentric towards one operating system.\n\n112\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.410\nBeing able to support Windows\n7 is actually a great skill to\n\n113\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.040\nhave on your hand.\n\n114\n00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.170\nAnd so, if you are actually supporting\nthis type of operating system\n\n115\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.780\nin your Enterprise environment, or\nyou go, you want to know something,\n\n116\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.110\nI may actually moving on to another\njob and they're running Windows 7, and\n\n117\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.329\neven though I'm actually, you know,\nmore familiar with Windows 8,\n\n118\n00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:45.620\nI need to actually get a little\nmore familiar with it.\n\n119\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.030\nThis is actually the show for you.\n\n120\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.510\nAnd so,\nif you are really interested in this,\n\n121\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.480\nthis is the show you really want to\nwatch if you're especially interested in\n\n122\n00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.690\nbeing able to troubleshoot some of\nthe issues that we talked about here.\n\n123\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.200\n>> That's right.\n\n124\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.050\nLots of great information there for\na Windows 7 environment.\n\n125\n00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.784\nSo if you're still having to find yourself\nsupporting Windows 7, or if you just wanna\n\n126\n00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:04.905\nround out your skill set and make sure\nthat you are relevant no matter what\n\n127\n00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:08.563\nshop you're working in, we look forward\nto seeing you in these upcoming episodes.\n\n128\n00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:15.299\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.490\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.640\nHow are you doing, Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.290\n>> I am doing fine.\n\n6\n00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.040\nIt's another hot,\nsweltering day here in Florida, but\n\n7\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.870\nit means that we actually get to\nsit inside in the air conditioning.\n\n8\n00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.440\nAnd get started.\n\n9\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.460\nAnd today we're starting\nour series on Windows 7.\n\n10\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.580\nIt's an exciting topic.\n\n11\n00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.210\n>> Absolutely, and I tell you what,\n\n12\n00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.010\nthat's half the reason to go\ninto the IT field, right?\n\n13\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.760\nGet out of the sun.\n\n14\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.055\nGet out of those hot labor jobs.\n\n15\n00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Get into the air conditioning.\n\n16\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.040\nHopefully, well certain parts of it\nwe can be in the air conditioning.\n\n17\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.680\nBut yeah, We've got our\nWindows 7 deployment going on.\n\n18\n00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.690\nWe're gonna take a look at different\nways that we can deploy Windows 7.\n\n19\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.360\nI think today we're gonna focus on what\nwe call, you know basic deployment,\n\n20\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.940\nwhere we don't have,\nwe're a small organization.\n\n21\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.120\nWe don't have the infrastructure\nthat these big companies have,\n\n22\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.430\nwe're not setting up things like systems\ncenter configuration manager, or\n\n23\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.480\neven deployment services.\n\n24\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.190\nWe're gonna take a look at how you,\nat a small organization, with just a few\n\n25\n00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.100\nmachines, can still take advantage of\ncreating images and deploying images out.\n\n26\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.030\nSo, when it's time to reinstall, when\na machine goes bad, a hard drive fails,\n\n27\n00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.430\nI can get a new operating\nsystem on it in 15, 30 minutes.\n\n28\n00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.620\nOr if I get some malware on a machine,\nI can go and\n\n29\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.710\nreimage that machine very quickly and\nget that user back up and running.\n\n30\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.580\nSo, We're gonna take a look\nat basic deployment skills.\n\n31\n00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.090\nAnd the first thing, Ronny,\nI think we're gonna start with is\n\n32\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.230\nsetting up a technician machine,\nwhich is a machine that we're gonna use to\n\n33\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.410\nperform all of these tasks, and\nthen start with creating our answer file.\n\n34\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.470\n>> We really wanna actually understand\nthat process just a little bit.\n\n35\n00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.050\nA lot of times, you may actually come\nfrom the field, in which you're saying,\n\n36\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.420\nwell why don't you just throw\na DVD into the machine and go?\n\n37\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.290\nWell, that works, and you can actually do\nthat, but then, at the end of the day,\n\n38\n00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.240\nright, you still have applications\nthat you have to get on there.\n\n39\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.150\nYou still may have updates that\nyou have to actually put on there.\n\n40\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.900\nAnd a lot of times, even with just putting\na DVD in, there's a lot of answers\n\n41\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.890\nthat you also have to provide once\neverything is actually loaded in there.\n\n42\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.530\nWhen we start going into\nthe area of deployment,\n\n43\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.060\nwe are now working as an IT professional.\n\n44\n00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.280\nAnd what we want to do is be able\nto actually have consistent images\n\n45\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.000\nacross our organization,\nwhether small or big.\n\n46\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.820\nBut today we're actually focusing\nin on the manual nitty gritty.\n\n47\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.340\nAnd one of the things that we have to\nbegin with here is what we call that\n\n48\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.860\ntechnical word,\nthat technician's computer.\n\n49\n00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.410\nWe wanna make sure that we load up all the\ntools that we need to get ready to go, so\n\n50\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.570\nthat we can actually have a fairly\nsmooth process in deployment.\n\n51\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.090\nSo normally, you can actually choose\nany machine that you want to.\n\n52\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.195\nIt can be a server 2003 machine.\n\n53\n00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:39.405\nYou're probably not gonna want to do that,\n\n54\n00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:42.205\nit can be a Vista machine, you're probably\nnot gonna want to do that either.\n\n55\n00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:46.163\nMore than likely, for our choice it's\nprobably gonna be a Windows 7 machine.\n\n56\n00:02:46.163 --> 00:02:49.285\nWe're also gonna need a few tools, and\nwe'll talk about that as we get to it.\n\n57\n00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:51.145\nWhich are, kind of the common ones.\n\n58\n00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:53.075\nBut the other things of course,\nthat are fairly easy for\n\n59\n00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:58.575\nus to understand is that we're gonna need\na Windows 7 ISO or a copy of Windows 7.\n\n60\n00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:02.460\nThe disc itself or an ISO so\nthat we can actually have that on hand,\n\n61\n00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.530\nto be ready to be pushed\nout to all our machines.\n\n62\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.690\nAnd, a lot of times,\n\n63\n00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.610\nespecially in the way that we're gonna do\nit, we're gonna also need a network share.\n\n64\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.450\nSome place that everybody on\nthe network can get connected to, so\n\n65\n00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.550\nthat we can connect those machines that\ndon't have an operating system on it,\n\n66\n00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.240\nto make sure that we can do that.\n\n67\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.270\nSo, when we actually have\na technician machine,\n\n68\n00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.720\nit could be your regular\nwork station if you want to.\n\n69\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.510\nWe just need to make sure that\nwe get those proper tools.\n\n70\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.030\nSo Mike, what are the tools\nthat we really actually need so\n\n71\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.620\nthat we can begin our deployment process?\n\n72\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.210\n>> Well,\nthe first one we're gonna go out and\n\n73\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.790\nget is a Windows Automated Install Kit,\nright?\n\n74\n00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.600\nThe Windows AIK, and\nit's a free download from Microsoft.\n\n75\n00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.890\nAnd as Ronnie said, you can do this\non the machine you sit at every day.\n\n76\n00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.330\nIf this is your job.\n\n77\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.930\nYou're the IT guy for a small company, and\nyou have to do this on a regular basis.\n\n78\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.650\nMaybe you put it on your actual machine,\nor\n\n79\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.830\nmaybe you put it inside a virtual machine.\n\n80\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.900\nI find the big advantage of setting up\na technician computer like this is,\n\n81\n00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.250\nbecause some of the files\nwe're dealing with are large.\n\n82\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.640\nWorking with those WIM files and\nthe source code for Windows and\n\n83\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.760\nthings like that.\n\n84\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.620\nIf I have to go and download these files\nevery time, go install this every time,\n\n85\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.610\nit becomes tedious.\n\n86\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.300\nSo I like to have this\nstuff pre-installed.\n\n87\n00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.930\nMy personal preference,\nthrow it inside a virtual machine.\n\n88\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.670\nThat way I can shut it\ndown when I don't need it.\n\n89\n00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.260\nWhen I gotta work with those tools again,\nI can bring them right back up.\n\n90\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.620\nBut, what I've got here on my screen\nis just a virtual PC that I've set up.\n\n91\n00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.790\nWe're using Virtual Box here.\n\n92\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.620\nAnd I went ahead and I downloaded\nthe Windows automated install kit for\n\n93\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.230\nWindows 7.\n\n94\n00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.500\nNow you gotta be real careful with this,\n\n95\n00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.950\nbecause they are specific\nto the version number.\n\n96\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.680\nThis Windows 7 automated install kit\nwill work with Windows 7 and prior.\n\n97\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.670\nBut it wouldn't work with Windows 7 with\nService Pack 1, for example, or Windows 8\n\n98\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.890\nor anything in the future, so you've got\nto make sure you get the right version.\n\n99\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.870\nYou download that and you run it.\n\n100\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.850\nI've already got it installed,\nbut I'm gonna go ahead,\n\n101\n00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.680\nand let's see if we can\nmount that up again.\n\n102\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.760\nI've already got it installed so\n\n103\n00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.780\nI wanted to kind of show you\nguys that installation process.\n\n104\n00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.290\nBut it's, I forget, it's not going to\nlet me mount it with good old Windows 7,\n\n105\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.780\nso maybe I'll show you\nthat in another show.\n\n106\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.440\nBut got it installed.\n\n107\n00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.580\nAnd so over here, I've got my\nWindows Automated Install Kit, or WAIK.\n\n108\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.970\nAnd you can see, I've got my\ndeployment tools command prompt.\n\n109\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.590\nas well as something called\nthe Windows Systems Image Manager.\n\n110\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.400\nAnd this is a tool we're gonna\nuse to create those answer files.\n\n111\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.980\nAn important tool we're gonna use later.\n\n112\n00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.920\nAnd it comes with some\nvery good documentation.\n\n113\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.210\nAll the step by steps for\nsetting up a test lab end, for\n\n114\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.670\ngoing through the process of creating\nan image are gonna be included in here.\n\n115\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.990\n>> One of the nice things about\nthe AIK is that Microsoft and\n\n116\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.520\nWindows really designed it for\nevery possibility.\n\n117\n00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.070\nSo, not only do you have\na large infrastructure or\n\n118\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.350\nyou actually have a small infrastructure.\n\n119\n00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.350\nYou don't have anything at all that\nWindows AIK, actually is designed to so\n\n120\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.340\nthat you have all\nthe tools available to you.\n\n121\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.540\nRegardless of what you have.\n\n122\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.290\nSo, the nice thing that you actually saw,\nright, is it comes with some of that,\n\n123\n00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.710\nwe call the deployment and imaging\nservicing, you know, management kit there.\n\n124\n00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.190\nAnd that is a command lined shelf for\nyou to be able to actually\n\n125\n00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.310\nrun all the commands that you need to,\nto bring about a full deployment.\n\n126\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.170\nNow you might be wondering like,\nwhy is that important?\n\n127\n00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.790\nIt's important because if you\nstarted off in the earlier Vista,\n\n128\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.130\nyou actually had two utilities\nthat you had to run.\n\n129\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.880\nBeginning with Windows 7, they merged\nthat into this one utility, and\n\n130\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.110\nthat's really a big help for us because\nit means we're no longer having to manage\n\n131\n00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.770\ntwo different outputs or\nsyntaxes all done underneath that.\n\n132\n00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.760\nThe other thing that they also\nincluded in this is that SIM,\n\n133\n00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.300\nthat System Image Manager.\n\n134\n00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.742\nAnd we're gonna get in that\njust in a few moments here,\n\n135\n00:06:46.742 --> 00:06:48.790\nit's about creating an answer file.\n\n136\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.020\nAnd it really does help\nus when we actually do\n\n137\n00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.460\nhave all those questions\nthat we need to answer, so\n\n138\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.410\nthat we can actually get all those\nquestions answered, put it in a file.\n\n139\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.210\nAnd then you use that in deployment.\n\n140\n00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.560\nAnd lastly, you saw a little tiny entry\ninto which has been the frustration\n\n141\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.120\nof me for years and\nyears which is the VAMT.\n\n142\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.190\nNow if you actually take a look at that,\n\n143\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.530\nthat's the Volume\nActivation Management Tool.\n\n144\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.050\nMike, you and I know that this thing\nis by far, they call it a server so\n\n145\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.880\nyou can manage the way\nthat your volume licensing\n\n146\n00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.580\nactivation keys are going\nto be distributed.\n\n147\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.800\nBut I have never been\nvery successful at it.\n\n148\n00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.510\nI have run through a set\nof keys like crazy.\n\n149\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.030\nAnd so they even included that because\nthey know that licensing is a big part\n\n150\n00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.470\nof what's important to\nthe deployment side.\n\n151\n00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.660\nSo that's really the main tool that you\nand I are actually going to deal with.\n\n152\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.360\nSo when we take a look at what\nwe're going to actually do here.\n\n153\n00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.850\nWe're going to install\nthat onto the computer and\n\n154\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.110\nthen we're gonna begin the process.\n\n155\n00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.693\nSo I went ahead while Ronnie was\ntalking there, I went ahead and\n\n156\n00:07:49.693 --> 00:07:52.245\ngrabbed the amount of that ISO back up so\nI could show you guys.\n\n157\n00:07:52.245 --> 00:07:53.328\nCuz it's really pretty cool.\n\n158\n00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:56.967\nWhen you download the Windows automated\ninstall kit, and you run it this is\n\n159\n00:07:56.967 --> 00:08:00.110\nthe screen your gonna get And\nI can see I've got lots of options.\n\n160\n00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.273\nLike, I've got a step-by-step\ndeployment process.\n\n161\n00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:06.067\nThis will actually walk me through\nthe process of using this to automate\n\n162\n00:08:06.067 --> 00:08:10.440\nthe installation of Windows 7, so\nvery good instructions in here.\n\n163\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.100\nThen you've got the Windows IAK setup.\n\n164\n00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.210\nNow I've already run through that on this\ncomputer so we didn't have to wait for\n\n165\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.790\nit on-air,\nI've already got it installed, but\n\n166\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.200\nthis is where you would\ngo to install that.\n\n167\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.940\nSo, you'd download it You mount up\nthat ISO, and you come in here, and\n\n168\n00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.080\nyou click Windows AIK Setup,\nand it installs Windows AIK.\n\n169\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.770\nAnd as Ronnie said,\nthat includes the systems image manager,\n\n170\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.340\nas well as the documentation, as well\nas that volume activation management.\n\n171\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.380\nThere's some other things\nI can do in here as well.\n\n172\n00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.440\nI could download the application\ncompatibility toolkit.\n\n173\n00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.190\nAnd if we're just now migrating to\nWindows 7, I might need to worry about\n\n174\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.830\nsome applications that have been\nrunning on Windows XP or Windows Vista.\n\n175\n00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.130\nAre those gonna be able to be migrated\nover to Windows 7 when we make that jump?\n\n176\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.920\nYou can also download the assessment\nplanning toolkit from here,\n\n177\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.100\nwhich is a tool I can use\nto analyze my network.\n\n178\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.960\nAnd see what the steps are going to\nbe involved, to migrate to Windows 7.\n\n179\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.810\nYou can get the Microsoft Deployment Took\nKit, which is another set of tools that\n\n180\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.130\ncan help me to go through\nthe process of deploying Windows 7.\n\n181\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.730\nWhat I like is it also gives me that .net\nframework set up, so if I have a machine,\n\n182\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.410\nyoure gonna need .net framework 2,0 on\nthe machine on your technician machine.\n\n183\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.690\nSo it gives you a link to that as well.\n\n184\n00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.490\nSo again, I've already run\nthrough the Windows AIK setup, so\n\n185\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.160\nI'll just go ahead and exit out of this.\n\n186\n00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.150\nAll right, so\nonce we get that installed, Ronnie,\n\n187\n00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.450\nthe first thing we're gonna wanna\ndo is build our answer file.\n\n188\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.260\nWe know that when we're installing Windows\n7, certain questions come up, right?\n\n189\n00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.870\nI've gotta configure certain\nsettings on that installation, and\n\n190\n00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.960\nI don't wanna have to be there.\n\n191\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.660\nI don't wanna have to go to four or\nfive different machines.\n\n192\n00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.960\nUsing that DVD and\nentering in all that information, or\n\n193\n00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.880\nonce I've captured an image, I don't\nwant to have to sit there and wait for\n\n194\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.910\nit to finish it and then come back and\nanswer all of those questions, either.\n\n195\n00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.390\nSo that answer file gives us\nthe ability to automate that.\n\n196\n00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.890\n>> It's a very important\npart of the process\n\n197\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.230\nonce we start dealing with\nwhat Mike was saying.\n\n198\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.220\nIt's that we have multiple machines.\n\n199\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.530\nWith one machine that's bad enough where\nonce we install the operating system,\n\n200\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.030\neven with just putting the DVD in and\nletting it boot up,\n\n201\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.600\nthat at the end of that process,\nwe still need to provide some information.\n\n202\n00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.950\nPartition information,\nwe may need to make a user account.\n\n203\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.260\nYou name it,\nwe actually have to add in product keys,\n\n204\n00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.300\nwe have to do several different things.\n\n205\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.710\nTime Play settings, all that stuff.\n\n206\n00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.520\nBut then when you start going to five or\nten machines, or multiple machines, when\n\n207\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.910\nyou start having to do that, remember what\nthat means then, in production network.\n\n208\n00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.860\nThat means if something\nhappened to Mike's computer and\n\n209\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.450\nsaid you know the best thing is,\nnow that you got all this malware on it,\n\n210\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.240\nis I just need to blow the machine away\nand reinstall the operating system.\n\n211\n00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.780\nWell I start that installation process,\n\n212\n00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.770\nand then I head on to work\non somebody else's computer.\n\n213\n00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.760\nAnd then at the end of it the user's\nstill just sitting there like okay,\n\n214\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.650\nwell what do I do next.\n\n215\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.290\nWell they might not know what to do next,\nand that means they're just sitting there.\n\n216\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.280\nBy being able to create what\nwe call this answer file,\n\n217\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.280\nwe're already providing all\nthose answers necessary.\n\n218\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.110\nSo that when the installation\nprocess begins, or\n\n219\n00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:05.600\nthe deployment process begins,\nTo go ahead and\n\n220\n00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.770\nget that set up so that we don't have to\nbe there when it finishes it's install.\n\n221\n00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.280\nAnd a lot of times it can be where\nall they're actually doing is\n\n222\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.800\ntyping their username and\npassword and getting ready to go.\n\n223\n00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.020\nIt's a pretty neat process.\n\n224\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.670\n>> Absolutely.\n\n225\n00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.480\nAll right, so\nthe first thing we're gonna do.\n\n226\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.770\nIf we're gonna go create this answer file\nthere's a few things we have to set up\n\n227\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.800\nto use this systems image manager.\n\n228\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.000\nAgain, that's part of the Windows AIK\nthat we've downloaded and installed.\n\n229\n00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.300\nOn our technician machine.\n\n230\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.480\nSo if we pull up my screen here, I've done\na little bit of this ahead of time, again,\n\n231\n00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.950\njust to save us a little waiting while\nwe're watching this file copy over.\n\n232\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.410\nBut the first thing you're going to want\nto do, is get your Windows seven ISO, and\n\n233\n00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.420\nI've got that mounted up\non this virtual machine.\n\n234\n00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.320\nSo I come in here, on that disk,\nif you go, this is the Windows seven.\n\n235\n00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.260\nI think this one is actually Enterprise.\n\n236\n00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.790\nBut if I go into that Sources folder, I'm\ngonna find a couple of wim files on here.\n\n237\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.880\nAnd let's just go ahead and\ndo a quick search.\n\n238\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.120\nI'll show you those guys.\n\n239\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.855\nIf it's gonna let me.\n\n240\n00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:03.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There is goes.\n\n241\n00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.520\nLittle lag going on.\n\n242\n00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.790\nThere's my two wim files.\n\n243\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.510\nI've got boot.wim and install.wim.\n\n244\n00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.840\nAnd I'll scroll down and\nshow you those guys as well.\n\n245\n00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.570\nSo, install.win is the one I want.\n\n246\n00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.190\nThat is the file that we\nuse to install Windows 7.\n\n247\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.040\nSo what we do is we grab\nthat off of the DVD.\n\n248\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.700\nAgain, this is the Windows 7 DVD,\nI'm in the sources folder, and\n\n249\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.650\nI've found install.win.\n\n250\n00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.810\nI'm going to copy that over\nto my local hard drive.\n\n251\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.050\nSo I've made a folder called win and\n\n252\n00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.880\nI've already copied install.wim\ninto that directory.\n\n253\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.940\nAlright, once I've got that done,\n\n254\n00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.370\nthe next thing we're gonna do is we're\ngonna fire up systems image manager.\n\n255\n00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.020\nSo I come over here to my Start menu,\nI can say that again!\n\n256\n00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.860\nWe're back on Windows 7, I love it.\n\n257\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.560\nAnd I can pull up all programs and\n\n258\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:58.200\ngo into my Microsoft Windows AIK And\nthere is my Windows System Image Manager.\n\n259\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:58.968\nSo I'll fire that up.\n\n260\n00:13:02.174 --> 00:13:03.394\nWait for it to load up.\n\n261\n00:13:06.055 --> 00:13:11.530\nAnd once it pops up, we're gonna have to\ngo tell it where those files are located.\n\n262\n00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.400\nNow, we're gonna point it to that WIM\nfile that I copied off of the DVD.\n\n263\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.230\nAnd so, let me maximize this guy here.\n\n264\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.170\nSo, down here in the bottom\nleft hand corner,\n\n265\n00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.760\nnow you can resize all these windows.\n\n266\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.560\nYou can also set up distribution shares.\n\n267\n00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.620\nMaybe you have the Windows.\n\n268\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.530\nFiles.\n\n269\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.940\nCopy it up to a network location so\nthat one more technician\n\n270\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.170\ncould hit that source and not have to copy\nit locally cuz they do take up space.\n\n271\n00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.120\nBut I'm gonna go down here and\nselect a image or\n\n272\n00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.690\ncatalog file and\nI'm gonna go grab that file.\n\n273\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.430\nSo I put that on my C drive and\na full recall of wim and\n\n274\n00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.400\nI'm gonna grab install.wim Now\nwhat this tool is gonna do,\n\n275\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.940\nit’s gonna help me create the answer file.\n\n276\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.620\nIt knows about all of the options\nthat are available in Windows 7,\n\n277\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.220\nall of the different things that\nI can put in my answer file.\n\n278\n00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.230\nBut it needs what’s called\na catalog file or a CLG.\n\n279\n00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.420\nThat’s what’s gonna allow it to\nDisplay those options in this tool so\n\n280\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.510\nI can work with it.\n\n281\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.450\nSo when I pull that WIM in,\nit says, wait a second,\n\n282\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.650\nMike, you don't have a catalog file.\n\n283\n00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.250\nI don't know what options go\nwith that particular version of\n\n284\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.140\nthe operating system.\n\n285\n00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.930\nDo you want me to make one?\n\n286\n00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.910\nAnd we're gonna say yes, yes we do.\n\n287\n00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.090\nWe absolutely do.\n\n288\n00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.040\nNow, on the DVD, there is a catalog file.\n\n289\n00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.730\nI don't know about you Ronnie, but\nI always just choose to make my own.\n\n290\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.390\nI could have copied the WIM file.\n\n291\n00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.730\nAnd the catalog file off of the DVD,\n\n292\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.830\nI usually let it just make its\nown once I've copied over.\n\n293\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.610\n>> Yeah, when it's generating its own,\nit's setting in place all of the structure\n\n294\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.910\nthat we need that we'll now have to go in\nand customize and add in those settings.\n\n295\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.660\nNow this can take a little bit of time.\n\n296\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.290\nSometimes it can be very quick, but\n\n297\n00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.710\nsometimes it may take\na little bit of time.\n\n298\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.680\nDoesn't look like it's gonna\ntake too much time here.\n\n299\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.540\nBut when it actually finishes that,\nwe will then be able to go in and\n\n300\n00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.970\nadd some modifications.\n\n301\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.110\nNow, when I first actually encountered\nthis, I remember thinking,\n\n302\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.970\nwell, now many modifications can we make?\n\n303\n00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.570\nAnd Mike, one of the things that\nwe'll find out here in just a moment.\n\n304\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.310\nIs that we can make\na ton of modifications.\n\n305\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.980\nThere are so many different settings\nwe can get into, and that's because of\n\n306\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.760\nthe way that Windows 7 is actually gonna\nbe put onto that operating system.\n\n307\n00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.280\nAnd add in different settings,\n\n308\n00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.290\nso it can actually be put in there at\nthe times that it's actually running.\n\n309\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.380\nSo, once that catalogue\nfile's gonna be created,\n\n310\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.370\nwe're gonna system\ngenerate something else.\n\n311\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.220\nNow whilst doing that, let's go ahead and\npull that system image manager back up,\n\n312\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.520\nand we can talk about some of these other\nSettings that we also see in here and\n\n313\n00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.300\nwhat's gonna end up happening.\n\n314\n00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.800\nSo Mike talked about\nthe distribution shares and\n\n315\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.240\nalso in that lower left hand corner\nwe're gonna create that catalogue file.\n\n316\n00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.530\nWe're gonna see that populate, but it's\nright behind where we have that message\n\n317\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.400\nbox there that we're actually gonna end up\nseeing a structure and a directory here.\n\n318\n00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.370\nThat's gonna actually have what\nwe call the different passes.\n\n319\n00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.469\nAnd that's because Windows, itself,\ndoesn't install all at one time.\n\n320\n00:15:57.469 --> 00:16:01.739\nWhat it does is, it actually does multiple\npasses across the hard drive Laying down\n\n321\n00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:04.674\nmore and more information as\nit actually passes it here.\n\n322\n00:16:04.674 --> 00:16:07.255\nAnd so, we're going to see that\nthere's going to be certain keys or\n\n323\n00:16:07.255 --> 00:16:10.440\ncertain elements that were actually\ngoing to go to run on those passes.\n\n324\n00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.110\nAnd some places we're not\ngonna be able to do that.\n\n325\n00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.310\nSo when that happens all of that\nwill end up being populated.\n\n326\n00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.490\nOver on the right hand\nside you can see details.\n\n327\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.190\nWhen you click on one of those Options\nthat we'll find in the catalog.\n\n328\n00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.050\nYou actually see that over\non the right hand side.\n\n329\n00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.430\nThey actually will give you all\nof the options you can change.\n\n330\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.710\nAnd also give you the options\nyou can't change.\n\n331\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.830\nAnd then you'll also be able to add\nin certain elements in there too.\n\n332\n00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.550\nAnd then on the bottom you'll\nactually see an element there for\n\n333\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:40.360\nbeing able to well check the entire\nanswer file after your done.\n\n334\n00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.650\nAnd you'll actually see where\nthere's errors or there.\n\n335\n00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.410\nThere is some type of alert that tells you\nyou need to go back and check this, too.\n\n336\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:46.940\n>> All right.\nSo\n\n337\n00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.690\nit's finally finished creating that\ncatalog, and now I can see over here under\n\n338\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.410\nmy lower left hand pane,\nwhere it says Windows Image.\n\n339\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:57.900\nI've got my Windows 7 enterprise and\nthis is the catalog it generated.\n\n340\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.240\nI'm gonna drag this border up,\nbecause in my situation,\n\n341\n00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.680\nI'm not using a distribution share.\n\n342\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.930\nSo that's kinda wasted space.\n\n343\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.620\nSo we're gonna pull this up.\n\n344\n00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.360\nAs you're gonna see.\n\n345\n00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.700\nNeed a lot of room to\nexpand out these options.\n\n346\n00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.090\nWhen I go to components and\nI expand that out,\n\n347\n00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:14.850\nyou'll see all of these\ndifferent categories.\n\n348\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:18.090\nIn fact, I'm gonna drag this\nover a little bit as well.\n\n349\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:23.020\nSo these are all of the different things\nthat I can add to my answer file.\n\n350\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.650\nAny one of these and I can come in here.\n\n351\n00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.530\nAnd for example, Ronnie,\nwhat's the first one that we want to add?\n\n352\n00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.250\nDo we know off hand?\n\n353\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.420\n>> Want to go ahead and\n\n354\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.870\nset up the user interface language\nis what we really want to do.\n\n355\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.370\n>> Okay.\n\n356\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.740\n>> So you actually see that when you take\na look at all of these different options,\n\n357\n00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.700\nthere are a bunch of these components and\nthe problem is we have to drill down into\n\n358\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.270\nthem to actually find what\nwe want to be able to do.\n\n359\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.860\nSo what we want to do is we want\nto look for one that is called\n\n360\n00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:54.005\nthe Microsoft-Windows-International\nCore-PE is the one that we want.\n\n361\n00:17:54.005 --> 00:17:55.300\n>> Core-Win-PE, alright.\n\n362\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.730\nSo I'm going to make an answer file first,\n\n363\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.120\nbecause I don't have any place to store\nthe options that I'm selecting yet.\n\n364\n00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.470\nSo I'm going to go over\nhere it says 'Create or\n\n365\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.710\nopen an answer file.' If you already had\none, and you just need to modify it or\n\n366\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.800\ntweak it, you could open it up here.\n\n367\n00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.730\nAnd make changes to it.\n\n368\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.260\nI haven't started yet so\nwe're going to create one.\n\n369\n00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:16.760\nSo I'm going to choose New Answer File and\nit will whirl and\n\n370\n00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.540\ngrind for just a second and\nit will create my New Answer File.\n\n371\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.840\nNow I'll have somewhere\nto add these options to.\n\n372\n00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.980\nSo there's the different passes\nRonnie was talking about.\n\n373\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.180\nSo you have to understand what pass\nthe particular option you're adding\n\n374\n00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.150\nis going to be read from.\n\n375\n00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.360\nFor the first one, Ronnie, you said\nto go to Windows international core,\n\n376\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.160\nwin pe neutral.\n\n377\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.210\n>> Right.\n>> I'm gonna expand that out and\n\n378\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.710\nunderneath there I've got setup language.\n\n379\n00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:48.890\nNow the way this works If I want to\ninclude that setting in my answer file,\n\n380\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.270\nthen what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna right click on it and\n\n381\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.740\nthere's the different passes.\n\n382\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.630\nNow this particular setting is\nonly available in that first pass,\n\n383\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.510\nwhen Windows PE is beginning\nthe install process.\n\n384\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.880\nSo that's my only option.\n\n385\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.380\nSo I'm gonna choose add setting\nto pass one on WinPE And\n\n386\n00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.280\nwhat will happen is you'll see over here\nin the middle pane where my answer file\n\n387\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.300\nis, I now have my setup\nUI language option.\n\n388\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.060\nRemember, when you first go to install\nWindows, let's say you're using the DVD,\n\n389\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.960\nwhat's one of the first\nthings it asks you?\n\n390\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.390\nWhat language are you going to use so it\ncan display it properly on screen, right?\n\n391\n00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.720\nSo now I wanna configure that option.\n\n392\n00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.740\nSo the option is there.\n\n393\n00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.000\nI select it and now over here on\nthe right where I've got my setup\n\n394\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.470\nUI language properties, this is where\nI can actually fill in the values.\n\n395\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.700\nSo the answer file contains the option.\n\n396\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.020\nOver here on the right is where\nI configure the properties.\n\n397\n00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.710\nSo what do we want to set that to, Ronnie?\n\n398\n00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.600\n>> We're going to say US is the one\nthat we're going to set that to.\n\n399\n00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.300\n>> Let's do a little EN dash US for\nthat input local.\n\n400\n00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.110\nI believe we're gonna do\nthe system locale as well?\n\n401\n00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.680\n>> We are.\n\n402\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.306\nThe same thing.\n\n403\n00:19:49.306 --> 00:19:51.290\n>> en-us for that.\n\n404\n00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.480\nWhich other one do we need to do?\n\n405\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.368\n>> The UI language.\n\n406\n00:19:53.368 --> 00:19:56.360\n>> Gonna put en-us for that.\n\n407\n00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.740\n>> And\nthen also of course the user locale.\n\n408\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.944\n>> And the user locale, en-us.\n\n409\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.310\nAll right.\n\n410\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.200\nAnd then anything under here,\nI think the UI language here as well.\n\n411\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.500\nI'm gonna put en-us.\n\n412\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.410\nNow pay attention to what I just\ndid there when you added that.\n\n413\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.780\nWhen I added that to WinPE,\nyou notice there's some options here\n\n414\n00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.270\nunder the base setting,\nthe international core WinPE.\n\n415\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.970\nThere's also some here,\nunder the setup UI language, all right?\n\n416\n00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.940\nBut make sure you fill all of those in.\n\n417\n00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.080\nCertain settings are gonna be\nrequired to do an unattended install.\n\n418\n00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.900\nAll those things that you get asked\nduring the installation process,\n\n419\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.540\nif you forget one of those settings,\nWhat happens is,\n\n420\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.990\nWindows doesn't know the answer you\nwant to provide, and has to stop.\n\n421\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.990\nAnd you no longer have\nan unattended insult.\n\n422\n00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.280\nYou're gonna have to be there\nto provide that answer.\n\n423\n00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.650\nSo good documentation on Microsoft's\nwebsite about every option that has to be\n\n424\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.580\nincluded and\nwe're gonna go through those here.\n\n425\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.330\nSo what's next Ryan?\n\n426\n00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.730\nWe got our setup language.\n\n427\n00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.180\nContrary to our set up language,\nif we wanted to,\n\n428\n00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.930\nremember that during the install process\nyou're also gonna be asked normally\n\n429\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.010\nabout just what size\npartition you wanna create.\n\n430\n00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.670\nWell if you don't want that\nto stop right then, and\n\n431\n00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.040\nthen you have to answer,\nwe're gonna need to set that up as well.\n\n432\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.240\nSo we're gonna go back into that\ncatalog and find the option for that.\n\n433\n00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:14.080\nAnd that option is actually gonna be\nlocated under Microsoft-Windows-SetUp And\n\n434\n00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.750\nthen you'll actually see that\nthere's going to be disconfiguration\n\n435\n00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:17.480\nunderneath that.\n\n436\n00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.680\n>> Mhmm, so we're gonna go Windows\nsetup and under here I've got my\n\n437\n00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.045\ndisconfiguration and I've got disc\n>> That create partitions and\n\n438\n00:21:26.045 --> 00:21:26.975\nmodify partitions.\n\n439\n00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:30.805\n>> Yeah and so we really want\nall of those options in there so\n\n440\n00:21:30.805 --> 00:21:32.585\nthat we can actually\ncreate those partitions.\n\n441\n00:21:32.585 --> 00:21:34.895\nRight so\nif I drill down to this very bottom one,\n\n442\n00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:37.575\nI could add this one to pass one.\n\n443\n00:21:37.575 --> 00:21:41.655\nYou can also come up here and\nadd that entire section to pass.\n\n444\n00:21:41.655 --> 00:21:43.115\nActually it didn't want to do it that way.\n\n445\n00:21:43.115 --> 00:21:46.330\nAll right so we'll go down to\nthe bottom and we'll add Past one.\n\n446\n00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.510\nAnd if you add something lower,\nit adds everything above that, so\n\n447\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.250\nyou can see that full\ntree is listed over here.\n\n448\n00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.800\nSo I've got create partitions,\nand I've got create partition.\n\n449\n00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.680\nA little bit confusing,\nthis is where people stumble sometimes.\n\n450\n00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.170\nYeah, I've got create partitions, plural.\n\n451\n00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.470\nI could make more than one partition\nduring the installation process.\n\n452\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.630\nMaybe I want to make a C: for\nthe operating system,\n\n453\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:11.900\nand I want a separate partition on that\nsame drive for data and things like that.\n\n454\n00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.700\nWell, the create partitions plural is\nwhere I'd do that Create a partition.\n\n455\n00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.780\nThis will allow me to add one partition,\nand let's create our first one.\n\n456\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.530\nAnd then I'll show you what I\nmean by creating multiples.\n\n457\n00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.900\nSo I go to Create Partition,\nand we're going to.\n\n458\n00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.280\nRonnie, we want to, what?\n\n459\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.390\nExtend that out?\n\n460\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.933\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n461\n00:22:27.933 --> 00:22:29.290\n>> Or?\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n462\n00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.070\n>> No, we're just gonna make a basic\n\n463\n00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.350\npartition or a primary one.\n\n464\n00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.290\n>> All right.\n\n465\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.630\nHow big do we want to make that guy?\n\n466\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.690\n>> Well the first one that we want because\nof the way that Windows 7 sets itself up\n\n467\n00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:42.130\nis that we actually have a little\nunencrypted partition that we can have.\n\n468\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.900\nLet's just make it a 200\nmegabyte partition.\n\n469\n00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.700\n>> All right.\n\n470\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.160\n>> So that we can have\nthe system set up information.\n\n471\n00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.220\n>> All right, so\nwe'll put 200 over there for my value.\n\n472\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.130\nAnd the one that we wanna also go\nahead and set up is the order,\n\n473\n00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.660\nwhich is actually where it's gonna\nappear in the boot process as well.\n\n474\n00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.330\nWe're just gonna set that to a one for\nright now.\n\n475\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.400\n>> Set that to a zero or a one?\n\n476\n00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.640\nPartition set at one right?\n\n477\n00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.840\n>> I think it's gonna be a one, yep.\n\n478\n00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.970\nOkay.\n\n479\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.560\n>> All right.\nAnd\n\n480\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.950\nnow we need to set up another partition so\nthat we can install windows on it too.\n\n481\n00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.970\nSo we're gonna actually go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n482\n00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.890\n>> All right so now what I'm going to do\nis because I could only create that one\n\n483\n00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.130\npartition here right.\n\n484\n00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.330\nSo what I do is I go back over here and\nI add the create partition again.\n\n485\n00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.870\nSo now you'll see why that\nplural kinda makes sense.\n\n486\n00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.000\nThe categories create partitions and\n\n487\n00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.330\nI can add the create partition\nsingular as many times as I need to.\n\n488\n00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.500\nAll right so we'll do that create\na partition and what we want for\n\n489\n00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.080\nthis guy, right?\n\n490\n00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.330\n>> This time we do want to extend it out.\n\n491\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.890\nWe're gonna change that to true.\n\n492\n00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.760\n>> And what that means is we're creating\nthat 200 megabyte partition, right?\n\n493\n00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.930\nAnd the second partition, I just want\nit to take up the rest of the space on\n\n494\n00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.870\nthat drive,\nI don't know how big that drive is.\n\n495\n00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:49.950\nIt could be a 80 gig drive, it could be\na 120 gigabyte drive or what have you.\n\n496\n00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.760\nExtend just says, all right, just take\nup the rest of the available space.\n\n497\n00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.632\n>> Right, and make sure that's\nthe primary partition when that's-\n\n498\n00:23:56.632 --> 00:23:59.150\n>> And that is gonna be Type of Primary.\n\n499\n00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.399\n>> And the Order is gonna be two.\n\n500\n00:24:00.399 --> 00:24:03.870\n>> And the order is gonna be two,\nall right.\n\n501\n00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.964\nAnd I don't need to set a size,\nright, because it's gonna extend out,\n\n502\n00:24:06.964 --> 00:24:08.440\ntake up whatever space is left.\n\n503\n00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.360\nAll right, so now we got a couple\npartitions on that drive.\n\n504\n00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.990\n>> We do, we have a couple partitions.\n\n505\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:18.800\nBut the problem is Windows normally\nruns on a file system as well.\n\n506\n00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.930\nSo, what we want to do is we want\nto modify those partitions, so\n\n507\n00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.960\nwe're gonna add in a file\nsystem such as NTFS.\n\n508\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.450\n>> That's when I'm gonna come over here\nand right click on modify partition.\n\n509\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.460\nI'm gonna add that to pass one as well.\n\n510\n00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.100\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n511\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.760\n>> And we're gonna be formatting\nboth of those partitions here,\n\n512\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.030\nso once we actually have\nthe modified partition.\n\n513\n00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.380\nWe're going to mark it as being active,\nas being true.\n\n514\n00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.170\n>> Notice that active is true.\n\n515\n00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.190\n>> And the format's going to turn to NTFS.\n\n516\n00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.480\n>> Format this guy with NTFS.\n\n517\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.920\n>> And we're gonna provide a label.\n\n518\n00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.030\nThat way we can actually tell\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n519\n00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.130\nAnd we're just gonna call this\none our system partition.\n\n520\n00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.320\nAnd the order is gonna become a one.\n\n521\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.950\nAnd the partition ID is gonna be one.\n\n522\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.660\n>> Because it doesn't know,\nright, which partition.\n\n523\n00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.700\nWe just created two\npartitions a second ago.\n\n524\n00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:11.120\nSo I gotta tell it which\npartition we're referring to.\n\n525\n00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.330\nAll right.\n\n526\n00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.880\nAlright, and we need to do the same\nthing on that second partition as well.\n\n527\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.810\nSo I'm gonna add another\nmodify partition to pass one.\n\n528\n00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:24.960\nAnd so once we have that in there, we need\nto set that one to two as for the order.\n\n529\n00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.270\nOrder's gonna be two,\npartition id is gonna be two as well.\n\n530\n00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.090\nRight?\n\n531\n00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.530\nAnd then the format's going to be NTFS,\nand\n\n532\n00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.180\nthen the label on this\none will be Windows.\n\n533\n00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:34.700\n>> And label Windows.\n\n534\n00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.040\nIt's skipping around on me there.\n\n535\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.730\nAlright, there we go.\n\n536\n00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.690\n>> There we go.\n\n537\n00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.050\n>> Alright.\n\n538\n00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.720\nSo now I've got two partitions created.\n\n539\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.740\nBoth of those partitions\nare gonna be formatted as NTSF.\n\n540\n00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.270\nWe didn't set that one as active, right?\n\n541\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.910\nActive represents the partition\nthat's gonna contain your\n\n542\n00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.670\nbootable operating system.\n\n543\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.760\n>> Now there's a couple of other\noptions that we want to add in here,\n\n544\n00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.450\njust in case there's\nan error that appears too.\n\n545\n00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:06.500\nSo on this one, we are actually\ngoing to go into the image install.\n\n546\n00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.870\nUnder Microsoft Windows -, or\n\n547\n00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:13.690\nMicrosoft- Windows- setup back /\nimage install and then OS image.\n\n548\n00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:19.970\nWe want to go ahead and actually say\ninstall to the available partition.\n\n549\n00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.690\nWe want to set that up as\nbeing false when we get it.\n\n550\n00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.630\nI'm a little bit faster than you.\n\n551\n00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:25.470\nOops.\n>> It was actually there.\n\n552\n00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:26.520\nThere it is.\nYeah, go ahead and\n\n553\n00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.970\nset that one to being false right now and\nthen we'll show you.\n\n554\n00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.820\nWe want that to be only on error.\n\n555\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.810\nSo if you click on that you'll actually\nsee a drop down will also appear\n\n556\n00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.445\nthat gives you some different options.\n\n557\n00:26:39.445 --> 00:26:40.972\n>> Alright.\n\n558\n00:26:40.972 --> 00:26:42.500\n>> Alright.\n\n559\n00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.640\nAnd, now we want to actually say where\nare we gonna install the operating\n\n560\n00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.730\nsystem as well.\n\n561\n00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.550\nSo under that same location,\nwe're looking for\n\n562\n00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.260\nthe InstallTo option over on the catalog.\n\n563\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.090\nWe want to make sure that\nwe add that in there.\n\n564\n00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.490\nAnd for the disk ID there,\nit's gonna be zero.\n\n565\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.775\n>> Because drives start with zero,\npartitions start with one, right?\n\n566\n00:27:03.775 --> 00:27:04.570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n567\n00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.380\nAnd then the partition ID\nis going to be number two.\n\n568\n00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.170\nThe one that we matched up inside.\n\n569\n00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.180\nThere we go.\n\n570\n00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.400\nNow once we have that, right,\n\n571\n00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.840\nthat's actually saying we're going to set\nthe hard drive up the way that we want to.\n\n572\n00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.830\nWe've now actually told what\nthe user langauge is going to be.\n\n573\n00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.240\nWe now need to actually go ahead and\naccept some user data as well.\n\n574\n00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.390\nSo one of the options that we\nhave is that little checkmark\n\n575\n00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.070\nwe're gonna actually read.\n\n576\n00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.240\nAnd it says please read all the following,\nright?\n\n577\n00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.250\nWe're gonna g ahead and\njust put that checkmark there for\n\n578\n00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.440\nwhat we call the end\nuser licensing agreement.\n\n579\n00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.135\nSo under Microsoft Windows-Setup,\nwe need to look for User Data.\n\n580\n00:27:35.135 --> 00:27:36.165\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n581\n00:27:36.165 --> 00:27:38.565\nAnd once we actually add\nthat user data in there,\n\n582\n00:27:38.565 --> 00:27:43.705\nwe're gonna actually look for the end user\nlicense there or the accept EULA option.\n\n583\n00:27:43.705 --> 00:27:48.555\n>> So I went ahead and added that user\ndata to pass one or to that WinPE pass and\n\n584\n00:27:48.555 --> 00:27:49.915\nhere's my AcceptEula.\n\n585\n00:27:49.915 --> 00:27:53.445\n>> And then we need to actually use\nthat drop down and select true.\n\n586\n00:27:53.445 --> 00:27:54.035\n>> That's a true.\n\n587\n00:27:54.035 --> 00:27:57.115\nNow I kinda shortcut, you know, Ronnie's\ntalking about using this drop down and\n\n588\n00:27:57.115 --> 00:27:57.905\nyou definitely can.\n\n589\n00:27:57.905 --> 00:27:58.795\nYou can click that and\n\n590\n00:27:58.795 --> 00:28:02.760\nyou can see your different options there\nAll I did was I hit the letter T and tab.\n\n591\n00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.000\nThere's only one thing that\nstarts with a T, right?\n\n592\n00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.960\nTrue or false, so it selects true.\n\n593\n00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.470\nEither way will work.\n\n594\n00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.120\nWhat else do you wanna set in there?\n\n595\n00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.810\n>> We have an option to set the product\nkey if we actually have one, and so\n\n596\n00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.740\nif you wanted to be able to do that,\nunder user data itself,\n\n597\n00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.230\nthere's actually another option there for\nproduct key that we can add in.\n\n598\n00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.890\nNow, you might be wondering,\nwhy in the world would we do that?\n\n599\n00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:29.180\nWell remember that those product keys are\nwhat normally six sets of five digits or\n\n600\n00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.420\nwhatever it might be, it's a lot.\n\n601\n00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.770\nAnd so if I don't have to do that for\nevery single one,\n\n602\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.090\nI can do it one time here.\n\n603\n00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:37.480\nThis may be the way that we\nactually choose to do that.\n\n604\n00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.940\nBut if you want it to stop and\nask you every time, you don't answer here.\n\n605\n00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.150\nSo we can actually enter one in, as well.\n\n606\n00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.350\n>> It is something to think about, right?\n\n607\n00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.990\nIf I’m using a volume license key,\n\n608\n00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:50.970\nwhere I can have this one key activate\nmultiple editions, I could put it here.\n\n609\n00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.050\nOne thing you wanna think about, though,\nis the security of this answer file, then.\n\n610\n00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.745\nBecause somebody can get\nahold of To this answer file,\n\n611\n00:28:55.745 --> 00:28:59.265\nthey might be able to get your product\nkey out of there, and then use that,\n\n612\n00:28:59.265 --> 00:29:01.995\nso one of those things we\ndo have to keep in mind.\n\n613\n00:29:01.995 --> 00:29:02.805\n>> Right.\n>> So I'll go ahead and\n\n614\n00:29:02.805 --> 00:29:04.415\ntype the key in here,\nRonnie, should I do that?\n\n615\n00:29:04.415 --> 00:29:05.655\n>> Yes, we can.\n\n616\n00:29:05.655 --> 00:29:06.665\n>> We're gonna call it out.\n\n617\n00:29:06.665 --> 00:29:08.939\nI'm gonna try to keep up with you here.\n\n618\n00:29:08.939 --> 00:29:13.264\n>> [LAUGH]\nAll right.\n\n619\n00:29:13.264 --> 00:29:16.574\n33PHX7YXKF.\n\n620\n00:29:16.574 --> 00:29:21.479\n2VJC9, and\n\n621\n00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:25.405\nthen dash\n\n622\n00:29:25.405 --> 00:29:30.796\nXBBR8HVTHH.\n\n623\n00:29:30.796 --> 00:29:35.460\nNow you might be wondering, like hey,\nyou just gave away your product key.\n\n624\n00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:35.960\nWell.\n\n625\n00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.430\nKNow what we're using is what we call\ntest keys that are available out there.\n\n626\n00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:40.840\nThese keys are not going\nto allow you to activate,\n\n627\n00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.630\nthey're not going to\nallow you to do anything.\n\n628\n00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.890\nThey will allow you to at least\ninstall the operating system but\n\n629\n00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:50.530\nfrom that point on, they're not\ngoing to be able to be activated.\n\n630\n00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.590\nSo they're really going to\ndo you no good if you think,\n\n631\n00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.890\nI'm going to run this forever now!\n\n632\n00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.000\nAnd now that we've got IT Pro TV's keys,\n\n633\n00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.730\nknow these are actually readily available\nfor Microsoft Tech net side so So\n\n634\n00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.570\nthat's why you're like, wow,\nI can't believe he did that.\n\n635\n00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:02.820\nWell, we did it.\n\n636\n00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.050\n>> Yeah, I'll post that link\na little bit later if you guys want.\n\n637\n00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.030\nIt's actually really good.\n\n638\n00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.670\nSome of these operating systems require\na key just to get past the installation.\n\n639\n00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:10.880\nWhat if you're just doing a test lab?\n\n640\n00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.520\nYou don't really wanna activate it,\nbut you wanna get it installed and\n\n641\n00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.590\nplay around.\n\n642\n00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:18.080\nTech that has a set of keys you\ncan use for just that purpose.\n\n643\n00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.030\nThey won't be activated, but it\ndefinitely get you the product installed.\n\n644\n00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.370\n>> The other option underneath there,\n\n645\n00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:26.810\nwhere it says show UI, well we really only\nwant it to show up if we have an error.\n\n646\n00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.780\nIn other words,\nthat's when we want to be notified.\n\n647\n00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.880\nIf it's installing just fine,\nwe don't want any option to come up and\n\n648\n00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.850\nstop us just so we can look.\n\n649\n00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:39.050\nAnd so that's what we want to do, is make\nsure it actually says on error as well.\n\n650\n00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:39.550\nOkay.\n\n651\n00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.570\nAll right, now, we've actually\ngot two more options that we\n\n652\n00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.840\nwant to take a look at here, which is how\ndo we finish the installation process.\n\n653\n00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.800\nAnd so, this is actually where\nit changes a little bit, and\n\n654\n00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.230\nwhat we are going to do now is actually\nseal up the installation, as well.\n\n655\n00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.857\nSo we're gonna look for\nMicrosoft-Windows-Deployment, and\n\n656\n00:30:58.857 --> 00:30:59.908\nthen \\Reseal.\n\n657\n00:30:59.908 --> 00:31:02.292\nAll right.\n\n658\n00:31:02.292 --> 00:31:07.140\n>> Re-seal and from there,\nonce we get that added in.\n\n659\n00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.780\n>> You know what pass I wanna add that to?\n\n660\n00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.855\n>> This pass is gonna be\nadded in to OOBE system.\n\n661\n00:31:11.855 --> 00:31:13.020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n662\n00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.960\n>> And OOBE stands for\nout of box experience and\n\n663\n00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.370\nthat means\n>> We're about to seal everything up,\n\n664\n00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.680\nif somebody were just to launch that\ncomputer, this is the stuff we're\n\n665\n00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.350\njust finally actually going\nto configure here at the end.\n\n666\n00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:29.460\nAnd on this one we want to actually\nselect, under Force shutdown now\n\n667\n00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:34.420\nis going to fault, and we are going\nto change our mode here to audit.\n\n668\n00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.340\nAt the very beginning.\n\n669\n00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.120\nSo when it boots back up\n>> Should boot into our audit mode.\n\n670\n00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.050\nAnd that's gonna be something we're gonna\ntalk about a little bit later on too.\n\n671\n00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:42.780\n>> All right.\n\n672\n00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.500\n>> Okay.\n\n673\n00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.150\nAnd we have one more option at\nthe very end here that we need.\n\n674\n00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:54.156\nAnd this one is under\nMicrosoft Windows-Shell-Setup.\n\n675\n00:31:54.156 --> 00:31:58.730\nYep, and then O,O,B,E for\nOut Of Box Experience.\n\n676\n00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:02.342\n>> All right, so add that pass seven,\nthat's the only pass available.\n\n677\n00:32:02.342 --> 00:32:06.381\n>> And on this one we want to on\nthe settings there a hide The ULA page,\n\n678\n00:32:06.381 --> 00:32:09.645\ncuz we don't need that to\npop up during our install.\n\n679\n00:32:09.645 --> 00:32:10.727\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n680\n00:32:10.727 --> 00:32:16.061\n>> We also select the protector PC option,\nand we want to change that option to\n\n681\n00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:21.580\nthree, and that's just a different\nlevel of protection for your computer.\n\n682\n00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.140\nIf something happens, it's not gonna\nGo nuts and wipe away everything.\n\n683\n00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.240\nAnd then skip user OOBE.\n\n684\n00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.440\nWant to select that and being true.\n\n685\n00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.970\nIn other words,\nwe don't want all of this to show.\n\n686\n00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:36.080\nWe want it to be as quiet and\nseamless as possible, okay?\n\n687\n00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.570\nAnd that for us is actually gonna be the\nend of all of the options that we have.\n\n688\n00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.700\nNow You have to do all of them.\n\n689\n00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.810\nNo, you don't have to but\nhere is just the basic beginnings.\n\n690\n00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:49.210\nNow can you do this if\nnotepad if you wanted to?\n\n691\n00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.280\nYou can, but it's not recommended.\n\n692\n00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.960\nSo it is trading on the XML file and\nyou can go in there and do that.\n\n693\n00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.470\nBut the recommendation, of course,\n\n694\n00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.630\nis to use this image manager here\nto actually set this answer file.\n\n695\n00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.030\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that protects your PC.\n\n696\n00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:05.850\nIf I remember right, Ronnie,\nthat sets it to check for updates and\n\n697\n00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:06.695\nautomatically download.\n\n698\n00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:08.350\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Those are two different options\n\n699\n00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.970\nthat you can choose in there.\n\n700\n00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:13.000\nSo the last thing we really need to do\nis validate our answer file, right?\n\n701\n00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.620\nWe've gotta make sure That what we\nput in here is correct and accurate.\n\n702\n00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.140\nNow remember, it doesn't really\nknow what you're trying to do.\n\n703\n00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.170\nSo if you forgot one that's not required,\nit's not gonna know that.\n\n704\n00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.590\nBut it will check the format and\nthe structure of your answer file.\n\n705\n00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:32.250\nAll I'm gonna do is come up here and\nchoose Validate Answer File.\n\n706\n00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.340\nClick on that.\n\n707\n00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.930\nAnd I get a couple of errors down here.\n\n708\n00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:39.480\nIt says the key disk id of list\nitem disk must have a value.\n\n709\n00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.760\nSo, good thing we checked that.\n\n710\n00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.940\nWe're gonna find that one.\n\n711\n00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.490\nThat was under, what, [INAUDIBLE] disks.\n\n712\n00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:46.840\nSo, go back here.\n\n713\n00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.030\nNeutral disk configuration disk.\n\n714\n00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:56.130\nDiskID, when we're setting this up,\nwe only have one hard drive in here, so\n\n715\n00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.530\nit's going to be disk 0.\n\n716\n00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.430\nIt needed to know what drive I wanted\nto create those partitions on.\n\n717\n00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:04.410\nWhat if I have more than one drive in\nthere, I mean we could, technically,\n\n718\n00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:09.380\nif we had a second drive,\nI could add another Disk configuration and\n\n719\n00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.350\ndo it disk id one and\nadd more partitions on that.\n\n720\n00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.540\nRemember best practice is when you're\ninstalling the operating system, create\n\n721\n00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.540\nthe partitions you need for the OS, get\nthat done, create additional partitions.\n\n722\n00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.230\nThrough the operating system\nitself once it's installed.\n\n723\n00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.520\nBut the possibilities are there.\n\n724\n00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.740\n>> Yeah, the other option here\nis actually also important too.\n\n725\n00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.160\nRight underneath the disc\nID is will wipe the disc.\n\n726\n00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.120\nWhy is that important, Mike?\n\n727\n00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.250\n>> Well, what if it's already\ngot data on there, right?\n\n728\n00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:33.600\nDo I need to blow that away?\n\n729\n00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.700\nAnd typically, yes, I want to\nwipe the disc and start all over.\n\n730\n00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.450\nThe reason I'm throwing the image down,\nis it's a machine that is brand new,\n\n731\n00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:43.510\nI wanted to wipe the drive and\nput that image on there.\n\n732\n00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.360\nOr the machine's been\ninfected with malware and\n\n733\n00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.860\nI want to wipe that disc and\nput a new image down.\n\n734\n00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.610\nSo, we typically wipe the disc,\nand start all over.\n\n735\n00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.200\nAll right.\n\n736\n00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.670\nSo now, let's see what else.\n\n737\n00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.750\nNow, there's another one down here,\nand you're always gonna get this one.\n\n738\n00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.930\nSkipping that user OOBE is depreciated,\n\n739\n00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.690\nthey don't really want us\nusing that option anymore.\n\n740\n00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.370\nNow we can use it,\nit's just warning me that, hey that option\n\n741\n00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.480\nmight not be available in future\nversions of the system's image manager.\n\n742\n00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.400\nThat might not have that ability.\n\n743\n00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.370\nSo I'll validate it one more time\nto make sure I got that error.\n\n744\n00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:15.760\nAnd now the error's been cleared,\nso we're good to go.\n\n745\n00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.550\nThe next thing I wanna do is\nI wanna save my answer file.\n\n746\n00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.370\nSo we'll click Save.\n\n747\n00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.650\nAnd I'm just gonna dump it right\ninto my documents for now.\n\n748\n00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:24.930\nI'm gonna call it unattend.\n\n749\n00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:29.690\nAnd notice it's gonna be an XML file.\n\n750\n00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:33.110\nI'll go ahead and save that, and\nI know we're getting long on time Ronnie.\n\n751\n00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.460\nBut I do want to show them\nthat file real quick.\n\n752\n00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.950\n>> Sure.\n>> We spent all that time making it.\n\n753\n00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.810\nSo let's bring that guy back up.\n\n754\n00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.060\nSo I forget what it's gonna use for\nX amount here, we'll find out,\n\n755\n00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.150\nprobably internet explorer.\n\n756\n00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.090\n>> You are correct,\nthat's very good, Mike.\n\n757\n00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.930\n>> That's the good old default for\nthat one,\n\n758\n00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:54.630\nwhich means I'm not gonna\nbe able to change a lot.\n\n759\n00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.980\nIn fact,\nI'm gonna show you another way to do that.\n\n760\n00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.430\nLet's open that up with notepad this time.\n\n761\n00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.010\nAs what I was saying, I mean we could\ncreate this answer file from scratch.\n\n762\n00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.370\nIt's just an XML document.\n\n763\n00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:10.020\nI could open up Notepad or any other XML\neditor and I could type all this out.\n\n764\n00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.780\nBut would I know the format,\nall the different tags that are involved,\n\n765\n00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.460\nbecause as you can see,\nXML very similar to HTML.\n\n766\n00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:21.840\nI've got my tag language I don't\nremember all that stuff, I don't know.\n\n767\n00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.480\nSo I'm gonna use Systems Image Manager\nto create the answer file.\n\n768\n00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.770\nNow, once it's created, if I ever have\nto go back and change it, maybe I don't\n\n769\n00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:33.140\nfeel like firing up Windows System\nImage Manager and loading all that up.\n\n770\n00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.110\nBecause it's an XML file, I could come\nin here and I could change values.\n\n771\n00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:42.540\nI can see that this is NTFS, or that And\nit's putting it on partition two.\n\n772\n00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.160\nIf I need to modify some of those values,\nnothing wrong with coming in here with\n\n773\n00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.490\nNotepad or some XML editor and\nmaking changes to values and saving it.\n\n774\n00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:53.280\nJust understand too, though,\nyou won't have that validation capability.\n\n775\n00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.240\nThat is one nice thing about\nusing system image manager.\n\n776\n00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.320\nTo create that.\n\n777\n00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.910\nSo, Ronnie that gives us our answer file,\n\n778\n00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:04.100\nthe next step I think is going to be to\nactually set up our reference machine.\n\n779\n00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.380\n>> Yeah.\n>> And get ready to use that, but\n\n780\n00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.890\nall that's gonna come in a later episode.\n\n781\n00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:08.930\n>> Right.\n\n782\n00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.940\nSo that's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n783\n00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.800\nHope you guys enjoyed watching this show,\n\n784\n00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.680\ncreating our answer file to start our\nunattended installation of Windows 7.\n\n785\n00:37:17.680 -->

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.844\nI'm you host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:20.164\njoining me today on the show is\nnone other than Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:20.164 --> 00:00:21.440\nHow's it going today, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.480\n>> It's going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.750\nIt's another great day to be right here.\n\n9\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.610\nContinuing on tech,\nwe got supporting Windows 7.\n\n10\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.970\nAnd what we wanna do here is make sure\nthat we understand that this is not really\n\n11\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.040\nan exam focused type of show.\n\n12\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.900\nIt's more about just saying, hey,\nhere are the things that we encounter as\n\n13\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.020\nsupport technicians for\na Windows 7 environment.\n\n14\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.230\nEspecially when you're dealing with it in\na corporate environment a lot of times,\n\n15\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.930\nand then we're focusing\nin on image creation.\n\n16\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.420\nAnd so a lot of times this is\nwhere it gets a little bit tricky,\n\n17\n00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.530\nespecially when you have to work\nwith technicians that might not\n\n18\n00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.810\nhave an understanding of how\nto actually create an image.\n\n19\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.645\nNow Daniel, you and I came from the days\nof Windows XP where image creation was\n\n20\n00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:00.545\na lot different than the way it\nis in the days of Windows 7.\n\n21\n00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.999\nAnd so when you still hold\non to those same ideas, and\n\n22\n00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.319\nthose same principles, it still works and\nthe overall process or\n\n23\n00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:12.242\nthe result is the same, but\nit is a little bit more complex,\n\n24\n00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:16.580\nat least from my standpoint of what\nhas to go on inside Windows 7.\n\n25\n00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.280\nAnd the reason why is because we\nhad tools Daniel, like, all right,\n\n26\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340\nwe're gonna image this machine.\n\n27\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.670\nAnd just run it.\n\n28\n00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.610\nAnd then it was done.\n\n29\n00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.980\nAnd then you could deploy the image and\nit was right away.\n\n30\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.380\nAnd then Windows 7 or\neven Vista came along.\n\n31\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.930\nAnd I was like, oh no, this is not\nworking that exact way anymore.\n\n32\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.280\nAnd then we had to learn how to\nactually to do it the other way.\n\n33\n00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.960\nAnd so there are a lot of little\nprocesses that can trip us up.\n\n34\n00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.950\nAnd what we wanna go through today is just\nactually emphasize some of those main\n\n35\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.250\npoints so that we can actually understand\nthat process of creating a good image for\n\n36\n00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.768\nour environment.\n\n37\n00:01:48.768 --> 00:01:52.480\n>> Yeah and Ronnie makes a great point, we\nboth have used third party utilities for\n\n38\n00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.480\ncreating images of machines,\nand they work fantastic.\n\n39\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.090\nThey are wonderful things.\n\n40\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.030\nAnd you know what, Ronnie?\n\n41\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.390\nI never really got away from them-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n42\n00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.460\n>> To be honest with you,\n\n43\n00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.870\nbecause they were so good, but\nMicrosoft said hey, you know what?\n\n44\n00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.440\nIf they can do it,\nif they can provide that service for\n\n45\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.400\nour users, we can do that as well.\n\n46\n00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.700\nAnd that's exactly what they have done.\n\n47\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.810\nThey said we're not gonna\nleave you out there,\n\n48\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.820\nmake you have to go get\nsome third party tool.\n\n49\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.190\nIf you need to have this happen and you've\nalready purchased a Windows license,\n\n50\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.820\nwhy not just have that built into\nthe operating system itself?\n\n51\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.010\nAnd you can create those images,\nmaking deployment a whole lot easier.\n\n52\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.830\nNow, you do have to learn\ntheir way of doing things.\n\n53\n00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.830\nBecause obviously they just couldn't\nsnatch somebody's ideas up, and\n\n54\n00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.450\nall their terminology and nomenclature,\nand go, hey, it's Windows now, you know?\n\n55\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.620\nThat's not how it works.\n\n56\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.905\nThat's how you find yourself in\na courtroom really, really quickly.\n\n57\n00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:40.420\n[LAUGH] And they've already\nhad their fair share of that.\n\n58\n00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.550\nSo we do have to figure out\nhow does Windows do that,\n\n59\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.300\nhow does Microsoft want\nus to make this happen?\n\n60\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.910\nRonnie, you have finally\nsuccessfully learned how to do this.\n\n61\n00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.450\n>> Yeah, it took me a little while.\n\n62\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.419\n>> It did [LAUGH].\n\n63\n00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.875\n>> About ten years and then I'm fine.\n\n64\n00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:53.406\n>> That's all.\n\n65\n00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.785\n>> No, yeah, we started learning\nabout it right away, and\n\n66\n00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:59.070\nthe reason why is that there are some\nadvantages to doing it the Windows 7 way.\n\n67\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.275\nThe way that we used to do it with\nthird party utilities, fine, it works,\n\n68\n00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:03.760\nexactly what Daniel says.\n\n69\n00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.940\nYou take a hard and\nwhat we make with images,\n\n70\n00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.490\na sector by sector copy of that hard\ndrive, and we store it as a file.\n\n71\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.240\nAnd then when you actually go and\ndeploy it,\n\n72\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.610\nwhat happens is you take that image and\nyou deploy it back, sector by sector,\n\n73\n00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.020\nback down on the new hard drive, so it\nactually matches exactly the same thing.\n\n74\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.260\nThe limitations with that, though,\nand this is where Daniel and\n\n75\n00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.120\nI probably got frustrated, right?\n\n76\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.727\nThe very fact is, Daniel, did you have\nto keep an image for like your GX-240s?\n\n77\n00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:30.538\nDid you have to keep one for your 380s?\n\n78\n00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:33.470\nDid you have to keep one for\nyour 745s and different ones?\n\n79\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.450\n>> I did, I did,\nwe'd have a whole farm of computers\n\n80\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.787\njust making sure they keep update that-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:03:38.787 --> 00:03:39.504\n>> So we can make new images at\n\n82\n00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:40.320\nleast once a week.\n\n83\n00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.090\nAnd then you've got to\nstore all those files,\n\n84\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.490\nand I don't know if you've ever tried to\ntake an image of a computer before, but\n\n85\n00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.210\nthey can tend to be a little large,\nin the gigs of range.\n\n86\n00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.470\nYou got 10 or 20 computers you're trying\nto maintain, that's a lot of storage.\n\n87\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.300\n>> It's a lot of storage and\nwhat we're also ending up doing,\n\n88\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.320\nright, is we're actually\nkeeping most copies.\n\n89\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.096\nSo even between somewhat, let me kind\nof give Daniel a reference here,\n\n90\n00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:03.288\nbecause Daniel probably has\ndealt with the same thing.\n\n91\n00:04:03.288 --> 00:04:08.473\nWe had 740s, Dell 740s, we had Dell\n745s doing the process that you and\n\n92\n00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:14.100\nI would have come up with, we would have\nactually had two actual separate images.\n\n93\n00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.700\nEach one of those could've been 45 gigs,\ncould've 20 gigs, whatever it was, but\n\n94\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.070\nthe majority of those,\nthey were actually identical files.\n\n95\n00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.180\nThe differences were\nreally the drivers and\n\n96\n00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.630\nthe way that the hardware\nwas set up there.\n\n97\n00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.510\nBut that's because they actually had\ntheir HOW embedded into the image.\n\n98\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.140\nThe very fact that it locked itself and\n\n99\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.500\ncreated that lock into that machine,\nwell that's where some of the issues were.\n\n100\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.880\nWell beginning with Vista and carrying\non through Windows 7 they said look,\n\n101\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.420\nhere is what we want to do instead.\n\n102\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.720\nWe want to create what we call HOW\nindependence with our imaging process.\n\n103\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.470\nAnd the way that they do that\nis they take just a basic,\n\n104\n00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.770\nmost base machine that they can.\n\n105\n00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.560\nAnd they go ahead and they install the\noperating system the way that they wanted\n\n106\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.150\nto, to make sure that it worked completely\nand then they took an image of that and\n\n107\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.620\nwhat they send out now as\npart of the installation\n\n108\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.590\nis not all the files that have to\nactually be assembled onto your computer.\n\n109\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.930\nBut actually have a working image, in\nother words, one that already works, and\n\n110\n00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.210\nthey compress it all the way down,\nthey put that on the DVD.\n\n111\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.840\nWhen you go and load that into your\nmachine, well what it's doing is just\n\n112\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.040\npicking that DVD and saying, all right\nwe're taking this image we're expanding\n\n113\n00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.500\nit out on that machine and then it can\ngenerate and lock itself in at that point.\n\n114\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.250\nSo we're not actually taking\nall the stuff from one machine.\n\n115\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.030\nWe're actually saying we'll just take\nthe base files that work together, and\n\n116\n00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.580\nthen we're gonna compress it down.\n\n117\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.230\nAnd so everything that you're doing\nwhen you're actually installing\n\n118\n00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.930\nis you're actually doing\nthe imaging process.\n\n119\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.690\nThat's what you're doing.\n\n120\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.620\nBut you're just doing it from a DVD, and\n\n121\n00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.960\nit's just laying it all\nback down out there.\n\n122\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.380\nAnd then it starts saying all right,\nlet's lock ourselves in.\n\n123\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.570\nLet's do all the stuff that we need to do.\n\n124\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.440\nThe advantage of this is now\nwe have a single instance.\n\n125\n00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.050\nOkay?\n\n126\n00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.000\nSo even if I have multiple versions of\nWindows, right, there's Enterprise,\n\n127\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.040\nthere's Ultimate, there's Home,\nthere's Home Premium, there's so\n\n128\n00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.040\nmany different ones that\nare actually out there.\n\n129\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.460\nWell, even on that DVD it all actually\nonly has to be stored one time.\n\n130\n00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.400\nWe can have multiple images.\n\n131\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.000\nI know this is where\nthe terminology got me confused.\n\n132\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.331\nMultiple images, the Windows Ultimate,\nthe Enterprise, Windows 7 didn't have\n\n133\n00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:15.692\nthe business, the Pro, or\nwhatever edition it might have been.\n\n134\n00:06:15.692 --> 00:06:18.153\n>> It was Pro.\n\n135\n00:06:18.153 --> 00:06:20.000\n>> All that can actually be stored.\n\n136\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.630\nBut they're all actually\nusing one single source file.\n\n137\n00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.630\nAnd then when you actually go and\npull that down, it's just says all right,\n\n138\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.050\nthis image here is just\npointing at all those files.\n\n139\n00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.210\nI need those files to come with me\nwhen I install on this hard drive.\n\n140\n00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.800\nSo unlike the way that\nwe would have done it,\n\n141\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.300\nwhich was a sector by sector copy,\nWindows 7 and Vista, and\n\n142\n00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.240\nI still refer to Vista because\nthat's where it kind of originated.\n\n143\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.540\nBut Windows 7 really does, it actually\ndoes a file by file copy instead,\n\n144\n00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.480\ncuz that's all it's doing.\n\n145\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.910\nIt's actually copying those files down and\nputting it down onto your disk.\n\n146\n00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.304\nAnd so now what you can do, and\nthis is where I found it the neatest thing\n\n147\n00:06:52.304 --> 00:06:55.897\nin the world, is I actually\nonly had to create one image.\n\n148\n00:06:55.897 --> 00:06:59.915\nAnd with that one image Daniel,\nI was actually able to do the,\n\n149\n00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:05.109\nI was able to re-image the 740s,\nthe 745s, our 960s, our 980s.\n\n150\n00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:08.620\nThe image carried on through,\nand that was one image.\n\n151\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.700\nI was even able to take that\nWindows 7 image that I had and\n\n152\n00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.440\nput it on a little Netbook one time.\n\n153\n00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.310\n>> Wow, that's impressive.\n\n154\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.370\n>> Yeah, it is impressive because\nit's not keeping, what, five or\n\n155\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.880\nsix different images-\n>> Reducing that storage.\n\n156\n00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.530\n>> Reducing the storage,\nmaking it fairly streamlined, and\n\n157\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.480\nit's not locked down to\nonly one machine anymore.\n\n158\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.790\nThat's why we want to actually be\nable to do something like this.\n\n159\n00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.860\nSo this is where it does\nget a little bit confusing.\n\n160\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.613\nSo the first thing that we want to do is\nmake sure you understand what the image\n\n161\n00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:34.210\nactually is.\n\n162\n00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.300\nSo let's go ahead and show you that.\n\n163\n00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.170\nSo, when we start talking about it,\nwe actually need to be able to,\n\n164\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.135\nif we're going to talk about image\ncreation, so we can deploy it later on,\n\n165\n00:07:42.135 --> 00:07:45.620\nis we'll actually wanna make\nsure that we can see that.\n\n166\n00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.446\nSo I'm just gonna click on Explore and\nI went ahead and mounted up the DVD for\n\n167\n00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:52.066\nthe Windows 7 install.\n\n168\n00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:54.026\nNow you might think that, hey,\nthis is what we have to do.\n\n169\n00:07:54.026 --> 00:07:56.792\nWe have to copy all these files\nto every individual machine, and\n\n170\n00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:58.287\nthen we'll be off and ready to go.\n\n171\n00:07:58.287 --> 00:08:03.026\nBut really the only thing that we need is\nif I go into the sources folder and inside\n\n172\n00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:07.930\nthe sources, if I scroll down in this\nlist, I'm looking for this one right here.\n\n173\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.761\nIt's called install.wim.\n\n174\n00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:14.500\nAnd there it is,\nit's about three gigs in size, and\n\n175\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.940\nif I'm gonna create an image from there,\nthat's really all I need.\n\n176\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.630\nI could just copy this thing right here.\n\n177\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.260\nAnd I'm just gonna put this into a folder,\nand\n\n178\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.390\nI might have already done this earlier.\n\n179\n00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.131\nI can't remember, I think I did here.\n\n180\n00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:27.752\nThere it is, image.\n\n181\n00:08:27.752 --> 00:08:29.092\nAnd so you actually see it right there.\n\n182\n00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.098\nI went ahead, and there it is.\n\n183\n00:08:31.098 --> 00:08:34.886\nSo I've copied it in here and\nthere's another file that you'll also\n\n184\n00:08:34.886 --> 00:08:37.578\nsee right here called this\ncatalog file as well.\n\n185\n00:08:37.578 --> 00:08:41.588\nAnd that's actually something a little bit\ndifferent that really is kind of a pointer\n\n186\n00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:43.482\nto everything that we need to that says,\n\n187\n00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:46.360\nhey this is a Windows 7\nEnterprise image as well.\n\n188\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.870\nSo we can pull that off\nthe DVD if we need too.\n\n189\n00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.650\nThis one was actually created for me.\n\n190\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.370\nSo if I go ahead and\njust delete this thing for\n\n191\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.730\nright now,\nthat's perfectly fine I can do that.\n\n192\n00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.100\nAnd that's what would have\nactually been copied up.\n\n193\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.510\nSo when we have something like this,\n\n194\n00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.600\nwe need that file and we need to\ncopy it to the local hard drive.\n\n195\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.784\nA lot of people make the mistake when\nthey start talking about creating image,\n\n196\n00:09:04.784 --> 00:09:06.096\nis that they just put the DVD in.\n\n197\n00:09:06.096 --> 00:09:10.345\nAnd then from that point they try and\nwork with it directly off the DVD.\n\n198\n00:09:10.345 --> 00:09:12.045\nAnd not saying you can't do that, but\n\n199\n00:09:12.045 --> 00:09:14.885\nit makes it a little bit more complicated,\njust make a test folder and\n\n200\n00:09:14.885 --> 00:09:16.925\ncopy it in there is what you\nwanna do at the beginning.\n\n201\n00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:20.480\nNow once you have that, and\nwhen you start creating an image,\n\n202\n00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.630\nyou now wanna actually go through and\nadd in what we call an answer file.\n\n203\n00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.500\nNow the answer file's a little but\ntricky here,\n\n204\n00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.490\nbecause can you actually make one\nusing Notepad if you wanted to?\n\n205\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.310\nYou better believe it.\n\n206\n00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.860\nYou can, so how do you go about doing it?\n\n207\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.508\nYou don't use Notepad.\n\n208\n00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:37.347\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so it's just a XML file, so\n\n209\n00:09:37.347 --> 00:09:41.137\nyou can actually do that but\nis is a complex type of thing.\n\n210\n00:09:41.137 --> 00:09:44.663\nAnd so it's not something you wanna\nactually just go I'm gonna just do\n\n211\n00:09:44.663 --> 00:09:46.870\nthis and do that and make it work.\n\n212\n00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.880\nThere is a tool that you can get,\nand this is the second key as well.\n\n213\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.690\nSo know what file that you\nneed to work with, and\n\n214\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.570\nthat's key when you're\nactually creating an image.\n\n215\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.560\nSo select that install.wim.\n\n216\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.980\nSecondly, get the right tools to do so.\n\n217\n00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.308\nThere's what we call the Windows 7 AIK.\n\n218\n00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:06.099\nSo this stands for\nthe Automated Installation Kit.\n\n219\n00:10:06.099 --> 00:10:09.468\nSo if I type in Windows 7 AIK, oops.\n\n220\n00:10:09.468 --> 00:10:17.046\n[LAUGH] Windows 7 AIK, and do download.\n\n221\n00:10:17.046 --> 00:10:19.210\n>> After IE hijacks your computer.\n\n222\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.223\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n223\n00:10:20.223 --> 00:10:21.472\nhijacks everything that I do here.\n\n224\n00:10:21.472 --> 00:10:26.300\nYou'll notice that there is a download\nfrom the official Microsoft site here and\n\n225\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.009\nthis is the one that you want,\nis right here.\n\n226\n00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:31.409\nSo this will actually allow\nyou to install it but\n\n227\n00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:34.150\nthis is where we also\nhave an issue as well.\n\n228\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.780\nThe reason why is that this one\nwas designed for Windows 7.\n\n229\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.810\nBut not for\nWindows 7 with service pack one.\n\n230\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.757\nSo when you start doing this and\nyou need to work with it, if your disk and\n\n231\n00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:50.540\nif your win file came off of\nan installation disk that was with service\n\n232\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.426\npack one, and this one is,\nI can see by the name up here.\n\n233\n00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:58.217\nIt says, GSP and SP1.\n\n234\n00:10:58.217 --> 00:11:01.995\nSo you actually see that there it says,\nGS and then that one I know that this is\n\n235\n00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:05.390\na Windows 7 disk that was\nactually a service pack one.\n\n236\n00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.650\nYou still need to download this and\ninstall it on to your Windows 7 machine.\n\n237\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:17.260\nBut then let me see if I go ahead and\ntype in Windows 7 sp1, download.\n\n238\n00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.190\nYou'll notice that there\nis a second link over here.\n\n239\n00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.911\nAnd this is, oh that is actually not\nthe official one the site I was on,\n\n240\n00:11:24.911 --> 00:11:25.849\nwait here it is.\n\n241\n00:11:25.849 --> 00:11:27.780\nIt should be here.\n\n242\n00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.320\nI'm lying to you.\n\n243\n00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.800\nIt's pretty much right\nnear the same page here.\n\n244\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.932\nSo if I take a look here maybe\nI can see the SP1 as well.\n\n245\n00:11:35.932 --> 00:11:37.530\nOf course, I don't find it right now.\n\n246\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.430\nBut there is actually one that is for\nthe SP1.\n\n247\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.205\nOh, there it is!\n\n248\n00:11:40.205 --> 00:11:41.331\nSupplemental.\nI was at the right one.\n\n249\n00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:42.236\n>> [LAUGH] You are there, Ryan!\n\n250\n00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:43.211\n>> I was looking there.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n251\n00:11:43.211 --> 00:11:43.977\n>> Yeah, I just can't read.\n\n252\n00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:45.765\nThat's a fault of mine.\n\n253\n00:11:45.765 --> 00:11:48.875\nYou download this and you'll notice\nit's still another 1.3 gigs, so\n\n254\n00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.650\nyou're actually downloading\n3 gigs altogether.\n\n255\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.420\nThe first one will install.\n\n256\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.970\nThis one will open up files.\n\n257\n00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.610\nAnd all you have to do is copy this\ninto a location called PE Tools and\n\n258\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:04.150\nthat will overwrite the original files for\nthe Windows 7 Installation Kit.\n\n259\n00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.051\nWhen you install that onto your machine\nthen what will end up happening\n\n260\n00:12:09.051 --> 00:12:13.556\nis that you will get a folder that says,\nMicrosoft Windows AIK.\n\n261\n00:12:13.556 --> 00:12:16.820\nAnd that will give you\nthese three tools here.\n\n262\n00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.510\nThe deployment tools command prompt,\nthe system image manager and\n\n263\n00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.990\nof course the VAMT, which stands for\nVolume Activation Management Tool.\n\n264\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.470\nThe one that we're looking for\nis the System Image Manager.\n\n265\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.850\nThat System Image Manager then is how\nwe can create what we call of course,\n\n266\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:33.970\nan answer file.\n\n267\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.845\nAn answer file is very important because\nit really does allow us to be able to\n\n268\n00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:42.205\nsay hey, here's what we want to actually\ngo ahead and answer and do all this stuff.\n\n269\n00:12:42.205 --> 00:12:45.395\nSo we can set it up to where it\nwill domain join if it wants to.\n\n270\n00:12:45.395 --> 00:12:48.195\nWe can tell it we want it to\npartition the hard drive.\n\n271\n00:12:48.195 --> 00:12:50.765\nWe can actually set what the language is.\n\n272\n00:12:50.765 --> 00:12:53.423\nYou name it,\nthere's a ton of stuff that you can do.\n\n273\n00:12:53.423 --> 00:12:56.573\nRight here it's saying, hey there's\nnot a catalog file for right now, so\n\n274\n00:12:56.573 --> 00:12:59.590\nI'm going to go ahead and say,\nyes and let it create it.\n\n275\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.470\nAnd in a moment, it will actually\ngenerate a catalog file, and we'll see it\n\n276\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.550\nactually populate over here in the lower\nleft hand corner on the image itself.\n\n277\n00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.290\nSo we can also end up doing that.\n\n278\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.840\nNow, the way that we\ncreate this answer file\n\n279\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.120\nis that once everything's actually done\nup here in the answer file category,\n\n280\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.930\nwe'll actually right-click on it\ntell it to create a new answer file.\n\n281\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.460\nAnd that will create kind\nof a backbone structure.\n\n282\n00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.288\nAnd then we can go through all those\nthings that will be listed in the lower\n\n283\n00:13:25.288 --> 00:13:26.500\nleft hand corner.\n\n284\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.320\nTo add in those components.\n\n285\n00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.890\nAnd then over here in the properties,\n\n286\n00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:34.330\nwe'll actually have to manually type in\nstuff to fill that in what we want to now.\n\n287\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.160\nWe're not taking the whole show and\ngoing through each of these.\n\n288\n00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.303\nBut this is the process, and\nthat's what I wanted you to actually see.\n\n289\n00:13:40.303 --> 00:13:43.251\nSo when somebody says oh no,\nwe can just create an answer file well,\n\n290\n00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:44.630\nthis is how you have to do it.\n\n291\n00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.004\nYou have to actually kind of go through\nthis process, and it has to create that.\n\n292\n00:13:48.004 --> 00:13:50.560\nAnd that's what it's doing,\nit's generating that catalog file.\n\n293\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.450\nSo it takes a little bit of time here.\n\n294\n00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.440\nAnd once it's generated and then you go\nand I would, I would just search online.\n\n295\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.240\nAnd to see somebody that's actually\ngiving you the example answer files, and\n\n296\n00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.320\ncopy their steps and\nsee if it actually applies to you.\n\n297\n00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.216\nOnce everything is done\nthere's two key steps here.\n\n298\n00:14:06.216 --> 00:14:09.652\nOnce you're actually finished filling out\nall that stuff there's a button up here at\n\n299\n00:14:09.652 --> 00:14:12.455\nthe top that allows you to\nvalidate that answer file.\n\n300\n00:14:12.455 --> 00:14:14.595\nThe key is you're looking for\nwhere it says,\n\n301\n00:14:14.595 --> 00:14:16.972\nerrors and\nif there's an error you have to fix it.\n\n302\n00:14:16.972 --> 00:14:20.145\nIf there's warnings,\nyou don't have to fix warnings.\n\n303\n00:14:20.145 --> 00:14:22.415\nSo you can kind of cheat here.\n\n304\n00:14:22.415 --> 00:14:25.425\nEverybody gets worried about the warnings\nlike oh no, I'm doing something wrong.\n\n305\n00:14:25.425 --> 00:14:29.065\nA lot of times the warnings are because\nthere's a lot of different things that no\n\n306\n00:14:29.065 --> 00:14:32.760\nlonger apply to Windows 7 anymore that\nthey actually developed in this stuff and\n\n307\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.467\nthen oh yeah, that's deprecated.\n\n308\n00:14:34.467 --> 00:14:37.817\nAnd you'll see that term when you look at\nthe description a lot of times here, but\n\n309\n00:14:37.817 --> 00:14:40.872\nthen you have to save this to a location\nthat you know that you're actually\n\n310\n00:14:40.872 --> 00:14:41.430\ngonna find.\n\n311\n00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.090\nAnd that's another key.\n\n312\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.930\nNow while this is\nfinished generating here,\n\n313\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.330\nI wanna show you a copy\nof the answer file.\n\n314\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.510\nSo I went ahead and\nmade one a little bit earlier.\n\n315\n00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.960\nSo I'm going to see if I open this up.\n\n316\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.040\nSee what it looks like here.\n\n317\n00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.050\nAnd it should be able\nto open up right here.\n\n318\n00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.720\nAnd so, Daniel does this look like it's\ngonna be fun typing if you tried to do\n\n319\n00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.580\nthis in like Notepad?\n\n320\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.128\n>> You could probably get that\ndone in a good five minutes.\n\n321\n00:15:06.128 --> 00:15:06.926\nThat's just-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:07.971\n>> A lot of texts, Ronnie.\n\n323\n00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:12.588\nAnd you've got brackets and\nall sorts of crazy characters.\n\n324\n00:15:12.588 --> 00:15:14.180\nI don't speak that language.\n\n325\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:14.928\n>> Yeah-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:15:14.928 --> 00:15:15.600\n>> Yeah.\n\n327\n00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.720\nThis is basic XML.\n\n328\n00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.380\nSo you can actually just use Notepad and\ndo that.\n\n329\n00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.463\nNow I opened it up in\na browser cuz that's fine.\n\n330\n00:15:20.463 --> 00:15:25.770\nAnd you might go Ronnie, you're showing\nyour Windows 7 Key there, are you nuts?\n\n331\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.630\nThat's exactly right.\n\n332\n00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.770\nYou don't want this\nthing getting out there.\n\n333\n00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.450\nAnd you're like Ronnie,\nyou're not showing a good job of it.\n\n334\n00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.980\nThis key is actually\nsomething you can have it.\n\n335\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.140\nIt's no big deal.\n\n336\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.808\nIt will only allow you to act\nto be able to install Windows 7.\n\n337\n00:15:36.808 --> 00:15:39.497\nIt doesn't allow you to activate or\ndo anything else with it.\n\n338\n00:15:39.497 --> 00:15:43.037\nSo Microsoft has it out there for you so\nthis just one that actually is for\n\n339\n00:15:43.037 --> 00:15:46.224\nthings like demonstrations and\njust for temporary usage just so\n\n340\n00:15:46.224 --> 00:15:48.700\nyou can get Windows 7 installed on there.\n\n341\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.270\nAnd that's why I also have in there.\n\n342\n00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.727\nNotice that you can actually put that in\nwithout having to stop and type it in.\n\n343\n00:15:54.727 --> 00:15:55.752\nSo there's a lot of other things.\n\n344\n00:15:55.752 --> 00:15:59.611\nThere's my domain password and all that\nstuff that I have for this image And\n\n345\n00:15:59.611 --> 00:16:02.244\nI even set up the home page here and\nstuff like that so\n\n346\n00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:04.815\nthat if Internet Explorer\nactually is out there,\n\n347\n00:16:04.815 --> 00:16:08.730\nit should actually automatically go and\nthat's my new home page.\n\n348\n00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.780\nI just set up just a couple of things so\nthat we could see that.\n\n349\n00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.460\nSo in the end when everything\nends up generating,\n\n350\n00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.220\nyou wanna save that file to a location.\n\n351\n00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.290\nBecause that is actually what you will\nuse to actually create your overall image\n\n352\n00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.530\nin the end.\n\n353\n00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.640\nSo here it is,\nhere's a part of that creation.\n\n354\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.160\nOnce we're done,\nthis is where you can go in there, and\n\n355\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.190\nthen you can select some of these\ndifferent ones that are out here.\n\n356\n00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.910\nAnd you will kind of have to play around\nwith these to know what's out there.\n\n357\n00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.230\nAnd then you expand some of these things\nout and then you can keep expanding it.\n\n358\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.770\nAnd then you can add it in by right-click,\nand\n\n359\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.060\ntell it to add it in to\nthe different passes.\n\n360\n00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.200\nSo Windows actually goes through multiple\npasses before it actually installs, and\n\n361\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.270\nit installs a little piece of\ninformation with each pass.\n\n362\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:55.560\nAnd this is where you go in, and then out\nhere you add in some numbers, the size.\n\n363\n00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.397\nAnd this is where it also gets tricky, and\n\n364\n00:16:57.397 --> 00:17:00.088\nthis is why you don't want to\nactually just do this on a whim.\n\n365\n00:17:00.088 --> 00:17:03.830\nThis size right here is how I\ngot tripped up the first time.\n\n366\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.365\nCuz I was sitting there going, all right,\nI want to make a 60 gig hard drive so\n\n367\n00:17:06.365 --> 00:17:07.260\nwhat do I type in, Daniel?\n\n368\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.180\n>> 60 gigs.\n\n369\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.277\n>> 60 gigs, okay, and then when you just\ntype in 60 you think now that's it because\n\n370\n00:17:12.277 --> 00:17:14.640\nthat's what you and I think about.\n\n371\n00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.550\nWell, it took a little\nwhile before I caught on.\n\n372\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.180\nThey're doing this in megabytes.\n\n373\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.780\n>> Oh.\n>> So\n\n374\n00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.080\nthis is how old this particular\nsystem's been around.\n\n375\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.140\nIs that the original programming for\nit says, no just report it in megabytes.\n\n376\n00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.609\nSo every time I tried to\ninstall a Windows 7 image,\n\n377\n00:17:28.609 --> 00:17:32.580\nI was trying [LAUGH] to install it onto a\n60 megabyte hard drive and it was failing.\n\n378\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.270\nI don't know why, Daniel.\n\n379\n00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.858\n>> Yeah,\nI couldn't imagine why that would happen\n\n380\n00:17:33.858 --> 00:17:35.065\n>> Yeah, I mean, why would it fail on a-\n\n381\n00:17:35.065 --> 00:17:35.646\n>> Doesn't make sense.\n\n382\n00:17:35.646 --> 00:17:36.714\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n383\n00:17:36.714 --> 00:17:38.564\n>> So you do have to pay attention, and\n\n384\n00:17:38.564 --> 00:17:42.518\nif you're ever not sure, remember that\nthere's always a help file that's\n\n385\n00:17:42.518 --> 00:17:46.550\nright there for you to take a look\nat those things as well, all right.\n\n386\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.180\nSo once all that's done, you just simply\n\n387\n00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.510\nrun through the check marks to validate\nyour answers, and there it is.\n\n388\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:58.880\nThe key disk ID of an item,\nactually is supposed to have a value.\n\n389\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.170\nSo it's saying that that's missing and\n\n390\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.710\nthat means I have to go and\nfix that if I wanted to use that.\n\n391\n00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.500\nBut I've already save our answer file, so\nI'm not gonna worry about saving this one.\n\n392\n00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.760\nSo you need that answer file if you are\ngoing to make sure that you create this.\n\n393\n00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.840\nNow, once you save the answer file,\n\n394\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.000\nthere's a couple of different\nnames that you can save under.\n\n395\n00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.920\nI save mine as what we call autounattend.\n\n396\n00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.830\nThere's also one that you can\nactually save as unattend as well.\n\n397\n00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.318\nAnd those are key words inside of Windows.\n\n398\n00:18:24.318 --> 00:18:29.124\nAutounattend means look, take all\nthe answers that I would normally have to\n\n399\n00:18:29.124 --> 00:18:33.644\nstop and type in and as it installs,\nmake sure you add all that stuff in.\n\n400\n00:18:33.644 --> 00:18:36.510\nAnd that's the way that I think we\nshould actually end up working.\n\n401\n00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.050\nBut if you are also gonna be\nworking with a deployment sever,\n\n402\n00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.620\nthe term that you also want\nis what we call unattend.\n\n403\n00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.941\nThis terminology has changed over time.\n\n404\n00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:45.632\nSo the old one used to be autounattend and\n\n405\n00:18:45.632 --> 00:18:49.540\nthat's why I still typed it that way cuz I\nremember doing this in the days of Vista.\n\n406\n00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.420\nAnd so the new unattend is\na little bit harder for\n\n407\n00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.920\nme to generate when I start\ntyping this stuff in.\n\n408\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.310\nSo you want to make sure that you\nactually do name it that way, okay?\n\n409\n00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.830\nNow, once you have that,\n\n410\n00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.890\nnow you actually can do a couple\nof different things, right?\n\n411\n00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.190\nSo you now understand what the image is,\n\n412\n00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.900\nyou understand that that answer\nfile is actually important now.\n\n413\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.000\nDo you have to have an answer file?\n\n414\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.010\nNot necessarily.\n\n415\n00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.152\nIn a corporate environment though,\nif you actually are going to add in\n\n416\n00:19:17.152 --> 00:19:20.788\nthings like your product key without you\nhaving to stop and do it, yeah you will.\n\n417\n00:19:20.788 --> 00:19:24.319\nIf for nothing else, at least that will\nactually install your product key for\n\n418\n00:19:24.319 --> 00:19:26.727\nyou and you don't have to\nworry about it after that.\n\n419\n00:19:26.727 --> 00:19:29.445\nBut you will have to generate an answer\nfile to make sure that that works if\n\n420\n00:19:29.445 --> 00:19:31.382\nyou're doing that too.\n\n421\n00:19:31.382 --> 00:19:32.480\nAll right so\n\n422\n00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.390\nonce that's done, we do have to actually\nnow take a look at something else.\n\n423\n00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.300\nOnce you get that you can\nbuild your reference image,\n\n424\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.380\nwhich means the image that you're actually\ngonna capture, your machine that you want\n\n425\n00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.390\nto deploy to everybody else,\nto clone from everybody else.\n\n426\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.760\nAnd you can also build\nwhat we call a PE disk.\n\n427\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.360\nIf you don't have a deployment\nserver on premises, in hand, well,\n\n428\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.960\nyou're gonna actually\nhave to do this manually.\n\n429\n00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.050\nSo if you don't have that,\n\n430\n00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:04.910\nif you're saying deployment server, that\nis a new term, that means nothing to me.\n\n431\n00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.881\nWell, that means that what you have to do\nnow is build what we call a Windows PE\n\n432\n00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:12.191\ndisk, which stands for\nthe pre-installation environment.\n\n433\n00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:15.984\nAnd that simply launches up Windows\n7 in a command line utility.\n\n434\n00:20:15.984 --> 00:20:18.703\nAnd now that means you have to\nactually have to type in all of\n\n435\n00:20:18.703 --> 00:20:21.604\nthe commands to be able to actually\ndo all of the other things.\n\n436\n00:20:21.604 --> 00:20:26.122\nAnd this is where you will have to learn\nabout the commands like ImageX to do so,\n\n437\n00:20:26.122 --> 00:20:29.757\nand capturing ImageX and\napplying ImageX to be able to do that.\n\n438\n00:20:29.757 --> 00:20:34.540\nTo build that is a little bit beyond what\nwe're actually doing at this point here.\n\n439\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.944\nBut you can go out on the Internet and\nactually find a lot of tutorials\n\n440\n00:20:37.944 --> 00:20:41.367\nout there that will show you how to\nactually build one of these kits.\n\n441\n00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:43.374\nAnd a lot of people have\nactually been doing this for\n\n442\n00:20:43.374 --> 00:20:45.420\ntheir own troubleshooting the utilities.\n\n443\n00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.440\nThey put it on thumb drives today, and\n\n444\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.010\nthat way you don't have\nto bring anything else.\n\n445\n00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.780\nThey just bring that thumb drive,\nthey plug it in, it boots up.\n\n446\n00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.679\nIt gives them format,\nit gives them disk part,\n\n447\n00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:56.630\nthey even put their own little\nutilities on there and it runs.\n\n448\n00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.770\nAnd you might go wow, why don't I\nactually use that and just run my laptop?\n\n449\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.691\nCuz it'll actually reboot after 72 hours.\n\n450\n00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:03.470\nSo whatever they've actually\nprogrammed in there,\n\n451\n00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:04.800\nit says, at 72 hours I'm gonna reboot.\n\n452\n00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.990\nSo even if your used to\nworking command line,\n\n453\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.960\nyou don't wanna actually spend a lot of\ntime installing something that's only\n\n454\n00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.400\ngonna reboot after 72 hours and\nlose all the changes that you made.\n\n455\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.690\nSo it's a really neat thing that\nhelps you when you don't have\n\n456\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.650\nany of the infrastructure in place.\n\n457\n00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.054\nBut it is a little bit complex, and\n\n458\n00:21:22.054 --> 00:21:24.436\nyou do have to actually take\na little bit of time to do that.\n\n459\n00:21:24.436 --> 00:21:26.465\nOnce it's built, you're ready to go.\n\n460\n00:21:27.665 --> 00:21:31.135\nSo let's talk about that\nreference image for just a moment.\n\n461\n00:21:31.135 --> 00:21:33.565\nWhere do people mess up\nin the reference image?\n\n462\n00:21:33.565 --> 00:21:36.865\nWhere people normally mess up in\nthe reference image is right here,\n\n463\n00:21:36.865 --> 00:21:37.945\nlet me show you.\n\n464\n00:21:37.945 --> 00:21:42.589\nSo now that I have my answer file and\nnow that I know that I've generated that,\n\n465\n00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:43.454\nI have my WIM.\n\n466\n00:21:43.454 --> 00:21:47.615\nAnd I went ahead and just installed\nthe actual DVD, just did a regular\n\n467\n00:21:47.615 --> 00:21:52.760\ninstallation process here,\nput the DVD in and started the install.\n\n468\n00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.560\nIt's right here what people mess up.\n\n469\n00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.540\nPeople go ahead and start typing it in,\nand then they log in and\n\n470\n00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.880\nthey're ready to go.\n\n471\n00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.790\nBut now they've also generated an extra\naccount on their machines that\n\n472\n00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.370\ndon't need to be there.\n\n473\n00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:04.130\nSo what can you do?\n\n474\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.150\nYou wanna actually be able,\nnow, to modify that image.\n\n475\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.790\nPut all the programs on there that\nyou want, update the computer,\n\n476\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.030\nput whatever you want to on there.\n\n477\n00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.500\nBut you don't wanna do it under\nsomebody else's user account.\n\n478\n00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.060\nYou want to actually do it at what\nthe local administrator account here.\n\n479\n00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.500\nSo if you'll type in admin and what that\ndoes is just create another account.\n\n480\n00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.848\nSo what you can do instead\nis do a Shift+Ctrl and\n\n481\n00:22:26.848 --> 00:22:32.630\nF3, and that will automatically boot\nyou into what we call the audit mode.\n\n482\n00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.487\nAudit mode gives us that ability\nnow to be able to say look,\n\n483\n00:22:36.487 --> 00:22:38.703\nanything that we do here is fine.\n\n484\n00:22:38.703 --> 00:22:42.723\nWe wanna install and do all that stuff,\nbut we don't want to go ahead and\n\n485\n00:22:42.723 --> 00:22:45.540\nget it ready for deployment yet.\n\n486\n00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.340\nThe reason why that's important is because\nwhen we get it ready for deployment\n\n487\n00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.510\nwe're gonna use a utility that we call\nSysprep, and you'll see it right here.\n\n488\n00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.380\nNotice it says System Preparation Tool.\n\n489\n00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.780\nAnd so when you take a look at\nthis system preparation tool,\n\n490\n00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.560\nI'm gonna select the work network here and\nclick Close.\n\n491\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.380\nThis is actually the utility that we're\ngonna use when we're actually done with\n\n492\n00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.440\neverything to tell it this\nimage is ready to go.\n\n493\n00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.220\nAnd when it does that,\nit has to go back through and\n\n494\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.340\nstrip off everything that uniquely\nlocks it into this computer.\n\n495\n00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.040\nSo all those security identifiers,\n\n496\n00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.940\neverything that locks it into this\ncomputer, is going to be stripped off and\n\n497\n00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.200\nthen it can generate its own when it\ngoes to deploy on another machine.\n\n498\n00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.230\nSo it's here that we can add in\nall of those extra utilities.\n\n499\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:31.140\nSo if I wanted to add in, let's say,\nthis one's running Internet Explorer 8.\n\n500\n00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.710\nI could update it to Internet Explorer 11,\nright here, do it.\n\n501\n00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:40.330\nI wanna add in Microsoft Office, I can add\nit in here and it works perfectly fine.\n\n502\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.920\nAnd I keep doing that here.\n\n503\n00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.380\nAnd I'm not actually logged in as\nanybody but the administrator.\n\n504\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.363\nI didn't actually create an account,\nthen I'm like,\n\n505\n00:23:49.363 --> 00:23:53.685\nwhy did this create an account called John\nor Mark or Admin when I didn't need to?\n\n506\n00:23:53.685 --> 00:23:56.949\nThat adds it in, and\nthat creates the default user profile, and\n\n507\n00:23:56.949 --> 00:24:00.407\nthat default user profile is where\nall those programs get added in.\n\n508\n00:24:00.407 --> 00:24:01.797\nAnd so\nnow everybody actually generates it.\n\n509\n00:24:01.797 --> 00:24:04.031\nWe don't have an extra\naccount just sitting there,\n\n510\n00:24:04.031 --> 00:24:06.150\nwondering why that account's there.\n\n511\n00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.850\nAnd remember, we actually just have\na dormant account sitting there.\n\n512\n00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.210\nThat could be a potential way\nthat somebody gets access in\n\n513\n00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.630\nwhen you don't ever use\nthat account again.\n\n514\n00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.640\nSo once you're actually done,\nthere's a couple of things.\n\n515\n00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.420\nIf I don't use the answer file,\n\n516\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.430\nall I need to do is select this Enter Out\nof Box Experience, and I'm ready to go.\n\n517\n00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:27.450\nIf I wanna reboot into audit mode again,\njust to test out, make sure that\n\n518\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:30.710\neverything's actually in there the way\nthat I want to, well I can do that.\n\n519\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.810\nSo if I actually say I just wanna test\nit out, I select auto mode, I reboot,\n\n520\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.880\nverify that now the programs work, that\nthey function, that they do everything\n\n521\n00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.260\nthey want to, perfectly fine, that's\nwhat we want to actually be able to do.\n\n522\n00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.559\nBut if I believe that I am ready, then I\nselect the Enter Out of Box Experience,\n\n523\n00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:52.580\nI put a checkbox here in Generalize,\nand then I select Shutdown, okay.\n\n524\n00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.830\nNow you can do a reboot if you're fast,\nokay?\n\n525\n00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.022\nIf you're not fast, right here, okay.\n\n526\n00:24:58.022 --> 00:24:59.340\n>> Not so fast.\n[LAUGH]\n\n527\n00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.610\n>> Not so fast, you wanna do a shutdown.\n\n528\n00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.510\nThe reason why is, on Sysprepping an\nimage, and this is where other people also\n\n529\n00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.870\nget caught up here, you can only\nSysprep an image three times, okay.\n\n530\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:14.270\nSo this image, once you Sysprep it\nthree times here, and you now go,\n\n531\n00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.540\nyou know, Daniel, I think I wanna\nadd in this utility and this tool.\n\n532\n00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.700\nYou go back into audit mode, you launch in\nthe audit mode, you add in that tool, and\n\n533\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.308\ngo, all right,\nthis is the other utility that we needed.\n\n534\n00:25:24.308 --> 00:25:28.380\nGo to Sysprep and it gives you some weird\nerror, and then you go and look it up\n\n535\n00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.060\nit says, this image has been Sysprepped\nmore often than, please recreate an image.\n\n536\n00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.750\nAnd that's what they're telling you\nis that, look, you've done this so\n\n537\n00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.320\nmany times, it's now time for\nyou to actually recreate the image again.\n\n538\n00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.830\n>> You obviously have such a difference in\nwhat you had before to what you have now\n\n539\n00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.448\nthat it's probably just a better idea to\ngo ahead and install that stuff and then\n\n540\n00:25:45.448 --> 00:25:49.336\nreimage the machine so that the image has\neverything that you need, you're not going\n\n541\n00:25:49.336 --> 00:25:53.010\nthrough all this, basically defeating\nthe purpose of doing what we're doing.\n\n542\n00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.087\nSo it's smart of them\nto put that in there.\n\n543\n00:25:55.087 --> 00:25:57.838\n>> It is very smart of them to do that\nbecause it really does cut down on\n\n544\n00:25:57.838 --> 00:26:00.740\nthe very fact that you actually have\nan image that's six years old and\n\n545\n00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.010\nyou're still,\nI'm just updating it one more time.\n\n546\n00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.216\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n547\n00:26:04.216 --> 00:26:05.090\n>> Whoa, really?\n\n548\n00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.932\n>> That's a heck of an update.\n\n549\n00:26:05.932 --> 00:26:07.560\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that is quite the update.\n\n550\n00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.830\nAnd these things can get bloated, and\nthat's why you want to make sure that, and\n\n551\n00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.960\nit does it gives you a chance\nto actually go all right,\n\n552\n00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.960\nwe're no longer using that program.\n\n553\n00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.810\nLet me just go out and weed that one out.\n\n554\n00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.300\nBut you have three times\nto be able to do that.\n\n555\n00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.130\nAnd that's actually key because that's\nwhere a lot of people also get caught.\n\n556\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.040\nOne, they don't understand how to get\ninto audit mode at the beginning, and\n\n557\n00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.540\nthen here, the other one is\nthat they don't understand that\n\n558\n00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.390\nthis is something you do\nhave to pay attention to.\n\n559\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.700\nIf you're like me, the first time I\nbuilt an image with this, I was so slow.\n\n560\n00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:34.643\nAnd I still am slow.\n\n561\n00:26:34.643 --> 00:26:36.090\nI can't say that I'm any faster.\n\n562\n00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:36.932\nI was so slow.\n\n563\n00:26:36.932 --> 00:26:38.192\nThen it starts installing 7.\n\n564\n00:26:38.192 --> 00:26:39.266\nWell, what's happening?\n\n565\n00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:42.290\nIt already stripped it off, and now it's\nactually adding it all back in again.\n\n566\n00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.175\nAnd then, you're like me,\nyou reboot again and you Sysprep again.\n\n567\n00:26:45.175 --> 00:26:46.349\nThen you go, aah!\nI missed it again.\n\n568\n00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:51.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And there's two.\n\n569\n00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.150\nAnd then it's like, this is my last\nchance, my last chance to do this.\n\n570\n00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.770\nAnd if you're like me,\nyou missed the last chance as well.\n\n571\n00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:57.920\nSo that's why I started being smart.\n\n572\n00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.790\nI was like, nope.\n\n573\n00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.990\nThe only way to do this is to do\nthe shutdown at this point, and\n\n574\n00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.960\nthen just let it shutdown.\n\n575\n00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.280\nOnce you shut it down at that point,\nthen you have to capture the image.\n\n576\n00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.120\nAnd you can actually use\nImageX to capture it,\n\n577\n00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.050\nor what you can do is actually reboot\ninto what we call a deployment server.\n\n578\n00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:20.080\nSo let me go ahead and\ndo that as well, okay.\n\n579\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.490\nSo let me see here.\n\n580\n00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:26.140\nLet me shut this thing down for\na moment and show the next process.\n\n581\n00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:26.970\nI want to see if I remembered.\n\n582\n00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.858\nI went ahead and took a snapshot of this\nto make it a little bit faster for us.\n\n583\n00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:34.668\nI remember post audit mode here,\ngonna restore that one.\n\n584\n00:27:34.668 --> 00:27:37.416\nI'm not going about saving that state.\n\n585\n00:27:37.416 --> 00:27:39.085\nLet's see if this is the one that I want.\n\n586\n00:27:43.172 --> 00:27:44.370\nAll right, so here it is.\n\n587\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.050\nLet's just say that this is what happens,\nright.\n\n588\n00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.330\nThe first time that we're\nactually booting back up,\n\n589\n00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.790\nit should actually do all of\nthe things that it needs to do.\n\n590\n00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.440\nAnd what it's doing, it's going to pull\nall the answer file information in,\n\n591\n00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.720\nand we're not going to actually wait for\n\n592\n00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.990\nit because it takes a little\nbit of time to generate, but\n\n593\n00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.710\nthat's what should happen is that\nthe answer file that we created,\n\n594\n00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.366\nit pulls it in, and if we actually\ndirected everything the way that want to,\n\n595\n00:28:04.366 --> 00:28:07.980\nand then we can log in and\neverything is ready to go.\n\n596\n00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.258\nNow, on this one I added in those,\n\n597\n00:28:10.258 --> 00:28:16.240\nthere's that Internet Explorer 11 that\nI was talking about, the VM ware tools.\n\n598\n00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.010\nAll that stuff gets added in.\n\n599\n00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.610\nAnd now this image can actually be\ndeployed anywhere if you're using ImageX\n\n600\n00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:25.400\nor even deployment server\nto be able to do so.\n\n601\n00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.520\nNow the hard part about doing\nthe deployment server is,\n\n602\n00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.510\nlet me shut this down again,\nis one last thing here,\n\n603\n00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.750\nis that what we need to do is we\nneed to capture that image, right.\n\n604\n00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.870\nSo we've created the image,\nit's shut down on our machine, and\n\n605\n00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.360\nnow I need to capture it.\n\n606\n00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.260\nI need to capture it and I need to\nget it pulled up to a network share,\n\n607\n00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.280\nor I need to get it up\nto a deployment server.\n\n608\n00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.460\nSo we're gonna use the deployment\nserver as our idea instead because that\n\n609\n00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.670\nis set up for deployment.\n\n610\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.810\nSo I'm gonna select boot to\na network adapter at this point.\n\n611\n00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.600\nAnd so if my machine is shut down,\n\n612\n00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.300\nI'm telling it don't watch the hard\ndrive here and let it install.\n\n613\n00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.280\nInstead, this time,\nI'm telling it, go ahead and\n\n614\n00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.025\njust boot up into the network adapter.\n\n615\n00:29:08.025 --> 00:29:09.854\n>> Now, normally,\nyou would do this from the BIOS.\n\n616\n00:29:09.854 --> 00:29:13.058\n>> You would say, do you go into the boot\noptions and find that network adaptor, and\n\n617\n00:29:13.058 --> 00:29:15.651\nthat's where you'd be running,\nis using virtual machines, so\n\n618\n00:29:15.651 --> 00:29:17.192\nhe's got nice graphical interface.\n\n619\n00:29:17.192 --> 00:29:19.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you do that,\n\n620\n00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.880\nyou select the boot option, and\n\n621\n00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.410\nif your device does support what are\ncelled PXE boot, you're perfectly fine.\n\n622\n00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.080\nAnd that will allow you to do so.\n\n623\n00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.860\nThis is another option you also\nmay get confused about as well.\n\n624\n00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.390\nIf you're like most of us, we don't\nactually tend to be very descriptive with\n\n625\n00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:37.630\nthe way that the things are named,\nand here's the default names, right.\n\n626\n00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.590\nMakes sense, okay.\n\n627\n00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.990\nOne says Boot but one says Capture.\n\n628\n00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.590\nWell, if I know I need to capture,\nthis is the one that I need to select,\n\n629\n00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.160\nwhich here is to capture.\n\n630\n00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.000\nSo I select that.\n\n631\n00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.870\nAnd then from that point,\nonce we get to what we need,\n\n632\n00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.360\nit's just a nice menu system and\nyou follow it through.\n\n633\n00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.200\nYou might have to provide\nsome credentials.\n\n634\n00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.960\nYou follow it through, it captures it,\n\n635\n00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.730\nit stores it up onto the deployment share,\nand you are ready to go at that point.\n\n636\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.860\nYou select the other one, it's just gonna\nsay, which of the following images do you\n\n637\n00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.520\nwant to actually deploy back to your\nmachine that you're connected to?\n\n638\n00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.650\nSo always remember that you can do that.\n\n639\n00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.810\nNow you can also do this from booting\nup to that PE disk as well, but\n\n640\n00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.130\nat that point, you have to manually\ngo ahead and do the same thing,\n\n641\n00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:23.003\nuse imageX and use a capture option and\nwhole bunch of other things.\n\n642\n00:30:23.003 --> 00:30:24.820\nAnd then you have to copy\nit to your hard drive, and\n\n643\n00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.480\nthen copy it from your hard drive\nup to the deployment share.\n\n644\n00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.230\nIt's a bear when you have to do it manual.\n\n645\n00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.420\n>> Yeah.\nIt can be a nightmare.\n\n646\n00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.480\nI used to plug those PE\ndisc environment before.\n\n647\n00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.000\nThey're really, really great, especially\nsince I use third party software,\n\n648\n00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.060\nwhich is great for that.\n\n649\n00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.150\nBut for what Ronnie's doing,\nthat is not the way you wanna go.\n\n650\n00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:44.316\nIf you can get to that deployment server,\nthat is your bread and butter.\n\n651\n00:30:44.316 --> 00:30:45.846\nThat's what you want to use.\n\n652\n00:30:45.846 --> 00:30:48.863\n>> And the good thing is, since you I\nprobably wouldn't be setting this up,\n\n653\n00:30:48.863 --> 00:30:51.540\nwe're gonna trust that the admin\nactually set up correctly, and\n\n654\n00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.150\nall you're doing is you're\nfollowing the wizard.\n\n655\n00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.240\nAnd from that point just wait 10, 15\nminutes, it'll tell you when it's done and\n\n656\n00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.310\nover, the machine will reboot just like\nit installed it for the first time, and\n\n657\n00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.040\nnow you don't have to\nworry about that machine.\n\n658\n00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.040\nThen every other machine,\n\n659\n00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:08.470\nthough, you've now captured that image\nthat can now be deployed across the entire\n\n660\n00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.095\nenterprise at Jab or the corporation or\neven that branch office.\n\n661\n00:31:12.095 --> 00:31:15.700\nIt's those little tiny things,\nright, the things that we showed you.\n\n662\n00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.420\nThe answer file can be\nincredibly important.\n\n663\n00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:23.040\nThe idea of actually knowing that you have\nto capture the image is also another one.\n\n664\n00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.740\nAnd then, of course,\n\n665\n00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.920\njust making sure that you know how\nto build that answer file too.\n\n666\n00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.070\nThose are also keys to making sure we\nget that deployment the way that we\n\n667\n00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.920\nneed it to.\n\n668\n00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.510\nSo those are some of the troubleshooting\nissues we have to deal with.\n\n669\n00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.230\n>> Very cool, Ronnie.\n\n670\n00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.150\nAnd hopefully you guys are tuning\ninto this and going, man,\n\n671\n00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:38.287\nI didn't even know this was an option.\n\n672\n00:31:38.287 --> 00:31:40.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It sure as heck is gonna make my life a\n\n673\n00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:45.120\nwhole lot easier, if I need to deploy out\na Windows 7 image to multiple machines.\n\n674\n00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.810\nThis is really where it earns its bacon,\nright, really earns its money, doing that.\n\n675\n00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.430\nRonnie, thanks for those demonstrations.\n\n676\n00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.870\nIs there anything else that we\nneed to go over in this episode?\n\n677\n00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.720\n>> Not so much so here, right, but the\nvery fact is that we still have to deal\n\n678\n00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.140\nwith a little bit, which is,\nof course, the deployment side.\n\n679\n00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.780\nWhat are things that can go\nwrong when we actually go,\n\n680\n00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.890\nall right, I need to deploy this image?\n\n681\n00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.800\nHow do I do it, and what do I need\nto do to troubleshoot it as well?\n\n682\n00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.070\n>> Well, I'm looking forward to that,\nhopefully you are as well!\n\n683\n00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.120\nBut thanks for watching today.\n\n684\n00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.040\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this episode up.\n\n685\n00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.840\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n686\n00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.460\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n687\n00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.284\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n688\n00:32:16.284 --> 00:32:16.784\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.260\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.890\nJoining me in the studio here\ntoday is what we could get for\n\n6\n00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.740\nminimum wage [LAUGH] and\nthat's Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.900\nHow's it going today Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.140\n>> It is going well today.\n\n9\n00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.690\nAnother great day to be right here in\nthe studio with minimum wage of course.\n\n10\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.170\nAs we take a look at supporting Windows 7.\n\n11\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.680\nRemember from the technical standpoint,\nas you working in the field, not so\n\n12\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.030\nmuch in exam standpoint.\n\n13\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.710\nDoesn't mean that you can't\nuse it to help you prepare for\n\n14\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.520\nthe exam, but overall though it really\nis about some of the issues that we fix.\n\n15\n00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.450\nAnd today we're kinda hitting the last of\nour Installation and deployment issues,\n\n16\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.610\nand we're focusing in\non the deployment side.\n\n17\n00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.500\nIf you haven't checked out those other\nepisodes where we talked about the image\n\n18\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.530\ncreation as well as the installation\nissues that we find with just basic\n\n19\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.380\ninstallation.\n\n20\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.720\nMake sure you check those\nepisodes out as well, but\n\n21\n00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.580\nhere we're actually talking about,\nwell, what happens.\n\n22\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.510\nWhat can happen when I actually\ngo to the other side of it and\n\n23\n00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.130\nwe now need to deploy it.\n\n24\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.080\nSo, the first time that I ran\ninto the idea of deployment,\n\n25\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.730\nit was a little bit challenging.\n\n26\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.060\nI didn't understand how the heck\nthough I actually boot my machine up,\n\n27\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.760\nwhen there may not be\nan operating system on it.\n\n28\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.710\nAnd that's what happened the very\nfirst time, Daniel, that we got like,\n\n29\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.660\n45 new computers And they're like,\nyeah just reimage the classroom.\n\n30\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.420\nAnd, you're now like, oh, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.030\nHow do I, how do I do that?\n\n32\n00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.440\nI don't have a clue how I do that.\n\n33\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.270\nThey're like oh just,\nyou know, just do a net boot.\n\n34\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.405\nI was like okay, I'm still kinda lost.\n\n35\n00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:35.472\nI don't understand.\n\n36\n00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:38.119\nAnd they were saying you can boot\nup the computer to the network.\n\n37\n00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.610\nAnd it still, now all the terms of course,\nhave flooded me.\n\n38\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.180\nAnd I am absolutely utterly\nconfused at this point.\n\n39\n00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.350\nBut there is something out there for\nus, right?\n\n40\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.050\nThe very fact is they don't tell\nus this stuff just to confuse us.\n\n41\n00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.210\nAt least I hope that's\nnot what they were doing.\n\n42\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.070\nBut, you never know,\nwe are a bunch of jokers around here.\n\n43\n00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.260\nBut there is this side, right.\n\n44\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.280\nThere's an infrastructure that's setup for\nus that allows us to hold images.\n\n45\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.880\nAnd then we can access them, and\npick which image that we want.\n\n46\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.660\nAnd say we want that image\nto be on our machines.\n\n47\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.380\nAnd there's a couple of different\ninstallation methods that we do this.\n\n48\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.247\nOne's called zero touch, where you and\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n49\n00:02:15.247 --> 00:02:18.412\nIt's just Daniel sitting\nat an admin console and\n\n50\n00:02:18.412 --> 00:02:22.283\nsays deploy classroom two or\ndeploy research department.\n\n51\n00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:24.100\nAnd it just goes ahead and does that.\n\n52\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.340\nAnd we don't have to touch anything.\n\n53\n00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.065\n>> I'll have that.\n\n54\n00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:27.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> That would be the way to go but\n\n55\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.699\nthat's an expensive way\nto go there Daniel.\n\n56\n00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.558\nIt's pretty expensive and\nit takes a lot of setup.\n\n57\n00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:33.077\nSo it's a lot less work on me and\n\n58\n00:02:33.077 --> 00:02:36.480\na lot more work on Daniel after\nactually having set that up.\n\n59\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.740\nSo that can work.\n\n60\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.540\nAnd then there's what we call\na light touch deployment.\n\n61\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.270\nMost of the time, for\n\n62\n00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.860\nsmall to medium businesses, the light\ntouch is the way that's going to go.\n\n63\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.350\nAnd that means you do have\nto manually go around and\n\n64\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.810\nactually touch each machine to\nget this deployment started.\n\n65\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.749\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you that process here.\n\n66\n00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.857\nSo I'm gonna just start by\nrebooting my machine here.\n\n67\n00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:57.940\nAnd in this process, you're gonna see\nright here, it's gonna say hey look,\n\n68\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.475\nyou're gonna need to press F12 for\nthe network boot service.\n\n69\n00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:01.451\nSo remember that,\n\n70\n00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.420\nthat means that your network adapter has\nto support what we call PXE booting.\n\n71\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.600\nIt's gonna get a network\naddress from our DHCP server.\n\n72\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.240\nOur DHTP servers gonna use what's\non that network adapter site?\n\n73\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.350\nYes, I can be pointed to somewhere else,\nand it's locking you into this right here,\n\n74\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.370\nwhich is a little RAM drive.\n\n75\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.830\nAnd you see it's called\nthe Windows boot manager.\n\n76\n00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.560\nAnd it even shows the IP address\nwhere it got this image and\n\n77\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.970\nactually deployed it for us.\n\n78\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.060\nAnd it leads us up to here.\n\n79\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.990\nIf I am actually capturing the image,\n\n80\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.890\nbecause I've created the image,\nI select that option.\n\n81\n00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.820\nI walk through the menu system.\n\n82\n00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.540\nAin't no big deal.\n\n83\n00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.030\nI walk through it, and\nit takes a little bit of time.\n\n84\n00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.730\nIt now captures that image.\n\n85\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.570\nAnd then it actually saves it up to\nthe deployment server on the network.\n\n86\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.350\nOnce that's saved though, on every other\nmachine, what I can do is select this one.\n\n87\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.480\nNow, it depends on who's\nactually managing this, right?\n\n88\n00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.450\nWe can make that second one disappear.\n\n89\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.963\nIf I know that I'm not actually doing\nthe image capture ever again, okay?\n\n90\n00:03:58.963 --> 00:04:01.494\nSo, if I'm actually capturing\nthe image I can turn it on and say.\n\n91\n00:04:01.494 --> 00:04:05.664\nMake sure the attache is out there\nwhen somebody actually does this, or\n\n92\n00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:07.620\nwe can actually just leave it on.\n\n93\n00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.440\nThat's all I did.\n\n94\n00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.930\nI was too lazy to actually\nturn it off here.\n\n95\n00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.490\nBut what we're looking for\nis that Windows 10 boot image.\n\n96\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.250\nSo if I select that one,\nnotice it's now loading up these files.\n\n97\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.283\nNow, this is not loading up Windows.\n\n98\n00:04:20.283 --> 00:04:24.164\nWhat it actually is doing is\nloading up a very limited edition.\n\n99\n00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:27.090\nThat will now connect me to\nthe deployment server and\n\n100\n00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.140\ngive me the ability to choose what image\nI want to deploy back on this machine.\n\n101\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.150\nSo if I've already gone through creating\nthat image, and I've captured it and\n\n102\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.830\nit's now saved,\nthis is where I need to go.\n\n103\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.410\nThat first choice is really\nthe hard choice of those two.\n\n104\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.470\nOkay, so at this point here,\n\n105\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.300\nonce we actually get to this point,\nyou need to know the name of the image.\n\n106\n00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.460\nNow this can be confusing,\nbecause a lot of times,\n\n107\n00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.410\nwhen we create images,\nit really is about departments, right?\n\n108\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.890\nThis department needs this application,\nbut this other department doesn't.\n\n109\n00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.253\nIt needs another application.\n\n110\n00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:02.634\nAnd hopefully you've actually named\nthem descriptively enough where,\n\n111\n00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:04.878\nyou can choose which one\nit actually is gonna be.\n\n112\n00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:09.502\n>> Image Z530216 is probably not\ngonna help you out a lot [LAUGH].\n\n113\n00:05:09.502 --> 00:05:12.350\n>> Yeah, not unless you're Data from-\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly, Star Trek.\n\n114\n00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.260\n>> From Star Trek, yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.400\nIf you're Data from Star Trek,\nmaybe not so.\n\n116\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.263\nBut, you see where it actually\ndoes say deployment services,\n\n117\n00:05:18.263 --> 00:05:21.081\ngives me the locale where I'm\nactually downloading it from.\n\n118\n00:05:21.081 --> 00:05:24.795\nAnd then I simply click Next.\n\n119\n00:05:24.795 --> 00:05:29.890\nI'm not gonna be able to say that,\nlab and I enter in my credentials here.\n\n120\n00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.280\n>> Ronnie can click next,\nhe just can't say it.\n\n121\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.260\n>> I can't say it and I can't type it.\n\n122\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.730\nAnd so you see where there is\nactually three different images here.\n\n123\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.440\nOkay?\n\n124\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.420\nSo, here's a Windows 10 image that I\nactually had created a little bit of\n\n125\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.360\ntime ago.\n\n126\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.830\nHere's a Windows seven\nenterprise image sounds good and\n\n127\n00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.580\nthen here is the 64 bit lab image.\n\n128\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.670\nNow this is where the naming\nactually does get confusing\n\n129\n00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.760\nif the person didn't name it correctly.\n\n130\n00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.860\nWhat you're hoping for is down here at the\nbottom though where it says description,\n\n131\n00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.720\nand you see where it actually says this.\n\n132\n00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.008\nWindows 7 Enterprise, it says\ndesktop image with IE 11 installed.\n\n133\n00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:04.002\nWell that sounds like the one that I want\nif I'm in that production environment.\n\n134\n00:06:04.002 --> 00:06:08.020\nAnd this second one here says\ntesting capture and deployment.\n\n135\n00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.530\nSo that one may actually have\neverything that I need, but\n\n136\n00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.510\nmore than likely this is probably\nthe one that I need here.\n\n137\n00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.360\nSo people that actually type in these\ndescriptions, it should help you out.\n\n138\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.460\nAnd also if you can know when that\nimage was actually last modified,\n\n139\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.200\nand captured up there, is key for you.\n\n140\n00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.870\nSo those are some of the harder things\nthat you actually have to do which is\n\n141\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.900\nthe idea of the image choice.\n\n142\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.350\nMaking sure you actually choose\nthe right one to end up deploying.\n\n143\n00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.980\nNow from this point on,\nI just click Next here, and\n\n144\n00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.530\nthen it actually sees my hard drive.\n\n145\n00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.077\nAnd this is also where\nyou must be careful.\n\n146\n00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:48.773\nIt automatically chose my second partition\nwhich is what I wanted it to do.\n\n147\n00:06:48.773 --> 00:06:53.010\nBut notice that there's also this one and\nthat's because I had pre-installed that.\n\n148\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.050\nNow if I wanna make sure there's actually\njust one big partition at the beginning.\n\n149\n00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.140\nWell what I can do is just go ahead and\nselect drive options.\n\n150\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.202\nAnd I just delete those\npartitions out of there.\n\n151\n00:07:02.202 --> 00:07:06.265\nIf I want to start over from\nbrand spanking new here.\n\n152\n00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:07.886\nClick OK, and there it is.\n\n153\n00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:11.739\nThere's all 85 gigs and\nat this point I can select Next.\n\n154\n00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:16.058\nAnd now it will go ahead and start doing\nthe deployment the way that we need it to.\n\n155\n00:07:16.058 --> 00:07:17.869\nSo, it's gonna connect to the server.\n\n156\n00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:22.159\nAnd once it does that, and it's now saying\nlook Ronnie you've messed up here, and\n\n157\n00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:24.510\nit's because of the way\nI actually did that.\n\n158\n00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.890\nIt said I don't like the fact\nthat you actually went ahead and\n\n159\n00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.990\ngot rid of those partitions and\nthe reason why, at this point.\n\n160\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.930\nIn a previous episode we had\ntalked about an answer file.\n\n161\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.717\nSo this is how I know\nit evidently happened.\n\n162\n00:07:35.717 --> 00:07:37.481\nRonnie, that's amazing\nhow did you know that?\n\n163\n00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:38.917\nIt's because of the answer file.\n\n164\n00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.492\nThe answer file when\nthis image was created,\n\n165\n00:07:41.492 --> 00:07:44.900\nwas automatically creating\nthat partition for me.\n\n166\n00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.130\nSo, when I, oops.\n\n167\n00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.230\nOh, what's going on here?\n\n168\n00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.740\nAll right.\n\n169\n00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.720\nThere we go, okay, it's rebooting.\n\n170\n00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.250\nI was gonna say, I didn't see that before.\n\n171\n00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.790\nSo, it's just rebooting\nbecause it's saying,\n\n172\n00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.670\nyou kind of hit the limit here\nof what you actually can do.\n\n173\n00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.330\nSo, if I just select this again and\nleave those partitions alone and\n\n174\n00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.380\nours don't contradict the answer file.\n\n175\n00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.156\nI should be okay and\nit should begin that deployment process.\n\n176\n00:08:08.156 --> 00:08:11.986\nBut if not, it means I probably have\nto go back into that answer file.\n\n177\n00:08:11.986 --> 00:08:16.684\nAnd see if I left that thing set\nat 60 megabytes instead of 65,000\n\n178\n00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:20.880\nmegabytes which would have\ngive me a 60 Gig hard drive.\n\n179\n00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.245\nAnd I've seen that before.\n\n180\n00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:24.654\nThe very fact is that\nanswer file actually says,\n\n181\n00:08:24.654 --> 00:08:28.910\npartition size should be in terms of gigs,\nof megabytes, not in terms of gigabytes.\n\n182\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.560\nWhich is what I had done before.\n\n183\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.900\nAnd so if that's still happening,\n\n184\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.510\nmore than likely that's an issue\nthat I would have to encounter.\n\n185\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.010\nSo you do have problems with answer\nfiles if you also have to worry about\n\n186\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.370\nin deployment issues too.\n\n187\n00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.766\nSo let me select this again, and\nthen we will try it one more time.\n\n188\n00:08:49.984 --> 00:08:54.820\nAnd make sure I select the right one,\nclick Next.\n\n189\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.359\nAnd then I'm gonna leave it as is, and\nthis is how I know that it's actually,\n\n190\n00:08:58.359 --> 00:08:59.564\nsee the answer file here?\n\n191\n00:08:59.564 --> 00:09:03.313\nNotice it says the partition, it labeled\nit the way that I actually created it\n\n192\n00:09:03.313 --> 00:09:05.410\nin the answer file, which was OS.\n\n193\n00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.069\nAnd there's that unallocated\nspace of two gigs.\n\n194\n00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:09.252\nI click Next here.\n\n195\n00:09:09.252 --> 00:09:12.486\nAnd if it actually peters out again,\nwhat that means that the answer file more\n\n196\n00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:16.060\nthan likely, I actually did something\nelse wrong inside that answer file.\n\n197\n00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.330\nBut, there it goes,\nit starts deploying here.\n\n198\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:23.015\nNow, the other things that can\nhappen during this point is\n\n199\n00:09:23.015 --> 00:09:26.752\nstuff that hopefully\nyou won't have to face.\n\n200\n00:09:26.752 --> 00:09:28.817\nAnd I'm trying to actually\nsimulate this here.\n\n201\n00:09:28.817 --> 00:09:34.010\nWhere somebody walks by and accidentally\ndisconnects your network adaptor, okay.\n\n202\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.310\nDoes that happen?\n\n203\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.280\nYou better believe it.\n\n204\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.720\nIt absolutely happens where somebody says,\nI wonder if this cable here is-\n\n205\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.770\n>> We work with Mike Rodder [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:42.810\n>> Yes that's true.\n\n207\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.850\n>> We know how that goes.\n\n208\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.100\n>> And so here's an issue that you\ncan face where it gets stopped by us.\n\n209\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.130\nCheck your physical connections first.\n\n210\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.400\nNetwork issues do happen, right?\n\n211\n00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.303\nThe very fact is somebody\ncan actually do that.\n\n212\n00:09:53.303 --> 00:09:56.570\nSo don't overlook just\nregular network issues.\n\n213\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.950\nSo when you see it stalled like this,\n\n214\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.130\nthat's another thing that\nyou can end up seeing.\n\n215\n00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.840\nThe other thing that you\nalso will experience too.\n\n216\n00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.670\nAnd I'm leaving it as is, cuz right now\nit's probably saying I need to try and\n\n217\n00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.985\nconnect that one, see if I can\nconnect back and we'll start again.\n\n218\n00:10:08.985 --> 00:10:10.830\nIt'll probably fail at this point.\n\n219\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, and\n\n220\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.310\nif it starts back then\nyou're actually up and good.\n\n221\n00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.170\nBut one of the weird things\nthat ends up happening.\n\n222\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.840\nAnd Daniel, you've probably\nexperienced this before too.\n\n223\n00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.160\nWe've had these computers.\n\n224\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.990\nAll identical computers.\n\n225\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:27.270\nAnd in a room of 16 computers, I can have\nit where 14 of them will deploy fine.\n\n226\n00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.850\nTwo of them will absolutely fail.\n\n227\n00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.790\nI don't know what the difference was.\n\n228\n00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.910\nThey were started exactly\nat the same time.\n\n229\n00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.240\nThey connect to the same\ndeployment server and there it is.\n\n230\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.930\nThose two computers absolutely failed.\n\n231\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.900\nUsually that does indicate\nthat there is a issue.\n\n232\n00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.500\nWhere?\n\n233\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.170\nAt those local computers that you\nalso need to troubleshoot too.\n\n234\n00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.310\nThe easiest way to troubleshoot that\nis now that those two computers.\n\n235\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.470\nAnd see if you can actually\ndeploy an image to those.\n\n236\n00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.340\nIf they still fail,\n\n237\n00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.570\nthen you know the issue is\nactually with those two computers,\n\n238\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.350\ncuz the other 14 were actually successful.\n\n239\n00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.900\nNotice it actually did pick up.\n\n240\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.300\nSo, even though it stalled,\nand it actually is good,\n\n241\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.120\ncuz that means it can do something,\nlike that.\n\n242\n00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.044\nNow, the good thing is with the deployment\nservices, when you have a lot of computers\n\n243\n00:11:07.044 --> 00:11:09.514\nit automatically creates\na multicast group for you.\n\n244\n00:11:09.514 --> 00:11:13.660\nAnd that multicast group will allow it to\nactually say, look, I'm gonna wait for\n\n245\n00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.442\n16 computers to connect\nbefore I send out the image.\n\n246\n00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:18.630\nAnd then I should only have\nto send it out one time.\n\n247\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.210\nIf not, if you go, I don't worry\nabout the multicast group and\n\n248\n00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.780\nthe administrator didn't\nactually set that up.\n\n249\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.770\nWell you're actually connecting\n16 different computers and\n\n250\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:27.610\nit's a 25 gig drive.\n\n251\n00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.835\nIt's sending out 25\ngigs 16 times in a row.\n\n252\n00:11:30.835 --> 00:11:34.317\n[CROSSTALK] That's\na pretty hefty saturation.\n\n253\n00:11:34.317 --> 00:11:34.990\n>> Yeah.\n\n254\n00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.080\n>> So you will also experience slow\ndowns with things like that as well.\n\n255\n00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.690\nSo, those are some of the other deployment\nissues you do have to worry about.\n\n256\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.460\nSo, if you go all right I want to do this,\nI want this to connect.\n\n257\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.660\nFirst thing of course, you need\na computer that will support Pixie Boot.\n\n258\n00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.330\nSo if your network adapter\ncard doesn't do it,\n\n259\n00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.165\nwell deployment services is not\nin your future at that point.\n\n260\n00:11:54.165 --> 00:11:56.621\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What you have now is of course gonna be\n\n261\n00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:59.956\nyour Windows PE disk [LAUGH]\nthat you will actually be using.\n\n262\n00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:02.284\nAnd then hopefully being able\nto connect to a network share.\n\n263\n00:12:02.284 --> 00:12:05.728\nAnd start your deployment from that point,\ntoo, connecting,\n\n264\n00:12:05.728 --> 00:12:07.782\nof course, to the deployment share.\n\n265\n00:12:07.782 --> 00:12:08.685\nAnd here's another one.\n\n266\n00:12:08.685 --> 00:12:15.371\nGood thing is, if it's set up correctly,\nlike what mine is, yeah, I set it up.\n\n267\n00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:16.573\nBut if it's set up correctly,\n\n268\n00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:18.709\nit should automatically do\nexactly what I showed you.\n\n269\n00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:19.963\nSelect the network boot.\n\n270\n00:12:19.963 --> 00:12:22.735\nIt finds that deployment server,\nit should connect in,\n\n271\n00:12:22.735 --> 00:12:24.690\nyou shouldn't have very many issues.\n\n272\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.371\nIt's made to be fairly easy.\n\n273\n00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:29.597\nSo your key here is the choice\nthat you have to make.\n\n274\n00:12:29.597 --> 00:12:33.335\nIf the names aren't actually,\nexactly very descriptive.\n\n275\n00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:34.979\nYou have to do a little\nbit more research and\n\n276\n00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:36.540\nfigure out which one you actually need.\n\n277\n00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.164\nVerify it is the information\nthat you need.\n\n278\n00:12:38.164 --> 00:12:41.655\nIt's always one of those weird things when\nyou deploy the wrong image to the wrong\n\n279\n00:12:41.655 --> 00:12:44.597\nmachine, because they're hardware\nindependent today, right?\n\n280\n00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:48.347\nYou can actually take an image that\ndoesn't even belong to the same computer\n\n281\n00:12:48.347 --> 00:12:51.057\ngrouping, or\nthe same type of computer and deploy it.\n\n282\n00:12:51.057 --> 00:12:53.060\nAnd then go,\nI don't know why it looks this way.\n\n283\n00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.580\nWell it's more than likely\nyou picked that wrong image.\n\n284\n00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.870\nAnd you see right here, on my screen\nit's actually already finished,\n\n285\n00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:59.440\nand there it goes.\n\n286\n00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.340\nIt's actually rebooting at this\npoint to finish out the rest of that\n\n287\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.880\ninstallation for us.\n\n288\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.330\nSo deployment can be very\nquick at this point, too.\n\n289\n00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.830\nThis time I'm not actually\ngoing to hit my network boot.\n\n290\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.340\nSo I don't actually do anything.\n\n291\n00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.620\nAnd then it's gonna go on through, and\n\n292\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.230\nit should start the rest of\nthe process of the installation.\n\n293\n00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.660\nAnd we should be fine.\n\n294\n00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.920\nBut you do have to worry about\nthose simple, common things.\n\n295\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.298\nThe network issues.\n\n296\n00:13:20.298 --> 00:13:24.580\nThen the PXI booting, make sure that\nwe're picking the right image out.\n\n297\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.940\nYou should be fine and ready to go.\n\n298\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.620\n>> Yeah, I like that.\n\n299\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.050\nRight.\nIt's very nice to be able to say,\n\n300\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.520\nokay, I've got 20 new computers.\n\n301\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.990\nI'm gonna deploy this out, I'm just\ngonna boot these guys to networking.\n\n302\n00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.100\nAnd then Ronnie said yeah,\n\n303\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.620\nyou gotta make sure that that\nnetwork card supports PXI boot.\n\n304\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.289\nBut if you're buying 20 new computers,\n\n305\n00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:46.047\nit's probably a good idea to put it on\nyour wish list of items on your new PCs.\n\n306\n00:13:46.047 --> 00:13:49.214\nYou just tell that manufacturer,\nhey these things have got to support PXI,\n\n307\n00:13:49.214 --> 00:13:51.354\nbecause I'm gonna be doing\ndeployment services.\n\n308\n00:13:51.354 --> 00:13:53.559\nCuz I want to make my\nlife a little bit easier.\n\n309\n00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:57.366\nAnd use that nice,\njust one stop shopping basically.\n\n310\n00:13:57.366 --> 00:14:00.766\nI say I'm gonna deploy it once, goes out\nto all my computers, all I gotta do is run\n\n311\n00:14:00.766 --> 00:14:04.140\naround and get them all to boot up to\nthe network and I'm off to the races.\n\n312\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.500\nRonnie, is there anything else we need\nto know about deployment services?\n\n313\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.670\n>> Well, there's probably a lot more just\nabout deployment services itself, but\n\n314\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.830\nto actually find out more about that,\n>> Do check out our Windows 2012 shows,\n\n315\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.490\nwhere we do more in depth into\ndeployment services right there.\n\n316\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.423\nAnd you'll actually find out a lot more\nabout how to set it up from that side.\n\n317\n00:14:23.423 --> 00:14:26.146\nDon't get me wrong, it's something that\nwe have to deal with as technicians.\n\n318\n00:14:26.146 --> 00:14:29.486\nBut a lot of times we're probably\nnot gonna be the ones that actually\n\n319\n00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:34.240\nare getting the images, storing them and\nmaking sure I'm managing all those things.\n\n320\n00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.390\n>> But we do need to make\nsure that they're there.\n\n321\n00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.440\nThe only other issue that I can think of,\n\n322\n00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.980\nI was just thinking about this at the very\nend here is that when you do finish\n\n323\n00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.800\ndeploying that image.\n\n324\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.080\nYou want to verify that it actually does\nshow everything that you're expecting.\n\n325\n00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.885\nSo your normal image.\n\n326\n00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:50.903\nIn other words, did it actually do the\nthings that you thought it was gonna do in\n\n327\n00:14:50.903 --> 00:14:51.647\nyour answer file.\n\n328\n00:14:51.647 --> 00:14:55.830\nIf it didn't, it more than likely means\nyou're answer file did not apply.\n\n329\n00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.011\nAnd this is where you would\nhave to escalate that issue.\n\n330\n00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:02.000\nIf the answer file didn't apply when you\nactually connected the deployment server.\n\n331\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.760\nWell, then you do know that hey, at some\npoint here something else has to be done.\n\n332\n00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.139\nAnd you may not have that\nauthority to be able to do that.\n\n333\n00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:11.809\nSo you just escalate it and\nlet them take care of at that point.\n\n334\n00:15:11.809 --> 00:15:15.238\nAnd say, look all of my computers I just\ndeployed here the answer file didn't\n\n335\n00:15:15.238 --> 00:15:18.850\nactually or, I didn't get this,\nI didn't get this, I didn't get this.\n\n336\n00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.290\nThey can take a look at it.\n\n337\n00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.910\nMine, probably is deploying, but\nit actually is still booting up.\n\n338\n00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.240\nSo it's going to take\na little bit of time.\n\n339\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.330\n>> So, just walk through that\npost installation check list.\n\n340\n00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.290\n>> Right.\n>> Make sure everything looks good\n\n341\n00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.360\n>> And once it is, hey,\n\n342\n00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.620\nyou're off to the races.\n\n343\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.990\nYou've deployed Windows out\nusing a network that is a.\n\n344\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.480\nThat's the way to do it nowadays,\nto be honest with you.\n\n345\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.670\n>> And all right, Ronnie,\nthank you so much for that.\n\n346\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.300\nWe appreciate all the hard\nwork you've put into that.\n\n347\n00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a little setup to get that going.\n\n348\n00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.321\nI'll talk to the boss about\nthat $0.10 raise for you.\n\n349\n00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:45.984\n>> Thank you, I appreciate it.\n\n350\n00:15:45.984 --> 00:15:46.565\n>> I know you'll need it.\n\n351\n00:15:46.565 --> 00:15:49.076\n>> I will, [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right everyone, thanks for\n\n352\n00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:50.180\nwatching our show

00:00:16.220\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.070\nHow you doing Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.850\n>> I'm doing fine today.\n\n6\n00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.010\nIt's another great day that we\nget to come into our studio.\n\n7\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.860\nAnd take a look at some Windows 7,\nso we're ready to get started.\n\n8\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.230\n>> We are, and in this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.280\nRonnie, we're going to focus\nin on policies, right?\n\n10\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.280\nWe're going to actually have a couple of\nepisodes that deal with policies because\n\n11\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.100\nwe've got local policies, and\n\n12\n00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.835\nthen we have domain policies Domain based\npolicies and as a Windows 7 technician\n\n13\n00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:41.735\nworking with Windows 7 systems we've\ngotta have a good understanding of both.\n\n14\n00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:46.315\nWhen they're applied, how they\nwork together and it can be pretty\n\n15\n00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:50.115\ncomplex until you really take a look at\nit so we're gonna simplify it for you.\n\n16\n00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:53.725\nWe're gonna make it so you guys understand\nthese policies like nobody else.\n\n17\n00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:58.700\nSo let's start with working with our\nlocal policies on a Windows 7 machine.\n\n18\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.110\nYou know when we start taking a look\nat implementing some type of policy,\n\n19\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.810\nyou may be like I was the first\ntime I heard it about it,\n\n20\n00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.050\n\"What in the world to I actually\nneed something like this\n\n21\n00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.320\nif I'm the only one on this machine and\nit's doing what I need to Mike,\n\n22\n00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.040\nis there a reason for me to actually\nmess around with any of those settings?\n\n23\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.140\n>> There's really not.\n\n24\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.180\nAnd let's go back one step and\n\n25\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.100\nmake sure we understand what we mean\nwhen we say a policy because we know if\n\n26\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.250\nyou're using a Windows operating system,\nand Windows 7 no different,\n\n27\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.740\nthat there are literally thousands\nof settings that I can configure.\n\n28\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.790\nIn my operating system, from very simple\nthings like how long it is before my\n\n29\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.240\nscreen saver kicks in, to much more\ncomplex things like which programs\n\n30\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.930\nare allowed to run, preventing access\nto certain tools and things like that.\n\n31\n00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.860\nSo, I can go in to my machine and\nI can configure most of those settings.\n\n32\n00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.110\nThrough the gooey.\n\n33\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.060\nOr I could dive into the registry and\nI could make some changes there, but\n\n34\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.250\nif I want to try to have it\naffect more than one person, or\n\n35\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.390\nif I want to do this in\na more streamlined fashion,\n\n36\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.880\nthat's really when that local\npolicy comes into play, right?\n\n37\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.140\nBecause every Windows\nmachine Has a local policy.\n\n38\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.690\nAnd that policy applies to that particular\nmachine and it applies to anyone and\n\n39\n00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.680\neveryone that logs on.\n\n40\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.170\nSo, to get back to your question Ronnie,\ndo I need this?\n\n41\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.200\nWell if you're the only user on that\nmachine You really don't, it's almost,\n\n42\n00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.110\nyou could do it either way.\n\n43\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.320\nEither way would work just fine.\n\n44\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.960\nDo I go into my GUI and configure\nthe settings like my screen saver timeout?\n\n45\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.560\nSure.\n\n46\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.130\nDo I go into my local policy and\nconfigure the screen saver timeout?\n\n47\n00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.970\nThat would work just as fine as well.\n\n48\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.840\nBut the difference is, or\nwhen you wanna use that policy,\n\n49\n00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.000\nis when you might have More than one user.\n\n50\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.490\nWhat if you have shared computers?\n\n51\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.940\nWhat if people float between machines?\n\n52\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.100\nThat's when these local\npolicies can come into effect.\n\n53\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.080\n>> It really is a beneficial process for\n\n54\n00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.990\nus to actually be able to implement this\ntype of policy, because if we do have\n\n55\n00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.760\nmultiple people working on that machine\n>> and\n\n56\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.060\nyou go I just bought that machine and\neverybody works off of it.\n\n57\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.440\nThat's perfectly fine, but\nremember when people end up and\n\n58\n00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.290\nyou create different accounts for\nthem and they log in, if you go I\n\n59\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.980\nwant to make it administrator and do that\n>> That means\n\n60\n00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.250\nany changes that they make can\nactually affect the entire computer.\n\n61\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.580\nSo you may not have it like\nI have it at home in which,\n\n62\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.020\neven though I've created accounts for\nmy wife, and for my daughter, and for\n\n63\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.200\nmyself on our computer so that we keep all\nof our settings differently, it doesn't\n\n64\n00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.170\nmatter because my wife just leaves me\nlogged on all the time, and so when I come\n\n65\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.780\nhome I never know what's going to be on my\ndesktop at times, whether the background's\n\n66\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.690\ngoing to change Whether there's actually\ngoing to be some configuration, whether or\n\n67\n00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.350\nnot they've added in some\napplication that's on the computer.\n\n68\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.930\nYou name it, there's so\nmany different changes and I come back and\n\n69\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.640\nit's not even the same computer.\n\n70\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.690\nThere's a lot of times when I go,\n\n71\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.010\nI don't even know what computer\nI'm sitting on anymore.\n\n72\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.590\nSo policies can help us,\nespecially in that environment,\n\n73\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.960\nin which we are actually\nhaving shared workstations.\n\n74\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.030\nAnd a local policy like what Mike said\nreally applies in those two situations.\n\n75\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.580\nOne where you have a single computer\nbecause that local policy really\n\n76\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.700\nonly affects that computer.\n\n77\n00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.740\nAnd secondly, when you actually\nare having multiple users.\n\n78\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.770\nSo, in a In a workplace environment, even\na small environment, you may choose to\n\n79\n00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.250\nactually set it up a little bit\ndifferently for each of the users.\n\n80\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.100\n>> Absolutely.\n\n81\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.240\nNow most of you, or some of you,\nare probably aware.\n\n82\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.460\nIn a domain environment, we have what we\ncall domain-based group policy objects.\n\n83\n00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.540\nAnd with those.\n\n84\n00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.470\nInstead of having to configure the local\npolicy on every single machine, I can\n\n85\n00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.370\nconfigure it at the domain level and have\nit apply to all the different machines or\n\n86\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.580\nall the different users or some subset.\n\n87\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.380\nSo that's gonna be much more efficient.\n\n88\n00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.060\nSo you might think,\nwould I ever use a local GPO or\n\n89\n00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.780\na local policy in a domain\nbased environment?\n\n90\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.840\nAnd the answer is still yes.\n\n91\n00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.610\nThere are times, maybe you've got some\none off machines, like you've got that\n\n92\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.870\nkiosk out in the lobby, or you've got\nthat one machine in the conference room,\n\n93\n00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.060\nand it needs settings that no other\nmachine on your network needs.\n\n94\n00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.020\nIt'll actually be easier to configure\na local policy on that one machine\n\n95\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.190\nthan to configure domain based policy and\nfilter it down so\n\n96\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.000\nthat it only applies to one machine.\n\n97\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.880\nSo you get that capability for\nthose one-offs.\n\n98\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.160\nIf you're not in a domain environment,\nlet's say you've got four or\n\n99\n00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.760\nfive computers in this soho\nthat you're supposed to manage.\n\n100\n00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.540\nYou want consistent settings\nacross all those machines.\n\n101\n00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.900\nWell, Ronnie just told you the local\npolicy only applies to that one machine.\n\n102\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.730\nBut we can use other tools and\n\n103\n00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.800\nwe can export those policies and\nwe can import them onto other machines.\n\n104\n00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.330\nAnd that way we get consistent settings.\n\n105\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.840\nWhereas, if I'm just going into\nthe Registry or into the Gooey and\n\n106\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.710\nmaking the configurations, I'd go to\nBob's machine, I'd make some changes.\n\n107\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.680\nI go to Sue's machine,\nI have to make those changes again.\n\n108\n00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.640\nI go to Doug's machine,\nI have to make them again.\n\n109\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.520\nAnd what if I forget one of\nthe settings I did on Bob's machine and\n\n110\n00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.740\nI didn't apply it on Doug's machine?\n\n111\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.420\nAll right?\n\n112\n00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.690\nNow I've got inconsistent settings\nacross those machines in that office.\n\n113\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.870\nSo even though domain environment,\nyou might wanna use those domain\n\n114\n00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.440\nbased policies, there's still times\nwe need to use these local policies.\n\n115\n00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.160\nThey are important to understand.\n\n116\n00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.040\nAnd know how to configure them.\n\n117\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.870\n>> So, whether depending on\nthe environment that you're in,\n\n118\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.570\nif it's that small office, home office and\n\n119\n00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.100\nyou don't have a domain environment, an\nActive Directory domain environment which\n\n120\n00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.430\nyou are actually logging in through\nthat Active Directory domain.\n\n121\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.630\nOr whether you're actually\nsharing those computers or\n\n122\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.760\nthe kiosk, this is a great place for\nus to actually apply these policies.\n\n123\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.020\nWell, the best thing for us to do\nright now is actually just show you\n\n124\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.070\nwhere we actually go in and apply those\npolicies and we'll talk about some\n\n125\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.390\nof the different ways we can also add\nin some special configurations for us.\n\n126\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.520\nSo, let's go ahead and go to my machine,\nand what we're going to do is we're going\n\n127\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.470\nto bring up the management console for the\nlocal policy on this windows 7 machine.\n\n128\n00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.810\nAnd there's probably multiple\nways to do this, but\n\n129\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.370\nthe easiest way that I know to\ndo this is to click on Start and\n\n130\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.395\nthen in the Search programs and files,\nI'm gonna type in gp, for group policy,\n\n131\n00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:49.310\nedit.msc, and when I do that,\nand I go ahead and press Enter,\n\n132\n00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.670\nthat will bring up my Local Group Policy\nEditor And I'm gonna expand this out.\n\n133\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.010\nAnd have Mike kinda help me out here.\n\n134\n00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.220\nSo that we understand what we're\nactually taking a look at.\n\n135\n00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.290\nWhen we start talking\nabout the local policy,\n\n136\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.250\nnotice that it's actually broken down\ninto what we call computer configuration.\n\n137\n00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.970\nAnd also user configuration here.\n\n138\n00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.430\nMike, this is one machine,\nand if I do this for\n\n139\n00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.720\nthe computer configuration, what's the\ndifference here for user versus computer?\n\n140\n00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.610\n>> Well,\nthe way they break that policy up,\n\n141\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.300\nthey've got settings that\napply to the computer itself.\n\n142\n00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.150\nAnd then on the user\nconfiguration portion,\n\n143\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.190\nyou've got settings that apply to\nthe users that log on to that machine.\n\n144\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.570\nThere is some duplication between\nthe computer half and the user half,\n\n145\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.450\nbut not much.\n\n146\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.020\nSo, we have to understand what setting,\nif we're trying to configure something,\n\n147\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.910\nis it something that applies\nto the computer itself or\n\n148\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.520\nis it something that applies to\nthe users that are logging on?\n\n149\n00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.870\nSo that's how they divide that up so\n\n150\n00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.220\nthat, The first thing we do when\nwe're trying to find a setting or\n\n151\n00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.880\nconfigure setting is, is it a computer\nsetting or is it a user setting?\n\n152\n00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.270\nAnd if you expand out like administrative\ntemplates underneath that computer.\n\n153\n00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.490\nThere's either software settings,\nthat's for installing software.\n\n154\n00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.219\nThere's Windows settings, which is\nwhere I find my security settings and\n\n155\n00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:04.482\nmy password policies, my auto policies,\nand things like that.\n\n156\n00:08:04.482 --> 00:08:06.725\nAnd then under\nthe administrative templates,\n\n157\n00:08:06.725 --> 00:08:09.752\nthis is where you find the registry\nmodifications and as you kind\n\n158\n00:08:09.752 --> 00:08:13.282\nof drill down in there, like if you go\nto control panel, and maybe expand,\n\n159\n00:08:13.282 --> 00:08:17.150\nI don't know, try to expand out some of\nthose and look at the different settings,\n\n160\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.560\nyou know, these are things that\nwould apply to the computer.\n\n161\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.022\nLike, if you could read some,\nI can't read those from here.\n\n162\n00:08:23.022 --> 00:08:25.120\nYeah [CROSSTALK]\n>> Regional language options and\n\n163\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.320\nalso user accounts in the Control Panel.\n\n164\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.640\n>> All right, fly the default user\nlogon picture to a new user account,\n\n165\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.270\nsomething like that.\n\n166\n00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.500\nNow if we do the same thing,\nif we go down to the user half and\n\n167\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.640\nexpand out Administrative Templates and\n\n168\n00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.430\ngo into Control Panel, We'll see that\nthey're not the same settings, right?\n\n169\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.260\nThese are settings that\nmore apply to a user,\n\n170\n00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.180\nlike whether I wanna restrict access\nto the control panel at all or\n\n171\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.030\nI can go in and work with their\ndisplay settings and things like that.\n\n172\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.650\nSo that's how the policy's divided up.\n\n173\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.490\nYou got computer settings that\napply to the computer and\n\n174\n00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.330\nyou've got user settings\nthat apply to the user.\n\n175\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.170\nSo when we take a look at\nthe division of these policies and\n\n176\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.130\nthe way that they're done, we have\nto actually know when these policies\n\n177\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.350\nare eventually going to be applied.\n\n178\n00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.340\nSo when we actually do something\nunder the computer settings,\n\n179\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.550\nwe've got to realize\nwhat Mike is telling us.\n\n180\n00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.970\nAnd if we apply that, that's going to\napply to all the users that are gonna log\n\n181\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:21.240\non to that computer,\nregardless of who they are at this point.\n\n182\n00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.010\nSo, when we actually set something like\nthat up that's what's going to happen.\n\n183\n00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.780\nSo, whether you're MIke or Susan or\n\n184\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.200\nwhatever, these policies are going to\napply to all of them as they log on.\n\n185\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.500\n>> Exactly.\n\n186\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.980\nThose computer settings the way they apply\n\n187\n00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.420\nwhen your computer starts up it\nreads that local policy, but\n\n188\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:43.060\nit only looks at the The computer half of\nthose settings because it's a computer.\n\n189\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.830\nThis is not a user.\n\n190\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.280\nIt doesn't give anything\nabout the user settings.\n\n191\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:52.050\nWhen your computer starts up, it reads\nthe computer half of that local policy,\n\n192\n00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.990\nand it does this before you\neven get the log on screen.\n\n193\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.800\nAlright, then once that's finished\napplying those computer settings\n\n194\n00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.830\nthen you log on to that machine.\n\n195\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.410\nThen it goes back and\nit does it all over again.\n\n196\n00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.780\nThis time reading the user\nhalf of that local policy and\n\n197\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.380\nit applies those user settings.\n\n198\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.390\nSo it applies the computer settings\nwhen the computer starts up.\n\n199\n00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.040\nAnd applies the user settings\nwhen the user logs on.\n\n200\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.580\n>> And this has always been the\ntraditional way it's been done even since\n\n201\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.380\nWindows, I'm gonna say XP.\n\n202\n00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.530\n>> Gosh, yeah, even probably before that.\n\n203\n00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.680\nWindows has had a local\ngroup policy forever.\n\n204\n00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.850\n>> And so when you take a look at it,\nthat sounds great,\n\n205\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:32.758\nthat sounds wonderful, but what now if\nwe're actually sharing the same computer\n\n206\n00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:33.790\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> And\n\n207\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.760\nwhat I want though is\na little bit different.\n\n208\n00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.470\nWhat I want is administrators\non that computer.\n\n209\n00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:39.050\nIn other words,\n\n210\n00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.450\npeople who can change some settings, but\nI wanna make sure that other people can't.\n\n211\n00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.680\nIs there anything we can do about that?\n\n212\n00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.470\n>> We can.\nStarting with Windows Vista\n\n213\n00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.250\nthey gave us additional local\npolicies that we can use.\n\n214\n00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.470\nWe still have our local Policy that\nhas user settings in there and\n\n215\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.500\nalso has computer settings in there.\n\n216\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.530\nBut again, starting with Vista they\ngave us three new local policy.\n\n217\n00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:04.110\nThey gave us administrator local policy,\na non administrator and\n\n218\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.470\nnow they're switching it and\ncalling it a standard user.\n\n219\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.400\n>> Right.\nPolicy, but\n\n220\n00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.890\nI call it administrators policy,\nthe non administrators policy,\n\n221\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.370\nand then there' s a user\nspecific policy as well.\n\n222\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.840\nSo why did they give us these?\n\n223\n00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.660\nWell, because now I can have\na setting that only applies\n\n224\n00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.930\nif you log on with\nan administrative account.\n\n225\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.390\nLet's say your user account Is in\nthe local admins group on that machine.\n\n226\n00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.670\nWell, then it is going to apply the local\npolicy; the local policy always applies.\n\n227\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.400\nThen, it is going to apply\nthat administrator policy\n\n228\n00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.000\nbecause you're in the administrators\ngroup on that machine.\n\n229\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.980\nNow if you weren’t in the administrators\ngroup on that machine, then\n\n230\n00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.000\nit would apply the local policy, then it\nwould apply the non-administrators policy.\n\n231\n00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.640\nSo now I can have settings that only\napply if you’re an administrator.\n\n232\n00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.500\nI can have settings that apply only\nif you’re not an administrator.\n\n233\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.250\nWhich is really cool.\n\n234\n00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.220\nThat’s something that was\ndifficult to do In the past.\n\n235\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.100\nAnd then they even took it a step further.\n\n236\n00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:05.750\nWe also have a policy that's a user\nspecific GPO, or local policy.\n\n237\n00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:10.000\nSo I can have a setting that only applies\nif Ronnie logs in to the machine.\n\n238\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.460\nAnybody else logs into it,\nthat policy doesn't kick in.\n\n239\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.860\nWe call it the Ronnie policy.\n\n240\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.960\nRight, so we've got really access\nto three, we'll say three,\n\n241\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.930\nright, because you're gonna have\nthe local policy that always applies.\n\n242\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.590\nAnd then, it's either the administrator or\nthe non-administrator.\n\n243\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.940\nYou can't log in with an account that's\nboth in the administrators group and\n\n244\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.900\nat the same time not in\nthe administrators group.\n\n245\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.380\nSo one or the other And\nthen possibly a local,\n\n246\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.960\nI mean a user-specific policy\ncould be in effect as well.\n\n247\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.850\n>> And this is very important because you\nmay end up in that situation in which you\n\n248\n00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.400\nreally only want one person being able\nto affect that computer, you want\n\n249\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.690\nthe other ones to be able to use it\n>> But may be more limited and\n\n250\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.070\nso that way you don't have\nsomebody just come in and go,\n\n251\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.990\noh I want to configured it this way,\nand because your administrator actually\n\n252\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.910\nconfigures it that way for\neveryone at the same time.\n\n253\n00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.500\nSo we want to show you how\nyou actually go ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.360\nconfigure policies like that as well.\n\n255\n00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.240\nNow Mike, the first time that\nI heard about this I was like,\n\n256\n00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.850\nthey really don't give you\na setting over here to do that.\n\n257\n00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.770\nI don't see anything that I'm right\nclicking on that I can actually\n\n258\n00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.100\npull anything in.\n\n259\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.800\nSo, it was a little bit confusing.\n\n260\n00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.720\nWhat we have to do is now we get a little\nbit more into the administrative side and\n\n261\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.310\nwe have to create what we call an MMC or\na Microsoft management console.\n\n262\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.220\nAnd, we'll show you how to do that now,\nand show you how you'd actually begin\n\n263\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.470\nto modify those policies and\nset it up differently.\n\n264\n00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.290\nSo, we're going to close out of\nthe local group policy editor now.\n\n265\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.050\nAnd then, I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on the start button And\n\n266\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:40.260\nin the search programs and files I'm\ngonna type in MMC, Mike Mike Charlie, and\n\n267\n00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.650\nyou'll notice that there is\na little program here called MMC.\n\n268\n00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.640\nAnd when I go ahead and launch that\nI'm gonna have the UAC prompt me that\n\n269\n00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.740\nsays I need to run this under\nadministrative credentials and\n\n270\n00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.470\nthat gives me a blank generic console\nis what it actually gives us here.\n\n271\n00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.890\nAnd so when you take a look at this, and\nyou're like, there's nothing really there,\n\n272\n00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.570\nthat's because we are now creating\na custom management console.\n\n273\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.250\nAnd it's something that I found\nneat the first time that I did it,\n\n274\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.950\ncuz I didn't actually know that\nyou could do stuff like this.\n\n275\n00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.620\nAnd this is something that we've got to\nget used to, especially we're gonna choose\n\n276\n00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.810\nto use policies like this\nto affect that computer.\n\n277\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.230\nSo the easiest thing in the world for\nus to actually begin to create that\n\n278\n00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.070\nis once I have the console\nroot I can go to File.\n\n279\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:25.500\nAnd then what I'm looking for is this\nfifth option that says Add/Remove Snap-in.\n\n280\n00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.280\nAnd once they actually get to the add and\n\n281\n00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.590\nremove snap-in dialogue window here We are\nscrolling down and what we are looking for\n\n282\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.260\nis the Group Policy Object Editor, and you\ncan see, the little description here says,\n\n283\n00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.840\nallows you to edit the Local Group Policy\nObjects stored on the computer and\n\n284\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.410\nwhen I click Add this is where I\nbegin a little bit of modification.\n\n285\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:49.510\nIf I know I am actually going to be adding\nin the administrator, non administrator,\n\n286\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.370\nuser policies,\n\n287\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.010\nwhatever we would want, That's what\nwe want to actually be able to do.\n\n288\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.610\nNotice by default it actually has the\ngroup policy object and local computer.\n\n289\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.430\nWell we saw that when we ran that gp\n\n290\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.085\nedit.msc at the very beginning so\nI'm not gonna\n\n291\n00:15:05.085 --> 00:15:08.295\nI'm not gonna worry about that one cause\nthat one has it's on snap-in right there.\n\n292\n00:15:08.295 --> 00:15:08.935\n>> I'll tell you.\n\n293\n00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:11.265\nI love to add them all to here.\n\n294\n00:15:11.265 --> 00:15:13.035\nJust because I don't have two\ndifferent tools to open up.\n\n295\n00:15:13.035 --> 00:15:13.605\nYou know what I mean?\n\n296\n00:15:13.605 --> 00:15:14.695\n>> Okay, that's actually a good idea.\n\n297\n00:15:14.695 --> 00:15:17.195\n>> But it's definitely your\ncall when it comes to that.\n\n298\n00:15:17.195 --> 00:15:18.875\n>> Yeah, let's do it Mike's way here and\n\n299\n00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:21.415\nthat way we'll make Mike\nfeel comfortable right away.\n\n300\n00:15:21.415 --> 00:15:24.535\nSo we'll add in that local policy and that\nway he doesn't have to open up two tools.\n\n301\n00:15:24.535 --> 00:15:27.160\nAnd I never thought about that,\nbut Mike, that's a great idea.\n\n302\n00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.860\nTo be able to add that in, then I'm simply\ngoing to select the same thing again and\n\n303\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.300\nclick Add, and this time we're\ngonna change the context here.\n\n304\n00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.250\nSo notice it says Group Policy Object.\n\n305\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.860\nI can go ahead and\nclick on this Browse button, and\n\n306\n00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.880\nthen it says to browse for\nwhat group policy object.\n\n307\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.890\nI can affect the computer,\neven another computer at this point, but\n\n308\n00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.670\nI'm gonna click on this Users tab, And\n\n309\n00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.290\nnow I can actually add in well\nthe other ones that I actually want.\n\n310\n00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.370\nSo I'm gonna select\nthe administrator's group.\n\n311\n00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.240\nYeah.\n>> Let's hold\n\n312\n00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.820\nright there-\n>> Okay.\n\n313\n00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.320\n>> For just-\n>> Sure.\n\n314\n00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.623\n>> One second cuz I do know this is\n\n315\n00:16:00.623 --> 00:16:02.928\na place where some people\nkinda slip up for a second.\n\n316\n00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:05.956\nCuz you'll notice administrator Is listed\n\n317\n00:16:05.956 --> 00:16:10.629\nthere and in administrators.\nIn order to create a user-specific GPO,\n\n318\n00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:13.320\nthe user has to have\nlogged on at least once.\n\n319\n00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.070\nIn other words,\n\n320\n00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.050\nthey have to have\na profile on that machine.\n\n321\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.135\nSo you're seeing things\nlike administrator,\n\n322\n00:16:18.135 --> 00:16:21.055\nI think Ronnie's listed up there,\nand Ronald.\n\n323\n00:16:21.055 --> 00:16:23.485\nThose are users that have profiles,\nall right?\n\n324\n00:16:23.485 --> 00:16:26.645\nAnd underneath that is administrators,\nplural.\n\n325\n00:16:26.645 --> 00:16:29.225\nIt's real easy to get the wrong one.\n\n326\n00:16:29.225 --> 00:16:33.210\nSo if you grab administrator\nThat's a user specific for\n\n327\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.400\nthat built in administrator account.\n\n328\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.230\nIf you grab administrators,\n\n329\n00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:42.080\nthat's the new local policy that applies\nto all administrators on that machine.\n\n330\n00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.990\nSo, I just wanted to make sure you\nguys saw that difference there.\n\n331\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.640\n>> Right.\n\n332\n00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.830\nAnd it's one of these things.\n\n333\n00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.530\nYou might say,\nwell why don't you just grab all of them.\n\n334\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:49.900\nWell it doesn't let you do that.\n\n335\n00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.650\nYet that should do one at a time,\nI know I've tried it,\n\n336\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:54.420\nit just doesn't allow you to do that.\n\n337\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.740\nSo I'm just going to add\nthe administrators in here and\n\n338\n00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.920\nthen click Finish, and\nnow notice it populated another link down\n\n339\n00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.830\nhere underneath the Console Root and we're\ngoing to do it a couple of more times\n\n340\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:08.670\nhere, I'm going to go ahead and click Add\nand click on the Browse button again.\n\n341\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.860\nSelect the users tab and this time I'm\ngoing to add in the non administrators.\n\n342\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.580\nSo now I have the local\npolicy administrator and\n\n343\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:21.020\nnon administrator and I'm going to do one\nmore because I want us to also take a look\n\n344\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.380\nat that user specific policy as well.\n\n345\n00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.060\nSo click on the browse button,\nclick users, and I'm going to add Ronald.\n\n346\n00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.170\nRonald is, of course, well me but\n\n347\n00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.110\nit's actually the non administrative\naccount that I have In place here.\n\n348\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.510\nSo, I'm going to click OK and\nadd that one in as well.\n\n349\n00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.320\nAnd now I have these four different\n\n350\n00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.040\nobjects that I have that it's going to end\nup populating under this console root.\n\n351\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.430\nI'm going to go ahead and click OK,\nand have all of those added in.\n\n352\n00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.270\nNow I could switch\nthe order if I wanted to.\n\n353\n00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.650\nYou saw on the right hand side\nwhere you could actually do that.\n\n354\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.830\nI'm not so worried about it right now.\n\n355\n00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.760\nThen I'm simply going to give this a name.\n\n356\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.710\nIf I know I'm going to be coming back\nhere, I'm just going to call it my\n\n357\n00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:08.360\nmultiple local policies,\nif i can spell it, editor.\n\n358\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.660\nAnd just click save.\n\n359\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.330\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n360\n00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.730\nIf you close it out and\nyou don't save it, it's not gonna save,\n\n361\n00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.650\nand you'll have to recreate\nthis again if you want to.\n\n362\n00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:21.360\nBut right here at the very beginning\nwe just wanted to go ahead and do this.\n\n363\n00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.180\nSo now, what we can actually do with each\none of these is that we can actually\n\n364\n00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.630\naffect the policy.\n\n365\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.500\nSo, remember that I have that user\naccount called Ronald in there.\n\n366\n00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.400\nAnd it's just a standard user, and\nI created that a little bit earlier.\n\n367\n00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.040\nAnd so, with that one,\nall the settings are the same.\n\n368\n00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.600\nI didn't change any of the settings.\n\n369\n00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.900\nAnd so if we were to log in as Ronald,\n\n370\n00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.360\nwe'd still see all of the same\nthings that are going on.\n\n371\n00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.380\nAnd he'd have full access to everything,\njust as a standard user.\n\n372\n00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.690\nRonnie's actually an administrator.\n\n373\n00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:49.570\nHe can run things.\n\n374\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.750\nHe can do whatever he wants to.\n\n375\n00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.420\nLet's go in and\nadd a few different policies to try and\n\n376\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.060\nsee some of the different\nchanges that we can actually do.\n\n377\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.540\nSo, I'm gonna select this\nnon administrator first.\n\n378\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.600\nCuz, that's really a lot of\ntimes who I want to limit.\n\n379\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.520\nAnd when I do that Mike,\n\n380\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.430\nI notice that it doesn't give me\nthe computer configuration here.\n\n381\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.640\nIt just gives me user.\n\n382\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.650\n>> Exactly,\nthe important part to remember there.\n\n383\n00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:16.380\nOnly the local policy has both\ncomputer settings and user settings.\n\n384\n00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.540\nThe administrators policy, the non\nadministrators policy as well as any user\n\n385\n00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.540\nspecific policies you create will\nonly have user settings, no computer\n\n386\n00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.300\nsettings are available in those policies,\nbecause it doesn't really matter to,\n\n387\n00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.090\ncomputer settings are computer settings,\ndoesn't matter who's logging on.\n\n388\n00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:35.710\nRight, so under the user configuration\nthen I have the ability to\n\n389\n00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.360\naffect some software settings if I want\nto, but what I really wanna get to is\n\n390\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.565\nunder the administrator templates and this\nis where what Mike told us we can affect.\n\n391\n00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:48.115\nThe registry, and\nalso what can show up here as well, right.\n\n392\n00:19:48.115 --> 00:19:49.745\nSo let me go to the Start menu,\n\n393\n00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:53.095\ncuz that's an easy one that we\ncan easily identify right away.\n\n394\n00:19:53.095 --> 00:19:54.175\n>> Easy to verify, yeah.\n\n395\n00:19:54.175 --> 00:19:56.630\n>> Easy to verify and\ndo some of the different things.\n\n396\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.010\nAnd you'll notice that under the start\nmenu options there are a ton of them\n\n397\n00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:05.110\nthat we can actually see now I don't know\nwhy they're listed in whatever order\n\n398\n00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.420\nI would think its\nalphabetical at some point.\n\n399\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.580\n>> You would think wouldn't you but no.\n\n400\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.200\n>> But its not its under some logic that\n>> Windows understands, but\n\n401\n00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.900\nnot under some logic that I understand.\n\n402\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.590\nSo I simply click on the Settings bar,\nso that way I at least sorted it.\n\n403\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.170\nAnd I'm gonna come underneath, here,\nand go down to where it says, oh,\n\n404\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:26.210\nRemove is what I want, cuz that's the\neasiest way that we can actually verify\n\n405\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.400\nthat these policies\nare actually taking place too.\n\n406\n00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.620\nSo, if I select like this,\nLet's see here oh.\n\n407\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.300\nRemove and prevent the shut down,\nrestart, sleep, and hibernate commands.\n\n408\n00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.730\nThat's actually a good one.\n\n409\n00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.000\nSo if I select that one and I open that\nup I'm simply gonna double click on it.\n\n410\n00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.990\nThis is the first time that if you haven't\nactually been working with the policies.\n\n411\n00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.240\nYou're actually three\ndifferent settings here.\n\n412\n00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.960\nNow, Mike, it says not\nconfigured enabled and disabled.\n\n413\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.360\nI get the enabled,\nthat seems to be logical.\n\n414\n00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.410\nBut, what about\nnon-configurative disabled?\n\n415\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.790\nThat seems to be identical.\n\n416\n00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:00.350\n>> Right?\n\n417\n00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.070\nWhen you open up one of these policies,\nthere's like you said there's hundreds and\n\n418\n00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.510\nhundreds of settings in there.\n\n419\n00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.610\nThey all start out not configured.\n\n420\n00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.160\nThat gives me the ability to go in\nthere and set which ones I want.\n\n421\n00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.300\nBasically this policy's saying,\nI don't care.\n\n422\n00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.940\nNow, we're gonna learn later on that we\nmight have other policies that are also\n\n423\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.020\napplying, like if this computer\nwas in a domain environment,\n\n424\n00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.610\nI'd have domain policies to deal with,\nas well as the local policy.\n\n425\n00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.930\nAnd we've gotta worry about\nthe way those policies combine.\n\n426\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.490\nbut for now we'll just leave it as a fact\nthat not configure means this policy\n\n427\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.650\ndoesn't care about that setting; it's not\nturning it on it's not turning it off,\n\n428\n00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.290\nit's not even going to look at it.\n\n429\n00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.550\nEnable is going to turn this\nparticular setting on; disable\n\n430\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.850\nwill turn this setting off.\n\n431\n00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.440\nNow, they've got really good\nexplanations over there\n\n432\n00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.290\nBottom right of that you've\ngot this little help area.\n\n433\n00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.690\nAnd it's really good about telling you\n\n434\n00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.610\nwhat's gonna happen if you turn this one\non, what's gonna happen if you turn this\n\n435\n00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.330\none off because it can be\ntricky sometimes, right Ronnie?\n\n436\n00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.180\nThere can be some double\nnegatives in there.\n\n437\n00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.340\n>> Yeah, and that's where you\ndo run into some issues too.\n\n438\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.560\nSo you have to read what that policy\nsays and when this one says remove and\n\n439\n00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.710\nprevent access to the shut down.\n\n440\n00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.770\n>> Well, you might think okay,\ndo I disable that,\n\n441\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.060\ndoes that mean that this\nis actually going to do it?\n\n442\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.890\nOr is it actually not going to do it?\n\n443\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.890\nSometimes you actually see that it is\na bit crazy and now you have to read them.\n\n444\n00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.285\n>> Yeah\n>> And you have to actually make sure you\n\n445\n00:22:21.285 --> 00:22:23.165\nfollow that help file to get it right.\n\n446\n00:22:23.165 --> 00:22:28.215\n>> Let's say Ronnie used the local policy\nto remove the, what is this one removing?\n\n447\n00:22:28.215 --> 00:22:29.645\n>> Shut down.\n>> The shut down and restart and\n\n448\n00:22:29.645 --> 00:22:30.885\nstop and hibernate.\n\n449\n00:22:30.885 --> 00:22:32.615\nLet's say he used the local\npolicy to do that.\n\n450\n00:22:32.615 --> 00:22:36.730\nWell, that means that applies\nto every user on that machine.\n\n451\n00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.370\nBut when when an administrator logs on, I\nneed that administrator to be able to shut\n\n452\n00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.740\nthe machine down or\nrestart it or what have you.\n\n453\n00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.600\nSo I can actually, make a, on this\nadministrator policy we can go in there\n\n454\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:53.260\nand choose disable the ability to\nprevent shut down, and all of that.\n\n455\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.910\nSo you are disabling the prevent,\n\n456\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.690\nwhich means you are actually giving\nthem the ability to do that.\n\n457\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:22:59.680\n>> it's kind of a double negative.\n\n458\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.210\nThe one I always like to use, that's\na little bit easier to understand I think,\n\n459\n00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.420\nis the prevent access to\nregistry editing tools.\n\n460\n00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.580\nI have a policy that says nobody I enable\nprevent access to registry editing tools.\n\n461\n00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.050\nThat means you're not going to get\naccess to registry editing tools.\n\n462\n00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.220\nBut, if I enable prevent access,\n\n463\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.000\nthen I'm actually ensuring that you will\nhave access to registry editing tools.\n\n464\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.410\nRight?\nIt's that double negative.\n\n465\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.970\nPrevent\n>> Or\n\n466\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.390\ndisable prevent access is\nactually enabling access.\n\n467\n00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.700\nSo it seems silly, why would we\never do anything crazy like that,\n\n468\n00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.170\nbecause sometimes we need\nto override policy, right?\n\n469\n00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.710\nI want everybody to be blocked from this,\nbut then a certain user I want to allow,\n\n470\n00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.000\nso I have to be able to\nreverse the setting later on.\n\n471\n00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.930\n>> Yeah, so when you take a look at it,\nmake sure you understand and\n\n472\n00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.480\nread the help file.\n\n473\n00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.840\nKnow whether you're going to\nbe enabling it or disabling or\n\n474\n00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.290\nif you're just going to leave it alone.\n\n475\n00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.270\nWe're simply going to do this\none policy right there and\n\n476\n00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.020\nlet's see another one\nthat we can actually do.\n\n477\n00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.140\nOh look, the prevent the user\nfrom resizing the taskbar.\n\n478\n00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:00.896\nThat's an easy one.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n479\n00:24:00.896 --> 00:24:01.433\n>> That way we\n\n480\n00:24:01.433 --> 00:24:03.827\ncan show a little bit of\ndynamic action as well.\n\n481\n00:24:03.827 --> 00:24:06.389\nAnd we'll send that one for\nthe non-administrative policy.\n\n482\n00:24:06.389 --> 00:24:08.159\nHere's something that really does help.\n\n483\n00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:11.265\nSince all these policies are on\nthis one management console,\n\n484\n00:24:11.265 --> 00:24:14.729\nI can simply go back up to\nthe administrator's policy here and then,\n\n485\n00:24:14.729 --> 00:24:19.190\nwe can actually configure those settings\nat the same time, if we wanted to.\n\n486\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.120\nSo let's say on the desktop here,\nnotice that I can,\n\n487\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.370\nas the administrator I want to hide\nthe Internet Explorer icon on the desktop,\n\n488\n00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.330\nor any of these other icons\nwe can do that as well.\n\n489\n00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:33.420\nUsually we don't but\nlet's just go ahead and do that.\n\n490\n00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.350\nActually that's not on my desktop is it?\n\n491\n00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.992\n>> No I was gonna say I don't\nthink we have an IE icon anymore.\n\n492\n00:24:38.992 --> 00:24:40.640\n>> [CROSSTALK] So let's see here.\n\n493\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.218\nOh let me.\n\n494\n00:24:43.218 --> 00:24:46.360\nI'm trying to think of\non the Control Panel.\n\n495\n00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.400\nLet's go ahead and do that Ooh,\nwe can do that too.\n\n496\n00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:56.160\nWe can hide, Under admins.\n\n497\n00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.260\n>> Let's go to the Add and\n\n498\n00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.090\nRemove Programs and we can add and\n>> Where's that help right\n\n499\n00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.030\nin down in there?\n\n500\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.460\nThat's good enough.\n\n501\n00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.870\n>> Yeah,\nthis will actually end up working.\n\n502\n00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.980\nPlus, I'm just trying to add in\na policy here for the administrators.\n\n503\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.600\nNothing really big and gigantic.\n\n504\n00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.600\nAnd so\nwe can actually add those two settings.\n\n505\n00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.460\nAnd I'm trying to get back down\nto the user policy, Ronald,\n\n506\n00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.240\nunder the user configuration, and\n\n507\n00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.090\nif I expand out administrative templates\nI'm going to go to the desktop here.\n\n508\n00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.445\nThere was one that I was looking\na little bit earlier that prevents from\n\n509\n00:25:30.445 --> 00:25:35.140\nchanging the desktop background here.\n\n510\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.428\nSo let me see if I can\nactually do that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n511\n00:25:39.428 --> 00:25:42.998\nI can.\n\n512\n00:25:42.998 --> 00:25:45.959\nI think this is it.\n\n513\n00:25:45.959 --> 00:25:48.390\nSpecifies the background and\n>> And\n\n514\n00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.180\nyou gotta have a bitmap to point it to,\nI think.\n\n515\n00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.200\n>> Tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n516\n00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.050\nwhy don't we see what your settings are\nnow and then what we can do is we can use\n\n517\n00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.630\nthat user specific one to maybe\noverride that non-administrators.\n\n518\n00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.200\n>> Let's do it.\n\n519\n00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.140\n>> Let's try that.\n\n520\n00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.660\n>> So, Mike,\nI don't see a save setting here.\n\n521\n00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.690\n>> What?\n\n522\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.630\n>> Yeah, so what do I do?\n\n523\n00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:06.590\nThere's no save button.\n\n524\n00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:09.180\n>> You just close it and hope\n>> Keep your fingers crossed.\n\n525\n00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.540\nNo, when you're editing\npolicies there is no save.\n\n526\n00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.460\nAll your changes are being saved real\ntime so you don't have to worry about it.\n\n527\n00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.520\nYou just close it.\n\n528\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.360\nWhen it asks you save it, what it's really\ntalking about is saving your console.\n\n529\n00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.720\nYou might have added another snap in or\nremoved a snap in or changed a snap in.\n\n530\n00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.900\nThat's what it's asking you to save.\n\n531\n00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.430\nAll your changes you've\nmade in the policy itself.\n\n532\n00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.330\n>> Their still going to be there.\n\n533\n00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.560\nThose are already taken care off.\n\n534\n00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.980\n>> So let me go and log of here.\n\n535\n00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:38.200\nAnd I'm going to log back in as\nRonald the non administrator policy.\n\n536\n00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.960\nHopefully we'll kick in, right, because we\nactually only have user configurations.\n\n537\n00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.470\nIt should kick in next time we log on\n,rRemember that sometimes you actually\n\n538\n00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:50.170\nhave to log on first, and you may have to\nlog off and log back in to make it work.\n\n539\n00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.890\nI've seen that happen a couple of times,\n\n540\n00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.630\nbut on this one I've already\npreviously logged on as Ronald before.\n\n541\n00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:03.330\nAnd then if I go the the startup here and\nI select that.\n\n542\n00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.410\nOh, look at that.\n\n543\n00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:05.760\nIt only allows me to switch users in lock.\n\n544\n00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.140\nIt doesn't look like I\ncan shut down at all.\n\n545\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.030\nSo it looks like that policy\nis actually applying.\n\n546\n00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.480\nBut now the key\n>> Can\n\n547\n00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.350\nyou resize your task bar down there?\n\n548\n00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.630\n>> Let's see if I can\nresize my task bar as well.\n\n549\n00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:23.610\nNope, I can't actually resize\nmy task bar let me see, yep.\n\n550\n00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:24.524\n>> You can unlock it.\n\n551\n00:27:24.524 --> 00:27:26.410\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> You can unlock it.\n\n552\n00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.630\n>> Can resize it.\n\n553\n00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.240\n>> Yep.\nBut\n\n554\n00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.600\nit doesn't actually allow me to pull and\ndrag it out and resize that thing.\n\n555\n00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.960\nSo it is actually preventing that action\nand that looks like it works now.\n\n556\n00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.100\nThe thing is that even though I log off,\nwhat we're hoping is that\n\n557\n00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.840\nthat setting doesn't come through\non the administrators too.\n\n558\n00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.370\nSo now if I log in as Ronald.\n\n559\n00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.476\nIf I actually type in\nthe password correctly.\n\n560\n00:27:47.476 --> 00:27:48.680\nOops see.\n\n561\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.680\n>> [LAUGH] It's that really\ncomplex password for\n\n562\n00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.476\nthat administrator account right?\n\n563\n00:27:54.476 --> 00:27:56.489\n>> [LAUGH] Sure enough.\n\n564\n00:27:56.489 --> 00:28:02.760\n[LAUGH] So, here, now that we have it,\nlet's see if I can actually hover on this.\n\n565\n00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.530\n>> Might have to unlock it.\n\n566\n00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:05.210\n>> Oh yeah, that's right.\n\n567\n00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.010\nNow it looks like I can\nactually drag that one up.\n\n568\n00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.000\nThat looks good.\n\n569\n00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.730\nAnd if I go into control panel.\n\n570\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:20.470\nThe add or remove programs,\nit's actually a feature probably.\n\n571\n00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.600\nI was thinking.\n\n572\n00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.970\nNotice that, yeah, she does give\nme that ability to uninstall.\n\n573\n00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.160\nBut I think that add and\n\n574\n00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.370\nremove program comes in the earlier\nedition of Windows is what I chose.\n\n575\n00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:33.250\nBut we actually see that this\npolicy is not applying right here.\n\n576\n00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.060\nNow if we actually needed it to where\nthat she only applies in that user,\n\n577\n00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:36.990\nwe can go in and change it.\n\n578\n00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.725\n>> Yeah, let's this.\nSo we know at this point when we set that\n\n579\n00:28:39.725 --> 00:28:43.310\nnon-administrator policy,\nso when Ronald Logged on.\n\n580\n00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.900\nHe was unable to change\nthe size of the taskbar, and\n\n581\n00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.930\nyou couldn't shut the machine down.\n\n582\n00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.880\n>> Right.\n>> Now what we gotta do is take that\n\n583\n00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.460\nuser specific policy for Ronald, and\n\n584\n00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.500\ndisable the ability to change\nthe size of that toolbar.\n\n585\n00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.990\nAnd so what should happen is\nthat user's specific policy\n\n586\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:06.180\nshould override the non-administrator's\npolicy that's preventing Ronald\n\n587\n00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.340\nfrom being able to change that.\n\n588\n00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.030\nSo if we can find that same setting,\nthat's the trick.\n\n589\n00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.560\nIf I can remember where that was.\n\n590\n00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.470\nI think it was prevent.\n\n591\n00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.600\n>> Let's see if I can\nactually find it here.\n\n592\n00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:28.580\nPrevent users from moving the task bar,\nor from resizing the task bar.\n\n593\n00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.310\nSo this one is not configured here.\n\n594\n00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.590\n>> And so you might think well why\ndon't you just leave it not configured?\n\n595\n00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.650\n>> Remember the other policy\nprevents his ability to do that.\n\n596\n00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:41.060\nSo if I make a second policy that\ndoesn't care, leaving it not configured.\n\n597\n00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.680\nThen, that first policy is\ngoing to carry through and\n\n598\n00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.190\nhe is not going to be able to change it.\n\n599\n00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:48.720\nBy disabling that setting, that's going\nto counteract the enabling that the other\n\n600\n00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.440\nthe policy did and this one user should\nbe able to re-size their task bar.\n\n601\n00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.790\n>> All right.\n>> As far as non-administrators go.\n\n602\n00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:56.440\n>> All right.\n\n603\n00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.230\nSo, that's at least what\nthe help file says here.\n\n604\n00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.590\nBecause now,\nonce we actually have the local or\n\n605\n00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.620\nthe non-administrators and\nthis particular policy here.\n\n606\n00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.330\nLet's go ahead and close that.\n\n607\n00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.500\n>> And while he's getting that machine,\n\n608\n00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.460\nhe's gonna log off and\nlog back on as Ronald.\n\n609\n00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.870\nI wanna make sure we understand too,\n\n610\n00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.300\nthe importance of the policies that\nare applied are very important,\n\n611\n00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.700\nbecause the last policy that's applied\ncan override the previous policy.\n\n612\n00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.860\nWhich is exactly what we're\ntaking advantage of here,\n\n613\n00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.470\nthe local policy applies first.\n\n614\n00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.320\nThen either the administrator's or\nnon administrator's, whichever one you're\n\n615\n00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.860\nlogging on as, administrator or\nnon administrator, is going to apply.\n\n616\n00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.270\nThen a user specific policy applies.\n\n617\n00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:40.930\nSo because the non administrator's policy\nsays prevent the ability to change that\n\n618\n00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:45.810\ntask bar, but then after that's applied\nthe user specific one applies and\n\n619\n00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.220\nit says you can change the task bar size.\n\n620\n00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.680\nThat last one should win, and you\nshould be able to resize that task bar.\n\n621\n00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.140\n>> Also, because Ronald is\napart of the non-administrator,\n\n622\n00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.500\nnotice that the other\npolicy still applies too.\n\n623\n00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.330\nHe still doesn't have the option\nto be able to shutdown.\n\n624\n00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:00.040\nHe can log off.\n\n625\n00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.240\nHe can do all that.\n\n626\n00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.930\nBut now because we've disabled that one\npolicy that we had enabled earlier,\n\n627\n00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:09.530\nnow if I just make sure it's\nunlocked there, if I hover,\n\n628\n00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:16.180\nnotice I can actually drag and\nwe can now resize that task bar as well.\n\n629\n00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.850\nMost of the time we're probably not\ngoing to actually do to many policies on\n\n630\n00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:23.140\nthe administrator side, usually we\ndon't but if you needed to, you can.\n\n631\n00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.130\nAnd that way you can have different\npolicies, whether it's an administrator or\n\n632\n00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:27.290\na non-administrator.\n\n633\n00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.050\nIf you need that to be overwritten for\n\n634\n00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.590\none particular user, you also have\nactually been able to see that here, too.\n\n635\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.470\n>> Absolutely.\n\n636\n00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.830\n>> So it's a really great technology\nthat we can take advantage of.\n\n637\n00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.470\nIn that small situation small\noffice home office situation or\n\n638\n00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.760\nwhen people are actually sharing computers\nand you don't want one user to have\n\n639\n00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.030\ntoo much control over it but\nyou do want to actually have some user to\n\n640\n00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.135\nbe administrator over it you can\nactually set those policies different.\n\n641\n00:31:51.135 --> 00:31:52.165\nSo, its a really good technology.\n\n642\n00:31:52.165 --> 00:31:54.935\n>> I really love it I think\nit's something that is a great\n\n643\n00:31:54.935 --> 00:31:57.825\nnew feature like I said it\nstarted with Windows Vista.\n\n644\n00:31:57.825 --> 00:32:01.675\nScenarios where I've got\nRonnie as an employee and\n\n645\n00:32:01.675 --> 00:32:04.170\nhe's not an administrator\non that local machine.\n\n646\n00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:07.510\nLet's say I want to prevent\nall the users on that machine\n\n647\n00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.540\nfrom accessing Regedit tools, right?\n\n648\n00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.540\nNone of them are administrators, so I use\nmy non-administrator's policy to block\n\n649\n00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.720\nall users that use that machine\nfrom editing the registry.\n\n650\n00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.840\nThat helps keep that machine safe\nfrom accidental modification and\n\n651\n00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.170\nkeeps the machine up and running, right?\n\n652\n00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.650\nThat's a good thing, usually.\n\n653\n00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.060\nBut let's say I've got one employee,\n\n654\n00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.680\nRonald, that I trust enough to edit the\nregistry if something needs to be done.\n\n655\n00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.400\nI could make him an administrator, but\n\n656\n00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.040\nthat would give him much more permissions\nthan just being able to edit the registry.\n\n657\n00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.260\nSo now what I can do is I can\nuse that user specific policy\n\n658\n00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:45.260\nto override the non administrators and\nallow just Ronald to modify the registry.\n\n659\n00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.570\nI didn't have to make him\nan admin on the machine and\n\n660\n00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.860\nthat gives him full control\nover the entire machine.\n\n661\n00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.610\nI didn't have to allow all my\nnon-administrators to edit the registry.\n\n662\n00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.080\nSo it gives me that granular\ncontrol that I really need.\n\n663\n00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.180\nEspecially when I'm not\nin a domain environment.\n\n664\n00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.090\nI don't have access to\ndomain based policies.\n\n665\n00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.490\n>> It's a really neat way for\nus to have that type of control.\n\n666\n00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.720\nAnd something that we're gonna run into\nespecially because we are going to be\n\n667\n00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.410\nthe ones supporting desktop users as well.\n\n668\n00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.910\nNow in a small environment, works great.\n\n669\n00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.990\nBut in a larger environment,\n\n670\n00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:19.360\nwe're gonna see that that now becomes\nhaving to manage every single machine.\n\n671\n00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.400\nAnd so, that actually means\nthat we're gonna end up talking\n\n672\n00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.120\nabout Active Directory Group Policy,\nbut I think that's for another episode.\n\n673\n00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.660\n>> I think we'll save that Ronnie.\n\n674\n00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.530\nWe'll come back and we'll talk about other\nways we can configure those settings,\n\n675\n00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.220\nlike you said, from a more centralized\napproach when we get into those larger\n\n676\n00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.340\nenvironments, those domain\nbased environments.\n\n677\n00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.940\nAnd so,\nthat was a lot of good information Ronnie.\n\n678\n00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.990\nAnything else we wanna throw\nin on the local policies?\n\n679\n00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.680\n>> Just take your time in\ngoing through some of those,\n\n680\n00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.540\neven if you're not setting them yet,\nright?\n\n681\n00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.090\nGoing through and taking a look\nat what you can configure and\n\n682\n00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.805\nwhat you can log down, it's amazing\nwhen you actually take a look at it.\n\n683\n00:33:52.805 --> 00:33:55.350\nThere's hundreds if not\nthousands of those things\n\n684\n00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.290\nthat you actually can take advantage of.\n\n685\n00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.990\nYou're not gonna take\nadvantage of every single one,\n\n686\n00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.336\nat least I don't think you will\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n687\n00:34:01.336 --> 00:34:02.770\n>> But at the same there\n\n688\n00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:07.900\nare some that will help you incredibly\nmanage your small network very easily.\n\n689\n00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.440\n>> Absolutely.\n\n690\n00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.300\nAlright well we wanna thank everybody for\ntuning in Signing off for\n\n691\n00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.020\nITProTV I'm Mike

and\n\n3\n00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.401\nwith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:17.210\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.150\n>> I'm doing fine today.\n\n6\n00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.490\nIt's another great day\nthat we get to be in here.\n\n7\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.310\nTake a look at some Windows 7\nadministration and ready to get started.\n\n8\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.830\n>> All right.\n\n9\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.280\nWell, today we're gonna be diving\ninto Group policy, and in particular,\n\n10\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.980\ndomain based policies, right?\n\n11\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.680\nAnd in our previous episode,\nwe talked about local policies, and\n\n12\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.690\nwe said how every Windows machine has\na local policy and in Windows seven,\n\n13\n00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.860\nthere's actually four separate local\npolicies that we can take advantage of.\n\n14\n00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.800\nThat local policy, the administrator's\npolicy, the non-administrator's policy.\n\n15\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.890\nPolicy and that user specific GPO,\nor policy, that we can create.\n\n16\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.930\nBut we also said that those are really\nuseful in non-domain environments.\n\n17\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.740\nSmall places.\n\n18\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.273\nBecause those policies only\napply to that one machine.\n\n19\n00:01:00.273 --> 00:01:03.275\nIn a domain-based environment and\nlarger environments,\n\n20\n00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:06.375\nwe really don't wanna have to\ntouch every single machine.\n\n21\n00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:10.985\nThat might be a lot of machines in\nthe office that we work at, 100s, 1,000s.\n\n22\n00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:14.182\nThey might be scattered all across\nthe country all All around the globe.\n\n23\n00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:17.692\nAnd I need to be able to make\nconfiguration changes to them.\n\n24\n00:01:17.692 --> 00:01:21.552\nAnd that's where my domain-based\ngroup policy comes into play.\n\n25\n00:01:21.552 --> 00:01:26.320\nNow as a Windows 7 technician,\nwe might not be able to.\n\n26\n00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.650\nCreate group policies or make new\npolicies, link policies, things like that.\n\n27\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.920\nWell, we do need to be aware of\nhow they can affect my machine or\n\n28\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.420\nmy end-user's machine.\n\n29\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.500\nWhen it comes to troubleshooting,\nwhy is this setting configured?\n\n30\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.080\nWhy can't I change it?\n\n31\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.450\nWhere's this Coming from that kind of\nthing, or being able to troubleshoot that.\n\n32\n00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.690\nAnd if we have to we escalate it up to\nthe next level of help, of tech support.\n\n33\n00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.830\n>> Right, when we start talking a look\nat the idea of the domain group policy,\n\n34\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.430\nit's real easy to think it's an all or\nnothing type of configuration that we do.\n\n35\n00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.840\nWe can't implement a policy that\napplies throughout the entire domain,\n\n36\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.210\nto every machine, every single user.\n\n37\n00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.280\nBut you'll notice that as your\nnetwork gets bigger, that's when you\n\n38\n00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.150\nstart separating out and becoming\na little bit more and more specialized.\n\n39\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.860\nYou may end up with\nan administration department.\n\n40\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.640\nYou may end up with\na marketing department.\n\n41\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.190\nYou may end up with research and\n\n42\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.080\ndevelopment and everything else\nthat you have underneath the sun.\n\n43\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.350\nAnd all of a sudden you realize that\none policy's not gonna apply to,\n\n44\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.030\nor one policy that we have is not gonna\napply to all those different groupings or\n\n45\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.280\nthose different departments.\n\n46\n00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.860\nBut we're actually gonna need\nmultiple policies to do so.\n\n47\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.670\nAnd we may have hundreds of users,\n\n48\n00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.240\n50 users, thousands of users in each one\nof those different departments here And\n\n49\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.670\nthe idea of actually being able to\nunderstand how they can apply, and\n\n50\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.550\nwhat we must look for as technicians,\nto be able to come back and\n\n51\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.580\nactually see did that policy apply\ncorrectly, or did it not apply?\n\n52\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.995\nIf it didn't apply, Why didn't it apply\nand what can we do to troubleshoot that?\n\n53\n00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:56.265\nSo, I wanna take a look at some\nof the different settings and\n\n54\n00:02:56.265 --> 00:03:00.405\nsome of the different ways that we can go\nabout examining that, so that we can be\n\n55\n00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:03.767\na little bit more effective when it comes\nto troubleshooting group policy And\n\n56\n00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.087\neven seeing how it's implemented and\n\n57\n00:03:05.087 --> 00:03:08.857\nunderstanding the basics behind\nhow group policies also apply.\n\n58\n00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:10.017\n>> Exactly.\n\n59\n00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:12.117\nAll right so let's start by taking a look.\n\n60\n00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:14.557\nI have, let's find that machine here,\n\n61\n00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:17.897\nI've got a Windows 7 machine\nthat we're gonna use.\n\n62\n00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:23.877\nAnd I'm gonna start,\nI'm logged on as a user account that,\n\n63\n00:03:23.877 --> 00:03:26.157\nI think this guy's actually\nin the domain admin group.\n\n64\n00:03:26.157 --> 00:03:28.690\nWe'll find out here.\n\n65\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.210\nAnd the first thing I'm gonna do is what,\nwhere should we start.\n\n66\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.410\nLet's take a look.\n\n67\n00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.390\nLet's say I go to this machine, and I want\nto change my screen saver timeout, right.\n\n68\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.780\nI can right-click > Personalize,\nand I can go down to screen saver.\n\n69\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.120\nAnd I can see that I can pick what\nscreensaver I want to use, but\n\n70\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.800\nmy wait is set to ten minutes, and\nit's grayed out, I can't change that.\n\n71\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.570\nIt's also gonna do a password\nprotect the screensaver.\n\n72\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.340\nMeaning when I wake it\nup from the screensaver,\n\n73\n00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.250\nI've got to put in my password.\n\n74\n00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.690\nThat's so annoying,\nI want to uncheck that.\n\n75\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.960\nAnd it won't let me.\n\n76\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.510\nAll right.\n\n77\n00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.480\nAnd I'm an admin on this machine.\n\n78\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.790\nSo Ronnie,\nwhat could be the problem there?\n\n79\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.380\n>> The problem could actually\nbe that someone has gone in and\n\n80\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.200\nactually disabled those.\n\n81\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.580\nA lot of times you'll actually see\nthat you'll get some notification that\n\n82\n00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.600\nhey this setting has actually been\nmodified by an administrator.\n\n83\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.890\nAnd that means you're not gonna be able\nto change it if that's actually happened.\n\n84\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.820\nSo you actually have to discover where\nthat might actually be taking place.\n\n85\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.930\nSo the next point here is if there's\nsomething that we can't modify and\n\n86\n00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.150\nwe're supposed to be able to do it,\n\n87\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150\nit's trying to figure out what could\nhave caused that, and a lot of times\n\n88\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.970\nit is the application of some type\nof policy that's been pushed out.\n\n89\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.850\nAnd it actually has applied to my\nmachine or to my user account.\n\n90\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.280\n>> And that's right so when we use domain\nbased policies to manager our devices and\n\n91\n00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.480\nour users when those policies\napply to that end system or\n\n92\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.430\nto that user\n>> They lock the user interface typically.\n\n93\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.900\nNow there are policies and preferences and\nwe'll dive into those guys\n\n94\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.790\nin a different episode but most of\nthose settings lock the user interface.\n\n95\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.090\nThat means the end user can't undo it.\n\n96\n00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.870\nAnd we want that, right?\n\n97\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.150\nThat's so that they can't change.\n\n98\n00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.750\nLike maybe our security policy says\nEvery computer must use a ten-minute\n\n99\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.580\nscreensaver timeout and\nmust password protect the screensaver.\n\n100\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.640\nThe users don’t like that.\n\n101\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.710\nThey don’t wanna have to type in their\npassword every time their computer goes to\n\n102\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.770\nsleep or that screensaver kicks in.\n\n103\n00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.756\nSo they’re gonna try to undo it.\n\n104\n00:05:20.756 --> 00:05:25.090\nIf I just right-click on the desktop and\nset that on their machine,\n\n105\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.870\nlike if I went to every machine and\ndid that, they could go in and\n\n106\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.780\nuncheck it if they were\nadministrators on the machine.\n\n107\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.050\nIf I use a domain based policy\nto configure that setting\n\n108\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.950\nthey can't change it.\n\n109\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.940\nAs you just saw, I can't go in there and\n\n110\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.210\nchange it,\neven though I'm an administrator.\n\n111\n00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.570\nEven if I was the domain admin.\n\n112\n00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.600\nWhich that account actually is.\n\n113\n00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.320\nI'm a domain administrator,\nfull control over the entire domain.\n\n114\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.210\nI cannot undo that setting because\nroot policy is locking it down.\n\n115\n00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.140\nAll right?\n\n116\n00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.100\nSo that's the first thing we have\nto really understand when we're\n\n117\n00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.470\ntroubleshooting is, if we find settings\nthat can't be changed by the end user that\n\n118\n00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.300\nare grayed out like that Odds\nare that's a group policy.\n\n119\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.650\nThat's something that your domain admins\nor your IT people have implemented\n\n120\n00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.780\nacross the network and their not\nsupposed to be able to change it.\n\n121\n00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.890\nSo it's nothing you can fix it's nothing\nthat we can do about it you know it's\n\n122\n00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.460\npart of my company's policy.\n\n123\n00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.450\n>> Now Mike there comes\nthis point though what if\n\n124\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.100\nwhat's happened here is that somebody's\nactually set this on the local\n\n125\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.440\npolicy\n>> But\n\n126\n00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.010\nit could be that somebody also set\nit on the domain policy as well.\n\n127\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.130\nSo how do we figure that one?\n\n128\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.310\nWhat's the easiest way\nto take a look at that?\n\n129\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.220\n>> It is important that we understand\nthe order that these policies are being\n\n130\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.000\napplied in because as an end user\nI'm an administrator on this system.\n\n131\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.110\nI can go change my local policy,\nmaybe I try to override.\n\n132\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.920\nOkay I don't want to use their\nten minute Screensaver timeout.\n\n133\n00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.810\nI'm gonna go make a local policy that says\nI don't use a screensaver at all, and\n\n134\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.580\nI don't have the password protected.\n\n135\n00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.830\nWell, the way policies are applied, the\norder they're applied is local policies\n\n136\n00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.570\nfirst, then any policies linked to\nthe site, the active directory site,\n\n137\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.860\nthen policies that are linked to\nthe active directory domain, And\n\n138\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.100\nthen policies that are linked\nto the active directory OU and\n\n139\n00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.590\nthen if there's any nest OUs with\npolicies linked those would come next.\n\n140\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.230\nSo it's local site domain OU and\nthen nested OU.\n\n141\n00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.160\nLSDO gotta remember that and what that,\n\n142\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.560\nbecause the last policy,\npolicies that are applied later.\n\n143\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.510\nCan override policies\nthat are applied earlier.\n\n144\n00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.170\nSo think about it.\n\n145\n00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.020\nLocal, site, domain, OU.\n\n146\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.350\nLocal's applied first.\n\n147\n00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.220\nThat means any policy at\nthe site level can override that.\n\n148\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.970\nAny at the domain level can\noverride that local policy.\n\n149\n00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.880\nAnd OU policies can\noverride that local policy.\n\n150\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.760\nSo even though I try to change\nit with my local policy\n\n151\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.100\nWhich I could do because\nI'm an administrator.\n\n152\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.900\nAs soon as that domain policy applies\nit's gonna change it right back and\n\n153\n00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.890\nI'm gonna have a 10 minute\nscreen saver time-out.\n\n154\n00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.630\nAnd I'm not going to\nbe able to uncheck it.\n\n155\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.040\nSo by using those domain policies, you\nknow, again locking that user interface,\n\n156\n00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.389\nusers are gonna have a real hard\ntime trying to get around that.\n\n157\n00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:55.211\nThey're not gonna be able to.\n\n158\n00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:58.510\nNow, the opposite is.\n\n159\n00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.760\nWhat if there's a setting that's\nbeing- what if there's a setting not\n\n160\n00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.515\nbeing applied?\n\n161\n00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:05.950\nAnd that's another common troubleshooting\nthing that we have to deal with.\n\n162\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.220\nThere's a setting that should be applied.\n\n163\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.870\nThis person should not be able to,\nlet's say Say,\n\n164\n00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.930\naccess the registry editing tools.\n\n165\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.830\nYet, they’re still able to access\nthe registry editing tools.\n\n166\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.810\nAnd we use group polices for\nall kinds of things,\n\n167\n00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.300\nnot only to create security settings,\nto lock the system down,\n\n168\n00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.330\nto prevent them from getting to things\nthey don’t need to be getting into.\n\n169\n00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.580\nParticularly shortcuts on their desktop,\nto map drives, any number of things.\n\n170\n00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.300\nOr, to install software.\n\n171\n00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.970\nUser comes to me and\n\n172\n00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.780\nsays hey, everybody else in the sales\ndepartment has Excel installed.\n\n173\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.510\nMy computer doesn't have Excel.\n\n174\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.870\nWhat's wrong?\n\n175\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.630\nWe know, we should know as working for the\nIT Help Desk, that we use a group policy,\n\n176\n00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.230\nfor example, to install Excel.\n\n177\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.220\nWell we need to troubleshoot.\n\n178\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.130\nWhy didn't this person\nget access to Excel?\n\n179\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.480\nWhy wasn't it installed on their machine.\n\n180\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.444\nAnd there's several tools,\nRonnie, that we can use.\n\n181\n00:08:55.444 --> 00:08:57.445\nThe first one you'd wanna use,\n\n182\n00:08:57.445 --> 00:09:02.280\nis probably the easiest one if you're\nat the machine, is known as GP result.\n\n183\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.950\nAnd this is just a way to look and\n\n184\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:09.410\nsee what policies are being applied to\nthe system, which ones are in effect.\n\n185\n00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.662\nUsing the GPResult is normally a command\nline utility that you end up running.\n\n186\n00:09:13.662 --> 00:09:17.568\nAnd you can output that directly in\nthe command line itself, or you can even\n\n187\n00:09:17.568 --> 00:09:21.722\nactually go ahead and output that maybe to\nan HTML file, or to you in a text file if\n\n188\n00:09:21.722 --> 00:09:25.938\nyou wanted to, and that normally shows\nthe name of the policies that are actually\n\n189\n00:09:25.938 --> 00:09:30.000\nbeing applied and shows you a little bit\nmore about the structure of doing it.\n\n190\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.280\nAnd so Mike, are you gonna show us that?\n\n191\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.300\n>> Oh yeah.\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n192\n00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.240\nSo I'm gonna open up the command prompt.\n\n193\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.118\nI actually got it pinned down here.\n\n194\n00:09:35.118 --> 00:09:39.148\nNow, first thing I wanna show you\nis another one of those little\n\n195\n00:09:39.148 --> 00:09:43.787\ncaveats that I like to talk about that\nkind of get us confused sometimes,\n\n196\n00:09:43.787 --> 00:09:47.420\nlet me up my font a wee bit so\nwe can see this better.\n\n197\n00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.280\nSo I'm logged in as an administrator.\n\n198\n00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.184\nRemember, Windows 7 has that pesky\nlittle UAC that kicks in and\n\n199\n00:09:53.184 --> 00:09:57.607\nkeeps me from doing stupid things\nlogged on as the administrator right?\n\n200\n00:09:57.607 --> 00:10:01.455\nSo I'm gonna come in open up\na command prompt and the command is\n\n201\n00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:06.265\ngpresult all right now there's other\nswitches you could use with gp result,\n\n202\n00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:08.352\nand you can see some of them here.\n\n203\n00:10:08.352 --> 00:10:11.981\nAll I did was gpresult /?.\n\n204\n00:10:11.981 --> 00:10:16.068\nThe one we're really after is this R,\nright?\n\n205\n00:10:16.068 --> 00:10:20.576\nThe /R displays what's known as the RSOP,\nor\n\n206\n00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:24.282\nthe resultant set of policy, right?\n\n207\n00:10:24.282 --> 00:10:28.006\nAll the policies that are being applied\nget their, it's cumulative, right?\n\n208\n00:10:28.006 --> 00:10:31.850\nFirst the local, then site policies,\nthen domain policies, then OU policies.\n\n209\n00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.289\nIt's all cumulative.\n\n210\n00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:36.168\nIt's like layers on layers\nof policies being applied.\n\n211\n00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:40.432\nAnd the ones that are applied later can\noverride settings that are applied earlier\n\n212\n00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:44.381\nand so a lot of times what we really need\nto know is in the end, take everything\n\n213\n00:10:44.381 --> 00:10:48.684\ninto consideration, all the different\npolicies from all the different places.\n\n214\n00:10:48.684 --> 00:10:50.541\nWhat am I left with?\n\n215\n00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:53.200\nWhat is my resultant set of policies,\nright?\n\n216\n00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.140\nRSOP.\n\n217\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.996\nSo that's what we're gonna do,\ngpresult /r Is going to\n\n218\n00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:03.360\ngive me that RSOP or\nthat result instead of policy.\n\n219\n00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.580\nSo let that run for a second and\nwhat I want you to notice is that one,\n\n220\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.700\nI get my results, but\nmy results are not quite complete.\n\n221\n00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.620\nRemember we talked about, in a previous\nepisode, we've seen that group policies or\n\n222\n00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.600\npolicies in general are typically\ndivided into two components.\n\n223\n00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.160\nThere's computer settings that apply\nto the computer when it starts up, and\n\n224\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.980\nthen there's user settings that apply\nto the user when the user logs on.\n\n225\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.040\nWell, all I see in this\nresult is user settings.\n\n226\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.290\nI don't see any computer settings.\n\n227\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.170\nThat's because I ran this command\nprompt without administrative access.\n\n228\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.330\nSo as an end user or\neven as an administrator,\n\n229\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.400\nif I don't get the command\nprompt administrative access,\n\n230\n00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.200\nit only shows me the result and\nset for the user itself.\n\n231\n00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.890\nIf I close this command prompt,\nand I open a command prompt,\n\n232\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:02.060\nand we do a little administrative access,\nrun as administrator, And say yes to that.\n\n233\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.901\nAnd we'll adjust that real quick, so\n\n234\n00:12:06.901 --> 00:12:10.239\nwe can see that on screen.\n\n235\n00:12:10.239 --> 00:12:16.136\nAnd same command,\nI'm just gonna do a gpresult /r\n\n236\n00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:22.243\nAnd we should see that my results\nlook a little bit different.\n\n237\n00:12:22.243 --> 00:12:23.171\n>> More, yep.\n\n238\n00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:23.706\n>> Right.\n\n239\n00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:27.650\nI've still got those user settings that\nwe were looking at just a second ago, but\n\n240\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.210\nif I scroll back up,\nI also have computer settings.\n\n241\n00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.980\nSo that's one of the things you\ngot to keep in mind when you're\n\n242\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.980\ntroubleshooting or using this tool.\n\n243\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.210\nWho you run it as is gonna\naffect the results that you get.\n\n244\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.980\n>> And it's right here that,\nwhen you see that resultant set of policy,\n\n245\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.240\nwhat we're really looking for, especially\nbeginning in that troubleshooting,\n\n246\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.540\nis right there where it says\napplied group policy objects.\n\n247\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.900\nIf you know the names of your policies,\n\n248\n00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.760\nyou know this is what I'm expecting\nto see, it really does help.\n\n249\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.644\nNow, if you don't know,\na little bit more challenging.\n\n250\n00:12:56.644 --> 00:12:57.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n251\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.080\nAnd I've laid out a little scenario here.\n\n252\n00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.015\nI've got a couple of user accounts.\n\n253\n00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:04.242\nI've got one for Mike,\nI've got one for Ronnie, and\n\n254\n00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:09.160\nin this little fictitious network,\nboth of us are in the IT department.\n\n255\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.290\nNow I've got a policy in place that's\nblocking regedit tools, all right.\n\n256\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.370\nSo for\nthe most of the users in the domain,\n\n257\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.970\nthey're not going to\nget access to regedit.\n\n258\n00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.690\nSo let me show you.\n\n259\n00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:25.040\nWell actually before we go away here, to\ncontinue on with what Ronnie was saying.\n\n260\n00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.270\nYeah always looking at\nthe applied group policy objects.\n\n261\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.680\nThat's really what we're looking at.\n\n262\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.560\nWhich policies were applied,\nalso which ones weren't applied.\n\n263\n00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.560\nSometimes that can be just as important.\n\n264\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.140\nI can figure out why that\npolicy is not applied.\n\n265\n00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.440\nOh well it's empty, right,\nsomething like that.\n\n266\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.297\nAll right, let me log off of here.\n\n267\n00:13:44.729 --> 00:13:49.790\nAnd I'm gonna log on as a user named Nate.\n\n268\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.589\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n269\n00:13:52.589 --> 00:13:54.666\nSo we'll do a little switch user.\n\n270\n00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:56.547\nOther user.\n\n271\n00:13:56.547 --> 00:13:57.929\nNate.\n\n272\n00:14:01.418 --> 00:14:02.011\nAnd I'm gonna login.\n\n273\n00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:06.304\nAnd I've got a policy in place\nalready that's blocking RegEdit so\n\n274\n00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:10.534\nnone of my Users should be able\nto access registry editing tools.\n\n275\n00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:15.590\nSo it's making Nate's desktop up here.\n\n276\n00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.400\nI forgot I haven't logged in as Nate yet\non this particular machine so\n\n277\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.940\nit's gotta build my profile and that kind\nof thing and apply those policies, right?\n\n278\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.660\nThis is one of the things that it's\ndoing during that sign on process.\n\n279\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.416\nYou know, so while Nate's\nprofile is actually being built,\n\n280\n00:14:30.416 --> 00:14:33.914\nremember that what we're trying to do\nhere is we're trying to make sure that we\n\n281\n00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:37.640\nactually are seeing these policies apply\nor whether we're not seeing them apply.\n\n282\n00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.078\nAnd so by using that gpresult\nthat we were taking a look at,\n\n283\n00:14:41.078 --> 00:14:43.614\nwe're clearly able to actually see that.\n\n284\n00:14:43.614 --> 00:14:46.302\nAnd even if you find that out,\nit doesn't mean you\n\n285\n00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.768\nknow what didn't actually cause\nit to apply or to not apply yet.\n\n286\n00:14:49.768 --> 00:14:52.054\nYou still got to do a little\nbit more troubleshooting, but\n\n287\n00:14:52.054 --> 00:14:54.120\nhere he's going to show us\nanother example of this.\n\n288\n00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.800\n>> Exactly.\n\n289\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.840\nAll right so, I'm logged on as Nate, and\nI'm going to try and run good old regedit.\n\n290\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.788\nAnd there we go, my policy is kicking in,\n\n291\n00:15:03.788 --> 00:15:07.021\nregistry editing has been\ndisabled by your administrator.\n\n292\n00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:12.381\nAll right, so that's fantastic,\nor at least it's doing what\n\n293\n00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:17.920\nit's suppose to do and\nI'm gonna log off as Nate, thank you.\n\n294\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.270\nAnd I'm gonna log back in as Ronnie.\n\n295\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.030\nNow Ronnie is in my IT department, and\n\n296\n00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:27.000\nmy IT department needs access\nto the registry editing tools.\n\n297\n00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.206\nSo I've got another policy in place\nThat allows anybody that's in the ITOU\n\n298\n00:15:32.206 --> 00:15:37.094\nto gain access to the registry or\nto use the registry-editing tools.\n\n299\n00:15:37.094 --> 00:15:42.121\nSo I'll log here as Ronnie, and\nI'm gonna try to run Regedit.\n\n300\n00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.278\nAnd it's blocking it, right?\n\n301\n00:15:47.278 --> 00:15:47.905\n>> Oh.\n\n302\n00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.111\n>> So something is wrong.\n\n303\n00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:52.326\nSomething in my policies is\nnot configured correctly, and\n\n304\n00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:55.616\nRonnie doesn't have access to\nthe registry editing tools.\n\n305\n00:15:55.616 --> 00:15:56.533\nAll right?\n\n306\n00:15:56.533 --> 00:16:00.676\nSo, first step when something like that\nhappens would be to see what Policies\n\n307\n00:16:00.676 --> 00:16:02.390\nare being applied.\n\n308\n00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.757\nSo we open up a command prompt.\n\n309\n00:16:06.685 --> 00:16:08.336\nIn this case it's a User Settings so\n\n310\n00:16:08.336 --> 00:16:11.320\nI really don't even need\nthe administrative access.\n\n311\n00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.050\nSo I'll just open up a command\nprompt here and do a GPResult.\n\n312\n00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.320\nI'll make that bigger in just a second.\n\n313\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.370\nForward slash r, or dash r.\n\n314\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.366\nYou can use a dash or a forward\nslash in this particular program,\n\n315\n00:16:25.366 --> 00:16:27.588\nnot all of them accept either/or.\n\n316\n00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:37.620\nAnd I can see under my user settings that\nApplied Group Policies Corp Standards.\n\n317\n00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.260\nThis is where knowledge of your\ninfrastructure is going to come into play,\n\n318\n00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.820\nand your network.\n\n319\n00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.380\nAs a help desk person,\n\n320\n00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.400\nI would know that Corp Standards\nis the corporate standard policy.\n\n321\n00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.560\nThat applies settings to all users.\n\n322\n00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.440\nOne of which,\nis blocking registry editing tools.\n\n323\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.310\nSo that's in place and it's being blocked.\n\n324\n00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.030\nSo it's doing it's job.\n\n325\n00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.000\nBut I also know,\n\n326\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.110\nas a help desk technician, that there's\nanother policy that's in place that\n\n327\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:09.580\nallows if you're in that ITOU to gain\naccess to the registry editing tools.\n\n328\n00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.040\nAnd that one, I don't see here.\n\n329\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.270\nThere's a policy missing.\n\n330\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.980\nRight?\n\n331\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.560\nSo, that's gonna be my first\nindication that I've got a problem\n\n332\n00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.310\nwith these policies.\n\n333\n00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.520\n>> Yeah, since we don't have\nthe policy applying right here, we do.\n\n334\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.250\nWe need to go and figure out why\nit is not applying at this point.\n\n335\n00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.390\nAnd so that means we actually have\nto kinda take a look at another tool\n\n336\n00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.140\nto see what else is going on, and\n\n337\n00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.400\nthere's a couple of other things\nthat we also need to check.\n\n338\n00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.920\nIt could be a problem with Ronnie himself.\n\n339\n00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.520\nIs he actually in the proper location\nwhere that policies applying?\n\n340\n00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.640\nOr is he not?\n\n341\n00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.610\nAnd so those are some simple\nthings we need to check.\n\n342\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:46.430\n>> That's right, very good.\n\n343\n00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.800\nSo let's, I'm gonna log off.\n\n344\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.730\nAnd I'm going to log on\nwith my help desk user.\n\n345\n00:17:54.477 --> 00:17:58.660\nSo, we'll wait for\nwindows to switch over here, here we go.\n\n346\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.340\nDo a little Switch User, Other User.\n\n347\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.700\nLog on as mike, so\nhere I am at the help desk.\n\n348\n00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.040\nRonnie's called me up I said,\nhey, look, Mike.\n\n349\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.840\nI'm supposed to have access to\nregistry editing tools, and I don't.\n\n350\n00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.050\nI cannot see.\n\n351\n00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.990\nI can't get access.\n\n352\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.450\nIt's blocking me.\n\n353\n00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.220\nSo I would've run that.\n\n354\n00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.110\nThere's a couple.\nI could've gone to his machine or\n\n355\n00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.950\nremoted into his machine and\ndone that GP result and\n\n356\n00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.640\nseen that one of the policies is not\nbeing applied like it's supposed to.\n\n357\n00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.370\nAnd then I can troubleshoot from there.\n\n358\n00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:31.550\nBut if I'm sitting and the help desk,\nit might not be as easy.\n\n359\n00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.750\nMaybe Ronnie is in another state, another\ncountry, how do I go to his machine?\n\n360\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.420\nI can maybe remote desktop\ninto his machine, but\n\n361\n00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.500\nthen we have problems because if\nI remote in, I'm logged on as me.\n\n362\n00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.360\nThat's going to change the results\nout of policy it's no longer going\n\n363\n00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.530\nto be What Ronnie's settings are.\n\n364\n00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:53.960\nSo, one of the things we can do is, we\ncan use RSAT, Remote Server Admin Tools,\n\n365\n00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.900\nand we've got another episode, if you\nhaven't seen that yet, check it out,\n\n366\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.080\nwhere we downloaded that from Microsoft.\n\n367\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.000\nWe installed it, and\n\n368\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.780\nit gives me the ability to access those\ntools I would normally find on my Server.\n\n369\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.595\nSo I've got those guys here,\nI'm gonna open up Group Policy Management.\n\n370\n00:19:10.595 --> 00:19:17.107\n[SOUND]\nThere we go.\n\n371\n00:19:17.107 --> 00:19:20.670\nThis is gonna take me over to\nthe Group Policy Management console.\n\n372\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.700\nNow, again, at level one or\nat the help desk I might or\n\n373\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.510\nmight not have access to this.\n\n374\n00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.800\nThey can set it up so you have read\nonly access to it so you can do that\n\n375\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.940\nfirst level of troubleshooting you might\nnot be able to make changes in here but\n\n376\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.000\nyou should be able to come in and\nat least see what's going on and\n\n377\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.295\nI've got another group\nPolicy results right here.\n\n378\n00:19:41.295 --> 00:19:45.255\nNow, it's pretty much the same thing,\nbut it looks a lot better, right?\n\n379\n00:19:45.255 --> 00:19:48.675\nI'm gonna go right-click on this and\nchoose Group Policy Result Wizard.\n\n380\n00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:52.010\nAnd it walks me through the process,\nIm gonna click Next.\n\n381\n00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:57.120\nI'm gonna say hey, I need to know Ronnie's\nlogging on to a machine named tech01,\n\n382\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.700\nactually it's this computer,\nI'll just leave it on that.\n\n383\n00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.510\nIf it was another machine, though,\nI could just browse and find TECH01, for\n\n384\n00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.740\nexample, or\nwhatever the name of that machine was.\n\n385\n00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.820\nOr I could leave it on this computer,\nbut in the real world it would probably\n\n386\n00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.370\nbe Ronnie's laptop And\nI'll click Next and then what user.\n\n387\n00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.070\nWell I need to check and see what's\ngoing on when Ronnie logs on to tech01,\n\n388\n00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.180\nbecause he's not getting\nthose registry editing tools.\n\n389\n00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.290\nSo I'll click Next, and it says alright,\n\n390\n00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.400\nyou're gonna check what happens when\nRonnie logs onto this computer.\n\n391\n00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.630\nWhat is your resultant set of policy.\n\n392\n00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.329\nI'll click Next.\n\n393\n00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:39.920\nAnd then finish and\nthen it's gonna generate my report.\n\n394\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.170\nThat's basically the same information\nthat we saw at the command prompt but\n\n395\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.395\nit's in a much prettier format, isn't it?\n\n396\n00:20:46.395 --> 00:20:47.000\n>> [LAUGH] It is.\n\n397\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.320\n>> It really is nice.\n\n398\n00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.900\nSo we can come in here and\nI can go over to this settings tab.\n\n399\n00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:57.150\nAnd I can do a little show all, or I can\nexpand out just the particular category.\n\n400\n00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.580\nAnd I can start going through here and\nseeing what's going on.\n\n401\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.170\nI should go back to the summary tab here\n\n402\n00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.740\nbecause this is really more what\nyou see at that command prompt.\n\n403\n00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.100\nI can see applied GPO's.\n\n404\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.760\nNow you gotta be careful.\n\n405\n00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.540\nThere's the computer half\nWhich I'm gonna hide.\n\n406\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.730\nAnd then there's the user half.\n\n407\n00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.480\nMake sure you're in the right section.\n\n408\n00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.940\nAnd down here,\nI see Applied GPOs Corp Standards but\n\n409\n00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.170\nthe one that's not being applied\nis that IT Standard GPO.\n\n410\n00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.290\nAgain, something you'd have to know, being\npart of that company that that should be\n\n411\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:32.000\nthere for Ronnie cuz that's what gives the\nIT staff access to registrating tools So\n\n412\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.750\nby using this tool,\neither from command line or\n\n413\n00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.310\nthrough one of the remote sort of admin\ntools, I may be able to determine that,\n\n414\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.990\nhey there is a policy that isn't\napplying that should be applying.\n\n415\n00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:45.060\nRight?\nNow once I've determined that,\n\n416\n00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.370\nthen I have to find out\nWhy is it not applying?\n\n417\n00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.120\nIt could be a network connectivity issue,\nright?\n\n418\n00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.060\nWhen Ronnie logs on, he has to\nconnect to the domain controller,\n\n419\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.950\nretrieve those group policies,\nand apply those policies.\n\n420\n00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.540\nNow maybe he doesn't have\nnetwork connectivity,\n\n421\n00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.610\nmaybe he's using cached credentials.\n\n422\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:06.534\nBut I would have seen in that result, last\ntime group policy was applied 4:10:41.\n\n423\n00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:10.620\nWell it's 4:17 so\nI know that was right when\n\n424\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.390\nRonnie just logged on to that machine so I\ncan use those timestamps to verify, okay.\n\n425\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.160\nLooks like policy's being applied.\n\n426\n00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.130\nJust not the right ones, all right?\n\n427\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.360\nSo once we've determined that,\nthen we've got to figure out why.\n\n428\n00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.500\nAnd this depending might or might not\nbe something we have access to as\n\n429\n00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:30.450\na level one Help Desk, but\nlet's take a look at it anyway.\n\n430\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:35.340\nSo I'm gonna go over here to\nmy Administrative Tools And\n\n431\n00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.520\nopen up Active Directory Users and\nComputers.\n\n432\n00:22:40.755 --> 00:22:42.660\nAll right.\nAnd actually, before I show you this,\n\n433\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.750\nlet's take a look at\nthe policies themselves.\n\n434\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:50.920\nIf I expand out Domains and I expand\nout Lab.net and I expand out Employees.\n\n435\n00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:56.680\nWell here's IT, and there's a policy\nlinked to IT called IT policy.\n\n436\n00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.760\nThere's also a policy linked to\nemployees called Corps Standards.\n\n437\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.000\nCorps Standards is the one\nthat's blocking all employees\n\n438\n00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.460\nfrom accessing registry editing tools.\n\n439\n00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.490\nIT is the one that's\nallowing just the IT OU\n\n440\n00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:14.670\naccess to the registry editing tools So\nthe policies look to be correct here.\n\n441\n00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:20.680\nBut if I go over to active directory and\nI take a look, and expand that lab.net.\n\n442\n00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.000\nI expand out employees and\nI go into that ITOU.\n\n443\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.020\nOh, I don't see Ronnie in the OU.\n\n444\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:31.090\nSo if he's not in the OU,\nthen that policy's not applying to him,\n\n445\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.240\nwhich is why he's not getting access\nto the registry editing tools.\n\n446\n00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.320\nHe's being blocked just\nlike any other employee.\n\n447\n00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.910\nSo if I happen to know where his\naccount is, cuz I set it up.\n\n448\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.220\nSo here he is, there's Ronnie.\n\n449\n00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.630\nHe's in the Sales OU, somebody moved\nhim or put him in the wrong OU.\n\n450\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.500\nSo, all I'm gonna do is move\nRonnie back over to that IT OU.\n\n451\n00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.290\nVerify that he got dumped in there.\n\n452\n00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:01.910\nSo now Ronnie's in the right OU,\nlet's see if that changes our results.\n\n453\n00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.980\nAll right, one of the cool things\nabout using this tool here.\n\n454\n00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.310\nIs that I can just rerun\nthe report any time I need to.\n\n455\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.130\nSo I'm gonna right-click on this guy and\nchoose rerun query.\n\n456\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.740\nAnd it says, I'm gonna check and see what\nhappens when Ronnie logs into TECH01.\n\n457\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.190\nIt's gonna generate all that.\n\n458\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.380\nI'm gonna show my user summary.\n\n459\n00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.510\nAnd still not being applied.\n\n460\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.760\nRonnie, what the heck is the deal there?\n\n461\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.030\n>> Well, if we're just waiting,\nafter awhile this policy is going\n\n462\n00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.200\n>> Going to apply but\n\n463\n00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.870\nit does take a little bit of time for\nit to apply.\n\n464\n00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.840\nCould take up to 90 minutes\nbefore the policy applies, but\n\n465\n00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.780\nthere is a way we can try and\nrush it if we want to.\n\n466\n00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:43.510\n>> Absolutely.\n\n467\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:47.140\nThe problem is, you know,\nRonnie just got added to that OU, but\n\n468\n00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.165\nRonnie was Neighbor's already logged in,\nright?\n\n469\n00:24:49.165 --> 00:24:53.155\nSo it hasn't detected that he has\nbeen moved from one OU to another.\n\n470\n00:24:53.155 --> 00:24:57.665\nSo what I need to do is,\ndo a little refresh on that guy.\n\n471\n00:24:57.665 --> 00:25:00.165\nLet's see what machine we're doing it.\n\n472\n00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.685\nLet's go, I'm going to log off.\n\n473\n00:25:02.685 --> 00:25:05.605\nI know, I'm bad about not closing\nWindows before I log off,\n\n474\n00:25:05.605 --> 00:25:07.285\nyou can yell at me later.\n\n475\n00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.030\nAnd I'm gonna log in as Ronnie, again.\n\n476\n00:25:20.382 --> 00:25:22.470\nAnd let's see if it changes now.\n\n477\n00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:29.680\nSo logon is running, regedit.\n\n478\n00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.654\n>> Hey, looks good.\n\n479\n00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:35.470\n>> And badda-bing, there we go,\nRonnie's back in business.\n\n480\n00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.320\nAnd let's do the GP result again.\n\n481\n00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.890\nAgain I'm logged on as Ronnie,\nlet's do this.\n\n482\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.487\nWe'll just do a little gpresult /r\n\n483\n00:25:54.925 --> 00:25:57.540\nAnd we'll see the difference\nin the results.\n\n484\n00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.030\nNow, I see Applied Group Policy Objects.\n\n485\n00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.010\nCorp Standards is still there.\n\n486\n00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:07.890\nBut IT policy is also there now\nthe right policies are being applied and\n\n487\n00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.010\nthe right settings therefore\nare being applied so\n\n488\n00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:15.680\nyou know just a way we can go through and\nstart to trouble shoot these\n\n",

00:00:17.170\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and with me\ntoday is none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.050\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.020\n>> I'm doing fine today in Florida.\n\n6\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.074\nIt is a wet but a wonderful day\ncuz we're actually inside and\n\n7\n00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:25.100\nwe're going to talk about Windows 7.\n\n8\n00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.475\nIt is a great day.\n\n9\n00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.900\n>> [LAUGH] It is nice being inside.\n\n10\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.944\nYeah, we are.\nWe are going into our Windows 7, and\n\n11\n00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:34.473\ntoday in particular we're going to be\nlooking at the event viewer system,\n\n12\n00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:36.390\nan important part of troubleshooting.\n\n13\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.410\nYou know, this is a place where we can\nfind all kinds of good information.\n\n14\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.260\nMicrosoft has done a really good job at\nimproving the event viewer system over\n\n15\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.230\nthe years, or\nthrough the different versions of Windows.\n\n16\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.610\nAnd in Window 7, Ronnie,\nI don't know about you.\n\n17\n00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.810\nI really like what they've done.\n\n18\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.230\nA lot of really cool new features.\n\n19\n00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.410\n>> It really is cool for a technician.\n\n20\n00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.910\nMost end users will actually take a look\nat event viewer, they'll open it up and\n\n21\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.510\nthey'll take one look at it and go,\nI'll never need to look at that again\n\n22\n00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.930\nbecause they don't like\nwhat they see there.\n\n23\n00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.670\nBut as a technician, especially when\nyou need to support end users and\n\n24\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.920\nwhen things happen on their systems,\nthe event viewer should be one of\n\n25\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.410\nthe first places that we spend time and\nlooking at the logs, and\n\n26\n00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.960\nthat's what event viewer really does for\nus, it's the way that we generate logs.\n\n27\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.460\nIt's the place where we get to go and\nview those logs.\n\n28\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.590\nAnd you will, if you take the time\nto take a look at those logs,\n\n29\n00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.980\nyou'll learn more about that system and\nresearching that system and\n\n30\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.350\nunderstanding it better if you\nwill take the time to do so.\n\n31\n00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.230\nIt's a place that we should not\nbe afraid of, it's a place that,\n\n32\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.350\neven though we might go oh,\nI don't wanna do that again,\n\n33\n00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.620\nit's something that you definitely wanna\nget familiar with and comfortable with.\n\n34\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.600\nBecause it's something that every\ntechnician needs to just go.\n\n35\n00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.690\nAll right, I wanna be able to actually\nknow what's going on with the system,\n\n36\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.340\nand that's really going to help you.\n\n37\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.870\n>> Absolutely.\n\n38\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.760\nOut of habit.\n\n39\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.590\nIt should become habit.\n\n40\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.389\nThe first place you go when you're\ntroubleshooting is typically the event\n\n41\n00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:58.907\nlogger and the command prompt, right?\n\n42\n00:01:58.907 --> 00:02:02.004\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, but by far, this is one of those\n\n43\n00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:06.111\nthings if you're a beginning technician\nand support, it's always easy, and\n\n44\n00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:09.820\nI know that I do this\n>> What is the worst possible conclusion?\n\n45\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.470\n>> Okay.\n>> What absolutely is the worst thing that\n\n46\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.410\ncould happen?\n\n47\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.050\nAnd then you go to the event log and\ngo oh, look it's a user error.\n\n48\n00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.310\nThey couldn't type in their password.\n\n49\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.170\nBut it's real easy to jump\nto those conclusions.\n\n50\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.080\nThe event log is the trust but verify,\n\n51\n00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.440\nit's the way that you verify that what you\nbelieve is happening is actually working.\n\n52\n00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.803\nAnd so, this is something that we should\nbe comfortable with at least, and so\n\n53\n00:02:30.803 --> 00:02:32.234\nthat is what we want to do today.\n\n54\n00:02:32.234 --> 00:02:33.110\n>> Very good eye.\nWell, let's do it.\n\n55\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.050\nLet's dive in and\n\n56\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.870\njust take a look at all the good stuff\nwe can find in the event viewer.\n\n57\n00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.860\nI'm going to show you a few trips,\ntricks in a little bit.\n\n58\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.980\nBut we are going to look at a couple or\ntips and\n\n59\n00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.600\ntricks we can do in that event viewer.\n\n60\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.310\nSo, here I've got my Windows\n7 machine pulled up, and\n\n61\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.270\nall I'm gonna do is go\nto the start menu and\n\n62\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.150\nI'm gonna type in event, and\nthat should find the event viewer.\n\n63\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.840\nYou can also get there through the control\npanel if you want to go that way as well.\n\n64\n00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.010\nAnd that should open up the good\nold event viewer system.\n\n65\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.660\nNow, you should be a little patient\nwith it, when it first opens up,\n\n66\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.030\nthis new event viewer does\na lot of summarization, so\n\n67\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.610\nwhen I take a look at this, I see that\nit's actually still pulling back data.\n\n68\n00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.200\nAnd there is a lot of different logs\nthat it's going to parse through, and\n\n69\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.140\nit wants to give me the summary.\n\n70\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.150\nSo I can see, like, summary information\nabout errors that have occurred, warnings,\n\n71\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.340\ninformational, if I can\ndrag this down a bit or\n\n72\n00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.290\nmaybe I'll just scroll down through there,\naudit success and failures and\n\n73\n00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.240\nyou can see the summaries over\nthe last hour, 24 hours, 7 days.\n\n74\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.590\nSo that's why it takes\na few minutes to open up.\n\n75\n00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.250\nWell, the first thing that I wanna do is\njust take a look at what logs are in here.\n\n76\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.460\nSo over on the left in my navigation tree,\nI've got my Windows logs.\n\n77\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.250\nThese are the standard logs that\nwe've really had since, Ronnie,\n\n78\n00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.890\nsince I've been working with Windows.\n\n79\n00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.760\nThe application law of the security law\nto set up law again and the system law.\n\n80\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.500\nAnd we already start\nwith the applications and\n\n81\n00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.100\nwhat kind of information\nwe're gonna find here Ronnie?\n\n82\n00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.310\n>> We should find information of course\nexact like it says about the applications\n\n83\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.880\nthat are installed in our system.\n\n84\n00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.610\nAnd how they're actually working, our\nsystems, are they actually running fine or\n\n85\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.840\nis there actually gonna be some warning or\nsome type of error that may be happening.\n\n86\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.550\nAnd this is something that we're\ndefinitely gonna need to pay attention to\n\n87\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.640\nwhen we take a look at the applications.\n\n88\n00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.320\nSometimes applications will run just\nfine and you're perfectly fine with it.\n\n89\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.890\nSometimes, it'll run just fine for\nfive minutes.\n\n90\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.560\nAnd you're okay with it and\nall of a sudden, you get this warning, or\n\n91\n00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.520\nthis error message that pops up.\n\n92\n00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.060\nWell, guess what?\n\n93\n00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.190\nWhenever you see one of those messages and\nit pops up,\n\n94\n00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.660\nthe good thing is it tells you, hey,\nthere's more details to learn about this.\n\n95\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.790\nAnd where is it going to populate it?\n\n96\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.230\nRight here in this application log.\n\n97\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.020\nAnd so it's a great way to actually\nunderstand what else could be happening.\n\n98\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.030\n>> Exactly.\n\n99\n00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.030\nAs we get the application log,\nagain services and\n\n100\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.010\napplications can record events here, but\n\n101\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.820\nthey're classified as either warp errors,\nwhich are full blown errors.\n\n102\n00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.660\nSomething has gone wrong,\nsome significant issue there.\n\n103\n00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.270\nIt could be a warning, which is, as I like\nto say, signs of impending doom, right?\n\n104\n00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.800\nA warning typically means that nothing has\ngone wrong yet, but here's something that\n\n105\n00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.210\nlooks like it might cause a problem in\nthe future if you don't deal with it now.\n\n106\n00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.501\nAnd then there's informational errors,\nor not really errors but\n\n107\n00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:15.600\ninformational events,\nwhich are typically good things.\n\n108\n00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.420\nThings that happen.\n\n109\n00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.510\nThis service successfully started.\n\n110\n00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.920\nThis service successfully shut down.\n\n111\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.900\nOr whatever the case may be.\n\n112\n00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.810\nSo, we got warnings, we go errors,\nand we got informational in there.\n\n113\n00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.060\nThen we go down to the security log, and\n\n114\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.790\nthe security log is where all of my\nauditing events are going to be recorded.\n\n115\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.260\nSo, in the past, Ronnie,\nyou know this used to be blank.\n\n116\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.490\nBecause like XP and those,\nthose client operating systems,\n\n117\n00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.580\nthey didn't do any auditing by default.\n\n118\n00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.960\nSo you'd come into the security log,\nand there'd be nothing there.\n\n119\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.220\nAnd that was simply because,\nnot because it was broken.\n\n120\n00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.550\nBut because you hadn't enabled any\nauditing on that particular machine.\n\n121\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.960\nNow with Windows 7 though there is some\nauditing going on, some logging on and\n\n122\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.890\nlogging off auditing at the minimum so\nyou typically see something in here.\n\n123\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.760\n>> Right whenever you're actually auditing\nof these events on especially on security.\n\n124\n00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.660\nIt really is in that\nsecurity event whether or\n\n125\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.810\nnot something is successful or\nnot successful.\n\n126\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.400\nSo normally you'll see these two\nlogs as being an audit success or\n\n127\n00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.120\nan audit failure is registering both.\n\n128\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.060\nAnd by default log ons are actually\ngoing to end up giving us\n\n129\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.680\nthe most activity that we do.\n\n130\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.960\nBecause we're not the only ones\nlogging on to computer believe it or\n\n131\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.460\nnot there's actually different services\nthat are also running in the background.\n\n132\n00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.020\nAnd sometimes you actually have\nto take a look at these because\n\n133\n00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.600\nit may be everything else is running well,\nexcept for one thing.\n\n134\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.170\nAnd being able to trace that back, this is\none of the things that really helps out\n\n135\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.690\nwhen you start taking a look at it too,\nand getting access and\n\n136\n00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.190\nbeing able to actually\nsee these security logs.\n\n137\n00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.540\nA great benefit if you are starting\nto experience those issues,\n\n138\n00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.490\nespecially related along, did somebody\nlog in that wasn't supposed to?\n\n139\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.170\nCan you actually prove that now?\n\n140\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.062\nThat's where you actually\nhave all that stuff.\n\n141\n00:06:54.062 --> 00:06:57.980\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Let's take a look cuz by\ndefault, it's gonna audit log on success\n\n142\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.640\nbut it doesn't do failure out of\nthe box on a local machine like this.\n\n143\n00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.290\nSo to fix that or to change that,\nbecause As Ronnie said,\n\n144\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.013\nthat's really an important thing.\n\n145\n00:07:06.013 --> 00:07:09.261\nIt's good to know when people\nsuccessfully log on, but,\n\n146\n00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:13.634\nI kinda like it when people successfully\nlog on, what I really need to know is if\n\n147\n00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:18.374\nsomebody's doing password guessing,\nfailed, repeated failed log on attempts.\n\n148\n00:07:18.374 --> 00:07:21.287\nThings like that or\nmaybe a service password has changed and\n\n149\n00:07:21.287 --> 00:07:24.322\nthe service repeatedly tries to log on and\ncannot.\n\n150\n00:07:24.322 --> 00:07:28.990\nSo, gpedit.msc is gonna open up\nmy local group policy editor, or\n\n151\n00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.900\nmy local policy editor, and I'll show you\nwhere you can find the auditing settings.\n\n152\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.840\nThey're gonna be under the computer\nhalf of this local policy.\n\n153\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.710\nWe'll drag that over a little bit.\n\n154\n00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.802\nThe computer configuration and\nthen underneath Windows settings.\n\n155\n00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:45.481\nAnd then once that expands out,\nsometimes it takes a minute,\n\n156\n00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:48.048\nwe'll expand out our security settings.\n\n157\n00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:56.860\nAnd then underneath there, Local Policies,\nand then Audit Policy, right?\n\n158\n00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.140\nNow I came in here earlier\nbefore this episode,\n\n159\n00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.520\nand I went ahead and turned this on.\n\n160\n00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.460\nAll of these were listed as No auditing,\n\n161\n00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.010\neven though it actually does\nrecord success logon events.\n\n162\n00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.950\nBut all I did was double click\non the Audit logon events And\n\n163\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.920\nI chose to do both success and failure.\n\n164\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.460\nAnd now it will log both.\n\n165\n00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:21.210\nAnd, in fact, if I log off real quick,\noops not Windows 8.\n\n166\n00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.740\nLet me just log off.\n\n167\n00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.070\nAnd I know, I should close my windows\nbefore I log off, but I'm lazy like that.\n\n168\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.135\nAnd I'm gonna go to log back on.\n\n169\n00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.450\nAnd I'm gonna type in the wrong password.\n\n170\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.890\nSo I get user name or\npassword is incorrect.\n\n171\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.650\nI go to log on again\nusing the right password.\n\n172\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.600\nHopefully.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n173\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.390\n>> And then we can take a look at\n\n174\n00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.790\nthe event viewer and see what happens.\n\n175\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.680\nSo I'm going to open up\ngood old event viewer.\n\n176\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.840\nGive it a minute to populate.\n\n177\n00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.320\nHm, hm, hm.\n\n178\n00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.540\nIt doesn't like you like doing\nthings while it's still trying to\n\n179\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.150\nget all that information.\n\n180\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.510\nWe'll go down to Windows logs,\nand then security.\n\n181\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.340\nAnd if I look, and I'm going to show you\nguys some really cool tricks on filtering\n\n182\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.120\nin just a little bit, but if I scroll down\nhere because it wasn't that long ago,\n\n183\n00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.300\nthere is my audit failure.\n\n184\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.020\nAnd as Ronny said, look at all\nthe logon success messages I have,\n\n185\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.330\nthe audit Success from just me logging on.\n\n186\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.710\nCuz not only do I have to log on,\nmy computer has to authenticate, right?\n\n187\n00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.170\nSo if I look close enough,\nI'll actually find one.\n\n188\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.160\nThere's one for, sorry,\nthat thing keeps popping up.\n\n189\n00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.760\nThe administrator logging on.\n\n190\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.730\nAll right.\n\n191\n00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.270\nIf I go down a little further,\nthere's another one for administrator, And\n\n192\n00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.056\nthere, you can see account name tech 01 $.\n\n193\n00:09:48.056 --> 00:09:49.730\nThat's my computer's name.\n\n194\n00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.920\nThat's the computer account\nbeing authenticated and\n\n195\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.680\nbeing assigned the appropriate\npermissions as well.\n\n196\n00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.430\nThat's what gives that system\naccess to everything, right.\n\n197\n00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.590\nSo there's our security log in again.\n\n198\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.410\nIn the security log, we don't get\nthe criticals, the warnings and\n\n199\n00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.570\nthe information.\n\n200\n00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.130\nIn the security log on, we get either\naudit success Or audit failure.\n\n201\n00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.170\nNext log down is the Setup Log,\n\n202\n00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.690\nand the Setup Log is really not\nused a whole lot by the client.\n\n203\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.440\nYou see more information in here\non your domain controllers, but\n\n204\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.450\nusually information about\nSomething being set up.\n\n205\n00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.200\nLike on a domain controller,\nif I'm installing a role, I'll\n\n206\n00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.910\nsee where it added those remote server\nadmin tool consoles, things like that.\n\n207\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.660\nBut not used a whole lot on\nthe client ends of things.\n\n208\n00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.610\nAnd then the other important\none is the system log.\n\n209\n00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:41.190\nAnd this is where we're gonna find\nthat the operating system and\n\n210\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.160\nsome services that the operating system\nis running are going to log events.\n\n211\n00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.320\nIn order to log like the application log,\nyou've got the criticals,\n\n212\n00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.430\nthe errors, I'm sorry, the errors,\nthe warnings, and the informational there.\n\n213\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.300\nRight, Ronnie?\n\n214\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.030\n>> You do, and\nif we go ahead and take a look.\n\n215\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.780\nOn my computer, I actually have some\ndifferent ones that are generated and\n\n216\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.420\nthis will kind of help us to\nshow what we're talking about.\n\n217\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.300\nI just scrolled down a little bit, I've\nbeen following Mike at the same time here.\n\n218\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.010\nTake and look at some of these things.\n\n219\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.360\nSo if you haven't seen it yet or\nif you're actually like me you\n\n220\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.880\nkind of go oh I don't really want to\nget into it when I start seeing errors.\n\n221\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.400\nWell notice here's an example of\nall three that we see right here.\n\n222\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.140\nThere's the informational one.\n\n223\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.630\nAnd you can see that this is some type of\nservice control module or manager here.\n\n224\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.010\nAnd then here's one called s channel and\nall of a sudden,\n\n225\n00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.250\nthis is where I get scared, right.\n\n226\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.970\nIt says the following\nfatal alert was received.\n\n227\n00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.290\nAnd now, all of a sudden, I get\na little bit more worried about it, and\n\n228\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.040\nthe nice thing is from there I can\nactually just double click on it.\n\n229\n00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.400\nAnd it actually gives me, it doesn't\nlook like a lot more information, but\n\n230\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.610\nwhat we're really looking for at this\npoint then, would be the event id and\n\n231\n00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.940\ntrying to figure out.\n\n232\n00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.080\nWhat would actually be\ngoing on from there.\n\n233\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.990\nAnd that's what you're really looking for\na lot of times,\n\n234\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.410\ntrying to figure out that information.\n\n235\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.420\nThen of course then the warning,\nand here it talks about DNS and\n\n236\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.545\nthe reason is because I don't have\nDNS running, is the big thing.\n\n237\n00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:03.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This name resolution for\n\n238\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.950\nthis name that I was looking for\n\n239\n00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.485\nThese underscores let me know that the\nmachine actually is what generated this\n\n240\n00:12:09.485 --> 00:12:15.180\n.localdomain times out after none of\nthe configured DNS servers responded,\n\n241\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.390\nthat's because I don't have a DNS\nserver running on this machine.\n\n242\n00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.450\nNow Mike, on this thing,\n\n243\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.810\non these different system events here,\nis it like what we had in the security\n\n244\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.770\nwhere we had to go into GP edit\nto To configure some of this?\n\n245\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.860\n>> No most of these are going\nto be already set up.\n\n246\n00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.200\nThe application or the service\nknows when it should log events,\n\n247\n00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.370\nso whoever programmed that application\nwould have written into their\n\n248\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.030\nerror handling capabilities.\n\n249\n00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.120\nAnd part of that might include log in\nevent in a particular log that they\n\n250\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.360\nknow is going to be available\non that Windows system.\n\n251\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.810\n>> So the nice thing about this is,\n\n252\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.820\nwe don't have to worry about\ntrying to configure it exactly.\n\n253\n00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.270\nIf it happens on your system and\nit generates something,\n\n254\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.170\neither the application writer\nis actually who says, all right,\n\n255\n00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.530\nwe need to have an event error log or\nsomething like that actually go out.\n\n256\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.150\nOr, of course, Windows did it or\nsecurities looks like about the only one\n\n257\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.090\nthat we're actually having\nto configure at times.\n\n258\n00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:09.890\n>> There are some.\n\n259\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.620\nIf you're running particular services,\n\n260\n00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.970\nsome of them will not log at all until you\nenable it from within the application.\n\n261\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.390\nDNS is one.\n\n262\n00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.070\nNot so much on the client, but on the\nserver end, but DNS is an example where it\n\n263\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:25.550\ndoes one level of logging by default out\nof the box, and we can turn that off if\n\n264\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.550\nwe want, but we can also go in and\nturn on what we call verbose logging, and\n\n265\n00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:34.090\nwe can control what level of logging we\nwant to do, so depending on the servers or\n\n266\n00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.040\nthe application You might have\nsome control over whether or\n\n267\n00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.270\nnot it's at all or whether it\ndoes much more detailed auditing.\n\n268\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.760\nAnd sometimes when we're troubleshooting,\nwe're really looking for\n\n269\n00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.560\nthat detailed logging, but\nthat can eat up a lot of resources.\n\n270\n00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.190\nIf it has to log every little thing it\ndoes, it can make the log files big and\n\n271\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.030\nit can slow the system down.\n\n272\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.170\nSo, sometimes we turn\nthat verbose stuff on.\n\n273\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.590\nWhen we're trying to find a problem and\ntroubleshoot it.\n\n274\n00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:02.330\nAnd we turn the verbose part off when\nwe don't need that level of detail.\n\n275\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.950\n>> Now Mike,\nbefore we move onto this other one here.\n\n276\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.110\nThere was something I saw during our\nsecurity when we were actually taking\n\n277\n00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.630\na security log.\n\n278\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.760\nWhen you were setting it\nback up In GP edit here.\n\n279\n00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.050\nI wanted to actually just ask\nabout something right here.\n\n280\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.660\nLet me see if I can pull it up.\n\n281\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:22.170\nRight here, the one that you turned on\nwas actually the audit log on events but\n\n282\n00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:27.140\nMike I see another one up here It\nsays audit account log on events.\n\n283\n00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.020\nSo if I were were trying to do this,\nhow do I know which one?\n\n284\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.980\nShould I pick them both?\n\n285\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.300\n>> It doesn't matter, it's just a typo.\n\n286\n00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.355\n>> Is that what it is?\n\n287\n00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:35.290\n>> [LAUGH],\nI'm just kidding with you guys.\n\n288\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.750\nNo, the difference there\nis the log on events\n\n289\n00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:43.560\nThat's registered by the computer\nthat you're sitting at, for example.\n\n290\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.050\nThe account log on events is registered or\n\n291\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.320\nrecorded by the system that's\nactually doing the verification.\n\n292\n00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.330\nFor example, if I'm on a domain machine,\nif I'm on my work computer and\n\n293\n00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:59.160\nI'm logging on with a domain account Well\nI'm interacting with my work computer, so\n\n294\n00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.070\nit's logging me on but it's not the one\nthat knows what my password is, right?\n\n295\n00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.940\nMy username and password are sent\nover to the domain controller,\n\n296\n00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.560\nthe domain controller's verifying that\nI typed in the right password, And\n\n297\n00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.910\nthen telling the computer whether or\nnot I did, and allowing me to log on.\n\n298\n00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:18.090\nSo in that scenario, I would be\nauditing log on events on the desktop,\n\n299\n00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.320\naccount log on events on\nthe domain controller.\n\n300\n00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.270\nAnd if I wanted to see the results, I\nwould open up event viewer on the desktop\n\n301\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.340\nand look at the log on events,\nor look for log on events.\n\n302\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.610\nIf I wanted to see the account login\nevents those would be in the security log\n\n303\n00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.210\non the domain controller.\n\n304\n00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.242\nIf I log in with a local account,\nwell then the login event\n\n305\n00:15:37.242 --> 00:15:40.716\nis fired on my local machine because\nits where im sitting at and And\n\n306\n00:15:40.716 --> 00:15:44.151\nthe account logon event would also\nbe fired on my local machine.\n\n307\n00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:47.796\nBecause now it's going against that SAM\nfile, the security account manager, and\n\n308\n00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:50.571\nit's my desktop or\nlaptop that's doing the authentication.\n\n309\n00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:55.864\nSo the first one, the log on event is\nsimply The machine you're using to log on,\n\n310\n00:15:55.864 --> 00:16:00.763\nthe account log on events is whatever\nmachine is doing the verification or\n\n311\n00:16:00.763 --> 00:16:04.010\ndoing the actual authentication process.\n\n312\n00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.195\n>> Yeah, and I meant that because I know\nthere's been times I just very quickly and\n\n313\n00:16:08.195 --> 00:16:09.757\njust cursorily go in there and\n\n314\n00:16:09.757 --> 00:16:12.711\nall of a sudden I actually\njust choose the log on events.\n\n315\n00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:14.480\nI'm expecting to see something.\n\n316\n00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.510\nI didn't see what I expected to see,\nand usually, it's because,\n\n317\n00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.970\nwell, I'm actually looking for\nthat account log-on.\n\n318\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.530\nSo it's a great little setting for\nus to actually be able to identify and\n\n319\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.150\nunderstand when you do see things\nthat are confusing like that.\n\n320\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.142\nAnd that each one of those, especially in\nthat gp edit, no matter which one you go\n\n321\n00:16:29.142 --> 00:16:32.310\nto, it normally has that Explain tab, but\nsometimes you're actually trying to do it\n\n322\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.020\nquickly, and here's the way that\nyou can identify that as well.\n\n323\n00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.208\nSo no real big interruption, but\nit was something that I just noticed and\n\n324\n00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:40.728\nwas like, oh yeah,\nwe need to make sure that we hit that.\n\n325\n00:16:40.728 --> 00:16:41.808\n>> Oh absolutely, absolutely.\n\n326\n00:16:41.808 --> 00:16:42.713\nGood stuff.\n\n327\n00:16:42.713 --> 00:16:44.451\nAll right So\nif we keep going down our list here,\n\n328\n00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:46.025\nthe next one is gonna be forwarded events.\n\n329\n00:16:46.025 --> 00:16:48.770\nThis is normally a blank as well.\n\n330\n00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.880\nForwarded events stores\nevents from other systems\n\n331\n00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.690\nthat have been sent to\nthe system you're sitting at.\n\n332\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.870\nLike in this case,\nI've got a subscription,\n\n333\n00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.930\nand if you miss the events subscriptions,\ncheck out our other episode.\n\n334\n00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.150\nWe do a thorough covering of that.\n\n335\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.050\nBut you see these events are actually\ncoming from a computer named DC01.\n\n336\n00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.690\nSo these are not events that\nare happening on my computer.\n\n337\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.780\nThey're happening on the domain controller\nand them the domain controller is just\n\n338\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.110\nforwarding those events\nover to my computer, and\n\n339\n00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.000\nthen that way I don't have to go to\nthe domain controller to see the events.\n\n340\n00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.700\nI can see what's going on in\nthe domain controller right here.\n\n341\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.562\nEvent subscriptions are very cool,\nwe did a whole episode.\n\n342\n00:17:22.562 --> 00:17:23.979\nMake sure you check that out.\n\n343\n00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:25.035\nAnd they don't end there.\n\n344\n00:17:25.035 --> 00:17:29.210\nIf we keep on going, in the past,\nthat was about all we had.\n\n345\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:33.429\nBut now, with Windows 7,\nwe've got access to this what's known as\n\n346\n00:17:33.429 --> 00:17:36.499\nthe Application and\nServices log files, right?\n\n347\n00:17:36.499 --> 00:17:41.540\nAnd down here, I've got Hardware Events\nand Internet Explorer Events.\n\n348\n00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.720\nIf I expand out Microsoft,\nI can expand out Windows, and\n\n349\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.340\nas you saw my scroll bar just shrink and\nshrink and shrink.\n\n350\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.638\nThere are a lot of log files in here.\n\n351\n00:17:53.638 --> 00:17:58.410\nThese are gonna be very specific to a\nspecific application or specific servers.\n\n352\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:02.740\nNow those apps and services can still\nlog events in that application log or\n\n353\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.630\nthe system log depending\non what service it is.\n\n354\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.048\nBut, sometimes I wanna focus\non a particular thing.\n\n355\n00:18:08.048 --> 00:18:10.120\nLike, I wanna come down\nhere to Group Policy and\n\n356\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.940\nI can expand our Group Policy and\nI can click on the Operational log for\n\n357\n00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.330\ngroup policy, and\nhere I am seeing only group policy events.\n\n358\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.490\nSo, these are log files specific\nto a particular service and\n\n359\n00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.050\nthey can be very handy when you are trying\nto find something that you know what you\n\n360\n00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.030\nare looking for.\n\n361\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.310\nI can just dive in here and\nfind it, right?\n\n362\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.320\n>> One of the things I know and Mike and\nI, we joke about this all the time.\n\n363\n00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.545\nBut, you tend to have to deal with\nprinters as a support technician and\n\n364\n00:18:37.545 --> 00:18:41.050\nyou maybe wondering well how do I know\nit's actually an error or an issue?\n\n365\n00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.790\nWell, it's in here that you also\nactually will see another one for\n\n366\n00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.040\nPrint Spooler as you scroll\non further down the line, and\n\n367\n00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.090\nit is something that you can check out if\nyou are experiencing some printing issues.\n\n368\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.040\nAnd so you may go, oh, prints, who cares?\n\n369\n00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.660\nRemember that what happens\nin a support situation.\n\n370\n00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.770\nTwo things boils everybody's blood.\n\n371\n00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.950\nOne, they can't get access to email.\n\n372\n00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.770\nTwo, they can't print.\n\n373\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.710\nAnd so if you want to actually be able\nto check out whether it's something that\n\n374\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.110\nhappened on your computer.\n\n375\n00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.600\nSomething that happened on\nthe print server, somewhere else.\n\n376\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.660\nCheck these logs out and see, is it\nyour spool that actually stopped it, or\n\n377\n00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.149\ndoes it actually get stopped\nsomewhere else along the line?\n\n378\n00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:17.448\nA great little handy tool.\n\n379\n00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:18.910\n>> Very good.\n\n380\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.480\nNow, with these logs,\nsome of them are not turned on.\n\n381\n00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.590\nLike we were talking about earlier.\n\n382\n00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.840\nOne that I know that I can show you guys,\nWindows Firewall with advanced security.\n\n383\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.640\nWhen I expand this out,\n\n384\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.630\nI'll see that there's four\ndifferent log files under here.\n\n385\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.120\nThere's a Connections\nsecurity log file and\n\n386\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.660\nthere are no events in here but\nit is turned on.\n\n387\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.070\nOtherwise, I would see the word disabled\nup here, but I don't have, I haven't made\n\n388\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:47.340\nany, VPN connections or IPsec connections\nrecently, so nothing is showing up here.\n\n389\n00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.910\nThe one right under that is\nthe ConnectionSecurityVerbose.\n\n390\n00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.920\nIf I click on that,\nthere's no events here either.\n\n391\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.110\nBut I can see that it is disabled.\n\n392\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.370\nSame thing with this Firewall,\n\n393\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.190\nI'll probably see a bunch of\nevents here in my Firewall.\n\n394\n00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.430\nBut if I go to FirewallVerbose,\nI don't have anything listed,\n\n395\n00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.690\nbecause it's disabled.\n\n396\n00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.500\nSo if I'm troubleshooting and I wanna see\nmore detail, if I wanna see those verbose\n\n397\n00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.450\nentries, all I have to do is come\nover here and click on Enable Log.\n\n398\n00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.990\nIf I choose Enable Log,\n\n399\n00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:19.240\nwell now it's turned on and it will\nstart recording those verbose events.\n\n400\n00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.690\n>> It's kinda neat as I was\nlooking down through this.\n\n401\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.080\nSome of the stuff that you and\nI won't ever think about again or twice.\n\n402\n00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.903\nThere's actually an entry in here for\nwhat we called ready boost.\n\n403\n00:20:30.903 --> 00:20:32.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And Mike, you and\n\n404\n00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.375\nI both remember the idea of ready\nboost here, designed to really help to\n\n405\n00:20:36.375 --> 00:20:40.810\nimprove performance on Windows machines\nby adding in a little USB drive.\n\n406\n00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.830\nI can't even remember the last time\nI thought about doing that until this\n\n407\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.270\nthis little log here.\n\n408\n00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.340\nSo, they didn't actually take out\nthings that nobody actually uses.\n\n409\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.180\nIt's still there, and\nif you choose to use that ready boost,\n\n410\n00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.950\ngood luck at doing if first, but secondly,\nbut at least I should give you a log here\n\n411\n00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.680\nto let you know whether or\nnot it's actually in use.\n\n412\n00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.518\nSo it's kind of a time\nwarp when you go back and\n\n413\n00:21:01.518 --> 00:21:03.779\nstart seeing some of these things.\n\n414\n00:21:03.779 --> 00:21:04.613\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then you're like man,\n\n415\n00:21:04.613 --> 00:21:06.267\nI haven't even thought\nabout that in five years.\n\n416\n00:21:06.267 --> 00:21:07.615\n>> A little blast from the past, right?\n\n417\n00:21:07.615 --> 00:21:08.369\n>> Yes.\n\n418\n00:21:08.369 --> 00:21:12.340\n>> [LAUGH] All right now the next thing\nthat I want to do is, as you saw,\n\n419\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.820\nlots of log files.\n\n420\n00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.979\nReally one of the biggest challenges\nis finding the one you're looking for.\n\n421\n00:21:15.979 --> 00:21:16.954\n>> Right.\n\n422\n00:21:16.954 --> 00:21:20.870\n>> Like I remember looking for, we're\ngonna talk about resource monitor later,\n\n423\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.460\nor the performance monitor,\nand you can do alerts.\n\n424\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:29.020\nThere's a log file in there for alerts,\nbut it's called diagnosis dash PLA.\n\n425\n00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.642\nWho would have thought of that, right?\n\n426\n00:21:30.642 --> 00:21:33.590\n>> Yeah.\n>> But do a little research, find it.\n\n427\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.100\nYou'll find it.\n\n428\n00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.555\nIt's in there somewhere,\nyou just have to find it.\n\n429\n00:21:35.555 --> 00:21:36.262\n>> Right.\n\n430\n00:21:36.262 --> 00:21:39.177\n>> All right, so now let's take a look\nat how I can filter some of these,\n\n431\n00:21:39.177 --> 00:21:41.410\nbecause sometimes there's\na lot of events in here.\n\n432\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.680\nAnd as I start scrolling through, sorry,\nmy mouse is just goofing with me.\n\n433\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.611\nI start scrolling through here.\n\n434\n00:21:46.611 --> 00:21:48.900\nI'm seeing a whole bunch\nof informationals.\n\n435\n00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.974\nI also see there's 1,310 events in there.\n\n436\n00:21:51.974 --> 00:21:53.159\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So how do I know that\n\n437\n00:21:53.159 --> 00:21:55.310\nall 1,310 are informational?\n\n438\n00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.350\nWhat if there's some errors or\nsome warnings buried in there?\n\n439\n00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.600\nAnd that's really what I need to see.\n\n440\n00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.170\nMake it very easy for us.\n\n441\n00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.740\nOnce you find the log file you're looking\nfor, all you have to do is come over here\n\n442\n00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.588\nto the right side in your actions pane and\nchoose Filter Current Log.\n\n443\n00:22:09.588 --> 00:22:12.750\nAnd that's gonna open up this little\ndialog box where I can choose,\n\n444\n00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.610\nfirst of all, a time frame.\n\n445\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.950\nMaybe I know something occurred in the\nlast 24 hours, and that's all I wanna see.\n\n446\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.220\nOr I'm just looking for, and\n\n447\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.010\nthat's what I'm going to do,\ncriticals or errors or warnings.\n\n448\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.280\nI don't really care about informationals.\n\n449\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.450\nI can also filter it by\nsource if I choose to do so.\n\n450\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.920\nLittle graphics glitch there.\n\n451\n00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:38.300\nAnd I can also choose like by keywords,\nwe could do it by users or by computers.\n\n452\n00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.768\nLots of different ways that\nI can filter this down.\n\n453\n00:22:40.768 --> 00:22:43.110\nI'm just gonna try to find,\nsee if there's any critical warnings and\n\n454\n00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.870\nerrors and I click OK.\n\n455\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.550\nAnd I see, wow,\nthere really are some errors in there and\n\n456\n00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.800\nI might not have seen those had I\nbeen scrolling through that list.\n\n457\n00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.470\nI probably would have gave up\nafter the first ten scrolls and\n\n458\n00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.030\nnot bothered to go any further.\n\n459\n00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:01.080\nBy simply filtering it down, I can see\nall of those errors that are occurring.\n\n460\n00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.600\nAnd it lets me know up here at\nthe top of the little filter icon or\n\n461\n00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.060\nlittle funnel icon.\n\n462\n00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.530\nSays Filtered log, it's telling me what\nit's filtered by, and it tells me number\n\n463\n00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:14.700\nof events are 14, but it still says at\nthe top number of events 1,300, right?\n\n464\n00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.050\nSo these events don't go away,\n\n465\n00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.710\nit doesn't remove anything,\nit's temporarily filtering them.\n\n466\n00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.000\nWhen I'm done looking at it this way and\n\n467\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.540\nI wanna remove my filter there's\nan option over here for Clear Filter.\n\n468\n00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:30.170\nAnd that's going to remove my filter and\nnow I'm back to all 1,310 events.\n\n469\n00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:34.870\nSo a nice quick easy way to dive in\nthere and find what you're looking for.\n\n470\n00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.580\nMaybe you're just looking for\nerrors or what have you.\n\n471\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.755\n>> And even more than that,\nof just looking and observing it on\n\n472\n00:23:40.755 --> 00:23:45.026\nthe right hand side of that action pane\nyou also see the ability to save that too.\n\n473\n00:23:45.026 --> 00:23:48.353\nAnd that is also important because\nsomeone like me may look at it and go,\n\n474\n00:23:48.353 --> 00:23:50.358\nI don't know what that's talking about.\n\n475\n00:23:50.358 --> 00:23:54.167\nI can save that as file and later on\nshow Mike the event and Mike, oh yeah,\n\n476\n00:23:54.167 --> 00:23:55.235\nI know what that is.\n\n477\n00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:56.059\nAnd like I always do.\n\n478\n00:23:56.059 --> 00:23:58.579\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And he can point it out and go hey,\n\n479\n00:23:58.579 --> 00:24:00.354\nyeah, this is what this is about.\n\n480\n00:24:00.354 --> 00:24:02.705\nAnd do we actually need to worry about it,\nor\n\n481\n00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:05.570\nis that something we can kind of overlook?\n\n482\n00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.820\nSometimes it's real easy to\nget into an unusual mentality,\n\n483\n00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.110\nwhich is when you see errors.\n\n484\n00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.800\nI've got to fix every single one of them.\n\n485\n00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.920\nWell some of them you're not\ngoing to be able to fix, and\n\n486\n00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.320\nyou've gotta learn how to live with that.\n\n487\n00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.090\nBut you have to actually be able to know\nthat you can take that information to\n\n488\n00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.630\nsomebody that may know, and go,\n\n489\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.600\nyeah that's something that we're\nnot even going to worry about.\n\n490\n00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.170\nIt's just that that server's no longer\nthere, and that machine's still looking\n\n491\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.060\nfor it and you could go in and try and\ndig it all out, but at this point,\n\n492\n00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.040\njust kind of realize that by saving it\ngives you that historical record and\n\n493\n00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.360\nsometimes when you actually do fix\nstuff and it's no longer available and\n\n494\n00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.630\nyou go, I know what that event was and\nthen you can go back and look at it.\n\n495\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.500\nSo, saving it is really a cool thing.\n\n496\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.100\n>> It is.\n\n497\n00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.830\nAnd let's take a look at the, Ronnie,\ncuz that's a great little feature.\n\n498\n00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:49.090\nYou know, if my job is to come in here\neveryday and look at these logs and\n\n499\n00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.380\nsee if there's been any warnings and\nerrors over the last 24 hours, well sure,\n\n500\n00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.820\nI can go find the log, click on it,\ndo my filtering like we just did,\n\n501\n00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.590\nsee everything, close it down, tomorrow\nI come in, I got to do the same thing.\n\n502\n00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.170\nAnd I might have to do that from\nseveral different log files.\n\n503\n00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.120\nI've got to look at the group\npolicy log file, the DNS log file,\n\n504\n00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.950\nthe application and\nthe system logs, things like that.\n\n505\n00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.240\nPlus Ronnie said,\nI can actually save them.\n\n506\n00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.830\nSo let's go ahead, and\nyou can do it one of two ways, you could\n\n507\n00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:20.730\ncreate it from scratch, or you could\nfilter it first and then save it.\n\n508\n00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.280\nAnd, I'm just gonna click create custom\nview here, just show you this dialog.\n\n509\n00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.500\nIt's actually the same dialog box that\nwe used to do that temporary filtering.\n\n510\n00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.520\nIt's the exact same thing,\nit's just that it's gonna save it.\n\n511\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.260\nSo let's do the same\nthing we did last time.\n\n512\n00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.590\nI'm gonna say well let's do a more\nrealistic one, every day I come in and\n\n513\n00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.740\nI wanna do critical's, errors and\nwarnings and only for the last 24 hours\n\n514\n00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.300\nbecause I monitor it every day, so I don't\nthink I need anything more than that.\n\n515\n00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.460\nI'll check it every day.\n\n516\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.460\nSo I choose what events, what time frame,\nand then from what log files.\n\n517\n00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.970\nNow it's already got this group policy\nlog because that's the one I've\n\n518\n00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.290\ncurrently selected.\n\n519\n00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:00.810\nPlus I also wanna include\nthe application log and the system log.\n\n520\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.310\nAnd then I could any more\nfiltering if I chose to do so.\n\n521\n00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.020\nI'll go ahead and save it like this.\n\n522\n00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.480\nI'll click okay, and\nnow I've got this custom view,\n\n523\n00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.340\nand it asks me where I want to create it,\nand by default there's a node up there.\n\n524\n00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.540\nYou might have saw it in my\nnavigation tree, called custom views.\n\n525\n00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.980\nI can put it there, or I can also\ncreate sub folders if I wanted to,\n\n526\n00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.660\nmaybe I call this my morning logs, or\nsomething like that, my morning job.\n\n527\n00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:31.850\nWho knows, or we'll just call it\ncriticals or errors, how about that?\n\n528\n00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.470\nWe'll call it errors.\n\n529\n00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.030\nSo I can make a sub folder for that,\nyou can organize it anyway you want.\n\n530\n00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.020\nI click okay and\nlet's call this guy something like errors.\n\n531\n00:26:43.128 --> 00:26:47.970\nAnd now over here in the top\nunderneath custom views, I can see\n\n532\n00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:53.070\nmy folder that I created called errors and\nI've got my log file underneath there.\n\n533\n00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:57.150\nAnd now this is gonna pull just errors,\nwarnings, and\n\n534\n00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:02.920\nwhat other one I chose there, the\ncriticals from all those log files, right?\n\n535\n00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.800\nI can see a DNS event there.\n\n536\n00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.180\nI can see a group policy event there.\n\n537\n00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.930\nSo this is pulling from\nmore than one log file.\n\n538\n00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.350\nThose are very handy and\nit doesn't stop there, right?\n\n539\n00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.150\nLet's say I'm doing this on\na particular client machine and\n\n540\n00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.840\nI wanna have that same view on\nanother client machine, easy enough.\n\n541\n00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.560\nAll we have to do is export this guy.\n\n542\n00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:32.270\nI can right click on here and\nI can chose export custom view.\n\n543\n00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.915\nWhen I do that,\nI'll pick a location eventually.\n\n544\n00:27:35.915 --> 00:27:38.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm just gonna dump it out here on\n\n545\n00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:42.130\nmy desktop so we can find it real quick,\nand I'll call it errors again.\n\n546\n00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.290\nNotice it's gonna be an XML file.\n\n547\n00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.760\nWhen I click Save and\nthen to make this easier,\n\n548\n00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.110\nI'm going to delete this one that I\njust created, so we can show you.\n\n549\n00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.280\nIs now what I would do, let's say,\n\n550\n00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.120\nI could save that up into\na shared location on the network.\n\n551\n00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.330\nI could save that on a thumb drive and\ngo to another machine.\n\n552\n00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.440\nAnyway I can get it to the other machine.\n\n553\n00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.540\nAnd then once I get to the other machine\nall I have to do is come up to custom\n\n554\n00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.870\nviews and import custom views and\nimport custom view.\n\n555\n00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.640\nAnd then I would browse to that\nnetwork share or that thumb drive.\n\n556\n00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.710\nI would find that XML file, click open,\ndecide where I want to put it.\n\n557\n00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.560\nMaybe I've got different folders\ncreated on the different machines or\n\n558\n00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.060\nwhat have you.\n\n559\n00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.380\nI'll just put it under custom views.\n\n560\n00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.850\nOh.\nWe'll put it back under errors.\n\n561\n00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.180\nI'll click okay, and\nsure enough, there it is.\n\n562\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.600\nSo you can save these filtered views and\n\n563\n00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.380\nthen you can export them and\nimport them into other machines.\n\n564\n00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.870\n>> It really is very handy.\n\n565\n00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:39.900\nIt's when you actually do have, let's say,\nyou actually are now a senior technician.\n\n566\n00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.410\nAnd you're asking people to go ahead and\nsend some of these to you so\n\n567\n00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:44.320\nthat you can view them.\n\n568\n00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.150\nYou could probably open up\nthe XML file if you want to, and\n\n569\n00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.520\ntake a look at them that way.\n\n570\n00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.940\nI can't do it but you may be able to, or\n\n571\n00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.060\nyou can just simply import them and\nnow have them right there,\n\n572\n00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.730\nwhere you can actually compare them\nas you go down through it, and\n\n573\n00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.790\nthat way you can see if are you getting it\nconsistent between these different sites.\n\n574\n00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.390\nAre you actually getting that same error,\n\n575\n00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.950\nwhen they're all connecting to\nthe same server or something?\n\n576\n00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.890\nAnd that way you know,\nis it that one problem, or\n\n577\n00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.230\nis it actually something else\nthat's going on between them?\n\n578\n00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.370\nSo, it's a great little way to be able\nto aggregate a lot of information\n\n579\n00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.170\nright away, too.\n\n580\n00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.220\n>> There are a ton of log files,\nas we saw.\n\n581\n00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.270\nI mean, I could scroll down\nthat list forever and a day.\n\n582\n00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.220\nSo, if I take the time to\nset up that custom view,\n\n583\n00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.640\nto pick all the different log\nfiles that I really care about.\n\n584\n00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.190\nI don't care about the ready boost one or\nwhat have you.\n\n585\n00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.320\nFind all the log files\nyou really care about and\n\n586\n00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.260\nnow I don't have to dig\nthrough that list every time.\n\n587\n00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.310\nI've got this nice custom\nview there waiting for me.\n\n588\n00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:37.400\nAnother cool thing that they've\ndone in this event viewer system,\n\n589\n00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.200\nis they've given us the ability\nto attach a task to an event.\n\n590\n00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.070\nWhich is really pretty cool,\nbecause there are some systems,\n\n591\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.980\nwe're going to look later on at something\ncalled the performance monitor and\n\n592\n00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:54.250\nI can have that performance monitor\ngenerate events in the event log.\n\n593\n00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.920\nBut I don't go check the event log\nevery hour, every fifteen minutes.\n\n594\n00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.630\nI might check it once a day or\nwhen there's a problem and\n\n595\n00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:03.770\nwhat I can now do though is associate\na task with the event in the event log.\n\n596\n00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.600\nSo any time that event fires and\n\n597\n00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.800\ngets recorded in the event log,\nit fires off by task.\n\n598\n00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.310\nAnd maybe I have it run a script or\npop up a message,\n\n599\n00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.630\nand it's actually very easy to do.\n\n600\n00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:18.900\nWhat I've done here is I've gone down into\nmy group policy log, my operational log.\n\n601\n00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:24.010\nAnd there's an event for\nwhen the user logon policy is processing.\n\n602\n00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:29.280\nAnd remember policy process we\ncan logon every 90 or so minutes,\n\n603\n00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.720\nand you can also do it manually, and\nI wanna say it's 8,005 for the manual.\n\n604\n00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:40.268\nLet me filter this down real quick\ncuz I wanna be able to show you this.\n\n605\n00:30:40.268 --> 00:30:46.580\nBut I'm going to say eight,\n8005 should have a couple of those.\n\n606\n00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.950\nSo here's one you can see.\n\n607\n00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:52.330\nHere's one that has completed manual\nprocessing of policy for user, LABmike.\n\n608\n00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.370\nSo it's the user settings when\nyou run GP Update, right.\n\n609\n00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.512\nThat's that manual processing,\nso it's a different event ID for\n\n610\n00:30:59.512 --> 00:31:03.920\nGP Update manual processing\nversus the normal refresh cycle.\n\n611\n00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.350\nSomething to keep in mind,\nthose are 8001s during that.\n\n612\n00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.543\nSo let's say-\n>> You're killing me.\n\n613\n00:31:08.543 --> 00:31:10.717\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So let's say I wanna, and\n\n614\n00:31:10.717 --> 00:31:14.306\nI use this one because I know I can\ngenerate an event right now, right?\n\n615\n00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:16.517\nI can open up a command prompt and\ndo a little GP update, and\n\n616\n00:31:16.517 --> 00:31:17.839\nI know it's gonna get triggered.\n\n617\n00:31:17.839 --> 00:31:19.899\n>> You know an event ID, that's smart.\n\n618\n00:31:19.899 --> 00:31:22.243\n>> [LAUGH] So, here's 8,005.\n\n619\n00:31:22.243 --> 00:31:23.184\nHush Ronnie.\n\n620\n00:31:23.184 --> 00:31:23.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n621\n00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.224\n>> So all I have to do is come in here and\n\n622\n00:31:26.224 --> 00:31:29.810\nsay, all right I want to\nattach a task to this event.\n\n623\n00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.870\nIt's going to open up a little dialog box,\n\n624\n00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:37.940\nwhere I can give it a name and I'm just\ngonna leave that default name there.\n\n625\n00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.080\nI could put a description in which maybe\nI should do when I'm working with other\n\n626\n00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.310\nadministrators.\n\n627\n00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:45.990\nAnd then the event,\nwell I selected 805 or 8005 so\n\n628\n00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.440\nthat's all ready filled in I click next.\n\n629\n00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.690\nAnd this is the important part.\n\n630\n00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.905\nWhat I want it to do,\nwhen that particular event fires.\n\n631\n00:31:52.905 --> 00:31:56.086\nStart a program, send an email,\ndisplay a message.\n\n632\n00:31:56.086 --> 00:32:00.358\nSo maybe I've gotta set up an all to\nmy client machines, in time there's a.\n\n633\n00:32:00.358 --> 00:32:01.345\nLog on issue, right?\n\n634\n00:32:01.345 --> 00:32:03.560\nI could go get that failed log on ID.\n\n635\n00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.239\nI could get the event ID for\na failed log on attempt, and\n\n636\n00:32:06.239 --> 00:32:09.860\nI can associate a task with that and\nsay hey, I need to get an email.\n\n637\n00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.360\nSo now I don't have to monitor every\nsingle log file, on every single client.\n\n638\n00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.740\nI'll get an email any time that event\nfires on any one of those machines.\n\n639\n00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.830\nI'm gonna do a display of message\njust because I don't have\n\n640\n00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.448\nemail set up on these virtual machines or\nanything like that.\n\n641\n00:32:22.448 --> 00:32:26.020\nI'll click next and\nI'll give it a message of,\n\n642\n00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.230\nlet's say, event viewer,\ntitle, event viewer.\n\n643\n00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:36.792\nAnd the message is gonna be\nsomething like, group policy\n\n644\n00:32:36.792 --> 00:32:42.986\nwas manually refreshed,\n\n645\n00:32:42.986 --> 00:32:47.480\nand I'll click next,\nand I'll click finish.\n\n646\n00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.040\nWhat it's actually gonna do is\ncreate a scheduled task, so\n\n647\n00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.330\nit's really something I could do by going\ninto my task scheduler right, and creating\n\n648\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.160\nthis myself, it's just now it's so easy to\ndo right here in the event viewer system.\n\n649\n00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.890\nNice.\nSo I click okay and\n\n650\n00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.880\nlet's test it out all right,\nlet's go ahead and open a command prompt.\n\n651\n00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:10.520\nOops, and that's not a command prompt.\n\n652\n00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.470\nLet's try that again, a little CMD action.\n\n653\n00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.880\nHow do you spell CMD again?\n\n654\n00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.490\nYeah, how do you spell that?\n\n655\n00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.861\nAnd I'm gonna do a little GP update.\n\n656\n00:33:23.099 --> 00:33:24.341\nRefresh policy.\n\n657\n00:33:26.407 --> 00:33:29.538\nAnd then we'll let it go through it's\nthing, should just take a second to\n\n658\n00:33:29.538 --> 00:33:33.025\nrefresh that policy, reach out to the\ndomain controller, retrieve policies for\n\n659\n00:33:33.025 --> 00:33:34.943\nboth the computer half and\nthe user half, and\n\n660\n00:33:34.943 --> 00:33:36.990\nwe should see a couple of\nthings with this view.\n\n661\n00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:39.020\nI'll see a new event in the event viewer,\n\n662\n00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.160\nbut what if I didn't have\nthe event viewer open?\n\n663\n00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:41.740\nRight?\nWhat if\n\n664\n00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.080\nI'm not even sitting at that system?\n\n665\n00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.040\nRemember, this could be an email to me or\nsomething like that.\n\n666\n00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.385\nSo we'll let this thing thing refresh.\n\n667\n00:33:47.385 --> 00:33:49.620\n[LAUGH] Sure hope it refreshes okay.\n\n668\n00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.470\nMake sure my domain controller\nis actually up and running.\n\n669\n00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:54.580\nYeah.\nIt looks like it is.\n\n670\n00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.080\nIt's good all right.\n\n671\n00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.100\nIt's just being a little slow.\n\n672\n00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:57.920\nThere it is.\n\n673\n00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.370\nSure enough.\n\n674\n00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.820\nThere is my message,\ngroup policy was manually refreshed.\n\n675\n00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.440\nAgain, think about a little more\nbeneficial application might be shooting\n\n676\n00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.750\nan email off to somebody when a particular\nerror occurred or something like that.\n\n677\n00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:14.400\nThis is just one I knew I could\ntrigger real quick and show you guys.\n\n678\n00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.930\nYou should do it every time somebody\nactually prints something from\n\n679\n00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:17.603\ntheir printer.\n\n680\n00:34:17.603 --> 00:34:18.357\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n681\n00:34:18.357 --> 00:34:19.331\nIt can say, call Ronnie.\n\n682\n00:34:19.331 --> 00:34:21.700\n[LAUGH] That would be my message.\n\n683\n00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.378\nThat would be funny.\n\n684\n00:34:23.378 --> 00:34:24.370\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n685\n00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.840\nA couple more things I wanna show you\nbefore we call it a day on these event\n\n686\n00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.700\nviewer systems, or the event viewer.\n\n687\n00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.280\nWe got through these the attach a task.\n\n688\n00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.650\nThe other thing I want to show you\nhow to save a log and clear a log.\n\n689\n00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.960\nWe'll just do this real quick.\n\n690\n00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:44.580\nI'm going to come over here to my\nsecurity log and I got 943 events.\n\n691\n00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.290\nThis virtual machine has not been running\nvery long its a couple days old or\n\n692\n00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:49.087\nsomething like that.\n\n693\n00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:53.320\nSo there's not a lot in there but over\ntime these log files can get very large.\n\n694\n00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.070\nTens of thousands of entries in there and\nit makes it difficult to find anything\n\n695\n00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:01.530\nimportant first of all, and most likely\nyou don't need anything that old.\n\n696\n00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.690\nSo I can clear these logs which is\nvery simple, you come over here and\n\n697\n00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:10.150\nchoose clear log, but you wanna make\nsure that most of the time, especially\n\n698\n00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:14.040\nin my security log, I don't wanna just\nclear it and throw away all those events.\n\n699\n00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.180\nMost of my logs,\nI don't wanna throw away any events.\n\n700\n00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:20.120\nThere's probably industry regulations,\ngovernmental regulations,\n\n701\n00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.500\ncompany regulations that state how\nlong I've got to keep this stuff.\n\n702\n00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.810\nIf I've gotta prosecute a bad guy for\nhacking into my system, I'd\n\n703\n00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.000\nbetter have those event logs that show all\nthat evidence that we can take into court.\n\n704\n00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.890\nIf I clear it and\n\n705\n00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:36.770\nthey're gone, I have no evidence that\nI can use to prosecute this person.\n\n706\n00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:39.650\nSo when you wanna clear these logs out,\n\n707\n00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.710\ntruncate them off,\nyou wanna make sure you save them.\n\n708\n00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:47.270\nNow, I can save it by just clicking\nover here, save all events as, and\n\n709\n00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.860\nit would save it and\nit wouldn't truncate anything.\n\n710\n00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.140\nI'm going to do the clear and save at\nthe same time to show you guys, but\n\n711\n00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.360\nit would be the exact same thing.\n\n712\n00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.880\nSo I'm going to click clear log, and\nits going to say do you want to clear it,\n\n713\n00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.210\nor do you want to save it and clear it.\n\n714\n00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.490\nI wanna save it and clear it.\n\n715\n00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:05.170\nSo it's going to ask me\nwhere I want to save it.\n\n716\n00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:09.508\nAnd I'm going to call this one security,\nand\n\n717\n00:36:09.508 --> 00:36:14.888\nI did that on 06-25-15,\nand I'll click save.\n\n718\n00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:20.200\nAnd what will happen is\nmy log flag file clears.\n\n719\n00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.970\nNow the security log is a little\ndifferent than the other ones.\n\n720\n00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:26.430\nImmediately a new event is triggered\nsaying hey, Mike Rodrick, or\n\n721\n00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.670\nin this case administrator,\ncleared the log file.\n\n722\n00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.910\nSo if I ever come in here and\nit's empty, I know who emptied it.\n\n723\n00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.460\nNow I can click open saved log.\n\n724\n00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.340\nLet's say in the future my\nboss comes to me and says hey,\n\n725\n00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.630\nI need to see the log files\nfrom back on the 25th of June,\n\n726\n00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.150\nwe think somebody was doing\nsome password guessing.\n\n727\n00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:45.650\nI can come over here and say all right,\nwell it's not in my event viewer anymore,\n\n728\n00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:47.020\nthat was a month ago.\n\n729\n00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.810\nBut I can go find that log file and\nI can open that guy up.\n\n730\n00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.530\nIt's gonna ask me where I wanna open it,\nand I can put it under here,\n\n731\n00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:58.140\nunder the saved logs,\nwhich is gonna be a node over here.\n\n732\n00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.480\nI could make new folders if I\nwanted to for different logs.\n\n733\n00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.610\nClick okay, and\nnow I've got my saved log and there it is.\n\n734\n00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:06.880\nAll right?\n\n735\n00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.160\nAnd I can go back, and I can.\n\n736\n00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.760\nVery nice.\nI can still filter this saved log\n\n737\n00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.070\ndown if I want, or anything like that.\n\n738\n00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:15.189\nSo we still have all\nof those capabilities.\n\n739\n00:37:15.189 --> 00:37:17.210\nSo the event view system Ronnie,- Awesome.\n\n740\n00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:18.970\nBig overhaul on it since Windows XP.\n\n741\n00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.430\nIf you haven't looked at it,\nif you haven't dived in there and\n\n742\n00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.820\nplayed around with it,\nreally should give it a look.\n\n743\n00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.530\nIt's a lot easier to work with.\n\n744\n00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.740\nA lot of cool new capabilities and\nas a technician, Ronnie, it's something\n\n745\n00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.080\nthat we've got to be able to, gotta be\ncomfortable getting in here and working.\n\n746\n00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:32.650\nYou really do.\n\n747\n00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:37.340\nThe only other thing that I want to\npoint out here on the event viewer is,\n\n748\n00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.080\nthose event IDs,\nthe ones I was making fun of Mike about,\n\n749\n00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.770\nthere are going to be the times when\nyou work with it as often as Mike does.\n\n750\n00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.270\nAnd there are times when I've\nalso worked with it as often,\n\n751\n00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:48.110\nespecially working with terminal servers.\n\n752\n00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.926\nYou get used to seeing those numbers and\nit just kills you.\n\n753\n00:37:50.926 --> 00:37:52.365\nMine's 1033.\n\n754\n00:37:52.365 --> 00:37:54.104\nBelieve it or not I know that number, so\n\n755\n00:37:54.104 --> 00:37:56.940\nthose are the ones where it's\nlike I can't believe that.\n\n756\n00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.380\nNo, not another one.\n\n757\n00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:03.790\nSo yeah, you get rid of the for\nfive hours or for 24 hours like great and\n\n758\n00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:07.190\nthen the 48 hour all of the sudden\nyou see them pop back up,\n\n759\n00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.540\nyou know that not everything's done yet.\n\n760\n00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.010\nSo even though I make fun of\nit you're gonna learn them.\n\n761\n00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.567\nYou're not going to\nlearn every single one.\n\n762\n00:38:12.567 --> 00:38:13.730\nSo Mike you know what number one is?\n\n763\n00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.894\nNo.\nI have no clue what number one is.\n\n764\n00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:18.437\nProbably as Windows was created.\n\n765\n00:38:18.437 --> 00:38:19.730\nIt's installed.\n\n766\n00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.570\nIs what event ID number one is.\n\n767\n00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.480\nBut you will learn some of them just\nbecause you're actually used to\n\n768\n00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.550\nseeing them.\n\n769\n00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:29.250\nSo even though I make fun about Mike,\nI have my own too.\n\n770\n00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.680\nBut just kind of realize that.\n\n771\n00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.080\nThere will be common ones that you're\ngenerally gonna look for, and you have to\n\n772\n00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.960\nactually be able to do that and\nnot feel intimidated by what you see here.\n\n773\n00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.070\nSo Mike actually gave us a great demo on\nhow to actually get around this system.\n\n774\n00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:44.070\nAnd something that a technician\nshould be able to actual do.\n\n775\n00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.325\nAnd if you don't,\nI don't know all of them obviously.\n\n776\n00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.260\n[LAUGH] Right.\nThere's a couple that you deal with,\n\n777\n00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.510\nlike Ronnie said, every so\noften you learn a few, but\n\n778\n00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.867\nthat's why those search\nengines are a friend, right?\n\n779\n00:38:53.867 --> 00:38:54.550\nYep.\n\n780\n00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.750\nWe can always take one\nof those event IDs and\n\n781\n00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.840\nwe can go to our favorite search engine.\n\n782\n00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.160\nWe can pop that thing in there and\nfind some more information on those.\n\n783\n00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.505\nThere's even websites, like I don't know\nif EventID.net is still out there, but\n\n784\n00:39:07.505 --> 00:39:08.895\nthat used to be one of my favorites,\n\n785\n00:39:08.895 --> 00:39:11.875\nbecause that was all\nthey did was event IDs.\n\n786\n00:39:11.875 --> 00:39:14.625\nAnd so you can find a website\nlike that and bookmark it and\n\n787\n00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:15.715\ngo look up those event IDs.\n\n788\n00:39:15.715 --> 00:39:19.550\nBecause sometimes the information in the\nevents themselves is a little bit cryptic,\n\n789\n00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.980\nyou might get like a hexadecimal error\ncode Right Or something like that,\n\n790\n00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.310\njust go out and search it and see what\nthe heck the problem is, just make sure\n\n791\n00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.120\nyou trust the people you're getting the\ninfo from ,you know get it from Microsoft\n\n792\n00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.240\nhopefully, or one of those places\nthat specializes in info tech.\n\n793\n00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.080\nAll right.\nWell, Ronnie,\n\n794\n00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.160\nthat was a lot of good information.\n\n795\n00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.080\nIt was.\nAnything else we want to\n\n796\n00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.170\nthrow in on event systems or event logs?\n\n797\n00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.050\nI don't think so.\n\n798\n00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:40.700\nJust remember,\nget comfortable with doing it.\n\n799\n00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.950\nIf you're going to be supporting Windows\n7, it will save you a lot of time.\n\n800\n00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:46.000\nVery good.\nAll right, well, thank you, everybody, for\n\n801\n00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.010\ntuning in and watching.\n\n802\n00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.410\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n803\n00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.250\nAnd I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n804\n00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.097\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n805\n00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:57.230\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.780\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is the famous Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.120\nHow are you doing, Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.750\n>> I am doing fine today.\n\n6\n00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.410\nIt's another wonderful day here in Florida\nthat we get to be in air conditioning,\n\n7\n00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.210\nwhich I love, and so that's a great thing.\n\n8\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.740\nThat means we're ready to get\nstarted on some Windows 7 and\n\n9\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.650\nthis time we're gonna be taking a look\nat a couple of different utilities.\n\n10\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950\nWe are.\nToday we've got a good show continuing on\n\n11\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.440\nwith our Windows 7 as you said.\n\n12\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.350\nWe're going to be taking a look at the,\nwhere are we going?\n\n13\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.620\nThe task manager and the resource monitor.\n\n14\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.480\nRemember it's all about trying to make\nsure that these Windows 7 machines\n\n15\n00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.650\nare running well,\nthat their performance is acceptable,\n\n16\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.280\nthat they're not crashing all the time,\nthings like that.\n\n17\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.000\nAnd so Microsoft gives us a bunch\nof good tools that we can use.\n\n18\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.420\nTo do that, to keep an eye on our system.\n\n19\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.460\nTo find out what the heck is causing\nit to crash if it is crashing or run so\n\n20\n00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.640\nslow or what's choking the system of\ntaking up all those resources and\n\n21\n00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.380\nwe should maybe just start with\nTask Manager, do you think?\n\n22\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.350\n>> Yes, well when we start taking\na look at what we're talking about,\n\n23\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.910\nright, we as technicians,\nas people supporting Windows 7,\n\n24\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.990\nis very easy to just take\nsomeone's word and say, Okay,\n\n25\n00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.790\nyour machine's running slow, and you don't\nrealize that mental perception at times,\n\n26\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.350\nand whether or\nnot the machine's running slow.\n\n27\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.940\nIt could be that they're actually working\non tasks that's gonna require more\n\n28\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.640\nresources, or\nif they're just experiencing that because,\n\n29\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.720\nwell, they've just had a bad day so far.\n\n30\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.900\nAnd nothing that they're doing seems like\nit's actually working as fast as they\n\n31\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.640\nexpect it to be.\n\n32\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.630\n>> I've had a few of those,\na few of those.\n\n33\n00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.880\n>> You and I have both have had a few\nof those days where everything on your\n\n34\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.350\nmachine is just not actually working\nthe way that you think it is.\n\n35\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.220\nBut, is there a way to verify,\n\n36\n00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.530\nis there a way that we can actually\ntake the machine that we're given.\n\n37\n00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.330\nRunning Windows 7 and\ntake a look at the performance itself and\n\n38\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.200\nverify whether everything's\nactually working or not.\n\n39\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.990\nWhen it comes down to the performance\nof an individual PC or\n\n40\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.210\neven just a computer server,\n\n41\n00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.450\nwhatever it is, normally we're looking at\nfour different aspects of that computer.\n\n42\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.639\nThese are the big four,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n43\n00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.558\nthere's can be many things that actually\nhinder performance on the computer but\n\n44\n00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:19.646\nwhen it comes down to it, it's normally\nthe CPU okay, the RAM, the hard drive, and\n\n45\n00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:21.490\neven the network connection.\n\n46\n00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.180\nNow are there other things yes, but\n\n47\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.575\nthose are usually the four big ones\nthat we're actually concerned about.\n\n48\n00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:28.565\nPeg on any one of them.\n\n49\n00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:32.195\nNow once you get the utilization\non one of those resources,\n\n50\n00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:35.575\nhigher than any of the other ones, that\ngenerally actually starts to tell you that\n\n51\n00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:39.865\nthere may be a performance issue there\nthat may actually only be overcome by\n\n52\n00:02:39.865 --> 00:02:45.040\neither adding in additional something or\nby changing out the component or even\n\n53\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.830\nthat the systems actually so old that you\ncan't do anything but actually replace it.\n\n54\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.600\nSo that's what we actually\nwant to take a look at and\n\n55\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.930\nmake sure that you understand that.\n\n56\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.350\n>> Like a lot of my machines,\nthey're just too old, beyond all hope so.\n\n57\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.540\n>> Yeah it's not just a machine Mike.\n\n58\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.810\nI understand that.\n\n59\n00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.340\n>> Ouch.\n\n60\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.780\n>> Me too.\n\n61\n00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.556\nYeah, that was a a jab at me?\n\n62\n00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:06.207\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n63\n00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:08.040\nlet's look at the task manager first.\n\n64\n00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.580\nThis is a common tool a lot of you\nhave used it even people that aren't\n\n65\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.390\nin the IT field might be familiar with\ntask manager because once in a while,\n\n66\n00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.700\nwe've got to end an unresponsive task or\nprocess on a Windows system and\n\n67\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.430\nthis is where you've gone to do it.\n\n68\n00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.470\nA few different ways you\ncan get into task manager.\n\n69\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.240\nMy favorite way, probably the easiest way,\n\n70\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.720\nis just to right click there in your\ntaskbar and go start task manager.\n\n71\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.590\nOf course, you can get there\nthrough the Control Panel, and\n\n72\n00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.310\nyou should experiment with\ndifferent ways to open this guy up.\n\n73\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.630\nBut here’s my good, old Task Manager.\n\n74\n00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.680\nAnd we’re gonna start\nover here on the left.\n\n75\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.410\nAnd you can see there are several tabs.\n\n76\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.160\nJust kinda gonna walk\nthrough these different tabs.\n\n77\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.180\nAnd show you what information is\non each one of these tabs, and\n\n78\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.950\nwhat options we have available\non the different tabs.\n\n79\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.950\nThe first one is my Applications tab,\n\n80\n00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.280\nand I wonder what kind of\nstuff we see here, Ronnie?\n\n81\n00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.520\n>> When we start seeing the applications,\n\n82\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.850\nthese are the programs that You have\nactually launched from Windows itself.\n\n83\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.990\nSo remember that in the background,\nonce Windows starts up,\n\n84\n00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.070\nit normally does launch programs on its\nown in the background to help actually\n\n85\n00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.270\nallow you to have the experience that\nyou want to, but a lot of times when you\n\n86\n00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.520\nare actually running a program,\nyou choose to run Internet Explorer.\n\n87\n00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.250\nYou choose to run whatever word\nprocessing program that you're using, or\n\n88\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.030\nspreadsheet program.\n\n89\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.260\nYou're going to see that that\nwill actually end up appearing\n\n90\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.280\nin that application tab.\n\n91\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.790\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhy is that actually so\n\n92\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.830\nimportant because sometimes remember that\nwhen the program gets unresponsive, and\n\n93\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.305\nnow all of sudden you're clicking on that\nlittle red x in the right hand corner.\n\n94\n00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:39.510\n>> [LAUGH] And you're like, well,\nnothing is actually working.\n\n95\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.610\nI can't do anything about that.\n\n96\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.520\nWindows went ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.030\nsaid, look, we need a place that we can\nactually shut this thing down, right?\n\n98\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.560\n>> Exactly.\n\n99\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.510\nSo on my screen now, I've launched\na couple of applications, and\n\n100\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.390\nI can see them list here.\n\n101\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.250\nI've got calculator,\n\n102\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.080\nstatus running, Internet Explorer who\ncannot display the web page is running.\n\n103\n00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.410\nAt least the program is running.\n\n104\n00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.490\nIt might not be doing what it's supposed\n>> Supposed to do.\n\n105\n00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.050\nAnd then I've got Paint opened up,\nand it's running as well.\n\n106\n00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.660\nSo on the applications have,\nas Ronnie said,\n\n107\n00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.300\nI can see all the applications\nthat are running.\n\n108\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.000\nAnd if one of these was not doing well,\nlike maybe, oops, well let's close that.\n\n109\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.940\nMy mouse is trying to double click\non everything that I do recently for\n\n110\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.520\nsome reason.\n\n111\n00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.410\nBut let me get Task Manager back up here.\n\n112\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.230\nLet's say I want to end Paint.\n\n113\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.850\nRight?\n\n114\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.888\nI can come in, well son of a gun.\n\n115\n00:05:25.888 --> 00:05:29.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's try that one more time,\n\n116\n00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.330\nand I'll just keep entering them\nby double clicking on them.\n\n117\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.060\nThat's not the way it's supposed to work,\nnormally you select it, and\n\n118\n00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.724\nlet's say I want to end calculator\nsince it's the only one left.\n\n119\n00:05:37.724 --> 00:05:43.610\n[LAUGH] And all I have to do is come\ndown here and choose end task and\n\n120\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.010\nit should kill that process, or\nthat task I should say, that application.\n\n121\n00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.880\nYou can also launch new tasks from here.\n\n122\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.711\nSo if I wanted to do calc.exe,\n\n123\n00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:58.320\nall right I could actually launch it, you\nsee it open up there in the background.\n\n124\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.980\nYou can launch new tasks from here,\nand sometimes that can be handy.\n\n125\n00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.140\nI'm gonna show you a real good\nexample of that in just a minute.\n\n126\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.930\nSo I can end unresponsive\napplications through here.\n\n127\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.890\nNow, sometimes however, if you try,\nif the application itself is hung up,\n\n128\n00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.970\nsometimes coming in here and right\nclicking on it or choosing end task, or\n\n129\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.450\nselecting and\nchoosing end task doesn't work.\n\n130\n00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.260\nBecause it's gonna send a command to\nthe application and tell it to close.\n\n131\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.690\nWell if the application\nis completely hung up,\n\n132\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.710\nIt might not respond\nto that close request.\n\n133\n00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.675\nThat's where this processes\ntab comes into play now.\n\n134\n00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:32.640\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n135\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.700\nThe processes tab shows me all the\ndifferent processes that are running, and\n\n136\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.000\napplications might have several\nprocesses going on in the background.\n\n137\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.470\nWe can typically right click on this\nthing and choose go to processes.\n\n138\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.410\nHere's a calculator on the applications\ntab, I right click on it and\n\n139\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.770\ngo to process and\nthere's my calculator.exe process.\n\n140\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.360\nRight, and\n\n141\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.680\nagain certain programs have more than\none process running in the background.\n\n142\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.190\nIf you ever come to a situation where I\n\n143\n00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.830\ncan't end it through this normal end task\noption, it's still sitting there and\n\n144\n00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.920\nit won't go away, going to the process and\nend the process itself.\n\n145\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.470\nWhen you end that process,\nthat will usually kill anything,\n\n146\n00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.970\nwhether the application is responding or\nnot\n\n147\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.120\nyou kill the process that it's generated\nand that typically kills the application.\n\n148\n00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.670\nThe other thing you can do on this screen\nis notice how I've already checked this\n\n149\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.720\nshow processes from all users.\n\n150\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.820\nSometimes when you come in here by default\nyour only going to see processes for\n\n151\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.450\nwhoever you are logged on as currently.\n\n152\n00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.460\nIf I'm an admin or troubleshooting with\nWindows you can do the switch users right?\n\n153\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.250\nSo I can have several people logged on to\nthis machine I can choose show processes\n\n154\n00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.110\nfrom all users that would include\nother users logged onto the machine.\n\n155\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.420\nLike, I'm logged on as\nadministrator right now, but\n\n156\n00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.610\nI can see that Mike has some\nprocesses running as well.\n\n157\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.065\nThe system has some processes running.\n\n158\n00:07:52.065 --> 00:07:56.568\nSo, by checking that, I get to see\neverything that's going on there.\n\n159\n00:07:56.568 --> 00:07:58.485\nAnd then on the next tab.\n\n160\n00:07:58.485 --> 00:08:04.190\nI've got my services tab and this is where\nwe can see our running services, right?\n\n161\n00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.790\n>> When we start taking a look at\nservices, if you don't have a great\n\n162\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.650\nanalogy for actually understanding this,\nremember that Windows itself,\n\n163\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.980\neven though it's the operating\nsystem that we're using.\n\n164\n00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.290\nIt also depends on a lot of other programs\nrunning in the background to provide for\n\n165\n00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.750\nus a working operating system that you and\nI can interact with and\n\n166\n00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.620\nit can do some of the simple things.\n\n167\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.780\nSo for example, right if you\nare actually printing, to a printer,\n\n168\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.950\nwell you can go ahead from your\napplication and say all right print.\n\n169\n00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:36.450\nWell, if there is not some component,\nsome program in the background,\n\n170\n00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.460\nsome service in the background\nthat's running, it doesn't care.\n\n171\n00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.260\nYou're sending it, it's not actually\ngetting anything that's receiving it that\n\n172\n00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.390\nthen can connect to the printer to send.\n\n173\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.970\nServices, the easiest way that\nI always think about it is\n\n174\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:51.000\nwhen the computer goes ahead and starts\nup, services are normally like the little\n\n175\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.370\napplications of programs that Windows\nitself chooses to actually launch.\n\n176\n00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.350\nTo give you the better experience,\nthat you actually want so\n\n177\n00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.920\nthat you can actually make sure that you\nget done the things that you need to.\n\n178\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.220\nSo, whereas the application or\nthings that you actually go and go to,\n\n179\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.860\nstart and you type in Word for\nyour word processing program.\n\n180\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.350\nWell, services are things that Windows\nsays I'm actually choosing to launch these\n\n181\n00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.190\nthings up in the background as well.\n\n182\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.940\nNow the nice thing about the services is a\ncouple of different thing that we rely on\n\n183\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:27.540\nas technicians, our 100% gateway of\nlast resort to fix a problem sometimes.\n\n184\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.780\nIt's simple.\nReboot the computer Okay?\n\n185\n00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.260\nAnd believe it or not it works so\n\n186\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.466\noften that it's amazing that that's\nnot our first guess a lot of times.\n\n187\n00:09:35.466 --> 00:09:38.920\nBut sometimes remember that a user\ncould be in the middle of actually\n\n188\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.840\ndoing something, they're right there and\n\n189\n00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.130\nthey're doing something, such as having\nactually print that document and\n\n190\n00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.950\nthe entire machines actually just kind of\nwaiting for that document to be printed.\n\n191\n00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.010\nAnd they forget to save it and\nyou go and reboot the computer.\n\n192\n00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.940\nWell, now all their work is lost and gone.\n\n193\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.160\nWell, by actually being able\nto go in here to services and\n\n194\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.180\nmaybe restart the print\nspooler service itself,\n\n195\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.180\nyou're actually telling that service\nto kind of restart or reboot.\n\n196\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.260\nAnd you're not actually taking\neverything out of the mix, to try and\n\n197\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.000\nget that thing to actually come back on.\n\n198\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.190\nSo it's a great utility that really\npinpoints what we need to be able to\n\n199\n00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.520\ncontrol right then.\n\n200\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.300\nAnd have it actually restart,\nstop or do whatever we want to.\n\n201\n00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.730\n>> All right, so back here in services,\nlet's take a look.\n\n202\n00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.580\nAs Ronnie was saying,\n\n203\n00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.840\nwe can see what services are running,\nlike say the event log service.\n\n204\n00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.780\nWell, this something I didn't launch this,\nright?\n\n205\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.220\nWindows, when it started up,\nit launched the event log service.\n\n206\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.440\nAnd this is what allows the system and\n\n207\n00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.000\napplications to log events into that\nevent viewer, into that event log system.\n\n208\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.980\nIf it was hung up or crashed,\nI could end it here.\n\n209\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.300\nI could right click on this and\nI could choose stop service.\n\n210\n00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.140\nOr I could go find the process, I could\njump back over to the processes tab, and\n\n211\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:47.490\nthere's the SVC hose process that that\nservice is running in the background.\n\n212\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.870\nYou also have a button here to take\nyou to the actual services console.\n\n213\n00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.930\nThere is an MMC called services,\nwhere I can come in here and\n\n214\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.320\nI could do more detailed work\nwith the service itself,\n\n215\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.560\nlike if I wanted to find\nthat event log service.\n\n216\n00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.270\nWhy are these not sorted?\n\n217\n00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.660\nAnd I don't see it in there now.\n\n218\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.070\nThat's great, but in here you can\nnot only stop and start services but\n\n219\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.180\nI can choose whether they start\nup automatically, whether\n\n220\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.970\nthey start manually, whether they're\non delayed start and things like that.\n\n221\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.980\nSo an easy way to jump over\nto that services console\n\n222\n00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.570\nright there from the services\ntab in task manager.\n\n223\n00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.950\nAnd you know I forgot to show you guys,\nI was gonna show you how to end and\n\n224\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:30.950\nlaunch a process.\n\n225\n00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.810\nI forgot that so\nlet me jump back over here real quick.\n\n226\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.680\nI'm just gonna end Explorer.exe.\n\n227\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.260\nSo I've found my process.\n\n228\n00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.740\nAnd I click End Process.\n\n229\n00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.890\nAnd End Process.\n\n230\n00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.780\nWell, Explorer's kind of important, right?\n\n231\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.890\nThat's what gives me my task bar,\nmy start menu and all that good stuff.\n\n232\n00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.200\nSo I can come over here to applications,\nand I can choose new task, and\n\n233\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.620\nI can launch Explorer.exe and I hopefully\n\n234\n00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.600\nwill get my task bar back, and my start\nmenu back, and all of that good stuff.\n\n235\n00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.680\nAnd remember, you can get to that task\nmanager by going to your log off screen.\n\n236\n00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.360\nI did my control alt delete there and\none of the options is start task manager.\n\n237\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.930\nSo if you're ever in a situation where\nyou've lost your interface like that and\n\n238\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.810\nI've had to do this several times,\nwhere the interface locks up,\n\n239\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.240\nI can't get to File Explorer,\nmy start menu's not working.\n\n240\n00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.300\nI can go in there and kill Explorer and\nrelaunch it, and if I can't right click\n\n241\n00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.440\non my task bar because it's not there to\nlaunch task manager, well I can always\n\n242\n00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.630\ngo to my log off screen, and I can launch\ntask manager from down there as well.\n\n243\n00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.190\nSo couple little tricks\nthat are handy to know.\n\n244\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.480\n>> That is one of the handiest\nthings that you can have happen and\n\n245\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.790\nit may not have happened to you yet,\nbut it will.\n\n246\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.030\nWhere one day you come in and\nall the sudden the mouse actually is gone.\n\n247\n00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:51.000\nIt's disappeared from your screen or\nit's locked up and\n\n248\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.270\nyou're not sure what else is happening.\n\n249\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.320\nYou know that you can type,\nyou can do other things.\n\n250\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.560\nYou can always go ahead and do that\ncontrol alt delete a lot of times, and\n\n251\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.720\nactually get to that screen and then you\ncan actually use your tab to be able to\n\n252\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.850\ngo down and select that option and be able\nto do exactly what Mike's talking about.\n\n253\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.360\nSo, easy navigation actually used\n\n254\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.040\nas mouse codependant as I would\nsay the majority of us are.\n\n255\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.570\nIt's hard to actually remember that.\n\n256\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.630\nBut, I have actually had to do that\nvery thing when the mouse died.\n\n257\n00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.180\nAnd since Mike is actually\ntalking about his mouse there,\n\n258\n00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.610\nI don't think it's a battery problem.\n\n259\n00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:26.260\nBut if it was a battery problem, he wasn't\nable to do that, it was kinda stuck there.\n\n260\n00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.110\nWell this is something that can\nreally help him out in being able to\n\n261\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.300\nnavigate that way.\n\n262\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.370\nAnd everything that we're showing you,\nif you are actually not good at typing and\n\n263\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.430\nnot good at doing things, notice that\njust about everything that we're doing\n\n264\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.330\ncan actually be done by point and click.\n\n265\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.390\nThat means that you don't have to actually\nknow a lot of different commands and\n\n266\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.060\nstuff, but as easily as actually\njust using one finger or\n\n267\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.490\nactually navigation by using tab and\nsome different things.\n\n268\n00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.570\nYou can actually have an incredible\ncontrol over the system here and\n\n269\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.310\nits amazing about what this task\nmanager really lets you do.\n\n270\n00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.180\n>> It really is.\n\n271\n00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.702\nSomething that you've\ngot to be familiar with.\n\n272\n00:13:58.702 --> 00:14:01.210\nAll right, so\nlet's keep moving through these tabs.\n\n273\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.110\nWe go past services,\nwe get to performance.\n\n274\n00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.420\nNow the performance tab is\nshowing me what's going\n\n275\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.400\nin the system performance wise.\n\n276\n00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.200\nAs Ronnie mentioned, performance is\nrelative, and we're going to dive more\n\n277\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.480\ninto that when we get into a couple of\nour other tools but this is giving me\n\n278\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.370\na high level over view of a couple of\nthose main sub systems if you will.\n\n279\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.800\nI got my CPU and my memory utilization.\n\n280\n00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.500\nI've got a nice little graph over here\nthat's showing me usage history for\n\n281\n00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.530\nthis CPU as well as memory.\n\n282\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.420\nNow below that it looks at my\nphysical memory, my kernel memory and\n\n283\n00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.480\nthen some information about the system,\nlike how many handles and threads and\n\n284\n00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.440\nprocesses I have running.\n\n285\n00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.600\nGot that world record for\n\n286\n00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.890\nMicrosoft at three hour up time\non this machine without a reboot.\n\n287\n00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.100\nSo we're doing great there.\n\n288\n00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.610\nNot a lot you can do with it.\n\n289\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.700\nIt's all read only, basically.\n\n290\n00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.210\nIt's real time information as this\nhistory scrolls off to the left,\n\n291\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.520\nit's gone forever, I'm not saving it but\n\n292\n00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.540\nit is showing me how the system is\nperforming right this very minute.\n\n293\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.350\nI can click on this and\nget a detailed view.\n\n294\n00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.840\nI've never really found that\nall that useful Ronnie.\n\n295\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.555\nI don't know about you but\nit doesn't do much for me.\n\n296\n00:15:08.555 --> 00:15:10.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> Usually if you are,\n\n297\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.440\nlet's say that you choose\nto do something like I do,\n\n298\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.880\nhopefully you don't\nnecessarily need to do this.\n\n299\n00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:21.190\nBut if you're like me and yes you tend to\nrun a lot of virtual machines at one time,\n\n300\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.655\nwell believe it or\n\n301\n00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:25.935\nnot your CPU is probably gonna\nget pegged every once in a while.\n\n302\n00:15:25.935 --> 00:15:28.445\nYour memory usage is gonna get pegged.\n\n303\n00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:32.776\nAnd if you're trying to balance that out,\nin other words, what's gonna still give\n\n304\n00:15:32.776 --> 00:15:36.802\nyou the ability to work with the machine\nversus lock up when you actually launch\n\n305\n00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:40.889\nall that, you may actually choose to use\nthat view as you launch that one machine\n\n306\n00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:45.181\nto see how that CPU to utilization's going\non and also the RAM utilization as well.\n\n307\n00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:49.017\nThose are balances you have to worry about\nwhen you actually don't have a lot of RAM\n\n308\n00:15:49.017 --> 00:15:49.918\non your computer.\n\n309\n00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:54.492\nAnd even though 8 gigs is a lot I found\nmyself running out which kinda strange.\n\n310\n00:15:54.492 --> 00:15:58.230\nI would never said five years ago that,\n8 gigs of RAM?\n\n311\n00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.470\nI've never run out of spaces.\n\n312\n00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.560\nThat's what I would say.\n\n313\n00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.680\nAnd now I find myself, with that need.\n\n314\n00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.700\nBut that's what you're\nactually using here.\n\n315\n00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.860\nIf you happen to run a gigantic program on\nyour machine, like Auto CAD or something\n\n316\n00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.020\nlike that takes a lot of generational\npower and stuff, but you're like, why is\n\n317\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.030\nit running so slow, well you can actually\ntake a look here and see what's happening.\n\n318\n00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.560\nSome of the things that you actually do,\nright here,\n\n319\n00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.770\nyou're gonna actually be able to see that.\n\n320\n00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.260\nMost of the time when\npeople are looking at this.\n\n321\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.290\nAnd especially in a work environment and\nstuff.\n\n322\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.660\nIt really is to find out is here actually\na physical problem on the machine?\n\n323\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.980\nIn other words, is it the hard drive?\n\n324\n00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.600\nIs it the RAM?\n\n325\n00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.130\nIs it the CPU?\n\n326\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.965\nAnd trying to figure out and\nisolate what that problem may be,\n\n327\n00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:42.165\nespecially when it's a performance issue.\n\n328\n00:16:42.165 --> 00:16:43.515\nSo normally what we're looking for here,\n\n329\n00:16:43.515 --> 00:16:47.985\nof course, then is the high\nutilization of one versus the other.\n\n330\n00:16:47.985 --> 00:16:50.860\nNow if I have a high utilization on both,\nbecause I'm running something.\n\n331\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.756\nThat makes sense, right?\n\n332\n00:16:51.756 --> 00:16:55.404\nBecause it's like that a very intensive\nprogram and it takes a lot of room and\n\n333\n00:16:55.404 --> 00:16:56.601\nRAM, that makes sense.\n\n334\n00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:59.960\nBut what if I'm actually\nnot using a lot of RAM, but\n\n335\n00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.050\nthat CPU is just spiked high like crazy.\n\n336\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.330\nWell, it could be that whatever program\nI'm running is just now overwhelming\n\n337\n00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.540\nthat CPU.\n\n338\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.310\nAnd that's when you go well,\nthere's really nothing I can do except for\n\n339\n00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.820\nreplace the actual machine.\n\n340\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.420\nWe have to run that every day.\n\n341\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.890\nI can't just come in here and\njust go okay,\n\n342\n00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.750\njust close out that program,\nthen that might actually be an indication.\n\n343\n00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.300\nSame thing with the hard drive,\nif you're constantly getting pegged a bit.\n\n344\n00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.260\nWell, then you notice actually having\nto swap in and out and that's when\n\n345\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.670\nyou have to start realizing, hey we may\nactually need a little bit more RAM.\n\n346\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:33.980\nOr if it's not responsive in that way,\neverything else is low but the hard drive\n\n347\n00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.100\nutilization, well then you know it might\nbe time for a new hard drive as well.\n\n348\n00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.910\nSo there's a lot of different things\nthat you can take a look at just from\n\n349\n00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:40.770\nthis one tab.\n\n350\n00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:41.870\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n351\n00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.000\nAnd we're gonna take a look at this\nbutton down here, the resource monitor.\n\n352\n00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.010\nIn just a minute we'll show you that.\n\n353\n00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.970\nBut let's finish the other\ntwo tabs we got left.\n\n354\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.320\nWe got the Networking Tab.\n\n355\n00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.830\nThe Networking Tab shows me, you'll\nnever guess, networking information.\n\n356\n00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.950\nAnd notice that it shows me\nall the network adapters.\n\n357\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.480\nI installed two network adapters in this\nvirtual machine so we could see that.\n\n358\n00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.320\nBut it does give me both network adapters.\n\n359\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.780\nIt does have that double-click capability\nwhere I can kind of zoom in and\n\n360\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.205\nget rid of the rest of the information\non there if I choose to do so.\n\n361\n00:18:09.205 --> 00:18:11.880\nDouble-click again and\nit brings me back out.\n\n362\n00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.290\nI can also add,\nremove some columns from here.\n\n363\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.920\nI can do bytes sent and bytes received,\nlet's see if I can turn those guys on,\n\n364\n00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:26.420\nand bytes received, I'll make this\na little bit wider and where'd they go?\n\n365\n00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.378\n>> Yeah, you're not gonna see much\nutilization in this one because you\n\n366\n00:18:29.378 --> 00:18:31.472\nactually have a gigabyte\nnetwork adapter on it.\n\n367\n00:18:31.472 --> 00:18:36.003\nAnd unless you actually start screaming\nsomething from your computer regularly\n\n368\n00:18:36.003 --> 00:18:40.250\nYou're probably not gonna see that\nutilization rate as you go up.\n\n369\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.110\nThis has actually been around since\nthe days that we were actually on\n\n370\n00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.270\nall a single bus network.\n\n371\n00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.700\nIn other words,\nwe were actually using hubs.\n\n372\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.151\nAnd the utilization behind that is because\nbefore I send a print job or actually sent\n\n373\n00:18:52.151 --> 00:18:56.618\na file out there, I needed to actually see\nwhat the utilization was on the network.\n\n374\n00:18:56.618 --> 00:19:00.282\nCuz if I sent it out where there was\nhigh utilization, it could get there,\n\n375\n00:19:00.282 --> 00:19:04.620\nbut it could get there in a long time,\nso I might actually wait to do that.\n\n376\n00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.680\nIn this one it does actually help me to\nmonitor what goes in and out of my system,\n\n377\n00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.430\nBut as far as the real usage of it that's\ngonna help you pinpoint something,\n\n378\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.260\nit's probably not gonna\nhelp you pinpoint a lot.\n\n379\n00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:20.740\nThe only time I've ever actually seen it\neffectively work on my computer is when we\n\n380\n00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.470\nwere actually running the same streaming\nsoftware that Mike's running, but we were\n\n381\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.670\nnot sure exactly how to run it so we used\nto run it over the wireless connection.\n\n382\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.930\nSo I had that actually turned up and\nI saw it on the wireless that\n\n383\n00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:37.430\non the wireless connection what Mike's\noutput's actually is about 45 megabits.\n\n384\n00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.830\nWell, our wireless is only 54 megabits.\n\n385\n00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.600\nAnd so that's when we realize that\nthat was where some of the bottleneck\n\n386\n00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.880\nissues where happening.\n\n387\n00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.461\nOnce we actually said, all right,\nwe're gonna just wire in,\n\n388\n00:19:46.461 --> 00:19:50.016\nwe're not gonna actually just go wireless,\nwe actually stopped experiencing a lot of\n\n389\n00:19:50.016 --> 00:19:53.210\nthe dropout problems that we were\nhaving in displaying our monitors.\n\n390\n00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.260\nSo it was helpful,\none time as far as I know.\n\n391\n00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.460\nI'm not saying you can't use it for\nany other reason but, for\n\n392\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.060\nme, that was the one time.\n\n393\n00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.240\nI was like in ten years there it is.\n\n394\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.010\nThat's the reason why have it.\n\n395\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.780\n>> I'll tell you why I've used it\nbefore and you've ever been on the web,\n\n396\n00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.260\nyou're trying to download something, and\nthe progress bar is just not moving.\n\n397\n00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.120\nIt's just sitting there.\n\n398\n00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.770\nSo it's like, come on.\n\n399\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.170\nAnd I can come in here and\nI can see well look,\n\n400\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.020\nthere's no network traffic going on,\nright?\n\n401\n00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.890\nSo I know that it's not my\nnetwork bottlenecking everything.\n\n402\n00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.740\nIt's probably some reason the website\nis taking some time getting\n\n403\n00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.930\nready to send me that files.\n\n404\n00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.550\nSo, maybe I'll be use it for\nsomething like that as well.\n\n405\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.945\nAnd then the last tab is\nsimply the users tab.\n\n406\n00:20:31.945 --> 00:20:32.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And this is gonna\n\n407\n00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.420\nshow me all the different users\nthat are currently connected to,\n\n408\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.830\neither remotely or\ninteractively with this machine.\n\n409\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.920\nAnd from here,\nI can do a couple of cool things.\n\n410\n00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.371\nI can send them a message as well\nas disconnect or log them off.\n\n411\n00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:52.381\nRight now I'm logged on as administrator,\nI can see my status as active and\n\n412\n00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:54.710\nI've got a console session running.\n\n413\n00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.550\nMeaning I'm local,\nI'm interactive with this machine,\n\n414\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.270\nif I had a somebody\nremoted into this machine.\n\n415\n00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.350\nWe would see that there as well.\n\n416\n00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:07.260\nRemember with a client operating systems,\nyou can't really have somebody remoted in\n\n417\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.850\nas well as logged on interactively so\nI couldn't show you that here.\n\n418\n00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:14.050\nBut I do have another user account\nthat's logged in this machine.\n\n419\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:18.625\nNow when I did the switch user,\nit shows their state as disconnected but\n\n420\n00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:20.665\nthat's not the same as being logged off,\nright?\n\n421\n00:21:20.665 --> 00:21:25.515\nDisconnected means, their applications are\nstill running, in fact if we go back to\n\n422\n00:21:25.515 --> 00:21:29.985\nprocesses I'll see that Mike, that user\naccount does have some processes running.\n\n423\n00:21:31.095 --> 00:21:35.345\nSo they are taking up resources and what\ncan happen with that user switching and\n\n424\n00:21:35.345 --> 00:21:36.910\nswitch user capabilities.\n\n425\n00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.110\nYou can have people switch it,\nmy parents were bad about this.\n\n426\n00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.389\nI have had some co-workers\nthat were bad about this.\n\n427\n00:21:41.389 --> 00:21:46.210\nInstead of logging off they would just\nswitch user accounts to another one.\n\n428\n00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.680\nAnd before you know it there\ncan be four or five or\n\n429\n00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.720\nsix users that are logged\nonto that system.\n\n430\n00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.350\nTheir status is disconnected but their\nprofile is loaded up, that's being stored\n\n431\n00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:58.150\nmemory, they've got applications\nrunning that's taking up resources.\n\n432\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.210\nSo if I've got someone that I wanna\nkick off I can do it from here.\n\n433\n00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.480\nI can say why is my system running so\nslow?\n\n434\n00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.640\nOh, look there are seven different user\naccounts logged on to this system and\n\n435\n00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.490\nfour of them aren't even at work today.\n\n436\n00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.220\nSo I can come in here and\nI can do a couple of things.\n\n437\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.110\nIf they were remote I\ncould disconnect them.\n\n438\n00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:20.120\nIf they are already disconnected I can log\nthem off I can also send them a message.\n\n439\n00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.326\nAnd it's just gonna pop\na little net send on there and\n\n440\n00:22:25.326 --> 00:22:29.010\nI'm gonna say, are you still here?\n\n441\n00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:29.654\nAnd I'll go ahead and send that.\n\n442\n00:22:29.654 --> 00:22:33.973\nAnd then what the other user would see\nif I switch over to that other account.\n\n443\n00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.370\nWe'll log on as Mike.\n\n444\n00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:50.770\nAnd here we go, I get a message from\nlab administrator saying, are you here?\n\n445\n00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.810\nIf I was, I could maybe call him up or\nsay something.\n\n446\n00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:59.650\nIf I wasn't though, if I didn't respond,\nI might put something in that message.\n\n447\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.270\nHey look, if you're still using\nthis computer, give me a call, or\n\n448\n00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.610\nstop by my office, or something like that.\n\n449\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:10.000\nBut if they don't respond,\nI can assume, well, incorrectly or\n\n450\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.810\nnot, what assuming spells.\n\n451\n00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.760\nBut I can say, all right, Mike's not here.\n\n452\n00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.310\nHe's not responding to my message.\n\n453\n00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.650\nI'm tired of him sucking up the resources\nand slowing this machine down.\n\n454\n00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.680\nI'm gonna go ahead and log him off.\n\n455\n00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.700\nSo I click log off.\n\n456\n00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.610\nIt says, are you sure?\n\n457\n00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.230\nBecause they might lose data.\n\n458\n00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.670\nSo something that you've\ngot to keep in mind,\n\n459\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:29.230\nyou don't want to just kick them off any\nold time you see them on your machine.\n\n460\n00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.020\nIf they've got a Word\ndocument half typed and\n\n461\n00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.790\nnot saved,\nthey could potentially lose that.\n\n462\n00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.990\nNow you just log off user, and\n\n463\n00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:39.570\nbada bing, they're gone, and\nnow some of those resources are freed up.\n\n464\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.267\nIf I go back over to Processes,\nnotice if I sort this by User Name,\n\n465\n00:23:43.267 --> 00:23:45.642\nthere's no Mike listed in here anymore.\n\n466\n00:23:45.642 --> 00:23:49.694\nSo I freed up those resources so\nthat my system can perform better.\n\n467\n00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:53.422\nAnd it wasn't necessary,\nMike wasn't even here today, so\n\n468\n00:23:53.422 --> 00:23:55.699\nEasy way to free up those resources.\n\n469\n00:23:55.699 --> 00:23:58.460\n>> It really is.\nIt's a great little utility for us.\n\n470\n00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.980\nAnd we normally take this, and\n\n471\n00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.830\nwe tie it together with something\nthat we call that Resource Monitor.\n\n472\n00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:07.967\nEspecially if we're trying to hone in on\nwhat specifically may be causing us some\n\n473\n00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:08.560\nissues.\n\n474\n00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.572\n>> Exactly.\n\n475\n00:24:09.572 --> 00:24:12.120\nAll right, so I told you guys\nthat we would go back over to\n\n476\n00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.380\nthis Resource Monitor, so\nlet's not make a liar out of me.\n\n477\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.350\nBack over to the Performance Tab,\nI'm going to click on Resource Monitor.\n\n478\n00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:24.120\nNow we've had Task Manager in Windows\nsince as far back as I can remember.\n\n479\n00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.010\nResource Monitor is relatively new.\n\n480\n00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.420\nVista, I believe,\nis when this one came out.\n\n481\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.900\nAnd Ronnie, I know I like to call\nit Task Manager on steroids,\n\n482\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.400\nis really what it comes down to, right?\n\n483\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.010\n>> It really is.\n\n484\n00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.160\nYou get so much more detail,\nespecially if you think that there's\n\n485\n00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.480\none particular program causing it,\nwhereas the other one is really a summary.\n\n486\n00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.120\nYou still get the summary information that\nyou see over on the right-hand side, but\n\n487\n00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.330\nthat's pretty much about it.\n\n488\n00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.580\nBut notice that over here on the left\n-hand side, you actually not\n\n489\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.780\nonly get an overview, which is a summary,\nwith more detail behind it.\n\n490\n00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.530\nBut notice that each one of those\ntabs we well, CPU, Memory, Disc,\n\n491\n00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:02.810\nand Network, again all those performance\nthings that we're actually talking about.\n\n492\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.750\nAnd each one actually\nallows you to expand and\n\n493\n00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.050\nallows you to see some\nof the different things.\n\n494\n00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.530\nAnd this is where if you actually are one\nof those persons with a keen eye,\n\n495\n00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.260\nand you're looking for\na specific instance, or\n\n496\n00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.990\nyou actually are suspecting\na specific problem happening or\n\n497\n00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.790\na program causing it, you can actually\ntry and filter it out right here.\n\n498\n00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.400\n>> Absolutely.\n\n499\n00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.380\nSo you can see, as Ronnie said,\njust detailed information.\n\n500\n00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.690\nThis first screen is\na lot like Task Manager.\n\n501\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.850\nI can see what's going on in CPU,\nwhat's going on the disk,\n\n502\n00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:32.602\nthe network if there was anything,\nas well as RAM or memory.\n\n503\n00:25:32.602 --> 00:25:37.268\nLook at these nice little mini graphs\nhere that show me some information.\n\n504\n00:25:37.268 --> 00:25:41.080\nAnd then on the left or the right pane\nover here, I've got a similar view to what\n\n505\n00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.530\nwe saw in Task Manager, CPU and memory,\nbut I also get disk and network.\n\n506\n00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.850\nAnd this is just the Overview tab, right?\n\n507\n00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:52.590\nI mean, this is a lot of information,\nand I have not left the Overview tab.\n\n508\n00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.240\nIf I want to see a little more\ndetailed information on the CPU,\n\n509\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.830\nI go to the CPU tab.\n\n510\n00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:02.290\nAnd now I've got processes, I've got\nservices, I've got associated handles,\n\n511\n00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:05.080\nI've got associated modules.\n\n512\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.384\nSo if I come up here and\nselect VirtualBox, for example.\n\n513\n00:26:09.384 --> 00:26:14.580\nAll right, now I can see what\nservices the VirtualBox is running,\n\n514\n00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.040\nwhat handles it's running, and\nwhat associated modules it's running.\n\n515\n00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.250\nWhat's really cool, that's what these\nlittle check marks are for over here,\n\n516\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:26.570\nis we can filter it down to see\na particular process or service.\n\n517\n00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.910\nI see the totals.\n\n518\n00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:29.940\nI wanna know what VirtualBox is using.\n\n519\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.460\nWell, now I can see that.\n\n520\n00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.700\nAnd when I go to these other tabs, it's\nalready filtered by that same VirtualBox.\n\n521\n00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.520\nI've got memory over here,\nI've got disk, as well as disk activity.\n\n522\n00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.560\nNotice it's filtered by VBox service.\n\n523\n00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.400\nI got Network, and I come over here,\nand I can see filtered by VBox service.\n\n524\n00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:48.930\nAll right?\n\n525\n00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.542\nAnother cool thing that I always like\nto show is when you filter this,\n\n526\n00:26:52.542 --> 00:26:54.847\nnot only does it filter\nall the other tabs for\n\n527\n00:26:54.847 --> 00:26:59.169\nthat particular item that you've selected,\nwatch this little graph over here.\n\n528\n00:26:59.169 --> 00:27:03.278\nIf I go and take, I don't know,\nPerfMon usually is a good one.\n\n529\n00:27:03.278 --> 00:27:05.036\nYou'll see that it does that filtering,\nbut\n\n530\n00:27:05.036 --> 00:27:07.095\nlook at the orange line\nit put on my graph.\n\n531\n00:27:07.095 --> 00:27:10.790\nThe green graph represents\nmy total CPU usage.\n\n532\n00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.730\nThat orange shows me the percentage\nof that usage that's being used by\n\n533\n00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:15.950\nPerformance Monitor.\n\n534\n00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.720\nBecause I know I've launched Resource\nMonitor here, Performance Monitor is\n\n535\n00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.230\nwhat's in the background feeding a lot of\nthis information over to Resource Monitor.\n\n536\n00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.990\nSo I knew it would be\nsucking up some resources.\n\n537\n00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.120\nSo that's really cool.\n\n538\n00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.990\nI've done copy processes,\n\n539\n00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:34.300\nwhere I've gone from hard drive to hard\ndrive, hard drive to USB hard drive.\n\n540\n00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.793\nAnd I can compare the two in here.\n\n541\n00:27:35.793 --> 00:27:38.359\nAnd look at the read and\nwrite speeds and things like that.\n\n542\n00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:41.220\nYou can do some really neat stuff in here.\n\n543\n00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.815\nIt is all still read only,\nlike Task Manager.\n\n544\n00:27:44.815 --> 00:27:46.049\nI can end a task.\n\n545\n00:27:46.049 --> 00:27:49.114\nAnd that's about all I can do.\n\n546\n00:27:49.114 --> 00:27:54.635\nEnd a task, end a process,\nend a process tree, suspend a process.\n\n547\n00:27:54.635 --> 00:27:56.420\nNot a lot more.\n\n548\n00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.175\nIt's real-time data, meaning that I\ncan't save any of this information.\n\n549\n00:28:00.175 --> 00:28:02.260\nIf it'll let me uncheck that.\n\n550\n00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.660\nI can't save any of this information.\n\n551\n00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.330\nSo as soon as this graph information\nscrolls off to the left,\n\n552\n00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:08.230\nit's gonna be gone.\n\n553\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.250\nI can't go back and retrieve it, right?\n\n554\n00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.250\n>> Yeah,\nthere is just a lot of detail in here.\n\n555\n00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.070\nBut usually more than I'm ever\nactually going to try and pinpoint.\n\n556\n00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:20.640\nBut if I actually did realize that there\nis only one program that I'm suspecting,\n\n557\n00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.810\nthat I think is causing this,\nI can go in and actually find out,\n\n558\n00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.340\nis that the one that's really hogging\nup all the resources on my computer or\n\n559\n00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.520\nnot, and even find the details about it.\n\n560\n00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.060\nAnd you can't beat that.\n\n561\n00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.060\nIt's not an extra program you have to buy.\n\n562\n00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.640\nNow, are there actually\nother programs out there?\n\n563\n00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.380\nYou better believe it.\n\n564\n00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.990\nThere's a ton of other programs out there,\nthat will actually do all this.\n\n565\n00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:40.986\nThis is built in to that user's machine,\nand\n\n566\n00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:43.464\nit's something you can take\nadvantage of very easily.\n\n567\n00:28:43.464 --> 00:28:44.922\n>> All right well, Ronnie, I tell you.\n\n568\n00:28:44.922 --> 00:28:50.080\nThat's a lot of information about\nTask Manager and that Resource Monitor.\n\n569\n00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.520\nDid we miss anything, leave anything out?\n\n570\n00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.750\n>> Not really so far, right?\n\n571\n00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.590\nRemember that this is something\nthat you are gonna be called on to\n\n572\n00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.570\ndo as a technician at times, is to be\nable to actually understand some of these\n\n573\n00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.920\nmonitoring tools that we've\nbeen taking a look at.\n\n574\n00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.810\nThe Task Manager,\nrealize the control that you have there.\n\n575\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.800\nTake a look at the Performance, Resource\nMonitor, so that way you can actually\n\n576\n00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.280\ntell where you're actually\ngetting hit on your resources.\n\n577\n00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.820\nAnd actually be able to improve\nthe performance of your machine.\n\n578\n00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.400\nGreat tools built into Windows 7.\n\n579\n00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.120\n>> Alright,\nwe want to thank everybody for tuning in.\n\n580\n00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.660\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n581\n00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.995\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n582\n00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:30.450\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.640\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.360\nAnd with me today is Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.200\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.140\n>> I am doing fine today.\n\n7\n00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.350\nIt's another great day\nto be here in Florida.\n\n8\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.120\nAnd also another great day to be with you,\nas we take a look into Windows 7.\n\n9\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.350\nAnd specifically, talking about some\nof the different monitoring tools\n\n10\n00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.270\nthat we're actually\ntaking a look at today.\n\n11\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.130\nPerformance Monitor.\n\n12\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.570\n>> Performance Monitor it is.\n\n13\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.340\nOne of the big bad boys that we've got.\n\n14\n00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.780\nWe've taken a look at a couple of\ndifferent things, Task Manager,\n\n15\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.890\nthe Resource Monitor, and we've looked at\nthe Event Viewer, and now we're moving\n\n16\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.570\ninto the big boy on the block, and\nthat is gonna be performance monitor.\n\n17\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.813\nAnd performance monitor is really a\npowerful tool, Ronnie, and it has a bunch\n\n18\n00:00:49.813 --> 00:00:54.071\nof different options within it that\nallows to different types of monitoring.\n\n19\n00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:55.415\nWhen we talk about monitoring,\n\n20\n00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:58.616\nwe wanna make sure that we can classify\nthe type of monitoring we're doing.\n\n21\n00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:03.687\nAnd what I mean by that is, we can either\ndo what we call real time monitoring or\n\n22\n00:01:03.687 --> 00:01:06.772\nwe can do historical monitoring, right.\n\n23\n00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:11.700\nReal time monitoring means I'm seeing\nwhat's going on, on the system, right now.\n\n24\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.110\nRight, and\nI can't save any of the information.\n\n25\n00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.600\nIt scrolls off like Task Manager.\n\n26\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.150\nWe saw that we had those little,\ntiny graphs in there.\n\n27\n00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.530\nGood information, but as it scrolled off\nto the left, that information was lost.\n\n28\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.778\nWhen we looked at resource monitors,\nsame thing,\n\n29\n00:01:24.778 --> 00:01:27.320\nthat was another real\ntime monitoring solution.\n\n30\n00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.810\nShows me what's going on right now and\nif I'm looking at a machine that's\n\n31\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.890\nchugging along or applications are hanging\nup, that might be where I go to look.\n\n32\n00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.590\nA performance monitor does both, and\nthe first node we're going to focus on\n\n33\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.790\nis what's called performance monitor and\nthat's real time monitoring as well.\n\n34\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.890\nBut within there,\n\n35\n00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.580\nit also has something called historical\nmonitoring that we're gonna look at.\n\n36\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.304\nSo, first and foremost, I just wanna make\nsure we understand the difference between\n\n37\n00:01:52.304 --> 00:01:55.212\nwhat we call real time monitoring\nversus historical monitoring.\n\n38\n00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:58.696\n>> Whenever we start taking a look\ninto the real time monitoring,\n\n39\n00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:02.575\nwhat we're trying to do is figure out\nwhat is happening on that machine\n\n40\n00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:05.665\nright then to actually end up\nhurting the performance or\n\n41\n00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:09.439\nactually what's happening with\nthe performance on that machine.\n\n42\n00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:13.549\nAnd we're not really concerned about\nwhether or not that's actually gonna be\n\n43\n00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.070\nthere tomorrow or the next day or\nwhatever it's gonna be.\n\n44\n00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.950\nWe're actually right there trying to say,\nall right, something's happening, and\n\n45\n00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.200\nI need to actually be able to monitor,\nat least for now, and figure that out.\n\n46\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.410\nBut the problem that we have with that\nis simple, is that tomorrow at that same\n\n47\n00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.320\ntime, you can do the exact same monitoring\nand the results are going to be different.\n\n48\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.830\nYou can do it again on a third day and\nthe results could be different again, and\n\n49\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.960\nnow you actually have a problem.\n\n50\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.500\nYou have a problem of saying,\nyou know, I noticed,\n\n51\n00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.640\nMike, that there was a problem\non our network this week.\n\n52\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.060\nAnd Mike says, well, what do you mean?\n\n53\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.400\nAnd I go and\ntry to show it to him again and it's gone.\n\n54\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.420\nWell, that problem could've actually\njust been an intermittent problem.\n\n55\n00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.225\nIn other words, it was something\nthat was temporary, transitory.\n\n56\n00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:53.650\nIt happened and it was a glitch,\nand now it's done.\n\n57\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.860\nAnd now what I've done is I've\nalerted Mike, our technician.\n\n58\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.900\nAnd he's now monitoring for something\nthat could've just been a glitch.\n\n59\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.160\nTime after time again, and\nhe's like, I've monitored it for\n\n60\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.270\na week, I don't see anything going on.\n\n61\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.090\nAnd now my evaluation or my assessment,\nmy analysis of that situation would have\n\n62\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.480\nbeen totally wrong, except for\nthat one little period of time.\n\n63\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.560\nBut instead, if I can actually show him,\n\n64\n00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.570\nthat time after time, when that machine\nis running, whatever program is running,\n\n65\n00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.980\nwhatever's actually happening on\nthe network during that same time.\n\n66\n00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.440\nAnd now he actually sees that\nthere is something going on,\n\n67\n00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.920\nhe can now actually go back and go, all\nright, this is what I'm expecting to see.\n\n68\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.620\nAnd we apparently do have to actually\ntry and figure out what's going on here.\n\n69\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.370\nSo, it seems strange, but\nthe historical data actually provides for\n\n70\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.250\nus as technicians a lot\nmore valuable benefit\n\n71\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.620\nthan that real time monitoring\ndoes the majority of the time.\n\n72\n00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.330\n>> Absolutely, and\nit makes me think of an analogy.\n\n73\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.860\nAnd Ronnie, I know you'll like this one\nbecause you were a mechanic at one point.\n\n74\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.590\nYou know you take your car down\nto the mechanic and you say,\n\n75\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.950\nhey man every time I turn to the left it's\nmaking this noise, clunk clunk clunk.\n\n76\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.440\nThe mechanic gets in there drives\naround the block, nothing.\n\n77\n00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.900\nHe says I don't hear anything.\n\n78\n00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.317\nSo you get back in the car, halfway home,\nthere it goes again, you turn left and\n\n79\n00:04:04.317 --> 00:04:05.190\nclunk clunk clunk.\n\n80\n00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.680\nYou turn around, you go back to\nthe mechanic, you give it to him.\n\n81\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.890\nHe drives around and got nothing.\n\n82\n00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.630\nAnd those intermittent\nproblems can really be a pain\n\n83\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.940\nto try to troubleshoot because\nthey don't occur all the time.\n\n84\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.860\nI mean, you gotta figure out\nwhat it is that's causing it or\n\n85\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.870\ntriggering it or making it happen.\n\n86\n00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.470\nAll right, so\nlet's dive into performance monitoring.\n\n87\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.560\nI've got my Windows 7 box open here.\n\n88\n00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.000\nGonna go to my start menu.\n\n89\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.490\nI'm actually gonna type in perfmog,\nP-E-R-F-M.\n\n90\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.820\nAnd you can actually see it come up,\nas I go through there.\n\n91\n00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.150\nThere is my performance monitor.\n\n92\n00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.870\nI could also get through there\nthrough my administrative tools, or\n\n93\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.930\nthrough control panel as well.\n\n94\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.430\nAnd this is performance monitor.\n\n95\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.070\nAnd the first thing I'm gonna do, we're\ngonna just kind of work our way down.\n\n96\n00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.280\nAt the top I've got my monitoring tools,\nand\n\n97\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.640\nthen I've got this node\ncalled performance monitor.\n\n98\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.100\nThis is what I was talking about,\nthe real time monitoring.\n\n99\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.270\nThis is showing me what's going\non on the system right now.\n\n100\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.020\nWhen you open this up, by default,\n\n101\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.930\nyou'll get one counter in Windows 7 and\nthat is my percent processor time,\n\n102\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.350\nwhich is basically showing\nme how busy my processor is.\n\n103\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.880\nAnd this red bar is the activity,\nall right.\n\n104\n00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.370\nIt's showing me where it\nis in the graphing process.\n\n105\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.400\nThe red line is the activity.\n\n106\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.920\nThe red bar is gonna make it\nall the way to the end and\n\n107\n00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.390\nthen it's gonna cycle back around and\nstart over at the left,\n\n108\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.830\nand it's gonna wipe out the old data and\nreplace it with new data.\n\n109\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.970\nThat's what I mean by\nreal time monitoring.\n\n110\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.140\nI'm not saving any of this information,\nright.\n\n111\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.720\nNow, when we look at this, we say okay,\nI can monitor my percent processor time.\n\n112\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.140\nThat's not all I've got, right, Ronnie?\n\n113\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.610\nThere's a lot more to it.\n\n114\n00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.410\n>> There is insanely a lot more to this.\n\n115\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.106\nWhen we talk about a lot more,\nwe're not talking about 10 or 15.\n\n116\n00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:49.229\nWe're talking about hundreds\nof different monitors that\n\n117\n00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.592\nwe can actually have displayed.\n\n118\n00:05:51.592 --> 00:05:55.848\nAnd the reason why this is important is\nbecause, once again, the problem that we\n\n119\n00:05:55.848 --> 00:05:59.855\nhave is simply too much information is\nalmost worse than actually not enough\n\n120\n00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:03.924\ninformation because now you're actually\ngetting so much information there\n\n121\n00:06:03.924 --> 00:06:07.900\nthat it's almost impossible to\nfigure out which ones you want.\n\n122\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.942\nSo the good thing is you and\nI get to pick and choose.\n\n123\n00:06:09.942 --> 00:06:13.613\nAnd the easiest way to do so is on the top\nof that chart that you see right there,\n\n124\n00:06:13.613 --> 00:06:16.905\nnotice that there's a little green\nplus sign that you actually see.\n\n125\n00:06:16.905 --> 00:06:20.278\nAnd when you take a look at that\nlittle green plus sign right there,\n\n126\n00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:24.376\nyou'll actually notice that you can add\nin different counters, and remember,\n\n127\n00:06:24.376 --> 00:06:26.666\nwhen we're talking about performance, and\n\n128\n00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:29.396\nyou're trying to actually graph this or\nchart this.\n\n129\n00:06:29.396 --> 00:06:31.652\nYou're actually using what\nwe call counters here, and\n\n130\n00:06:31.652 --> 00:06:34.868\nthe counters that you see in front you,\nand you actually see that, by default,\n\n131\n00:06:34.868 --> 00:06:37.160\nbecause it's the one that's on the screen.\n\n132\n00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.050\nIt says processor.\n\n133\n00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.350\nYou might go, oh, look,\nthat's the only one that you have.\n\n134\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.710\nBut, Mike, I notice that there's a little\ndrop down arrow on the right-hand side,\n\n135\n00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.600\nand you click on that.\n\n136\n00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.550\nNow, all of a sudden, Mike, all of those\nhighlighted features are actually the ones\n\n137\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.980\ndealing with just the processor, and\nyou might think that that's enough.\n\n138\n00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.810\nBut all of those other ones that have the\ndrop down, they may have equaled that or\n\n139\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.570\neven more little piece of information\nthat you can really zoom in on.\n\n140\n00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.720\n>> It's almost overwhelming\nwhen you come in here and look.\n\n141\n00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.550\nBecause as Ronnie said, each one of these\nis actually a category of counters.\n\n142\n00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.342\nBecause there are hundreds and hundreds\nof counters, to make it easier for\n\n143\n00:07:09.342 --> 00:07:11.883\nus to find the one we're looking for,\nthey've categorized them.\n\n144\n00:07:11.883 --> 00:07:16.683\nSo if I go to that process or category,\nand expand it out, I can see that there\n\n145\n00:07:16.683 --> 00:07:21.345\nare a whole bunch of counters underneath\nthere that deal with processor.\n\n146\n00:07:21.345 --> 00:07:24.450\nAnd if I want to add one of these,\nI simply select it and\n\n147\n00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.831\nthen I can and let's do,\nI don't know percent user time.\n\n148\n00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:32.368\nI can select that and I can click Add,\nthat's going to add that\n\n149\n00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:37.269\ncounter over to the side,\nwhich is going to then add it to my graph.\n\n150\n00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:40.965\nOne thing I want to point out while we're\nhere as you're adding these different\n\n151\n00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:44.344\ncounters, like I said, there\nare literally hundreds of these things.\n\n152\n00:07:44.344 --> 00:07:50.250\nWhen you go to add them, let's say I\nwant to do percent interrupt time.\n\n153\n00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:55.752\nDown below there, you're going to see\ninstances of selected objects, right.\n\n154\n00:07:55.752 --> 00:07:58.748\nWhat that allows me to do,\nlike processor for example,\n\n155\n00:07:58.748 --> 00:08:01.440\nI might have more than one\nprocessor in my system.\n\n156\n00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.889\nIf I leave this on total, then it's just\ngonna take the performance information for\n\n157\n00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:10.970\nall the processors,\nadd it all up, and show me that.\n\n158\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.273\nIf I choose all instances,\nif I had four processors in this system.\n\n159\n00:08:15.273 --> 00:08:17.443\nIt would show me,\ninstead of adding them all together,\n\n160\n00:08:17.443 --> 00:08:20.640\nit would still add all four processors,\nbut it would do it individually.\n\n161\n00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.660\nSo I could see what processor 1 was doing\ncompared to processor 2 to processor 3 to\n\n162\n00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.040\nprocessor 4, or each instance\nwill be listed here individually.\n\n163\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.025\nI can see I only have one processor\nin this system, so I see instant 0.\n\n164\n00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:38.525\nIt's going to start with the 00123 for\nmy four processors.\n\n165\n00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:41.835\nI could just want to monitor\na particular processor, and\n\n166\n00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:45.095\nI can pick that individual processor and\nadd it as well.\n\n167\n00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:46.320\nSo I can do it total.\n\n168\n00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.570\nI can do all instances added at once,\nor I can add individual instances.\n\n169\n00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.970\nAnother really cool thing about\nthis add counters dialog box\n\n170\n00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.660\nis this little show description down here.\n\n171\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.506\nA lot of these I might have any idea\nwhat the heck they actually mean,\n\n172\n00:09:02.506 --> 00:09:03.960\nwhat is % C1 Time?\n\n173\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.690\nI don't know.\n\n174\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.320\nBut if I come down here and show\ndescription, I can see oh, % C1 Time is\n\n175\n00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.860\nthe percentage of the time the processor\nspends in the C1 low power idle state.\n\n176\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.910\nNow that makes sense.\n\n177\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.630\nRight?\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n178\n00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.150\n>> Not really.\n\n179\n00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.090\n>> I'm glad it makes sense to you!\n\n180\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.695\nI was going to say wow, that's cool.\n\n181\n00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:21.130\n[LAUGHTER]\n>> You have your different power states\n\n182\n00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.690\nand your processor goes in hibernation\nsleep stance, that kind of thing.\n\n183\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.679\n>> But those descriptions are fantastic\nbecause this is one of those tools\n\n184\n00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:34.280\nwhere it's gonna take some time for you to\nget used to all the different counters.\n\n185\n00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.833\nWhat you really want to monitor,\n\n186\n00:09:35.833 --> 00:09:38.820\nwhat the numbers actually\nmean when you get them back.\n\n187\n00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.090\nLike for example,\nlet's go down to physical disks here.\n\n188\n00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.090\nAll right?\n\n189\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:50.440\nAnd underneath physical disk, know if I\ncan find it, there we go, physical disk,\n\n190\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:56.310\nI've got one known as,\nwhere is it, disk queue length.\n\n191\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.640\nThat I can find it,\naverage disk queue length, There we go.\n\n192\n00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.230\nAll right?\n\n193\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.970\nAnd again, if I had more than one drive,\nI could do each one individually, or\n\n194\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.290\na total, Well what the heck is that?\n\n195\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.110\nOh that's the average number of both read\nand write requests that are queued for\n\n196\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.380\nselected disk during the sample\ninterval.I can add that all right?\n\n197\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.910\nNow, what the numbers\nmean,that's another story right?\n\n198\n00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.960\nIf I tell you,\nwell let's go ahead and do this.\n\n199\n00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.990\nI'll say average length.\n\n200\n00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.010\nI'll click okay.\n\n201\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.180\nNow I can see the individual\ncounters down here have been added.\n\n202\n00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.280\nI've got my average disk\nqueue length added.\n\n203\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.100\nAnd which one is that?\n\n204\n00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.723\nThat's another one of\nthose red lines there.\n\n205\n00:10:35.723 --> 00:10:36.300\n>> [LAUGH] Yes it is.\n\n206\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.520\n>> It looks like it's buried along\nthe bottom, but what if it's five?\n\n207\n00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.320\nWhat if it's eight?\n\n208\n00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.380\nWhat if it's three?\n\n209\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.500\nWhat does that mean to me?\n\n210\n00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.680\nWell, the disk queue length is there's\na formula that we're supposed to use for\n\n211\n00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.580\nthat particular one.\n\n212\n00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.560\nIt's the number spindles plus two.\n\n213\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.865\nSo, if I have three spindles in a rate\narray that would be three plus two\n\n214\n00:10:53.865 --> 00:10:55.950\nwill give me five, or something like that.\n\n215\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.680\nSo anyway, the point is\n\n216\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.650\nit might take you some time to figure\nout what the numbers actually mean.\n\n217\n00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.310\nYou can record the average SQ length and\n\n218\n00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.800\nit might tell you that it's three,\nbut is that good or is that bad?\n\n219\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.580\nIs it something you need to worry about?\n\n220\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.150\nSo this tool does take\na little bit of research and\n\n221\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.280\na little bit of experience to\nget the most benefit out of it.\n\n222\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.990\nNow, once we've added the counters that we\nwanna watch, we simply look at our graphs.\n\n223\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.500\nHere we can see\nthe information going across.\n\n224\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.800\nYou can see that red lines\ngetting ready to get to the end.\n\n225\n00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.270\nIt's gonna start all over.\n\n226\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.500\nAnd start back from the beginning.\n\n227\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.480\nIt's gonna wipe out the old data and\nreplace it with the new data.\n\n228\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.010\nSometimes if I've added too many counters,\nif I need to monitor a lot of things, or\n\n229\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.960\nif one of the counters is bottoming out\nat zero, or maxing out at 100 up here.\n\n230\n00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.260\nOr if I just have a lot\nof counters out there,\n\n231\n00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.560\nit can be difficult to see\nthe one I'm interested in.\n\n232\n00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.520\nThat's when this little\nhighlighter comes in handy.\n\n233\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.230\nIf I depress that button,\nIf I can get my computer to single click.\n\n234\n00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.930\nIt's in a double click mood today.\n\n235\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.370\nNow you can see that\nbutton stays depressed and\n\n236\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.950\nnot talking about it needing drugs,\nit's actually pushed in.\n\n237\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.430\nAnd now that counter is highlighted.\n\n238\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:06.570\nWhichever one I select down here,\nIt is going to be highlighted.\n\n239\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.850\nAnd yes it keeps double clicking on me.\n\n240\n00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.620\nSo as I click on the different one, it's\ngonna highlight that particular counter.\n\n241\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.830\nIt makes it very easy to see.\n\n242\n00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.540\nLike that average disk queue\nlength is actually running\n\n243\n00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.060\nright along the bottom there.\n\n244\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.110\nI might not even seen,\n\n245\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.810\nI thought there was a problem or not been\nable to interpret the data correctly.\n\n246\n00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.260\nThe highlighter allows me to do that.\n\n247\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.870\nI also have different views up\nhere that I can choose from.\n\n248\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.790\nThis is the line view that I'm looking at,\nI can do a histogram bar,\n\n249\n00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.100\nwhich is kinda like a moving bar chart.\n\n250\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.040\nAnd we can also change the view.\n\n251\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.150\nIf I go up to this little drop down list,\nI'll see that I've got the line view,\n\n252\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.560\nwhich is the default view.\n\n253\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.960\nI have the histogram bar,\nwhich is like a moving bar chart.\n\n254\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.660\nAnd then I also have the report view\nwhich just shows me the numbers; and\n\n255\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.440\nsometimes that can be really handy\nespecially if I've got a lot of counters.\n\n256\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.600\nIf I want to try to see what\nthe actual number is and\n\n257\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.010\nnot just a pretty representation of it.\n\n258\n00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.660\nSo a lot of really cool options that we\ncan do within the performance monitor.\n\n259\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.540\nThe big thing is that this\nis real time information.\n\n260\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.180\nI can't save the information,\n\n261\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.150\nit will go away as that bar\nscrolls across the side there.\n\n262\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.350\n>> You know, once we have that ability to\nsee the information that we're looking at,\n\n263\n00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.790\neven in real time.\n\n264\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.870\nRemember that that's really not\ngoing to be helpful if you're\n\n265\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.340\ntrying to troubleshoot a ton of different\nproblems over a period of time.\n\n266\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.000\nSo instead, with the performance monitor\ncomes with the ability to create what\n\n267\n00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.390\nMicrosoft likes to call\na data collector set.\n\n268\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.170\nAnd that gives us the ability to\nhistorically take that data and\n\n269\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.555\nsave it, and then we can actually.\n\n270\n00:13:40.555 --> 00:13:44.065\nDo the same thing again on another day or\neven another period of time, and\n\n271\n00:13:44.065 --> 00:13:45.425\nthen compare the two.\n\n272\n00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:45.925\n>> Exactly.\n\n273\n00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:49.485\nNow let's take a minute and\ngo over some terminology real quick.\n\n274\n00:13:49.485 --> 00:13:53.550\nWhen we talk about performance, usually\nwhen we look at troubleshooting computers.\n\n275\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.120\nWe're talking about performance and\nwe're talking about reliability.\n\n276\n00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.570\nAnd, some people would try to use\nthese terms interchangeably and\n\n277\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.120\nthey don't mean the same thing.\n\n278\n00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.900\nPerformance is a perception thing,\nhow fast does it seem to be working.\n\n279\n00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.680\nWhen I click on Excel,\nhow long does it take to open.\n\n280\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.960\nWhen I go to log in, how long does\nit take me to get to my desktop?\n\n281\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.310\nThat's a performance concept,\nand it's very relative.\n\n282\n00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.480\nI could take a laptop and pass it around\nto all of you that are watching this show,\n\n283\n00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.790\nand Ronnie and I here.\n\n284\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.266\nSome of you might say,\n\n285\n00:14:23.266 --> 00:14:27.474\nthis laptop is Is smoking fast\nbecause compared to your laptop.\n\n286\n00:14:27.474 --> 00:14:28.914\nYou know it is or you know,\n\n287\n00:14:28.914 --> 00:14:33.640\nRonnie says over this thing is slow as\nheck because compared to his super cray.\n\n288\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.440\nThe laptop is slower than\nwhat he is used to using.\n\n289\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.060\nThe laptop didn't change, the performance\non that machine didn't change.\n\n290\n00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.000\nIt was the perception that changed.\n\n291\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.210\nWhatever you were comparing it to.\n\n292\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:49.820\nSo, you can't measure performance once and\nget an accurate representation,\n\n293\n00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.860\nbecause you have to have\nsomething to compare it to.\n\n294\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.420\nAnd that's where the data\ncollector sets come in.\n\n295\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.370\nAnd let me back up.\n\n296\n00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.755\nReliability has nothing\nto do with performance.\n\n297\n00:14:58.755 --> 00:15:01.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Reliability is how it conforms to\n\n298\n00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.930\nexpected behavior.\n\n299\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.020\nIf my operating system crashes,\nthat's not what I expect.\n\n300\n00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.420\nThat's a reliability issue.\n\n301\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.840\nIf an application hangs up,\nthat's not what I expect it to do.\n\n302\n00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.790\nThat's a reliability issue.\n\n303\n00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.090\nI can have a very fast machine\nthat crashes all the time.\n\n304\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.840\nThat means I've got great performance But\nreally poor reliability.\n\n305\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.610\nI can have a machine that never crashes,\nbut it's slow like a turtle.\n\n306\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.470\nThat means I've got poor performance,\nbut great reliability.\n\n307\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.480\nSo they are completely separate.\n\n308\n00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.860\nAnd then with the performance, you've\ngot to have something to compare it to,\n\n309\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.790\nand as Ronnie said, That's where\nthe data collector sets come in.\n\n310\n00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.940\nThey let us create something\ncalled a baseline, right?\n\n311\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.880\nEarly on in a machine's lifetime or\nwhenever you can.\n\n312\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.460\nWe want to go and\nget performance information.\n\n313\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.040\nWe add our counters to this data\ncollectors set which I'm going to show you\n\n314\n00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.800\nin a second and we capture.\n\n315\n00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.330\nRemember performance monitor real time.\n\n316\n00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.684\nData collector sets capture and\nsave the information.\n\n317\n00:15:56.684 --> 00:16:01.035\nNow I can capture that information,\nhow that machine is performing And\n\n318\n00:16:01.035 --> 00:16:02.350\nI could set it aside.\n\n319\n00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.990\nNext week I can capture it again, and\nnow I've got something to compare it to.\n\n320\n00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.990\nWhen that user comes to me and says,\nmy machine is running really slow.\n\n321\n00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.270\nI can capture the same performance\ninformation, the same counters again.\n\n322\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.040\nAnd I can compare it to\nwhat I got a month ago, and\n\n323\n00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.180\nnow I can accurately tell the user,\nyou're right.\n\n324\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.440\nSince we've added those new applications,\nyour performance has dropped.\n\n325\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.610\nOr, no, it's performing exactly\nthe same as it was a month ago.\n\n326\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.619\nSo, it's all in your head.\n\n327\n00:16:29.619 --> 00:16:31.198\nWell, I wouldn't tell the end user that,\nbut.\n\n328\n00:16:31.198 --> 00:16:32.619\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the thing.\n\n329\n00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:35.435\nBut if I didn't have that\nbaseline to compare it to,\n\n330\n00:16:35.435 --> 00:16:39.150\nI wouldn't be able to accurately\nportray or give that information.\n\n331\n00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.230\nSo, it gives us something\nto compare back to, right?\n\n332\n00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.000\n>> It really does, and\nthis is a nice, cool feature.\n\n333\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.700\nBecause normally what you'd have to do is,\nyou probably have to go and\n\n334\n00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.950\nfind a third party utility to help\nyou to be able to do this, and\n\n335\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.390\nthat should make sure it\ngets turned on on time and\n\n336\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.320\nto make sure that everything is actually\nrunning the way that you want to.\n\n337\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.210\nBut here's the write-in to Windows 7, this\nhas actually been there for, I think Vista\n\n338\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.280\neven had it, but Windows 7 here really\ndoes take advantage of it as well.\n\n339\n00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.920\nAnd the nice thing that we\nalso have aside of Windows 7,\n\n340\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.710\nis that it also has some\npre-built templates,\n\n341\n00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.890\nif we choose to use that, that really do\nhelp us to focus in on performance, too.\n\n342\n00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:15.480\n>> Absolutely.\n\n343\n00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.440\nSo let's take a peak here.\n\n344\n00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.490\nSo I've got my performance monitor\nopened up because that's where my data\n\n345\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:20.320\ncollector sets are.\n\n346\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.020\nThey're in the same tool.\n\n347\n00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.390\nHere's my data collector sets.\n\n348\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.400\nI've got user defined.\n\n349\n00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.480\nAnd it's kinda funny that there actually\nis, that's one I created earlier.\n\n350\n00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.990\nAnd then underneath System, as Ronnie\nsaid, there's those two templates.\n\n351\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:38.260\nNow, I'm not a huge fan of these\ntemplates because they add dozens and\n\n352\n00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.740\ndozens of counters.\n\n353\n00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.370\nIt's almost too much information.\n\n354\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.340\nI would rather do it myself,\nand pick the counters I want.\n\n355\n00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.190\nBut they are a great starting point if you\ndon't know exactly what you wanna get, or\n\n356\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:51.680\nif you just need something really quick,\nthose are great to use.\n\n357\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.850\nLet's see how we go and\ncreate a data collector's set.\n\n358\n00:17:54.850 --> 00:18:00.197\nI'm gonna right click on User Define and\nchoose New Data\n\n359\n00:18:00.197 --> 00:18:05.552\ncollector set and\nI might call this one Mike's laptop.\n\n360\n00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:07.515\nIf I could spell laptop\nwithout a colon there.\n\n361\n00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.145\nAll right.\nAnd I still can't spell.\n\n362\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.690\nNot that it matters.\n\n363\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.110\nThere's my laptop.\n\n364\n00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.390\nI could do it from a template, which they\nrecommend, I don't know what you have, and\n\n365\n00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.470\nthat just makes it easy.\n\n366\n00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.760\nLike I said there's two templates\nthat you can pick from.\n\n367\n00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.900\nOr I can create it manually,\nwhich is what I'm gonna do.\n\n368\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.240\nI'll click next, and then I'm gonna\nchoose to do a performance counter, and\n\n369\n00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.572\nI'm gonna click next.\n\n370\n00:18:34.148 --> 00:18:35.570\nAnd by double clicking\nit's getting me here.\n\n371\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.300\nAnd then I've gotta add my counter.\n\n372\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.180\nWhat is it I wanna capture\ninformation about?\n\n373\n00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.951\nSo I'll click add.\n\n374\n00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.759\nAnd something I didn't mention earlier,\n\n375\n00:18:44.759 --> 00:18:47.320\nyou can use this console to\nmonitor systems remotely.\n\n376\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.760\nNotice at the top, it says Local Computer.\n\n377\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.040\nSometimes you might\nwanna monitor remotely,\n\n378\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.470\nespecially if I'm doing a lot of counters.\n\n379\n00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.290\nAnd I get to tell it how often to monitor.\n\n380\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.250\nAnd a lot of times,\nwe'll drop it down to one second.\n\n381\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.990\nSo every one second, record what\nthat percent processor time is.\n\n382\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.960\nEvery one second record what my\naverage disk queue length is.\n\n383\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.030\nIt's gotta write all of that\nto the hard drive, right?\n\n384\n00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.970\nWhich can affect my\nhard drive performance.\n\n385\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.430\nSo the numbers I'm seeing might\nactually be me monitoring and\n\n386\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.640\nnot the system, right?\n\n387\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.250\nMaking that busy.\n\n388\n00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.350\nSometimes it might be\nbetter to monitor remotely.\n\n389\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.890\nNow, I'm gonna add the big four here.\n\n390\n00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:25.870\nRonnie mentioned the big four subsystems,\nprocessor, disk, memory and network.\n\n391\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.754\nThere are a few counters that\nwe almost always monitor.\n\n392\n00:19:28.754 --> 00:19:32.748\nOne of them is gonna be percent\nprocessor time for my processor.\n\n393\n00:19:32.748 --> 00:19:34.160\nAll right.\n\n394\n00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.840\nThe other one that I'm gonna do is my\nphysical disk average disk queue length.\n\n395\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.100\nIt's another important one for\nperformance, gives you an idea\n\n396\n00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:48.800\nof how many things are waiting for\ntime with the hard drive.\n\n397\n00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.280\nWell I can find it again,\naverage disk queue length, and\n\n398\n00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.015\nit's double clicking on me, that's why\nit's saying that counter's already added,\n\n399\n00:19:57.015 --> 00:20:00.160\ncuz every time I select something\nit's selecting it twice,\n\n400\n00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.390\nI'm gonna throw this mouse through\nthe wall here in just a minute,\n\n401\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.480\nwe'll take care of that later though.\n\n402\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:10.050\nAll right, so I've got my two counters\nthere for physical disk and processor.\n\n403\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.430\nThe other big subsystem is memory,\n\n404\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:18.010\nand these are alphabetical, Mike, so you\nshould be able to find it pretty easily.\n\n405\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.020\nAnd a lot of times what we're looking for\non memory for\n\n406\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.706\na basic counter, you can add any of them,\npages per second.\n\n407\n00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:29.220\nAll right, so I'll put that out there,\nand what do I got left?\n\n408\n00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.149\nNetwork is the other main subsystem,\nand for network.\n\n409\n00:20:36.748 --> 00:20:42.370\nWe'll do network interface and I might\ndo something like bytes throughput or\n\n410\n00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:47.010\nbytes total per second as\ntypically a good one to monitor.\n\n411\n00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:50.680\nAgain, those are usually what we\ncall the big four that we monitor.\n\n412\n00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.660\nAnd then,\nyou're gonna add additional counters for\n\n413\n00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.180\nspecific problems or troubleshooting or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n414\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.065\nOnce I get all the counters added,\nI click OK.\n\n415\n00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.040\nAll right, and here's where I was\ntalking about that sample interval.\n\n416\n00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.300\nI'm gonna drop that to every one\nsecond and I'm gonna click next.\n\n417\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.680\nI'm gonna give it a place to store this.\n\n418\n00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.700\nClick next and then if I needed\nto use alternate credentials,\n\n419\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.950\nI'm logged on as an administrator so\nit won't be a problem.\n\n420\n00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.991\nBut if you wanted somebody else to be\nable to start this data collector set,\n\n421\n00:21:21.991 --> 00:21:24.083\nmaybe you need to store\nsome credentials in there.\n\n422\n00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:28.750\nI click Finish and\nnow I've got this new data collector set.\n\n423\n00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.280\nAll right?\n\n424\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.140\nIt's not running.\n\n425\n00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.120\nIt's not capturing information yet.\n\n426\n00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.150\nWhen I'm ready to start it, I'm just\ngonna right click on it and choose Start.\n\n427\n00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.490\nI do wanna show you one\nother thing though.\n\n428\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.990\nIf you need to modify this,\nI've got two things.\n\n429\n00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.030\nI've got the data collector set over here,\nMike's laptop,\n\n430\n00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.908\nand I've got this data collector\n01 out here in the details area.\n\n431\n00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:54.070\nIf I right-click on Mike's laptop and\nchoose Properties, you'll see I'm getting\n\n432\n00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:59.020\ninformation more about the collector set\nitself like the name, the description,\n\n433\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.970\nwho is running it, where's it storing it,\nI can control permissions, and\n\n434\n00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.360\nI can do schedules.\n\n435\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.440\nAnd a schedule is a very\nimportant part of it.\n\n436\n00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.630\nWe're gonna run it manually here,\nbut In the real world,\n\n437\n00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:15.240\nI wanna create that baseline, and\nI can't monitor it for two minutes and\n\n438\n00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.600\nshut it down, and go, okay, there we go.\n\n439\n00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.700\nThere's my performance for that machine.\n\n440\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.990\nI need it over a period of time.\n\n441\n00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.200\nI need it under a normal\nworkload environment.\n\n442\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.320\nRight, Ronnie?\n>> Right.\n\n443\n00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.290\nWhen you take a look at that normal\nworkload environment, that is the key.\n\n444\n00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:32.270\nIf Mike were to set this up going,\nI want a monitor the performance\n\n445\n00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.520\non that machine but, it's during\nthe regular work day or before the regular\n\n446\n00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.300\nwork day I should begin I should say, or\neven after hours, well, he might actually\n\n447\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.310\nget incredible network performance\nwhen nobody else is on the network.\n\n448\n00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.380\nWell, that's kind of skewing the results.\n\n449\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.080\nWhat we want, of course, especially if\nyou're actually dealing with a network\n\n450\n00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.400\nmachine, or a server,\nor something like that,\n\n451\n00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.685\nyou wanna actually have it when everyone's\nactually doing their normal work.\n\n452\n00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:57.570\nIn that way you can compare that, everyday\nfor a week or every other day for a week.\n\n453\n00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.320\nWhatever you want to be able to do.\n\n454\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.920\nAnd that way you actually\nget a true representation\n\n455\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.340\nof what the real performance of\nthat machine is going to be like.\n\n456\n00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.300\nThat's where we end up\nskewing it ourselves and\n\n457\n00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.050\nnot realizing,\nI'm gonna run it after work.\n\n458\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.890\nThat does give you a nice\nperformance monitor?\n\n459\n00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.000\nWhen nobody else is\nactually doing anything and\n\n460\n00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:15.930\nthat's where the problem comes in.\n\n461\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.620\nSo regular network performance,\nregular work everything.\n\n462\n00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.510\nSo you might actually have this running in\nthe background for a user and just say,\n\n463\n00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.317\njust use it today, and\n\n464\n00:23:23.317 --> 00:23:25.593\nit's gonna actually gonna take\nthe picture of it as you use it.\n\n465\n00:23:25.593 --> 00:23:29.011\nAnd then we're gonna actually do this\nthing tomorrow and the following day and\n\n466\n00:23:29.011 --> 00:23:30.460\nthen you can compare all three and\n\n467\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.870\njust make sure that they're\nnot treating it special.\n\n468\n00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.830\nMake sure they're doing just\nwhat they would normally do.\n\n469\n00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:35.330\n>> Exactly.\n\n470\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.300\nSo underneath that real\nworkload that is the key.\n\n471\n00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.675\nSo you would click Add.\n\n472\n00:23:39.675 --> 00:23:42.564\nAnd I might say beginning date is 6/25.\n\n473\n00:23:42.564 --> 00:23:47.319\nAnd I wanna launch this up at say 8 AM,\nMonday through Friday,\n\n474\n00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:52.616\nwe'll exclude Saturday and Sunday,\nand I'll click OK and then maybe\n\n475\n00:23:52.616 --> 00:23:58.306\nI wanna launch it again at around 1\no'clock in the afternoon, all right?\n\n476\n00:23:58.306 --> 00:24:00.722\nBecause that's another busy time.\n\n477\n00:24:00.722 --> 00:24:05.220\nOn my network and do Monday through\nFriday, exclude Saturday and Sunday there.\n\n478\n00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.190\nPerformance in the morning might\nbe different from the afternoon.\n\n479\n00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.440\nWorkload that the server's under or\nthat client enters is gonna be different.\n\n480\n00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.890\nMonday's gonna be different from Tuesday's\ngonna be different from Wednesday, right?\n\n481\n00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.350\nPeople skip out on Fridays.\n\n482\n00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:21.070\nSo if I just measure it Friday afternoon,\nit might look really good.\n\n483\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.980\nAnd as Ronnie said, if I'm the only\ngeek on the network at midnight and\n\n484\n00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.380\nI'm monitoring performance.\n\n485\n00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.760\nServer's gonna look like it's doing well.\n\n486\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.195\nThat client's gonna look really good.\n\n487\n00:24:28.195 --> 00:24:30.053\nNot an accurate representation.\n\n488\n00:24:30.053 --> 00:24:31.574\nNow that tell it when to start.\n\n489\n00:24:31.574 --> 00:24:33.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It doesn't say anything about when it's\n\n490\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:33.954\ngonna stop, right?\n\n491\n00:24:33.954 --> 00:24:37.157\nSo we've gotta make sure we\nput a stop condition as well,\n\n492\n00:24:37.157 --> 00:24:39.510\nand a lot of times we do overall duration.\n\n493\n00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.500\nAnd I might say after one hour.\n\n494\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.960\nSo what it's gonna do,\nit's gonna kick off at 8 AM, and\n\n495\n00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.385\nit's gonna capture information for\none hour and stop.\n\n496\n00:24:46.385 --> 00:24:50.565\nThen it's going to kick on again at 1:00\nin the afternoon, capture information for\n\n497\n00:24:50.565 --> 00:24:52.439\nan hour, and then it's going to stop.\n\n498\n00:24:52.439 --> 00:24:54.893\nAnd then it's going to rinse and\nrepeat on Tuesday and Wednesday and\n\n499\n00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.540\nThursday and Friday.\n\n500\n00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.870\nOr I might say to reset it or\nrestart it or maximum\n\n501\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:06.520\nsize might be another one you want to do\njust in case that log file is too big.\n\n502\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.309\nSo once I've got everything set there,\n\n503\n00:25:08.309 --> 00:25:11.000\nnotice no where in there did I\nsee the counters that I picked.\n\n504\n00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.519\nWhat if I want to add another counter?\n\n505\n00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:14.375\nWhat if I want to remove\none of those counters?\n\n506\n00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:17.870\nThat's when I have to go back in and\nright click on data collection 01.\n\n507\n00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.840\nI have to select the data collector\nset over here on the left,\n\n508\n00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.180\nright click on data collector 01 in the\ndetails area and pull up those properties.\n\n509\n00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:30.880\nThere's the counters as well as that\nsample interval if I wanted to change\n\n510\n00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.870\nthat I'd have to pull up these properties,\nso just something you need to be aware of.\n\n511\n00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.030\nWhere do I need to go to schedule it?\n\n512\n00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.270\nBecause you're not going\nto be there to start it.\n\n513\n00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.730\nYou're not going to remember to start it\nthe same time everyday, things like that.\n\n514\n00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.470\nSo we want to schedule it, that's the\nproperties of the actual collector's set.\n\n515\n00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.750\nYou might wanna change what counters or\nwhat interval.\n\n516\n00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.809\nThat's the properties\nof the DataCollector01.\n\n517\n00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:53.956\nSo once I'm ready,\nit's gonna start tomorrow at 8 AM.\n\n518\n00:25:53.956 --> 00:25:55.448\nI'm gonna go ahead and start it manually,\n\n519\n00:25:55.448 --> 00:25:58.112\nsince we don't feel like sitting here\nuntil 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n\n520\n00:25:58.112 --> 00:26:02.622\nI'll go ahead and click Start, and then\nI'm just gonna click on a couple things\n\n521\n00:26:02.622 --> 00:26:04.995\njust to make my machine a little bit busy.\n\n522\n00:26:04.995 --> 00:26:07.600\nIt's sampling every, what'd we say?\n\n523\n00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.960\nOne second.\n\n524\n00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.240\nI'm just gonna open up a few things.\n\n525\n00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.810\nMake it do a few things.\n\n526\n00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.520\nMaybe open up some Internet Explorer.\n\n527\n00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.290\nThat'll suck up some resources.\n\n528\n00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:16.840\nIt's Windows.\n\n529\n00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.160\nAll I have to do is\nclick on the Start menu.\n\n530\n00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.490\nIt's gonna suck up some resources.\n\n531\n00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.510\nAlright.\n\n532\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.210\nSo, we'll make it a really\nsmall data collector set.\n\n533\n00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.420\nI'll close some of these windows here.\n\n534\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.350\nAnd then I'm gonna stop it manually.\n\n535\n00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:32.420\nAgain, my counter or my properties\nwould say hey, stop it after an hour.\n\n536\n00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.460\nI'm gonna go ahead and stop it.\n\n537\n00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.610\nOnce it's been stopped,\nremember where we said to store it.\n\n538\n00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:42.105\nIt's gonna go in that perf logs folder\non my C drive, so if I come in here to\n\n539\n00:26:42.105 --> 00:26:47.310\nC, and I'm going to have a folder called\nperflog, that's what it does by default.\n\n540\n00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:51.460\nIn there I've got Admin,\nin there I've got that Mike's Laptop,\n\n541\n00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:57.490\nin there I've got the date and time stamp,\nand an incremental number because it\n\n542\n00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:02.080\ncould be due at 8 AM and 1 o'clock so\nthen I see zero, zero, zero, zero, two.\n\n543\n00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:08.110\nAnd for tomorrow, 06:2600001 or whatever\nand then in there is my actual set.\n\n544\n00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.512\nNow the interesting thing is there\nare a couple of ways you can open this up.\n\n545\n00:27:11.512 --> 00:27:12.173\nRight, Ronnie?\n\n546\n00:27:12.173 --> 00:27:13.392\n>> There really are.\n\n547\n00:27:13.392 --> 00:27:16.997\nThe way that Mike showed you of course is\nwhere it's going to be located on the disk\n\n548\n00:27:16.997 --> 00:27:20.444\nitself, but inside of the performance\nmonitor you have that little node over\n\n549\n00:27:20.444 --> 00:27:22.700\nthere on the left hand\nside called Reports.\n\n550\n00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.466\nAnd you expand that out and\nthen you go into User Defined and\n\n551\n00:27:25.466 --> 00:27:27.627\nnow you actually do have\nboth of those there.\n\n552\n00:27:27.627 --> 00:27:30.515\nThere's Mike's laptop and\nwhen you actually launch it here,\n\n553\n00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:33.853\nit actually does put in a nice little\ngraphical representation for you.\n\n554\n00:27:33.853 --> 00:27:34.629\n>> It is, it's beautiful.\n\n555\n00:27:34.629 --> 00:27:38.536\nNow a lot of the books I've read\nabout Windows and some of that,\n\n556\n00:27:38.536 --> 00:27:42.294\nthey tell you to come over here and\nwhat was it, file, open,\n\n557\n00:27:42.294 --> 00:27:47.560\nor somewhere up here you can actually\nopen the, where was that at, Ronnie?\n\n558\n00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.860\nPerformance monitor, I've actually forgot.\n\n559\n00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:57.090\nI never do it this way, and I have\nforgotten how to, oh I know where it is.\n\n560\n00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.100\nNever mind.\nRight here, view log data.\n\n561\n00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.960\nSo if you go to your performance monitor,\nyour real-time monitoring,\n\n562\n00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.650\nthere's a little button here\nthat says view log data.\n\n563\n00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.800\nI can click on that and\nI can go to my source.\n\n564\n00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.230\nAnd instead of current activity,\nwhich is what it's doing now.\n\n565\n00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.590\nI can do log file, I can click add.\n\n566\n00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:20.680\nAnd I can browse into perflogs admin,\nMike's laptop and enter the date and time.\n\n567\n00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.650\nAnd there it is.\n\n568\n00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.260\nI can click open.\n\n569\n00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:27.650\nAnd then I click okay, and\nit shows me that information right here.\n\n570\n00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.640\nWell, wait, Mike, you added more counters\nthan just the average disc queue length.\n\n571\n00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.250\nWhere is the rest of the counters?\n\n572\n00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.550\nThat's what bugs me about\ndoing it this particular way.\n\n573\n00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:42.830\nIf I go back in there, and take a look at\nthat, we'll do view log data again, and\n\n574\n00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.970\nI picked the log file, but what I didn't\ndo was go over here to the Data tab.\n\n575\n00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.350\nAnd you'll see there's\nonly one counter there.\n\n576\n00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.480\nI know there's four counters in there.\n\n577\n00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.040\nSo if I click Add, instead of seeing the\nhundreds of counters that are available,\n\n578\n00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.580\nI only see the four counters that\nare recorded in that particular log, so\n\n579\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.800\nI can add them here.\n\n580\n00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.575\nTo me, that's just crazy.\n\n581\n00:29:05.575 --> 00:29:08.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's four, well when I open it up,\n\n582\n00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.310\nwhy does it not show me all\nthe counters that I've already added?\n\n583\n00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.100\nAnd the answer is because you might\nhave collected hundreds of counters,\n\n584\n00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.510\nand maybe this moment,\nyou only wanna see four of them.\n\n585\n00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.990\nSo it's giving you the opportunity\nto slim that down a little bit.\n\n586\n00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:27.550\nSo you can see just the counters\nthat you want to see.\n\n587\n00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.300\nIf you go to the report as Ronnie did,\n\n588\n00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.450\nwhich is my favorite way of doing it,\nyou see all the counters.\n\n589\n00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:36.760\nThere is no you have to go and pick\nagain the counters that you want to see.\n\n590\n00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.420\nOne other thing I wanna show you on this,\nbefore we move on into my alerts,\n\n591\n00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.370\nis the ability to zoom.\n\n592\n00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:48.210\nThis is a pretty small window, but if I\nrecord for an hour, you figure the time\n\n593\n00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:53.910\nscale here is from 3:36 to 3:37,\nthat's one minute of time or so.\n\n594\n00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:54.930\nIf I record for an hour and\n\n595\n00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.890\nI open this up all that data is\ncompressed into this little window.\n\n596\n00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.900\nThere would be an hour of\ninformation displayed there.\n\n597\n00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.630\nIt might be really hard to make sense of\nanything because it's all crammed up.\n\n598\n00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:10.840\nSo what you can do is you can grab these\nlittle handles and you can drag them in.\n\n599\n00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.860\nTo an interesting point,\nwhatever you were looking for.\n\n600\n00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.950\nAgain, doesn't make much sense on\nthis sample cuz it's so small.\n\n601\n00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.960\nBut on a bigger sample,\nthis would make sense.\n\n602\n00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.600\nOnce you drag those handles in,\nyou right click on that gray area and\n\n603\n00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.175\nchoose zoom too.\n\n604\n00:30:24.175 --> 00:30:27.183\nAnd now you'll see I'm only\nlooking from 6:36:50 to 6:36:54,\n\n605\n00:30:27.183 --> 00:30:30.785\nso there's four seconds\nof data right there.\n\n606\n00:30:30.785 --> 00:30:33.965\nIf this was an hour, I could zoom into\na particular 10 minutes during that hour\n\n607\n00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:35.705\nthat I know there was a problem.\n\n608\n00:30:35.705 --> 00:30:37.545\nSo it gives me the ability to zoom in.\n\n609\n00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:43.345\nWhen I'm done, I'm gonna drag\nthose handles back out to the end,\n\n610\n00:30:43.345 --> 00:30:45.221\nright click zoom to.\n\n611\n00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:47.406\nAnd it brings me out to the entire graph,\nso\n\n612\n00:30:47.406 --> 00:30:50.696\nsomething very handy to try to\nfind that detailed information.\n\n613\n00:30:50.696 --> 00:30:51.555\n>> It really is.\n\n614\n00:30:51.555 --> 00:30:53.579\nIt does help you to pinpoint that, and\n\n615\n00:30:53.579 --> 00:30:55.992\nthat way you can actually\ntake a look at that.\n\n616\n00:30:55.992 --> 00:30:57.438\nAnd then if you bring up another machine,\n\n617\n00:30:57.438 --> 00:30:59.393\nthen you can actually measure\nthat same period of time.\n\n618\n00:30:59.393 --> 00:31:02.417\nBut it may be that I should tell you what\nthe difference is in the performance\n\n619\n00:31:02.417 --> 00:31:04.433\nbetween those two machines\nif you needed it to, or\n\n620\n00:31:04.433 --> 00:31:05.975\neven over different periods of time.\n\n621\n00:31:05.975 --> 00:31:06.639\n>> Absolutely.\n\n622\n00:31:06.639 --> 00:31:09.887\nAll right, so the last thing I\nwant to show you is an alert.\n\n623\n00:31:09.887 --> 00:31:12.098\nAnd if we come back up here\nunder data collector set,\n\n624\n00:31:12.098 --> 00:31:15.890\nyou might have saw this when I was\ncreating the data collector set earlier.\n\n625\n00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:19.220\nData collector sets are great for\ncreating our baselines and then for\n\n626\n00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.890\ncapturing new information and\ncomparing it back to the baseline.\n\n627\n00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:28.210\nBut what if there's a ways that I\ncould monitor a particular counter and\n\n628\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:33.210\nnot sit here and watch it all day long and\nnot graph out hours of time?\n\n629\n00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:37.490\nI just need to know if it ever reaches\na certain point, like my processor.\n\n630\n00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:41.690\nIf my processor ever hits 98%,\nI want to know.\n\n631\n00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.300\nWell, I could sit here and\nwatch it all day long.\n\n632\n00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.689\nI'm probably gonna get terminated, because\nI'm not gonna be very productive, right?\n\n633\n00:31:47.689 --> 00:31:50.185\nSo I can create what's called an alert.\n\n634\n00:31:50.185 --> 00:31:53.064\nYou create them the same way we\ncreated the data collector set.\n\n635\n00:31:53.064 --> 00:31:56.489\nYou right-click Data Collector Set.\n\n636\n00:31:56.489 --> 00:31:58.032\nAnd you go down to user defined.\n\n637\n00:31:58.032 --> 00:31:59.507\nSorry you don't right\nclick data collector set.\n\n638\n00:31:59.507 --> 00:32:03.270\nYou right click user defined and\nchoose new data collector set, and\n\n639\n00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:04.790\nI'm gonna give it a name.\n\n640\n00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:09.380\nI'm gonna call it my Processor Alert\n\n641\n00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.150\nand I'm gonna create it manually,\nand I'll click next.\n\n642\n00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.180\nSo so far, no different.\n\n643\n00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.220\nBut here I'm gonna choose\nperformance counter alert,\n\n644\n00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.620\ninstead of create data logs.\n\n645\n00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.560\nI'll click next and\n\n646\n00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.480\nI'll leave my credentials the same and\nI'll click finish.\n\n647\n00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.990\nJust like my data collector set,\nI need to go back in and\n\n648\n00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.720\nmake a couple changes there\nonce I've created it.\n\n649\n00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.590\nThere's my processor alert.\n\n650\n00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:39.990\nI'm gonna go right click on that data\ncollector 01 and chose properties, and\n\n651\n00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:44.740\nnow I can see, I should be able to see\nthe counters that have been added.\n\n652\n00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.606\nI can change my sample interval.\n\n653\n00:32:47.606 --> 00:32:52.911\nAnd I'll change that to every one second,\nand the alert, where is my counter.\n\n654\n00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:54.285\n>> It doesn't look like you added it in.\n\n655\n00:32:54.285 --> 00:32:56.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh you know what, I did, didn't I?\n\n656\n00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.087\nI did not, I might have clicked next and\njust gone a little too fast there, so\n\n657\n00:32:59.087 --> 00:33:00.650\nlet's add that real quick.\n\n658\n00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:04.640\nThat is an important part of creating\nthe alert, is telling it what you wanna\n\n659\n00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.660\nget alerted for, so let's find that\npercent processor time and add it.\n\n660\n00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:14.550\nAnd I'll click okay there, and\nnow I've got my counter and\n\n661\n00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.200\nI wanna get alerted when?\n\n662\n00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.410\nWell let's say I wanna get it when\nany time my processor goes above 10%.\n\n663\n00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.290\nIn the real world it might\nbe something like this.\n\n664\n00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.490\nIt might be any time it goes above 98%.\n\n665\n00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:29.880\nFor the lab here,\nI'm gonna change that to 1,\n\n666\n00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.330\njust because I wanna trigger it here,\nso it'll be easy to trigger.\n\n667\n00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:40.270\nEvery one second check and see if my\nprocessor is above 1% processor time.\n\n668\n00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:44.539\nOn the next tab over is the alert action,\nand I got a lot of choices.\n\n669\n00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.141\nI can choose the login entry.\n\n670\n00:33:47.141 --> 00:33:49.150\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Through the application log, and\n\n671\n00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.380\nthat's it, all right?\n\n672\n00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.368\nBut remember from our other episode,\nin the event viewer,\n\n673\n00:33:53.368 --> 00:33:56.071\nI can now associate tasks\nwith particular event IDs.\n\n674\n00:33:56.071 --> 00:33:59.871\nSo I could figure out, I could wait for\nit to trigger the event,\n\n675\n00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:04.675\nfind it in the event viewer, get my event\nID and then have a scheduled task send me\n\n676\n00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:09.440\nan email any time that particular\nevent gets logged into the event log.\n\n677\n00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.470\nSo, if I use my brain, and we try to\ncombine some things that we've learned\n\n678\n00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:15.400\nhere, we can actually make\na pretty good system out of this.\n\n679\n00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.080\nSo, login entry to\nthe application event log.\n\n680\n00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.450\nI could also start a data collector set.\n\n681\n00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:25.360\nIf my processor gets over 90%,\nI want to start logging it, all right.\n\n682\n00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.650\nSo I might have a data collector\nset already created, waiting, and\n\n683\n00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:32.740\nas soon as that alert gets triggered,\nit fires up that data collector set.\n\n684\n00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.500\nI can also do an alert task.\n\n685\n00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.030\nI can write my own script or\nrun a program.\n\n686\n00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.600\n>> Nice.\n\n687\n00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.560\n>> So it gives me some flexibility there.\n\n688\n00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.160\nRight?\n\n689\n00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:40.750\n>> Sure does.\n\n690\n00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.950\nYou know, there's some of these features\nI haven't really gone that in depth to\n\n691\n00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:48.200\nactually be able to think about creating\nalert tasks that will alert something.\n\n692\n00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.280\nThat it could do what\nwe're talking about here,\n\n693\n00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.920\nso it might be where it sends them\nlike an email or something like that.\n\n694\n00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.680\n>> Exactly, I can even have every one\nsecond if it's up above one percent,\n\n695\n00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.870\nmy inbox is now flooded and Don's calling\nme saying why is your mailbox so big?\n\n696\n00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:04.280\nSo we go ahead and click okay on that,\nand then you do have to start it.\n\n697\n00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.420\nSo I'll go ahead and click on it and\nchoose start and now it's running, but\n\n698\n00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.210\nI don't see anything.\n\n699\n00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.300\nI'm not going to see a graph,\nI'm not going to see any information but\n\n700\n00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.280\nwhat's going to happen is it's going to,\nwell,\n\n701\n00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.250\nwhatever I chose to do when I\npulled up those properties.\n\n702\n00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:21.820\nSo let me open up a couple of things, make\nmy system try to get it over one percent,\n\n703\n00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.070\nwhich shouldn't be too much of\na challenge on this virtual machine.\n\n704\n00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:27.660\nAnd then I'm going to go ahead and\nstop that guy.\n\n705\n00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.830\nAnd let's see what happened.\n\n706\n00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.396\nI'm gonna go over to my event viewer.\n\n707\n00:35:36.552 --> 00:35:40.350\nAnd sometimes this is a little bit weird,\nI'm gonna, let's see what happens here.\n\n708\n00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.030\nI'm gonna go to Windows logs now,\n\n709\n00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:45.410\nyou saw where it said I'm gonna log\nan entry into the application log.\n\n710\n00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.340\nSo, I'm looking at my application log now.\n\n711\n00:35:49.545 --> 00:35:53.340\nI'll see that there are no events that\nhad to do with my performance monitor.\n\n712\n00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.720\nAll right.\n\n713\n00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.660\nNothing there.\n\n714\n00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.670\nAnd this is just something\nyou have to know.\n\n715\n00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:03.496\nI don't know why it says that, I think\nthey've changed the log filer used and\n\n716\n00:36:03.496 --> 00:36:06.702\nthey never updated\nthe interface to reflect that.\n\n717\n00:36:06.702 --> 00:36:10.158\nThey need to modify that because where\nit's actually gonna go is down here in\n\n718\n00:36:10.158 --> 00:36:11.299\napplication services.\n\n719\n00:36:11.299 --> 00:36:15.022\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Microsoft Windows and\n\n720\n00:36:15.022 --> 00:36:18.938\nthen diagnosis PLA operational.\n\n721\n00:36:18.938 --> 00:36:20.192\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know, right?\n\n722\n00:36:20.192 --> 00:36:21.900\nRonnie buried way in there.\n\n723\n00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.654\n>> That's intuitive.\n\n724\n00:36:22.654 --> 00:36:24.813\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You knew right where to go didn't you?\n\n725\n00:36:24.813 --> 00:36:27.104\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I would have known exactly never\n\n726\n00:36:27.104 --> 00:36:27.730\nwhere to go.\n\n727\n00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:32.080\nAnd there I can see, data collection set,\ndata processor alerts stopped.\n\n728\n00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.650\nRight, that's where I turned it off,\nright before that I can see\n\n729\n00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:40.240\nperformance counter percent process\ntime has tripped the alert threshold.\n\n730\n00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.960\nThe counter value of 11\nis over the limit of 1.\n\n731\n00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.080\nAnd if I scroll down through\nthese messages here,\n\n732\n00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.130\nI should see I get one every one second.\n\n733\n00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:53.560\nIf you watch the log time there, every\none second it was measuring that counter,\n\n734\n00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.080\nand it's recording those events,\nall right.\n\n735\n00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.220\nSo that's a way that I can still stay\non top of performance, but not have to\n\n736\n00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.440\nsit there and monitor it all day long or\nhave it open on a window beside me and\n\n737\n00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.850\nkeep glancing over it and\nthings like that.\n\n738\n00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.610\n>> It really does seem\nlike a very handy tool,\n\n739\n00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.600\nespecially when you're incredibly busy.\n\n740\n00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.030\nBut you know on the one system,\nif you know you're looking for\n\n741\n00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.530\nthat one event and you're actually\ntrying to see if it is gonna trigger,\n\n742\n00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:17.515\nit's probably the best way to go.\n\n743\n00:37:17.515 --> 00:37:20.630\n>> Absolutely.You know,\nI don't find that as useful as\n\n744\n00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.920\nclients unless I know there's a problem\nand I might set up an alert or\n\n745\n00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.940\nsomething to get notified if that\nprocessor spikes or something tell you\n\n746\n00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.600\nwhere I really find that one handy is\non file servers and things like that.\n\n747\n00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.640\nCuz you could do available\nmegabytes right?\n\n748\n00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.840\nAnd so I can have it monitoring\nmy hard drive space for me,\n\n749\n00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:46.100\nif available megabytes drops below 1,024,\ntrigger an alert in the event log.\n\n750\n00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.990\nAnd then in the event log it\ncan say send me an email.\n\n751\n00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:53.187\nSo those files rivers, if any of them\never drops below a gig of free space,\n\n752\n00:37:53.187 --> 00:37:54.700\nI'm gonna get an email.\n\n753\n00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.130\nI don't have to log into the servers\nanytime or go look at it manually, or\n\n754\n00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.790\nanything like that.\n\n755\n00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:01.100\nSo you get a little creative\nwith this stuff and\n\n756\n00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.970\nyou can make it pretty darn powerful.\n\n757\n00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:07.940\n>> Yeah it seems like a handy tool to\nreally keep you up to date on what's going\n\n758\n00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.450\non, instead of you having to go\nto search for the information.\n\n759\n00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:11.490\n>> Absolutely.\n\n760\n00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.320\nAll right Ronnie, well that's about\nI've got on performance monitor,\n\n761\n00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.010\nanything else we can throw in there?\n\n762\n00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:19.960\n>> Nothing that I can throw in there, but\nit's actually a incredible tool, right.\n\n763\n00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.440\nSo, don't overlook it.\n\n764\n00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.840\nIt's easier to say, you know,\nwe've got third party tool to do all this.\n\n765\n00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.840\nAnd if you're comfortable with that,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n766\n00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.450\nBut running the Windows world, they went\nin and built this tool in for you, and so\n\n767\n00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.950\nthere may be times when you\nare actually supporting,\n\n768\n00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:39.000\nmaybe there's not your main job, maybe\na night job and maybe another job and you\n\n769\n00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.450\nactually have to do something like this,\nit's right there, take advantage of it.\n\n770\n00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:43.720\n>> And\nyou guys can play with this at home right?\n\n771\n00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.650\n>> RIght.\n>> It's hosted on a server,\n\n772\n00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.120\nthere wasn't anything I had to download,\n\n773\n00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.500\nit is built in to your Windows operating\nsystem so take advantage of that.\n\n774\n00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.786\nJump in there, play around with it,\nget comfortable with it.\n\n775\n00:38:51.786 --> 00:38:53.177\nBecause you're going to end up needing\nthem when you end up in the real world.\n\n776\n00:38:53.177 --> 00:38:54.892\n>> Right.\n\n777\n00:38:54.892 --> 00:38:57.450\n>> All right well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe want to thank everybody for tuning in,\n\n778\n00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.880\nsigning off for ITProTV,\ni'm Mike Broderick.\n\n779\n00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.630\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n780\n00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.447\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n781\n00:39:02.447 --> 00:39:05.232\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14.855\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:16.475\nWith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:17.275\nHow are you, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:18.185\n>> I'm doing fine today.\n\n7\n00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:21.190\nIt's another wonderful day\nto be here in the studio and\n\n8\n00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.293\nto be taking a look at some Windows 7.\n\n9\n00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:27.403\nAnd today, specifically, talking\nabout the reliability of Windows 7.\n\n10\n00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:28.820\n>> Reliability of Windows 7.\n\n11\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.142\nIt's so reliable, right?\n\n12\n00:00:31.142 --> 00:00:31.988\n>> Right.\n>> It is.\n\n13\n00:00:31.988 --> 00:00:36.700\nIt was a pretty, all kidding aside,\nit was a pretty stable operating system.\n\n14\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.020\n>> It was an incredibly, and\n\n15\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.560\nat least for my perspective,\nincredibly stable operating system.\n\n16\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.470\nBecause there was relatively little things\nthat you could actually do to the system\n\n17\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.330\nto really bring it down,\n\n18\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.670\nunless you actually start adding\nsome weird, weird programs.\n\n19\n00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.560\nAnd you probably didn't have\nany real problems with it.\n\n20\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.400\nBut the nice thing about Windows 7 though.\n\n21\n00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.800\nIt actually includes a tool, that we are\ngonna specifically take a look at, to help\n\n22\n00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.440\nmonitor not only some of the different\nperformance things that we've taken a look\n\n23\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.670\nat, such as Performance Monitor, but\nactually reliability unto itself.\n\n24\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.192\nSo, Mike, before we get started\nat taking a look at that,\n\n25\n00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:13.340\nlet's go ahead and define that\nperformance versus reliability again.\n\n26\n00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.037\n>> Absolutely.\n\n27\n00:01:14.037 --> 00:01:17.162\nWe're talking about reliability,\nand you'll hear people talk\n\n28\n00:01:17.162 --> 00:01:20.980\nabout reliability and performance and\ntry to use those guys interchangeably.\n\n29\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.070\nAnd they really do mean\ntwo separate things.\n\n30\n00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.330\nPerformance is about\nyour perception of speed.\n\n31\n00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.950\nWhen I open up Excel,\nhow long does it take to open?\n\n32\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.490\nWhen I go to log on, how long does\nit take me to get to my desktop?\n\n33\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.900\nAnd performance is very relative.\n\n34\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.490\nIt really depends on who's\nperception we're talking about.\n\n35\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.170\nRonnie and I could take a laptop and\npass it back and forth between us.\n\n36\n00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.635\nI might think the laptop is very fast,\n\n37\n00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:46.400\ncuz compared to my piece of junk,\nit is a lot faster.\n\n38\n00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.300\nBut Ronnie takes the same laptop and says,\n\n39\n00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.550\nthis thing is slow as heck, because\ncompared to his laptop, it's a lot slower.\n\n40\n00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.240\nSo same laptop, one person says it's slow,\nthe other person says it's fast.\n\n41\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.770\nPerformance is very perception-based.\n\n42\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.390\nYes, it's very subjective.\n\n43\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.150\nReliability, on the other hand, is how\nsomething conforms to expected behavior.\n\n44\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.310\nIt has nothing to do with performance.\n\n45\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.740\nIf my application crashes, that's not what\nI expect, that's a reliability issue.\n\n46\n00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.900\nIf my operating system blue screens,\nthat's a reliability issue.\n\n47\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.790\nThat's not what I expect it to do.\n\n48\n00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.390\nBut I can have something that works fast,\nit's a very fast laptop, but\n\n49\n00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.550\nit crashes all the time.\n\n50\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.240\nGreat performance, very bad reliability.\n\n51\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.130\nI could have something that never crashed,\nbut it's slow as heck.\n\n52\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.010\nSo great reliability, poor performance.\n\n53\n00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.540\nThey're not related in any way, right?\n\n54\n00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.400\n>> That's true.\n\n55\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.410\nWhenever you start taking\na look at reliability,\n\n56\n00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.640\none of the chief things that we want\nto actually understand as a technician\n\n57\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.140\nis what causes the computer\nto become unreliable.\n\n58\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.910\nWhat is it on our systems, or is it a part\nof our systems, is it an application,\n\n59\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.630\nis it the hardware, is it the operating\nsystem itself, is it updates?\n\n60\n00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.980\nWhatever it might be.\n\n61\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.810\nWhat is it that causes that\nsystem to actually be unreliable?\n\n62\n00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.556\nAnd the problem that we have is simple.\n\n63\n00:03:03.556 --> 00:03:07.460\nSome weeks, like the past couple\nof weeks to me, have gone so\n\n64\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.613\nfast I didn't even realize that\ntwo weeks have just about past.\n\n65\n00:03:11.613 --> 00:03:13.860\nAnd there are some weeks where\nit's actually really slow.\n\n66\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.280\nSo all the sudden when I'm talking about,\n\n67\n00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.330\nmy computer's been actually fairly\nreliable for the past week.\n\n68\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.470\nI may not actually mean anything but\nthe past couple of days, and\n\n69\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.689\nI'm not able to actually\ntake a look at that.\n\n70\n00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.730\nBut with Windows 7 though,\nthey have a tool inside that we call\n\n71\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.860\nthe Reliability Monitor, and this\nparticular tool gives us historical data.\n\n72\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.674\nAnd it can actually go ahead and\nis actually rated on a scale of 1 to 10,\n\n73\n00:03:37.674 --> 00:03:40.502\n10 being the most reliable,\n1 being unreliable.\n\n74\n00:03:40.502 --> 00:03:43.329\nAnd then we can actually graph\nthat in the past history so\n\n75\n00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.241\nthat we can actually see where our\ncomputer's actually been more reliable,\n\n76\n00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:49.889\nand where it's actually\nbecome less reliable, and\n\n77\n00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.406\neven see some of the causes that\nwould have actually shown that to us.\n\n78\n00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:53.996\n>> Absolutely.\nCuz,\n\n79\n00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:58.220\nyou know, having a fast machine is great,\nbut if the thing crashes all the time, or\n\n80\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.510\nif an application hangs up all the time,\nthat is frustrating to an end user.\n\n81\n00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.110\nAnd it means a loss in productivity,\nbecause they've gotta reboot the system,\n\n82\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.690\nor they've gotta wait for\nthe application to free up.\n\n83\n00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.210\nAnd it's a bad experience, and\nit's not good for business,\n\n84\n00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.020\nbecause I've got employees\nthat are not being productive.\n\n85\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.520\nSo, it's nice that Microsoft gives us the\nability to use this Reliability Monitor.\n\n86\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.520\nAs Ronnie said, all it's doing\nit's recording certain events.\n\n87\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.390\nIt takes a look at hardware and\nsoftware issues, as well as some software\n\n88\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.120\ninstallations, and\nit tracks that on a little counter.\n\n89\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.520\nIn fact, I've got it pulled up here on my\nsystem, if we want to take a look at that.\n\n90\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.300\nThis is the Reliability Monitor, and\n\n91\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.340\nwhat it's gonna do is it's going to,\nany time something happens.\n\n92\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.030\nLet's back up.\n\n93\n00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.330\nRonnie said it's on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\n94\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.160\nWe're gonna start out on a 10, 10 is\nthe most stable, 1 is the least stable.\n\n95\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.520\nAny time an event occurs,\nit's gonna record it in here, and\n\n96\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.010\nI'm gonna take a hit on\nmy reliability scale.\n\n97\n00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.490\nSo I can look at this little\nline going across the top,\n\n98\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.070\nand I can see what my reliability is,\nit's a ten, and\n\n99\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.120\nI can see on this particular day,\nfor example, I had some issues.\n\n100\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.770\nWhat's really cool about it is,\n\n101\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.600\nit goes back until the day from when you\ninstalled Windows in the first place.\n\n102\n00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.970\nNow this is a virtual machine, and it's\nonly been running since the 22nd of June,\n\n103\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.050\nso there's not a lot of information here.\n\n104\n00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.030\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nshow you the Reliability Monitor\n\n105\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.860\noff of my laptop that\nI'm actually sitting at.\n\n106\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.660\nIt is running Windows 8, but you'll see\nthe Reliability Monitor hasn't changed, so\n\n107\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.820\nthis is the exact same thing\nyou would see in Windows 7.\n\n108\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.610\nSo we kind of forget about\nthe whole Windows 8 thing.\n\n109\n00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.035\nAnd here's my reliability.\n\n110\n00:05:39.035 --> 00:05:41.155\nAnd you can see that on\nthis particular day,\n\n111\n00:05:41.155 --> 00:05:43.635\nfor example, I took a hit in reliability.\n\n112\n00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.185\nSomething happened.\n\n113\n00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:48.235\nWhat's cool is that I can click on\nthat day, and I can see what happened.\n\n114\n00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:50.775\nOh, VirtualBox stopped working.\n\n115\n00:05:50.775 --> 00:05:52.955\nAnd that's why I've got this red X here.\n\n116\n00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:55.725\nAnd that's why I took\na hit in my reliability.\n\n117\n00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:57.735\nAnd then nothing happened,\nnothing happened,\n\n118\n00:05:57.735 --> 00:06:00.080\nmy reliability is working its way back up.\n\n119\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.240\nAnd then another hit, so\nI can come see what happened on that day.\n\n120\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.390\nOh, Internet Explorer stopped working.\n\n121\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.750\nAll right, so\nthe two events weren't related, so\n\n122\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.090\nI'm probably not going\nto think too much of it.\n\n123\n00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.870\nI keep going.\n\n124\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.340\nI don't see any more major events.\n\n125\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.490\nNothing happened.\n\n126\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.100\nThe idea is if I come in here and I see\nthese hits day after day after day, or\n\n127\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.940\nonce every Monday,\nI can click on each one of those days and\n\n128\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.810\ntry to find the common denominator.\n\n129\n00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.000\nWhat is it that's causing\nthis reliability hit?\n\n130\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.270\nAnd as we've said, we can go back\nto the day I installed Windows.\n\n131\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.170\nIt can be viewed by days, as it is here.\n\n132\n00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.520\nI can also view it by weeks.\n\n133\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.530\nSo now both of those hits\nthat I saw on separate days\n\n134\n00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.200\nare now on this one column right here,\ncuz we're viewing it by week.\n\n135\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.900\nSo there's my VirtualBox and\nInternet Explorer,\n\n136\n00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.760\nand you can see it goes all the way back.\n\n137\n00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.360\nI actually recently reinstalled, so\nin the middle of May, I reinstalled.\n\n138\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.403\nAnd you can see on, oops,\nif we can go back to that there.\n\n139\n00:06:55.403 --> 00:07:00.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> My computer's just giving me fits.\n\n140\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.520\nIt's my mouse.\n\n141\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.660\nToo bad it's not showing\nup on Reliability Monitor.\n\n142\n00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.990\nThen we go back to that first day,\nand here, I can see all of the driver\n\n143\n00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.040\ninstallations, for example, that have\noccurred when I first installed Windows.\n\n144\n00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.990\nSo, not only does it show me reliability\nissues, it's keeping that information.\n\n145\n00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.000\nIt's giving me a historical view,\n\n146\n00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.560\nwhich gives me the ability to try to\nfind those correlations with problems.\n\n147\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.120\nNow that user says,\nmy computer is crashing every other day.\n\n148\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.540\nI can come in here and\nsee what's happening every other day.\n\n149\n00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.370\nAnd hopefully, find something\nin common and say, well yeah,\n\n150\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.670\nyou know what, you've installed this\nprogram you downloaded from the Internet.\n\n151\n00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.710\nAnd ever since then,\nyour reliability has taken these big hits,\n\n152\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.200\nit keeps dropping down.\n\n153\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.110\nSo if we get rid of that program,\nwe can solve your reliability issues.\n\n154\n00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.010\n>> Well, at least you can try that, right?\n\n155\n00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.970\nIf you take a look at that program,\nwhatever w was installed, and you remove\n\n156\n00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.320\nit, and now the reliability continues\nto go up and up, and all of a sudden\n\n157\n00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.360\nyou actually get ten days in a row or\nseven days in a row, whatever it might be.\n\n158\n00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.210\nAnd you're actually realizing that\nthe machine's no longer crashing, well,\n\n159\n00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.770\nyou were able to pinpoint\nwhat was causing the crash.\n\n160\n00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.270\nSometimes it might not be that one.\n\n161\n00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.360\nBut it might be the combination.\n\n162\n00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.410\nThat's were we see where that one column\nthat you have there, we have the red,\n\n163\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.855\nthe yellow, and the blue.\n\n164\n00:08:10.855 --> 00:08:11.615\nYeah.\n\n165\n00:08:11.615 --> 00:08:14.065\nIt managed to be\nthe correlation of all three\n\n166\n00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:16.295\nthat actually caused that crash to happen.\n\n167\n00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:19.035\nAnd so on that day, you're actually\nwatching, and then later on,\n\n168\n00:08:19.035 --> 00:08:20.065\nyou crash again.\n\n169\n00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:21.685\nAnd you then can compare that and\n\n170\n00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:24.340\nanother one that actually happens\nwith all the three of those.\n\n171\n00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.740\nThe same thing, you gotta say, all right.\n\n172\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.470\nSomething about all three of these\nbeing right there at that one time\n\n173\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.440\nthat is causing it, but\nwhat is it that triggered it?\n\n174\n00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.370\nAnd you can go back and again, eliminate\nit or isolate each one of those instances.\n\n175\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.850\nPull one away and watch,\ndoes reliability continue to climb?\n\n176\n00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.600\nOr does it actually crash again?\n\n177\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.270\nPull the other one away and all of\na sudden you actually start disappearing,\n\n178\n00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.000\nyour reliability continues to climb and\nnow you're at a ten for\n\n179\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.880\nseveral days again, then you're able to\nactually figure out what was happening.\n\n180\n00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.220\nSo it's a really neat tool, especially for\n\n181\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.016\na technician, that you're not\nexactly sure what is causing it.\n\n182\n00:08:59.016 --> 00:09:02.251\nMonitor it over time,\nsee what shows up here on the bottom, and\n\n183\n00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:05.257\nyou can see over on the right-hand\nside what it shows you.\n\n184\n00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:08.626\nApplication failures, Windows failures,\nMiscellaneous failures,\n\n185\n00:09:08.626 --> 00:09:09.901\nthat's kind of a neat one.\n\n186\n00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:12.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then, of course, the Warning and\n\n187\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.850\nthe Information ones.\n\n188\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.880\nAnd these are also events\nthat'll probably show up,\n\n189\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.030\nof course, in your event log, too.\n\n190\n00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.250\nSo don't overlook that, as well.\n\n191\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.010\nEverything seems to tie back when\nwe're talking about monitoring.\n\n192\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.140\nAnd then you can see underneath\nwhere it actually does show you\n\n193\n00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.630\nsome of these events.\n\n194\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:30.620\nAnd if you need more information, it says\nview technical details if you need to.\n\n195\n00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.060\nEspecially if there's some update when\nthis happened, and you installed those\n\n196\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.460\nupdates and your machine immediately\ncrashed, well, you can go back there and\n\n197\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.720\nactually take a look at what that\ninformation may actually entail.\n\n198\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.910\nAnd maybe see something that,\n\n199\n00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.080\nthat you might actually have to uninstall\nthat update and come back to, as well.\n\n200\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.108\n>> Absolutely, yeah, I was just\nlooking to see what it told you here.\n\n201\n00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:51.088\nSo Microsoft Office Professional Plus\n2013,\n\n202\n00:09:51.088 --> 00:09:54.082\nunsuccessful application reconfiguration.\n\n203\n00:09:54.082 --> 00:09:54.727\n>> There you go.\n\n204\n00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.970\n>> I click on that, technical details.\n\n205\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.910\nAnd I get the install,\nreconfigure the product.\n\n206\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.370\nIt doesn't tell me a whole lot more,\nMicrosoft, that's not a lot of details,\n\n207\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.900\nbut at least it's trying.\n\n208\n00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.170\nAs Ronnie said,\nthat can be your first step.\n\n209\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.340\nMaybe from there I can go out and\n\n210\n00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.360\nuse my search engine to\nfind some more information.\n\n211\n00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.210\nOn this problem, though, it actually\nhas a check for solution option.\n\n212\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.580\nI can click on that.\n\n213\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.000\nAnd it's gonna run those little\ntroubleshooters that are built into\n\n214\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.880\nWindows.\n\n215\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.069\nAnd I don't have the problem anymore.\n\n216\n00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:22.299\nSo it's not really finding anything.\n\n217\n00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:24.730\nBut it might be your first step.\n\n218\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.744\nAnd remember,\nwhen we're talking about troubleshooting,\n\n219\n00:10:26.744 --> 00:10:28.960\nwe're always talking about using\nthe the easiest solution first.\n\n220\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.969\nHeck, if my system can fix itself,\nI'm all for it, right?\n\n221\n00:10:31.969 --> 00:10:33.714\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n222\n00:10:33.714 --> 00:10:37.475\nAnd having this information\nbe in front of you is a good,\n\n223\n00:10:37.475 --> 00:10:42.115\neasy step for you to take a look at,\nespecially if the user is starting\n\n224\n00:10:42.115 --> 00:10:47.510\nto complain about the computer crashing\nmore often than it did before.\n\n225\n00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.530\nThe advantage that you also have\nthen is to be able to save it.\n\n226\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.770\nIn the lower left-hand corner,\nyou see there on my computer,\n\n227\n00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.190\nwhere it says save\nthe reliability history.\n\n228\n00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.660\nAnd that gives you that ability to save it\nin case you need to finally go ahead and\n\n229\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.720\nsay, look we're just going\nto re-image this computer.\n\n230\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.190\nSomething else is going on.\n\n231\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.860\nAnd now this starts happening again,\nand you're like,\n\n232\n00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.870\nI wonder if it's the same\nthing that's causing it.\n\n233\n00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.320\nYou have the ability to go back in and\nactually save this, and\n\n234\n00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.810\nthen compare it again one day.\n\n235\n00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.390\n>> Absolutely.\n\n236\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.390\nIt's a really nice tool\nthat they've given us, and\n\n237\n00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.800\nmost people just don't know it's there.\n\n238\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.620\nSo take advantage of that.\n\n239\n00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.720\nIt's something that, like I said,\nI know on my system on home,\n\n240\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.640\nI was just having fun,\nRonnie, and goofing around.\n\n241\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.180\nAnd you're able to go back a year and\nsee problems that happened.\n\n242\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.390\nBut again, you can start to see patterns.\n\n243\n00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:32.570\nThat's the idea is maybe I can figure out,\nor as you said,\n\n244\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.630\nsome combination of things.\n\n245\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.530\nIt only happens when this and\nthis are occurring at the same time.\n\n246\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.890\nThat's when my system blue screens.\n\n247\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.100\nSo those are the kind of things we can\nfigure out using this Reliability Monitor.\n\n248\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.780\n>> Yeah, and if the reliability\ncontinues to go down, over the time and\n\n249\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.380\nperformance, it could be just that.\n\n250\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.200\nThe very fact is it's starting\nto see more and more stuff.\n\n251\n00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.540\nAnd when that starts to happen,\n\n252\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.720\nthen you might realize it's time to just\nreinstall the thing and start all over.\n\n253\n00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.950\nCuz the more often that you're\nusing that operating system,\n\n254\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.230\nthe more often it's actually swapping\nthings on and off the hard drive,\n\n255\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.150\nthe more that you're operating system\ncan become bloated with other things.\n\n256\n00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.800\nAnd it's just gonna cause problems.\n\n257\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.820\nAnd it may be time to restart,\nso, you just never know.\n\n258\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.430\n>> You never know.\n\n259\n00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.900\nAll right, well,\nnot the longest episode out there,\n\n260\n00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.428\nit's a pretty simple little thing.\n\n261\n00:12:17.428 --> 00:12:18.390\nIt's all read-only.\n\n262\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.590\nI really can't do anything from here\nother than view the technical details and\n\n263\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.780\nlaunch some of Microsoft's\ntroubleshooters.\n\n264\n00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.300\nBut that's about it.\n\n265\n00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.200\nThat's all you can do.\n\n266\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.940\nBut it's good information to have,\n\n267\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.410\ngood information to be able to\nget access to when you need it.\n\n268\n00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.110\nSo anything else we wanna throw\nin about the Reliability Monitor?\n\n269\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.250\n>> Remember, by itself,\n\n270\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.110\nit's no indication that everything\nis wrong on your computer, right?\n\n271\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.500\nYou put this together with the other\nmonitoring tools that we've talked about.\n\n272\n00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.320\nMaking sure you take a look at\nthe event viewer, taking a look at\n\n273\n00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.120\nthe Performance Monitoring in itself,\nusing data collector sets,\n\n274\n00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.550\neven taking a look into the Task Manager\nand putting all that together, right.\n\n275\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:59.260\nNow you actually have a fairly effective\nmonitoring set of tools that you can use.\n\n276\n00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.670\nNot really an extra dollar\nthat you actually had,\n\n277\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:06.210\nbut you might wondering like, Ronnie's\nreally dollar-conscientious about this.\n\n278\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.950\nIt's because some of these tools that\nyou spend hundreds of dollars on or\n\n279\n00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.080\neven thousands of dollars\nin an enterprise,\n\n280\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.040\nyou might find out that it's already\nbuilt into the operating system, and\n\n281\n00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.330\nit just takes a little bit\nof time getting used to it.\n\n282\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.680\nIt might not be as streamlined and\nall together, but it's there,\n\n283\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.270\nand it's actually available to you.\n\n284\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.157\nAnd I like that idea.\n\n285\n00:13:23.157 --> 00:13:25.422\n>> Absolutely, take advantage\nof the free stuff first, right?\n\n286\n00:13:25.422 --> 00:13:27.590\nI think Chris said out there,\nfree is good.\n\n287\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.480\n>> That's right.\n\n288\n00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.260\n>> Always.\n\n289\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.450\nAll right, well, ladies and gentleman,\nwe wanna thank everybody for tuning in.\n\n290\n00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.900\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n291\n00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:35.740\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n292\n00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.767\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.000\nI’m your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.150\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.100\nHi, I'm doing fine today.\n\n7\n00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.025\nIt's another beautiful day here in\nFlorida, nice and wet this afternoon.\n\n8\n00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:23.660\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> But that means that we get to be here\n\n9\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.750\nin the studio, taking a look at\nsome Windows 7 content today.\n\n10\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.400\n>> Absolutely.\n\n11\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.160\nAnd today in particular, we're going to be\nlooking at remote administration, remote\n\n12\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.980\nserver administration And Ron, there's\na few different tools we can use to do, or\n\n13\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.230\na few different ways we can go\nabout doing remote administration.\n\n14\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.980\nAnd I think today,\n\n15\n00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.080\nwe're gonna focus on something known\nas the Remote Server Admin Tools,\n\n16\n00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.260\nor RSAT,\nthat we can download from Microsoft.\n\n17\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.740\n>> Well, yeah, before we get in to there,\n\n18\n00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.380\nlet's talk about how we normally would do\n>> Server administration, Mike, so\n\n19\n00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.950\nwe have a bunch of servers,\nwe install our Server 2012,\n\n20\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.370\nServer 2008 machine, and once I get\nthat all configured and now I have to go\n\n21\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.020\nback and change something, normally\n>> Only that would actually mean that\n\n22\n00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.810\nI have to do what?\n\n23\n00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.970\n>> Well I'm gonna go get my\nkey to the server closet.\n\n24\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.530\nI'm gonna walk in there and I'm gonna pull\nout the KVM and I'm gonna try to figure\n\n25\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.497\nout if I remember how to switch-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:12.651\n>> Between machines and\n\n27\n00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.316\nhope that darn thing is working.\n\n28\n00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:17.582\nSlap it on the side a couple times and\nget connected and do that.\n\n29\n00:01:17.582 --> 00:01:18.158\nEvery time.\n\n30\n00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:20.080\n>> Yeah,\nI guess we could do that every time but\n\n31\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.450\nthat becomes a little bit tedious.\n\n32\n00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.860\nServer closet can get a little bit warm.\n\n33\n00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.860\nGet a little bit loud and\n\n34\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.100\nwhen you walk out you're like I can't\nbelieve it can be this quiet Permissions?\n\n35\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.150\n>> I might not be, when we talk\nabout security and things like that.\n\n36\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.710\nI might be a DNS admin.\n\n37\n00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.660\nI want to get in there and manage that\nDNS server, but I'm not a domain admin.\n\n38\n00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.500\nI shouldn't have physical access\nto the domain controllers and\n\n39\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.280\nall the other servers that are in there.\n\n40\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.320\nSo that's probably a big no-no when\nit comes to our security policies,\n\n41\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.010\nallowing me in that server\nclass in the first place.\n\n42\n00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.760\n>> Yeah, and so\n\n43\n00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.230\nwhen you actually start managing that is\none thing that you have to worry about.\n\n44\n00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.740\nBut the other way that we can do it,\nwe could use Remote Desktop.\n\n45\n00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.150\nAnd even though that's common, it's really\nnot the recommended method anymore.\n\n46\n00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.010\nReally, Microsoft talks about the idea\nof You shouldn't have to do what,\n\n47\n00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.830\nactually go to the server to manage it.\n\n48\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.970\n>> Right.\nAnd it kind of falls on the same\n\n49\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.650\nlogic, right.\n\n50\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.100\nIf I remote desktop into that DNS server,\n\n51\n00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.050\nI could access other\nthings other than DNS.\n\n52\n00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.650\nThat DNS server might be doing other\nfunctions on my network, right.\n\n53\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.110\nAnd now there's the potential I'm\ngetting access to the entire desktop\n\n54\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.690\nHopefully my permissions are being and\nI can't go in and mess with DHCP or\n\n55\n00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.310\nanything else that's running on\nthe machine, but it is a risk, right?\n\n56\n00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.870\nSo I don't really want to allow\nthat DNS admin To be able to remote\n\n57\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.800\ninto that server, especially if\nit's doing things other than DNS.\n\n58\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.370\nNot to mention what if you have\n5 DNS servers, 10 DNS servers.\n\n59\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.870\nHow many different remote desk top\nWindows serves am I going to have open at\n\n60\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.560\nthe same time.\n\n61\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.300\nHow do I keep straight which on is which?\n\n62\n00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.300\nMicrosoft have their remote MMC,\n\n63\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.020\nwhich can help a little bit,\nbut still pretty clunky.\n\n64\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.860\n>> It is one of those unusual things\nthat You have to deal with when you\n\n65\n00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.620\nstart managing remote windows and all\nthe servers almost look like identical,\n\n66\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.860\nwhich usually when I remote into them,\nI'm like, am I on the right server or not?\n\n67\n00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.540\nI always check the name.\n\n68\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.680\nBut by using the remote server\nadministration tool, this is where we can\n\n69\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.000\ncustom manage servers remotely\nfrom our Windows 7 desktop.\n\n70\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.240\nSo without ever really having\nto actually go to a server.\n\n71\n00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.880\nWe can actually use some tools\nthat we put on our machine and\n\n72\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.610\nmanage them from there and actually\nlimit our access to what we need, right\n\n73\n00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.260\n>> Exactly.\n\n74\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.830\nYou know, when you go to a server if\nyou install DNS, then that DNS console,\n\n75\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.840\nthat management snap in is\ninstalled on that server.\n\n76\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.560\nRight?\n\n77\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.720\nBut I'm not sitting at\nthat server everyday.\n\n78\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.210\nI'm sitting at my little\ncubicle at my Windows 7 laptop.\n\n79\n00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.980\nI don't have DNS installed on my laptop,\nI don't have the DNS console.\n\n80\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.420\nSo how do I Remotely\nmanage that DNS server.\n\n81\n00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.000\nAnd that goes for for any server,\nActive Directory or DHCP,\n\n82\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.590\nGroup Policy anything like that,\nbecause those tools are part of Windows 7.\n\n83\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.480\nWell Microsoft gives us the remote\nserver administration tools.\n\n84\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.480\nAnd basically what I'm doing\nis I'm downloading, and\n\n85\n00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.430\nit's free from Microsoft I'm downloading\nall those administration consoles.\n\n86\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.760\nAnd I'm installing them on\nmy Windows 7 machine and\n\n87\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.780\nthen all I have to do is point\nthem to the actual server,\n\n88\n00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.860\ncuz remember, those consoles\nallow you to change the focus.\n\n89\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.010\nWe can point them to different machines.\n\n90\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.940\nSo that's all we have to do, is really,\nis download those R sat tools,\n\n91\n00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.900\ninstall them, and then set them\nup to connect to our servers.\n\n92\n00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.790\n>> So now that we understand what it is\nthat it does, and why we really want it.\n\n93\n00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.230\nWe really need to get to that point where\nwe start talking about installing it.\n\n94\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.770\nA lot of times most people will\ndefault back to the Remote Desktop and\n\n95\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.990\nthey can't get these tools up and running.\n\n96\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.440\nWhat we want to do today,\nof course, is make sure\n\n97\n00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.030\nthat we can get these tools installed and\nget them up and running, as well.\n\n98\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.060\nAnd Mike's gonna actually show us\na couple of different things here\n\n99\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.330\nto make sure that we\nget it done correctly.\n\n100\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.040\n>> All right, so if we take a look at my\nscreen here, what I've got is Microsoft\n\n101\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.520\npage and I just threw up a link\nin the chat room there as well.\n\n102\n00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.590\nWe'll put them with the show notes,\nif you're watching or recording this.\n\n103\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.540\nBut, all I did was basically\nuse a search of your choice For\n\n104\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.080\nremote server or RSAT, R S A T.\n\n105\n00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.110\nRemote server administration tools.\n\n106\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.530\nAnd then for the particular\nflavor of your operating system.\n\n107\n00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.210\nThis is a Windows 7 and so\nwe're talking about Windows 7.\n\n108\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.480\nI had to make sure I get RSAT.\n\n109\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.350\nFor Windows 7.\n\n110\n00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.730\nIn this case,\nWindows 7 with Service Pack 1.\n\n111\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.930\nThere's a different one available,\nif you were gonna be installing this on\n\n112\n00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.670\na Windows Vista or a Windows 8 or\nsomething like that.\n\n113\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.250\nSo you first have to make sure\nyou're getting the right edition.\n\n114\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.728\nAlso the different platforms.\n\n115\n00:05:33.728 --> 00:05:36.480\n64-bit versus 32-bit.\n\n116\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.960\nAnd then you're gonna download this.\n\n117\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.330\nAnd it's not a huge file.\n\n118\n00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.770\nIt's about 200 and some odd megabytes.\n\n119\n00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.390\nAnd I've already downloaded it to a little\nvirtual machine that I have running here\n\n120\n00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.100\nand let me unlock this guy so\nit'll stretch out again and\n\n121\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.500\ntake up my entire desktop.\n\n122\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.080\nHopefully.\n\n123\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.520\nI'll just do a little.\n\n124\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.630\nThere we go.\n\n125\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.990\nSo, this is my virtual machine that's\nrunning Windows 7 and I've already\n\n126\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.160\ndownloaded the remote server admin tools\nfrom Microsoft and this is it right here.\n\n127\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.690\nIt looks like and it actually is basically\nan update that you get from Microsoft.\n\n128\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.420\nSo, it's Windows.\n\n129\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.520\nI think, it says, 6 point 21 kb and\na few different numbers.\n\n130\n00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.330\nYou run that.\n\n131\n00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.300\nIt does take a little\nbit of time to install.\n\n132\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.510\nWe were kind of joking\nabout that earlier so\n\n133\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.470\nI've already run this and\nI've already installed it.\n\n134\n00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.940\nDownload it Double-click on it, give it\nadministrative access if it asks for it,\n\n135\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.200\nand let it install.\n\n136\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.380\nSo that’s step number one.\n\n137\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.690\nGo out, find the right version,\ndownload it, and run it.\n\n138\n00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.880\n>> Now, Mike, is there any prerequisites\non it, or anything like that?\n\n139\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.870\nNo, really not.\nAs long as you get the one that's for\n\n140\n00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.780\nyour particular version.\n\n141\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.990\n>> Right.\n>> You should be good to go.\n\n142\n00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.340\nNow if I go out and try to get the one for\nWindows 8, and try to run it on Windows 7,\n\n143\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.710\nit might balk at me a little bit there.\n\n144\n00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.650\nSo, you just make sure that\nyou're getting the right one.\n\n145\n00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.400\nNow the interesting thing about this,\nonce you install it on Windows.\n\n146\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.720\n7.\nIf I go over here to my start menu,\n\n147\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.980\nI don't see anything that is changed.\n\n148\n00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.020\nThere's nothing here.\n\n149\n00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.740\nIf I go to all programs.\n\n150\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.610\nI do have administrator tools, but\n\n151\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.540\nthese are my normal admin tools\nthat I get on any local machine.\n\n152\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.510\nMy local security policy, my event viewer.\n\n153\n00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.330\nMy firewall and things like that,\nno Active Directory users and\n\n154\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.470\ncomputers, no DNS, no DHCP.\n\n155\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.310\nWell, where the heck did they go?\n\n156\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.800\nI just installed them.\n\n157\n00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.170\nWhere are they?\n\n158\n00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.220\nThat's the trick.\n\n159\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.210\nThat's the one thing\nthat sometimes we miss\n\n160\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.810\nis that just because you've installed\nit it doesn't make them all available.\n\n161\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.430\nWhat Microsoft basically says is look,\nthere's a whole bunch of\n\n162\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.990\nconsoles in that remote server admin\ntools, you probably don't need them all.\n\n163\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.270\nYou might be downloading this and\n\n164\n00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.850\ninstalling it just to get that\nDNS console and DHCP console.\n\n165\n00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.981\nSo I'm not gonna just dump them\nall out onto your start menu and\n\n166\n00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:51.090\nmake this big huge menu or\nanything like that.\n\n167\n00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.474\nSo once you've installed it,\nyou still have to go back and\n\n168\n00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:58.963\npick which ones You want to use, and\nwe do that through our control panel, and\n\n169\n00:07:58.963 --> 00:08:00.640\nour add/remove programs.\n\n170\n00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.930\nI'm going to jump over\nto my control panel.\n\n171\n00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:10.670\nAnd I'll go into programs and\nthen turn Windows features on or off.\n\n172\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:17.860\nAnd give it a minute to populate your list\nand now because I've already run that,\n\n173\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.820\nin my list of Windows features is my\nremote server administration tools.\n\n174\n00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.780\nSo I just expand that out and\nI can pick which ones I want.\n\n175\n00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.780\nAnd remember it divides it up.\n\n176\n00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.740\nYou've got Features.\n\n177\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.140\nYou've got Roles.\n\n178\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.910\nYou've also got Server Manager\nwhich I can install as well.\n\n179\n00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.270\nAnd we're gonna take a look at a few\nmore of these in future episodes.\n\n180\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.820\nFor right now,\nI'm gonna expand out Role Administration.\n\n181\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.410\nAnd I'm gonna go down here to active\ndirectory domain services and\n\n182\n00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.340\nlightweight directory services.\n\n183\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.770\nI could install the active directory\nmodule for Windows PowerShell and\n\n184\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.040\nhere's my Active Directory Tools and\n\n185\n00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.150\nI'm gonna choose my\nActive Directory Domain Services.\n\n186\n00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.000\nSnap in and Command Line tools.\n\n187\n00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.650\nNow I can choose as many as I want.\n\n188\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:04.200\nLet's say I also want to be able\nto administer DHCP as well as DNS.\n\n189\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.540\nI can include those, there, as well.\n\n190\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.430\nAnything else we want to add to that,\nRonnie?\n\n191\n00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.250\n>> Now, we've still got some group policy\nthat we actually want to deal with.\n\n192\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.370\nDo we add that in right here?\n\n193\n00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:15.890\n>> We do.\n\n194\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.430\nIf we go up to Features I've got\nmy group policy management tools.\n\n195\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.230\nSo, let's go ahead and\ncheck that one as well.\n\n196\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.510\nWe'll do a little group policy management,\nput a little check mark there, and\n\n197\n00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.940\nthat should be good for us.\n\n198\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.550\nI'll click OK, and\nit's gonna take a few minutes, and\n\n199\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.410\nit's gonna go ahead and\ninstall these tools.\n\n200\n00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.130\n>> Nice thing that we actually are seeing\nhere too is that maybe later on\n\n201\n00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.690\nwe do need more of these tools, but\nwe don't have to install them right away\n\n202\n00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.350\njust to have them holding space for\nright now.\n\n203\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.680\nWhat we want to do instead is actually\nadd them in when we need to, or\n\n204\n00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.070\nif we actually need, to at some\npoint in the future, remove them,\n\n205\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.090\nsince we don't need\naccess to that anymore.\n\n206\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.150\nSo it is a nice little utility for\n\n207\n00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.600\nus to be able to actually\nuse Windows to do that,\n\n208\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.460\nand that way we're not actually having\na fairly cluttered operating system.\n\n209\n00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.240\n>> Let's say you're\nsetting up a machine for\n\n210\n00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.560\n>> An administrator like your DNS admin.\n\n211\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.610\nWe can use these tools, these snap ins, to\ncreate that custom console and if they're\n\n212\n00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.490\nnot an administrator on the local machine\nthey can't go and add anyone's they want.\n\n213\n00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.920\nWe can add that DNS console for them.\n\n214\n00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.040\nAnd lock, or limit them to\njust managing DNS for example.\n\n215\n00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.450\n>> Right, so as these tools continue to\ninstall what we should see at the end\n\n216\n00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.430\nis a bunch of different ways that we can\nnow use that Windows 7 machine that we're\n\n217\n00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.340\n>> We're sitting at,\n\n218\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.810\nnot having to go to the server,\nnot having to use remote desktop, but\n\n219\n00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.470\nactually be able to zoom in and focus in\non that one DNS server or that one DHCP\n\n220\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.720\nserver that we need to actually make sure\nthat everything is actually working.\n\n221\n00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.600\n>> All right, there we go Ronnie.\n\n222\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.900\nLooks like that window went away.\n\n223\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.510\nSo I'll go ahead and\nclose my Control Panel.\n\n224\n00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.889\nAnd now when I go to my Start menu,\nyou see I've got a new program.\n\n225\n00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:55.571\n[CROSSTALK] Windows 7 likes to\nhighlight those new programs.\n\n226\n00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:58.270\nI'll go to All Programs so\nwe can see them all.\n\n227\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.670\nAnd now Administrative Tools has\nthat special highlighted color.\n\n228\n00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.590\nThere's my DHCP console.\n\n229\n00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.560\nThere's my DNS console.\n\n230\n00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.640\nThere's Group Policy Management,\nas well as, let me see my.\n\n231\n00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.322\nMy Active Directory doesn't\nseem to have shown up.\n\n232\n00:11:13.322 --> 00:11:15.060\n> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe I did not check that box like\n\n233\n00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.430\nI thought I did.\n\n234\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.070\nSo we've got a few different\nones we can work with.\n\n235\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.130\nSo if I wanna open up say, DNS.\n\n236\n00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.990\nI'll go ahead and click on that,\n\n237\n00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:27.090\nand it says, Mike,\nyou're not running DNS on this machine.\n\n238\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.590\nThat's okay, I want to manage DNS\non the following computer, and\n\n239\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.590\nI can put in the name of my DNS server,\n\n240\n00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.270\ntell it to connect to the specified\nserver now, click OK, And there we go.\n\n241\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.220\nJust like if I was sitting on\nthe machine that's actually running DNS,\n\n242\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.650\nhere's my DNS console.\n\n243\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.000\nI can expand all this out.\n\n244\n00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.340\nI can look at my forward and\nreverse look-up zones.\n\n245\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.840\nI mean, you really are, basically Sitting\nat that DNS server at this point,\n\n246\n00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.630\nthis tool is reaching across the network,\ntalking to that DNS server, and\n\n247\n00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.910\npulling all this information back,\nso if I wanted to make a new record,\n\n248\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.220\nI can come in here and\ncreate a new A record, all right?\n\n249\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:11.530\nGive it an IP address, something\nlike that, and add host, all right?\n\n250\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:16.220\nSo I'm able to make new records I\ncan create new zones from here.\n\n251\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.070\nI can back up my DNS server,\nI can work with my reverse lookup zone.\n\n252\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.660\nI can work with the properties\nof that DNS server itself.\n\n253\n00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.550\nSo if I want to configure some forwarders,\nor work with my root hints or\n\n254\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.650\nwhat have you All right here,\njust like I was at the machine.\n\n255\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.800\nYet I don't have the entire desktop,\nright?\n\n256\n00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.550\nI can't see what else is running\non that server because that\n\n257\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.430\nmachine is actually a domain controller.\n\n258\n00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.830\nBut I don't see access to active\ndirectory or anything like that.\n\n259\n00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.500\nAll I get is DNS at this point.\n\n260\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.670\n>> It really seems like\none of the best ways for\n\n261\n00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.670\nus to manage it without having to actually\nmake sure that, at the end of the day,\n\n262\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.072\nI forgot to close out of\nmy remote desktop session.\n\n263\n00:12:54.072 --> 00:12:55.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or left it connected, and\n\n264\n00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.180\nnow somebody can't get connected back in,\nor modifying something that we're not\n\n265\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.430\nsupposed to when we're in the middle\n>> I'm actually connecting through that\n\n266\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.000\nremote desktop as well.\n\n267\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.740\nSo these tools are actually a big part of\n\n268\n00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.420\nwhat we can do with Windows 7 to be\nable to manage our entire network.\n\n269\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:16.260\nSo now our Windows 7 workstation\nis not just about us making.\n\n270\n00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.640\nExcel spreadsheets, Word documents and\nbeing able to sit down at a computer and\n\n271\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.840\nbrowse but now it is actually fairly\nnice administration console for\n\n272\n00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.730\nus that really is pinpointed in on\nthese services That we really need.\n\n273\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.800\nAnd so one of the services that we're\nreally going to zoom in on a lot of times\n\n274\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.300\nis going to be things like group policy.\n\n275\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.670\nIf there's anything that we're managing,\nit's usually group policy, especially when\n\n276\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.660\nthings start going wrong And so\nyou actually see that inside of that,\n\n277\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.910\nit is opening up the same thing you would\ndo on that management console right there.\n\n278\n00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.120\n>> So we go back over to my machine.\n\n279\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.422\nI go ahead and somehow I uncheck\nthe active directory tool.\n\n280\n00:13:51.422 --> 00:13:53.711\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm adding those guys again.\n\n281\n00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:56.820\nBut in the meantime, if we come\nover to administrative tools And\n\n282\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.580\nI can go to my group policy management.\n\n283\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.475\nShould open up that tool.\n\n284\n00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:03.070\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n285\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.070\n>> It's a little slow.\n\n286\n00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.620\nIt's doing a little bit in the background\nthere, so I won't complain too much.\n\n287\n00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.820\nGive them a break.\n\n288\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:14.100\nSo, right now it's reaching out\ntrying to find my domain controller.\n\n289\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.880\nWhere I can edit my group policy.\n\n290\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.960\nAnd there we go.\n\n291\n00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.970\nGroup policy management.\n\n292\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.370\nI can expand out forest.\n\n293\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.340\nI can expand out domains.\n\n294\n00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.850\nI can expand out my land.net.\n\n295\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.390\nThat's my little test domain here.\n\n296\n00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.034\nAnd theres my different GPOs-\n>> Nice.\n\n297\n00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:28.520\n>> That I've created.\n\n298\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.545\nAnd I can create new GPOs.\n\n299\n00:14:30.545 --> 00:14:32.935\nI could edit existing GPO's.\n\n300\n00:14:32.935 --> 00:14:34.765\nI could do whatever I needed to do.\n\n301\n00:14:34.765 --> 00:14:38.595\nJust like I was remoted into\nthat domain controller and\n\n302\n00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:42.205\nwent into server manager and opened up\nthe group policy management console.\n\n303\n00:14:42.205 --> 00:14:45.795\nThere's really no difference except I'm\nsitting at my own desk with my own coffee\n\n304\n00:14:45.795 --> 00:14:50.640\ncup and my air conditioning, and I've\ngot my headphones on And I'm good to go.\n\n305\n00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.130\nNow what's really cool about that, and\n\n306\n00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.580\nI think the Active Directory\none finished as well.\n\n307\n00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.090\nWe're gonna take a look at that\ngroup policy one in future episodes.\n\n308\n00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.430\nWe're gonna talk about\nthose domain policies.\n\n309\n00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:05.020\nBut the other thing I really\nlike about installing R sack,\n\n310\n00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.900\ngetting access to the remote server admin\ntools Not only do I have the consoles,\n\n311\n00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.070\nas we've seen here, and I can pick and\nchooses which consoles I want.\n\n312\n00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.390\nI can now make my own custom consoles,\nright.\n\n313\n00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.140\nIf I go down to my start menu and\n\n314\n00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.735\ntype in MMC, and open up One of\nthose Microsoft Management Consoles.\n\n315\n00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:26.025\none of my favorite little guys here.\n\n316\n00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:30.415\nWhen I go to add and remove a snap-in,\n\n317\n00:15:30.415 --> 00:15:34.926\nI will actually see that I now\nhave the ability to DNS snap-in,\n\n318\n00:15:34.926 --> 00:15:38.725\nDHCP snap-in, my group policy.\n\n319\n00:15:38.725 --> 00:15:40.185\nWe saw in an earlier episode,\n\n320\n00:15:40.185 --> 00:15:45.590\nRonnie added Group Policy Management\nEditor to work with the local policies.\n\n321\n00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.560\nWell I can now work with\nmy domain-based policies.\n\n322\n00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.340\nI can do Group Policy Management.\n\n323\n00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.040\nSo I can still make my custom consoles\nlike I'm used to being able to do on\n\n324\n00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.070\nmy server.\n\n325\n00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.850\nCuz I don't wanna have to open up DNS.\n\n326\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.499\nIf my job is to manage DNS and\nDHCP and group policy, or\n\n327\n00:16:02.499 --> 00:16:06.000\nif I'm in a small shop Typically it's us,\nright?\n\n328\n00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.765\nI got many different hats that i have\nto switch back and forth between and\n\n329\n00:16:09.765 --> 00:16:13.930\nI just have to keep opening one tool\nclose it, open up another tool, close it.\n\n330\n00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.840\nFor example,\n\n331\n00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.050\nwhere I used to work, when I remoted into\nthose servers there was typically four\n\n332\n00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.610\nthings I was doing It was either something\nwrong in Active Directory Users and\n\n333\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.250\nComputers, there was something\nwrong with Group Policy,\n\n334\n00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.110\nthere was something wrong with DNS, or\nthere was something wrong with DHCP.\n\n335\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.650\nWell that was four separate\ntools that I'd have to open up.\n\n336\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.480\nWhat I did was I created my own MMC and\nI added that DHCP snap in.\n\n337\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.300\nAnd, evidently, I added it twice,\ncause my mouse is messing up.\n\n338\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.600\nAnd I can add the DNS snap-in.\n\n339\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.790\nI've already added group\npolicy management.\n\n340\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.170\nI can come up here and\nadd active directory uses the computer.\n\n341\n00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.990\nSo I added these all to the same console,\nclicked OK.\n\n342\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.850\nAnd it's going to go out there and\nit's going to add them.\n\n343\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.860\nSo now, I've got group policy right\nhere and I could expand my way down and\n\n344\n00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.430\nI could work with my domain\nbased group policies.\n\n345\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.080\nBut I also have access to DHCP.\n\n346\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.440\nAnd I'm going to have to add my server.\n\n347\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.600\nThis is the first time I've used it,\nso it says well you not running DHCP.\n\n348\n00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.647\nI'll click Add Server, and it's found,\n\n349\n00:17:21.647 --> 00:17:27.282\nthe only DHCP server I have on\nthe network, so I'll add it.\n\n350\n00:17:27.282 --> 00:17:28.242\n>> Maybe.\n[LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:17:28.242 --> 00:17:28.862\n>> Give it a second.\n\n352\n00:17:28.862 --> 00:17:29.452\nYeah, right?\n\n353\n00:17:29.452 --> 00:17:31.580\nMake sure I'm in that\nDHCP admin's group and\n\n354\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.820\nI have permissions to\nmanage that DHCP server.\n\n355\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.770\nAnd there we go.\n\n356\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.870\nNow, I can manage DHCP and\nI can work with my existing scope.\n\n357\n00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.840\nI could make new scopes.\n\n358\n00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.780\nAnything I wanna do.\n\n359\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.970\nI've got my DNS added here.\n\n360\n00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.760\nSame thing.\nI'm gonna add that DC01.\n\n361\n00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:54.850\nAnd click OK, and there is my DNS, and\nthen active Directory Users and computers.\n\n362\n00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.610\nWell, it's going to reach out and\ntalk to the network.\n\n363\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.430\nIt can find that on its own.\n\n364\n00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.180\nIt found a domain controller and\nthere we go.\n\n365\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.740\nI can see all my different OUs, I can work\nwith user accounts, computer accounts.\n\n366\n00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.490\nWhatever I need to do.\n\n367\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.342\nOnce I've added all these snap ins,\n\n368\n00:18:10.342 --> 00:18:14.120\nthe only thing left to do\nis to save this console.\n\n369\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.291\nNow you noticed I collapsed everything up,\n\n370\n00:18:17.291 --> 00:18:22.100\nthe console will actually save\nyour view or your state, exactly.\n\n371\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.110\nSo I kinda collapse things\nup before I save it.\n\n372\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:28.075\nSo I'm just gonna do File > Save.\n\n373\n00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:30.630\nAnd you want to be\ncareful with this option,\n\n374\n00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.850\nI'll show you guys a trick here, or\na caveat might be a better word for it.\n\n375\n00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.700\nIt says Administrative Tools, right?\n\n376\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.320\nRight, fantastic, I'm gonna go and\ngive this guy a name.\n\n377\n00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.450\nI'm gonna call him My Admin Console.\n\n378\n00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.490\nAll right.\n\n379\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.990\nAnd I'll click Save.\n\n380\n00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.625\nAnd then once I save that,\nI'm gonna go ahead and,\n\n381\n00:18:53.625 --> 00:18:57.610\nI'm just gonna minimize it for\na second how about that.\n\n382\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.740\nI'm gonna minimize it,\nbecause I know what's gonna happen.\n\n383\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.450\nAll right now I'm gonna go to\nmy Start > Administrative Tools.\n\n384\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.320\nAnd I don't see my custom console there,\nright?\n\n385\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.070\nIt was called My Admin Tools,\nI don't see it.\n\n386\n00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.500\nAnd a lot of people start panicking at\nthis point, going, where the heck is this?\n\n387\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.500\nI just created it, I just saved it,\nit said administrative tools, and\n\n388\n00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.480\nit's not there.\n\n389\n00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.210\nSo, they'll go save it again and\nit's still not going to be there.\n\n390\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.640\nIf I go to all programs,\nAdministrative tools.\n\n391\n00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.120\nThere's my admin console, right?\n\n392\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.490\nSo there's a difference\nbetween administrative tools.\n\n393\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.016\nThe administrative tools\non your start menu sidebar\n\n394\n00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:38.470\nhere that's coming from\nthe All User's profile.\n\n395\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.950\nThe one when you saved it,\nif we take a look,\n\n396\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.840\nif we look a little closet, file saved.\n\n397\n00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.660\nAnd I have to do a save as\nsince I already saved it once.\n\n398\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.040\nFile > Save As.\n\n399\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.940\nAdministrative tools, but check this out.\n\n400\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.530\nYou see where it's buried.\n\n401\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:00.180\nIt's under my profile, app data,\nroaming, Microsoft Windows Start menu.\n\n402\n00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.720\nIt's specific to my user account.\n\n403\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.290\nIf somebody else logged in to this\nmachine, they wouldn't see that console,\n\n404\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.380\nwhich makes sense.\n\n405\n00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.250\nI don't want them to.\n\n406\n00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.570\nThey might not have\nthe same permissions as me.\n\n407\n00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:11.320\nJust be aware of that.\n\n408\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.440\nWhen you go to Save it and then you go\nback to your start menu on Windows 7.\n\n409\n00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.770\nYou're not going to see it under\nthis administrative tools.\n\n410\n00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.620\nNow you could choose to put\nit there if you wanted to,\n\n411\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.650\nyou could change that save location.\n\n412\n00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.370\nI could browse and find the all\nuser start menu and dump it there.\n\n413\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.650\nSo just keep that in mind when you\nsave it It might not be exactly\n\n414\n00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:30.910\nwhere you think it is.\n\n415\n00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.260\nSo at this point it's saved.\n\n416\n00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.250\nIf I close it and\nI come in the next day, and\n\n417\n00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.170\nsomebody says, hey there's a problem\nwith my user account, well shoot,\n\n418\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:42.030\nI'm just going into my administrative\ntools and my admin console.\n\n419\n00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.540\nI open it up and it should be good to go.\n\n420\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.240\nAnd it should remember all\nthose servers as well.\n\n421\n00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.450\nI don't have to go in and\nadd my DHTP server again.\n\n422\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.420\nEach time or anything like that.\n\n423\n00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:54.940\nIf we added another server.\n\n424\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.840\nLet's say I'm responsible for\nmore than one GHEP server or\n\n425\n00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.190\nmore than one DNS server I can\nalways additional servers as well.\n\n426\n00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.910\nI only have one in this lab so\nI can't really show you that but\n\n427\n00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.650\nyou could add additional\nservers if you wanted to.\n\n428\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:14.600\nAnother handy thing to do is to\npin that guy to your start menu.\n\n429\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.920\nI mean, to your desktop.\n\n430\n00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.160\nI always like to dump it out here.\n\n431\n00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.330\nSo I can just right click on that and\nlet's pin it to the taskbar.\n\n432\n00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.610\nMaybe something like that.\n\n433\n00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.110\nOr there's my share, too.\n\n434\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.000\nI wanna send it to the desktop,\ncreate a shortcut.\n\n435\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.640\nAnd there we go.\n\n436\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.473\nNow I don't have to fool with the Start\nmenu, I can just go right there,\n\n437\n00:21:32.473 --> 00:21:34.190\ndouble-click on it, and I'm good to go.\n\n438\n00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.222\n>> Yeah, it seems a more intuitive way,\n\n439\n00:21:36.222 --> 00:21:39.410\nespecially if you're not used\nto the server environment.\n\n440\n00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.883\nYou can still manage those different\nelements of what we'll normally have\n\n441\n00:21:42.883 --> 00:21:46.467\ninside of an active directory domain\nwithout having to navigate through that\n\n442\n00:21:46.467 --> 00:21:47.530\nserver environment.\n\n443\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.360\nAnd most of you might be thinking when\nwould I not be familiar with that?\n\n444\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.222\nBut remember, you may have administrators\nthat are only specific to those elements,\n\n445\n00:21:55.222 --> 00:21:59.160\nwhether it's DNS, or whether it's DHCP or\neven just a group policy.\n\n446\n00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.000\nAnd you really don't want them\nactually going out to do that,\n\n447\n00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.880\nhere's an easy way to give them access.\n\n448\n00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.345\nIt's actually a better way because it\nmeans that they're not now actually just\n\n449\n00:22:07.345 --> 00:22:10.653\npoking their head around and going oh I\nwonder if I make this little check mark\n\n450\n00:22:10.653 --> 00:22:12.950\nand then check this,\nis it gonna affect something?\n\n451\n00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.450\nWell, yeah, yes it is.\n\n452\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.190\nSo it's a great tool for\nus to actually be familiar with.\n\n453\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.200\n>> It really is.\n\n454\n00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.507\nIt make administering those remote\nservers a lot easier in my opinion,\n\n455\n00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:25.470\nand as Ronnie said it's\nreally one of the steps.\n\n456\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:29.130\nWhen we talk about security we always talk\nabout the principle of least privilege.\n\n457\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.640\nI don't want to give somebody\nmore permissions then they need.\n\n458\n00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.691\nI'm not trying to be cruel and\nlock them down and\n\n459\n00:22:33.691 --> 00:22:35.240\nprevent them from doing their job.\n\n460\n00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.350\nBut I also don't want them accidentally or\nmaliciously going beyond what their\n\n461\n00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:43.045\njob level entails, so I don't want\nto give them too many permissions.\n\n462\n00:22:43.045 --> 00:22:44.656\nYou don't just make them an admin,\n\n463\n00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:47.565\nyou don't just give them remote\ndesktop access to that server.\n\n464\n00:22:47.565 --> 00:22:50.285\nYou give them what they need to\ndo their job and nothing more.\n\n465\n00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:52.325\nAnd that's what RSAT allows me to do.\n\n466\n00:22:52.325 --> 00:22:54.445\n>> That's a cool utility, I like it.\n\n467\n00:22:54.445 --> 00:22:57.095\n>> All right, Ronnie, well can you think\nof anything else that we might have\n\n468\n00:22:57.095 --> 00:22:58.612\nmissed on the remote server admin tools?\n\n469\n00:22:58.612 --> 00:23:01.812\n>> No, just looking forward to some of\nthe different ways that we'll actually\n\n470\n00:23:01.812 --> 00:23:02.362\nbe using it.\n\n471\n00:23:02.362 --> 00:23:05.404\nAnd that way helping us to focus in\nmore on what we need to be doing which,\n\n472\n00:23:05.404 --> 00:23:06.990\nof course, is promoting Window 7.\n\n473\n00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.990\nSo it's a great tool.\n\n474\n00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.780\n>> Fantastic.\n\n475\n00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.610\nAll right, well we hope you guys\nguys enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n476\n00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.780\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n477\n00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.570\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n478\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.990\n>> And

and\n\n3\n00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:16.890\nwith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.680\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.470\n>> I am doing well today.\n\n6\n00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.460\nIt's another hot and\nsunny day here in Florida.\n\n7\n00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.860\nAnd that means it's time to get\ninto the air conditioning and\n\n8\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.150\nbegin to take a look at\nsupporting Windows 7.\n\n9\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.301\nThat's what it means to me.\n\n10\n00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:29.497\n>> [LAUGH] I like it, I like it.\n\n11\n00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:32.060\nIt is definitely\na sweltering day out there.\n\n12\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.240\nSo, today we're gonna continue on with\nsome of our remote management concepts, or\n\n13\n00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.780\nremote administration.\n\n14\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.190\nIn a previous episode, we took a look\nat the remote server admin tools,\n\n15\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.240\nwhich is a download that\nyou can get from Microsoft.\n\n16\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.490\nAnd in environments, in large\nenvironments where you're delegating out.\n\n17\n00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.450\nCertain responsibilities\nto certain people,\n\n18\n00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.020\nlike you might have a DNS admin or\na DHCP admin or\n\n19\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.360\nsomething like that where they're\nonly responsible for a small slice.\n\n20\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.310\nYou can get those remote\nserver admin tools,\n\n21\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.400\nyou can install them on their machine, you\ncan give them just the console they need.\n\n22\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.280\nThat way, they can manage DNS\nfrom their Windows 7 box,\n\n23\n00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.790\nthey don't need access to the server\ncloset, they don't need to be made\n\n24\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.120\nan administrator on the actual server,\nthey don't need to\n\n25\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.240\nbe able to remote desktop into it,\nthey can manage DNS from right there.\n\n26\n00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.830\nSo that's a good solution\nIn certain scenarios.\n\n27\n00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.080\nTypically when you have big scenarios and\ndifferent people have\n\n28\n00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.970\ndifferent responsibilities, but\nthat's not always the case, right Ronnie?\n\n29\n00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.470\n>> That's true.\n\n30\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.080\nA lot of times you actually do need\na little bit more or a little bit less\n\n31\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.180\nDepending on what type of access you\nneed as a support technician, or\n\n32\n00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.450\na support administrator, to be able\nto manage the different systems.\n\n33\n00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.360\nSo what we want to do is to take a look\nat some of the other remote options\n\n34\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.760\nthat we have to make\nsure that we can do so.\n\n35\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.150\nWe're specifically taking a look at what\nwe call remote assistance And also talking\n\n36\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.600\nabout using the remote desktop connection\nto help us to be able to do that as well.\n\n37\n00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.240\nNow you might be wondering\nwhat are the both about.\n\n38\n00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.430\nWell hopefully you've\nheard of the term remote,\n\n39\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.190\nwhich means you don't have to go to that\nperson's workstation or that server.\n\n40\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.390\nTo be able to do some of the different\nthings that you need to do to help and\n\n41\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.930\nsupport, or\nto help do some administration.\n\n42\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.240\nA lot of times, some of the stuff that we\ncan do, even though it might require some\n\n43\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.900\npresence, we might actually be\nable to sit at our desk And\n\n44\n00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.220\nmake the connections that we need to\ndirectly from our desk, either to take\n\n45\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.660\nover control of that computer, or\nwe can actually share the desktop.\n\n46\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.850\nAnd have the user really point\nout what the trouble might be and\n\n47\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.290\nbe able to actually have that interaction\nwith that user to help that support.\n\n48\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.220\nAnd so we specifically wanna take\na look at both of those, something we\n\n49\n00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.405\ncan actually do inside of Windows 7\nwithout really having to pray, pay.\n\n50\n00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:45.580\n>> [LAUGH] Sometimes we are praying.\n\n51\n00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.200\n>> Yeah,\nsometimes you do have to actually pray.\n\n52\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.740\nBut without having to pay for\nan additional service to help you do that.\n\n53\n00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.070\nAnd it's all built into\nthe operating system.\n\n54\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.870\nAnd so\nit's actually a really nice feature.\n\n55\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.380\n>> It really it.\n\n56\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.540\nSo I think we'll start a little\nbit with remote desktop.\n\n57\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.130\nAnd this is a concept probably\nyou're familiar with.\n\n58\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.060\nYou've heard the term.\n\n59\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.340\nYou know what remote desktop means,\nI'm gonna remote into a machine that's\n\n60\n00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.320\nNot in front of me, and I'm gonna\nbring its desktop back to my screen.\n\n61\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.720\nSo I'm actually gonna, it's almost\nlike I was sitting at the machine, but\n\n62\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.490\neverything's being sent\nacross the network.\n\n63\n00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.140\nThat machine might be in the office next\nto me, it might be a server in the server\n\n64\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.360\ncloset, it might be one of my\nsalespersons' laptops that's remote for\n\n65\n00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.900\nme in another office.\n\n66\n00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.570\nOr somewhere else.\n\n67\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.600\nBut remote desktop means you're\ngonna take that remote desktop and\n\n68\n00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.960\nbring it back to you.\n\n69\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.800\nAnd you get to see.\n\n70\n00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.040\nBasically you're looking at that desktop.\n\n71\n00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.700\nSo everything.\n\n72\n00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.880\nThe Start menu.\n\n73\n00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.430\nAll the applications\nthat are on that machine.\n\n74\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.160\nEverything is going to\nbe available to you.\n\n75\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.200\nAnd this is a good solution.\n\n76\n00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.660\nI see it used in help desks a lot, when\nsomebody calls you up and they need you to\n\n77\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.530\nlook at their computer, see what's wrong,\nassuming they have network connectivity.\n\n78\n00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.720\nIf it's a network connectivity issue,\n\n79\n00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.840\nI can't really remote desktop into it,\nright?\n\n80\n00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.090\nBut also used for\nserver administrations sometimes.\n\n81\n00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.180\nIn smaller shops where I'm not just\nthe DNS admin, I'm everything.\n\n82\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.960\nWell maybe I just remote desktop into it,\ninstead of using one of those snap ins,\n\n83\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.500\nbecause that way I get\naccess to the entire server.\n\n84\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.940\n>> This is by far the most intuitive way\nthat you and I actually know how to work\n\n85\n00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.100\nwith a computer, and we been\nsitting at a Windows seven desktop.\n\n86\n00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.750\nStop.\n\n87\n00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.980\nIt's easy to actually make that remote\ndesktop connection, and you're like oh,\n\n88\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.130\nlook, it just looks like\na regular computer.\n\n89\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.990\nAnd you work with it just like\nyou are on your computer.\n\n90\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.720\nThere's really not a lot of special\ntechniques that you have to use.\n\n91\n00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.770\nYou will experience some\nperformance degradation of\n\n92\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.890\ncourse especially if you go\nacross slow types of links.\n\n93\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.780\nAs your going across the Internet you\nmay actually run into a little bit\n\n94\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.050\nof issues but there are some things you\ncan do to actually adjust that type of\n\n95\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.230\nconnection as well.\n\n96\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.950\nThe best thing for us to do right now is\nto show you what we are talking about if\n\n97\n00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.860\nyou haven't actually\nexperienced this before.\n\n98\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.080\nSo when we start talking about\nusing the remote desk top Top\n\n99\n00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.120\nconnection to allow us to\ndo what we need to do.\n\n100\n00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.700\nWe first of all actually need to make\nsure that we have access to that\n\n101\n00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.230\nremote machine.\n\n102\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.380\nAnd then we need to verify that our\nuser account's on that machine, or\n\n103\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.200\nif we're part of an active\ndirectory network,\n\n104\n00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.940\nthat we're actually allowed to be\nable to use this remote desktop.\n\n105\n00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.070\nTo connect in, right.\n\n106\n00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.640\n>> Absolutely.\n\n107\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.120\nSo again, as Ronnie said,\nnetwork connectivity obviously is a must\n\n108\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.650\nbecause I'm connecting across\nthe network to that machine.\n\n109\n00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.100\nAnd then permissions\nare gonna be necessary.\n\n110\n00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.090\nEvery Windows machine has a local group\ncalled the Remote Desktop Users Group, and\n\n111\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.750\nthat controls who's allowed to make\nthat remote desktop connection.\n\n112\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.650\nSo my user account Needs to be in that\n\n113\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.890\nlocal group on the machine\nthat I'm remoting into.\n\n114\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.790\nOr, as Ronnie said, one of the groups\nI belong to, like the, whomever.\n\n115\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.710\nMaybe the IT security group or\nhelp desk one, or what have you.\n\n116\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.190\nIf that group's in that Remote Desktop\ngroup, then we're good to go.\n\n117\n00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.330\n>> So let's go ahead and\nshow you what we're talking about here and\n\n118\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.270\nmake sure that we understand how\nwe're gonna get connected as well.\n\n119\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.110\nSo on my machine I've got my technician\nmachine 01 laid right here and\n\n120\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.350\nready for us to go, and\nif I was setting this up So that,\n\n121\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.140\nlet's say that later on in the future I'm\ngonna be connecting here, I need to go and\n\n122\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.930\nverify I have the proper connection up and\nopen.\n\n123\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.760\nSo the way that we do that is if I click\non the start button in the lower left hand\n\n124\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.230\ncorner of the screen.\n\n125\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.820\nI can go to computer and\nI right click, and go to properties.\n\n126\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.660\nAnd once I'm actually inside\nof the system window,\n\n127\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.730\nover on the left hand side, I'm looking\nfor the option that says Remote settings.\n\n128\n00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.190\nSo if I select Remote settings,\n\n129\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.790\nI will of course bring up\nthe System Properties window,\n\n130\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.040\nwith the focus in on the Remote tab And\nnotice that I have two different options.\n\n131\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.090\nWe're gonna go over both, but\n\n132\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.700\nright now we're gonna focus in on\nthe Remote Desktop settings for right now.\n\n133\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.090\nAnd by default, if I were to try and\nconnect to this machine remotely,\n\n134\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.500\nit actually says,\ndon't allow connections to this computer.\n\n135\n00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.870\nAnd that's normally the default\non most workstations.\n\n136\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.610\nStations when actually\nwhen you install it.\n\n137\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.830\nI think even on servers,\nactually the default if I think about it\n\n138\n00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.630\nnow that I take a look, but a lot of times\nwhen I'm actually creating a new server,\n\n139\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.350\nthis is one of the first couple\nof things that I open up.\n\n140\n00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.330\nCuz I don't wanna be in that sorta\ncloset any longer than I have to because\n\n141\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.910\nit is loud in there and it gets warm very\nquickly when you're actually in there.\n\n142\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.070\nSo, yes you can change these\nto one of these two options.\n\n143\n00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.230\nNow, on these two options,\n\n144\n00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.780\nthis is where you do have to make\nthe selection depending on what you're\n\n145\n00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.460\nactually going to be comfortable\nwith in your security settings.\n\n146\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.790\nNotice it says to allow connections\nfrom a computer running any version\n\n147\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.710\nof remote desktop or\nallow connections from computers\n\n148\n00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.270\nrunning remote desktop with\nnetwork level authentication.\n\n149\n00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.410\nNow, Mike Is there really a need for\nme to do this middle one,\n\n150\n00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.720\ninstead of this bottom one?\n\n151\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.260\n>> Well, if you're going to use an XP work\nstation to connect to this Windows 7.\n\n152\n00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.320\nMaybe for some reason,\non your help desk machine,\n\n153\n00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.610\nyour technician machine you are running\non Windows XP, because there are programs\n\n154\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.340\nthat you just have no been able to work\none Windows 7, or something like that.\n\n155\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.940\nIf you try to go from an XP machine\ninto that Windows 7 machine,\n\n156\n00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.830\nyou're gonna choose that middle option\nbecause Windows XP doesn't support\n\n157\n00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.660\nnetwork level authentication.\n\n158\n00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.383\nBut if I don't have to worry about\nany of those down level clients,\n\n159\n00:08:02.383 --> 00:08:05.643\nI definitely want to choose that second or\nthat third option in that list there,\n\n160\n00:08:05.643 --> 00:08:07.852\nwhich would be to use\nnetwork level authentication.\n\n161\n00:08:07.852 --> 00:08:09.795\nVista and later Are gonna support that and\n\n162\n00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:13.684\nit's just gonna give me an extra level of\nauthentication making sure that it trusts\n\n163\n00:08:13.684 --> 00:08:17.560\nthe computer that's coming in to\nmake that remote desktop connection.\n\n164\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.150\n>> Right so\n\n165\n00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.520\nif you no that at all times you're\ngonna be using from a remote machine.\n\n166\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.100\nEither Vista or Windows 7 then go ahead\nand chooses their option and it's nice.\n\n167\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.990\nIt actually says more secure so that's\nwhy you should choose it but if there is\n\n168\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.740\na chance that you know at some point that\nyou don't know what computer you're going\n\n169\n00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.310\nto be connecting in with Well you might\nactually choose this one instead.\n\n170\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.860\nSo, it actually just depends on what\nyou are actually going to do, and\n\n171\n00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.610\nwhat you feel comfortable doing, as well.\n\n172\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.700\n>> Could be another operating system\nthat you are using on your machine,and\n\n173\n00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.580\nmaybe it doesn't support that level\nof authentication even though it is\n\n174\n00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.205\na later version of the OS, so\nit all depends on what you are using.\n\n175\n00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:58.400\n>> And the option that we get kinda of\nstopped by, is this button right here.\n\n176\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.390\nThat says to select users.\n\n177\n00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.300\nIf I go ahead and\nclick There the notice actually tells me,\n\n178\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.640\nhey the users listed below can\nconnect to this computer and\n\n179\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.610\nany member of administrators group can\nconnect even if they aren't listed.\n\n180\n00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.130\nSo notice actually tells you\nthe administrator already has access.\n\n181\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.390\nIn other words I don't have to add\nmyself in here while I am actually\n\n182\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.990\nthe administrator of this computer.\n\n183\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.960\nIf I wanted to add another individual\nto be able to gain access in,\n\n184\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.080\nI would click on the add button.\n\n185\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.380\nAnd then I would type in that username,\nand I have a couple of them here.\n\n186\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.300\nSo I'm just going to add myself in there.\n\n187\n00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.880\nRonald as another account.\n\n188\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.920\nOh maybe not.\n\n189\n00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.990\nI thought another account that\nactually created in there.\n\n190\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.780\nOn this machine it may not be in there.\n\n191\n00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.620\nIt may actually be in the other one.\n\n192\n00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.750\nLet's see if I can find the other user.\n\n193\n00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.040\nNope, I actually did not\ncreate that on this machine.\n\n194\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.570\n>> Eh, you can make a group or\nsomething maybe.\n\n195\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.170\n>> Yeah, I can actually add in\na group here to be able to do that.\n\n196\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.200\nMaybe.\n\n197\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.840\nLet me select find.\n\n198\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.060\nNow, who are we going to add in Mike?\n\n199\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.300\n>> Eh, I don't know.\n\n200\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.139\nUsers is one.\n\n201\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.070\nNormally you would have, like in a domain\nenvironment you have a domain group called\n\n202\n00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.900\nhelpdesk or something like that, and\nyou would add them to that list.\n\n203\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.560\nThat way anybody you added to the helpdesk\ngroup would be in the remote desktop\n\n204\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.281\nusers\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n205\n00:10:13.281 --> 00:10:14.458\n>> group on all those machines.\n\n206\n00:10:14.458 --> 00:10:17.476\nSo we don't have to actually have one,\nas long as they see where to do that.\n\n207\n00:10:17.476 --> 00:10:20.920\nAnd by default, as they showed you\nThe built in administrators group on that\n\n208\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.450\nmachine automatically, they're already\nin the remote desktop users group.\n\n209\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.680\nSo we don't have to add\nthem a second time.\n\n210\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.110\nYou don't have to use that window either.\n\n211\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.800\nYou could go to computer management,\nand then local users and groups,\n\n212\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.050\nand then go down to.\n\n213\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.690\nLocal groups, and you can actually\nsee the remote desktops user's group.\n\n214\n00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.990\nAnd you could add people there as well.\n\n215\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.340\nSo either way is gonna work just fine\nas long as you're in the Admin's group,\n\n216\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:44.890\nyou're good to go.\n\n217\n00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:45.750\n>> Yeah.\nI went ahead and\n\n218\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.430\nswitched on over to the second machine\nwhere I did create the extra accounts.\n\n219\n00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.200\nAnd so this is the identical setup and\nwe're on Tech02 now.\n\n220\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.200\nAnd I went and\nadded Nathan into this group.\n\n221\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.880\nSo that way, he can actually go ahead and\n\n222\n00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.500\nactually use Remote Desktop if he\nneeded to from another machine instead.\n\n223\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.930\nSo he was added in here.\n\n224\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.820\nI'm gonna click OK.\n\n225\n00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.130\nAnd then go ahead and\nclick apply, and click ok again.\n\n226\n00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.760\nAnd once we have that,\nwhat that should do, of course,\n\n227\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.740\nis allow that connection to come through.\n\n228\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.330\nAnd, more importantly,\nit also sets the firewall rules up, so\n\n229\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.200\nthat we can use that remote desktop\nconnection to be able to connect then And\n\n230\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.470\nthat's usually on port 3389 is\nwhat it allows you to connect in.\n\n231\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.680\n>> So it's making that exception for\nyou on 3389.\n\n232\n00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.380\nAlso, keep in mind you want to trust\nwhoever you put in that group, because\n\n233\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.740\nonce you've added them to the group,\nthey can in fact connect to your machine.\n\n234\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.390\nOver the network they can even if you're\nnot logged into it they can connect just\n\n235\n00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:45.240\nfine, if you're logged into it they can\nremote in and try to kick you off and\n\n236\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.560\nwork on your machine, so make sure\nyou're putting trusted people in there.\n\n237\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.680\nTypically in most environments we wanna\nuse groups, not individual users as well,\n\n238\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.310\nthat's always the best practice so\nI can control who has access.\n\n239\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.510\nBy changing group membership and\n\n240\n00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.290\nnot having to go back\nthrough that dialogue box.\n\n241\n00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.520\n>> That's a great hint for\n\n242\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.410\nus, especially when we are working\na little bit larger situation here.\n\n243\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.420\nBut let's say that here it is.\n\n244\n00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.010\nHere's the machine that I want\nNathan to be able to actually\n\n245\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.810\nhave remote access into.\n\n246\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.320\nWell now that that's all set up, I just\nneed to connect in from another machine.\n\n247\n00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.380\nNow this is where some of the options\ncan change, depending on what you have.\n\n248\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.270\nSo, here on this Windows 7 machine on\nTechCo 1, I'm gonna click on start, and\n\n249\n00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:29.190\ngo to all programs, and inside of all\nprograms I'm going to select accessories,\n\n250\n00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.905\nI know that's a strange place to find it.\n\n251\n00:12:30.905 --> 00:12:32.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> But that's where you're gonna find it,\n\n252\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.370\nis inside of that accessories\nfolder all the time.\n\n253\n00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.530\nNow you might be wondering, well Ronnie,\nI saw it at the top of the list here.\n\n254\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.860\nThat just meant that I've actually\nused it before on this computer so\n\n255\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.760\nthat I could actually make the connection.\n\n256\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.180\nBut if you go, hey,\nI'm going to this machine and\n\n257\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.320\nI don't know exactly where it is.\n\n258\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.660\nClick on Start.\n\n259\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.050\nall programs and accessories and\nnotice right here.\n\n260\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.330\nThat is the one you're looking for.\n\n261\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.420\nit's what we call the remote\ndesktop connection.\n\n262\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.970\nSo if I select that and run it, it's\ngoing to open up that program for me and\n\n263\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.560\nit's gonna give me the options right here.\n\n264\n00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.860\nit doesn't look like a lot of\ndifferent options are available.\n\n265\n00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.470\nBut, there's more here then you realize so\nfirst and\n\n266\n00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:12.430\nforemost I do need the name of the\ncomputer that I'm gonna connect into and\n\n267\n00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.900\nI can also enter credentials in as well\nand you can see where I've actually\n\n268\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.570\nwent ahead and connected in one\ntime Using my credentials as well.\n\n269\n00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.250\nNow, if you're going like, well how do I\nget that setting, it doesn't look like I\n\n270\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:29.240\ncan type in there, in the lower left hand\ncorner notice we have this options button.\n\n271\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.950\nIf I select that you see where\nit actually expands out and\n\n272\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.770\nthere's a lot of options\nhere that we can set.\n\n273\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.400\nIf I wanted to, I could change it.\n\n274\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.610\nIf I knew that Nathan was actually\ngoing to be the one that was gonna\n\n275\n00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.850\nhave to remote into that machine\nmore often from this machine Well,\n\n276\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.610\nI would simply go ahead and change that.\n\n277\n00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.704\nI could go ahead and change it here.\n\n278\n00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:52.540\nAnd then I can allow the saving of\nthose credentials if I want to.\n\n279\n00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.180\nAnd then I could even save\nthis as a profile, and\n\n280\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.320\nthat way he can actually use this and set\na little desktop icon for him to do that.\n\n281\n00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.910\nNow notice that there's some Other things\nthat we can actually look at here, too.\n\n282\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.910\nThe display configurations, too.\n\n283\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.490\nIt says choose the size\nof the remote setting.\n\n284\n00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.080\nDrag the slider all the way to\nthe right to use the full screen.\n\n285\n00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.010\nYou want it a full screen?\n\n286\n00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.680\nOr, do you want it to appear as a window,\nwhen actually open it up?\n\n287\n00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.820\nSo, it might look like just another\napplication window on your desktop,\n\n288\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.920\nif you choose to.\n\n289\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.680\nAs well as the colors that\nyou want to come across.\n\n290\n00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.510\nDo you want true color?\n\n291\n00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.420\nDo you want tie color?\n\n292\n00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.330\nYou name it.\n\n293\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.880\nYou can actually set that up,\ntoo, right there.\n\n294\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.630\nSo, it actually depends on the connection\nyou have to the other machines.\n\n295\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.470\n>> Absolutely.\n\n296\n00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.740\nWhat we're starting to see is our ability\nto control if we're having bandwidth\n\n297\n00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.790\nlimitations, if we have\na congested network, or\n\n298\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.990\njust not a fast connection\nbetween the other end.\n\n299\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.790\nDropping that color depth down a little\nbit can lighten up the amount of data\n\n300\n00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.310\nthat's being sent across the network,\nthereby making my connection and that\n\n301\n00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:51.750\nmachine a little smoother, a little more\neasy to use, or a little less glitchy.\n\n302\n00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:55.520\nAnd I tell you, Ronnie, I love on that\nfirst screen that whole save and save as.\n\n303\n00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.720\nDo remember if you click save,\nyou're overriding the default RDP window.\n\n304\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.450\nSo every time you click on RDP,\nthose settings are gonna be populated.\n\n305\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.030\nI love that save as option.\n\n306\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.950\nI created a folder on my hard drive or\non my desktop.\n\n307\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.360\nAnd I go through here and I do a Save As,\nand I give it a name of whatever computer\n\n308\n00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.380\nit is so that it already has all my\nsettings that I need to remote into DC1.\n\n309\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.870\nThen I go back and\nI do another one for DNS1 and DNS2.\n\n310\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.770\nAnd so\nI've got little remote desktop icons With\n\n311\n00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.920\nthe names of the computers on them and I\ncan just double click on whichever one and\n\n312\n00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.850\nit already has the IP address of the\nmachine, the credentials I want to use,\n\n313\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.360\nthe color depth, the window size,\nall of that saved.\n\n314\n00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.720\nSo the save will overwrite\nthat current one.\n\n315\n00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.980\nSave As will let you create\nadditional ones which is pretty cool.\n\n316\n00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.190\n>> And the other thing I want to mention\nhere too now that we're going back to this\n\n317\n00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.140\n>> Cuz I kind of zipped through it here,\n\n318\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.750\nis the computer.\n\n319\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.490\nEven though I typed in the IP address,\nthat's because it's easy for me.\n\n320\n00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.120\nI knew what the IP address was.\n\n321\n00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.060\nWe can actually use DNS names\nto actually populate this too.\n\n322\n00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.630\nSo if you don't know what the IP addresses\nare and DNS is running on your network,\n\n323\n00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.110\nyou should actually be able to\nuse those names perfectly fine.\n\n324\n00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.820\nIt doesn't mean you have to go out and\nfind every IP address.\n\n325\n00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.617\n>> It was just easier for me to do this on\nthis too little machine network than to\n\n326\n00:16:03.617 --> 00:16:06.410\nnot having to worry about\nhaving to resolve the names.\n\n327\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.740\nSo I went in and\ntyped the IP address of that one.\n\n328\n00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.242\nSo we can change the way that the screen\nlooks on our end when we connect remotely.\n\n329\n00:16:13.242 --> 00:16:14.900\nAnd here's a neat feature too, let's see.\n\n330\n00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.014\n>> Yeah, I see that you have that\noption at the bottom there with\n\n331\n00:16:17.014 --> 00:16:17.890\nthe multiple monitors.\n\n332\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:18.532\nIs that-\n>> Let's\n\n333\n00:16:18.532 --> 00:16:19.066\nsee-\n>> Oh, no it's not on-\n\n334\n00:16:19.066 --> 00:16:19.719\n>> I do not have that\n\n335\n00:16:19.719 --> 00:16:20.610\noption for right now.\n\n336\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.940\n>> That's not Windows 7, I forget.\n\n337\n00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.636\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, no,\n\n338\n00:16:23.636 --> 00:16:24.850\nI don't have that option here.\n\n339\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.680\nBut this is kind of a neat option right\nhere, Mike, about local resources.\n\n340\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:35.069\nIf you're like me and you Remote Desktop\ninto someplace and you say, you know,\n\n341\n00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:40.410\nsomebody is calling you like, there's\na file that I need on that machine.\n\n342\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.150\nI can't gain access to it.\n\n343\n00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.620\nWell, what you can do is you can\nactually Remote Desktop into this thing.\n\n344\n00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:51.560\nAnd notice what it has as local devices\nand resources, Clipboard and Printers.\n\n345\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.390\nThis Printers one is actually\na nice saving grace.\n\n346\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.060\n>> Oh, that's fantastic.\n\n347\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.334\n>> Because, it means I can actually print\ndirectly to one of those printers, or\n\n348\n00:16:59.334 --> 00:17:02.292\nI can actually tell it from that machine,\nexcuse me,\n\n349\n00:17:02.292 --> 00:17:04.350\nto print to my printer on my network.\n\n350\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:07.330\nI was about to do it backwards,\nto be able to do that.\n\n351\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.430\nSo I can do that, if there's a file that's\nthere and I need it printed out, well, if\n\n352\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.600\nI hit Print over there, I think it might\nprint out on the printer on that network.\n\n353\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.420\nBut this actually allows\nme to print it to me.\n\n354\n00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.550\n>> Exactly, if you're remoting,\nit's something we forget all the time.\n\n355\n00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.810\nLet's say I'm remoting into Bob's computer\nover there in that office down in Tampa\n\n356\n00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.800\nand I'm sitting here in Gainesville.\n\n357\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.650\nYou're bringing Bob's\ndesktop to your screen.\n\n358\n00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.680\nIf you open up File Explorer,\nyou're looking at Bob's hard drives.\n\n359\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.857\nAnd I can't just drag and drop files\nfrom that Remote Desktop window onto\n\n360\n00:17:36.857 --> 00:17:39.460\nmy hard drive, it's not gonna allow that.\n\n361\n00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.150\nIf I click Print from Bob's screen,\nif I'm in his computer,\n\n362\n00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.400\nremoted in, and I try to print something,\nwell it's gonna use the printers that\n\n363\n00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.020\nare attached to Bob's machines, whatever\nprinters he's added to his machine.\n\n364\n00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.590\nI'm not in Tampa, I can't get that\nhard copy that I just printed out.\n\n365\n00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.510\nSo we bring local resources with us.\n\n366\n00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.620\nWe bring my printer,\n\n367\n00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:02.100\nthe one that's hooked up to my machine,\nwith me on that Remote Desktop connection.\n\n368\n00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.820\nI can bring my local drives with me\non that Remote Desktop connection.\n\n369\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.939\nAnd now, when I remote in,\n\n370\n00:18:07.939 --> 00:18:11.490\nI'm gonna have the option to print to\nthe printer that's here next to me.\n\n371\n00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.100\nAnd I'm gonna see all of those local\ndrives, the ones that are on my computer,\n\n372\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.290\nare gonna show up in Bob's Windows\nExplorer as mapped network drives.\n\n373\n00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:24.520\nSo now I can just copy files from his C\ndrive to the mapped version of my C drive.\n\n374\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.390\nSo I can move files, or vice versa, right?\n\n375\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.250\nSo now I can move files back and forth.\n\n376\n00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.150\nMaybe I got a driver that\nI've downloaded for him, and\n\n377\n00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.200\nI want him to install on his machine.\n\n378\n00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.070\nWell, instead of trying to email it\nto him I could Remote Desktop in,\n\n379\n00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.880\nbring my drives with me, and then just\ncopy the driver over to it and run it for\n\n380\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.220\nhim, right, cuz I'm on his machine.\n\n381\n00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.830\nSo clipboard as well, is another thing,\nUSB drives that you can plug in.\n\n382\n00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.220\n>> Yeah, if we take a look, we'll show you\nexactly what Mike's talking about here on\n\n383\n00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.830\nsome of the other resources\nthat we have available.\n\n384\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.130\nSo the only thing I did is I\nclicked on this More button, and\n\n385\n00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.210\nwhat that More button did is bring\nup another window for me, and\n\n386\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.830\nthis is other local devices and resources.\n\n387\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.675\nIf I was using smart cards\nI could actually do that,\n\n388\n00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:05.472\neven additional ports as well.\n\n389\n00:19:05.472 --> 00:19:08.614\nBut it's down here underneath\nthe Drives that we can also\n\n390\n00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:10.255\nconnect in to that computer.\n\n391\n00:19:10.255 --> 00:19:13.415\nSo if I select, let's say,\nmy local drive here.\n\n392\n00:19:13.415 --> 00:19:15.385\nSo let’s say I do have\nfiles on my hard drive,\n\n393\n00:19:15.385 --> 00:19:19.090\nand I wanna make sure that if I’m remoted\nin to that session on the other computer,\n\n394\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.890\nthat I can still gain access to\nmy hard drive from that side.\n\n395\n00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.310\nI can do that too.\n\n396\n00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.010\nAnd even, look,\nI can even do a shared folder.\n\n397\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.862\nSo if I have a shared folder on my side,\nbut I know that hey,\n\n398\n00:19:29.862 --> 00:19:33.720\nI still need to connect over there and\nget access to it, I can actually do that.\n\n399\n00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.220\nAnd here's a little bit more\nof a generic idea, Mike.\n\n400\n00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:37.810\n>> I like that one.\n\n401\n00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.400\n>> Drives that I plug in later.\n\n402\n00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.685\nYeah, just randomly I might plug\na drive in and it's available.\n\n403\n00:19:42.685 --> 00:19:46.360\n>> Yeah, I remote into Bob's machine and\nthen I realize, oh smack,\n\n404\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.800\nI need this certain file.\n\n405\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.210\nI've got it on a thumb drive,\nI plug it into my computer.\n\n406\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.400\nIt's not gonna show up on Bob's desktop,\nright?\n\n407\n00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.100\nWith that option, it will.\n\n408\n00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's fantastic.\n\n409\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.570\n>> Yeah, and it even says Other Plug and\nPlay devices as well.\n\n410\n00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.970\nYou can go ahead and do all that.\n\n411\n00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.070\nOf course,\nif you're not actually using any of them,\n\n412\n00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.860\nit's probably better that you\ndon't have any of these checked.\n\n413\n00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.280\nBut just so that we can see it working,\nwe're gonna select my local drive and\n\n414\n00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.520\nbring that one on over too.\n\n415\n00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.122\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and click OK there.\n\n416\n00:20:12.122 --> 00:20:15.388\nI'm gonna allow for the Clipboard\ntransfer as well as Printers,\n\n417\n00:20:15.388 --> 00:20:17.700\nif I had printers actually\nconnected we would do that.\n\n418\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.270\nAnd even remote audio, if you wanted to.\n\n419\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.520\nNotice that you can actually play\nthe remote audio back on your computer, or\n\n420\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.310\nplay it on that remote computer and\nsend it across.\n\n421\n00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.570\nYou name it, there's actually\n\n422\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.740\na couple of different options\nif you're having to do that.\n\n423\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.421\nSometimes though,\n\n424\n00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:32.670\nyou actually hear the quality may\nnot play as nice as you want it to.\n\n425\n00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.300\n>> Yeah,\nthis is not going to be a media server.\n\n426\n00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.220\nBelieve me, I tried a long time ago.\n\n427\n00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.520\nI got my computer at home and\nI've got all my music stored on there.\n\n428\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.625\nAnd I was like, heck, I'm at work, I'm\ngonna remote into my computer at home and\n\n429\n00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:45.980\nI'm gonna play some of that music.\n\n430\n00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, not so much.\n\n431\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.680\nBut if you need sound effects from a\nprogram to come through, you can do that.\n\n432\n00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.870\nBut it's not gonna be enough to\nreally stream music, or videos,\n\n433\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:55.610\nor [LAUGH] anything.\n\n434\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.460\n>> Right,\nalso in that remote connection of course,\n\n435\n00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.750\nis the ability to control the Windows key\ncombinations as well, on the keyboard.\n\n436\n00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.070\nSo if I wanted to use the Alt+Tab\nin the remote desktop connection\n\n437\n00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.760\nwhen that window's open,\nwhen do I actually allow it to do that?\n\n438\n00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.950\nOnly when it's actually in full-screen,\nor on the remote computer only, or\n\n439\n00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.970\non this computer.\n\n440\n00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.540\nWell, it actually gives you that ability.\n\n441\n00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.480\nThe default is only when using\nit on full-screen here, but\n\n442\n00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.580\nyou can change that if you want to.\n\n443\n00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.530\nIf you have certain key combination\nyou love to use on every machine,\n\n444\n00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.570\nyou'll probably leave it here.\n\n445\n00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.210\nOr you'll actually say, always on that\nremote machine, or only on mine, and\n\n446\n00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.280\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n447\n00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.310\nNow, this is one that I haven't\nreally used too much, Mike, Programs?\n\n448\n00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.622\n>> I will say that I\nfind this pretty useless-\n\n449\n00:21:36.622 --> 00:21:37.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.070\n>> To be honest with you.\n\n451\n00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:42.460\nI'm sure it serves it purpose,\nit's a lot doing a terminal server.\n\n452\n00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.086\nIf you check that check mark and then type\nin calc.exe or calculator, when you remote\n\n453\n00:21:47.086 --> 00:21:51.006\nin to that other computer, you don't\nget access to the entire desktop,\n\n454\n00:21:51.006 --> 00:21:53.020\nall you get access to is Calculator.\n\n455\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So maybe that's what you want to do.\n\n456\n00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.800\nI would tell you, Ronnie, I have never\nused it other than just playing around\n\n457\n00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.900\nwith it to see what it does.\n\n458\n00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.581\n>> Well,\nthat's one way to limit a user to saying,\n\n459\n00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:03.720\nhere's what you're gonna remote in and\ndo, and that's it.\n\n460\n00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.958\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, but\n\n461\n00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:08.420\nif somebody was remoting into a server and\nyou want them to run just one application,\n\n462\n00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.350\nI guess that's one way\nyou could lock it down.\n\n463\n00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.930\n>> Yeah, that is a great way to lock\nsomething down, isn't it, yeah, sure.\n\n464\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:14.870\n>> Let's not do that.\n\n465\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.050\n>> Yeah, let's not do that.\n\n466\n00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.370\nNow, Experience, this is actually\none that really does help,\n\n467\n00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.000\ndepending on the bandwidth\nyou have access to.\n\n468\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.660\nSo, notice it's actually going\nto have all these check boxes.\n\n469\n00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.660\nRight, the more checks that you have,\n\n470\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.120\nthe more bandwidth you\nprobably will have access to.\n\n471\n00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.930\nIn other words,\nyou're gonna bring everything over,\n\n472\n00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.300\nwhether it's the desktop background,\nfont smoothing, you name it.\n\n473\n00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.460\nIf you have low speed broadband from\n256 to 2 MB, the only thing it's really\n\n474\n00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.480\ntrying to do is preserve the visual\nstyle and the persistent bitmap caching.\n\n475\n00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.110\nBut on that drop-down I\nhave access to a lot more.\n\n476\n00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.720\nNow look at that, it even allows me\nto go down to modem if I wanted to.\n\n477\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.972\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n478\n00:22:52.972 --> 00:22:57.060\nthe only thing its gonna do is actually\npersist in the bitmap caching on one side.\n\n479\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.820\nBut if you're on the same LAN,\nyou may choose, of course, the LAN.\n\n480\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.590\nAnd notice that it actually brings\neverything across on that connection.\n\n481\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.370\nSo if you are on a local area network,\nthis is probably the option that's gonna\n\n482\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:12.250\ngive you the most feel, as if you're\nactually right there on that machine.\n\n483\n00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.120\n>> Absolutely, and just keep in mind, when\nyou select those different options from\n\n484\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.030\nthat drop-down list,\nit's not limiting your bandwidth to that.\n\n485\n00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.240\nSo if you pick modem 56k,\n\n486\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.430\nit's not gonna throttle your\nbandwidth down to 56 kilobytes.\n\n487\n00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.890\nIt's trying to help you decide which of\nthose check marks you should check and\n\n488\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:27.950\nwhich ones you shouldn't check.\n\n489\n00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.280\nSo it's just helping you.\n\n490\n00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.270\nYou can check whichever ones you want.\n\n491\n00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.160\nYou can pick any one\nfrom that drop-down list.\n\n492\n00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.300\nBut as Ronnie said,\nit helps with bandwidth.\n\n493\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.450\nIf I'm on a connection, and it's really\njittery or slow and I'm having trouble,\n\n494\n00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.430\nit's not very smooth,\n\n495\n00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:46.310\ndo I really need to see the contents of\nWindows while I'm dragging it around?\n\n496\n00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.500\nNo, I can deal with a little gray outline\nuntil I drag it to where I want to, right?\n\n497\n00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.755\nWhy waste the bandwidth,\n\n498\n00:23:50.755 --> 00:23:53.620\ncuz that's a lot of video that's\ngotta be sent back and forth.\n\n499\n00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.610\nSo by unchecking something,\nI might be on a LAN connection but\n\n500\n00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.980\nstill choose to uncheck show\ncontent of Windows while dragging,\n\n501\n00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.570\njust to make things work\na little bit faster.\n\n502\n00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.030\nSo again, don't thing it's\ngonna actually throttle you.\n\n503\n00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.981\n>> No.\n>> It's just trying to help your end\n\n504\n00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:07.760\nexperience.\n\n505\n00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.324\n>> It really is and so I like the option\nhere, it actually even has one for\n\n506\n00:24:11.324 --> 00:24:14.168\nsatellite connection cuz\nthat's what I have at home.\n\n507\n00:24:14.168 --> 00:24:18.789\nEven so, I normally just pick this one\ninstead because I know I don't need that\n\n508\n00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:20.510\ndesktop composition.\n\n509\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.940\nAs long as I can get\naccess to what I need to,\n\n510\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.780\nI'm willing to deal with it\nbecause the latency is so bad.\n\n511\n00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.810\n>> Well, what if that user has\na tiff on their background, or\n\n512\n00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.310\nsome big megapixel picture\nas their background?\n\n513\n00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.960\nCuz you know how people are, they bring\nin pictures of their kids and their dogs.\n\n514\n00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.640\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n515\n00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.240\n>> And they don't know any way to optimize\nthem, but they got these incredible\n\n516\n00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.830\ncameras that shoot ten megabyte pictures,\nand things like that.\n\n517\n00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.330\nI don't really need to bring\ntheir desktop with me, right.\n\n518\n00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.400\nSo you can uncheck some of those.\n\n519\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.680\n>> So yeah, there's a nice way.\n\n520\n00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.780\nIf you don't want to go in and actually\nchoose all display settings, this is one\n\n521\n00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:57.910\nthat will actually help you out just one\na nice little even one place access.\n\n522\n00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:02.070\nAnd lastly, we have this Advance tab for\nother things that we can also\n\n523\n00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.350\nbe able to use, normally you actually\nhave additional infrastructure\n\n524\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.420\nwhen you start getting over here with\nthe server authentication and what to do.\n\n525\n00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.380\nAnd then they connect from anywhere if you\nare setting up what we call a terminal\n\n526\n00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.360\nservices gateway instead,\nwhere everybody is actually connecting in\n\n527\n00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.790\nto the remote desktop, they're not\ngetting a direct connection and\n\n528\n00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.270\nthey're actually hitting that\nterminal services gateway and\n\n529\n00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.590\nthen being allowed access\ninto the machine as well.\n\n530\n00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:29.270\nAnd you can click Connect, and\nthen you set up those options there too.\n\n531\n00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.900\nSo a lot of times it really\njust depends on what you need.\n\n532\n00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.956\nNow, you might be wondering why\neven on a small network is that,\n\n533\n00:25:34.956 --> 00:25:36.610\nis this something that I would do?\n\n534\n00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.399\nSure enough, I would definitely do this\nif I'm gonna be troubleshooting these\n\n535\n00:25:40.399 --> 00:25:43.620\ncomputers and I'm gonna need access\nto them being able to use this is\n\n536\n00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.900\nactually one of the key\nways that we can do this.\n\n537\n00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.902\nAll right, so now that I've got\neverything actually set up and\n\n538\n00:25:49.902 --> 00:25:54.800\nready to go here, so I'm going to\nconnect over to the TECH02 computer.\n\n539\n00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.790\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and click,\nactually, let me make sure here.\n\n540\n00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.690\nYep, gonna click Connect and\nclick Connect here.\n\n541\n00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.640\nAnd notice, right away it actually went\nahead and connected to the other machine.\n\n542\n00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.060\nAnd if I actually typed in the right\npassword from Nathan's account,\n\n543\n00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:15.290\nit is now going to secure the connection\nand allow me to connect over.\n\n544\n00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.870\nSo, it might take a little bit\nthe first time cuz it's actually\n\n545\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.010\nnegotiating the security.\n\n546\n00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.600\nIf it fails,\n\n547\n00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.910\nit means I didn't actually set up\nsomething correctly and that does happen.\n\n548\n00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.640\nI might have mistyped the password or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n549\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.920\nAnd so initially I'm going\nto get this connection.\n\n550\n00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.080\nNow Mike, should I be worried on this one?\n\n551\n00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.770\n>> It depends.\n\n552\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.740\nIf you know that other system,\nthen no, I wouldn't worry about it.\n\n553\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.270\nIf you don't know that system, then maybe.\n\n554\n00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.660\nRemember we're asking for\nnetwork level authentication.\n\n555\n00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.410\nIf you haven't gone and issued\ncertificates to all your machines they\n\n556\n00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:45.410\ncan't provide that you're gonna\nget a self signed certificate.\n\n557\n00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.260\nSo if you've watched any of\nthe other episodes where we've dealt\n\n558\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.290\nwith certificate servers, that means\nthe certificate's not being trusted and\n\n559\n00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.030\nit's just asking you, hey,\nI don't know this person.\n\n560\n00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.040\nAre you sure you trust them?\n\n561\n00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.820\nCuz remember you're bringing your drives\nwith you if you checked those options, so\n\n562\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.830\nnow there's the potential that that\nmachine could infect your machine or\n\n563\n00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.500\nthat they or that something could happen.\n\n564\n00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.120\nYou could get your machine compromised.\n\n565\n00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.710\nSo that's giving you that chance to say\noh no I don't trust that or something.\n\n566\n00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:10.380\n>> Right.\n\n567\n00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.800\nIf another user is also logged into\nthe machine that you're trying\n\n568\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.100\nto get the remote desktop access into,\n\n569\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.220\nnotice it's actually gonna\ngive you another warning here.\n\n570\n00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.090\nSo this user has to disconnect if you\nwant him to be able to access it.\n\n571\n00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.470\nAnd let's say yes.\n\n572\n00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.680\nAnd then it's now waiting for\nme to respond.\n\n573\n00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.670\nSo I go on over to that other machine,\nif I'm in the middle of working\n\n574\n00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:34.130\nnotice right here it says hey, Nathan\nis trying to connect to this machine.\n\n575\n00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.880\nOK to disconnect if you needed to,\n\n576\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.630\nor you're gonna actually be\ndisconnected in 30 seconds anyways.\n\n577\n00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.360\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n578\n00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.180\nAnd now, notice it logged me out on\nthis machine, and now here it is.\n\n579\n00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.180\nFor Nathan's machine,\nI'm going to agree to that.\n\n580\n00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.170\nAnd, ooh, too much information.\n\n581\n00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.330\nThat way I could actually see some of\nthe additional information there to see.\n\n582\n00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:01.550\nSo now I'm logged into that machine, and I\ncan work with it as if I'm sitting there,\n\n583\n00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.380\nso Nathan now can work with it and\nlet's check on those resources.\n\n584\n00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:09.150\nIf I click on Computer, notice that there\nis my local drive on that remote machine.\n\n585\n00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.840\nSo Nathan could get access to that.\n\n586\n00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.670\nBut also, on his own machine, notice it's\nthe C drive, so he can also gain access to\n\n587\n00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.030\nhis own files on his own machine then\nbring those over if he needs to.\n\n588\n00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:24.120\nSo it really is just as good as sitting\nright there on that machine and\n\n589\n00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.850\nworking with it and\nbeing able to control that machine.\n\n590\n00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.580\nDo all the things that you need to and\n\n591\n00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.920\nin the end you have a couple\nof different options.\n\n592\n00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.300\nYou can either log off or disconnect.\n\n593\n00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.460\nNow, if you're an administrator on that\nmachine, you can even shut down that\n\n594\n00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.220\nmachine, and even though you can do that,\nwhat's the problem with doing that?\n\n595\n00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.640\n>> Not a good idea because\nif that machine is remote,\n\n596\n00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.450\nwhich is probably why you're using\nremote desktop in the first place.\n\n597\n00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.280\nIf you shut it down,\n\n598\n00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.770\nthere needs to be somebody there\nto actually turn it back on.\n\n599\n00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:50.780\nSomebody physically there.\n\n600\n00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.971\n>> I can't remotely turn it on?\n\n601\n00:28:51.971 --> 00:28:52.910\n[LAUGH]\n>> You can't.\n\n602\n00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.942\nI guess we could set up some fancy\nwake on LAN or something like that but\n\n603\n00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:58.310\nnot with remote desktop\nyou're not gonna be able to.\n\n604\n00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:02.100\nSo it is important that\nyou don't power it down,\n\n605\n00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.460\nwhich is why a typical user\ndoesn't even get that option.\n\n606\n00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.620\nOnly the administrators\nare gonnna see the shutdown.\n\n607\n00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.690\nThe other thing to keep in mind if you log\noff you're disconnecting your session,\n\n608\n00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.660\nit will be just like you're sitting in\na machine and you chose to log off.\n\n609\n00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.570\nIf you choose disconnect,\nyou're actually leaving your session open.\n\n610\n00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.490\nIn other words,\nif I remote in to your machine, and\n\n611\n00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.790\nI launch a program, if I log off,\nit kills that program,\n\n612\n00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:28.540\njust like if I was sitting there,\nI've logged off, the program is done.\n\n613\n00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.890\nIf I start up a program and I disconnect,\nthat program is still running.\n\n614\n00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.090\nMaybe I remote in and\nI start some long running process.\n\n615\n00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.330\nI can't just log off cuz\nthat's gonna end the process.\n\n616\n00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.960\nSo there are times when I choose\nDisconnect instead of Log off,\n\n617\n00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.000\nit leaves that process running\non that remote machine.\n\n618\n00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.420\nBut keep in mind, you're only allowed so\nmany connections, right Ronnie?\n\n619\n00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.180\nAnd we can bump into a problem there.\n\n620\n00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.270\n>> Yeah, you really can.\n\n621\n00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.090\nUsually two connections,\ndepending on the server that you're on.\n\n622\n00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.110\nSometimes like what happened to me, right,\nthere's only one user logged on and\n\n623\n00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.810\nit said look, somebody else is\ntrying to log on to this machine,\n\n624\n00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:03.770\nyou're not gonna be able to use this at\nthe same time, so you do have that option.\n\n625\n00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:07.610\nNow, what I did while Mike was talking\nwas just simply selected the Disconnect,\n\n626\n00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:11.390\nI launched just the calculator\nprogram in the background and now,\n\n627\n00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:16.130\nwhen I click OK, what I should see is that\nthat calculator is actually still running.\n\n628\n00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:19.410\nSo it's not like we walked off and\nlogged off, cuz if I log off,\n\n629\n00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.260\nright, that calculator disappears and\ncloses down.\n\n630\n00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.570\nBut disconnect really just leaves it up\nand running and in the background and\n\n631\n00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.650\nready to go, it really depends on what\nyou need to be working at the time, but\n\n632\n00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:34.480\nthis is a great little tool for us to\nactually take a look at being able to do.\n\n633\n00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.510\n>> It's fantastic.\n\n634\n00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.640\nSo if you're working on the help desk,\nand you've got users calling you up,\n\n635\n00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.400\nthis might be your company's option for\ndoing that type of support.\n\n636\n00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.620\nYou might be set up in the Remote Desktop\nusers group on all your client machines,\n\n637\n00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.980\nand this is how you fix their machine.\n\n638\n00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.960\nThey put in a work ticket, a help ticket.\n\n639\n00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.480\nYou get the ticket, they say hey,\nsomething's wrong with this.\n\n640\n00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.394\nYou remote in their machine when\nthey're at lunch, or you tell them hey,\n\n641\n00:30:56.394 --> 00:30:58.990\nI'm getting ready to remote in,\nand I need to fix your computer.\n\n642\n00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.528\nYou remote in, you do it,\nyou close it down.\n\n643\n00:31:01.528 --> 00:31:04.685\nWe're gonna talk about,\nin another episode, some other options,\n\n644\n00:31:04.685 --> 00:31:09.530\ncuz there are some issues with this,\nnot issues, but drawbacks, maybe.\n\n645\n00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:13.280\nOne of the things that you're gonna\nfind is that, you notice how when Ronnie\n\n646\n00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.550\nremoted into that machine as Nathan,\nthe other user got kicked off, right?\n\n647\n00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.700\nOnly one person can be logged in\nat that client at the same time.\n\n648\n00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.780\nSo let's say I'm trying to help\nsomebody fix their computer.\n\n649\n00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.080\nI remote into their computer,\nall they see is a lock screen,\n\n650\n00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.090\nit kicks them off I'm in their screen,\nI'm fixing their computer.\n\n651\n00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:35.450\nI can't help them, I can't share any\ninformation with them like this is what's\n\n652\n00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:40.110\nwrong, this is why it's happened, this is\nwhat you need to not do in the future or\n\n653\n00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.180\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n654\n00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.720\nThey don't see any of that, so it's not\na learning experience for that end user,\n\n655\n00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.200\nwhich means the same problem\noccurs the next day,right?\n\n656\n00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.390\nI have to do it all over again.\n\n657\n00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.300\nSo that is one issue with Remote Desktop,\n\n658\n00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:56.050\nis that it's not a good way to teach\nsomebody about how to fix the problems or\n\n659\n00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.230\nanything like that, because it is,\nthey get kicked off.\n\n660\n00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:03.090\n>> It is actually a great way though,\nI can't tell you anything but\n\n661\n00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:07.200\nthe truth here,\nI use Remote Desktop just about daily.\n\n662\n00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.264\nIf I'm not using it daily,\n\n663\n00:32:08.264 --> 00:32:11.287\nit's more than likely because I forgot\nto check something I was supposed to.\n\n664\n00:32:11.287 --> 00:32:13.256\nAnd so that's the reason.\n\n665\n00:32:13.256 --> 00:32:18.170\nSo this probably one of the most Utilize\ntools that you'll have access to as\n\n666\n00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.850\na support technician.\n\n667\n00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.670\n>> And Ronny, I know we are getting\nready to run out of time here.\n\n668\n00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.190\nI did want to mention one more thing.\n\n669\n00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:28.170\nYou know, we have seen remote desktop, and\nas a helpdesk technician that might be\n\n670\n00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.740\nthe tool we use to fix other computers\non our network as we remote into them.\n\n671\n00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.140\nEvery remote desktop connection\nwe make is a separate window.\n\n672\n00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.460\nSo if I have to connect to more\nthan one machine at one time,\n\n673\n00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.370\nthat can get a little clustered working\nwith all the different windows.\n\n674\n00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:45.540\nOr, if you're using it as a way\nto manage servers, again,\n\n675\n00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.640\nyou might have several windows open, and\n\n676\n00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.070\nall the backgrounds look the same-\n>> They do.\n\n677\n00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.190\n>> Because they've got that\ndefault background on server.\n\n678\n00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.590\nIt starts to get difficult.\n\n679\n00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.670\nSo one tool that I like, and I just\nwent out and downloaded it real quick,\n\n680\n00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.150\nand I'll just give you\na quick overview of it,\n\n681\n00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:03.080\nis this Remote Desktop Connection Manager\nfrom Microsoft.\n\n682\n00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.700\nAnd let me see if I can run\nit real quick and install it.\n\n683\n00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.350\nBasically, it's a tabbed interface for\nRemote Desktop.\n\n684\n00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:12.600\nSo, instead of having separate windows for\neach remote desktop, you've got one window\n\n685\n00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.209\nthat looks like their standard MMC format,\nthat Microsoft Management Console.\n\n686\n00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:23.170\nAnd then you can add several remote\ndesktop connections to that window.\n\n687\n00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:27.110\nAnd so then I've got this nice tabbed\ninterface within a single window, and\n\n688\n00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.940\nI can click on each tab to switch back and\nforth between machines.\n\n689\n00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.220\nSo we'll see how fast.\n\n690\n00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.240\nIf this'll install really quick,\nI'll show you.\n\n691\n00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.780\nIf not,\nmaybe we'll do it on another episode.\n\n692\n00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.330\nSo again,\nfree download from Microsoft, and\n\n693\n00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:44.050\nI'll give you guys the link to\nthat here in just a second.\n\n694\n00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.850\n>> And that's a nice feature, to have\nthese tabbed browsers especially when\n\n695\n00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:52.050\nyou're using those remote types of\nconnections and multiple connections.\n\n696\n00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:57.015\nThere are third party software that\nreally does the same thing, and\n\n697\n00:33:57.015 --> 00:33:59.460\nsomebody in our chat, David,\nactually mentions that.\n\n698\n00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.030\nWhen you actually do\nsomething like this one for\n\n699\n00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:05.440\nthe Microsoft it may only connect\nto the Microsoft Windows for you.\n\n700\n00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.942\nWhereas some of the other ones that\nare third party, you can actually connect\n\n701\n00:34:07.942 --> 00:34:10.930\nnot only to Microsoft, but\nyou can even connect to other machines\n\n702\n00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:16.140\nusing the tabbed type of remote desktop\ntypes of connections that are out there.\n\n703\n00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.170\n>> I tell you what, it is taking\nit's sweet little time installing,\n\n704\n00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:20.570\nso you know about it.\n\n705\n00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:23.120\nI've told you it's that\nRemote Desktop Connection Manager.\n\n706\n00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.380\nFree download from Microsoft.\n\n707\n00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.810\nGo out and grab that if you use remote\ndesktop as your tool of choice for working\n\n708\n00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.590\nwith multiple machines, maybe that's\nsomething that you want to look into.\n\n709\n00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.000\nThere's third party software out there\nas well that'll do stuff like that.\n\n710\n00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.830\nBut for now, I think, we'll go,\n\n711\n00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.700\nunless you can think of anything else\nwe didn't cover with remote desktop?\n\n712\n00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.500\n>> No,\nI don't think with remote desktop, but\n\n713\n00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.490\nwe do actually have another section to go\nthrough, so it looks like we're gonna have\n\n714\n00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:47.120\nto come back for\na little more remote administration here.\n\n715\n00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:47.660\n>> Absolutely.\n\n716\n00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.000\nThere's a lot of ways you can\ndo remote administration.\n\n717\n00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.340\nSo, we want to thank everybody for\ntuning in.\n\n718\n00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.290\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n719\n00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:55.230\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n720\n00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:58.257\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:16.428\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:17.241\nHow are you, Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:18.317\n>> I am doing fine today.\n\n6\n00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:22.576\nIt's another great day for us to be\ntalking about Windows 7 and so exciting,\n\n7\n00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:23.895\nsome good technology.\n\n8\n00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:24.879\n>> Absolutely.\n\n9\n00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:29.190\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at more remote administration,\n\n10\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.290\nbecause it' what we have to do is\none of the more common things we do.\n\n11\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.383\nWe're not always there at the place\nwhere the person needs help.\n\n12\n00:00:36.383 --> 00:00:40.856\nSo if we're providing support from say, a\nhelp desk position that user calls us up,\n\n13\n00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:45.330\nsays, hey, I'm having trouble with my\nmachine or this application isn't working\n\n14\n00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.490\nright or I can't print or\nwhatever they're complaining about today.\n\n15\n00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.195\nWe've got to have some way to fix their\nmachine and I'm not in that office.\n\n16\n00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:55.760\nThat might office might be on\nthe other side of the country,\n\n17\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.160\nit might be in another country altogether.\n\n18\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.400\nIn previous episodes,\nwe've looked at a couple different tools.\n\n19\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.910\nWe've looked at RSAT,\nmy Remote Server Administration Tool.\n\n20\n00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.545\nSo check that episode out,\nif you missed it.\n\n21\n00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:10.156\nWe also did an episode on Remote Desktop,\nwhich was a really good episode.\n\n22\n00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:11.555\nCheck that one out if you missed it.\n\n23\n00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:15.647\nBut in this one, we're gonna look at\nsomething called Remote Assistance.\n\n24\n00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:20.100\nWhich is similar to Remote Desktop,\nbut it's a little bit different and\n\n25\n00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.640\nit's pretty darn cool.\n\n26\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.157\nIsn't it, Ronnie?\n\n27\n00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:26.950\n>> It really is, it's more interactive\nthan using something like Remote Desktop.\n\n28\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.195\nWith the Remote Desktop, you have\nthe ability to sit at your computer and\n\n29\n00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:35.660\nreally take control of somebody else's\ncomputer or a server if you want to.\n\n30\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.124\nJust like you're sitting right there,\n\n31\n00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:40.054\nyou've literally knocked that person out\nof the way and you've pulled the chair\n\n32\n00:01:40.054 --> 00:01:43.230\nup and you're sitting right there\neven though you're not really there.\n\n33\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.578\nBut with Remote Assistance, you have\nthe benefit of also at the same time,\n\n34\n00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:51.453\ninteracting with the end user, but\nnot really having to be there.\n\n35\n00:01:51.453 --> 00:01:55.028\nI know that sounds strange, but it is\nsomething that you an actually end up\n\n36\n00:01:55.028 --> 00:01:58.210\ndoing and\nit's something that is incredibly helpful.\n\n37\n00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.237\nThere are sometimes, regardless\nof how you're doing the support,\n\n38\n00:02:02.237 --> 00:02:05.652\nespecially if it is over telephone,\nif you can't see it.\n\n39\n00:02:05.652 --> 00:02:08.971\nIf somebody's just explaining and\nyou're in the break, you end up saying,\n\n40\n00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:09.950\nsomethings going on.\n\n41\n00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.703\nI don't know exactly what it is and\nyou go, well, maybe I can get down there.\n\n42\n00:02:14.703 --> 00:02:18.860\nBut one of the things that you might be\nable to do instead is use a technology\n\n43\n00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.682\nlike what we call Remote Assistance and\nboth of you can actually be on\n\n44\n00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:27.176\nthe computer at the same time taking a\nlook at what's actually happening on that\n\n45\n00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:30.770\ncomputer and I know I've had\nthat happen before on my end.\n\n46\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.250\nWe've used some services in the past\nwhere we experienced some issues and\n\n47\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.872\nthere wasn't anything I could\ndo to explain to the person-\n\n48\n00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:39.899\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n49\n00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.671\n>> What I was actually seeing.\n\n50\n00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:45.012\nAnd finally, we actually just opened\nup some type of connect session,\n\n51\n00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:48.200\nwhether it was WebeX or anything\nelse that we actually had going on.\n\n52\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.743\nAnd that's perfectly fine and\nyou can do all of that and\n\n53\n00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:53.017\nthen they can see the error\nthat you are getting.\n\n54\n00:02:53.017 --> 00:02:57.462\nThey can actually see what you are\nexperiencing when the problem is actually\n\n55\n00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:02.045\nhappening and be able to actually try and\ntake a look at what could be going on and\n\n56\n00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:06.489\nthen they can also give you the ability or\nyou can give them the ability to take\n\n57\n00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.240\ncontrol of that session and\nyou can watch at the same time.\n\n58\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.048\nSo that you know that they're doing\nexactly what they say that they're doing\n\n59\n00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:13.917\nand not anything more.\n\n60\n00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:16.059\n>> I tell you Ronnie, you and\nI have both done phone support before-\n\n61\n00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.673\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n62\n00:03:16.673 --> 00:03:19.975\n>> And it's a challenge, because you've\ngot somebody on the other end of that\n\n63\n00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:22.120\nphone call that is not a computer person.\n\n64\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.694\nSo they're describing things to you and\nyou're like well the thingy isn't doing\n\n65\n00:03:25.694 --> 00:03:29.211\nthe duty that its suppose to you know when\nI click on it and you're like wait what or\n\n66\n00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:30.853\nthere's, so well, I got an error.\n\n67\n00:03:30.853 --> 00:03:31.760\nWhat did the error say?\n\n68\n00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.235\nI don't know I clicked OK.\n\n69\n00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.768\nOkay, well,\nI needed to see what that error was.\n\n70\n00:03:36.768 --> 00:03:40.370\nIf I try to Remote Desktop in as\nRonnie said, it kicks them off and\n\n71\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.255\nonly I'm seeing their screen and\nI'm not connected as my user.\n\n72\n00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:46.543\nWhat if the problem lies\nwithin their profile or\n\n73\n00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:48.840\nsomething that's specific\nto their profile?\n\n74\n00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.580\nI'm not gonna see that error now.\n\n75\n00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.859\nSo Remote Assistance is a big\nplace in remote support and\n\n76\n00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.625\nyou might have even seen it before,\nbecause a lot of companies,\n\n77\n00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:01.138\nMicrosoft makes this available and\nit's been rebranded.\n\n78\n00:04:01.138 --> 00:04:04.894\nLike I've gotten on support calls with, I\nthink Dell was one of them that was using\n\n79\n00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:07.849\nit or something very similar if\nthey weren't using Microsoft.\n\n80\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.340\nWhere we are going to show you exactly\nwhat I mean, where it's very interactive\n\n81\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.584\nand now I can stay on the computer\nwhile they are helping me and\n\n82\n00:04:16.584 --> 00:04:20.041\nI can see what they are doing and\nwe can walk through the problem.\n\n83\n00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:23.550\nI really love\nthe Remote Assistance feature.\n\n84\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.197\n>> Yeah, the nice thing about it\nis that you do have that ability.\n\n85\n00:04:27.197 --> 00:04:31.231\nSo it doesn't mean that it's the most\nintuitive thing in the world to get set\n\n86\n00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:34.250\nup, but for the end user,\nit really is helpful.\n\n87\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.224\nBecause it means that you can go ahead and\nactually have it set up correctly and\n\n88\n00:04:38.224 --> 00:04:42.155\nthere's just a couple of things that they\nneed to do to make it begin to work.\n\n89\n00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:45.963\nAnd once you actually get it working, it\nreally is you making that connection and\n\n90\n00:04:45.963 --> 00:04:47.050\nits so easy.\n\n91\n00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.774\nNow this has been around for\na long time, though.\n\n92\n00:04:48.774 --> 00:04:51.199\n>> I'll tell you how easy it is.\n\n93\n00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.618\nI was able to talk to my\nmother over the telephone.\n\n94\n00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:56.369\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Get her to send me the invitation,\n\n95\n00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:59.510\nwhich we're going to discuss and\nI was able to connect to her machine.\n\n96\n00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.852\nNow, I'm here in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n97\n00:05:00.852 --> 00:05:02.450\nShe's down in Tampa, Florida.\n\n98\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.564\nWe don't have any common network or\nVPN or anything like that,\n\n99\n00:05:05.564 --> 00:05:08.700\nI was able to connect to her machine and\nfix her machine for her.\n\n100\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.680\nSo it really is, it's pretty cool.\n\n101\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.491\n>> Yeah, the invitation is the thing\nthat makes everything work.\n\n102\n00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:16.240\nSo, in other words, they figure\nout how to package that thing up.\n\n103\n00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.560\nAnd as long as you can get\naccess to that invitation,\n\n104\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.252\nit makes the connection between you and\nthat other person and\n\n105\n00:05:21.252 --> 00:05:24.704\nyou don't even have to actually know all\nthe other things that go in between.\n\n106\n00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:25.710\n>> Absolutely.\n\n107\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.590\nAll right, Ronnie.\nWell, let's see where do we start then?\n\n108\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.808\nI guess the first thing we need to\ndo is make sure it's enabled or\n\n109\n00:05:30.808 --> 00:05:32.220\nmake sure it's turned on.\n\n110\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.080\n>> That is the key.\n\n111\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.956\nSo if you are actually having to do this,\nif you are actually being a support for\n\n112\n00:05:37.956 --> 00:05:40.777\nsomeone, you have to actually\nmake sure that they verify\n\n113\n00:05:40.777 --> 00:05:43.506\nthat Remote Assistance is\nturned on on their machine.\n\n114\n00:05:43.506 --> 00:05:47.550\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at how to do that, as well.\n\n115\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.614\nI have two Verco machines running as they\nare actually connected onto the same\n\n116\n00:05:51.614 --> 00:05:55.552\nnetwork here and let's say that\nthe network is actually for fairly large,\n\n117\n00:05:55.552 --> 00:05:56.320\nfairly busy.\n\n118\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.357\nAnd here's my technician machine,\nthis is the one that I work on daily.\n\n119\n00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:03.070\nAnd then there is another machine that's\nout there, let's say, it's this one.\n\n120\n00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.430\nAnd so if we were needing to do\nsomething like Remote Assistance,\n\n121\n00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.070\nI'd need to actually verify and\nhave the user be able to do this.\n\n122\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.325\nOr we can actually turn this on,\nmaybe through group policy as well.\n\n123\n00:06:12.325 --> 00:06:13.860\n>> Yeah, we definitely can.\n\n124\n00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.652\nWe can do that through group policy and\nenable it.\n\n125\n00:06:15.652 --> 00:06:20.941\nIn fact, I think we're gonna see, Ronnie,\nthat it turned on by default in Windows 7.\n\n126\n00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:25.083\nSo we're pretending in this case the blue\nbackground is gonna be the one that\n\n127\n00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:26.255\nneeds help, right?\n\n128\n00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:27.765\nThe person that's having a problem.\n\n129\n00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:33.230\n>> So, I right-clicked on computer and\nthen I select Remote Settings.\n\n130\n00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.198\nAnd normally, you actually see is,\nthis first option up here that says,\n\n131\n00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:40.282\nallow Remote Assistance\nconnections to this computer.\n\n132\n00:06:40.282 --> 00:06:41.561\nSo, I'm gonna click on this Advanced and\n\n133\n00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:43.390\nsee if there's anything\nelse that I need here.\n\n134\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.430\nAnd Mike, these are actually a couple of\nneat settings that we have available.\n\n135\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.397\nOne says, of course, allow this\ncomputer to be controlled remotely.\n\n136\n00:06:50.397 --> 00:06:53.595\nIt's probably something we're gonna\nwant that user to actually do,\n\n137\n00:06:53.595 --> 00:06:56.574\njust in case there are some things\nthat I have to be able to type in or\n\n138\n00:06:56.574 --> 00:06:59.284\nthat I need to actually make\nsure that it's run correctly,\n\n139\n00:06:59.284 --> 00:07:01.970\nI want to be able to take\ncontrol of that computer.\n\n140\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.217\nAnd what about this one here,\nMike, on this invitation?\n\n141\n00:07:04.217 --> 00:07:05.831\n>> I believe that, if I remember right,\n\n142\n00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:07.756\nthat's how long\nthe invitation is good for.\n\n143\n00:07:07.756 --> 00:07:11.427\nWhen you create this invitation,\nit's basically, as Ronnie said earlier,\n\n144\n00:07:11.427 --> 00:07:14.833\ngonna package up all the information\nneeded to connect to that machine.\n\n145\n00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:17.815\nAnd then I can email that\ninvitation to somebody,\n\n146\n00:07:17.815 --> 00:07:22.075\nI can actually use instant messaging\nprograms to get that to somebody,\n\n147\n00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:24.065\nI could put it in a shared folder.\n\n148\n00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:27.658\nAt work, there might be a certain folder\nthat we dump our invitations into and\n\n149\n00:07:27.658 --> 00:07:31.415\nthen the help desk just goes through that\nfolder and clicks on it one at a time, but\n\n150\n00:07:31.415 --> 00:07:33.985\nI don't want that invitation\nsent out there forever.\n\n151\n00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:35.581\nIf somebody finds that invitation,\n\n152\n00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:37.696\nnormally we password\nprotect the invitations.\n\n153\n00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:40.963\nBut again, if I don't put any kind of\nexpiration on it, that gives them time to\n\n154\n00:07:40.963 --> 00:07:44.244\nguess that password and they could end\nup attempting to connect to my machine.\n\n155\n00:07:44.244 --> 00:07:47.807\nSo you wanna put a limit on how\nlong the invitation is good for.\n\n156\n00:07:47.807 --> 00:07:50.167\n>> The other thing that\nwe like to use this for\n\n157\n00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:53.009\nis what if we actually\nneed the help immediately?\n\n158\n00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.639\nAnd if I'm actually in\nthe middle of working and\n\n159\n00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:59.782\nI don't get that help immediately And\nnow, somebody tries to connect in,\n\n160\n00:07:59.782 --> 00:08:03.360\nlet's say an hour or two hours or\nthe next day later on.\n\n161\n00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.990\nWell, we really don't need that\ninvitation to be valid for a whole day.\n\n162\n00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.280\nWe might say, look,\nif I don't get help in the next hour or\n\n163\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.410\nso, I really don't need the help.\n\n164\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.650\nSo we want that invitation to expire, and\nnot something that somebody comes back and\n\n165\n00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.140\nchases us and say, well, Ronnie,\nyou put an invitation in, and\n\n166\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.920\nwhen I tried to connect,\nyou didn't actually need me to connect.\n\n167\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.020\nSo I tried again, and\nyou didn't need me to connect.\n\n168\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.660\nInstead what should happen of course,\nis that invitation expires, and\n\n169\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.540\nthat way they know that hey we didn't\nactually either get to it in time, or\n\n170\n00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.150\nthe help is no longer needed.\n\n171\n00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.060\nSo you can set this up for hours,\nminutes, or days, if you want to.\n\n172\n00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.470\nSo let's just say, I'm going to set this\nup for the next 30 minutes or so and\n\n173\n00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.930\nthat will actually help us out.\n\n174\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.600\nThe other option that I also have here, of\ncourse, is I can create an invitation that\n\n175\n00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.805\ncan only be used from computers\nrunning Windows Vista or later.\n\n176\n00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:51.618\nSo this actually goes back to a couple\nof different settings that we also have\n\n177\n00:08:51.618 --> 00:08:53.355\nunder the remote desktop.\n\n178\n00:08:53.355 --> 00:08:57.531\nIf you are gonna be using the remote\nassistance, such as you're on a Windows XP\n\n179\n00:08:57.531 --> 00:09:01.578\nmachine, hopefully you won't be, but\nif you're on a Windows XP machine or\n\n180\n00:09:01.578 --> 00:09:05.567\nsomething a little bit earlier that\ndoesn't support that network-level\n\n181\n00:09:05.567 --> 00:09:10.100\nauthentication, you may actually choose\nnot to actually put that check box there.\n\n182\n00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.019\nBut if you are actually gonna be on\na Vista machine or later, you may actually\n\n183\n00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:16.430\nchoose to do that, and that way it makes\nit a little bit more secure as well.\n\n184\n00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.650\nSo.\n>> You know,\n\n185\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.000\nyour help desk is running Windows Vista\nand later, you know that.\n\n186\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.880\nSo, you don't want to allow somebody\nwith XP, that can be some bad guy or\n\n187\n00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.400\nsomebody trying to connect.\n\n188\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.030\nSo, we can choose that more secure option.\n\n189\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.250\n>> So, those are pretty much\nthe options that we need to verify that\n\n190\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.990\nare actually on.\n\n191\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.030\nAnd normally, like we said, a default\ninstall, those options are set up and\n\n192\n00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.900\nready to go at that point when we\nare ready to make that connection.\n\n193\n00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.140\nSo that is the first thing\nthat has to be done.\n\n194\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.100\nThe second thing that the user has\nto do is extend the invitation\n\n195\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.640\nto you to be able to\nmake this access happen.\n\n196\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.110\nNow there's a couple of\nways to get access to it.\n\n197\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.170\nNormally I'd actually click on start,\nand I just start typing in remote, and\n\n198\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.480\nnotice that I have these two options\nup here, underneath programs.\n\n199\n00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.040\nThere's the remote desk top connection,\n\n200\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.500\nthat's the one that we take over\nthe control of the computer.\n\n201\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.800\nAnd then this one, that they have actually\nnamed, Windows remote assistance.\n\n202\n00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.270\nAnd if I hover over it, the screen says\ninvite a friend or technical support\n\n203\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:19.000\nperson to connect to your computer and\nhelp you or offer to help someone else.\n\n204\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.460\nSo, there's actually two\ndifferent ways we can do that.\n\n205\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.470\nI can create the invitation\nas a technician to do it.\n\n206\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.760\nOr, the person at the other end that needs\nhelp, they can create the invitation, and\n\n207\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.600\nthat's what we're going to do here.\n\n208\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.980\nWe're going to simulate\nthat somebody needs help.\n\n209\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.420\nSo, I'm gonna click on\nthe Windows remote assistance.\n\n210\n00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.280\nAnd in a moment here,\nas everything kind of populates up here,\n\n211\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:44.000\nit should give me a little application to\nlaunch up and we should be ready to go.\n\n212\n00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.850\nSo, unless I actually didn't click on it,\nthen I'm actually in trouble.\n\n213\n00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.440\nSo maybe I didn't click on it,\nmaybe that's it.\n\n214\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.280\nOh there it goes.\n\n215\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.020\nIt's just taking a little bit of time.\n\n216\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.000\nSometimes I never know if\nI actually clicked on it.\n\n217\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.020\nSo notice that you have this Wizard,\nright?\n\n218\n00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.510\nThat says hey do you want to ask or\noffer help?\n\n219\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.750\nNow, this actually used to be a little bit\ntrickier in the days of Windows X Speed.\n\n220\n00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.600\nYou have a lot, I'm going I don't\nknow which one I should check.\n\n221\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.010\nAt least now they actually\noffer you a question here.\n\n222\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.510\nSo, do I want to invite\nsomeone you trust to help, or\n\n223\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.370\ndo you want to actually help\nsomeone who has invited you?\n\n224\n00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.560\nI'm going to select this one,\ninvite someone you trust to help.\n\n225\n00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.490\nAnd when I select that, notice that she\ngives me save this invitation as a file.\n\n226\n00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.030\nAnd notice that there is a couple of\nother grayed out options here, and\n\n227\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.670\nthe reason why it's actually grayed out,\n\n228\n00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.560\nis at this point I don't have\nan email program running.\n\n229\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.270\nSo, it's actually saying hey no packing\nthis up as an email attachment,\n\n230\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.170\nwe are going to actually\nsave it as a file, and\n\n231\n00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:42.760\nthen I can actually transfer\nit however I want to.\n\n232\n00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.950\nAnd there is also another one that was\ncalled the easy connect option as well,\n\n233\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.962\nbut we are going to just select this one,\nsince that's my only option available.\n\n234\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.370\nOnce I do that, it's actually gonna give\nme the ability to save this as a file.\n\n235\n00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.780\nNow, when you save this,\nthis needs to actually be,\n\n236\n00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.110\neither you're gonna attach it to an email,\nyou can do it directly\n\n237\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.520\nfrom that option if you have that,\nbut even if you save it as file,\n\n238\n00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.780\nyou can also attach it as email and\nsend to someone if you need to.\n\n239\n00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.550\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna save\nthis to a shared network location.\n\n240\n00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.619\nYou can see on my desktop,\nthere's a VMware shared folder.\n\n241\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.750\nSo that one's actually created for me.\n\n242\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.150\nAnd I'm gonna go into the network and\nselect VMware host.\n\n243\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.630\nAnd go into the shared folder and\nthen the lab-ITProTV and\n\n244\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.847\non this invitation I'm gonna\nactually put in, help me.\n\n245\n00:12:28.847 --> 00:12:32.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, as the,\n\n246\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.780\nnow of course you wouldn't\njust do that right.\n\n247\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.050\nYou'd probably actually enter in your\nname and something else as well so\n\n248\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:38.730\nI'm just gonna say Ronnie.\n\n249\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.370\nLet's do Ronald here, just as an example.\n\n250\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.210\nAnd then I'm going to save that.\n\n251\n00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.150\nSo, the other thing that I need to\nbe able to do is right here as well.\n\n252\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.610\nIt says give your helper an invitation\nfile and password because it doesn't\n\n253\n00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.590\njust allow you to connect, you actually\nalso have to have the password.\n\n254\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.310\nIf anybody could just\nconnect with this invitation,\n\n255\n00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.090\nthat means anybody can go to that shared\nfolder, double click on an invitation and\n\n256\n00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.370\nget connected in, but it's gonna ask\nthem for a password immediately so\n\n257\n00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.410\nyou now also have this ability\nto have this password.\n\n258\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.430\nAnd usually at this point, if you\nare actually gonna have this connection,\n\n259\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.720\nyou're probably gonna email them and\nnotify them that it is coming.\n\n260\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.590\nAnd that they need to connect\nto you through a phone call or\n\n261\n00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.790\nsomething to get this password.\n\n262\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.710\nI'm gonna copy this password and I'm just\ngoing to save it as a text file in here so\n\n263\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:32.550\nI don't actually have to try to go back\nand forth between the machines instead.\n\n264\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.800\nSo I'm just gonna say password.\n\n265\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.561\nSo you probably wouldn't\ndo that in reality.\n\n266\n00:13:36.561 --> 00:13:40.105\nYou'd probably actually make\nthat a direct phone call for\n\n267\n00:13:40.105 --> 00:13:41.992\nyou to do something like that.\n\n268\n00:13:41.992 --> 00:13:44.271\n>> All right, and\nwhile you're getting that set up,\n\n269\n00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:46.656\nwe had a question there in\nthe chat room from Douglas,\n\n270\n00:13:46.656 --> 00:13:50.130\ntalking about the RDP ports and\ndo we have to make sure those are open?\n\n271\n00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:55.330\nAnd really, it doesn't use the same,\nit doesn't use 3389 like remote desktop.\n\n272\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.860\nIt actually does a little bit\nof dynamic port selection.\n\n273\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.960\nBut there is an exception.\n\n274\n00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.120\nLike if we can pull up\nmy computer real quick.\n\n275\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.240\nI don't know if we still\nhave mine on there.\n\n276\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.800\nI just opened up my Windows firewall\non a Windows 7 installation.\n\n277\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.140\nAnd you can see all the exceptions\nthis already has for\n\n278\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.570\nremote assistance over\nthese different protocols.\n\n279\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.700\nSo SSDP, DCPN, or just regular TCP.\n\n280\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.260\nDepending on how the connection's being\nmade, so you don't have to go in and\n\n281\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.050\nmake any additional exceptions for\nremote assistance.\n\n282\n00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:31.540\n>> All right, so once we have that\noption now saved to that shared folder,\n\n283\n00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.500\nthe invitation, I couldn't say option,\nthe invitation shared.\n\n284\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:40.030\nOn my machine, if I'm the one\nmonitoring for remote helps that day,\n\n285\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:44.250\nI would go into that folder,\nand the lab, the lab-itprotv,\n\n286\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.660\nand notice I have this little file, and\nyou can actually see the type of file\n\n287\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.790\nthat it actually creates, which is\na Windows Remote Assistance invitation.\n\n288\n00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.840\nAnd there it is right there, that's\nthe one that you have available to you.\n\n289\n00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.000\nSo I can simply double-click on that and\n\n290\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.980\nwhat that will do is now establish\nthe connection between me and\n\n291\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.450\nthe person I'm actually trying to go\nahead and get help from right then.\n\n292\n00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:14.835\nAnd so it's kind of moving a little bit\nslower and here in a moment we should have\n\n293\n00:15:14.835 --> 00:15:19.505\na window that pops up that says hey, we're\nabout to actually be asked for a password.\n\n294\n00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:22.005\nAnd you can see right here where it\nactually did open up the window,\n\n295\n00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.855\nbut nothing is showing through.\n\n296\n00:15:23.855 --> 00:15:27.980\nAnd it's actually going to wait until\nI populate it with a password and\n\n297\n00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.350\nthis is where you would normally get on\nthe phone and you would call that user.\n\n298\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.490\nAnd they can actually read that\npassword to you that's on their screen.\n\n299\n00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:40.410\nI'm just going to copy this that\nway I don't have to type it in.\n\n300\n00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.870\nThen we paste it right in here.\n\n301\n00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.249\nIt says you can get this password from\nthe person requesting assistance and\n\n302\n00:15:46.249 --> 00:15:47.061\nonce you do that.\n\n303\n00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:48.003\nClick OK.\n\n304\n00:15:48.003 --> 00:15:51.241\nAnd now, it doesn't look like\nit's doing any better Mike.\n\n305\n00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:52.728\nHere it is.\nI'm on my machine and\n\n306\n00:15:52.728 --> 00:15:55.759\nI'm just Sitting here and\nit looks like a black desktop.\n\n307\n00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:58.760\nSo doesn't look like I'm\nactually doing anything.\n\n308\n00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.720\n>> And that's because the other\nuser has to say whether or\n\n309\n00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.290\nnot they wanna allow it, right?\n\n310\n00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.830\nIt might be that you found that invitation\nafter, maybe they forgot to put\n\n311\n00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.940\nan expiration date on it,\nmaybe they forgot to put a password on it.\n\n312\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.670\nSomebody's found it, double clicked on it,\nand it's gonna reach out and\n\n313\n00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.810\ntry to connect to that machine and\nyou might not want it.\n\n314\n00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.290\nOr you might be in the middle\nof doing something.\n\n315\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.580\nMaybe you did put an expiration date,\ndid put a password on there, but\n\n316\n00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.810\nsomebody called and\nyou've got a customer on the phone and\n\n317\n00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.760\nyou're in the middle of\ndoing something with them.\n\n318\n00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.670\nAnd you can't accept that\nRemote Assistance connection right now.\n\n319\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.020\nSo you could choose to decline it.\n\n320\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.740\nIt gives you a chance to decide whether or\n\n321\n00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.780\nnot you wanna allow them\nto make that connection.\n\n322\n00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.960\n>> So, here it is on the other end then.\n\n323\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.650\nNotice that it says, hey do you\nwant to allow this person, Ronnie,\n\n324\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.690\nto connect to your computer?\n\n325\n00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.460\nI'm gonna say yes.\n\n326\n00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.300\nAnd from that point it doesn't\nlook like much is happening, but\n\n327\n00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.780\nnotice this little tiny bar up here.\n\n328\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.560\nIt has a chat.\n\n329\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.540\nIt has settings.\n\n330\n00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.990\nIt has stop sharing.\n\n331\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.355\nAnd it actually has this\nlittle verification.\n\n332\n00:16:52.355 --> 00:16:55.020\nYour helper can now see your desktop.\n\n333\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.690\nSo what does that mean?\n\n334\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.670\nThat means he can see everything\nthat I'm actually doing.\n\n335\n00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.320\nSo you are now actually\nshowing that to them,\n\n336\n00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.820\nbut they're not actually\nable to control anything.\n\n337\n00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.550\n>> So close your eBay window, right?\n\n338\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.090\n>> That's right.\n\n339\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.695\n>> Get rid of all that stuff before\nyou click yes on allowing access.\n\n340\n00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:10.379\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n341\n00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:14.494\na lot of times whatever you don't want\nthem to see you're gonna make sure that\n\n342\n00:17:14.494 --> 00:17:18.140\nyou close that out and\nverify that all that stuff has gone away.\n\n343\n00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.320\nBut there are a couple of different\noptions here on the end user side\n\n344\n00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.170\nthat you can take a look at.\n\n345\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.900\nYou can customize the remote assistance\nhere, changing some different ones.\n\n346\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.070\nYou can save a log of this session.\n\n347\n00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:32.150\nThat's pretty good if you need to\nexchange contact information, and\n\n348\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.280\nof course even the bandwidth usage.\n\n349\n00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.230\nIf this session is moving really slow,\nyou might actually choose that\n\n350\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.820\nsetting there and actually bump\nthat thing up if everything's fine.\n\n351\n00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.026\nThen you actually don't have\nto worry about it as well.\n\n352\n00:17:45.026 --> 00:17:48.470\nSo I'm gonna just use the low one cuz\na lot of times you are connecting\n\n353\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.180\nacross a WAN type of connection, too.\n\n354\n00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.400\nNow, on the technician side, right,\nthe person that's connecting in,\n\n355\n00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.680\nthey see the entire desktop\nwithin this window.\n\n356\n00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:06.003\nSo at this point, what can happen is that\nyou want to start then a communication.\n\n357\n00:18:06.003 --> 00:18:10.401\nAnd the way that you do it from this end\nis up here on the upper left hand corner,\n\n358\n00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:13.986\nnotice I can request control of\nthe actual size if I want to, and\n\n359\n00:18:13.986 --> 00:18:16.167\nthen a chat I'm going to select chat.\n\n360\n00:18:16.167 --> 00:18:18.990\nAnd what will happen is it\nopens up a little chat screen.\n\n361\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.590\nNow when it opens up\na chat screen on my side,\n\n362\n00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.370\nI can actually watch the person typing\nthe chat in on the remote side,\n\n363\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.630\nin other words,\nthe person requesting assistance.\n\n364\n00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.230\nThey can't see me when I'm responding.\n\n365\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.710\nThey'll see where it says I'm typing, but\n\n366\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.030\nI can actually watch them type\nthat question in if I want to.\n\n367\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:42.880\nSo normally when we're doing this,\nwe may actually say hey, or hello,\n\n368\n00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.010\nhow may I assist you today?\n\n369\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.040\nSo we may have a question and\nwe go ahead and send that.\n\n370\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.390\nAnd we can immediately see where it\nactually opened up this little window.\n\n371\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.310\nAnd now we actually have that window open.\n\n372\n00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.650\nAnd then,\nwhen they begin to actually chat,\n\n373\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.980\nwell you actually watch them type that in.\n\n374\n00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.280\nNow, I can't show you both\nof them at the same time.\n\n375\n00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But that's what would happen.\n\n376\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.050\nSo if I come over here, I can say I need\n\n377\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.797\nto be able to connect\n\n378\n00:19:17.797 --> 00:19:23.070\nremotely to, let's say, your machine.\n\n379\n00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.260\nBut I don't know if I can.\n\n380\n00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.070\nCan you help me set it up?\n\n381\n00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.290\nNow of course, this is probably not\nsomething you'd actually do, but we could\n\n382\n00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:42.320\nactually see that question being typed\nin live time here in this chat window.\n\n383\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.250\nAnd then from that point,\nit's never polite,\n\n384\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.810\nit's never polite just to go ahead and\njust request the control.\n\n385\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.530\nYou can, and that probably just says yes,\nyou'd like to request control.\n\n386\n00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:52.345\nI always ask, right?\n\n387\n00:19:52.345 --> 00:19:57.631\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> May I take control?\n\n388\n00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.270\nOf your machine, all right.\n\n389\n00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.810\nSo that way you're actually\nestablishing that.\n\n390\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.070\nNow I could just go ahead and\nrequest control at the same time.\n\n391\n00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:11.020\nNormally you do wanna wait for a response,\nbut I'm just gonna request control now.\n\n392\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.260\nAnd that actually goes ahead and\n\n393\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.750\ngives them the option as well\nas being able to say yes.\n\n394\n00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.020\nAnd they just pop it up here and\nonce they click yes.\n\n395\n00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.610\nAnd now from this point, I don't have\nto actually keep switching back and\n\n396\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.590\nforth from this machine.\n\n397\n00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.940\nI can now control their desktop from here.\n\n398\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.040\nSo notice that I can actually click and\nmove things around.\n\n399\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.220\nI can go to start,\nI can open up the calculator,\n\n400\n00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.570\nI can bring up the command prompt,\nand start helping out and\n\n401\n00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:45.310\nyou actually see where it's\nactually working just like that.\n\n402\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:50.000\nAnd if I needed to show them how to verify\nthe information or verify everything for\n\n403\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.700\nthem on the Remote Desktop connection,\nI can right-click, and\n\n404\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.750\ngo to Properties, and\ngo to the remote settings there.\n\n405\n00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.730\nAnd I can see whether or\nnot they're actually allowed.\n\n406\n00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:07.022\nAnd then from that point,\nsay yes, you look, and\n\n407\n00:21:07.022 --> 00:21:13.802\nit looks like I can connect to you\n\n408\n00:21:17.608 --> 00:21:21.566\nIf I need to and then I'd also check\nmy end if they wanted to connect to me.\n\n409\n00:21:21.566 --> 00:21:22.129\nWe're not gonna do that.\n\n410\n00:21:22.129 --> 00:21:25.409\nBut that's what we can actually do\nis show them right where it is and\n\n411\n00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:28.290\nthat way they can actually see\nwhere everything is set up.\n\n412\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:33.425\nAnd at any time if they do not like what's\ngoing on, even in the middle of doing\n\n413\n00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:39.034\nsomething, they can always hit the Esc key\non their computers, and normally, that\n\n414\n00:21:39.034 --> 00:21:44.110\nkicks them out of that remote session,\nor they can select the stop sharing.\n\n415\n00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.650\nThey can even pause that if they want to,\nand that way you stop seeing it.\n\n416\n00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.800\nThey might do that if they're typing in a\npassword, or something they don't want you\n\n417\n00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.400\nto actually see, it might actually go\nahead and do something like that as well.\n\n418\n00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.870\nSo on each side, right, you actually have\nthat ability to control that window.\n\n419\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.470\nSo once everything is done and over with,\nthen you've actually disconnected.\n\n420\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.600\nYou normally of course do a little reading\nsaying, hey if everything is done.\n\n421\n00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.240\nAnd close out this support ticket.\n\n422\n00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.500\nAnd hopefully if you need any more\nassistance just drop another invitation\n\n423\n00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.860\nand we'll be ready to go.\n\n424\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:17.860\n>> Absolutely so you see it's a really\nneat idea because unlike remote desktop,\n\n425\n00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.070\na user seeing what I'm doing.\n\n426\n00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.210\nWhen we first connect, when we first\nrespond to that invitation, and\n\n427\n00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.270\nthey allow us to connect with the machine,\nwe can't do anything other than observe.\n\n428\n00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.920\nSo, we can sit there and\nchat with them and\n\n429\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.300\nwe can have them walk through the problem\nand we can see what's going on.\n\n430\n00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.000\nAnd we might just talk\nto them using that chat.\n\n431\n00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.410\nSit and explain to them what to do or\nwhat they shouldn't do or what have you.\n\n432\n00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.820\nIf it gets to the point where they're\nnot understanding what I'm saying, and\n\n433\n00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.570\nI need to take control,\nI've got that capability.\n\n434\n00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.630\nBut the end user has\nthe ability to say yes or no.\n\n435\n00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.960\nSo it's making them feel comfortable,\nright.\n\n436\n00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.800\nThat you're not immediately\njust taking over their machine.\n\n437\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.410\nThey're in control of that.\n\n438\n00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.830\nThey can allow you to take over their\nmachine and start moving their mouse, and\n\n439\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.820\nif it gets to any point where they think\nyou're going somewhere you shouldn't be,\n\n440\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.870\nor gonna see something they don't\nwant you to see, they can hit Esc or\n\n441\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.550\nclick that button up there and\nend your control immediately.\n\n442\n00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.075\nYou can't copy files from them.\n\n443\n00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:12.385\nYou can send them files,\nbut only if they accept it.\n\n444\n00:23:12.385 --> 00:23:14.115\nSo again, they're in control.\n\n445\n00:23:14.115 --> 00:23:16.635\nThey decide what's being\ndone to their machine.\n\n446\n00:23:16.635 --> 00:23:18.605\nSo that makes them a lot more comfortable.\n\n447\n00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:22.080\nLike when you're doing corporate support,\nor if you're a a third party support\n\n448\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.120\nprovider, and people are coming\nto you that you don't know.\n\n449\n00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.500\nThey don't know you,\nthey just hired you for support.\n\n450\n00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.740\nThat leaves them in that,\nthat gives them that feeling of control,\n\n451\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.020\nwhich is gonna make them\nfeel better about it, and\n\n452\n00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.300\nwe can use it as a learning experience,\nespecially in a corporate environment\n\n453\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.320\nwhere I'm trying to avoid\nthe calls to the helpdesk, right?\n\n454\n00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.652\nI'm not making money, I don't want them\nto have to come back to me every day for\n\n455\n00:23:41.652 --> 00:23:42.473\nthe same problem.\n\n456\n00:23:42.473 --> 00:23:44.774\nI hope we don't do that in the business,\neither, but\n\n457\n00:23:44.774 --> 00:23:47.906\nI can teach them what's going on,\nand that makes them more productive.\n\n458\n00:23:47.906 --> 00:23:51.322\nCuz that means their computer\nis not gonna be down as much,\n\n459\n00:23:51.322 --> 00:23:53.562\nbecause they can see what I'm doing.\n\n460\n00:23:53.562 --> 00:23:55.492\nSo it's just a really neat idea.\n\n461\n00:23:55.492 --> 00:23:59.902\n>> It really is a great little technology\nthat works whether you're in a small\n\n462\n00:23:59.902 --> 00:24:04.250\noffice or whether you're actually\nvery remote, or in a large office,.\n\n463\n00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:08.180\nBecause now, you actually can\neffectively be at someone's desktop and\n\n464\n00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.100\nactually have the interaction Without\nactually having to be there for 15 or\n\n465\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.330\n20 of them, and you might say,\nwhy is that bad?\n\n466\n00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.730\nWell what if you're running from one\nend of the building to the next end,\n\n467\n00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.610\nand then having to go all the away across.\n\n468\n00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.040\nHere you actually have a nice\nlittle console that will allow you\n\n469\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.970\nboth to be able to have that interaction.\n\n470\n00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:29.110\nIt used to be in Windows XP that you would\nalso try this voice Messaging thing,\n\n471\n00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.220\nand that just never worked out that well,\nand so\n\n472\n00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.830\nthey reduced it down to chat, which has\nactually worked a lot more effectively,\n\n473\n00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:39.050\nand you can see why, because easier to\nactually watch them do it and send simple\n\n474\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.970\nchat messages than to try and have that\nperson explain to you over the phone\n\n475\n00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.910\nJust like Mike was saying the terminology\nthey're using I don't even know what\n\n476\n00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.610\nthey're talking about here even if your\nwatching them on a chat's fairly simple.\n\n477\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.500\n>> What I need you to do is\nopen up a command prompt and\n\n478\n00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.200\ntype in IP config\n>> No, IP right?\n\n479\n00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.360\nI mean, no, it is no good.\n\n480\n00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.800\nSo this is really fantastic.\n\n481\n00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.420\nAnd to get back to that\nquestion from Douglas again So\n\n482\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.700\non the firewall side of things,\nyes you know,\n\n483\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:10.161\naccording to the according to\nMicrosoft you do need to allow 3389.\n\n484\n00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:12.543\nBecause that is the port\nit is going to be using.\n\n485\n00:25:12.543 --> 00:25:13.940\nYou look at the firewall.\n\n486\n00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.910\nIt ends up using some dynamic ports,\none in the 1200 range and a couple\n\n487\n00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.790\nof those for the actual connection,\nbut it is traveling across 3389.\n\n488\n00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:28.120\nBut I will tell you that when my mother\nand I did that connection from Tampa\n\n489\n00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.200\nto here to Gainesville I\ndid not have her go in and\n\n490\n00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.260\nopen up 3389\n>> On her firewall so it was I believe\n\n491\n00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:40.770\npackaging it up within a Port 80 or web\ntraffic and sending it across that way.\n\n492\n00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.390\nI'm not positive on that but\n\n493\n00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.380\nI did not have to walk her through\ncreating an exception on her firewalls.\n\n494\n00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.810\nSo it does a few interesting\nthings in the background there.\n\n495\n00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.630\nTo make sure that traffic goes through.\n\n496\n00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.350\nBut in for the exam for\nanything like that, yes troubleshoot\n\n497\n00:25:55.350 --> 00:26:00.300\nmake sure 3389 is open on any boarder\nrouters on your networks there.\n\n498\n00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.590\n>> Nice thing that we have done\nthat as a support technician right\n\n499\n00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.170\n>> Is an incredible tool built inside of\n\n500\n00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.520\nour operating system.\n\n501\n00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.800\nWhether we're talking about the remote\nassistance or any of the remote tools that\n\n502\n00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.030\nwe've been talking about, it really\nis actually a nice complete system\n\n503\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.180\nthat allows you to be able to do some\nadministration Allows you to be able to do\n\n504\n00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:23.300\nsome support without having to add\nadditional tools that are already built in\n\n505\n00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.440\nand you can't ask for better than\nthree a lot of times to help you out.\n\n506\n00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.090\n>> Yeah, and another thing I just thought\nof is that port might have already been\n\n507\n00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.840\nopen from her ISP so\nthat could've been the case there as well.\n\n508\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.690\n>> Right.\n\n509\n00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.810\n>> All right well Ronnie some great\ninformation there on remote assistance,\n\n510\n00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.110\nsomething that we can use to provide help.\n\n511\n00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.070\nTo people that are not next to us, right,\n\n512\n00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.360\ngive us that ability to do\nthat remote assistance.\n\n513\n00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.240\nAnd unlike remote desktop,\nit's not a one-sided thing.\n\n514\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.380\nThey can see what's going on,\nthey can even participate in the problem,\n\n515\n00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.920\nwell I shouldn't say the problem,\nbut the fixing of the problem.\n\n516\n00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.490\nWe can use it as a learning moment,\nwhich is one of my favorite things.\n\n517\n00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.730\nI hate it when people, you know, earlier\nin the show you were talking about just\n\n518\n00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.530\nmoving them out of the way and it reminds\nme of the old Saturday Night Live,\n\n519\n00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.920\nNick Burns skit where the IT comes in and\njust says, Move.\n\n520\n00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.670\nAnd he sits down and fixes your computer.\n\n521\n00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.230\nThe problem I have with that is.\n\n522\n00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.850\nThose are really funny you\nshould check them out.\n\n523\n00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.330\nBut the problem I had was that it doesn't\nteach the person anything, right?\n\n524\n00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.870\nWe don't want them to be IT people.\n\n525\n00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.810\nThey don't care to be IT people,\nbut there are some things they can\n\n526\n00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.910\nteach them that allow them to prevent\nthose problems in the future, and\n\n527\n00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:26.910\nthat's always a good thing.\n\n528\n00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.570\nAnd remote assistance is a tool\nthat allows me to do that,\n\n529\n00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.540\nwhich is One of the reasons\nI really like it.\n\n530\n00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.100\n>> Yeah, it is a neat tool, and\nwe're starting to see more and\n\n531\n00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.700\nmore of this kind of stuff.\n\n532\n00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.800\nLike I said you may go I don't\ncare about the Microsoft product.\n\n533\n00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.160\nThere are other products out there\nthat will do the same thing.\n\n534\n00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.390\nBut here it is,\nit's built into the operating system,\n\n535\n00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:48.510\nIf you have a chance to take advantage of\nit without having to add additional cost,\n\n536\n00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.730\nthere's a good way to do it.\n\n537\n00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.920\n>> I think,\nas David said in the chat room earlier,\n\n538\n00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.860\nsomething about the parental support.\n\n539\n00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.350\nThat's always gonna be\nsomething we have to do.\n\n540\n00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.025\nAnd in the business Business\nworld definitely, so.\n\n541\n00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:01.135\nAll right, well,\nanything else we want to throw in for\n\n542\n00:28:01.135 --> 00:28:03.705\nour remote assistance episode?\n\n543\n00:28:03.705 --> 00:28:05.495\n>> Not right now on remote assistance.\n\n544\n00:28:05.495 --> 00:28:06.575\n>> I think we covered it head to toe.\n\n545\n00:28:06.575 --> 00:28:07.905\nOh, you know what, one other thing, I did,\n\n546\n00:28:07.905 --> 00:28:12.460\nwe did talk about, make sure we mentioned\nOffering support, right, instead of, yeah,\n\n547\n00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.650\nwe did talk about that, yeah, cuz I wanted\nto make sure, remember you're normally\n\n548\n00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:19.480\nthe helpee, the one that needs\nthe help can send out the invitation.\n\n549\n00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.220\nIn a corporate world,\n\n550\n00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.040\nwe can actually set it up where they\ndon't have to send the invitation.\n\n551\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.710\nThey might call the help desk, and\n\n552\n00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.170\nthen from the helper's side,\nI push out a request to help them.\n\n553\n00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.680\nSo we can do it both All right,\nwell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n554\n00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.410\nthat's gonna do it for remote assistance.\n\n555\n00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.210\nWe are glad you tuned in\nto watch the episode.\n\n556\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.560\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n557\n00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.360\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n558\n00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.390\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

and\n\n3\n00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:15.951\nwith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:16.770\nHow are you Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.830\n>> I am doing well today.\n\n6\n00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.260\nIt's a hot day here in Florida.\n\n7\n00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.575\nAnd again, it means more air\nconditioning and more Windows 7 shows.\n\n8\n00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To continue to actually work through so\n\n9\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.490\nI'm actually good.\n\n10\n00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.110\n>> Good, good.\nIt is nice and\n\n11\n00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.530\ncool back here in the studio, isn't it?\n\n12\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.300\n>> It is.\n\n13\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.900\nAll right, so we've been doing\na lot of episodes that deal with\n\n14\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.000\nremote administration, and if you've\nmissed some of the previous episodes,\n\n15\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.220\nwe've gone over RSAT,\nthe Remote Serve Admin Tools,\n\n16\n00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.310\nwe've gone over remote desktop,\nas well as remote assistance.\n\n17\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.880\nToday we're going to be looking at another\nremote administration feature which is\n\n18\n00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.220\nrelatively new to the Windows environment.\n\n19\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.690\nAnd that is event subscriptions, right?\n\n20\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.510\nEvent subscriptions, we know that all\nof our Windows systems have event logs.\n\n21\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.420\nRight?\n\n22\n00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.240\nAnd hopefully we know\nthat we should go and\n\n23\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.170\nlook at those event logs when we're\ntrying to do some troubleshooting.\n\n24\n00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.830\nYou know Ronnie I always tell people,\nI know you've run into the same thing.\n\n25\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.310\nHey, I need help with my computer,\nsomething's wrong, or\n\n26\n00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.130\nthe server's not doing this,\nI don't know what the problem is.\n\n27\n00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.530\nHave you looked at the event logs, and\nwhat's usually the answer there, Ronnie?\n\n28\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.130\n>> No.\nThey have not normally looked at those\n\n29\n00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.590\nevent logs, and the reason why is\nthey open that event viewer, and\n\n30\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.060\nall of a sudden they go and\nlook in system, and\n\n31\n00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.150\nit says like 20,000 logs,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.670\n>> and all of a sudden you can feel their\n\n33\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.750\nheart sink.\n\n34\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.500\nAnd then they open up one and\nit says you need to check this and\n\n35\n00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.710\nit gives them a hexidecimal code and\na paragraph of stuff and\n\n36\n00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.110\nyou're like I don't even know what I'm\nlooking at so it can be a little bit\n\n37\n00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.010\noverwhelming in that sense, but the event\nlogs are the place where we're gonna\n\n38\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.780\nactually see everything that happens to\nour computer is going to be registered.\n\n39\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.080\nAnd so that's the place that you will\nactually see errors come in, and\n\n40\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.690\nthat's what you're looking for, and of\ncourse warnings, those will actually give\n\n41\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.000\nyou a bunch of the information that you\nneed to begin the troubleshooting too, and\n\n42\n00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880\nso you cannot overlook these\nthings as a technician.\n\n43\n00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.600\nIt's easy to think the same way\nthe menu does, they don't matter to me.\n\n44\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.350\nBut as a support technician,\n\n45\n00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.730\nas an administrator,\nthis is the first place that I go.\n\n46\n00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.500\nAnd even after I fix an issue,\nit's normally where I go, almost daily for\n\n47\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.710\na long time,\n\n48\n00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.040\nto verify that that particular event is\nnot popping up again once I've finished.\n\n49\n00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.680\nSo great place to go.\n\n50\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.590\n>> Absolutely.\n\n51\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.370\nThe event logs, these are where your\nsystem is designed to record events right?\n\n52\n00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.830\nSo if it's having trouble doing something\nthis is where you're gonna see it.\n\n53\n00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.140\nYou've got several different event logs.\n\n54\n00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.900\nMicrosoft has made big strides,\nbecause they know that those event\n\n55\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.490\nlogs in the early systems weren't all\nthat beneficial or useful sometimes.\n\n56\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.388\nLot of cryptic information was in there.\n\n57\n00:02:41.388 --> 00:02:43.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We didn't' get a lot of information.\n\n58\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.070\nWe had just our standard application log,\nsystem log, and\n\n59\n00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.070\nsecurity log, and\nthat was about all we had.\n\n60\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.600\nIf you look at the event log\nsystem today in Windows 7 and\n\n61\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.580\nlater It's a lot more\ndetailed information, as well\n\n62\n00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.860\nas access to all the operational logs for\ndifferent services and things like that.\n\n63\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.440\nSo, they've added a bunch of information,\nand great filtering capabilities\n\n64\n00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.740\nwithin the event log to be able\nto find what's important to you.\n\n65\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.840\nMaybe I just wanna see the errors and\nthe warnings,\n\n66\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.030\nI don't wanna see all\nthe informational events,\n\n67\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.860\nbecause those are things that\nare supposed to happen typically.\n\n68\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.540\nSo great filtering capabilities.\n\n69\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.540\nBut, one of the downsides of the event\nlog system in windows has always been,\n\n70\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.560\nit's a local thing.\n\n71\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.120\nThat means, if I'm managing five\nDNS servers, then I need to go to\n\n72\n00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.760\neach one of those DNS servers and look at\nit's event logs and see what's going on.\n\n73\n00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.160\nYou know, if that's my job then, then\nremoting into each one, one at a time, or\n\n74\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.140\nwhat have you.\n\n75\n00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.000\nLooking at event logs here, then going\nto the next one, looking at event logs.\n\n76\n00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.270\nGo to the next one, looking at event logs.\n\n77\n00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.070\nIt was a very tedious process,\n\n78\n00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.240\nwell now Microsoft gives us\nthe ability to do event subscriptions.\n\n79\n00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.559\nThat means I can subscribe to\nanother machine's event logs.\n\n80\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.000\nSo I can be sitting here\nat my Windows 7 desktop and\n\n81\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.750\nI can have a subscription to those\nfive DNS server's event logs.\n\n82\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.270\nAnd I can use the same filtering\ncapabilities that I have when I go in and\n\n83\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.450\nI view the event log.\n\n84\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.100\nThose event logs from those\nfive different DNS servers\n\n85\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.770\nare gonna be sent back\nto my Windows 7 box.\n\n86\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.630\nAnd I can sit here, log into my machine,\nand my little cubicle at work, and\n\n87\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.250\nI can read those event\nlogs from right here and\n\n88\n00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.950\nit makes it a much easier thing and\nnow I'm more apt to check them everyday.\n\n89\n00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.150\nAnd if I'm checking them everyday,\nI don't have to worry about coming in and\n\n90\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.600\nfinding five hundred thousand events,\nyou know,\n\n91\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.810\nthat I haven't seen,\nbecause I'm doing it on a regular basis.\n\n92\n00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.890\nAll right, so let's take a look at how\nwe can set up these event subscriptions.\n\n93\n00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.980\nI've got my domain control pulled up here.\n\n94\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.080\nActually, before we do that,\n\n95\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.880\nlet me make sure we're good with the\nterminology that I'm getting ready to use.\n\n96\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.700\nWhen we set up a subscription we\nare going to have one machine,\n\n97\n00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.020\nthat we want the event logs to show up on.\n\n98\n00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.860\nLike, typically I'm going to be\nsitting on my desk top, or my lap top,\n\n99\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.850\nmy Window 7 box, and\nI'm going to pull the event logs,\n\n100\n00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.430\nfrom say, all the DNS servers\nthat I am responsible for.\n\n101\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.650\nBut it doesn't have to server\ncould be other clients.\n\n102\n00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.250\nMaybe I manage the sale\ndepartment computers, and\n\n103\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.770\nI get all their event logs sent to me.\n\n104\n00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.510\nWell, the computer that I'm sitting at\nthe one that I wanna be able to sit at and\n\n105\n00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.590\nread the log files.\n\n106\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.030\nThat is the collector.\n\n107\n00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.130\nWe're gonna be collecting up\nlog files from other machines.\n\n108\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.560\nThose other machines,\nthose are the source computers.\n\n109\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.940\nThe ones we're gonna\nget the log files from.\n\n110\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.550\nAnd there's different commands that\nwe have to do on the source, versus\n\n111\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.880\nthe collectors, we need to make sure\nwe keep those straight in our minds or\n\n112\n00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.190\nif you get an exam question or\nsomething like that, gotta get that right.\n\n113\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.640\nSo right now I'm on, I'm gonna use\nDC1 as my source and I'm gonna use my\n\n114\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.510\nWindows 7 tech machine as my collector,\nthe one that I sit at every day.\n\n115\n00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.190\nSo I'm on one of my source computers.\n\n116\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.090\nAnd the first thing we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna open up command prompt, and\n\n117\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.480\nI'm gonna make sure that\nWindows Remote Management is enabled.\n\n118\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.110\nSo I've pulled up the command prompt,\nthen I'll bump up that font for\n\n119\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.109\nyou just a wee bit so\nit'll make it a bit little more legible.\n\n120\n00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.690\nAnd the command is a simple one.\n\n121\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.740\nWinRM, which stands for\nWindows Remote Management,\n\n122\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.010\nspace quickconfig, and\nthat quickconfig is all one word.\n\n123\n00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.540\nAll right?\n\n124\n00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.720\nNow, if it's already running as you can\nsee it is on this domain controller,\n\n125\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.380\nthen we're good to go.\n\n126\n00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.270\nIt's not gonna hurt it to\nrun the command again,\n\n127\n00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.380\nit gives me that chance to verify\nthat it's already running.\n\n128\n00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.670\nWinRM is already running.\n\n129\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.100\nWinRM is already set up for\nremote management.\n\n130\n00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.828\nOn this computer, so I'm good to go.\n\n131\n00:06:23.828 --> 00:06:24.810\nThat's step one.\n\n132\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.170\nYou have to do that on\neach source computer, so\n\n133\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.780\nif I had four other domain controllers\nthat I wanted to pull the log files from,\n\n134\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.290\nI'd go to each one of them and\nI'd run that command.\n\n135\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.090\nThe second thing I'm gonna need to do,\nI'm done with my command prompt,\n\n136\n00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.720\nI'll close that, is I need to make sure\nthat the collector, right, the machine\n\n137\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.490\nthat I'm sitting at has permissions\nto reach out and get those log files.\n\n138\n00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.350\nEven though WinRM has opened up the ports\nand it's now listening for those requests,\n\n139\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.186\nI still have to make sure that\nthe machine, my collector has permissions.\n\n140\n00:06:55.186 --> 00:07:00.030\nNow in the past we would\njust add these collector\n\n141\n00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.220\ncomputer to the local admin's group\non all of the source computers.\n\n142\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.770\nBut that doesn't follow\nthe principle of lease privilege.\n\n143\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.190\nThere's really no reason to put that\ncomputer in the local admin's account\n\n144\n00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.930\nor group.\n\n145\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.550\nSo Microsoft added a new group that's\nknow as the event log reader's group.\n\n146\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.750\nAnd now remember on domain controllers\nyou don't have local groups so\n\n147\n00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.440\nit is going to be an active directory.\n\n148\n00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.520\nAnd if we go to a server that wasn't\na domain controller I'd look at my local\n\n149\n00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.140\ngroups and find that there.\n\n150\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.310\nSo I'm gonna open up active directory and\n\n151\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:36.540\nin that built in container I can find\nthe event log readers group, there it is.\n\n152\n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.370\nI'm gonna pull up the properties and\ntake a look at the members tab.\n\n153\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.930\nAnd I'm simply going to click Add.\n\n154\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.883\nNow, remember, this box doesn't look for\ncomputers by default and\n\n155\n00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.461\nI need to add the computer.\n\n156\n00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:51.647\nRemember, not my account,\nnot the person that's logging on,\n\n157\n00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:53.980\nthe computer that's collecting those.\n\n158\n00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.153\nThe collector computer account\nis the one we're adding.\n\n159\n00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:59.810\nSo, I'm gonna come over here and\nchoose computers, click OK,\n\n160\n00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.890\nand then I should be able to find\nmy tech workstation there, TECH01.\n\n161\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.900\nAnd so now, TECH01 is a member\nof the event log readers group.\n\n162\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.050\nOn this domain controller I click OK.\n\n163\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.780\nSo again, two big steps there\nyou have to do on each on\n\n164\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.410\neach source computer, not just one.\n\n165\n00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.760\nOn each one of them you have\nto make sure you enable WinRM,\n\n166\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.530\nthe Widows Remote Management, and\n\n167\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.250\nadd the collector to the event log\nreader's group on that machine.\n\n168\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.970\n>> Now Mike, can you go back to that\nwindow that you were just on to add\n\n169\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.305\nthe event log reader?\n\n170\n00:08:29.305 --> 00:08:32.822\n[CROSSTALK] Absolutely we'll\ngo back into active directory.\n\n171\n00:08:32.822 --> 00:08:37.219\n>> I just wanted to point out something\nthat can get confusing at times especially\n\n172\n00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:41.547\nif you might not be on a server machine to\nbe able to do that when you actually add\n\n173\n00:08:41.547 --> 00:08:42.830\nthat group in.\n\n174\n00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.580\nThat when you go and\nadd in that computer to that group,\n\n175\n00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.250\nsometimes you might actually go to\na machine that's not doing this, and\n\n176\n00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.350\nall of a sudden you go, well, it doesn't\ngive me the option to add computers in.\n\n177\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.000\nI see users, but\nI don't see the ability to have computers.\n\n178\n00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.160\nMike, what could be happening there?\n\n179\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.360\n>> And that's what I was saying.\n\n180\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.280\nWhen you open up this dialogue box, by\ndefault, it does not look for computers.\n\n181\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.220\nSo I have to go to object types and\nmake sure I choose computers.\n\n182\n00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.580\n>> Okay yeah sometimes its\nnot checked a lot of times so\n\n183\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.580\njust be careful if you've done like\nI did I was like I don't know where\n\n184\n00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.820\nI can't find a computer\nthat's what you do.\n\n185\n00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.325\n>> Absolutely because if\nI leave that unchecked\n\n186\n00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:18.530\n>> [LAUGH] And I go to find my laptop and\n\n187\n00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.750\nadd it to this group I'll say tech check\nnames and it should be able to find it\n\n188\n00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.540\nit says nope I can't find anything\nthat starts with tech because its only\n\n189\n00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.330\nlooking for users service accounts\ngroups built in security principals\n\n190\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.120\n>> Or other objects, and\n\n191\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.430\nstrange as it may seem, a computer is\nnot an other object, it is its own type.\n\n192\n00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.760\nSo, you have to click object types,\ninclude computers, click okay, and\n\n193\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.650\nthen all of a sudden,\nit's able to find that computer for us.\n\n194\n00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.760\nAll right, so\nnow we've got that added in, so\n\n195\n00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.960\nthe source computer at\nthis point is set up.\n\n196\n00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.270\nNext thing we're going to do is I'm going\nto go to the collector, that'll be the one\n\n197\n00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.190\nthat I want to Sit at and be able\nto read all these remote log files.\n\n198\n00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.800\nSo here's my little Windows 7 box\nin my cubicle that I sit everyday.\n\n199\n00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.760\nAnd I'm gonna again open up a command\nprompt, and we'll give it Admin access.\n\n200\n00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:10.034\nBump up that font just a hair,\n\n201\n00:10:10.034 --> 00:10:13.880\nwhere we can see this when we're\nwatching that beautiful recording.\n\n202\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.210\nAll right, and the command is different.\n\n203\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:20.470\nNow on the source I ran\nWinRM space quick config.\n\n204\n00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:28.120\nOn the collector, I'm going to be running\nWECutil, short for Windows Event.\n\n205\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.760\nCollector utility, easy to remember if\nyou think about what it stands for.\n\n206\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.760\nwecutil and you can do a qc on this one,\nwhich is just a short for quick config.\n\n207\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.230\nSo I'll just go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n208\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.720\nAnd it says the service mode or\n\n209\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.380\nthe service startup mode is\ngonna be changed to Delay Start,\n\n210\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.650\nthat means it's going to automatically\nstart if I reboot this machine.\n\n211\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.610\nIt is going to be a delayed start,\nit'll let other services start first,\n\n212\n00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.000\nthen this guy'll kick in.\n\n213\n00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.970\nSo I just do a Y for yes, and I hit enter.\n\n214\n00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.170\nAnd it tells me that Windows Event\nCollector service was configured\n\n215\n00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.560\nsuccessfully.\n\n216\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.460\nSo that's the command I need to run on\nthe collector giving my computer again,\n\n217\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.520\nthe ability to go out and\nreach out and grab those log files.\n\n218\n00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.700\nSo now we're set up.\n\n219\n00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.330\nI would run the WinRM Quick Config\non each source computer.\n\n220\n00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.860\nI've run the WEC Util on the collector.\n\n221\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.150\nOnce I've got that done, now it's just\na matter of making the subscription,\n\n222\n00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.500\ndeciding what machines.\n\n223\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.410\nAnd it's gonna be my source machines.\n\n224\n00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.490\nSetting up the subscription\nto that source machine.\n\n225\n00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.170\nAnd deciding what events I wanna collect.\n\n226\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.770\nRight?\nSo all I'm gonna do.\n\n227\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.260\nIs open, I'm on the collector,\nright, the machine I sit at.\n\n228\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.570\nAnd I'm going to open\nup my event log system.\n\n229\n00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.730\nThat'll open up good\nold event viewer here.\n\n230\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.090\nAnd in my event viewer,\ngive it a chance to, you know,\n\n231\n00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.510\nyou got to wait for event viewer, because\nit's reading a lot of log files, and\n\n232\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.730\nit's giving you the summary\ninformation in this area up here.\n\n233\n00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.340\nSo sometimes it takes a minute to parse\nthose, to find the important stuff,\n\n234\n00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:55.920\ndump it in there.\n\n235\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.950\nSo, don't get impatient with this part.\n\n236\n00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:02.350\nLet it load up, and I can see the nice\nsummary that it builds for me there.\n\n237\n00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.570\nAll right, so now we have a node over here\nin my navigation tree on the left for\n\n238\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.030\nsubscriptions.\n\n239\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.180\nHandy enough,\nI'm gonna click on subscriptions.\n\n240\n00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.600\nI don't have any yet.\n\n241\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.270\nSo, I'm going to create a subscription.\n\n242\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.240\nOver here on the right,\nin the actions pane.\n\n243\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.350\nYou could also right-click\non Subscriptions, and\n\n244\n00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.010\nchoose Create Subscription.\n\n245\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:20.750\nYou can even, no,\n\n246\n00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.140\nthey won't let you right-click\nout in the middle, unfortunately.\n\n247\n00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.250\nSo either way, you wanna go,\nCreate Subscription.\n\n248\n00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.124\nAnd it's gonna launch a wizard,\nwhere I can give this a name, and\n\n249\n00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.980\nmaybe I call this Domain Controller.\n\n250\n00:12:35.813 --> 00:12:39.038\nAll right, I could give it\na description if I needed to, and\n\n251\n00:12:39.038 --> 00:12:41.340\nthen where do I want these events to go?\n\n252\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.100\nSo I'm gonna reach out and\n\n253\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.230\ngrab log entries from all my domain\ncontrollers, bring them back to my Windows\n\n254\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.480\n7 box Where do I want them to be when\nthey come back to my Windows 7 box?\n\n255\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.270\nI can choose any one of my\nexisting event logs, but\n\n256\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.240\nthere is one called forwarded events.\n\n257\n00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.720\nThat's typically what we use,\n\n258\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.390\nbut maybe you want to combine it up\nwith some other log for some reason.\n\n259\n00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.130\nI can also do collector initiated or\nsource computer initiated.\n\n260\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.820\nCollector initiated means my box\nperiodically is gonna reach out and talk\n\n261\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.890\nto that domain controller and say hey give\nme your log entries that I'm asking for.\n\n262\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.390\nSource initiated means the domain\ncontroller periodically would\n\n263\n00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.650\nJust send them without my box asking for\nthem, all right?\n\n264\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.330\nNow if you do source computer initiated\nthere's a few more things you actually\n\n265\n00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.250\nhave to go through.\n\n266\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.140\nA lot easier to do\nthe collector initiated.\n\n267\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.130\nthat's what we're gonna do here.\n\n268\n00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.175\nAnd all I have to do is tell it\nwho am I gonna reach out and\n\n269\n00:13:33.175 --> 00:13:34.635\nAdd the log files from.\n\n270\n00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:38.875\nSo I click select computers,\nand then add domain computers.\n\n271\n00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:41.985\nThere is a way to set this up\nwithin a workgroup environment that\n\n272\n00:13:41.985 --> 00:13:42.905\ninvolves a lot more.\n\n273\n00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:46.577\nYou've gotta set up some\ntrust between the machines.\n\n274\n00:13:46.577 --> 00:13:50.337\nAnd then I'm gonna browse and\nfind the source computer.\n\n275\n00:13:50.337 --> 00:13:52.457\nNow this is that same search dialogue box,\nbut\n\n276\n00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.547\nnotice it already says computer up here.\n\n277\n00:13:54.547 --> 00:13:58.377\nSo I don't need to go to object types,\nbecause computer is already selected.\n\n278\n00:13:58.377 --> 00:14:00.517\nIn fact,\nthat's all it's gonna let me find.\n\n279\n00:14:00.517 --> 00:14:05.260\nSo I'm going to find that machine,\nDC01 It found it, it underlined it,\n\n280\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:05.940\nwe're good to go.\n\n281\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.120\nI click OK, and\nnow it's got that computer in there.\n\n282\n00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.600\nIf I had four more domain controllers, I\nwould add each one of those to this list.\n\n283\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.040\nThe other thing it let's\nyou do is run a test.\n\n284\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.900\nSo, once I've added it, I can click test.\n\n285\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.590\nAnd connectivity test succeeded.\n\n286\n00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.570\nThat lets me know that I ran\nthat Winrm quickconfig and\n\n287\n00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.860\nthat I can successfully reach out,\ntalk to that machine.\n\n288\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.540\nPorts are open, he's listening,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n289\n00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.230\nSo everything works there, we'll click OK.\n\n290\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.120\nAnd OK.\n\n291\n00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.300\nSo now it knows which machine to go\ntalk to to get the log files from.\n\n292\n00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.560\nIt knows where to put those\nlog files when it gets it.\n\n293\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.750\nThe only thing I have left is\nto tell it what do I want.\n\n294\n00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.760\nRight?\nCuz I definitely don't want everything.\n\n295\n00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.452\nRight?\nThere's a lot of log files.\n\n296\n00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:47.226\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On that domain controller, and\n\n297\n00:14:47.226 --> 00:14:48.280\nI don't need all of that.\n\n298\n00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.660\nWhat I can do now is go down and\nconfigure my.\n\n299\n00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.600\nFilter, so\nI can choose which events I get to see.\n\n300\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.810\nSo I'm gonna click Select Events, and\n\n301\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.520\nthen I can choose what events\ndo I want to get back.\n\n302\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.590\nNow, this is kind of a cool option,\nRonnie, cuz If I do this everyday,\n\n303\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.710\nthen maybe I only want to see\nthe last 24 hours, right?\n\n304\n00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.580\nI don't need to see anything older than\nthat because I would have saw them\n\n305\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.570\nyesterday when I checked the log files, or\nmaybe I need to see the last 7 days, or\n\n306\n00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:20.270\nthe last month, and\nI can even do a custom range if I need to.\n\n307\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.850\nI'll go ahead and\njust leave it on anytime for\n\n308\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.880\nthis lab to make sure we get some stuff,\nbut you can definitely filter that down.\n\n309\n00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.610\nYou can also choose what\nevent level you wanna get.\n\n310\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.100\nI don't really need the informationals.\n\n311\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.440\nThose are typically good things, right?\n\n312\n00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.560\nHey, this service successfully started.\n\n313\n00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.200\nBlah blah blah, those kind of things,\nI don't need those.\n\n314\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.480\nI just want to see all the errors and\n\n315\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.750\nwarnings that are coming\nfrom that remote machine.\n\n316\n00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:45.250\nSo I'm going to check critical,\nand warnings, and errors.\n\n317\n00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.283\nNow, for this lab, I'm going to go ahead\nand choose informational as well, because\n\n318\n00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:53.035\nI want to make sure that we get something\nback, and if there were no errors on that\n\n319\n00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:57.198\ndomain controller within our timeframe,\nI wouldn't see any messages there, right?\n\n320\n00:15:57.198 --> 00:15:59.299\nSo I'm doing that just for\nthis lab purpose.\n\n321\n00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:00.299\nOr maybe you do.\n\n322\n00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:01.818\nMaybe you need to see it all.\n\n323\n00:16:01.818 --> 00:16:02.643\nAlright.\n\n324\n00:16:02.643 --> 00:16:05.999\nAnd then what log files do I\nwant to get the events from?\n\n325\n00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:10.019\nAnd you can see, I've got my standard\nWindows logs, my security, my system,\n\n326\n00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:13.350\nand my application, I can go ahead and\nchoose all of those.\n\n327\n00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.020\nOr maybe my job is just to\nmonitor that application log.\n\n328\n00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.930\nOr I can even dive into\na particular service log.\n\n329\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:20.990\nLike I can go down here and find.\n\n330\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:26.850\nFind, say, group policies operational log,\nand I could choose that one.\n\n331\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.260\nSo we can get very specific on what log\nfiles I want to pull these events from.\n\n332\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.320\n>> This is a very good idea, because\nremember, if we grab everything, it's\n\n333\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.260\n>> This really gonna pull everything.\n\n334\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.980\nAnd you might think, well,\nwhat's the big deal?\n\n335\n00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.740\nWell, if you have multiple computers\nselected to be the source.\n\n336\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.810\nIn other words,\nthe one that's gonna be sending.\n\n337\n00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.780\nWell now it's gonna conglomerate\nall those logs into that one area.\n\n338\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.880\nGood luck in trying to feel for\nit out after you actually have it.\n\n339\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.650\nSo yeah, there's a lot.\n\n340\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.650\n>> You could end up having\na lot of entries in there.\n\n341\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.970\nAll right, and the other cool thing,\n\n342\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.870\nyou might have noticed,\nI can choose more than one.\n\n343\n00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.690\nI didn't just use group policy,\nI've got application, system Setup,\n\n344\n00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.240\nwhy am I gonna do Setup,\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n345\n00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.620\nSecurity, System, and\nthe Group Policy log.\n\n346\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.560\nSo I can choose more than one log\nfile to pull those events from.\n\n347\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.010\nSo now it knows what I want to get, when\nI want to get them, what type of events,\n\n348\n00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.240\nwhat event logs I'm gonna pull from,\nI could do more filtering down here if I\n\n349\n00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.250\nwanted to filter by keyword or particular\nevent id or something like that.\n\n350\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.960\nWe could do that as well.\n\n351\n00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.660\nI'll click OK.\n\n352\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.440\nAnd now it knows what events I wanna get.\n\n353\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.860\nThe last thing down here is my.\n\n354\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.040\nAdvanced, and here I could choose\nto use a different account.\n\n355\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.890\nI've already added the machine account\nto that event log readers group, so\n\n356\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.380\nthe machine account is what I want to\nuse and I'm not going to change it.\n\n357\n00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.780\nbelow that, though,\nis my event delivery optimization.\n\n358\n00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.420\nI've got three choices here.\n\n359\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.150\nI've got normal, minimized bandwidth,\nand minimized latency.\n\n360\n00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.660\nWith the normal.\n\n361\n00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.130\n>> Its basically gonna be\nevery 15 what is it 15\n\n362\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:06.970\nseconds 15 minutes sorry forgot it for\na second every 15 minutes\n\n363\n00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.195\nis what it should do it should\npull those log files back.\n\n364\n00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:13.875\nIt's assuming that there's no bandwidth\nissues on your network or anything like\n\n365\n00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:18.055\nthat and it can take full advantage of\nit and do it every fifteen minutes.\n\n366\n00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:21.065\nIt batches them up it\nbasically saves events up and\n\n367\n00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:23.290\nthen sends them every fifteen.\n\n368\n00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.830\nIf I choose that minimum, or\n\n369\n00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.800\nminimize bandwidth, well now I'm telling\nit hey I don't have a lot of bandwidth,\n\n370\n00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.330\nI can't have you sending these\nlog files every 15 minutes.\n\n371\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.620\nMaybe it's across the demand dial VPN and\nconnection from a branch office.\n\n372\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.240\nI don't need that thing being pulled up\nevery 15 minutes, I'm being charged for\n\n373\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.480\nall of that.\n\n374\n00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.750\nSo it goes, if you choose that one.\n\n375\n00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.480\nIt's gonna be six hours\nbetween pulling those.\n\n376\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.960\nWhich maybe that's fine, right?\n\n377\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.390\nI come in every morning and\nI read them, but\n\n378\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.560\nI don't look at them again all day long.\n\n379\n00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.740\nSo I don't need them every 15 minutes.\n\n380\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.670\nI'm not going to check them\nuntil the next morning anyway.\n\n381\n00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.210\nThe last one is minimize latency.\n\n382\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.910\nWhich is going to drop it\ndown to every thirty seconds,\n\n383\n00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.110\nwhich is what it's supposed to batch to.\n\n384\n00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.080\nAnd that's actually what I'm going\nto chose to try to speed it up for\n\n385\n00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.380\nthis lab environment.\n\n386\n00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.230\nBut again, no bandwidth issues, I can\nsend them as often as I need to there and\n\n387\n00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.190\nit's a good option.\n\n388\n00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.160\nLike I said, if it's a local machine\non the same local network And\n\n389\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.220\nyou need to see those\nevents as they occur.\n\n390\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.420\nYou know, if you're monitoring for\na critical reason,\n\n391\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.110\nthere's some kind of problem and\n\n392\n00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.190\nyou need to see those events as they\noccur, that's the one you want to use.\n\n393\n00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:30.310\nIf you're just doing it to peruse\nthrough the events from yesterday to see\n\n394\n00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.280\nif anything happened,\nlike scans or something like that.\n\n395\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.380\nMaybe use that minimize\nbandwidth option there.\n\n396\n00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.180\nI'm gonna leave it on that\ndefault port number as well.\n\n397\n00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.990\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nclick okay and that's it.\n\n398\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.620\nThat's pretty much all I have to do.\n\n399\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.839\nSo we'll click okay on that.\n\n400\n00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.900\nAnd it tells me I've gotta reconfigure.\n\n401\n00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.530\nWe have a firewall exception.\n\n402\n00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.360\nAnd I'll go ahead and choose Yes for that.\n\n403\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.780\nSo we cleared up that error, we made sure\nthat exception was made in the firewall.\n\n404\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.700\nEverything looks good,\nwe'll click close and\n\n405\n00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.330\nnow we should be able to go\nover to my forwarded events.\n\n406\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.630\nAnd there we go.\n\n407\n00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.590\nSo these are the events that you can see.\n\n408\n00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.200\nAnd this computer column over here, this\nis telling me where they're coming from.\n\n409\n00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.040\nRemember, I might have\na subscription to multiple machines.\n\n410\n00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.750\nI might be responsible for monitoring\nfive different domain controllers,\n\n411\n00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.730\nfive different DNS servers, what have you.\n\n412\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.210\nSo it's important I know which\nmachine those events came from, right?\n\n413\n00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.440\nSo over here in the computer\ncolumn I get that.\n\n414\n00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.600\nAnd I can use my standard filtering tools.\n\n415\n00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.520\nif I had more than one machine sending\nevent logs to me, I could come over\n\n416\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.690\nhere and filter it and say, look, I just\nwant to see the events in the last ten\n\n417\n00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:42.540\nminutes from dc1, for example, if I\nsuspected there was a problem over there.\n\n418\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.440\nOr something like that.\n\n419\n00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.780\nSo that's Event Log subscriptions.\n\n420\n00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.240\nIt gives me the ability\nto pull those event logs\n\n421\n00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.580\nfrom multiple systems into one place.\n\n422\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.230\nAnd there's a couple advantages to that.\n\n423\n00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.540\nOne, I don't have to remote desktop\ninto each one of those machines and\n\n424\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.280\nread the event logs individually.\n\n425\n00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.120\nThey're all being sent right here so\n\n426\n00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.090\nnow I'm more apt to actually check\nthe event log right and see things\n\n427\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.200\nbefore they become a problem that I have\nto deal with I can spot a warning and\n\n428\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.640\nsay okay lets deal with this now\nbefore it becomes and error.\n\n429\n00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.420\nTwo Think about the bad guys.\n\n430\n00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.450\nWhen they break into a machine, one of\ntheir last steps is to cover their tracks.\n\n431\n00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.210\nthey try to clear event logs.\n\n432\n00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.210\nThey can clear them.\n\n433\n00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.980\nThey're still gonna be recorded\nhere on my machine now as well.\n\n434\n00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.040\nSo now I've got those events\nin two different places.\n\n435\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.170\n>> The hard part about the event logs and\ngetting everything ready is that you can\n\n436\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.510\nactually get everything set up and\n>> Everything can look good,\n\n437\n00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.040\nand it's waiting.\n\n438\n00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.370\nIt's actually the time period that it\ntakes to get some of those event logs\n\n439\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.280\ncoming in, and it can be very frustrating.\n\n440\n00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.350\nThere's no easy to sit there and go all\nright, let me make it happen immediately.\n\n441\n00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.160\nSometimes you think it's just gonna\nhappen immediately, and it may.\n\n442\n00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.060\n>> Sometimes, though, we can wait 15\nminutes before things end up happening.\n\n443\n00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.190\nSo you just never know and\nthat's really what it came down to,\n\n444\n00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.040\nis that you have to be a little bit\npatient when you have these things, and if\n\n445\n00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.960\nyou're patient enough don't get frustrated\nand you know, just keep changing things.\n\n446\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.380\nJust let it do its thing.\n\n447\n00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.490\nWe find out things actually do work well.\n\n448\n00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:04.470\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n449\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.720\nWell said Ronnie.\n\n450\n00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.250\n>> All right.\n\n451\n00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.120\nWell, anything else you wanna\nthrow in on our log subscriptions?\n\n452\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.850\n>> Not really.\nJust remember that this is\n\n453\n00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.790\none of those tools that you go, I don't\nknow if I'll ever use that and you'll\n\n454\n00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:18.670\nfind yourself when there are multiple\ndifferent logs that you have to monitor.\n\n455\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.210\nIt's a great way to do it without\nhaving to actually running around and\n\n456\n00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.750\nactually having to connect\nto multiple computers.\n\n457\n00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.280\nIt's a great thing to have on your system.\n\n458\n00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:30.960\n>> Absolutely, well ladies and gentleman\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodick.\n\n459\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.789\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n460\n00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:37.110\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:16.760\nI'm your host Mike Broderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.770\nHow are you doing Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.600\n>> I'm doing fine today.\n\n6\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.910\nIt's another beautiful day to be here in\nthe studio because we get to take a look\n\n7\n00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.740\nat some Windows 7 content, specifically\ntaking a look at resource access.\n\n8\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.890\nSo, it's a lot of material for\nus to cover today.\n\n9\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.470\n>> Absolutely.\n\n10\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.560\nIt's one of my more loved Topics, I think.\n\n11\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.660\nI really do like this part because,\nit comes down to it as an IT person,\n\n12\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.810\nas a help desk person, one of our jobs is\nto make sure the users can do their job,\n\n13\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.150\nwhich means they've got to have access\nto all the resources they need.\n\n14\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.110\nSo a big part of that is understanding\nhow they're accessing those resources And\n\n15\n00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.310\nhow we can control access.\n\n16\n00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.080\nBecause, again, our job is to make sure\nthey can access the resources they need\n\n17\n00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.830\nand in a secure fashion.\n\n18\n00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.340\nThat's one of the big keys there.\n\n19\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.600\nAnd when I say a secure fashion,\n\n20\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.620\nI don't mean encrypting the connection and\nusing ipsec or something like that.\n\n21\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.280\nI mean, if you should have read\npermission, that's all you get.\n\n22\n00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.550\nIf you should be able to make\nchanges to that document, you can.\n\n23\n00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.990\nIf you need more control or if it needs\nto be accessed across the network.\n\n24\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.450\nThen you can right that's what we've\ngotta do we gotta make sure because that\n\n25\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.520\nprevents people from making changes\nto documents that they shouldn't be\n\n26\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.920\nable to change or accessing resources that\nthey don't have any business accessing so\n\n27\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.010\nthat's a big challenge and\nit is one of our primary duties.\n\n28\n00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.820\nIt is one of the more challenging\naspects of actually supporting users\n\n29\n00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.330\nin the end that you actually have to\nworry about it, because there are so\n\n30\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.440\nmany different levels of permissions\nthat we can actually set.\n\n31\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.680\nAnd sometimes if you haven't\nbeen dealing with it,\n\n32\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.630\nit's not because you haven't been dealing\nwith it as far as all the details go,\n\n33\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.950\nyou just don't know all the possibilities\nthat there are And so today we do want\n\n34\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.490\nto take a look specifically at the idea\nof access control, and looking really at\n\n35\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.040\npermissions, because permissions, at least\nwhen I got started, it seemed easy enough\n\n36\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.050\nwhenever I heard anybody explain,\noh yeah, that makes sense.\n\n37\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.510\nAnd then I'd go and try and do it and I'm\nlike, oh look I still can't get access in.\n\n38\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.430\nSo we want to make sure that we actually\nshow you a couple of demos as well.\n\n39\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.570\nI was just making sure that we\nhammer these points down because\n\n40\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.220\nthis is one of the easiest\nthings to get wrong.\n\n41\n00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.500\nThen when you get it wrong, all of sudden\nyou get it wrong on multiple people.\n\n42\n00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.190\nNow you're actually having a problem.\n\n43\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.250\nSo we want to make sure that we have\na good grasp on access control.\n\n44\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.450\n>> That phone will light up very quickly.\n\n45\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.100\n>> Oh, very quickly.\n\n46\n00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.180\n>> If people can't get to.\n\n47\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.040\nTo what they need to do their job, right?\n\n48\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.910\n>> All right, so let's start off then,\njust talking about permissions, and\n\n49\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.010\nthe first thing I want to explain is that\nthere are a couple set s of permissions\n\n50\n00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.500\nthat we're gonna be dealing with.\n\n51\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.530\nThere's what we call NTSF permissions,\nwhich are part of the file system itself,\n\n52\n00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.070\nthe NTSF file system.\n\n53\n00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.710\nAnd then there's also share permissions.\n\n54\n00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.930\nAnd they're separate,\nthey work together sort of,\n\n55\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.780\nwe're gonna end up combining them anyway,\nso\n\n56\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.940\nit's important for us to understand\nboth of those sets of permissions.\n\n57\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.270\nHow they work, what permissions\nwe have available to assign, and\n\n58\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.210\nwhat happens when we combine them.\n\n59\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.070\nAs well as when they're even checked,\nbecause that's gonna be different as well.\n\n60\n00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.670\nSo, let's start off, Ronnie,\nwith good old NTFS permissions and.\n\n61\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.120\nNow when we talk about NTFS permissions,\n\n62\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.410\nagain it's a property of\nthe file system itself.\n\n63\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.090\nRight?\n\n64\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.070\nWe learned back in A+ and\nthings like that,\n\n65\n00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.770\nthat we had different file\nsystems we could choose from.\n\n66\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.740\nAnd NTFS was the file system of choice,\nnot just because it was newer, but\n\n67\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.000\nbecause it gave us that\nability to control access.\n\n68\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.040\nRight?\n>> It really did.\n\n69\n00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.140\nIt actually gave us that ability\nto have different levels of\n\n70\n00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.220\npermissions that we could\nassign to objects or to files.\n\n71\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.360\nOn that type of filing system and that\nway if both you and I had access to that\n\n72\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.090\nsingle file, well I might actually have\nthe ability to just look at that file.\n\n73\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.880\nWhereas you might have the ability\nto be able to edit that file or\n\n74\n00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.100\nchange that file in some way without\nhaving to actually put a whole bunch of\n\n75\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.210\nextra structure in the place\nto make that work.\n\n76\n00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.320\nDepending on the file system to do it is\none of the ways that Windows has chosen to\n\n77\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.470\nreally just give us access to everything\nand to control access to everything and so\n\n78\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.690\nthis is an essential part of\nsomething that we have to understand.\n\n79\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.710\nAnd once you see, it does get\na little bit more complex than that.\n\n80\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.590\nBut that's really where it begins.\n\n81\n00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.930\nThe key is here is understanding that what\nwe're doing when we talk about assigning\n\n82\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.770\npermissions is that we're doing it on\nthe individual object or file itself or\n\n83\n00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.170\nwhatever we actually want.\n\n84\n00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.680\nAnd that's where we\nactually have to begin.\n\n85\n00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.770\n>> All right.\n\n86\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.570\nSo let's do that.\n\n87\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.750\nAs I get ready to pull this up and\ngive you just a second,\n\n88\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.610\nwe'll take a look at it.\n\n89\n00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.780\nFirst of all, we're gonna have what's\ncalled an object like Ron just said,\n\n90\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.290\na container, which would be\nlike a folder or a file, and\n\n91\n00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.970\nthe file doesn't have to be a text\ndocument, when we say file it could be\n\n92\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.230\na picture, could be a text document,\na spreadsheet, an html file.\n\n93\n00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.930\nAnything like that, any type of file.\n\n94\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.250\nEach one of those objects is\ngonna have A security descriptor.\n\n95\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.700\nThat's Microsoft's technical term for\nit, but every object that we create\n\n96\n00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.050\nhas its own security descriptor and\nthat is created automatically.\n\n97\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.690\nSo when you creat a new file,\nwhen you creat a new folder,\n\n98\n00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.500\na security descriptor is attached or\nassociated with that object.\n\n99\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.120\nAnd that's where we're gonna\nassign the permissions.\n\n100\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.350\nNow, in a Microsoft world, that's known\nas a discretionary access control.\n\n101\n00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.140\nSo, it's really not a Microsoft thing,\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.350\nIt goes beyond that.\n\n103\n00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.770\n>> Yeah.\nIt's just general security terms that you\n\n104\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.060\ntend to hear about.\n\n105\n00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.440\nIf you've gone through some\nof the Security+ shows.\n\n106\n00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.030\nIf not, of course we'd recommend that\nyou take a little bit of time and\n\n107\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.100\ngo through that.\n\n108\n00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.690\nBut remember that for accessing,\nwell, anything on your network,\n\n109\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.430\nright, we're actually going to use some\nsort of access control list to do so.\n\n110\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.730\nWhether it's mandatory access control or\ndiscretionary access control Role based,\n\n111\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.120\nrule based, you name it,\nthere's tons of different ones.\n\n112\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.580\nUsually when we deal in terms\nof end users, normally,\n\n113\n00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.870\nthey are accessing files and we need to be\nable to say, hey Ronnie can do it but Mike\n\n114\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.670\ncan't, or this group can do it but this\none can't, and that means on every object.\n\n115\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.120\nInstead what we're going to say, all right\nwe need to be very discreet about it we\n\n116\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.760\nneed to be able to pinpoint exactly\nwho needs permissions and who doesn't.\n\n117\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.060\nAnd so we go with what we would call\nthe discretionary access control.\n\n118\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.360\n>> And it's up to the owner of the object,\nright?\n\n119\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.060\nAnd so they mean it's at your discretion,\nwhereas like in a mandatory access control\n\n120\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.630\nsystem, there's somebody whose job\nis to mark these resources and\n\n121\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.170\ndecide who has it, who doesn't Usually\nwe're talking about systems like\n\n122\n00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.770\nobjects are marked as top secret.\n\n123\n00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.510\nAnd then only if I have a top secret\nclearance do I get access to that.\n\n124\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.180\nIn discretionary access control,\n\n125\n00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.400\nif you create a new file,\nyou're the owner of that file.\n\n126\n00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.760\nAnd it's your discretion\nwho gets access to it.\n\n127\n00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.770\nSo you can go and\nchange the permissions on that object.\n\n128\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.380\nIt's not something that's preset.\n\n129\n00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.260\nAnd let's take a look at it.\n\n130\n00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.340\nSo I've got a Windows 7 box up here.\n\n131\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.780\nAnd I'm just gonna open up file explorer,\nand\n\n132\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.990\nI'm gonna navigate over to my C drive and\nI'm gonna make a new folder.\n\n133\n00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.890\nAnd I'm gonna actually get rid of this\none that I was playing with earlier,\n\n134\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.560\ncuz that's what we're gonna do.\n\n135\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.460\nWe're gonna make a new\nfolder called Show Notes.\n\n136\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.410\nSo all I did was right click, new folder.\n\n137\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.200\nThere it is.\n\n138\n00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.000\nI'm gonna right click on that object and\nI'm gonna choose properties.\n\n139\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.840\nAnd on the properties of this object,\nI'm gonna click on that security tab.\n\n140\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.780\nThis is the discretionary\naccess control list.\n\n141\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.330\nNow it doesn't say that up at the top but\nthat's what this is.\n\n142\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.570\nThis is where I can choose or\nassign permissions to groups or to users.\n\n143\n00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:28.320\nEach one of these lines Authenticated\nusers, system, administrators, users.\n\n144\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.010\nEach one of those is known as an ACE.\n\n145\n00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.860\nOr an Access Controlled Entry.\n\n146\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.980\nI'm gonna make a new entry to\ncontrol's someone's access.\n\n147\n00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.430\nWhether that's a user.\n\n148\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.030\nOr whether that's a group.\n\n149\n00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.540\nSo if I want to, for example,\ngive somebody permissions over this.\n\n150\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.960\nI would click edit and add them.\n\n151\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.500\nAnd we'll do that here Well actually,\nlet's go do it now.\n\n152\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.870\nI'm going to click edit, and\n\n153\n00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.360\nthat opens up that access control\nlist in a separate window.\n\n154\n00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.450\nNow I've got my add button.\n\n155\n00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.781\nSo I can click add, and\nI'm going to find my host's group,\n\n156\n00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:01.246\nand I'm going to click OK.\n\n157\n00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:05.637\nAnd now there's a new ACE, Access Control\nEntry, for the group called host.\n\n158\n00:08:05.637 --> 00:08:09.509\nAnd once I select that entry,\nI can come down here and\n\n159\n00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:14.080\nchoose what permissions I\nwant to assign to that group.\n\n160\n00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.890\nI'm gonna leave it at the default,\nwhich is Read and\n\n161\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.420\nwe'll talk about the different\npermissions here in just a second.\n\n162\n00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.950\nI'll click OK and now, I can see.\n\n163\n00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.100\nIf I find them.\n\n164\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.640\nThere's my hosts and\nthere's their permissions.\n\n165\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.790\nRead, List folder, Contents,\nand Read & execute.\n\n166\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.990\nI click okay, and that's really\nthe basics of assigning permissions.\n\n167\n00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.070\nYou go to the resource, you pull up it's\nproperties and you assign the permissions.\n\n168\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.500\nYeah.\nIt's fairly easy.\n\n169\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.020\nThere's nothing very difficult about\njust assigning the permissions.\n\n170\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.980\nWhat actually becomes\na little bit more difficult,\n\n171\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.140\nof course, then is later on\nas permissions get combined,\n\n172\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.610\nthen you have to determine the overall\neffective permissions that you have,\n\n173\n00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.080\nand that's where it can get\na little bit more confusing.\n\n174\n00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.830\nBut remember what Mike just showed\nus there in that discretionary\n\n175\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.120\naccess control list?\n\n176\n00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.382\nYou create your entry, and then it gives\nyou that other set of permissions.\n\n177\n00:09:02.382 --> 00:09:06.055\nAnd when you do it I know that I've done\nthis before, I know Mike probably hasn't\n\n178\n00:09:06.055 --> 00:09:10.260\ncause he's learned about it since way back\nwhen it actually first began [LAUGH] but I\n\n179\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.440\nhave done this where I have been a little\nbit careless when I created the group and\n\n180\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.860\ndidn't realize that I had moved off of\nthat focus on that new group I created,\n\n181\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.250\nand oh look, it got more\npermissions than I thought, and\n\n182\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.220\nI unchecked permissions\nthat I shouldn't have.\n\n183\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.338\nYou've gotta be very careful.\n\n184\n00:09:24.338 --> 00:09:26.530\nMake sure that you actually have\nhighlighted what you want to and\n\n185\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.965\nset the level of permissions right\nthere that you need to on that control.\n\n186\n00:09:30.965 --> 00:09:33.895\nNow once we do that, Mike, is there\nanything else that we have to do for\n\n187\n00:09:33.895 --> 00:09:35.405\nthose permissions to take place.\n\n188\n00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:37.955\nWe have to log off or\nreboot the computer or anything?\n\n189\n00:09:37.955 --> 00:09:38.645\nIt depends.\n\n190\n00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:41.475\nRight.\nAnytime you have a change of group\n\n191\n00:09:41.475 --> 00:09:42.540\nmembership.\n\n192\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.210\nThen yes.\n\n193\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.220\nRemember your access token.\n\n194\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.210\nYou get that when you log in and\n\n195\n00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:54.610\nthat list your user accounts SID and\nthe SID of all the groups you belong to.\n\n196\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.990\nSo if you had already\nlogged in this morning and\n\n197\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.950\non that access token it showed that\nyou're a member of the group called host.\n\n198\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:01.830\nThen you're good to go.\n\n199\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.740\nI create a new resource, I give\nhosts permission over that resource,\n\n200\n00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.350\nwhen you try to access it,\nyou present your access token.\n\n201\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.360\nIt say, oh, he's in hosts,\nhe's good to go, he can have, and\n\n202\n00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.780\nit looks here to see what\nthose hosts should have.\n\n203\n00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.540\nNow, if you weren't in hosts,\nlet's say that I'm\n\n204\n00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.350\ndoing some troubleshooting and you go to\naccess the resources and you can't, and\n\n205\n00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.230\nI find out it's because somebody\nforgot to add you into the host group,\n\n206\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.600\nthen I can change, in fact,\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n207\n00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.870\nLet's show you exactly what I mean,\nwhat the heck we're talking about.\n\n208\n00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:38.590\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to log\noff, oh, and there's updates waiting.\n\n209\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.680\nOh.\nHopefully they won't try\n\n210\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.520\nto kick in in the middle of our show here.\n\n211\n00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.270\nSo I'm going to log off.\n\n212\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.690\nAnd I'm going to log back on as Ronnie.\n\n213\n00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.700\nSo do a little control alt delete,\nwe'll switch user, other user.\n\n214\n00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.200\nRonnie.\n\n215\n00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.275\nAnd Ronnie's super secret password there.\n\n216\n00:10:57.275 --> 00:11:00.250\n[LAUGH] Ronnie's the show host, obviously.\n\n217\n00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.230\nHe's standing next to me here.\n\n218\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.620\nAnd I've given the host group\npermissions over that resource.\n\n219\n00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.000\nOh and you know what Ronnie,\n\n220\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.650\nthat's not gonna actually work because\n[LAUGH] if I didn't change the default\n\n221\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.620\npermissions in there so you are still\ngonna have access to that so.\n\n222\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.500\nTell you what, let's do this.\n\n223\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.030\nLet's, let it build your profile here.\n\n224\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.000\nAll right, so we've logged off as Ronnie,\nwe're gonna log back on.\n\n225\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.135\nType in his super secret password there.\n\n226\n00:11:28.756 --> 00:11:31.690\nWait for Windows to load up.\n\n227\n00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.670\nOpen up File Explorer.\n\n228\n00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.076\nNavigate into that C drive, and\ntry to connect to that Show Notes folder.\n\n229\n00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:44.080\nAnd sure enough, Ronnie has access.\n\n230\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.450\nSo again, if the group membership is\nchanged after somebody has logged on,\n\n231\n00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.490\ntheir access token doesn't\nget updated automatically.\n\n232\n00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.510\nThey're gonna have to log off, log back\non to include that new or modified group\n\n233\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.470\nmembership before they're gonna be able\nto gain access to those resources.\n\n234\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.230\nAnd sometimes you, even though the log on,\nlog off, log, I'm gonna say it wrong.\n\n235\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.410\nLog off, log back on may work.\n\n236\n00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.490\nSometimes it may not match your\nrequired reboot or you may have to do\n\n237\n00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.230\na couple of times for it to work, so you\nmay end up with some crass credentials.\n\n238\n00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.110\nIt does happen,\nI've seen that happen before, so\n\n239\n00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.580\njust kind of realize you may\nhave to do it a couple of times.\n\n240\n00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.400\nYeah, exactly, and\nthat's what was happening there on us.\n\n241\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.320\nSo we're going to, and I'm gonna\nlog back in as the administrator,\n\n242\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.940\nshow you guys some more stuff here.\n\n243\n00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.670\nSo we talked about the DACL,\n\n244\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.530\nthe Discretionary Access Control List\nwhere we find those permissions.\n\n245\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.310\nWe talked about the ACEs,\nthe Access Control Entries.\n\n246\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.870\nThat's where I add a user or a group,\nand I assign the permissions to them.\n\n247\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.470\nNow, let's talk about\nthe permissions themselves.\n\n248\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.970\nSo, I've logged back in as administrator\nand because there is sometimes a little\n\n249\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.750\nbit of confusion on the permissions I'm\njust going to right-click on Show Notes,\n\n250\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.690\npull up it's Properties, and I'm going\nto navigate over to that Security tab.\n\n251\n00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.690\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nthe Permissions that exist here.\n\n252\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.200\nIn fact, I'm going to click Edit so\nwe can get a little bit closer look here.\n\n253\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.130\nThere's several Permissions that I\ncan assign, starting with Read, and\n\n254\n00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:14.580\nread permission gives you just that, gives\nyou the ability to read a file, right?\n\n255\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.150\nSo if it's a file, I can double-click\non it, I can open it, I can read it.\n\n256\n00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.510\nI can't make any changes to it, I can't\ndo anything else, all I can do is read.\n\n257\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.000\nThere's a write permission down here.\n\n258\n00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.260\nNow that's gonna allow me to\nmake changes to a document.\n\n259\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.430\nIf you have write permission over a file,\nyou can make changes to the file.\n\n260\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.030\nI could double click on a file.\n\n261\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.390\nI could type in a new paragraph.\n\n262\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.690\nI could even delete a paragraph, and\nthen I could save and close the file.\n\n263\n00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.640\nIf I have write permissions over a folder\nthen I can create new objects within\n\n264\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.650\nthat folder.\n\n265\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.220\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.500\nBut one of the things where people\nget a little bit of confusion is\n\n267\n00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.490\nthat those permissions are not mutually,\nwhat's a good way to say it, Ronnie?\n\n268\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.680\nThey don't build on each\nother is a way to say it.\n\n269\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:03.290\nLike let's say I just take a group called,\nI don't know, authenticated users just for\n\n270\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.220\ngiggles here, right?\n\n271\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.740\nAnd I go to assign them,\nI'm gonna uncheck everything,\n\n272\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.310\nso they don't have any permissions, right?\n\n273\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.580\nNo permissions assigned.\n\n274\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.150\nI'm gonna give them read, and\n\n275\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.730\nnotice that gives them nothing else,\nright, just read permission.\n\n276\n00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.540\nI'm gonna uncheck read and\ngive them write permission.\n\n277\n00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.760\nNotice it does not give them read.\n\n278\n00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.460\nThis is one that trips a lot of people up,\nright.\n\n279\n00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.940\nYou can assign somebody write permission\nand not give them read permission.\n\n280\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:36.900\nIt's not a common scenario, but there\nare situations when you need to use this.\n\n281\n00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.970\nDrop folders are a big one, you know,\nif you've got a, let's say that I'm\n\n282\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.550\na teacher, and I want my students to\nupload something to this FTP folder.\n\n283\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.225\nWell, they're going to\nneed to be able to write.\n\n284\n00:14:47.225 --> 00:14:51.145\nWrite to that folder to be able to\nupload their homework assignment.\n\n285\n00:14:51.145 --> 00:14:54.545\nWhat I don't want them doing is double\nclicking on anybody else's stuff and\n\n286\n00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:57.505\nbeing able to read that or\nread anything else that's in that folder.\n\n287\n00:14:57.505 --> 00:14:58.425\nThat's a great scenario.\n\n288\n00:14:58.425 --> 00:15:02.049\nYeah, so I can give them write permission\nwithout giving him read permission that\n\n289\n00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:03.318\nwould allow them to do that.\n\n290\n00:15:03.318 --> 00:15:06.286\nSo that's something you gotta keep\nin mind if you give them write that\n\n291\n00:15:06.286 --> 00:15:09.980\ndoesn't automatically give them read,\nthey are independent.\n\n292\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.620\nList folder contents only applies to a\nfolder if you right clicked on a file and\n\n293\n00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.060\nchose properties in one of the security\ntabs, you wouldn't see that there.\n\n294\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.810\nThat's what gives you the ability to\nsee all the objects that are inside\n\n295\n00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:21.760\nthat folder.\n\n296\n00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.890\nNotice it doesn't build\non anything else either.\n\n297\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.390\nI could give you just\nlist folder contents.\n\n298\n00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.080\nYou could open up the folder,\nyou can see all the contents,\n\n299\n00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.680\nyou couldn't double click on anything or\nyou couldn't create anything.\n\n300\n00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.800\nThere is also read and execute.\n\n301\n00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.160\nRead and execute, gives you read\npermission, plus the ability to execute.\n\n302\n00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.950\nSo if there's a script or a .BAD or\na .CMD or a .EXC or a .msi.\n\n303\n00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.100\nYou could now double-click on it and\nit would run.\n\n304\n00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.600\nThat also gives you read and\nlist folder contents so those do build.\n\n305\n00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.650\nLet's uncheck all of those.\n\n306\n00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.107\nModify permission gives you read,\nlist folder contents, read and\n\n307\n00:16:01.107 --> 00:16:03.385\nexecute, write And then modify.\n\n308\n00:16:03.385 --> 00:16:05.943\nThis is another one, Ronnie,\nthat trips people up, right?\n\n309\n00:16:05.943 --> 00:16:06.650\n>> It really is.\n\n310\n00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.807\nThis modify permission,\n\n311\n00:16:07.807 --> 00:16:10.600\nreally it does something that's\nreally a little bit strange.\n\n312\n00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.510\nIt gives you the ability to\ndelete something if you need to.\n\n313\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.200\nMore than anything else.\n\n314\n00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.850\nI can have read permissions.\n\n315\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.780\nI can write permissions.\n\n316\n00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.740\nI can execute something in the folder.\n\n317\n00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.180\nI can look at something in the folder.\n\n318\n00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.300\nI can list the entire contents.\n\n319\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.050\nBut for me to have the ability to delete,\n\n320\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.060\nI need this modified to also be able\nto give me that ability to do so.\n\n321\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.880\nWithout that, that's all I'm doing.\n\n322\n00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.140\nI can't actually remove\nanything to delete it out.\n\n323\n00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:34.702\n>> That's right.\n\n324\n00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:37.750\nThat's where people get confused,\nthey're like what do I need,\n\n325\n00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.380\nwhat's the difference between write and\nmodify?\n\n326\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.530\nAnd it's whether or\nnot you can delete the object itself.\n\n327\n00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.290\nRemember I said with write permission\nyou could double click on a file and\n\n328\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.820\nyou could delete half the contents\nof the file and save the file.\n\n329\n00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.120\nWhat you can't do is\ndelete the file itself.\n\n330\n00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.331\nIf I give you modify, now you can delete\nthe file itself or the object itself.\n\n331\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.000\nAll right?\n\n332\n00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.330\nIf I uncheck all of those\nwe'll get back to blank slate.\n\n333\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.970\nThe last one up there is full control and\nit seems self explanatory.\n\n334\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.030\nYou say, okay, well, full control.\n\n335\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.840\nWhat else is there besides read and write\nand the ability to list folder contents?\n\n336\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.840\nI mean, what's the difference\nbetween modify and full control?\n\n337\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.330\nAnd that's just being able\nto do what I'm doing now.\n\n338\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.720\nIf I want to be able to change\nthe permissions on an object,\n\n339\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.120\nI need full control.\n\n340\n00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.410\nWith modify, I can do anything.\n\n341\n00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.040\nI can read, I can write,\nI can delete, I can do whatever.\n\n342\n00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.970\nI can't change the access\ncontrol list itself.\n\n343\n00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.820\nFull control gives me\nthe ability to modify\n\n344\n00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.780\nthe permissions as well as to assign\nownership of a document as well.\n\n345\n00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.510\nAnd there's a special group\ncalled the creator owners.\n\n346\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.250\nAnybody that's in\nthe creator owner group for\n\n347\n00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.620\nthat particular resource has full control.\n\n348\n00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.710\nSo maybe I want Ronnie to be in\ncharge of the company phone list.\n\n349\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.600\nI can make him creator\nowner of the phone list.\n\n350\n00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.595\nThat would give him full control and\nthe ability to change those permissions,\n\n351\n00:17:58.595 --> 00:17:59.210\nall right?\n\n352\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.346\nNow I've got a little spreadsheet here,\n\n353\n00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:05.020\nand I'll post a link in the forums\nin just a minute if I can find it.\n\n354\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.390\nA nice little summary of all those\nthings I was just talking about.\n\n355\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.690\nCuz it does get a little bit confusing.\n\n356\n00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.180\nSo here I can see what permissions\nread is giving, write,\n\n357\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.380\nlist folder contents, etc., etc.\n\n358\n00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.740\nFor example, I can see\nthe difference between modify and\n\n359\n00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.670\nfull control, delete subfolders and\nfiles, right?\n\n360\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.480\nWe can delete files, can't delete\nthe folders without full control,\n\n361\n00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.680\nchange permissions and take ownership.\n\n362\n00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.710\nIf you compare write and modify,\nall right, all these are the same.\n\n363\n00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.520\nThese are the same.\n\n364\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.060\nThe difference is these guys up here\nwhich has to do with being able to\n\n365\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.108\nwrite to the attributes.\n\n366\n00:18:44.108 --> 00:18:45.042\nAll right.\n\n367\n00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:48.050\nSo a nice little chart there that\nkind of gives you a summary.\n\n368\n00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:53.030\nNow, the other thing I want to talk\nabout is the special permissions.\n\n369\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.772\nThese are what we call\nstandard permissions.\n\n370\n00:18:55.772 --> 00:18:58.050\nI'm gonna cancel those\nchanges I was making there.\n\n371\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.020\nWhen we look at these permissions\nwe just talked about,\n\n372\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.900\nstandard permissions, all right.\n\n373\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.960\nSometimes, we might a little more granular\ncontrol in which case I can click on\n\n374\n00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:13.170\nAdvanced and\nI can go into my Change Permissions here.\n\n375\n00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:17.190\nAnd I can choose host, for\nexample, and click edit.\n\n376\n00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.690\nAnd what you'll see is the permissions\nlook a little bit different don't they.\n\n377\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.460\n>> Wow.\nThey really do.\n\n378\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:25.820\nIt looks like a lot more details In this\nparticular permissions lists that you see.\n\n379\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.090\nAnd what you actually end up seeing\nare things like the write attribute or\n\n380\n00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.050\nthe read attribute.\n\n381\n00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.670\nAnd you'll actually see some\nvery similar details in there.\n\n382\n00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.432\nSo, if you didn't want to give them\neverything in read, you can actually to\n\n383\n00:19:36.432 --> 00:19:39.255\ncome in here and actually delete a few\nthings or actually change a few things.\n\n384\n00:19:39.255 --> 00:19:40.515\n>> Yeah.\nIt's not that common.\n\n385\n00:19:40.515 --> 00:19:43.165\nWhen I assign somebody read permission,\nI'm thinking, okay,\n\n386\n00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:44.535\nthey can read the document.\n\n387\n00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:47.915\nWell, read also includes read attributes\nand read extended attributes.\n\n388\n00:19:47.915 --> 00:19:51.755\nSo there's actually three permissions\nyou get with that read permission.\n\n389\n00:19:51.755 --> 00:19:54.215\nNormally, we don't\nreally worry about that.\n\n390\n00:19:54.215 --> 00:19:56.415\nIt's a little too granular for us.\n\n391\n00:19:56.415 --> 00:20:01.110\nBut there might be a situation when you\nwant to give somebody read permission But\n\n392\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.680\nnot read attributes and\n\n393\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.230\nnot read extended attributes well you\ncan't do that with a standard permissions.\n\n394\n00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.410\nYou have to come in here, and\nnotice now that I can uncheck\n\n395\n00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:15.210\nread extended attributes and\nuncheck read attributes.\n\n396\n00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.551\nThey still have read data, but I took away\nthe ability to read the attribute, right?\n\n397\n00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:21.670\nSo, that is what those\nspecial permissions are.\n\n398\n00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.180\nIt's the same set of permissions,\njust more granular.\n\n399\n00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.320\nWe're gonna take the standard permissions,\nbreak them down into smaller,\n\n400\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.565\nmore granular controls.\n\n401\n00:20:29.565 --> 00:20:34.380\n99% of the time, you don't need that,\nbut just to know that they're there.\n\n402\n00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.170\nCuz sometimes, you'll see it listed,\nspecial permissions.\n\n403\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.240\nYou might come over here, and\nin fact, let's see if we can do that.\n\n404\n00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.599\nLet me click Edit and Add, and\nfind my Authenticated Users group.\n\n405\n00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.960\nAnd I'm gonna go, and this is what Ronnie\nwas talking about, once you add the group,\n\n406\n00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.890\nmake sure you select the group you\nwant to change the permissions for.\n\n407\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.690\nIt might have jumped on\nto System accidentally,\n\n408\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.635\nand you start taking away permissions.\n\n409\n00:20:57.635 --> 00:20:59.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's not gonna be a good day.\n\n410\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.020\nSo, I'm gonna go to Authenticated Users.\n\n411\n00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.084\nAnd I'll go ahead and click OK,\nsince they're now added.\n\n412\n00:21:06.084 --> 00:21:09.590\nThen I'm gonna click advanced, and\n\n413\n00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:14.016\nI'm going to go back to those\nauthenticated users and edit, and\n\n414\n00:21:14.016 --> 00:21:18.680\nI'm gonna uncheck read attributes and\nextended attributes.\n\n415\n00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.150\nSo they no longer have read, or\nall they have is read data, right?\n\n416\n00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.970\nNot read extended and read attributes.\n\n417\n00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.760\nI click OK, OK, OK.\n\n418\n00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And when I come back out here\n\n419\n00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.400\nto authenticated users, it doesn't\nlook like they have any permissions.\n\n420\n00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.860\nIf I scroll down a little bit,\nit says, oh,\n\n421\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.020\nthey've got special permissions,\nall right?\n\n422\n00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.410\nAnd you don't know which one.\n\n423\n00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.340\nThere are several special permissions.\n\n424\n00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:47.280\nYou'd have to go in and edit it to\nfigure out what permissions they have.\n\n425\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.490\nI'm gonna remove those\nguys just real quick so\n\n426\n00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.340\nthat it doesn't mess\nwith the rest of our lab.\n\n427\n00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.160\nSo now we're back to normal.\n\n428\n00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.640\nAll right.\nSo we've talked about the different\n\n429\n00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.490\npermissions that are available, we\nshowed you how they build on each other.\n\n430\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.770\nRead and write are separate.\n\n431\n00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.940\nModify adds read and\nwrite plus the ability to delete.\n\n432\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:08.000\nFull control gives you everything\nplus the ability to change ownership,\n\n433\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.860\nas well as modify permissions.\n\n434\n00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.220\nAnother thing we gotta worry about is\n\n435\n00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.560\nan explicit permissions\nversus inherited permissions.\n\n436\n00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.500\nAnd they are different, right?\n\n437\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.310\n>> They really are.\n\n438\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.520\nWhen you take a look at what\nMike just showed us and\n\n439\n00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.670\ndoing everything that we've done,\nMike set those permissions.\n\n440\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.284\nHe explicitly assigned those permissions.\n\n441\n00:22:31.284 --> 00:22:36.510\nAnd that might lead you, if this is really\nyour first foray into supporting users and\n\n442\n00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.960\ngoing, all right, so anytime that\nI actually need to create a new\n\n443\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.680\nfolder on somebody's computers,\nI need to explicitly assign permissions.\n\n444\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.350\nWell, don't get me wrong,\n\n445\n00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.810\nyou can do that, but there's also\nwhat we call inherited permissions.\n\n446\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.170\nAnd those are actually permissions\nthat were actually made on that folder\n\n447\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.060\nwithout you and\nI actually having to do anything.\n\n448\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.240\nIn other words,\nit was put there by the system.\n\n449\n00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.730\nAnd those permissions trickle down\nfrom what we call the root itself.\n\n450\n00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.630\nSo whatever permissions are up there,\nusually also whenever you create a folder\n\n451\n00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.120\nand it's underneath that folder,\nin other words,\n\n452\n00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.410\ninside that folder, you're also gonna\nend up inheriting those permissions too.\n\n453\n00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:16.150\nSo you do have to deal with the idea of\nwhat we call inherited permissions and\n\n454\n00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.790\nexplicit permissions too.\n\n455\n00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.710\nThe good thing is it's fairly easy to see,\nand Mike can show us that.\n\n456\n00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.410\n>> Absolutely.\n\n457\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.910\nAnd inherited permissions make our\nlives a whole lot easier, right?\n\n458\n00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.360\nBecause what's happening is,\n\n459\n00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.870\nif I assign permissions on an object,\nwe call that the parent object,\n\n460\n00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.300\nthey'll inherit down to all the child\nobjects within there by default.\n\n461\n00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.830\nThat means if I have a folder, and inside\nthat folder there's a hundred files, And\n\n462\n00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.700\nI want to give the sales department read\naccess to all those files, I don't have to\n\n463\n00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:47.380\ngo to each one of those files and assign\nread permission to the sales group, right?\n\n464\n00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.836\nRight click on each one,\nproperties, add, sales, read.\n\n465\n00:23:50.836 --> 00:23:53.557\nGo to the next one and\ndo that ninety-nine more times.\n\n466\n00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:57.371\nI can assign the permission\nonce at that parent folder and\n\n467\n00:23:57.371 --> 00:23:59.990\nlet inheritance take care of it.\n\n468\n00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.900\nLike this.\n\n469\n00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:07.670\nSo, we know, we, at show notes I\ngave the host group Read permission\n\n470\n00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:12.390\nright well I'm gonna go inside show notes\nand I'm gonna make a new folder and\n\n471\n00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:19.500\nI'm gonna call it windows seven and for\ngiggles we'll make another new folder and\n\n472\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.430\nwe'll call it Linux plus These are some\nof the shows we're currently working on.\n\n473\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:25.150\nNow I'm gonna pull.\n\n474\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.450\nI just made this folder.\n\n475\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.930\nI'm gonna right click on it,\nchoose Properties,\n\n476\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:34.290\nand I'm gonna go to the Security tab,\nand sure enough, there's Hosts.\n\n477\n00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:38.250\nThey already have permission over\nthis folder that I just created.\n\n478\n00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.430\nAlright?\n\n479\n00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.150\nThose are inherited permissions.\n\n480\n00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.580\nand how do we tell the difference?\n\n481\n00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.710\nWell, lets take a look at this.\n\n482\n00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:48.120\nI'm going to try to move this guy out\nof the way, jump back one level, and\n\n483\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.050\npull up the properties for\n\n484\n00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:55.440\nshow notes, as well as the properties for\nthat Window's 7 folder inside,\n\n485\n00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.790\nand I'm going to click on security and I'm\ngoing to select show host And here I could\n\n486\n00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:06.050\nsee host over that show notes folder,\nhave read, list, read, and execute.\n\n487\n00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:11.690\nThey also have read, list, read and\nexecute over the Windows 7 folder.\n\n488\n00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.560\nBut take a look.\n\n489\n00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.530\nYou notice a slight\ndifference there Ronnie.\n\n490\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.490\nWhat's the difference between those two?\n\n491\n00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.990\n>> One looks like it's actually bolded and\nthe other looks a bit grayed out.\n\n492\n00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:23.250\nAnd that's how we can actually distinguish\nthe difference between what we'll normally\n\n493\n00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.880\nbe able to visually see as being inherited\npermissions versus explicit ones.\n\n494\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.700\nUsually the grayed out ones or\nthe kind of washed out ones\n\n495\n00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.240\nare gonna be the ones that we're\ninheriting from a parent folder.\n\n496\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.390\n>> Exactly, the dark black check\nmarks are explicit permissions.\n\n497\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.480\nThat means I went to this tab and\nI clicked edit and\n\n498\n00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.470\nI modified the permissions of that object.\n\n499\n00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:46.530\nThe grey ones mean it was\ninherited from a parent object.\n\n500\n00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.000\nNow I don't know what parent object.\n\n501\n00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.870\nCould be from Shownotes, right,\nbecause that's the direct parent.\n\n502\n00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.300\nWindows 7 is inside Shownotes.\n\n503\n00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.570\nBut Shownotes is a folder on the C drive.\n\n504\n00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.890\nSo C is the parent of Shownotes.\n\n505\n00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.620\nSo it could be coming from there.\n\n506\n00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.360\nI just know that it's being\ninherited from somewhere.\n\n507\n00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.990\nAnd why this is important,\nwhy you have to pay attention to this,\n\n508\n00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:10.760\ninherited permissions are good, we like\nthat because it makes my life easier.\n\n509\n00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.380\nI go create new resources,\n\n510\n00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.790\nit automatically picks up all of those\npermissions that I've already assigned.\n\n511\n00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.770\nI'm good to go, but\n\n512\n00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:22.160\nthere's going to be some times where I\nmight want to change those permissions.\n\n513\n00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.380\nAnd if I click Edit And\n\n514\n00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.650\nI go to hosts, notice I can not\nchange those inherited permissions.\n\n515\n00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.130\nThey're grayed out.\n\n516\n00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.010\nNow, I could give them extra permissions.\n\n517\n00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.280\nI could give them other\npermissions here but\n\n518\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.380\nI can't change the inherited permissions.\n\n519\n00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.110\nThere's three ways I can go about\nchanging inherited permissions.\n\n520\n00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:44.700\nThe first one is at the parent object,\nif I went to show notes All right, and\n\n521\n00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.670\nlet's click okay on that.\n\n522\n00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:51.460\nIf I go back to Show Notes and I click\nEdit and I go to the Hosts, and I say,\n\n523\n00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:57.580\nyou know what, I decide I want to give\nthem Write Permissions, and I click OK.\n\n524\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.330\nWell, now Hosts over the parent folder\nShow Notes have Read and Write.\n\n525\n00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.629\nIf I go down to that child object\n\n526\n00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:10.789\nTo the Windows 7 folder and\npull up its properties again.\n\n527\n00:27:13.518 --> 00:27:17.820\nHosts now have read and write permission.\n\n528\n00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.370\nSo one way to do it would be to change\nit at the parent object itself,\n\n529\n00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.810\nwherever it's being inherited from.\n\n530\n00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.710\nCuz I can change explicit permissions, so\n\n531\n00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.550\nif I can figure out where the permissions\nare being inherited from,\n\n532\n00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.870\nI can change them there, but that does\nintroduce a little bit of a problem.\n\n533\n00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.830\nIt's being inherited by not\njust the Windows 7 folder.\n\n534\n00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:40.100\nThere was another folder in\nthere called Linux Plus and\n\n535\n00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:45.160\nif I pull up the properties of\nthat then the show host, or\n\n536\n00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.430\nthe host, have read and\nwrite permission over that as well.\n\n537\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.270\nMaybe that's not what I wanted to do,\nright.\n\n538\n00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.460\nI just wanted to change I wanted to give\nthe host right permission over Windows 7\n\n539\n00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.620\nand not Lenox Plus.\n\n540\n00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.190\nI can't modify the parent\npermissions then because\n\n541\n00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.250\nit's going to inherit down\nto all the objects inside.\n\n542\n00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.110\nAnother way you can do it.\n\n543\n00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.330\nAnd Let's undo what I just did.\n\n544\n00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:09.400\nSo I'm going to go back\nin to properties here and\n\n545\n00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.869\nwe'll click edit and\nwe'll find hosts wrong properties.\n\n546\n00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.040\nWe'll find our show hosts properties.\n\n547\n00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.390\nWell.\n[LAUGH] It's around there somewhere,\n\n548\n00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.290\nI'll just pull it up again.\n\n549\n00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.920\nAnd I'm gonna undo what we did.\n\n550\n00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.740\nSo hosts,\nI'm gonna take away write permission so\n\n551\n00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.240\nwe're back to the way it was in\nthe beginning when we first set it up.\n\n552\n00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.350\nAnd same idea, I wanna change these\npermissions on Windows 7, But\n\n553\n00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.680\nI can't because they're inherited.\n\n554\n00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.810\nAnd I can't do it at the parent object\nbecause I don't want to change it on both\n\n555\n00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:44.750\nfolders.\n\n556\n00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:51.250\nSo what I could do is assign explicit\npermissions on the child object.\n\n557\n00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:57.630\nI click edit here, and I could go\nahead and add write permission, right?\n\n558\n00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:01.310\nI can't modify the inherited permissions,\nbut I can change the other permissions.\n\n559\n00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.030\nOr what if they already had write?\n\n560\n00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.950\nSo, let's do this, you can see I\ngive him write and that would work.\n\n561\n00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.150\nSo they're inheriting read And list folder\ncontents and execute, but then they're\n\n562\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:15.530\nalso gonna pick up write permission,\nbut just over this WIndows 7 folder.\n\n563\n00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:17.230\nIf they go to the Linux plus folder,\n\n564\n00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.150\nthey're not gonna have\nwrite permission there.\n\n565\n00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.860\nSo that's the advantage of doing it\nby assigning the explicit permission\n\n566\n00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.930\non the child object.\n\n567\n00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.940\nOr, we could assign\nthe opposite permission.\n\n568\n00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.060\nThat is another way to do it.\n\n569\n00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.030\nI'm going to pull up the properties for\nshow notes itself.\n\n570\n00:29:36.743 --> 00:29:38.705\nAnd I'm gonna give the host group.\n\n571\n00:29:41.874 --> 00:29:43.670\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ngive them read and write.\n\n572\n00:29:46.671 --> 00:29:47.710\nAll right?\n\n573\n00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.210\nSo now the hosts have read and write.\n\n574\n00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:57.470\nIf I go back over here to\nWindows 7 Hosts have read and\n\n575\n00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:02.090\nwrite what if I don't want them to have\nright over that Linux plus folder though?\n\n576\n00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:07.030\nWell I could pull up its properties And\nI go into security, and\n\n577\n00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.070\nlet's say I'm okay with the hosts\nhave write but the only host that\n\n578\n00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:15.060\nare working on that show are Daniel and\nDon, not Ronnie and Mike.\n\n579\n00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.660\nSo, I don't want Ronnie and\nMike to be able to write to here.\n\n580\n00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.330\nWell, they're going to get that\npermission because they're a host, and\n\n581\n00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.970\nthe hosts have write permission.\n\n582\n00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.580\nWhat I could do is click edit, click add,\n\n583\n00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:30.150\nFind Ronnie's actual account and\nmy account.\n\n584\n00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:38.190\nThen I can take Mike and\ndeny right permission.\n\n585\n00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:43.110\nI could Ronnie and deny write permission.\n\n586\n00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.440\nIt's going to warn me denies are bad\nI'm going to say yes I understand,\n\n587\n00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.670\nand click okay.\n\n588\n00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.450\nSo, it's another way I can\nthe in inherited permissions\n\n589\n00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.810\nis to assign the opposite permissions.\n\n590\n00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.480\nNow we're going to talk about what I just\ndid there in a little more detail in just\n\n591\n00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.050\na second because we do have to.\n\n592\n00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:03.540\nThink about something called, the fact\nthat these permissions are cumulative.\n\n593\n00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.590\nBut let me show you one more way\nyou can change those permissions.\n\n594\n00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.070\nI'm just gonna make a new folder,\n\n595\n00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.840\nsince we've been kind of\ngoofing with those pretty bad.\n\n596\n00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.490\nWe'll say this one's our\nWindows 8 show notes.\n\n597\n00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:19.100\nAnd I'm going to pull up the properties,\ngo over to Security,\n\n598\n00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:24.280\nand, as we expected, the host group\ninherited All those permissions.\n\n599\n00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.060\nRight?\n\n600\n00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.930\nWell, what I could do, I could either\nchange it at the parent object, I could\n\n601\n00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:34.200\nassign the opposite explicit permission,\nor I could click this advanced button.\n\n602\n00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.300\nAnd I could go to this change permission,\nand I could uncheck this check mark.\n\n603\n00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.020\nIt says include inheritable\npermissions from the object's parent.\n\n604\n00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.090\nIf I uncheck that It's not gonna\ninherit those permissions anymore.\n\n605\n00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:50.150\nIt's gonna say okay,\nI won't do what I normally do.\n\n606\n00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:53.560\nThat way this folder will be\nindependent of that parent folder.\n\n607\n00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.040\nI could change permissions on\nthe parent folder all day long,\n\n608\n00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.040\nit's not gonna affect this folder.\n\n609\n00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.680\nBut there is one thing we have to decide.\n\n610\n00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.810\nAs soon as I created the folder\nIt inherited the permissions.\n\n611\n00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:06.290\nThat's what NTFS does.\n\n612\n00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:09.570\nSo now that I'm telling it to\nno longer inherit permissions,\n\n613\n00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.510\nit's got to ask me what to do with\nthe permissions that it already inherited.\n\n614\n00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:16.390\nIt's gonna say, look, I'm sorry,\nI won't inherit permissions anymore, but\n\n615\n00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.730\nI kinda already did so\nwhat do you want me to do with those?\n\n616\n00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.090\nAnd I have two choices.\n\n617\n00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.440\nIf I click remove,\nit'll remove all inherited permissions.\n\n618\n00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.510\nAnd only explicit permissions\nwould be left, right?\n\n619\n00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.405\n>> Yeah, that sounds awesome!\n\n620\n00:32:27.405 --> 00:32:28.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> It sounds great, Ronnie,\n\n621\n00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.200\nso let's try it here.\n\n622\n00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.530\nI'm gonna go ahead and click Remove.\n\n623\n00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:31.885\n>> You're not gonna.\n\n624\n00:32:31.885 --> 00:32:32.810\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n625\n00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.860\nAnd what's gonna happen is,\nnot only is it gonna remove the host, but\n\n626\n00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.195\nit removes System,\nIt removes administrators,\n\n627\n00:32:39.195 --> 00:32:42.885\ncuz all those were being inherited\nfrom the seed drive itself.\n\n628\n00:32:42.885 --> 00:32:46.795\nSo, you can get yourself in trouble\nreal quick by choosing that option.\n\n629\n00:32:46.795 --> 00:32:50.577\nA better option, Ronnie,\nis to choose change permissions.\n\n630\n00:32:50.577 --> 00:32:52.727\nUncheck this and click Add.\n\n631\n00:32:52.727 --> 00:32:54.347\nNow let me show you real quick.\n\n632\n00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:57.437\nSee where in these permissions it\nsays Inherited From Show Notes,\n\n633\n00:32:57.437 --> 00:33:00.147\nInherited From Show Notes, and\nInherited From Show Notes.\n\n634\n00:33:00.147 --> 00:33:05.413\nI am going to click, uncheck,\nInclude inheritable I'm gonna click Add.\n\n635\n00:33:05.413 --> 00:33:09.663\nNow all the permissions are still there,\nbut notice they're no longer inherited.\n\n636\n00:33:09.663 --> 00:33:10.203\nRight?\nIf\n\n637\n00:33:10.203 --> 00:33:12.713\nthey're no longer inherited, guess what?\n\n638\n00:33:12.713 --> 00:33:16.393\nThey're now black check marks not gray\nwhich means I should be able to come in\n\n639\n00:33:16.393 --> 00:33:21.653\nhere and make changes to them, and\nI can take away that write permission.\n\n640\n00:33:21.653 --> 00:33:25.790\nSo, a few different ways, Ronnie, that\nwe can end up Modifying those inherited\n\n641\n00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.300\npermissions if we need to,\nbecause you can't modify them directly.\n\n642\n00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.510\n>> This is one of those times you\ndo not want to be click-happy and\n\n643\n00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.290\njust go of course I just want\nto remove all those permissions.\n\n644\n00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.680\nAnd you click apply.\n\n645\n00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.915\nWell, when you do that So\nit's a bad day when system,\n\n646\n00:33:38.915 --> 00:33:41.947\nin other word the operating system\ntells you, \"I'm not going te be able\n\n647\n00:33:41.947 --> 00:33:45.128\naccess this.\" So just kind of be aware\nonce you remove those permissions,\n\n648\n00:33:45.128 --> 00:33:47.791\nthat means you have to go back,\nand go okay what do we have to do.\n\n649\n00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:49.672\nSo there are a lot of\ndifferent things here.\n\n650\n00:33:49.672 --> 00:33:53.901\nThis is not the time to To just go,\nflip it, yeah, click click click,\n\n651\n00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:56.740\nbecause you can lock yourself out easily.\n\n652\n00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.450\n>> You can.\n\n653\n00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:59.320\nNow, we won't have time,\nif we have time later,\n\n654\n00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.640\nI'll tell you a horror story about what I\ndid when I was first learning the stuff,\n\n655\n00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.970\nbut for now, Ronnie, looking at the clock,\nwe're about out of time for this episode.\n\n656\n00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.460\nSo we're gonna step away, but\n\n657\n00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.200\nthere's more NTFS permissions to talk\nabout, as well as shared permissions.\n\n658\n00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.830\nWe haven't even touched those, so check\nout the next segment when you get time.\n\n659\n00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.270\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n660\n00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.150\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n661\n00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.415\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n662\n00:34:21.415 -->

00:00:16.530\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.430\nHow are you Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.310\nI am doing well today it's another\ngreat day to talk about some windows 7.\n\n6\n00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.700\nAnd we're actually continuing\non episode that we actually had\n\n7\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.470\ncreated a little bit earlier\ntalking about access control.\n\n8\n00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.420\n>> Absolutely there's a lot involved\nwhen we talk about permissions and\n\n9\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.490\nwe just scratched the surface\nin our previous episode.\n\n10\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.510\nWe're gonna continue right along and we're\ngonna jump right into the middle here so\n\n11\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.150\nif you're Haven't seen that\nother episode on access control.\n\n12\n00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.400\nMake sure you check that out first.\n\n13\n00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.190\nIt'll make a lot of this show\nmake a little more sense.\n\n14\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.130\nSo, we're gonna dive back into it.\n\n15\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.130\nWe've still got that good old\nshow notes folder set up.\n\n16\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.510\nAnd the next thing we wanna talk\nabout is effective permissions.\n\n17\n00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.040\nRight?\n\n18\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.600\nAnd when we talk about effective\npermissions, we have to understand that.\n\n19\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.790\nNTFS permissions are cumulative.\n\n20\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.930\nWhat that means is as a user, you can\nbelong to several different groups.\n\n21\n00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.560\nAll right?\n\n22\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.690\nAnd normally when we assign permissions,\n\n23\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.910\nbest practice says we assign\npermissions to groups, not to users.\n\n24\n00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.580\nIt's a much easier way to\nmanage our permissions.\n\n25\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.560\nBut I might belong to more than one group\n\n26\n00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.020\nWhat happens if one group\ngets read permission?\n\n27\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.620\nLet's say I belong to, oh, I've got\nan example here that we can show you.\n\n28\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.820\nI've got the Show Notes folder and\nI'm gonna pull up its properties, and\n\n29\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.080\nI go to the security tab and I can see\nthe hosts have read and execute, right?\n\n30\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.070\nSo they've been assigned read and execute.\n\n31\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.739\nI'm gonna click edit and\nI'm gonna add a group called managers.\n\n32\n00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.400\nAnd I'm going to give them managers.\n\n33\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.000\nI'm actually going uncheck these defaults\nso we can make this demo a little better.\n\n34\n00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.700\nI'm going to give the managers\nwrite permissions.\n\n35\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.780\nSo hosts have read.\n\n36\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.530\nManagers have write.\n\n37\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.580\nNow the question is, what would happen\nif I had an account that was in both.\n\n38\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.100\nI've got an account\ncalled Don Bizet in here.\n\n39\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.760\nDon is in the host group,\nhe's also in the managers group.\n\n40\n00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.030\nSo what permissions does he get?\n\n41\n00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.570\nAnd what would think, Ronnie?\n\n42\n00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.430\n>> When it comes down to understanding\nthe idea of using those permissions,\n\n43\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.790\nthose permissions will actually combine\ntogether and they will become cumulative,\n\n44\n00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.260\nso for Don he will actually get\nthe higher set of permissions, and\n\n45\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.730\nalso you said the write permissions, and\nhe'll get all the write permissions as\n\n46\n00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.600\nwell\n>> So, that,\n\n47\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.280\nyou actually have to make sure you pay\nattention to, or you may be thinking that\n\n48\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.050\nyou're limiting Don by adding him into\na group that looks like it doesn't have as\n\n49\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.270\nmany permission when you are actually just\ngiving him more permissions at times too.\n\n50\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.850\n>> That's right.\n\n51\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.140\nYou get to add up all the permissions,\n\n52\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.750\nassigned to all of the groups\nthat you belong to.\n\n53\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.810\nThat's what they mean by cumulative,\nso since Dawn is in the host group and\n\n54\n00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.700\nthey have read and\nexecute it's also in the manager's group\n\n55\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.730\nthat has right permission tha he should\nhave read, execute, and right permission.\n\n56\n00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.620\nHe needs to add them all up.\n\n57\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.150\nNow, how do we determine this?\n\n58\n00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.400\nHow do you going in and figure out?\n\n59\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.110\nWhat permissions does\nDawn have over resource?\n\n60\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.780\nOh Microsoft actually makes\nit pretty easy for us.\n\n61\n00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.670\nIf we go on to the security tab and\n\n62\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.150\nI click advanced, I can go to what's\ncalled the Effective Permissions Tab.\n\n63\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.170\nAnd all this is is a place\nto figure that out.\n\n64\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.270\nI'll click select and\nI'll find Don's account, Don Bizet, and\n\n65\n00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.390\nI can see that sure enough He has write\npermissions as well as read permissions.\n\n66\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.860\nThere's no group over there\nthat has both read and write.\n\n67\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.590\nHosts have read, managers has write.\n\n68\n00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.030\nSo that shows you that it is\nadding those permissions up.\n\n69\n00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.960\nThat's what we call,\nit's a cumulative effect.\n\n70\n00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.460\nand it's very useful when\nwe are applying permission.\n\n71\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.030\nNow sometimes we have to worry\nabout the way that when you know,\n\n72\n00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.410\nwhen are trouble-shooting that's\nreally what you need to know.\n\n73\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.600\nIf I go look at the access control\nlist I know what host's have,\n\n74\n00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.180\nI know what manager's have, I might now\nknow what groups Don belongs to, right?\n\n75\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.550\nSo that effective permissions\ntab is an easy way to find out\n\n76\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.010\nIt looks at Don's account.\n\n77\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.930\nAnd it says all right,\nDon's in the host group.\n\n78\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.900\nThey get this.\n\n79\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.260\nDon's in the manager's group.\n\n80\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.930\nThey get this.\n\n81\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.290\nIt adds it all up for me, and\nit shows me exactly what he has.\n\n82\n00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.750\nNow what that effective permissions tab\ndoesn't do is it doesn't include things\n\n83\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.090\nlike The access method, because we can\nbase permissions on how you access it,\n\n84\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.060\nlike I can say you get this permission\nif you do an interactive log on, but\n\n85\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.230\nyou get a different set of permissions\nif you do a network-based log on.\n\n86\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.360\nIt doesn't include any of that,\nit doesn't include share permissions,\n\n87\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.380\nit's only looking At the NTFS permissions.\n\n88\n00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.450\nSo that's the first step.\n\n89\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.670\nThey're cumulative.\n\n90\n00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:49.240\nThe second thing I've got to worry about\nis the precedents of these permissions.\n\n91\n00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.200\nWhat if somebody belongs to one group\nthat has read and write permission and\n\n92\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.310\nthey belong to another group\nthat is denied write permission.\n\n93\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.730\nNow what do they get?\n\n94\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.350\nWhich one do they get?\n\n95\n00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.070\nand the rule of the thumb, Ronnie,\nis deny always overrides the allow.\n\n96\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.350\nRight?\n>> That is the rule of thumb is that when\n\n97\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.020\nyou do have the allow permissions and\nthe deny permissions,\n\n98\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.970\nthe deny generally overwrites\nthe actual allowed permissions, and\n\n99\n00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.350\nthat's actually going to be a little\nbit tricky as well sometimes.\n\n100\n00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.370\nBut you can actually see it working.\n\n101\n00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.940\nWhen we were actually in the previous\nepisode, we were actually watching Mike\n\n102\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.890\nkind of move around and\nactually add some allow permissions.\n\n103\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.600\nAnd all he had to do was actually\nclick on one of those deny permissions\n\n104\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.660\nthat were on the other side, and\nall those allow permissions disappeared.\n\n105\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.450\nSo I think that's usually\nthe standard rule.\n\n106\n00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.850\nIt is, but, there is an exception,\nthere's always an exception.\n\n107\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.450\nA deny overrides the allow,\n\n108\n00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.620\nexcept an explicit allow can\noverride an inherited deny.\n\n109\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.600\nAnd sometimes we need to do that.\n\n110\n00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.420\nLet's modify my Show Notes\npermissions here, again.\n\n111\n00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.420\nLet's go up here, and this would not\nbe a practical example, but let's go to\n\n112\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.600\nthe hosts And we're gonna click edit,\nand I'm gonna find my hosts permission.\n\n113\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.700\nAnd instead, I'm going to deny\nthem full control, right.\n\n114\n00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.880\nSo the hosts denied full control, and\n\n115\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.530\nI'll go ahead and\nclick OK to apply those changes.\n\n116\n00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.500\nIt's gonna warn me that denies are bad,\nbecause, again,\n\n117\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.670\nthey can override all\nthose other permissions.\n\n118\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.770\nyou could belong to 10 different\ngroups that were given full control.\n\n119\n00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.670\nIf you're denied control by just\none group, it's going to win.\n\n120\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.850\nExcept for the whole explicit thing.\n\n121\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:34.620\nWatch this.\n\n122\n00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.420\nIf I go, so now Hosts are denied control.\n\n123\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.850\nI'm going to go down to the inside there\nand pull up the properties for Windows 7.\n\n124\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.870\nAnd as we expect, the host's have\ninherited that deny permission.\n\n125\n00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.090\nI'm going to click edit, and I'm going to\nclick add, and I'm going to add Ronnie.\n\n126\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.990\nAnd I can't spell Ronnie,\nthere's too many Ns in there.\n\n127\n00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:02.380\nAll right?\n\n128\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.390\nAnd I'm gonna take Ronnie's account and\n\n129\n00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.620\nI'm gonna actually allow him read and\nwrite permissions over this.\n\n130\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.270\nRight?\n\n131\n00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.640\nAnd I'll go ahead and actually let's\njust give him read permission.\n\n132\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.810\nAll right we'll make\nit even easier to see.\n\n133\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.750\nSo I'm just gonna allow read.\n\n134\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.190\nAnd I'm gonna click O.K. to apply those\nchanges, and I'll go ahead and click O.K.\n\n135\n00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.140\njust to make sure those kick in.\n\n136\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.720\nPull those properties back up,\ngo to my security tab, click advanced.\n\n137\n00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:37.680\nGo to effective permissions and see\nwhat the heck permissions Ronny has now.\n\n138\n00:07:39.862 --> 00:07:43.145\nAll right and\nnotice he actually has ready permission.\n\n139\n00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:45.155\n>> Yeah.\n>> But the host group was denied\n\n140\n00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:48.445\nfull control which means he\nwas denied all permission but\n\n141\n00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:52.120\nthat explicit allow over\nrides the inherited deny.\n\n142\n00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.950\nThere might be times when\nthey need to do that.\n\n143\n00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.135\nI want to block the sales department in\ngeneral from being able to write at all.\n\n144\n00:07:58.135 --> 00:08:01.120\nThey can read, but\nthey can't write to anything.\n\n145\n00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.258\nBut, one of my salespeople needs\nto make changes that document.\n\n146\n00:08:04.258 --> 00:08:08.559\nI could go and I could explicitly\nallow that one person and\n\n147\n00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:12.960\nallow write and\nthat would overwrite the inherited deny.\n\n148\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.070\nAll right.\n\n149\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.810\nBut keep that in mind it's an explicit\nallow overrides An inherited deny.\n\n150\n00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:24.250\nIf there's an explicit allow and an\nexplicit deny well the deny is gonna win.\n\n151\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:30.430\nThe only time the deny loses, if it's an\ninherited deny and it's an explicit allow.\n\n152\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.810\nSo something we don't do all the time\nRonnie but it can definitely be handy.\n\n153\n00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.140\nIn certain scenarios.\n\n154\n00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.040\n>> It is no doubt one of the more\nconfusing aspects of understanding\n\n155\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.050\nthese permissions that we've talked about.\n\n156\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.660\nIt's already confusing enough because\nthere's five or six of them, right?\n\n157\n00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.510\nOn the folder permissions you have\nsix with the lists, photo contents,\n\n158\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.870\nand other ones that are the same.\n\n159\n00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.970\nWith the files you have those five.\n\n160\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.040\nBut then, on each one of them,\n\n161\n00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.310\nyou're actually going to either allow or\nyou're going to actually deny.\n\n162\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.700\nAnd then trying to keep those\nseparated out and go, okay,\n\n163\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.180\nif I get these inherited and I select a\ndeny, what's going to end up happening, or\n\n164\n00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.940\nif I actually Do something a little bit\nexplicit then get a inherited deny.\n\n165\n00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.030\nYeah, it's a lot to go over.\n\n166\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.840\nBut it's one of the things that you\ndefinitely have to at least be able to\n\n167\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.880\nlook at the effective permissions that\nyou have, be able to determine what that\n\n168\n00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.270\nperson's permissions actually\nare because sometimes when you look and\n\n169\n00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.470\ncan go, I know what's gonna happen.\n\n170\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.300\nRonnie's gonna actually get access and\nyou look at it, oh he's denied.\n\n171\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.320\nWell you have to backtrack through\nall that stuff and just work it out.\n\n172\n00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.470\nYou do need to spend\nsome time in learning it.\n\n173\n00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:42.310\nThat's the key, and if not,\nyou'll just assume that you know it and\n\n174\n00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.825\nthat's what will happen,\nyou'll get assumed.\n\n175\n00:09:44.825 --> 00:09:45.950\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes.\n\n176\n00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.650\nThat's exactly what will happen.\n\n177\n00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.230\nAnd we don't want that.\n\n178\n00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.390\nAlright, so that's a lot of information.\n\n179\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.840\n>> It is.\n>> But there's a couple of other just\n\n180\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.170\nminor things I want to mention,\nwell I shouldn't say minor, but a couple\n\n181\n00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.650\nother things I want to through in there\nbefore we move off of NTFS permissions.\n\n182\n00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.430\nAnd that is.\n\n183\n00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.350\nRemember explicit overrides inherited\nexcept for the explicited allow can\n\n184\n00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.410\noverride an inherited deny you really\nshould use groups rather then users this\n\n185\n00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.900\nis just a best practice you can assign\npermissions directly to user accounts And\n\n186\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.360\nin a small organization it might not\nseem like it's a bad idea right.\n\n187\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.870\nWe've got four hosts here,\nI can easily add those four people,\n\n188\n00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.680\ngive each one of them permissions.\n\n189\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.570\nIt's not recommended though because\nwhile that might work today,\n\n190\n00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.660\nit might not work tomorrow.\n\n191\n00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.240\nWhat happens when I have ten hosts,\n20 hosts, 50 hosts right?\n\n192\n00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.330\nNow I've got 50 people in\nthat access control list.\n\n193\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.390\nI've gotta scroll, scroll,\nscroll just to work my way through it.\n\n194\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.490\nOr I could have one entry in there.\n\n195\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.420\nI could all 50 of those hosts\nin a group called hosts,\n\n196\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.380\nput that group in that axis control list,\nand assign the permissions there.\n\n197\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.160\nIf you belong to a group,\n\n198\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.680\nyou get all the permissions that\nare assigned to that group.\n\n199\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.460\nIt makes assigning permissions so\nmuch easier.\n\n200\n00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.790\nIf that person no longer\nneeds those permissions.\n\n201\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.510\nI just take them out of the group and\nthen you no longer have the permissions.\n\n202\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.320\nThat group could be used on several\ndifferent resources across our network.\n\n203\n00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.740\nWe hire new hosts.\n\n204\n00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.590\nI don't have to go to each\none of those resources and\n\n205\n00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.450\nmodify the access control list.\n\n206\n00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.650\nI put them in the host group and I'm done.\n\n207\n00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.080\nThe host group already has the permissions\non all those different resources.\n\n208\n00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.640\nSo use groups, not users,\neven if it's just one user.\n\n209\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.010\nI know it sounds silly.\n\n210\n00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.500\nI will make a group,\nI'll put that one user in there.\n\n211\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.810\nLike you saw, Don Bissett, he was the only\nmember of that managers group, but\n\n212\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.500\nI didn't assign the permission Don,\nI assigned the permission to the group,\n\n213\n00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.670\nbecause I know, in the future,\nI might have more than one manager and\n\n214\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.580\nI don't want to have to go back and\ndo all that stuff again.\n\n215\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.470\nSo I did it to the group, right.\n\n216\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.260\nNTFS permissions are always in effect.\n\n217\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.530\nThey're always checked.\n\n218\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.700\nThere is no exception.\n\n219\n00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.690\nIf you log on to a machine and\nyou double-click on a file or\n\n220\n00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.610\nfolder it's going to make\nsure you have permission.\n\n221\n00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.260\nIf you connect to a shared folder\nthat's up on a file server somewhere or\n\n222\n00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.150\non somebody's elses machine,\nyou still have to have NTFS permissions.\n\n223\n00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.470\nIf you don't You will not get access.\n\n224\n00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.330\nSo NTFS permissions are always in effect.\n\n225\n00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.550\nAnd then remember about the group\nmembership thing we talked about\n\n226\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.530\nin the last episode.\n\n227\n00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.850\nIf I, if you, once you log on,\nthat's when you get your access token.\n\n228\n00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.220\nThat includes all the groups belong to.\n\n229\n00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.430\nSo if I make a change after you've\nlogged on, let's say I find out oh,\n\n230\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.010\nyou weren't in the host group.\n\n231\n00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.090\nAnd I go and add you to the host group.\n\n232\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.750\nWell you're still not gonna\nhave access to the resource.\n\n233\n00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.510\nYou need to log off,\nlog back on to get a new access token\n\n234\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.960\nthat reflects the change\nin your group membership.\n\n235\n00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.632\nThat way you can then get access and also\nremember as we saw, cache credentials-\n\n236\n00:12:32.632 --> 00:12:33.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.850\n>> Can throw you for a loop there, right?\n\n238\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.010\nSometimes Windows likes to speed up the\nlog on process by caching your credentials\n\n239\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:39.840\nso if they log off and\n\n240\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.760\nlog back on real quick They might not have\ntalked to the domain controller at all,\n\n241\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.910\nto get a new access token,\nto show that new group membership.\n\n242\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.010\nSo if they log off, log back on and\nthey still don't have access, and\n\n243\n00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.790\nyou know they're in that group,\nhave them log off and log back on again.\n\n244\n00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.530\nOr reboot the machine to flush out any\ncache, and that should fix your problem.\n\n245\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.790\n>> Now, Mike, when we talk about these\npermissions, the way that we've been doing\n\n246\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:06.270\nit, we've only really been doing\nit on our one individual computer.\n\n247\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:10.720\nso as long as people are actually using\nthat computer, that works just fine, but\n\n248\n00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.590\nusually, especially when we're\nactually networked together,\n\n249\n00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.130\nwe're accessing resources that\nare on the file share somewhere,\n\n250\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.865\nor maybe on another computer somewhere.\n\n251\n00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:23.765\nAnd when we do that, NTFS permissions\nare still going to apply, but I think we\n\n252\n00:13:23.765 --> 00:13:26.345\nalso have another set of permissions\nthat we have to deal with as well.\n\n253\n00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:27.375\n>> We do Ronnie, we do.\n\n254\n00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:31.045\nWhen you go across the network\nto access a resource,\n\n255\n00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:33.265\na second set of permissions kicks in.\n\n256\n00:13:33.265 --> 00:13:35.415\nThose are knows as share permissions,\nright?\n\n257\n00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:37.435\nWe learned back in APlus and\n\n258\n00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:42.210\nNetPlus that in order to make a resource\navailable to somebody else on the network\n\n259\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.410\nWe share it out and there\nare permissions associated with that.\n\n260\n00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.790\nSo, lets take a look the way that works.\n\n261\n00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.950\nWhat I am going to do Ronnie, because I\nknow we have really goofed up all those\n\n262\n00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.780\npermissions with some allows and denies\nand all kinds of inheritances So I'm just\n\n263\n00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.160\ngonna delete that folder and start over so\nwe can get a good look at what's going on.\n\n264\n00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.990\nSo I'm gonna create show\nnotes one more time.\n\n265\n00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.960\nAnd I'm a little too OCD\nto leave that typo there.\n\n266\n00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.360\nAnd then inside there I'm gonna\nmake a couple new folders.\n\n267\n00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.130\nI'm gonna call this one Windows 7.\n\n268\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:22.070\nAnd I'm going to make another new folder,\nand I'm going to call that one Linux+.\n\n269\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.930\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.970\nAnd then let's go back out and\nwe'll reset our NTFS permissions.\n\n271\n00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.120\nI'm gonna go to properties, security.\n\n272\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.600\nAnd I'm gonna click edit and I'm gonna\nclick add and I'm gonna yep exactly we'll\n\n273\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.890\nput that host group back in there and what\ndo you think the host should have read and\n\n274\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.140\nwrite probably\n>> Sure.\n\n275\n00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.030\n>> So we can make new nodes and\nstuff like that\n\n276\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.745\n>> But not modify.\n\n277\n00:14:47.745 --> 00:14:50.740\nDon' t want any of the dang\nhosts deleting anything.\n\n278\n00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.200\nSo we'll just give him read and write.\n\n279\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.230\nWe'll click Okay, and\nactually let's remove.\n\n280\n00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:00.780\nLet's click edit and I'm gonna remove,\noops, I didn't actually remove anything.\n\n281\n00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.620\nThere we go.\n\n282\n00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.370\nI'm gonna remove the authenticated user.\n\n283\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.310\nI can't do that from there.\n\n284\n00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.010\nAll right.\n\n285\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.240\n>> Good enough.\n\n286\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.300\nSo I've got it pretty much reset\nback to where hosts have read and\n\n287\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.200\nwrite permission over that resource.\n\n288\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.780\nNow, I want.\n\n289\n00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.390\nIt doesn't do any good for\nthe rest of the hosts.\n\n290\n00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.900\nThey have folders on my computer.\n\n291\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.460\nRight?\n\n292\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.000\nRonnie's not gonna come\nover to my computer and\n\n293\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.720\nlog on every time he needs\nto get into that folder.\n\n294\n00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.370\nDon's not gonna come over to my\ncomputer every time he needs to get\n\n295\n00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.550\naccess to the folder.\n\n296\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.800\nThey've got permissions, but\nthey can't use my computer so\n\n297\n00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.650\nwhat I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna share it out.\n\n298\n00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.940\nI'm gonna make it\navailable to the network.\n\n299\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:33.955\nSo I'm gonna right click.\n\n300\n00:15:33.955 --> 00:15:38.255\nClick on show notes and actually, you know\nwhat Ronnie, I just thought of something.\n\n301\n00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:39.215\nLet's do this.\n\n302\n00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:43.165\nLet's remove that permission real quick.\n\n303\n00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:44.695\nI'm going to take that,\nI'm going to edit that, and\n\n304\n00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:47.032\nwe're actually going to go backwards here.\n\n305\n00:15:47.032 --> 00:15:49.482\nRemove host, and I'm gonna click OK.\n\n306\n00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:50.562\n>> All right.\n\n307\n00:15:50.562 --> 00:15:51.362\n>> And OK.\n\n308\n00:15:51.362 --> 00:15:52.242\n>> Sounds good.\n>> So now,\n\n309\n00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:55.698\nI just created this folder, and,\ncuz I wanna show you, Microsoft has\n\n310\n00:15:55.698 --> 00:15:59.697\ntwo different ways that we can share a\nfolder, make it available on the network.\n\n311\n00:15:59.697 --> 00:16:00.945\nAnd One of them is relatively new.\n\n312\n00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:03.223\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I think it started with Windows Vista\n\n313\n00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:04.330\nif I remember right.\n\n314\n00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.760\nI'm gonna pull up\nthe properties of this folder.\n\n315\n00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.350\nLet me go to the sharing tabs,\nso not the security tab,\n\n316\n00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.340\nnow we're on the sharing tab.\n\n317\n00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.420\nAnd here you can see I've\ngot two different options.\n\n318\n00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.730\nI've got this share button And\nthen I've got this advanced share button.\n\n319\n00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.510\nNow you saw me.\n\n320\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.100\nI took away the host permissions,\njust to give you an example.\n\n321\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.890\nSo, the only thing that's left,\nauthenticated users,\n\n322\n00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.160\nsystem administrators and users.\n\n323\n00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.960\nDefault permissions picking\nup from the C drive itself.\n\n324\n00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.170\nWell I'm gonna go to sharing and\nI'm gonna click share.\n\n325\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.310\nThis is that new button.\n\n326\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.250\nThis is what they call\nthe basic sharing wizard.\n\n327\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.342\nAnd I'm going to add fine people.\n\n328\n00:16:41.342 --> 00:16:43.845\nI'm going to choose fine people.\n\n329\n00:16:43.845 --> 00:16:45.830\nI'm going to find that host group.\n\n330\n00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.570\nAnd I'm going to make sure I add them and\nI'm going to give them read and\n\n331\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.110\nwrite permission.\n\n332\n00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.070\nI'm going to click share.\n\n333\n00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:57.890\nIt's gonna share it.\n\n334\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.510\nIt's gonna give me my UNC path.\n\n335\n00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.120\nI'll click Done.\n\n336\n00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.200\nAnd I'll click Close just to\nmake sure that stuff kicks in.\n\n337\n00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.370\nNow here's what we've gotta understand,\n\n338\n00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:09.800\nremember we said NTFS\npermissions are always checked.\n\n339\n00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.230\nShared permissions are only checked\nif you're connecting to a share.\n\n340\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.240\nThat means a UNC path or\na mapped network drive, right.\n\n341\n00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.140\nYou need both.\n\n342\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.470\nIf I connect to a share, I need NTFS\npermissions cuz those are always checked\n\n343\n00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.060\nand I need share permission.\n\n344\n00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.030\nBecause those are checked if I'm\ngoing across the network, all right?\n\n345\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.020\nWhen I shared that, you saw me share\nit with the host and give them read and\n\n346\n00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.490\nwrite, but I didn't do anything\nwith the NTFS permissions, did I?\n\n347\n00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.880\nWell, let's see what happened.\n\n348\n00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.810\nSecurity, what?\n\n349\n00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.180\nThere is hosts.\n\n350\n00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:47.110\nThey were added and\nit gave them full control, right.\n\n351\n00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.040\nThat's what that basic\nsharing wizard does.\n\n352\n00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.040\nHe says, alright, you're going to\nshare this folder with the network and\n\n353\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.790\nyou want to give the host group read and\nwrite permissions,\n\n354\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.460\nthey're also going to need NTF permissions\nbecause those are always checked.\n\n355\n00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.930\nI'm gonna go ahead and take care of\nthat for you in the background so\n\n356\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.590\nthat you don't have to worry about it.\n\n357\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.490\nRight?\nThat's what the basic sharing wizard does.\n\n358\n00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.030\nIt says, these are the permissions\nyou're assigning via shared permissions.\n\n359\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.750\nI'm gonna try to duplicate\nthe same permissions over there\n\n360\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.140\nwith the NTFS permissions.\n\n361\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.640\nWorks really good for end users that\ndon't know anything about permissions.\n\n362\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.060\nRight?\nThey can click share,\n\n363\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.860\nthey can add somebody, and\nit does it for them in the background.\n\n364\n00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.250\nI would tell you as an IT person, I'm not\na big fan of this, how about you, Ronnie.\n\n365\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.240\n>> No, not really, but what Mike showed us\nthough is actually something that really\n\n366\n00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.990\nis something that really\nis something we can\n\n367\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.760\neven tell someone over\nthe phone if we need to.\n\n368\n00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.610\nTo be able to actually allow them to\nshare now, Mike showed you the way that\n\n369\n00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.270\nwe would go to it as administrators a lot\nof times, but the easiest way to do it is\n\n370\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.140\nto right click on the file itself and\nwe can pull that back up Mike.\n\n371\n00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.210\n>> Absolutely.\n\n372\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.020\nwhen we actually take a look at this,\nyou can right-click on it and\n\n373\n00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.290\nwhat you're looking for\nis where it says share with.\n\n374\n00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.970\nAnd, that's probably the easiest way\nat that point when you actually pull up\n\n375\n00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.610\nspecific people this is where Mike\ncould have actually typed in,\n\n376\n00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.630\nyou see it's the exact same\ninterface that we had before.\n\n377\n00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.260\nSo, you don't always have to go all right\nhere's what you're going to do Susan is\n\n378\n00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.090\nyou're going to right-click on that file,\nyou're going to go down to properties.\n\n379\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.170\nOn the sharing tab make sure you choose\nshare not advanced sharing You know and\n\n380\n00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.960\nall of a sudden that now\ntheir head's spinning.\n\n381\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.380\nBut here you can simply walk them through\nit by right clicking on the file.\n\n382\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:21.090\nIt does make it easy but\nit does give a lot more access, right.\n\n383\n00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.280\nYeah.\n>> Yeah it does.\n\n384\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.320\nI mean you saw I gave them read and\nwrite share permissions, but\n\n385\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.620\nwhen I look at the NTFS permissions,\nit gave them full control!\n\n386\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:33.660\nNow if you've watched our previous episode\non NTFS permissions you know that read and\n\n387\n00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.350\nwrite is not the same\nas full control right\n\n388\n00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.420\nfull control means they can do whatever\nthey want they can take ownership\n\n389\n00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.635\nthey can delete it they can change\npermissions way too many permissions And\n\n390\n00:19:43.635 --> 00:19:47.075\nif I'm gonna have to go back and second\nguess the wizard if I'm gonna have to\n\n391\n00:19:47.075 --> 00:19:50.235\nfix what the wizard does then\nI'm probably not gonna use it.\n\n392\n00:19:50.235 --> 00:19:53.485\nSo as Ronnie said great for an end user I\ncan walk them through it over the phone\n\n393\n00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:58.160\nand if they just wanna share a spreadsheet\nwith their co-worker Fantastic.\n\n394\n00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.010\nYou and I, in the IT world,\nwe're not going to use that.\n\n395\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.720\nSo lets do this.\n\n396\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.200\nI'm going to stop sharing this thing\nif I can...I think I can do it\n\n397\n00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.100\nthrough there, can't I?\n\n398\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.840\nI don't know Ronny how to not Share one.\n\n399\n00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.760\nUsing that guy.\n\n400\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.230\nLet's do, I can't.\n\n401\n00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:20.240\nYou know what?\n\n402\n00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.920\nI'm gonna make it really easy for us.\n\n403\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.910\nI'm going to rename it, because that will\nRemove my share, if I remember correctly.\n\n404\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.020\nYeah.\nThere we go.\n\n405\n00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.735\nWhich is actually a good thing to know,\nright?\n\n406\n00:20:32.735 --> 00:20:34.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you ever rename a folder like that,\n\n407\n00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.400\nit will take away all the share\npermissions as to your side.\n\n408\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.400\nIt'll no longer be shared,\ncuz you changed the name of it,\n\n409\n00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.070\nwhich would change the UNC path, right?\n\n410\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.390\nThe path we used to connect to that share.\n\n411\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.000\nAll right, so that is no longer shared.\n\n412\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.010\nI'm gonna pull up the properties.\n\n413\n00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.660\nAnd I'm going to go to that sharing table\nand I can see that it's not shared.\n\n414\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.090\nNow I'm going to show, oh and let's check\nthe permissions, did it remove them.\n\n415\n00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.250\nYou know,\nit left host with that full control again.\n\n416\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.630\nThat darn wizard, so\nI'm going to remove them.\n\n417\n00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.890\nSo, we can get back to\nwhat we want to see here.\n\n418\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.998\nSo, don't like the basics here, anyways.\n\n419\n00:21:07.998 --> 00:21:09.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For end-users, great.\n\n420\n00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.800\nNot for IT people.\n\n421\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.920\nSo, we're gonna click Advanced Sharing.\n\n422\n00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.440\nThis is the old-school way of doing it.\n\n423\n00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.560\nIt used to not be called Advanced Sharing.\n\n424\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.640\nIt was just called sharing\nbecause that was all we had.\n\n425\n00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.960\nNow, we've got the Basic Sharing so,\nthey had to call it something else.\n\n426\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.180\nI'll click, Share this folder.\n\n427\n00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.330\nAnd I can do things this way that I\ncan't do with that wizard, right?\n\n428\n00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.720\nI didn't get a chance to rename the share.\n\n429\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:36.410\nWhat if the folder's name was\nShowNotesITProTVJune2015?\n\n430\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:43.090\nI don't wanna type that in in a UNC path,\nI just wanna type in notes, right?\n\n431\n00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:47.350\nI can actually give it a different name\nhere than what the actual folder name is.\n\n432\n00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.060\nSo I can make it easier for my users\nto type in the UNC path, for example.\n\n433\n00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.410\nCan't do that with\nthe basic Sharing Wizard.\n\n434\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:58.310\nI can control how many people can\nconnect at the same time using this one,\n\n435\n00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.710\ncan't do that with the basic wizard.\n\n436\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.790\nIf more than 20 people\nconnect to my laptop,\n\n437\n00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.230\nthey're all trying to get that share\nat the same time My laptop chokes.\n\n438\n00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.680\nSo maybe I wanna bump that down to ten or\n\n439\n00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.260\nsomething like that,\ncan't do that with a basic wizard.\n\n440\n00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.680\nThen I'm gonna click,\nthere is a caching here as well,\n\n441\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.110\nyou can't change these caching\noptions with a basic wizard.\n\n442\n00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.420\nI'm gonna click Permissions,\nand I'm gonna click Add.\n\n443\n00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.040\nAnd I'm gonna find the host group.\n\n444\n00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.490\nAnd I'm gonna assign the host change.\n\n445\n00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.700\nNow notice the permissions are worded\na little bit differently here.\n\n446\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.820\nWhen we deal with these shared\npermissions the old school way,\n\n447\n00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.040\nthe wording's different.\n\n448\n00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.760\nFull control still means full control.\n\n449\n00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.340\nYou can do whatever you want.\n\n450\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.050\nRead means just read.\n\n451\n00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.680\nchange is basically like modify\nwhen it comes to NTSF permissions.\n\n452\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.720\nCreate new files,\ndelete files, things like that.\n\n453\n00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.280\nSo I'm gonna give them change and\nread and I'll click OK.\n\n454\n00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.100\nAnd I'll go ahead and apply that.\n\n455\n00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:54.800\nAnd I'll click OK.\n\n456\n00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.630\nNow, they have share permissions.\n\n457\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.040\nBut if I go to the security tab\nNotice the hosts aren't there.\n\n458\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.470\nIt didn't do it for me, this is not the\nwizard this is the old school way of doing\n\n459\n00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.660\nit but it gives me much more\ncontrol over it as well.\n\n460\n00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.980\nSo it's not like, I love,\nthis is the way I would do it.\n\n461\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.780\nBut you have to remember,\nhey i'm gonna share this folder out,\n\n462\n00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.420\nmy boss has come to me and said you\nneed to make a new share folder So\n\n463\n00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.150\neverybody has access to\nall those show notes.\n\n464\n00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.690\nYou go you create the folder\nthat you shared out.\n\n465\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.843\nYou forget to assign the NTFS\npermissions and nobody can get to it.\n\n466\n00:23:28.843 --> 00:23:30.600\n>> Right.\n>> Because NTFS permissions\n\n467\n00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.680\nare always checked.\n\n468\n00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.820\nIf you don't have those\nyou're not getting access.\n\n469\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.510\nI'm gonna click edit.\n\n470\n00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.060\nI'm gonna click add.\n\n471\n00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.739\nAnd I'm going to find my host group.\n\n472\n00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.160\nAnd now I can give them\nthe appropriate permission.\n\n473\n00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.763\nNow Ronnie here is where we've got to\ndo a little bit of thinking here right?\n\n474\n00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:53.060\nBecause we said earlier NTFS\npermissions were accumulative.\n\n475\n00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.772\nYou get to add them up from\nall the groups you belong to.\n\n476\n00:23:55.772 --> 00:23:57.486\nI get read from one group.\n\n477\n00:23:57.486 --> 00:24:01.167\nWrite from another group,\nmodify from a third group,\n\n478\n00:24:01.167 --> 00:24:05.130\nI get all those read,\nwrite, modify, it works.\n\n479\n00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.640\nBut when we combine share and\n\n480\n00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.560\nNTFS permissions because\nboth are gonna be checked.\n\n481\n00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.120\nIf I go across the network, it's gonna say\nwhat share permissions do you have and\n\n482\n00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.210\nwhat NTFS permissions do you have,\nand which one wins, Ronnie?\n\n483\n00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.070\n>> When we start combining\ntogether share permissions and\n\n484\n00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:25.130\nNTFS permissions, this is almost, I don't\nwanna say exactly the opposite but almost\n\n485\n00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:29.960\nthe opposite of what we get with the NTFS\npermissions that are accumulative.\n\n486\n00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.220\nWhen you go across a network share,\n\n487\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.670\nin other words from my computer to your\ncomputer, you have the shared folder\n\n488\n00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.050\nwe evaluate the share permissions and\nboth and when it comes down to it,\n\n489\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.680\nwe're gonna actually get the most\nrestrictive of those two permissions.\n\n490\n00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.520\nSo even if I actually got full control or\na change on that share permission,\n\n491\n00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.190\nbut Mike on the host folder only\ngave me read and execute or\n\n492\n00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:58.090\nread, well I'm only gonna get read\npermissions on that folder itself.\n\n493\n00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:59.540\nSo across the network,\n\n494\n00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:04.160\nit's gonna be that most restrictive\none and it actually works out.\n\n495\n00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.780\nIf I were then to log on to Mike's\ncomputer and get access to it, and\n\n496\n00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.350\nhe only had read permissions on NTFS,\nit would still apply in that way too.\n\n497\n00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.250\n>> It would.\nIn fact, let's do a little example here.\n\n498\n00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.930\nWhat I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna change it up just a wee bit.\n\n499\n00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.000\nI'm gonna go to Sharing.\n\n500\n00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.920\nI'm gonna click advanced sharing again to\nget back into those permissions and as\n\n501\n00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:27.100\nfar as the share permission for the host\ngo, I'm gonna give them read permission.\n\n502\n00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.870\nAnd I'm gonna click Apply on that one and\nclick OK, and click OK.\n\n503\n00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.890\nSo now they have share, read.\n\n504\n00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.720\nI'm gonna go to the Security tab.\n\n505\n00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.908\nAnd I'm going to go Host.\n\n506\n00:25:37.908 --> 00:25:41.942\nAnd I'm gonna click Edit > Choose host,\nand\n\n507\n00:25:41.942 --> 00:25:46.835\nI'm gonna give them read and\nwrite NTFS permissions.\n\n508\n00:25:46.835 --> 00:25:48.600\nAnd let's just see what happens.\n\n509\n00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.012\nLet's see what goes on here.\n\n510\n00:25:52.012 --> 00:25:55.173\nI'm gonna log off, because I'm\ncurrently logged on as administrator.\n\n511\n00:26:01.906 --> 00:26:04.870\nAnd I'm gonna log back on as somebody,\nI'm gonna log on as Ronnie,\n\n512\n00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.640\ncuz this already got his profile built.\n\n513\n00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.489\nWe shouldn't have to wait quite as long.\n\n514\n00:26:10.489 --> 00:26:12.261\nIf I can remember,\nwhat was your password again?\n\n515\n00:26:12.261 --> 00:26:13.149\nOne, two, three, four?\n\n516\n00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:14.770\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n517\n00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.090\n>> And I'm gonna log on as Ronnie.\n\n518\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:24.020\nAnd I'm gonna open up Windows Explorer,\nnavigate over to that folder.\n\n519\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.266\nGo into Show Notes.\n\n520\n00:26:29.266 --> 00:26:30.720\nGo into Windows 7.\n\n521\n00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.970\nI'll right-click New > Text Document,\n\n522\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:42.873\nand I'm gonna call it Access Control and\n\n523\n00:26:42.873 --> 00:26:46.530\nwhy is it not letting me?\n\n524\n00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.920\nIt did let me create it.\n\n525\n00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.000\nSo it is an interesting little thing.\n\n526\n00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.480\nIf I probably should have given\nhim a little more than that.\n\n527\n00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.760\nI gave him read and write so\nhe's able to create a new document, but\n\n528\n00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.356\nhe can't modify the document.\n\n529\n00:26:57.356 --> 00:26:58.828\nSo he wasn't able to rename it.\n\n530\n00:26:58.828 --> 00:27:00.398\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was my fault for\n\n531\n00:27:00.398 --> 00:27:03.460\nnot giving him enough permissions there.\n\n532\n00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:09.790\nBut anyway, we see that Ronnie is in fact\nable to write a file into that directory.\n\n533\n00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:10.610\nPerfect.\n\n534\n00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:15.610\nLet's Log off, and let's switch machines.\n\n535\n00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.995\nLet's go on over to another\nmachine on the network.\n\n536\n00:27:30.614 --> 00:27:33.700\nSo now, I'm on a different Windows 7 box,\nbut it's on the same network.\n\n537\n00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.020\nI'm gonna open up File Explorer, and\n\n538\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:43.649\nI'm gonna navigate to that share\nwhich is that UNC path backslash,\n\n539\n00:27:43.649 --> 00:27:48.704\nbackslash name of the computer\nbackslash name of the share.\n\n540\n00:27:48.704 --> 00:27:50.002\nAnd there we go.\n\n541\n00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:51.220\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n542\n00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.917\n>> I hope I have a sharing printer turned\n\n543\n00:27:53.917 --> 00:27:54.705\non there.\n\n544\n00:27:54.705 --> 00:27:57.590\nWe're navigating to Show Notes and\nin Windows 7.\n\n545\n00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.002\nAnd so just like before,\n\n546\n00:27:59.002 --> 00:28:02.577\neven though I'm reaching across\nthe network I can get in here.\n\n547\n00:28:02.577 --> 00:28:09.680\nI'm going to right-click New > Text\nDocument and it says no, I can't do it.\n\n548\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.840\nBecause when I was logged on to TECH01,\n\n549\n00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.340\nonly NTFS permissions were being checked,\nand I have read and write permission.\n\n550\n00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.930\nWhen I went to REF01 and logged on,\nI went across the network.\n\n551\n00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:27.185\nAnd now, NTFS permissions are checked and\nshared permissions are checked.\n\n552\n00:28:27.185 --> 00:28:31.230\nThe NTFS read right, but\nI only had share read.\n\n553\n00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.120\nWhich one's more limiting?\n\n554\n00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.810\nRead, that's what I get.\n\n555\n00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.645\nSo that's showing you that\nwhen you combine Share and\n\n556\n00:28:38.645 --> 00:28:41.585\nNTFS permissions it's the most\nrestrictive of the two.\n\n557\n00:28:41.585 --> 00:28:43.413\nSo that's something you've got to\nthink about when you're trouble\n\n558\n00:28:43.413 --> 00:28:44.400\nshooting permissions.\n\n559\n00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.960\nYou go and\nyou look at the resource and you say,\n\n560\n00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.450\nwell gosh you have NTFS full control.\n\n561\n00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.700\nWhy can't you make a new document?\n\n562\n00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.970\nMaybe they only have share read and\nthey're connecting across the network.\n\n563\n00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.658\nNow, Microsoft has changed-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n564\n00:28:56.658 --> 00:28:57.780\n>> Their tune recently.\n\n565\n00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.797\nOver the years, they have kind of\nshifted gears way back in the day,\n\n566\n00:29:02.797 --> 00:29:09.770\nback in 2000 and 2003, the best practice\nwas use that principle of least privilege.\n\n567\n00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.545\nAssign only the permissions\nthat they're supposed to have,\n\n568\n00:29:13.545 --> 00:29:17.754\nwhich meant I would have given the host\nread write permission NTFS and\n\n569\n00:29:17.754 --> 00:29:22.781\nI would give him share change, which would\nbe the same as read and write to modify.\n\n570\n00:29:22.781 --> 00:29:23.810\nAnd that's good.\n\n571\n00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.180\nBut recently though, people have started\ngoing a little bit of a different\n\n572\n00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.410\ndirection because it was kind of a pain\nsetting two different sets of permissions.\n\n573\n00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.970\nSo what a lot of people are doing\nnowadays is just going ahead and\n\n574\n00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:36.770\nsaying you know what,\nI'm gonna give you share full control.\n\n575\n00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:42.170\nIn fact, they might even add the everyone\ngroup and give it share full control.\n\n576\n00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:45.510\nBecause we know that NTFS\npermissions are always checked.\n\n577\n00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.980\nSo as long as I set those properly,\nonly the show host have read and\n\n578\n00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.990\nwrite permission,\nI removed the authenticate,\n\n579\n00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:55.010\nthat kind of thing, I can control all\nthe access through NTFS permissions.\n\n580\n00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.508\nCuz they're always checked and\n\n581\n00:29:56.508 --> 00:29:59.339\nanytime somebody has a problem\nconnecting to the resource,\n\n582\n00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:03.075\nI know it's not a share permission issue,\nbecause everyone has full control.\n\n583\n00:30:03.075 --> 00:30:03.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n584\n00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.010\nI've eliminated that as\na source of trouble.\n\n585\n00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.237\nNow, I don't know Ronnie, that's yes,\n\n586\n00:30:10.237 --> 00:30:11.447\nit's easier-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n587\n00:30:11.447 --> 00:30:12.728\n>> But sometimes the easiest way is\n\n588\n00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:13.730\nnot always the best way.\n\n589\n00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.850\nWhat do you think about that whole thing?\n\n590\n00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:15.840\n>> It's not always the best way.\n\n591\n00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.889\nI will tell you it is the real world way.\n\n592\n00:30:17.889 --> 00:30:18.859\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n593\n00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:22.970\nit is because of the ease of\nmanagement more than anything else.\n\n594\n00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.410\nWhen it comes down to troubleshooting and\nwe're having to do because there's six\n\n595\n00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:30.480\nthings that we're juggling, we wanna\nbe able to troubleshoot fairly quickly.\n\n596\n00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.480\nAnd it's not a share permission issue,\nand somebody I know said,\n\n597\n00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.140\nhow do you know that?\n\n598\n00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.490\nCuzI know that I gave them full control.\n\n599\n00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.770\nIf it's a permission issue at all,\nit's gonna be NTFS.\n\n600\n00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:45.414\nSo that way we eliminate that step, and\nbecause we are controlling it with NTFS,\n\n601\n00:30:45.414 --> 00:30:48.921\nwe always know what level of\npermission that we're giving.\n\n602\n00:30:48.921 --> 00:30:53.617\nWe're not having to try and determine that\ncalculated value of whether it's the share\n\n603\n00:30:53.617 --> 00:30:57.140\npermissions that restricted me or\nthe NTFS permissions.\n\n604\n00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.333\nSo in a real world situation\nyou're gonna see that more often.\n\n605\n00:31:01.333 --> 00:31:04.439\nI'm not gonna say you're gonna\nsee it a 100% of the time but\n\n606\n00:31:04.439 --> 00:31:07.854\nat least from what I've experienced,\nthat's what you tend to see.\n\n607\n00:31:07.854 --> 00:31:09.680\nIt just makes it easier on\nthe administrative side.\n\n608\n00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.700\n>> It really does and cuz when I\nfirst saw that ID, I was like what?\n\n609\n00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.419\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That just goes against everything I've\n\n610\n00:31:17.419 --> 00:31:21.110\nbeen taught, everything I've done and\nit kind of scared me.\n\n611\n00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.507\nBut in the end, if you really think about\nit, they're not gonna be able to connect\n\n612\n00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:26.690\nto that share and\nsomehow bypass NTFS permissions.\n\n613\n00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.230\n>> Right.\n>> They're always gonna be checked, so\n\n614\n00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.815\nI don't really have to worry about\nsomebody getting more access than\n\n615\n00:31:32.815 --> 00:31:37.405\nthey need or should have as long as\nI've set my NTFS permissions correctly.\n\n616\n00:31:37.405 --> 00:31:40.579\nSo I've shifted as well Ronnie-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n617\n00:31:40.579 --> 00:31:42.170\n>> I don't wanna say its the lazy admin\n\n618\n00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:46.163\nway of doing things they're just simplify\nthings and that's really what we're after.\n\n619\n00:31:46.163 --> 00:31:48.910\nI wanna reduce the number\nof calls to the Help Desk.\n\n620\n00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.260\nI don't want people calling up all\nthe time going gosh, I can't get access.\n\n621\n00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.100\nAnd then the Help Desk has to\ntroubleshoot NTFS permissions,\n\n622\n00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.160\nas well as share permissions.\n\n623\n00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.590\nNow certain environments, high-security\nenvironments, they might say-\n\n624\n00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.246\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n625\n00:32:01.246 --> 00:32:01.997\n>> That's horrible, action.\n\n626\n00:32:01.997 --> 00:32:03.639\n>> Yeah.\n>> Don't listen to that guy on ITProTV.\n\n627\n00:32:03.639 --> 00:32:04.139\nHe doesn't know-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n628\n00:32:04.139 --> 00:32:05.399\n>> What he's talking about.\n\n629\n00:32:05.399 --> 00:32:07.673\nYou'd better only assign the share\n\n630\n00:32:07.673 --> 00:32:10.097\npermissions that they need and fine,\n\n631\n00:32:10.097 --> 00:32:12.118\ndo that.\nDon't argue with them and say,\n\n632\n00:32:12.118 --> 00:32:14.278\nno Mike said, this is the way to do it.\n\n633\n00:32:14.278 --> 00:32:14.838\nNo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n634\n00:32:14.838 --> 00:32:16.030\n>> Do it their way.\n\n635\n00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.180\nI'm just saying that we're seeing kind\nof a shift in the way we do it and\n\n636\n00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.510\na lot of people are doing it another way.\n\n637\n00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.919\nI would not be offended though-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n638\n00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:25.374\n>> If you still did it the old way\n\n639\n00:32:25.374 --> 00:32:29.260\neverywhere, but just understand a lot\nof people do everyone full control.\n\n640\n00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.230\nSo if you get a job and you're out\nthere troubleshooting a resource and\n\n641\n00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.958\nyou see everyone full control.\n\n642\n00:32:33.958 --> 00:32:34.458\n>> Don't change it.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n643\n00:32:34.458 --> 00:32:35.593\n>> Don't immediately go to\n\n644\n00:32:35.593 --> 00:32:36.620\nthe administrator and\n\n645\n00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.400\ngo, oh my gosh, what are you doing this\nis crazy, why would anybody do that?\n\n646\n00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.763\nLot of people really are doing that now.\n\n647\n00:32:41.763 --> 00:32:47.287\n>> That is the nature of us trying to\nsimplify it, so that we can actually\n\n648\n00:32:47.287 --> 00:32:52.264\nwork on more important things and\nthat is the truth of things.\n\n649\n00:32:52.264 --> 00:32:55.020\nAnd it really does,\nit helps us to control access.\n\n650\n00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.620\nSo anyway that we do it,\nNTFS permission seems to be the key piece,\n\n651\n00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.530\nthat really allows us to control access\nthe way that our users actually need us\n\n652\n00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.870\nto control them to be able\nto give the limited or\n\n653\n00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.470\nthe principle of least privilege,\nwhen we need it.\n\n654\n00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.920\nAnd so knowing those,\nbeing familiar with those,\n\n655\n00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.410\nthere’s no way that you\ncan get around that.\n\n656\n00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.810\nYou just have to spend\ntime looking at it and\n\n657\n00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:20.219\ndealing with it daily until it\nbecomes second nature to you.\n\n658\n00:33:20.219 --> 00:33:20.921\n>> Absolutely.\n\n659\n00:33:20.921 --> 00:33:23.610\nWell Ronnie, looking at the clock,\nwe’re about out of time.\n\n660\n00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.012\nBut I think we’ve covered NTFS and\nshare permissions pretty well.\n\n661\n00:33:27.012 --> 00:33:28.320\nAnything else we can think of?\n\n662\n00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.650\n>> Not really.\n\n663\n00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:33.590\nLike we said, take a look at them,\nmake sure you understand them,\n\n664\n00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.175\nyou're going to deal with it\nmore often than you think.\n\n665\n00:33:35.175 --> 00:33:36.738\nAnd especially if you don't understand it,\n\n666\n00:33:36.738 --> 00:33:38.848\nyou're going to deal with it\na lot more often than you think.\n\n667\n00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:41.003\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, Ladies and gentlemen,\n\n668\n00:33:41.003 --> 00:33:43.160\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this show.\n\n669\n00:33:43.160 -->

00:00:15.170\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.750\nAnd with me today is Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.630\nHow are you, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.530\n>> Hi, I'm doing fine today.\n\n7\n00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.970\nIt's another beautiful day outside,\nbut we're actually inside in the nice,\n\n8\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.720\ncool air conditioning,\nwhich means it's a great day,\n\n9\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.480\nbecause we get to talk\nabout Windows 7 some more.\n\n10\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.940\n>> It is the best part of IT,\nworking inside.\n\n11\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.658\n>> That's right.\n\n12\n00:00:30.658 --> 00:00:32.300\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n13\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.550\nYeah, we're continuing on with\nour supporting Windows 7 and\n\n14\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.410\ntoday Ronnie we're gonna look\nat my nemesis [LAUGH] and\n\n15\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.630\nthat is printers don't like me and\n\n16\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.115\nI don't like them they always seem to\nbe the root of the problem [LAUGH] or\n\n17\n00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.860\nthey always seem to be a problem and\nbut they're really not that bad.\n\n18\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.180\nOnce we get to understand\nwhat the heck is going on.\n\n19\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.010\nOr I hope that's what\nyou're going to tell me?\n\n20\n00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.510\n>> Mike, they're not bad for you.\n\n21\n00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.310\nNormally when there is a printer problem,\nyou just say, ask Ronnie.\n\n22\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.810\n>> Ronnie.\n\n23\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.210\n>> That's a big problem.\n\n24\n00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.900\n>> Call that guy right there.\n\n25\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.140\n>> Not a big problem for you.\n\n26\n00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.140\nBut I do the same thing.\n\n27\n00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.360\nI go, oh yeah, Mike told me he was\ngoing to take care of that anyways.\n\n28\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.140\nAnd then we're back in\nour unusual cycle of,\n\n29\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.210\nwe'll just keep feeding\nthat to each other.\n\n30\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.980\nBut printers are one of the main output\ndevices that we have on our network and\n\n31\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.170\nit is one of the devices that really has\nto be functioning just about all the time.\n\n32\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.690\nWe always make a joke about\nthis in IT support and\n\n33\n00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.040\naround here when we have\nto do stuff like this.\n\n34\n00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.830\nIs that there are two things\nthat would drive every\n\n35\n00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.400\nuser around here absolutely insane.\n\n36\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.800\nOne is when email stops moving for\n.45 nanoseconds.\n\n37\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.390\nAll of the sudden somebody\nsays I can't get my email,\n\n38\n00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.130\nand all the sudden you go back,\nand go oh, I just got you.\n\n39\n00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.850\nSorry I didn't mean to disturb you.\n\n40\n00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.740\nThat last, you know, ripping out of\nthe eyeballs, or the glare, you know,\n\n41\n00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.920\nthe x-ray eyes that are glaring at you\nthat the e-mail didn't come through.\n\n42\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.640\nThat's one of them.\n\n43\n00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.540\nNumber two I'm going to\nguarantee it is printing.\n\n44\n00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.630\nWhen people can't print,\n[SOUND] it absolutely drives people nuts.\n\n45\n00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.895\n>> Absolutely.\n\n46\n00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, because printing is\n\n47\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.310\nreally the only way to get a hard\ncopy of what I've got on my computer.\n\n48\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.890\nRight?\nEverything we do Is on the computer, it's\n\n49\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.190\neither on my computer locally, or it's up\nthere on a shared folder on the network,\n\n50\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.790\nor on somebody else's computer,\nsometimes I need the tangible object.\n\n51\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.850\nI've gotta drop it in the mail or I need\nsomebody to actually sign something.\n\n52\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.040\nI need a hard copy of it.\n\n53\n00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.920\nThat means I've gotta\nsend it to a printer.\n\n54\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.650\nThat's what gets it from that electronic\nform into that, so very important.\n\n55\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.290\nThey're But they are a source of\nproblem because they're used so much,\n\n56\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.380\nI think, that it's just,\nthere are gonna be problems now and again.\n\n57\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.320\n>> Well, it's another piece of hardware\nthat you and I have to deal with.\n\n58\n00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.930\nIt's not only our computer,\nit not only the operating system having\n\n59\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.620\nto just work with it and go okay,\noh here's the setting that's wrong.\n\n60\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.490\nI'll just remove this check box.\n\n61\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.950\nNow you have another complete piece of\nhardware that you might actually connect\n\n62\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.840\nto your own computer, or it could be\nout there on the network somewhere and\n\n63\n00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.930\nyou still have to connect to that somehow.\n\n64\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.770\nAnd then get it to actually talk, and\n\n65\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.260\nwork, and\nprint the way that you want to, it\n\n66\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.500\ncan be challenging when you actually have\nto deal with issues like that very easily.\n\n67\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.870\nOne, the good thing is with Windows\n7 today, printing even from the local\n\n68\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.140\ncomputer has gotten so much easier and\nthis is probably even been easy since,\n\n69\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.400\nI hate to say it, days of Windows XP\nbecause of plug and play.\n\n70\n00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.100\nWe really are not challenged anymore\nby the installation of printers.\n\n71\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.880\nNow, Mike and I, I don't know,\n\n72\n00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.125\nMike may actually have a better\nexperience than I did.\n\n73\n00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:37.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I remember actually being\n\n74\n00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.270\nable to install a wrong\nprint driver by accident.\n\n75\n00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.340\nYeah, just you install the print\ndriver on the computer and\n\n76\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.700\nyou go, yeah, that should work.\n\n77\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.540\nAnd you go to print and\nit prints out 42 sheets of paper with\n\n78\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.170\none line one the very edge of that top\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.330\n>> You know,\n\n80\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.690\nof maybe three of those sheets of paper,\nbut it spit out 32,\n\n81\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.650\n40 sheets of paper for you or it looks\nlike machine code is coming out of there.\n\n82\n00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.690\nYeah, it looks like machine\ncode is coming out.\n\n83\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.820\n>> It's like what the heck is this?\n\n84\n00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.570\nWhat's going on?\n\n85\n00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.280\n>> And it's so unusual because those\ndays have pretty much disappeared.\n\n86\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.990\nBut, there is a chance though,\n\n87\n00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.520\nthat you may still have to manually\ninstall a printer in Windows 7.\n\n88\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.140\nIt's probably not gonna happen too often,\nbut that is a problem.\n\n89\n00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.350\nWhy?\nWell, most of us have never done it.\n\n90\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.840\nMost of us don't ever want\nto have to do it, but\n\n91\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.210\nit is something you should\nknow as a technician as well.\n\n92\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.280\nUsually for physical printers it's\nfairly easy and we'll walk through that.\n\n93\n00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.930\nWe also need to take a look at some\nnetwork issues that can also crop up,\n\n94\n00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.480\nas well, with printers too.\n\n95\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.730\nAnd so,\nwe want to actually talk about that.\n\n96\n00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.680\nEspecially when you're printing to\nthe big centralized business machine\n\n97\n00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.085\nthat prints bolts, staples,\nsteams, presses, you name it.\n\n98\n00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:45.905\nThat thing.\n\n99\n00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:47.475\nI always joke about it.\n\n100\n00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:49.830\nThe one that we have here,\nit costs more than my car.\n\n101\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.955\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's because my car is cheap.\n\n102\n00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:52.765\n>> Right.\n\n103\n00:04:52.765 --> 00:04:54.865\n>> But, it won't make me a cup of coffee.\n\n104\n00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:56.270\n>> Yeah, come on.\n\n105\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.920\nKind of get a little bit\ndisturbed by that, too.\n\n106\n00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.740\nAnd then, of course,\n\n107\n00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.280\nwe actually have to worry about print\nserver issues, even on the network, too.\n\n108\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.350\nAnd we want to make sure you\nunderstand some of those.\n\n109\n00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.980\nAnd then lastly,\n\n110\n00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.320\nwe'll talk about some of the driver\nissues that we can come up with.\n\n111\n00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.980\nNow, I mention the drivers, we want to\ntalk a little bit more about that in\n\n112\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.310\ndetail when we start taking\na look at printer issues.\n\n113\n00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.010\nSo, some of the things that we have to\nbe just fairly comfortable with, and\n\n114\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.260\nI bet that you're comfortable with this,\n\n115\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.580\nbut a good one to always go over is just\nthe physical installation of a printer.\n\n116\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.050\nBelieve it or not,\ntoday printers are easy.\n\n117\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.960\nYou plug them in, and they just work.\n\n118\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.920\nRight?\n\n119\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.510\nI don't remember the last time that\nI really had to do anything else.\n\n120\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.350\n>> I mean, just about every printer you\nbuy now a days is either gonna be hooked\n\n121\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.700\nup via USB,\nwhich means it's plug and play.\n\n122\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.740\nYou plug it into the machine and plug and\n\n123\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.950\nplay should detect the hardware,\nfigure out what driver.\n\n124\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.590\nYou might have to pop in\na disc from the manufacturer.\n\n125\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.560\nOr it's a wireless printer, so as long\nas you're on the same wireless network\n\n126\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.690\nwe go and add printers, and\nwe can find the printer and add it.\n\n127\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.760\nOr it's the network printer which means\nwe run a network cable into it, right?\n\n128\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.890\nIt's probably got some type of interface\nwhere we can set an IP address, so\n\n129\n00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.160\nreally installing you don't\nuse the serial port anymore.\n\n130\n00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.990\nYou don't use those com ports,\nnothing like that.\n\n131\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.590\nThe old LP.\n\n132\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.560\nWas it the LPT port I think?\n\n133\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.420\n>> Right.\n>> If I remember way back as to when, but\n\n134\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.290\nit's all USB and wi-fi.\n\n135\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.210\n>> Yeah, you would think\nthat's all that you need, and\n\n136\n00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.920\nthat you're ready to go and\neverything should be good.\n\n137\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.560\nWindows 7 they also do something\nthat they call point and print.\n\n138\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.780\nPoint and print is exactly\nwhat Mike's talking about.\n\n139\n00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.660\nIt's using the plug and\n\n140\n00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.640\nplay technology, but they also went ahead\nand started saying look, the only types of\n\n141\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.530\nprint drivers we'll actually accept\nare also gonna be signed print drivers and\n\n142\n00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.240\nthat means, in other words,\nwe verify that the code works\n\n143\n00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.370\nwe're not going to let you put some\nforeign device on just by accident.\n\n144\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.110\nNow can you do it?\n\n145\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.590\nYes, you can actually override it if you\nwant to by manually installing those print\n\n146\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.820\ndrivers but you have to actually\nunderstand what's gonna happen so\n\n147\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.980\nlet's go ahead and show you an example\nof what we're talking about.\n\n148\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.760\nWe'll kind of run through a dry run of\njust a regular USB type of printer and\n\n149\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.250\nthen we'll talk about a manual\ninstallation as well.\n\n150\n00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.810\n>> Okay?\n\n151\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.970\nSo I'm going to go ahead and show you\nwhat we're going to do here, okay?\n\n152\n00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.010\nSo I've got a Windows 7 popped\nup on my computer here.\n\n153\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.980\nAnd there's already a couple of different\nof network printers attached this, but\n\n154\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.020\nit's over here on the second\ncolumn of my start menu,\n\n155\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.660\nwhere it says devices and printers,\nthat allows me to view that.\n\n156\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.770\nAnd so you can see that there's actually\na printer over here with an IP address and\n\n157\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.100\nyou can also attach, of course,\nnetwork printers that way.\n\n158\n00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.880\nHere's one that's been locally installed.\n\n159\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.840\nAnd then there's a couple\nof other ones here, and\n\n160\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.420\nsome that were actually just\ninside of Windows itself.\n\n161\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.640\nAnd these are logical printers.\n\n162\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.270\nThey're software representations\nof these printers.\n\n163\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.450\nNow, if you are actually going ahead and\njust buying one and plugging it in,\n\n164\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.610\nUSB all of a sudden you actually end\nup seeing that that will appear.\n\n165\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.960\nRight away and\nyou don't ever have to worry about it.\n\n166\n00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.580\nAnd that is the end of it.\n\n167\n00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.540\nBut there is a chance,\n\n168\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.890\nhopefully a very slim chance that you will\nnever actually have to do one manually.\n\n169\n00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.830\nBut if you do you actually need to\nunderstand what's gonna happen.\n\n170\n00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.080\nBecause of the way Windows 7 works,\nit will automatically look for\n\n171\n00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.828\na printer that will match\nwhatever you actually plug in.\n\n172\n00:08:01.828 --> 00:08:03.572\nTo a USB port.\n\n173\n00:08:03.572 --> 00:08:05.436\nSo if I wanted to add another one here,\n\n174\n00:08:05.436 --> 00:08:08.550\nI just clicked on the add printer\nin the upper left hand corner.\n\n175\n00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.930\nWhat type of printer do\nyou want to install?\n\n176\n00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.640\nNotice I have these 2 options.\n\n177\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.670\nLet's just say it says,\nadd a local printer.\n\n178\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.550\nAnd it says, use this option only\nif you don't have a USB printer.\n\n179\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.880\nWindows automatically installs USB\nprinters when you plug them in.\n\n180\n00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.540\nNow what in the world is this about then?\n\n181\n00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.190\nWhat they're actually saying is some\nof the stuff that Mike was mentioning.\n\n182\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.111\nIf I take a look at this list,\nthe LPT ports and the com ports and\n\n183\n00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:35.657\nthose com ports, those are the ones\nthat we take away and the LPT ports.\n\n184\n00:08:35.657 --> 00:08:40.241\nWhen you plug a physical printer in there,\nWindows 7 doesn't go, oh, let me go and\n\n185\n00:08:40.241 --> 00:08:44.210\nlook at my driver store here and\nfind the appropriate print driver.\n\n186\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:44.734\nIt says,\n\n187\n00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:49.138\nyou've got a device plugged into this\nport that I really don't want you to use.\n\n188\n00:08:49.138 --> 00:08:50.193\n>> Unknown device.\n\n189\n00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:55.010\n>> It says unknown device,\nI don't really want you using this but\n\n190\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.430\nif you wanna plug something\nin that's fine but\n\n191\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.160\nat this point you will have to manually\nactually provide the correct driver.\n\n192\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.630\n>> Because there's no way for\nit to tell what that device is\n\n193\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.641\nthat you've plugged in right it\ndoesn't support plug and play.\n\n194\n00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:10.740\nUSB, that device will send all\nkinds of information over, plug and\n\n195\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.840\nplay can detect it, figure out what it is,\nget all the information, we're good to go.\n\n196\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.910\nYou plug in something in the LPT port,\nit says oh,\n\n197\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.590\nthere's something plugged in,\nI don't know what it is.\n\n198\n00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.910\nYou're gonna have to help me out.\n\n199\n00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.440\n>> Yeah, I don't really care what it is,\nwhat it's trying to tell us.\n\n200\n00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.920\nIt just says, if you're gonna do this,\nhere's what you have the option to do.\n\n201\n00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.560\nNow even though, remember that\nWindows does come with a list of\n\n202\n00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.330\nall of these available\nprinters that are in there.\n\n203\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.915\nAnd you actually see that the majority of\nthem, they have this little certificate\n\n204\n00:09:36.915 --> 00:09:39.335\nbeside them that tells you\nthat this is digitally signed.\n\n205\n00:09:39.335 --> 00:09:41.825\nYou will not find in here a list or\n\n206\n00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:44.535\na driver that's not gonna\nbe digitally signed.\n\n207\n00:09:44.535 --> 00:09:46.950\nMicrosoft is not gonna allow that.\n\n208\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.503\nBut, let's say that you have some\nunusual printer, that for one reason or\n\n209\n00:09:51.503 --> 00:09:56.272\nanother, that printer has just worked so\nwell, it's been around forever and\n\n210\n00:09:56.272 --> 00:09:58.530\na day, nobody is gonna get rid of it.\n\n211\n00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.794\nAnd you have a print driver that's\nstill out there on the network and\n\n212\n00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:05.780\nyou need to put it in there, well this\nis where you're gonna go to do that.\n\n213\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.550\nWhat you're gonna have is, more than\nlikely is you're gonna have that on a USB\n\n214\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.010\nthumb drive that you can transfer over.\n\n215\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.960\nYou can have it on a floppy disk, and\n\n216\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.470\nthat's actually what Windows\n7 would prefer you to do.\n\n217\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.640\nIt's strange, but over here on this right\nhand corner, notice it says Have Disk,\n\n218\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.740\nif I select that right there, you can see,\nMike can you see that letter right there?\n\n219\n00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.953\n>> I cannot, but it looks like A.\n\n220\n00:10:25.953 --> 00:10:28.747\n>> It looks like A,\nA colon is what it actually looks like.\n\n221\n00:10:28.747 --> 00:10:29.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n222\n00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.760\nlook at the upper left-hand corner here.\n\n223\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.230\nIt's saying look, insert the\nmanufacturer's, it says installation disk,\n\n224\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.450\nbut it's a floppy disk.\n\n225\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.470\nIt gives you a picture\nof a floppy disk here.\n\n226\n00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.430\nThen yeah, go ahead and\ninsert that floppy disk in there for you.\n\n227\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.480\nI don't even remember the last time\nI actually put a floppy disk into\n\n228\n00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.250\na disk player.\n\n229\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.200\n>> Had a machine that\nactually had a floppy in it.\n\n230\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.115\nI'm scrambling around for\nmy external floppy drive at this point.\n\n231\n00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:50.736\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, so\n\n232\n00:10:50.736 --> 00:10:53.660\nmore than likely you're\nnot gonna use a floppy.\n\n233\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.420\nYou're just gonna copy that,\neither to a folder on your computer or\n\n234\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.250\nprobably on a USB drive and plug that in.\n\n235\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.700\nAnd then, at that point, of course,\nWindows will go ahead and\n\n236\n00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.930\nactually start installing the driver for\nyou.\n\n237\n00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:10.420\nNow, this can work, I'm not gonna tell\nyou it can work 100% of the time.\n\n238\n00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.800\nBecause it can work or\nit can actually look at you go yeah,\n\n239\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.470\nthat driver may work, it may not.\n\n240\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.980\nThe only way for\n\n241\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.340\nyou to tell is after you get it\ninstalled is to try and print something.\n\n242\n00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.400\nIf everything works then you're fine.\n\n243\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.434\nOr if all of a sudden now you go and\nprint, and it says,\n\n244\n00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:27.058\nI didn't find your driver.\n\n245\n00:11:27.058 --> 00:11:28.651\nThat means that for one reason or\n\n246\n00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:31.610\nanother that driver did not make\nit to where it needed to go.\n\n247\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.490\nIf something like that happens well that's\nwhen you actually have to break out\n\n248\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.450\nthe command prompt if you're\ngonna do anything like this.\n\n249\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.980\nSo, you can walk through, and\n\n250\n00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.860\nit may actually give you an actual\nprinter icon there, but it may not.\n\n251\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.890\nNow, if that doesn't happen,\nright, and hopefully, like I said,\n\n252\n00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.500\nyou'll never have to do this.\n\n253\n00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.120\nBut there are times when you have\nto manually install a driver, and\n\n254\n00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.900\nthis doesn't have to just be print\ndrivers, it can be any driver at all.\n\n255\n00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.874\nYou're gonna open up the command prompt,\nand\n\n256\n00:11:58.874 --> 00:12:02.236\nlet me enlarge that a little bit so\nthat we can see it.\n\n257\n00:12:05.117 --> 00:12:08.190\nMake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n258\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.357\n>> I thank you for that.\n\n259\n00:12:09.357 --> 00:12:14.119\n>> [LAUGH] And so\nfrom here there is a little utility that\n\n260\n00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:17.180\nhas been around for quite a bit.\n\n261\n00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.990\nAnd it's actually gonna\nbe what's called pnputil.\n\n262\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.730\nAnd there you can actually\ntake that driver and say,\n\n263\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.900\nhey, let me manually\ninstall it at this point.\n\n264\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.320\nAnd that will put it in the proper\nlocation, hopefully get it registered,\n\n265\n00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.725\nget everything it actually needs to do.\n\n266\n00:12:28.725 --> 00:12:33.110\nFrom that point, it should work,\nbut it doesn't always have to work.\n\n267\n00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.870\nYou still have to deal with hardware\nissues, especially if it's so\n\n268\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.500\nold that you're plugging\nin through the LPT port.\n\n269\n00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.066\nFinding out if that cable's good.\n\n270\n00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:44.180\nYou name it,\nthere could be hardware issues galore.\n\n271\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.480\nBut let's say that you actually\nget everything installed.\n\n272\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.360\nAnd, now look, print out a test page,\ntest page looks like it works, but\n\n273\n00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.870\nthen it doesn't work all the time.\n\n274\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.770\nWell, you might be thinking okay well\nwe'll just start troubleshooting that\n\n275\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.570\npiece of hardware then.\n\n276\n00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.718\nWell, remember that Windows 7\nactually comes with over 20 different\n\n277\n00:13:02.718 --> 00:13:06.190\ntroubleshooters that makes it easy for\nyou to work through.\n\n278\n00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.132\nAnd actually makes it easier for you to\nguide the end user through as well and\n\n279\n00:13:09.132 --> 00:13:11.340\nthat's pretty much part of the key.\n\n280\n00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:17.530\nPrinter issues are not as easy sometimes,\nand I say that, but sometimes it's as easy\n\n281\n00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.750\nas just going over there and turning it\noff and turning it back on and it works.\n\n282\n00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.070\nI use that more often than\nI realize a lot of times.\n\n283\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.425\n>> If it goes beyond that,\nthat's when I call Ronnie.\n\n284\n00:13:25.425 --> 00:13:27.030\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's when.\n\n285\n00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.583\nBut I've also seen it where it\ndoesn't work exactly like that.\n\n286\n00:13:30.583 --> 00:13:33.635\nAnd so the good thing is you have\nto logically then run through some\n\n287\n00:13:33.635 --> 00:13:37.578\nthe troubleshooting methodology you would\nhave actually learned doing the support\n\n288\n00:13:37.578 --> 00:13:38.820\nstuff that you do.\n\n289\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.986\nBut just to show you another helpful hint\nfor you to be able to do something like\n\n290\n00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:46.890\nthis, if I go in and click on Start,\nand I go to Control Panel.\n\n291\n00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.361\nInside of Control Panel, I'm gonna go up\nto the System and Security and then into\n\n292\n00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:55.730\nthe Action Center cuz that's where all\nof the troubleshooters actually are.\n\n293\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.800\nAnd then notice there's\nTroubleshooting right here.\n\n294\n00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.670\nAnd then, inside of there, I can go to\nHardware and Sound and then, of course,\n\n295\n00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.410\nif you take a look at this list,\noh look at that, Printers.\n\n296\n00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.549\nAnd it says troubleshoot problems\npreventing printing from completing, and\n\n297\n00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:15.560\nof course it will walk you through some\nof the different aspect that you might\n\n298\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.704\nactually be dealing with at this point.\n\n299\n00:14:17.704 --> 00:14:21.469\nIf everything actually looks installed,\nbut you are still having a problem it will\n\n300\n00:14:21.469 --> 00:14:23.990\ngive you this little\nwizard to walk through.\n\n301\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.653\nSo being out,\nactually running as the administrator, and\n\n302\n00:14:26.653 --> 00:14:28.590\napply repairs automatically.\n\n303\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.290\nOr do you simply want it to go through and\nfind out what else is happening?\n\n304\n00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.000\nNotice it identifies all of the printers\nthat you have installed on there.\n\n305\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.590\nAnd what if all of a sudden you said hey,\n\n306\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.340\nI know I installed it but\nmy printer is not listed.\n\n307\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.130\nWell, I can select that option and\nthen it will actually go ahead and\n\n308\n00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.990\ntell you what are the most common\nthings that you can find out.\n\n309\n00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.210\nNow you may actually,\nkind of take a look at this, and\n\n310\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.190\nrealize something like I have done here.\n\n311\n00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:59.560\nIt says no physical printers installed and\nI have done this for a friend before.\n\n312\n00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.280\nI know that this sounds strange but\n\n313\n00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.760\nthe printer was sitting right\nthere next to the computer.\n\n314\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.210\nAnd I went ahead, and I said,\nI installed the printer correctly,\n\n315\n00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.950\neverything worked, I just forgot to\nplug the printer to the computer.\n\n316\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:10.650\nI'd done that,\n\n317\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.059\nI was like, I'm gonna set this printer up\nand all I have to do is plug the cable in.\n\n318\n00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:16.980\nAnd that's all it was just simple\nas something like that it's telling\n\n319\n00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.780\nyou to check that.\n\n320\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.790\nIt says hardware changes might\nnot have actually been detected.\n\n321\n00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.040\nSo from this point,\n\n322\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.435\nit actually just leads you to what you\ncould actually be taking a look at.\n\n323\n00:15:25.435 --> 00:15:29.724\nSo sometimes just figuring\nout the physical issues,\n\n324\n00:15:29.724 --> 00:15:34.107\nwhether it's actually\nthe computer can see it or not,\n\n325\n00:15:34.107 --> 00:15:39.250\nwhether or not that printer is\nactually on, is paper involved,\n\n326\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.986\nis the toner cartridge missing,\nyou name it.\n\n327\n00:15:42.986 --> 00:15:45.963\nThere's a bunch of different\nthings that can go on physically,\n\n328\n00:15:45.963 --> 00:15:49.159\nusing some of these utilities that\nwe just showed you is actually kind\n\n329\n00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:52.660\nof a neat thing just when we're\ndealing with that local machine.\n\n330\n00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.858\nAnd having to actually\ntroubleshoot that a lot of times.\n\n331\n00:15:54.858 --> 00:15:58.940\n>> You know, I've seen where I've had a\nUSB based printer, it didn't recognize it.\n\n332\n00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.336\nAll I did was unplug the USB cable,\nplug it back in, and\n\n333\n00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:05.113\nthat triggered that process of detecting\nthat, hey there's new hardware out here.\n\n334\n00:16:05.113 --> 00:16:09.305\nYou know, sometimes Windows gets busy in\nthe background Maybe something happens,\n\n335\n00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:12.940\nyou plug it in and\nit doesn't automatically detect it.\n\n336\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.370\nIt just sits there and does nothing so you\ncan just unplug it and plug it back in.\n\n337\n00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.020\nOr, you can power cycle the printer.\n\n338\n00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.780\nSometimes that'll get it to\nrecognize that new hardware.\n\n339\n00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.340\nHardware as well, so\na couple of different options.\n\n340\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.870\n>> And so that's kind of the one on\nthe local printer and you may what,\n\n341\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.110\nwhy are you worried about that?\n\n342\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.940\nWell, because sometimes users really don't\nknow what is going on on their machines.\n\n343\n00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.910\nAnd it may not be or excuse me it may be\nwhere it was just setup incorrectly so\n\n344\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.470\nverify usually we don't have to\nworry about it because USB and\n\n345\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.600\nplug and play does it fine and\nwe don't ever have to worry about it but\n\n346\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.280\nif there is a chance that if you have\na manually set printer hopefully you won't\n\n347\n00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.460\nBut if there is, those are kind of some\nof the things you can look out for\n\n348\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.160\nwhen you have to deal with it.\n\n349\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.510\nBut more commonly on our networks is\ngoing to be the infamous network printer.\n\n350\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.520\n>> The big, bad network printers\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.680\n>> You know, those bizhubs and\n\n352\n00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.410\nthings like that.\n\n353\n00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.790\nBecause in the end, for a business,\nthose big printers, as Ronnie said,\n\n354\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.400\ncost more than his car.\n\n355\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.420\nBut there's something we call total\ncost of ownership, or TCO, and\n\n356\n00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.480\non those big printers,\nusually the TCO is lower.\n\n357\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.250\nIf you think about it, I'm gonna go and\nbuy a little HP desk jets and\n\n358\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.420\nput it on everybody's desk, right,\nso everybody has their own printer.\n\n359\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.000\nWell, I've gotta buy ink for those things,\n\n360\n00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.450\nyou guys know how expensive\nthe ink can be for those guys.\n\n361\n00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.700\nI've gotta worry about making sure\nevery one of them has printer.\n\n362\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.110\nI mean, maybe a full time job.\n\n363\n00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.580\nHey, I've got no paper in my printer.\n\n364\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.680\nYou get it, put in there.\n\n365\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.930\nI've got no paper over here.\n\n366\n00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.000\nHey, I've got no ink here.\n\n367\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.210\nYou know, just a constant maintenance\nthing, whereas we put one big printer on\n\n368\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.780\nthe network that everybody can print to,\nit can handle all different print jobs,\n\n369\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.830\nuses toner typically which is a little\nbit cheaper than the ink in the end run.\n\n370\n00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:51.530\nGot one place to stock up paper and\nthings like that so What they'll say is,\n\n371\n00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.420\nthose big printers might be\nmore of an initial investment,\n\n372\n00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.860\nbut they have a lower\ntotal cost of ownership.\n\n373\n00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.260\nAnd it does make maintenance a lot\neasier because I've got one model.\n\n374\n00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.230\nIf I buy everybody individual printers,\nhe's got an HP 960,\n\n375\n00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.090\nthey've got a Lexmark 250, I've gotta\nlearn all these different printers.\n\n376\n00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.830\nI got just that one big one,\nthat's all I need.\n\n377\n00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:12.990\nAs David in the chat room says,\n\n378\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.310\nI got ten of them scattered\naround on different floors.\n\n379\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.120\nBut yeah, at least there's just\nthose I don't have to worry about\n\n380\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.150\nhundreds of individual printers.\n\n381\n00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.660\n>> When we start dealing with\nthose network printers and\n\n382\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.020\nwhen we talk on network printers that's\nnormally what we are talking about,\n\n383\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.640\nis the individual stand alone\nmachine that we are really\n\n384\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.480\nplugging network cable into and\nthen being able to print, everybody being\n\n385\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.990\nable to print to that machine\n>> And then normally there's a small\n\n386\n00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.020\ncomputer that's running inside of that and\nhandling all the printing on it's own.\n\n387\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.670\nBut we can also access the network printer\nby connecting to someone else's computer\n\n388\n00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.680\nthat has also got a printer attached to it\n\n389\n00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.700\nas long as it's been\nshared out properly too.\n\n390\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.150\nSo those are usually the two situations\nthat we end up seeing as well.\n\n391\n00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.820\nOne's what we call a print server and\n\n392\n00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.750\nthen the other one of course is\nthat stand alone network printer.\n\n393\n00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.950\nBoth of those really kind\nof reside in the networking\n\n394\n00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.670\nissues that we may have to deal with,\nespecially with printers.\n\n395\n00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:08.100\nSometimes the big printers, and as far\na physical issue goes on the network,\n\n396\n00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.140\njust like the one that\nwe have here on ours,\n\n397\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.560\nit takes a bit of time to warm up\nbefore it actually prints anything And\n\n398\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.180\nas long as everybody's using it\nthroughout the day, perfectly fine.\n\n399\n00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.160\nBut Mike, I've been here where I printed\nout the first thing in the morning and\n\n400\n00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.460\nI go, okay, it's not working.\n\n401\n00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.315\nAnd I might hit the print\nbutton like six times.\n\n402\n00:19:26.315 --> 00:19:29.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then it's still not working so\n\n403\n00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.270\nI come back,\nI hit another couple of times, and\n\n404\n00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.960\nthen finally the thing warms up and\nI get eight copies on that machine.\n\n405\n00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.280\n>> Yes, been there done that, absolutely.\n\n406\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.040\n>> Yeah eight copies so even some of the\n>> Physical things like that can\n\n407\n00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.780\nkind of cause a little bit of problems and\nconsternation for people.\n\n408\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.930\n>> And network congestion itself\ncan cause a delay in your printing.\n\n409\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.080\nIf you're sending a big print\njob across the network,\n\n410\n00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.090\nit's got to buffer over on\nthat printer and things, and\n\n411\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.790\nif your network is extremely busy,\nthat can slow that transmission down.\n\n412\n00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.220\n>> Yeah, and especially if other people\nare printing at the same time, and\n\n413\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.430\nit has to wait in line in the queue\n>> You name it,\n\n414\n00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.300\nthere's other things that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n415\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.010\nSo, of course, like everything else\nwe have to make sure that we have\n\n416\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.640\ngood network connectivity,\nmake sure that everything's up.\n\n417\n00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.830\nBut one of things we have to make\nsure that we can do, of course,\n\n418\n00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.700\nis see that printer on our network or on\nour computers so that we can print to it.\n\n419\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.150\nBut let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that as well.\n\n420\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.830\nSo if I were trying to make sure\nthat I could print to a printer,\n\n421\n00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.340\nI actually have to be able to\nsee it here on my machine.\n\n422\n00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.990\nI click on Start.\n\n423\n00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.480\nAnd then I can select devices and\nprinters, and there is actually three\n\n424\n00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.450\nother printers on this network that I\nwant to be able to get access to, or\n\n425\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.440\nat least one of those, too, so\n\n426\n00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.660\non this network I can just\ngot to add a printer and\n\n427\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.330\nthen with this option I'm gonna select add\na network, wireless, or bluetooth printer,\n\n428\n00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.040\nand notice there's actually three\ndifferent printers on this network.\n\n429\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.150\nOne's actually for marketing, another one\nfor development, another one here for\n\n430\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.380\nmanagement, and you may not actually\nadd all three of them in there.\n\n431\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.190\nWhy?\nBecause it may actually be protected,\n\n432\n00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.990\nyou may not actually be\nable to print something.\n\n433\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.760\nI don't expect to be able to\nprint to the management printer.\n\n434\n00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.500\nWhy?\nBecause I'm not part of management, but\n\n435\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.410\nwe may have one for the development team,\nwe may have one for the marketing team,\n\n436\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.370\nand I just made these categories up,\nwe're just one team.\n\n437\n00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.550\nBut overall though, we can actually\nset something like this up.\n\n438\n00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.600\nAnd then select it and notice that\nwhen I select it I can click Next.\n\n439\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.050\nNow, if it's not showing up,\n\n440\n00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.240\nI may actually have to do this\nmanual process instead, and\n\n441\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.000\nI can find it either in the Active\nDirectory network or even by the UNC path,\n\n442\n00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.670\nor, if I need to, if it has an assigned\nIP address, I can type that in as well.\n\n443\n00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.440\nAnd so\nit just really depends on what you need.\n\n444\n00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.750\nThese have actually been shared out\nfrom A machine that's called DCO1.\n\n445\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.760\nI'm going to select marketing and\nclick next.\n\n446\n00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.490\nAnd right here notice\nit's actually looking for\n\n447\n00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:50.120\na driver and that's going to finish\nthe installation at this point.\n\n448\n00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.560\nSo I've successfully\nadded this to my machine.\n\n449\n00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.450\nAnd I click next here.\n\n450\n00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.650\nAnd do I wanna set it as\na default printer at this point?\n\n451\n00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.460\nI can, and I'm just gonna go ahead and\nclick Finish, and that's perfectly fine.\n\n452\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.380\nAnd you see where it went out and\n\n453\n00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.090\ngot that photorealistic icon of that\nprinter that we're talking about.\n\n454\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.430\nNow, there's something strange here,\nMike, about this, right?\n\n455\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.210\nI'm logged on as myself, and so\nI'm actually able to do that.\n\n456\n00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.630\nBut if I were sharing this\nmachine Somebody else, though.\n\n457\n00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.360\nLet me log off.\n\n458\n00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.780\nAnd I'm gonna log on as Mike, here.\n\n459\n00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.150\nLet's see what else happens here, then.\n\n460\n00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.050\nTwo.\nLet me see if I can get\n\n461\n00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:26.940\nused to doing this.\n\n462\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.035\nLet me switch users.\n\n463\n00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:28.966\nOops.\n\n464\n00:22:35.165 --> 00:22:35.728\nCan't type.\n\n465\n00:22:38.656 --> 00:22:40.775\nSo when we log back in, Yeah.\n\n466\n00:22:40.775 --> 00:22:41.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I do.\n\n467\n00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.290\nI know your password.\n\n468\n00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.998\nIt's the same as your luggage.\n\n469\n00:22:44.998 --> 00:22:47.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if I log on as Mike now and\n\n470\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:51.130\nI click on start, devices, and printers.\n\n471\n00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:55.550\nMike, it doesn't look Like you have\naccess to that printer at all.\n\n472\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.920\n>> I don't see it, what happened.\n\n473\n00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.340\n>> Yeah, I mean what in\nthe world is going on with that.\n\n474\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.160\nWell, printers are actually not for\nthe entire machine, they're actually by.\n\n475\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.120\n>> By user profile.\n\n476\n00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.825\n>> Yeah, by user profile.\n\n477\n00:23:06.825 --> 00:23:10.795\nSo you may run into that issue as well\nwhen somebody says well I know that Ronnie\n\n478\n00:23:10.795 --> 00:23:15.815\nwas just printing off of that machine but\nnow here it is I logged in and\n\n479\n00:23:15.815 --> 00:23:20.950\nnow that printer's no longer there so\nit might just be a simple As\n\n480\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:26.085\nin selecting Add a printer and then\nselecting it here, selecting the same one.\n\n481\n00:23:26.085 --> 00:23:30.087\n[NOISE] All of a sudden,\nwe start seeing something else happen.\n\n482\n00:23:30.087 --> 00:23:31.420\nMike, what's going on?\n\n483\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.180\n>> I don't know, I guess I don't have\nany permissions for this printer, or\n\n484\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.060\nI definitely don't have as much as you,\nright?\n\n485\n00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:36.660\n>> Yeah.\n\n486\n00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.290\nSo it might be where they thought well,\nit's easy So now, let's say\n\n487\n00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:45.550\nJim comes over and says, it's just easy,\njust go ahead and add that printer in.\n\n488\n00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:49.830\nAnd now, all of a sudden, they're\nactually blocked by permission issues.\n\n489\n00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:54.150\nSo there's a lot of different things\nthat could prevent you from printing,\n\n490\n00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.420\nIt could be something, just something\nlike this where you're not actually\n\n491\n00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.260\nable to add that printer in\nwhich would be a hard day but.\n\n492\n00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.340\nIt's something that can be overcome, you\ncall the helpdesk or you tell them that\n\n493\n00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.180\nthey need to contact whoever it is that\ncan allow them to add this printer in,\n\n494\n00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:08.972\nbe ready to go.\n\n495\n00:24:08.972 --> 00:24:10.749\n>> Yeah, printers have permissions.\n\n496\n00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:14.424\nWhen you add a printer or\nyou share Share a printer, by default,\n\n497\n00:24:14.424 --> 00:24:16.874\nthe everyone group is given permission and\n\n498\n00:24:16.874 --> 00:24:20.770\nthe creator/owner groups is given\nmanage documents permission.\n\n499\n00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.450\nThat means anybody can print to the\nprinter, and they can manage any document\n\n500\n00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.350\njob that they've created\nbecause they're creator/owners.\n\n501\n00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.460\nBut, we can set up printers and\nwe can change those default permissions.\n\n502\n00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.000\nRight?\n\n503\n00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.120\nIf I've got a printer down in payroll\nthat has checks loaded up into it,\n\n504\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.290\nthat's all that printer\ndoes is print out checks,\n\n505\n00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.430\nI don't want somebody in the sales\ndepartment to be able to print to it.\n\n506\n00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.800\nThey could start printing their\nown checks if they wanted to.\n\n507\n00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.970\nSo we can definitely\ncontrol the permissions.\n\n508\n00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.510\nSo, that printer that I just tried to add,\nor\n\n509\n00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:52.520\nRyan tried to add under my account, maybe\nI'm not meant to print to that printer.\n\n510\n00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.590\nSo, that's why it prompted me for\nthose credentials.\n\n511\n00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.440\n>> It's amazing that something\nlike that can be just as simple,\n\n512\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.180\nbut maybe exactly what ends\nup happening here too.\n\n513\n00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.500\nSo, some of the other things that\ncan of course en up happening,\n\n514\n00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.510\nis that even if we actually\nhave the right permissions.\n\n515\n00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.940\nWe may still not be\nable to print here too.\n\n516\n00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.310\nLet's see if I can actually go and\nadd that one in.\n\n517\n00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.830\nOh look now all of a sudden,\n\n518\n00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:20.365\nwhat ended up happening it says,\nWindows cannot connect to the printer now.\n\n519\n00:25:20.365 --> 00:25:21.840\nMm-hm\n>> So sometimes,\n\n520\n00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.040\nit could just be something\nas simple as this too.\n\n521\n00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.040\nNow, you probably saw me switching\nfrom one computer to another.\n\n522\n00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.590\nIt's cuz I was doing\nsomething in the background,\n\n523\n00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.180\ntrying to emulate this as well.\n\n524\n00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.360\n>> I missed it, that was a good one.\n\n525\n00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.840\n>> So, all of a sudden, it could be\nthat we're actually in the middle of\n\n526\n00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.900\ntrying to print something or it could\nbe something like this where it says,\n\n527\n00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.920\noh, Windows can not actually\nconnect to the printer.\n\n528\n00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.000\nWell in a network setting, right We are\nactually going to connect and try to get\n\n529\n00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.050\naccess on Windows computers and we have to\nmake sure a couple of things are running.\n\n530\n00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:56.050\nOne, there has to be that principle or\nservice running and\n\n531\n00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:00.440\nif that principle or service is running\nAnd I'm actually connecting to another\n\n532\n00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.970\nmachine out there that's\nactually hosting that printer.\n\n533\n00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.770\nI'll just have to make sure that\nthere's something called work station,\n\n534\n00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.730\nI think, also has to be running as well.\n\n535\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.660\nSo on my machine, I can go and\nverify those things and services, and\n\n536\n00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.680\nverify that that is actually working.\n\n537\n00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.790\nSo I might go to Services.\n\n538\n00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.530\nI need to put on my glasses cuz now it's.\n\n539\n00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:20.050\nOops, see?\n\n540\n00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:21.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mistyped Services.\n\n541\n00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.410\nI should know that by now.\n\n542\n00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.530\nLet me select it here.\n\n543\n00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.492\nAnd the only thing I'm gonna\ndo is look in my Services, and\n\n544\n00:26:30.492 --> 00:26:34.660\nI'm gonna scroll down to the p's\nsince I have them alphabetized now.\n\n545\n00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.140\nAnd I'm gonna look for Print Spooler and\nit looks like it was started automatic.\n\n546\n00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.170\nThat's what I'm expecting to see.\n\n547\n00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.500\nAnd also, Workstation is the other one.\n\n548\n00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.450\nCuz I'm actually now the one that's\nactually using that printer.\n\n549\n00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.310\nBut then, if that actually seems to\nbe good, that means I have to go and\n\n550\n00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.220\ntrouble shoot on the other side.\n\n551\n00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.870\nAnd verify a couple of the services\nare also running over there.\n\n552\n00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.510\nSo here's the server I was manipulating so\n\n553\n00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.530\nMike can actually see and hopefully y'all\ndidn't see what I was doing either.\n\n554\n00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.770\nI was trying to do it really quick.\n\n555\n00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.610\nBut here, I just go back into this server.\n\n556\n00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.340\nAnd then,\nwe would verify some of the same things.\n\n557\n00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.900\nSo if I scroll down, I'm looking for that\nprinciple or service, so if I'm actually\n\n558\n00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:23.960\na print server I also need to have\nthe print spoiler service running as well.\n\n559\n00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.990\nDoesn't look good.\n\n560\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.965\n>> And Mike, this one does not look good,\nand that's cuz I disabled it.\n\n561\n00:27:27.965 --> 00:27:29.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it can be something like that.\n\n562\n00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.430\nIt could be that this printer, or\n\n563\n00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:36.040\nthis computer may actually be in a reboot\nat some point and I can't print.\n\n564\n00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.180\nSomething may happen where this print\nspooler doesn't start, or it's stuck for\n\n565\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.110\nsome reason.\n\n566\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.530\nYou can of course actually go ahead and\nstart that, and\n\n567\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.680\neverything would actually work.\n\n568\n00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.830\nNow, let me go ahead and click start.\n\n569\n00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.280\nAnd let that start.\n\n570\n00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.780\nThe other one,\nespecially on a print server,\n\n571\n00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.270\nis gonna be the Server one as well.\n\n572\n00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.570\nAnd I know it's tiny, but\nit says supports file, print, and\n\n573\n00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.800\nnamed pipe sharing over the network for\nthis computer.\n\n574\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.440\nSo if you're actually\nhosting the printer here,\n\n575\n00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.390\nwell that service has\nto be running as well.\n\n576\n00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.430\nSo You do have to check a couple of\nthings in the background on the network\n\n577\n00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.800\nto make sure that everything\nis actually working.\n\n578\n00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.110\nSo in networking and\ntroubleshooting network printers,\n\n579\n00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:21.020\nknow with what you have to actually\nhave to make it work first.\n\n580\n00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.620\nDon't worry about some of\nthe other things, right?\n\n581\n00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.080\nYou have to have network connectivity.\n\n582\n00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.490\nThese services have the be running.\n\n583\n00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.670\nOr you're probably not going\nto be able to print at least.\n\n584\n00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.770\nAnd that's gonna be a bad day because\nwe're gonna call the help desk and\n\n585\n00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.430\nI'm gonna have to deal with that printer.\n\n586\n00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.150\nSo you know a lot more complex than\njust plugging the darn thing in and\n\n587\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.290\nletting everybody print.\n\n588\n00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:41.620\nIt's got to be shared Figured out, it's\ngotta have the right permissions set on,\n\n589\n00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.230\nyou gotta have those services running.\n\n590\n00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.890\nLot of different things I can check when\nI'm troubleshooting the print process.\n\n591\n00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.400\n>> Right and just not the lead\nvalue you might be wondering well\n\n592\n00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.730\nwhat about those print permissions?\n\n593\n00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.880\nWhere the heck do you set those?\n\n594\n00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.130\nWell because it was actually on\nthis particular computer here,\n\n595\n00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.520\nthe one that's on the server, let me\nshow you where I actually adjust that.\n\n596\n00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.710\nI'm gonna go to control panel and\nthen hardware.\n\n597\n00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:08.040\nAnd up here under devices and\nprinters and there it is.\n\n598\n00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.480\nThere's the IPProTVMarketing.\n\n599\n00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.840\nAnd I right click.\n\n600\n00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.070\nThe only key thing that has changed\nreally from earlier editions,\n\n601\n00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.170\nbefore Vista, I mean.\n\n602\n00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.290\nWe used to go down to properties and\n\n603\n00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.630\neverything used to open up They had\nto add them to, I don't know why,\n\n604\n00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.150\nthe original properties-\n>> Ronnie,\n\n605\n00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.120\nI tell you I still do it every time.\n\n606\n00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.820\nRight click properties, oop,\nthat's the wrong one, close it.\n\n607\n00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.170\nRight click, printer properties,\nand then right there it is.\n\n608\n00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:39.430\n>> So it's right here that we'll go to\nwhat Mike was talking about, as well,\n\n609\n00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:41.090\nwhich is the security tab.\n\n610\n00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.860\nAnd there's our discretionary\naccess control list.\n\n611\n00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.070\nAnd if I select Mike Roderick.\n\n612\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.870\n>> Oh.\n>> Oh, Mike,\n\n613\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.390\nthis is why you weren't\nactually able to do that.\n\n614\n00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.920\nNotice you were actually denied\njust even the ability to print.\n\n615\n00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.000\nWhich also pretty much denied you\nthe ability to do anything else.\n\n616\n00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.630\n>> Yeah pretty much.\n\n617\n00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:57.610\n>> That you wanted to.\n\n618\n00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.490\n>> I am done.\n>> So it's one of these issues,\n\n619\n00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.800\nsomething like this, that you may\nactually have to troubleshoot.\n\n620\n00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.960\nSo looking at those different permissions.\n\n621\n00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.000\nNow there's only a couple of other\nthings that you also need to check.\n\n622\n00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.580\nAnd this would also apply true,\nespecially in networking,\n\n623\n00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.830\nthis is the one that has\nabsolutely killed me.\n\n624\n00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:16.515\nEven though you're.\n\n625\n00:30:16.515 --> 00:30:18.375\nYour nemesis is just printing in general?\n\n626\n00:30:18.375 --> 00:30:21.795\nMy nemesis is a specific printer\ncalled the HP 1022N, okay?\n\n627\n00:30:22.815 --> 00:30:25.465\nYes, I do know it by heart and that is-\n>> Is that one out there at\n\n628\n00:30:25.465 --> 00:30:25.975\nthe front desk?\n\n629\n00:30:25.975 --> 00:30:28.035\n>> It was., Yes, yes it was the one\nout there at the front desk.\n\n630\n00:30:28.035 --> 00:30:32.397\nThat has been my nemesis And\nI would battle and I would win for\n\n631\n00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:36.047\nsix weeks or so, and then it would\nbattle and it would win forever,\n\n632\n00:30:36.047 --> 00:30:37.507\nis what would end up happening.\n\n633\n00:30:37.507 --> 00:30:38.987\n>> And\nthat's my big problem with printers,\n\n634\n00:30:38.987 --> 00:30:41.362\nis they don't give up,\nthey come back at you.\n\n635\n00:30:41.362 --> 00:30:43.107\n>> [LAUGHS] They really do!\n\n636\n00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:45.757\nBut there's a couple of other things\nthat you also want to be aware of,\n\n637\n00:30:45.757 --> 00:30:47.327\nwhich is right here on the,\n\n638\n00:30:47.327 --> 00:30:51.600\nlet me make sure I show you the right tab,\nWhich is the sharing tap.\n\n639\n00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.720\nNow this one's not so much so,\nbut actually let me go\n\n640\n00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:00.100\nto another machine that will actually\nhelp up out a little bit easier here.\n\n641\n00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.340\nOn that sharing tab you also have\nthe ability to take a look at\n\n642\n00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.050\nsome of the different\nadditional print drivers.\n\n643\n00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.800\nIf I right click on this cannon and I go\ndown to printer properties And sharing.\n\n644\n00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:16.430\nIt's right down here that is also\nanother important concept that we have.\n\n645\n00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.130\nIf this printer is shared with users\nrunning on different versions of Windows\n\n646\n00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.130\nyou may actually want to\ninstall additional drivers.\n\n647\n00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:26.010\nIf I click on that It is right here.\n\n648\n00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:27.590\nNotice that X64, X86.\n\n649\n00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.640\nWhat is X64 and X86?\n\n650\n00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.980\n>> They're your 32 bit operating systems\nand your 64 bit operating systems and\n\n651\n00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.450\nthe drivers are not the same.\n\n652\n00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.470\nThey are not compatible.\n\n653\n00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.810\nSo when you install that\nprinter on your 64 bit machine,\n\n654\n00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:41.760\nit loads up the 64 bit driver, so\nyou can print if you share it out.\n\n655\n00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.000\nAnd other people connect\nwith a 64-bit machine,\n\n656\n00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.720\nthey can grab that driver from you and\nthey can print.\n\n657\n00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.080\nBut what about me on my 32-bit\noperating system, Ronnie?\n\n658\n00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.060\nI'm going to connect, I can see your\nprinter, you've got it shared out.\n\n659\n00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:57.480\nI've got permission so I'm able to add it,\nbut I go to print and I can't print.\n\n660\n00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.297\n>> It is, to say the least about it,\nit is frustrating as crazy, and\n\n661\n00:32:02.297 --> 00:32:06.076\nthis actually give you\nan option to overcome that.\n\n662\n00:32:06.076 --> 00:32:09.065\nThe one that we had,\nit gave you no option to overcome it.\n\n663\n00:32:09.065 --> 00:32:11.835\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the reason why is that we had been\n\n664\n00:32:11.835 --> 00:32:18.600\nusing that HP 1022 on a Windows XP machine\nfor, I'm gonna say two or three years.\n\n665\n00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.550\nAnd out of the blue, one day, right?\n\n666\n00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.660\nEverything was running on XP.\n\n667\n00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.620\nThen they decided, well,\n\n668\n00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:30.250\nwe're gonna actually switch that\nmachine over to a 64-bit edition of it.\n\n669\n00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:34.220\nAnd so they put a Windows 7 machine in,\nthey put it online and everything.\n\n670\n00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.250\nBut what they didn't realize is that\nthe clients that were trying to connect\n\n671\n00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:40.550\nin now,\nthey were all still running Windows XP.\n\n672\n00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.480\nAnd so for\nthe whole day they were frustrated,\n\n673\n00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.920\nto the point where, why can't we print?\n\n674\n00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.910\nCuz all we did was switch the machine out.\n\n675\n00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.800\nWe plugged the computer in,\nit found the driver for it.\n\n676\n00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.650\nWindows 7 says it's ready and\nit prints, but\n\n677\n00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.740\nthose machines that actually needed\naccess to it, they couldn't print.\n\n678\n00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.100\nI kind of said, well,\nwhat's happened here is fairly simple.\n\n679\n00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.970\nYou're trying to take 32-bit machines and\nprint them to a 64-bit driver.\n\n680\n00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.530\nIt's not going to work.\n\n681\n00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.020\nAnd they said, well, how do we fix it?\n\n682\n00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.920\nI'm like, well, you can't.\n\n683\n00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.440\nAt some point, right?\n\n684\n00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.320\nBut at that point, the reason why we\ncouldn't is that they didn't make a 32-bit\n\n685\n00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.100\ndriver for that printer anymore,\nthat would run on Windows 7.\n\n686\n00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.390\nThey had the one for\nXP, so what did we do?\n\n687\n00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:28.450\nManually PnPUtil, added that thing in and\n\n688\n00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:33.450\nit did work for several weeks,\nbefore it didn't work anymore.\n\n689\n00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:36.590\nSo it was not the permanent\nsolution that I wanted.\n\n690\n00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.540\nBut it was a solution that's out there.\n\n691\n00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.060\nSo man,\n\n692\n00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.890\nwhen it comes down to printers, there\nare a ton of issues that we can deal with.\n\n693\n00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.270\nPhysical issues.\n\n694\n00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.370\nWe can also take a look at those\nnetworking issues that we talked about.\n\n695\n00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:51.110\nWe can also see where it could be\non one side or the other, if we're\n\n696\n00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.505\nconnecting to the print server, or we're\nactually back here on our own computer.\n\n697\n00:33:54.505 --> 00:33:57.740\nAnd it can even be driver issues like\nwhat we just showed you, as well.\n\n698\n00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.100\nIs that actually everything\nthat there is possible?\n\n699\n00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.110\nNo, we haven't even scratched the surface\n\n700\n00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:07.640\nof what some of those different print\ndrivers can do and what they can't do, and\n\n701\n00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.905\nsome of the different things that\ncan incredibly funky with printers.\n\n702\n00:34:11.905 --> 00:34:14.505\n>> And\nmy favorite solution out of all of them,\n\n703\n00:34:14.505 --> 00:34:15.185\nRonnie,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n704\n00:34:15.185 --> 00:34:16.630\n>> Is known as the Office Space.\n\n705\n00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:19.325\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's a movie here in the U.S.\n\n706\n00:34:19.325 --> 00:34:22.825\ncalled Office Space, and they take\nthe printer out to the baseball field,\n\n707\n00:34:22.825 --> 00:34:25.040\nand proceed to beat it\nup with a baseball bat.\n\n708\n00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.265\nAnd that's my favorite method,\nif none of those other methods work.\n\n709\n00:34:28.265 --> 00:34:29.505\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n710\n00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:32.670\nit always works until the printer\ncosts more than your car.\n\n711\n00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.560\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then that's not the most viable\n\n712\n00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.030\noption that you have anymore, Mike.\n\n713\n00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.300\nWhen it's a little HP 1100 or\n\n714\n00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:43.490\n1300 LaserJet that's 20 years old,\nyeah, we do stuff like that.\n\n715\n00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:46.430\n>> It might be your last day of\nemployment, but you're gonna feel better.\n\n716\n00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:49.150\nNow, all kidding aside,\nthere's a lot of things we gotta look at.\n\n717\n00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:52.750\nFirst thing is, if it's a network printer,\nit's basic network connectivity.\n\n718\n00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.080\nI mean, we've gotta rule that out first.\n\n719\n00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.130\nThen we know these other steps\nthat we can take a look at.\n\n720\n00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:00.460\nWe've got troubleshooters built\nin there that we can use.\n\n721\n00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.940\nWe've gotta make sure the right\ndrivers are installed.\n\n722\n00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.590\nRemember other operating systems.\n\n723\n00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.250\nThink about who else is gonna\nbe connecting to that printer.\n\n724\n00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.450\nGotta make sure I have drivers loaded\nup for those operating systems and\n\n725\n00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:13.010\nthe different bit platforms as well,\n32-bit, 64-bit,\n\n726\n00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.150\nare gonna be different drivers.\n\n727\n00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:19.395\nXP versus Windows 7, different drivers, so\nyou've gotta have all that taken care of.\n\n728\n00:35:19.395 --> 00:35:21.230\nYou've got permissions to worry about.\n\n729\n00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:23.410\nYou've gotta make sure\nit's shared out properly,\n\n730\n00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:25.250\nand if you want other\npeople to connect to it.\n\n731\n00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.030\nYou've gotta know that UNC path.\n\n732\n00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.460\nIt's just like sharing a folder.\n\n733\n00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.730\nThe UNC for the printer is\ngonna be backslash backslash,\n\n734\n00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:36.200\nname of the computer that's sharing it,\nbackslash, name of the printer.\n\n735\n00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.595\nSo those basic troubleshooting steps can\nget you pretty far with most printers.\n\n736\n00:35:40.595 --> 00:35:43.754\nAnd hopefully that's\nall you will ever need,\n\n737\n00:35:43.754 --> 00:35:49.181\nthat entire list that Mike just kinda was\nable to tell you in about 30 seconds,\n\n738\n00:35:49.181 --> 00:35:53.090\nthat is the hope and the,\nreally, that I would say.\n\n739\n00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:56.850\nYeah, if you only had to deal with that,\nthat would be fine, that would be awesome.\n\n740\n00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.770\nAnd what you will also end up with, I\nhope that you don't, but you also end up,\n\n741\n00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:04.310\nI think, at least one time in your life,\nthere will be on printer model\n\n742\n00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:08.120\nthat you can get every other one to\nwork in your building but that one.\n\n743\n00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.453\nAnd you'll take that machine out,\nand you will shoot it.\n\n744\n00:36:10.453 --> 00:36:11.230\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n745\n00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.089\n>> That's what I do.\n\n746\n00:36:12.089 --> 00:36:14.957\n>> Keep a hammer in your tool bag and\nthen just give it a couple of whacks.\n\n747\n00:36:14.957 --> 00:36:16.709\nAnd go to the boss and say, I don't\nknow what happened to this printer.\n\n748\n00:36:16.709 --> 00:36:18.173\nI think we're gonna have to replace it.\n\n749\n00:36:18.173 --> 00:36:18.970\n>> And that's what we did.\n\n750\n00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.928\nWe finally replaced it,\nwhich was what we needed to.\n\n751\n00:36:20.928 --> 00:36:22.230\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well,\n\n752\n00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.610\nRonnie that's a lot of great\ninformation on printers, there.\n\n753\n00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.710\nAnything else we want to throw in\nbefore we call this episode a wrap?\n\n754\n00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:32.600\n>> No, just remember that this is one\nof the things, you have to realize,\n\n755\n00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.760\nthat this is going to be time critical,\nright?\n\n756\n00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:38.324\nSo, as much as we joke about it and\nwe work with it, this is the stuff that\n\n757\n00:36:38.324 --> 00:36:41.600\nsomebody is gonna be constantly\non you saying, did you fix it?\n\n758\n00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.060\nDid you fix it?\nDid you fix it?\n\n759\n00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.030\nAnd it's gonna be annoying, but\nyou're there to support them.\n\n760\n00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:50.900\nSo just kinda realize it's just gonna be\npart of your day that you have to do this.\n\n761\n00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.940\n>> And\nif you can get the printer working again-\n\n762\n00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.890\n>> Oh, you'll be a hero.\n\n763\n00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.460\n>> You will be the rock\nstar of the network.\n\n764\n00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.072\n>> You will be the hero.\n\n765\n00:36:56.072 --> 00:36:59.146\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, we want to thank everybody for\n\n766\n00:36:59.146 --> 00:37:00.163\ntuning in and watching.\n\n767\n00:37:00.163 --> 00:37:02.450\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n768\n00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:03.264\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n769\n00:37:03.264 --> 00:37:04.587\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n770\n00:37:04.587 --> 00:37:10.720\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:15.420\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.450\nWith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.200\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.320\n>> I am doing great today.\n\n7\n00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.641\nIt's another great day to be\nright here in the studio.\n\n8\n00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:24.380\nAnd we're taking less\nsupporting Windows 7.\n\n9\n00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.520\nThis is part of our tech skills series,\nso it's not really exam-driven.\n\n10\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.330\nWhat we're trying to do is make\nsure that as IT professionals,\n\n11\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.450\nif we're still running Windows 7, that we\nunderstand that there are a lot of details\n\n12\n00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.470\nthat we may not have actually covered.\n\n13\n00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.990\nAnd now we're actually\ntrying to go back and\n\n14\n00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.980\nmake sure that we actually cover all\nthe things that we want to cover.\n\n15\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.680\nRight, Mike?\n\n16\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.850\n>> Yeah, you know we love our\ncertifications around here.\n\n17\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.770\nWe're all about certifications.\n\n18\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.400\nBut it is funny sometimes how, Ronnie,\n\n19\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.610\nsome of the things they called in\ncertifications and some of the things that\n\n20\n00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.160\nwe need to know to be an efficient\nadministrator don't line up all that well.\n\n21\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.740\nSo that's the goal here, is to teach\nyou some of those things that we think\n\n22\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.560\nyou really need to know whether they\ncall it out on the certification or not.\n\n23\n00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.830\n>> There is no doubt that what ends\nup happening is fairly easy,right?\n\n24\n00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.650\nThey need to make it uniform,\nthey need to make it consistent.\n\n25\n00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.230\nBut this show is about\nstuff that we gonna write.\n\n26\n00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.880\nHere's stuff that we've also run into.\n\n27\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.740\nAnd even though they may line\nup with the exam objectives,\n\n28\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.420\nthese are things that we really consider\nsomething that, as a technician, or\n\n29\n00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.760\nas an enterprise administrator\nat some level, that we go,\n\n30\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.450\nyeah, that's something\nthat we need to configure.\n\n31\n00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270\nSo we're gonna be spending a lot of time,\nhere.\n\n32\n00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.280\nTaking some of those things that,\nas we said,\n\n33\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.110\nmay line up with those exam objectives.\n\n34\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.310\nBut it's really about understanding the\ndetails behind them and making sure that\n\n35\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.150\nwe can actually get into them and try and\ntroubleshoot them more than anything else.\n\n36\n00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.950\n>> Ronnie, so\nthe first thing you got lined up for\n\n37\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.960\nus here is good old\nInternet Explorer security settings.\n\n38\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.870\nAnd this is a big one, right.\n\n39\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.250\nIE is definitely a host of\nvulnerabilities associated with it.\n\n40\n00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.360\nOf course, there are patches and\nupdates to fix most of those, but really,\n\n41\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.420\nthere's a lot of configuration we can\ndo to really make that more secure.\n\n42\n00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.780\n>> There is no doubt that this is one\nof those big issues that we do face in\n\n43\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.800\nthe enterprise.\n\n44\n00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.740\nAnd the reason why is\njust about everybody and\n\n45\n00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.380\ntheir mother has a browser\non their computers.\n\n46\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.130\nAnd normally, inside of enterprise,\n\n47\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.590\nif you're running Windows 7, the default\nbrowser is gonna be Internet Explorer.\n\n48\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.470\nThe good thing is over the years, Internet\nExplorer has kept up in the sense that\n\n49\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.590\nthey've updated the product itself and\nmade it more secure over time.\n\n50\n00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.940\nBut it doesn't mean that it\nactually is an end-all onto itself\n\n51\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.070\nthat is 100% totally secure.\n\n52\n00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.070\nIt's always comparative in security,\n\n53\n00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.560\none browser versus another,\ndoing this and doing that.\n\n54\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.410\nBut everything that you and I could do\nto make it a little bit more secure\n\n55\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.790\nis pretty much the key in the way\nthat we want to understand this.\n\n56\n00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.930\nNow the problem that we have\nthough is in enterprises, right?\n\n57\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.290\nYou may find out that there was\nan application that you used to use\n\n58\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.880\nthat only is compatible\nwith Internet Explorer 6.\n\n59\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.210\nWell, it's time, I hate to say it,\nbesides anything else, it's time for\n\n60\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.620\nyou to at least upgrade your browser,\nif you are running something like that.\n\n61\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.640\nAnd by far, one of the most\nsecure things that you can do\n\n62\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.880\nis to make sure that you do run some\nof the latest and up to date browsers\n\n63\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.050\nthat you can because that is where\na lot of the different attacks come in.\n\n64\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.560\nAnd security issues that\nwe face is because it\n\n65\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.390\nfinds it's root inside of that browser and\nthey've taken advantage of the technology.\n\n66\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.680\nAnd the older it is,\nthe worse it's gonna be.\n\n67\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.560\nBut today, the newest browsers have\nsomething we call, protected mode and\n\n68\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.200\nthat's what we want to jump into.\n\n69\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.080\n>> All right.\nSo, Ronnie tell us, how is protected mode,\n\n70\n00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.530\nit sounds like it's gonna keep us safe.\n\n71\n00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.680\nWhat does it do for us?\n\n72\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.240\n>> Protected mode actually\nallows us to say look,\n\n73\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.110\nthe browsers gonna be limited\nin what it can access.\n\n74\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.830\nWhen we start running things and we get\nconnected, and we click on the link,\n\n75\n00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.310\nwell normally, whatever software that we\nclick on that we want to download and\n\n76\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.600\nrun, it installs and\nit can run on that system.\n\n77\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.270\nAnd that's with older browsers and\nthat's because they didn't check anything.\n\n78\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.260\nThey just said, yeah,\nsure, you wanna run it?\n\n79\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.005\nYou won't be able to run it.\n\n80\n00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:45.760\nWell, they've started realizing\nthat inside of Internet Explorer.\n\n81\n00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.520\nThe team that developed it said, look,\nthis is what we need to do instead.\n\n82\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.320\nNow with the advent of the UAC, the user\naccount control, and the ability to do\n\n83\n00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.750\nsomething else that we call virtual\nstorage spaces, it really did help.\n\n84\n00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.220\nBecause now all of that stuff that\ntends to run somewhere inside of your\n\n85\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.490\noperating system that it roots\nitself inside those hidden places,\n\n86\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.710\nthose places that are very sensitive\nthat can crash your systems.\n\n87\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.130\nInstead it actually says, look, there's\ntwo things that have to happen now.\n\n88\n00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.970\nOne, if you do download something,\n\n89\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.690\nyou have to actually say explicitly yes,\nyou want it to run.\n\n90\n00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.360\nSo that way you can't say, I didn't\nknow it was happening in the background,\n\n91\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.600\nit's not doing this.\n\n92\n00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.000\nBut it's actually doing something else and\ndidn't realize it.\n\n93\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.420\nToday though, you can't even say that.\n\n94\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.760\nIf you are using UAC, and\nthat's the big if, right?\n\n95\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.110\nA lot of people turn that off.\n\n96\n00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.150\nNo, you shouldn't actually turn it off.\n\n97\n00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.710\nBut if you actually have turned it\noff then there is a possibility.\n\n98\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.180\nBut even then,\nthey've also protected it in this way.\n\n99\n00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.340\nSome of those unusual, malicious software\nthat comes through your browser that says\n\n100\n00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.480\nI want to hook in here, I want to actually\ninstall in this protected directory,\n\n101\n00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.730\nI want to do all that.\n\n102\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.690\nIt doesn't allow it to do it anymore,\nand that is because\n\n103\n00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.262\nInternet Explorer in protected mode\nsays look, here's what we're gonna do.\n\n104\n00:04:58.262 --> 00:05:02.340\nWe're gonna create a virtual looking\nstructure for that application.\n\n105\n00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.580\nSo it mimics what it thinks it's writing\nto, which is the exact same location and\n\n106\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.300\nit allows it to install in that\nkind of virtual environment.\n\n107\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.710\nYou might be wondering like,\nwhy in the world does that help?\n\n108\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.930\nBecause it's limited in what it can\naccess in that virtual environment,\n\n109\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.630\nit tries to hook into something\nreal in the operating system,\n\n110\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.360\nit's not going to be able to do it.\n\n111\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.450\nSo it is a very strong system that is one\nof the strongest features that we have in\n\n112\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.450\nInternet Explorer.\n\n113\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.910\n>> Yeah, it really does help curtail\nwhat IE has access to in the past,\n\n114\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.790\nsome of those browsers ran with whatever\ncredentials you were logged on with.\n\n115\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.940\nAnd if you were logged\non as the administrator,\n\n116\n00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.730\nIE was running as an administrator,\n\n117\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.630\nwhich meant anything you clicked on\ncould potentially run as an admin.\n\n118\n00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.530\nOr jump outside of IE and\ndeal directly with the operating system,\n\n119\n00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.480\nprotected mode stops all that and\nit limits the access that IE has.\n\n120\n00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.690\nAnd if anything tries to jump out of IE\nand run independently of that virtualized\n\n121\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.650\nenvironment, that UAC's gonna warn you,\nas long as you haven't turned that off.\n\n122\n00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.391\nTo give you a chance to go, wait, I didn't\nknow that this was gonna try to jump out,\n\n123\n00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:03.590\nright, give you that chance\nto decide yes or no.\n\n124\n00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.200\nMaybe you do want it to happen, but\nat least now it's not blindsiding me,\n\n125\n00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.650\nI know that it's working and\nI can say yes or\n\n126\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.470\nno whether I want to allow that to\ngo outside of Internet Explorer.\n\n127\n00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.540\n>> So what we want to do is we want to\ntake a look at where it's actually turned\n\n128\n00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.490\non and\nwhat we can do with it if we need to.\n\n129\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.690\nYou can disable it if you need to.\n\n130\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.670\nAnd there is a chance, there is\na possibility that you may be running line\n\n131\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.180\nof business apps that say look, no,\nI can't deal with this protected mode.\n\n132\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.540\nIt is a very real possibility, especially\nwith the older applications that aren't\n\n133\n00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.670\ndesigned to run and\nunderstand the way that works.\n\n134\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.590\nSo, let's show you what you can do here.\n\n135\n00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.060\nAll right, so we're gonna bring\nup our Internet options and\n\n136\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.580\nwe're gonna go through\ncontrol panel to do this.\n\n137\n00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.790\nSo I'm gonna click on start,\nselect control panel.\n\n138\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.050\nAnd inside of my control panels,\n\n139\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.430\nI went to large icon view and\nI'm gonna select the Internet options.\n\n140\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.800\nWhen I do so, you'll actually see\nall these options of properties and\n\n141\n00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.179\nwe're gonna select the security setting.\n\n142\n00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.390\nAnd once I select the security setting,\nyou can see inside the security for\n\n143\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.440\nthis zone and where it says,\n\n144\n00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.880\nEnable Protected Mode requires restarting,\nif you are gonna change this.\n\n145\n00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.840\nSo you can see where this zone is actually\nselected, and actually done by default for\n\n146\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.500\nall of the actual sites that\nwe go to on the Internet.\n\n147\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.460\nBut notice if I go to local intranet or\ntrusted, that\n\n148\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.400\nthose two are not actually checkmarked, so\nby default, those things are not there.\n\n149\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.880\nSo if you wanted to, you, of course,\ncould enable them for there but\n\n150\n00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.480\nyou probably don't want to.\n\n151\n00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.380\nSometimes what will end up happening,\nof course,\n\n152\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.280\nis that you will have to\nconnect to a partner's website.\n\n153\n00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.130\nAnd they might have\nan application that runs there,\n\n154\n00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.490\nwhich now the protected mode says, no,\nit's not actually designed to run there.\n\n155\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.918\nWell, what can you do instead?\n\n156\n00:07:41.918 --> 00:07:46.140\nWell you could try and disable that\nInternet zone protected mode, but when you\n\n157\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.920\ndo that, you actually now let yourself\nopen to everything on the Internet.\n\n158\n00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.791\nSo instead, what you would like to do,\nor what you should do,\n\n159\n00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.572\nis go over here to trusted sites and\nadd in your sites there.\n\n160\n00:07:55.572 --> 00:07:58.242\nNow we've all done that before and\nso that's nothing new.\n\n161\n00:07:58.242 --> 00:08:01.859\nBut that is something that you do want\nto consider especially if you do need to\n\n162\n00:08:01.859 --> 00:08:05.533\nkeep some sites Where is protected like\nthe internet zone and then of course,\n\n163\n00:08:05.533 --> 00:08:08.850\nyour sites with your partners and\nnot have to worry about it.\n\n164\n00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.890\n>> Yeah, you know the way Internet\nExplorer handles security divides that\n\n165\n00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.490\nthe end of those zones,\nthe internet intranet, trusted sites and\n\n166\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.770\nrestricted sites.\n\n167\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.750\nEverything does not classified\nas one of those other three.\n\n168\n00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.110\nDumped into the internet zone.\n\n169\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.630\nSo you don't wanna reduce security there.\n\n170\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.160\nBecause that's all the sites\nyou've never been to before.\n\n171\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.940\nThat's where they go.\n\n172\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.390\nAnd I dunno if I trust them or not.\n\n173\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.915\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n174\n00:08:28.915 --> 00:08:30.605\n>> So rather than weaken the security on\n\n175\n00:08:30.605 --> 00:08:32.030\nthe internet zone.\n\n176\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.330\nI'd rather take the time and\n\n177\n00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.390\nmove that site that I do trust from\nthe Internet zone to that trusted zone,\n\n178\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.300\ncuz there I can reduce security because\nthose are only sites that I've added.\n\n179\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.150\nI know them, and I trust them.\n\n180\n00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.830\nThat way, we're not reducing\nthe overall security on our browser.\n\n181\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.550\n>> And when you start doing this, and what\nwe're doing right now is per computer, and\n\n182\n00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.690\nthat's where the issue also comes in.\n\n183\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.240\nNotice that if a regular user logs\nin to the computer a lot of times,\n\n184\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.090\nthey'll simply be able to uncheck this.\n\n185\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:02.280\nEven though they have the option to add\nsomething into their trusted sites,\n\n186\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.120\nwe may find out that instead\nthey unchecked this, and\n\n187\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.560\nthat's where the problem also comes in,\nis that you don't know that it's happened.\n\n188\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.240\nThe good thing is, if I am supporting\nmultiple users, this is not the only\n\n189\n00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.970\nlocation that I can come and\nmake sure that setting isn't change.\n\n190\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.890\nWe can always go to the place that Mike\nloves the best which is group policy\n\n191\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.700\nsettings, right?\n\n192\n00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.370\n>> Absolutely, group policy is a way that\nI can do it on multiple computers, right?\n\n193\n00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.570\nSo instead of me.\n\n194\n00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.550\nTrying to touch every single\nmachine out there on my network.\n\n195\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.320\nI create a policy, I scope it to the OU\nthat contains those client computer\n\n196\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.700\naccounts, and I have that setting\napplied to all of them at once.\n\n197\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.630\nThat way, I'm good to go and\n\n198\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.730\nI don't have to wear out my shoes\nwalking around from machine to machine.\n\n199\n00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.110\n>> So, even though we normally would do\nthis inside of the active directory group\n\n200\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.320\npolicy editor.\n\n201\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.300\nWhat we wanna show you today is\njust those settings instead.\n\n202\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.340\nAnd what you'll actually see is that we're\ngonna just use the local group policy\n\n203\n00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.500\nsettings, so\nthat we can see where those are gonna be.\n\n204\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.350\nSo inside that group policy editor,\nI am now going to oops.\n\n205\n00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.180\nAnd if I can actually expand that out so\nwe can see it a little bit more.\n\n206\n00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.300\nUnder the computer configuration I'm gonna\nexpand out administrative templates and\n\n207\n00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.840\nthen expand out windows components.\n\n208\n00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.880\nInside of windows components,\n\n209\n00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.610\nyou will possibly see where it\nsays Internet Explorer, and\n\n210\n00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:18.470\nthat is gonna be a key for us to actually\nbe able to find that right there.\n\n211\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.312\nAnd once we are selected\ninside of Internet Explorer,\n\n212\n00:10:21.312 --> 00:10:24.600\nwe are now going to look for\nthe Internet control panel as well.\n\n213\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.540\nSo when you start taking\na look at this here, too.\n\n214\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.060\nYou will now also see that there is\nanother setting inside that says\n\n215\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.630\nsecurity page.\n\n216\n00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.930\nAnd so now this is where we get\nback to that same tab that we were\n\n217\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.870\nlooking at inside of security, right?\n\n218\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.400\nSo when we take a look notice that\nyou have Internet zone and Internet.\n\n219\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.060\nAnd even trusted as well as restricted\nsites, well, what we want to do is one,\n\n220\n00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.690\ntake a look at, say, internet zone,\nand then I'm gonna sort them in\n\n221\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.650\nalphabetical order, at least I think,\nto help us out here.\n\n222\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.310\nThere's actually one that says,\nturn on protected mode.\n\n223\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.760\nSo if we select that one, and that way,\neven though it's not configured,\n\n224\n00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.550\nthat means somebody can toggle it on and\noff I can also enable it, and this way I\n\n225\n00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.160\ncan make sure that it's on regardless of\nwhat the user actually chooses to do,\n\n226\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.420\nand that way they can't actually\ntake that and change it.\n\n227\n00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.510\nSo, the thing that we also wanted to point\nout is this, I realized something during\n\n228\n00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.310\nour show here is that my browser updated,\nand at least from my computer,\n\n229\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.760\nwhatever I did that Internet Explorer\noption just disappeared.\n\n230\n00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.620\nBut we did check, we do find it in\nother versions of Windows as well, so\n\n231\n00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.390\nit could just have been\na glitch on my computer.\n\n232\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.590\nBut if you don't see it,\ncheck out your browser version.\n\n233\n00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.270\nI'm running a fairly low end browser\nversion in this day and age.\n\n234\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.680\nWe are at Internet Explorer 11 right now.\n\n235\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.250\nAnd when I downgraded back to\nthe Internet Explorer 8 that it came on,\n\n236\n00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.790\nthat setting actually came back.\n\n237\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.790\nSo if you are running something newer\nthan that, just take a look and\n\n238\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.170\nsee if those settings are still there.\n\n239\n00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.370\nAnd if they still are,\nyou can control it in this way too.\n\n240\n00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.630\nSo that's one of the settings you can do.\n\n241\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.440\nAnd of course you can\nchange the other options.\n\n242\n00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.210\nBut this way, we prevent the user from\njust thinking this doesn't matter.\n\n243\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.375\nAnd even if somebody on\nthe phone says oh yeah,\n\n244\n00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:06.717\njust turn off the protected\nmode you'll be fine.\n\n245\n00:12:06.717 --> 00:12:10.166\nThat's probably not something we\nwant to encourage anybody to do.\n\n246\n00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:13.158\n>> And there's a lot more settings we can\ngo though in Internet Explorer, right?\n\n247\n00:12:13.158 --> 00:12:16.390\nBecause we got our advanced tab.\n\n248\n00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.110\nAnd there's a whole slew of things we can\nuse to control what Internet Explorer is\n\n249\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.010\nallowed to do and not allowed to do\nto help keep our machine secure.\n\n250\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.160\n>> That's pretty much the key here.\n\n251\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.470\nNow, even though when we start taking\na look at the Internet properties, I just\n\n252\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:34.500\nwent back into the Control Panel watch the\nInternet Options again or the properties.\n\n253\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.410\nNotice that we have all\nthese different tabs.\n\n254\n00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.250\nAnd inside of Internet Explorer,\n\n255\n00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.730\nthese do control pretty much everything\nthat Internet Explorer can do.\n\n256\n00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.260\nBut they are on separate tabs.\n\n257\n00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.511\nThey do have them kind of nicely grouped,\nbut\n\n258\n00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:50.080\nthere's sometimes what you want to\nactually be able to do, of course.\n\n259\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.410\nAll the settings that you can control in\nInternet Explorer are sent to you right\n\n260\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.920\nhere, categorized.\n\n261\n00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.440\nAs well as actually\nlisted in one location.\n\n262\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.220\nSo this gives us the ability to come here,\nand actually do all the settings that we\n\n263\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.960\nwant at one time to control\nour Internet Explorer options.\n\n264\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.400\nSo you might actually scroll,\nlet's say, down a little bit more.\n\n265\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.450\nAnd you'll notice that a lot times\nthe default settings are pretty much what\n\n266\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.550\nwe end up using the majority\nof the times here.\n\n267\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.570\nBut it's really this security\nsection when we start dealing with\n\n268\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.730\nthe issues that we have to think about,\nright.\n\n269\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.870\nSo allow active content from CDs\nto run on your computer or flies,\n\n270\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.490\nactive content from files,\nto run on your computer.\n\n271\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.730\nAnd down here towards the end you wanna\nmake sure that you at least have this\n\n272\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.630\nSSL version 3 NTLS also running too.\n\n273\n00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.520\nSo there are a lot of these options but\ninstead of you having to search and\n\n274\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.760\ngo figure out where it is,\nit's all in this one location.\n\n275\n00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.140\nNow directly underneath that,\n\n276\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.900\nthough, notice that we have this\nRestore Advanced Settings and also Reset.\n\n277\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.770\nIt says hey, resets the Internet Explorer\noptions to their defaults.\n\n278\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.880\nSo if you are having, let's say security\nissues and you're not sure what's causing\n\n279\n00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.870\nit, because you don't know if\nanybody's playing with it.\n\n280\n00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.960\nWell you can at least go into here, reset\nthem to the default, and go all right, now\n\n281\n00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.690\nI've got it to the default, and let's see\nif we're still having those same issues.\n\n282\n00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.930\nIf you don't anymore, well, then you\nrealize it's one of these settings in\n\n283\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.880\nhere, and now you have to trace down\nthat one particular setting as well.\n\n284\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.480\nSo you do have that\nability to do that too.\n\n285\n00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.457\nNow the only other one is this\nRestore advanced settings as well.\n\n286\n00:14:21.457 --> 00:14:24.900\nAnd the Restore advanced settings is neat,\nunless I got it backward here.\n\n287\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.760\nOne of them actually keeps\nof all your cookies and\n\n288\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.920\nyour cache settings and\nyour browser and stuff like history and\n\n289\n00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.020\nthe other one says, look, I'm gonna wipe\neverything clean and start back over.\n\n290\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.543\nAnd I believe this,\nthe Restore advanced settings is,\n\n291\n00:14:38.543 --> 00:14:41.128\nis the one that keeps everything unless I,\nyeah, okay.\n\n292\n00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:42.301\nI always get those-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n293\n00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:43.236\n>> Backwards.\n\n294\n00:14:43.236 --> 00:14:46.060\nJust like the newer versions,\nright, refresh and reset.\n\n295\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.228\nI mix them up in my mind.\n\n296\n00:14:47.228 --> 00:14:51.145\nSo just kinda realize that that is another\nnice little trouble shooting tool for you.\n\n297\n00:14:51.145 --> 00:14:54.255\nCuz there are so many settings,\nI know that if I were to pop two or\n\n298\n00:14:54.255 --> 00:14:56.760\nthree's of these settings off and\nI didn't write them down,\n\n299\n00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.390\nI wouldn't know which one I set\nthat would have caused an issue.\n\n300\n00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.680\nSo, just resetting everything and\n\n301\n00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.940\nthen one-by-one adding those\nsecurity things in that I need to.\n\n302\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.110\nI think that's a great trouble-shooting\nmethodology that you may also\n\n303\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.720\nend up following.\n\n304\n00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.810\nSo use the tools that\nare available to you.\n\n305\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.980\nThe group policy to help\nsomebody from by-passing\n\n306\n00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.280\nyour Internet Explorer settings.\n\n307\n00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.140\nUse this, so that you can see all those\nsettings are in place, in one place.\n\n308\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.310\nInstead of going, yeah,\nI need to go here, I need to go here.\n\n309\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.980\nOh, yeah, I gotta find that setting.\n\n310\n00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.410\nAnd so\nthere's a ton of options right here, and\n\n311\n00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.540\nthe majority of them, like I said\nif you go across all those tabs\n\n312\n00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.180\nthey're kinda conglomerated right here and\nthen a few extra settings as well.\n\n313\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.725\n>> Now, Ronnie, I know another big\nvulnerability that most browsers face is\n\n314\n00:15:35.725 --> 00:15:36.570\nadd-ons, right?\n\n315\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.540\nExtending that functionality\nof the browsers.\n\n316\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.800\nUsually, we like that,\nwe like that additional functionality.\n\n317\n00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.655\nBut there are some vulnerabilities that\ncan be associated with some of those\n\n318\n00:15:45.655 --> 00:15:48.246\nadd-ons as well, so it's good to\nbe able to control those, right?\n\n319\n00:15:48.246 --> 00:15:51.642\n>> It really is and when we start\ntalking about the idea of add-ons,\n\n320\n00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:54.359\nusually on the browsers\nthat we've had in the past,\n\n321\n00:15:54.359 --> 00:15:57.915\nthey would give us some limited\nfunctionality in what we need to do.\n\n322\n00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:01.809\nAs webpages started changing,\nthere actually needed to be more and\n\n323\n00:16:01.809 --> 00:16:05.310\nmore stuff that needed to be\nrunning inside of that browser.\n\n324\n00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.770\nWell, browsers could get incredibly\nbloated if they added in every single\n\n325\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:14.090\npossibility for every website\non the planet that they needed.\n\n326\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:18.950\nAdd ons really do help us to limit\nthe size of our browsers by simply saying,\n\n327\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.440\nhey, when you go to this website,\njust go ahead and install this component.\n\n328\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.490\nYou don't have to have it installed for\neverything, but\n\n329\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.470\ninstall this component\nwhen you do come here and\n\n330\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.780\ndo that and that way you don't have\nthis monolithic browser that has every,\n\n331\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:36.290\nsingle component and 99% of the time\nI'm never gonna go to these sites here.\n\n332\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.330\nSo these browsers really do enhance\nthe way that you browse the Internet.\n\n333\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.150\nNow the problem is, they can get bloated.\n\n334\n00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:46.000\nBecause they do tend to actually allow\nyou to continue to add these things in.\n\n335\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.330\nSo if you want to control them, you\nhave to be able to manage them as well.\n\n336\n00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.700\nAnd inside of the Internet Options\nyou can do the same thing, so\n\n337\n00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:57.540\njust inside of the control panel, I simply\nwent ahead and did a search for add ons,\n\n338\n00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.790\nand then when I did I could see under\nInternet Options, manage browser add ons,\n\n339\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.970\nand it's located underneath\nthe programs here.\n\n340\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.030\nNow you still have the same option\nif you open up the browser and\n\n341\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:13.170\ngo to the Internet Options, and\nthen of course when you do that you'll see\n\n342\n00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:17.650\nanother link there for manage browser\nadd on, or manage and add-ons here.\n\n343\n00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.960\nSo now if I select add-ons here,\nwhat we're looking for\n\n344\n00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.940\nare any of the additional\nadd-ons that we might have.\n\n345\n00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.600\nNow this is just a fresh install, and\n\n346\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.620\nthere is actually nothing really\ninstalled on here for us.\n\n347\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.110\nSo when we do something,\nwhat we're actually looking for\n\n348\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.850\nis do we have any that we want to\nrun without permission of course.\n\n349\n00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.240\nLet's see, this thing is not allowing\nme to expand it out so we can see out.\n\n350\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.330\nMight be because I don't actually\nhave anything sudden here and\n\n351\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:51.350\nthere's just a few that we actually\nseeing inside that little window.\n\n352\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:55.220\nThat these are the ones that running\nwithout permissions right here.\n\n353\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.720\nAnd so\nyou do see quite a few from Microsoft and\n\n354\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.320\nthat stands to reason since\nthis is their browser.\n\n355\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.600\nAnd they're looking at a bunch of\ndifferent things like schema cache and\n\n356\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.590\nwhatever that is, and\nsome of these different classes of things.\n\n357\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.780\nAnd they are, they are all about trying to\nmake sure that they run fairly easily for\n\n358\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.840\nwhat we need.\n\n359\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.510\nNow you can also, of course,\nfind out about more of them.\n\n360\n00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.030\nIf you want to find more.\n\n361\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.640\nYou have this ability to now go in, and\n\n362\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.890\nbe able to download more browser\nadd-ons to help make this sufficient.\n\n363\n00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.900\nOr you can go in there,\nand also disable them too.\n\n364\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.640\nSo you might be able to find that one, and\n\n365\n00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.040\nif you select one like the Windows Media\nPlayer, and you don't want it to run.\n\n366\n00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.900\nYou simply select disable.\n\n367\n00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.320\nAnd that way it's not gonna run\nif you go to the sites that have,\n\n368\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.890\nsomething that Windows Media Player\ncan also play in.\n\n369\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.900\nUsually the default ones that we\ndo add in are things like Flash,\n\n370\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.620\nWindows Media Player if we know that\nthere's going to be some kind of media\n\n371\n00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.870\nthat's playing in the background,\nwant to hear the sound.\n\n372\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.680\nBut a lot of times you may find out that\nif you do browse a lot of websites you may\n\n373\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.350\nget more add-ons than this.\n\n374\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.480\nAnd what you wanna do of course\nis eliminate those as being\n\n375\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.890\nissues inside of your browsing.\n\n376\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.020\nGo ahead and disable them if you're\nnot really using them is the key.\n\n377\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.860\n>> Now, Ronnie, let's say I've been using\nInternet Explorer for a little while.\n\n378\n00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.260\nI've got a few different\nadd-ons enabled so\n\n379\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.440\nthat I can browse to these certain pages\nand allow them to function properly.\n\n380\n00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.370\nBut I think one of them's causing\na problem, and I need to verify that and\n\n381\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.900\nsee if it's an add-on or not.\n\n382\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.660\nThere are some ways rather than\nunchecking each one individually,\n\n383\n00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.340\nthere are some ways to do that, right?\n\n384\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.740\n>> Yeah, there's a couple\nof options that you can do.\n\n385\n00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.240\nMy favorite one is instead,\n\n386\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.220\nis to run something in what\nwe call the in private mode.\n\n387\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.700\nThe in private mode really disables\nall these additional add-ons, and\n\n388\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.410\nthat way you kinda have a nice clean,\nvery basic browser.\n\n389\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.620\nBut, there is a mode that you can go to,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n390\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.420\nshow you where that one is too.\n\n391\n00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.060\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick on Start and All Programs, and\n\n392\n00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.560\nthen in here it's under accessories,\nI believe.\n\n393\n00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.930\nAnd let's see is it Internet?\n\n394\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.280\nIs it Accessories?\n\n395\n00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.400\nAccessories, system tools.\n\n396\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.960\nSee I always forget where\nexactly that's located.\n\n397\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.460\nUnder System Tools and\ninside of System Tools here, notice\n\n398\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.680\nthat I have this link right here where\nit says, Internet Explorer, No Add-Ons.\n\n399\n00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:10.160\nStart Internet Explorer without Active X\ncontrols or browser extensions.\n\n400\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.190\nAnd so\nthis is another important option for\n\n401\n00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.900\nus if we wanted to launch that and verify.\n\n402\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.310\nNow if my page comes in correctly, that\nwe have and it's saying hey there's no\n\n403\n00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.390\ncurrently running without any add-ons and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n404\n00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.390\nAnd now if we go to those sites and\nwe're no longer experiencing those issues,\n\n405\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.490\nthen we know that it's\nan add-on that caused this too.\n\n406\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.470\nNow sometimes though,\n\n407\n00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.150\nyou might be going well,\nI don't know if I'll ever remember that.\n\n408\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.540\nThere is a command line\noption that you can also run.\n\n409\n00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.238\nSo this ones a little bit\nmore where it's iexplorer.\n\n410\n00:20:41.238 --> 00:20:46.030\nI explorer, excuse me,\nif I can spell it correctly.\n\n411\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:51.950\nAnd then you do a -ext off\nunless I misspelled it.\n\n412\n00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:52.770\nI must have misspelled it.\n\n413\n00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.870\nIt must be I explorer.\n\n414\n00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:54.800\nSo, see.\n\n415\n00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.160\nI mis typed it.\n\n416\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:04.940\nI explorer dash ext, for\nextension, and then off.\n\n417\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.940\nAnd once you do that, notice it\nactually launches the very same thing.\n\n418\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.330\nSo you can remember that one,\nthat's really where the key also comes in.\n\n419\n00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.440\nCuz that's a lot faster than trying to\nsay, I know there's a way I can do it.\n\n420\n00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.830\nI always just, like I said,\nwhat I tend to do instead, is go and\n\n421\n00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:23.050\nfind the InPrivate browsing mode here, and\nusually it does kind of the same thing,\n\n422\n00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.330\nwhere when you do this, all the other\nthings are also turned off as well.\n\n423\n00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.760\nAnd that's just kind of\nthe lazy man's way to do it.\n\n424\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.180\nThe official way is using\nthis idea of the ones\n\n425\n00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.210\nthat actually don't have any of\nthe add-ons turned on as well.\n\n426\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.430\nAnd so when you do eliminate it that way,\nyou kind of know.\n\n427\n00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.750\nGo and launch your browser again and\nyou're having the same issue,\n\n428\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.650\nthat is when you go back in and\nturn off those extensions one at a time or\n\n429\n00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.180\nthe add-ons one at a time until you\nget to the one, okay, that's the one.\n\n430\n00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.990\nAnd then you can add them all back in and\nsee if it causes that again.\n\n431\n00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:55.470\nSo it is a little bit of monotonous\nthings that have to be done.\n\n432\n00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.900\nBut it's something that you have to do,\nespecially if it is causing an issue.\n\n433\n00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.590\n>> Very good, Ronnie.\n\n434\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.580\nA lot of good information.\n\n435\n00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.390\nInternet Explorer,\nwe use it to browse out to the Internet.\n\n436\n00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.660\nAnd it's a great doorway into\nour machines from the outside.\n\n437\n00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.340\nBad guys know that,\nlike to take advantage of it.\n\n438\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.780\nSo we've got to make sure we understand\nall the security settings in there.\n\n439\n00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.390\nSo that we can secure that browser,\nkeep our users, and\n\n440\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.378\nour network safe from the bad\nguys on the world wide web.\n\n441\n00:22:19.378 --> 00:22:22.540\nAll right,\nRonnie well any parting words for\n\n442\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.010\nour viewers then on\nInternet Explorer security?\n\n443\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.840\n>> Well the key right, is that you're not\ngonna use an old browser like what we're\n\n444\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.410\nusing here but the very fact is you may\nstill be using that type of browser.\n\n445\n00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.620\nIf you can you wanna update\nthe browser as much as possible,\n\n446\n00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:41.210\nbecause that is one of the, probably the\nmost used application on your desktop and\n\n447\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.560\nthat means it's most\nused it's perfectly fine.\n\n448\n00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.180\nIt also connects out to the Internet and\n\n449\n00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.630\nyou don't know what's actually\ncoming in through that browser.\n\n450\n00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.330\nSo using these modes,\nactually understanding how to control it\n\n451\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.030\nis part of something we as Enterprise\nadmins need to be able to do.\n\n452\n00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.450\n>> Very good.\nAll right, ladies and\n\n453\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.140\ngentleman that's gonna do it for\nthis one, we hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n454\n00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.450\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n455\n00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.315\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n456\n00:23:01.315 --> 00:23:02.714\n>> And we'll see you next

--> 00:00:14.970\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.530\nWith me today, is Ronnie Wong,\nhow you doing Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.970\n>> I'm doing fine,\nit's another great day to be right here,\n\n6\n00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.916\nas we continue on taking a look at,\nwell, supporting Windows 7.\n\n7\n00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:26.117\nRemember that this show is more about,\nwell, just trying to make sure that we\n\n8\n00:00:26.117 --> 00:00:28.160\nunderstand some of\nthe technicalities inside.\n\n9\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.270\nAnd making sure that we can support in\nthe enterprise rather than exam focus.\n\n10\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.480\nSo what we want to do, of course,\n\n11\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.000\nis cover it in the way that we\nthink that we actually just need.\n\n12\n00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.190\nTo understand some of the basics and\ntroubleshooting,\n\n13\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.630\nsome of the issues that we have on hand.\n\n14\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.500\nAnd today, we're specifically taking\na look at, well, malicious software.\n\n15\n00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.400\nAnd what do we do as technicians\nwhen we actually get started there?\n\n16\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.300\n>> Yeah, we've had several episodes where\nwe've covered different types of malicious\n\n17\n00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.000\nsoftware.\n\n18\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.900\nThe attack avenues and things like that.\n\n19\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.570\nIn this one, we're really gonna focus on,\n\n20\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.260\nhow do we determine that we have\nmalicious software running on our system?\n\n21\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.450\nAnd what do we do about it?\n\n22\n00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.920\nHow do we either prevent it from\ngetting there in the first place,\n\n23\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.080\nor get rid of it?\n\n24\n00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.950\nNot necessarily cleaning up after viruses,\nbut, you know, let's analyse the system.\n\n25\n00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.640\nSee what the heck is going on.\n\n26\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.290\n>> Yeah, so when we start talking\nabout the idea of making sure here.\n\n27\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.710\nWhat we want to do is take a look,\n\n28\n00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.010\nmaybe at some of the tools\nthat are available for us.\n\n29\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.770\nSo that when something\ndoes get on our system,\n\n30\n00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.840\nhow can we determine that it's\nhappening and what we have available.\n\n31\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.310\nAnd that's actually key.\n\n32\n00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.442\nCuz it's very difficult for\n\n33\n00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:24.660\nan end user to determine whether or not\nsomething has gotten onto their systems.\n\n34\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.875\nAnd then it's very difficult\nthat also means for\n\n35\n00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.140\ntechnicians to determine that as well.\n\n36\n00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.210\nSo, some of the same things that we\nwould do in trying to get rid of it\n\n37\n00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.160\nmay also be of course the things that\nwe use to help determine that too.\n\n38\n00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.203\nSo, one of the first places that we would\nlike to end up looking at a lot of times.\n\n39\n00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:44.730\nIs gonna be under analyzing what services\nare generally running at that point.\n\n40\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.040\nWhen we start something like that,\nwe're actually trying to determine,\n\n41\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.720\nis something going on in our\nsystems right then or not?\n\n42\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.830\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n43\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.420\ntake a look at the services that\nwe are taking a look at here.\n\n44\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.060\nSo we want to be familiar, of course,\n\n45\n00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.230\nwith what we can do inside of\nservices when they are also running.\n\n46\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.280\nSo here is the services console.\n\n47\n00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.400\nAnd a lot of times, remember that all\nof these services that are running,\n\n48\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.450\nyou might see where their startup\ntypes are manual or automatic.\n\n49\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.770\nAnd it's really the automatic ones a lot\nof times that we are also worried about,\n\n50\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.660\nbecause that means they start,\nwell, when your computer starts up.\n\n51\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.080\nAnd that is normally where we tend to find\nthings like malicious software running\n\n52\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.070\nbecause they do not want actually\nwait until you click on something.\n\n53\n00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.540\nThey want to be running when\nyour computer is running.\n\n54\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.014\nSo this is what you have to be aware of\nis right here, is when you start taking\n\n55\n00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:34.172\na look at all this stuff that is\nactually running in the background.\n\n56\n00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:38.204\nYou may actually end up seeing that\nsomething does point you to come here and\n\n57\n00:02:38.204 --> 00:02:40.060\nsee what else is running.\n\n58\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.520\nNow a lot of times, of course, you want\nto also take a look at who's running it.\n\n59\n00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.040\nAnd so log on and\nlocal system and all this stuff.\n\n60\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.957\nAnd if you do find something over\nhere that you are not familiar with,\n\n61\n00:02:50.957 --> 00:02:54.552\nthat you're actually taking a look and go,\nwait a minute I didn't see that before.\n\n62\n00:02:54.552 --> 00:02:57.444\nWell, that might be something that\nyou want to double click on, and\n\n63\n00:02:57.444 --> 00:03:00.716\nat that point take a look at where it's\nrunning what what is happening here.\n\n64\n00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:04.438\nAnd that way you can go ahead and\ndisable that service if you need to,\n\n65\n00:03:04.438 --> 00:03:09.580\nand start that process of trying to figure\nout what is happening on the system.\n\n66\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.775\n>> Absolutely, you know, we're not gonna\nrecognize every service maybe in there,\n\n67\n00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:17.715\nbut a lot of times one will stand out,\nand it doesn't look quite right.\n\n68\n00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:19.365\nSo this is a good place to start, and\n\n69\n00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.405\nat least I can take a look at the service,\nand see where it's located.\n\n70\n00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:25.225\nMost of them are not gonna\nbe in that System32 folder,\n\n71\n00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:27.295\nwhere stuff is supposed to be.\n\n72\n00:03:27.295 --> 00:03:31.030\nIt'll be running from your My Documents or\nsome other temp location, and\n\n73\n00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.536\nthat's a really good indicator that hey,\nsomething is wrong here.\n\n74\n00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:38.904\nWhy do I have this service that's\nstarting up automatically, yet\n\n75\n00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:41.180\nit's located in my IE temp files?\n\n76\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.440\nSomething might not be right.\n\n77\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.450\n>> Right and those are kind of keys right?\n\n78\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.420\nAnd that means that we have to be fairly\nvigilant when somebody does complain\n\n79\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.620\nto come in here and examine the things\nthat you know that should be there.\n\n80\n00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.930\nEspecially if they say, hey, well,\nI've installed a piece of software now and\n\n81\n00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.670\nnow I can't get it to\ndo what I need to do.\n\n82\n00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.990\nFigure out if it's currently running,\nand then go ahead and shut it down, and\n\n83\n00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.660\nthat way see if it actually turns back on.\n\n84\n00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.310\nAnd from that point, it means we have\nto do more and more searching and\n\n85\n00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.830\ndiscovery to figure out\nwhat's happening here.\n\n86\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.180\nBut these are essential tools for us,\nremember that what we can do here right,\n\n87\n00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.280\nis we can just disable it, or\nit can even lead us to that file location.\n\n88\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.670\n>> And that might be something else that\nafter you actually try to uninstall it,\n\n89\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.160\nwell, it gives you that\npath to that executable.\n\n90\n00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.320\nAnd that way you can go ahead and\n\n91\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.790\nalso remove that program at\nthe same time if you need to.\n\n92\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.740\nSo, you also end up finding dependencies\nif it actually is dependent\n\n93\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.050\non anything else.\n\n94\n00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.230\nAnd that way you can actually track what\nelse, you know, you need to actually\n\n95\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.170\ntake a look at, see if that also\nis causing another issue, too.\n\n96\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.682\nSo, fairly simple but something that\nwe might overlook if we just think, oh,\n\n97\n00:04:40.682 --> 00:04:42.880\njust run anti-virus and\ndon't worry about it.\n\n98\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.210\nBecause these things can be very tricky.\n\n99\n00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.410\nSo at least start off with those basics\nof taking a look at something like\n\n100\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.820\nthe services right away.\n\n101\n00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.390\n>> And then Ronnie,\nprograms are another thing.\n\n102\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.680\nThey can be launched up\nwhen my system starts.\n\n103\n00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.515\nAnd some of those programs I might not\nwant to be launching up every time my\n\n104\n00:04:57.515 --> 00:05:00.740\nsystem starts, but Windows gives\nus a way to control those as well.\n\n105\n00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.760\n>> It really does.\n\n106\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.588\nThe way that we control things that happen\nat start up are a couple of options, but\n\n107\n00:05:06.588 --> 00:05:09.925\nthe first one is one that has\nbeen around for a long time,\n\n108\n00:05:09.925 --> 00:05:11.700\nwhich is to use the msconfig.\n\n109\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.916\nAnd if I go out and\nclick on Start, and then msconfig,\n\n110\n00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:19.940\nyou should see a little\nprogram link pops up.\n\n111\n00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.470\nAnd it is under System Configuration\nthat we are taking a look at here.\n\n112\n00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.830\nWhat we are looking for is underneath\nthe Startup tab the majority of the times.\n\n113\n00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.990\nYou should not find anything running\nhere that you don't recognize.\n\n114\n00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:39.240\nSo if all of a sudden it says\ngumwrapper.exe, super bunny click,\n\n115\n00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.980\nwhatever it might be, and you go,\nI don't remember installing that.\n\n116\n00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.300\nWell, that's a good indication,\n\n117\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.970\nif you don't remember it being installed,\nsomebody else installed it.\n\n118\n00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.671\nSo that means that what we can do here\nis go, all right, this thing is running.\n\n119\n00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:55.166\nNow don't go ahead and just go right,\nthat's all the that I need.\n\n120\n00:05:55.166 --> 00:06:00.125\nWhat we also need to do is take a look\nover here at this link where it says\n\n121\n00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:01.880\nLocation too.\n\n122\n00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.020\nThe reason why is that this location,\nMike, looks a little bit different.\n\n123\n00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.835\nI don't see a C: in front of it\neven though it says Commands but\n\n124\n00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:09.581\nthat's actually to something else.\n\n125\n00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:15.550\nRight here under Location, I see\nsomething else that says HKLM instead.\n\n126\n00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.020\nAnd that might indicate hey,\nthis thing is actually running, but\n\n127\n00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.570\nit also has some hooks inside\nof our registry, right.\n\n128\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.560\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n129\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.790\nThat command tells you where it's located,\nbut\n\n130\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.920\nthat registry key is what's\ntelling your computer.\n\n131\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.300\nIt start this up every\ntime that system starts.\n\n132\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.570\nSo if you find things there,\nagain, like Ronnie said,\n\n133\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.310\nthese should be known things that are\nloading up every time my system starts.\n\n134\n00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.580\nIf I see anything questionable in there,\nI need to do a little more research and\n\n135\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.180\nfigure it out.\n\n136\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.000\nNow I've gone through there and\nsaid, I don't recognize this.\n\n137\n00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.820\nCome to find out, it's an auto\nupdate thing for Logitech, you know,\n\n138\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.690\nfor my mouse or something like that.\n\n139\n00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.551\nSo it's not saying that\nit's always a bad thing.\n\n140\n00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:57.179\nBut if you don't recognize it, do your\nresearch try to figure out what it is and\n\n141\n00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:01.140\nif it really needs to start\nevery time the system starts.\n\n142\n00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.079\n>> And when it actually is started there,\nright?\n\n143\n00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:05.747\nYou want to actually determine\nis it actually starting up and\n\n144\n00:07:05.747 --> 00:07:07.015\nrunning in the background?\n\n145\n00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:10.815\nWe again can go into Services and find\nsome of that, but normally when talking\n\n146\n00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:14.970\nabout programs, we're going to go to\nour old trusty Task Manager instead.\n\n147\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.730\nThat way we can find what\nthat process ID is too.\n\n148\n00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.460\nIf we do see something like that in there,\nwe might want to ahead and\n\n149\n00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.360\ndisable it from starting, but\nthen we need to start the Task Manager.\n\n150\n00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.420\nAnd from here we can take a look at\nthese applications and processes.\n\n151\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.994\nIt may show up underneath the application\nas being whatever third party application\n\n152\n00:07:33.994 --> 00:07:34.557\nis running.\n\n153\n00:07:34.557 --> 00:07:37.991\nBut if it doesn't, what we're looking for\nis gonna be under here, and\n\n154\n00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:41.020\nwe're also trying to check\nout who is running it.\n\n155\n00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.379\nHopefully, it will be running underneath\nus, and not underneath, like, System,\n\n156\n00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:46.070\nis what we're hoping that it doesn't do.\n\n157\n00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.430\nSo, there's blank, and stuff like that,\nthen we're a little bit more worried.\n\n158\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.350\nWhen I'm running it, I know that that\nmeans something that can actually happen\n\n159\n00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.510\nwith me, it's only gonna affect me.\n\n160\n00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.333\nNormally, though, when it's actually\nrunning underneath the system,\n\n161\n00:07:57.333 --> 00:07:59.122\nlike this one here, and\nit's blank like this,\n\n162\n00:07:59.122 --> 00:08:01.744\nthen you might have something else\ngoing on that's also happening.\n\n163\n00:08:01.744 --> 00:08:04.824\nSo you do have to take a look\nat more of this, too, and\n\n164\n00:08:04.824 --> 00:08:09.660\nthen of course you can go underneath The,\nlet's see, what else, services.\n\n165\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.687\nThat's where I was going.\n\n166\n00:08:10.687 --> 00:08:12.959\nServices, once again,\ntie down to that, and\n\n167\n00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:16.165\nthen to that process ID number that\nshows you that application and\n\n168\n00:08:16.165 --> 00:08:19.600\nthe other services that\nare running in the background too.\n\n169\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.100\nAnd if you do have something in start up\nthat's running, well, do the same thing\n\n170\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.090\nthat we would normally do, which is take\nany of these things, I'm trying to figure\n\n171\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.850\nout which one I want to do, so\nlet's say, like, this Windows Update.\n\n172\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.390\nThis is probably not the greatest one.\n\n173\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.770\nI can go ahead and\nend the process itself, and when I do so,\n\n174\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.590\nthat will stop that process, and\nhopefully, it will disappear and\n\n175\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.660\nnot come back immediately,\nis what we're hoping for.\n\n176\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.290\nIf it comes back immediately,\nsomething else is going on.\n\n177\n00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.180\n>> Yeah, if it comes back,\nanother thing you've gotta check is,\n\n178\n00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.320\nis it gonna come back when\nthe system starts up again, right?\n\n179\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.010\nCuz if it's got that key in the registry,\nor\n\n180\n00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.870\nthat run once or run, it's just gonna\ncome right back when the system reboots.\n\n181\n00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.670\nSo we again need to do\na little more research.\n\n182\n00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.890\nNow Ronnie, I know in, well go ahead.\n\n183\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.770\n>> No I was just saying, here it is.\n\n184\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.150\nThe Windows Update actually did come\nback on and that was on purpose here,\n\n185\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.060\nbecause we really do have it set for\nautomatically checking.\n\n186\n00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.060\nSo this is something,\nyes this should be normal.\n\n187\n00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.470\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n188\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.290\nBut, if it is a program that you really\nsit there and go, wait a minute.\n\n189\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.410\nI don't know what that program is.\n\n190\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.600\nWhy does it keep starting\nafter I've turned it off?\n\n191\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.850\nBecause it's running under me,\nI should be able to control it.\n\n192\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.060\nWell then, you know that\nsomething else is happening and\n\n193\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.320\nthat's something we wanna\nactually inspect then.\n\n194\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.900\n>> And, Ronnie, in a previous episode.\n\n195\n00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.540\nWe had talked about IE,\nInternet Explorer, add-ons.\n\n196\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.140\nAnd how those can be,\nsometimes can be a vulnerability.\n\n197\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.680\nWe've gotta make sure\nwe're managing those,\n\n198\n00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.540\nchoosing which ones are allowed to run.\n\n199\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.810\nHow do we figure out\nwhich ones are running?\n\n200\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.640\n>> When you start taking a look there, you\nwanna go ahead at that point and actually\n\n201\n00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.950\ntake a look at the browser settings and\nbe able to actually turn those things off.\n\n202\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.480\nNow you have a couple of options\nthat you can do this to find out.\n\n203\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.012\nOne is to get into\nthe internet options here.\n\n204\n00:09:52.012 --> 00:09:55.830\nSo if I select Internet Explorer and\ngive it a moment and\n\n205\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.070\nthen I go to the internet option.\n\n206\n00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.250\nActually I don't need to go there.\n\n207\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.680\nI just missed it didn't I?\n\n208\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.460\nI have manage.\n\n209\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.650\nSee I have already turned\non like six things here.\n\n210\n00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.630\nAnd it's right here that we are taking\na look at seeing what else is added on.\n\n211\n00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.890\nSo extensions and toolbars, these\nare the additional add ons that we have.\n\n212\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.580\nAnd so if I take a look at\nall the add ons instead,\n\n213\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.900\nwe can see here is Windows Media Player.\n\n214\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.350\nAnd if you do see that when it's\nactually not disabled, it is active.\n\n215\n00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.060\nAnd that means it is ready to go and\nthis one's an Active X type of control.\n\n216\n00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.800\nFor all of the different things that are\nactually moving on the page that we need.\n\n217\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.320\nSearch providers, accelerators of course.\n\n218\n00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.590\nThese are what we are actually\ntaking a look at.\n\n219\n00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.280\nIf we actually do see a name up\nthere that we don't recognize,\n\n220\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.950\nwhat we want to do is simply disable\nthat for right then [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n221\n00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.020\nthat way we can actually tell if something\nis going on with that one add on.\n\n222\n00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.770\nAnd so this is kind of a little bit\nmore of taking a look and saying,\n\n223\n00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.680\nlook add ons come with the browser.\n\n224\n00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.830\nNormally when I go to a web page and\nthey add something in there so\n\n225\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.380\nthat web page can function\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n226\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.110\nSo if I've already selected yes and\nit's running here and\n\n227\n00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.010\nit still gives me a strange name.\n\n228\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.150\nI may go ahead and say,\nlook even though I want it to run,\n\n229\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.570\nI don't want it to run all the time.\n\n230\n00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.100\nI may go ahead and disable it,\nand then if I don't want it,\n\n231\n00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.910\nI can even delete it at that point too and\nthat way I don't have to worry about it.\n\n232\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.780\nSo being able to control\nstuff like this is part of\n\n233\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.010\nthe way that we actually\nhave to manage this.\n\n234\n00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.890\nEspecially in a bigger environment.\n\n235\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.780\nAnd so it may not just be learning\nwhat these things are but\n\n236\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.650\nalso going into things like your\ngroup policy and saying look\n\n237\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.550\nwe don't want that stuff being added\nin and controlling it from there too.\n\n238\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.140\n>> Yeah add ons can be\na security vulnerability and\n\n239\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.810\nat the least they can be\na performance hindrance right?\n\n240\n00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.740\nBecause it's really easy for users to\nget a bunch of these add ons installed.\n\n241\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.340\nBecause they'll download things from\nthe Internet, and they'll install them,\n\n242\n00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.820\nand they don't pay attention, right?\n\n243\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.420\nThey do the Jiminy Click-it,\nnext, next, next, next, install.\n\n244\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.350\nAnd somewhere in there was like,\nwould you like to add the Bing toolbar?\n\n245\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.450\nWould you like to add the Ask Jeeves\ntool bar and things like that.\n\n246\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.410\nAll of the sudden they open up their\nbrowser and they've got tool bars\n\n247\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.480\nthat take up a quarter of the screen and\nthey wonder why their browsing is so slow.\n\n248\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.480\nYou know, this is how we can go in and\nmanage those, remove them, disable them.\n\n249\n00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.290\nWhatever we need to do.\n\n250\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.740\nAnd then, of course, we've got antivirus.\n\n251\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.350\nI mean, that's obviously something we've\ntalked about in several different shows.\n\n252\n00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.470\nVery important for\nus to run to keep us safe.\n\n253\n00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.360\n>> We definitely need to make sure that,\nof course, just like anything else.\n\n254\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.880\nRight?\nThat we have updated\n\n255\n00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.650\nantivirus running too.\n\n256\n00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.680\nSo if you take a look at some of the\ndifferent things that we're talking about,\n\n257\n00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.990\nas far as troubleshooting goes,\n\n258\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.630\nif we do believe that some malicious\nsoftware has gotten onto the computer,\n\n259\n00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:36.110\nwe wanna see what it's actually\nattached to and running.\n\n260\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.550\nSo that's where the services come in.\n\n261\n00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.680\nThat's where we go into Task Manager and\nMS Config and\n\n262\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.220\nsee what's actually,\nwhere it's got hooked into.\n\n263\n00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.620\nWe can also then go into our registry\nif we need to remove those hooks\n\n264\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.050\nby deleting that location as well.\n\n265\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.020\nBut then we may also wanna\ntake a look at this antivirus.\n\n266\n00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.950\nSo not only do we need it always running,\nbut at that point we may wanna update it,\n\n267\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.510\nmake sure we get the latest updates.\n\n268\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.840\nAnd also at that point, go ahead and\nrun the scans that we need to.\n\n269\n00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.380\nNow, depending on your solution,\nright, in a home environment,\n\n270\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.010\nyou're probably gonna run whatever\nyou want to, which is normally fine.\n\n271\n00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.960\nBut the thing is, remember that some of\nthe things that are actually on there by\n\n272\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.460\ndefault, like Windows Defender, it can\ninterfere if you're in the corporate\n\n273\n00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.780\nenvironment and you're running your\nown anti-malware solution as well.\n\n274\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.600\nAnd if you are running something\nlike that you need to make sure\n\n275\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.310\nthat they're running concurrently because\nthey can interfere with each other.\n\n276\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.450\nSo one of things you can do is if\nyou are in a corporate situation and\n\n277\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.690\nyou have provided your own third\nparty anti-virus solution, Is so\n\n278\n00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.460\nit doesn't interfere is to go ahead and\nturn off, or\n\n279\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.340\ndisable, Windows Defender anti-virus or\nanti-malware from going on as well.\n\n280\n00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.820\nSo that's one of the settings that we\ncan actually at least show you here.\n\n281\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.925\nSo let's go ahead and do that too.\n\n282\n00:13:47.925 --> 00:13:49.025\nSo when we take a look,\n\n283\n00:13:49.025 --> 00:13:51.655\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ntake a look at our group policy.\n\n284\n00:13:51.655 --> 00:13:53.755\nAnd remember that you can do\nthis not only, of course,\n\n285\n00:13:53.755 --> 00:13:57.665\nlocally, but you can do it on your\nActive Directory group policy as well.\n\n286\n00:13:57.665 --> 00:14:04.125\nBut just using our local group policy,\ngpedit.msc.\n\n287\n00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:06.920\nOh, so\nit might have another error come up here.\n\n288\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.390\nWe'll actually see if it actually happens.\n\n289\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.560\nHopefully not.\n\n290\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.360\nSo what I'm gonna do is expand\nthis setting out over here.\n\n291\n00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.680\nAnd then we're going to,\nunderneath computer configuration,\n\n292\n00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.170\nwe're going to select, let's see,\nit's going to be Windows settings.\n\n293\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.994\nAnd from here I am lying to you, it's\n\n294\n00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:33.630\nactually going to be under Administrative\ntemplates and then Windows components.\n\n295\n00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.510\nSee I can't read my own notes here,\nand then under Windows components,\n\n296\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.990\nwe're looking for Windows Defender,\nis what we're looking for so\n\n297\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.450\nat least that setting's there and notice\nthat you have these options and these\n\n298\n00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.880\nare all different options, especially\nif you're running Suss and everything.\n\n299\n00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.230\nBut notice this Turn Off Defender.\n\n300\n00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.110\nIf you are running your own third-party\nantivirus solution, this is something you\n\n301\n00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.720\nmay have to go in there and now enable\nit to make sure it's turned off, so\n\n302\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.520\nit's not doing the live\nscanning at the same time.\n\n303\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.070\nEven if your computer is updating and\nactually sending updates to\n\n304\n00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.560\nWindows Defender perfectly fine, but what\nyou don't wanna do is actually run this\n\n305\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.100\nlive time scan at the same time you're\nusing some managed antivirus scan as well.\n\n306\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.120\nSo this is one of the settings that you\nmay want to make sure that you are able to\n\n307\n00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.610\ntake a look in doing.\n\n308\n00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.440\nAlso, of course,\nthen the real-time monitoring\n\n309\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.390\nis something else that you may\nalso want to consider as well.\n\n310\n00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.140\nIf you don't wanna actually doing\nthat scan at the same time,\n\n311\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.160\nthat is something else that someone in\nthe enterprise may want to turn off, so\n\n312\n00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.600\nit doesn't interfere,\nagain, with another scan.\n\n313\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.335\nYeah, you know, anti-virus is good,\ntwo anti-virus not so good.\n\n314\n00:15:34.335 --> 00:15:35.895\n[LAUGH] Because they do,\nthey fight each other.\n\n315\n00:15:35.895 --> 00:15:38.240\nAnti-virus is typically a resource hog,\nand\n\n316\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.360\nwe're always looking for one that\ndoesn't consume a lot of resources.\n\n317\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.760\nWhen it's scanning files, and\n\n318\n00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.370\ndoing those deep type of scans, they\ncan really suck up a lot of resources.\n\n319\n00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:51.241\nAnd if two of them are trying to do it\nat the same time, it either locks your\n\n320\n00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:55.620\nmachine up completely because there's no\nresources available, Or they see each\n\n321\n00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:00.261\nother's behavior as potential malicious\nbehavior, and they try to kill each other.\n\n322\n00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:03.632\nNot kill each other, they try to turn\neach other off, or tell you hey,\n\n323\n00:16:03.632 --> 00:16:07.704\nlook out, Windows Defender is doing some\nbad things here, and you say, no, wait.\n\n324\n00:16:07.704 --> 00:16:12.064\nSymantec is doing some really bad things\nhere so, never good to run more than one\n\n325\n00:16:12.064 --> 00:16:16.510\ndefender enabled by default unless you\ninstall some other antivirus software.\n\n326\n00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:20.725\nSo, pick one, use Windows Defender or\ndisable it and\n\n327\n00:16:20.725 --> 00:16:23.460\nuse your antivirus of choice.\n\n328\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.855\nAnd then, Ronnie, I know you're gonna show\nus, too, in the registry we talked about,\n\n329\n00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:28.277\nwe'll back about just a sec I guess.\n\n330\n00:16:28.277 --> 00:16:31.985\nCuz I know you're gonna show us, there's\nthat place where things, this is a really\n\n331\n00:16:31.985 --> 00:16:35.290\ngood place to go and look to see what's\nrunning when your system starts up.\n\n332\n00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.523\nIt's one of the most common places\nthat these malware will try to get in.\n\n333\n00:16:39.523 --> 00:16:42.332\nBecause what it can do is it can hide\nitself here in this registry key\n\n334\n00:16:42.332 --> 00:16:44.620\nthat Ronnie's getting ready to show you.\n\n335\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.810\nAnd then, even if you find the source\nof the infection and remove it, or\n\n336\n00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.260\nthe infected files and remove them,\nas soon as you restart that machine,\n\n337\n00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.630\nit reads that registry again and\nit comes right back.\n\n338\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.320\nSo, a good place to go and look.\n\n339\n00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.021\n>> Yeah, let's go ahead and take a look\nat what we're talking about here so\n\n340\n00:16:59.021 --> 00:16:59.744\nthat way you know.\n\n341\n00:16:59.744 --> 00:17:02.530\nSo, remember that once you\ndisable everything, right?\n\n342\n00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.570\nWhat we wanna do is find\nout where it started.\n\n343\n00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.955\nAnd this is where that MS\nconfigure really helps us out.\n\n344\n00:17:06.955 --> 00:17:10.318\nIt points out in the location where\nnormally everything is running when\n\n345\n00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:14.250\nthe computer first starts up, and\nthat's where we also want to remove it.\n\n346\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.780\nSimply unchecking it disables it,\n\n347\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.640\nbut then when we restart it again,\nyou never know if it comes back.\n\n348\n00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.315\nThis is the way to ensure that\nit's not gonna come back.\n\n349\n00:17:21.315 --> 00:17:23.454\nSo, there's two locations\nthat we're gonna look at.\n\n350\n00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:25.041\nThe first one is under local machine.\n\n351\n00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:28.985\nIf I go ahead and\nexpand out HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and\n\n352\n00:17:28.985 --> 00:17:35.345\nthen SOFTWARE and underneath SOFTWARE,\nwe're going to go down to Microsoft.\n\n353\n00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:40.623\nAnd then in Microsoft,\nscroll all the way down to Windows.\n\n354\n00:17:40.623 --> 00:17:45.134\nAnd under Windows, CurrentVersion, I know\nyou can't actually believe that this has\n\n355\n00:17:45.134 --> 00:17:47.640\ngone on as long as it is, and then Run.\n\n356\n00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.990\nSo this is where your machine\nautomatically says look, here's a software\n\n357\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:55.990\nthat's running and what you'd want to do\nis go ahead and remove this right here.\n\n358\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.203\nYou'd right click and then delete it.\n\n359\n00:17:57.203 --> 00:18:02.390\nNow, before you do that, you want\nthis path that you see under data.\n\n360\n00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.780\nThis path that you see under data will\nnow allow you to manually go in there and\n\n361\n00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.390\nalso remove those files if\nuninstalling it doesn't work.\n\n362\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.630\nAnd that is also another key.\n\n363\n00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:17.629\nSo if you wanna make sure it's actually\ncompletely gone, don't just remove this.\n\n364\n00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:20.599\nBut also remove the file\nitself from starting.\n\n365\n00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:21.854\nIf it's malicious software,\n\n366\n00:18:21.854 --> 00:18:24.180\nthis is some of the stuff that\nends up happening, right?\n\n367\n00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.730\nYou remove the key but\nthe software's still there.\n\n368\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.954\nSo next time it starts up, it runs and\n\n369\n00:18:28.954 --> 00:18:30.630\nsays, oh, I'm just going to\ngenerate a new registry key.\n\n370\n00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.520\nLet me go ahead and do that.\n\n371\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.500\nAnd actually puts it back in.\n\n372\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.250\nSo it's key that once you do\nthat you also do this as well.\n\n373\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.320\nNow, when we do that, and\nthat's perfectly fine, but\n\n374\n00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.340\nthe other location is under who\nis currently logged on as well.\n\n375\n00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.700\nSo, not only do we actually have\nit under the local machine key,\n\n376\n00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.530\nwe can also go up to current user and\ndo the same thing.\n\n377\n00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.100\nAnd it's probably in about the same place.\n\n378\n00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.744\nSOFTWARE, Microsoft, then Windows,\n\n379\n00:18:59.744 --> 00:19:04.220\nand under CurrentVersion, Run.\n\n380\n00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.100\nYou would also remove it right\nhere if it also shows up.\n\n381\n00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.780\nSo you want to make sure that\nyou clear out both locations and\n\n382\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.130\nwhen you do so, that should prevent\nit from running because that\n\n383\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.180\nfile should no longer be there even\nwhen the registry calls on it.\n\n384\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.780\nBut since it's now missing\nfrom the registry as well,\n\n385\n00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.380\nthat should actually give us a nice,\nclear start, and we had to do it.\n\n386\n00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.600\nBut checking these locations is essential,\nespecially if you do think that some type\n\n387\n00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.062\nof malicious software did\nget on your computer and\n\n388\n00:19:29.062 --> 00:19:30.839\nyou're not sure what it's doing.\n\n389\n00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:36.600\n>> And then of course Windows has our\nfavorite user account control, or UAC.\n\n390\n00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.540\nAnother method that our machine, trying to\nkeep us safe from ourselves sometimes, but\n\n391\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.430\ntrying to keep us safe.\n\n392\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.010\nLet us know when things are trying\nto run in the background\n\n393\n00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.200\nthat we might not have wanted.\n\n394\n00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.241\n>> Now this is something that\nwe're probably used to by now, but\n\n395\n00:19:50.241 --> 00:19:52.754\nwhen it first came out in\nthe days of Vista, right,\n\n396\n00:19:52.754 --> 00:19:56.807\nthe previous operating system to this one,\neverybody and their mother hated it.\n\n397\n00:19:56.807 --> 00:19:58.950\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\n398\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:03.970\nThis particular system, for us, is really\nprobably the biggest protection that\n\n399\n00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.270\nactually has turned out to be the biggest\nbenefit for Windows since Vista.\n\n400\n00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:13.154\nAnd the reason why is that it no longer\nallows in somebody to just stay logged in\n\n401\n00:20:13.154 --> 00:20:14.732\nas the administrator and\n\n402\n00:20:14.732 --> 00:20:19.859\nallow everything that comes in under their\nname now to run as the administrator.\n\n403\n00:20:19.859 --> 00:20:23.558\nToday, the way that it ends up\nworking is kind of neat, and\n\n404\n00:20:23.558 --> 00:20:27.349\nit did fool us for a little bit\nof time until we got used to it.\n\n405\n00:20:27.349 --> 00:20:30.872\nFrom the days of XP, right,\nwhen you logged in as the administrator,\n\n406\n00:20:30.872 --> 00:20:32.200\nyour account was what?\n\n407\n00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.602\nWas the administrator, and that meant that\nif you went and browsed to a location, and\n\n408\n00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:39.490\nyou wanted to download files and\nrun, perfectly fine.\n\n409\n00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.530\nWindows XP said well,\nyou're the administrator and that's fine.\n\n410\n00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.733\nWell, beginning with Vista also\nenhanced inside of Windows 7, the UAC,\n\n411\n00:20:46.733 --> 00:20:49.883\nthe user account control,\nsaid we're changing that.\n\n412\n00:20:49.883 --> 00:20:54.760\nAnd the way that they changed it is\nreally a neat way of changing it.\n\n413\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.410\nSo when you install Windows,\nright, in Windows 7,\n\n414\n00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.070\nwhat normally happens is\nthe first user that's logged on,\n\n415\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.500\nhe is actually gonna be considered\nthe administrator for the machine.\n\n416\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.727\nBut he's not actually the administrator.\n\n417\n00:21:06.727 --> 00:21:08.080\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\n418\n00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.936\nHe's actually a standard user that has\nadministrative privileges by default\n\n419\n00:21:12.936 --> 00:21:13.899\nis what he has.\n\n420\n00:21:13.899 --> 00:21:17.499\nAnd so, that actually allows him then,\nthe first person that logs in,\n\n421\n00:21:17.499 --> 00:21:20.698\nhe's not the local\nadministrator to the machine.\n\n422\n00:21:20.698 --> 00:21:23.688\nHe's absolutely is just\nanother standard user, and so\n\n423\n00:21:23.688 --> 00:21:27.326\neven if viruses attack right away,\nit still raises the UAC prompt.\n\n424\n00:21:27.326 --> 00:21:30.700\nIt doesn't disable it, it doesn't\ndismiss it, it doesn't do any of that.\n\n425\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.710\nIt says you still have to answer yes or\nno.\n\n426\n00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.983\nSo it's really kind of a very neat system.\n\n427\n00:21:35.983 --> 00:21:40.026\nBecause it really protects the operating\nsystem files to the nth degree.\n\n428\n00:21:40.026 --> 00:21:44.552\nNothing really runs inside of\nWindows without you actually\n\n429\n00:21:44.552 --> 00:21:46.730\nsaying yes I want it to run.\n\n430\n00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.230\nPrograms are not gonna come\nin through your browser and\n\n431\n00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.700\ninstall without you saying\nyes it's going to install.\n\n432\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.850\nSo the UAC is one of the best\nfeatures that we have to protect us.\n\n433\n00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.272\nYou combine that together with features\nthat we've looked at before inside of\n\n434\n00:22:00.272 --> 00:22:02.955\nInternet Explorer such\nas the protected mode.\n\n435\n00:22:02.955 --> 00:22:06.085\nYou combine that with the way that\nwe're vigilant with anti-virus and\n\n436\n00:22:06.085 --> 00:22:08.290\nwith everything else that we're doing.\n\n437\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.010\nIt really does make a fairly\nprotected overall system.\n\n438\n00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.737\nAnd the only time it's not protected is\nwhen you say, I don't know what this is\n\n439\n00:22:15.737 --> 00:22:19.203\nbut I'm still gonna allow it to run and\nthen it actually allows it to run.\n\n440\n00:22:19.203 --> 00:22:22.889\nSo, it is a very neat system but it's\nsomething we need to take a look at and\n\n441\n00:22:22.889 --> 00:22:25.020\ncontrol a little bit more too, yep.\n\n442\n00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.660\n>> Yeah, I know there's a few settings\nwe can use to control that UAC behavior\n\n443\n00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.410\nbecause it, depending on what you're\ndoing, it can be a little intrusive.\n\n444\n00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.350\nBut they've given us the ability to\nkind of scale it back if we need to.\n\n445\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.920\n>> Yeah, so let's take a look at\nthe way that we would normally do it\n\n446\n00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.590\nwith a single user which is\nto go through Control Panel.\n\n447\n00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:47.035\nIf I go ahead and click on Start and\nControl Panel, it's under User Accounts.\n\n448\n00:22:47.035 --> 00:22:49.387\nAnd inside of User Accounts,\nI just select User Accounts again,\n\n449\n00:22:49.387 --> 00:22:51.380\ncuz that's the easiest way to see it.\n\n450\n00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.320\nAnd then what you have is\nright here where it says\n\n451\n00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.660\nChange User Account Control settings.\n\n452\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.000\nI would think after years and\n\n453\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.010\nyears that what they would do is actually\ngo look, that needs to be its own setting.\n\n454\n00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.424\nBut no,\nthey really do put it under User Accounts,\n\n455\n00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:04.683\ncuz I guess that's\nthe category it goes under.\n\n456\n00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:08.589\nNow inside of the earlier operating\nsystem, this is what it was,\n\n457\n00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:13.690\nwhich was the top most level here, and\nthis is what annoyed people like crazy.\n\n458\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.710\nIt didn't matter what you did,\nit was always gonna prompt you\n\n459\n00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.200\nto either accept it or to not accept it,\nis what it was gonna do.\n\n460\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.465\nAnd it turned out to be more annoying\nthan most people thought it would be.\n\n461\n00:23:23.465 --> 00:23:26.506\nSo beginning with Windows 7, they said\nlook, here's what we're gonna do,\n\n462\n00:23:26.506 --> 00:23:29.850\nwe're gonna allow a toggling situation and\ngive four different levels.\n\n463\n00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.380\nInside our earlier ones it was on or\nit was off, right,\n\n464\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.830\nin Vista you either turned it on or\nyou turned it off.\n\n465\n00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.408\nIn most enterprises they just said look\nforget that let's just turn it off\n\n466\n00:23:38.408 --> 00:23:39.797\nbecause it's so annoying.\n\n467\n00:23:39.797 --> 00:23:41.609\nSo now what they do instead,\n\n468\n00:23:41.609 --> 00:23:45.469\nis by this setting says don't\nnotify me when I make changes.\n\n469\n00:23:45.469 --> 00:23:49.155\nBut you know, that's all of a sudden\nwhere it actually does allow you or\n\n470\n00:23:49.155 --> 00:23:53.900\nwhoever's logged on here, you're not gonna\nmake, if you make changes don't notify me.\n\n471\n00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.377\nBut if something else is going on\nthat makes changes, yeah then, if\n\n472\n00:23:57.377 --> 00:24:01.537\nanother program launches in the background\nthen yes, it wants you to know that.\n\n473\n00:24:01.537 --> 00:24:04.723\nBut if you wanted to disable it just\nlike you had in the days of Windows XP,\n\n474\n00:24:04.723 --> 00:24:05.626\nyou simply do this.\n\n475\n00:24:05.626 --> 00:24:10.320\nNever notify, and\nthat absolutely will not run.\n\n476\n00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.274\nNow even with this setting right here,\n\n477\n00:24:13.274 --> 00:24:17.400\nwhat also ends up happening\nis when you do that is this.\n\n478\n00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.470\nNotice the background turns into\nthis nice gray shading here,\n\n479\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:27.060\ndark shading, and this is part of our\nsecurity screen, is what it actually is.\n\n480\n00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.580\nIn theory, what's happening here is that\nthe only thing that is active on this\n\n481\n00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.380\ncomputer at this very moment Is\nactually this window, so that means\n\n482\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.600\nprocesses should not be running in the\nbackground, shouldn't be doing anything.\n\n483\n00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.872\nWhat is waiting is for\nme to answer this question.\n\n484\n00:24:43.872 --> 00:24:48.224\nNow the difference between me, who's the\nfirst user who logged in to answer this\n\n485\n00:24:48.224 --> 00:24:51.872\nquestion, and somebody else that\nI created an account for on this,\n\n486\n00:24:51.872 --> 00:24:55.968\nis that instead of asking a yes or\nnow question, so if I'm the administrator\n\n487\n00:24:55.968 --> 00:25:00.320\nI get a yes or no question, if someone\nelse is logging on that's a standard user,\n\n488\n00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.504\nthey'll have to provide credentials.\n\n489\n00:25:02.504 --> 00:25:06.238\nThey'll have to provide,\nof course, credentials, username,\n\n490\n00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:09.239\npasswords, that give them\nthe ability to run this and\n\n491\n00:25:09.239 --> 00:25:11.851\nto say yes they want to be\nable to do this or not.\n\n492\n00:25:11.851 --> 00:25:15.466\nThe neat thing is, if you see where\nit's also by default if I leave it, so\n\n493\n00:25:15.466 --> 00:25:19.619\nif it's actually just left here, after\na while you see which one's highlighted,\n\n494\n00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:22.490\nwhich is the no, so\nthat means it defaults to no.\n\n495\n00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:26.620\nSo think about this, in theory,\nif there was some type of malicious\n\n496\n00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.660\nsoftware that got onto my computer,\nand it was sitting dormant, and\n\n497\n00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.850\nit decided to run something that required\nelevated privileges, administrative\n\n498\n00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:38.650\nprivileges, well then it doesn't have that\nability to actually go ahead and say hey,\n\n499\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.750\nwe're here, and\nthen we have to actually select that.\n\n500\n00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.538\nThis now actually requires\nus to select yes or no.\n\n501\n00:25:44.538 --> 00:25:47.940\nEven if a program can actually launch and\nsay I want it to run,\n\n502\n00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.970\nit doesn't have that ability to go say\nyes, go ahead and click on yes by default,\n\n503\n00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.720\nit has to actually have some\ninteraction at this point.\n\n504\n00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.170\nThe longer you leave it, the more likely\nit's actually going to default to no, and\n\n505\n00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.540\nthen it will clear out.\n\n506\n00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.090\nSo the good thing is during\nthe time that's it doing that and\n\n507\n00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:06.550\nin the background,\nnothing is going to be running.\n\n508\n00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:11.080\nNow when I say that and do that,\npeople really do get upset, because they\n\n509\n00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.340\ndo have other things that they might\nwant to still run in the background.\n\n510\n00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.410\nBut if you do that, there are places\ninside of the policy that we can go and\n\n511\n00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.950\nchange those settings so\nthat security screen doesn't come up.\n\n512\n00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.420\n>> Yeah, a big thing about that screen\nis it really takes a lot of graphical\n\n513\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.940\nprocessing power to dim out\nthe rest of the screen, so\n\n514\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.720\non some older systems it might\nchoke the system a little bit.\n\n515\n00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.560\nSo we can go in there, we can disable it.\n\n516\n00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.150\nAs Ronnie said,\nit's not as secure when you do that.\n\n517\n00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.470\nThe whole idea is, that's a modal\ndialog box, and what that means is\n\n518\n00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.930\nyou can only click on that dialog box,\nthe rest of the screen is inactive.\n\n519\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:50.350\nSo, I can't just slide that out\nof the way, not choose yes or\n\n520\n00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.280\nno, and try to continue to work or\nget other things to launch,\n\n521\n00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.130\nlike as a bad guy,\nwe have to choose yes or no.\n\n522\n00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:00.090\nBut that process can take a lot\nof graphical processing power, so\n\n523\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:02.940\nyou might wanna disable it from\nsome of your older systems.\n\n524\n00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.580\n>> So, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at how to do that.\n\n525\n00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.650\nThe best place, again,\nis gonna be through Group Policy.\n\n526\n00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.910\nSo hopefully you're actually\nnoticing a pattern here, that if\n\n527\n00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.840\nyou're in Enterprise, Group Policy is the\nway to set all this stuff so it's set up\n\n528\n00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.290\nthe way that you want it to be and not the\nway that the user's gonna want it to be.\n\n529\n00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.245\nSo we're simply gonna use our\nlocal group policy to illustrate,\n\n530\n00:27:21.245 --> 00:27:26.430\ngpedit.msc, and\n\n531\n00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.040\nthat will bring us up again, and there's\nthat strange error again on my machine.\n\n532\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.720\nSo I'll probably need to rebuild\nthis machine at some point here.\n\n533\n00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.630\nSo what were gonna do is we're gonna\ntake a look underneath our computer\n\n534\n00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.880\nconfiguration and Windows settings.\n\n535\n00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:45.230\nAnd under Windows settings we're going\nto go down to Security Settings, and\n\n536\n00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:50.230\nin Security Settings, Local Policies, and\n\n537\n00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.520\nin Local Policies,\nof course, Security Options.\n\n538\n00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.680\nNow, let me go ahead and\nkind of make sure I sort them.\n\n539\n00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.590\nI'm going to scroll all the way down\ntoward the bottom here and you'll notice\n\n540\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:09.620\nthere a few of these settings for\nUAC, the User Account Control.\n\n541\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:14.640\nNow when we type in the UAC here, there\nare a couple of them that we want to take\n\n542\n00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.400\na look at if we're trying to\nget rid of that screen, and\n\n543\n00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.290\nthe first one is right here where\nit says user account control,\n\n544\n00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.880\nswitch to secure desktop when\nprompting for elevation.\n\n545\n00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.270\nNotice it is currently enabled.\n\n546\n00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.360\nIf I don't want that happening because it\nis an older system like what Mike said,\n\n547\n00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.800\nI simply select Disabled,\nand then I can click OK.\n\n548\n00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.710\nNow if I choose that, and we do what\nwe were talking about before, so\n\n549\n00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.960\nlet me go ahead and run the Command Prompt\nhere in administrative mode here,\n\n550\n00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.800\nnotice that now it is\nnot in the background.\n\n551\n00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.070\nSo it's not actually waiting for me,\nfrom here I can actually hover and\n\n552\n00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.680\nlook at that, I can actually launch\nother things like what Mike was saying,\n\n553\n00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.700\neven though the UAC prompt is up.\n\n554\n00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.670\nAnd even though that's a possibility,\nthat's not the greatest possibility in\n\n555\n00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:07.620\nthe world, but if you do need that,\nthat's what exactly you would do.\n\n556\n00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.660\nAnd so that way you can see where you\nmight actually choose to secure that\n\n557\n00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.600\ndesktop, and so when you disable it,\nyou're actually turning that mode off.\n\n558\n00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.910\nNow the other one, of course, that you\nmay also want to take a look at is,\n\n559\n00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:24.710\nhow do we actually change the overall\nbehavior here for, well, everyone?\n\n560\n00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.150\nWell, notice that if you actually\nswitch the secure desktop to prompting,\n\n561\n00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.280\nyou also have this where it's\nthe behavior of the elevation prompt for\n\n562\n00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.980\nthe administrator and admin approval mode.\n\n563\n00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.640\nAnd right now it says prompt for\nconsent for non-Windows binaries, so\n\n564\n00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.830\nthis means third party,\nyes go ahead and prompt me for, but\n\n565\n00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.540\nnotice you have, well,\na lot of these other ones.\n\n566\n00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.770\nAm I prompting for credentials if I\nwant the administrator to also do that?\n\n567\n00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:52.530\nWe can do that as well, so\nyou actually do have several options.\n\n568\n00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:54.880\nAnd then you want to also do that for\n\n569\n00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.130\nthe standard users if you want to\nchange what they're actually gonna do.\n\n570\n00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.540\nIf I don't want them having to worry\nabout answering it automatic or not,\n\n571\n00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.084\nworry about the, in other words, if I want\nto deny all, I was about to say a word.\n\n572\n00:30:07.084 --> 00:30:08.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I want to deny everything,\n\n573\n00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.610\nno matter what they actually choose here,\n\n574\n00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.320\nautomatically deny\nelevation requests at all.\n\n575\n00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.920\nSo don't even give them the chance\nto say yes or no, let me deny it.\n\n576\n00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.230\nI can prompt for\ncredentials on these secure desktop.\n\n577\n00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.950\nWell, I've disabled that,\nthat doesn't actually work for us, and\n\n578\n00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.600\nthen we also have the prompt for\ncredentials here.\n\n579\n00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.340\nSo you do have, you know, several settings\nthat can help you to change the overall\n\n580\n00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.656\nbehavior of the UAC for\neverybody in your organization.\n\n581\n00:30:33.656 --> 00:30:36.457\nIt's finding the right\ncombination that works for\n\n582\n00:30:36.457 --> 00:30:38.416\nyou that is going to be the key here.\n\n583\n00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:42.154\n>> Very good, a lot of great information\ntrying to help us keep our Windows 7\n\n584\n00:30:42.154 --> 00:30:45.790\nmachines safe, how to go in and\nconfigure some of those settings.\n\n585\n00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.710\nThey can do just that, but,\nRonnie, looking at our clock,\n\n586\n00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:49.610\nwe're about out of time.\n\n587\n00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.780\nAny parting thoughts for our viewers?\n\n588\n00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:56.200\n>> Well, just remember that, for us,\nit really is, it takes time, but, and\n\n589\n00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.720\nit takes a little bit of effort,\nto getting this stuff right.\n\n590\n00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.760\nUnderstanding what it is we're,\nat least available to us for\n\n591\n00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:07.300\ntroubleshooting tools is gonna be key\nif we're gonna be supporting users.\n\n592\n00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.250\nIt's easy to rely on the software, and\n\n593\n00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.960\nthink that the software runs,\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n594\n00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.870\nBut then when a system does get infected,\nthat's something that we actually have to\n\n595\n00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:19.860\nbe able to identify, and then from that\npoint, take a little bit of action on.\n\n596\n00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.930\nAnd hopefully at that point,\nwe are actually going to be supporting our\n\n597\n00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.260\nusers better if we can combine that with\na group policy and get it all set up.\n\n598\n00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.390\nDon't turn of the UAC.\n\n599\n00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.830\nI know it's very tempting,\nbut don't do it.\n\n600\n00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:35.500\nThat's also another key to really keeping\nyour machine as safe as possible.\n\n601\n00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.030\n>> Very good.\n\n602\n00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.410\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n603\n00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:39.920\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n604\n00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.150\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike

00:00:15.030\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.510\nWith me today is Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.500\nHow are you doing, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.696\n>> I'm doing fine.\nIt's another great day to be right here as\n\n7\n00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:23.544\nwe take a look at more tech skills,\nwe're technically at supporting Windows 7,\n\n8\n00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:27.600\nmore towards the technical side, not\nreally toward the exam objectives side.\n\n9\n00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.225\nTrying to say look, we as professionals,\n\n10\n00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:32.037\nwe need to understand several things\nabout the way that Windows 7 works.\n\n11\n00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:35.225\nAnd for us, we're actually\nheading into more security, and\n\n12\n00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:38.390\nwe're talking about security\nbest practices today.\n\n13\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.490\nAnd best practices, Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.185\nWhen we start talking about that.\n\n15\n00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:44.236\nThat's something that can be overlooked\nvery quickly just because I want to get it\n\n16\n00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:47.406\nup and functioning and I overlook it and\njust push it out there and\n\n17\n00:00:47.406 --> 00:00:49.714\nthen I start experiencing\nissues sometimes.\n\n18\n00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:54.033\n>> Absolutely it is really\neasy to get in that rush.\n\n19\n00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:58.220\nYou get a brand new server and you want\nto get it in the rack and fire it up.\n\n20\n00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.984\nAnd you ignore all those\nbest practices and\n\n21\n00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:01.997\nthat's going to get you\nin trouble really fast.\n\n22\n00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:05.260\nThey are best practices for\na reason, right?\n\n23\n00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.910\nPeople have done this before,\nthey know what works what doesn't work.\n\n24\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.550\nThey know how to keep these systems safe.\n\n25\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.170\nYour Windows box being no different.\n\n26\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.533\nSo paying attention to these best\npractices they might not be ready for\n\n27\n00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.909\nyou but for the most part these\nare things that you're gonna wanna do.\n\n28\n00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.155\n>> Yeah, so, when we start talking\nabout trying to set up best practices,\n\n29\n00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:26.298\none of the things that we're always\nconcerned about is when we install\n\n30\n00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:27.377\nthe operating system.\n\n31\n00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:31.905\nRemember that it might have actually\ncome on an actual, for those of you that\n\n32\n00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:36.520\nremember, and old plastic disc that on\none side almost looked like a mirror.\n\n33\n00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.034\nBut you couldn't actually see a lot in it.\n\n34\n00:01:38.034 --> 00:01:40.509\nOn the other side,\nit actually had stuff written on it.\n\n35\n00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.350\nThat's what we called a DVD.\n\n36\n00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.880\nNow, you're probably saying,\nI still use DVDs.\n\n37\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.580\nBut a lot of times,\n\n38\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.510\nlike around here I don't remember the last\ntime I actually used a DVD for anything.\n\n39\n00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.934\nSo they've actually kind of gone\nthe way of the dodo a lot of times.\n\n40\n00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:54.629\nEspecially on newer laptops and\nthings, but the very fact is,\n\n41\n00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:59.230\nif you actually use one of those discs\nto let's say, put an operating system,\n\n42\n00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.770\nlike Windows 7 on your computer.\n\n43\n00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.732\nWell the very fact is that there\nis no updates to that thing.\n\n44\n00:02:04.732 --> 00:02:07.866\nAnd so the first time that you\nrun it you may actually go and\n\n45\n00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.380\ndo what I've done before.\n\n46\n00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.663\nWhich is to turn on automatic updates and\n\n47\n00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:14.895\nyou see something like 173\nupdates pending install.\n\n48\n00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:17.270\nAnd you're like wow that's\nquite a few updates.\n\n49\n00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.140\nAnd then you update it and then all of\na sudden it actually does it again and\n\n50\n00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.360\nthere's like a 112 updates.\n\n51\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.590\nWow that's quite a lot, and\nit keeps going on that system.\n\n52\n00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.937\nWell we do have to remember that\nupdates are actually important.\n\n53\n00:02:27.937 --> 00:02:29.509\nI could forgo them, but\n\n54\n00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:35.130\none of our best practices is about making\nsure our system is actually updated.\n\n55\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.404\nNow this is kind of a little bit of\nan unusual thing for old people like me.\n\n56\n00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:41.701\nAnd the reason why is when I started\nout like with Windows 95 and\n\n57\n00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:45.629\nactually even Windows 3.1, but\nI didn't even do any updates in 3.1.\n\n58\n00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.977\nIn Windows 95, I remember when\nI started searching around and\n\n59\n00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:53.007\npeople saying look updates, well when\nyou started reading those like only,\n\n60\n00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:57.663\neven from Microsoft, only update if you're\nexperiencing this issue, and that was it.\n\n61\n00:02:57.663 --> 00:03:00.156\nWell if you're only\nexperiencing that issue,\n\n62\n00:03:00.156 --> 00:03:02.920\nthen you go well should I\nupdate my computer or not?\n\n63\n00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.628\nI'm not really experiencing it but\nthat's the way it used to be.\n\n64\n00:03:05.628 --> 00:03:09.948\nWell today, though, it's a lot different\nbecause there are more security based and\n\n65\n00:03:09.948 --> 00:03:13.968\ntoday keeping our system up to date is one\nof the most important things that we can\n\n66\n00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:16.731\ndo to help us in dealing with\nsecurity best practices.\n\n67\n00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:19.728\nCuz if we don't have an up to date system,\n\n68\n00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:23.280\nthat means our code in\nour computers is old.\n\n69\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.936\nAnd it could actually lead\nto some vulnerability.\n\n70\n00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:27.512\n>> Absolutely you have Microsoft and\nother vendors, and\n\n71\n00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:29.620\nwe're talking about Microsoft here.\n\n72\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.850\nThey know about these vulnerabilities.\n\n73\n00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.250\nThey discover them in our operating\nsystem, flaws, what have you.\n\n74\n00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.050\nThey create updates.\n\n75\n00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.780\nThey put them out there for us to get.\n\n76\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.871\nVery important that we're\ngetting those on a timely basis.\n\n77\n00:03:38.871 --> 00:03:42.441\n>> Now, on that timely basis idea, there's\na couple of different ways of course that\n\n78\n00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:43.872\nyou know that we can get updates.\n\n79\n00:03:43.872 --> 00:03:47.730\nOne, for\nan individual using it is perfectly easy.\n\n80\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.092\nYou simply turn on the automatic\nupdates on your system, and\n\n81\n00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:51.261\nit reaches out to Microsoft.\n\n82\n00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:54.150\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n83\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.610\nSo if you actually do have your computer\nsystem, it's normally by default.\n\n84\n00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.006\nIt's gonna have automatic\nupdates turned on.\n\n85\n00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:03.678\nBut if you're not sure, all you have to do\nis actually go to the Control Panel, so\n\n86\n00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:08.550\nI click on Start and Control Panel,\nand then select System and Security.\n\n87\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.350\nAnd notice we have Windows Update here.\n\n88\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.270\nNow if you select Windows Update and\nyou do have it to automatically turn on,\n\n89\n00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.220\nthis is what you should see\nis something like this.\n\n90\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.310\nYou shouldn't see that you\nhave 37 important updates.\n\n91\n00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.230\nBut you should see something fairly\nsimilar where you actually will have this.\n\n92\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.420\nWe have updates that are important and\nalso optional updates.\n\n93\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.810\nWhat we're looking to check is\nwhere it says change settings and\n\n94\n00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.140\nthis is what will get us onto\nsome type of scheduled setting.\n\n95\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.310\nNow notice that the default\nrecommended settings is right here.\n\n96\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.067\nInstall updates automatically\nas recommended.\n\n97\n00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:40.674\nThis actually checks at 3 o'clock and\ngoes and\n\n98\n00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:43.680\ninstalls new updates at 3:00 AM every day.\n\n99\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.350\nDuring the day,\nit is checking for updates.\n\n100\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.200\nIt may even be downloading them as\nyou think about it as you actually\n\n101\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.270\nusing your computer.\n\n102\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.160\nBut it normally doesn't want to\ninstall while you're actually in\n\n103\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.220\nthe middle of doing some type of\nproductivity work that you're doing.\n\n104\n00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.042\nSo it'll wait until the time\n\n105\n00:04:56.042 --> 00:04:57.764\nwhen it believes that nobody is\ngoing to be on the computer.\n\n106\n00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:02.658\n3:00 AM seems to be a, kind of a nice time\nor some arbitrary time that they pick, and\n\n107\n00:05:02.658 --> 00:05:05.250\nthat was perfectly fine for them.\n\n108\n00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.305\nAnd of course you do have other\nones here that you may also choose.\n\n109\n00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:12.493\nThe not recommend one of course is to\nNever check for updates so that's never\n\n110\n00:05:12.493 --> 00:05:16.486\na good idea unless you know that your\nsystems not gonna be used by anyone,\n\n111\n00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:19.188\nyou're not gonna actually\nplug anything into.\n\n112\n00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:21.360\nYou're not gonna plug into the Internet.\n\n113\n00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.993\nYou're not gonna install any programs that\nyou don't know about, well that's probably\n\n114\n00:05:24.993 --> 00:05:27.735\na great one, but over all though,\nyou do have these other options.\n\n115\n00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:31.514\nSome of these were done at a time\nin which it was really important,\n\n116\n00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:34.990\ndepending on your, let's say,\nyour bandwidth, right.\n\n117\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.325\nSo imagine this one, Check updates, but\nlet me choose whether to download and\n\n118\n00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:40.189\ninstall them.\n\n119\n00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.772\nIf you have a fairly\nslow Internet connection,\n\n120\n00:05:42.772 --> 00:05:46.583\nthis may actually be something that\nyou choose right here, so that you\n\n121\n00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:50.779\ncan see what updates are out there, and\nthen just pick a few of them at a time and\n\n122\n00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:55.070\nactually install them when you\nactually do have the ability to do so.\n\n123\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.910\nOr it also is about the fact\nthat you may actually not have\n\n124\n00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.550\na lot of hard drive space.\n\n125\n00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.060\nWhen at one point in time, right,\n\n126\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.870\nwe had like ten-gigabyte hard drives and\nstuff like that.\n\n127\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.700\nAnd so you could see where now you\nactually have a limited amount of space\n\n128\n00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.630\nthat you may also choose that one, too.\n\n129\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.040\nDownload them but then let you choose\nwhen to install them, as well.\n\n130\n00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.055\nGives you a chance to have everything on\nfile, but then actually have to go in and\n\n131\n00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:20.890\nexamine them and\nlook at which ones you want to install.\n\n132\n00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.217\nMost end users are probably not\ngonna do something like that, but\n\n133\n00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.254\nyou can if you actually were\ntrying to keep control of that.\n\n134\n00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:29.062\nAnd inside of a small office setting,\n\n135\n00:06:29.062 --> 00:06:31.659\nthis may actually be the one\nthat really helps you out,\n\n136\n00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.730\nbecause then you can go back and actually\nmanually chose which ones you want.\n\n137\n00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.045\nAutomatic is just gonna take,\nwhat they call of course,\n\n138\n00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:40.809\nall of those recommended ones, and\nthose ones that are important.\n\n139\n00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:44.550\nAnd install them immediately as much\nas possible because a majority of those\n\n140\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.243\nare gonna be security types of updates\nthat we really need to keep track of.\n\n141\n00:06:48.243 --> 00:06:54.630\nSo there are these options that are\navailable to us directly from Microsoft.\n\n142\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.224\nBut Mike if I actually had\nlet's say a company and\n\n143\n00:06:57.224 --> 00:07:01.094\nI'm supporting thousands of users\nthat's not the most efficient way.\n\n144\n00:07:01.094 --> 00:07:04.520\nI can't imagine a thousand\nworkstations connecting all the same\n\n145\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.628\nbetween midnight and 3 o'clock in the\nmorning to go out to Microsoft and say,\n\n146\n00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:11.260\nlet me get all my updates and\nlet me download them.\n\n147\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.451\nThere's gotta be a better way to do this,\nright?\n\n148\n00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:13.706\n>> There absolutely is.\n\n149\n00:07:13.706 --> 00:07:18.110\nOne of the problems we have with these\nupdates is that they can cause problems.\n\n150\n00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.340\nIt's not unheard of for\nan update to get pushed out and\n\n151\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.280\nit causes a problem with some\nline of business application or\n\n152\n00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.440\nsome kind of combination of software\nthat you've got running on that system.\n\n153\n00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.754\nAnd if I'm letting my users get their own\nupdates, decide which updates they want or\n\n154\n00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:35.473\nnot, I don't have any control.\n\n155\n00:07:35.473 --> 00:07:39.061\nWhereas we can use something called\nWindows Server Update Services in\n\n156\n00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:40.860\na corporate environment.\n\n157\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.498\nInstead of all my end users going out\nto Microsoft to get their updates,\n\n158\n00:07:44.498 --> 00:07:47.788\nthey go to my local,\ninternal update server that I'm running.\n\n159\n00:07:47.788 --> 00:07:48.693\nAnd I get to pick and\n\n160\n00:07:48.693 --> 00:07:51.872\nchoose which updates are going to\nbe pushed out of those machines.\n\n161\n00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:53.560\nGives me a chance to test them first,\n\n162\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.620\nmake sure they're not going to\ncause a problem in my environment.\n\n163\n00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.894\nAnd then approve them for\nthe rest of machines.\n\n164\n00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:02.420\nSo, that's typically what you'll\nsee in a corporate environment.\n\n165\n00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.950\n>> Yeah, and that's something you\nreally want to make sure of, right?\n\n166\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.960\nThat if you are in that setting, even\nthough you might say, well, I wanna get\n\n167\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.780\nthese updates immediately but you go out\nand try to get them from Microsoft, right?\n\n168\n00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.800\nWell, sometimes your environment\nmay allow you to do so.\n\n169\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.250\nBut usually it's not going to\nbe cuz through group policy,\n\n170\n00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.080\nthey're probably gonna set it up\nto the point where all of your\n\n171\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.380\nupdates are actually gonna come through\nthat Windows service's update server\n\n172\n00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.240\nis where it's gonna come through,\nthe WSUS server.\n\n173\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.400\nAnd that's actually a good thing, cuz of\nall of the things that Mike mentioned.\n\n174\n00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.610\nThere are updates out there that\nyour system may not actually need.\n\n175\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.910\nAnd may even break your system and then,\nthat's what they don't want to happen.\n\n176\n00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.210\nSo, having someone else administrate and\nbe able to do that,\n\n177\n00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.700\nthat is a security best practice that\nwe definitely want to follow, as well.\n\n178\n00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.830\nNow, when we do get updates,\nthere is a possibility, though,\n\n179\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.320\nthat we have what we call those important\nones and even those optional ones.\n\n180\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.220\nAnd sometimes they fail,\nsometimes they succeed, and\n\n181\n00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.890\nwe need to know what to do when\nsomething like that happens.\n\n182\n00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.380\nSo, let's take a look at my machine again,\n\n183\n00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.290\nand that way we'll actually kinda\nsee a couple of options for us.\n\n184\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:10.660\nSo, on this machine, even though I've\nrecently updated it, probably last notice\n\n185\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.030\nright here, 8:20, last time I even\nthought about, several hours ago.\n\n186\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:20.070\nAnd even several hours ago, I had 37\nupdates come from that particular point,\n\n187\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.530\nand then another 90 additional updates.\n\n188\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.370\nNow, if I wanted to inspect what those\nare, I can then click on that link and\n\n189\n00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.200\nyou can see right here on these 37\nones notice the term security update.\n\n190\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.370\nWell, that probably means that\nthey're actually important for\n\n191\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.300\nus when we start taking\na look at those systems.\n\n192\n00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.860\nAnd so, if you actually wanted to actually\nnot do any of them you can simply\n\n193\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.220\nuncheck them.\n\n194\n00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.090\nAnd then go ahead and download all the\noptionals if you want to, or you can put\n\n195\n00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.810\na check right there and do that or\nyou can select which ones you want.\n\n196\n00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.000\nWhen you take a look at some of these\nupdates, what you're going to do,\n\n197\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.270\nif you're actually the one in charge\nof taking a look at some of these.\n\n198\n00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.160\nLet me go back to the one I checked,\nwhere is it?\n\n199\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.010\nOh, that's it again, you can see at\nthe right hand side what it describes and\n\n200\n00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:00.970\nwhat your looking for\n\n201\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.190\na lot of times you're not exactly\nsure if this is too general for you.\n\n202\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:09.260\nTake this knowledge base number and you\ncan then type into a search engine and be\n\n203\n00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.860\nable to pull up what that update is going\nto affect and what isn't going to affect.\n\n204\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.920\nAnd sometimes you will see where\nthe system really does actually make\n\n205\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.040\nchanges and there are even\ncorruptions with these updates.\n\n206\n00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.580\nWe had one happen like that right here,\nwhere the system updated overnight and now\n\n207\n00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.880\nall of a sudden the dual screen monitors\ndidn't work the way that they needed to.\n\n208\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.940\nWe went back and we saw three updates\nthat had installed overnight.\n\n209\n00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.500\nAnd then when we actually typed\nin the knowledge based article,\n\n210\n00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.930\nthere were actually links to like the\nsocial sites on Microsoft, that say yeah,\n\n211\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.090\nwe're experiencing the same issue, and\nthey posted that is was a known issue.\n\n212\n00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.700\nThat working with dual\nmonitors in this update,\n\n213\n00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.080\nit didn't work the way that it needed to.\n\n214\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.040\nSo, what did we have to do?\n\n215\n00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.160\nWe had to go in and manually,\n\n216\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.270\nactually uninstall that one\nupdate that had been installed.\n\n217\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.860\nSo, you might also see things like that.\n\n218\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.330\nNow, the other thing of course\nthat you can also do here,\n\n219\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:04.370\nI think is that after you installed, after\nyou actually get a list of them like this,\n\n220\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.090\nis that you can go ahead and\nselect the one's that you want and\n\n221\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.630\nnot or if you don't wanna see that update\nagain cuz it may cause other issues.\n\n222\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.078\nYou can simply right click on, I was\ntrying to right click and then select,\n\n223\n00:11:16.078 --> 00:11:17.600\nhide that update.\n\n224\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.750\nAnd now, when you take a look at\nthe difference, you can barely see it but\n\n225\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.830\nyou see where it's grayed out.\n\n226\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.600\nAnd in theory, that should actually kinda\nblock that update from happening again.\n\n227\n00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.700\nAnd that way, you can ignore\nit safely until you actually\n\n228\n00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.130\nrealize that they might have actually come\nup with something that superseded that\n\n229\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.260\nparticular update that's\ncausing the issues.\n\n230\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.870\nSo, there's a lot of things that\nwe can do with just those updates.\n\n231\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.050\nNow the other thing that we can also do,\nI went ahead and\n\n232\n00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.910\nhit the back, is I want to actually take a\nlook at what might have actually updated.\n\n233\n00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.980\nSo, I selected the view update history and\nthis is where you can see if something\n\n234\n00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.440\nactually did install and\nwas successful or actually failed.\n\n235\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.880\nSo notice I have a failed important,\nand I have a failed optional here.\n\n236\n00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.040\nSo, if I wanted to, I could select\nthat one and view the details.\n\n237\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.430\nAnd that way, I can actually see what\nthis issue is about as well, and\n\n238\n00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:13.380\nthen probably go ahead and try to retrieve\nthat update once again to be reinstalled.\n\n239\n00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.260\nSometimes, you will get this cuz of one\nreason or another whether I was clicking\n\n240\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.800\non something while the update was gonna or\nwhatever was happening during the install\n\n241\n00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.660\nor the very fact that I rebooted\nthe machine halfway through the install.\n\n242\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.970\nYou might actually take the look and\n\n243\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.040\nsee if this is a very essential update for\nyou.\n\n244\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.960\nOn these optional once again,\nyou take a look at the very same thing.\n\n245\n00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.750\nAnd you're actually able to do that,\nas well.\n\n246\n00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.680\nNotice we also have a link where it says,\nif you know that an update is causing\n\n247\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.450\nissues, you may not be able to go in at\nthis point if you can't really log in.\n\n248\n00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:50.310\nBut if you can, you can select\nthe installed updates once again and\n\n249\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.610\nthen it should actually\nbring up the list here,\n\n250\n00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.090\nif my machine, looks like it's\nactually slowly populating.\n\n251\n00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.910\nThere's a lot of updates that\ncame in on this machine here.\n\n252\n00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.920\nI should be able then to select that from\nthe list and go ahead and uninstall that\n\n253\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.610\nupdate, reboot the machine, see if\nnow the issue is still in place too.\n\n254\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:13.099\nWow, even though it actually\nselected it's still\n\n255\n00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:17.590\nkinda locking it up there but you actually\nsee it as it's going across the screen.\n\n256\n00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.512\nSo, once everything is done.\n\n257\n00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:23.666\n[SOUND]\n>> That's one that does not support.\n\n258\n00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:27.010\n[CROSSTALK] Some of these updates you're\ngonna find don't support removal.\n\n259\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.775\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n260\n00:13:27.775 --> 00:13:30.434\n>> Once they're installed, you can't\nsimply [CROSSTALK] uninstall them.\n\n261\n00:13:30.434 --> 00:13:32.156\nSo as you're clicking on\nthose different ones,\n\n262\n00:13:32.156 --> 00:13:35.020\nsometimes you'll get an uninstall button\nup at the top, sometimes you won't.\n\n263\n00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.453\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you don't get that button that\n\n264\n00:13:37.453 --> 00:13:41.816\nupdate is not available for removal, and\nthe only way to get rid of it would be to\n\n265\n00:13:41.816 --> 00:13:46.310\ngo to a restore point, or a backup\nbefore that installation had occurred.\n\n266\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.730\n>> Yeah, so when you take, I'm trying\nto see where I can get, there it goes.\n\n267\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.260\nThese two up here, so\nlike one of these right?\n\n268\n00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.980\nThis second one right here doesn't have\nthe uninstall, but this first one does or\n\n269\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.320\nI can select that and simply\nuninstall it and get it ready to go.\n\n270\n00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.120\nBut Mike bringing up the restore points,\nit's also a very important option for us\n\n271\n00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.490\nto think about if we do have them turned\non, and we're ready to use that as well.\n\n272\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.720\nSo, we can't overlook this.\n\n273\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.540\nA lot of times, I think that just because\nI've turned on automatic updates it\n\n274\n00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.890\nmeans that everything installed perfectly,\nwell, I do need to monitor them, and for\n\n275\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.960\none machine it's easy enough to do, but\n\n276\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.520\nalso if you actually go to those WSUS, you\ncan also end up pulling reports that will\n\n277\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.900\nactually tell you which one's installed\nand which one did not as well.\n\n278\n00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.480\nWe're the ones that have to be vigilant\nthough about checking those logs.\n\n279\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.210\n>> Absolutely and\nwith those failed updates,\n\n280\n00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.395\ntypically what I'll do is if I see\nsome have failed I'll go ahead and\n\n281\n00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:37.250\nre-scan to see if I have\nany updates available.\n\n282\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.200\nSometimes what happens when you get\na large number of updates, let's say you\n\n283\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.150\nrecently installed the operating system,\nand the operating system's a little bit\n\n284\n00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.620\nolder, like Windows 7 is, or maybe you've\ngot an image that's being pulled down and\n\n285\n00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:52.960\ndeployed out at your company's location\nand that image was made six months ago.\n\n286\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.170\nAs soon as that image gets deployed,\nit reaches out to the Internet and\n\n287\n00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.620\nit downloads a lot of updates.\n\n288\n00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.910\nAnd as Ronnie was saying earlier,\n\n289\n00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.020\nsometimes one update will\nsupersede another update.\n\n290\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.430\nAnd what can happen is, it sees this list,\n\n291\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.280\nit downloads them all then\nit installs one update.\n\n292\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.690\nWhen it gets to the next one, it goes oh,\n\n293\n00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.220\nI don't need that one anymore cuz of\nthat other one that's been installed.\n\n294\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.360\nAnd so it shows up as failed,\nthat if you scan again you'll see that\n\n295\n00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.450\nupdate doesn't even show up in your\nlist of possible updates to get.\n\n296\n00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.340\nSo sometimes, the figure's not\na problem with the update is just that,\n\n297\n00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.420\nthat update is no longer needed cuz of\nother updates you've done to the system.\n\n298\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.350\n>> Yeah, so when we start taking at that,\nupdates are by far\n\n299\n00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.350\none of the more important things that\nwe can do with the operating system.\n\n300\n00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.890\nBut where we also fail in\nupdates a lot of times\n\n301\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.080\ndepends on the applications\nthat we have on our computers.\n\n302\n00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.979\nWe've gotta remember that third party\napplications are also vulnerable if we\n\n303\n00:15:42.979 --> 00:15:46.300\ndon't also check out and\ntry to find updates for those things too.\n\n304\n00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.327\nIt's notorious right now,\nthat if you try and\n\n305\n00:15:50.327 --> 00:15:56.840\nlike update Microsoft Office,\nthe updates are not 25 megs or 35 megs.\n\n306\n00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.464\nNow, the last one that I got was something\nlike 600 megabytes of an update,\n\n307\n00:16:01.464 --> 00:16:03.700\n800 megabytes of an update.\n\n308\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.570\nAnd you're wondering why didn't they just\nreplace the entire program instead, and\n\n309\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.050\nwhatever they're doing in the background,\nthese things are huge and\n\n310\n00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.460\nthey're gigantic.\n\n311\n00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.440\nAnd there's gotta be a reason for them.\n\n312\n00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.080\nSo we also need to take a look\nat your third party apps and\n\n313\n00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.400\nmake sure that those are updated\nas much as possible too.\n\n314\n00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.610\nIf somebody's found a vulnerability that\nit doesn't take the operating system being\n\n315\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.850\nvulnerable, it just takes that\napplication being vulnerable as well.\n\n316\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.270\nSo, make sure you go out and\ncheck that vendor out, and\n\n317\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.310\nbe able to actually understand where\nthose updates are coming from, and\n\n318\n00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.370\nof course make sure they're being applied\nwhen they need to be applied as well.\n\n319\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.750\n>> Now, another big best practice that\nwe're gonna talk about here is encryption.\n\n320\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.980\nWe've gotta look at how we\ncan keep our data safe,\n\n321\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.830\nmake sure that only authorized people\nare able to access the information.\n\n322\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.859\nMake sure it's safe while\nthe data's at rest.\n\n323\n00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.450\nAnd especially on our mobile devices, cuz\nthese are devices that are easy to leave\n\n324\n00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:58.220\nlaying around, easy to be stolen,\npeople can yank those hard drives out, and\n\n325\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.700\nMicrosoft gives us ways to\nprotect that as well, right?\n\n326\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.440\n>> It really does.\n\n327\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.820\nWhat Microsoft does is, there's two\ntechnologies that we can end up using that\n\n328\n00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.760\nare built into the operating system,\nand not even the operating system,\n\n329\n00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.630\nactually even into the file system\nthat really help us out as well.\n\n330\n00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.290\nOne of course is to protect the individual\nfiles that we have access to.\n\n331\n00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.260\nAnd that is a file system level\nencryption, and that's what we call EFS,\n\n332\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.060\nthe encrypting file system.\n\n333\n00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.240\nThe other one, of course,\n\n334\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.950\nis to help to protect the entire\ncontents of the hard drive.\n\n335\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.380\nAnd that is what we call\na full drive encryption.\n\n336\n00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.660\nAnd that is BitLocker is usually\nthe technology that we want\n\n337\n00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.880\nto talk about there.\n\n338\n00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.720\nNow, BitLocker is a technology that\nreally does help us out when somebody\n\n339\n00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.790\ntakes the computer out of our system,\nand then they reboot the computer and\n\n340\n00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.850\nnow all of a sudden the entire contents\nof that hard drive is encrypted.\n\n341\n00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.110\nSo it's not just about them trying\nto break through passwords.\n\n342\n00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.470\nThey literally have to actually be able\nto get access into the computer itself.\n\n343\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.406\nSo for them to do that, they'd have to\nbreak through the entire drive encryption.\n\n344\n00:17:57.406 --> 00:18:00.780\nAnd then the entire drive is encrypted,\nthat means that even if they're able to\n\n345\n00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.910\nget the hard drive out of my computer, and\ntry and slide it into another computer,\n\n346\n00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:09.070\nit's still gonna be encrypted, it's still\ngonna have to cost them some time and\n\n347\n00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:12.210\neffort to try to go all right,\nnow they realize it's encrypted.\n\n348\n00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.930\nAnd the only thing that they can do with\nthat drive after that point once it's been\n\n349\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.800\nencrypted, of course,\nis to just format it and reuse the drive.\n\n350\n00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.230\nBut the data on it should be protected.\n\n351\n00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:27.200\nSo normally, the best practices especially\non the mobile devices like laptops,\n\n352\n00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.920\nis to try to run a combination\nof both if you can.\n\n353\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.330\nWell, this of course, goes back to the\nsecurity policies you have in place for\n\n354\n00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:39.210\nyour entire network but overall though\nthat’s what you want to be able to do.\n\n355\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.290\nSo what about bit locker?\n\n356\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.706\nLet's go ahead and start here with\nbit locker, just a little bit.\n\n357\n00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:47.135\nAnd then, we'll kinda take a look at\na couple of things too, at the same time,\n\n358\n00:18:47.135 --> 00:18:49.930\ncuz we can run both of them too.\n\n359\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.820\nSo if we want to trip the drive,\n\n360\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.480\nlet me make sure I'm matching on\nthe right machine here, I think I am.\n\n361\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.270\nLet me go ahead and let's do this.\n\n362\n00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.800\nNow, inside of Windows 7,\n\n363\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.880\nit does give us an easy way to be\nable to encrypt the files as well.\n\n364\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:08.780\nSo, apparently I've got one of these,\nit's really full there, all right, cool.\n\n365\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.870\nSo, all I have to do is I can right\nclick on that local disk C and\n\n366\n00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.150\nselect turn on BitLocker.\n\n367\n00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.260\nNow this normally requires\nwhat we call a TPM module.\n\n368\n00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.920\nIn Windows 7, it really wants that TPM,\nthat Trusted Platform Module.\n\n369\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.770\nAnd in most laptops today, you're\ngonna probably find the TPM module and\n\n370\n00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.305\nit'll work just fine.\n\n371\n00:19:28.305 --> 00:19:32.090\nCuz I'm using a virtual machine,\nI don't have that TPM and\n\n372\n00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.070\nso I had to disable\nthe ability to use that TPM.\n\n373\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.200\nThat TPM is a hardware module that\nreally does create the encryption\n\n374\n00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.200\nkeys that we need and stores at least\na private key of that encryption.\n\n375\n00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.790\nAnd that's what happens there so\n\n376\n00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.220\nit's actually designed to\nbe hardware locked down.\n\n377\n00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.085\nSo, not only that drive won't go in\nanybody's computer it's only actually\n\n378\n00:19:51.085 --> 00:19:55.530\ngonna work with this one computer and\nthat's also the key here too.\n\n379\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.450\nSo when we do this bit\nlocker drive encryption,\n\n380\n00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.260\nnotice that these other two\nare actually not available.\n\n381\n00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.110\nBitLocker without additional keys.\n\n382\n00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.450\nThat one's not available.\n\n383\n00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.810\nRequire a PIN at every start up.\n\n384\n00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:12.000\nBut this one, cuz I've turned\noff that requirement of the TPM\n\n385\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.060\nis gonna require us to have a start\nup key at every single start up.\n\n386\n00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.270\nWell, that actually is\ngonna be a USB key and\n\n387\n00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.540\nthat's the one that's actually\nalmost full on my machine.\n\n388\n00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.750\nWe'll see if it actually\nlets me save it there.\n\n389\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.110\nAnd let me select save and\nthen it says from that point here,\n\n390\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.460\nI've now saved that start up key.\n\n391\n00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.470\nThat start up key is\njust a basic XML file, so\n\n392\n00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:37.660\nwhen your computer boots up it should find\nthat XML file and have that key available\n\n393\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.720\nand then it should actually be able\nto boot up the way that we need.\n\n394\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.040\nThe second level of\nprotection that we have,\n\n395\n00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:49.030\nright is that we need to print this thing\nout or we need to save this to a file.\n\n396\n00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.390\nNow it's not recommended, of course,\nthat you save that recovery\n\n397\n00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.350\nkey to the drive that you're\nactually gonna be encrypting.\n\n398\n00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.900\nSo I'm gonna save this key to a file.\n\n399\n00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.482\nAnd I'm gonna put it in a shared drive,\nis what I'm gonna do here.\n\n400\n00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.750\nI'll put in my ITPRO TV and I've got\nanother key in there for another drive.\n\n401\n00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.090\nAnd I'll save it right there.\n\n402\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.580\nSo now I have two things.\n\n403\n00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.660\nI have that USB key that should\nprotect my system and I also have that\n\n404\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.240\nother as a back up in case I lose that\nUSB or somebody really does walk off with\n\n405\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.800\nmy laptop, and now I actually\ndon't have access to that USB key.\n\n406\n00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.030\nThey actually don't have access\nto USB key, which is key.\n\n407\n00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.180\nThen we click next, from that point you\ncan run the system integrity check, but\n\n408\n00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.000\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nstop that for right now.\n\n409\n00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.840\nAnd then we can start encrypting, so that\nway it doesn't have to run a check, and\n\n410\n00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.542\nthen that way it actually\nstarts encrypting.\n\n411\n00:21:40.542 --> 00:21:43.220\nIt's gonna take it's sweet\ntime in actually encrypting\n\n412\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.700\neverything on this drive and\nkey it in to that USB key.\n\n413\n00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.810\nNow, the good thing is we're not\ngoing to sit here and watch this.\n\n414\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.400\nI already went ahead and\ndid it over here, so\n\n415\n00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.550\nthat the end result of what we'll get\nwill look something similar to this.\n\n416\n00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.990\nNow, think about it in this way, right?\n\n417\n00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.790\nIf we are actually using this drive,\nwhat will end up happening,\n\n418\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:08.900\nlet's say that now at the end of the day,\nwe close out of this machine\n\n419\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.560\nI'm gonna shut it down and\nI'm gonna pull out the USB key and\n\n420\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:18.450\nwe store this start up\nkey some place different.\n\n421\n00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.040\nOkay?\n\n422\n00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.790\nSo if we store some place different,\n\n423\n00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.620\nperfectly fine as long as\nnobody walks off with it.\n\n424\n00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.950\nThen I should be able to boot up.\n\n425\n00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.640\nAnd what it's gonna ask me for,\nof course, is that same USB key.\n\n426\n00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.210\nSo you see here,\n\n427\n00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:35.070\nwhere it says BitLocker Drive Encrypted\nkey needed, insert the storage media,\n\n428\n00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:40.450\nor press escape to reboot the media\nafter it's actually in place.\n\n429\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.610\nNow, what could happen to that USB\nkey hopefully, will never happen.\n\n430\n00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.290\nIt could be that it\nbecomes corrupted somehow.\n\n431\n00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.800\nI did some things, static electricity,\nwhatever it is, it becomes corrupted,\n\n432\n00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.220\nand so now I put it back in,\neverything should be good.\n\n433\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.260\nI press escape to reboot or yep.\n\n434\n00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.151\nI think I did the right,\nI did the wrong one didn't I?\n\n435\n00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:01.820\nAll right.\nYep.\n\n436\n00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.490\nSo, there it is.\n\n437\n00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:07.170\nSo, let me go ahead and press escape\nto reboot and let it try and reboot and\n\n438\n00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.660\nit says look,\nI don't recognize that drive.\n\n439\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.110\nWell, it doesn't matter.\n\n440\n00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.540\nAs long as you have that recovery key,\nthis is what actually matters as well.\n\n441\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.500\nSo, it doesn't lock you out so much so\nbut if you don't have that USB key,\n\n442\n00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.010\nyou can't get back in.\n\n443\n00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.260\nOr let's say that your hard drive, or\nthe rest of the computer dies on you.\n\n444\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.520\nWell, what do you do if you have that?\n\n445\n00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.860\nSo from here, I simply hit that and\nthen I have to enter in this pass code.\n\n446\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:36.030\nNow this pass code is a 48 digit pass\ncode that you have to get in there.\n\n447\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.210\nNow, if you're on a non-english\ncomputer by default.\n\n448\n00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.420\nYou actually have to use the function\nkeys to enter all these in,\n\n449\n00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.860\nas far as numbers go.\n\n450\n00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.010\nThe F1 through the F9.\n\n451\n00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.400\nBut if you are on a US computer,\nyou just type it in.\n\n452\n00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.123\nSo, this one's a little bit long but\nwe can do it fairly quickly.\n\n453\n00:23:53.123 --> 00:24:01.214\n040821, 362296\n>> Now while Ron is typing in that number.\n\n454\n00:24:01.214 --> 00:24:04.074\nNow, again,\nthe ideal thing is to use a TPM chip,\n\n455\n00:24:04.074 --> 00:24:07.220\nwhere that information is\nstored on the motherboard.\n\n456\n00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.810\nIt's a secure location on the motherboard.\n\n457\n00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.710\nStored information there,\nyou type in your pin or\n\n458\n00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.895\nyour pass phrase,\nwhen you started that machine.\n\n459\n00:24:14.895 --> 00:24:16.665\nAnd you're good to go.\n\n460\n00:24:16.665 --> 00:24:18.635\nOr if you don't have a TPM,\nthen as Ronnie's done,\n\n461\n00:24:18.635 --> 00:24:21.245\nyou can store it on a USB thumb drive,\n\n462\n00:24:21.245 --> 00:24:25.425\nthe problem is that thumb drive\nbecomes a start up dongle, basically.\n\n463\n00:24:25.425 --> 00:24:28.324\nWithout that, you're not going to\nbe able to start up the system.\n\n464\n00:24:28.324 --> 00:24:30.832\nYou're gonna have to go in and\npunch in this recovery key, so\n\n465\n00:24:30.832 --> 00:24:34.772\nyou've got to take extra special\ncare of that thumb drive.\n\n466\n00:24:34.772 --> 00:24:35.922\nMake sure you keep it.\n\n467\n00:24:35.922 --> 00:24:37.962\nDon't keep it with the system though,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n468\n00:24:37.962 --> 00:24:41.597\nIf you get my laptop and the thumb\ndrive that has the start up key on it,\n\n469\n00:24:41.597 --> 00:24:43.732\n[LAUGH] then what was the point right?\n\n470\n00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:46.130\nNow you've got it all,\nyou're going to access my data just fine.\n\n471\n00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.908\n>> Yeah.\n\n472\n00:24:46.908 --> 00:24:50.160\n>> So now, if we have the ability\nto recover it, that's the key and\n\n473\n00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.950\nhopefully nobody else\nthat took the laptop.\n\n474\n00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.210\nWill also have the recovery key or\nthat thumb drive and\n\n475\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.500\nthat's what we're actually basing\nthe idea off of for best practice.\n\n476\n00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.320\nOn a laptop, it is by far essential if you\nhave any type of business items on there\n\n477\n00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.180\nyou don't want any of\nthat data coming out.\n\n478\n00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.909\nYou do want to use something\nlike this to help you out.\n\n479\n00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.920\nSo, I should be able to log in now.\n\n480\n00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.730\nSo, regardless of even though I didn't\nhave access to the key at that point,\n\n481\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:23.220\nif for one reason, like I said I\nlost it or somebody else took it.\n\n482\n00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.970\nThey shouldn't have the key but\nI should be able to if I actually also\n\n483\n00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.130\nkept that recovery key in a safe location\nlike in a stored network drive somewhere.\n\n484\n00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:35.430\nSo, you do have those options available to\nyou to be able to do that with Windows 7.\n\n485\n00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.180\nBut Windows 7 doesn't allow you to\nactually do it without the start up key\n\n486\n00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.370\nfor one reason.\n\n487\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.125\nNow, later editions you'll find\nout they give you that option.\n\n488\n00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:47.160\nCuz they know as long as it's on this\nmachine, sure go ahead and start it up.\n\n489\n00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.570\nBut on any other drive,\ndon't do it at all.\n\n490\n00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.540\nSo, you do have a little bit of quirkiness\nwith this one that you can do and\n\n491\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.180\nalso with Windows 7,\nyou have access to USB to go\n\n492\n00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.150\nwhich gives you that ability to do it for\nUSB thumb drives as well.\n\n493\n00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.280\nSo, being able to access it\nis one of those keys here.\n\n494\n00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.980\nAnd being our protector drive,\nif somebody walks off with it,\n\n495\n00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.700\nkind of one of the most important things\nthat we can do to keep our data safe.\n\n496\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.930\nNow, the other thing\nof course is that EFS.\n\n497\n00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.180\n>> Encrypting file system, yeah.\n\n498\n00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.000\nVery nice.\n\n499\n00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.800\n>> With the encrypting file system,\n\n500\n00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.890\nwe do have that ability to also encrypt\nindividual files, which is really good.\n\n501\n00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.140\nSo, we can also show you that.\n\n502\n00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.350\nNow, I've logged in as Mike at this point.\n\n503\n00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.010\nAnd you can see where\nI've logged in as Mike.\n\n504\n00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.560\n>> How'd you get my password?\n\n505\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.870\n>> It's easy, same as your luggage,\nis what it is, 1234.\n\n506\n00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.640\nSo, if I right click on the encrypted txt,\n\n507\n00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.250\nthen I can go down to properties and\nthe advance button and\n\n508\n00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.000\nthen of course, I can encrypt\nthe content to secure the data.\n\n509\n00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.050\nI go ahead and click there.\n\n510\n00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.210\nI see if that actually did it.\n\n511\n00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.590\nThere we go.\n\n512\n00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.440\nAnd then click okay.\n\n513\n00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.570\nAnd now it's gonna ask me\nwhat do I wanna encrypt.\n\n514\n00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.250\nI'm just gonna encrypt the file only for\nour demonstration, right here.\n\n515\n00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.510\nAnd click okay.\nNormally,\n\n516\n00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.370\nyou'll actually see it turns green,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n517\n00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.109\nMike should be able to\ntake a look into this.\n\n518\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.720\nIs Mike's encrypted file.\n\n519\n00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.920\nSo, notice that Mike actually doesn't\nlook like it's encrypted at all,\n\n520\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.110\nit's transparent for Mike, but\nit is actually encrypted at this point.\n\n521\n00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.740\nNow, this actually rely's on that EFS,\nthat encrypted file system.\n\n522\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.430\nIt also rely's on a key and certificate.\n\n523\n00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.350\nThat is generated for Mike.\n\n524\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.400\nSo, that certificate is working right now,\nand\n\n525\n00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:36.440\nthe problem with that is that certificates\ncan at some times get corrupted,\n\n526\n00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.000\nand so what we wanna do is we wanna\nactually back up that recovery key,\n\n527\n00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.360\nthat encryption key,\nis what we want to be able to do.\n\n528\n00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.470\nSo I'm gonna back up that key\nto that thumb drive that I had.\n\n529\n00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.830\nSo I'm gonna select the start and\ncontrol panel.\n\n530\n00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.960\nAnd inside the control panel,\nthe user accounts.\n\n531\n00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.250\nAnd then if I select user accounts again,\nnotice over here on the left hand side,\n\n532\n00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:04.170\nI'm not saying right hand side,\nmanage your file encryption certificates.\n\n533\n00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.800\nAnd if I select that, it's gonna say, hey,\nyour file encryption certificates and\n\n534\n00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.170\nit says what do you want to do?\n\n535\n00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.240\nAnd then I click next here, and\n\n536\n00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.080\nthis is the one that I just used to\nencrypt that file with Mike's account.\n\n537\n00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.670\nSo you can see here, it's issued to Mike,\n\n538\n00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:23.000\nit was issued by the domain controller\nthat we had a certificate for.\n\n539\n00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.340\nOh, look at that date.\n\n540\n00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.950\nGreat, this is wonderful.\n\n541\n00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.910\nAnd now, I'm going to save\nit is what I'm going to do.\n\n542\n00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.930\nI'm going to click next here.\n\n543\n00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:36.420\nAnd then I'm going to back it up to\nmy location of that thumb drive.\n\n544\n00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.850\nYou can save it to the same drive if you\nwant to, probably not the greatest idea in\n\n545\n00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.170\nthe world, but\nyou can save it there if you want to.\n\n546\n00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:50.370\nSo I'm just going to call it\nMike certificate and click save.\n\n547\n00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.070\nOh, oh it doesn't like.\n\n548\n00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.430\nOh, there we go.\n\n549\n00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.490\nActually, save it to the right one,\nhow's that?\n\n550\n00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.790\nSo Mike, let me not put a space in there.\n\n551\n00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:02.180\nClick save, and\nyou do want to protect it with a password.\n\n552\n00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.760\nJust in case, somebody else gets\na hold of that certificate,\n\n553\n00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.430\nmake sure you do put a password here,\nand then you can click next.\n\n554\n00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.200\nNow, this is not the only\nplace you can save it inside\n\n555\n00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.900\nof an active directory domain.\n\n556\n00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.780\nYou may actually choose to save\nit to the active directory itself\n\n557\n00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.420\nby backing up there but for\nus we're actually gonna do this.\n\n558\n00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.530\nWe're actually gonna use this of course\nfor all of the logical drives, and you\n\n559\n00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.450\ncan actually encrypt other files later,\nbut let's go ahead and do it cuz I don't\n\n560\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.570\nhave that many files that are actually\nencrypted, so I'm not so worried about it.\n\n561\n00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.990\nSo, once we have this key and\nit's saved and everything is fine.\n\n562\n00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.000\nThat is when we could actually\nend up with some type of,\n\n563\n00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000\nwell, corruption is what\ncould end up happening.\n\n564\n00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.130\nSo, everything is saved.\n\n565\n00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:42.740\nThat's what we want.\n\n566\n00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.970\nSo now, what if I go ahead and\ncorrupt that particular certificate?\n\n567\n00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.110\nI'm gonna create a Microsoft\nmanagement console, and\n\n568\n00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.880\nI'm gonna bring in\nthe certificate snap in.\n\n569\n00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.645\nSo, this is not something\nyou would do on purpose.\n\n570\n00:29:57.645 --> 00:30:00.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, yeah, hopefully not.\n\n571\n00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.500\nThis is not something\nyou would do on purpose.\n\n572\n00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.310\nBut what I'm trying to do is, I'm trying\nto indicate that there is a corruption.\n\n573\n00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.400\nOur sys certificate has gone missing.\n\n574\n00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.030\nSo if I could figure out a way to corrupt\nthe certificate, I probably could.\n\n575\n00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.611\nBut let's just delete it.\n\n576\n00:30:13.794 --> 00:30:15.809\nAll right, so\nif I delete that certificate, and\n\n577\n00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:18.360\nI'm not going to worry about saving it.\n\n578\n00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:18.860\nNo.\n\n579\n00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:24.610\nNow, what normally would happen,\nright, if a corruption happens is that\n\n580\n00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.390\nwe might actually not even notice\nit until the following day.\n\n581\n00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.760\nSo, I'm going to log off as Mike and\nthe reason why I'm doing that is,\n\n582\n00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.540\nnow that we've already used it, it's\ncached it inside of the ram at this point.\n\n583\n00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.850\nBut now, if I log off.\n\n584\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.750\nLet's see if I can log back in here,\nas Mike.\n\n585\n00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.485\n>> One, two, three, four.\n>> I'm trying.\n\n586\n00:30:41.485 --> 00:30:43.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> I told you, I'm trying.\n\n587\n00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.420\nI can't type.\n\n588\n00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:50.620\nSo, as we log back in,\nthat file should be accessible to Mike.\n\n589\n00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.530\nAnd Mike, is it gonna be accessible?\n\n590\n00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:53.840\n>> That's a good question Ronnie.\n\n591\n00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.770\n>> That is a good question.\n\n592\n00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:55.650\nLet's see.\n\n593\n00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.450\nSo now, should get in, nope, there it is.\n\n594\n00:30:58.450 --> 00:30:59.180\nAccess denied.\n\n595\n00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.020\nMike, you were denied\naccess to your own file.\n\n596\n00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.960\n>> It's my own file.\n\n597\n00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.680\n>> That is,\n\n598\n00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.805\nthat's pretty tough when you're actually\ndenied access to your own file.\n\n599\n00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:08.570\nCuz you don't know why you're\ndenied access to that file.\n\n600\n00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.690\nYou don't know if it actually got\ncorrupted or what else has happened.\n\n601\n00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.410\nBut that's usually a good indication\nthat something has happened\n\n602\n00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.290\nto where now your certificate\nis not accessible anymore.\n\n603\n00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.490\nYou can go and trace it out and\n\n604\n00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.410\nsee if it's actually still there\ninside that personal folder.\n\n605\n00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.520\nBut, if it's not, what can you do?\n\n606\n00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.370\nWell, the good thing is, since you have a\nback up, you actually can import it right\n\n607\n00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.870\nback in, and that's what we're hoping for\nas long as you're not like me, and\n\n608\n00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.170\nyou would lose the actual\nUSB key at the same time.\n\n609\n00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:35.180\nSo, that's what we don't want.\n\n610\n00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.650\nBut here it is.\n\n611\n00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:37.720\nAnd all I have to do now,\n\n612\n00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.580\nthere is my certificate,\nall I have to do is select that.\n\n613\n00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.570\nAnd there it is,\nwelcome to the import certificate wizard.\n\n614\n00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:44.790\nAnd click next.\n\n615\n00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:49.380\nAnd she shows the location and I need to\nmake sure I type in the correct password.\n\n616\n00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:52.380\nAnd click next.\n\n617\n00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.190\nI'm going to include all the properties.\n\n618\n00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.730\nAnd I can choose where to place it,\n\n619\n00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.840\nI'm going to let it automatically\nplace it wherever it wants to.\n\n620\n00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.120\nClick finish and\nnow the import is successful.\n\n621\n00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.780\nThe only way to verify that is to\ngo back to that documents folder.\n\n622\n00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.230\nAnd of course,\nbe able to open it up and there you go.\n\n623\n00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.790\nYou see it right there, Mike's File.\n\n624\n00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.960\nThat's encrypted.\n\n625\n00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.250\nHe can now gain access to it again.\n\n626\n00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.210\nYou do have to be careful.\n\n627\n00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:21.540\nIt's easy to think that these things\ndon't corrupt, but they can corrupt, and\n\n628\n00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:25.410\nyou can be in a world of trouble if\nyou don't have a backup to that.\n\n629\n00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.280\nA lot of times in enterprises though,\n\n630\n00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.840\nyou don't even want to do\nthis to your own computer.\n\n631\n00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.870\nYou want them to actually manage it for\nyou cuz of instances like this.\n\n632\n00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:34.780\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n633\n00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.640\nThat private key ends up getting\nstored in your user profile, and\n\n634\n00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.660\nwe know what can happen to that.\n\n635\n00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.290\nAs Ronnie said, it could become corrupt.\n\n636\n00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:42.593\nWe could delete the profile.\n\n637\n00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:44.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The hard drive fails,\n\n638\n00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.630\nyou have to reinstall\nthe operating system.\n\n639\n00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.230\nSo don't think those keys are safe,\nmake sure you're backing them up.\n\n640\n00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.050\nOtherwise, you will not\naccess those files again.\n\n641\n00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:56.140\n>> Right, and that's something we've\ngot to really pay attention to.\n\n642\n00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.950\nBest practices is to make sure\nthat those things are backed up.\n\n643\n00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:04.360\nAnd also we think about it, right, to not\nonly be able to back those things up but\n\n644\n00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.790\nalso if we're working on a laptop,\nuse the BitLocker to make sure that\n\n645\n00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:13.430\nour entire computers and our Windows 7\nis actually getting updated for us too.\n\n646\n00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.350\nWhy?\nCuz these are things that really do\n\n647\n00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.120\nmake our job easier.\n\n648\n00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.240\nInstead of wondering if something has\nactually happened, if we know that we're\n\n649\n00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.990\nactually securing it the way that we need\nto we're actually closing the loophole for\n\n650\n00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.000\npeople to get in, or for\nmalicious software to get in for\n\n651\n00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.280\nwhatever we actually need.\n\n652\n00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.410\nSo this is at least,\n\n653\n00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.810\npart of our job of making sure\nthat on every laptop we do this.\n\n654\n00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.240\nNow, the way that we'd do that is what\nwe'd probably use group policy instead,\n\n655\n00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.290\nto ensure that something like that happens\ninstead of just me manually going around\n\n656\n00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:43.870\nto every single laptop and setting all\nthis stuff but that's what you want to do.\n\n657\n00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:46.770\nAll right, Ronnie, well,\nthanks for that information.\n\n658\n00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:50.990\nAnother great episode here at ITProTV,\nbut that is gonna do it for this one.\n\n659\n00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.830\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n660\n00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:54.490\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n661\n00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:55.893\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n662\n00:33:55.893 -->

00:00:15.360\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.241\nWith me today is the famous Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:18.411\n[LAUGH] How you doing Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:19.506\n>> I am doing fine today.\n\n7\n00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:22.792\nToday is another day that we get to\ntalk about supporting Windows 7.\n\n8\n00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:25.230\nRemember that what we're trying to\ndo is not really prepare so much for\n\n9\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.000\nthe exam but try to take a look at\neveryday technical issues that we face\n\n10\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.440\nwhen we are supporting users inside\nof the corporate environment,\n\n11\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.840\ninside of the enterprise and\neven as home users a lot of times too.\n\n12\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.030\nBut, really more about that\nenterprise environment.\n\n13\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.030\nSome of the tools that we need to as well.\n\n14\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.370\nAnd so, today we're spending a little bit\nof time going back into the areas that\n\n15\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.790\nI feel most comfortable in,\nwhich is network troubleshooting, and\n\n16\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.030\nso, we do want to take some time and\nwalk through several of those tools.\n\n17\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.860\nAnd also just make sure that we understand\nsome of the orders and some of the things\n\n18\n00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.680\nthat we actually tend to follow, to make\nsure we're effective troubleshooters.\n\n19\n00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.519\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\nYou know,\n\n20\n00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:58.751\nnetworking is one of those things.\n\n21\n00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:01.610\nI love my computer, it's great,\nI can do all kinds of things on it.\n\n22\n00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.640\nBut if I can connect it to a network and\ntalk to other computers, and\n\n23\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.110\nthe world wide web,\nthat's even better, right?\n\n24\n00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.800\nThat's really what we want to do.\n\n25\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.180\nAnd when we're having trouble connecting\nto our home network, to that work network,\n\n26\n00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.540\nto the Internet,\nthat's when it can get frustrating.\n\n27\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.220\nBut with the help of Ronnie Wong here,\n\n28\n00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.610\nwe're gonna learn these troubleshooting\nmethodologies that we can use\n\n29\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.100\nto figure out what the problem is and\nprobably fix it.\n\n30\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.980\n>> Well yeah,\nwhen we start to take a look at it,\n\n31\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.170\nit's not just Ronnie Wong\nthat we follow this by.\n\n32\n00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.810\nBut a lot of times it's just\nthe very fact that you work for\n\n33\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.630\na company who's been effectively doing\nthe troubleshooting they've needed to.\n\n34\n00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.160\nAnd they tend to follow some\ntroubleshooting methodology.\n\n35\n00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.790\nAnd when we start talking about that,\nthey do it for a purpose and for a reason.\n\n36\n00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.740\nAnd this is something that\nwe've got to get used to,\n\n37\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.440\nif we're working in that scenario.\n\n38\n00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.790\nAnd the reason for it is,\nit's probably been effective in the past.\n\n39\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.910\nAnd what they don't want you doing as now,\n\n40\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.380\ntheir Windows 7 support technician is to\nsay, look I know a better way to do it.\n\n41\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.120\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n42\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.260\nYou may know it but their way is proven,\nit's actually repeatable, and\n\n43\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.540\nthey know that it works.\n\n44\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.460\nSo even though you might\nhave a better methodology,\n\n45\n00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.970\nthat you might want to introduce.\n\n46\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.030\nAt this point,\n\n47\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.360\nyou do want to follow their particular\nmethodology that they are going to follow.\n\n48\n00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.320\nNow, everybody has a way of\nactually doing troubleshooting.\n\n49\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.190\nAnd every time you talk to somebody else,\nthey're like, oh no, this is the way you\n\n50\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.540\nshould do that and you're like,\nwell this is the way I learned it.\n\n51\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.310\nI don't know if I should\ndeviate from that.\n\n52\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.448\nWell you actually see that depending\non whatever company you work for,\n\n53\n00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:23.181\nit may be very diverse, and it may not.\n\n54\n00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:27.488\nBut one of the skills we have to develop\nat the very beginning is what we call\n\n55\n00:02:27.488 --> 00:02:29.650\ndetermining the scope of the issue.\n\n56\n00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.570\nAnd when we start talking about that\na lot of the times, it is a little bit\n\n57\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.080\ndaunting to actually figure out how\nwidespread a network issue can go.\n\n58\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.350\nWell, remember that we have\nseveral different scopes, right?\n\n59\n00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.030\nThe very fact is it can be\nlimited to my computer and\n\n60\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.050\nthat would be awesome in an enterprise\nenvironment, it was limited to one user.\n\n61\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.670\nNot a lot of times is that\nalways going to be the issue but\n\n62\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.330\nit would be awesome if we could\ndetermine that right then.\n\n63\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.690\nBut sometimes Mike, it actually is,\nwell, beyond that one user right?\n\n64\n00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.660\n>> Yeah, but it's very important\nthat we determine that,\n\n65\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.770\nbecause that's gonna really guide us into\nour next phase of the troubleshooting.\n\n66\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.580\nIf you're looking at a machine and\nit's having problem\n\n67\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.520\nif it's just that one machine,\nyou can focus your efforts there, right?\n\n68\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.800\nYou can look at it, Ronnie's gonna talk\nabout all kinds of things, but like I say,\n\n69\n00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.930\nlook at the network adaptor, or the cable,\nor something wrong with that machine.\n\n70\n00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.570\nBut if the same problem is hitting three,\nor four, or five people in the office.\n\n71\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.910\nThat changes the scope right?\n\n72\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.840\nNow it's something that's affecting\neverybody in the office so\n\n73\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.910\nit's probably not an an individual\nmachine, now we're looking in like\n\n74\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.240\nserver closets and switches and\nrouters and things like that.\n\n75\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.810\nBut wait, what if it's that other\nbranch office over there too?\n\n76\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.540\nSo now I'm talking about\ntwo geographic locations,\n\n77\n00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.700\nthe problem is not gonna be\nthe network adaptor on this machine.\n\n78\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.010\nSo determining that scope is\nreally an important first step so\n\n79\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.810\nwe can figure out where our\ntroubleshooting needs to be done.\n\n80\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.300\n>> Isolating that issue\nis really what the idea\n\n81\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.530\nis when we talk about limiting that scope.\n\n82\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.840\nBecause if we just try to determine\njust from this one machine,\n\n83\n00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.340\noh no this one machine is fine and\nI walk away, and\n\n84\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.900\nnow all of a sudden it's actually\nissues in the entire office.\n\n85\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.700\nThen there's actually some other\nissue that we have to deal with.\n\n86\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.340\nSo remember that that's what we\nwant to be able to determine\n\n87\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.620\nwhen we start doing that.\n\n88\n00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.630\nNow when that starts happening,\nwell, what can you do?\n\n89\n00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.430\nYou can start off on\nan individual machine and\n\n90\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.180\nwhat Mike mentioned is very important for\nus, and\n\n91\n00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.130\nwe are trying to determine the scope and\nmay actually be at the very beginning.\n\n92\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.160\nYou try and figure out is there something\nwrong with that one single machine.\n\n93\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.370\nAnd when we do that,\n\n94\n00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.110\nespecially with networking, what we're now\nfocusing in on is the network adaptor.\n\n95\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.430\nSo, in other words, the physical adaptor\nthat's on that computer and connecting in.\n\n96\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.550\nAs well as the configuration that\ncan be done on that machine as well.\n\n97\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.990\nSo we do want to determine if both of\nthose are actually set up and ready to go.\n\n98\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.490\nwell the network adaptor is fairly easy to\ndetermine whether or not that's the issue.\n\n99\n00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.500\nAnd you can look at it in two ways, right?\n\n100\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.270\nThere's going to be a logical\nconfiguration on it, there's going\n\n101\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.100\nto be a physical way that the thing\nshould actually show us if it's working.\n\n102\n00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.750\nAnd I know this sounds like baby-steps.\n\n103\n00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.180\nBut one of the most overlooked\naspects of network troubleshooting\n\n104\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.270\nis just that physical component.\n\n105\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.700\nI can't tell you how many times\nI've done this over my career,\n\n106\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.530\nespecially early on in my career,\nis I've just walked over to a machine,\n\n107\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.660\ndid an IP config, and go,\noh, there's no IP address.\n\n108\n00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.900\nI wonder what's going on?\n\n109\n00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.120\nAnd it shows an APIPA address.\n\n110\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.480\nSo, my mind automatically goes,\nDHTP server.\n\n111\n00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.190\nSomething's wrong with DHTP.\n\n112\n00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.690\nAnd then I start to look around and\nI realize.\n\n113\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.450\nSay, wait a minute,\n\n114\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.590\neverybody else is not complaining\nabout not being able to connect.\n\n115\n00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.840\nSo, it's gotta be with this machine.\n\n116\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.170\nSo, I just sit there and I try and\ndo IP config release, IP config renew.\n\n117\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.350\nAnd I'm just sitting there.\n\n118\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.670\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n119\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.670\nAnd finally what I realize is,\nyou know, I forgot to check one thing.\n\n120\n00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.525\nIs the computer even\nplugged into the network?\n\n121\n00:05:44.525 --> 00:05:45.436\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it is,\n\n122\n00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:48.211\nyou might say,\noh Ronnie that's a simple rookie mistake.\n\n123\n00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:48.961\nAnd that's fine.\n\n124\n00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:52.930\nBut I've done it many times and\nthe reason why I don't check that, right?\n\n125\n00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.240\nIs, if you're like me,\n\n126\n00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.560\nyou trust that little tiny plastic tab\nthat goes into the network adapter.\n\n127\n00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.560\nYou go, why in the world would that\ntab ever fall off or break off?\n\n128\n00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.360\nNow, Mike, you've never had that\nsituation in which the tab just all\n\n129\n00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.840\nof a sudden it just disappears.\n\n130\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.660\nAnd now a cable just slips loose on you.\n\n131\n00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.335\n>> No, never.\n\n132\n00:06:11.335 --> 00:06:12.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I've come behind Ronnie and\n\n133\n00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.940\nfound some tabs missing and\nstuff like that.\n\n134\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.881\n>> Usually bent backwards.\n\n135\n00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:16.528\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n136\n00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:17.474\nIt's a very good point.\n\n137\n00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:21.475\nI was talking to somebody that works\non a help desk at a large company just\n\n138\n00:06:21.475 --> 00:06:24.360\nthe other day, and\nthey do phone support, right?\n\n139\n00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.210\nThese people from their branch\nremote offices are calling in and\n\n140\n00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.800\nthey're trying to figure out why this\nmachine wasn't syncing up successfully\n\n141\n00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.410\nwith the database at night and\nblah blah blah.\n\n142\n00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.458\nCouldn't remote into it.\n\n143\n00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:38.060\nAfter about 15-20 minutes I'm like,\nis that darn thing plugged in, and\n\n144\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.750\nthe network cable was unplugged.\n\n145\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.820\nRight so,\neven people that have experience,\n\n146\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.300\nthis is a problem that, as Ronny said,\nit's easy to overlook because you\n\n147\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.410\njust assume that that's not\ngoing to be the problem.\n\n148\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.090\nAnd that's your first big mistake.\n\n149\n00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.860\nIt is doing the assumption.\n\n150\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.090\n>> Yeah, that assumption is\nreally going to kill us because\n\n151\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.600\nall it took was something just\na little bit loose, right?\n\n152\n00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.180\nAnd I know I did this a couple of\ntimes before, where I said, all right.\n\n153\n00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.270\nI've got to fix this cable but I really\ndidn't want to take the time to fix it so\n\n154\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.642\nwhat do I do, I just put it back and\ngo don't kick the computer.\n\n155\n00:07:09.642 --> 00:07:11.598\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't move the computer, and\n\n156\n00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.850\nif you don't move it, it should stay\nin there and we should be fine.\n\n157\n00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.530\n>> Duct tape.\n\n158\n00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.450\n>> You know if I'd thought of it,\nthe smarter thing would have been to\n\n159\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.468\ntake the little piece of tape and\nactually tape it in there right then.\n\n160\n00:07:21.468 --> 00:07:23.310\nBut I didn't, I just kinda left it, and\n\n161\n00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.645\nit didn't take 20 minutes later before\ngravity has this weird effect on that.\n\n162\n00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:30.677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On that little plastic without that tab\n\n163\n00:07:30.677 --> 00:07:34.071\nlocking it in there, which it\nactually automatically pulls it out.\n\n164\n00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:36.001\nAnd then of course what did they do?\n\n165\n00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:39.300\nThey pressed the little tray that\nkicks the DVD player out and\n\n166\n00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.730\nit moves it a little more.\n\n167\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.945\nThey turn their chair,\nit bumps against the desk or,\n\n168\n00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:48.884\nthey push a drawer in on their desk and it\nmoves it, and that cable falls right out.\n\n169\n00:07:48.884 --> 00:07:51.128\nSo, what we wanna do is we wanna actually,\nkind of,\n\n170\n00:07:51.128 --> 00:07:53.017\nstart off with just something that simple.\n\n171\n00:07:53.017 --> 00:07:57.195\nAnd, I do this every time now because\nit's happened so often in my past.\n\n172\n00:07:57.195 --> 00:08:01.545\nNow, regardless of the machine, if they\ntell me that there's network connectivity,\n\n173\n00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:06.120\nI always check and verify that the cable\nis plugged in there and that it's working.\n\n174\n00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.610\nSo, this is as simple as\nactually looking at lights.\n\n175\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.140\nIf there are no lights that show up on the\nback of that computer, well, then I know\n\n176\n00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.960\nat that point, there might actually be an\nissue right there at that network adapter\n\n177\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.980\nor maybe somewhere else, but always\nbegin with the simplest things first.\n\n178\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.360\nCuz if not you're gonna find yourself\ntroubleshooting and then all of a sudden\n\n179\n00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.100\nsomeone like Mike comes along and\ngoes, Ronnie did you check the cable?\n\n180\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.070\nOh, no, I didn't.\n\n181\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.760\nI didn't check the cable at all,\nand then we just hear a click and\n\n182\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.210\nlike that fixed it.\n\n183\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.960\nAnd that's something that can\nbe really frustrating but\n\n184\n00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.370\nit is something that we\nhave to be able to do.\n\n185\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.290\nAnd that really can help us, at least at\nthe beginning, to determine that scope.\n\n186\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:47.050\nNow, once we're there, right, once we\nverify that we do have the cable in, well,\n\n187\n00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.500\nnow we can go to\nthe configuration side and\n\n188\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.496\nverify that everything else is actually\nworking the way that it needs to.\n\n189\n00:08:53.496 --> 00:08:57.530\nThat's when we do have to jump into\nour control panel and the network and\n\n190\n00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:01.150\nInternet connections here, and so let's\ntake a look at those settings as well.\n\n191\n00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.690\nRight?\n\n192\n00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.590\nSo, on my machine,\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n193\n00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.160\nHere it is, I'm running Windows 7,\nand I'm gonna click on start, and\n\n194\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.040\nof course control panel and\nthen inside of network and Internet.\n\n195\n00:09:13.305 --> 00:09:16.665\nAnd from there,\ngo into network ensuring center, and\n\n196\n00:09:16.665 --> 00:09:18.905\nthen I have access to\nthe local area connection.\n\n197\n00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:21.005\nThe great thing is that\nWindows 7 does provide for\n\n198\n00:09:21.005 --> 00:09:24.725\nus multiple ways,\nthat we can check for whether or\n\n199\n00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:28.825\nnot connectivity is happening and whether\nor not this is due to a Windows 7 issue.\n\n200\n00:09:28.825 --> 00:09:32.865\nSo, right here at the top is actually\na nice little one that's fairly graphical.\n\n201\n00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:34.720\nIt tells me here's my computer.\n\n202\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.690\nHere I am connected to the lab\nIT Pro TV network and notice,\n\n203\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.220\nit actually shows that I'm connected\nthroughout to the Internet.\n\n204\n00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.350\nWhich is a nice little way\nthat it can show me that.\n\n205\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.170\nNow, if I need to verify some other\ninformation which I do need to do cuz\n\n206\n00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.000\nif I don't, I could be connected but\n\n207\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.260\nthis might not actually be\nthe same network that I'm on.\n\n208\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.220\nI need to go and check out now of course\nmy IP configuration, and verify that I do\n\n209\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.670\nhave a valid IP address on that network\nand that everything is also working.\n\n210\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.190\nNow, we come to this point and\nwhat Microsoft really wants you to do and\n\n211\n00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.560\nWindows, especially\nbeginning with Windows 7,\n\n212\n00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.360\nis that they really don't want you\nas a technician, and I mean this.\n\n213\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.260\nThey really don't want you manually\ngoing in and checking stuff.\n\n214\n00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.780\nYou're probably saying, well, why?\n\n215\n00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.840\nWell, cuz it takes time from you to do\nother things that are really important,\n\n216\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.270\nwhat they really want you to do,\n\n217\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.120\nis use the trouble shooter\nthat's actually involved here.\n\n218\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.980\nSo, you can actually find the trouble\nshooter in a couple of ways.\n\n219\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.760\nIf we can full screen this for a moment,\n\n220\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.600\nI can show a couple of ways that\nwe can access this as well.\n\n221\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.100\nSo, I do have this link over here in\nthe center but over in the lower right\n\n222\n00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.520\nhand corner, I also have access,\nof course, to my network connection.\n\n223\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.820\nAnd so, from right there, what they expect\nyou to do as a technician is something\n\n224\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.100\nthat's fairly simple,\nwhich is just to right click on it, and\n\n225\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.860\nnoticed that I can actually\nselect troubleshoot problem.\n\n226\n00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.650\nNow, you might be saying,\nRonnie, why in the world,\n\n227\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.555\nif you're an experienced troubleshooter,\nwould you ever do this?\n\n228\n00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:56.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n229\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.650\nremember, that your support is actually,\nprobably, somebody calling you.\n\n230\n00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.080\nSo here it is, Mike's at his desk.\n\n231\n00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.904\nI'm joking, it's not gonna be Mike.\n\n232\n00:11:03.904 --> 00:11:04.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Here it is,\n\n233\n00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.030\nsomebody calls you up, and they're like,\nlook, my network connection's down.\n\n234\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.930\nAnd if you say, hey look, why don't\nyou verify that the cable's connected.\n\n235\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.960\nAnd they come back and tell you,\ncables connected that's fine, but\n\n236\n00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.410\nthen what you can do is tell them\nto right click on that icon and\n\n237\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:22.270\nselect that troubleshoot problem and\nonce you run that, that will go ahead and\n\n238\n00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:26.805\nthen now what they done is they actually\nhave something that walks through and\n\n239\n00:11:26.805 --> 00:11:28.900\ntries to lead them through issues.\n\n240\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.070\nAnd it's not that you have to get off\nthe phone with them, but you ask them to\n\n241\n00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.630\nrun through the problem here, and this\nmakes it consistent every single time.\n\n242\n00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.210\nRight?\n\n243\n00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.490\nSo, if I'm supporting ten users,\nif I'm supporting twenty users,\n\n244\n00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:45.160\nif I'm supporting you know a hundred\nusers, or a thousand users.\n\n245\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.780\nI may forget sometimes, even though,\nI think I remember everything,\n\n246\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.920\nI may forget and go oh yeah, I need you\nto do this too, or I may have to go look,\n\n247\n00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.440\nit's so frustrating.\n\n248\n00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.390\nI'll just come down there and\nthat's probably something I can do but\n\n249\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.850\nremember that takes away time and\nwe actually need to be more efficient.\n\n250\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:04.100\nSo, this troubleshooter right here,\nshould allow you to walk through and\n\n251\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.530\ntry and allow them to go through that.\n\n252\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.470\nAnd so this is, of course, the recommended\nmethod for Microsoft, right?\n\n253\n00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.320\nVerify that you are physically\nconnected to the network.\n\n254\n00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.400\nAnd then from that point,\n\n255\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.220\ntake a look at what particular type\nof problem that you're having.\n\n256\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.360\nAre you trying to reach a website or\na folder on the network or somewhere?\n\n257\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.670\nOr are you having a different problem?\n\n258\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.270\nSo, if I select I'm having\na different problem, now,\n\n259\n00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.790\nnotice that you have several examples\nof what you can take a look at.\n\n260\n00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.930\nAllow other computers\nto connect to this one.\n\n261\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.650\nConnect it to workplace\nusing direct access.\n\n262\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.690\nAnd then,\nuse a specific network adapter as well.\n\n263\n00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.870\nSo, you can actually choose\nall of those options.\n\n264\n00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.150\nAnd a lot of times,\n\n265\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.580\nwhat will end up happening if this\nis a network configuration issue,\n\n266\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.490\nit will run through and it will actually\ndo the only thing it really can do.\n\n267\n00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.900\nAnd the only thing it\nreally can do is say, look.\n\n268\n00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.390\nI think it is a configuration issue,\nso let me do this.\n\n269\n00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.150\nLet me stop the network adapter,\ndisable it for a moment, and\n\n270\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.020\nthen let me turn it on and\nsee if it fixes the problem.\n\n271\n00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.280\nSo, you may see that if that\nactually ends up working, but\n\n272\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.500\nwhat if even after all\nthat it doesn't work.\n\n273\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.290\nWell, that's why you and\nI are still there.\n\n274\n00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:11.760\nSo, even though it gives us a chance\nto do that, they're trying to eliminate\n\n275\n00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.680\nus having to do a lot more support\nby just doing simple things and\n\n276\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.170\nallowing them to walk through it.\n\n277\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.430\nAnd then at the end of it, tell us,\ndid that fix the problem or not?\n\n278\n00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.600\nWell, if it did, then we can just\nsay well, thank you for calling and\n\n279\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.850\nthen we can hang up.\n\n280\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.030\nBut yeah, if it doesn't,\nthat's why we're on the phone.\n\n281\n00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.110\n>> Absolutely.\n\n282\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.590\nThe thing is, we wanna make sure\nthat our help desk is efficient.\n\n283\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.140\nAnd, if we can eliminate some of\nthe most common problems, the very\n\n284\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.830\neasy to fix problems from ever making it\nto the help desk, that's fantastic, right?\n\n285\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.110\nI mean, this is something that,\nafter a few times,\n\n286\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.190\nI can actually train my users to do this\nfirst before they call the help desk.\n\n287\n00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.660\nAnd so, when they do call the help desk,\nI can say all right,\n\n288\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.655\nI know it's not a network cable unplugged,\nI can cross a few things off of my list.\n\n289\n00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:58.515\nIt's like I had a first tier that's\nalready gone through a few pages of\n\n290\n00:13:58.515 --> 00:14:01.705\nthe trouble shooting and\nnow it's being escalated up to me.\n\n291\n00:14:01.705 --> 00:14:03.085\nAnd that's fantastic.\n\n292\n00:14:03.085 --> 00:14:06.255\n>> It really is, cuz it does eliminate\na lot of the headache in the process,\n\n293\n00:14:06.255 --> 00:14:09.815\nwhich means look, if they can't do\nit by doing what that thing did,\n\n294\n00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:12.455\nthen you know it was an issue that they\nwere never gonna be able to take care of\n\n295\n00:14:12.455 --> 00:14:13.940\nat their desk anyways.\n\n296\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.850\nSo, this may actually involve you then,\n\n297\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.890\ngoing in and troubleshooting that element\nor whatever that element issue might be.\n\n298\n00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.600\nSo at this point what do we end up using?\n\n299\n00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.600\nWell, this is where we actually use\nthe tools that we know that we need,\n\n300\n00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.470\nand the tools that are relatively common\nwith just about every single person\n\n301\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.010\nthat's ever done any type\nof network troubleshooting.\n\n302\n00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.420\nSo when it begins, if they are having\nnetwork connectivity issues.\n\n303\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.690\nRemember, that it's normally able\nto be seen very easily, right?\n\n304\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.780\nIn the lower left hand corner of\nour screen, we'll normally see that\n\n305\n00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.500\nlittle icon and if it's actually\na real network connectivity issue,\n\n306\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.050\nyou will either see a little yellow\nmark on it or you'll see a red X on it.\n\n307\n00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.810\nSo the little yellow one, I think it's\na triangle with an exclamation point,\n\n308\n00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.020\nwhere it's actually just a yellow.\n\n309\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.030\nI can't remember,\nI always think about it, but\n\n310\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.070\nI don't ever remember\nwhich one it actually is.\n\n311\n00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:02.130\nBut that normally is something that\nnow requires you maybe to come in and\n\n312\n00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.750\ndo that and\nto figure out what that might mean.\n\n313\n00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.365\nSo at this point, right?\n\n314\n00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:08.335\nWell, what do we have to determine, well,\n\n315\n00:15:08.335 --> 00:15:11.445\nthe way that you're actually more\nexperienced than the regular end user, is\n\n316\n00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:15.045\nthat they know the way that they connect\nto the network is fairly simple right.\n\n317\n00:15:15.045 --> 00:15:16.955\nTheir computer is plugged\ninto the wall and\n\n318\n00:15:16.955 --> 00:15:18.835\nthat allows them to\nconnect to the Internet.\n\n319\n00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.175\nBut that is about their scope\n\n320\n00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:25.870\nof the extent of all their knowledge\nof networking a lot of times.\n\n321\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.060\nSo, what do you and I know then,\n\n322\n00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.410\nas far as being technicians go, what do\nwe know about network trouble shooting?\n\n323\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.530\nWell, we know the only way that this\nmachine is now able to connect out there,\n\n324\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.470\nis it has to have certain pieces of\ninformation on it to actually work.\n\n325\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.510\nAnd it has to be not only\ncertain pieces of information,\n\n326\n00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.590\nit has to be the right\ninformation as well.\n\n327\n00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.400\nSo, that is what you and\nI may have to verify.\n\n328\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.865\nAnd so, when we start talking about that,\nwhat are we normally talking about?\n\n329\n00:15:52.865 --> 00:15:56.999\nIP address, the correct subnet mask,\ndefault gateway.\n\n330\n00:15:56.999 --> 00:16:01.410\nA lot of times that's also an issue and\neven today, especially today.\n\n331\n00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.917\nThe correct DNS servers as well.\n\n332\n00:16:03.917 --> 00:16:07.175\nSo making sure that we all\nhave that information and\n\n333\n00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.477\nit's actually the right\ninformation is also key.\n\n334\n00:16:10.477 --> 00:16:13.130\nOne of the things that we end up\nfacing a lot of times is that,\n\n335\n00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.560\nlook, here it is,\nI know it's not working but do I do next?\n\n336\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.230\nWell, this is where we actually begin to\ntake a look at what can happen next here.\n\n337\n00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.540\nSo I need to determine what my\nIP address is, and whether or\n\n338\n00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.500\nnot all that information is correct.\n\n339\n00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.520\nSo that, of course, means that you\nknow what your network's IP range is.\n\n340\n00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.910\nYou know the information such as your\ndefault gateway, subnet mask and\n\n341\n00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.260\nall that information.\n\n342\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.850\nSo we want to determine that, too.\n\n343\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.490\nWell, right here from the Network and\nSharing Center,\n\n344\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:46.290\nwe can determine that by simply looking\nat the network adapter properties.\n\n345\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.750\nSo, in here, of course, there's\nmultiple ways you can get access to it.\n\n346\n00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.450\nI have a local area connection right here.\n\n347\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.550\nI can go to change\nadapter settings as well.\n\n348\n00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.950\nAnd then, here it is.\n\n349\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.380\nI know what my network is, and\nif everything is set up you'll also see,\n\n350\n00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.890\nit will give you the name\nof your network as well.\n\n351\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.539\nIf I right-click on that,\nI can go to status.\n\n352\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.078\nAnd it is here that I\nwill see under Details,\n\n353\n00:17:10.078 --> 00:17:14.684\nthat is this actually my\ncorrect IP address, my network,\n\n354\n00:17:14.684 --> 00:17:19.961\nsubnet mask, as well as the default\ngateway, DHCP server, DNS.\n\n355\n00:17:19.961 --> 00:17:24.470\nAnd I'm starting to see all of my IP\nconfiguration information right here on\n\n356\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.930\nthis one page that I'm seeing.\n\n357\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.960\nAnd this is really good\nbecause it really does,\n\n358\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.950\nit helps to determine that fairly easily\nand quickly for me if I'm looking for it.\n\n359\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.130\nNow even though this is one\nway you can get to it, for\n\n360\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.080\nme, the normal way that I get\nto it is fairly simple instead.\n\n361\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.790\nI always to go to Start and\n\n362\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:46.260\nI type in my command prompt,\nmy cmd, Charlie, Mike, Delta.\n\n363\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:52.280\nAnd when I do that,\nthen I can just run IPconfig/all.\n\n364\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.710\nAnd when I do that, that actually gives\nme pretty much the same information\n\n365\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.740\nthat I saw on the status page,\nwhich is all of my IP configuration.\n\n366\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.790\nAnd it's here that we need to verify\npretty much the same information.\n\n367\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.640\nLet me see if I can mark that here.\n\n368\n00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.390\nAnd that way we can see pretty\nmuch the kind of basics that we're\n\n369\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.910\nactually looking for\nright at the beginning.\n\n370\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.330\nIs this IP address an IP\naddress on my network?\n\n371\n00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.000\nNow that's also gonna be a key for\n\n372\n00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.460\nus even though we don't tend to focus in\non it at the troubleshooting side level.\n\n373\n00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.940\nA lot of times because we actually think\nthis belongs to the system administrator.\n\n374\n00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.660\nRunning that subnet mask is tricky, right?\n\n375\n00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.108\nIf that subnet mask is not the same\nas what you're expecting to see,\n\n376\n00:18:33.108 --> 00:18:35.480\nthat means you're on a different network.\n\n377\n00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:41.030\nEven though you go, wait,\nI am on the 172.16.92 network, okay?\n\n378\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.630\nSo is that actually in my network, or not?\n\n379\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.120\nWell, if I don't know I have to actually\nbe able to determine that sometimes.\n\n380\n00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.430\nSo it may be that you do just have to at\nleast make sure that this matches up to\n\n381\n00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.050\nwhat you're expecting to see and,\nof course, this matches up as well.\n\n382\n00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.520\nThat subnet mask thing\ncan be tricky at times.\n\n383\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.900\n>> Yeah, just takes one fat finger.\n\n384\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.920\nIf somebody's manually\nentered that information in,\n\n385\n00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.470\nthey've statically entered\nthose IP addresses.\n\n386\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.280\nSo we've gone in and typed all that in.\n\n387\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.536\nA little slip of the finger and\nall of a sudden you're on a 255.255.254 or\n\n388\n00:19:10.536 --> 00:19:11.646\n252-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:19:11.646 --> 00:19:13.080\n>> And you're not really communicating\n\n390\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.666\nwith anybody.\n\n391\n00:19:13.666 --> 00:19:14.770\nBut everything else looks right.\n\n392\n00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.020\nYou've got blinky lights on your,\n\n393\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.420\nor you got a solid light\non your network connection.\n\n394\n00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.340\nYou know you've got a cable plugged in.\n\n395\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.500\nEverything else looks good.\n\n396\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.695\nWhy can't I talk to anybody?\n\n397\n00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:26.110\nCuz you're on a different network,\nyou're isolated all on your own.\n\n398\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.850\n>> Yeah, and it's real easy,\nright, just like Mike said.\n\n399\n00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.520\nSometimes, and\nI've had this happen to me before, too,\n\n400\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.290\nis that I know what's\nsupposed to be on my network.\n\n401\n00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.490\nNobody is supposed to set static\nIP addresses on workstations.\n\n402\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.420\nBut there are times, though,\nwhen I do go to a workstation and\n\n403\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.690\na static IP address has been set.\n\n404\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.660\nAnd you might be like,\nwhy would anybody do that?\n\n405\n00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.290\nWell, it may be that they were\ntroubleshooting on that machine\n\n406\n00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:53.080\njust like I was at some point, and\nthen I said, okay, I'm done, and\n\n407\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.910\nI just forget, and we log off.\n\n408\n00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.840\nAnd now that machine now\nhas a static IP address.\n\n409\n00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.530\nAnd now somebody says,\n\n410\n00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.760\nwell, I can't connect anymore to what\nI used to be able to connect to.\n\n411\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.590\nAnd I was like, okay,\nI don't know what's happening.\n\n412\n00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.113\nAnd I checked everything but\nthat static configuration, and\n\n413\n00:20:07.113 --> 00:20:10.379\nit's frustrating cuz you're looking at\nit like something else is happening.\n\n414\n00:20:10.379 --> 00:20:12.613\nSo you do wanna make sure that\nyou do check those out and\n\n415\n00:20:12.613 --> 00:20:15.180\nverify that that information\nis correct as well.\n\n416\n00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.390\nSo if all that is good,\n\n417\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:20.810\nthen you're perfectly fine with now\ngoing on to that next step, right?\n\n418\n00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.320\nSo if everything is fine\nin the way that we are,\n\n419\n00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.560\nwe know that we have a valid\nIP address from our network.\n\n420\n00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.685\nThe next thing is to test for\nbasic connectivity, and\n\n421\n00:20:28.685 --> 00:20:31.880\nthat's when we use kinda\na really unusual tool.\n\n422\n00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.960\nIt's an unusual tool that we use at all\nlevels of networking which is what we\n\n423\n00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960\ncall ping.\n\n424\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.630\nAnd ping is really a powerful tool when\nwe start taking a look at doing this.\n\n425\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.750\nWhen I first began my career in\nnetworking, I looked at ping,\n\n426\n00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.900\nI was like, what's the big deal?\n\n427\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.935\nIt sounds four packets out,\nand I get four packets back.\n\n428\n00:20:46.935 --> 00:20:51.797\nI don't see why this is so necessary, but\nI'm also used to working now with like\n\n429\n00:20:51.797 --> 00:20:56.154\ninter-networking equipment like\nrouters and setting up networks and\n\n430\n00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:58.080\ndoing all that stuff.\n\n431\n00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.220\nAnd still the same thing applies.\n\n432\n00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.990\nIf I set up 50 routers,\n\n433\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:06.820\nI wanna be able to ping all the way\nthrough all 50 of those routers.\n\n434\n00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.260\nWell, we still use that same utility\ncalled ping regardless of where we\n\n435\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:15.220\nare because it does verify that we have\nconnectivity along that entire path, and\n\n436\n00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.690\nthat's really what we want\nto be able to check for.\n\n437\n00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.090\nSo ping is one of more\nimportant utilities we have.\n\n438\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.626\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\nI mean,\n\n439\n00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:23.070\nyou've gotta have that\nelectrical connectivity.\n\n440\n00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.890\nNow that's what that's testing for you.\n\n441\n00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.200\nCan this packet make it from me,\n\n442\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.380\nfrom the source, to whatever my\ndestination is, and then back.\n\n443\n00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.560\nAnd that tells me a lot about\nthe problem we're having.\n\n444\n00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.310\nAnd there's several kind of steps\nthat we can go through with ping,\n\n445\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.440\nright, to determine again what\nthe scope of that problem is.\n\n446\n00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.510\n>> And that's what we really\nwant to understand, as well.\n\n447\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.840\nSo, just saying I can ping someplace\nis not enough because if we are having\n\n448\n00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.550\nsome issue going on, it could be\nintermittent, which is now gone,\n\n449\n00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.330\nwhich is what we hope for a lot of times.\n\n450\n00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.550\nBut it could be a permanent issue as well.\n\n451\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:59.947\nSo whenever we start talking about using\nping, we always ping from our device and\n\n452\n00:21:59.947 --> 00:22:02.159\nthen toward the outside of our network.\n\n453\n00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:07.670\nSo normally there is a step or\nmethodology that we use.\n\n454\n00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.750\nSo first, of course,\nis to just ping your own device.\n\n455\n00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.658\nAnd that proves that your own device\ncan send and receive traffic as well.\n\n456\n00:22:14.658 --> 00:22:18.940\nAnd even though it's only coming from you,\nit at least says that.\n\n457\n00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.280\nThen you wanna ping another\ndevice on your network.\n\n458\n00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.300\nThat proves you have network connectivity\nto other devices on your network\n\n459\n00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.280\nwhich is good because that normally means\nthat there's probably not an issue there.\n\n460\n00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.320\nAnd then that's when you wanna\nping your default gateway.\n\n461\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.860\nYour default gateway\nproves you have access\n\n462\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.650\nto the door outside of your network.\n\n463\n00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.120\nAnd if that door is closed,\nyou're not gonna get a response back.\n\n464\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.010\nSo, when you say, hey, I can't get access\nto a webpage and all of a sudden you can't\n\n465\n00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.300\nping that default gateway, that normally\nwould indicate a problem right there.\n\n466\n00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.500\nBut even if you can do after that,\n\n467\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.600\nyou wanna ping some device outside\nof your network somewhere else.\n\n468\n00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.840\nThe reason why is that now proves that you\nhave through and through connectivity,\n\n469\n00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.660\nall the way through your network, all\nthe way through to your default gateway,\n\n470\n00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.540\nall the way through to\nthe Internet connection.\n\n471\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.180\nAnd all that traffic is also\ncoming back to you as well.\n\n472\n00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.690\nAnd when you establish that,\nthat means connectivity,\n\n473\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.550\nmore than likely,\nI'm gonna say that 99% of the time,\n\n474\n00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:11.520\nif not 100% of the time,\nthe basic connectivity is not your issue.\n\n475\n00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.320\nSo it's not an issue with you saying,\nhey, there is something wrong here.\n\n476\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.460\nIt may be an issue some other place, such\nas an application not working for you.\n\n477\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.730\nYou're not able to connect to a website or\nsomething.\n\n478\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:26.710\nBut it's not because you are not connected\nto the network all the way through to that\n\n479\n00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.070\ndevice, and that's what ping\nreally helps us to determine.\n\n480\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.864\nAnd if we can use it effectively,\n\n481\n00:23:31.864 --> 00:23:35.014\nit will really save us a lot of\ntroubles in the future here.\n\n482\n00:23:35.014 --> 00:23:38.657\nBut those are two of the basic commands,\nIP config and ping,\n\n483\n00:23:38.657 --> 00:23:41.850\nprobably two of the commands\nthat I use daily.\n\n484\n00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.520\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n485\n00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.620\nYou use it all the time,\nany time you're troubleshooting a problem.\n\n486\n00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.960\nAnd I love it,\nbecause I open up my Command prompt.\n\n487\n00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.640\nI'm doing an IP config.\n\n488\n00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.739\nOnce I finish that, heck,\nI'm right there in the Command prompt.\n\n489\n00:23:52.739 --> 00:23:56.825\nNow, all I have to do is start using my\nping packets and I can work my way out.\n\n490\n00:23:56.825 --> 00:23:57.964\nLike Ronnie said,\n\n491\n00:23:57.964 --> 00:24:01.957\njust kinda work from the machine out\ntrying to see how far I can get.\n\n492\n00:24:01.957 --> 00:24:03.395\nCan I ping my own machine?\n\n493\n00:24:03.395 --> 00:24:05.138\nCan I ping my own network adapter?\n\n494\n00:24:05.138 --> 00:24:07.280\nCan I ping the local network?\n\n495\n00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.510\nCan I ping the remote network?\n\n496\n00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.400\nAnd that's it, right, and\n\n497\n00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.820\nthen we can start moving into some\nother trouble shooting steps.\n\n498\n00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.405\nBut testing that basic\nnetwork connectivity\n\n499\n00:24:16.405 --> 00:24:18.635\nis again determining what\nthe scope of the problem is.\n\n500\n00:24:18.635 --> 00:24:21.865\nIs it just the sub-net,\nis it just this machine, or is it maybe\n\n501\n00:24:21.865 --> 00:24:25.195\nthat server out there on the Internet is\nhaving a problem and nobody can get to it.\n\n502\n00:24:25.195 --> 00:24:29.975\n>> Sometimes, you also will encounter\nsomething else a little bit more unusual,\n\n503\n00:24:29.975 --> 00:24:33.025\nsuch as the use of what\nwe call proxies as well.\n\n504\n00:24:33.025 --> 00:24:33.675\nNow, remember,\n\n505\n00:24:33.675 --> 00:24:36.770\nthat we have a d phone gateway which\nallows us to ping outside of our network.\n\n506\n00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:40.790\nBut when we're using a proxy a lot of\ntimes what we may end up seeing though,\n\n507\n00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.220\nis that where our proxy ends up going,\nor our default gateway ends up being\n\n508\n00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.170\nis also that address of\nthe proxy machine sometimes too.\n\n509\n00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.300\nSo that way, it actually does\nall of the connections for us.\n\n510\n00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.770\nSo, when you take a look at your\ndefault gateway, and you're going,\n\n511\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.430\nwait a minute,\nthat's not the default gateway I remember.\n\n512\n00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.280\nAnd now, you actually see\nanother default gateway, or\n\n513\n00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.392\nwhat looks like another default gateway,\nbut you're still connecting out.\n\n514\n00:25:02.392 --> 00:25:05.015\nIt may be that there's\na proxy in between some\n\n515\n00:25:05.015 --> 00:25:06.975\nplace that you actually\nneed to get connected.\n\n516\n00:25:06.975 --> 00:25:08.885\nAs long as you're connected, you're fine.\n\n517\n00:25:08.885 --> 00:25:12.005\nBut, how do you know if there's a proxy in\nplace that may be something else you have\n\n518\n00:25:12.005 --> 00:25:13.075\nto troubleshoot?\n\n519\n00:25:13.075 --> 00:25:16.132\nWell, this one's actually\nmore in an unusual location\n\n520\n00:25:16.132 --> 00:25:17.352\nthan what we expect to find.\n\n521\n00:25:17.352 --> 00:25:18.682\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n522\n00:25:18.682 --> 00:25:23.622\ntake a look at where we tend to see\nproxies also show up on out networks too.\n\n523\n00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:29.302\nSo, it's not in the local normal area\nnetworking tools that we would find.\n\n524\n00:25:29.302 --> 00:25:33.442\nWe actually can find them under\nour Internet options, instead.\n\n525\n00:25:33.442 --> 00:25:38.160\nSo if I go ahead and do that, now we\ncan always go to our browser to do so.\n\n526\n00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:44.520\nAnd if I go to my control panel, and then\nI change my category view to large icons,\n\n527\n00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.150\nI can also end up seeing Internet\noptions and it's buried, of course,\n\n528\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.235\nunder our Internet properties.\n\n529\n00:25:51.235 --> 00:25:54.085\nWell, this actually does include\nall the properties, of course, for\n\n530\n00:25:54.085 --> 00:25:55.515\nyour machine as well.\n\n531\n00:25:55.515 --> 00:26:00.125\nAnd I can select connections and\nit's right down here at\n\n532\n00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:04.725\nthe bottom where we have LAN settings and\nthat's the one that we're looking for.\n\n533\n00:26:04.725 --> 00:26:08.985\nSo if I select LAN settings, and\nthen this is actually check marked and\n\n534\n00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:11.610\nthere is another IP address in here.\n\n535\n00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:15.140\nWell, more than likely this is what means\nthat there is a proxy in between you and\n\n536\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.500\nthe outside world.\n\n537\n00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.700\nAnd it's not necessarily a bad thing, but\n\n538\n00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.960\nit's another step that you can actually\ntroubleshoot if you need to verify.\n\n539\n00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.550\nNow, if you have the permission to do so,\nyou can actually uncheck it and\n\n540\n00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.830\nthen make sure you actually do put\nthe correct IP address in there.\n\n541\n00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.090\nBut if that’s greyed out,\nin other words you see it, and\n\n542\n00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.570\nit doesn’t allow you to uncheck that.\n\n543\n00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.440\nWell, that means, hey something could\nbe wrong with that one as well.\n\n544\n00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:41.140\nSo, you do wanna check your proxies\nif you do have them set up,\n\n545\n00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.030\ncuz it could be that the proxy’s down.\n\n546\n00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.570\nWe had that happen one time, where our\n\n547\n00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:49.320\nscuzzy controller on our proxy server\nthat we had set up, it actually died.\n\n548\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.150\nAnd so, after that [INAUDIBLE] now,\nlet's just forego the proxy,\n\n549\n00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.310\nwe're not actually even\nworried about it anymore.\n\n550\n00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.580\nBut if that happens, right?\n\n551\n00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.410\nNobody can actually connect out\ncuz everybody was pointing to that\n\n552\n00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.970\nproxy server and well now, there you go.\n\n553\n00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.590\nYou have another issue and\n\n554\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.760\nso there's another step along the path\nthat you may have to determine too.\n\n555\n00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.320\n>> And then we've got another tool we can\nuse from the command line that let's me\n\n556\n00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.070\nlook at some of these connections\nthat I've established right?\n\n557\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.100\n>> Right.\nSo,\n\n558\n00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.510\nwhen we start taking a look at\nsome of the different connections.\n\n559\n00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.710\nSome of the things maybe, you actually\nthink you're not connecting but\n\n560\n00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:22.460\nyou really are.\n\n561\n00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.950\nOr you're not sure if\nyou're connecting and\n\n562\n00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.800\nthis way you can actually tell whether or\nnot it's working.\n\n563\n00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.126\nAnd there is a tool that we\ncan use that we call net stat.\n\n564\n00:27:30.126 --> 00:27:32.040\nSo, let me show you a difference here.\n\n565\n00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.840\nSo right now, my machine,\nas far as I know,\n\n566\n00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.220\nI'm not connected to any other machine.\n\n567\n00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.320\nBut, let's take a look,\nI'm gonna launch my command prompt.\n\n568\n00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.620\nI'm gonna do an administrative\nmode just in case,\n\n569\n00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.770\nI don't know why it should be,\njust in case it's gonna ask me for it.\n\n570\n00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:48.490\nAnd I'm just gonna do a netstat -A.\n\n571\n00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.230\nAnd this actually shows me every\n\n572\n00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:56.300\ntype of connection that there is\nto my machine using my TCP IP.\n\n573\n00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.550\nAnd you can see over on the left hand side\nit shows your protocol which is TCP and\n\n574\n00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.580\nUDP, and everything says it's listening,\n\n575\n00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.690\nwhich means right now I do not have\nany network connections going on.\n\n576\n00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:10.410\nBut the listening says, \"I'm ready to make\nsome type of network connection.\" So,\n\n577\n00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.950\nif I simply take my browser now and\nI launch it up and\n\n578\n00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.110\nlet it go to its default webpage here.\n\n579\n00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.470\nSo there it is, it's on MSN something,\nwhatever it actually is, and\n\n580\n00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:24.150\nthis is fine cuz that thing\nconnects all over the planet.\n\n581\n00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.000\nBelieve it or not, that website has so\nmany different links to it.\n\n582\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.870\nBut I'm looking at it,\nmy machine looks so nice and calm.\n\n583\n00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.850\nI'm not doing anything right there.\n\n584\n00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.020\nAnd Mike, if I go ahead and\njust hit my up arrow one time, and\n\n585\n00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:40.450\nthis time when I hit it, all of a sudden\nit slowed down really hard at this point.\n\n586\n00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.210\nAnd now I'm starting to see,\nit looks like I have one connection.\n\n587\n00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:46.620\nIt says here it is,\nhere's my machine on this port number.\n\n588\n00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.670\nAnd it's established itself\nto this foreign address, and\n\n589\n00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.020\nthen it's established,\nand just hanging there.\n\n590\n00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.270\nThe reason why it's hanging there,\n\n591\n00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.620\nis now it's actually having to\nretrieve all the possible connections.\n\n592\n00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.420\nAnd wherever you see the word establish,\nthat means, this is an active connection\n\n593\n00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.255\nthat's happening right now, and notice\nthat by just going that one webpage, Mike.\n\n594\n00:29:05.255 --> 00:29:06.785\nLook at all these,\nthis is now starting to come in.\n\n595\n00:29:06.785 --> 00:29:09.805\nIt's coming in slow,\nsometimes it just kind of fills up\n\n596\n00:29:09.805 --> 00:29:12.135\nthe entire page really quickly,\nbut here it is.\n\n597\n00:29:12.135 --> 00:29:17.925\nNotice all of these different names and\neven some IP addresses in between.\n\n598\n00:29:17.925 --> 00:29:20.045\nSo, I'm seeing some that\nare actually just regular names, and\n\n599\n00:29:20.045 --> 00:29:25.080\nthen IP address as well and so, we can see\nwhat's actually being established right\n\n600\n00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.870\nhere to be able to help us out.\n\n601\n00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:31.250\nNow at this point,\nI know it's cuz of my web browser but\n\n602\n00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:35.100\nI can also use different\noptions with this command.\n\n603\n00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.680\nSo if I do netstat -a,\n\n604\n00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:43.810\nokay, and then I do a -n to actually\nhelp me determine the names,\n\n605\n00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:49.350\nI can even do a -o to determine\nthe process ID as well.\n\n606\n00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.550\nAnd the reason why I want to do that,\n\n607\n00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:53.980\nis that I might want to go ahead and\nturn off a process, too.\n\n608\n00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:59.030\nSo, if I scroll back up after hitting\nthe enter there, so, this is what it does.\n\n609\n00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.780\nSo, before we were just seeing the\nprotocol, local address, foreign address,\n\n610\n00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.910\nand the state.\n\n611\n00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.640\nThis time,\nI now have a process ID and now,\n\n612\n00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.400\nI can see the actual IP addresses and\nnot a lot of names there.\n\n613\n00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.280\nInstead, ooh I'm even getting\nsome IP version six stuff from,\n\n614\n00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.170\nwell, my network adapter someway, somehow\nis also showing that nothing is connected.\n\n615\n00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.980\nBut the process ID over here matches\nup to, well, different things.\n\n616\n00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:28.240\nSo, 1700 here may actually\nmatch up to a name somewhere.\n\n617\n00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:35.710\nSo, if I take that 1700,\nI can then go to netstat -b, I believe.\n\n618\n00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.180\nAnd this will actually now go ahead and\nparse the name for me, and\n\n619\n00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.820\nalso display that name\nof what we can also see.\n\n620\n00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.470\nAnd I should have also done that with\nthat number, which I forgot to do.\n\n621\n00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.150\nLet's see if it actually will\nlet me do that with the number.\n\n622\n00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.610\nHere.\nAnd, that way we'll get the process ID and\n\n623\n00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.410\nthe name and\nthat way we can link that thing up.\n\n624\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.730\nAnd then, I can determine, and there it\nis, 1700 actually equals my I explorer,\n\n625\n00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.900\nwhich is Internet Explorer, and allows me\nto see what's connected, from that point,\n\n626\n00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.030\nI can either issue a command to kill it,\nor I can open up my task manager,\n\n627\n00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:10.770\nfind that process ID number, or\nI explore and turn that off if I want to.\n\n628\n00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:14.505\nSo, it's very effective to help us\nto determine what is connecting,\n\n629\n00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:15.505\nand what isn't.\n\n630\n00:31:15.505 --> 00:31:18.015\nIf you think that somebody's connecting\nto your machine you can probably\n\n631\n00:31:18.015 --> 00:31:19.205\nsee it right there.\n\n632\n00:31:19.205 --> 00:31:19.795\n>> Very good yeah.\n\n633\n00:31:19.795 --> 00:31:23.600\nThat's very important to able to use\nthis when we're troubleshooting malware.\n\n634\n00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.145\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As another common one that we\n\n635\n00:31:25.145 --> 00:31:28.635\nuse that for, maybe your machine's\nrunning slow, we got connectivity but\n\n636\n00:31:28.635 --> 00:31:32.605\nreally slow connectivity and\nas Ronnie just showed you now I can see\n\n637\n00:31:32.605 --> 00:31:34.215\nall the things that\nare connected to my machine and\n\n638\n00:31:34.215 --> 00:31:37.640\nmaybe I find something that shouldn't\nbe connected to my machine.\n\n639\n00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.360\nAnd it's taking up a lot\nof my bandwidth and\n\n640\n00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.400\nmaking my browsing experience\na little bit slower.\n\n641\n00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.740\nAnother thing that we can try to do,\nRonnie, again, through the command prompt,\n\n642\n00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.720\nour favorite little area,\nis we can map network drives.\n\n643\n00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.320\n>> We really can and\nthis can be important for your network.\n\n644\n00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.058\nAnd also in terms of\nnetwork troubleshooting.\n\n645\n00:31:56.058 --> 00:31:59.386\nThere are some times, where all\nof a sudden we realize something,\n\n646\n00:31:59.386 --> 00:32:01.655\nthat my machine is hosed\nup to the nth degree.\n\n647\n00:32:01.655 --> 00:32:05.187\nWhen I say to the Nth degree, let's\njust say it actually keeps rebooting,\n\n648\n00:32:05.187 --> 00:32:06.460\nno matter what I do.\n\n649\n00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.150\nI try and log on, it reboots.\n\n650\n00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:10.590\nI try and restart, it continues to reboot.\n\n651\n00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.890\nI try and get on Safe Mode, it reboots.\n\n652\n00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:15.296\nWell, what can you do at that point?\n\n653\n00:32:15.296 --> 00:32:18.663\nWell, there is way that you can\nuse the installation disk for\n\n654\n00:32:18.663 --> 00:32:22.095\nWindows 7 to boot up to and\nactually enter into a repair mode so\n\n655\n00:32:22.095 --> 00:32:26.535\nthat what it brings you to is something\nthat looks like the command prompt here.\n\n656\n00:32:26.535 --> 00:32:28.705\nYou might be wondering,\nwell why does that help me?\n\n657\n00:32:28.705 --> 00:32:31.265\nWell, there's some built in\ntroubleshooting tools there.\n\n658\n00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:35.190\nBut what if I know that from that point,\nI need to get access to some\n\n659\n00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.200\nnetwork troubleshooting tools, that I have\nstored up on some file share somewhere.\n\n660\n00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.930\nWell, the way that you can do that\nis by using what we call net use,\n\n661\n00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.840\nto just map the network\ndrive back to that computer.\n\n662\n00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.910\nSo let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n663\n00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:51.860\nSo let's say for an example that what\nI don't have access to right away.\n\n664\n00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.000\nIs I don't have the installation disk, but\n\n665\n00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.170\nwhat I did have was a Window's PE disk,\nokay?\n\n666\n00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:00.173\nThat Windows PE disk, the pre-execution\nenvironment, preinstallation environment,\n\n667\n00:33:00.173 --> 00:33:01.890\nI don't remember which one\nit actually stands for.\n\n668\n00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.010\nI think it stands for\npre-execution environment.\n\n669\n00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.510\nWhen you have that PE disk,\nit allows you to boot up and\n\n670\n00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.440\nif you have networking tools is there.\n\n671\n00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.820\nBut at least you're on that machine and\nyou're now at a command prompt and\n\n672\n00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.780\nyou can gain access to the hard drive.\n\n673\n00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.910\nBut what if I needed to gain access, well,\nlet's say to installation media instead.\n\n674\n00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:23.190\nWell from here,\nI can actually use my net space use.\n\n675\n00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:26.936\nAnd this is where it gets a little bit,\nI don't wanna say tricky, but,\n\n676\n00:33:26.936 --> 00:33:30.191\nyou need the actual drive that\nyou're gonna connect this to.\n\n677\n00:33:30.191 --> 00:33:32.927\nSo what we're doing is we're actually\ngonna say we're mapping a network\n\n678\n00:33:32.927 --> 00:33:33.551\ndrive, right?\n\n679\n00:33:33.551 --> 00:33:37.204\nWe're gonna actually say the drive letter\nX is gonna be mapped to a foreign or\n\n680\n00:33:37.204 --> 00:33:39.980\na different location,\nremote location here.\n\n681\n00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.660\nSo it's gonna be \\\\, and\nthen I have dc01\\ and\n\n682\n00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:46.990\nI'm gonna say data and\nthen I'm gonna press Enter.\n\n683\n00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:48.450\nAnd that mapped it successfully.\n\n684\n00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.180\nSometimes, it will ask you of course for\n\n685\n00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.060\nnetwork credentials if\nyou're on a network.\n\n686\n00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.160\nSo make sure you can\nprovide those as well.\n\n687\n00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.080\nBut from this point I can\ngo to drive letter X and\n\n688\n00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.390\nthen when I take a look at it,\nthere we go.\n\n689\n00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.800\nThere is my setup file and\nso if I'm actually inside of\n\n690\n00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.240\nthat pre-execution environment\nI can now run that setup.\n\n691\n00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.141\nAnd then in a moment here, let's see\nif it actually runs, there it goes.\n\n692\n00:34:11.141 --> 00:34:13.241\nNow this is actually not\nsomething I'm gonna do.\n\n693\n00:34:13.241 --> 00:34:17.670\nThis is for Windows 10 I think, but you\ncan see where you can actually do this.\n\n694\n00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.270\nMore than likely, on your network, right?\n\n695\n00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.880\nIf you're running Windows 7 there probably\nis gonna be your network source for\n\n696\n00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.760\nthese files where you can do that.\n\n697\n00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.990\nOr it may even give you the ability,\nof course, to go into well,\n\n698\n00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:31.410\nyour WDS, your deployment services.\n\n699\n00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:34.240\nInstead, that actually just go ahead and\nre-image that machine.\n\n700\n00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.350\nBut you can see where this\ncan be very effective.\n\n701\n00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:40.540\nAnd you can even do this if you only have\nyour troubleshooting tools let's say on\n\n702\n00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.210\nyour machine, or Mike said, oh no,\n\n703\n00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.450\nall you have to do is make\na network connection to mine.\n\n704\n00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:48.700\nI have all of those troubleshooting tools\nright there and just map it to that drive.\n\n705\n00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.800\nAnd then you can use it,\nreboot the machine once you're done and\n\n706\n00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.110\nyou'll be ready to go.\n\n707\n00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.100\nVery effective way to get access to a lot\nof resources without having to go and\n\n708\n00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.740\nfind every single piece\nof software out there.\n\n709\n00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.883\n>> That's great information Ronnie,\ngives me the ability to reach out and\n\n710\n00:35:01.883 --> 00:35:03.591\ntouch those network shares out there.\n\n711\n00:35:03.591 --> 00:35:04.871\nAnd make it persistent, right?\n\n712\n00:35:04.871 --> 00:35:08.869\nSo every time I open up File Explorer,\nI see those drive letters there or\n\n713\n00:35:08.869 --> 00:35:13.204\nwhen I'm writing commands at the command\nprompt, rather than having to type\n\n714\n00:35:13.204 --> 00:35:17.628\nthat UNC path every time cuz sometimes\nthose UNC paths can get chunky, right?\n\n715\n00:35:17.628 --> 00:35:22.410\nYou've got backslash, backslash, computer\nname, backslash, name of the share.\n\n716\n00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.050\nIt's a lot easier to type X colon.\n\n717\n00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:28.660\nSo sometimes it's actually quicker to\nmap the drive first and then you can use\n\n718\n00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:33.150\nthat letter in your subsequent commands\ninstead of the entire UNC path.\n\n719\n00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.930\n>> Great idea.\n\n720\n00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:35.680\n>> Very good information there, Ronnie.\n\n721\n00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.780\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen that's a lot of info helping you\n\n722\n00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.310\ntroubleshoot your Windows 7\nnetwork connectivity issues.\n\n723\n00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:43.590\nThanks again Ronnie, great show.\n\n724\n00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.720\nI hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n725\n00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.410\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n726\n00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:49.280\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n727\n00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.991\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n728\n00:35:50.991 --> 00:35:56.900\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

episode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:14.826\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:17.271\nWith me today is the famous Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:18.190\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.090\n>> I am doing fine.\n\n8\n00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.680\nIt's another great day to be\nright here in the studio,\n\n9\n00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.030\nas we continue on taking a look\nat supporting Windows 7.\n\n10\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.740\nTrying to make sure that, well,\nwhat you understand is what we\n\n11\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.540\nalso actually think about when\nwe're supporting Windows 7.\n\n12\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.260\nNow, this is not\nan exam-oriented type of show.\n\n13\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.020\nIt's more of our tech skill show that'll\nallow us to tell you some of the things\n\n14\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.780\nand show you some of the things that we\ntend to deal with in the enterprise as\n\n15\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.960\nwell, and\nthat's what we wanna jump into today.\n\n16\n00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.340\nNow, we're specifically\ntaking a look at now, well,\n\n17\n00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.260\nsome of the name resolution\nissues that we have to deal with.\n\n18\n00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.950\nIt's no longer an option,\neven though we may consider it an option,\n\n19\n00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.570\nlike, name resolution is optional.\n\n20\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.740\nBut just about everything that we do when\nwe connect somewhere, we're using names,\n\n21\n00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.110\nand that's actually so important,\n\n22\n00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.310\nespecially inside of something\nlike active directory.\n\n23\n00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.880\nIf you actually aren't inside\nan active directory enterprise,\n\n24\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.850\nyou no longer can just say,\nI don't think I'm gonna run DNS.\n\n25\n00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.670\nIt's just not going to work for me.\n\n26\n00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.430\nI don't like it, I don't want to run it.\n\n27\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.750\nToday, DNS is so integrated in, I think we\nhave to consider it essential, right Mike?\n\n28\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.490\n>> Well, absolutely, unless you want\nto do everything by IP address, right?\n\n29\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.460\n[LAUGH] And it's kind of like,\nI look at my phone,\n\n30\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.330\nI don't know my father's phone number,\nbut it's in my contacts.\n\n31\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880\nI can look him up and I can touch it,\n\n32\n00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.950\nand it knows his phone number and\nit can call him for me.\n\n33\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.660\nIt's the same thing when you\ngo to www.xyz.com, right?\n\n34\n00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.835\nYou don't know the IP\naddress of their Web server.\n\n35\n00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:39.775\nHeck, that IP address might change now and\nagain, but you can remember the name, and\n\n36\n00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:40.695\nthat's all you need.\n\n37\n00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:44.095\nYou type it in, and in the background,\nyour computer's working magic.\n\n38\n00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:45.395\nIt's not really magic.\n\n39\n00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:48.812\nRonny's gonna explain it for\nus to take the name you typed in and\n\n40\n00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:51.722\nturn it into an IP address\nthat it can use to connect.\n\n41\n00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:54.147\nThat's what name resolution is all about,\nand, as Ronnie said is,\n\n42\n00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:59.032\neverything we do, visiting websites,\nchecking your email, just\n\n43\n00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:04.322\nlogging into your computer when you get to\nwork, requires DNS, so it is everywhere.\n\n44\n00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:06.052\n>> Yeah, when we start taking\na look at name resolution,\n\n45\n00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:07.622\nMike makes a very good point.\n\n46\n00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:11.640\nIt allows us to network by using names,\nand that's really important.\n\n47\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.390\nAnd it's something that you don't think\nabout because it's happened for us so\n\n48\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.010\nnaturally over time that we take it for\ngranted, but there is a very complex and\n\n49\n00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.920\ninvolved system that really\nhelps us to make that work, and\n\n50\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.960\nit's out there on the Internet,\nit actually is inside our enterprise, and\n\n51\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.870\nit needs to be working well for\nus to actually\n\n52\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.700\ndo everything that we need to if we're\ngonna be networking using those names.\n\n53\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.250\nSo, what ends up happening then,\na lot of times, is fairly simple.\n\n54\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.310\nYou go to do a regular network task, and\nall the sudden something doesn't work\n\n55\n00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.050\nthe way it should, so\nlet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n56\n00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.240\nSo here it is.\nI'm on my Windows 7 machine,\n\n57\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.000\nand I can actually take a look,\n\n58\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.510\nlet's say I'm going to browse\nthe Internet here, so I'm opening it up.\n\n59\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.680\nI'm waiting for my homepage to kick in,\nand as I'm waiting for\n\n60\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.700\nmy homepage to kick in, it's starting\nto be very slow at this point.\n\n61\n00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.550\nSo all of a sudden I'm starting to go,\nhey, maybe something else is wrong here.\n\n62\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.520\nWell, let me go ahead and\ncheck, so I'm just going to do\n\n63\n00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.490\na little bit of troubleshooting\nusing my command line tools.\n\n64\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.080\nSo I'm simply going to run an ipconfig\nand, when I do so, that looks right.\n\n65\n00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.520\nSo now, let's say, all right,\nso that's actually good.\n\n66\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.309\nI'm gonna ping another\ndevice on my network here.\n\n67\n00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.886\nLet's see, 95.10.\n\n68\n00:03:23.886 --> 00:03:28.160\nSo I know that I can actually\nget around on my network.\n\n69\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.190\nI'm gonna ping my default gateway.\n\n70\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.030\nIt looks like I can get\nto my default gateway.\n\n71\n00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.120\nI'm gonna ping a server\nout there on the Internet.\n\n72\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.460\nIt looks like I'm getting\nall the way through, but,\n\n73\n00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.500\nat this point, my Web page though\ndoesn't look like it's coming up.\n\n74\n00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.680\nLet me see if maybe\nit's just that website.\n\n75\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.030\nSo if I tried just something\nlike www.microsoft.com,\n\n76\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.410\nand let's see if that works, so\nall of a sudden, here it is.\n\n77\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.010\nI'm still trying to connect.\n\n78\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.290\nIt seems like I'm actually having\nan issue, and this is where we might get\n\n79\n00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.100\nstumped if we're not really sure at\nthe very beginning of what to do here, but\n\n80\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.670\nI've showed you a couple of clues, right?\n\n81\n00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.840\nSo, what I just showed you\nis using my browser, right?\n\n82\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.620\nThe only thing I’ve typed into\nthe browser address bar is what?\n\n83\n00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.240\nNames.\nI’ve typed in names, and\n\n84\n00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.680\nthe only thing I’m getting is,\naddress is not valid, or\n\n85\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.890\nit’s not actually connecting,\nanything like that, but then,\n\n86\n00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.600\nwhen I open up the command prompt,\nthe only thing I typed in there\n\n87\n00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.980\nwhat were IP addresses, and all of those\nwere successful at that point, too.\n\n88\n00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.107\nSo now this should lead us to go, wait,\nsomething is wrong here, but what\n\n89\n00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:44.503\nis actually wrong is gonna be somewhere\nname resolution is not occurring, and\n\n90\n00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:47.914\nwhat we need to do is try to isolate and\nfigure this thing out.\n\n91\n00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:48.540\nAbsolutely.\n\n92\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.595\nIf you can ping like that last step that\nRonny did, pinging that server that he\n\n93\n00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:54.838\nknows that's out on the Internet, and\nreally, it's not so much that it's out on\n\n94\n00:04:54.838 --> 00:04:57.854\nthe Internet, it's on another network\nthan the one that he's on, right?\n\n95\n00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:02.122\nIt's a remote network, and, if you can do\nthat, then you know you've got electrical\n\n96\n00:05:02.122 --> 00:05:05.450\nconnectivity all the way out\nthere to that server and back.\n\n97\n00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.250\nBut when you type a name in your browser,\nit doesn't work,\n\n98\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.060\nthen it almost has to be name resolution.\n\n99\n00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.120\nIn fact, a step that I like to do, Ronnie,\nright here, is to ping something by name.\n\n100\n00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.800\n>> All right.\n\n101\n00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.830\n>> And it's kind of the same\nthing as opening up a browser and\n\n102\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.060\ntyping in a name because the first\nthing the computer's gonna have to do,\n\n103\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.430\nit can't ping a name, right?\n\n104\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.730\nComputers can only connect\nto IP addresses, so\n\n105\n00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.870\nit's going to turn the name into\nan IP address and ping that.\n\n106\n00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.970\nIf it can't turn the name\ninto an IP address,\n\n107\n00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.680\nI know name resolution\nis a likely candidate.\n\n108\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.879\n>> So either my machine,\noh, there it goes.\n\n109\n00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.904\nI was going to say, either my machine\nis actually really locked up here,\n\n110\n00:05:40.904 --> 00:05:43.347\nbut it said,\nPing request could not find host itpro.tv.\n\n111\n00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:45.959\nPlease check the name and try again.\n\n112\n00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:49.863\nSo now I'm actually getting a response\nback that saying, look, name is not\n\n113\n00:05:49.863 --> 00:05:54.230\nactually working with ping, so we're\nnot actually resolving the names here.\n\n114\n00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.020\nSo whether we're doing\nit by the browser or\n\n115\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.540\nby ping, we know there has got\nto be an issue with DNS, and so\n\n116\n00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.450\nthis is where have to be able to limit\nourselves and be able to say, all right,\n\n117\n00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.840\nlet me troubleshoot the components\nthat deal with DNS at this point.\n\n118\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.790\nSo when we start talking about DNS then,\non our own machines,\n\n119\n00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:19.030\nwe've got one place that we really have,\nand it's what we call our DNS cache.\n\n120\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.850\nSo remember that when we talk\nabout name resolution, right?\n\n121\n00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.211\nIf everything was working at\nsome point in time in the past,\n\n122\n00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:29.514\nthat meant that what happened is that\nwe were able to resolve the name, and,\n\n123\n00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.808\nwhen we did so on my own machine,\nit actually went ahead and\n\n124\n00:06:32.808 --> 00:06:37.520\ncached a copy of that name to that IP\naddress and stored it someplace, too.\n\n125\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.420\nNow, if I've rebooted the computer since\nthen, I may have lost that, and actually I\n\n126\n00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.230\ndid reboot the computer, so let's\ntake a look and see what we would do.\n\n127\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.870\nSo, I wanna verify that I do\nactually have an IP address in here,\n\n128\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.560\nthat I might be able\nto get a name as well.\n\n129\n00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.351\nSo I can actually run some ipconfig,\ndisplayDNS, and, when I do so,\n\n130\n00:06:57.351 --> 00:07:01.818\nthat is the worst feeling in the world,\nis now you take a look, and\n\n131\n00:07:01.818 --> 00:07:05.720\nit goes could not display\nthe DNS resolver cache.\n\n132\n00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.680\nAnd that is that RAM space that we're\ntalking about where all of these things\n\n133\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.510\nare cached.\n\n134\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.362\nWhen I type in a name,\nit's gonna resolve an IP address, so\n\n135\n00:07:12.362 --> 00:07:14.815\nthat way,\nnext time I do try to connect my browser,\n\n136\n00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:18.428\nI try to ping to it, it doesn't have to\ngo and ask a DNS server at that point.\n\n137\n00:07:18.428 --> 00:07:20.088\nIt actually just has to look here.\n\n138\n00:07:20.088 --> 00:07:21.841\nIf it's there then we're fine.\n\n139\n00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:26.842\nThe other thing that could also be\nhappening, even though it's less likely,\n\n140\n00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:29.820\nis the host file is also out there for\nus, too.\n\n141\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.080\nNow, if somebody else is playing with\nthe host file, then we have an issue,\n\n142\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.460\nbut you can go in there and\nactually check on that host file and\n\n143\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.750\nsee if anything is actually\na little bit unusual.\n\n144\n00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.986\nAnd when we take a look that,\n\n145\n00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:41.887\nlet's just verify that since we've\ngot a little bit of time here.\n\n146\n00:07:41.887 --> 00:07:47.498\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and click on\nthe Explorer and go to Computer and\n\n147\n00:07:47.498 --> 00:07:53.125\nLocal Disc C > Windows, and\nI'm gonna scroll down to System 32.\n\n148\n00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:57.101\nInside of System 32,\nthere is a folder called Drivers.\n\n149\n00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:59.993\nOn the side of drivers,\nthere's our etc folder, and\n\n150\n00:07:59.993 --> 00:08:03.560\nwhat we're looking for\nis this one that is called hosts.\n\n151\n00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.960\nNow, right-click, and try to open\nthat file, and use notepad to do so.\n\n152\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.700\nAnd then, it's gonna show me this,\nand it's a little bit small, and\n\n153\n00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.880\nwe change the font size for us just\na little bit so that we can see it.\n\n154\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.820\nAnd so, I take a look at it here.\n\n155\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.600\nAnd the way that this is marked up with\nthese pound signs at the beginning.\n\n156\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.558\nI should say hashtags, shouldn't I?\n\n157\n00:08:24.558 --> 00:08:27.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With the pound signs at the beginning,\n\n158\n00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.730\nthese are all commented out.\n\n159\n00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.710\nThat means they're not\nactually going to apply.\n\n160\n00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:35.110\nBut if I saw another listing after this,\nthen I might have an issue.\n\n161\n00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.515\nBut right now, it doesn't look like that\nI'm being affected by the host file.\n\n162\n00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:41.880\nMy resolver cash is empty and\nthat may be problematic at this point but\n\n163\n00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.770\nit's not causing the problem\nthat we're having.\n\n164\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.730\nEven if it was empty, if DNS was still\nworking on my network eventually it\n\n165\n00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:55.620\nshould actually go ahead and go to another\nlocation on my network which is gonna\n\n166\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.730\nbe my DNS server or the ones that\nmy computer is expecting to find.\n\n167\n00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:05.390\nSo now, I have to determine them at this\npoint, well, who are my DNS servers.\n\n168\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.540\nThen, I can start troubleshooting\nat that point, too.\n\n169\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.850\nSo let's go in and do that.\n\n170\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.426\nSo now I want to take a look look,\nI just do ipconfig.\n\n171\n00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:18.385\nOops, I'm gonna have to\nspell it correctly, don't I?\n\n172\n00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:22.045\nNow, when I take a look at just ipconfig,\nremember that this is a summary so\n\n173\n00:09:22.045 --> 00:09:24.935\nwe're not gonna find that\ninformation right here.\n\n174\n00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:30.545\nBut if I do my ipconfig\nwith the option of /all.\n\n175\n00:09:30.545 --> 00:09:33.310\nIt's here that I take a look, and\n\n176\n00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.870\nwhat I want to do is I wanna\ntake a look in my DNS servers.\n\n177\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.440\nAnd so, there it is,\nI have DNS servers listed.\n\n178\n00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.120\nNow, this is where we\ndo have to be careful.\n\n179\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.140\nIt's very easy to assume that these\nare your correct DNS servers.\n\n180\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.300\nAnd so,\nif you actually do think that, well,\n\n181\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.610\none of the things I can do is, what if\nthe DNS server's just unreachable, Mike?\n\n182\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.340\nCould that actually cause an issue for us?\n\n183\n00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.756\n>> Absolutely, cuz you're asking\nhim a question, you're saying, hey,\n\n184\n00:09:58.756 --> 00:10:01.023\nwhat's the IP address\nof this www.itpro.tv?\n\n185\n00:10:01.023 --> 00:10:04.170\nIf he doesn't respond, well,\nyour computer's just gonna sit there and\n\n186\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.150\nwait, or fail.\n\n187\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:10.423\n>> Yeah, so let's say that,\nby chance, our DNS server's named\n\n188\n00:10:10.423 --> 00:10:16.107\nsomething incredibly descriptive\nlike dns1.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n189\n00:10:16.107 --> 00:10:20.010\nWell, I'm not getting\nany response back here.\n\n190\n00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.870\nSo, or it's actually just taking a long\ntime doing it, whatever's happening here.\n\n191\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.480\nIt's just not coming back.\n\n192\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.730\nSo it could be one of two\nthings at this point.\n\n193\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.840\nThat machine might not actually exist,\n\n194\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.860\nwhich it looks like, I couldn't find\nthe host, so please check the name again.\n\n195\n00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.680\nBut I didn't get any reply back.\n\n196\n00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.520\nSo it's not that the machine's\nactually even saying,\n\n197\n00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.110\nlook, there's no response or, what is it?\n\n198\n00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.540\nThe request not sent, or-\n>> Request timed out.\n\n199\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.910\n>> Yeah, request timed out.\n\n200\n00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.530\nThis is actually just not even\nshowing up at this point.\n\n201\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.228\n>> And we really don't expect it too.\n\n202\n00:10:48.228 --> 00:10:51.270\nBecause we already tried to ping something\nelse by name and it's not working.\n\n203\n00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.990\nSo we know DNS is a problem.\n\n204\n00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.860\nSo pinging anything by name\nis just not gonna help us.\n\n205\n00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.770\n>> So let's try-\n>> Try to look, yeah.\n\n206\n00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.640\n>> IP address, and\nnow let's take a look again.\n\n207\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.110\nAnd this time I'm now saying,\n\n208\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.940\nhey look, I'm getting this destination\nhost unreachable at this point.\n\n209\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.150\nSo now, this is something a little\nbit more unusual, as well.\n\n210\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.630\nSo with the destination host unreachable,\nit's not the request is not there.\n\n211\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.190\nIs not actually unreachable and it's\nlike what in the world is going on here.\n\n212\n00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.580\nWell, there's a couple\nof things it could be.\n\n213\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.490\nIt could be a firewall issue at this\npoint where it's not responding.\n\n214\n00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.010\nIt could be other issues.\n\n215\n00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.200\nBut if I'm not even actually allowed at\nthat point I may have to actually forward\n\n216\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.770\nthis on to somebody else to try and\nfigure this out.\n\n217\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.670\nBut the problem I'm having\nis actually worse than that.\n\n218\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.240\nThese are not actually valid IP\naddresses on my network, and\n\n219\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.090\nthe reason why I said that\nis that they don't exist.\n\n220\n00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.480\nI know that at this point.\n\n221\n00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.910\nBut you do have to be careful.\n\n222\n00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.359\nIt's real easy just to\ntype an IP config up.\n\n223\n00:11:43.359 --> 00:11:47.950\nOh look DNS, or\nIP addresses appear next to DNS, big deal!\n\n224\n00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.520\nLooks good, close it out, and go.\n\n225\n00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.920\nAnd then, you're still troubleshooting.\n\n226\n00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.830\nAnd what you have to do is you need to\nactually know what your IP addresses\n\n227\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.710\nare at this point,\neven though we're talking about DNS.\n\n228\n00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.770\nYou do have to know what\nthe IP addresses are.\n\n229\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.360\nIf not, you'll overlook it and it could\njust be as simple as a wrong IP address.\n\n230\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.900\n>> Yeah.\nIt goes back to our\n\n231\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.070\nprevious episode where we're\ntroubleshooting TCP/IP.\n\n232\n00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.300\nAs a help desk technician,\n\n233\n00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.830\nthere's some things you need\nto know about your network.\n\n234\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.720\nIn order to effectively troubleshoot,\n\n235\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.930\nyou gotta know what your valid IP\naddresses are for your client machines.\n\n236\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.560\nWhat is a valid subnet mask for\nyour network?\n\n237\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.220\nWhat is your default gateway?\n\n238\n00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.310\nAnd what is the IP address\nof your DNS server?\n\n239\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.360\nSo when you do an IP config on those\nmachines that you’re troubleshooting,\n\n240\n00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.872\nyou’re not just looking at the numbers\nsaying, oh, I’m glad they’re filled in.\n\n241\n00:12:31.872 --> 00:12:33.260\nAnd [LAUGH] we've gotta do\na little more than that.\n\n242\n00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.280\nWe've gotta make sure\nthat they're correct.\n\n243\n00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.360\nAs Ronnie said, the right numbers,\nthat make all the difference.\n\n244\n00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.556\n>> They really do, and\nso at this point here,\n\n245\n00:12:40.556 --> 00:12:43.063\nI know that this is not\nthe correct IP addresses.\n\n246\n00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:45.893\nBut if I wasn't paying attention,\nwhat would end up\n\n247\n00:12:45.893 --> 00:12:49.701\nhappening is I would try to continue\nto troubleshoot something else.\n\n248\n00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:53.740\n>> [LAUGH] So even though it's a very\nsimple fix that we might have here,\n\n249\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.150\nthis is something we wanna check out.\n\n250\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.290\nSo you should take a look, and\na little bit of time here,\n\n251\n00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.280\nto verify that the information is correct,\nnot just that it's appearing.\n\n252\n00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.550\nSo let's go on and check out.\n\n253\n00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.260\nWhat in the world happen?\n\n254\n00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.390\nWell, this could be an issue\nwith DHCP at this point.\n\n255\n00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:14.000\nIt could be that I miss configured options\nand DHCP or somebody else miss configured\n\n256\n00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.870\noptions and now I got an IP address for\nmy DHCP server.\n\n257\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.130\nAnd the option of these DNS servers.\n\n258\n00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.320\nWell, that could be it.\n\n259\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.380\nAnd if that’s true,\nagain,` that’s where we’d have to go and\n\n260\n00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.270\ncheck out the scope on our DHCP server.\n\n261\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.380\nBut let’s go ahead and just make sure that\nit’s actually only effecting this machine.\n\n262\n00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.190\nSo remember that when we talked about\ntroubleshooting in a previous episode,\n\n263\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.360\nwe talked about trying\nto isolate the scope.\n\n264\n00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.960\nTrying to see who it effects.\n\n265\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.150\nWell, this is a great point for me to\nthen to go and find another machine on my\n\n266\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.930\nnetwork and run my ipconfig all and\nsee what the DNS servers are.\n\n267\n00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.850\nAnd see if anybody else is affected.\n\n268\n00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.682\nIf nobody is, that means I limit\nmyself to this one machine.\n\n269\n00:13:51.682 --> 00:13:54.850\nAnd so, let's say that,\nthat's what we've done.\n\n270\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.440\nAnd now what I need to\ndo is I need to go and\n\n271\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.790\ncheck how my DNS servers are actually\ngoing to be configured here.\n\n272\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.480\nSo let me go back and\nlet's make sure we do this right.\n\n273\n00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.200\nClick on Start, Control Panel, and\nin here I'm looking for Network and\n\n274\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.020\nSharing Center.\n\n275\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.620\nAnd then,\nI'm gonna select Change adapter settings.\n\n276\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.520\nAnd on my Local Area Connection, I'm gonna\nright-click, and go down to Properties.\n\n277\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.485\nAnd inside of my Local Area Properties,\nI'm gonna select the IP version 4, and\n\n278\n00:14:24.485 --> 00:14:26.290\nselect Properties again.\n\n279\n00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.085\nAnd this is something you probably won't\nnormally see happening, right Mike?\n\n280\n00:14:30.085 --> 00:14:32.090\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, there's a,\nlike, wait a second.\n\n281\n00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.685\nWhat did you do to that thing?\n\n282\n00:14:33.685 --> 00:14:34.782\n>> [LAUGH] I told you I broke it.\n\n283\n00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:36.980\n>> Yeah, you did.\n\n284\n00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.020\n>> So Mike is laughing because he's like,\nthis is the most ridiculous configuration\n\n285\n00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.880\nI've ever seen for\nan IP address, and it should be.\n\n286\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.620\nBecause we shouldn't see DHCP, and then\nsomebody saying, you wanna know something,\n\n287\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.730\nI'm gonna mainly map all of these DNS.\n\n288\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.200\nI'm not saying you can't, it can happen.\n\n289\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.563\n>> But, you know,\nmaybe some user, maybe a friend,\n\n290\n00:14:55.563 --> 00:14:58.547\na child of theirs have\ntold [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH].\n\n291\n00:14:58.547 --> 00:15:02.249\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One of their kids has told them,\n\n292\n00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:06.170\nhey mom, hey dad, if you use these\nDNS servers it'll be so much faster.\n\n293\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.870\nAnd so, not knowing what they're doing,\nthey come into work,\n\n294\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.840\nthey go to their machine.\n\n295\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.500\nAnd they try to type\nin settings like this.\n\n296\n00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.550\nAnd now all of a sudden they\nget no network connectivity.\n\n297\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.410\nAnd of course,\nwhen you're on that help desk call,\n\n298\n00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.220\nwell, has anything changed lately?\n\n299\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.630\nOh no, nothing,\nI haven't changed anything.\n\n300\n00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.322\nSo you might see a scenario like this.\n\n301\n00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:24.761\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Albeit it rare.\n\n302\n00:15:24.761 --> 00:15:26.264\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n303\n00:15:26.264 --> 00:15:28.280\nhopefully never is what you have.\n\n304\n00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.170\nSo yeah, usually you won't see this.\n\n305\n00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.240\nBut I do know that this\nis probably not normal.\n\n306\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.515\nSo at this point, one of the best things\nthat we can do to help us to troubleshoot,\n\n307\n00:15:37.515 --> 00:15:41.290\nMike, is to know what we\nshould have set correctly.\n\n308\n00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.260\nAnd so, I know that if I'm usually doing\nthis, I know that DHCP is normally\n\n309\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.150\nthe one that's also handing out\nthe option for the DNS servers.\n\n310\n00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.907\nWhich means if anybody can\nfigure this manually it was for\n\n311\n00:15:51.907 --> 00:15:54.101\na different purpose than\nwhat we need it for.\n\n312\n00:15:54.101 --> 00:15:56.551\nSo then what I can do\nis simply go ahead and\n\n313\n00:15:56.551 --> 00:16:00.601\nmark that instead to obtain DNS\nserver addresses automatically.\n\n314\n00:16:00.601 --> 00:16:03.812\nAnd click OK, and go ahead and\nclick Close there.\n\n315\n00:16:03.812 --> 00:16:07.830\nAnd then, I'm gonna select Status and\nsee if it's already taken place.\n\n316\n00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.530\nSo now if I check and\nI start taking a look,\n\n317\n00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:15.180\nnow I don't have any\nDNS servers right away.\n\n318\n00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.380\nSo I may still have an issue.\n\n319\n00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.751\nNow let's see what we can do.\n\n320\n00:16:18.751 --> 00:16:21.240\nI can then open up my\ncommand prompt again.\n\n321\n00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.510\nAnd now, I'm gonna do my ipconfig.\n\n322\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.660\nOops, I always forget the /all option,\nnot that we need it all the time here,\n\n323\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.230\nbut let's take a look.\n\n324\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:38.610\nAnd notice now, I actually do have\na DNS server address now appearing.\n\n325\n00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:39.890\nSo I didn't type this in.\n\n326\n00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.290\nWe saw it when I actually took away\nthe Static configuration of it and\n\n327\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.920\nnow I'm getting this DNS\nserver address back.\n\n328\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.490\nSo at this point we might be\nable to go ahead and do a ping.\n\n329\n00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:57.130\nAnd now we can do ping itpro,\noop, if I can spell it, .tv.\n\n330\n00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.850\nAnd look at that,\nI'm now getting name resolution happening\n\n331\n00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.330\nas well as getting\neverything working here.\n\n332\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.200\nIf I try and\n\n333\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.380\nping www, now this one normally\ndoesn't return anything sometimes.\n\n334\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.430\nActually, I'm surprised.\n\n335\n00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.290\nIt used to be Microsoft wouldn't return\nanything, but now Microsoft is saying,\n\n336\n00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.970\nyeah, sure, we'll play the game now.\n\n337\n00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.700\nAnd so we're pinging some akamiedge\nserver here, but that's fine.\n\n338\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.805\nBut Microsoft's name is\nactually responding.\n\n339\n00:17:21.805 --> 00:17:22.340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n340\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.980\nit may be a quick resolution with\nsomething like that, that could happen.\n\n341\n00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.490\nAnd then the command that we\nwere just taking a look at.\n\n342\n00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:35.530\nIf I wanna displaydns now,\nwe can now see, there it is.\n\n343\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.010\nThe DNS resolver cache\nis now filling in for\n\n344\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.280\nus and\nwe are actually starting to return names.\n\n345\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.880\nSo, it is working fairly well.\n\n346\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.410\n>> Very good, now, Ronnie,\nsometimes this could be the problem,\n\n347\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.270\nwe gotta troubleshoot our TCP/IP settings.\n\n348\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.720\nOther times though, we might be\nconnecting to that DHCP server and\n\n349\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.860\nmaybe he's passing out bad information,\nright?\n\n350\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.800\nMaybe somebody has updated\nthat DNS database.\n\n351\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.550\nWe're asking DNS,\nwhat's the IP address of www.itprotv?\n\n352\n00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:04.615\nWell what if the DNS server is responding,\nbut returning the wrong answer?\n\n353\n00:18:04.615 --> 00:18:07.065\nHow can we verify what\nthe DNS server is telling us?\n\n354\n00:18:07.065 --> 00:18:11.078\n>> Well, the way that we can do that is we\ncan actually go ahead and make a direct\n\n355\n00:18:11.078 --> 00:18:15.351\ncommunication to that DNS server by using\na simple command line utility for us,\n\n356\n00:18:15.351 --> 00:18:18.202\ncall MS, MS-\n>> [LAUGH] Microsoft nslookup, yeah.\n\n357\n00:18:18.202 --> 00:18:22.207\n>> Yeah, nslookup, so that's the one\nthat we wanna take a look at.\n\n358\n00:18:22.207 --> 00:18:23.727\nAnd there's two modes that we can see, so\n\n359\n00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:26.000\nlet's go ahead and take a look\nat that on my screen here, too.\n\n360\n00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.760\nSo if we are trying to determine what DNS\nservers we are also connecting to and\n\n361\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.950\nverifying the name resolution is\nhappening the way that we believe,\n\n362\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.210\nwe can do an nslookup.\n\n363\n00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.070\nAnd then I can do something like this.\n\n364\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.270\nSo I know that there is, let's see,\n\n365\n00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.090\nmy other machine that's on this network,\ndc01.\n\n366\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.360\nAnd so if I type that in,\nI'm getting a name resolution and\n\n367\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.180\nit's also telling me the name of\nthe DNS server that is responding.\n\n368\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.190\nSo it is actually this server that\nis gonna be authoritative for me.\n\n369\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.470\nAnd I am now getting this address that\ncomes back and I'm also getting, well,\n\n370\n00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.770\nthe return of what I was\nactually looking up here.\n\n371\n00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.940\nSo we can do this and this is, I think,\n\n372\n00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.610\nwhat they call a non-interactive\nmode if I remember correctly.\n\n373\n00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.300\nSo this is one way where we can do that.\n\n374\n00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.860\nAnd if I need a quick and\neasy answer, this is the way to go.\n\n375\n00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:22.230\nBut I can simply enter the utility,\nnslookup like this,\n\n376\n00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:27.900\nand then I can try and resolve other names\nthat are also possibly out there too.\n\n377\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.870\nSo at this point,\nlet me just do dc01 again,\n\n378\n00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.580\ncuz I can't remember the name of the other\ncomputer I had set up for this network.\n\n379\n00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.030\nBut you can see where we can also do this\nand continue to resolve different names,\n\n380\n00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.050\nso this one is I think is client1.\n\n381\n00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.800\nI think, I could be wrong.\n\n382\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.260\nNope, so this one is not client1.\n\n383\n00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.460\nIt's probably client01, or A, or whatever\nletter or number I actually gave to it.\n\n384\n00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.290\nSo, let me see, is that, yep,\nthat's better, client01.\n\n385\n00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.860\nSee, I always forget, so there it is.\n\n386\n00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.550\nI now have the name of that\nserver that's responding and\n\n387\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.390\ngiving me that information,\nand of course the return.\n\n388\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:04.169\nBut there are times though, let's say that\nwe go to Mike's favorite website here,\n\n389\n00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:06.642\nwww.mileycyr, I'm joking-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:20:06.642 --> 00:20:08.473\n>> cyrus.com.\n\n391\n00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:12.072\nI'm trying to pick one that's actually\nnot gonna show up in my name.\n\n392\n00:20:12.072 --> 00:20:17.890\nAnd now Mike, I get this weird one here\nthat says, non-authoritative answer.\n\n393\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:18.900\nWhat is that about?\n\n394\n00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.900\n>> Yeah, you're getting an answer from,\nDNS servers help each other out.\n\n395\n00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.870\nYour DNS server at your company knows\nhow to resolve all the names of all\n\n396\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.380\nthe computers that exist on\nyour network into IP addresses.\n\n397\n00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.730\nOther companies have their own DNS\nservers that know about all the names and\n\n398\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.540\nIP addresses on their network.\n\n399\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.164\nWell, what if I from my network wanna\ntalk to one of those computers on their\n\n400\n00:20:39.164 --> 00:20:41.301\nnetwork, like mileycyrus.com, right?\n\n401\n00:20:41.301 --> 00:20:42.462\nThat's a different network.\n\n402\n00:20:42.462 --> 00:20:44.558\n>> Yeah, it is.\n>> They've got a DNS [LAUGH] server that's\n\n403\n00:20:44.558 --> 00:20:46.710\nhandling all those names and IP addresses.\n\n404\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.890\nMy DNS server doesn't\nknow that information.\n\n405\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:53.750\nSo when I ask my DNS server for\nthe IP address of mileycyrus.com,\n\n406\n00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.350\nmy DNS server then has to turn around and\nask their DNS server.\n\n407\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.995\nSay hey, I don't know what\nthe heck he's talking about,\n\n408\n00:20:58.995 --> 00:21:00.450\nI've never been there before.\n\n409\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.890\nWhat is the IP address\nof this mileycyrus.com?\n\n410\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.750\nTheir DNS server gives\nthe answer to my DNS server.\n\n411\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.550\nMy DNS servers then\ngives the answer to me.\n\n412\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.740\nBut, from my point of view,\n\n413\n00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.660\nI'm not getting it from\nthe authoritative DNS server, right?\n\n414\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.365\nI never talked to Miley Cyrus' DNS server,\nmy DNS server gave me the information.\n\n415\n00:21:17.365 --> 00:21:22.150\nAnd it's like I told Ronnie, and\nthen Ronnie told Nate, right?\n\n416\n00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.090\nWell, Nate didn't get it from me,\nhe got it from Ronnie,\n\n417\n00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.660\neven though it originated from me, so that\nwould be a non-authoritative response.\n\n418\n00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.220\n>> And so this is very important because\nit does let you know whether or not your\n\n419\n00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.330\nmachine is able to answer somebody's\nrequest, or is it passing it off.\n\n420\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.800\nSo if you believe that it was\nsupposed to be from your machine, but\n\n421\n00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.600\nyou're actually getting it out here,\nthat's fine because it works.\n\n422\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.400\nBut if you were expecting\nto get it from machine,\n\n423\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.710\nthis can also help you\ntroubleshoot that as well.\n\n424\n00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.399\nSo it's really neat that what we\ncan do here is actually use that\n\n425\n00:21:49.399 --> 00:21:53.133\ninteractive mode, or the non-interactive,\nto get us those responses that we need.\n\n426\n00:21:53.133 --> 00:21:57.500\nTo tell us what machine's actually\nanswering when we actually do send out DNS\n\n427\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.460\nrequests, to be able to help us here.\n\n428\n00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.020\nVery much a nice little utilities for\n\n429\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.060\nus that we can actually use\nto troubleshoot here too.\n\n430\n00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:06.740\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n431\n00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.030\nThen the last thing we really need to\ntalk about, we've seen a couple times,\n\n432\n00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.300\nyou've done an ipconfig, and\nwe can tell that you're getting that IP,\n\n433\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.880\nthat you were statically mapping it,\nright?\n\n434\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.770\nYou were getting it from a DHCP server.\n\n435\n00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.600\nAnd sometimes that can cause a problem,\nor we can have problems with DHCP.\n\n436\n00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.470\n>> You really can.\n\n437\n00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.490\nWhat can end up happening, of course,\nis that the way that the nature that\n\n438\n00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.750\nDHCP works, and\nthis is why you do need to protect this.\n\n439\n00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.690\nIs let's say that you have\nDNS running on your network.\n\n440\n00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.710\nBut then, here it is,\nMike Roderick comes onto your network.\n\n441\n00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.130\nHe wants to set up a little test\nlab network on his own laptop.\n\n442\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.050\nAnd what he does is, he takes\na network adapter and he, of course,\n\n443\n00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.780\nmakes it connect to your regular network.\n\n444\n00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:50.150\nHe says, no big deal, I'm gonna set up\nDHCP only for what, my lab network, okay.\n\n445\n00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.690\nBut he's now got it\nconnected to your network.\n\n446\n00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.850\nAnd with DHCP servers, Mike,\n\n447\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.890\nthere's a very orderly way in\nwhich they do things, right?\n\n448\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.690\nWhen there's a single machine and\nit sees two DNS servers, it just says,\n\n449\n00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.740\nI would prefer this one over this one,\nright?\n\n450\n00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.950\nIs that what it does?\n\n451\n00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:06.695\n>> I don't think so [LAUGH].\n\n452\n00:23:06.695 --> 00:23:12.065\n>> Yeah, what we learn about DHCP\nis something which is weird,\n\n453\n00:23:12.065 --> 00:23:17.240\nit's the first one that responds,\nso DHCP is very rapid.\n\n454\n00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.850\nIt actually says look,\nI hit a request, I'm gonna respond.\n\n455\n00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.930\nWell, two machines,\ntwo DHCP machines could respond to it.\n\n456\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.830\nThe first one that responds\nis gonna be the one\n\n457\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.200\nthat that machine is going to listen to.\n\n458\n00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.270\nSo it's very possible that we can end up\nwith a rogue DHCP server on our network.\n\n459\n00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.100\nAnd it can actually take over our network.\n\n460\n00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.990\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwow did Mike really do that?\n\n461\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.540\nIt wasn't Mike, it was Ronnie.\n\n462\n00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.550\nI've done it, that's how I know.\n\n463\n00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.474\nOf all the things,\nthat is the one that I remember doing.\n\n464\n00:23:46.474 --> 00:23:48.913\nThere I was, I was typing away,\nI'd set everything up.\n\n465\n00:23:48.913 --> 00:23:52.045\nAnd all the sudden, somebody says, we're\nnot getting Internet connection anymore.\n\n466\n00:23:52.045 --> 00:23:52.746\nI'm went, what?!\n\n467\n00:23:52.746 --> 00:23:54.326\nAnd I said, I don't know what's going on.\n\n468\n00:23:54.326 --> 00:23:58.306\nThey said, well,\nwho in the world has woodgrovebank.com?\n\n469\n00:23:58.306 --> 00:24:00.546\nAnd I was like, Oh, my fault.\n\n470\n00:24:00.546 --> 00:24:03.126\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So then I realized what I had done.\n\n471\n00:24:03.126 --> 00:24:07.626\nAnd I have done that before, and so\nthere it was in the middle of the day,\n\n472\n00:24:07.626 --> 00:24:12.230\nI had literally kicked everybody off\njust by turning on the DHCP server.\n\n473\n00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.070\nSo you do have to be careful there.\n\n474\n00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:19.230\nBut sometimes setting up that DHCP\nserver can also be where you set up so\n\n475\n00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.170\nmany different options along with it,\nthat you could set it up incorrectly.\n\n476\n00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:27.130\nYou could actually set it up with\nthe wrong range of IP addresses, or\n\n477\n00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.250\nthe wrong subnet mask.\n\n478\n00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.880\nI've seen that one, where they just\nassumed it was actually the classical\n\n479\n00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.710\nsubnet mask and\nthey found out that it wasn't supposed be,\n\n480\n00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.830\nit was some other subnet\nmask it was supposed to be.\n\n481\n00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.540\nAnd even those options like DNS as well.\n\n482\n00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.488\nSo a lot of times if the DHCP\nserver isn't functioning,\n\n483\n00:24:42.488 --> 00:24:46.375\nremember you're gonna actually see it,\nor the scope of the servers, and\n\n484\n00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:48.275\neverything else that it's doing.\n\n485\n00:24:48.275 --> 00:24:51.311\nIf it's not functioning well you'll\nactually see it across multiple machines,\n\n486\n00:24:51.311 --> 00:24:53.830\nand that's where you're actually\ngonna see a difference.\n\n487\n00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.820\nThe one that I did right here,\nperfectly fine, and it actually works, but\n\n488\n00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.180\nsometimes you actually see\nit will happen differently.\n\n489\n00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.410\nSo let me go ahead and do this.\n\n490\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.060\nLet me disable, if I can,\nthe scope of this.\n\n491\n00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.920\nLet me deactivate this scope here.\n\n492\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.670\nOops.\n\n493\n00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.460\nNow let me see if I can deactivate it\nnow that I've timed it out apparently.\n\n494\n00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:16.970\nSo on this scope, let me go ahead and\ndeactivate the scope.\n\n495\n00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.290\nAnd that will work for us.\n\n496\n00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.070\nSo remember that when I do that\nI'm doing that pretty much for\n\n497\n00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:25.020\nthe entire network if I have\none DHCP server working.\n\n498\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:31.100\nSo now if I take my IP address and I\nrelease that IP address, I'm giving it up.\n\n499\n00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:36.000\nAnd now when I take a look at\nipconfig here in just a moment or\n\n500\n00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.200\nlet's see if it actually works here,\nipconfig.\n\n501\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.370\nWe'll try and give it a moment,\nthere it goes.\n\n502\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.610\nSo, we give it a moment.\n\n503\n00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.790\nNormally this is what you also will end up\nseeing, that will tell you that something\n\n504\n00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.980\nis wrong with DHCP or\nmy computer is just not connecting.\n\n505\n00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.540\nIf I have multiple people connecting here,\nand\n\n506\n00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.030\nthey're all getting 169.254 addresses,\nwell, I know something.\n\n507\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.730\nI can't troubleshoot every individual\ncomputer and fix the problem.\n\n508\n00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:07.290\nAll of those symptoms that we're getting,\nthe 169.254 across multiple machines,\n\n509\n00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.880\nindicates that the source of\nthe problem is somewhere else.\n\n510\n00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.312\n>> Yeah, again it goes back to determining\nwhat the scope of the problem is.\n\n511\n00:26:13.312 --> 00:26:16.550\nIf it's that one machine, that's where\nmy troubleshooting is gonna be focused.\n\n512\n00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.280\nIf half the machines on my network\nare giving up HIPAA addresses\n\n513\n00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.530\nthen it's very likely that it's\nconnectivity to the DHCP server, or\n\n514\n00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.190\nthe DHCP server itself is having trouble.\n\n515\n00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.660\n>> Yeah and that's where we have\nto then determine that, right?\n\n516\n00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.160\nIf we're not supposed to\ntouch the DHCP servers,\n\n517\n00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.960\nwell at least what we can\ndo is we can run ipconfig.\n\n518\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.890\nOr we already know the IP addresses of\nour DHCP server to verify that it's\n\n519\n00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.760\nactually responding to at least\na connectivity request at that point.\n\n520\n00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.630\nBut then we may have to go in and\ntrouble shoot that and figure that out,\n\n521\n00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:52.100\nor we may have to assign that to\nsomebody else, or escalate it up for\n\n522\n00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.650\nsomeone else to take care of.\n\n523\n00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.190\nNow just wanted to turn or\nreactivated that scope again.\n\n524\n00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.940\nSo, what should normally happen\nthen after a while of course,\n\n525\n00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.880\nthat hey, it might get an IP address back.\n\n526\n00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.180\nBut if you wanna rush the issue along,\n\n527\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.240\nthat's what I like to\ndo cuz I hate waiting.\n\n528\n00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.040\nWe can always issue a couple of\ndifferent commands here, too.\n\n529\n00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.720\nBut, one is just simply\ndoing the IP config renew.\n\n530\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.550\nNow everybody will do this\ndifferently over time.\n\n531\n00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.890\nThe way that I learned, and I'm gonna\nassume Mike learned it this way too,\n\n532\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.270\ncuz he learned it before I did.\n\n533\n00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.110\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n534\n00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.780\nIs that we used to always run\nan IP config release first, and\n\n535\n00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.850\nthen we would do an IP config renew.\n\n536\n00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:30.130\nBut, an IP config renew\nactually does both, right.\n\n537\n00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:31.160\n>> It does.\n\n538\n00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.177\nSo, it's like wait, why do I have\nrelease if I can just type renew.\n\n539\n00:27:34.177 --> 00:27:37.410\nBut, there are times you wanna release\nit and you don't want a new one yet,\n\n540\n00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:38.320\nso, it is there.\n\n541\n00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.490\n>> Yeah.\nSo, it does give you that option to do so,\n\n542\n00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.650\nbut this one should actually do both.\n\n543\n00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:43.800\nAnd, it may take a moment.\n\n544\n00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.100\nSo, what are we doing now?\n\n545\n00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.250\nWe're actually starting that\nmanual process over again.\n\n546\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:52.390\nSo, DHCP where it gives that ability\nto discover, to accept an offer,\n\n547\n00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:56.010\nto be able to have that request and\nthat acknowledgement.\n\n548\n00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:00.262\nWell, that happens at whatever the basis\nis that DHCP does it, but we're saying,\n\n549\n00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:00.825\ndo it now.\n\n550\n00:28:00.825 --> 00:28:04.064\nThat's what we're actually telling our\nmachines, to go and make a request,\n\n551\n00:28:04.064 --> 00:28:07.810\nput it out there on the network, make sure\nwe get everything responding back here.\n\n552\n00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.020\nSo if everything is done and\n\n553\n00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.810\ncorrect, what we should end up seeing is\nright there, under the renew now, and\n\n554\n00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:19.750\nyou can see now where I get\n172.16.95.102 is now gonna be clear.\n\n555\n00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:20.970\nAnd you're not done yet.\n\n556\n00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:25.430\nRemember that if you are getting that, now\nyou just need to verify once again that\n\n557\n00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.000\neverything else is actually responsive\nin the way that you want it to be.\n\n558\n00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.187\nOops, .95.10.\n\n559\n00:28:32.187 --> 00:28:36.873\nAnd then of course, if everything\nis working, you also want to do,\n\n560\n00:28:36.873 --> 00:28:40.322\nlet's say using the name,\nand there you go.\n\n561\n00:28:40.322 --> 00:28:41.280\nSo and then of course,\n\n562\n00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.210\nyou would ping outward,\nverify that everything is good, and see.\n\n563\n00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.910\nYou're not just done\nwhen you think it's done.\n\n564\n00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:50.790\nIt has to make sure that it\nworks all the way through, and\n\n565\n00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.960\nthen verify that the user can actually\ndo what they need to at the very end,\n\n566\n00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.850\nwhen we start troubleshooting\nthings like DNS as well.\n\n567\n00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.249\n>> Absolutely, yeah, cuz you never know.\n\n568\n00:28:58.249 --> 00:29:01.699\nWe might have fixed the connectivity issue\nand it was a problem, but then maybe,\n\n569\n00:29:01.699 --> 00:29:02.395\nI don't know.\n\n570\n00:29:02.395 --> 00:29:05.880\nTheir browser is actually having a problem\nas well, so you fix it like this,\n\n571\n00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.060\nyou walk away, they open up their browser,\nand still can't connect.\n\n572\n00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.600\nThey're gonna call you right back, right.\n\n573\n00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.680\nSo you gotta make sure that\nthe client is satisfied.\n\n574\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.540\nAll right Ronnie,\na lot of great information there.\n\n575\n00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.980\nAgain, name resolution a big source\nof trouble or it can be, you know.\n\n576\n00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.160\nIf you don't have name resolution\nit's gonna slow a lot of things or\n\n577\n00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.400\nstop a lot of things from\nhappening on your network.\n\n578\n00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.730\nSo, we've got to be able to troubleshoot\nthat effectively, get it back up,\n\n579\n00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.090\nget it running,\nget everything back to work.\n\n580\n00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.260\nSo, very good information there Ronnie and\nanother great episode.\n\n581\n00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.260\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this show.\n\n582\n00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.890\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n583\n00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:40.820\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n584\n00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.229\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n585\n00:29:42.229 -->

00:00:18.089\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick with me today\nis the one, the only, Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.889\nHow are you doing, Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:19.632\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n6\n00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:22.727\nToday is another great day to be right\nhere in the studio as we continue on\n\n7\n00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:24.439\ntalking about supporting Windows 7.\n\n8\n00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.287\nThis is not really designed towards the\nexam even though we might cover somethings\n\n9\n00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:30.082\nyou will find in the exam objectives.\n\n10\n00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:34.499\nIt's really about just making sure that we\nunderstand what we need to be doing as of\n\n11\n00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:38.789\ncourse Enterprise loads technicians and\nsome of the issues we will be facing and\n\n12\n00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:39.957\nneeding to address.\n\n13\n00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:45.345\nAnd today, we're specifically talking\nabout VPN issues on the client end.\n\n14\n00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.953\nSo that is what we're actually what\nwe're actually gonna be addressing and\n\n15\n00:00:47.953 --> 00:00:49.472\nwe'll see something like with Windows 7.\n\n16\n00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:53.911\nYou can actually create different types of\nVPN connections and each of those types do\n\n17\n00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.238\nhave a little bit of quirkiness\nto them that we need to address.\n\n18\n00:00:57.238 --> 00:00:58.829\nAnd we just need to be familiar with and\n\n19\n00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.336\nthat's what we're going to\njust talk about today as well.\n\n20\n00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:04.740\n>> Very good, so, we got a few different\nVPN protocols that we need to be familiar\n\n21\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.390\nwith, cuz as you said each\none slightly different, so.\n\n22\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.830\nWe need to know what\nthe differences are so\n\n23\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.050\nwe know where to do our troubleshooting.\n\n24\n00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.608\nSo, which one's first on the list Ronnie?\n\n25\n00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:14.935\n>> When we start out, let's go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:19.009\nmake sure we that we understand\nthat with Windows 7 itself right,\n\n27\n00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.880\nyou don't have to add in a third party\nutility to connect to a VPN server.\n\n28\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.810\nYou do have the ability to create your\nown little client, VPN connection there.\n\n29\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.053\nAnd it's from that point that we do need\nto talk about some of the different types,\n\n30\n00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:33.750\ncuz that's what really matters, right?\n\n31\n00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.279\nIs the very fact that we connect properly\nto whatever we're connecting to.\n\n32\n00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:39.230\nSo let's show you how to do that first.\n\n33\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.100\nI already made a connection,\n\n34\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.720\nbut we can at least show you another\nconnection that we can make right here.\n\n35\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.446\nSo, what we wanna do is make\nsure that we understand.\n\n36\n00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:49.553\nNow, most of the time I'm gonna say this,\ninside of Enterprises,\n\n37\n00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:54.325\nthis is not going to be the VPN client\nyou're going to use, but it is possible.\n\n38\n00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:58.504\nSo, don't rule it out, if you don't have\none, you can actually use this to make\n\n39\n00:01:58.504 --> 00:02:01.880\nthose connections to,\neven other types of VPN servers.\n\n40\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.530\nBut they do have one right here.\n\n41\n00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.906\nBut a lot of times third party utilities\nare gonna be used because they do tend\n\n42\n00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:08.858\nto work better with their own products,\nand\n\n43\n00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:11.212\nthat's just the nature of\nhow these connectors go.\n\n44\n00:02:11.212 --> 00:02:13.939\nSo if you're running a Cisco VP\non your private Cisco client,\n\n45\n00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.940\nif you're running a Nortel or whatever it\nis, you'll have those clients as well.\n\n46\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.160\nBut just kinda realize in Windows 7\nyou can actually do the same thing.\n\n47\n00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.680\nAnd it's actually kinda neat because it\nmeans you don't have to worry about it\n\n48\n00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.470\nif you actually just wanna\nmake a basic connection.\n\n49\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.001\nSo I'm gonna click on Start and\nControl Panel.\n\n50\n00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.353\nAnd then we are going to go to\nthe Network and Sharing Center, and\n\n51\n00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:36.086\ninside of Network and\nSharing Center I'm going to,\n\n52\n00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:39.211\nactually I'm not going to go\nanywhere else but right here.\n\n53\n00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:44.240\nSo what we're looking for is down here\nat the bottom half of the screen.\n\n54\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.740\nSo, notice right here where we\nhave set up a new connection or\n\n55\n00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.580\nnetwork, VPN connection,\nyou start seeing that here.\n\n56\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.220\nConnect to a network,\nVPN network, you name it.\n\n57\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.200\nYou have these options.\n\n58\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.310\nIf this is your first time doing it,\nyou're gonna select this first option\n\n59\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.320\nwhere it says Set up a new connection or\nnetwork.\n\n60\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.690\nAnd then you have the options\nthat are available here.\n\n61\n00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.950\nNow, today you do have the ability\nof course to set up a dial-up.\n\n62\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.410\nSetup a new network, you name it,\nbut the one that we're gonna select,\n\n63\n00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.415\nof course, is to Connect to a workplace.\n\n64\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.130\nAnd then click Next, and\nnotice how easy it is.\n\n65\n00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.185\nNow, I already have one set up, so I could\nchoose this one but I'm not going to.\n\n66\n00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:22.696\nWe're gonna walk through it and\nthen we're gonna, kind of, back off and\n\n67\n00:03:22.696 --> 00:03:24.610\nuse the one that I have\nalready setup here.\n\n68\n00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.890\nSo, I'm gonna select No, let's go\nahead and create a new connection.\n\n69\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.814\nAnd then it’s gonna say,\nwhich one do I want to use.\n\n70\n00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:34.154\nWell, normally when we start talking\nabout setting up a VPN connection,\n\n71\n00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:37.870\nit’s because we do need to connect\nacross a wide area network.\n\n72\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.560\nA gigantic network, but\nwe don’t wanna pay for\n\n73\n00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.060\nthe chance of course like having\na private point to point connection.\n\n74\n00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.630\nSo you running a wire directly to my house\nthe VPN technology of course helps us,\n\n75\n00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.160\nand to use like the Internet to still\nmake that private connection, so\n\n76\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.338\nit's fairly easy.\n\n77\n00:03:55.338 --> 00:03:59.280\nIf you don't have a modem connected\nto your phone, to your PC excuse me,\n\n78\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.730\nmore than likely you're\ngonna choose this one.\n\n79\n00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.600\nUse my internet connection\nto help us through that.\n\n80\n00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.178\nSo I'll select that, and\n\n81\n00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:09.279\nthis is where we have to have\nthe personal information that we need.\n\n82\n00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:13.879\nNow, the good thing is it will allow us to\nuse of course our DNS namespace that we\n\n83\n00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.020\nchoose to or the IP address to\nwhat were gonna be connecting to.\n\n84\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.120\nSo, I know the IP address so I can do my.\n\n85\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.382\nThis one here, now, if you're connecting\nacross the Internet even though you\n\n86\n00:04:27.382 --> 00:04:29.286\ncan do this with a public IP address.\n\n87\n00:04:29.286 --> 00:04:33.049\nIt's probably better if you do use\nyour DNS namespace to do this.\n\n88\n00:04:33.049 --> 00:04:35.552\nAnd a lot of times that's probably\nwhat they'll give you, right.\n\n89\n00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:38.590\nSo if somebody says hey can\nyou can set this up at home.\n\n90\n00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.610\nThey're just going to give you a name and\nyou're simply going to type it in here.\n\n91\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.690\nIf they give you an IP address then they\nknow something, they know you can type it\n\n92\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.070\nin but they also know you can mistype\nthat a lot easier than names.\n\n93\n00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.380\nSo more than likely,\nyou'll probably set that up.\n\n94\n00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.000\nAnd then the destination let's\njust say its lab@itpro.tv.\n\n95\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.637\nNow this one doesn't\nmatter in it's format so\n\n96\n00:04:59.637 --> 00:05:03.910\nmuch I'm gonna change it from\nthe different one that I had before.\n\n97\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.743\nAnd this is where we can set up\nauthentication if we need to as well.\n\n98\n00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:08.357\nWe can use a smartcard.\n\n99\n00:05:08.357 --> 00:05:10.390\nAllow other people to connect to this.\n\n100\n00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.660\nDon't connect, just set it up now so\nI can connect later.\n\n101\n00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.090\nSo I'm gonna select that one and\nthen click Next here.\n\n102\n00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.100\nAnd now we provide some sort of\nauthentication if I'm in my network.\n\n103\n00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.403\nI'm gonna do labmike.\n\n104\n00:05:24.403 --> 00:05:26.029\nSet that one up there too and\n\n105\n00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.148\nthen I'm going to tell it to remember\nthe password and click Create.\n\n106\n00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:33.166\nSo now it is ready for its usage here.\n\n107\n00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:36.082\nSo everything seems fine and\nyou might say is that it?\n\n108\n00:05:36.082 --> 00:05:37.185\nIs that as easy as it gets?\n\n109\n00:05:37.185 --> 00:05:38.510\nWell, sometimes.\n\n110\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.924\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It really is.\n\n111\n00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:43.694\nIt's as easy as it gets if the other\nend is set up the way that it needs to\n\n112\n00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:44.780\nbe set up.\n\n113\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.630\nThen we are ready and fine to connect.\n\n114\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.250\nSo if I go ahead and\nchange that, and now let's see,\n\n115\n00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.572\nthe one that I just\nconnected is right here.\n\n116\n00:05:53.572 --> 00:05:59.036\nSo lab@itpro.tv and I'm simply going\nto select that, and then the password.\n\n117\n00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:01.961\nLet me go and type this in,\nlet's see if it actually connects here.\n\n118\n00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:07.590\nJust that simply, Connect and that says,\nverifying user name and password.\n\n119\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.551\nSo, let's see, oh, an error right away.\n\n120\n00:06:09.551 --> 00:06:13.625\nThis connection was prevented because\nof a policy configured on my RAS,\n\n121\n00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:15.760\nmy remote access VPN server.\n\n122\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.293\nSpecifically, authentication method used,\nusername and password,\n\n123\n00:06:18.293 --> 00:06:19.631\ndid not match anything that we set up.\n\n124\n00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:22.974\nSo that could indicate another issue now.\n\n125\n00:06:22.974 --> 00:06:26.762\nSo there are issues dealing with just\nregular authentication that we might\n\n126\n00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:27.890\ndeal with.\n\n127\n00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.500\nBut usually a lot of other things are,\n\n128\n00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.910\nwhat right here in\nthe parentheses that we'd see.\n\n129\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.130\nOne says IKEv2 and\nthis one over here says PPTP.\n\n130\n00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.332\nAnd those are the different types\nthat Mike was referring to.\n\n131\n00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:43.736\nWith some of these different types\nof VPN connections, we do have to\n\n132\n00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:47.440\nactually understand that they all have\ntheir own quirkiness to them, and\n\n133\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.441\nthat we need to understand what we need to\ndo to troubleshoot them when we start to\n\n134\n00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:52.124\ntake a look.\n\n135\n00:06:52.124 --> 00:06:56.924\nSo if they told us that we are setting up,\nlet's say this L2TP connection,\n\n136\n00:06:56.924 --> 00:07:01.649\nwell it means we have to actually get\neverything on both sides that we need to\n\n137\n00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:03.770\nset up there and to do that.\n\n138\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.750\nIf we're also setting up like IKE version\n2, it's also gonna be that way as well.\n\n139\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.845\nNow, mine actually automatically,\nset itself to that L2TP but\n\n140\n00:07:11.845 --> 00:07:13.264\nwhat if they tell you?\n\n141\n00:07:13.264 --> 00:07:15.541\nHey, you're not connecting that,\n\n142\n00:07:15.541 --> 00:07:20.694\nyou're actually connecting to an IKE\nversion 2 type of VPN connections instead?\n\n143\n00:07:20.694 --> 00:07:25.849\nWe can simply right click on that one,\nand then go down to Properties.\n\n144\n00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:29.425\nAnd it's in here,\nwe're looking at the Security tab.\n\n145\n00:07:29.425 --> 00:07:33.478\nAnd even though it says Automatic, so\nit has an order that it tries in in\n\n146\n00:07:33.478 --> 00:07:36.860\nAutomatic, and\nI don't remember the exact order.\n\n147\n00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.245\nBut if it fails at one,\nit normally tries to go to the other one,\n\n148\n00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:42.041\nthen it tries to go to another one,\nthen it tries to go to another one here.\n\n149\n00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:45.206\nBut that's what normally\nhappens under Automatic.\n\n150\n00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:48.479\nBut if they tell you which one\nthat they're connecting to,\n\n151\n00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:53.007\nwell at that point you can then select the\none that you want to actually do instead.\n\n152\n00:07:53.007 --> 00:07:54.896\nSo it's here that you have to come in and\n\n153\n00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:57.372\nactually choose some of\nthe options that you have.\n\n154\n00:07:57.372 --> 00:08:02.197\nSo For example, the reason why we\nmight choose to use IKE version two.\n\n155\n00:08:02.197 --> 00:08:03.946\nRight?\nIs that we have something we\n\n156\n00:08:03.946 --> 00:08:07.960\ncall VPN reconnect, the older name for\nit, I think it was called Mobility.\n\n157\n00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.890\nWhile IKE version two is\nthe only one that supports it.\n\n158\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.528\nSo if you know that you're on a network\nthat says look RVPN has to support, IKE,\n\n159\n00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:19.840\nnot IKE version 2,\nHast to support VPN reconnect or mobility.\n\n160\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.732\nWell that means you don't get to choose\nother options that we just saw here.\n\n161\n00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:26.910\nYou dont' get to use the L2TP,\nyou don't get to choose the TTTP or\n\n162\n00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.660\nthe SSTP as well.\n\n163\n00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.912\nSo, that leaves you with this option,\nwhich means you now have to go on and\n\n164\n00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:34.740\nactually trouble shoot some\nof those other things.\n\n165\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.630\nWith IKE version two you don't actually\nalso need a certificate as well.\n\n166\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.360\nAll you really need to do is just to\nmake sure that when you do have a,\n\n167\n00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.150\nyou don't need a machine certificate.\n\n168\n00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.550\nExcuse me,\nyou don't need a pre-shared key.\n\n169\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.936\nYou will actually need,\n\n170\n00:08:48.936 --> 00:08:52.371\nto actually have that server\nside to issue you a certificate.\n\n171\n00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:53.392\nI can't say certificate.\n\n172\n00:08:53.392 --> 00:08:54.742\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know why,\n\n173\n00:08:54.742 --> 00:08:55.946\nit's just tongue twisting me.\n\n174\n00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:58.832\nBut you will have to have\nthe certificate installed and\n\n175\n00:08:58.832 --> 00:09:01.270\nplaced in your trusted roots folder.\n\n176\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.490\nAnd when it comes down to a lot\nof these other connections,\n\n177\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.710\nthat's really kind of the big issue,\nis making sure that certificate\n\n178\n00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.410\nis in that trusted roots folder, and\nthat's really where a key of it comes in.\n\n179\n00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.790\n>> Yeah, absolutely, your machine is\ngonna request that the server that it's\n\n180\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.220\nconnecting to verify it's identity.\n\n181\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.350\nHey, VPN server I'm trying\nto connect to you but\n\n182\n00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.970\nbefore I do, prove to me who you are.\n\n183\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.510\nAnd a server uses a certificate to do\nthat, so it sends back over a certificate\n\n184\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.120\nand says see, I am your works VPN server,\nhere's a certificate that proves it.\n\n185\n00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.270\nWell, that certificate is issued by\nsomething known as a certificate\n\n186\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.270\nauthority.\n\n187\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.650\nAnd if your machine doesn't\ntrust the certificate authority\n\n188\n00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.370\nthat issued the certificate, then it's\nnot gonna trust the certificate and\n\n189\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.290\nit's gonna say yeah, I see what you're\nsaying but I don't believe you.\n\n190\n00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.930\nAnd there's not gonna allow you\nto establish that connection.\n\n191\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.970\n>> Yeah, and so that's usually\nthe big key behind a lot of this.\n\n192\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.790\nAnd the reason why it tends to fail is\nwe don't actually have it installed\n\n193\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.550\nin that trusted root authority.\n\n194\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.165\nAnd so very that if you know\nwhat the VPN server is,\n\n195\n00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:04.625\nverify that server\ncertificate is in there.\n\n196\n00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:06.163\nIf it's not, it's not gonna allow\nyou to make that connection.\n\n197\n00:10:06.163 --> 00:10:09.387\n>> Yeah, and usually work computers,\nmy computers at work, or\n\n198\n00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:12.374\nif this laptop comes to work and\nthen it goes home with me.\n\n199\n00:10:12.374 --> 00:10:15.912\nWe have group policy in place at\nthe corporate network that sends that\n\n200\n00:10:15.912 --> 00:10:19.328\ncertificate out to all the machines and\nputs it in the right place so\n\n201\n00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:20.984\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n202\n00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:23.613\nBut if I'm going to my home machine,\nthe machine that sits in\n\n203\n00:10:23.613 --> 00:10:26.513\nmy house all the time,\ngroup policy is not getting applied there.\n\n204\n00:10:26.513 --> 00:10:28.638\nRight?\nThat's my personal machine, so\n\n205\n00:10:28.638 --> 00:10:33.310\nthere's no way for my company to tell\nmy machine to trust those certificates.\n\n206\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.960\nSo it usually takes a little extra\nconfiguration to get that done.\n\n207\n00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.560\n>> Right, so just try and\nverify that, that's what's happening.\n\n208\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.790\nNow that's just one of\nthe big issues there.\n\n209\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.735\nSo think about that list if your\nnetwork is choosing to do that.\n\n210\n00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:46.894\nSo a lot of times you get weird scenarios.\n\n211\n00:10:46.894 --> 00:10:47.439\nRight?\n\n212\n00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:50.310\nThey're saying yes we like this\nVPN reconnect because it doesn't\n\n213\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.076\nmatter if I switch networks,\nI go from one network to the other,\n\n214\n00:10:53.076 --> 00:10:57.020\nit automatically reestablishing my VPN for\nme, I don't have to worry about it.\n\n215\n00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.920\nWell if they tell you that what you know\nyou actually have to use IKE version two.\n\n216\n00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.940\nYou know that certificate has to be\ninstalled on that before all of the rest\n\n217\n00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.170\nof it is also gonna end up working\nthe way that you want it to.\n\n218\n00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.430\n>> Yeah, and then another protocol that\nwe can use is something called SSTP, or\n\n219\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.550\nSecure Socket Tunneling Protocol.\n\n220\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.495\nTell us about that one, Ronnie.\n\n221\n00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:18.080\n>> Yeah, when we start taking a look at\nthis secure socket tunneling protocol,\n\n222\n00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.120\nwhat ends up happening here is\nactually something very neat.\n\n223\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.690\nMost of the time in an enterprise,\n\n224\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.530\nwe don't wanna put any more holes\nthrough our firewalls than we need to.\n\n225\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.150\nRight?\n\n226\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.030\nOur firewall is our\nmain perimeter defense.\n\n227\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.950\nAnd so even with VPN connections, and\n\n228\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.510\nthis is where it becomes a little\nbit misunderstood sometimes.\n\n229\n00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.300\nWe allow for VPN traffic to go through,\nbut that means the firewall doesn't look\n\n230\n00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.250\nat any of that traffic inside\nof the VPN connection.\n\n231\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.780\nIt doesn't stop it, doesn't look at it,\ndoesn't take any chance of it.\n\n232\n00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.490\nIt just says, yes,\nwe allow that traffic come through.\n\n233\n00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.860\nSo you can imagine that most of the time,\nthey don't want to allow these things\n\n234\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.090\neven though they are actually\nsecured connections.\n\n235\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.340\nThe problem that we have is fairly simple\nis that if they don't wanna allow it,\n\n236\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.680\nwell what do you do?\n\n237\n00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.720\nWell there is a VPN though that we have\nout there called SSTP that uses something\n\n238\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.620\nthat the firewall probably has already\nbeen opened for, which is on port 443.\n\n239\n00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.320\nAnd that is SSTP.\n\n240\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.890\nSo in the same way that you and I would\nbrowse to a secure website and allow that\n\n241\n00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.608\ntraffic to come back then, the firewall\nis not opening up an additional port.\n\n242\n00:12:18.608 --> 00:12:25.350\nFor example, like on IP sec over L2TP,\nit's opening up port 1723, I think.\n\n243\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.170\nIt's opening up that port for\nus to be able to connect in.\n\n244\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.800\nSo that's an additional port.\n\n245\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.380\nWell instead, what if we could do\na VPN connection over a port 443?\n\n246\n00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.890\nWell SSTP allows us to do that.\n\n247\n00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.140\nSo by doing that.\n\n248\n00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.010\nRight?\n\n249\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.080\nFirewall and security people, that's cool,\nbecause I'm not opening up an additional\n\n250\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.640\nport, it's already over a port\nthat's secured, which is great.\n\n251\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.650\nAnd secondly though, it means that you\ndon't really have to set up a taunt, but\n\n252\n00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.500\nyou still need the same thing\nthat we just talked about.\n\n253\n00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.280\nOn the client machine, it still has to be\nable to take that server certificate and\n\n254\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.860\nget it installed in the trusted roots.\n\n255\n00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:07.180\nNow there is an additional thing that\nyou have to do here with SSTP as well.\n\n256\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.650\nWith SSTP and the way that it works.\n\n257\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.564\nRemember, that those certificates\nonce they're listed out there,\n\n258\n00:13:13.564 --> 00:13:16.881\nthey also normally have with\nthat certificate authority,\n\n259\n00:13:16.881 --> 00:13:19.423\nwhat we call\na Certificate Revocation List.\n\n260\n00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:21.002\nRight?\nThe CRL.\n\n261\n00:13:21.002 --> 00:13:23.809\nAnd the way that Microsoft\nhas it implemented is this.\n\n262\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:29.140\nEven if you go look, this certificate,\nit's not gonna be revoked,\n\n263\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.750\nit's not going to be.\n\n264\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.520\nThe SSTP connection from the client\nside says, I have to check.\n\n265\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.760\nIn other words,\nI have to verify that it's not in the CRL.\n\n266\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.821\nSo, if I can't verify it's not in the CRL\nI'm not gonna make an SSTP connection.\n\n267\n00:13:43.821 --> 00:13:45.179\nThat's pretty hefty.\n\n268\n00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:47.397\n>> Yeah, it's kinda like if\nyou think of it this way.\n\n269\n00:13:47.397 --> 00:13:49.936\nRight?\nLet's say if a police officer pulls you\n\n270\n00:13:49.936 --> 00:13:52.447\nover and he says,\nis your license suspended?\n\n271\n00:13:52.447 --> 00:13:53.364\nYou say, no it's not.\n\n272\n00:13:53.364 --> 00:13:55.601\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, is he going to believe you or\n\n273\n00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.450\nis he going to go look it up for\nhimself in that database.\n\n274\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.066\nRight?\n\n275\n00:13:58.066 --> 00:13:59.524\nThe same thing is going on here,\n\n276\n00:13:59.524 --> 00:14:02.929\nI'm asking that server to present its\ncredentials to me or its certificate\n\n277\n00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:06.590\nI need to verify that certificate\nhasn't been revoked for any reason.\n\n278\n00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.840\nI need to talk to that master list,\nI can't just take his word for it.\n\n279\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.151\nSo it's that same concept there.\n\n280\n00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:12.961\n>> Yeah, with that being in place.\n\n281\n00:14:12.961 --> 00:14:13.472\nRight?\n\n282\n00:14:13.472 --> 00:14:17.728\nWell now what if you go well,\nI don't really wanted to check that,\n\n283\n00:14:17.728 --> 00:14:22.440\nI don't wanted to do that,\nis there a way that we can get around it?\n\n284\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.842\n>> There is a way you can get around it,\nbut you probably shouldn't.\n\n285\n00:14:25.842 --> 00:14:26.348\n[LAUGH] Right?\n>> Right.\n\n286\n00:14:26.348 --> 00:14:29.550\n[LAUGH] >> Of all the things you\nprobably shouldn't disable this.\n\n287\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.600\nBut there is a way that you\ncan actually go into the,\n\n288\n00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.180\nlet me make sure I'm telling you right.\n\n289\n00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.600\nYeah, you can go into the registry.\n\n290\n00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.840\nI wanna to make sure I told you right.\n\n291\n00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.190\nI was thinking Group Policy,\nbut it wasn't Group Policy.\n\n292\n00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.950\nYou can go into the registry and\n\n293\n00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:44.190\nthere is a setting inside of the registry\nthat you can go and actually disable it.\n\n294\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.120\nIf you wanted to be able to say look, I\ndon't wanted to check that revocation list\n\n295\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.310\nbut normally again you\ndon't wanna do that.\n\n296\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.410\nSo you gotta think about that.\n\n297\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.470\nIf you do have,\nif you do choose to use the SSTP,\n\n298\n00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.940\nyou also need to make sure not only is\nthat certificate in there but that it\n\n299\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:06.040\ncan check that certificate revocation\nlist to verify it has not been revoked.\n\n300\n00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.387\nIf not, you do need to go into\nthe registry and change that.\n\n301\n00:15:08.387 --> 00:15:09.908\nOh, let's just go ahead and\nshow you where that key is.\n\n302\n00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:10.673\nWhy not?\n\n303\n00:15:10.673 --> 00:15:11.266\n>> I don't if we should.\n\n304\n00:15:11.266 --> 00:15:13.948\n[LAUGH] That would really be a bad option.\n\n305\n00:15:13.948 --> 00:15:15.328\n>> Right.\n>> Because what you're doing\n\n306\n00:15:15.328 --> 00:15:16.920\nis you're saying hey, I'm gonna trust it.\n\n307\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.638\nAnd not just this one connection.\n\n308\n00:15:18.638 --> 00:15:19.323\nRight?\n\n309\n00:15:19.323 --> 00:15:24.860\nThis key, when you make this change, would\napply to all your attempted connections.\n\n310\n00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.740\nNow all of a sudden somebody\ncould present you a certificate\n\n311\n00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.620\nthat had been revoked for\na very good reason.\n\n312\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.390\nAnd your system is not gonna check and\nverify that.\n\n313\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.040\nSo you really don't want,\n\n314\n00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.960\nyou're gonna break most of your\nsecurity policies at work.\n\n315\n00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.200\nIt's not gonna be a good day.\n\n316\n00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.560\n>> Okay, so we won't show that then.\n\n317\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.754\n>> [LAUGH] Oh,\nI don't care if you show them, but.\n\n318\n00:15:42.754 --> 00:15:43.793\n>> Yeah, let's do it then.\n\n319\n00:15:43.793 --> 00:15:44.601\nYeah, let's do it.\n\n320\n00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:45.871\nLet's go ahead and show it.\n\n321\n00:15:45.871 --> 00:15:47.460\nWhy not let you break it here.\n\n322\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.140\nAnd so this is something you don't\nwanna do, let's go ahead and say that.\n\n323\n00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.240\nAll right so\nwe're gonna go into our registry editor.\n\n324\n00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.100\nSo I'm simply gonna click on Start and\ntype in regedit.\n\n325\n00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.105\nI wanted to do .msc for some reason or\nanother, and I know it's not that.\n\n326\n00:16:01.105 --> 00:16:04.703\nYeah, so here it is, and we're actually\ninside of the registry editor.\n\n327\n00:16:04.703 --> 00:16:08.430\nAnd what I want to do is go\nto my local machine key here.\n\n328\n00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.650\nAnd then from local machine\nI need to get into SYSTEM.\n\n329\n00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.680\nAnd then the current control set.\n\n330\n00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.387\nAnd then Services.\n\n331\n00:16:17.387 --> 00:16:22.222\nSSTP, [CROSSTALK] that's\nquite the mouth voyeur.\n\n332\n00:16:22.222 --> 00:16:23.570\n>> Yeah it is.\n\n333\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.240\n>> SSTP, let's see.\n\n334\n00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.080\nThere it is.\n\n335\n00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:33.460\nServices, and once we're actually in here,\nwe're going to look for our parameters.\n\n336\n00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:38.571\nNow, if I expand that out, there we go,\nwe have parameters and in here\n\n337\n00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:44.307\nthere is a D word value for us, which is\ngoing to be the no cert revocation here.\n\n338\n00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:45.306\n>> [INAUDIBLE] you have to create it.\n\n339\n00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:45.806\n>> Yep.\n\n340\n00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:46.514\n>> It's not even there.\n\n341\n00:16:46.514 --> 00:16:48.493\nThat's telling you what\na great idea this is.\n\n342\n00:16:48.493 --> 00:16:51.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and so if you don't have it, and\n\n343\n00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.740\nthat's actually a good point for\nus to mention.\n\n344\n00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.020\nIf you did wanna create this,\n\n345\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.090\nyou would literally have to\ncreate a new D word value.\n\n346\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.080\nSo that would be here.\n\n347\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.680\nAnd then this value, and\nthis is why you don't wanna create.\n\n348\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.320\nIt's called no, and then it has to also\nbe, I think it's case specific, too.\n\n349\n00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.280\nRevocation, if I can spell it correctly,\nCheck, is what it's called.\n\n350\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.400\nAnd once you do that, you then would,\nmake sure I spell that right,\n\n351\n00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.080\nyou change that to a one.\n\n352\n00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.730\nClick OK, and\nnow that would actually apply.\n\n353\n00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.340\nYou're probably not gonna want to do this.\n\n354\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.190\n>> Probably.\nLike I say,\n\n355\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.880\nthe big problem that I would have\nwith that is you're turning off\n\n356\n00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.705\nall checks, right?\n\n357\n00:17:28.705 --> 00:17:29.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not just for\n\n358\n00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.630\nthis one VPN connection.\n\n359\n00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.950\nWell, I guess it is under\nthat SSTP connection.\n\n360\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.710\nYou know,\nI could see using this as a test.\n\n361\n00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.380\nMaybe you're troubleshooting this\nconnection and you wanna see if,\n\n362\n00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.540\nI know the certificate's in there, I see\nit in that trusted certificate store.\n\n363\n00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.040\nIs it the revocation check that's\ncausing this connection to fail?\n\n364\n00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.010\nWell let's turn off\nthe requirement to check, and\n\n365\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.980\nnow if all of a sudden it works,\nthen I'm pretty sure that was the problem.\n\n366\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.290\nThen I can go in here and remove that key,\nright, to actually fix the problem.\n\n367\n00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.014\nI wouldn't wanna leave that in there.\n\n368\n00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:02.638\n>> Right, and\n\n369\n00:18:02.638 --> 00:18:06.441\nthat's one of those issues, again,\n>> So with SSTP, you can see where there's\n\n370\n00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:09.681\na couple of issues you would have to\ndeal with in this type of connection.\n\n371\n00:18:09.681 --> 00:18:12.680\n>> Then we get on into some of\nour older tunnelling protocols.\n\n372\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.432\nWe got our good old L2TP, or\nlayer two tunnelling protocol.\n\n373\n00:18:16.432 --> 00:18:19.721\n>> Yeah, the layer two tunnelling\nprotocol is one of the older ones, but\n\n374\n00:18:19.721 --> 00:18:22.420\nit actually does provide\nsome security as well.\n\n375\n00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.710\nFor us and this is the one that we do see\nused across the Internet quite often.\n\n376\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:32.540\nBut today with the IP sec V pins that can\nbe created, SSTP is coming on very strong.\n\n377\n00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.661\nThis is starting to go by the, I don't\nwant to say the dodo, but it is more\n\n378\n00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:41.472\ncomplex to set up and that's one of those\nunusual things that you do have with L2TP.\n\n379\n00:18:41.472 --> 00:18:45.145\nIt requires now the machines to\nauthenticate with each other.\n\n380\n00:18:45.145 --> 00:18:48.390\nAnd it can also of course require\nthat certificate to be there as well.\n\n381\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.055\nSo when you start setting this up,\nnow you have to deal with,\n\n382\n00:18:51.055 --> 00:18:52.222\ndid they type it in right?\n\n383\n00:18:52.222 --> 00:18:53.762\nIt was a preassured key?\n\n384\n00:18:53.762 --> 00:18:57.162\nOr do they actually use server\ncertificates to exchange with each other?\n\n385\n00:18:57.162 --> 00:19:01.742\nYou name it, this is one that does require\na little bit more complexity to set up.\n\n386\n00:19:01.742 --> 00:19:05.052\nI'm not saying you can't do it,\nbut very easy to misconfigure.\n\n387\n00:19:05.052 --> 00:19:07.872\n>> Yeah, like I said,\nit was very common for a long time.\n\n388\n00:19:07.872 --> 00:19:10.472\nIt was supported by multiple systems, so.\n\n389\n00:19:10.472 --> 00:19:11.532\nBut as Ronny said,\n\n390\n00:19:11.532 --> 00:19:16.460\nit did take a little configuration on\nboth ends, which to compare to some of\n\n391\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.490\nthe tunnelling protocols we use today\nmaybe makes it seem a little more complex.\n\n392\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.090\nTypically it's a passphrase or\na certificate issue.\n\n393\n00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.770\nOr a port number, right?\n\n394\n00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:28.378\nBecause L2TP is,\ngosh if I can remember, 1723?\n\n395\n00:19:28.378 --> 00:19:29.270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then\n\n396\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.790\n>> PPTP with 1701, or I\n\n397\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.080\nmight get those backwards,\ndouble check on that.\n\n398\n00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.510\n>> Yeah,\nI always get those backwards, too.\n\n399\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.470\n>> But yeah, so port number, firewall\nisn't usually a problem with those\n\n400\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.200\ncertificates, or that pre-shared key.\n\n401\n00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.660\nAnd then PPTP,\nthe point-to-point tunneling protocol,\n\n402\n00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.200\nanother one that's been around for\na long time.\n\n403\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.080\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that one works great.\n\n404\n00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.680\n>> Except that it's not as secure as any\nof the other ones we've talked about.\n\n405\n00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.020\nAnd so you do have a trade\noff in what you choose to do.\n\n406\n00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.330\nThis one's fairly easy to configure, makes\nit actually work the way that we want to.\n\n407\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.320\nAnd, really is.\n\n408\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.500\nWhen we talk about easy to configure,\n\n409\n00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.940\nit took me like three minutes to configure\nit and I was up and ready to go.\n\n410\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.940\nI wanted to mention something\nabout L2TP as well,\n\n411\n00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.560\nbecause this is the one that you're like,\nwhy not just set that up?\n\n412\n00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.760\nWell on all the other ones, we can\nactually do it the way that I showed you,\n\n413\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.360\nand it probably works just fine.\n\n414\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.139\nWith L2TP,\nnormally it does have to be preconfigured.\n\n415\n00:20:15.139 --> 00:20:18.039\nSo it's not one that you can\ndo on the fly right away and\n\n416\n00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:20.920\nactually allow that to work very easily.\n\n417\n00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.700\nThe other thing we also\nhave a problem with,\n\n418\n00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.500\nnot only with the firewall as well,\nis actually what we call NAT.\n\n419\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.550\nNetwork Address Translation.\n\n420\n00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.850\nIt doesn't tend to actually\nlike the use of NAT.\n\n421\n00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.990\nAnd so,\nwhen you start doing stuff like that,\n\n422\n00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.940\nwell now you start having other issues.\n\n423\n00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.260\nIt's better for just a straight point to\npoint connection like between two routers\n\n424\n00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.960\nthan it is for\nthings like what I was showing you.\n\n425\n00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.800\nThe client side type of VPN connection.\n\n426\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.360\nCan you use it?\n\n427\n00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:47.980\nYes.\n\n428\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.880\nCan that NAT reversal stuff be overcome?\n\n429\n00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.530\nYes.\n\n430\n00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.592\nBut at the same time,\nit's not something that you can just say,\n\n431\n00:20:53.592 --> 00:20:56.840\nall right, I know this is your\nfirst day on the this computer.\n\n432\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.200\nWe're gonna set up a VPN connection,\n\n433\n00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.820\nthat's gonna be the most\ncomplex one we can set up.\n\n434\n00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.000\nThat usually requires\na little bit more so,\n\n435\n00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.530\nit's not really done\nvery easily on the fly.\n\n436\n00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:06.630\nSo, just kind of be aware of that.\n\n437\n00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.010\nOf all those issues that\nwe have faced here,\n\n438\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.260\nthat one is probably gonna\nbe the most complex.\n\n439\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.557\nShould we use PPTP?\n\n440\n00:21:13.557 --> 00:21:15.400\nNot in a production network.\n\n441\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.450\nIn testing environments, perfectly fine.\n\n442\n00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.830\nBut, it is a weaker type of\nencryption that we have there.\n\n443\n00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.490\nSo if you're gonna use any other ones,\n\n444\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.950\nMicrosoft recommends the version two\nbecause they love that VPN reconnect.\n\n445\n00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:32.310\nSSTP, very popular because, well we're\nnot opening up another firewall port.\n\n446\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.040\nBut all the other ones,\n\n447\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.800\nwe do have to open up something to\nallow that connection to come through.\n\n448\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.660\nSo just pay attention to some of\nthe quirkiness that's involved when you\n\n449\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.090\nare having to deal with\nthis type of connection.\n\n450\n00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.100\n>> And\nlet me make sure I got that right then.\n\n451\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.681\nL2TP, Layer Two Tunnelling Protocol,\nis port 1701 by default.\n\n452\n00:21:48.681 --> 00:21:50.263\nOf course, it can be changed.\n\n453\n00:21:50.263 --> 00:21:53.251\nPPTP, Point-to-Point Tunnelling Protocol,\n\n454\n00:21:53.251 --> 00:21:56.760\nIs the 1723 by default again,\nthat can be changed.\n\n455\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.036\nAnd Ronnie, it seems like when it\ncomes to configuring these VPNs, or\n\n456\n00:22:00.036 --> 00:22:02.670\ntroubleshooting the client\nside of the VPNs.\n\n457\n00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.530\nOne, I'm gonna have to know\nsome information, right?\n\n458\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.990\n>> Right.\n>> Because I'm looking at the client side,\n\n459\n00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:11.200\nbut there's a server responding to these\nrequests, and it has to be configured.\n\n460\n00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.139\nBoth sides have to agree, right?\n\n461\n00:22:13.139 --> 00:22:15.854\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If that server is set up to accept\n\n462\n00:22:15.854 --> 00:22:20.313\nIKEv2 connections, but\nmachine is configured to use PPTP,\n\n463\n00:22:20.313 --> 00:22:23.590\nwe're not gonna be able to connect, right?\n\n464\n00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.530\nSo part of that trouble shooting is\nknowing the information about your\n\n465\n00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.930\ncompany's VPN server.\n\n466\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.620\n>> There's no doubt on that one.\n\n467\n00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:35.020\nAnd also on top of that, right, if your\ncompany also requires authentication,\n\n468\n00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.980\nknowing the right authentication protocol\nto choose, too, is also another big one.\n\n469\n00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.250\n>> Yeah cuz each one of those tunnelling\nprotocols typically supports multiple\n\n470\n00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.514\nauthentication protocols.\n\n471\n00:22:43.514 --> 00:22:48.625\nI can use like, with L2TP or\nsomething like that, we can do EAP TLS,\n\n472\n00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:53.780\nor MS-CHAP v2, or just MS-CHAP,\nor several different ones.\n\n473\n00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.350\nAgain, knowing what you're company\nhas decided is required, so\n\n474\n00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.960\nthat you can configure the client\nto match and connect to it.\n\n475\n00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.590\n>> And this is gonna be very\nimportant in the future, you know,\n\n476\n00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:07.560\nthat we all at least get used to\nsetting up a little bit of it.\n\n477\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.270\nIt doesn't mean you have\nto be a master at it, but\n\n478\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.110\nat least being able to troubleshoot and\ngo.\n\n479\n00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.610\nHere's some of the reasons why it's not\nworking the way you think it should.\n\n480\n00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.570\nAnd seeing what you can do about\nthat is really gonna be the key for\n\n481\n00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.050\nmost network technicians.\n\n482\n00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.920\nSo, when we are supporting them, people\nare gonna be on laptops that are doing\n\n483\n00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.140\nthis and say, I don't know why\nmy VPN is not working, and\n\n484\n00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.550\nthey're gonna bring it in and\nexpect you to troubleshoot it.\n\n485\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.960\nVerify the information that\nyou have on the server side,\n\n486\n00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.830\nmake sure it matches up to what's\non their computers in the way\n\n487\n00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.940\nthat we have it in that\nnetwork connections.\n\n488\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.330\nAnd we should be ready to go.\n\n489\n00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.330\n>> And probably one more thing we ought to\nthrow in is verifying connectivity, right?\n\n490\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.180\nThat's one of the things that can be\neasily overlooked when troubleshooting\n\n491\n00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.400\na VPN connection.\n\n492\n00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.970\nIs I could spend hours trying to figure\nout why I can't connect to that server,\n\n493\n00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.610\nI'm checking authentication,\nI'm checking tunnelling types.\n\n494\n00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.270\nLooking at all this stuff and\n\n495\n00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.850\ncome to find out, I can't ping the VPN\nserver in the first place, right?\n\n496\n00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.280\nSo make sure you're checking\nyour network activity.\n\n497\n00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.510\n>> Yeah, there's sometimes where\neven on your VPN connections,\n\n498\n00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:07.140\nlike we said, it really depends on the\nconfiguration of what's going to happen.\n\n499\n00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.510\nIf now through that VPN connection,\n\n500\n00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.520\nlet me show you what I'm talking\nabout here on my screen.\n\n501\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.650\nI went ahead and made my connection\nusing my PPTP connection.\n\n502\n00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.270\nI know if I say that more often\nI'm gonna start giggling here.\n\n503\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:22.120\nIf I right click and go to status and\nclick on details, you'll notice that there\n\n504\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.530\nis some information missing,\nsuch as, the default gateway.\n\n505\n00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.400\nSo it actually is saying that I'm not\ngonna tunnel through to the other side,\n\n506\n00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.110\nand then connect outbound,\nwhich is probably a good thing.\n\n507\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.020\nBut if you do make some\nof these connections,\n\n508\n00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.210\nlike on L2TP, you may find it actually\nsaying, look, you are actually gonna\n\n509\n00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.970\nconnect through here to make every\nconnection, even out to the Internet.\n\n510\n00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.020\nSo you're actually going back\nthrough your company, and\n\n511\n00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.555\nthen connecting outbound as well.\n\n512\n00:24:44.555 --> 00:24:45.930\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n513\n00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.992\n>> That's how I used to get high\nspeed Internet access before I had it\n\n514\n00:24:48.992 --> 00:24:49.670\nat the house.\n\n515\n00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.130\nI'd go through the company and back out.\n\n516\n00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:51.830\nDon't do that.\n\n517\n00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:52.745\nThey frown upon that.\n\n518\n00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:53.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.221\nYou may actually have to make sure and\nsee why that might be happening.\n\n520\n00:24:57.221 --> 00:24:59.111\nIf you do get the default\ngateway through them,\n\n521\n00:24:59.111 --> 00:25:01.200\nit's probably the reason\nwhat's going on as well.\n\n522\n00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.450\nSo there are many different\ntypes of connections.\n\n523\n00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.190\nI set this one up because it\nwas the easiest one to set up.\n\n524\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.770\nBut then when you're actually done, all\nyou have to do is just simply disconnect.\n\n525\n00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.806\nAnd there it is.\nThe VPN connection is now down and gone.\n\n526\n00:25:12.806 --> 00:25:16.680\nBut just kind of realize all them\nare gonna take some form of some setup.\n\n527\n00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.090\nAnd this is true whether\nyou're using this one or\n\n528\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.930\nalso whether you're actually\nusing some third-party utility.\n\n529\n00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:25.090\nThe great thing about the third-party\nutility is normally, somebody higher up is\n\n530\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.140\nactually the one that's configuring it and\nsaying, this should work for\n\n531\n00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.280\neverybody, and they're the ones\nthat are handing them out,\n\n532\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.270\nand all we have to do is get it on the\nmachine, and we're off and ready to go.\n\n533\n00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.510\n>> All right, very good, Ronnie.\n\n534\n00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.720\nA lot of great information there.\n\n535\n00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.138\nTroubleshooting those VPN connections,\n\n536\n00:25:37.138 --> 00:25:40.495\nimportant part of maintaining\nthese Windows 7 boxes, but\n\n537\n00:25:40.495 --> 00:25:44.805\nthat is gonna do it for this episode,\nso I hope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n538\n00:25:44.805 --> 00:25:47.250\nSigning off for ITProTV i'm Mike Roderick.\n\n539\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:47.889\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n540\n00:25:47.889 --> 00:25:50.597\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n541\n00:25:50.597 --> 00:25:55.200\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:15.510\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.445\nWith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:18.330\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.215\n>> I am doing great today.\n\n7\n00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:21.285\nIt's another great day to be\nright here in the studio.\n\n8\n00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.698\nWe are continuing on taking\nthat supporting Windows 7.\n\n9\n00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:27.818\nAnd in this series, right,\nwe're not really exam focused as\n\n10\n00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:30.879\nmuch as what we want to do is make\nsure that you understand that\n\n11\n00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:35.380\nthere are several issues that you will\nencounter as enterprise level technicians.\n\n12\n00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.330\nAnd so this is from\nthe standpoint of just saying,\n\n13\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.680\nhey, here's some stuff\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n14\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.844\nAnd I wanna make sure that\nyou understand it as well.\n\n15\n00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:45.823\nAnd so today, we are really focusing\non the application side of things,\n\n16\n00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:50.170\nsome more third party things that could\nend up happening to our machines.\n\n17\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.690\nWe know that running\nWindows is perfectly fine.\n\n18\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.050\nBut now we add in another element,\nand that's when things can go wrong.\n\n19\n00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.604\n>> Absolutely.\n\n20\n00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:59.266\nWhen we talk about software\ninstallation issues, Ronnie,\n\n21\n00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.150\nit's something we deal with all the time.\n\n22\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.480\nOur users are calling us up and saying,\nhey, I tried to install this program.\n\n23\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.700\nAnd it's not working,\nI'm getting these errors.\n\n24\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.530\nSo, what are some of the common causes for\nthat type of error, Ronnie?\n\n25\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.610\n>> Well when we start taking a look\nat the idea of applications, right,\n\n26\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.550\none of the errors that\nreally does come and\n\n27\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.620\ngets involved with it,\nis really at the very beginning.\n\n28\n00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.160\nIt's nice to get new software.\n\n29\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.290\nEverybody's all, oh, I'm excited about\ninstalling this piece of software.\n\n30\n00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.356\nAnd the problem happens during that point,\nduring the installation of the software.\n\n31\n00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:30.805\nAnd you might be wondering like,\n\n32\n00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:33.771\nwhat in the world could be going\non with the software installation?\n\n33\n00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:36.440\nSo it doesn't matter what\nsoftware that you have.\n\n34\n00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.000\nWhat are some of the problems that we deal\nwith right at the time of installation\n\n35\n00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.845\nis what can end up happening.\n\n36\n00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:44.059\nWell, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at a couple of them.\n\n37\n00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:46.240\nAnd they're fairly easy for\nus to figure out.\n\n38\n00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.680\nBut let's go ahead and\nshow you what we're talking about.\n\n39\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.944\nSo here it is.\nI'm on my Windows 7 machine.\n\n40\n00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:54.305\nAnd I went ahead and downloaded,\nlet's say, a couple of well,\n\n41\n00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:56.680\ndifferent applications right here.\n\n42\n00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.250\nSo I have one called SharedView.\n\n43\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.900\nI have another one here called\n7-Zip that I've downloaded.\n\n44\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.800\nAnd so what normally ends up happening is\nan end user goes ahead and downloads this.\n\n45\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.109\nAnd then they begin to\ninstall the process here.\n\n46\n00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:11.300\nAnd that actually begins install,\nand they can walk through it,\n\n47\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.900\nwhich is normally gonna be fine\nin what we actually need to do.\n\n48\n00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.820\nBut sometimes what ends up happening\nthough is that it can't actually install.\n\n49\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.120\nSo, if you do have an issue like\nthat where it comes to that point,\n\n50\n00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.210\nusually the problem happens to be, well,\n\n51\n00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.680\nmore than anything, a permission issue is\nwhat we're generally taking look at here.\n\n52\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.279\nSo, if the use does have the proper\npermissions to be able to install,\n\n53\n00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:34.375\nthen they can.\n\n54\n00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:36.505\nIf they don't,\nthey may actually have to be,\n\n55\n00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:40.355\nthey may have to elevate their privileges\nso that they can install software.\n\n56\n00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:43.535\nNow this one obviously, it looks like\nthat we could've actually install that.\n\n57\n00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:45.140\nI'm don't wanna install that right now.\n\n58\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.780\nBut we could actually do that.\n\n59\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.740\nBut you may find out that it may be the\nend user's own level of permissions more\n\n60\n00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.030\nthan anything else that is preventing\nthem from that installation.\n\n61\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.634\n>> This is something that has\nchanged over the last few years.\n\n62\n00:02:56.634 --> 00:03:00.928\nIt was very common practice years ago\nwhere to have our users be administrators\n\n63\n00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:03.020\non their local machine, right?\n\n64\n00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.080\nIn a domain environment,\n\n65\n00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.590\nthey wouldn't have any elevated\ncredentials within the domain.\n\n66\n00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.750\nBut on their local machine,\nthey would be an administrator.\n\n67\n00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.688\nSo they could install software and\nthings like that.\n\n68\n00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:13.950\nAnd then we got smarter.\n\n69\n00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.050\nWe realized that as an administrator, they\ncould do lots of things to that machine.\n\n70\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.090\nThey can end up getting themselves in\ntrouble, either unintentionally or\n\n71\n00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.614\neven maliciously, so\nwe've kind of changed our game, right?\n\n72\n00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:28.344\nWe've said, all right, now everybody's\ngonna be just a standard user.\n\n73\n00:03:28.344 --> 00:03:32.835\nAnd you might have an administrative\naccount that you could do a run as with,\n\n74\n00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:34.460\nbut most likely not.\n\n75\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.090\nUsers aren't used to that,\nbecause at their home,\n\n76\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.540\nthey can just download something and\ninstall it, like Ronnie said.\n\n77\n00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.163\nThey get to work.\n\n78\n00:03:40.163 --> 00:03:42.880\nThey download, try to install it and\neverything goes wrong.\n\n79\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.190\nAnd it's because their credentials or\ntheir permissions aren't there.\n\n80\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.910\n>> Now when we start\ndealing with those issues,\n\n81\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.510\nwell, what can we actually try and do?\n\n82\n00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.900\nAgain depends on where we\nare in the enterprise, right?\n\n83\n00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.207\nIf we are just part of that\nActive Directory domain,\n\n84\n00:03:58.207 --> 00:04:02.941\nthere may not be anything that we can do\nright then to help that end user out,\n\n85\n00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.267\nunless I have more privileges or\nmore credentials.\n\n86\n00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:06.990\n>> Right, permissions.\n\n87\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.470\n>> Yeah, more permissions, I couldn't\nremember what word I was gonna use there.\n\n88\n00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.830\nSo unless my privileges are higher or\nI have enough permissions to install that,\n\n89\n00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.530\nwell then I may not be\nable to help them out.\n\n90\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.080\nAt that point, it is an escalation issue.\n\n91\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.450\nSo if I'm just there as a support\ntechnician, I'm gonna say, look,\n\n92\n00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.480\nI can't install this application.\n\n93\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.320\nWell, it actually gives you\nthe ability where it says hey, for\n\n94\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.680\nyou to install this, you need to actually\nbe able to run this as the administrator.\n\n95\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.670\nWell, you can try that option instead and\nthat may help.\n\n96\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.440\nLet's take a look at what we're talking\nabout just in case you don't know.\n\n97\n00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.050\nMost of us do at this point,\nbut it's a good reminder.\n\n98\n00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.410\nSo let's take for an example that\nthis application wouldn't run.\n\n99\n00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.057\nWell, if I right-click on that one,\n\n100\n00:04:44.057 --> 00:04:47.568\nlet me see where can I actually find that\nrun as administrator option right here?\n\n101\n00:04:47.568 --> 00:04:48.590\n>> Sometimes you gotta Shift\nright-click on that guy.\n\n102\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.938\n>> Oh yeah, that's right, I forgot that.\n\n103\n00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:54.586\nYeah, if I Shift and right-click and-\n>> Fourth one down.\n\n104\n00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:55.840\n>> Fourth one down, very good.\n\n105\n00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.815\n>> That's a good little pointer,\nsometimes Windows is weird.\n\n106\n00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:00.573\nSometimes you right click on something,\nand\n\n107\n00:05:00.573 --> 00:05:02.960\nyou will see the Run as\nAdministrator right there.\n\n108\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.806\nIf you don't see it,\nhold down Shift and right-click on it,\n\n109\n00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:10.070\nyou'll get a slightly different context\nmenu and sometimes that option is there.\n\n110\n00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.020\n>> Now, this actually brings up\nanother good point for us, Mike.\n\n111\n00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.870\nThe reason that we actually\nsee this right here.\n\n112\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.350\nYou're saying, well,\nRonnie said Run as Administrator.\n\n113\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.230\nBut this one just says,\nRun as a different user.\n\n114\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.540\nNow we used to see this all the time,\nbefore the days of Windows 7, right?\n\n115\n00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.150\nWhen you actually saw this type\nof menu system kind of pop up, so\n\n116\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.130\nmost everything today says\nRun as Administrator.\n\n117\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.280\nBut this one just says\nRun as a different user.\n\n118\n00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.110\nSo, Mike, when did we actually\nsee something like this instead?\n\n119\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.310\n>> I don't remember seeing\nit all that often, actually.\n\n120\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.810\n>> Yeah, and so you might be wondering\nlike, well this was kind of pre\n\n121\n00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.780\nthe Windows 2003 and the Windows XP days,\nis when we would actually seen this.\n\n122\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.607\nSo this program installer, well, it might\nhave other issues that are involved in it.\n\n123\n00:05:54.607 --> 00:05:57.717\nBut one of the issues that\nwe're actually seeing here is,\n\n124\n00:05:57.717 --> 00:06:01.398\nwow I haven't seen a menu system that\nlooked like this in a long time,\n\n125\n00:06:01.398 --> 00:06:04.140\nwhere it actually says,\nRun as a different user.\n\n126\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.480\nBut if I select that, now I can see\nwhat I'm expecting to find here,\n\n127\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.140\nwhich is gonna be, of course,\nan elevation of those privileges.\n\n128\n00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.451\nSo say hey,\nwho's actually gonna be able to run this?\n\n129\n00:06:13.451 --> 00:06:17.610\nAnd I simply, at this point here,\ngo ahead and type in my credentials.\n\n130\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.985\nI should put on my glasses.\n\n131\n00:06:18.985 --> 00:06:21.724\n[LAUGH] So\nI can actually see what's going on.\n\n132\n00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:23.047\nAnd now it says, wait a minute.\n\n133\n00:06:23.047 --> 00:06:26.030\nYou may not have the appropriate\npermissions to run this item.\n\n134\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.464\nSo let me try that one more\ntime cuz it might've been me.\n\n135\n00:06:28.464 --> 00:06:29.860\nOop, I selected Uninstall.\n\n136\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.789\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can't uninstall a product that\n\n137\n00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.390\nI haven't done yet.\n\n138\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.029\nSo let me run as a different user, lab.\n\n139\n00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.422\nAnd this is gonna be Ronnie.\n\n140\n00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:40.690\nAnd do that.\n\n141\n00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.649\nWell, there we go.\n\n142\n00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:44.270\nNow we're actually starting\nto see something else here.\n\n143\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.010\nThis program may be so old that it doesn't\nlike the way that I've done this for\n\n144\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.160\none reason or another.\n\n145\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.679\nNow, we weren't having really\nany issues with that one.\n\n146\n00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.535\nBut since I'm actually a domain\nadmin on this machine,\n\n147\n00:06:55.535 --> 00:06:59.204\nsays you may not have the appropriate\npermissions to access this item.\n\n148\n00:06:59.204 --> 00:07:03.819\nWell, I don't understand it except that\nyou may also run into compatibility issues\n\n149\n00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:05.770\nlike this even during the install.\n\n150\n00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.134\nNow this one will install just\nfine if I select and run it.\n\n151\n00:07:09.134 --> 00:07:11.721\nBut trying to run it as\nthe administrator on this one,\n\n152\n00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:14.667\nit really did not like it at all,\nwhich is a little bit funny.\n\n153\n00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:18.810\nBut it can happen when you actually see\nsomething like this right in place.\n\n154\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.840\nSo in that instance here you may actually\nhave to do something else that we don't\n\n155\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.140\nreally want to actually talk about,\n\n156\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.187\nwhich is maybe that's not the program for\nthis particular machine.\n\n157\n00:07:28.187 --> 00:07:31.760\nYou may actually want to go ahead and\nactually go right, either escalate\n\n158\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.720\nthe issue, now look, this program,\nlet's see if somebody else knows about it.\n\n159\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.301\nSo I might escalate\nthe issue over to Mike.\n\n160\n00:07:37.301 --> 00:07:40.734\nMike says, oh yeah,\nwe've used it in the past, but\n\n161\n00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:44.740\nthis is the program that\nwe're using today instead.\n\n162\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.830\nAnd it may be that we look for\na replacement, right?\n\n163\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.620\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n164\n00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.142\nWe might find that that's\na little older version.\n\n165\n00:07:50.142 --> 00:07:55.055\nMaybe they put out a new version that's a\nlittle more compatible with that UAC that\n\n166\n00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:57.131\nWindows 7 is trying to use there.\n\n167\n00:07:57.131 --> 00:08:01.366\nSo, definitely want to take a look and see\nif there's a Newer version of the program\n\n168\n00:08:01.366 --> 00:08:03.494\nif you're having installation issues.\n\n169\n00:08:03.494 --> 00:08:06.316\n>> Yeah, well these installation\nissues that can happen,\n\n170\n00:08:06.316 --> 00:08:10.490\nthere's two of them that really right\naway that we just talked about.\n\n171\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.122\nMore than likely, if it's an end user,\n\n172\n00:08:12.122 --> 00:08:15.200\nthey probably aren't that administrator\non the machine, and normally if you're\n\n173\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.790\ngonna be installing a piece of software\non that machine, it's gonna make\n\n174\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.210\nchanges to the system, they need to\nactually have administrative privileges.\n\n175\n00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.180\nIf they don't, that's where you might come\nin or where you might have to escalate.\n\n176\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.100\nSecondly, that program may be so old\nthat it really tries to bypass that UAC\n\n177\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.940\ntype of configuration,\nthe User Account Control.\n\n178\n00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.100\nWell, at that point\nwhat Mike's mentioning,\n\n179\n00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.850\nwell what can we do about that?\n\n180\n00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.690\nWell it depends, once again,\non the system and whether or\n\n181\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.330\nnot we've actually locked it down or not.\n\n182\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.870\n>> Yeah, and Microsoft tries to help us,\nright Ronnie?\n\n183\n00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.540\nIf we go out and purchase software,\nthere are ways that we can\n\n184\n00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.970\ndetermine before we get it whether\nit's gonna run on my machine.\n\n185\n00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.470\n>> There are.\n\n186\n00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.840\nIf you actually take a look, Microsoft\ndid publish an entire list of some of\n\n187\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.910\nthe ones, that when they actually made\nthe software during the days when Windows\n\n188\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.300\n7 was actually making software, or\nvendors were actually making software for\n\n189\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.860\nWindows 7,\nI will get that straight at some point.\n\n190\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.200\nWhen they did it, they said look,\nwhy don't you do this,\n\n191\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.550\nso that we know that it's all compatible?\n\n192\n00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.550\nIs that they actually said,\nlook you can submit it for\n\n193\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.230\nwhat we call Windows 7 logo testing.\n\n194\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.910\nAnd when you submit it for Windows 7 logo\ntesting, the vendors did, they actually\n\n195\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.440\nmade sure that they went through\nthe anti-virus checks that they needed to.\n\n196\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.400\nBut more importantly is something\nthat Mike mentioned, that UAC.\n\n197\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.260\nAnd the reason why that's important is\nbecause they also implemented a program\n\n198\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.610\nwhere the software did not actually\nget to touch those protected files.\n\n199\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.160\nWhereas before,\nif you actually installed a program and\n\n200\n00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.260\nit needed to go into System32 and go,\noh no, we wanna modify this version.\n\n201\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.140\nWe've kinda tweaked this little DLL here.\n\n202\n00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.910\nWindows just said, sure, why not.\n\n203\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:48.770\nGo ahead and tweak it.\n\n204\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.720\nAnd then you actually\ninstalled another program, and\n\n205\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.960\nit wanted to tweak it back the other way,\nyou could cause other issues too.\n\n206\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.930\nSo this is where it's actually very\nimportant for these Windows logo testing.\n\n207\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.680\nSo it also did that where it said look,\nthe way that you actually do\n\n208\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.190\nthis is because of the way\nthat the system works today.\n\n209\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.930\nIf you want it to actually\nwork without any flaws and\n\n210\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.330\nany problems, submit it for\nthat Windows 7 logo testing.\n\n211\n00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.960\nYou might have seen back then,\nwhen you actually went into brick and\n\n212\n00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.130\nmortar stores, and\nstarted buying software off the shelf.\n\n213\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.270\nAnd Mike, I can't remember the last time,\n\n214\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.680\nI'm trying to think, last time I actually\nsaid, I'm gonna go into a store and\n\n215\n00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.280\nbuy the software box itself and\nget all excited.\n\n216\n00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.280\nI don't remember the last\ntime that happened.\n\n217\n00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:29.880\n>> I don't either.\n\n218\n00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.640\nBut I do remember going through those\naisles, looking at all that software, and\n\n219\n00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.880\nalways paying attention to those\nlogos in that bottom corner.\n\n220\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.400\nBecause I'm running Windows 7 and\n\n221\n00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.420\nI wanna make sure that this\nis gonna run on Windows 7.\n\n222\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.260\nThat used to be just an everyday\npart of buying software was to make\n\n223\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.490\nsure it had been tested.\n\n224\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.220\n>> Yeah, and you've probably even\nseen it on the hardware machines too.\n\n225\n00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.130\nI remember having a laptop that actually\ndid have the little Windows 7 logo,\n\n226\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.280\nlike, ready for Windows 7 or\nwhatever it was.\n\n227\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.440\nAnd it was right there and I was so\nproud of that little logo.\n\n228\n00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.740\nAnd I know, ironically, I was actually\nproud of my little Vista logo too.\n\n229\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.390\nSo I did have one for that and\nthey had that for the software testing.\n\n230\n00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.530\nSo if you wanna make sure\nthat it is compatible for\n\n231\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.380\nWindows 7, then you had to do that.\n\n232\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.522\nNow, the problem where we would have\nissues with that is in line of business\n\n233\n00:11:16.522 --> 00:11:18.969\napplications that would not actually run.\n\n234\n00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:22.308\nNow, the nice this is that by\nthe time that Windows 7 came out,\n\n235\n00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:25.087\nwe really didn't have a ton\nof application issues.\n\n236\n00:11:25.087 --> 00:11:28.113\nThere may have been a few that stuck out,\nbut not so\n\n237\n00:11:28.113 --> 00:11:32.656\nmany as the previous operating system,\nthat transition from XP to Vista,\n\n238\n00:11:32.656 --> 00:11:35.249\nhad a lot more issues\nto it than what we had,\n\n239\n00:11:35.249 --> 00:11:40.400\neven going from Windows XP to Windows 7 it\nseemed to work out much better, instead.\n\n240\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.050\n>> Yeah.\nYou know, the vendors had a chance.\n\n241\n00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.400\nVista was a big change in the way\nsecurity was handled in the background\n\n242\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.744\nfrom the days of Windows XP, so\nvendors needed some time to catch up and\n\n243\n00:11:49.744 --> 00:11:53.130\nrewrite their software to work\nwith things like the UAC,\n\n244\n00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.490\nvirtualized registry sections,\nand things like that.\n\n245\n00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.210\nSo by the time we get to Windows 7, most\nof these vendors had figured it out and\n\n246\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.730\nthey could write software\nthat ran no problem.\n\n247\n00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.000\nOr modify their program that\nused to run on Windows XP\n\n248\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.210\nto run on Windows 7 no problem, so Vista\nwas, albeit a little bit of a struggle,\n\n249\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.960\nbut it was an important step, right?\n\n250\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.240\nIt definitely served its purpose.\n\n251\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.620\nI know I ran Windows Vista\n\n252\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.610\nprobably as well Ronnie-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.680\n>> So don't feel too bad.\n\n254\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.450\nAll right, now other things with our\nsoftware, sometimes when we buy software,\n\n255\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.220\nwe've gotta make sure that we get it\nfrom somebody that we trust, right?\n\n256\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.030\n>> This is one of the key things,\nespecially in today's day and\n\n257\n00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.970\nage, where we aren't going out and\n\n258\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.620\nbuying the software out of the box that\nwe know came from the manufacturer.\n\n259\n00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.550\nThe vendor said, look, we need to\nmanufacture this and it was sealed and\n\n260\n00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.810\nit was locked up and everything else,\nand then you get your own copy of them.\n\n261\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.210\nToday where we actually get\nall of our software from\n\n262\n00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.600\nis pretty much an internet\ndownload in some way some how.\n\n263\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.660\nAnd the problem that you and\nI have then is that there isn't\n\n264\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.180\nan actual seal that says nobody's\nmessed with the software.\n\n265\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.250\nIt didn't come directly from the factory.\n\n266\n00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:05.690\nIt may be that it actually is at the\nfactory, but how do you know that, right?\n\n267\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.830\nSo here it is, I'm sitting on my machine\nand I see that right there is the software\n\n268\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.220\nthat I want and I wanna go and\ndownload it right then and there.\n\n269\n00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.340\nWell, how do I know that it came\nfrom that particular company?\n\n270\n00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.460\nAnd the way that we do that,\nof course, is we verify that,\n\n271\n00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.050\nhey, here is the publisher\nthat's out there.\n\n272\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.060\nAnd we might also be able to use things\nlike digital certificates to help us out.\n\n273\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.170\nAnd that's what we talk about as well,\neven with software,\n\n274\n00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:33.540\nis that we have to have some type\nof trusted way that we can do that.\n\n275\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.010\nSo a lot of times the software does have\nwhat we call digital signing attached to\n\n276\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:42.250\nit to verify that that's what you're\nactually gonna download as well.\n\n277\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.110\nNow if you do get it from a trusted\npublisher, that is the key.\n\n278\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.800\nOr a trusted source of what we have\nto deal with for downloading and\n\n279\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.050\nthen installing.\n\n280\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.510\nBut the problem is there's so\nmany download sites.\n\n281\n00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.640\nAnd that's where the issue is.\n\n282\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.970\nThat even if it looks official, right?\n\n283\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.865\nYou gotta take a look at the name,\ncuz if not, you'll end up in one of those\n\n284\n00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:04.160\nthird-party downloads, and I've done that,\njust looking at, I'm like, oh yes,\n\n285\n00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.550\nit says in bold print whatever\nit is that I wanna download.\n\n286\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.375\nSo I click on it,\non that first link and go, well,\n\n287\n00:14:11.375 --> 00:14:13.945\nit almost looks like the official one.\n\n288\n00:14:13.945 --> 00:14:16.575\nBut, then, this is how I always tell.\n\n289\n00:14:16.575 --> 00:14:18.290\nIf I have to hunt for the download button,\n\n290\n00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.385\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay?\n\n291\n00:14:19.385 --> 00:14:20.385\nIf I have to hunt for\n\n292\n00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:23.555\nwhere to download that software and\nI'm seeing download, download, download,\n\n293\n00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:25.835\ndownload.\nBut then, I look and that's downloading\n\n294\n00:14:25.835 --> 00:14:28.510\nsomething else and that's downloading\nsomething else, then I know\n\n295\n00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.830\nthat's probably not gonna be the place\nI really wanna download software from.\n\n296\n00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.050\n>> Yeah, it's a very easy way for\n\n297\n00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:39.170\nbad guys to get things on your computer\nis to slip it into some bit of code.\n\n298\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:44.200\nLike software, or updates, or drivers,\nand then offer free downloads.\n\n299\n00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.380\nIf it's too good to be true\n[LAUGH] it probably is.\n\n300\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.380\nSo, you've gotta be careful with that.\n\n301\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.310\nOr at least you've gotta pay attention\nto where you're getting it from.\n\n302\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.180\nMake sure it's somebody that you trust,\nsomebody that's known.\n\n303\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.010\nAnd like Ronnie said,\n\n304\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.890\nif it's digitally signed, that's a great\nway I can verify who that publisher is,\n\n305\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.670\nas well as the fact that that code hasn't\nbeen modified and there's no malware\n\n306\n00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.970\nslipped in since the time that\nthe author of that software composed it.\n\n307\n00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.185\n>> Yeah, and it's kind of neat, right?\n\n308\n00:15:11.185 --> 00:15:14.760\nThe very fact are that the legitimate\nvendors, right, when they actually do\n\n309\n00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.130\nissue the software out, they're\nprobably gonna get it digitally signed.\n\n310\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.410\nThey're gonna make sure that their\nmachines, of course, are actually\n\n311\n00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.930\ngetting third party certificates on\ntheir machines when you connect to them.\n\n312\n00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.980\nSo that means they're\ngonna be fairly trusted\n\n313\n00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.330\ncertificate authorities\nthat are out there.\n\n314\n00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.920\nAnd usually that means they're gonna also\nappear in your trusted root authorities,\n\n315\n00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.790\nas well, when you download that\nsoftware and you see that.\n\n316\n00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:42.870\nSo if all the sudden it's saying look,\nhere it is, but there's no seal on it.\n\n317\n00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.947\nThere's no digital certificate with it,\nyou may have to deal with that as well.\n\n318\n00:15:45.947 --> 00:15:48.863\nNow that doesn't mean that you\ncan't install software that way,\n\n319\n00:15:48.863 --> 00:15:52.298\nbut usually if you wanna actually make\nsure that you do get one that's made sure\n\n320\n00:15:52.298 --> 00:15:55.527\nthat they went through whatever testing\nthat they've tried to verify and\n\n321\n00:15:55.527 --> 00:15:57.451\ncheck it Is you wanna\nmake sure that you go for\n\n322\n00:15:57.451 --> 00:16:00.874\nthose that are what we call the Trusted\nPublishers that are out there as well.\n\n323\n00:16:00.874 --> 00:16:05.059\n>> And Ronnie, another issue that we\ncan run into with the applications,\n\n324\n00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:08.350\nnot as much nowadays, but\nI've definitely seen this.\n\n325\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.510\nYou download some software.\n\n326\n00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.970\nYou have to extract it out, because\nit's in this cab file or a zip file.\n\n327\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.450\nOr something like that.\n\n328\n00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.030\nAnd then somebody gives you\nan executable and says, here.\n\n329\n00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.240\nHere's the program you can install.\n\n330\n00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.230\nYou go to run it.\n\n331\n00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.010\nAnd it fails.\n\n332\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.350\nIt looks like it's looking for\nsomething else.\n\n333\n00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.190\n>> And this is where it does become\nimportant, especially for today.\n\n334\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.580\nAt some time, right?\n\n335\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.820\nWhat they stopped doing is saying, look,\nhere's the download and you see it and\n\n336\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.340\ngo like, eight gigs on a single download?\n\n337\n00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.590\nYou kinda get a little bit iffy about it.\n\n338\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.380\nAnd I'm not saying you can't download it.\n\n339\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.590\nBut, what they've tried to do is\nactually kind of parcel it out, right?\n\n340\n00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.010\nSo, what you end up\ndownloading is an installer.\n\n341\n00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.700\nThat installer, you start it up,\nand when it actually starts up,\n\n342\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.160\nit is now talking back to the server\nsaying retrieve this information.\n\n343\n00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.460\nSo, that means a lot of times\nyou can't do what we used to do\n\n344\n00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.950\nwhich is just disconnect\nfrom the internet.\n\n345\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.950\nSo, it might be that you download that\ninstaller and this is where I always get\n\n346\n00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.770\ntripped up, right, is that, is I'm like oh\nyeah that's just software that I need, but\n\n347\n00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.940\nI don't have time to install it right now.\n\n348\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.900\nLet me just go ahead and download it and\nI download and wow, that was fast.\n\n349\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.110\nI'll install it later.\n\n350\n00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.080\nWell, I have a satellite internet\nconnection at home, and so\n\n351\n00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.640\nwhen I run that installer\nit really hangs up.\n\n352\n00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.760\nIt just sits there and\ngoes all right, here it is.\n\n353\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.680\nAnd then all of sudden what I see is\nduring that installation it says,\n\n354\n00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.740\ndownloading additional files.\n\n355\n00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.630\nWell, now if you do this over a satellite\ninstall, well good luck in that.\n\n356\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.610\nThat's another 46 hours that you're gonna\nactually spend downloading that thing,\n\n357\n00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.750\nbefore you're actually done.\n\n358\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.380\nAnd by that point,\n\n359\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.390\nyou're probably running out of your\nfair usage policy limit anyways.\n\n360\n00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.720\nSo, you do have to be careful when\nyou do see these things, right?\n\n361\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.780\nIf you go wait, here it is, here's the,\n\n362\n00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.180\nlet's say,\nI'm making this up as I go along here.\n\n363\n00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.940\nLet's say that this is one of those\nprograms that are designing for\n\n364\n00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.605\narchitecture, I can't\nremember what those are.\n\n365\n00:17:57.605 --> 00:17:59.931\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, CAD files and stuff, right?\n\n366\n00:17:59.931 --> 00:18:03.950\nAnd you go, oh cool, look at that,\nthere's a quick download for a CAD file.\n\n367\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.270\nYou download it and\nthree seconds later you're done.\n\n368\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.050\nWell, guess what, you probably\nhaven't downloaded the entire thing,\n\n369\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.650\nit's probably gonna ask\nthat you stay connected.\n\n370\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.810\nNow, if you are having an issue\nwhere that's happening,\n\n371\n00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.750\nit means you really do have\nto stay connected up there.\n\n372\n00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.970\nIn an enterprise, they're probably not\ngonna want something like that to happen.\n\n373\n00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.280\nSo, more than likely in that situation,\n\n374\n00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.060\nyou're gonna see that's gonna\nbe controlled by group policy.\n\n375\n00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.780\nNobody in an enterprise wants you just\ngoing, I think I'll download that now, and\n\n376\n00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.840\nthen connect directly to the internet,\ndownload gigs and\n\n377\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.740\ngigs of information to your computer.\n\n378\n00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.110\nSo, that you can sit and go,\nyeah, let me install right then.\n\n379\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.650\nThey're probably not gonna\nallow us to do that too much.\n\n380\n00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.350\nIt's gonna be very much\ncontrolled through group policy.\n\n381\n00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.030\n>> Other things we have to worry\nabout is where we're installing\n\n382\n00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.280\nthe application as well.\n\n383\n00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.130\n>> Yep.\nSometimes what also ends up happening here\n\n384\n00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.370\ntoo is that we don't know\nexactly where it installs.\n\n385\n00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.910\nAnd so older applications used to be able\nto pick wherever you wanted to install it.\n\n386\n00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.070\nWorks just fine.\n\n387\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.030\nSome of the newer ones though, they want\nto actually know where everything is and\n\n388\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.110\nwhere it actually installs, and even where\nthe source files come from sometimes.\n\n389\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.490\nThey're very specific, especially\nthe older applications that are out there.\n\n390\n00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.060\nSo, you do have to pay attention to\nwhere these things install from.\n\n391\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.840\nSometimes you might find out that\nyou can't actually install it from\n\n392\n00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.240\nwhere you think you can install it from,\nand this is another issue.\n\n393\n00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.830\nAll the sudden,\nit was in my network share.\n\n394\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.310\nI should be able to install\nit from there and it fails.\n\n395\n00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.400\nYou now go ahead and pull a copy from that\nfrom your network share down to your local\n\n396\n00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.460\ncomputer, installs just fine.\n\n397\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.440\nSo, even the source may\nactually be an indication like\n\n398\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.500\nI need it to expand out someplace.\n\n399\n00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.690\nAnd then that workshare wasn't actually\nallowing me access to where I needed to.\n\n400\n00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.540\nBut, now on your computer, I'm able to\ncreate whatever temp files that I need to.\n\n401\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.080\nI'm able to do whatever I need to,\n\n402\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.150\ninstead of having to realize\nwhere those sources are from.\n\n403\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.860\nAnd, then everything's actually looking\nat your directories here instead.\n\n404\n00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.914\nSo, it could be just the difference\nof just the location, and\n\n405\n00:19:52.914 --> 00:19:56.170\nalso where it's actually gonna try and\ninstall, too, as well.\n\n406\n00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.297\n>> Now, Ronnie, some of these programs,\nespecially the ones we have to pay for,\n\n407\n00:20:00.297 --> 00:20:04.070\nthey want to control how many times\nI go about installing that software.\n\n408\n00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.150\n>> No, they don't.\n\n409\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.170\n>> I know it's crazy right.\n\n410\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.380\nHey wait, I paid for it, I should be\nable to install it on everybody I want.\n\n411\n00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.450\nPut it on Ronnie's machine, I want to\nput it on all of my friends machines.\n\n412\n00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.890\nThat's not going to work right,\na lot of these programs nowadays\n\n413\n00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.710\ncheck that at the very beginning,\nso it could be another.\n\n414\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.890\nReason we can't install that software.\n\n415\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:24.390\n>> Yeah, and this is always been\nan unusual goal for all software makers.\n\n416\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.010\nRight?\n\n417\n00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.600\nThey thought that they'd had a handled,\nwhen here it is.\n\n418\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.290\nHere's my copy of Window 7 Ultimate.\n\n419\n00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:34.890\nSo, I know that there's a retail copy that\nsays I can put it on this many machines.\n\n420\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.980\nWell, after a while I just start going,\nwell, Mike, here's my key.\n\n421\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.130\nAnd Mike gets that.\n\n422\n00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.880\nAnd all of a sudden, I go, oh,\nI've gotta re-format my computer.\n\n423\n00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.360\nAnd now I can't install anymore.\n\n424\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.360\nAfter a while right,\n\n425\n00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.070\nyou run out of the ability to\nactivate those different copies.\n\n426\n00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.545\nBut the problem is, people have always\nbeen very, they had an ingenuity to\n\n427\n00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:57.593\nthem and they would figure out some\nway to get around this process and\n\n428\n00:20:57.593 --> 00:20:58.890\nmake it work, okay.\n\n429\n00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.009\nAnd so now, it's like that key,\n\n430\n00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:05.200\nas much as it helps in limiting\nthe amount that can be done.\n\n431\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.030\nSomeone that actually has some time on\ntheir hands,now I'm talking about an army\n\n432\n00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.120\nof hackers that now what they're\ndoing,then they can spend so much time in\n\n433\n00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.290\nfiguring out how to get around that system\nsomeway somehow,that it doesn't matter.\n\n434\n00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:22.290\nWindows XP is by far probably the most,\nhacked program.\n\n435\n00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.790\nAt the end of the value\nof what they have right.\n\n436\n00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.070\nThere was an edition called\nthe pirate edition of Windows XP.\n\n437\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:33.110\nThat I think actually was single, retail\ncopyright designed for that one computer.\n\n438\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:37.450\nI think they said it was installed\non over 100,000 machines.\n\n439\n00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:38.495\nIf you think about.\n\n440\n00:21:38.495 --> 00:21:42.930\nSo, somebody paid $150 for\nit back in 2001,\n\n441\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.570\n2002, and now it's on 100,000 machines.\n\n442\n00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:52.580\nSo, you divide that up, I think Microsoft\ngot like a penny maybe half a penny for\n\n443\n00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.410\nevery copy of that's out there.\n\n444\n00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.780\nWell, you can see why people get upset, so\ntoday what you're actually starting to see\n\n445\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.170\nof course is that they started\ndifferentiating, right?\n\n446\n00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.760\nYou can have what we call retail\nlicenses that are really designed for\n\n447\n00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.760\nyou, it's actually assigned to you, right?\n\n448\n00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.180\nSo, whatever limitation\nthey that they put on it.\n\n449\n00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.830\nMike, you can install on five machines.\n\n450\n00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.330\nPerfectly fine,\nthat's exactly what they want.\n\n451\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.500\nBut, then they also have\nenterprise licenses as well.\n\n452\n00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.580\nThat then they can install\nit on multiple machines, and\n\n453\n00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.980\nit actually is now a sign to well,\nthat company instead.\n\n454\n00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:28.490\nSo, it might be a limitation where it\nhas 500 licenses to that one company.\n\n455\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.116\nBut it could be instead, especially the\nway that Microsoft works with Windows 7,\n\n456\n00:22:32.116 --> 00:22:36.040\nis that there is what they call a kms,\na key management system and\n\n457\n00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.560\nwhat happens is that you build your\nown local activation server and\n\n458\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.650\nyes you get that key from Microsoft and\n\n459\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.110\nthen that way you're not actually reaching\nout to Microsoft to install as well.\n\n460\n00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.140\nSo, that way you can actually activate\nas many times as you want to,\n\n461\n00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.640\nas long as you keep your own key\nmanagement server running, and operating,\n\n462\n00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.340\nand doing what we need to.\n\n463\n00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.610\nBut, today they've even gone further than\nthat, which is to actually say, look,\n\n464\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.580\nhere's the way it's gonna be done, is\nwe're gonna control the software, itself.\n\n465\n00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.660\nAnd that means, like what I have\nin today's world of Office 365.\n\n466\n00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.240\nIt just says Ronnie, here's five licenses,\nyou do with it whatever you choose.\n\n467\n00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.160\nSo, if I say Mike you're\ngonna a copy of one.\n\n468\n00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.660\nWell, that's fine that means\nI'm now limited to four.\n\n469\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.360\nSo now if Mike goes, oh,\nwell Ronnie can I get one for so and so?\n\n470\n00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.590\nWell okay sure.\n\n471\n00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.250\nWell, now I'm limited to three.\n\n472\n00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.580\nAs long as the number never goes beyond\nfive Microsoft is saying, we don't care so\n\n473\n00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.530\nafter a while they says you're now limited\nfour so I have to take it off of one\n\n474\n00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.340\nof my machines if I want Mike's\nfriend to have another one.\n\n475\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.660\nNow, that's not the way that they want it,\nright?\n\n476\n00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.515\nThey're saying look it really\nis assigned to you Ronnie but\n\n477\n00:23:38.515 --> 00:23:41.780\nthe very fact is if you assign it\nto multiple people, that's fine.\n\n478\n00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.760\nBut, they can't give it away, right?\n\n479\n00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.800\nSo, the only way they can do it is\nby bringing their machine to me,\n\n480\n00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.260\nme signing in, downloading on their\nmachine, then going, activate.\n\n481\n00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.522\nAnd that's it.\nAs long as I don't go around doing that to\n\n482\n00:23:52.522 --> 00:23:56.156\nevery single machine on the planet, well\nI can but I'm only limited to five, so\n\n483\n00:23:56.156 --> 00:23:59.812\nI'd have to take it off of every other\nmachine and keep passing it down the line.\n\n484\n00:23:59.812 --> 00:24:02.032\nBut you're starting to see more and\nmore of that, so\n\n485\n00:24:02.032 --> 00:24:05.666\ncontrol of these things is normally the\nresponsibility, of course, of companies,\n\n486\n00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:08.100\nand that's what we should\nbe responsible for.\n\n487\n00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.110\nWe need to first take a look,\ndo we have the proper activation key or\n\n488\n00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:14.740\nnot, or\nthe licensing that we have to have?\n\n489\n00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.890\nIt's very easy for a small company to say,\nI'll just buy a retail copy,\n\n490\n00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.020\na small copy of it, and\nnot worry about it.\n\n491\n00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.860\nI'll put it on every\nmachine in my company.\n\n492\n00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.740\nBut what happens is after they do,\nlet's say, five or ten of them,\n\n493\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.970\nnow all of a sudden they go to\nactivate and now it says, hey,\n\n494\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.225\nyou've run out of activations, so\ngood luck with the rest of this stuff.\n\n495\n00:24:33.225 --> 00:24:35.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, they still control it to a point,\n\n496\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.960\nbut all it takes is somebody\ngetting around that.\n\n497\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.850\nAnd that's where now companies and,\nof course,\n\n498\n00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.580\nindividuals they start,\nI mean they really do, they break the law.\n\n499\n00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.260\nAnd they go, all right,\n\n500\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.170\nwe're gonna install it anyways cuz\nwe found a way to get around it.\n\n501\n00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.980\nSo they're having to deal\nwith those things, too.\n\n502\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.580\nAnd so, today, you still have to worry\nabout that when installing software.\n\n503\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.430\nIt's got to be the proper licenses.\n\n504\n00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.930\nAnd this can match up, too, and\nwe found this to be true, as well.\n\n505\n00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.830\nEven if you go, I'll download another\ncopy of whatever it is from the Internet.\n\n506\n00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.160\nAnd then you go, and now you got a retail\ncopy of whatever software it is,\n\n507\n00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.570\nit starts to install, and asks for\nthe product key, you have an Enterprise\n\n508\n00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.850\nproduct key, it doesn't match,\nyou can't even install it there.\n\n509\n00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.380\nSo it does have to match up,\nyou do have to worry about that.\n\n510\n00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.652\nAnd that could be a failure\ninstallation for us.\n\n511\n00:25:17.652 --> 00:25:21.920\n>> All right now, Ronnie, let's say I've\ngot administrative rights, all right?\n\n512\n00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.150\nI have made sure that the program\nis compatible with Windows 7,\n\n513\n00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.690\nI trust the publisher.\n\n514\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.400\nI'm going through our list here.\n\n515\n00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.890\nI've got all the necessary\ninstallation files downloaded,\n\n516\n00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.730\nso I don't need internet access.\n\n517\n00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.545\nAnd my license is good, and\nit still won't install.\n\n518\n00:25:36.545 --> 00:25:38.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, what the heck?\n\n519\n00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.850\nWhat's left?\n\n520\n00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.290\n>> Well, what's normally left here,\n\n521\n00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.710\nof course, are just system requirements\nat some point in time, right?\n\n522\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:48.200\nThe very fact is we can actually\nexperience all those other things and\n\n523\n00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.550\nnot realize that the system\njust won't run it.\n\n524\n00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.300\nSo let me give you a for instance here.\n\n525\n00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.480\nThe very fact is you could be running\na 32-bit addition of Windows 7.\n\n526\n00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.540\nI don't know why you would, but you can.\n\n527\n00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.520\nAnd then you go and install whatever the\nfirst software package is that you want.\n\n528\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.800\nLet's say it's Office 2013, okay?\n\n529\n00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.820\nAnd you go ahead and\nyou download that, but\n\n530\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.610\nyou don't realize you downloaded\nthe 64-bit edition of it.\n\n531\n00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.020\nVery possible that that is\nnot going to install for you.\n\n532\n00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.440\nSo you might see that.\n\n533\n00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.100\nThe other thing is if we go back to\nthe AutoCAD print, I'm trying to think of\n\n534\n00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.310\nthe program that takes up the most\namount of RAM, is what I'm trying to do.\n\n535\n00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:24.070\nLet's say, for instance, you actually do\nthat or some type of editing software,\n\n536\n00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.290\nI guess, would be another one that\nyou'd have to actually be able to do.\n\n537\n00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.248\nSometimes this editing software doesn't\nlet you install if you don't have,\n\n538\n00:26:30.248 --> 00:26:34.740\nlet's say, 4 gigs of RAM or\n2 gigs of RAM available so it can install.\n\n539\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.770\nSo if you don't have enough RAM so it can\nexpand out everything that it needs to to\n\n540\n00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.720\nput everything down onto your hard drive,\nyou may also see issues there.\n\n541\n00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.540\nSo hardware types of issues are really\nkinda some of the things that you also\n\n542\n00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.020\nhave to deal with,\nas well as hard drive space.\n\n543\n00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.850\nNow, I am by far the most guilty of this.\n\n544\n00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:55.913\nI don't know why, but I can load up\na hard drive full of whatever, okay?\n\n545\n00:26:55.913 --> 00:26:57.568\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I mean this, right.\n\n546\n00:26:57.568 --> 00:26:59.530\nThe other day, I was doing a show, and\n\n547\n00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.380\nI had 8 megabytes of free\nspace on my hard drive.\n\n548\n00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.940\nI'm like, look at that, that was unusual.\n\n549\n00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:08.670\nWell, whatever happens,\nyou also have to do that, too.\n\n550\n00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.860\nThere has to be enough free\nspace on your hard drive for\n\n551\n00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.510\nyou to install that application.\n\n552\n00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:17.220\nThe good thing is normally, right, when\nyou do download it even from the Internet,\n\n553\n00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.100\nit tells you what those requirements are.\n\n554\n00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.710\nAnd you just have to go back and\nverify and see whether or\n\n555\n00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.770\nnot you actually have met those\nhardware requirements, too.\n\n556\n00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:29.600\n>> Now, Ronnie, if we've met everything,\nwe've got all that taken care of and\n\n557\n00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.540\nit should install, but we can actually run\n\n558\n00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:39.180\ninto a situation where the fact that\nit doesn't install is intentional.\n\n559\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.130\n>> It is.\n\n560\n00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.350\nAnd so, you might actually see that this\nwas exactly what Mike was saying here,\n\n561\n00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.600\nit is absolutely, 100% intentional.\n\n562\n00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.360\nAnd when we start talking about that, that\nmeant that someone like Mike said, look\n\n563\n00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.230\nthere's so many software installations\ngoing on on my network and the problem is\n\n564\n00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.430\nnow, they're causing so many different\nissues, we need to lock this down.\n\n565\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.210\nWe wanna make sure that we\nonly install the software\n\n566\n00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.980\nthat we want to actually have\ninstalled on those machines.\n\n567\n00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.310\nAnd so what Mike can do at that point,\nof course,\n\n568\n00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.660\nis he can log into where he can\ncontrol what we call group policy.\n\n569\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.090\nAnd by far, of all the things that you\ncan really learn about as an enterprise\n\n570\n00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:22.380\nadministrator or as a support technician,\nunderstanding at least the basics\n\n571\n00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:27.230\nof group policy, if not mastering it,\nis probably the best thing\n\n572\n00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.100\nthat you can do if you're having to\ndeal with these types of issues, right?\n\n573\n00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.610\n>> Absolutely, group policy, when we're\ntalking about managing multiple systems,\n\n574\n00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.380\nI wanna have a centralized approach.\n\n575\n00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.820\nI do not wanna have to run around and\ntouch every single machine,\n\n576\n00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.990\none at a time, because it's time\nconsuming, it's inefficient, and\n\n577\n00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.400\nI might miss some machines.\n\n578\n00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.190\nI might not see that machine in the\ncorner, or somebody took a laptop home and\n\n579\n00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.330\nit wasn't there when I was\ngoing through and doing this.\n\n580\n00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.870\nAnd now I've got machines that\naren't configured correctly,\n\n581\n00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.300\npossibly in violation of security policy.\n\n582\n00:28:55.300 --> 00:29:00.170\nSo group policy is a way that I can\nmake a change from my server and\n\n583\n00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:06.090\nhave that change passed out or applied\nto the different machines on my network.\n\n584\n00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.210\nAnd blocking applications is one of them.\n\n585\n00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:12.195\nIf I don't want people installing\niTunes on my work computer,\n\n586\n00:29:12.195 --> 00:29:12.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n587\n00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.280\n>> I can now do something about it\n\n588\n00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.280\nusing group policy.\n\n589\n00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.280\n>> There's no doubt that\nthis is one of the most,\n\n590\n00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.840\nactually I'm gonna say\nit's the most effective.\n\n591\n00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:21.766\n>> It's not just one of them.\n\n592\n00:29:21.766 --> 00:29:23.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is the most effective way\n\n593\n00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.340\nthat we can control this\nthroughout our enterprise, right?\n\n594\n00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.331\nIf we have to do this on every\nindividual machine, after a while Mike,\n\n595\n00:29:29.331 --> 00:29:31.155\nI'm gonna quit after six,\nI'm gonna tell you.\n\n596\n00:29:31.155 --> 00:29:32.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So good luck with\n\n597\n00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.650\nthe other 994 machines that\nyou're having to deal with.\n\n598\n00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.780\nI'm gonna say,\nI'll get to the rest next week.\n\n599\n00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.500\nAnd Mike's like, are you joking?\n\n600\n00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.040\nNo, I'm not joking,\nI'm really gonna quit after that.\n\n601\n00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.940\nBut during group policy, right, we set\nit in one place, we allow the policy to\n\n602\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.590\npush out throughout our network here,\nand we can control it in that instance.\n\n603\n00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.030\nSo let's kinda show you an example of\nwhat we're talking about here, too.\n\n604\n00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.320\nSo I went ahead and\n\n605\n00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.900\nI've made my remote desktop\nconnection into my domain controller.\n\n606\n00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.130\nAnd I brought up\nthe Group Policy Management console.\n\n607\n00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.160\nAnd what we've done is,\nlet's say that Mike actually said,\n\n608\n00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.680\nlook, we need to control this.\n\n609\n00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.930\nThere's an application that's running, and\nI just selected an MSI as an example here,\n\n610\n00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.310\na fairly simple viewer\ncalled a shared viewer.\n\n611\n00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.480\nIt's been around forever and\na day, but I've selected that one.\n\n612\n00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:18.350\nAnd let's say that Mike said we need to\nblock this shared viewer, is what we have.\n\n613\n00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:23.030\nAnd so apparently, I've actually not only\ndone something here, let me actually,\n\n614\n00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.730\noh, see I can't even spell it correctly.\n\n615\n00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:25.930\nShared viewer.\n\n616\n00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.740\nSo, block this shared viewer.\n\n617\n00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:32.387\nWell, I simply made a group policy object\nthat allowed me to be able do that.\n\n618\n00:30:32.387 --> 00:30:34.640\nIf I right-click on that, and\n\n619\n00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.680\ngo to Edit here, I can show you\nwhat we're actually talking about.\n\n620\n00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.068\nAnd so there's a couple of different ways\nthat you and I can actually do this.\n\n621\n00:30:43.068 --> 00:30:46.280\nIf I select Policies, and\n\n622\n00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:51.120\nthen Windows settings and the Security\nsettings here, what we're looking for\n\n623\n00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.500\nis down here toward the bottom edge,\nwhere you see two different ones.\n\n624\n00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.760\nThere's Software Application policies,\nand Application Control policies.\n\n625\n00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.775\nThe Software- not Software Application,\nSoftware Restriction policies.\n\n626\n00:31:01.775 --> 00:31:02.960\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Software Restriction\n\n627\n00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.630\npolicies are the older\nway of doing things.\n\n628\n00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.790\nIt's perfectly fine, if you have\nolder machines that don't understand\n\n629\n00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:13.790\nwhat app locker it's gonna be, this is\nwhat you're gonna use to restrict that.\n\n630\n00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:18.510\nBut the newer system is what they call\nApp Locker Control Policies instead, or\n\n631\n00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.470\nthe Application Control Policies, and\n\n632\n00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.150\nit's right in here that you can configure\nwhat you don't want to install.\n\n633\n00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.600\nSo we have Executables, Windows\ninstallers, scripts, of course, and\n\n634\n00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.290\neven Packaged apps.\n\n635\n00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.650\nBut if I select this Windows installer,\n\n636\n00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:36.560\nyou can see that something else\nhas already been set up here.\n\n637\n00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.140\nAnd so there is default\nrules that are created, and\n\n638\n00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.820\nthen there is this one that\nsays Block Shared Viewer.\n\n639\n00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.830\nAnd so it allows you to walk\nthrough a menu system, and\n\n640\n00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.610\nthen you can select the level\nof control that you want.\n\n641\n00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.321\nNow, I didn't wanna just block\nthis one instance of it, right,\n\n642\n00:31:51.321 --> 00:31:53.787\nbecause this shared viewer\ncould be updated at some point,\n\n643\n00:31:53.787 --> 00:31:57.272\nand that's where software restriction\npolicies have their limitation, right?\n\n644\n00:31:57.272 --> 00:31:59.554\nIf it got updated,\nyou could run that newer update and\n\n645\n00:31:59.554 --> 00:32:02.610\nthen you would actually have to go\nback in again and create another one.\n\n646\n00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.874\nBut I can limit this to the publisher.\n\n647\n00:32:04.874 --> 00:32:08.323\nAnd, so, we can actually do something\nlike that, where I selected the actual\n\n648\n00:32:08.323 --> 00:32:12.230\npublisher and say, block everything\nfrom that publisher, if I want to.\n\n649\n00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.050\nSo, we can do that.\n\n650\n00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:19.470\nNow, we're not gonna do that right here,\nbut I wanted to block this one instead.\n\n651\n00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:24.100\nSo I went ahead and created this policy,\nand made sure it actually did apply.\n\n652\n00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.410\nSo when you do that,\nyou just select that one, and\n\n653\n00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.680\nthen there's a couple of things that\nhave to be done in the background.\n\n654\n00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.610\nOne, of course, is to enforce the rule, so\n\n655\n00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.790\nyou do have to turn that one on,\nmake sure that that's actually on.\n\n656\n00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:41.090\nAnd this also works based off of what we\ncall the Application Identity service\n\n657\n00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:42.820\nthat's running on your computer.\n\n658\n00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.900\nSo, that has to actually\nbe turned on as well.\n\n659\n00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:50.290\nSo once those things are on, you actually\njust allow the policy to push out.\n\n660\n00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:54.310\nAnd then what should happen at some\npoint in time, unless we actually\n\n661\n00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:59.090\nreboot the computer or do a GP update\nto make sure that the policy applies,\n\n662\n00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.520\nit should block our\napplication from running.\n\n663\n00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.190\nSo let's see if we can\nmake this work here.\n\n664\n00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.950\nSo I've turned it on.\n\n665\n00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.990\nAnd now, usually we might\nhave to go ahead and, Mike,\n\n666\n00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.760\nyou said that sometimes you have to reboot\nthe thing a couple of times, right?\n\n667\n00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.050\n>> Yeah, this is one of those policies\nthat sometimes doesn't kick in on\n\n668\n00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:22.310\nthe first refresh of policy, so\nyou've gotta be patient with it.\n\n669\n00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.660\nIt's just one of those things.\n\n670\n00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.800\nThis one and Folder Redirection are two\nthat always drive me crazy because\n\n671\n00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.190\nyou refresh that policy,\nyou reboot that machine.\n\n672\n00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.990\nYou log off, log back on,\nwhatever the case may be, user setting,\n\n673\n00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:34.750\ncomputer setting, and it doesn't kick in.\n\n674\n00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.980\nYou do it one more time,\nand then it does kick in.\n\n675\n00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.340\nBut it is, as Ronnie said,\n\n676\n00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.250\na great way to control what applications\nare being run on my systems.\n\n677\n00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.800\nWe need to keep control of that.\n\n678\n00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.340\nI don't want certain\nsoftware being run on there.\n\n679\n00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.660\nI wanna make sure that all the software\nwe're running is licensed,\n\n680\n00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.600\nthat we're not installing too\nmany copies of these things.\n\n681\n00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.240\nThese are how you're\ngonna be able to do it.\n\n682\n00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:00.930\nThe AppLocker policies can either block\nsoftware, or it can audit software.\n\n683\n00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.387\nSo maybe I don't wanna block Excel 2010,\n\n684\n00:34:03.387 --> 00:34:07.105\nI just wanna see how many people\nare actually running Excel 2010.\n\n685\n00:34:07.105 --> 00:34:08.590\nSo you can do auditing as well.\n\n686\n00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.380\nIt's a very, very cool system.\n\n687\n00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.560\nAs Ronnie said,\nsoftware restriction policies XP and\n\n688\n00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.650\nprior, AppLocker policies Vista and later.\n\n689\n00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.850\nIf you got a mixed environment,\nyou will have to set up both, right?\n\n690\n00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.690\nYou can't do AppLocker policies.\n\n691\n00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.170\nThey'd still be able to\nrun it on Windows XP.\n\n692\n00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.200\nIt will ignore those rules,\nso you do have to do both.\n\n693\n00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.431\n>> So, just to make sure, Mike, cuz now\nI'm always kind of little bit gun-shy,\n\n694\n00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:34.440\nI went ahead and ran a GPResult so\nthat I could see.\n\n695\n00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:39.020\nAnd I'm just verifying that my policy\ndid go ahead and get kicked in here, and\n\n696\n00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.060\nyou can see where it says\nApplied Group Policy, so there it is.\n\n697\n00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.070\nIt's says it's blocked the SharedViewer.\n\n698\n00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:47.215\nAnd so, if I have this,\nright here, my SharedView.\n\n699\n00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:50.350\nOh, it actually still didn't block it.\n\n700\n00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.280\nLet's see what else is happening here.\n\n701\n00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.350\n>> That's when I typically\njust reboot the machine.\n\n702\n00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.000\n>> Yep, so there it is.\n\n703\n00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.540\nSo let's go ahead and try it one\nmore time here, and we'll reboot.\n\n704\n00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.520\n>> Sometimes there's a delay.\n\n705\n00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.650\nYou know,\nthe first time that policy applies,\n\n706\n00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.400\nit's gotta start up that service, right?\n\n707\n00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.270\nThat service has to be up and\nrunning, and it might have got\n\n708\n00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.170\nthat service started a little bit late,\nor it was in the background.\n\n709\n00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.590\nIt was still in the process of\napplying some of those settings.\n\n710\n00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.130\nBecause with today's operating systems,\n\n711\n00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.780\nwe push a lot of that off,\nand we go ahead and\n\n712\n00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.260\ngive you your desktop even though it's not\ndone applying settings in the background.\n\n713\n00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.840\nUsually another reboot or\ntwo will do it [LAUGH].\n\n714\n00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.136\nYou hate saying that cuz it's kinda like,\nI think these guys are lying,\n\n715\n00:35:26.136 --> 00:35:27.202\nthey don't know what's going.\n\n716\n00:35:27.202 --> 00:35:28.741\nBut no, it really is true.\n\n717\n00:35:28.741 --> 00:35:32.880\nSome of these policies, it takes\na couple times to get it to kick in.\n\n718\n00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.380\nSo we'll see here what happens.\n\n719\n00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.635\n>> You know,\nI just logged on as me instead,\n\n720\n00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:40.810\nbut since I think I need to,\nI did [LAUGH].\n\n721\n00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.220\nThat's what happens there.\n\n722\n00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.870\nLet me log off here, and\nthen log back in as Mike.\n\n723\n00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.020\nI don't know why I changed.\n\n724\n00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.812\nI think it's just automatically like,\noh yeah, there's Mike.\n\n725\n00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.740\nLet me do that.\n>> Yeah, how do you log in as Mike?\n\n726\n00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.900\nAnd one of the things about\nthose AppLocker policies,\n\n727\n00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.340\nthere's some default\nrules that get created.\n\n728\n00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.510\nOne of them gives\nthe administrators a free pass.\n\n729\n00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.950\nSo you can block an application, but\nadministrators can still run that.\n\n730\n00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.535\nRonnie logged on as himself,\nwho is in the administrators group,\n\n731\n00:36:04.535 --> 00:36:08.514\nso he would have been able to run\nthe application, policy working or not.\n\n732\n00:36:08.514 --> 00:36:09.560\n>> All right, so here it is.\n\n733\n00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.390\nHere's that SharedViewer, and\nnow I'm crossing my fingers.\n\n734\n00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:13.870\nIt should work here.\n\n735\n00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:18.060\nSo if I select that, and\nit's still not actually able to do so.\n\n736\n00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:22.550\nSo this is where you do take a look and\nsee.\n\n737\n00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.860\n>> Let's just refresh policy\nfrom the command prompt.\n\n738\n00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.940\nWe'll do a gpupdate /force if we can.\n\n739\n00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.630\n>> Let's do that.\n\n740\n00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.160\n>> And we'll see if we can\nget this thing to kick in.\n\n741\n00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.680\n>> I don't know if I have to do this,\nbut let me check this out.\n\n742\n00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.747\nSo then I would do a gpupdate /force.\n\n743\n00:36:43.606 --> 00:36:48.100\nSo we did see where the policy did apply,\nbut I didn't check.\n\n744\n00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.580\nI may have not actually configured\nit to actually execute, so\n\n745\n00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.460\nthat may be my fault as well.\n\n746\n00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.720\nBut we'll see here in just a moment here.\n\n747\n00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.180\nSo sometimes, let's see, here we go.\n\n748\n00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.061\nSo now-\n>> A couple things that we would check,\n\n749\n00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:04.740\nnormally, if we were troubleshooting.\n\n750\n00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.118\nI would start, because I know the policy's\nbeing applied, we did that gpresult.\n\n751\n00:37:09.118 --> 00:37:11.670\nNext thing I'd do is go back\nover that domain controller,\n\n752\n00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:15.380\nstart checking out my policy, make sure\nit's scoped to the right location,\n\n753\n00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.680\nwhich we're sure it is because\nwe saw it in the gpresult.\n\n754\n00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.338\nThen we gotta make sure we've turned\nit on, and we didn't choose audit mode,\n\n755\n00:37:23.338 --> 00:37:24.901\nwe choosed enforce mode.\n\n756\n00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:30.020\n>> And there it is,\nit is actually configured as enforced.\n\n757\n00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.330\n>> And\nlet's see what else you could check.\n\n758\n00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.860\nIt is denying that guy.\n\n759\n00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.555\n>> It is actually denying it?\n\n760\n00:37:35.555 --> 00:37:38.538\n>> It's the right program.\n>> And it is the correct program.\n\n761\n00:37:38.538 --> 00:37:39.910\n>> Didn't misspell anything there.\n\n762\n00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.830\nAnd then you just try again.\n\n763\n00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:43.523\nLet's do one more time.\n\n764\n00:37:43.523 --> 00:37:45.980\nI feel confident.\n\n765\n00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.290\nI say reboot that machine.\n\n766\n00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.538\n>> All right, let's try it.\n\n767\n00:37:48.538 --> 00:37:50.420\n>> You could also ping\nthe domain controller.\n\n768\n00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.820\nThe only thing that could\ncause issues with this\n\n769\n00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:58.070\nis maybe I'm not retrieving current\npolicy, and I've got a cached copy there.\n\n770\n00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.750\nAgain, we saw it in the list, so we're\npretty sure we've got connectivity, but\n\n771\n00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.690\ncaching is always can be an issue as well.\n\n772\n00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:06.810\nBut yeah, reboot it one more time,\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n773\n00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.770\nWe can make sure that service started,\na couple other things.\n\n774\n00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:11.017\nWe'll give it one more try.\n\n775\n00:38:11.017 --> 00:38:14.745\nAgain, at this point, we wanna just\nmake sure that we understand what I can\n\n776\n00:38:14.745 --> 00:38:16.540\ndo with those AppLocker policies.\n\n777\n00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.690\nAlso important to understand\nthose default rules.\n\n778\n00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.560\nThere's three that get created.\n\n779\n00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.250\nWhen you create your first rule,\nit'll say,\n\n780\n00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.290\ndo you want me to create\nthe default rules?\n\n781\n00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:29.180\nAnd you better say yes,\nbecause that creates three rules.\n\n782\n00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.960\nOne, that allows the administrators\nto run anything.\n\n783\n00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.280\nTwo, it allows anybody to run anything\nin the program files directory.\n\n784\n00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.230\nSo programs you've already\ninstalled won't stop working.\n\n785\n00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:42.185\nAnd then three,\nanything in the Windows directory.\n\n786\n00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:45.167\nKinda need that because that's where\nall my operating system files are.\n\n787\n00:38:45.167 --> 00:38:49.148\nAnd then once you've enabled those default\nrules, then you can go back one by one and\n\n788\n00:38:49.148 --> 00:38:52.822\nstart listing the applications\nthat you do not want to run.\n\n789\n00:38:52.822 --> 00:38:55.560\n>> All right, so\nit did actually finally successfully work.\n\n790\n00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.310\n>> There we go, hoorah!\n\n791\n00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:58.190\n>> After the third of fourth attempt here.\n\n792\n00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.040\nBut you may find that these settings\ncan be a little bit tricky, so\n\n793\n00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.610\ngo back through them.\n\n794\n00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.940\nSo this one, what I actually did is\nI went into my shared folder, and\n\n795\n00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.320\nI was actually not able\nto run it from there.\n\n796\n00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.190\nSo more than likely, it might be\nthen in that policy, I told it to\n\n797\n00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:17.540\nchoose a location to run from instead\nof this one right here on the desktop.\n\n798\n00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.060\nBut we did want to at\nleast show that it worked.\n\n799\n00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.370\nLet me see if I can try and\nrun it from, let me do this, and\n\n800\n00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.810\nthat way we'll actually be able\nto prove that's the location.\n\n801\n00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:26.647\nNope, I actually did it right,\nso it was the third reboot.\n\n802\n00:39:26.647 --> 00:39:30.777\nIt took the third time before it\nactually did end up working the way that\n\n803\n00:39:30.777 --> 00:39:32.000\nit needed to.\n\n804\n00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.110\nBut you may find that as also being\nanother issue if you're trying to block\n\n805\n00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.380\nthis on purpose, where you're gonna look.\n\n806\n00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.420\nThis is something that I really\nwant to make sure that I stop here.\n\n807\n00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.800\nLet's make sure that we can show that, and\nwe can also use this to help us out too.\n\n808\n00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.150\nSo just kinda realize that these\nare things that we might see.\n\n809\n00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.175\nAnd if you do run into an issue like that\nwhere it tells you that the administrator\n\n810\n00:39:51.175 --> 00:39:54.113\nhas blocked it, well, of course that's\nalso another installation issue,\n\n811\n00:39:54.113 --> 00:39:56.450\nand this absolutely means you\nare going to escalate this.\n\n812\n00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:57.520\n>> Absolutely.\n\n813\n00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.530\nAll right, Ronnie, well another great\nepisode there, a lot of good information.\n\n814\n00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:05.973\nTroubleshooting, running applications,\nand installing applications in Windows 7.\n\n815\n00:40:05.973 --> 00:40:08.250\nHope everybody enjoyed watching this one.\n\n816\n00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.440\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n817\n00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.350\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n818\n00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.378\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n819\n00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:19.010\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:14.894\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:17.286\nWith me today is my good friend and\ncolleague, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:18.342\nHow you doing Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:18.342 --> 00:00:19.085\n>> I am doing great today.\n\n7\n00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:23.130\nIt's another great day to be right here in\nthe studio as we continue on taking a look\n\n8\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.950\nat supporting Windows 7.\n\n9\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.660\nRemember that we're not actually taking\na look at the exam objectives so much, but\n\n10\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.773\nas much as we want to say,\n\n11\n00:00:29.773 --> 00:00:32.798\nlook here's some of the issues that\nwe deal with in the enterprise.\n\n12\n00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.371\nMaking sure you understand,\nas a support technician,\n\n13\n00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:36.859\nwhat you may encounter as well.\n\n14\n00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.801\nAnd today we're moving beyond\nsoftware installation issues,\n\n15\n00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:44.160\nwhich we did talk about\nin our previous episode.\n\n16\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.710\nNow what we actually have to deal\nwith is just regular software, and\n\n17\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.843\nsometimes software doesn't\nwork the way that it needs to.\n\n18\n00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:54.299\nOr we may find out that hey, some of\nthe features aren't where they actually\n\n19\n00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.198\nneed to be, and what can we do about them?\n\n20\n00:00:56.198 --> 00:00:58.632\n>> Yeah,\nmaybe we get that program installed,\n\n21\n00:00:58.632 --> 00:01:02.039\neverything looks good until we\ngo to launch that application.\n\n22\n00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.069\nAnd then we realize menus have no\nfunctionality or they're not there, or\n\n23\n00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:08.869\nsomething else goes wrong\nwith that application.\n\n24\n00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.156\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna talk about today.\n\n25\n00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:15.390\n>> Right, so when we start taking a look\nat, well, some of the issues that we tend\n\n26\n00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.752\nto see, a lot of times troubleshooting\nthese issues, they really have to kind of\n\n27\n00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:23.540\nstem from, well,\ntesting more than anything else, right?\n\n28\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.692\nWhen you do install, verify that the\nprogram is working the way that it should.\n\n29\n00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:31.012\nIf it's not, it could be that you\ndo some of the things that I do,\n\n30\n00:01:31.012 --> 00:01:35.210\nwhich is just go ahead and say,\nall right, I think I've got it installed.\n\n31\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.940\nAnd I install it, and I run it, and\nthen I believe that everything's done.\n\n32\n00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.930\nAnd what ends up happening sometimes,\nis not only is it not done,\n\n33\n00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.350\nit's actually not really\nactually installed.\n\n34\n00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.610\nAnd so, let me go ahead and\ntalk about that one for a little bit.\n\n35\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.435\nBecause I have done this incredibly,\nand Microsoft has also helped me out,\n\n36\n00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:54.804\nby making it a little bit confusing\nduring installation process.\n\n37\n00:01:54.804 --> 00:01:57.021\nSo, let me show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n38\n00:01:57.021 --> 00:01:59.946\nI'm gonna pull up a program that I just\ndownloaded to try and help us out here.\n\n39\n00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:04.429\nSo sometimes what ends up happening,\nright, is that the program runs, but\n\n40\n00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.090\nit's not all there.\n\n41\n00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.779\nSo let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n42\n00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:09.783\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick on All Programs,\n\n43\n00:02:09.783 --> 00:02:12.261\nlet's say that I have\nsomething called TightVNC.\n\n44\n00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:15.161\nAnd this TightVNC actually\nhas two components\n\n45\n00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:17.470\nto it normally when you download it.\n\n46\n00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.413\nOne says TightVNC Server,\none says TightVNC Viewer.\n\n47\n00:02:21.413 --> 00:02:25.637\nAnd I look right here, and I see something\nthat says TightVNC viewer, and so\n\n48\n00:02:25.637 --> 00:02:26.830\nnow I try and find it.\n\n49\n00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.807\nSo, I do a search here, and\n\n50\n00:02:29.807 --> 00:02:34.863\nI type in tightvnc, and\nthen I type in server.\n\n51\n00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:40.590\nAnd now all of a sudden,\nnothing actually matches at that point.\n\n52\n00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.446\nAnd you might be wondering what in\nthe world is going on, just like I have.\n\n53\n00:02:43.446 --> 00:02:47.860\nAnd sometimes what's happened here is that\nit actually didn't fully install the way\n\n54\n00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.264\nthat we wanted to, or\noptions were selected.\n\n55\n00:02:50.264 --> 00:02:55.258\nAnd then, now you're actually missing\nthe program that you actually think that\n\n56\n00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.850\nshould be there.\n\n57\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.800\nSo, when you see something like that,\nyou can go in and\n\n58\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.110\nfind that original program installed,\nif I do still have it.\n\n59\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.330\nThere it is, that TightVNC set up.\n\n60\n00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.058\nI can simply rerun that program and\nthen start walking through.\n\n61\n00:03:10.058 --> 00:03:14.481\nAnd notice I have several options that are\navailable right here, such as Change and\n\n62\n00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:15.820\nRepair and Remove here.\n\n63\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.036\nWell, let me select Change at this point,\nand this is what you start to see.\n\n64\n00:03:20.036 --> 00:03:22.800\nNow, I did this one on purpose so\nthat we could see this.\n\n65\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.880\nBut you can see that you may\nfind programs like this,\n\n66\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.390\nwhere not every feature got installed\nthe way that you think that it should.\n\n67\n00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.738\nAnd that's why you're not seeing\nthose things right there.\n\n68\n00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:35.240\nSo, this is where I said that it gets\nconfusing for me, Mike, is right here.\n\n69\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.445\nIf you just select one of\nthose little drop downs,\n\n70\n00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:40.220\nwell notice the way that it has it here,\nright.\n\n71\n00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.160\nWill be installed on local hard drive.\n\n72\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.745\nSounds good.\n\n73\n00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:46.959\nHm, entire feature will be\ninstalled on the local hard drive.\n\n74\n00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.110\nWell, what in the world is\nthe difference really between that?\n\n75\n00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.160\nThis says it's gonna be\ninstalled on the hard drive.\n\n76\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.240\nThe entire feature will be installed.\n\n77\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.570\nAnd then it gives me\none with a little one.\n\n78\n00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.480\nFeature will be installed when required.\n\n79\n00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.607\nSo it sounds like that I have a lot\nof choices to make and sometimes even\n\n80\n00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:10.745\nsomebody says, Mike says, Ronnie make sure\nthat this gets pushed out to everybody.\n\n81\n00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:13.570\nIt's an MSI file you can\ndo it through group policy.\n\n82\n00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.200\nAnd there it is.\n\n83\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.390\nI'll go okay,\nI don't know which one to pick.\n\n84\n00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.500\nSo let me choose this one instead which is\nfeature will be installed when required,\n\n85\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.628\ncuz that sounds cool.\n\n86\n00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:25.212\n>> It does sound cool, but it's probably\nnot going to help you that much,\n\n87\n00:04:25.212 --> 00:04:26.840\nreally depends on the program.\n\n88\n00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.390\nOffice is another one that has\nthis kind of menu system in it.\n\n89\n00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.503\nBecause there's so many components to it,\nand if your not gonna use all those extra\n\n90\n00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:38.109\npieces, why bother taking up disk\nspace installing that kind of thing?\n\n91\n00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:41.324\nCuz some of it can take\nup a little bit of space.\n\n92\n00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:45.999\nBasically what your looking at there,\ninstall this feature on the hard drive,\n\n93\n00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.030\nthat would install that\nfeature on the hard drive.\n\n94\n00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.022\nThere's the other one,\ninstall this feature, and\n\n95\n00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:52.707\nwhat did it say all components, I believe.\n\n96\n00:04:52.707 --> 00:04:53.670\n>> Yeah, every component.\n\n97\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.250\n>> Every component.\n\n98\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.640\nThat feature might have sub components\nthat you can pick to install or\n\n99\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.347\nnot install.\n\n100\n00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:01.371\nSo that one would include all of\nthose without having to select them\n\n101\n00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:02.131\nindividually.\n\n102\n00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:05.462\nAnd then the one with the little one\non it, that's basically saying hey,\n\n103\n00:05:05.462 --> 00:05:09.590\nI'll get it there, I'll put it there,\nI'll even put your shortcuts out there.\n\n104\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.541\nBut I'm not going to actually\ninstall it until you try to use it.\n\n105\n00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:16.530\nAgain, that's kind of\na disc space saving option.\n\n106\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.940\nYou might install the entire OfficeSuite,\nbut\n\n107\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.090\nif they never launch access,\nwhy even bother installing it, all right?\n\n108\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.230\nBut then you can get into trouble if\nthose source files disappear or move, and\n\n109\n00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.940\nthey go to launch it and\nit says, oh, wait.\n\n110\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.070\nI didn't actually install this.\n\n111\n00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.808\nI just put that icon out there.\n\n112\n00:05:30.808 --> 00:05:34.030\nNow I've gotta install it,\ncuz you're trying to run it.\n\n113\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.074\nThe source files have moved, and\nit can't complete that installation.\n\n114\n00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:39.639\nSo it can be a little\nconfusing with those options.\n\n115\n00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.108\n>> Yeah, and so\nwhen you do have options like that,\n\n116\n00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:45.793\nyou do need to make sure that it is\nactually doing what you expect it to do.\n\n117\n00:05:45.793 --> 00:05:48.162\nAnd I know I've done this to\nMike before where he said,\n\n118\n00:05:48.162 --> 00:05:50.851\nare all those files in that folder\nthe way that they should be?\n\n119\n00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.394\nAnd I said yeah, sure,\nthey're perfectly fine there.\n\n120\n00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:58.270\nAnd I set it up and I just forget to\nactually do everything that I need to.\n\n121\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.939\nSo one of the troubleshooting things\nthat we do have to deal with is that\n\n122\n00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.746\nthe application either isn't fully\ninstalled the way that we want it to,\n\n123\n00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:04.943\nit's not operating that way.\n\n124\n00:06:04.943 --> 00:06:09.161\nOr it could be that it is missing those\nfeatures and now we have to go back and\n\n125\n00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:09.920\nreinstall.\n\n126\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.080\nAnd that always works fine after\nyou end up doing that, but\n\n127\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.080\nyou just gotta make sure\nthat it is doing that.\n\n128\n00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.320\nAnd so, running through just that process\nagain, take a look if anything did change\n\n129\n00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.430\nfrom what you thought was\nactually the normal, regular one.\n\n130\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.606\n>> Yeah, it is a great troubleshooting\ntip because you're gonna have users,\n\n131\n00:06:25.606 --> 00:06:27.703\nat least for me I know,\nOffice again was a big one.\n\n132\n00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:28.500\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n133\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.020\n>> And they're gonna go and\ntry to do some spell check.\n\n134\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.860\nThe option's there in the menu, right?\n\n135\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.930\nBut they go to launch it and\nit doesn't work, it doesn't happen, and\n\n136\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.582\nthat's because we chose not to\nmaybe install that feature,\n\n137\n00:06:38.582 --> 00:06:40.785\nsome of those proofing tools and\nstuff like that.\n\n138\n00:06:40.785 --> 00:06:43.976\nIf you just do a default install, and\nthat's what a lot of people do; click\n\n139\n00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:46.763\nnext, next, next, next, next,\ninstall, and they don't pay\n\n140\n00:06:46.763 --> 00:06:50.333\nattention to what features are installing\nand what features aren't installing.\n\n141\n00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:54.180\nAnd then they try to use the application\nthey think there is something wrong.\n\n142\n00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.327\nWell they chose to not install that part.\n\n143\n00:06:55.327 --> 00:06:59.410\nSo you might have to go back and\ndo that repair or do that change.\n\n144\n00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.673\nSo something we need to\nbe on the lookout for\n\n145\n00:07:00.673 --> 00:07:02.052\nwhen we're trouble shooting applications.\n\n146\n00:07:02.052 --> 00:07:06.600\n>> And there's other times in which\nthe program is working perfectly fine,\n\n147\n00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.740\nof course.\n\n148\n00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.250\nAnd the program works perfectly fine and\none day, what ends up happening,\n\n149\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.640\nis that now all of the sudden, the program\ndoesn't work the way that it needs to.\n\n150\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.620\nWell, what can you do to\nfigure out what's happened?\n\n151\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.310\nAnd that's what we're really\ntalking about, right?\n\n152\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.080\nWe know that programs work,\nand sometimes programs don't.\n\n153\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.930\nBut, what can we do?\n\n154\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.975\nSo, for an example, what I'm talking\nabout, just recently since I switched to\n\n155\n00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:31.230\na MacBook, and when it updated to\na newer operating system, right?\n\n156\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.277\nAll of a sudden, some of the programs\nthat I had, even in the MacBook,\n\n157\n00:07:33.277 --> 00:07:34.301\nthey aren't working right then.\n\n158\n00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:36.822\nWell, I needed to go in and\nbe able to find out and\n\n159\n00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:39.166\nfigure out what's actually causing what.\n\n160\n00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:42.928\nAnd so, there are places in the MacBook\nthat I can go and check out what we call,\n\n161\n00:07:42.928 --> 00:07:43.785\ndifferent logs.\n\n162\n00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:46.826\nWell inside of Windows 7\nwe can do the same thing.\n\n163\n00:07:46.826 --> 00:07:51.579\nSo when you take a look at Windows 7 we\ncan at least go into the Event Viewer and\n\n164\n00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:54.792\ncheck out where we might\nfind some of these issues.\n\n165\n00:07:54.792 --> 00:07:56.081\nHere it is on my screen.\n\n166\n00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:57.602\nI'm just gonna pull up my Event Viewer.\n\n167\n00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.390\nNow there's a couple of different\nways you can get to it.\n\n168\n00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.744\nThe easiest way I like to do it in\nWindows 7 is use the search programs.\n\n169\n00:08:03.744 --> 00:08:08.600\nSimply typing in event and\nright at the top is the Event Viewer.\n\n170\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.594\nNow, the Event Viewer is actually\nthe place where we should go and\n\n171\n00:08:11.594 --> 00:08:12.911\ncheck more often than we do.\n\n172\n00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:16.051\nI know that this is for\nme is one of the most neglected places.\n\n173\n00:08:16.051 --> 00:08:18.647\nAnd it should be one of\nthe first places I go and check,\n\n174\n00:08:18.647 --> 00:08:21.492\nespecially after a crash on\nan application has happened.\n\n175\n00:08:21.492 --> 00:08:25.680\nBecause it does indicate things\nlike app crashes very easily.\n\n176\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.180\nAnd that way we can go and see exactly the\ntime and if I know that it just happened,\n\n177\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.560\nI can look down at the time and actually\nscroll down to that particular point and\n\n178\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.070\ntry and see what issues we may see.\n\n179\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.260\nSo a lot of times, once we're\nactually inside of the Event Viewer,\n\n180\n00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.950\nI can go, let's say to Windows logs,\nand then to application.\n\n181\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.730\nAnd inside of the application log,\n\n182\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.010\nI don't think I have any, oh there's an\nerror right there, oh that's a WMI error.\n\n183\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.088\nSo you can actually see some of these\napplications that may happen in\n\n184\n00:08:51.088 --> 00:08:51.741\napp crashes.\n\n185\n00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:54.771\nMike, this is where we normally\ndo find things like app crashes.\n\n186\n00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:56.180\nRight?\nOr is that another location?\n\n187\n00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.720\n>> Oh, no the application log is where\napplications can register events,\n\n188\n00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.310\nif it's an operating system issue\nyou've got your system log.\n\n189\n00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.460\nThere's a Setup Log that some applications\nwill use when they're installing.\n\n190\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.260\nPrimarily that's for\n\n191\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.750\nthings when we're adding features to\nthe operating system that it can use.\n\n192\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.240\nAnd then there's the Security Log,\nwhich is for auditing security events.\n\n193\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.120\nSo, yeah, usually the application log, and\n\n194\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.260\nthe event log system has\ngreat filtering capabilities.\n\n195\n00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.110\nYou can create custom views.\n\n196\n00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.900\nSo you can actually pull,\n\n197\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.530\nlet's say I just wanna see all the\nwarnings and errors from all those logs.\n\n198\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.240\nSo rather than have to go through each\none, I can create a custom view and\n\n199\n00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.200\njust look at that.\n\n200\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.130\nReally cool features in there.\n\n201\n00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.210\nAnd as Ronnie said, often overlooked,\n\n202\n00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.650\nand remember we talked about\ntroubleshooting in a previous episode.\n\n203\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.732\nAlways try the simple things first.\n\n204\n00:09:38.732 --> 00:09:41.618\nWell, it doesn't get much easier\nthan going into your Start menu and\n\n205\n00:09:41.618 --> 00:09:45.022\nclicking on event viewer and scrolling\nthrough a list and reading information.\n\n206\n00:09:45.022 --> 00:09:47.990\nRight?\nYour system is trying to tell you\n\n207\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.615\nwhat's going wrong.\n\n208\n00:09:49.615 --> 00:09:53.860\n>> Yeah, so we can see those details and\nthat's really what we want to see.\n\n209\n00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.480\nNow the problem though, Mike,\nis that we're in an enterprise.\n\n210\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.180\nRight?\n\n211\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.210\nIt's not that we wanna go to\nevery single computer that\n\n212\n00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.990\nthis issue could be happening on.\n\n213\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.790\nSometimes we just need to see if it\nactually is happening on multiple\n\n214\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.610\ncomputers.\n\n215\n00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.245\nBy that point, we might have to use\nthe event viewer, but in a different way.\n\n216\n00:10:09.245 --> 00:10:09.900\nRight?\n>> Yeah,\n\n217\n00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.340\nthere's a really cool new feature\nthat they've added in it and\n\n218\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.620\nit's called Event Log Subscriptions.\n\n219\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.010\nIf I'm a help desk person, I might be\nresponsible for maintaining 100 clients,\n\n220\n00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.300\n1000 clients.\n\n221\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.400\nMaybe not even all in the same building or\nthe same location.\n\n222\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:23.938\nHow do I do that?\n\n223\n00:10:23.938 --> 00:10:26.590\nI don't wanna remote into\neach system one at a time\n\n224\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.680\nto scan through their event logs.\n\n225\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.920\nI can create a subscription and\n\n226\n00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.610\nI can basically pull those\nevents back to my system.\n\n227\n00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.101\nAnd I can look at all 1000 machines,\nevent logs from right here.\n\n228\n00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:40.481\n>> So, when we start talking about that.\n\n229\n00:10:40.481 --> 00:10:43.390\nRight?\nA couple of things do have to be set up.\n\n230\n00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.907\nThis particular computer then is\nactually set up to collect all of those\n\n231\n00:10:46.907 --> 00:10:50.261\ndifferent log events that we want\nto happen on the other computers.\n\n232\n00:10:50.261 --> 00:10:53.811\nAnd those other computers are set up as\nwhat we call Source Computers as well.\n\n233\n00:10:53.811 --> 00:10:58.165\nAnd once we do that and we get that setup\ndone, then from this computer I can create\n\n234\n00:10:58.165 --> 00:11:02.038\nwhat we call a Subscription, and\nyou see the one that I have right here.\n\n235\n00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:03.677\nAnd so, I went ahead and created this,\n\n236\n00:11:03.677 --> 00:11:06.971\nbecause it does take a little bit of time\nto kinda generate all those logs here.\n\n237\n00:11:06.971 --> 00:11:11.381\nSo this one's on my domain controller,\nActive Collector Initiated, and\n\n238\n00:11:11.381 --> 00:11:13.831\nI can see I have this one source computer.\n\n239\n00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:17.620\nAnd what this allows us to do is once we\nhave everything turned on the way that\n\n240\n00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.231\nwe need to.\n\n241\n00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:22.236\nThat Windows remote management\nservice has to be turned on,\n\n242\n00:11:22.236 --> 00:11:26.802\nthe Windows event collector service\nalso has to be on and available.\n\n243\n00:11:26.802 --> 00:11:31.649\nYou run a couple of commands on the source\ncomputer, or one command at least and\n\n244\n00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.380\nthen one on this one.\n\n245\n00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.130\nAnd now, once you do that,\n\n246\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.220\non this collecting computer,\nyou create a subscription like this.\n\n247\n00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.720\nAnd, when I right-click and go to\nProperties, it will give you a little,\n\n248\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.900\nkind of a mini wizard to walk through\nto say what you actually want to do.\n\n249\n00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.980\nAnd, so, here I'm telling it that I want\nit actually forward all the events to\n\n250\n00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.190\nthis one location called,\nForwarded Events.\n\n251\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.470\nIf I look over here ont he left hand side,\nyou see, Forwarded Events.\n\n252\n00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.399\nSo this is gonna take whatever I actually\nselected as part of that subscription,\n\n253\n00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:06.800\nand forward it into that log right there.\n\n254\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.250\nAnd then, I would select the Computer,\nthe source computer right here.\n\n255\n00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.640\nBe able to actually add\nin domain computers.\n\n256\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.180\nAnd when I do so, I can select Test,\nverify that I actually did connect.\n\n257\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.490\nFrom that point I can go ahead and\n\n258\n00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.870\nnow select some of the different\nevents to collect here.\n\n259\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:28.360\nSo if I now select Edit, you can see where\nwhat I'm doing is selecting Critical,\n\n260\n00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.450\nWarning, Error, Information, and this\nmay be more information that you want.\n\n261\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.920\nIf you actually just wanna verify just\na few things such as a critical and\n\n262\n00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.650\nthe errors here, perfectly fine.\n\n263\n00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.700\nYou don't care about the warning and\ninformation just uncheck those.\n\n264\n00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.010\nAnd here you can also see well some of\nthe different logs that you can select.\n\n265\n00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:50.870\nNow we just selected the logs here because\nI didn't actually go through and for\n\n266\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.030\na long time add in 30 or\n40 different applications and try and\n\n267\n00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.900\ncrash them and everything.\n\n268\n00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.070\nSo we just wanted to pull\nin some different ones.\n\n269\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.520\nI did add in a couple of\napplications overtime.\n\n270\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.270\nBut we can actually select that.\n\n271\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.915\nAnd so\nonce I do that I'm gonna click OK and OK.\n\n272\n00:13:06.915 --> 00:13:11.935\nAnd then if, it's had sufficient time,\nif I go to forwarded events.\n\n273\n00:13:11.935 --> 00:13:14.561\nYou can see now all of\nthese different events and\n\n274\n00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:18.563\nyou can see the computer it came from,\nwhich is the DC01 computer, and\n\n275\n00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:21.950\nI'm actually on the client\n01 computer instead.\n\n276\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:25.600\nAnd so all of these are actually\nfrom that one computer.\n\n277\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.150\n>> Yeah, that's very handy.\n\n278\n00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.880\nIt's a real time saver because, again,\nI don't wanna have to go and remote into\n\n279\n00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.820\neach one of those machines individually\nand examine their log files everyday.\n\n280\n00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.051\nIt's just way too time consuming,\nway too inefficient.\n\n281\n00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:42.846\nWith this method I can open up\nEvent Viewer on my system that I sit at\n\n282\n00:13:42.846 --> 00:13:43.541\neveryday.\n\n283\n00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:46.912\nAnd if there's anything important going\non on any of those other machines,\n\n284\n00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:50.350\nthey'll show up in my forwarded events\nas long as I set up that subscription.\n\n285\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.150\nSo fantastic system there.\n\n286\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.430\n>> Yeah, and you can see right here,\n\n287\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.140\nthere's actually an installation error\nlog right here that tells me that hey,\n\n288\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.010\nthis one, it tells me that it's not\npermitted by software restriction policy.\n\n289\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.970\nSo you can see a lot of times\neven more detail than you think.\n\n290\n00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.950\nAnd that way I can go back and\nsay hey, wait a minute.\n\n291\n00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.150\nWhat was actually trying\nto be installed here?\n\n292\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.940\nAnd be able to find out.\n\n293\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.190\nAnd if you have application crashes,\n\n294\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.050\nyou can also have those things\nshow up right here as well.\n\n295\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.510\nDepending on what it is that\nyou actually are choosing,\n\n296\n00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.120\nto actually have as part\nof the subscription.\n\n297\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.860\nAnd then you can go and troubleshoot\nat that machine if you need to.\n\n298\n00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.630\nAnd you don't actually\nhave to limit it to one.\n\n299\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.116\nRight?\nIt's a domain computers,\n\n300\n00:14:28.116 --> 00:14:31.291\nI could have pulled in maybe hundreds\nof computers if I wanted to.\n\n301\n00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:32.551\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n302\n00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:35.613\nNow Ronnie, another thing that\nwe wanna talk about here.\n\n303\n00:14:35.613 --> 00:14:39.902\nWhat if I've got an application that ran\nfine and then my IT staff came through,\n\n304\n00:14:39.902 --> 00:14:44.070\nupdated my operating system, and\nnow that application won't run?\n\n305\n00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.280\nAnd unfortunately, they're not\nmaking that application anymore, so\n\n306\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.370\nthere's no newer version to get.\n\n307\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.760\nAm I done?\n\n308\n00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.971\nI'm just never gonna run it again?\n\n309\n00:14:51.971 --> 00:14:54.431\n>> There is that possibility,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n310\n00:14:54.431 --> 00:14:57.553\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is possible that that application\n\n311\n00:14:57.553 --> 00:15:00.120\nmay not end up running again.\n\n312\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.234\nBut there are things you can try to do,\n\n313\n00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:05.691\nwhich is to actually use what\nwe call the compatibility mode.\n\n314\n00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:08.971\nSo if all of a sudden you actually\nrealize it's not running you can do that.\n\n315\n00:15:08.971 --> 00:15:11.877\nNow there is actually other ways\nyou can do that by going and\n\n316\n00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:14.080\nmodifying some of the actual files inside.\n\n317\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.400\nBut we're not gonna actually go that\nway cuz that takes a little bit more\n\n318\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.470\nhacking than we wanna get into.\n\n319\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.180\nBut yes, there's way that we can do this,\n\n320\n00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.215\nlet me show you what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n321\n00:15:23.215 --> 00:15:27.955\nSo what we could do is if we do have,\nlet's say a shortcut to our programs.\n\n322\n00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:31.775\nSo let's take for an example\nthis TightVNC viewer right here.\n\n323\n00:15:31.775 --> 00:15:33.925\nSo I'm going to, I'm not gonna launch it.\n\n324\n00:15:33.925 --> 00:15:34.585\nI don't wanna launch it.\n\n325\n00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:37.425\nI was trying not to launch it,\nbut I launched it anyways.\n\n326\n00:15:37.425 --> 00:15:41.445\nSo the TightVNC, if I right-click\non that and now I go to well,\n\n327\n00:15:41.445 --> 00:15:45.172\nProperties, it is right\nhere in the properties.\n\n328\n00:15:45.172 --> 00:15:50.054\nIf it's not running correctly that\nI can select this Compatibility tab\n\n329\n00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:51.201\nis what I can do.\n\n330\n00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.336\nAnd when I run that Compatibility tab,\n\n331\n00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:59.187\nit is very possible that then I\ncan put a check box right here.\n\n332\n00:15:59.187 --> 00:16:03.938\nAnd notice it says, Run this\nprogram in compatibility mode for.\n\n333\n00:16:03.938 --> 00:16:08.526\nWell, we actually wanted then at that\npoint to choose what that application was\n\n334\n00:16:08.526 --> 00:16:11.280\ndesigned to actually be able to run on.\n\n335\n00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.920\nSo, if I did have this,\nnotice it goes to what this does,\n\n336\n00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.710\nthe only one that this goes back to.\n\n337\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.750\nBut you might actually see that some of\nthem will even go back to XP with service\n\n338\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.050\npack three, I doubt you actually see\nanything older than that anymore but\n\n339\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.630\nyou might be able to do that.\n\n340\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.130\nSo you might have that option for\n\n341\n00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.680\nyou to be able to run that in\nan earlier edition, if you want to.\n\n342\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.800\nSo lets say if I selected that, and\nif the programs actually even older,\n\n343\n00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.590\nyou might have to even run it in a little\nbit more of a limited display mode or so.\n\n344\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.650\nIf you have to run it in 640 by\n480 in the screen resolution,\n\n345\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.090\nyou probably shouldn't be\nrunning it in Windows 7.\n\n346\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.310\nI'm not saying you can't, cuz obviously\nyou can here, but you may do that.\n\n347\n00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:55.510\nSometimes even themes inside of Windows\n7 cause issues with older programs,\n\n348\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.120\nso you do have those options\nthat are also available.\n\n349\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.770\nNow usually that's not the only thing,\nright?\n\n350\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.740\nSo if you do believe it is an application\ncompatibility issue with your operating\n\n351\n00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.240\nsystem, that's fine.\n\n352\n00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:14.280\nBut remember that there are some programs\nthat not only install with administrative\n\n353\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:19.610\nprivileges, but absolutely have to run\nwith administrative privileges as well.\n\n354\n00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.560\nAnd this is also the difference here too.\n\n355\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.380\nNotice that we can actually say\nevery time you run this program,\n\n356\n00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.490\nmake sure it actually\nruns as an administrator.\n\n357\n00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.220\nAnd we might be able to see that.\n\n358\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.709\nNow that's probably more like on,\nlike I said, very old types of programs,\n\n359\n00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:36.400\nnot so much the newer ones.\n\n360\n00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.590\n>> Yeah, not as much today.\n\n361\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.410\nBut during that transition\nfrom XP to Vista and\n\n362\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:45.254\nWindows 7, when that UAC came out,\nsome of the older programs didn't know how\n\n363\n00:17:45.254 --> 00:17:49.161\nto trigger the UAC and ask for\nadministrative credentials, and\n\n364\n00:17:49.161 --> 00:17:53.932\ngive you the opportunity to type in\nan administrator username or password, or\n\n365\n00:17:53.932 --> 00:17:56.933\nclick yes or\nnow if you were logged on as an admin.\n\n366\n00:17:56.933 --> 00:18:00.562\nThey didn't know how to do that, so\nthey would try to run and they would get,\n\n367\n00:18:00.562 --> 00:18:04.670\nthey would fail, because they didn't\nhave the level of access they needed.\n\n368\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.740\nBy checking that little check mark,\nI'm doing it for the program.\n\n369\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.830\nHey, you don't know how to ask for\nadministrative rights.\n\n370\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.850\nI'm gonna go ahead and do it for you that\nway hopefully it will run successfully.\n\n371\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.530\n>> And they even give more\noptions than this, right?\n\n372\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.870\nNormally when you install the program, a\nlot of times you'll still see a little box\n\n373\n00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:27.570\nthere that says run or just allow me to\nuse this or for everyone else to use this\n\n374\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.750\non the computer to use this as well, so\nyou may even see little boxes like that.\n\n375\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.280\nWell, if you do, and you're still having\nthose issues, you may also need to go here\n\n376\n00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.840\nwhere it says change settings for\nall users on this computer, and\n\n377\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.560\nall users will have access to that\nprogram, and then select it for everyone.\n\n378\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.350\nSo this one right here by default\nis really for my user account, and\n\n379\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.590\nthen if I know that other users\nare probably also gonna have that issue,\n\n380\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.320\nI can also select it here too.\n\n381\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.190\n>> Yeah cuz when you're modifying\nthe properties of that shortcut\n\n382\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.830\nwhich is where we've been right clicking,\nthat's in your user profile.\n\n383\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.010\nSo another user logs on they could\ncreate a short cut for that program and\n\n384\n00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.390\nit's gonna do it's normal thing.\n\n385\n00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.550\nIt's not gonna have those\ncompatibility options set.\n\n386\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.110\nWhen you go and\nchoose that option change settings for\n\n387\n00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:14.200\nall users, now you're actually telling\nit the program itself to do this.\n\n388\n00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.310\nSo if they make a shortcut for it,\nthose settings will already be included.\n\n389\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.167\n>> Yeah, the only other option that, oh,\nI shouldn't say the only other option,\n\n390\n00:19:20.167 --> 00:19:22.144\nthere's actually two other\noptions that you can try and\n\n391\n00:19:22.144 --> 00:19:23.730\ndo if you choose to, right.\n\n392\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.170\nOne is to say look, this application isn't\nrunning in anything besides, let's say,\n\n393\n00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.120\nWindows XP, for example.\n\n394\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.000\nWell, if you have that option, you can\nbuild a virtual machine if you need to,\n\n395\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.500\nand run it through there and then just\nconnect to that virtual machine to run it.\n\n396\n00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.990\nNow, in Windows 7,\nthey have a special virtual machine\n\n397\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.150\nthat even that is considered\ndeprecated right now.\n\n398\n00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.020\nThat's called Windows XP mode\nthat you can go and download and\n\n399\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.200\nactually be able to install it.\n\n400\n00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.100\nIt installs in an update as well as that\nvirtual machine to run, but it requires\n\n401\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.580\na lot more memory on your computer\nif you're running an older computer.\n\n402\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.150\nSo even though that is an option for\n\n403\n00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.760\nyou, Windows doesn't really\nlike supporting it anymore.\n\n404\n00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.980\nAnd so you may not have that option\nreally available at this point.\n\n405\n00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.250\nIf you needed it updated like that, an XP\nmachine isn't gonna be updated anymore.\n\n406\n00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.850\nSo you don't want to run that at the same\ntime you're running this machine,\n\n407\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.240\nbecause both of them are actually\nrunning simultaneously.\n\n408\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.560\nThat one's not gonna be updated and\npatched, and\n\n409\n00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.480\nyour Windows 7 machine is, but they're\nreally connected cuz they're actually\n\n410\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.690\nconnected through that application at\nleast and that's where the issues come in.\n\n411\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.590\nNow the other thing of course that we\ndon't want to have to mention, but\n\n412\n00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.580\nwe do, is you might have to\nfind an alternative program.\n\n413\n00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.750\nThe very fact in nature is if that program\nreally isn't going to run anymore,\n\n414\n00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.930\nyou might have to go to that vendor and\nsay, hey, do you have an update one?\n\n415\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.680\nIf you don't,\nyou might have to start looking for\n\n416\n00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.190\nan alternative program that will\ndo about the same functionality,\n\n417\n00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:46.300\nif not exactly the same functionality\nin getting updated program as well.\n\n418\n00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.150\nSo those are the different options.\n\n419\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.350\nSo whether we are actually\nrunning compatibility mode.\n\n420\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.210\nWhether we're trying to use a virtual\nmachine or whether we have to look for\n\n421\n00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:57.070\na different one, those are the ways that\nwe tend to solve these types of issues.\n\n422\n00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:01.190\n>> Yeah, you can maintain backwards\ncompatibility for so long.\n\n423\n00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.330\nBut I can't make that app,\nthat Windows 98 application,\n\n424\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.740\nrun on Windows 10 or\nWindows 25 or whatever.\n\n425\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.420\nAt some point we gotta draw the line and\n\n426\n00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.540\nsay all right, it's time to move on\ndoing new versions of that program.\n\n427\n00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.950\nOr a different program altogether.\n\n428\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.760\nBecause it's probably not even going\nto be safe at that point to run.\n\n429\n00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.340\nAll right Ronnie, other things we can do,\nwe can check our recently added programs?\n\n430\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.042\n>> We really can and then Windows\n7 is kind of a little bit unusual.\n\n431\n00:21:28.042 --> 00:21:29.778\nWhen you see it highlighted,\na lot of times,\n\n432\n00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:32.780\nthat actually lets you know that\nthe program's been recently added.\n\n433\n00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.120\nLet me show you what we're\ntalking about here too.\n\n434\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.060\nSo, when you actually\naren't sure whether or\n\n435\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.750\nnot the program's running, just check and\nsee if it actually was recently added.\n\n436\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.140\nAnd you tend to see it highlighted\njust like this right here.\n\n437\n00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.500\nAnd then when I go to All Programs,\nyou can see the other one.\n\n438\n00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.710\nNow, TightVNC was recently added, but\nbecause I've actually gone to that\n\n439\n00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.230\na couple of times, it now considers\nit not as recently added as well.\n\n440\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.090\nBut there's also a couple\nof issues that you can do.\n\n441\n00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:01.110\nIf this was recently added, then it may\nmean that the installation didn't go well\n\n442\n00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.090\nor something has happened\nduring the installation.\n\n443\n00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.640\nIf you're like me,\nyou're not as patient, right?\n\n444\n00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.127\nYou don't let it fully install,\nI'm normally in the middle of building\n\n445\n00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:12.116\na virtual machine and\ninstalling something at the same time.\n\n446\n00:22:12.116 --> 00:22:16.720\nAnd so, the system doesn't get all the\nresources that it needs to, and you could\n\n447\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.056\ncorrupt the installation or sometime,\nwhatever's happened in update and\n\n448\n00:22:21.056 --> 00:22:26.240\nnow that installation that you had of that\napplication has been corrupted as well.\n\n449\n00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.410\nSo, what can you do?\n\n450\n00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.590\nYou can go ahead and repair the\ninstallation as well of that application,\n\n451\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.890\nand it's fairly easy to do so today.\n\n452\n00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:38.400\nSo if I go to Control Panel, and\ninside of Control Panel I select\n\n453\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.945\nPrograms in the Programs category, and\nthen I go to Programs and Features,\n\n454\n00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:47.400\nyou actually see the list of different\nprograms that we have accessible here.\n\n455\n00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.250\nAnd if I select,\nlet's say for example here,\n\n456\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:54.060\nI'll just use my VMware tools,\ncuz I'm inside of this virtual machine.\n\n457\n00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.280\nNotice up here at the top,\n\n458\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.830\nI have Uninstall,\nwhich is always an option, right?\n\n459\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.930\nI can uninstall the program and\njust reinstall it.\n\n460\n00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:05.040\nThat's always a possibility cuz\nsometimes it does, just after a while,\n\n461\n00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.580\nsomething's happened, it's just no longer\nworking the way that you think it should.\n\n462\n00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.370\nUninstall and\nreinstalling is always a great option.\n\n463\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.520\nI can also select this\none which says to repair.\n\n464\n00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.710\nNow when we repair the program,\nwe're telling it to go ahead and just,\n\n465\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.870\nhey, whatever files may have changed,\n\n466\n00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.640\nokay, from the time it actually\ninstalled to the time that it is now,\n\n467\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.730\ngo ahead and just put it back in that\noriginal state cuz it was working then.\n\n468\n00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.830\nSo go ahead and run that repair as well.\n\n469\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.630\nBut what if you actually needed\nto add in additional features?\n\n470\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.010\nNow here I'm gonna select this type VNC,\nbecause this is the one.\n\n471\n00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.950\nThat program that I said look, it didn't\nhave every feature that I want it to.\n\n472\n00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.620\nFrom that point I can select Change, and\n\n473\n00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.360\nnotice it starts that\ninstallation program again.\n\n474\n00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.610\nAnd I click Next.\n\n475\n00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.320\nAnd I can select Change right here.\n\n476\n00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.559\nAnd then, if I wanted to,\nI can now go ahead and\n\n477\n00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:55.394\ninstall the entire feature right then.\n\n478\n00:23:55.394 --> 00:23:58.656\nAnd then click Next and\nclick Next and let it change.\n\n479\n00:23:58.656 --> 00:24:01.872\nAnd now it actually does the rest\nof the installation it needs to.\n\n480\n00:24:01.872 --> 00:24:06.281\nSo that maybe that now brings me all\nthe features that I need if I wanted to\n\n481\n00:24:06.281 --> 00:24:07.420\ndo that.\n\n482\n00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.840\nSo at this point, let's see it's\nnow asking for other passwords.\n\n483\n00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.290\nI'm not gonna actually change anything for\n\n484\n00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.690\nright now cuz I'm gonna\nactually uninstall this.\n\n485\n00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.170\nSo once the show's over, but\nyou can actually see that, right?\n\n486\n00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.589\nYou do need to install this password if\nyou're gonna be using something like this.\n\n487\n00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:24.934\nBut now you actually will end up seeing,\nif I go back down to the Start,\n\n488\n00:24:24.934 --> 00:24:26.997\nand All Programs, and now look,\n\n489\n00:24:26.997 --> 00:24:31.420\nTightVNC is now listed as one of\nthese recently added programs.\n\n490\n00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.060\nAnd there it is,\n\n491\n00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.630\nthere are the two recently added programs\nthat are actually available for us.\n\n492\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.620\nSo the highlights, people like it,\npeople don't like it,\n\n493\n00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.900\nyou choose the way that you wanna show it,\nand there they are.\n\n494\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.290\n>> Yeah, those repair and\nchange options are very handy.\n\n495\n00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:47.138\nThose are because of\nthe Microsoft Installer, the .msi file,\n\n496\n00:24:47.138 --> 00:24:50.068\nyou don't get those\noptions with executables.\n\n497\n00:24:50.068 --> 00:24:55.781\nThat's one of the big advantages of\nusing a .msi file, is it has a database.\n\n498\n00:24:55.781 --> 00:24:59.900\nIt keeps track of the changes that it's\nmaking to the system as it's being\n\n499\n00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.980\ninstalled.\n\n500\n00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.690\nAnd it gives us the ability\nto go back then and add or\n\n501\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.970\nremove features from that program.\n\n502\n00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.750\nTo remove the program cleanly,\n\n503\n00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:11.890\nwhere it's not gonna leave little files\nlaying around after you uninstall it.\n\n504\n00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:12.948\nExecutables don't do that.\n\n505\n00:25:12.948 --> 00:25:16.180\nWhen you double-click on an executable,\nit runs and then it's done and\n\n506\n00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.465\nit has nothing else to do,\nit doesn't keep track of anything.\n\n507\n00:25:19.465 --> 00:25:21.860\nMSIs, Microsoft Installers,\n\n508\n00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.240\nare a great option when it\ncomes to installing programs.\n\n509\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.200\nSometimes you can get both.\n\n510\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.060\nSometimes on the media\nyou'll have an executable or\n\n511\n00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.387\nan MSI file, MSIs are really good.\n\n512\n00:25:31.387 --> 00:25:32.390\n>> Right,\n\n513\n00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.580\nnow the last thing that we really need to\ntalk about is kind of the final solution.\n\n514\n00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.820\nI know that that's not what\nwe're referring to normally.\n\n515\n00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.500\nBut when we start talking about this\nidea for the computer, the application,\n\n516\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.420\nyou've probably done a little\nbit of troubleshooting and\n\n517\n00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.310\nyou realize, you ran it, it's not running.\n\n518\n00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.380\nYou run it again and\n\n519\n00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.620\nall of a sudden it tells you that\nthere's something wrong with this file.\n\n520\n00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.730\nYou try a repair and it's not working,\nit's not doing anything.\n\n521\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.534\nWell, what can you do at that point?\n\n522\n00:25:55.534 --> 00:25:58.036\nWell, let's say you uninstall it and\nyou install it back and\n\n523\n00:25:58.036 --> 00:25:59.127\nit's still not working.\n\n524\n00:25:59.127 --> 00:26:02.242\nMike, at that point, there's really only\none solution I have left in the enterprise\n\n525\n00:26:02.242 --> 00:26:04.507\na lot of times, which is,\nlet's just reimage that machine.\n\n526\n00:26:04.507 --> 00:26:05.051\n>> Give up?\n\n527\n00:26:05.051 --> 00:26:05.806\n>> Yeah, you can give it up.\n\n528\n00:26:05.806 --> 00:26:06.851\n>> Oh,\nI thought you were gonna say give up.\n\n529\n00:26:06.851 --> 00:26:08.024\n>> You can give up, no.\n\n530\n00:26:08.024 --> 00:26:08.650\n>> That's what I would've done.\n\n531\n00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.840\n>> The idea is reimaging that computer,\nright?\n\n532\n00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.290\nSo as long as all of your data\nis backed up to some location,\n\n533\n00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.150\nreimaging is probably the option,\nI hate to say,\n\n534\n00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:23.090\nthat we kind of tend to do more often\nbecause it saves time and productivity.\n\n535\n00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.863\nAll of this troubleshooting we've\nbeen talking about, it takes time.\n\n536\n00:26:26.863 --> 00:26:30.163\nAnd in a networked environment,\nin an enterprise environment,\n\n537\n00:26:30.163 --> 00:26:33.230\nthe key goal there, right,\nis productivity for everyone.\n\n538\n00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.710\nAnd so if Mike is actually working on the\ncomputer for three hours, perfectly fine.\n\n539\n00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.781\nBut that means the guy that's supposed to\nbe using that computer, he's not working,\n\n540\n00:26:40.781 --> 00:26:43.756\nand now that guy who's supposed\nto be working isn't working.\n\n541\n00:26:43.756 --> 00:26:44.910\nAnd, well, what can you do?\n\n542\n00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.024\nWell, one of the easiest and\nfastest way we get that back, right,\n\n543\n00:26:48.024 --> 00:26:52.084\nis by saying all right, let's take 20\nminutes, let's reimage this computer, and\n\n544\n00:26:52.084 --> 00:26:55.500\nyou're back up and running and\nwe'll make sure that everything works.\n\n545\n00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.860\nAnd if everything works fine,\nthen we're good.\n\n546\n00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.380\nBut you do still have to worry, right?\n\n547\n00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:03.780\nAs an enterprise technician, or MCSA,\nwhatever we want to call ourselves,\n\n548\n00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.290\nadministrators, that's perfectly fine.\n\n549\n00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:07.010\nBut the problem is, right,\n\n550\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.990\nyou need to make sure that everything\nis back the way that they need to.\n\n551\n00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:14.020\nAnd by putting together and understanding,\nright, that application issues\n\n552\n00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.535\nare gonna happen and we just have to deal\nwith them, usually this is our kinda\n\n553\n00:27:18.535 --> 00:27:23.950\ngo-to option because it is the least\nlikely to impact all of the production.\n\n554\n00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.790\nBut it shouldn't be our first,\nit should not be our first go-to.\n\n555\n00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.640\nWe normally do set a time limit,\nbut it's always easier for me, so\n\n556\n00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.130\nI go, yeah let's just reimage it and\nstart all over, and we're fine.\n\n557\n00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.230\n>> Yeah, corporate environments nowadays,\n\n558\n00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:40.250\nwe focus on making sure that users are\nstoring their data either on our servers,\n\n559\n00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.620\non our network, or even out in the cloud.\n\n560\n00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.840\nNothing is stored locally on that\nmachine for that very reason.\n\n561\n00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.790\nIf we get infected,\nif something's going wrong,\n\n562\n00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:55.020\nI can simply reimage that machine,\nyou log back on.\n\n563\n00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.795\nWe probably have policies and\nother systems in place,\n\n564\n00:27:57.795 --> 00:28:01.416\nlike System Center, Configuration Manager\nand Operations Manager,\n\n565\n00:28:01.416 --> 00:28:03.670\nto reinstall all the applications.\n\n566\n00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.545\nAnd if I can get all that\ndone in 45 minutes and\n\n567\n00:28:05.545 --> 00:28:09.530\nthat user can be productive again, that's\ndefinitely the way that we wanna go.\n\n568\n00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.820\nBut, as Ronnie said,\nwe don't jump to that.\n\n569\n00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.424\nWe should definitely try to do a little\ntroubleshooting and fix it first.\n\n570\n00:28:16.424 --> 00:28:20.674\nCuz I'll tell you, even though you've got\npolicies in place that say nothing gets\n\n571\n00:28:20.674 --> 00:28:24.630\nstored, if that's important,\ndo not store it on your local machine.\n\n572\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.010\nWe'll redirect through My Documents and\nall of that good stuff.\n\n573\n00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.200\nWe'll give them access to\nOneDrive through Microsoft or\n\n574\n00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.200\nwhatever cloud provider we're using.\n\n575\n00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.900\nWe do everything we can, and\nI guarantee you, you reimage that machine,\n\n576\n00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.797\nthat user is gonna come back to you and\nsay, what happened to that TPS report?\n\n577\n00:28:40.797 --> 00:28:42.503\nI was working on it all day long and\nnow it's gone.\n\n578\n00:28:42.503 --> 00:28:46.120\nAnd you're like, are you kidding me,\nyou had it on your local machine?\n\n579\n00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.520\nThat was the only copy?\n\n580\n00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.630\nAnd, yeah, so it has to be a last\nresort in most situations.\n\n581\n00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.360\n>> Yeah, and if it's not, well that's\nactually the responsibility of that user.\n\n582\n00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.434\nBut, yes, this should not be our first\nresort, even though we, I hate to say it,\n\n583\n00:29:00.434 --> 00:29:02.100\nit's always been my go to [LAUGH].\n\n584\n00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.076\nIn the end, I am the worst at this cuz I\njust get frustrated after a while, but\n\n585\n00:29:06.076 --> 00:29:08.320\nthat's what you're there for, right?\n\n586\n00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.960\nYou are there to figure out the puzzle,\nand so you might as well take the time to\n\n587\n00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.030\ndo it in whatever time\nlimit they give you, right?\n\n588\n00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.040\nOnce they tell you, if it's 30 minutes or\nan hour, take that time and\n\n589\n00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.820\nmake the most effective use of it.\n\n590\n00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.077\nAt that point, if you don't,\nyou'll probably see that that's usually\n\n591\n00:29:22.077 --> 00:29:25.017\nthe resort that you go to,\nwhich is in 30 minutes here or an hour,\n\n592\n00:29:25.017 --> 00:29:28.503\nif you can't fix it, just reimage it and\nlet's start all over and keep going.\n\n593\n00:29:28.503 --> 00:29:32.660\nAnd you do have to deal with that,\nthat's just the nature of that business.\n\n594\n00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:37.090\nBut just remember, the applications,\nthey're not going away, so you can't\n\n595\n00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:40.780\nhope that that's ever gonna happen,\nso you do have an effective way here.\n\n596\n00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.156\nAt least some of\nthe different methodologies,\n\n597\n00:29:42.156 --> 00:29:45.295\nsome of the different things you can look\nfor when you are talking about having to\n\n598\n00:29:45.295 --> 00:29:47.557\ntroubleshoot the way that\napplications end up failing us.\n\n599\n00:29:47.557 --> 00:29:50.811\n>> All right Ronnie, well again, a lot\nof good information, thanks for that.\n\n600\n00:29:50.811 --> 00:29:54.437\nI feel like we can troubleshoot\napplications a little bit better now,\n\n601\n00:29:54.437 --> 00:29:57.880\nkeep my users happy,\nkeep those applications running.\n\n602\n00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.260\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode,\n\n603\n00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.780\nhope you

--> 00:00:14.790\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.450\nWith me today is my friend and\ncolleague, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.360\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.132\n>> I am doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:22.620\nThis is another great day to be right\nhere in the studio as we continue on\n\n8\n00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.200\nto take a look at supporting Windows 7.\n\n9\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.950\nRemember that this is not an exam really\nfocused type of show that we're doing.\n\n10\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.670\nIt really is more about trying to say,\nhey, we're supporting the enterprise.\n\n11\n00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.860\nWe're still running Windows 7.\n\n12\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.280\nWhat are some of those issues\nthat we need to be aware of and\n\n13\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.290\nbe able to troubleshoot as well.\n\n14\n00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.490\nAnd today we're focusing in on,\nwell, really user accounts and\n\n15\n00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.354\nsome basic security issues.\n\n16\n00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:49.430\nNow, even though we have covered security\nin other episodes, these are just kind of\n\n17\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.710\nsome of the ones that we don't really\nthink about in terms of security, but\n\n18\n00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.050\nissues that we do address\nespecially with end users.\n\n19\n00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.390\nAnd a lot of times just with end users\ntrying to connect to some place else, too.\n\n20\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.185\n>> Yeah, and one of the first\nthings we're gonna look at,\n\n21\n00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.450\nRonnie, is good old authentication, right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.200\nAnd we know that's one of those things\nthat we get a lot of calls at the help\n\n23\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.850\ndesk that deal with that problem.\n\n24\n00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.408\nWhether it's my account's not working,\nor my password's not working, or\n\n25\n00:01:11.408 --> 00:01:14.983\nI can't access this resource and\nI think I should be able to,\n\n26\n00:01:14.983 --> 00:01:20.210\nauthentication is something we'll spend\na little bit of time on at the help desk.\n\n27\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.250\n>> Right, when we start thinking\nabout this idea with authentication,\n\n28\n00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.860\nthe problem happens to be a lot of\ntimes is that users don't understand\n\n29\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.560\nwhen they're authenticating, who they're\npresenting their credentials to.\n\n30\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.630\nSo let me kind of give you a for\ninstance here.\n\n31\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.320\nThe very fact is a user's computer may be\npresenting their credentials, let's say,\n\n32\n00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.510\nto an Active Directory domain controller\nif they're part of an Active Directory.\n\n33\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.390\nAnd that means they're not really\n\n34\n00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.930\nchecking the user account\nright there on the computer.\n\n35\n00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.380\nBut, sometimes, the only place that\nthey actually are checking, though,\n\n36\n00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.480\nis against that local security\ncount right there on the computer.\n\n37\n00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.340\nNow, Mike, if I do that, right,\n\n38\n00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.770\nthere are some issues that we\nreally have to face, right?\n\n39\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.680\nLet's say that I think I'm gonna get\naccess to a domain resource, but\n\n40\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.530\nI'm logged in as a local user,\n\n41\n00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.560\nI may actually have to deal with\nissues like that too, right?\n\n42\n00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.630\n>> Yeah, it's not gonna work.\n\n43\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.860\nAnd you see this in scenarios where maybe\nmost of our computers are gonna be part of\n\n44\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.750\nthe domain, and they probably have\nan account in Active Directory, and\n\n45\n00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.600\nlet's say it's Mike, but we've also made\nthem a local account on that machine.\n\n46\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.950\nEspecially laptops where they take\nthose laptops outside of the domain,\n\n47\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.790\nthey might have a local account,\nas well, that they can log into\n\n48\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.640\nthat machine with when they're outside,\nand it's named Mike, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.550\nAnd so now when I go to log in,\n\n50\n00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.620\nif I'm not paying attention I\ncould type in the wrong password.\n\n51\n00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.228\nIf I do login with that local account\ninstead of my domain account, and\n\n52\n00:02:37.228 --> 00:02:41.190\nI'm at work, I'm not gonna have any access\nto any network resources because nobody\n\n53\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.900\noutside the local machine is\ngonna trust that local account.\n\n54\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.800\n>> So whenever we start taking a look at\nthis, it's really important then that\n\n55\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.280\nthe user understand what context\nthat they're logging into, or\n\n56\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.840\nthey might not have access\nto those resources.\n\n57\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.750\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you what we're talking about here.\n\n58\n00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.262\nLet me go ahead and\nlog off of this machine.\n\n59\n00:02:58.262 --> 00:02:59.940\nAll right, so\nhere we are on this computer.\n\n60\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.540\nAnd what I've done is\nI'm at the login screen.\n\n61\n00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.040\nNow that I'm at the login screen, I might\njust simply go in and type in my password.\n\n62\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.810\nNow a regular user might do this\nwithout ever looking at this\n\n63\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.230\nprefix that we see right here\nwhere you see lab02\\Ronnie.\n\n64\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.950\nI know I've done it several times where\nI've been on a machine, in a domain, and\n\n65\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.000\nit actually kicked me out and I was doing\nsomething as local administrator and said,\n\n66\n00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.300\nall right, I'm done.\n\n67\n00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.920\nAnd then I log out, and\nI just quickly type my password back in,\n\n68\n00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.820\nI try to gain access to that network\nresource, and it doesn't work.\n\n69\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.170\nSo that's exactly what can happen.\n\n70\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.750\nSo we end up logging in.\n\n71\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.750\nThe user now thinks that he's logged in,\njust like he was as a regular domain user,\n\n72\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.760\nbut now he can't gain access,\nmaybe, to those network resources.\n\n73\n00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.210\nAnd so\nthat's where the frustration comes in.\n\n74\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.570\n>> Yeah, cuz, as you said,\nthey're logged in, and\n\n75\n00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.460\nthey go to connect to that file server,\nor whatever the case may be, and\n\n76\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.170\nall of a sudden they cannot,\nand they don't understand why.\n\n77\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.470\nThey don't know the difference between\na local account and a domain account.\n\n78\n00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.140\nAnd as you said, they don't pay attention.\n\n79\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.530\nThey just see the password dialog box,\nthey type it in, and they go.\n\n80\n00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.360\n>> So let's go ahead and show you what\nwe should be able to help the user do.\n\n81\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.740\nAnd I know that this sounds simple, but\n\n82\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.400\nit is something that they really\nneed to pay attention to.\n\n83\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.660\nSo I'm simply going to log out again.\n\n84\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.600\nSo gonna go ahead and click on the Start\nbutton, and to the right of the Shut Down,\n\n85\n00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.720\nselect Log Off.\n\n86\n00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.890\nSo I'm getting to the new terminology\nof this as a sign out, sign off, or\n\n87\n00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.020\nwhatever it might be.\n\n88\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.380\nSo here it is, Ctrl+Alt+Delete.\n\n89\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.690\nAnd now, what we need to do is tell\nthe user to, look, you gotta slow down.\n\n90\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.700\nIf you're not getting access to network\nresources and you once were and\n\n91\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.540\nnothing has changed on your computer,\nlet's take a look at the username.\n\n92\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.170\nNow, they may say, all right,\nI think everything looks good,\n\n93\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.570\nthere's my name right there.\n\n94\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.620\nWhat you want to do is tell them\nto go ahead and Switch User.\n\n95\n00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.930\nAnd when they do that,\nthen you can select Other User.\n\n96\n00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.540\nAt this point, normally what we do is kind\nof that, oh, we call it the pre-2000 name,\n\n97\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.450\nis that what we call it?\n\n98\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.760\n>> Yeah, the pre-Windows 2000?\n\n99\n00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.610\n>> Yeah, so I normally tell them to\ngo ahead and type in the word, lab.\n\n100\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.730\nNow, I don't have to.\n\n101\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.330\nIf you take a look right down here\nunderneath where it says the word\n\n102\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.500\npassword, I know it's a little\nbit difficult to see,\n\n103\n00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.780\nit does tell me the name of my domain\nright here that I am logging onto it.\n\n104\n00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.965\nBut if I want to make sure, and\nthis is what I've always done,\n\n105\n00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:13.650\nis I just type in lab\\, and\nnow I can actually enter in\n\n106\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.220\nthe exact same name which is is\nidentical at this point here.\n\n107\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.130\nAnd now I start to log in, and\nthen I should be logged in with my own\n\n108\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.910\nnetwork profile or\nmy domain profile at this point.\n\n109\n00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.640\nAnd if the user account's been there for\na long time, well,\n\n110\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.790\nthey should get access\nto all of their files.\n\n111\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.530\nAnd actually,\nI didn't think about that, Mike.\n\n112\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.530\nThe other thing that most users actually\ndo complain about is that they go, Ronnie,\n\n113\n00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.560\nI logged in, but\nMy Documents folder was clear.\n\n114\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.389\n>> It was empty.\n>> I was thinking about\n\n115\n00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:41.942\nthat yeah, it was empty.\n\n116\n00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:43.405\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where the heck is all my stuff?\n\n117\n00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:45.770\nAnd again, they've logged on\nwith a different profile, right?\n\n118\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.030\nThey've got their domain account and\ntheir local account.\n\n119\n00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.120\nWell, those are gonna be\ntwo separate profiles,\n\n120\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.820\nwhich means two separate My Documents,\nMy Pictures, and all that good stuff.\n\n121\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.452\nAnd if we can go back to that logon\nscreen just for a second, Ronnie.\n\n122\n00:05:57.452 --> 00:05:58.764\n>> Sure.\n>> As Ronnie mentioned,\n\n123\n00:05:58.764 --> 00:06:00.890\nthat's the pre-Windows 2000 name.\n\n124\n00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.600\nThe name of the domain was right\nunderneath there, so you could always just\n\n125\n00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.240\ntype your name, and the domain part\nis assumed, so you could do that.\n\n126\n00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.350\nYou could also use what\nwe call your UPN suffix.\n\n127\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.240\nAnd in Force where there's many,\nmany domains,\n\n128\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.460\nthis might be something that we do.\n\n129\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.160\nIt might be Ronnie@lab.net, or whatever.\n\n130\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.080\nThat would also work, so\nif you went that way.\n\n131\n00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.030\nSame account,\n\n132\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.870\ntwo different ways to specify that\nyou're logging in with a domain account.\n\n133\n00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.730\nAs you do the either domain \\ username, or\n\n134\n00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.070\nusername @ domain, and\nthen the same password.\n\n135\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.930\nAnd another cool thing you\ncan do from this dialogue is,\n\n136\n00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.830\nand this is something I find\nvery useful as a technician,\n\n137\n00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.900\nis I go to a machine and\nI can't log on to the domain, right?\n\n138\n00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.940\nAnd so I need to log on to the local\nmachine as that local administrator, but\n\n139\n00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.910\nI don't know the name of the machine\nto put out there in front.\n\n140\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:01.100\nSo if you do a .\\, you'll see\nthat where it says log on to lab\n\n141\n00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.820\nactually changes to\nthe name of the machine.\n\n142\n00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.180\nAnd so a quick,\ndirty way to log on with a local account,\n\n143\n00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.030\nif the name of the machine is long,\nyou can just do .\\Ronnie.\n\n144\n00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.920\nOr if you don't know\nthe name of the machine,\n\n145\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.990\nthat backslash will show you the name\nof that machine from the log on screen.\n\n146\n00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.740\n>> Yeah, and those are great little\ntips because there's no doubt that\n\n147\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.890\neven though I think I know what the name\nof every machine on my network is,\n\n148\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.050\nthere's a chance.\n\n149\n00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.430\nAnd we've had this happen, where somebody\njust moves computers around just to see,\n\n150\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.190\nwell, this computer will work for you\nright now, and since you're using a domain\n\n151\n00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.300\naccount, it shouldn't matter\nwhat computer you're really on.\n\n152\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.040\nSo that way they just move it to test it\nout and then they forget because like, oh,\n\n153\n00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.920\nit's working, just use that one for now.\n\n154\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.350\nAnd they forget to put it back, and\n\n155\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.040\nall of a sudden you go, okay,\nthis is supposed to be computer 13.\n\n156\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.850\nIt's not computer 13, and you keep\ntyping in lab 13, or whatever it is, and\n\n157\n00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.200\nit's not working for you.\n\n158\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.250\nVery easy mistakes.\n\n159\n00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.120\n>> Yeah, large environments,\nworking in help desk.\n\n160\n00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.272\nI've been in situations\nwhere I need to remote in.\n\n161\n00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:56.342\nThis user's called me up and said, hey,\nI need you to help me fix my machine.\n\n162\n00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:58.676\nSure, I'll remote into it,\nwhat's the name of your machine?\n\n163\n00:07:58.676 --> 00:07:59.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know,\n\n164\n00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.343\nI just sit at this thing every day, but\nI don't know what the name of it is.\n\n165\n00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:07.592\nHey, will you do me a favor, log off.\\,\nand you can see it right there.\n\n166\n00:08:07.592 --> 00:08:09.660\nSo, a handy little trick to know.\n\n167\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.200\n>> Very handy as well.\n\n168\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.707\nNow, there's also other times though,\nespecially when dealing with user\n\n169\n00:08:14.707 --> 00:08:17.993\naccounts, is that you may have a couple\nof other possibilities here and\n\n170\n00:08:17.993 --> 00:08:20.983\nsometimes they're funny and\nsometimes they're not so funny.\n\n171\n00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:23.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Some of them maybe the account is\n\n172\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.590\ndisabled.\n\n173\n00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.200\nSo, they try and log in, and\nit doesn't let them log in.\n\n174\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.660\nThey slowly, like I do,\none letter at a time,\n\n175\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.750\nmaking sure that they press it correctly,\nand they can't log in.\n\n176\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.765\nThat could be a scary\nsituation at some point.\n\n177\n00:08:36.765 --> 00:08:38.690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and the user doesn't know, and\n\n178\n00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.300\nthat's something we've\ngot to troubleshoot.\n\n179\n00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.100\nIf they can't authenticate,\n\n180\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.350\nthen there's one of a few\nthings that it could be, right?\n\n181\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.030\nThe most common one probably is a typo,\nthat they're typing the password wrong or\n\n182\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.350\nthey've changed their password recently,\nand they've forgot what they changed that\n\n183\n00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:59.940\nnew password to, the account\ncould be deactivated or disabled.\n\n184\n00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.640\nIt could also be expired, so\n\n185\n00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.780\nseveral different things\nwe could end up with there.\n\n186\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.790\n>> Yeah, so here's an example as\nyou take a look on my computer,\n\n187\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.170\nI'm sorry I kinda switched out\na little bit too fast there.\n\n188\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.290\nSo, on my computer I went ahead and\n\n189\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.750\nbrought up at least one\nof these examples for us.\n\n190\n00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.760\nSo that we can see if it tells you that\nusername and password is incorrect,\n\n191\n00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.303\nnormally, at least for me that's\nkind of a normal every day thing.\n\n192\n00:09:20.303 --> 00:09:23.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, I can't type worth anything.\n\n193\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.340\nAnd, so at this point here, it could\njust be that I've just mistyped it.\n\n194\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.030\nBut the other ones and let me see, I think\nI can set this up real quickly, can't I?\n\n195\n00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.680\nCan I get access into\nmy domain controller?\n\n196\n00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.360\nLet me disable that account, and\nlet's see what the difference is\n\n197\n00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.120\nthat happens here when we\nget access to it as well.\n\n198\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.290\n>> Other things that could occur there,\n\n199\n00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.770\nwhat if they've mistyped their\npassword several times and\n\n200\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.480\nwe've got a policy in place that locks\nthe account right to where we're trying to\n\n201\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.360\nprevent password guessing and other\ntypes of attacks against those accounts.\n\n202\n00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.520\nThat could be another reason\nthey are not able to log in.\n\n203\n00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.280\nAll right.\n\n204\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.780\nAnd it'll usually tell\nthem what the problem is.\n\n205\n00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.540\nLike there, you saw it said,\nhey, either your user name or\n\n206\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.310\nyour password is not correct.\n\n207\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.820\nOther ones it will say,\nyour account has been disabled,\n\n208\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.640\nsee your system administrator or\nyour account is locked.\n\n209\n00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.300\nProblem is our users typically,\ndon't see that.\n\n210\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.400\nThey don't pay attention, they just say, I\ncan't log in, and they call the help desk\n\n211\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.530\nand they start complaining, and then we've\ngot to try to reproduce that problem.\n\n212\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.460\n>> Yeah, sometimes, when this ends up\nhappening, right, what I'm trying to do is\n\n213\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.060\nget it connected to my active\ndirectory domain controller here.\n\n214\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.890\nAnd there we are.\n\n215\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.200\nSo, what I'm gonna do is this.\n\n216\n00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.690\nGood, I've selected Mike already,\nso that actually helps out.\n\n217\n00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.400\nIf I right click on Mike and\nI go to properties here.\n\n218\n00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.830\nWe can now go to the,\nis it the account settings?\n\n219\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.420\nYep.\n\n220\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.210\nWe can go to the account, and\nright here, I can actually and go ahead.\n\n221\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.340\nAnd, where can I disable, oh there it is.\n\n222\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.380\nThe account is disabled.\n\n223\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.615\nNow, that might actually bring a little\nbit more, [LAUGH], more consternation\n\n224\n00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:52.905\nfrom Mike at some point, if also there's\na message for Mike on his desk that,\n\n225\n00:10:52.905 --> 00:10:55.695\na little pink note that says,\nplease come and see me in the office,\n\n226\n00:10:55.695 --> 00:11:00.375\nbring all your belongings at the same\ntime, but hopefully that won't happen.\n\n227\n00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:03.120\nBut just by something like this happening,\nright?\n\n228\n00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.050\nNow, Mike goes and\n\n229\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.950\ntries to login and that's where\nwe might also see some issues.\n\n230\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:14.517\nSo let's see, Mike, if I'm gonna cause\nyou some consternation here, and to.\n\n231\n00:11:14.517 --> 00:11:19.252\nSo now, if I log off as me,\nand then in a moment here,\n\n232\n00:11:19.252 --> 00:11:22.130\nwe will try and login as Mike.\n\n233\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.760\nYou did see that he had a domain account.\n\n234\n00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.810\nSo now.\nI typed in Mike.\n\n235\n00:11:29.433 --> 00:11:30.310\nAnd there it is.\n\n236\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.047\nNow, you actually have a nice,\nI'm not saying nice message.\n\n237\n00:11:33.047 --> 00:11:34.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You have at least a message that tells\n\n238\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.890\nyou, this is probably something that's not\ngonna be solved by you trying to continue\n\n239\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.780\nto type in your password.\n\n240\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.970\nSo normally, something like this you know,\n\n241\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.860\nyou end up just having to go ahead like\nit says, see your system administrator.\n\n242\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.800\nAnd that way you're actually\nable to get access back in.\n\n243\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.650\nSo, that account disabling\nis a possibility.\n\n244\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.190\nThere's also a couple of other\npossibilities here, too.\n\n245\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.580\nWhen we start talking about like,\n\n246\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.990\nthe count is now,\nwhat did I call, expired as well.\n\n247\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.366\nThat sometimes you do have temporary\naccounts that get created and\n\n248\n00:12:04.366 --> 00:12:06.120\nafter a while, they are expired.\n\n249\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.070\nI know several years ago, I did some\nteaching out at a school system and\n\n250\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.840\nthey created an account for me on that\nschool system, and after a couple weeks\n\n251\n00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.120\nit just expired, so even though I\nhad the domain credentials in there.\n\n252\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.940\nAnd a couple weeks later it's like,\nyeah, your accounts no longer valid.\n\n253\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.990\n>> Yeah, very handy if you hire temporary\nemployees like data entry people,\n\n254\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.500\nthings like that contractors like Ronnie\ngoing out there doing some constructing.\n\n255\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.960\nOne of the things we gotta do is\nwe've gotta create an account for\n\n256\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.550\nhim while he's there, so\nhe can access network resources.\n\n257\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.480\nBut at some point, he's gonna leave right,\nand he's not coming back,\n\n258\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.640\nand I don't need that account sitting\nthere where somebody could attempt to use\n\n259\n00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.540\nit to gain access to the network,\nso I'm going to disable it.\n\n260\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.770\nThe problem is we forget to do that.\n\n261\n00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.170\nWe forget to go back and disable it, so\n\n262\n00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.060\nwhen I hire 15 kids in the summertime\nto do some data entry,\n\n263\n00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.440\nI'm gonna create them accounts,\nand I'm gonna make them temporary.\n\n264\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.820\nI'll set an expiration date for\nthree months,\n\n265\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.250\nor however long their internship is for.\n\n266\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.750\nAnd at the end of that period, active\ndirectory is gonna take care of disabling\n\n267\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.940\nthe accounts for me,\nI don't have to remember to do it.\n\n268\n00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.070\n>> And don't forget that we also\nmight have access to those account\n\n269\n00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.410\nlockouts that end up happening.\n\n270\n00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:08.970\nRight?\n\n271\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.940\nYou type in the password too many times,\nit just locks you out.\n\n272\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.700\nAnd sometimes it even locks you out\nto the point where it tells you,\n\n273\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.640\nyou need to go on\nthe system administrator.\n\n274\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.420\nA lot of times, it's just a time out\nwhere you have to wait a little bit of\n\n275\n00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.720\ntime before you can log back in.\n\n276\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.720\nBut those are other common issues\nthat you may also end up facing\n\n277\n00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.770\nwhen you actually having\nto deal with this too.\n\n278\n00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:31.850\nNow, there is this, as well which is\nactually more control on your systems,\n\n279\n00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.210\nand something that users\nshould be able to understand.\n\n280\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.500\nNow Mike, I know that there's a way\nthat what we can do is we can set it up\n\n281\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.120\nto where people are only able to log into\nmy domain during business hours, right?\n\n282\n00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.630\n>> Absolutely.\n\n283\n00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.560\nThese are handy to use when you've\ngot like a three shift shop.\n\n284\n00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.180\nAnd maybe you're doing shared computers.\n\n285\n00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.590\nThat first person comes in,\nthey work a morning shift.\n\n286\n00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.290\nSomebody else comes in and\nworks the afternoon.\n\n287\n00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.360\nSomebody else comes in,\nworks the graveyard.\n\n288\n00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.220\nAs a security method, I know that\nperson that works the morning shift\n\n289\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.715\nshouldn't be logging in in the afternoon\nor during during that graveyard, so\n\n290\n00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.225\nI can limit their log on hours.\n\n291\n00:14:02.225 --> 00:14:05.175\nI can say, you're only allowed to log on,\nif they work nine to five,\n\n292\n00:14:05.175 --> 00:14:07.025\nI might say eight to six.\n\n293\n00:14:07.025 --> 00:14:09.755\nRight?\nThat way, if you're there later than that,\n\n294\n00:14:09.755 --> 00:14:12.365\nor you're coming back in in the middle\nof the night, if we're not a three-shift\n\n295\n00:14:12.365 --> 00:14:16.430\nshop, and trying to gain network access in\nthe middle of the night, you can't do it.\n\n296\n00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.110\nThe one thing to remember about that is\nit won't kick them off, all right, let's\n\n297\n00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.510\nsay you've said you can log on between\nnine and five and there 4:30, they're\n\n298\n00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.900\nworking away and 5:00 comes rolling\naround 5:30, they continue to work.\n\n299\n00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.890\nThey'll be good, they can continue\nto work but if they log off and\n\n300\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.960\ngo down to the soda machine and\nget a drink and\n\n301\n00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.780\ncome back they won't be able to\nlog on because it's after 5:00.\n\n302\n00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.460\nSo, it won't kick them out but\n\n303\n00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.560\nif they log off,\nit will prevent them from logging back on.\n\n304\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.940\n>> You know, this is actually\nsomething great to kinda show you,\n\n305\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.780\nbecause we can show you the way or\nwhere you can actually go and set that.\n\n306\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.380\nSo, you may actually be\nable to check this out for\n\n307\n00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.670\nevery user account that you need to.\n\n308\n00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.600\nSo, let's go ahead and\nshow you where that location is gonna be.\n\n309\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.090\nSo, even though it's not here\non my Windows 7 machine,\n\n310\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.140\nI can use this to get connected\nto the active directory as well.\n\n311\n00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:05.080\nSo I'm just gonna select my remote\ndesktop again and log back in.\n\n312\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.360\nI simply disconnected from it, so\nit should bring me back to the same place.\n\n313\n00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:15.540\nSo if I selected Mike at this point,\nI can right-click on Mike's user account.\n\n314\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.340\nSelect as properties, and\n\n315\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.480\nthen if I click on the account tab, notice\nI have this button for log on hours.\n\n316\n00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.195\nI'm gonna go ahead and make sure I don't\ndisable your account at this point,\n\n317\n00:15:25.195 --> 00:15:28.040\ncuz that will actually\ncause more problems too.\n\n318\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.040\nSo, if I select log on hours,\n\n319\n00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.490\nit's right here, that we can go ahead and\nactually select these hours in.\n\n320\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.700\nSo, if Mike, let's say he was working,\nhere let me go ahead and\n\n321\n00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.180\nlet's see log on denied here.\n\n322\n00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.800\nWe could do this, where we just get our\nMonday through Friday, or wait, hold on.\n\n323\n00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.870\nHow do I do this?\n\n324\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.100\nWe select that, and then do that.\n\n325\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.324\nAll right, that's what I was trying to do.\n\n326\n00:15:51.324 --> 00:15:52.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was trying to do that.\n\n327\n00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.692\nNow, the other way of course that's\nactually probably easier is if you select\n\n328\n00:15:55.692 --> 00:15:56.533\nthe whole thing.\n\n329\n00:15:56.533 --> 00:16:01.465\nAnd then, denial access and then select\nwhen log in is gonna be permitted at\n\n330\n00:16:01.465 --> 00:16:06.109\nthat point instead and that way,\nyou've got Monday through Friday.\n\n331\n00:16:06.109 --> 00:16:07.270\nWhere is eight?\n\n332\n00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:11.299\nI barely can see it, eight to five.\n\n333\n00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:14.970\nLike that and then Login Permitted.\n\n334\n00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.089\nAnd that way we can actually set that up,\nand\n\n335\n00:16:17.089 --> 00:16:19.830\nnow from 8:00 AM to 5:00 AM he can login.\n\n336\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.150\nAny time after that or before that,\nhe's just gonna to have to wait.\n\n337\n00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.856\nAnd so\nyou may see some consternation with that,\n\n338\n00:16:24.856 --> 00:16:27.430\nespecially an employee that\nlikes to come in really early.\n\n339\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.210\nAnd go, well,\nyou can come in early as you can.\n\n340\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.790\nYou won't be able to log in\nwith your domain credentials.\n\n341\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.810\nAnd this can also be a little bit unusual,\nbecause this is where somebody that's\n\n342\n00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.400\nnot really experienced with those two\ndifferent user accounts, where do they go?\n\n343\n00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.550\nWell, I can still log in.\n\n344\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.570\nI'm using my machine.\n\n345\n00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.040\nAnd now they start work let's say for\n30 minutes or\n\n346\n00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.870\nso everyday with that, and\nthey have to log off and\n\n347\n00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.520\nlog back in now and, where's my\nfile that I was working on before?\n\n348\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.550\nWell, then that's when you have\nto kind of juggle that situation.\n\n349\n00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.133\nOr you make exceptions right here.\n\n350\n00:16:53.133 --> 00:16:57.022\n>> Yeah, because these log on hours\nare only gonna prevent their domain\n\n351\n00:16:57.022 --> 00:17:00.524\naccount from logging on,\nbefore nine and after 5:00 PM.\n\n352\n00:17:00.524 --> 00:17:03.780\nNow their local account is not gonna be\nrestricted so that's what he was saying.\n\n353\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.000\nHe might come in at eight in the morning\nand log in, and think everything's fine.\n\n354\n00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.250\nBut they're actually logged on with\na local account, and then if my documents\n\n355\n00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.860\ndisappear, if they remember to log on\nwith their domain account at some point.\n\n356\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.050\n>> Now, Mike, I know that we also\nhave this other thing that we can do.\n\n357\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.840\nBecause we have access to that\ngreat Event Viewer, right?\n\n358\n00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.440\nWe have the ability to also do what we\ncall auditing the different logons that we\n\n359\n00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.070\nhave access to, and that's something\nthat we really should take advantage of\n\n360\n00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.800\nin an enterprise situation, right?\n\n361\n00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.250\n>> We really do,\nwe want to track those logon events.\n\n362\n00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.640\nWe need to know it, and not so much,\n\n363\n00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.440\nI mean I expect my end users\nto be logging on, right.\n\n364\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.130\nBut I need to know when there's\nproblem with authenticating.\n\n365\n00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.490\nI want to log that information,\nI might want to know when certain\n\n366\n00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.780\nfile servers are accessed, especially\nif they have sensitive information.\n\n367\n00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.710\nI might want to know when people are\nattempting to get access to things that\n\n368\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.768\nthey shouldn't get access to.\n\n369\n00:17:53.768 --> 00:17:55.110\nOr auditing logon events,\n\n370\n00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:59.130\nduring the middle of the night why\nare there logon events occurring\n\n371\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.430\nat 1 o'clock in the morning when\nthe building's closed and locked up?\n\n372\n00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.010\nRight.\nThose\n\n373\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.256\nare the kinds of things I love to see.\n\n374\n00:18:04.256 --> 00:18:06.905\nAnd if I'm not auditing,\nI'm not ever gonna know that's going on.\n\n375\n00:18:06.905 --> 00:18:11.770\nSo we can enable auditing for\nour account logons and our logon events.\n\n376\n00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.230\nAnd we can record that information.\n\n377\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.700\n>> So let's go ahead and\ntake a look at how we can do that and\n\n378\n00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.340\nwhat settings we really\nneed to pay attention to.\n\n379\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.080\nBecause this can really help you out,\nespecially when you're trying to see\n\n380\n00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.500\nwhether or not it's been successful or\na failed type of log in.\n\n381\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.900\nSo, back on my machine,\nwe're gonna go to the Event Viewer.\n\n382\n00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.500\nSo I'm gonna click on the Start button,\nand then I'm simply gonna type in Event.\n\n383\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.920\nFrom there, my programs bring up and\nI select Event Viewer.\n\n384\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.652\nOnce I have the Event Viewer open.\n\n385\n00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:41.670\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nfull screen this so\n\n386\n00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.649\nthat we can take a look\nat it a little bit more.\n\n387\n00:18:43.649 --> 00:18:49.080\nI'm gonna expand out my Windows logs and\nthen select security at this point.\n\n388\n00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.500\nAnd I already see that there are logs\nthat are actually happening as well.\n\n389\n00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.500\nAnd so that's where we're gonna\nsee this information show up.\n\n390\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.600\nBut if we want to actually logon or\nactually set those events,\n\n391\n00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.695\nwe need to go into the group policy right?\n\n392\n00:19:01.695 --> 00:19:04.340\nIs where we need to go, but I wanted\nto make sure that we actually saw that.\n\n393\n00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.780\nSo you're actually seeing where\nthese things are happening.\n\n394\n00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.650\nSuccesses as well as failures.\n\n395\n00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.280\nEvery individual computer we can\nactually set it here too, and so\n\n396\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.550\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n397\n00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:20.319\nSo if I select the start,\nI can type in gpedit.msc,\n\n398\n00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:27.740\nand then I'm gonna expand out\nthe Local Group Policy Editor.\n\n399\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:33.130\nFrom there, it's gonna be under Windows\nsettings, and then Security Settings\n\n400\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.846\nand this one is gonna be is it-\n>> Local?\n\n401\n00:19:36.846 --> 00:19:38.154\n>> Local Policies.\n\n402\n00:19:38.154 --> 00:19:40.410\nI always get that one,\nthere it is, Audit Policy.\n\n403\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.260\nSo that's what we're looking for\nis Audit Policies.\n\n404\n00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.610\nAnd there are a lot of these different\nsettings that are actually right here and\n\n405\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.798\navailable to us.\n\n406\n00:19:48.798 --> 00:19:51.740\nAnd what we're really looking for,\nespecially on log on's, hopefully you see\n\n407\n00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.540\nthe two words that say log on here,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.170\n>> Right?\n\n409\n00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.628\nAudit account logon events and\n\n410\n00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:59.540\nthen Audit logon events as well.\n\n411\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.540\nNow, when we start talking about\nthe differences between those two, and\n\n412\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.425\nI was trying to make sure that I\nunderstood it right before the show.\n\n413\n00:20:06.425 --> 00:20:10.325\nSo Mike, help us out here because\nsometimes I get it confused even though\n\n414\n00:20:10.325 --> 00:20:11.825\nI know I've dealt with them both before.\n\n415\n00:20:11.825 --> 00:20:12.925\n>> It really is confusing,\n\n416\n00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:17.770\ncuz they're both saying that they're gonna\naudit logon events, so which one do I use?\n\n417\n00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.687\nOr do we use both of them, and it depends\non what you're trying to capture.\n\n418\n00:20:20.687 --> 00:20:25.463\nIf you audit logon events, that one\nthat Ronnie has highlighted currently,\n\n419\n00:20:25.463 --> 00:20:30.310\nthat one is saying, I'm gonna make a new\nentry in the log file any time somebody\n\n420\n00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.486\nsuccessfully accesses this machine,\nall right.\n\n421\n00:20:33.486 --> 00:20:39.534\nSo if you're touching that machine or\nif you're connecting to it remotely,\n\n422\n00:20:39.534 --> 00:20:43.110\nthen it's gonna audit a logon event.\n\n423\n00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:47.550\nAccount logon events are done by\nthe system that is verifying the password,\n\n424\n00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.530\nwho's doing the authentication.\n\n425\n00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.450\nSo, in other words,\n\n426\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:54.810\nif I'm in a domain environment,\nmy machine is part of a domain.\n\n427\n00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.710\nWhen I sit at that machine, and log on,\nwell I'm authenticating to that computer,\n\n428\n00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.100\nso it's gonna register a logon event.\n\n429\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.880\nBut it's not actually\nchecking my password, right.\n\n430\n00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.110\nIt's being sent over to\nthe domain controller,\n\n431\n00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.630\nthat's where the authentication\nprocess is occurring.\n\n432\n00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:12.030\nSo the domain controller\nregisters an account logon event.\n\n433\n00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.420\nSo I got one event occurring\non a local machine.\n\n434\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.070\nAnother event occurring\non the domain controller.\n\n435\n00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:21.390\nNow, if we log in with a domain account or\nlet's say if we log in\n\n436\n00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:26.600\nwith a local account on my laptop,\nall right?\n\n437\n00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.870\nWell, now I'm touching this machine so the\nlogon event is gonna occur on this laptop.\n\n438\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.140\nBut it's a local account, so\n\n439\n00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.500\nit's being verified by the local SAM file\n>> So\n\n440\n00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.150\nthe authentication is also\noccurring on this machine.\n\n441\n00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.190\nSo both events would\nactually be recorded here.\n\n442\n00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.915\nSo what is it you're trying to audit,\nthat's what you've gotta think about,\n\n443\n00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:48.190\nbecause you gotta know if I'm\nauditing domain accounts and\n\n444\n00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.270\nI enable account logon here on this\nmachine, I'm never gonna see anything.\n\n445\n00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.150\nBecause it doesn't do\nthe authentication for\n\n446\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.750\ndomain accounts the domain\ncontroller does.\n\n447\n00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.110\nSo you gotta make sure you're enabling\nthis policy on the correct machine\n\n448\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.440\nto get what you want.\n\n449\n00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.000\n>> So here it is.\n\n450\n00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.490\nWe just went ahead and set it up for\nboth of them is what we did.\n\n451\n00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.450\nAnd notice that it doesn't actually\nbalk at you if you go ahead and\n\n452\n00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.710\nset it up for both.\n\n453\n00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.220\nBut that's what we have to\nunderstand is where in the world or\n\n454\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.820\nwhat are we really tracking at this point,\nand\n\n455\n00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.290\nwhere do we want to actually\nmake sure that we place this?\n\n456\n00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.304\nSo I'm just gonna use this local\nmachine account for us to do that.\n\n457\n00:22:18.304 --> 00:22:21.575\nSo Mike, you're saying that if I log,\nI'm hoping that this example is right.\n\n458\n00:22:21.575 --> 00:22:24.086\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I log in with my domain credentials,\n\n459\n00:22:24.086 --> 00:22:27.500\nit's this one that should be kicking in or\nis it the other one?\n\n460\n00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.420\n>> On this machine it\nshould be a logon event.\n\n461\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:29.950\n>> All right.\n\n462\n00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.760\n>> Yep.\n>> So now let's see if that happens here.\n\n463\n00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.810\nAnd there's my Event Viewer.\n\n464\n00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.665\nIf I log off, and\nI've actually got a success and a failure,\n\n465\n00:22:40.665 --> 00:22:42.285\nand we'll test them both out here.\n\n466\n00:22:42.285 --> 00:22:47.530\nSo one, I think I've actually enabled your\naccount again, if I remember correctly.\n\n467\n00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.365\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll switch over, here,\n\n468\n00:22:49.365 --> 00:22:54.250\nto Mike, lab/Mike\n>> And then we'll see here.\n\n469\n00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.300\nAnd I'm just gonna make up a password,\nright?\n\n470\n00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.340\nSo that should kind of register\nwhat a failure, right?\n\n471\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.340\nOkay so\nthat should end up registering a failure.\n\n472\n00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.360\nNow this time, if I log in as,\n\n473\n00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.934\nI don't think I should type\nit in correctly this time.\n\n474\n00:23:07.934 --> 00:23:10.910\n>> [LAUGH] Now the failure will probably\noccur on the domain controller cuz he's\n\n475\n00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.930\nthe one that's authenticating and\nthat's where it failed at.\n\n476\n00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:14.530\n>> Yeah.\n\n477\n00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.400\nSo if that happens, that's fine, but\nwe know that it actually did say,\n\n478\n00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.720\nlook here's one of these domain accounts,\nmake sure somebody registers it.\n\n479\n00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.680\nNow if I log on to this machine, though,\nwell we might actually be able to.\n\n480\n00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.790\nI don't know if I can check this out\nwith your account or not, let's see.\n\n481\n00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.555\nLet's see if it actually\ndoesn't show up here.\n\n482\n00:23:31.555 --> 00:23:33.460\n>> I know-\n>> Mike says, no it's not gonna show up.\n\n483\n00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.430\n>> I got this limited account,\nthat can't do anything.\n\n484\n00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:36.505\n[CROSSTALK] That's just crazy.\n\n485\n00:23:36.505 --> 00:23:39.630\n>> I know, yeah, Mike's so\nused to doing that, so here it is.\n\n486\n00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.540\nOh, nope, nope that's it, access denied.\n\n487\n00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.630\nYeah, so you can't actually do that Mike,\nso it's not actually letting you here.\n\n488\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:52.440\n>> And while he's getting ready to\ndo that good old run as, when you're\n\n489\n00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.070\nsetting up auditing you really wanna\nconsider what you're trying to capture and\n\n490\n00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.630\nsuccess or failure, do you wanna capture\nsuccessful logons, failed logons.\n\n491\n00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.459\nAnd you might think,\nwell who cares about successful logons?\n\n492\n00:24:02.459 --> 00:24:04.980\nI just wanna know when somebody\ntypes the wrong password or\n\n493\n00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.869\nsomebody's guessing passwords,\nso I'm just gonna do failure.\n\n494\n00:24:07.869 --> 00:24:09.831\nWell here's the problem\nwith that strategy.\n\n495\n00:24:09.831 --> 00:24:12.221\nLet's say this is occurring at\none o'clock in the morning, and\n\n496\n00:24:12.221 --> 00:24:15.970\nyou're gonna see failed attempt, failed\nattempt, failed attempt, failed attempt.\n\n497\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.760\nNow you know,\nsomebody's trying to do some password\n\n498\n00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.490\nguessing in the middle of the night.\n\n499\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.140\nBut then at 1:15,\nthe failed attempt stopped.\n\n500\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.020\nDid they get bored?\n\n501\n00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.870\nDid they give up?\n\n502\n00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.130\nDid somebody walk by and they ran away?\n\n503\n00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.380\nOr did they successfully log on and\nnow have access to your network.\n\n504\n00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.230\nYou don't know if you weren't auditing for\nsuccessful log ons right.\n\n505\n00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.830\nSo, things to ponder.\n\n506\n00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.500\n>> So here we have inside of that\nlocal machines account right\n\n507\n00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.810\n>> It shows that the operating system\n\n508\n00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:41.750\ntried to do the log.\n\n509\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.260\nAnd I think it's the same\ntime as Mike was using it.\n\n510\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.220\nAnd it says look, even that failed,\nso yes, you're not getting in.\n\n511\n00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.020\nSo we're on the domain controller\nif we're to check that out,\n\n512\n00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.580\nwe should also see the same thing.\n\n513\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.580\nBut this auditing is really effective.\n\n514\n00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.060\nIt allows us to collate\na lot of data very quickly.\n\n515\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.930\nAnd that way we can check what machine\nMike's been trying to attempt to log on,\n\n516\n00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.122\nand unsuccessfully\nhopefully a lot of times.\n\n517\n00:25:01.122 --> 00:25:02.368\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If we actually don't want him logging\n\n518\n00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:03.570\nonto those machines.\n\n519\n00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.090\nSo, this is a really useful tool for us.\n\n520\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.190\n>> It is, and\nit's something that we have to do again.\n\n521\n00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.080\nYou've got to come up\nwith a good strategy,\n\n522\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.230\nplan out your auditing because you want\nto catch all that important information.\n\n523\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.330\nYou don't want to capture too much,\n\n524\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.950\nbecause then it becomes difficult\nto look through the log files.\n\n525\n00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.470\nAnd find that important info.\n\n526\n00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.510\n>> Right, so we also have to deal\nwith one of the other issues too.\n\n527\n00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.760\nNow we've already spent a little bit\nof time in other episodes talking about\n\n528\n00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.790\nthe Windows firewall, and\nalso the advanced firewall.\n\n529\n00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.190\nSo this is just more of a reminder,\nthat you do need to make sure that\n\n530\n00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.320\nthese things are set up\nthe way that they need to be.\n\n531\n00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.890\nIf a user is not able to connect to\nthe programs that they need to connect to,\n\n532\n00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.670\nthat's going to be an issue that you\nmay actually need to deal with in\n\n533\n00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.210\nthe firewall as well.\n\n534\n00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.810\nNow, when we start taking a look at,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n535\n00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:50.620\ntake a look on my machine here, remember\nthat we have access to the basic firewall.\n\n536\n00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.320\nI know they don't call it that anymore.\n\n537\n00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.990\nThey just call it the Windows firewall.\n\n538\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.920\nBut you have access to, well,\nthe WIndows Firewall and\n\n539\n00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.740\nthe Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n540\n00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.570\nI like going here first,\nit doesn't necessarily mean you have to,\n\n541\n00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.600\na lot of times.\n\n542\n00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.000\nBut right here it actually tells us\nwhether or not the firewall is working.\n\n543\n00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.920\nAnd this is actually very important.\n\n544\n00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.730\nRight.\nIn Windows itself and Windows 7 it turn on\n\n545\n00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.540\nall the three profiles right away,\nthose network profiles.\n\n546\n00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.540\nInstead of making you choose which one\nyou're connecting to and then turn it on.\n\n547\n00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.790\nSo they've tried to say look we know that\nin the past people have gotten confused,\n\n548\n00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.110\nand what happens is it goes\nto the public network, and\n\n549\n00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:29.420\nthey automatically go, no I don't want it\non and oh no now they've turned it off.\n\n550\n00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.350\nAnd then when we connect back in they\nturn it on and that's fine and it works.\n\n551\n00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.160\nBut here they say, look,\nby default let's leave it on.\n\n552\n00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.180\nMost of the time if a user cannot\nconnect to a program, it's fairly easy.\n\n553\n00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.580\nAll you have to do is allow a programmer\nfeature through the firewall.\n\n554\n00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.810\nAnd then, in this list,\n\n555\n00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.610\nis already a bunch of things that\nWindows has already allowed.\n\n556\n00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:54.050\nAnd even sometimes you've\nactually seen where other\n\n557\n00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:57.810\nprograms have actually been installed,\nare now also gonna be listed here.\n\n558\n00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.640\nLet me go ahead and get access to this.\n\n559\n00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.950\nSo, you can see a lot of names here.\n\n560\n00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.170\nAnd then I'm gonna scroll\nall the down here.\n\n561\n00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.710\nHere is TightVNC,\nthis is a program that I installed.\n\n562\n00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.620\nAnd it's actually being\nallowed all the way through.\n\n563\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.570\nIf I wanna change that condition\nwhere the public firewall,\n\n564\n00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.920\nI don't want that to be able to access,\nI can do that.\n\n565\n00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.530\nBut, there are other things too.\n\n566\n00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.230\nWhat if your program isn't listed here?\n\n567\n00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:23.070\nWell, notice that you can actually select\nallow another program in here, and\n\n568\n00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.570\nthen browse directly to it,\n\n569\n00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:29.360\nif you know the path itself, or\nyou can actually select something else.\n\n570\n00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.040\nSo, a lot of times you can actually\nuse just that simple nature of things,\n\n571\n00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.310\nthe way that the Windows firewall works,\nto allow that to happen.\n\n572\n00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.370\nNow the problem that we have though is\nthat once you start making exceptions\n\n573\n00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.840\non one computer, it begins to get a little\nbit testy, because now you have one\n\n574\n00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.710\ncomputer that has access to things that,\nmaybe I meant it to be temporary, but I\n\n575\n00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:52.230\nreally don't want it to be that way where\nthat one computer accidentally does that.\n\n576\n00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.680\nSo you might wanna lock this down instead,\nand\n\n577\n00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.280\nmake sure that you control\nit through group policy.\n\n578\n00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.240\nAnd in group policy, you instead can\nactually go and have access to this one,\n\n579\n00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.740\nwhich is, of course, the advanced settings\nand control that one through group policy.\n\n580\n00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.890\nAnd this is where you can set it up\nbeyond just that list of stuff, and\n\n581\n00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:14.280\ndo poor numbers,\nyou name it, other programs.\n\n582\n00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.310\nThere's a whole list of\nstuff that we can do here.\n\n583\n00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.910\n>> Yeah there is.\n\n584\n00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.900\nAnd it's just much more granular\ncontrol over the firewall.\n\n585\n00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.640\nYou've got separate inbound rules for\noutbound rules, as Ronnie said,\n\n586\n00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.610\nwe can allow things via program or\nby port number.\n\n587\n00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.210\nWe can really start playing with\nthe scope, the sub meta dresses and\n\n588\n00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.890\nthings like that.\n\n589\n00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.620\nSo a lot more control over\nthe firewall settings, and\n\n590\n00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:41.120\nadding a rule there versus adding a rule\nusing group policy, the exact same wizard.\n\n591\n00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.780\nYou're just doing it in group policy so\n\n592\n00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.110\nthat means I don't have\nto touch every machine.\n\n593\n00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.550\nI can push that setting out\n\n594\n00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.190\nto all the machines that I\nwanna scope that policy to.\n\n595\n00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.910\nSo firewall rules\nobviously very important.\n\n596\n00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.340\nWe've gotta make sure that we're not\nclosing ports that need to be open, or\n\n597\n00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.090\nopening ports that need to be closed.\n\n598\n00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.160\nWindows Firewall is, Windows 7 has\na really good firewall built into it.\n\n599\n00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.510\nI really like it.\n>> Yeah, it really is.\n\n600\n00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.400\nIt's so granular.\n\n601\n00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.460\nIt does give you that control if you need\nit, but if you don't really need it and\n\n602\n00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.080\nalso gives that basic one.\n\n603\n00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.030\nBut if you wanted to see that setting,\nright?\n\n604\n00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:16.170\nInside of the group policy is\nfairly easy location to get to.\n\n605\n00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.195\nI think even I can remember\nthat's how easy it is.\n\n606\n00:29:18.195 --> 00:29:19.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I go ahead,\n\n607\n00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.340\nI just use the local group policy editor.\n\n608\n00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.340\nAnd the computer configuration and\nthen WIndows settings.\n\n609\n00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:30.270\nAnd the Window settings it is\na Security Settings, and it is,\n\n610\n00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.230\nin Security Settings here.\n\n611\n00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:36.080\nNotice that you have this whole node right\nhere where it says Windows Firewall with\n\n612\n00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.470\nAdvanced Security.\n\n613\n00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.640\nAnd it's right inside here.\n\n614\n00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.550\nAnd in a moment, you actually see it\nlooks really just about identical\n\n615\n00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:47.800\nto what you can actually set up, those\ninbound rules, outbound rules, as well as\n\n616\n00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.860\nconnection security rules if you needed\nthose, that type of granularity.\n\n617\n00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.940\nSo we can set this domain wide if we\nneed to, or just certain scoped groups\n\n618\n00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.910\nInside of our domain, you name it,\nwe can control it that way.\n\n619\n00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.090\nAnd that way, people don't just go, you\nknow what I'm gonna do, just to test it?\n\n620\n00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.800\nI'm gonna turn the firewall off.\n\n621\n00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.580\nWe can instead lock it\ndown this way as well.\n\n622\n00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.540\nSo there's a lot of control that you have.\n\n623\n00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.830\nBut you do have to actually\nmake sure that you understand\n\n624\n00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.400\nwhat programs need to be going through\nyour firewall, and which ones don't.\n\n625\n00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.690\nCuz if you block one by accident,\n\n626\n00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.110\npeople are gonna have a hard\nday doing their jobs.\n\n627\n00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.970\n>> All right Ronnie.\n\n628\n00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.490\nVery good,\na lot of great information there.\n\n629\n00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.900\nKeeping our machines safe and being able\nto help our users troubleshoot issues\n\n630\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.640\nwith accounts, accessing resources,\nand good old firewalls.\n\n631\n00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.580\nSo great job, Ronnie.\n\n632\n00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.960\nAppreciate that.\n\n633\n00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.030\nBut for this episode that is gonna do it.\n\n634\n00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.170\nSo signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n635\n00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:38.980\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n636\n00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.735\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n637\n00:30:41.735 --> 00:30:45.960\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:14.785\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:16.645\nWith me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:17.545\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:18.495\n>> I'm doing great today.\n\n7\n00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:22.515\nIt's another great day to be right here,\nas we take a look at supporting Windows 7.\n\n8\n00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.825\nRemember that this is not\nan exam-centric type of show.\n\n9\n00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.505\nWhat we're trying to do, of course,\n\n10\n00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.685\nis talk about some of the issues that we\nface, as well network support technicians\n\n11\n00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:33.955\na lot of times,\nas well as enterprise administrators too.\n\n12\n00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:37.110\nMaking sure that we understand that,\na lot of stuff even though it's covered on\n\n13\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.070\nthe exam and that's good material, there's\na lot of things that we just have to\n\n14\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820\nbe aware of, and we need to learn how and\nbe able to troubleshoot as well.\n\n15\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.370\nAnd today we need to focus in a little\nbit on hardware troubleshooting,\n\n16\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.350\nis what we need to do.\n\n17\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.090\n>> Always fun.\n\n18\n00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.050\nYeah, something that\nwe're gonna have to do.\n\n19\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.960\nWe're gonna have hardware\nthat gives us issues.\n\n20\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.580\nOur users are gonna call us up.\n\n21\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.070\nAnd we gotta be able to fix these things.\n\n22\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.120\nSo one of the first things\nI think we wanna look at,\n\n23\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.500\nRonnie, is probably drivers,\ncuz that's really where it all starts.\n\n24\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.090\nI can't use that piece of hardware until\nmy computer knows how to talk to it.\n\n25\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.110\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n26\n00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.750\nWhenever we start talking about the driver\nissues that are out there, it is\n\n27\n00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.550\nthe driver that becomes the translator\nbetween our operating system and\n\n28\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.520\nthe hardware that we install into\nthat operating system as well.\n\n29\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.590\nNow drivers usually are going to be\ndeveloped by the hardware vendor, and\n\n30\n00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.040\nso this is where we end up getting issues.\n\n31\n00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.510\nA lot of times when they develop it,\n\n32\n00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.950\nit could be that they develop it to\nactually work perfectly with Windows.\n\n33\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.750\nBut sometimes they\ndevelop it independently,\n\n34\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.340\nsaying well it probably\nworks with Windows,\n\n35\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.850\nbut it may not work with Windows,\nand we have issues that may come up.\n\n36\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.960\nNow, this has happened to me.\n\n37\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.470\nRight now as I've actually\ngone to the Mac Book,\n\n38\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.750\nI had a USB docking station designed for\nWindows.\n\n39\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.590\nAnd I'm having a driver issue because,\n\n40\n00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.930\nwell, even though that device was\nactually designed for Windows,\n\n41\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.260\nsomebody's actually tried to take the\ndriver and make it work inside of Mac OS.\n\n42\n00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.230\nAnd so at that point here,\nthe driver may work and it may not.\n\n43\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.290\nNow, you might be going, Ronnie,\nwe're talking about Windows,\n\n44\n00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.490\nwhy the heck are you bringing in Mac?\n\n45\n00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.660\nWell, because inside of Windows,\nwe can have drivers that\n\n46\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.340\nwe actually get installed on our\ncomputers that do the same thing.\n\n47\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.590\nAnd one of the things that Windows\nhas tried to do over the years\n\n48\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.580\nis to prevent issues like this by\nrequiring the drivers to be signed.\n\n49\n00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.050\nDigitally signed so that they actually\nsay look, this is checked out,\n\n50\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.120\nwe believe the code in this\ndriver will work perfectly fine.\n\n51\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.210\nAnd even then a lot of those drivers are\nalso packaged inside of Windows too, so\n\n52\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.190\nwe don't have to worry about going out and\nhunting down drivers a lot of times.\n\n53\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.370\n>> Yeah, Windows comes with\na very large driver.cab file,\n\n54\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.930\nif they still call it that.\n\n55\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.440\nI think they do.\n\n56\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.700\nAnd that's basically what Ronnie said.\n\n57\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.800\nIt's just a library of drivers, and so\njust about any device you plug into\n\n58\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.860\nyour Windows operating system, it's gonna\nat least recognize and be able to use.\n\n59\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.220\nThat doesn't mean we don't wanna go\nout and get another driver for it.\n\n60\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.310\nAll right,\nthat's a generic driver built by Windows.\n\n61\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.985\nGood thing to do would be go to\nmanufacturer and get their latest driver,\n\n62\n00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.005\nright, the people that made the device.\n\n63\n00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:11.475\nSometimes those generic drivers will let\nyou communicate with a piece of hardware,\n\n64\n00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:13.935\nbut won't let you take\nadvantage of all the features.\n\n65\n00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:17.695\nI know graphics cards are a big one where\nyou've got a driver in Windows that you\n\n66\n00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:23.490\nbuy that nice ATI Radeon or\nwhatever the latest graphics card is,\n\n67\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.140\nand Windows recognizes it and\nallows you to use it.\n\n68\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.010\nBut if you go out there and\nget that driver from ATI or from Nvidia or\n\n69\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.230\nwhomever, now all of a sudden you\nget this great little interface and\n\n70\n00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.840\nyou can start controlling color spectrums,\nI mean everything, right?\n\n71\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.750\nSo sometimes even though Windows has\na driver, we still might want to go obtain\n\n72\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.980\nthe driver from the manufacturer or\nthe one that came on the media.\n\n73\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.100\n>> And that's actually one of the best\nthings that we can do, right?\n\n74\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.690\nThat basic installation is\nreally about functionality.\n\n75\n00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.130\nThe only thing that Windows cares about,\nright,\n\n76\n00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.150\nis that code works inside of Windows.\n\n77\n00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.680\nAnd so, they don't tend to actually\ninstall all those additional\n\n78\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.480\nfeatures that Mike was talking about.\n\n79\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.870\nThe manufacturer of that device wants you\nto use all the features that are available\n\n80\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.800\nbecause they believe that that's gonna\nactually make you a loyal customer, and\n\n81\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.060\nyou coming back to that product too.\n\n82\n00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.040\nSo when you do have these drivers, and\n\n83\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.190\nyou think about one of the issues\nthat you will face a lot of times.\n\n84\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.980\nI think of webcams more often than not,\ncuz those are the ones I've dealt with for\n\n85\n00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.710\nthe last few years, is that\nsometimes they work perfectly fine.\n\n86\n00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.030\nYou know it turns on, it turns off.\n\n87\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.293\nBut then when somebody says no you\ncan take that webcam and zoom it, or\n\n88\n00:04:26.293 --> 00:04:29.462\nyou can actually add the little\nflaming hat or head whatever it is.\n\n89\n00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:34.003\nI don't see that feature or option,\nwas always go out to that website and\n\n90\n00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:38.254\nmake sure you download the latest\ndriver and install that on there.\n\n91\n00:04:38.254 --> 00:04:40.086\nAnd then, yes, you do get those features.\n\n92\n00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:41.939\nSo having the correct driver and\n\n93\n00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:46.370\na lot of times the most up-to-date\ndriver is what helps you out there.\n\n94\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.030\nSometimes, even if you're\nmissing something or\n\n95\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.290\nit's not working perfecting fine,\nupdating it will help, too.\n\n96\n00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.050\n>> Yeah, reinstalling it or updating it.\n\n97\n00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.430\nOne of the common mistakes we\nmake is buying a device, and\n\n98\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.300\nin that box came a DVD or\nCD with the driver on it.\n\n99\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.060\nWe assume that that's the latest driver.\n\n100\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.140\nBut, if we think about\nthe manufacturing process and\n\n101\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.230\nthings like that, that box could have been\npacked up months ago, shipped overseas,\n\n102\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.480\nsit on a shelf in a store somewhere before\nyou actually went and picked it up.\n\n103\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.730\nSo, the driver's already months old and\nthere could have been a security\n\n104\n00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.668\nupdate that's come out for that, or\na functionality addition, or fix.\n\n105\n00:05:21.668 --> 00:05:25.910\nSo, install the device, use that\ndriver that came on the media, and\n\n106\n00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.930\nthen turn around and\ngo out to the manufacturers website,\n\n107\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.320\nand make sure that you do have the latest\ndriver, any updates that are available.\n\n108\n00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.230\n>> There's no doubt that this\nis kind of the pattern that\n\n109\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.750\nyou normally end up seeing.\n\n110\n00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.420\nBut even today it's actually\nbecome more automatic for us.\n\n111\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.960\nThe last printer I bought, and that was\nstill I'm gonna say a few years ago.\n\n112\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.790\nI didn't even have to download a driver,\nMike.\n\n113\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.175\nAutomatically when we plugged that thing\nin and the machine recognized it, it told\n\n114\n00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:53.785\nme, it was like hey, this particular\nwhatever number, 3510 I think is what it\n\n115\n00:05:53.785 --> 00:05:58.395\nwas, says would like to go out to HP's\nwebsite and download the latest driver.\n\n116\n00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:03.535\nSo, I didn't even have to say, I need\nto and check if there's a newer driver.\n\n117\n00:06:03.535 --> 00:06:07.615\nThat device plugged into the network,\nit automatically knew it was plugged in,\n\n118\n00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:09.475\nit automatically knew\nthat it had to go and\n\n119\n00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:13.130\ncheck for the latest driver to\ndownload and install as well.\n\n120\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.150\nSo it's kind of almost\nspooky in the background.\n\n121\n00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.860\nBecause now you don't realize what's\nactually getting turned on on your\n\n122\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.620\nmachines what they're plugging in,\nand what they're installing, and\n\n123\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.920\nwhat they're leaving on.\n\n124\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.930\nBut having these up-to-date\ndrivers are very important.\n\n125\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.700\nSometimes updating\ndrivers can cause issues.\n\n126\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.140\nAnd that's what we also\nhave to deal with as well.\n\n127\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.220\nSo the good thing is we\ncan show you about that,\n\n128\n00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.960\nand even when you actually have\nto deal with driver problems.\n\n129\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.040\nAnd so let's go ahead and do that,\n\n130\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.360\nwe wanna go into that place that we call\nthe device manager is where we wanna head.\n\n131\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.360\nSo here it is on Windows 7,\ncouple of ways we can get to it, but\n\n132\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.260\nif I go ahead and select the start button,\nI like to right click on computer, and\n\n133\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.940\ngo to manage, is what I like to do.\n\n134\n00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.840\nAnd that brings up the computer\nmanagement console.\n\n135\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.100\nAnd inside the computer\nmanagement console,\n\n136\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.490\nthere's the device driver\nlisted right there.\n\n137\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.180\nAnd this is what we're\nnormally looking for.\n\n138\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.530\nUsually, if you do see other symbols right\nhere at this particular point in time,\n\n139\n00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.660\nlike a yellow symbol,\nthat normally is an indicator, that hey,\n\n140\n00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.610\ndrivers probably missing or\nyou know somethings wrong.\n\n141\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.010\nI'm not talking to that device.\n\n142\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.310\nIt says I see it, but there's no way\nI can communicate with that device.\n\n143\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.910\nAnd I'm seeing that over time on several\n\n144\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.960\nof these different options that\nyou see right here before you.\n\n145\n00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.770\nSo what you can actually\nend up doing then,\n\n146\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.990\nif you do have some device like that,\nwell what ends up happening.\n\n147\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.130\nSo let's see what we're gonna do.\n\n148\n00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.690\nLet's do this mouse here.\n\n149\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.130\nAnd you see where it's actually\nthe VMware pointing device at this point.\n\n150\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.120\nSo there's a couple of things, right?\n\n151\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.410\nIf you go,\nI don't know how old this driver is,\n\n152\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.490\nyou can possibly update this driver.\n\n153\n00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.916\nAnd this is where you would go out and\ntry and find that manufacturer's driver.\n\n154\n00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:51.872\nNow, that's actually not something\nI wanna do on this one, but\n\n155\n00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:54.791\nlet's say it was a Logitech mouse,\nor whatever it is, right?\n\n156\n00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:59.162\nYou go out and you download that And now\nall of the sudden the left pinky button\n\n157\n00:07:59.162 --> 00:08:02.643\nthat they've installed,\nthe six button mouse is on there,\n\n158\n00:08:02.643 --> 00:08:05.760\nit doesn't work the way\nthat it says it should.\n\n159\n00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.560\nBut, it was working fine\npreviously when you did that.\n\n160\n00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.390\nWell, what you can is you can simply take,\nlet's say that mouse.\n\n161\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.600\nI'm gonna make this represent that mouse.\n\n162\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.350\nAnd then, I can go to Properties,\nand I can select this Driver tab.\n\n163\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.030\nAnd if I had just updated that\nparticular driver, what I could do,\n\n164\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.530\nis I would select that Roll Back Driver.\n\n165\n00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.440\nWhen you install a new driver over\nthe old one, it doesn't just erase it.\n\n166\n00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.240\nIt stores it in some secret location.\n\n167\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.329\nMike may actually know the exact path.\n\n168\n00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:33.338\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of where that secret location is.\n\n169\n00:08:33.338 --> 00:08:35.056\nI know it's hidden, I know it's secret.\n\n170\n00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:36.810\nI know it's not something I'm\nnot supposed to mess with.\n\n171\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.509\nBut Mike may actually\nbe going in their like,\n\n172\n00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:40.977\nyeah I've actually messed with\nthis before, and that's fine.\n\n173\n00:08:40.977 --> 00:08:45.656\nBut it does, it stores it there just in\ncase the new driver that you actually\n\n174\n00:08:45.656 --> 00:08:48.390\ninstalled, it kind of wigs out on you.\n\n175\n00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.640\nAnd you can actually get that.\n\n176\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.480\nIt's like roll back.\n\n177\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.230\n>> It's a very handy feature because\nyou can end up doing like Ronnie said,\n\n178\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.460\nupdating your driver.\n\n179\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.123\nThings go bad.\n\n180\n00:08:56.123 --> 00:08:59.106\nI want to go back to when\nthat device was working.\n\n181\n00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:01.850\nWhat driver did I have before this?\n\n182\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.860\nI didn't go and memorize all my driver\nversions or anything like that.\n\n183\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.700\nOr a user calls me up and says, hey,\nI thought I was helping you out.\n\n184\n00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.230\nI found this new driver for\nmy network adapter, I installed it.\n\n185\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.730\nTurns out I got the wrong one, or\nit's now broken something else.\n\n186\n00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.700\nCan you fix my computer?\n\n187\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.520\nWell, I don't know what driver they\nhad before that that actually worked.\n\n188\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.060\nWith this, it's easy.\n\n189\n00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.170\nI just go in there and Roll Back Driver.\n\n190\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.520\nIf that driver's preventing\nyou from starting the machine,\n\n191\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.860\nthen you can go into Safe Mode and\ndo a Roll Back Driver.\n\n192\n00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.180\nBut it's not gonna be available until\nyou've at least updated the driver once.\n\n193\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.004\nIt also only remembers\nthe last one driver.\n\n194\n00:09:37.004 --> 00:09:41.511\nSo if you went from driver a,\nto driver b, to driver c, to driver d,\n\n195\n00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:46.110\nyou can roll back to driver c, but\nyou're not gonna get back to b or a.\n\n196\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.662\nIt only remembers the last used driver,\nbut a very handy feature.\n\n197\n00:09:49.662 --> 00:09:52.498\n>> Yeah it's a very handy\nfeature to roll that back, and\n\n198\n00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:55.850\nthen a lot of times right away,\nyou can try and test if it works.\n\n199\n00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.070\nBut you may also have\nto reboot the computer.\n\n200\n00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.480\nAnd then once rebooting, everything gets\nreset, and now everything works again.\n\n201\n00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.650\nThen you know it's a driver at that point.\n\n202\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.980\nBut what if we weren't\neven at that point yet?\n\n203\n00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.900\nAnother thing that we can do is we\ncan try and disable that driver.\n\n204\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.846\nNow I switched off of that\nVMWare pointing device,\n\n205\n00:10:10.846 --> 00:10:13.391\ncuz I don't know if that would\nactually affect my mouse right now.\n\n206\n00:10:13.391 --> 00:10:17.206\nSo I didn't want to take that chance\nof me getting locked out of my\n\n207\n00:10:17.206 --> 00:10:20.760\nvirtual machine by turning\nthe virtual mouse pointer out.\n\n208\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.240\nNotice I have this Bluetooth\ndevice down here, so\n\n209\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.818\nI was looking at it\nwhile Mike was talking.\n\n210\n00:10:26.818 --> 00:10:30.190\nI'm gonna right-click on that one, and\nthen I can go back down to Properties.\n\n211\n00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.250\nI do have that shortcut menu that\ngives me the same options, but\n\n212\n00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.256\nnotice that we have this\nability to disable the driver.\n\n213\n00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:39.090\nAnd this may actually be one of\nthe first troubleshooting steps\n\n214\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.940\nyou really want to actually check out,\nas well.\n\n215\n00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.980\nBy disabling it you're not having\nto uninstall the driver and\n\n216\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.980\ncompletely remove it, but you're saying\nI that the driver may be the issue here.\n\n217\n00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.060\nAnd what I can do is just disable it so\nit's not recognized, and\n\n218\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.560\nnow let's see what happens with that\ndevice once it's actually disabled.\n\n219\n00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.010\nIs it still functioning, or is it no\nlonger functional, whatever it is here?\n\n220\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.583\nAnd you find out that that's\nactually the driver that's there,\n\n221\n00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:05.638\nthen you can go ahead and uninstall it or\nyou can choose that Roll Back Driver.\n\n222\n00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:09.556\nI mean, installing is probably the last\none that we would really want to do and\n\n223\n00:11:09.556 --> 00:11:11.690\nthen that way update a new driver.\n\n224\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.373\nBecause if we have that Roll Back feature,\n\n225\n00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.823\nthat's probably the safer way\nto go when we start doing this.\n\n226\n00:11:15.823 --> 00:11:17.321\nOr it's the problem that Mike mentioned.\n\n227\n00:11:17.321 --> 00:11:20.770\nI don't have a clue what\ndriver I just uninstalled.\n\n228\n00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.812\nOh, you mean the name began with an H,\nbut then it had a Z and a letter J.\n\n229\n00:11:23.812 --> 00:11:25.773\nWas that a zero, or an O?\n\n230\n00:11:25.773 --> 00:11:29.620\nWas that a one or\nan L that was in that driver?\n\n231\n00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.640\nI don't know.\n\n232\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.230\nAnd that's the way, I don't know\nwhat it is about driver names,\n\n233\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.210\nthey don't tend to be intuitive at all.\n\n234\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.446\nThey tend to be some string of characters\nthat only somebody that actually developed\n\n235\n00:11:38.446 --> 00:11:39.503\nthat driver understands.\n\n236\n00:11:39.503 --> 00:11:43.374\nBut we are starting to see a little more\ncontinuity with that, whereas especially\n\n237\n00:11:43.374 --> 00:11:47.110\non printers, right, you're starting\nto see more universal drivers.\n\n238\n00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.973\nWhere it's just like, all right,\nthis is it for all of our devices.\n\n239\n00:11:49.973 --> 00:11:53.235\nAnd it lets you know that hey, they're\nstarting to understand that it's getting\n\n240\n00:11:53.235 --> 00:11:55.200\na little bit too complicated as well.\n\n241\n00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.950\nSo drivers are a big one that\nwe do have to worry about.\n\n242\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.160\nNow most of the time, the drivers we deal\nwith today, plug and play automatically.\n\n243\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:09.600\nWe don't have to worry about them too\noften, as far as not finding a driver.\n\n244\n00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.391\nBut you may have an older, way older\ndevice, that all of a sudden you go, hey,\n\n245\n00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:15.923\nthe driver is not found.\n\n246\n00:12:15.923 --> 00:12:17.757\nI don't see it in my Device Manager.\n\n247\n00:12:17.757 --> 00:12:19.103\nIs there anything we can do, Mike?\n\n248\n00:12:19.103 --> 00:12:22.980\n>> Yeah, you can, again, go out to\nthe manufacturer and download it.\n\n249\n00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.762\nMost of these things that you\ndownload are gonna be executables.\n\n250\n00:12:25.762 --> 00:12:26.670\nYou double-click on it, they run.\n\n251\n00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.698\nThey launch some crazy wizard,\nyou walk through the process.\n\n252\n00:12:29.698 --> 00:12:32.345\nYou install the driver,\nyou're done, good to go.\n\n253\n00:12:32.345 --> 00:12:35.366\nBut dealing with some of those\nolder devices, you go and\n\n254\n00:12:35.366 --> 00:12:38.780\nyou download the driver,\nyou extract out the zip file.\n\n255\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.629\nAnd it's just a few infs or ini files.\n\n256\n00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:42.522\nWhat do you do with that?\n\n257\n00:12:42.522 --> 00:12:45.505\nThere's nothing to double-click on,\nhow the heck do I install that driver?\n\n258\n00:12:45.505 --> 00:12:50.005\nAnd that's where we have to do that\nmanual driver installation where we\n\n259\n00:12:50.005 --> 00:12:54.130\ngo right back into Device Manager,\ntell it to update the driver.\n\n260\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.115\nAnd now we're just gonna browse and\npoint it to those driver files.\n\n261\n00:12:58.115 --> 00:13:00.100\n>> So that's actually a nice thing here,\nright?\n\n262\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.723\nSo let's just take for an example,\nwhat Mike was talking about.\n\n263\n00:13:02.723 --> 00:13:06.555\nIf we have went ahead, and\nwe expanded out that zip file.\n\n264\n00:13:06.555 --> 00:13:07.555\nAnd we're ready to go.\n\n265\n00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:11.735\nWe can go ahead and then browse to the\ncomputer location where we believe that\n\n266\n00:13:11.735 --> 00:13:13.660\ndriver is and then select it.\n\n267\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.020\nOr you can try and\nactually do it from here.\n\n268\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.355\nSo if you can't find it for,\nand I've seen this happen on,\n\n269\n00:13:18.355 --> 00:13:21.533\nactually printer drivers are the ones\nI've seen where they bury it like folder,\n\n270\n00:13:21.533 --> 00:13:23.046\nfolder, folder, folder, folder.\n\n271\n00:13:23.046 --> 00:13:23.941\nAnd then there's one location.\n\n272\n00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:25.543\nBut you have those options right here.\n\n273\n00:13:25.543 --> 00:13:29.641\n>> Yeah, if you downloaded it and\nextract it out, you'll know where it is.\n\n274\n00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:32.550\nIf you do the let me pick from\na list of drivers on my computer,\n\n275\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.828\nguess where it's going?\n\n276\n00:13:33.828 --> 00:13:38.460\nTo that driver.cab file, that monster list\nof drivers that Windows comes with, right.\n\n277\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.420\nWe can go check there and\n\n278\n00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.820\nsee if they've got a driver that\nmight be compatible with this device.\n\n279\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.230\n>> And if you don't have it there, the\nother place that you can also get, right,\n\n280\n00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.680\nif you do have it on\nthe thumb drive per chance\n\n281\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.610\nthat you actually were on somebody\nelse's machine and you download it.\n\n282\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.386\nYou can select Have Disk, and\nnotice it says from drive A.\n\n283\n00:13:54.386 --> 00:13:57.346\nMike, when was the last time\nyou saw drive A anywhere?\n\n284\n00:13:57.346 --> 00:14:00.447\n>> Oh gee, 1989, I don't know.\n\n285\n00:14:00.447 --> 00:14:04.178\n>> Somewhere along there, right, drive\nA was that five and a quarter floppy or\n\n286\n00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:06.430\nthree and a half inch floppy that you had.\n\n287\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.820\nBut you don't always have to select that.\n\n288\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.020\nYou just simply select Browse,\nand then mount it to your USB.\n\n289\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.733\nFind the driver that you need and\nhave it install, and\n\n290\n00:14:13.733 --> 00:14:15.375\nthat will also help you out too.\n\n291\n00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:19.640\nAnd then, your driver will be manually\ninstalled, and you will be ready to go,\n\n292\n00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.370\nat least, hopefully you will.\n\n293\n00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.900\nNow, you can't expect every\ndevice to work with it.\n\n294\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.310\nThere are other things that\nhave happened over time.\n\n295\n00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.870\nIf you actually are installing\nthis manually in today's day and\n\n296\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:33.120\nage, there may be a chance, I'm going\nto say there's a good chance that\n\n297\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.331\nthat device probably is not going to\nwork the way you want it to work.\n\n298\n00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:39.325\n>> Yeah, the last time I had to do\nthat was an old 3Com network adapter.\n\n299\n00:14:39.325 --> 00:14:43.353\nAnd the driver that you had got for\nit was just a couple of INF files, and\n\n300\n00:14:43.353 --> 00:14:44.863\nthere was no executable.\n\n301\n00:14:44.863 --> 00:14:46.188\nNow Ronnie, drivers,\n\n302\n00:14:46.188 --> 00:14:50.970\nbig issue that we have to deal with when\nit comes to troubleshooting hardware.\n\n303\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.690\nAnother thing they got to worry\nabout is memory right, and\n\n304\n00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.840\nmemory errors, I don't know,\nit kinda goes both ways.\n\n305\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.350\nIt can be tricky to troubleshoot,\n\n306\n00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.320\nalthough there are a couple of things that\nhelp us to make it a little bit easier.\n\n307\n00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.235\n>> They really are.\nThe problem with memory issues is\n\n308\n00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:07.317\nthat they act like well, every other issue\nthat's wrong with the machine, right.\n\n309\n00:15:07.317 --> 00:15:11.195\nA memory issue can look exact like there's\na corrupt file on your hard drive,\n\n310\n00:15:11.195 --> 00:15:13.600\non your operating system I should say,\nright.\n\n311\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.590\nIt can lock up your machine,\nit can cause it to reboot.\n\n312\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.965\nIt can do so many other things.\n\n313\n00:15:17.965 --> 00:15:19.858\nIt can cause application hangs just for\n\n314\n00:15:19.858 --> 00:15:22.505\na moment until it finds what\nmemory location it needs.\n\n315\n00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:27.210\nYou name it, it can actually look\nexactly like a software error does look.\n\n316\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.020\nBut the problem that we have is simple,\nright?\n\n317\n00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.460\nIt can be very tricky to troubleshoot.\n\n318\n00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.250\nOr you can actually use some utilities\nthat are built into Windows that will\n\n319\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.610\nreally help you out as well.\n\n320\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.506\n>> Yeah, one of my issues with memory and\n\n321\n00:15:38.506 --> 00:15:42.137\ntroubleshooting is a lot of times\nit's an intermittent issue, right?\n\n322\n00:15:42.137 --> 00:15:46.709\nDepending on what part of that memory\nstick has failed, it's maybe only when it\n\n323\n00:15:46.709 --> 00:15:50.892\ntries to use that area of memory when\nthat application crashes or hangs.\n\n324\n00:15:50.892 --> 00:15:55.096\nSo, it doesn't happen all the time, and\nthose can be really tricky to reproduce.\n\n325\n00:15:55.096 --> 00:15:57.383\nWhich means they're gonna\nbe tricky to troubleshoot.\n\n326\n00:15:57.383 --> 00:16:01.323\nBut thankfully Ronnie has a couple\ntechniques we can use to make our life\n\n327\n00:16:01.323 --> 00:16:02.514\na little bit easier.\n\n328\n00:16:02.514 --> 00:16:06.850\n>> If your machine is still operable,\nlike mine, you can still get into it.\n\n329\n00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.870\nBut you are experiencing those\nintermittent issues like\n\n330\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.070\nMike talked about.\n\n331\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:15.310\nThey do have built into Windows 7 here\nwhat they call the memory diagnostic tool.\n\n332\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.290\nAnd let's see if I can find that thing.\n\n333\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.528\nSo, I'm gonna go head and\nclick on Start and type in memory.\n\n334\n00:16:19.528 --> 00:16:23.093\nAnd then when you actually take a look\nat the top of the list, there it is,\n\n335\n00:16:23.093 --> 00:16:24.567\nthe Memory Diagnostic tool.\n\n336\n00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:27.236\nAnd it says, check your computer for\nmemory problems.\n\n337\n00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:31.260\nMemory problems can cause your computer\nto lose information or stop working.\n\n338\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.330\nAnd that's what we're really\nworried about, right?\n\n339\n00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.570\nIf it's a software issue,\nwe can correct that relatively easily, but\n\n340\n00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.924\nif it's a hardware issue, and we're not\nexactly sure and with today's machines,\n\n341\n00:16:40.924 --> 00:16:44.930\nwhere we have 4 gigs, 8 gigs of memory,\nthat can actually be,\n\n342\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.600\nlet's say, anywhere between two sticks\nof memory to four sticks of memory.\n\n343\n00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.650\nHopefully you don't have\neight 1 gig sticks, but\n\n344\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.130\nit possibly could be eight 1 gig sticks.\n\n345\n00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.030\nWell, which of those particular\nsticks of memory are you then\n\n346\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.470\ngoing to actually try and\nfigure out and realize?\n\n347\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.650\nSo you do have issues that\nyou have to deal with,\n\n348\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.720\nas far as trying to isolate\nwhich one it's gonna be.\n\n349\n00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.106\n>> Absolutely, and\nrunning this little wizard,\n\n350\n00:17:06.106 --> 00:17:10.217\nthat is gonna have to reboot your system,\nbecause it needs to free up all that RAM,\n\n351\n00:17:10.217 --> 00:17:13.817\nand it's gonna start writing and\nthen reading from each bit of memory.\n\n352\n00:17:13.817 --> 00:17:17.182\nSo if you're like Ronnie and\nyou've got 16 gigs of RAM in your laptop,\n\n353\n00:17:17.182 --> 00:17:20.160\nthis is not something you wanna\ndo at 9 o'clock in the morning,\n\n354\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.715\nbecause you're not gonna be very\nproductive throughout that day, right?\n\n355\n00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:28.770\nIt gives you the option to restart and run\nnow, and that is the recommended method.\n\n356\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.600\nIt also gives you an option\nto schedule it for later,\n\n357\n00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.390\nthe next time I reboot my machine.\n\n358\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.280\nThat might sound like a good option,\nbut I would say don't ever do that one,\n\n359\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.460\nbecause what happens is you forget\nthat you said, hey, don't do it now.\n\n360\n00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.686\nJust let's run it later.\n\n361\n00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:44.987\nAnd then at the end of the day or\nwhatever, you reboot that machine, and\n\n362\n00:17:44.987 --> 00:17:47.364\nall of a sudden it starts\ngoing through this check.\n\n363\n00:17:47.364 --> 00:17:51.470\nAnd then now you're like,\nI can't close my laptop, now, and go home.\n\n364\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.010\nWe gotta wait for\nthis darn test to finish.\n\n365\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.540\nI mean, it literally can take an hour or\nmore to run through it if you've got 8,\n\n366\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.350\n16 gigs of RAM.\n\n367\n00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.930\n>> Yeah, an hour would be\na light end at this point.\n\n368\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.490\nIt used to take an hour when\nyou had 4 gigs of memory.\n\n369\n00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.830\nSo you are looking in\nthe higher end of things.\n\n370\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.720\nSo when you use something like this,\n\n371\n00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.440\nyou can leave all those\nsticks of RAM in there.\n\n372\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.129\nBut then when they actually report you\nwhich one it is, the problem is Windows\n\n373\n00:18:15.129 --> 00:18:18.270\ndoesn't actually say stick number three or\nstick number seven.\n\n374\n00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.270\nIt doesn't tell you that.\n\n375\n00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.791\n>> That would be nice.\n\n376\n00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:20.348\nWouldn't it?\n\n377\n00:18:20.348 --> 00:18:22.650\n>> It gives you a nice memory location.\n\n378\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.950\nYou're like, oh great,\nhow do I find that out?\n\n379\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:29.040\nAnd somebody says, you don't, and\nwhat you actually realize is that even\n\n380\n00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.990\nthough they give you this it's more for,\nI think it's more of a soothing effect.\n\n381\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.900\nIt's like Ronnie you have the power to\ntroubleshoot memory, but if I can discover\n\n382\n00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.870\nthat on four or eight sticks of memory I\napparently am Superman if I can do that.\n\n383\n00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:47.260\nThe recommendation though is to try and\nactually pull out every stick but two.\n\n384\n00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.390\nAnd then run it two at\na time if you do that.\n\n385\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.790\nNow, for me right, if I've had eight I'd\nprobably run it one stick at a time.\n\n386\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.740\nI know that sounds weird,\nbut I probably would.\n\n387\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.780\nI would probably just reboot the machine,\nif I can get it to launch with 1 gig.\n\n388\n00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.270\nI'd actually reboot and\njust tell it to run through that.\n\n389\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.650\nAnd that way, whichever one that she has\nthere I know that that's gonna be it.\n\n390\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.590\nBut trying to troubleshoot with\n8 gigs is pretty difficult.\n\n391\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.284\nSo this tool, as great as it was\nduring the days of when the seven one,\n\n392\n00:19:11.284 --> 00:19:14.235\n4 gigs is probably gonna max\nyou out on most machines.\n\n393\n00:19:14.235 --> 00:19:18.399\nToday with 8 and like I said with\nmy laptop with 16 gigs of memory,\n\n394\n00:19:18.399 --> 00:19:19.215\nI could cry.\n\n395\n00:19:19.215 --> 00:19:22.149\nI could literally ball up\ninto a small child and\n\n396\n00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:24.568\ncry before it could actually finish.\n\n397\n00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:28.193\nWhat I'm telling you is that doesn't\nhappen and I wont do that, so\n\n398\n00:19:28.193 --> 00:19:31.620\nin other words it's gonna take\na long time to finish here.\n\n399\n00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.050\nBut yes, you do have those tools\nthat are available to you.\n\n400\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.700\nThere are third party tools as\nwell that can help you out.\n\n401\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.860\nBut this one actually is effective and\nit actually reports out something in\n\n402\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.940\nthe very end that will make it easy for\nyou to see inside the operating system,.\n\n403\n00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:50.540\nBut you not only have an advantage here,\nif your machine just will not start again.\n\n404\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.670\nThe nice thing that you have access of\ncourse to those start-up repair tools.\n\n405\n00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.690\nSo if you do know that your\nmachine is constantly rebooting,\n\n406\n00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.092\nand this is where I have to kinda change\nup something in my virtual machine here.\n\n407\n00:20:01.092 --> 00:20:06.180\nI'm gonna tell it to\nreboot into the CD here.\n\n408\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:11.860\nAnd then I'm gonna restart this\nmachine for us, or maybe, all right.\n\n409\n00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:16.750\nAnd, what I'm going to do, is now, I've\nput in the Windows 7 installation disc.\n\n410\n00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.200\nSo this is one of the discs that we\nhave access to, that we can really use,\n\n411\n00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.572\nunless I actually didn't put it in.\n\n412\n00:20:23.572 --> 00:20:25.440\nAnd I'm toast if I did not do that.\n\n413\n00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.680\nOh, there it goes.\n\n414\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.709\nI always forget whether or\n\n415\n00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:30.820\nnot I've actually done it correctly\n>> So if I can get in to\n\n416\n00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.440\nat least the installation, right, the good\nthing is I'm not really relying too much\n\n417\n00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.150\non the hard drive having to spin up,\nhaving to do a lot.\n\n418\n00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.270\nI'm just trying to see if this little\n\n419\n00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:45.600\nWindows 7 had the most basic\ninstall will run in RAM.\n\n420\n00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.160\nAnd that's where it's a little\nbit more tricky at this point.\n\n421\n00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.748\nBut it can be done.\n\n422\n00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:54.590\nIf you can launch this, you can still\nrun that Memory Diagnostic tool as well.\n\n423\n00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:58.280\nSo as long as your machine doesn't crash\nduring this, if it does then, yeah,\n\n424\n00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.070\nyou've a little bit harder an issue.\n\n425\n00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.710\nI can click Next and\nthen select repair your computer and\n\n426\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.580\nin a moment it's gonna do\na little bit of searching but\n\n427\n00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.030\nthen it's gonna present me with\na list of advanced tools here.\n\n428\n00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.120\nLet's see.\n\n429\n00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.400\nI'm gonna actually select Next instead.\n\n430\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.190\nAnd it's right here, notice I can run\nthat Windows Memory Diagnostic again.\n\n431\n00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.870\nSo now I'm not having to worry about six\n\n432\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.580\nother programs running in the background\nand slowing down the process.\n\n433\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.370\nIt's right here,\nit's running inside of our RAM drive.\n\n434\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.710\nAnd if I know that I have those four\nsticks around, I can just tell it to run.\n\n435\n00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.800\nSo, I'm not having to worry about\ndrivers and everything else loading up,\n\n436\n00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.740\nand doing this.\n\n437\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.200\nSo, this is another effective tool for\nus to try and be able to do that.\n\n438\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.460\nAnd, it didn't cost me another penny.\n\n439\n00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.650\nI didn't have to actually learn how to\nuse it, figure out what command I needed.\n\n440\n00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.780\nI just needed to reboot into\nthe installation media, and\n\n441\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.170\nI was up and running.\n\n442\n00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.410\n>> Very good, yeah, so memory can be\ntricky, especially when it's intermittent.\n\n443\n00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.600\nBest thing to do is run that tool when\nyou've got some time to let that machine\n\n444\n00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.990\nsit and go through it, or as Ronnie said,\nwe can use that process of elimination.\n\n445\n00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.748\nWe can pop out a stick of RAM,\nsee if we still get those same errors.\n\n446\n00:22:01.748 --> 00:22:03.730\nWe can kinda rotate through sticks and\n\n447\n00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.990\ntry to find the one that\nis causing the problem.\n\n448\n00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.610\nAll right, next, the last thing\nwe wanna talk about here, Ronnie,\n\n449\n00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.630\nI think is our disc management, right?\n\n450\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.300\nWe need to be able to work with our\nhard drives, create volumes, partitions,\n\n451\n00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.060\nmultiple drives, all that good stuff,\nand Windows makes this pretty easy too.\n\n452\n00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.710\n>> It really does.\n\n453\n00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.780\nThere's a system on it that we call,\nwell disc management.\n\n454\n00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.730\nAnd inside of disc management we have\na nice graphical user interface.\n\n455\n00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.745\nAnd that is the key by far.\n\n456\n00:22:28.745 --> 00:22:29.680\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n457\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.566\nIf you love command line\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n458\n00:22:31.566 --> 00:22:35.107\nWe work with it all the time and\nit's not that we're afraid of it.\n\n459\n00:22:35.107 --> 00:22:39.211\nBut there's just sometimes at the end\nof the day you're not wanting to,\n\n460\n00:22:39.211 --> 00:22:41.712\nis this this option,\nis it not this option?\n\n461\n00:22:41.712 --> 00:22:43.107\nDid I get it right?\n\n462\n00:22:43.107 --> 00:22:44.151\nDid I not get it right?\n\n463\n00:22:44.151 --> 00:22:47.319\nI gotta look at the help file,\nI gotta look at slash,\n\n464\n00:22:47.319 --> 00:22:49.052\nyou can do that all day long.\n\n465\n00:22:49.052 --> 00:22:53.174\nBut in as much as, and\nI do, I enjoy it at times.\n\n466\n00:22:53.174 --> 00:22:55.774\nLet me see if I can actually\nuse a Ctrl+Alt+Delete here.\n\n467\n00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:56.471\nHow's that?\n\n468\n00:22:56.471 --> 00:22:57.133\nThat would actually help.\n\n469\n00:22:57.133 --> 00:23:01.753\n[LAUGH] It's just trying to do it,\nis the help here.\n\n470\n00:23:01.753 --> 00:23:04.632\nSo, once I log in, I will have access.\n\n471\n00:23:04.632 --> 00:23:07.906\nLet's see, that should fullscreen\nhere in just a moment.\n\n472\n00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:09.775\nI think it should.\n\n473\n00:23:09.775 --> 00:23:11.980\nWhat have I done here?\n\n474\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.360\nOh, I've shrunk it.\n\n475\n00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.000\nThere we go.\nLet's get it, here we go.\n\n476\n00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.170\nThat'll help us out.\n\n477\n00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.680\nSo, what I wanna do is get\ninto the disc manager.\n\n478\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.310\nSo I'm going to click on the Start button.\n\n479\n00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:25.335\nAnd I'm gonna right-click on Computer,\nwell so much for right-clicking.\n\n480\n00:23:25.335 --> 00:23:28.850\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna right-click on\nComputer here and select Manage.\n\n481\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.060\nI still like going here, it's always\nmy go-to spot cuz it has all the tools\n\n482\n00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.070\nthat I'm normally looking for whenever I'm\nstarting to troubleshoot things here too.\n\n483\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:41.104\nSo then I can select Disc Management and\nin Disc Management, it really is helpful.\n\n484\n00:23:41.104 --> 00:23:45.094\nI'm gonna just leave this initialize disc\nout here for a moment just to talk about\n\n485\n00:23:45.094 --> 00:23:47.980\nwhat we see here on the graphical\nuser interface, right?\n\n486\n00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.982\nSo, it will tell me the disc\nthat I have available and\n\n487\n00:23:50.982 --> 00:23:52.902\nit will normally even indicate.\n\n488\n00:23:52.902 --> 00:23:57.082\nThat hey,\nthere is something wrong with this disc.\n\n489\n00:23:57.082 --> 00:24:01.034\nAnd the reason that there's something\nwrong with this disc right now is,\n\n490\n00:24:01.034 --> 00:24:05.860\nlet's say that what I had was another\ndisc that died in this hard drive.\n\n491\n00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.380\nOr, not in this hard drive, this PC.\n\n492\n00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.610\nAnd I replace this disc.\n\n493\n00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.160\nWell, one of the things that has\nto be done if we're actually going\n\n494\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.250\nto replace a drive, is that we have\nto do what we call initialization.\n\n495\n00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.940\nWindow automatically says, look, I want to\ntake the time to actually recognize this\n\n496\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.510\ndisk and gives me the ability to actually\nselect this initialization at this point.\n\n497\n00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.590\nAnd that's just allowing\nthe operating system, and\n\n498\n00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:33.420\nthe hard drive to really recognize each\nother is what we're really saying.\n\n499\n00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.880\nAnd the way that it does it is by\nputting in that master boot record so\n\n500\n00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.120\nthat we can now access that drive as well.\n\n501\n00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.970\nAnd then when I click OK, you'll see\nit actually brings it online with\n\n502\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.780\nthe main hard drive that\nI have available up here.\n\n503\n00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.050\nI just really did a default\ninstallation of WIndows 7\n\n504\n00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.670\nI've got a couple of programs\nrunning on there right now.\n\n505\n00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:57.180\nBut if I had a new disk\nthat was available,\n\n506\n00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.830\nI do need to understand that there's, you\nknow, some things that have to be done.\n\n507\n00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.180\nFirst, you notice that it says\nunallocated, which means that if I take\n\n508\n00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.770\na look up here, it's not something\nthat my computer can actually read.\n\n509\n00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.400\nIf I go into Explorer.\n\n510\n00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.780\nI can see my local disk.\n\n511\n00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.480\nI can see the shared folder\nthat I have available.\n\n512\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.580\nI can even see my DVD drive with\nmy installation media in it.\n\n513\n00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.090\nBut that second drive is not showing up.\n\n514\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.420\nIf it's not showing up,\nit means it's not readable or\n\n515\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.790\nwritable I can't get access to it.\n\n516\n00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:32.200\nAnd that's what unallocated really means\nfor us, is that it's not really ready yet.\n\n517\n00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.790\nThe hardware is recognized.\n\n518\n00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:38.310\nWe are there but now Windows needs\nto be able to recognize this disk.\n\n519\n00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:43.990\nSo the good thing is I can right-click\non it and then select New Simple Volume.\n\n520\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:49.760\nBy doing that I can click Next and then I\ncan walk through the actual process here.\n\n521\n00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:58.050\nSo I'm gonna actually take this and\nI'm gonna do, let's see 5,120 here.\n\n522\n00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.350\nSo split the difference in\nhalf a little bit here.\n\n523\n00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:05.270\nAnd then by default it assigns\nthe next available drive letter.\n\n524\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.440\nWe can choose any of them that\nare actually available that we want to.\n\n525\n00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.810\nBut this one is just gonna assign\nthe next available drive letter.\n\n526\n00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.120\nThen click Next, and\n\n527\n00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.268\nif I want to get it ready to be\nused with the operating system.\n\n528\n00:26:17.268 --> 00:26:20.020\nIt's right here I need\nto format this drive,\n\n529\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.980\nyou do have of course what's\navailable to you which is FAT32 or\n\n530\n00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.090\nNTFS so it just depends on\nwhat you want to set it up as.\n\n531\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.490\nToday the recommendation is fairly simple,\n\n532\n00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.330\ndo it as NTFS unless you\nhave a good reason not to.\n\n533\n00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.660\nAnd that's usually the default.\n\n534\n00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:41.340\nAnd then, we're just gonna call this one\na simple drive here, giving it a label.\n\n535\n00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.130\nAnd we're gonna do a quick format.\n\n536\n00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.740\nSelect that and click Finish.\n\n537\n00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.680\nAnd now we're gonna see it's gonna format\nand there's gonna be this simple and\n\n538\n00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.170\nit's gonna be the E drive.\n\n539\n00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.750\nI see it showing up in\nmy management system.\n\n540\n00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.510\nAnd it's right here I\ncan see the autoplay.\n\n541\n00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.200\nSo Windows is not only recognizing it,\nit's now ready to use it.\n\n542\n00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.078\nI simply select that and there is is.\n\n543\n00:27:02.078 --> 00:27:07.020\nI can right-click and\nthen I can create a new file on it.\n\n544\n00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.160\nAnd you always want to verify\nthat it is actually writable so\n\n545\n00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.250\nmake sure that it is working.\n\n546\n00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.650\nAnd then, it's doing what we need to.\n\n547\n00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:19.190\nSo, it's fairly easy for\nyou to be able to use something like this,\n\n548\n00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:23.880\nto format a drive, and to get it ready to\ngo and do everything that you need to.\n\n549\n00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.810\nThere's also another utility that you can\nuse if you really love the command prompt,\n\n550\n00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.390\nand that's Diskpart.\n\n551\n00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.370\nIt's doing the same thing, but\nthat's exactly what it's doing.\n\n552\n00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.080\nBut Diskpart just requires a little bit of\ntime and effort for you to learn about.\n\n553\n00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.720\nAnd you can create the same\nthing from the command line.\n\n554\n00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.000\nYou might be wondering,\nwhy would I do that?\n\n555\n00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.860\nWhat if your machine is at that point\nwhere you can't get access to it.\n\n556\n00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.490\nYou need to put a new hard drive in.\n\n557\n00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:46.620\nBeing able to run Diskpart,\n\n558\n00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.150\nbeing able to put a file system on it,\nformat it and ready to go.\n\n559\n00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:50.890\nIt'll work for you as well.\n\n560\n00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:51.560\n>> Absolutely.\n\n561\n00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:56.100\nIf we're talking about a core version\nof server where there is no desktop, or\n\n562\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.050\nif I want to script it, that's the other\nthing, is if we're going through\n\n563\n00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.430\na whole bunch of machines and\nwe're putting in new hard drives.\n\n564\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.820\nEverybody's getting a second hard drive on\ntheir Windows 7 desktop that they sit out.\n\n565\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.840\nI might want to create a script and\nthrow it on a thumb drive, and take it and\n\n566\n00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.540\nrun that, because disk part as\ncommand line, I can script it out.\n\n567\n00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.570\nYou can't script a GUI.\n\n568\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.020\nSo definitely still has a place,\nI know in my heart.\n\n569\n00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.080\nI do love some Diskpart.\n\n570\n00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.630\nYou do have to be a little careful in\nthere because when you work with Diskpart,\n\n571\n00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.422\nit's real easy to select\nthe wrong drive and format\n\n572\n00:28:25.422 --> 00:28:26.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n573\n00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.080\n>> the wrong drive.\n\n574\n00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.220\nSo you do have to pay attention\nto what you're doing.\n\n575\n00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.520\nAnd the GUI is a little bit easier\nbecause you're right-clicking on it.\n\n576\n00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.200\nyou get that nice\ngraphical representation.\n\n577\n00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.190\nMakes it a little bit more difficult\nto click on the wrong one.\n\n578\n00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.880\n>> Right.\n\n579\n00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.830\n>> All right Ronnie,\na lot of great information there.\n\n580\n00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.510\nTroubleshooting hardware definitely\nsomething we're going to have to deal\n\n581\n00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.300\nwith, with our Windows 7 clients.\n\n582\n00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.650\nYou've made it a little bit easier for\n\n583\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.460\nus now to understand how we can go\nabout troubleshooting those drivers,\n\n584\n00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:56.470\ntroubleshooting the disk system,\nas well as pesky memory.\n\n585\n00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.700\nGotta try to find those dern intermittent\nissues and take care of those as well.\n\n586\n00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.690\nSo another great episode Ronnie.\n\n587\n00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:02.650\nWe appreciate that.\n\n588\n00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.930\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n589\n00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.350\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n590\n00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.280\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n591\n00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.075\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n592\n00:29:11.075 --> 00:29:14.231\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:15.420\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.100\nWith me today is the infamous,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.880\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.920\n>> I'm doing fine today.\n\n7\n00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.500\nIt's another great day to be\nright here as we continue to take\n\n8\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.400\na look at supporting Windows 7.\n\n9\n00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.340\nMaking sure that we, as enterprise\nlevel technicians understand some of\n\n10\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.420\nthe features that are also available\nto us, even if some of the conventional\n\n11\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.650\nways of getting access into our\ncomputers and making available\n\n12\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.600\nare not going to be readily accessible\nsometimes, and that does happen.\n\n13\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.350\nThere are times, and I'm not going\nto mention anybody else but Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.927\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Might as well throw him under\n\n15\n00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:43.595\nthe bus right now.\n\n16\n00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:45.505\nWhich all of a sudden,\nyou're on the keyboard, and\n\n17\n00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:48.410\nit doesnt work anymore\nthe way that it should work.\n\n18\n00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.370\nThe keys aren't exactly lined up, you have\nto kind of move the L back into the right\n\n19\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.795\nposition, because somebody's actually\npounded that keyboard to the nth degree.\n\n20\n00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:57.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There are times when that happens,\n\n21\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.910\nhopefully not too often.\n\n22\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.521\n>> I have earned my title,\nkeyboard destroyer.\n\n23\n00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:03.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes, you have.\n\n24\n00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.660\nSo, there are times when we do have that.\n\n25\n00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.050\nBut, now what we're talking about today,\n\n26\n00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.500\nof course, is the idea of what we\ncall accessibility issues, right?\n\n27\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.290\nEven though we might be\nperfectly fine with working with\n\n28\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.130\nthe conventional ways of access.\n\n29\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.870\nThere are times when we have to support\nthose people that really are like me,\n\n30\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.260\nkind of not able to see as well as we can.\n\n31\n00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.970\nOr even able to type the way that we\nbelieve that it should be able to have\n\n32\n00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.630\ntactful touch and do this.\n\n33\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.940\nBut, it gives us that option to\nbe able to actually say, no,\n\n34\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.450\nyou can still use the Windows 7 computer.\n\n35\n00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.100\nWe just have to set it up.\n\n36\n00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.880\nAnd then, you just have to learn\na little bit about that system that may\n\n37\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.980\nactually help them out.\n\n38\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.945\nAnd so, there's a lot of\nfeatures that are available.\n\n39\n00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:44.925\nThat really does help out people that\nreally don't have all the same benefits or\n\n40\n00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:48.545\nusage of our limbs in a way\nthat we have them right now.\n\n41\n00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:52.455\n>> Yeah, these accessibility options open\nup the use of a computer to several people\n\n42\n00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:56.785\nthat might otherwise not be able to so\nvery important that we understand these so\n\n43\n00:01:56.785 --> 00:02:01.915\nwe can make it easier or\nallow them to use that computer as well as\n\n44\n00:02:01.915 --> 00:02:06.780\nunderstand that when they accidentally get\nturned on And they hinder somebody from\n\n45\n00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.840\nproductivity cuz that can happen as well\ncuz there are some really cool shortcuts\n\n46\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.850\nthat we can use to enable and disable some\nof these features and sometimes those get\n\n47\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.020\nturned on by accident and then somebody\ncalls you up and they start complaining.\n\n48\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.400\nThey're saying it's tough to type or\nwhatever the case may be or\n\n49\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.680\neverything is monster large so\nboth sides of it.\n\n50\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.960\nWe've gotta be able to support\nthe people that need it, and\n\n51\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.370\nwe've gotta understand well enough to be\nable to troubleshoot them when they've\n\n52\n00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.190\nbeen turned on mistakenly.\n\n53\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.240\n>> Now,\nI know the one that Mike is talking about,\n\n54\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.550\nthe one that always gets me.\n\n55\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.680\nAs I press something like five times\nin a row, I don't know what it is, but\n\n56\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.500\nall of a sudden now my keys don't\nwork the way that they should.\n\n57\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.670\nAnd that's something that it's\nalways easy to go back in after.\n\n58\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.650\nHindsight, right?\n\n59\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.460\nAnd go, yeah.\n\n60\n00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.320\nThat's an accessibility feature\nthat got turned on by some shortcut\n\n61\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.380\nkey that I used.\n\n62\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.060\n>> Shift key.\n\n63\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.320\n>> The shift key, yeah.\n\n64\n00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.510\nAnd that's because I can't type.\n\n65\n00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.850\nI just start hitting it, and\nI think I'm not hitting the shift key.\n\n66\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.150\nI'm hitting something else.\n\n67\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.100\nAnd so,-\n>> I've seen it happen too when a keyboard\n\n68\n00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.920\nis having a problem.\n\n69\n00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.590\nAnd you're holding down the Shift.\n\n70\n00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.450\nI've seen people hold down Shift for\na really long time.\n\n71\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.040\nWhile they're hunting for\na particular letter.\n\n72\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.190\nAnd it'll kick in.\n\n73\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.760\nOr it could be that it's holding it down\nand it's maybe not getting a good signal\n\n74\n00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.540\nback to the processor and it's\ninterpreting it as multiple keystrokes.\n\n75\n00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.580\nAnd then it will turn on\nthat accessibility option.\n\n76\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.800\n>> So, these are some of the things that\nwe do worry about a lot of times cuz\n\n77\n00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.110\nthat's when the user gets frustrated.\n\n78\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.770\nAnd that's all of a sudden when\nthe keyboard actually is in two or\n\n79\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.515\nthree pieces.\n\n80\n00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:33.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Instead of the one piece that\n\n81\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.120\nshould be in a lot of times.\n\n82\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.880\nNow, let's go ahead and\n\n83\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.080\nstart taking a look at what we\ncall these accessibility features.\n\n84\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.470\nAnd we're starting off right\nhere at the very beginning.\n\n85\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.240\nSo, on my machine,\nthis is where we're starting off.\n\n86\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.395\nNow, when you take a look at it,\n\n87\n00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:50.020\npress CTRL+ALT+DELETE to log in,\nwhy should I really care?\n\n88\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.385\n>> Well,\nif you only have the use of one hand\n\n89\n00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:54.165\n>> Or you have limited mobility in your\n\n90\n00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:57.425\nhands, doing some of these\nkeyboard shortcuts can be tricky,\n\n91\n00:03:57.425 --> 00:04:02.005\nespecially when we're talking about\nthree key keyboard shortcuts.\n\n92\n00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:05.015\nTrying to do that with one hand,\nit's quite a stretch, So\n\n93\n00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:08.565\nthey give us the ability and they give\nus access to these accessibility options\n\n94\n00:04:08.565 --> 00:04:10.035\nright here on the log on screen,\n>> Yeah,\n\n95\n00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:14.670\nit's neat because you don't actually\nhave to log in to the computer,\n\n96\n00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.010\nto use these accessibility features so\nyou at least have the ability to move\n\n97\n00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.070\nthe mouse in the lower left hand\ncorner of this Windows 7 screen.\n\n98\n00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.030\nYou do see what it actually\nhas this button and\n\n99\n00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.430\nthis is what we call the Ease of access.\n\n100\n00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.360\nSo, if I select that and\nI went and turned up\n\n101\n00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.510\nthe actual audio in the background so\nthat we can hear a little bit.\n\n102\n00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.570\n>> Select the highlighted option.\n\n103\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.690\n>> Now, you're actually hearing it read\nthe whole screen is what's happening here.\n\n104\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.670\nAnd so you can actually see them,\nthat all these accessibility features,\n\n105\n00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.590\nnow all of a sudden I'm\nstarting to get antsy about it.\n\n106\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.520\nSo, let me turn that off right now because\nshe's starting to actually get on my\n\n107\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.110\nnerves just for a moment.\n\n108\n00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.150\nBut what we'll actually do is we'll\nturn it back on here in a moment but\n\n109\n00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.090\nlet me kind of describe what's happening,\nright?\n\n110\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.390\nYou see where everybody\nwhether it's somebody that\n\n111\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.420\nreally doesn't have the ability to read.\n\n112\n00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.280\nI hate to say that but it is very\npossible, that they're not exactly sure\n\n113\n00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.900\nwhat goes on but they can hear those\ncommands being read out to them so\n\n114\n00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.680\nwhat I'm going to do this time, hopefully\nwe'll get a little bit smarter here.\n\n115\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.710\nIs I'm gonna turn down\nthe volume a little bit so\n\n116\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.350\nit doesn't interrupt me as much, here, and\nthen I'm gonna actually press that again.\n\n117\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.400\nMike's over here laughing\nat me like crazy.\n\n118\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.200\nSo, there it is.\n\n119\n00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.640\nMake your computer easier to use,\n\n120\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.590\nto read, press the Space Bar to\nselect the highlighted option.\n\n121\n00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.400\nSo, notice that all of these are actually\nunchecked but the one that's turned\n\n122\n00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.560\non by default is this narrator option\nthat allows you to there it is.\n\n123\n00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.120\nWhatever screen whatever text is on\nthe screen that can be read aloud\n\n124\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.390\nmake items larger on\nthe screen from this point on.\n\n125\n00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.830\nSee more in contrast.\n\n126\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.950\nType without the keyboard and\nthen press the keyboard shortcut keys one\n\n127\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.430\nat a time If I press keys repeatedly,\nignore extra spaces too.\n\n128\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.560\nSo, you can choose which of these\naccessibility options that you\n\n129\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.560\nreally need.\n\n130\n00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.430\nAnd at that point\ncontinue to move forward.\n\n131\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.870\nAnd then actually see\na little bit more inside.\n\n132\n00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.980\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n133\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.260\nIf you hard at hearing,\nthat narrator is fantastic.\n\n134\n00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.300\nIt just starts reading, and\nthat's what it was doing on Ryan's and\n\n135\n00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.915\njust reading whatever shows up on screen.\n\n136\n00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That have magnifiers I've used\n\n137\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.820\nthe magnifier myself sometimes\ntrying to zoom in on a screen,\n\n138\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.890\nsee some detail or\nsomething, I've used that.\n\n139\n00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.360\nThat high contrast option that\nswitches to basically black and\n\n140\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.820\nwhite and a couple other colors in\nthere to really make things stand out.\n\n141\n00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.020\nAgain, if you have trouble visually seeing\nthat computer Sticky keys is fantastic for\n\n142\n00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.300\nif you've just got one hand and\n\n143\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.700\nyou're trying to use some of\nthose keyboard shortcuts.\n\n144\n00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.530\nWhat you can do is, hit the Ctrl, then\nhit the Alt, and then hit the Delete and\n\n145\n00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.130\nit sees that as one keyboard shortcut,\nso that's fantastic.\n\n146\n00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.580\nAnd then the filter keys is the one\nRonnie talks about that gets turned on\n\n147\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.930\naccidentally sometimes Cuz if you hit your\nshift key five times, I believe that's\n\n148\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.940\nthe keyboard shortcut to turn that on-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n149\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.730\n>> And for somebody that has palsy or\n\n150\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.340\nsome type of disorder where they-\n>> Shake.\n\n151\n00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.850\n>> They have the shakes, you know they\nend up hitting a key too many times\n\n152\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.800\nas they're trying to type a single letter,\nthat will eliminate repeated key strokes.\n\n153\n00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.170\nIt'll detect that hey, you've hit this\nkey you hit the letter H five times,\n\n154\n00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.430\nit's only gonna put one H out there for\nyou.\n\n155\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.470\nSo, it makes it easy, again, for\n\n156\n00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.500\npeople with these disabilities\nto be able to use that computer.\n\n157\n00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.050\n>> So they've really tried to think of the\nwhole gamut of possibilities here, right?\n\n158\n00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.170\nThat somebody right wanted to try to log\nin might actually need to be able to use\n\n159\n00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.800\nand then of course where\nwe can control it.\n\n160\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.660\nSo, let's take for an example this\nis actually a great one right here\n\n161\n00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.680\nat this screen right, the Ctrl+Alt+Del\nthat's a little bit more difficult for\n\n162\n00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.840\nsomebody to be able to do cuz normally\nI actually use both hands, right.\n\n163\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.650\n>> Control and alt on my left\nhand which would make sure and\n\n164\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.220\nthe delete key on my right\nhand to be able to do this.\n\n165\n00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.520\nWell, if I select this one,\npress keyboard shortcuts one at a time.\n\n166\n00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.830\nI click OK.\n\n167\n00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.530\nWell, at this point that should\nactually be well let's see.\n\n168\n00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.350\nI dunno if I can do it with this one or\nnot.\n\n169\n00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.650\nGo Alt+Delete.\n\n170\n00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.610\nThis keyboard's a little bit funky here.\n\n171\n00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.250\nYeah cuz I actually have to do the FN\nkey for the Alt key to make it work.\n\n172\n00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.630\nAnd so, that does not exactly\nworking out the way that I want to.\n\n173\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.410\nBut let me see.\n\n174\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.380\nI think actually it did work that time.\n\n175\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.120\nSo there we go.\n\n176\n00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.540\nSo then I can now log in and\nat this point, sometimes we\n\n177\n00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.900\nalso have an onscreen keyboard that we\ncan access, not at this level here.\n\n178\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.720\nDo I have that onscreen, there it is.\n\n179\n00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.270\nYeah.\n\n180\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.920\nSo it's right here that we would actually\nbe able to turn that on instead and\n\n181\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.310\nthen I can select the type\nwithout the keyboard.\n\n182\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.300\nWell maybe.\n\n183\n00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.500\nIt's thinking about it, at least.\n\n184\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.340\nAnd that should bring up an onscreen\nkeyboard where now we can actually press\n\n185\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.780\nit one at a time or\nuse our mouse to do so.\n\n186\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.000\nAnd there we have.\n\n187\n00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.990\nSo now we have that ability,\n\n188\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.090\nwe can now use our mouse to\nalso use that to get access.\n\n189\n00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.908\nAnd then, once everything is typed in\nthe way that we believe it should be,\n\n190\n00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.970\njust press Enter, and there it is.\n\n191\n00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.820\nI am now able to get access inside.\n\n192\n00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.530\nSo, once I'm inside here,\n\n193\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:05.120\nthere are a few more options that we\ndo have available to us for this.\n\n194\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.520\nAnd one of them is actually kind of a neat\none that we were playing with right before\n\n195\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.520\nthe the show started here which\nis what we call the speech\n\n196\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.910\nrecognition feature that we\nhave available to us as well.\n\n197\n00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.960\nSo you can set this up and\nlet's show you where to set it up at.\n\n198\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.450\nIt's already turned on in the background,\ncuz we were playing with it before.\n\n199\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.560\nIf I go ahead and click on start.\n\n200\n00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.710\nAnd then Control Panel.\n\n201\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.280\nAnd inside of Control Panel\nwe see in this category here,\n\n202\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.150\nwhere it says ease of accessibility,\nor ease of access.\n\n203\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.870\nI always call it accessibility.\n\n204\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.890\nAnd then ease of access center.\n\n205\n00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.880\nAnd, here's all of the same things that\nwe were seeing a little bit before.\n\n206\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.430\nRight there, when we actually saw the,\nyou know, at the log in screen.\n\n207\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.880\nThere's a narrator, the magnifier.\n\n208\n00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.830\nAnd that's actually a nice one too.\n\n209\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.490\nAnd that gives me the ability,\nof course, to magnify.\n\n210\n00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.790\nAnd you can see where everything actually\nbumped itself up to 200% right away.\n\n211\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.870\nYou can change that.\n\n212\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.720\nLet's see.\nI can change it up to 300% if I need to.\n\n213\n00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.863\n400, 500, 600, are you joking,\ngood gracious, there we go.\n\n214\n00:10:08.863 --> 00:10:12.300\nNow I don't wanna go to,\nI think I'm getting to that point there.\n\n215\n00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.400\nSo you can see where somebody that\nreally does need to be able to\n\n216\n00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.660\nget zoomed in to where they want.\n\n217\n00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.700\nIt really can help them out and allow them\nto be able to navigate around the screen,\n\n218\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.250\nto be able to access what they need to.\n\n219\n00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:30.340\nSo it is really a nice little utility for\n\n220\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.210\nsomeone that is having a problem being\nable to see exactly what they want to do\n\n221\n00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.110\nand then of course there's\ndifferent magnifier options.\n\n222\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.767\nNot only do we have that ability,\noops I keep turning it off here.\n\n223\n00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:43.202\nNot only do we have that ability to see\nthat there's some other settings available\n\n224\n00:10:43.202 --> 00:10:46.438\nto track the mouse pointer that's always\ngood because that keeps the mouse on\n\n225\n00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:47.008\nthe screen.\n\n226\n00:10:47.008 --> 00:10:50.350\nSo you're not like me where\nyou lose track of the mouse.\n\n227\n00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.010\nWherever it goes, it just makes sure\nthat it actually remains on the screen.\n\n228\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.130\nSo this can be incredibly\nhelpful to someone\n\n229\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.120\nif we are really having\ndifficulties being able to see it.\n\n230\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.200\nWith today's high end resolutions on\nthese types of monitors, you can see.\n\n231\n00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.450\nAnd I actually might start using that\nmyself now when we start having that.\n\n232\n00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.220\nI'm going to uncheck this read section\naloud because that is really getting\n\n233\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.100\nannoying to me in the background.\n\n234\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.920\nBut it is, it's actually taking a look at\nall the text on the computer right now,\n\n235\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.080\nand trying to read everything.\n\n236\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.100\nNow on the set up high contrast color or\nset up high contrast.\n\n237\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.580\nIf I select that, this is where it turns\nit into that very like white text, and\n\n238\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.360\nthen a very dark background,\nor like magenta or orange or\n\n239\n00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.870\nyellow or something like that.\n\n240\n00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.740\nAnd you can also choose\nthose features there.\n\n241\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.950\nI now select OK, maybe.\n\n242\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.440\nIt's just taking a moment here.\n\n243\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.930\nSo if I select that it should give\nme those high contrast options.\n\n244\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.820\nYou also have the ability to turn on\nthe high contrast options through your\n\n245\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.340\npersonalization features a lot of times\ntoo and I don't know what happened there.\n\n246\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.620\nIt decided it didn't wanna do it, I guess.\n\n247\n00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.080\nAll right.\n\n248\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.150\n>> Might not be supported while we're\nhooked up to sharing our screen.\n\n249\n00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.560\n>> That is true.\nI did not think about that.\n\n250\n00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.860\nThat is true.\n\n251\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.080\nSo, sometimes it doesn't actually work\nwhen we are sharing our screen out in\n\n252\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.350\nthe way that we're connected in.\n\n253\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.310\nAnd then you, of course,\nhave a lot of these settings here.\n\n254\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.800\nAnd this is pretty much the whole list.\n\n255\n00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.200\nThis is the one that always kind\nof made me chuckle right here,\n\n256\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.570\nis that they actually list out Optimize\nfor blindness, so it gives you the ability\n\n257\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.910\nto be able to have that narration go on,\nto do the things that we need to.\n\n258\n00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.190\nAnd so if you do want to work with that,\nyou turn the narration on.\n\n259\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.070\nYou can also do audio\ndescriptions as well.\n\n260\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.580\nUnnecessary animation so\nthat way you don't have to wait and\n\n261\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.640\nhave the lays in between things.\n\n262\n00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.560\nSo there's a lot of\ngreat benefits in there.\n\n263\n00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.870\nThe easier to use of course\nis that magnifier option and\n\n264\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.790\nthen of course the onscreen keyboard,\nthe user computer without it\n\n265\n00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:52.200\nas well as let's see, it's actually\nalso being able to use a microphone,\n\n266\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.660\nthe speech recognition which is\nwhat we're getting to as well.\n\n267\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.630\nSo, when you set up this, all you're gonna\ndo is you select Use Speech Recognition,\n\n268\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:04.240\nand then you set up you microphone, and\neverything begins to work just about.\n\n269\n00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.940\nSo, I just did this, I'm gonna say,\n35 seconds before the show maybe, and\n\n270\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.660\neven though it's off right now,\nlet me see.\n\n271\n00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.070\nLet me try turn this on the way\nthat it needs to be and\n\n272\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.470\nthen turn up the microphone just for\na moment just in case it needs that.\n\n273\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:25.062\nSo now I just press this microphone and\nwhat I can do is tell it start file.\n\n274\n00:13:25.062 --> 00:13:28.313\nAnd it didn't actually recognize what\nI said but it actually hears me.\n\n275\n00:13:28.313 --> 00:13:30.553\nSo click File.\n\n276\n00:13:30.553 --> 00:13:33.442\nAnd so when you actually do something\nlike that, it is hearing, and\n\n277\n00:13:33.442 --> 00:13:36.656\nit's trying to do that, and earlier it\nactually did start a file up for me.\n\n278\n00:13:36.656 --> 00:13:41.700\nStart notebook, or notepad.\n\n279\n00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.420\nAnd so, there you go.\n\n280\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.790\nYou actually start seeing that, it's like,\n\n281\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.040\nlook I'm not sure what you're trying to\ntell you, but if you actually knew those\n\n282\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.160\ncommands there's a tutorial\nhere that you can go through.\n\n283\n00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.370\nAnd once you actually take\nthe entire speech tutorial,\n\n284\n00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.340\nit doesn't like my screen resolution and\nthat's what it's telling me as well.\n\n285\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.130\nThat there's some things that\nare actually right here,\n\n286\n00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.880\nit just doesn't like\nthe way that it's set up.\n\n287\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.700\nI need to reduce the screen size and\nyou know, enhance the resolution,\n\n288\n00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.200\nmake everything smaller and\nwe don't want to do that right now.\n\n289\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.490\nBut you can see where this could be\nvery useful, once you learn those.\n\n290\n00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:17.111\nThose commands that Windows understands\nit actually is incredibly responsive.\n\n291\n00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:20.363\nIt actually worked fairly well right there\nbefore I just don't remember the command\n\n292\n00:14:20.363 --> 00:14:21.893\nit was something like get file I think.\n\n293\n00:14:21.893 --> 00:14:24.995\nAnd it went actually to my explorer and\nactually opened it up and\n\n294\n00:14:24.995 --> 00:14:28.871\nthen I could actually tell it to open\nfolder I believe and would start working.\n\n295\n00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:32.250\n>> Yeah, it'll see all those\nlinks that are on the page.\n\n296\n00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:36.410\nYou can click and then read what\nthe link says and it'll click that.\n\n297\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.860\nYou can open programs, launch Excel.\n\n298\n00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.460\nAnd even some of those programs.\n\n299\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.550\nYou can use voice commands\nwithin those programs.\n\n300\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.990\nAnd as Ronnie said, there's a tutorial you\ngo through and there's a tune option and\n\n301\n00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.070\nit basically has you read some\nparagraphs a few times to\n\n302\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.160\nget your computer used to your voice\npatterns, how you break words up,\n\n303\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.330\nand where you put your accents and\nthings like that.\n\n304\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.420\nAnd once you go through that a few times,\nit's actually pretty fun to use.\n\n305\n00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.180\n>> And it even goes deeper than that Mike.\n\n306\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.660\nA lot of times it even says I\ncan examine your documents and\n\n307\n00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.890\nfind keywords that you use, and\nbe able to learn those as well.\n\n308\n00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.180\nSo it can recognize that those are words\nthat you actually are using in\n\n309\n00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.120\nyour documents.\n\n310\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.480\nAnd you just tell it it can search\nthrough all those documents and\n\n311\n00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.590\ndo a whole bunch more.\n\n312\n00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.170\n>> Yeah, and I say it's fun to use,\nif you wanna try to play with that for\n\n313\n00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.310\nsomebody who can't interact with the\nkeyboard though this is fantastic because\n\n314\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:33.075\nnow they can use a computer like\neverybody else, and that's a great thing.\n\n315\n00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:35.825\nAnd then there's other options, Ronnie,\nI know you want to show us in there.\n\n316\n00:15:35.825 --> 00:15:38.445\n>> Right so, it's just like what\nwe were talking about before,\n\n317\n00:15:38.445 --> 00:15:41.365\nsome of these other options of course\nare making it easier, such as these sticky\n\n318\n00:15:41.365 --> 00:15:44.925\nkeys that allow us to do that same\noption that we were doing before.\n\n319\n00:15:44.925 --> 00:15:47.470\nWhich is being able to\ndo that CTRL+ALT+DEL.\n\n320\n00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.930\nInstead of us having to try and make that\nmanipulation happen one key at a time.\n\n321\n00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.020\nAnd then, of course those filter key.\n\n322\n00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.810\nIs it the toggle keys or filter keys?\n\n323\n00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:56.420\n>> Toggle keys.\n\n324\n00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:56.950\n>> Filter keys.\n\n325\n00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.706\nThese are the ones if you do have where\nyou accidentally repeatedly hit a key\n\n326\n00:16:01.706 --> 00:16:05.420\nbecause of some type of\nshaking that may be going on.\n\n327\n00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.990\nYou may wanna go ahead and\ndo those filter keys as well.\n\n328\n00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:14.140\nAnd then, toggling, hear a tone when you\npress cap lock, num lock, or scroll lock.\n\n329\n00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.630\nI'd say this is probably something that\nI could actually use cuz I do hit these\n\n330\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.740\nevery once in a while and I don't\nrealize that they're actually locked on.\n\n331\n00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.390\nNow, there it is,\n\n332\n00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:24.440\nI start typing out numbers and\nI'm like what when did I hit that?\n\n333\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.210\nIt actually would be nice to have\na tone when we have that as well.\n\n334\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.770\nSo, there are so\nmany options that we should not try and\n\n335\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.960\njust tell somebody that look\nwindows seven is limited.\n\n336\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.860\nIf they're actually limited\nbecause they did add in so\n\n337\n00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.620\nmany of these features that are available.\n\n338\n00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.560\nIt takes a little bit of time to learn,\nbut\n\n339\n00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.360\nonce you actually learn them this is\ncan be a very effective computer for\n\n340\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.140\nsomebody who does have accessibility Or\ndisabilities.\n\n341\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:50.690\n>> Absolutely.\n\n342\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.080\n>> To get access to the computer.\n\n343\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.850\n>> And\nif you look at that yellow bar there,\n\n344\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:58.000\nthere's actually a wizard you can launch,\nso if you're setting this up for\n\n345\n00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.820\nsomebody else, you can guide them\nthrough and pick the right options.\n\n346\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.780\nIf they're trying to set it up on their\nown, they can launch this wizard and\n\n347\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.880\nit basically walks you through.\n\n348\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.920\nIs this easier to see or\nis this easier to see?\n\n349\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:12.250\nOr it tries to figure out what\noptions would best suit their needs.\n\n350\n00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.850\nAnd I think another thing we should talk\nabout though is the other side of it,\n\n351\n00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.490\ntroubleshooting, you know, trying to\nfigure out, somebody calles me up and\n\n352\n00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:23.040\nsays hey look, everytime I hit caps lock,\nmy computer beeps at me.\n\n353\n00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.940\nWell now you know.\n\n354\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.760\nLet's go in and\nturn off those toggle keys.\n\n355\n00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.810\nIf they tell you that they have to hold\nthe letter down for an extended period of\n\n356\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:35.170\ntime to get that letter to show up when\nthey're typing in a word document most\n\n357\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:40.200\nlikely that filter keys has been\nturned on accidentally, right?\n\n358\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.790\nSo if we understand what these\naccessibility options do for the people\n\n359\n00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.710\nwho need it, we can also help troubleshoot\nit when they accidentally get turned on.\n\n360\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.160\nHey, I hit Alt and\nI didn't mean to and now when I hit P,\n\n361\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.680\nbut I'm not holding Alt anymore,\nI hit P My Print dialogue comes up.\n\n362\n00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.670\nWell, because you've got those\nsticky keys turned on and\n\n363\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.240\none key at a time ends up\nbeing a keyboard shortcut.\n\n364\n00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.740\nSo, understanding what these\nthings do help me set it up for\n\n365\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.860\nsomebody that needs them,\nas well as troubleshooting when\n\n366\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.939\nsomebody's telling me their computer's\ndoing it and they didn't wanna do that.\n\n367\n00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.570\n>> The magnifier is one that,\nfor one reason or\n\n368\n00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.430\nanother I can turn on by accident.\n\n369\n00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.140\nAnd even though it actually\nhelps me out a lot of times,\n\n370\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.660\nit's not something I want\nto actually leave on.\n\n371\n00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.660\nSo when you do see that\nfloating magnifying glass,\n\n372\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.215\nremember that it may be something,\nSomething got turned on there.\n\n373\n00:18:24.215 --> 00:18:27.445\nLet's go ahead and enter those ease of\naccess, I keep saying accessibility,\n\n374\n00:18:27.445 --> 00:18:30.265\nbut ease of access settings and\nmake sure you examine them.\n\n375\n00:18:30.265 --> 00:18:33.145\nThey are worth the time and effort because\nthere are, there's going to be more and\n\n376\n00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:36.850\nmore people in your workforce and you've\ngot to be able to help them some way.\n\n377\n00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.750\nAnd you can't just go look,\nyou're not gonna be productive here.\n\n378\n00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.760\nLet me show you how you can actually\nmake this easier on yourself, and\n\n379\n00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.590\nhere are some great options for us.\n\n380\n00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.020\n>> And they used to be called\nthe Accessibility Options.\n\n381\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.913\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Because back in XP they were\n\n382\n00:18:48.913 --> 00:18:50.109\nthe Accessibility Options.\n\n383\n00:18:50.109 --> 00:18:50.650\n>> That's right.\n\n384\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.663\n>> Vista, Windows 7, it turned\nover to the Ease of Access Center.\n\n385\n00:18:53.663 --> 00:18:57.170\n>> That shows you how old I am right now,\nI do forget this terminology.\n\n386\n00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.200\nIt's so easy after different\ngenerations of the operating system,\n\n387\n00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.940\nyou tend to use the old words even though\nyou think that it's the right one.\n\n388\n00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.930\n>> Absolutely.\n\n389\n00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.670\nAll right, Ronnie, well,\ngreat information there.\n\n390\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.940\nAgain, important for\nus to be able to set up these computers\n\n391\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.210\nwhen somebody needs this type\nof help to use the computer.\n\n392\n00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.020\nAlso important for\nus to be able to troubleshoot them when\n\n393\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.060\nthat user calls up and says, hey,\nmy computer's doing weird things.\n\n394\n00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.850\nAnd I don't know what happened.\n\n395\n00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.160\nNow we've got an idea.\n\n396\n00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.360\nWhat's it doing?\n\n397\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.300\nWell, it's making me hold\na letter down forever.\n\n398\n00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.920\nI know exactly what to turn off,\nso gotta understand those.\n\n399\n00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.650\nGet in there, play with them yourselves.\n\n400\n00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:36.750\nThat way, you can better help your\nusers either enable those features or\n\n401\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.470\ndisable those features.\n\n402\n00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.110\nAll right, Ronnie,\na lot of good information there.\n\n403\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.440\nAny parting words for our viewers?\n\n404\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.770\n>> Well just remember that our job's\nreally about helping that end user out,\n\n405\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.430\nmaking sure that they can actually\nget done the things that they need\n\n406\n00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.380\nto get done.\n\n407\n00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.240\nIt's not in our job to tell them that\nthey just need to get better at it.\n\n408\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.740\nThere's plenty of tools that\nare inside of Windows 7, use them,\n\n409\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.000\ntake advantage of them.\n\n410\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.810\nThere's no use of them just sitting\nthere if you know they can be of help to\n\n411\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:02.800\nsomebody else.\n\n412\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.800\nSo do think about that when\nyou are helping other people.\n\n413\n00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.890\nI know that it's easy for\nme to be dismissive about it.\n\n414\n00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.450\nIt's not something we should be doing.\n\n415\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.920\nWe should be very helpful and especially\nsince we have access to those tools.\n\n416\n00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.940\n>> Very good.\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n417\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.540\nWell, great show.\n\n418\n00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.490\nGood information.\n\n419\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.490\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n420\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.930\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n421\n00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:21.460\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n422\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.531\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n423\n00:20:23.531 --> 00:20:27.228\n[SOUND]\n\n",
