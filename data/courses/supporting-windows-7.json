          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:07.584\n[SOUND]\nIn this segment,\n\n2\n00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:10.610\nwe're gonna introduce you to a new\nshow that we have lined up for you.\n\n3\n00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.720\nIt is supporting Windows 7.\n\n4\n00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.460\nNow this doesn't line up\nwith any exam per se, but\n\n5\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.350\nthe Windows 7 is still a viable option\nout there for you in the IT world.\n\n6\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.780\nSo, you do need to be\nable to support that guy.\n\n7\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.330\nSo, Ronnie, you have done a great job of\n\n8\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.210\ncoming up with a list of things that\nwe're gonna go over in this show.\n\n9\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.100\nSo, I want you to help us out and\n\n10\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.760\nshow these good people\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n11\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.394\n>> All right, we've got to remember that\neven though we are now at least at Windows\n\n12\n00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:38.539\n10, the very fact is most enterprises,\nand even most home users,\n\n13\n00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.360\nare probably still running Windows 7,\nand that accounts for\n\n14\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.110\nabout 65% of the world's\nPCs that are out there.\n\n15\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.960\nAnd that means we as technicians, whether\nor no you're actually working in the large\n\n16\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.310\nenterprise, or whether we're working\nin a small home environment,\n\n17\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.388\nthat we need to be able to have\nthose technical skills ready to go.\n\n18\n00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:56.460\nSo, if you actually did\ncome in doing Windows 8 and\n\n19\n00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.790\nnow we're actually supporting Windows 10.\n\n20\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.890\nThose are great things\nto actually focus in on.\n\n21\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.690\nBut remember that you have\na lot of the world marketplace\n\n22\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.165\nthat's still on Windows 7.\n\n23\n00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:06.660\nAnd what we wanted to do is we\nwanted to produce a show that would\n\n24\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.570\nhelp us to actually be able to say, look,\nhere's what a technician needs to know.\n\n25\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.610\nSo, this is more about\nthe troubleshooting aspects of somebody,\n\n26\n00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.070\nactually in the field,\nneeding to support Windows 7.\n\n27\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.150\nAnd what we did is we broke up our content\ninto three separate sections here.\n\n28\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.920\nWe talked about installation and\ndeployment.\n\n29\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.070\nWe'll also go over managing and\nmaintaining.\n\n30\n00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.430\nAnd then lastly, we talk about the idea of\noperational issues that we may encounter\n\n31\n00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.700\nas we are supporting Windows 7 as\nan enterprise level technician.\n\n32\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.390\nLet's go ahead and take a look at some\nof these topics that we'll be covering\n\n33\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420\nin this show coming up here.\n\n34\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.390\nSo underneath installation and\ndeployment, we will be talking about\n\n35\n00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.650\nbasic installation issues that\nwe do end up encountering.\n\n36\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.010\nAnd this is when we actually\njust put in the disc and\n\n37\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.620\nsomething ends up happening and\nit's not what we expect.\n\n38\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.180\nWe talk about how to\ntroubleshoot that as well.\n\n39\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.980\nWe'll also take a look briefly\nat image creation issues too.\n\n40\n00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.170\nThis ends up happening a lot\nof times when we are actually\n\n41\n00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.970\ntrying to create an image for our\ndeployment and it doesn't go exactly well.\n\n42\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.830\nWhat are some of the key points\nthat we need to take a look at\n\n43\n00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.560\nto make sure that we can actually\nthe image the way that we want to?\n\n44\n00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.230\nWe even go into a little about\ncreating an answer file as well.\n\n45\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.210\nAnd then lastly,\nworking with their deployment server.\n\n46\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.900\nWhat are some of the encounters\nwe can have there as well?\n\n47\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.910\nAnd those are some of the different\ntechniques that we talk about underneath\n\n48\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.070\ninstallation and deployment.\n\n49\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.270\nWhen we move into the managing and\nmaintaining area, we now actually talk\n\n50\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.920\nabout some of the basic concepts that we\nas technicians need to be familiar with.\n\n51\n00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.870\nIf you're working in an active\ndirectory environment,\n\n52\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.170\nthe idea of working with policies\nare actually clear for what we need to do.\n\n53\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.600\nA lot of times that's gonna\nbe handled a level above\n\n54\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.090\nwhat we're actually doing\nas a support technician.\n\n55\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.340\nBut we do need to understand how that\nactually effects the operating system.\n\n56\n00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.320\nAnd so, we also deal with it\nin terms of a local policy\n\n57\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.370\nas well as the active\ndirectory group policy too.\n\n58\n00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.910\nWe then take a look at\nmonitoring Windows 7.\n\n59\n00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.190\nAnd normally, when we start\nto take a look at monitoring,\n\n60\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.000\nwe're really trying to take a look at\nthe performance issues that end up\n\n61\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.760\nworking inside of Windows 7\nagainst us a lot of times.\n\n62\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.970\nAnd we as technicians need to know that\nthe tools that are actually built in there\n\n63\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.760\nwill help us to effectively be\nable to troubleshoot some of\n\n64\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.110\nthose performance issues, isolate what\nthe issue may be, and even try and\n\n65\n00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.240\nsolve and correct those as well.\n\n66\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.370\nOf course, that means that we also\nneed to deal with security issues.\n\n67\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.820\nAnd these types of security\nissues always pop up,\n\n68\n00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.070\nespecially with the idea of the browser.\n\n69\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.270\nWindows 7, by default,\nactually just has Windows, or\n\n70\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.200\nInternet Explorer 8 actually\nas their default browser.\n\n71\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.100\nBut you can update that and\nthat solves a lot of the issues.\n\n72\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.200\nBut what are some of the other things\nthat we need to be familiar with?\n\n73\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.720\nAnd especially when we actually\ngo to the different websites and\n\n74\n00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.800\nthey don't work the same way that we a,\nare expecting them to.\n\n75\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.680\nWe need to think about that as\nwell as malicious software.\n\n76\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.440\nAnd of course, updating some of\nthe policies involved in that as well.\n\n77\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.060\nAnd then, or course,\n\n78\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.630\nin security, we also talk about file\nencryption as well as drive encryption.\n\n79\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.592\nAnd we talk about that\na little bit more in-depth,\n\n80\n00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:56.140\nso that you understand that these\nare issues that also come up.\n\n81\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.527\nAnd we're really taking a look at\nall of this from the troubleshooting\n\n82\n00:03:58.527 --> 00:03:59.650\nstandpoint, right?\n\n83\n00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.560\nNot that you know how to\nimplement everything,\n\n84\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.460\nbecause more than likely you already do.\n\n85\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.200\nBut what are some of the things\nthat you may end up encountering\n\n86\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.120\nthat you're not sure of.\n\n87\n00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.655\nAnd so, we actually do spend the time\nin focusing in on that as well.\n\n88\n00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:14.970\nWe also of course, take a look at just\nbasic networking connectivity issues that\n\n89\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.150\nwe have to deal with, and name resolution,\nas well as the command line utilities that\n\n90\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.540\nwe end up using a lot of times\nthat we're troubleshooting.\n\n91\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.145\nAnd then of course, accessing things like\nfiles and other resources in our network.\n\n92\n00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:31.120\nLastly, we also wanted\nto address of course,\n\n93\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.470\noperational issues that tend to come and\nplague us as people supporting Windows 7.\n\n94\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.480\nThe idea that applications and\n\n95\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.850\ninstalling applications can be\ncomplex in most environments.\n\n96\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.470\nBut in today's world, it actually is\na lot easier than it was at one time.\n\n97\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.390\nWhen we were moving from\nWindows XP to Windows 7,\n\n98\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.350\nwe may have had some technical issues.\n\n99\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.340\nAnd a lot of those have now been resolved.\n\n100\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.930\nBut at the same time,\n\n101\n00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.970\nyou may still be supporting a line of\nbusiness application in the background,\n\n102\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.965\nand you're not exactly sure what you\ncan do to deal with that as well.\n\n103\n00:05:00.965 --> 00:05:02.640\nWe'll also take a look at that.\n\n104\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.950\nOf course, the UAC,\nas well as hardware-related issues.\n\n105\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.550\nAnd then lastly,\nthe idea of using accessibility, and\n\n106\n00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.770\nof course availability options too.\n\n107\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.320\nThat really does help someone that\nmay have some type of disability, or\n\n108\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.570\nsome type of other issue that they're\nfacing, and they actually just need to\n\n109\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.000\nbe able to work with Windows 7\na little bit more effectively.\n\n110\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.340\nAs support technicians,\n\n111\n00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.790\nthe very fact is we can't just be\ncentric towards one operating system.\n\n112\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.410\nBeing able to support Windows\n7 is actually a great skill to\n\n113\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.040\nhave on your hand.\n\n114\n00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.170\nAnd so, if you are actually supporting\nthis type of operating system\n\n115\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.780\nin your Enterprise environment, or\nyou go, you want to know something,\n\n116\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.110\nI may actually moving on to another\njob and they're running Windows 7, and\n\n117\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.329\neven though I'm actually, you know,\nmore familiar with Windows 8,\n\n118\n00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:45.620\nI need to actually get a little\nmore familiar with it.\n\n119\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.030\nThis is actually the show for you.\n\n120\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.510\nAnd so,\nif you are really interested in this,\n\n121\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.480\nthis is the show you really want to\nwatch if you're especially interested in\n\n122\n00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.690\nbeing able to troubleshoot some of\nthe issues that we talked about here.\n\n123\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.200\n>> That's right.\n\n124\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.050\nLots of great information there for\na Windows 7 environment.\n\n125\n00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.784\nSo if you're still having to find yourself\nsupporting Windows 7, or if you just wanna\n\n126\n00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:04.905\nround out your skill set and make sure\nthat you are relevant no matter what\n\n127\n00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:08.563\nshop you're working in, we look forward\nto seeing you in these upcoming episodes.\n\n128\n00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:15.299\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
