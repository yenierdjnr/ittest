episodes,\n\n4\n00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:14.533\nwe're gonna be covering system\ncenter configuration manager 2012R2.\n\n5\n00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.839\nAnd here to talk to us a little bit\nmore about what we can expect is Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:18.550\nAdam Gordan.\n\n7\n00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.420\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.640\n>> Going well, going well.\n\n9\n00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.530\nThank you so much.\n\n10\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.550\nPleasure to be with all of you.\n\n11\n00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.723\nSo we're gonna be talking\nabout system center 2012 R2.\n\n12\n00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:31.503\nThe exam associated with this\nset of episodes is 70-243.\n\n13\n00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:35.015\nMaybe we could quickly just throw up a,\nthe machine that we have that we're gonna\n\n14\n00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.805\njust demo, a little bit of\nthe information, maybe relevant for\n\n15\n00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.594\nyou with regards to what to expect,\nyou could see on the screen in\n\n16\n00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:43.670\nfront of you there,\nthat we do have the exam information.\n\n17\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.470\nThe current price of the exam, at least\nat the time we're talking to you anyway.\n\n18\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.870\nKeep in mind when you view this\nperhaps 6 to 9 months from now, and\n\n19\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.560\nthat price has hopefully gone down.\n\n20\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.100\nAnd then you'll thank us, and\n\n21\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.240\nif it has gone up well you\nshould have viewed it sooner.\n\n22\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.496\nWhat can I tell you?\n\n23\n00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:58.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But currently $150,\n\n24\n00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.330\nthat is the standard going rate by the way\nfor Microsoft exams in the United States.\n\n25\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.210\nThat is in USD, United States Dollars.\n\n26\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.170\nSo, if you're viewing this from outside\nthe United States, you obviously will get\n\n27\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.520\na different localized price for\nexams internationally, by country or by\n\n28\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.920\ngeography when you go to the appropriate\nMicrosoft website for your region.\n\n29\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.800\nAnd, do understand that.\n\n30\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.510\nAnd that is an important,\nsubtle but important point for\n\n31\n00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.540\nthose of you from outside the U.S.\n\n32\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.540\nExam pricing may very well be different\nacross the globe, and indeed it is.\n\n33\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd it is localized, so\njust make sure you're aware of that.\n\n34\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.920\nHowever, having said that,\nthe exam objectives are not gonna change.\n\n35\n00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.480\nWhenever you take the exam anywhere, they\nare gonna be the same, luckily for you.\n\n36\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.270\nWhich means that going through\nall these episodes with us,\n\n37\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.070\nyou will learn what you need to learn.\n\n38\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.100\nAnd, regardless of where you are,\nyou will be well prepared.\n\n39\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.298\nBut let me warn you know, and please heed\nmy warning, study hard and study long.\n\n40\n00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:52.800\nThis is an exam that requires\na great deal of attention to detail.\n\n41\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.868\nAnd when I talk about detail, if we could\nzoom down just a little bit down there to\n\n42\n00:01:56.868 --> 00:02:00.452\nwhere all those very, very small\nplus signs and blue writing are, and\n\n43\n00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:03.410\nwe're going to zoom in just\na little bit as I'm talking.\n\n44\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.682\nAnd what we will see Is that we\ncan see the exam objectives and\n\n45\n00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:11.536\nthe percentage of coverage\non the exam by objective.\n\n46\n00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:15.717\nAnd so you can see we have design and\nplan System Center Config Manager\n\n47\n00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:19.046\ninfrastructure, roughly\n10 to 15% of the exam.\n\n48\n00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:23.032\nThis is gonna be focusing on things\nlike how do we, from a best practice\n\n49\n00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:28.580\nperspective, understand how to plan for a\nsingle site versus a multi-site hierarchy?\n\n50\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.660\nWe talk a lot about this in our\nepisodes on design and implementation.\n\n51\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.100\nWhat is a single-site hierarchy,\nyou may ask.\n\n52\n00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.095\nWell, come and join me for all the class\nepisodes, and we'll be happy to show you!\n\n53\n00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:41.783\nIf we wanna talk about\nmulti-site hierarchies,\n\n54\n00:02:41.783 --> 00:02:44.983\nwe're talking about central admin sites,\nprimary site or\n\n55\n00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:49.140\nsites and/or secondary sites or\nchild sites that are linked to them.\n\n56\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.968\nBut to find out more, and to see\nthe fabulous drawings that we have for\n\n57\n00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:55.813\nyou that would represent\nall of this information.\n\n58\n00:02:55.813 --> 00:02:58.890\nYou have to actually come and\nparticipate in all of these episodes, so\n\n59\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.980\nwe encourage you to certainly do that.\n\n60\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.473\nYou´ll see managing operating system\ndeployments, what´s known as the OSD,\n\n61\n00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:05.097\nfeature set.\n\n62\n00:03:05.097 --> 00:03:09.725\nAgain roughly 10 to 15%, we walk\nthrough and do a live demonstration of\n\n63\n00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:14.066\nmultiple technology areas in every\none of these exam objective areas,\n\n64\n00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:19.090\nto make sure that you are gonna be able\nto understand what is expected of you.\n\n65\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.930\nHow to use the technology\nin the real world.\n\n66\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.270\nMake sure you understand\nthe best practices.\n\n67\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.090\nAnd the do's and don'ts from the\nperspective of, hey we've done this a lot.\n\n68\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.643\nLet us share our knowledge with you.\n\n69\n00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:33.739\nMake sure you know what to do, but also\nwhat to avoid, and as well as all that\n\n70\n00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.254\nhelp you to then understand how to\npractice the skills hands on so\n\n71\n00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:40.400\nthat you understand how to prepare for\nthis exam.\n\n72\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.539\nSo managing the operating\nsystem deployment feature set,\n\n73\n00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:48.058\nwe're gonna take a look at how to do at\nWindows 8.1 enterprise endpoint deployment\n\n74\n00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.392\nto a bare metal install.\n\n75\n00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:53.600\nGonna actually use a set of hosted labs\ndirectly from Microsoft for that one.\n\n76\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.480\nWe demo on the hands-on lab\ntechnology platform on Technet\n\n77\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.510\nusing Microsoft's own technology.\n\n78\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.348\nAnd their own hosted labs that\nare freely available to you.\n\n79\n00:04:02.348 --> 00:04:05.180\nAnd we will tell you where to find these,\nif you're not familiar with them.\n\n80\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.490\nAnd we walk you through step-by-step how\nto do that entire deployment sequence and\n\n81\n00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.790\nshow it to you live.\n\n82\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.450\nInside that episode.\n\n83\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.190\nDeploying applications and software\nupdates, roughly 10 to 15% of the exam.\n\n84\n00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.870\nWe spend a great deal of time walking\nyou through how to do application and\n\n85\n00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.280\npackage based deployments.\n\n86\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.190\nWe show you how to do both of those live.\n\n87\n00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.107\nAnd we actually walk through,\nand explain to you how and\n\n88\n00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:31.079\nwhat the best practices are behind the\nscenes in terms of how to configure and\n\n89\n00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.953\nset up and\nthen ultimately manage these deployments.\n\n90\n00:04:33.953 --> 00:04:38.020\nManaging compliance settings, we'll\ntake a look at baseline compliance and\n\n91\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.780\ntalk about configuration items and\nhow to set up and manage compliance,\n\n92\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.725\nwe'll actually also import an external\nconfiguration management pack and\n\n93\n00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:49.916\nbring in external configuration items and\nconfiguration baselines from a third\n\n94\n00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:53.583\nparty vendor and show you how to\nimplement those and use those as well.\n\n95\n00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:56.424\nManaging sites,\nwe'll be talking about as we did and\n\n96\n00:04:56.424 --> 00:04:59.391\nwe talked a little bit about\nup top with design and plan,\n\n97\n00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:03.938\nwhat the individual specifics are of site\nmanagement, whether it is a primary site,\n\n98\n00:05:03.938 --> 00:05:07.158\nwhether it is a child site that\nis linked to the primary site,\n\n99\n00:05:07.158 --> 00:05:11.115\nwhether it is a central admin site\nthat the primary site is linked to.\n\n100\n00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:15.108\nWe'll talk about those different sites\nas well as the individual site roles.\n\n101\n00:05:15.108 --> 00:05:19.023\nWhether it is the software update point,\nwhether it is going to be the ability\n\n102\n00:05:19.023 --> 00:05:23.330\nto have a distribution point, a management\npoint, a fall back status point.\n\n103\n00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.470\nA certificate enrollment point,\nwhatever it may be,\n\n104\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.720\nwe'll talk about the majority of these\ncertainly can configure many of them,\n\n105\n00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.380\nand show you how to get in under\nthe hood and work with them.\n\n106\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.480\nHave the nuts and\nbolts at the granular level.\n\n107\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.381\nAnd you'll be joining for those episodes\nhopefully along with all these others, and\n\n108\n00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:39.367\nsee how that is done.\n\n109\n00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:43.600\nWe'll focus on managing clients,\nwe'll focus on managing inventory.\n\n110\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.136\nAnd managing reports and queries, we'll do\na whole episode on how to set up queries,\n\n111\n00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:51.917\nand use them to populate not only\ncollections, but also how to set up and\n\n112\n00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:54.958\ninstall a sequel services,\nrecording services point.\n\n113\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.753\nAnd then we will then actually generate\nand show you how to set up those reports.\n\n114\n00:05:58.753 --> 00:06:02.100\nWe'll also take a look at how\nto use queries generically.\n\n115\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.300\nThe WQL, the W my query language.\n\n116\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.290\nTo be able to go in and\nactually drive queries.\n\n117\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.109\nAnd queries are so valuable,\nso important to what we do in\n\n118\n00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:13.872\nSystem Center Config Manager because\nthey underlie our ability to be able to\n\n119\n00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:17.931\nunderstand how to identify, manage, and\nultimately manipulate information to\n\n120\n00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:21.140\ncreate collections to populate\nthem with dynamic membership.\n\n121\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.048\nAnd to then be able to use that in\naddition to be able to then create and\n\n122\n00:06:25.048 --> 00:06:29.919\ndrive reporting, so we'll be examine these\nand a lot of other little hidden nooks,\n\n123\n00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.200\ncranny's, gems, and valuable insights that\nboth myself and our co host mister Mike.\n\n124\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.110\nWho was the one just introduced\nthis whole episode to you.\n\n125\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.670\nIs gonna go ahead.\n\n126\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.660\nOr are gonna go ahead and share with you.\n\n127\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.178\nAs you join us for this and for\n\n128\n00:06:43.178 --> 00:06:47.619\nall episodes associated with system\ncenter configuration manager 2012 R2.\n\n129\n00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.260\nLook forward to seeing you there.\n\n130\n00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.378\nHopefully you'll be able to come in and\nspend some time with us,\n\n131\n00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:55.612\nlearn about all the really cool and\nvaluable things you can do, and\n\n132\n00:06:55.612 --> 00:06:58.699\nbecome successful at taking and\npassing the 7-243 exam.\n\n133\n00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:05.039\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.015\nToday we're getting started with our\nSystems Center Configuration Manager\n\n5\n00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:22.830\n2012R2.\n\n6\n00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.745\nGreat stuff.\n\n7\n00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.740\nBut before we really dive in and\n\n8\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.690\nstart working with\nSystems Center Configuration Manager.\n\n9\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.030\nSee what its capabilities are and\n\n10\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.140\nall that fun stuff, we really need to\nget familiar with the environment.\n\n11\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.756\nCuz if we can't navigate around that\nconsole, we're not gonna have much fun.\n\n12\n00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:41.190\nSo here to help us with all that is\nthe SCCM expert, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.370\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.930\n>> Good, good.\n\n15\n00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.320\nGood morning, everybody.\n\n16\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.062\nLet's talk a little bit about SCCM 2012R2.\n\n17\n00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:49.733\nAnd what we're gonna specifically do,\nit's good to set the tone for\n\n18\n00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.280\nwhat we're actually gonna take\na look at before we jump right in.\n\n19\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.528\nWe are gonna do a live demo,\ngive you a guided tour of the console,\n\n20\n00:00:55.528 --> 00:00:56.958\nwhat's going on with SCCM.\n\n21\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:00.080\nAnd get kind of that overview stuff\nout of the way in this episode.\n\n22\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.160\nBut before we do that, it's just real\nimportant to throw a couple of things out\n\n23\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.340\nthere for you with regards to\nSystem Center in particular.\n\n24\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.217\nSystem Center itself, it's a suite of\nproducts and we're gonna focus 99% of our\n\n25\n00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:15.321\ntime and energy on SCCM in\nthis whole set of episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:19.840\nAnd this entire talk track and\nconversation around the SCCM product.\n\n27\n00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.090\nBut we are gonna take a look\nat SQL on the back end,\n\n28\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.920\nthe database hosting environment.\n\n29\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.290\nGonna talk about reporting services,\nget that set up for\n\n30\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.910\nyou from a business intelligence,\nBI perspective.\n\n31\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.340\nWe're gonna take a look at some point or\n\n32\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.470\nat least mention some\nof the other products.\n\n33\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.090\nThere's the Ops Manager,\naside from Configuration Manager,\n\n34\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.910\nthere's the Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n35\n00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.600\nThere is the Data Protection Manager,\nthere is the Orhestrator product.\n\n36\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.620\nSo we have a lot of\ndifferent things going on.\n\n37\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.248\nAt some point we'll take\nyou out on the web.\n\n38\n00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:50.810\nWe'll take you to the Microsoft websites,\nshow you the real estate out there.\n\n39\n00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.640\nWe are gonna use a full-featured\nlab environment to do some demos.\n\n40\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.295\nWe're gonna jump in\nthere in just a minute,\n\n41\n00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:57.680\nyou guys will have some options\nto take care of that on your own.\n\n42\n00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.120\nIf you want to not necessarily\nfollow along with the slide.\n\n43\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.283\nBut at some point while you're studying,\nwhile you're preparing,\n\n44\n00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:03.870\nwhile you're getting to\nknow the product better.\n\n45\n00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.757\nIf you wanna be able to\nput your hands on it and\n\n46\n00:02:05.757 --> 00:02:07.446\nwe always recommend you try to do that.\n\n47\n00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:10.620\nIt's always very valuable for you to\nspend some time interacting with and\n\n48\n00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.170\nplaying with the technology.\n\n49\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.810\nNot only to learn more about it,\nbut to get comfortable with it.\n\n50\n00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.890\nSo that when you use it in production,\nyou're not making those mistakes.\n\n51\n00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.210\nFiguring out what's going on there,\nthat's always fun and exciting, but\n\n52\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.580\nusually not a good idea.\n\n53\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.240\nSo wanna try to have you, obviously\nhave a safe place where you can go and\n\n54\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.330\nspend some time.\n\n55\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.350\nThere are hosted free labs,\nthe Microsoft TechNet site.\n\n56\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.450\nWe'll at some point show you those,\ntalk about how you can get access to that.\n\n57\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.920\nYou can download some pretty good figured\nVHDs that Microsoft has up there for\n\n58\n00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.640\ncertain products.\n\n59\n00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.480\nAnd configure that and run that on\nyour own offline if you want to,\n\n60\n00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.210\nso there's lots of different\noptions out there.\n\n61\n00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.100\nYou can even download the install media\nand create a configured solution for\n\n62\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.350\nyourself on one or two machines and set\nup virtual hosting if you wanna do that.\n\n63\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.810\nIf you're running AWS or\nrunning is your fabric, or\n\n64\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.670\nrunning one of the clouds solutions.\n\n65\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.640\nYou actually can build virtual\nmachines and put them up in the cloud.\n\n66\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.530\nThere's lots of different ways for\nyou to build a hands-on lab environment.\n\n67\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.150\nSo, we'll talk about some of those\nthings to give you some guidance there\n\n68\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.910\nat some point.\n\n69\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.060\nBut let's go ahead, let's jump in,\n\n70\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.880\nlet's take a look on what we're\nactually gonna see in the console.\n\n71\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.600\nI wanna spend some time getting\nused to what we're gonna actually\n\n72\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.390\nbe here to talk about.\n\n73\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.766\nSo we gonna go ahead,\nthrow it up on the screen as you can see.\n\n74\n00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:17.731\nAnd let me just quickly describe the\nenvironment to you that you're gonna be\n\n75\n00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:18.249\nlooking up.\n\n76\n00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:22.318\nI'm gonna zoom in here for you for\njust a second and wow look at that, blue.\n\n77\n00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:23.177\nOutstanding.\n\n78\n00:03:23.177 --> 00:03:24.090\n>> That's pretty.\n>> All right, so\n\n79\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.420\nlet's actually go over here.\n\n80\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.627\nWe do have a virtual desktop,\n\n81\n00:03:26.627 --> 00:03:29.151\nseveral different machines\nactually that we're gonna use.\n\n82\n00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:32.250\nYou can see that we have a little\npick list here on the left-hand side.\n\n83\n00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.370\nI'm going to be primarily on this SO1\nmachine, which is a System Center server,\n\n84\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.230\nConfig Manager server in this case.\n\n85\n00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.690\nAnd we got a bunch of\nshortcuts on the screen,\n\n86\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.050\nwe're not gonna worry too much\nabout those for the time being.\n\n87\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.262\nWhat we're gonna be doing\nis really just focusing\n\n88\n00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:47.750\nin on the System Center Config Manager\nconsole.\n\n89\n00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.874\nSo what I'm gonna do,\n\n90\n00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:52.378\nif you give me just a second here to\nscroll down is bring up the console.\n\n91\n00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:54.420\nLet me just bring that up and\nget that up and running.\n\n92\n00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.560\nI've got it already set up and installed\nin this particular set of demos for us.\n\n93\n00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.200\nAnd what we're gonna do is spend some\ntime just getting used to what's in\n\n94\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.328\nthe console, doing a little show and tell.\n\n95\n00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:07.920\nWe're gonna backup after we do this\ndiscussion in an upcoming episode and\n\n96\n00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.380\nactually walk you through.\n\n97\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.010\nNot only the thought process\nof architecture, the do's and\n\n98\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.470\ndon't's about what you need\nto do in order to install.\n\n99\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.150\nHow we set it up,\nwhat the hierarchy is, all that.\n\n100\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.732\nWe're actually gonna walk you through\na live demo of doing an install and\n\n101\n00:04:19.732 --> 00:04:21.012\nbuilding out a solution yourself.\n\n102\n00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:23.331\nSo you're gonna get to see\nhow all this gets set up, but\n\n103\n00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:25.740\nwanna start from hey it's already up and\nrunning.\n\n104\n00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.381\nLet's get comfortable\nwith what's in there, so\n\n105\n00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:29.305\nyou have an idea and\nthen we'll talk about how to build it.\n\n106\n00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:31.640\nSo that's what we're gonna spend\nsome time doing right now.\n\n107\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.350\nSo what we may wanna do is move the screen\nin screen and just go to the full screen.\n\n108\n00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.510\nSo we can see that environment and we're\nnot losing that lower right-hand corner.\n\n109\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.341\nWe'll do that as we're talking,\nthere we go.\n\n110\n00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.299\nAnd what I'm gonna do is just spend a\nlittle time and I'm gonna zoom in here so\n\n111\n00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:45.700\nyou can see this real quick.\n\n112\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.810\nSpend a little time going over,\nwhoops, not quite that far.\n\n113\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.270\nSpend a little time going over what\nare called the workspaces for you.\n\n114\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.720\nWhich of these areas on the sliders,\nthe Assets and\n\n115\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.780\nCompliance, Software Library,\nMonitoring and Administration areas.\n\n116\n00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.490\nI wanna be able to just walk you through\nthose and show you what's in there.\n\n117\n00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.216\nSo we're gonna take a look at them and\n\n118\n00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:05.396\nkinda spend just a couple\nminutes on each one.\n\n119\n00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:07.970\nWe're gonna start with Administration.\n\n120\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.420\nI'm gonna zoom back in for\nyou in just a second here,\n\n121\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.200\nlet me just click on and\nselect the Overview areas.\n\n122\n00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.880\nSo we can see what's going on.\n\n123\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.060\nAnd when we do that and\n\n124\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.660\nwe zoom in, you'll see that we\nhave when we click the Overview.\n\n125\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.210\nA bunch of hyperlinks that basically just\ntell us where we can go, what we can do.\n\n126\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.080\nWhich correspond to the areas on\nthe left-hand side of the screen\n\n127\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.540\nnavigation wise, right?\n\n128\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.290\nAnd as we scroll over, you'll see here\nthat we have Hierarchy Configuration.\n\n129\n00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.730\nYou'll see we have Cloud Services\nup under Overview.\n\n130\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.060\nWe have Site Configuration,\nthese are folders that we'll open up and\n\n131\n00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.040\ntake a look at.\n\n132\n00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.930\nI've exploded Site Configuration for\n\n133\n00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.410\nyou and you'll see under there we have\nSites and Servers and Site System Roles.\n\n134\n00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.980\nWe'll obviously be interested in going in\nthere, seeing what's going on in there.\n\n135\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.440\nWe have Client Settings as we move down\nand you can see with Client Settings.\n\n136\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.750\nWhen we do go in there and\nwe'll take a look at that in a minute.\n\n137\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.670\nThat we're gonna be able to configure\nall the different settings that'll be\n\n138\n00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.870\neffectively controlling the client or\nthe agent as it's sometimes referred to.\n\n139\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.670\nWhich is a piece of software that we\ninstall on every machine that we wanna\n\n140\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.710\nmonitor and we ultimately wanna manage and\ncontrol with SCCM.\n\n141\n00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.017\nWhether it's a server,\nwhether it is a desktop endpoint,\n\n142\n00:06:14.017 --> 00:06:17.535\nwhatever it may be if it's gonna\nhave the client running on it.\n\n143\n00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:20.966\nAnd it's just not Windows machines,\nwe can actually interact with and\n\n144\n00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:23.500\nwe can account for\nan inventory perspective.\n\n145\n00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.880\nMacintosh machines, UNIX, LINUX,\nnetwork related hardware, so\n\n146\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.360\nthings like routers and\nswitches can be inventory.\n\n147\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.188\nWe don't need clients and\nagents for all of them.\n\n148\n00:06:32.188 --> 00:06:34.760\nWe're gonna use SNMP to do\nthe discovery on some of them.\n\n149\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.890\nBut then we're gonna be able to control\nthe configure the settings on those,\n\n150\n00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:38.900\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n151\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.060\n>> So when they're referring\nto client settings there,\n\n152\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.130\nthey're not talking about\nclient operating system.\n\n153\n00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.480\nIt's any machine or\ndevice that's connecting to SCCM.\n\n154\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.080\n>> It's any machine or\ndevice that's runs as client agent and\n\n155\n00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.480\nthe settings of the client agent is what\nwe're gonna be taking a look at there.\n\n156\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.390\nGood point to clarify, cuz we don't\nwant it to be construed by mistake.\n\n157\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.740\nThat it could be the operating system\nthat we're talking about absolutely.\n\n158\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.290\nAnd then we have Security and\nobviously no good Microsoft product or\n\n159\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.680\nno product on the Microsoft side or\nany product for that matter.\n\n160\n00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.988\nIn any system, would be good and for\nus to consider it really complete,\n\n161\n00:07:08.988 --> 00:07:11.317\nwithout being able to look at security and\nroles.\n\n162\n00:07:11.317 --> 00:07:12.800\nWe're gonna take a look at those.\n\n163\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.685\nWe have Distribution Points, Distribution\nPoint Groups there and a Migration folder.\n\n164\n00:07:16.685 --> 00:07:17.985\nAnd we'll talk a bit about migration.\n\n165\n00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:21.182\nWe're not gonna spend too much time in\nthat particular area right now, but\n\n166\n00:07:21.182 --> 00:07:23.190\nit will be something for us to consider.\n\n167\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.310\nLet's open up a couple\nof these areas here.\n\n168\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.630\nWe'll start with Hierarchy Configuration.\n\n169\n00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.215\nAnd let me zoom back in once\nwe have that exploded out, so\n\n170\n00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:31.870\nwe can see that a little bit better.\n\n171\n00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.529\nWe'll just scroll over and we can see\nunder Hierarchy Configuration that we're\n\n172\n00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:37.160\ngonna have our Discovery Methods.\n\n173\n00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.210\nOne of the most important things\nwe do is set up our boundaries,\n\n174\n00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.270\nour boundary groups,\nour discovery methods.\n\n175\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.250\nThat's gonna give us a structure\nthat allows us effectively\n\n176\n00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.950\nto figure out the topology.\n\n177\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.480\nOr the layout of all the systems\nwe're gonna use with\n\n178\n00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.810\nSystem Center Configuration Manager.\n\n179\n00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.200\nTo be able to not only control them, but\nfigure out what's out there and grab them.\n\n180\n00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.418\nAnd ultimately bring them into the console\nmanagement from an inventory perspective.\n\n181\n00:07:59.418 --> 00:08:01.383\nSo, Discovery Methods help us to do that,\n\n182\n00:08:01.383 --> 00:08:04.440\nwe have six discovery methods We'll\ntake a look at what they are and\n\n183\n00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.190\nhow they are configured in one\nof our later conversations.\n\n184\n00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.997\nBoundaries are gonna help establish\neither through IP subnet or\n\n185\n00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:12.484\nactive directory site.\n\n186\n00:08:12.484 --> 00:08:16.564\nAnd the idea of the site structures in\nAD is an important thought process for\n\n187\n00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:18.930\nus to at least be aware of and\nacknowledge.\n\n188\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.620\nA lot of times when we think about a\nproduct like System Center Config Manager,\n\n189\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.990\nthink about Exchange, which is\nanother great example or SharePoint\n\n190\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.860\nwhich are all great examples of AD\nintegrated products and solutions today.\n\n191\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.827\nWe have to be aware of the fact that\ntoday, when I say today I mean using\n\n192\n00:08:33.827 --> 00:08:37.477\na product like this, the 2012 R2 version,\neverything is integrated into AD.\n\n193\n00:08:37.477 --> 00:08:41.350\nEverything is integrated\ninto Active Directory.\n\n194\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.490\nLet's formally call it ADDS, active\ndirectory directory services, and Server\n\n195\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:51.260\n2012 R2 we're in server 16 which will\nbe coming to a solution near you soon.\n\n196\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.760\nWe'll be seeing server 16 most\nlikely coming out probably\n\n197\n00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.270\nthird quarter halfway through maybe\nthird quarter of 2016, is where we'll\n\n198\n00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.970\nprobably see that previewing and\nultimately coming out formally.\n\n199\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.740\nBut for now certainly Server 12 R2.\n\n200\n00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.670\nWhen we go out and we talk about these\nproducts, we are linking their usage and\n\n201\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.290\nwe are linking their\ninformation management and\n\n202\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.700\nin many cases the properties\nthat are configured for them and\n\n203\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.970\nobjects that are created to manage them\nare done in the LDAP directory today.\n\n204\n00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.730\nAnd so this product like many others,\ntotally integrated into AD.\n\n205\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.460\nWe can leverage those site boundaries\nin order to set up boundaries for\n\n206\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.160\nmanagement within SECM.\n\n207\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.040\nThat's one of the boundary options that\nwe'll take a look at as we go through\n\n208\n00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.040\nconfiguration.\n\n209\n00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.850\nSo we're seeing all that,\nwe have an exchange server connector,\n\n210\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.885\nor connectors which allows us to be\nable to do management of any device,\n\n211\n00:09:38.885 --> 00:09:43.490\nnon-Microsoft device and Microsoft devices\nthat use the active sync connector\n\n212\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.480\nin order to be able to do configuration,\nmanagement from our perspective with SECM.\n\n213\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.910\nBut if they use the Active Sync Connector\nto be able to interact with mail,\n\n214\n00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.360\nwhich all Microsoft devices can do.\n\n215\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.540\nA Windows mobile device can\nuse the ActiveSync connector.\n\n216\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.660\nBut non-Windows devices can as well,\nAndroid devices, Blackberry devices,\n\n217\n00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.140\ncertainly the Apple devices,\nin terms of handheld devices to get mail.\n\n218\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.300\nIf they're running the Active Sync\nconnector, we actually can leverage that\n\n219\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.160\nconnector to do some sort of device\nmanagement potentially to be able to do\n\n220\n00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.710\ninventory as well as some sort of device\nmanagement, depending on the platform.\n\n221\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.140\nSo what we're gonna be able to see is\nwhen we don't deploy that agent that we\n\n222\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:24.705\ntalked about.\n\n223\n00:10:24.705 --> 00:10:26.005\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The client, but we are.\n\n224\n00:10:26.005 --> 00:10:28.125\nWe are still gonna wanna manage\nthose dumb Microsoft devices.\n\n225\n00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:29.845\nWe do it through this\nExchange Server Connector.\n\n226\n00:10:29.845 --> 00:10:33.265\n>> Right and something very important\nobviously in today's environment they're\n\n227\n00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:37.385\nso mixed you're running such\na variety of operating systems and\n\n228\n00:10:37.385 --> 00:10:38.425\na variety of devices.\n\n229\n00:10:38.425 --> 00:10:39.540\nSo fantastic.\n\n230\n00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.990\n>> So yeah,\nthat's gonna be pretty exciting and\n\n231\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.350\nit's gonna obviously give\nus a lot of flexibility and\n\n232\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.910\na lot of ability to be able to do\nthe things that we want to be able to do,\n\n233\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.470\nat least from that perspective.\n\n234\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.120\nLet's just zoom back in here for a minute.\n\n235\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:57.630\nLet me just scroll down here real\nquick and let's zoom back in.\n\n236\n00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.480\nThere we go.\nYeah it just takes a second to catch up on\n\n237\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.550\nme when I'm talking about\nwanting to do something.\n\n238\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.580\nLet me just zoom in a little bit.\n\n239\n00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.690\nThere we go.\nWrong way.\n\n240\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.640\nRight idea.\n\n241\n00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.950\nSo, when we have cloud services,\n\n242\n00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.760\njust opening up the folder below, you'll\nsee we have a Windows Intune Subscription\n\n243\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.740\nwith Cloud Distribution Points, two things\nthat allow us to interact with effectively\n\n244\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.760\nthe we'll call it the cloud\nfabric generically.\n\n245\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.550\nWe're really thinking with\nCloud Distribution Points about\n\n246\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.830\nputting distribution points out into\nliterally the cloud, out on the internet.\n\n247\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.120\nWe may link them to the Azure fabric or\nwe may not,\n\n248\n00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.820\nit really just depends on what we're\ndoing and where we're hosting.\n\n249\n00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.500\nBut the idea generically is that we can\nnow take a distribution point which\n\n250\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.320\nis gonna be the heart and\nsoul of what we do with SCCM\n\n251\n00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.280\nfrom the perspective of pushing\napplications and packages out.\n\n252\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.040\nTo be able to deploy\nsoftware to end points,\n\n253\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.520\nwe need a distribution point one or\nmore to do that.\n\n254\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.270\nTraditional ways of doing this have\nbeen we have distribution points\n\n255\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.690\ninside of our sites.\n\n256\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.060\nThey are one or more machines.\n\n257\n00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.750\nEither a site server of some kind or\na Windows workstation cuz we can actually\n\n258\n00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.340\nset up distribution points on a Windows\n7 or a Windows 8 workstation.\n\n259\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.010\nAs long as it can run IIS and\nsupport the distribution of software\n\n260\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.590\nwith enough room on the hard drive,\nwe don't need to have a server.\n\n261\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.560\nSo that gives us a lot of flexibility and\nthat's been the case for some time, but\n\n262\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.373\nnow we can actually put those distribution\npoints out in the cloud with 2012 R2,\n\n263\n00:12:15.373 --> 00:12:16.000\nwhich is a new feature.\n\n264\n00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.340\nAnd we also have\nthe Windows Intune tie in,\n\n265\n00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.490\nwhich is gonna allow us to do effective\nDevice management through Windows Intune.\n\n266\n00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:30.510\nA lot of companies have not jumped totally\ninto Systems Center Config Manager.\n\n267\n00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.520\nThey've kinda put their toe in\nthe water with some of the technology.\n\n268\n00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.590\nBut they may have bought\na subscription Windows Intune,\n\n269\n00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.220\nwhich in effect, is kinda like\nSystems Center Config Manager.\n\n270\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.680\nBut it's System Center Config Manager\nlite, if you wanna think of it that way.\n\n271\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.020\nIt is a cloud based description\nservice Microsoft just created\n\n272\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.440\nover the last iteration or\ntwo of the product.\n\n273\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.480\nThat's part of the larger Azure cloud,\npart of the larger Microsoft Office\n\n274\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.360\n365 cloud push that Microsoft has in\nmarket and has had for some time now.\n\n275\n00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.680\nAnd effectively for companies that\nwould not spend the money and\n\n276\n00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.640\nthe time it took to buy a full system\ncenter license on the enterprise side\n\n277\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.310\ndeploy one or more products\nto build this infrastructure.\n\n278\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.260\nYou could pay Microsoft $7 a month or\nwhatever the going rate would be per\n\n279\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.370\ndevice to effectively do cloud based\nmanagement of your devices in end point.\n\n280\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.391\nSo that's what Windows Intune has been and\ncontinues to be.\n\n281\n00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:23.670\nWe can tie Windows Intune,\nIf you already have that capability,\n\n282\n00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.680\nwe can tie that into\nSystem Center Config Manager.\n\n283\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.070\nBring those devices in through\na shift of the subscription and\n\n284\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.830\neffectively manage it through SCCF.\n\n285\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.450\nAnd so we don't lose that investment, but\n\n286\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.490\nwe now kind of effectively\npay it forward and up it, so\n\n287\n00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:42.060\nwe can bring it in as SCCM, totally\ngrabbing and configuring those clients.\n\n288\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.320\nThe upside that we get to leverage\nthat existing client base and\n\n289\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.490\nthose subscription.\n\n290\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.390\nThe downside is, we'll talk more about\nthis when we get into this in one\n\n291\n00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.560\nof the further episodes down the road.\n\n292\n00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.180\nThe potential downside is that when we\ndo this, we shift that subscription\n\n293\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.080\nover to SCCM, we lose the ability to\nmanage it through Windows Intune.\n\n294\n00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.430\nAnd so\neffectively we don't lose anything, but\n\n295\n00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.540\nthe control of that subscription\nnow resides with SCCM.\n\n296\n00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.600\nIf for any reason down the road,\nwe decide to get rid of SCCM and\n\n297\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.130\ngo back to just Windows Intune, we\neffectively have to redo the subscription\n\n298\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.010\nand recreate that infrastructure and\n\n299\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.840\nthe association because it's all\neffectively shifted from Microsoft to us.\n\n300\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.370\nAnd there's only, unfortunately,\nit's only a one-way path right now.\n\n301\n00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.190\n>> Right.\n\n302\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.250\n>> You can bring it in.\n\n303\n00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.515\nYou can't take it back out again and\nput it back out there.\n\n304\n00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:25.620\nSo, some do's and don't's.\n\n305\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.980\n>> Yeah.\n>> We'll talk more about some of that\n\n306\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.110\nstuff as we go.\n\n307\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.840\nBut just interesting to be\naware of that as we s we,\n\n308\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.872\nkind of continue to think\nabout what's going on there.\n\n309\n00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.490\nLet's just scroll down\na little bit more here.\n\n310\n00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.300\nThere we go.\n\n311\n00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.620\nAnd we have, I'm just gonna open\nup the securities area as well.\n\n312\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.600\nAnd just be able to, there we go.\n\n313\n00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.840\nJust preview all of that.\n\n314\n00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.160\nLet me just zoom back in real quick and\nmove up and so underside\n\n315\n00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.210\nconfiguration as I said and we'll zoom in\na little bit there so we can see that.\n\n316\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.720\nWe do have our Servers and\n\n317\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.170\nSite System Roles, Client Settings,\nkinda took a look at that already.\n\n318\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.120\nBut Security as I mentioned,\nwe have our Administrative Users,\n\n319\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.470\nour Security Roles, we have our Scopes,\nour Accounts, our Certificates.\n\n320\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.200\nWe'll be delving into all this and\ntalking about what these things are.\n\n321\n00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.200\nWe got 15 built in Security Roles.\n\n322\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.525\nWe'll take a look at them for\ndelegated administrative purposes.\n\n323\n00:15:11.525 --> 00:15:15.765\nIf for instance I want go ahead and give\nMike the right just to deploy applications\n\n324\n00:15:15.765 --> 00:15:18.295\nor packages, but\nI don't want to give him full\n\n325\n00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:22.510\nadmin rights to the entire SCCM install,\nI can do that with a delegated role.\n\n326\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.000\nIf I wanna give somebody rights\njust to be able to run reports and\n\n327\n00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000\nlook at reporting but\nnot have rights to deploy packages and\n\n328\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.470\nnot have rights to work with collections,\nI can do that with reporting.\n\n329\n00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.820\nSo I've got a bunch of those roles,\nwe'll take a look at that thought process.\n\n330\n00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.790\nMakes a lot of sense.\n\n331\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.380\n>> Principle of least\nprivilege type thing.\n\n332\n00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.770\n>> Principle of least privilege,\nyou're delegated responsibility and\n\n333\n00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.990\nrole management, absolutely.\n\n334\n00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:42.635\nSo very similar to what we\nsee everywhere else, right?\n\n335\n00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:43.440\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If we think about that.\n\n336\n00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.910\nAnd we've got out Distribution Points.\n\n337\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.250\nWe've talked about those already and\nwe see what those are.\n\n338\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.780\nSo that's really what's gonna\nhappen in the administration area.\n\n339\n00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.105\nLet's go up and let's take a look at\nthe Asset and Compliance workspace.\n\n340\n00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:56.850\nSo I'm gonna click on that and\nwe're gonna transition there.\n\n341\n00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.160\nJust take a second to\nbe able to move that.\n\n342\n00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.359\nAnd get that up and running.\n\n343\n00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:03.094\nLet me just open up these folders here so\n\n344\n00:16:03.094 --> 00:16:05.050\nwe can see what's in\nthere before I zoom in.\n\n345\n00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.620\nSo give me just a second to do that, and\nthen we'll go ahead and we'll zoom in.\n\n346\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:14.330\nSo when we move in over here,\nwhat we can see is we have our users,\n\n347\n00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.490\nour devices, our user collections,\ndevice collections.\n\n348\n00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:23.330\nThis is in the asset management and\nthe asset and collections area.\n\n349\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.020\nThe users, obviously individual users,\ndevices, individual devices.\n\n350\n00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.200\nDevices equal computers, right, endpoints.\n\n351\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.320\nSo we'll be able to bring\nin individual users and\n\n352\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.270\ndevices through a discovery method.\n\n353\n00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.720\nWe have an active directory user\ndiscovery method, an active directory\n\n354\n00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.450\ngroup discovery method, active\ndirectory computer discovery method.\n\n355\n00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.830\nAs well as name space discovery methods\nfor the domain in the forest, etc.\n\n356\n00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.220\nSo gonna be able to leverage as\nI said the active directory.\n\n357\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.860\nWe're then gonna be able to put those\nusers and/or devices into collections.\n\n358\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.130\nThink of them very similar to what you\nwould see in the active directory user\n\n359\n00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:54.930\nmanager.\n\n360\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.140\nYou go to AD users and\ncomputers where you have your OU folders,\n\n361\n00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.350\nand everything is subdivided.\n\n362\n00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.520\nYou have a user, although you\ntypically may subdivide that and\n\n363\n00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.520\nbreak that out by geography or something.\n\n364\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.110\nWe're gonna use collections\nin roughly the same way.\n\n365\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:11.820\nCollections are gonna allow us to group\ntogether users or devices for management\n\n366\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:16.410\nand for reporting and tracking purposes,\nand we can have multiple collections.\n\n367\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.930\nWe have built in ones, and\nthen we have our own that we can make.\n\n368\n00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.470\nWe'll walk you through how to\ndo that over time as well and\n\n369\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.500\nsee how to deal with that.\n\n370\n00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.220\nWe've got asset intelligence,\n\n371\n00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.820\nlet's just scroll down a little bit,\nthen I'll zoom back in.\n\n372\n00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.590\nWe've got asset intelligence,\nwe'll be taking a look at this later,\n\n373\n00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.770\nwhere we take a look at\nour software catalog.\n\n374\n00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.830\nWe take a look at inventoried software,\nwe take a look at the things that we\n\n375\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.480\nare gathering and managing for\ncompliance management and baselines.\n\n376\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.000\nBetween Asset Intelligence,\nSoftware Metering and\n\n377\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000\nCompliance Settings down\ntowards the bottom.\n\n378\n00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.450\nSo we're gonna be able to do a full\nsolution that involves effectively\n\n379\n00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.370\nwhat we would call SAM, software asset\nmanagement or hardware asset management.\n\n380\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.770\nOr generically just asset\nmanagement solutions were we can\n\n381\n00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.560\ntake effectively a picture of what\ngoes on on a system, from a software,\n\n382\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.840\nfrom a hardware perspective.\n\n383\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.280\nWe can capture those settings.\n\n384\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.440\nWe can inventory them,\nreport on them, manage them,\n\n385\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.015\nbut we also could create baselines\nthat can then be applied to systems.\n\n386\n00:18:10.015 --> 00:18:14.980\nAnd we could do configuration monitoring\nto make sure those baselines are going\n\n387\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.040\nto be in effect.\n\n388\n00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.890\nAnd if they're not,\nthen we have a deviation.\n\n389\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.450\nWe can go back and\nreport on that or remediate.\n\n390\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.170\n>> Oh nice.\n\n391\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.990\n>> So we have a full asset\nin management capability and\n\n392\n00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.870\nsuite of solutions within\nthis particular product line.\n\n393\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:30.290\nSo we're gonna see all that inside\nof the Assets and Compliance area.\n\n394\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.520\nLet me just scroll down\ntowards the bottom here.\n\n395\n00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.300\nAnd we're gonna have our\nendpoint protection, and\n\n396\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.030\nlet me just zoom back in so you can see\nthat, cuz it wasn't in the other shot.\n\n397\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.250\nAnd you'll see there with endpoint\nprotection, we have the ability to take\n\n398\n00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.470\nover the security functions of\nan endpoint system that's being managed.\n\n399\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.070\nA Windows based system, obviously,\nI want to be clear about this.\n\n400\n00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.435\nNot the Apple iPhone,\nnot the Android mobile device,\n\n401\n00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:57.650\ncuz we are gonna manage those\nas we said through ActiveSync.\n\n402\n00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.250\nBut we're not gonna be able to\nconfigure anti-malware policies or\n\n403\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.960\nfirewall policies on those.\n\n404\n00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.910\nBut if it is a Windows endpoint,\nwe are gonna be able to do that.\n\n405\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.280\nAnd through endpoint protection,\n\n406\n00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.460\nwe are going to be able to effectively\ntake over and configure those settings.\n\n407\n00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.550\nThis is much like group policy\nbased management, right?\n\n408\n00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.040\nWe can do the same thing\ntoday with group policy.\n\n409\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.070\nThrough the generic thought process of\njust using the Windows active directory\n\n410\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.600\nand group policy management\nconsole to configure policies.\n\n411\n00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.410\nBut we're gonna be able to bring that and\n\n412\n00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.440\nshift that focus into SSCM if we choose\nto here through endpoint protection.\n\n413\n00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.830\nAnd then effectively be able\nto do that if we choose to.\n\n414\n00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.350\nSo we configure the Windows Defender\nproduct on the anti-malware side,\n\n415\n00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.920\nconfigure the firewall, and specify\nwhat those protection settings are.\n\n416\n00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.600\nAnd again, we can monitor to\nmake sure that they're in force,\n\n417\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.280\nwhich is one of the nice things about it.\n\n418\n00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.565\nThe group policy gives us\nthe same basic option.\n\n419\n00:19:42.565 --> 00:19:45.385\nWe can do those things,\nit's just gonna allow us to effectively\n\n420\n00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:47.955\nbring that functionality\ntogether into one place.\n\n421\n00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:51.175\nWe're gonna shift over to\nthe software library work space here.\n\n422\n00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:54.015\nWe're just gonna open these\nfolders up that we see here to\n\n423\n00:19:54.015 --> 00:19:56.485\ngive you a understanding\nof what's going on in here.\n\n424\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.770\nThis is where we're going to have\nthe application management area.\n\n425\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:05.670\nThis is where we're gonna have\nthe operating system deployment area.\n\n426\n00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.600\nAnd this is where we're going\nto have the software updates for\n\n427\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.470\nthe Windows WSUS functionality, the patch\nmanagement functionality that exists.\n\n428\n00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.240\nSo, let's just zoom in here first and\n\n429\n00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.460\ntake a look at some of the stuff\nthat's going on there.\n\n430\n00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.050\nWe have, do one of those,\nwoo, look at that.\n\n431\n00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:22.890\nBit by bit, right?\n\n432\n00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.290\nSo we have Application Management\nthat you could see up under here,\n\n433\n00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.690\nwe're gonna spend some significant\ntime in future episodes in this area.\n\n434\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.910\nTalking about how to build applications,\n\n435\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.610\nhow to build packages,\nwhat the difference is between the two.\n\n436\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.400\nWhy do we have both?\n\n437\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.690\nA lot of people often\nget confused about this.\n\n438\n00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.130\nAren't I just applying software, and\n\n439\n00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.610\ndon't I just create this thing and\nkinda throw it out there?\n\n440\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.780\nThe answer is yes, but we have to\ndifferentiate between an application and\n\n441\n00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.280\na package, and\nreally understand what's happening there.\n\n442\n00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.296\nIt comes down to whether we have a .exe or\na .msi file that's driving deployment for\n\n443\n00:20:51.296 --> 00:20:54.224\nus, and sometimes we do have a .msi,\nsometimes we don't.\n\n444\n00:20:54.224 --> 00:20:57.000\nA lot of times vendors will give\nus executables, they may or\n\n445\n00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.820\nmay not go to the trouble of\npackaging them up into MSIs.\n\n446\n00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.750\nAnd we may or may not have a repackager\nthat let's us create our own MSI.\n\n447\n00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.570\nSo it's a lot of variables\nthat are going on there.\n\n448\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.160\nWe're gonna talk about those things,\ntake a look at how to do all that.\n\n449\n00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.110\nGot some cool exercise base demos\nwe're gonna do to go in and say, hey,\n\n450\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.040\nwhat do we do if we want\nto deploy an application?\n\n451\n00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.570\nHow do we walk through that process,\nhow are we gonna do all that?\n\n452\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.909\nSo we'll be taking a look at that.\n\n453\n00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.250\nWe're also gonna take\na look at software updates.\n\n454\n00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:25.124\nLet's just scroll back in down on\nthe bottom there so you can see that.\n\n455\n00:21:25.124 --> 00:21:28.640\nThis is our patch management,\nour WSUS functionality.\n\n456\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.408\nWhere we're gonna be able\nto build a WSUS catalog.\n\n457\n00:21:31.408 --> 00:21:35.725\nAnd we're gonna link SCCM to WSUS, we\nstill have to use the WSUS functionality.\n\n458\n00:21:35.725 --> 00:21:38.465\nWe'll be able to leverage that\nto create that functionality,\n\n459\n00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.695\nhave that catalog available for downloads.\n\n460\n00:21:40.695 --> 00:21:43.997\nWe're gonna be able to do the patch\nmanagement within the system here, so\n\n461\n00:21:43.997 --> 00:21:48.287\nall software updates,\ndeploy the software updates, manage them.\n\n462\n00:21:48.287 --> 00:21:50.877\nVery similar to what we\nwould do without SCCM or\n\n463\n00:21:50.877 --> 00:21:52.987\njust using WSUS generically outside.\n\n464\n00:21:52.987 --> 00:21:54.807\nAnd you can see,\nwe have what's known as the OSD or\n\n465\n00:21:54.807 --> 00:21:56.127\noperating system deployment area.\n\n466\n00:21:56.127 --> 00:22:00.577\nThis is where we're gonna be able to\nload drivers, create driver packages or\n\n467\n00:22:00.577 --> 00:22:04.957\nintegrate drivers and driver packages,\noperating system images, boot images.\n\n468\n00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:08.340\nDo task sequencing,\ncreate virtual hard disks if we need to.\n\n469\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.430\nThis is effectively bringing in the MDT,\n\n470\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.730\nthe Microsoft Deployment Toolkit\nfunctionality.\n\n471\n00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.340\nBeing able to integrate that\ntotally with our imaging.\n\n472\n00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.210\nSo this is almost like\nWindows Deployment Services,\n\n473\n00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.610\nWDS, along with MDT,\nMicrosoft Deployment Toolkit.\n\n474\n00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.750\nWe're gonna be able to effectively\nbring all that functionality in and\n\n475\n00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.710\ncreate a full solution for\noperating system imaging, deployment, and\n\n476\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.640\nmanagement from within SCCM.\n\n477\n00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.285\nWe're gonna take some time and\nexplore how that works as well, and\n\n478\n00:22:35.285 --> 00:22:38.455\nmake sure we do a real good thorough job\nof explaining how to walk through that.\n\n479\n00:22:38.455 --> 00:22:41.475\nSo by the time we're done in future\nepisodes you guys will feel real\n\n480\n00:22:41.475 --> 00:22:44.335\ncomfortable being able to go in and being\nable to do operating system deployment.\n\n481\n00:22:44.335 --> 00:22:46.075\nSo we're gonna definitely\ntake a look at that.\n\n482\n00:22:47.302 --> 00:22:49.652\nAnd then in the Monitoring area up here,\n\n483\n00:22:49.652 --> 00:22:53.012\nwhat we're going to see is we're\ngoing to see we have alerts.\n\n484\n00:22:53.012 --> 00:22:55.572\nLet me just zoom in so\nyou guys can see that a little bit better.\n\n485\n00:22:55.572 --> 00:22:56.692\nWe have our alerts area.\n\n486\n00:22:56.692 --> 00:22:59.441\nWe'll be taking a look at that\nfrom a monitoring perspective.\n\n487\n00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:02.241\nWe have queries, we're gonna spend\nsome time on how to write queries and\n\n488\n00:23:02.241 --> 00:23:04.711\nhow to use queries to drive\ncollection membership.\n\n489\n00:23:04.711 --> 00:23:06.681\nAnd be able to drive all\nthe things we need to do.\n\n490\n00:23:06.681 --> 00:23:09.171\nWe've got reporting integrated here, so\n\n491\n00:23:09.171 --> 00:23:11.790\nSQL Server Reporting Services\ncan be set up.\n\n492\n00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.050\nWe'll set up a reporting service point,\nsee how to do that, integrate it,\n\n493\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.160\nand then do reporting.\n\n494\n00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.330\nWe've got close to 500 reports\nthat are available and\n\n495\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.660\nwe're gonna take a look at those.\n\n496\n00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.520\nGot a nice little spreadsheet we'll share\nwith you that lists all the current\n\n497\n00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.530\nreports that are available.\n\n498\n00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:25.730\nAnd we'll make that available for\n\n499\n00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.850\neverybody as a resource you guys can\nuse as a reference if you need to.\n\n500\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.752\nBe able to take a look at system status.\n\n501\n00:23:30.752 --> 00:23:34.850\nSo we'll be able to take a look and\nsee what the status of the system is,\n\n502\n00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.710\nwhat the status of our deployments are.\n\n503\n00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.600\nWhat client status operation looks like,\n\n504\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.910\nclient status database replication,\ndistribution status,\n\n505\n00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.010\nsoftware update point synchronization\nstatus, endpoint protection status.\n\n506\n00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.050\nWe've got status for\nthis, status for that.\n\n507\n00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.150\nWe've got status for everything.\n\n508\n00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.218\nSo we're gonna have all sorts of\nmonitoring status capabilities in here.\n\n509\n00:23:53.218 --> 00:23:53.816\nWe'll delve in.\nWe'll be\n\n510\n00:23:53.816 --> 00:23:58.550\ntaking a look at this along with taking a\nlook at log files, seeing where logs are.\n\n511\n00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.058\nLogs are gonna be very crucial\nto our ability to be successful.\n\n512\n00:24:01.058 --> 00:24:03.844\nIn not only using this product,\nbut troubleshooting it.\n\n513\n00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:06.772\nWe can also take a look at\nPowerShell a little bit,\n\n514\n00:24:06.772 --> 00:24:10.840\nshow you what's going on in PowerShell,\nhow to interact with it.\n\n515\n00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.890\nWe're not gonna spend\na lot of time in there.\n\n516\n00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:17.170\nBut for instance, we will, we want to just\nzoom in quickly to show you one thing,\n\n517\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:17.870\nnot the blue screen.\n\n518\n00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.450\nWe're gonna show you\nsomething more important.\n\n519\n00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.045\nJust scroll up towards the top there.\n\n520\n00:24:21.045 --> 00:24:24.690\nJust give me one second and\nwe'll do that, there we go.\n\n521\n00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.770\nWe're gonna take a look at\nhow to use PowerShell, and,\n\n522\n00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.050\nif I zoom it a little more,\nyou could probably see that.\n\n523\n00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.750\nWe're gonna take a look\nat how to use PowerShell.\n\n524\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.690\nIf you just load PowerShell directly,\nwhere do we have to go?\n\n525\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:36.490\nWhat's our path?\n\n526\n00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:40.790\nAnd you can see, as I scroll across there,\nTo be able to bring in the configuration\n\n527\n00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:45.025\nmanager PowerShell module to be able\nto support and use config manager.\n\n528\n00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:49.020\nWe'll take a look at that and\nwhat that psd module actually does for us.\n\n529\n00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.890\nWe're also gonna take\na look at if we are using,\n\n530\n00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.520\nnot just PowerShell, but if we are going\nto be able to want to take a look at\n\n531\n00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.660\nlog files we're gonna want to be\nable use a tool called CM Trace.\n\n532\n00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.340\nAnd so we're gonna go in and we're\ngonna talk to you a little bit in one\n\n533\n00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.460\nof the upcoming episodes about this\ntool and what we can do with it.\n\n534\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.430\nIt's the established and\nkind of authoritative tool that we use for\n\n535\n00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.670\nbeing able to use log files and\ninteract with them.\n\n536\n00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.410\nAnd you can see Configuration Manager\nLog Trace Tool, be able to go in,\n\n537\n00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.500\nopen up a log.\n\n538\n00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.270\nAnd take a look at,\nthere's tools like the Swiss Army Knife.\n\n539\n00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:27.430\nVlog readers, I actually use it for\nnon-SECM logs,\n\n540\n00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.500\nI use it outside for a bunch of stuff.\n\n541\n00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.780\nIt's so powerful that we can use it for\nalmost anything.\n\n542\n00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.790\nIt's been around for some time.\n\n543\n00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.810\nIt's part of the toolkit so\n\n544\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.670\nit's definitely something that we're\ngonna wanna just spend a little time on.\n\n545\n00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.010\nWe're also gonna take\nyou in at some point and\n\n546\n00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.700\nwe're gonna show you what's\ngoing on with SQL Server.\n\n547\n00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.240\nAnd as I scroll over and\njust move up here real quickly.\n\n548\n00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.620\nAnd I'll zoom in so we can see.\n\n549\n00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.870\nYou can see that I am in the SQL Server\nmanagement studio, we are using,\n\n550\n00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.095\nas you can see there, SQL Server 2012.\n\n551\n00:25:56.095 --> 00:26:00.585\nAnd I've just taken a quick view of\nthe databases that are in there.\n\n552\n00:26:00.585 --> 00:26:04.055\nWe do have some Operations Manager\ndatabases, Report Server databases,\n\n553\n00:26:04.055 --> 00:26:04.885\nOrchestrator.\n\n554\n00:26:04.885 --> 00:26:08.025\nAs I said, we're using multiple\nproducts from the System Center Suite.\n\n555\n00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:10.415\nBut we're here to talk about and\nfocus on SCCM.\n\n556\n00:26:10.415 --> 00:26:14.975\nYou can see I've highlighted\nthe CM_ database, the last three\n\n557\n00:26:14.975 --> 00:26:19.910\nalphanumeric characters, in this case PLB,\nare gonna be the site code for\n\n558\n00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.550\nSystem Center Config Manager,\nwhatever the database underscore\n\n559\n00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.560\nend of that sentence or end of that\nstatement is is always your site code.\n\n560\n00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.280\nSo in this case, our site code is PLB.\n\n561\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.010\nThe site code is a three digit\nalpha numeric identifier\n\n562\n00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.100\nunique to the site installation.\n\n563\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.920\nHas to be specified\nwhen we do the install.\n\n564\n00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.370\nWe'll look at that in a future\nepisode when do the install demo.\n\n565\n00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.450\nAnd once you set that up,\ngood news is it's there forever.\n\n566\n00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.160\nBad news is it's there forever.\n\n567\n00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:44.830\n>> Can't change it.\n\n568\n00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.383\n>> Only way to change that is to\nblow it out and start from scratch.\n\n569\n00:26:47.383 --> 00:26:50.371\nRemember, blowing it out and\nstarting from scratch is not so simple.\n\n570\n00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:53.030\nBecause we integrate into\nthe active directory.\n\n571\n00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.770\nAnd so it's just not a matter of just\nblowing out what we've done with\n\n572\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.700\nSystem Center.\n\n573\n00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.400\nWe have to go out and\n\n574\n00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.200\nremove the System Center Config container\nin order to be able to do that.\n\n575\n00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.690\nWhat I'm gonna quickly show you\nby just way of wrapping up here.\n\n576\n00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.890\nI'm gonna move to our\nother machine real quick.\n\n577\n00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.039\nWe've got a domain controller\nwe set up as well.\n\n578\n00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.520\nSo I'm just going to zoom in for\n\n579\n00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.444\nus on the Active Directory User and\nComputer manager.\n\n580\n00:27:14.444 --> 00:27:15.685\nI have that opened up here.\n\n581\n00:27:15.685 --> 00:27:19.750\nAs you can see, we've got that set\nup our practicelabs.com domain.\n\n582\n00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.260\nI've set up the advanced features view.\n\n583\n00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.870\nSo I've gone to the view menu\nchosen advanced features so\n\n584\n00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.780\nwe can see all of the system\ncontainers in here.\n\n585\n00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.590\nAnd as I scroll down you'll\nsee I have a system container.\n\n586\n00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.540\nAnd I have [COUGH]\nSystem Management right there.\n\n587\n00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.650\nAnd as I move over inside\nthe System Management container,\n\n588\n00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.460\nyou'll see that I have some\ninformation that's been set up and\n\n589\n00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.030\nconfigured in there,\nincluding a reference to my site code.\n\n590\n00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:47.170\nWhen I talk about having to get rid of not\njust on installing Config Manager, but\n\n591\n00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.750\npotentially coming in here and\ndealing with this.\n\n592\n00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.280\nHaving to reset the site codes\na little complicating cuz it involves\n\n593\n00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.210\nseveral things.\n\n594\n00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.050\nSo we're gonna talk about how to set this\ncontainer up because it's not created\n\n595\n00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:56.630\nby default.\n\n596\n00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.250\nAs a matter of fact it's\npart of the installation for\n\n597\n00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.750\nSystem Center Confiq Manager.\n\n598\n00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.400\nWe'll do this in our future\nwalk through in the demo.\n\n599\n00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.990\nWe're gonna have to go in and\nactually use ADSI Edit.\n\n600\n00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.020\nWhich is the actual directory\nservice editing tool.\n\n601\n00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.430\nWe need farce level admin rights,\nenterprise admin rights to use that.\n\n602\n00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:16.230\nWe're going to use ADSI edit to create\nthe System Management container that I\n\n603\n00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.120\njust showed you.\n\n604\n00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.880\nWe have to manually create that for\n\n605\n00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.910\nSystem Center Config Management to be\nable to write these items in there.\n\n606\n00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.280\nCreate them during the install.\n\n607\n00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.390\nWe're going to show you how to do that.\n\n608\n00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.150\nMake sure that's part of our checklist for\ninstalling.\n\n609\n00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.370\nWe'll talk through all\nthose things as we go.\n\n610\n00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.540\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n611\n00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.820\nWell, Adam I tell you what,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n612\n00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.820\nI don't know about you guys and\ngals out there, I'm getting excited.\n\n613\n00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.390\nLooking at that console you\njust see the potential.\n\n614\n00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.560\nA lot of the things that we\nalready do on our network,\n\n615\n00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.120\nmaybe we're running deployment services or\nWSUS, and things like that.\n\n616\n00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.470\nWe can see where we can\nstart tying that in and\n\n617\n00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.090\ngetting it under one\ninterface is fantastic.\n\n618\n00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.670\nInstead of having so\nmany different consoles to go through.\n\n619\n00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:52.780\nAnd then, of course, it's got so\n\n620\n00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.200\nmany more capabilities that I\ncan't wait to for you to show us.\n\n621\n00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.960\nSo, again excited.\n\n622\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.890\nHope you guys are too.\n\n623\n00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.450\nThat's gonna do it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n624\n00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.440\nHope you enjoyed it.\n\n625\n00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.160\nRemember if you wanna attend\none of Adam's classes live\n\n626\n00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.980\nshoot us an email here\nat SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n627\n00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.940\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n628\n00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.560\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n629\n00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.278\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n630\n00:29:12.278 --> 00:29:17.610\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.390\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.350\nToday, we're doing our System Center\nConfiguration Manager 2012 R2.\n\n5\n00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.640\nAnd in this episode,\nwe're gonna take a look at, and\n\n6\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.890\nkind of do an overview of\nthe architecture involved when\n\n7\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.170\nwe're running\nSystem Center Configuration Manager.\n\n8\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.510\nIt can be from a very simple one or\ntwo server solution to something\n\n9\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.030\nvery complex that stretches across\nmultiple sites, geographic boundaries.\n\n10\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.250\nIt has multiple servers involved with it.\n\n11\n00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.600\nIt can be pretty complex.\n\n12\n00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.800\nSo here to help us make sense\nof all that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.800\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.430\n>> Good, good.\nSo\n\n15\n00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.750\nthe theme is making me\nincredibly simple complex.\n\n16\n00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.940\nThat's what we're gonna go with.\n\n17\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.310\n>> Microsoft is good at that.\n\n18\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.150\n>> They are.\n\n19\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.600\nWe shouldn't say those things though.\n\n20\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.310\nThat's not nice.\n\n21\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.690\nSo we are gonna try to make\nthe incredibly complex simple.\n\n22\n00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.282\nI was only kidding around about\nmaking the simple complex.\n\n23\n00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:04.852\nIt brings up an interesting point for us\nwhich is that when we start talking about\n\n24\n00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:08.620\nthis technology, we can easily\nget lost in the details, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.840\nAnd we can easily get so\nconsumed with the nitty gritty or\n\n26\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.542\nthe off in the corner what I\ncall purple squirrels right.\n\n27\n00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:20.410\nChasing those things that don't really\neither exist or are not very important to\n\n28\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.550\nus that we can spend a lot of time\nfocusing on things that may or\n\n29\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.120\nmay not be super critical.\n\n30\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.240\nSo what we're gonna try to do is stay\nfocused on things that are gonna be\n\n31\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.320\nimportant for us.\n\n32\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.390\nWe're gonna take a look at some things\nthat will help us to understand that,\n\n33\n00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.460\ntake a look at some diagrams, talk about\nsome lists of various configuration items,\n\n34\n00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.770\nfeatures, solutions.\n\n35\n00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.920\nWhatever it may be.\n\n36\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.430\nAnd along the way,\n\n37\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.410\nwe'll try to make sure we point out things\nthat are gonna be critical for you.\n\n38\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.740\nNot only to better understand this\nproduct, but also to really understand\n\n39\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.110\nthe proper way to get it set up, to get it\ndeployed, to be successful, if you will.\n\n40\n00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.629\nBecause there's a right way and\nwrong way to do almost everything.\n\n41\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.755\nMore often than not while we look for\nguidance and\n\n42\n00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:01.780\nwanna try to figure out the best path\nforward and the path of least resistance.\n\n43\n00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.980\nI'm trying to use every\ncontrite acronym and\n\n44\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.710\nthought process and\nsaying that I can come up with here.\n\n45\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.440\nWhen we do think about these things,\nwhat we wanna think about is the fact that\n\n46\n00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.770\nwhile there's a lot of guidance out there,\nand a lot of it is very good by the way\n\n47\n00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.890\nabout things that you can do, you should\ndo, you may or you may not wanna do.\n\n48\n00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.970\nWhat we often miss when\nwe read that guidance and\n\n49\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.550\nwhen we look for those best practices is,\nhow does that translate to me?\n\n50\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.495\nRight, how does that\ntranslate to my world?\n\n51\n00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:29.875\nHow does that in my world make sense?\n\n52\n00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:34.295\nAm I the person who has that small,\nmedium, or large infrastructure?\n\n53\n00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:37.095\nDo I have to do what so and so says?\n\n54\n00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:38.945\nCan I get away with doing\nsomething different?\n\n55\n00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:40.500\nIt's hard to know.\n\n56\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.910\nIt's hard to know,\nultimately because we may not, ourselves,\n\n57\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.200\nreally have a good understanding\nof what needs to be accomplished.\n\n58\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.800\nLet's be honest.\n\n59\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.240\nIf we did, you will need to spend as much\ntime going through in painstaking detail,\n\n60\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.520\nsome of the things you do to figure out\nhow to get things working the right way.\n\n61\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.490\nCuz you'd make better decisions up front.\n\n62\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.640\nBut because you're not always comfortable\nwith the kind of things that have to be\n\n63\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.090\ndecided on or don't realize that the\nthings that you're deciding on up front\n\n64\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.720\nwill then impact your\nability to do things later.\n\n65\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.520\nWe talked in our last episode\nabout choosing a site code and\n\n66\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.730\nthe fact that if you choose poorly,\nyou have to effectively step back and\n\n67\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.830\nredo the installation from scratch.\n\n68\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.620\nBecause that site code can't be changed.\n\n69\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.990\nYou may or may not know that about SCCM,\nand you may not realize that.\n\n70\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.860\nBut during the install,\nyou're gonna have to know that.\n\n71\n00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.630\nYou're gonna have to decide\nwhere you're gonna put SCCM,\n\n72\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.160\nhow you're gonna set it up,\nhow it's gonna be architected.\n\n73\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.230\nFor instance, one of the things\nthat has changed recently\n\n74\n00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.016\nfrom 2012 to 2012 SP1 to now 2012 R-2.\n\n75\n00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:37.235\nS-P-1 post.\n\n76\n00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:41.870\nNow S-P-1 2012 R-2 effectively is.\n\n77\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.580\nWhen 2012 first came out,\nwhen you set up a primary site,\n\n78\n00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.960\nwe're gonna start talking about what\nthese terms mean as we get going here.\n\n79\n00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.270\nBut when you setup a primary site and\ninstalled SCCM, you made that choice, and\n\n80\n00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.850\nthat was basically it.\n\n81\n00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.530\nIf you decided to set up a primary\nsite as a standalone option,\n\n82\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.740\neffectively on its own.\n\n83\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.620\nWithout a [COUGH] central admin server\nand/or a hierarchy associated with it,\n\n84\n00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.260\nyou had no option to go back and\nadd that to a hierarchy at that point.\n\n85\n00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.730\nWhen 2012 first came out,\nthat was the way it was.\n\n86\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.160\nIt's very similar to what we saw in 2007\nand the earlier versions of the product.\n\n87\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.843\nIn 2012 post SP1 and 2012 R2, we now have\nthe option to start out as a stand alone\n\n88\n00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:23.780\nbut then build a hierarchy around that\nstandalone primary server as things\n\n89\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.340\ndevelop and we change our mind and\nperhaps grow the infrastructure over time.\n\n90\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.830\nAnd so\nwe are changing the way things work,\n\n91\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.270\nin some cases literally version\nto version, release to release.\n\n92\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.420\nAnd we have to keep up with that.\n\n93\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.900\nWe have to understand that,\nas SECM admins, as architects,\n\n94\n00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.106\nas professionals that are potentially\nlooking to use this product.\n\n95\n00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:45.110\nBecause if we're not familiar\nwith some of those subtleties and\n\n96\n00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.340\nsome of those things that potentially can\nbe very valuable if we understand them but\n\n97\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.950\ncan be very troubling if we don't.\n\n98\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.032\nWe may make bad decisions, and there is\nsuch a thing as a bad decision right?\n\n99\n00:04:56.032 --> 00:04:57.038\nWe wanna be nice to people and say,\n\n100\n00:04:57.038 --> 00:04:58.931\noh it's okay you didn't make\na bad decision, we'll fix that.\n\n101\n00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.312\nWrong, right?\n\n102\n00:05:00.312 --> 00:05:02.020\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> You make a bad decision.\n\n103\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.260\nWe've go work to do.\n\n104\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.100\nIt's a problem.\n\n105\n00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.040\nYou should figure it out up front.\n\n106\n00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.110\nAnd so the reality is being\nsuccessful with this product is 90%,\n\n107\n00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.610\nas it is in most cases with\nalmost any IT solution, 90%.\n\n108\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.440\nPlanning and doing due diligence and\nexercising due care.\n\n109\n00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.630\nWe'll borrow a couple of terms\nfrom our CISSP conversations.\n\n110\n00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.490\nMike's heard me say that so many times\nover our time together doing the other\n\n111\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.340\ndiscussions at CISSP,\nhe's probably sick of hearing those terms.\n\n112\n00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.030\nBut due care and due diligence,\nvery important thought processes for\n\n113\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.550\nan IT administrator, an IT architect,\n\n114\n00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.120\nan IT professional looking to use SSCM or\nany product, I don't care what it is.\n\n115\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.980\nYou're just opening an Internet Explorer.\n\n116\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.380\nYou're gonna go Google something.\n\n117\n00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.130\nPrior planning, understanding what it is\nyou're looking to accomplish, making sure\n\n118\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.620\nyou have it clear in your mind, knowing\nwhat is going to be a good to know, right.\n\n119\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.970\nHaving the things you need to have\nclear in your head is gonna always be\n\n120\n00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.510\na good way to be successful.\n\n121\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.790\nAnd so planning is gonna be\nthe baseline for everything we do.\n\n122\n00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.540\nPlanning when it comes to SCCM, especially\nin 2012 is going to be very important for\n\n123\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.320\nus to make sure that we are focused on.\n\n124\n00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.950\nI have to click in our live lab\nenvironment every so often and\n\n125\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.560\nmake sure that the lab stays active and\nit knows we're paying attention to it.\n\n126\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.390\nIt gets a little lonely.\n\n127\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.980\nWanna make sure we're\npaying attention to it.\n\n128\n00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.190\nMake sure it knows we're here.\n\n129\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.420\nIt's okay.\nNice lap computer,\n\n130\n00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.400\nnice lap computer, right?\n\n131\n00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.756\nYou're not alone.\n\n132\n00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.360\nSo we wanna make sure\nthat we understand that\n\n133\n00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.570\nplanning is gonna be one of\nthe critical keys to success.\n\n134\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.030\nSo let's begin our\njourney towards planning,\n\n135\n00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.280\ntowards understanding better what this\nproduct is and is not capable of doing,\n\n136\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.180\nby talking at a high level about what\nconfiguration manager really is all about.\n\n137\n00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.480\nWe have the ability to break\nConfiguration Manager in,\n\n138\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.070\nlet's just say into buckets or into areas\nof functionality that we can think.\n\n139\n00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.460\nAnd at a high level we think of asset\nmanagement, we think of change management,\n\n140\n00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.980\nwe think of administrative features and\noverviews\n\n141\n00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.595\nthat really help us to effectively silo or\ncreate buckets of functionality.\n\n142\n00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:59.605\nI demonstrated some of these for\nyou in our first episode together.\n\n143\n00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:02.445\nWhere we took a quick kind of\na walk-through the console.\n\n144\n00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:03.825\nI showed you all the workspaces.\n\n145\n00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:05.615\nExplained a little bit\nabout what's in there.\n\n146\n00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:08.305\nPreviewed some of the things we're\ngonna be talking about in more depth\n\n147\n00:07:08.305 --> 00:07:09.575\nin coming episodes.\n\n148\n00:07:09.575 --> 00:07:14.100\nBut asset management really is gonna be\nfocusing in on areas like hardware and\n\n149\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.600\nsoftware inventory,\nasset intelligence software metering.\n\n150\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.030\nThese are classically areas we\nassociate with asset management.\n\n151\n00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.750\nAnd we took a look at those in\nthe console in the asset and\n\n152\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.370\ncollection workspace is where we\nsaw the majority of that stuff.\n\n153\n00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.310\nUnder change management we would have\nthings like application and package\n\n154\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.550\ndeployment, so application and package\nmanagement, software update management,\n\n155\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.630\noperating system deployment management,\ncompliance settings, end point protection.\n\n156\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.190\nThese are all things that take\nplace under change management.\n\n157\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.050\nSome of this will be in\nadministration in the workspace.\n\n158\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.110\nSome of it would be under monitoring.\n\n159\n00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.850\nIt really just depends on what we're\ndoing and what we're looking for.\n\n160\n00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.630\nBut there's lots of different\nthings that we would look at.\n\n161\n00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.068\nIn the administrative features area,\nthings like role based administration\n\n162\n00:07:55.068 --> 00:07:57.212\nwhich we find in\nthe administrative workspace.\n\n163\n00:07:57.212 --> 00:08:00.046\nReporting and monitoring would\ntake place in these categories.\n\n164\n00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.253\nSo you want to be thinking\nabout these kinds of things.\n\n165\n00:08:02.253 --> 00:08:05.836\nUnderstanding It is the general\ncategories that we can look at from a,\n\n166\n00:08:05.836 --> 00:08:07.596\nI wouldn't say a bucket list, but\n\n167\n00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:11.530\nfrom a bucket perspective to have\na general sense of functionality.\n\n168\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.270\nWhy is this important when we plan?\n\n169\n00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.650\nIt's important because what we wanna\nunderstand is that SCCM today.\n\n170\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:23.540\nAs a product, 2012 R2 is so feature rich,\nis so capable, yeah, we explain for\n\n171\n00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.660\ninstance in the overview of the console\nthat we know integrate the WSUS and\n\n172\n00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.680\nthe WDS,\nthe Windows Deployment Service and\n\n173\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.430\nthe Windows Software Update Service\nfunctionality directly into SCCM.\n\n174\n00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.970\nWe integrate sequel reporting services to\nbe able to do business intelligence and\n\n175\n00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.130\ndata analytics.\n\n176\n00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.550\nWe integrate the capability of\ncross platform device management.\n\n177\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.680\nA remote management for\nhelp desk capabilities for\n\n178\n00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.980\ninstance can be used here.\n\n179\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.960\nWe can integrate Android, Blackberry, IOS\nbased devices, we can do SNMP discovery\n\n180\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.170\nand integrate network capable devices like\nrouters and switches for a full value.\n\n181\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.050\nAnd full picture of what our\nasset solution looks like.\n\n182\n00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.900\nWe have so many capabilities in this\nproduct today that if we're not focused on\n\n183\n00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.180\nthem and really identifying the feature\nareas that are of interest to us,\n\n184\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.970\nwe're gonna miss out on\nthings that may be valuable.\n\n185\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.628\nSo for instance, you may not be interested\nin integrating endpoint protection.\n\n186\n00:09:13.628 --> 00:09:16.090\nYou may to say, you know what,\nI don't wanna spend the time and\n\n187\n00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.677\nenergy it takes to do endpoint protection.\n\n188\n00:09:18.677 --> 00:09:21.990\nEndpoint protection running on my\nendpoints through either group policy as\n\n189\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.990\nwe talked about with\nthe integration there.\n\n190\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.680\nOr I'm just already using that solution\nhowever I'm achieving it today.\n\n191\n00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.550\nYou may have a third party product\nyou're using whatever it is.\n\n192\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.160\nYou may say I'm not\ninterested in doing that.\n\n193\n00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.700\nFine.\n\n194\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.890\nThen don't spend a lot of time on that and\nlet's not worry about that.\n\n195\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.070\nLet's focus on things you have\nto be focused on that you\n\n196\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.580\neffectively want to accomplish\nwhen we're setting up so\n\n197\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.570\nwe know that that's how your gonna\neffectively proceed, right, and\n\n198\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.440\nget the product rolled out and\nset it up to be successful.\n\n199\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.200\nAnother thing you have to think\nabout is how many clients,\n\n200\n00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.250\nhow many endpoints am I gonna manage.\n\n201\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.950\nWe do have upper limits in this product.\n\n202\n00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.840\nWe can,\nthrough a system center install overall,\n\n203\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.610\nall out throughout our entire hierarchy,\nmanage 400,000 clients.\n\n204\n00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.530\nNow that seems like a very large\nnumber until you think about how\n\n205\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.690\nmany endpoints you might wanna be\nable to bring in and account for.\n\n206\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.780\nIf you're gonna bring in mobile devices\nlike tablets and phones, you're\n\n207\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.370\ngonna be not necessarily hitting 400,000,\nbut you're gonna have a lot more than just\n\n208\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.750\nyour fixed end points which are your\ndesktops and potentially your servers.\n\n209\n00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.870\nAnd so we do have to think\nabout what numbers look like.\n\n210\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:25.370\nWe can manage different numbers of\nclients on different primary servers,\n\n211\n00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.960\nand or secondary servers.\n\n212\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.560\nAnd in the overall central admin\nsolution with a hierarchy.\n\n213\n00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.970\nWe're gonna go in and take a look\nat this diagram in just a minute,\n\n214\n00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.070\nto explain all this to you,\nwe have different options.\n\n215\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.210\nSo we have to be aware of how this is all\ngonna be set up and configured, so we take\n\n216\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.320\nadvantage of those options and really\nunderstand how to scale appropriately.\n\n217\n00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.185\nWe can manage 100,000 clients on\na primary server with no trouble.\n\n218\n00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:49.635\nBut we have to also understand that if we\nintegrate the database and the database is\n\n219\n00:10:49.635 --> 00:10:53.453\nsitting on the primary server, that number\ngoes down dramatically to about 25,000.\n\n220\n00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:55.285\nAnd then we have to split that out and\n\n221\n00:10:55.285 --> 00:10:58.875\nput the database somewhere else to get\nthe economy scale and the performance.\n\n222\n00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:00.915\nSo we have to understand the do's and\ndon't's here.\n\n223\n00:11:00.915 --> 00:11:04.675\nAnd again, a lot of this guidance is\navailable outside of our discussions here.\n\n224\n00:11:04.675 --> 00:11:06.675\nThere are deployment documents,\nthere's how to's,\n\n225\n00:11:06.675 --> 00:11:10.360\nthere's all sorts of stuff out there\nthat you can look at to figure this out.\n\n226\n00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.840\nBut let's be honest are you gonna,\nnumber one, be able to spend the time and\n\n227\n00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.760\nenergy it takes to read through\neverything and make educated decisions.\n\n228\n00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.800\nAnd I'm not suggesting for\na minute you can't.\n\n229\n00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.200\nI'm simply pointing out that it may not\nbe the best use of your time, right?\n\n230\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.530\nBecause what you wanna do is figure out\nhow to get to that golden solution, right?\n\n231\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.300\nThe place you wanna be with the least\namount of time and effort, but\n\n232\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.860\nwith the understanding and assurance\nthat you've made the right decisions.\n\n233\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.930\nSo that's why spending time with somebody\nlike us, myself and Mike, helping\n\n234\n00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.710\nyou to walk through this material helping\nyou to have a better understanding of it.\n\n235\n00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.320\nCan be incredibly valuable for you because\nit streamlines the process of making those\n\n236\n00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.290\ndecisions and making the right ones.\n\n237\n00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.931\nAt least when I'm talking,\nnot so much when he is.\n\n238\n00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:49.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But when I'm talking, good stuff.\n\n239\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.980\nSo let's focus on that.\n\n240\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.790\nSo let's talk about not only new features,\n\n241\n00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.040\nlet's talk first of all about some\nof the architecture discussion.\n\n242\n00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.180\nSo, maybe we can go in quickly throw\nup some of the diagrams Mike has on\n\n243\n00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.070\nhis machine.\n\n244\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.980\nWe've taken the trouble,\nI shouldn't say we,\n\n245\n00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.620\ncuz this is all Mike, Mike's done\nthe artistic renderings for us.\n\n246\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.270\nSo anything you like,\nabsolutely thank Mike for that.\n\n247\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.400\nAnything you hate, also thank Mike for\nthat because he's totally in charge of\n\n248\n00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.080\ngraphics on this particular little\ntour that we're taking here.\n\n249\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.710\nSo, what we wanna do is go ahead and\nwe wanna take a look,\n\n250\n00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.380\nmaybe we can zoom in for just a second and\nsee what's going on up there.\n\n251\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.220\nSo while Mike's doing that,\nlet me just set the stage for\n\n252\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.480\nwhat we're gonna look at here.\n\n253\n00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.650\nWhat we have, are gonna show you, what we\nare about to show you, as Mike zooms in\n\n254\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.170\nand we may have to, yeah, Mike will\njust kinda scroll us over a little bit,\n\n255\n00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:37.010\nis what a enterprise deployment is gonna\nlook like from a hierarchy perspective,\n\n256\n00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.160\nmeaning not just a single site server\ntraditionally called a primary site\n\n257\n00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.050\nserver, but we're gonna add in what's\ncalled the CAS or Central Admin Server.\n\n258\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.720\nWe're also gonna have a secondary or\nchild site server down below.\n\n259\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.610\nSo, we're gonna talk about all three\nof these, define what they are.\n\n260\n00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.150\nWe have some bulleted items will go to on\na word document and in a list separately\n\n261\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.810\nto kind of give you the highlights of what\neach one of these servers is gonna do,\n\n262\n00:12:58.810 --> 00:12:59.940\nwhat they represent.\n\n263\n00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.220\nSo I want you to just for\nthe moment kind of focus on the graphic.\n\n264\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.630\nFocus on the discussion.\n\n265\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.930\nAbsorb the information.\n\n266\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:06.790\nAnd then we'll go through.\n\n267\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.510\nAnd we'll make sure you could\nsee it in list form and\n\n268\n00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.900\nkind of summarize those thought processes.\n\n269\n00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.160\nWhen we think about doing the deployment\nfor SCCM, the way we start out.\n\n270\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.940\nAnd we will see this in a future episode\nwhen we do our deployment walk through.\n\n271\n00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.950\nIs we're gonna be asked some questions.\n\n272\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.020\nHey, what do you wanna do effectively?\n\n273\n00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.940\nAnd what are you looking to accomplish.\n\n274\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.300\nAnd what we often do is\nwe set up initially,\n\n275\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.870\nwe set up our primary site server.\n\n276\n00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.830\nSo in the middle there, in the middle\ntier we see two primary site servers.\n\n277\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.320\nOne on the left, one on the right.\n\n278\n00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.940\nMike's kind of zooming in,\nwe can see that.\n\n279\n00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.360\nThat's good,\nyeah that'll be good right there.\n\n280\n00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.120\nAnd we can see that that Primary Site\nserver, and let's ignore the arrows for\n\n281\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.240\na minute, let's not worry about\nwhat's going on around it.\n\n282\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.360\nJust focus on the Primary Site server and\nthe SQL Database off to the side.\n\n283\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.205\nWhat we can see is that that\nPrimary Site server is gonna have\n\n284\n00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.150\na database associated with it.\n\n285\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.941\nI quickly went in when we did\nthe walk-through on the console and\n\n286\n00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:56.864\nshowed you what a SQL\ndatabase looked like.\n\n287\n00:13:56.864 --> 00:13:59.340\nUsing SQL 2008 R2 for instance.\n\n288\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:05.060\nUsing SQL 12, could be using SQL 14,\neventually we'll support SQL 16.\n\n289\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.100\nIt's gonna be coming out at some\npoint along with Server 16,\n\n290\n00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.060\nand obviously as products rev over time,\nwe see additional support.\n\n291\n00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.640\nBut currently, we certainly support\n2008 R2, support 12, support 14.\n\n292\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.849\nSo we can see a SQL\ndatabase running there.\n\n293\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.360\nIf that database is integrated onto the\nprimary site server, meaning it's running\n\n294\n00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.530\non the primary site server locally\nalongside System Center Config Manager,\n\n295\n00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.770\nas I said, that's perfectly fine for\nsmall installations.\n\n296\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.690\nBut when we start scaling\nup past a certain number of\n\n297\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.820\nend points that we want to manage,\nwe're gonna wanna break that database out,\n\n298\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.000\nput it on its own server somewhere else.\n\n299\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.490\nWe may cluster that.\n\n300\n00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.940\nWe may virtualize that,\nthere's lot of options.\n\n301\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.070\nAgain, we have a menu of choices,\n\n302\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.060\nit depends on what we're\nlooking to accomplish.\n\n303\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.080\nNormally, we associate a primary site\nserver with a SQL database in a one to one\n\n304\n00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.100\nrelationship.\n\n305\n00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.610\nIf you have two primary site servers, you\nwill notice, and Mike did the right thing\n\n306\n00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.690\nin the graphic here, we have a SQL\ndatabase associated with each.\n\n307\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.660\nThat's normally a separate SQL database.\n\n308\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.650\nAs in a separate install.\n\n309\n00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:09.100\nHowever, we do have the option if\nwe cluster this to be able to run\n\n310\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.940\nmultiple primary site servers against\na common clustered database solution.\n\n311\n00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.140\nWe have to have individual instances for\nthe site IDs for\n\n312\n00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:23.000\nthe configuration manage your databases,\nassociated within that SQL server.\n\n313\n00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.010\nSo we can do that through multiple\ninstalls, but we can actually host\n\n314\n00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.290\non multiple primary site against a single\ncommon backend on the SQL server side.\n\n315\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.280\nThis is again relatively new in 12 and\n12R2.\n\n316\n00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.380\nSpecifically in 12R2 post\nSP1 that we can do this.\n\n317\n00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.270\nSo, we have a lot of options.\n\n318\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.930\nAnd it can be very confusing if we're\nnot really sure what we're doing.\n\n319\n00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.860\nYou know scaling the infrastructure to\nfigure that out can also be challenging.\n\n320\n00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.350\nWe may already have existing SQL installs,\nwe may have them virtualized,\n\n321\n00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.600\nwe may have them clustered.\n\n322\n00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.660\nWe have to think about that.\n\n323\n00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.121\nAnd we may not by the way as IT admins\nwho are gonna be charged with doing SCCM,\n\n324\n00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.795\nwe may not be the DBA's\nin the organization.\n\n325\n00:15:57.795 --> 00:16:00.823\nWe may not be those database\nadministrators who have an understanding\n\n326\n00:16:00.823 --> 00:16:03.296\nof the SQL architecture and\nwhat it's capable of doing.\n\n327\n00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:07.054\nSo we're gonna have to partner and we're\ngonna have to work with other people that\n\n328\n00:16:07.054 --> 00:16:11.170\nhelp us to get this product stood up and\nunderstand how to initially configure it.\n\n329\n00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.980\nWe may not have rights\nto the active directory.\n\n330\n00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.170\nWe may not have rights to be\nable to extend the schema.\n\n331\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.200\nTo do the install for the Primary Site.\n\n332\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.400\nAgain, we'll see this and\n\n333\n00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.850\nhighlight this when we do our\nwalk-through on the installation.\n\n334\n00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.660\nBut the idea would be that there we may\nneed to partner with whoever controls\n\n335\n00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.820\nthe directory service.\n\n336\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.740\nMaybe the security group,\nmaybe the AD admin group,\n\n337\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.220\ndepending on the organization.\n\n338\n00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.310\nYou may be an army of one.\n\n339\n00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.100\nIt may be you and\nyou may do everything, or\n\n340\n00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.270\nyou may have other groups do other things.\n\n341\n00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:41.170\nSo we have to think about this and really\nunderstand not only the roles we need,\n\n342\n00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.010\nbut the team members that we may need\nto fill those roles or the slots for\n\n343\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.110\nus to get us access to the technology and\nthe infrastructure that we need.\n\n344\n00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.930\nIf we're going to virtualize, then we\nhave to bring in the virtualization team.\n\n345\n00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.550\nAnd have them help us understand\nwhat our capabilities and\n\n346\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.990\nwhat our resources will be.\n\n347\n00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.830\nSo these are all things\nwe have to consider.\n\n348\n00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.730\nSo the Primary Site is gonna be\nthe first machine that we install,\n\n349\n00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.980\nthe first site server we install, an SCCM.\n\n350\n00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.340\nThat site server, along with its database\nis going to form the focal point for\n\n351\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.300\nall activity.\n\n352\n00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.690\nWhen I walked you through\nthe console on my demo and\n\n353\n00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.460\nwe took a look at the site server and\ntook a look at all the work spaces,\n\n354\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.070\nwe were looking at a Primary Site\nserver just to be clear.\n\n355\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.320\nYou'd have no way of knowing that\nwhen we were looking at that,\n\n356\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.260\nbecause I didn't show you where it was and\nidentify what it was, but\n\n357\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.000\nit was the consoles that's associated\nwith the Primary Site server.\n\n358\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.210\nNow we could be perfectly happy and\nbe very,\n\n359\n00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.090\nvery excited about running a single\nPrimary Site server installation\n\n360\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.930\nif we have only several thousand n points,\nno trouble at all.\n\n361\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.460\nNever have to bother ourselves with either\nthe thing at the top of the pyramid up\n\n362\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.250\nthere, the central admin site, and/or the\nlower left hand corner, the child item,\n\n363\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.040\nwhich is the secondary site.\n\n364\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.420\nBut let's, since we're already down,\nlet's talk about the Secondary Site,\n\n365\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.290\nthen we'll make our way back\nup to the primary site.\n\n366\n00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:51.051\nSo the secondary site, what that's gonna\nallow us to do is effectively allow us to\n\n367\n00:17:51.051 --> 00:17:53.430\nbe able to achieve two things.\n\n368\n00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.180\nBandwidth management in low bandwidth\nsituations for remote sites.\n\n369\n00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.670\nWe're gonna put a secondary site server\nin, which is gonna have a management point\n\n370\n00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.290\nassociated with it, perhaps a distribution\npoint role associated with it.\n\n371\n00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.290\nThat's gonna allow us to effectively\ncontrol what clients are doing at\n\n372\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.227\nthat site, so they can talk to the\nsecondary site server to get instructions.\n\n373\n00:18:12.227 --> 00:18:16.030\nIn a, effectively,\na local fashion across the LAN.\n\n374\n00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.310\nAs opposed to having to go across the WAM\nconnection, which is probably slow and\n\n375\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.960\nunreliable back up to the Primary Site.\n\n376\n00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.060\nSo the primary reason to deploy\na Secondary Site in the architecture is\n\n377\n00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.180\nbecause of bandwidth considerations.\n\n378\n00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.700\nBecause if we do that we can then control\ndistribution of packages and applications.\n\n379\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.680\nWe can control distribution\nof policy updates.\n\n380\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.199\nWe can control hardware inventory,\n\n381\n00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.164\nsoftware inventory information and\nall that.\n\n382\n00:18:38.164 --> 00:18:42.819\nBecause all we're doing is effectively\nasking the Secondary Site server to talk\n\n383\n00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:44.467\nto the Primary Site server.\n\n384\n00:18:44.467 --> 00:18:48.392\nAnd as a result of that connection and\nthat communication being controlled and\n\n385\n00:18:48.392 --> 00:18:51.360\nbeing optimized,\nwe have a one to one communication.\n\n386\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.290\nInstead of several hundred clients sitting\ndown there trying to communicate back up\n\n387\n00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.220\nto the primary server over a slow and\nunreliable connection.\n\n388\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.550\nSo that's gonna be the key there.\n\n389\n00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.469\nSo we wanna make sure\nthat we're aware of that.\n\n390\n00:19:02.469 --> 00:19:05.990\nWe also want to take note of the fact that\nthe Secondary Site has its own data base.\n\n391\n00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.770\nAnd that's kinda interesting\nas well because in 12 R2,\n\n392\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:13.520\nSCCM 12 R2, we now see that the Secondary\nSite has its own data base locally.\n\n393\n00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.600\nAgain, so it could store information,\nmanage certain things.\n\n394\n00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.100\nWhereas, in prior versions,\n\n395\n00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.035\nthe Secondary Site most likely did not\nnecessarily have its own data base.\n\n396\n00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:24.070\nSo that is, again, something to consider.\n\n397\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.480\nOur Secondary sites are going to be\nin an parent-child relationship,\n\n398\n00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.640\nthey can only be related\nto a Primary Site.\n\n399\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.360\nThey cannot exist on their own and\n\n400\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.910\nthey cannot exist unless there is\na Primary Site to link them to.\n\n401\n00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.070\nSo we wanna make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n402\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.670\nWe set that up during the installation\nwhen we run the installation media and\n\n403\n00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.210\nchoose what option we want.\n\n404\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.970\nWe'll have an option for a Primary Site.\n\n405\n00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.470\nWe do that install first.\n\n406\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.260\nThe only way we can do a Secondary Site\nin the install media is\n\n407\n00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.310\nif there's already\na Primary Site available.\n\n408\n00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.580\nWe can reference that site code,\n\n409\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.150\nand then we know we can then\nsee that Primary Site is there.\n\n410\n00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.639\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n411\n00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.850\nWe can SQL Server Express and/or\na SQL Database to store the configuration\n\n412\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.610\ninformation.\n\n413\n00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.510\nSo that SQL Database sitting down\nthere could be a SQL Express,\n\n414\n00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:08.550\nor your local version of SQL installed\nthere that's gonna be available to us.\n\n415\n00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.430\nWe replicate our collective client data\nback up across that two way arrow,\n\n416\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.630\nthat bidirectional arrow that\nMike's represented there for\n\n417\n00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:19.000\nus to drive communication, again,\nbetween the Secondary Site server and\n\n418\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.710\nthe Primary Site server.\n\n419\n00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.356\nSo the clients that are local to\nthat Secondary Site that are gonna\n\n420\n00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:28.462\nbe in that V land or in that site\nboundary, or whatever it may be, are gonna\n\n421\n00:20:28.462 --> 00:20:33.420\nbe communicating with the Primary Site\nserver through the secondary site server.\n\n422\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.580\nThey're not gonna be communicating\ndirectly up, so just be aware of that.\n\n423\n00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.140\nWe do not support client assignments,\n\n424\n00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.520\nas clients are assigned\ndirectly to the Primary Site.\n\n425\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.370\nBut the Secondary Site is\ngoing to effectively proxy and\n\n426\n00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.310\nmanage on behalf of the primary site\nbecause of the bandwidth issues.\n\n427\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.210\nSo we do just wanna be aware of that.\n\n428\n00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.557\nWe can house the majority\nof our site server roles,\n\n429\n00:20:51.557 --> 00:20:55.305\nand we'll talk about what these roles are\nin our conversation as we continue here.\n\n430\n00:20:55.305 --> 00:20:58.420\nBut can host the majority of those\nroles at the secondary site server\n\n431\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:58.930\nif we need to.\n\n432\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.990\nSo it's a very flexible option for\nus, right?\n\n433\n00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.890\nAs we talked about, the Primary Site\nis going to be the kind of\n\n434\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:05.450\nthe focal point of all that information.\n\n435\n00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.980\nWe're going to manage clients there.\n\n436\n00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.670\nWe have the SQL data base there.\n\n437\n00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.080\nYou'll notice the Primary Site,\n\n438\n00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.010\nif we scroll up just a little towards\nthe central admin site, has a parent-child\n\n439\n00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:19.010\nrelationship going on with this thing at\nthe top called the Central Admin Site.\n\n440\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.915\nSo a Primary Site is\nusually gonna be the parent\n\n441\n00:21:21.915 --> 00:21:23.965\nin the sense that it's gonna\nbe the primary server.\n\n442\n00:21:23.965 --> 00:21:27.745\nIt may have one or more secondary\nsites' children associated with it, but\n\n443\n00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:32.315\nit can also be, the primary site can be,\na child of a central admin site.\n\n444\n00:21:32.315 --> 00:21:35.385\nSo, effectively,\nit can be both a parent and a child.\n\n445\n00:21:35.385 --> 00:21:40.045\nWhereas a Secondary Site can only be a\nchild and can be connected to a Secondary\n\n446\n00:21:40.045 --> 00:21:43.635\nsite can be connected to a central\nadmin site through a Primary Site.\n\n447\n00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.615\nSo there is that hierarchy relationship.\n\n448\n00:21:45.615 --> 00:21:49.260\nYou can think of it as the central admin\nsite being the parent, the primary site\n\n449\n00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.520\nbeing the child of the central admin site,\nand the parent to the secondary site.\n\n450\n00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.730\nAnd the secondary site being\na child of the primary site, and\n\n451\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.420\na grandchild of the central admin site.\n\n452\n00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.270\nIn effect when we think\nabout the hierarchy.\n\n453\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.490\nThe central admin site\nis kind of interesting.\n\n454\n00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:04.540\nThis is an all up server,\n\n455\n00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.580\nyou can see multiple primary sites\nare linked to it in Mike's diagram.\n\n456\n00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.280\nThey're coming up from both sides.\n\n457\n00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:14.080\nThey are two bi-directional arrows going\nup and linking up there as we can see.\n\n458\n00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.340\nAnd what the Central Admin Site does,\neffectively, is really provide two things,\n\n459\n00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.050\ntwo capabilities,\nadministration and reporting.\n\n460\n00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.960\nIt's the all up site that\nallows us to gather, as you can\n\n461\n00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.490\nsee through the information flows across\nthe arrows, all of the client information,\n\n462\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.840\nall the configuration information,\nall the inventory information, etc.\n\n463\n00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.000\nAll that is gathered from all of the sites\nand rolled up into, what we call the CAS,\n\n464\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.290\nor the Central Admin Site.\n\n465\n00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:42.200\nWe have to to be careful of using acronyms\nbecause CAS is also the acronym for\n\n466\n00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.920\nthe Client Access Server in Exchange.\n\n467\n00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.620\nSo we have to be careful with that\nbecause that's our front end server.\n\n468\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.310\nIn Exchange,\n\n469\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.210\nwe have to obviously be aware of the fact\nthat the acronym is primarily used there.\n\n470\n00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.310\nBut depending on the topology\nwe have deployed and\n\n471\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.295\nthe technology we use, we may actually\nsee it used in multiple places.\n\n472\n00:22:57.295 --> 00:23:02.380\nSo, the Central Admin Site here is\ngonna gather up all that information.\n\n473\n00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.070\nNotice it has its own SQL Server database,\nagain, up at the top there.\n\n474\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.230\nThat database is gonna be used to store\nthat information that's coming up so\n\n475\n00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.070\nwe can report against it and\ndo those kinda things.\n\n476\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.220\nWe don't process any client data here.\n\n477\n00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.900\nWe don't support any clients being\nassigned to the central admin site.\n\n478\n00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.020\nIt is strictly an all-up central\nvision of our hierarchy.\n\n479\n00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.880\nThat is really all that we do here.\n\n480\n00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.720\nWe have a limited number of site roles\nthat can exist in the Central Admin Site.\n\n481\n00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.600\nIt is really designed for administration\nall-up and reporting primarily.\n\n482\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.650\nThese are the key things that\nreally we see going on there.\n\n483\n00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.180\nI know that we have created some bulleted\nlists that kind of summarize all\n\n484\n00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.510\nthe points I just made.\n\n485\n00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.520\nSo maybe we'll just be able to, and we\nare gonna throw those up real quick, but\n\n486\n00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.455\nwe want the, not the site roles,\nbut actually,\n\n487\n00:23:46.455 --> 00:23:51.240\nyeah the central admins site is and to use\nthe configuration site that we have right.\n\n488\n00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.305\nSo if we can go through those and\nmaybe zoom in real quick,\n\n489\n00:23:53.305 --> 00:23:55.171\njust to show everybody what\nwe were talking about.\n\n490\n00:23:55.171 --> 00:23:58.390\nSo what we did is kinda just\ncapture the discussion we just had,\n\n491\n00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.400\nput it into a list format for you for\nthe key bullet points that we'll Summarize\n\n492\n00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.220\nwhat the key functionality is by role and\nby site here.\n\n493\n00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.153\nSo, the central admin site as you can see,\n\n494\n00:24:07.153 --> 00:24:09.893\nrequired to use if we're gonna\nhave a multi site hierarchy,\n\n495\n00:24:09.893 --> 00:24:12.960\nhave to have a central avenue\nto the site in order to do that.\n\n496\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.450\nIf we're gonna be using it we're focusing\nprimarily on administration reporting,\n\n497\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.460\nas you can see.\n\n498\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.950\nHas to have a SQL database\nassociated with it.\n\n499\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:25.310\nNo client data being processed,\nno client assignments being a home there.\n\n500\n00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.500\nClients are not gonna have a site code,\nin other words, that points to a central\n\n501\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.180\nadmin site, or rather, that site code\npoints to a primary site server.\n\n502\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.510\nSo I just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n503\n00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.290\nAnd it has a limited number of site roles,\nas we said.\n\n504\n00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:41.020\nIf we scroll down, I think we have the,\nyeah, we have the primary site there.\n\n505\n00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.330\nSo to use config manager, at least one\nprimary site, so we're gonna need and\n\n506\n00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.510\nneed to be aware of the fact that\nwe can be in a child relationship\n\n507\n00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:49.710\nwith that central admin site.\n\n508\n00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:50.950\nWe talked about that.\n\n509\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.400\nWe cannot be a child to\nanother primary site.\n\n510\n00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.170\nWe saw the two primary sites\nlateral to each other at\n\n511\n00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.070\nthe same level in the pyramid, right?\n\n512\n00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.520\nBut notice they're not connected\nto each other directly.\n\n513\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.937\nThey connect up to the central admin site,\nright, like bringing the plane in,\n\n514\n00:25:03.937 --> 00:25:04.885\nlanding right here.\n\n515\n00:25:04.885 --> 00:25:06.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Get my flashlights, right?\n\n516\n00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.950\nLeft, or that's right.\n\n517\n00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.440\nI always get those confused.\n\n518\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.198\nAnyway, so you can see that they\nare connected there, right?\n\n519\n00:25:12.198 --> 00:25:16.470\nBut, key to understand that the primary\nsite is gonna stand on its own and or\n\n520\n00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.760\nbe connected to a central admin server.\n\n521\n00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.300\nBut, or\n\n522\n00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.630\ncentral admin site through the central\nadmin server, but we do not ever link\n\n523\n00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:27.360\ntwo primary sites together except through\nthe central admin server in the hierarchy.\n\n524\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.980\nThey don't get connected directly.\n\n525\n00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.830\nSo just be aware of that, it has its\nown SQL database as you can see.\n\n526\n00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.990\nWe do replicate site data up to\nthe central admin site if we're part of\n\n527\n00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.290\na hierarchy, we support client\nassignments at the primary site.\n\n528\n00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.522\nIt's very important to know that, and we\ndo host the majority of all, actually not\n\n529\n00:25:43.522 --> 00:25:47.588\nmajority, we host all potentially of\nthe site roles at the primary site level.\n\n530\n00:25:47.588 --> 00:25:50.220\nI say the majority because I\noften think about the fact that\n\n531\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.110\nwe'll split out things like distribution\npoints and management points and\n\n532\n00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.600\nmay have more than one, so we're gonna\nreplicate those out to other systems but\n\n533\n00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.890\nthey all can be installed\non the primary site.\n\n534\n00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.000\nAnd then the secondary site\ndown below is optional,\n\n535\n00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.950\nas we said, has to be in a child\nrelationship if we use it.\n\n536\n00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.600\nRemember with the primary site,\n\n537\n00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.730\nwhich is going to be set up\nduring the install as we said.\n\n538\n00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.700\nUsed primarily when we are think\nabout controlling network bandwidth.\n\n539\n00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.750\nThat's the key driver there.\n\n540\n00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:20.210\nRemember SQL Server Express and or\na SQL Server Enterprise level database.\n\n541\n00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.160\nBy the way that SQL Server database,\n\n542\n00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.330\nthat's not the express version we can\nset up and use SQL Enterprise, right?\n\n543\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.590\nAnd that's typically\nwhat you're gonna use.\n\n544\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.810\nSo just be aware of that,\nthat we'll be using that.\n\n545\n00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.730\nWe replicated our collected client data\nup to the parents site using file-based\n\n546\n00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:35.730\nreplication.\n\n547\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.390\nWe don't support client assignments,\nas we talked about and\n\n548\n00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.990\nwe support most of the roles\nthat could be deployed.\n\n549\n00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.990\nThey're not quite all of them, but\n\n550\n00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:46.205\na lot of the sites site roles can be\ndeployed to a secondary site server.\n\n551\n00:26:46.205 --> 00:26:50.575\nSo we've laid out for you from a hierarchy\nperspective, an architecture perspective,\n\n552\n00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:52.665\nwhat a typical deployment looks like,\nright?\n\n553\n00:26:52.665 --> 00:26:55.405\nSo what we want to do\nnow is talk a little bit\n\n554\n00:26:55.405 --> 00:27:00.250\nabout not just what the key\ndriving characteristics are, and\n\n555\n00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.610\nnot just what the, hey this is\nwhat it looks like solution is.\n\n556\n00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.010\nBut we want to talk about, and\n\n557\n00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.940\nI just actually want to take\nus out to the web real quick.\n\n558\n00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.760\nI know we hadn't planned on the web for\nthis particular one right now, but\n\n559\n00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.360\nI think it's worth while here for\njust a second to do it.\n\n560\n00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.450\nIf we could go to\ntechnet.microsoft.com real quick.\n\n561\n00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.000\nSo we're gonna give Mike just a second\nto type that in cause this is not one of\n\n562\n00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.836\nthe ones that we happened to preload and\n\n563\n00:27:19.836 --> 00:27:21.940\nhave set up cause we knew\nwe were gonna go there.\n\n564\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.090\nBut I want to show you\nsomething really quickly.\n\n565\n00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.360\nSo with TechNet,\nAre you on the main TechNet site?\n\n566\n00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.160\n>> Yeah,\nit grabbed some of my history there.\n\n567\n00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.932\n>> Oh, okay, okay, cause I saw it came up,\nit looks like it's Windows 10 or KMS.\n\n568\n00:27:31.932 --> 00:27:35.890\nSo we're gonna give Mike just\na second to set that up.\n\n569\n00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:41.910\nSo while we're there let's go to, let's\ngo to library, on the left there, right.\n\n570\n00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.640\nOh no, under TechNet right there, library.\n\n571\n00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.395\nUnder tech net on the left,\nall the way over.\n\n572\n00:27:45.395 --> 00:27:46.360\n>> Mm-hm, where you at?\n\n573\n00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.270\n>> And then what wanna do is we gonna\ngo ahead and we wanna search for\n\n574\n00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:54.250\nsystem center and see if we can bring\nup system center config manager.\n\n575\n00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.810\nSo while Mike's doing that,\nwhat I'm just gonna show you or\n\n576\n00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.610\nhave him show you there we go, prefect.\n\n577\n00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.980\nTechnical documentation library,\nit's technical documentation library it's,\n\n578\n00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.950\nyeah, just get rid of that.\n\n579\n00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.160\nThat's a new thing that's been popping\nup recently, hey, was this page helpful?\n\n580\n00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.860\nIt loads right before you see the page,\nso can't even see the page\n\n581\n00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.710\n>> I don't even ask you if it's helpful.\n\n582\n00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:11.980\n>> Before they ask you they\nask you if it's helpful.\n\n583\n00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.490\nI don't know, right?\n\n584\n00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.569\nYeah.\nSo, I often feel like saying no,\n\n585\n00:28:13.569 --> 00:28:15.180\n[LAUGH] but, you know,\nit just doesn't go away, right?\n\n586\n00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.250\nIt just doesn't work that way.\n\n587\n00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.680\nSo, what we're looking at with\nthe technical documentation library here,\n\n588\n00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.430\nmaybe we can zoom in quickly just\nto show everybody what's there,\n\n589\n00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:27.980\nis the ability to be able to see\nthat we have System Center 2012,\n\n590\n00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:32.960\n2012 R2 applies to and 2012 SP1,\nright underneath the date right there.\n\n591\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.790\nIt says applies to.\n\n592\n00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.340\n>> Yep.\n>> So the documentation library applies to\n\n593\n00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.050\nall 3 versions that\nare currently in market.\n\n594\n00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.730\nWe're obviously talking about 12 R2.\n\n595\n00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.230\nYou're gonna be able to go here and\ndownload all the documentation,\n\n596\n00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.220\nthe help files, the deployment guidance,\nanything you need for\n\n597\n00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.680\nthe entire system center suite.\n\n598\n00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.390\nYou can see all the products\nthere that I mentioned, right?\n\n599\n00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.900\nWhat we're gonna do is go up and\nfocus on, no go down just a little bit,\n\n600\n00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.200\nconfig manager right there.\n\n601\n00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.159\nJust click on config manager and\nwhat we're gonna be able to see,\n\n602\n00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.280\nas soon as it comes up, takes a second\nto load, is it takes us in and\n\n603\n00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.040\nit shows us all, there it is again, it\nshows us all the technical documentation.\n\n604\n00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.550\nAnd what we're going to be able to,\nyeah, what we're gonna be able to do,\n\n605\n00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.560\nput a little note in Bill's\ninbox there that that's crap\n\n606\n00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.260\nwe don't want to see that anymore.\n\n607\n00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.170\nSo what we'll see is\nthe technical documentation and\n\n608\n00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.680\nwe can see that we have\nlinks to all sorts of stuff.\n\n609\n00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:28.020\nGetting started with SCCM 2012, site\nadministration, migrating, hierarchies,\n\n610\n00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.970\ndeploying clients, deploying software, all\nthe key things we're going to do is there.\n\n611\n00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.063\nAnd so if you're going to drill in and\nstart looking for some guidance for\n\n612\n00:29:36.063 --> 00:29:38.089\nhow to set up a hierarchy and\nwhat you need to do,\n\n613\n00:29:38.089 --> 00:29:40.590\nthis is gonna be a great place\nto go to look for some of that.\n\n614\n00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:43.650\nWe'll provide you some of these\nlinks throughout our discussions.\n\n615\n00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:44.990\nKey critical points as we go.\n\n616\n00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.980\nI know Mike's real good\nabout capturing them.\n\n617\n00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.410\nWe'll make sure that you guys\nare able to go out and find those,\n\n618\n00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.420\nif you have a desire to\ntake a look at them, okay?\n\n619\n00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.110\nSo just wanted to get\nyou familiar with that.\n\n620\n00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.790\nMake sure you guys were comfortable\nwith the general thought process there.\n\n621\n00:29:56.985 --> 00:29:59.135\nWith regards to deployment.\n\n622\n00:29:59.135 --> 00:30:01.335\nSo let's if we could go to my machine for\njust a minute.\n\n623\n00:30:01.335 --> 00:30:02.805\nI want to take a look\nin the lab environment,\n\n624\n00:30:02.805 --> 00:30:05.345\none more time, now that we've taken\na look at the hierarchy real quick.\n\n625\n00:30:05.345 --> 00:30:08.345\nI want to be able to show you something\nthat we were just talking about.\n\n626\n00:30:08.345 --> 00:30:10.835\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna zoom in here.\n\n627\n00:30:10.835 --> 00:30:13.975\nAnd give me just a second and bare\nwith me I'm gonna show you where I am.\n\n628\n00:30:13.975 --> 00:30:18.225\nYou'll see that I am over\nin site configuration, so\n\n629\n00:30:18.225 --> 00:30:20.870\nyou'll see that I'm up in\nthe administration work space.\n\n630\n00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.000\nI'm in site configuration.\n\n631\n00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.190\nWhoops, went too far.\n\n632\n00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.820\nI'm in site configuration on sites and\n\n633\n00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.610\nwhere I am right here is I'm showing you\nthat I now have my primary site deployed,\n\n634\n00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.110\nyou'll see the site name is\nPLB that's our site code.\n\n635\n00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.130\nPLAB is the name of the site server.\n\n636\n00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.890\nIt's a primary site as you can see on the\nscreen and it's got the server name there,\n\n637\n00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.530\nPLA and etc.\n\n638\n00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.190\nSite is active.\n\n639\n00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.530\nGot our site code and got some,\nyou know, information there.\n\n640\n00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.740\nNotice I don't have a parent site\ncode because I am the parent, right?\n\n641\n00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.182\nAnd so as a result of that,\nthat field stays blank, and\n\n642\n00:30:52.182 --> 00:30:53.800\nit's left blank on purpose.\n\n643\n00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.430\nAnd so what we can do, Is, and\nI'm going to scroll back in or\n\n644\n00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.500\nrather zoom back in so\nyou can see this as well.\n\n645\n00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.350\nI often like to show my students\nthis stuff while I'm teaching\n\n646\n00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.480\nbecause it's important to know\nwhat's going on in there.\n\n647\n00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.870\nWhat I did here,\nlet me just zoom out so you could see.\n\n648\n00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:13.010\nAll I did was I right-clicked\non the column header at the top\n\n649\n00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.480\nof the view there, because there\nare fields that you're not always seeing.\n\n650\n00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.430\nAnd I am gonna zoom in so\nyou can see them, but\n\n651\n00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.070\nI wanted you just to see, because\nmodifying the view and getting the things\n\n652\n00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.510\nyou wanna see here is critical to\nyour ability to manage information.\n\n653\n00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.050\nYou'll notice, by default, we're showing\nyou server name, states, site code,\n\n654\n00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.230\nparent site, ect.\n\n655\n00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:33.500\nBut, you know, you may also want things\nlike build number, install directory.\n\n656\n00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.720\nInstall directory is a big one.\n\n657\n00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.580\nPeople often ask, especially when\nwe start talking about logs,\n\n658\n00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.720\nhey where is this thing?\n\n659\n00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.640\nWhere is it installed?\n\n660\n00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.470\nI don't remember, and or my documentation\nisn't good, or I did it but it was so\n\n661\n00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.515\nlong ago, whatever.\n\n662\n00:31:44.515 --> 00:31:45.705\nAnd we have a solution for that,\n\n663\n00:31:45.705 --> 00:31:48.805\njust check off install directory and\nyou can actually get it.\n\n664\n00:31:48.805 --> 00:31:49.595\nWhat version am I running?\n\n665\n00:31:49.595 --> 00:31:53.616\nA multi-site hierarchy, you may have\n2012 R2 but you may have different patch\n\n666\n00:31:53.616 --> 00:31:56.630\nlevels, you want to see versions,\nthings like that, right?\n\n667\n00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.448\nSo you want to know, build number as well.\n\n668\n00:31:58.448 --> 00:32:01.290\nSo these a good,\nadditional things to be able to add in.\n\n669\n00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:05.212\nSo this may be valuable for\nyou to take a look at.\n\n670\n00:32:05.212 --> 00:32:09.560\nAnd so if we go in and\nwe add an install directory.\n\n671\n00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:15.520\nAnd we just put that in there and we then\nquickly zoom back in, what you can see.\n\n672\n00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.250\nHow many pixels does it make?\n\n673\n00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.230\nOr does it take?\n\n674\n00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:24.350\nRemember those, not the blow pop,\nthe Tootsie Pop commercials?\n\n675\n00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.970\nThe owl?\n\n676\n00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.460\nI'm dating myself, says Mike.\n\n677\n00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.910\nHe's laughing cuz he does remember.\n\n678\n00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.280\nRemember those Tootsie Pop commercials,\nright from the 70s?\n\n679\n00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.110\nOr the 80s, whenever they did them.\n\n680\n00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.420\n>> One, two.\n>> How many licks does it take to get, and\n\n681\n00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.850\nthen he bites the thing, yeah.\n\n682\n00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:34.370\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n683\n00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:35.440\n>> So, anyway, you can see when I add\n\n684\n00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.960\nthe Install Directory in here,\nI can now see the Install Directory,\n\n685\n00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.090\nwhich is gonna become critical so\nI know where to go to look for\n\n686\n00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.860\nmy log files, which we'll be\ntalking about in a little while.\n\n687\n00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.450\nSo it's gonna be important to know that.\n\n688\n00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:53.990\nIn addition, I can go into right below\nto my server and site roles right here.\n\n689\n00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.420\nAnd I can go in, and when I do that and\n\n690\n00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.310\nI come over, I can see again,\nnow my site server.\n\n691\n00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.480\nI can see the site code.\n\n692\n00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.900\nI can see the count of site roles.\n\n693\n00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.170\nI can see what it is.\n\n694\n00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:10.670\nAnd if I then if I come down here,\nI can actually see\n\n695\n00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.810\nthe site roles that are currently\ninstalled and what those roles are.\n\n696\n00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.200\nNow we haven't gone through the roles yet,\nbut we can see what the roles are.\n\n697\n00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.870\nAnd we can begin to see what each one or\neach role is and\n\n698\n00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:23.420\nwhat it does, so the site server's there.\n\n699\n00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.610\nThe site system's there.\n\n700\n00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:26.670\nGot a nice little role\ndescription off to the right.\n\n701\n00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:30.440\nSee management point,\nsite database server, component server,\n\n702\n00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.600\ndistribution point.\n\n703\n00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.930\nAnd I can go in and\nI can then select one or more of these.\n\n704\n00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.270\nSo for instance site server,\nand I can go in and\n\n705\n00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.690\nI'm just bringing up the properties\nreal quick to take a look at that, and\n\n706\n00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.840\nI can bring up the properties and\nI can go in.\n\n707\n00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.780\nAnd I can either take\na look at properties, or\n\n708\n00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:53.540\nI can go to one of the other machines.\n\n709\n00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.890\nI can move around and\ndo a bunch of different things.\n\n710\n00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:00.060\nI also have the right-click\noption up here, so there we go.\n\n711\n00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.410\nThere's my properties,\njust takes a second or two to come up.\n\n712\n00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.480\nSo when I go in and\nI see the properties screen.\n\n713\n00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.850\nI can see information that shows\nme basically where I'm installed,\n\n714\n00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:13.050\nwhat I'm called, my site code,\nhow I'm installed,\n\n715\n00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.950\nhow I'm set up, what my active directory\nforest is, where I'm associated.\n\n716\n00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:19.990\nI also have the ability in this\ncase on the site system properties\n\n717\n00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:21.480\nto look at the proxy screen.\n\n718\n00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.420\nSo I've got the ability to go in and\nto see all of this and\n\n719\n00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:26.750\nto interact with any or\nall of these things.\n\n720\n00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:31.530\nAnd I also can come up to the actual\nsite role itself up here.\n\n721\n00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:37.100\nAnd when I scroll in, you'll see that I\ncan right-click and I can add site roles.\n\n722\n00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.804\nSo when I want to go in and\nadd a site role,\n\n723\n00:34:38.804 --> 00:34:41.235\nI can do that right from\nhere by right-clicking.\n\n724\n00:34:41.235 --> 00:34:43.650\nRight-clicking is gonna be our friend\nwe're gonna find because we have\n\n725\n00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:44.590\na lot of options.\n\n726\n00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.695\nAnd we're not always wanna take\na look at the ribbon up top, and\n\n727\n00:34:46.695 --> 00:34:48.180\nyou'll see what's going on in the ribbon.\n\n728\n00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.050\nAll these options are in\nthe ribbon as well.\n\n729\n00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.490\nBut a lot of times there's a lot of stuff\ngoing on in the ribbon, at least for\n\n730\n00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:53.930\nme and I do this all the time.\n\n731\n00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:57.205\nAnd I find it's very busy,\nthere's a lot of stuff up there and\n\n732\n00:34:57.205 --> 00:35:00.615\nsometimes it's hard to find things cuz\nthey may not always be in the place that I\n\n733\n00:35:00.615 --> 00:35:02.225\nwould logically think they would be.\n\n734\n00:35:02.225 --> 00:35:04.645\nAnd so I'm looking for them and\nI gotta hunt around a little bit but\n\n735\n00:35:04.645 --> 00:35:07.065\nI know if I right-click I'm\ngonna get those options but\n\n736\n00:35:07.065 --> 00:35:09.575\nit's in this menu,\nit's a lot easier to see.\n\n737\n00:35:09.575 --> 00:35:13.605\nSo for me, anyway, I happen to like the\nright-click option a lot but that may or\n\n738\n00:35:13.605 --> 00:35:15.135\nmay not work for you.\n\n739\n00:35:15.135 --> 00:35:18.485\nBut we can do that and we can also go in,\ndepending on the system that we have and,\n\n740\n00:35:18.485 --> 00:35:21.015\nagain, we'll see this a little bit later.\n\n741\n00:35:21.015 --> 00:35:24.750\nBut we can scroll in and when we do start,\nif we have a machine that's actually\n\n742\n00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.816\nactive right now, we're doing things like\nremote assistance and have that set up.\n\n743\n00:35:27.816 --> 00:35:31.090\nYou'll see I right-clicked\non the site role,\n\n744\n00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.811\nwent to the start menu there, remote\nassistance and remote desktop client,\n\n745\n00:35:34.811 --> 00:35:37.930\nremote control, resource explorer,\nthese options are grayed out right now.\n\n746\n00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.790\nBecause I'm not using a system that\nhas an agent installed on it so\n\n747\n00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.190\nI'm not controlling anything.\n\n748\n00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.100\nBut once I get into some of my\nfuture demos, we get a couple of\n\n749\n00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.880\nagents installed, got some servers set up,\nwe're gonna be able to right-click and\n\n750\n00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.372\ngo in and\nuse resource explorer to see inventory.\n\n751\n00:35:51.372 --> 00:35:52.660\nWe're gonna be able to go in and\n\n752\n00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.780\nuse remote control to\neffectively get to the desktop.\n\n753\n00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.948\nMuch like an RDP session,\nremote control the desktop if we need to.\n\n754\n00:35:58.948 --> 00:36:00.710\nSo I'm able to do a lot of stuff and\n\n755\n00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:02.580\nall that's gonna be\nintegrated right from here.\n\n756\n00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.890\nSo it's gonna be very easy and\nvery central for us to do all this stuff,\n\n757\n00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:07.080\nwhich is actually really kind of nice.\n\n758\n00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.080\nSo this is kind of cool, so\nwe can go out of the machine,\n\n759\n00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.220\nwe've done our little demo,\nour show and tell if you will.\n\n760\n00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.900\nWe've taken a look at what\nthe hierarchy looks like.\n\n761\n00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.480\nHow we're gonna set up, how we're\ngonna install, very important for\n\n762\n00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.352\nus to consider.\n\n763\n00:36:20.352 --> 00:36:24.110\nWe're gonna wanna clearly understand that\nwe need at least one primary site server.\n\n764\n00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.855\nVery often, that's all we're gonna have\ndepending on the number of machines we're\n\n765\n00:36:26.855 --> 00:36:27.710\ngonna manage.\n\n766\n00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:32.133\nBut if we get up above, let's say 100,000\nmachines which is what the cap is on\n\n767\n00:36:32.133 --> 00:36:33.995\na single primary site server.\n\n768\n00:36:33.995 --> 00:36:35.310\nWe're gonna break out a secondary one,\n\n769\n00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.600\nyou saw on Mike's diagram you\ncould have more than one.\n\n770\n00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.530\nWe can have up to four primary site\nservers managing up to 100,000 clients\n\n771\n00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:46.690\neach to make a 400,000 client\nsolution across the entire farm for\n\n772\n00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.640\nmaxed out at 400,000 clients right now.\n\n773\n00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.960\nWe would obviously need a central admin\nsite in order to be able to do that.\n\n774\n00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.756\nAnd we may or may not use secondary sites\nas child sites to offset some of those\n\n775\n00:36:55.756 --> 00:37:00.060\nremote clients and mange bandwidth\nallocations a little bit better for that.\n\n776\n00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.110\nSo, we can mix and match,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n777\n00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.370\nDepending on how big your organization is,\ndepending on how large\n\n778\n00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.890\nof a deployment you have you may never get\nout beyond a single primary site server.\n\n779\n00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.300\nThe majority of my clients that\nare using this product, and\n\n780\n00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.500\nI have hundreds of people,\n\n781\n00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.700\nhundreds of clients across the world\nthat are using this particular solution.\n\n782\n00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.270\nLarge, medium, and mega if you will.\n\n783\n00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.410\nWe're gonna take a look in our next\ndiscussion about what those deployment\n\n784\n00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.830\noptions look like and\nwhat that architecture will look like.\n\n785\n00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.860\nBut the majority of my clients are running\neither one primary site server and\n\n786\n00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:34.100\nnothing else or a primary site server with\nseveral secondary site servers to manage\n\n787\n00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.080\nbandwidth issues.\n\n788\n00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.880\nBut are running well below\nthe 100,000 client mark and\n\n789\n00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.150\nare doing that with very,\nvery minimal infrastructure.\n\n790\n00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.392\nAnd are very happy with what they have.\n\n791\n00:37:42.392 --> 00:37:45.230\nI have very few clients overall\nthat are actually using\n\n792\n00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.520\na complex multi-site hierarchy and\nusing central admin sites.\n\n793\n00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.920\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n794\n00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.480\nThink about that.\n\n795\n00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.460\nYou have options.\n\n796\n00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.650\nThere's no shame in saying\nI have a single site and\n\n797\n00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.260\nthat's all I've done with\nthe primary site server.\n\n798\n00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.060\nYou know, simplicity with products\nlike this is the key to success.\n\n799\n00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.750\nYou wanna think about that as we continue\nour conversations in upcoming episodes.\n\n800\n00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.005\n>> Very good stuff Adam.\n\n801\n00:38:04.005 --> 00:38:08.511\nGreat look at the architecture involved\nwith System Center Configuration Manager\n\n802\n00:38:08.511 --> 00:38:11.935\nfrom the small all the way up to\nthe mega as you say is fantastic.\n\n803\n00:38:11.935 --> 00:38:13.315\nAll right, we appreciate that.\n\n804\n00:38:13.315 --> 00:38:14.415\nHope you enjoyed watching.\n\n805\n00:38:14.415 --> 00:38:17.373\nRemember, if you wanna attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n806\n00:38:17.373 -->

That's cool.\n\n21\n00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.570\nThat's because you're not getting\nthe valet parker thing resolved for me.\n\n22\n00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.670\nThat must be what it is right?\n\n23\n00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.960\n>> That's what it is.\n>> No valet parker so I get the title.\n\n24\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.770\nI'm doing good.\n\n25\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.300\nI'm doing good.\n\n26\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.360\nSo thank you,\nglad to be back with you guys.\n\n27\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.560\nSo let's continue talking.\n\n28\n00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.020\nYou know one of the things\nthat I mentioned in\n\n29\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.040\nour initial episodes was the idea of\nSystem Center being a suite of products.\n\n30\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.900\nAnd I want to come back to that for\njust a second.\n\n31\n00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.180\nI want to talk quickly about licensing.\n\n32\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.110\nSomething we often tend to overlook or\nnot think about when we're planning until\n\n33\n00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.165\nwe actually go to purchase and then we\nare sticker shocked more often than not.\n\n34\n00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:34.610\n[LAUGH] And in addition we may not have\nthe full information we need in order to\n\n35\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.220\nmake the right decisions or\nthe right- ultimately for us in terms of\n\n36\n00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.680\nour architecture as I have a blank moment-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.900\n>> And totally lose track of\n\n38\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.400\nwhere I'm going.\n\n39\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.199\nMy train of thought just\nran right off the tracks.\n\n40\n00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n41\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.520\nwhen we have the thought posture and\n\n42\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.370\nlicensing, we wanna make sure that we're\nthinking about making good decisions.\n\n43\n00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.370\nWe stress this idea in our prior\nepisode about planning and\n\n44\n00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.290\nreally planning being the key to success.\n\n45\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.630\nAnd a lot of my clients\ntend to overlook licensing.\n\n46\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.560\nBelieve it or not, as silly as that\nmay sound to you because that’s\n\n47\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.430\none of the first things that, more often\nthan not, we really want to think about.\n\n48\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.200\nYou know, what version or\nversions of the product are available?\n\n49\n00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.140\nWhat do they cost?\n\n50\n00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.480\nWhich one will I need based on my needs?\n\n51\n00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.950\nHow much am I going to spend?\n\n52\n00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190\nThese are really important\nthings to figure out upfront.\n\n53\n00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.910\nNow a big a big caveat, a big disclaimer,\na big, we don't have a big asterisk, but\n\n54\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.610\nif we had a visual\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n55\n00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.110\n>> We could hold up a big asterisk\nnext to that when I say that.\n\n56\n00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.065\nBut big asterisk here, there's always\na but associated with these conversations.\n\n57\n00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.660\nWhat I want you to be clear about\nis that whatever we talk about here\n\n58\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.790\ntoday at this moment in time\nwith regards to licensing\n\n59\n00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.810\nis no longer valid by\nthe time you see this, right?\n\n60\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.140\nBecause it is changed five or six times.\n\n61\n00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.771\nSo my point is with licensing,\nall kidding aside, you must go out and\n\n62\n00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:48.842\nget the most recent information from\nthe vendor, from a trusted partner, or\n\n63\n00:02:48.842 --> 00:02:53.223\nreseller that the vendor works with, a\nLAR, a VAR whoever, whatever that may be,\n\n64\n00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:55.193\nthere are a lot of options out there.\n\n65\n00:02:55.193 --> 00:02:58.840\nNot trying to say at all you should\ngo to any one in particular.\n\n66\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.680\nThere are many,\nmany trusted sources of this information.\n\n67\n00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.620\nWhat you do not want to do is\nlisten to something like this.\n\n68\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.550\nListen to me tell you this is\nthe option that's available right now.\n\n69\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.090\nAnd assume that six months or\n\n70\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.050\na year from now when you go to ultimately\ndeploy that, that will still be the case.\n\n71\n00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.467\nThat's what I want to make\nsure you're aware of.\n\n72\n00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:19.320\nNumber two, with regards to licensing,\nprices change.\n\n73\n00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.120\nThey change on a regular\nbasis as do features,\n\n74\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.030\nas do availability based on\nfunctionality that you purchase.\n\n75\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.720\nWhether you purchase in\nthe government space, you purchase in\n\n76\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.580\nthe education space, you purchase in the\nfull-product-off-the-shelf retail space.\n\n77\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.380\nYou know, there’s a lot of different\nlicensing configurations that most\n\n78\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.370\nvendors offer.\n\n79\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.480\nSome organizations get a discount\nbased on their status.\n\n80\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.510\nOthers do not.\n\n81\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.390\nSome get a discount based on volume.\n\n82\n00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.500\nOthers do not.\n\n83\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.290\nIt really depends.\n\n84\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.000\nAnd there's too many options to mix and\nmatch with for\n\n85\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.330\nus to go through them with you here.\n\n86\n00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.040\nAs I said even if we did literally\nthe outcome of that conversation would be\n\n87\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.900\nunfortunately really useless to you\nbecause the information would be dated.\n\n88\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.070\nAnd I do a lot of licensing work for\ncustomers.\n\n89\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.100\nI spend a lot of time helping them\nunderstand licensing, I do and\n\n90\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.610\nindeed am certified as a specialist in\nlicensing for Microsoft in particular.\n\n91\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.950\nI do a lot of this kind of work on other\nplatforms, VMware for instance, things\n\n92\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.260\nlike that, as a consultant with customers\nand even though I specialize in this and\n\n93\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.330\nI do this on a regular basis,\nI still have to go look stuff up.\n\n94\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.540\nThat's how often it changes, that's how\noften things can effectively, literally\n\n95\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.610\nchange behind the scenes, based on vendor,\nand based on vendor specifications.\n\n96\n00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.570\nSo, don't ever, ever make a decision\nabout deployment based solely on\n\n97\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.870\nwhat a snapshot may have been around\nlicensing from a certain moment in time.\n\n98\n00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.775\nAlways check up until\nthe moment you're ready to buy.\n\n99\n00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:42.745\nAnd make sure that that licensing\nchange has not impacted you\n\n100\n00:04:42.745 --> 00:04:43.895\npositively or negatively.\n\n101\n00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:47.820\nBecause you know, although rare,\noccasionally prices can actually go down.\n\n102\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it does,\n\n103\n00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:52.640\nalthough it really doesn't ever happen For\nthe most part they usually go up, but\n\n104\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.210\nif you're at the tail end of a product\ncycle and a new product is releasing,\n\n105\n00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.790\nsometimes there will be\na decrease in the licensing and\n\n106\n00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.390\nyou can take advantage of that in theory.\n\n107\n00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.570\nSo you do want to know that even though\nnormally it goes up, as opposed to down.\n\n108\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.320\n>> More often than not.\n\n109\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.543\nCuz planning's obviously gonna\ntake a little bit of time.\n\n110\n00:05:06.543 --> 00:05:07.170\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n111\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.917\n>> So it's something that we got to\nlook at early on, but then we're gonna\n\n112\n00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:14.790\nhave to plan on revisiting towards\nthe end of our planning stage.\n\n113\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.034\n>> You have to plan,\nto plan, to plan, right.\n\n114\n00:05:16.034 --> 00:05:17.140\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n>> So it's not going to be\n\n115\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.570\ncurrent anymore,\nbecause it takes us three months to plan.\n\n116\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.420\nAnd if you remember when we have these\nconversations, not that we always want to\n\n117\n00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.930\nreference things that we've done\noutside of this discussion, but\n\n118\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.160\nwe've had these conversations, Mike and\nI, and specifically around security.\n\n119\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.520\nAnd I talk a lot about, when I talk about\nsecurity, secure early and secure often.\n\n120\n00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.458\nI think it's equally important to about\nplanning early and planning often.\n\n121\n00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:37.750\nIn that vein and\n\n122\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.990\nto Mike's point planning once is not\nthe same thing as planning successfully.\n\n123\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.305\n>> Um-hm.\n>> Cause when you plan once, and\n\n124\n00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:45.685\nthings change, you have to\nrevisit them as Mike pointed out.\n\n125\n00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:49.325\nAnd he's absolutely right to remind us\nof that and focus our attention on that.\n\n126\n00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:52.100\nSo the message is clear,\nhopefully in your mind.\n\n127\n00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.340\nCheck on licensing,\n\n128\n00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.590\ncheck on options, put that as a line\nitem into your deployment planning and\n\n129\n00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.050\nthen make sure that there is a place\nholder within an estimate for pricing.\n\n130\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.010\nBut also make a clear note and\na clear understanding in your mind and\n\n131\n00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.010\nthe mind of those that are going\nto sign off on that line item,\n\n132\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.100\nthat ultimately that number may change.\n\n133\n00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.070\nAnd the longer you wait\nto implement that plan,\n\n134\n00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.100\nthe more likely it is\nthat it could change.\n\n135\n00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.910\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n136\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.380\nAll right, having said that,\njust a little bit of an opening salvo,\n\n137\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.690\nif you will, with regards to some\nthings we want to be aware of.\n\n138\n00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.970\nLet's talk a bit about features.\n\n139\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.970\nYou know we've talked\na lot about structure,\n\n140\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.190\nabout the different ways in whcih we could\ndeploy, System Center Config manager.\n\n141\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.050\nGonna take you out to the web and show you\na couple things that will help you with\n\n142\n00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.300\nadditional resources around planning\ndeployment in a few minutes.\n\n143\n00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.900\nBefore we do that,\n\n144\n00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.295\nI want to talk about some of the new\nfeatures that are available, and\n\n145\n00:06:37.295 --> 00:06:41.035\nsome of the things that we can rely on\nwith regards to System Center 2012,\n\n146\n00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:43.795\n2012 R2 in particular in this case.\n\n147\n00:06:43.795 --> 00:06:47.575\nI know we can maybe we could\njust zoom in a touch so\n\n148\n00:06:47.575 --> 00:06:48.675\nthat way we can see a little bit.\n\n149\n00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:49.665\nThere, yea, not too much.\n\n150\n00:06:49.665 --> 00:06:50.339\nThat's probably good right there.\n\n151\n00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.866\nThat way I am sitting right there\nat the edge of that text but\n\n152\n00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:55.459\nthey can see everything which\nis obviously very valuable.\n\n153\n00:06:55.459 --> 00:07:00.252\nSo when we think about 2012,\n2012 SP1, 2012 R2, and I keep coming\n\n154\n00:07:00.252 --> 00:07:05.115\nback to this idea of there being multiple\nversions of Systems Center Config Manager\n\n155\n00:07:05.115 --> 00:07:08.710\nthat we may see in market and\nthat you may be dealing with.\n\n156\n00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.660\nWe are focusing on the 2012 R2\nconversation, or least for the most part,\n\n157\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.220\nattempting to.\n\n158\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.590\nI mean we revisit some of these\nother versions for various reasons.\n\n159\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.100\nIt's important to look back in\norder to know where you are.\n\n160\n00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.520\nWhen we talk about 2012, we're talking\nabout a brand new set of features that\n\n161\n00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.870\npreviewed and debuted, in some cases,\n\n162\n00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.740\nin this particular product because the\nmove from 2007 to 2012 was a massive one.\n\n163\n00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.764\nAnd we changed\nthe underlying architecture,\n\n164\n00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:37.250\nchanged the underlying thought\nprocess of the product.\n\n165\n00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.386\nAdded a bunch of new features and\ncapabilities, including support for newer\n\n166\n00:07:41.386 --> 00:07:46.429\noperating systems, Windows 8, Windows 8.1,\nWindows R-T, as you could see up there.\n\n167\n00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:50.839\nSo we want to be thinking about the fact\nthat there are a lot of new things that\n\n168\n00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:55.739\nthis product can do that if any of you are\nfamiliar with System Center Config Manager\n\n169\n00:07:55.739 --> 00:07:58.549\n07, R2, R3, service pack levels, etc.\n\n170\n00:07:58.549 --> 00:08:02.184\nThere were multiple versions of\n07 in market over many years.\n\n171\n00:08:02.184 --> 00:08:04.137\nBut if you're familiar with that product,\n\n172\n00:08:04.137 --> 00:08:07.300\nsome of the things we're talking\nabout now are still very similar.\n\n173\n00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.000\nWe had a similar hierarchical thought\nprocess at certain points, but\n\n174\n00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.710\nit may look a little different today.\n\n175\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.480\nWe now have new and innovative features\nthat are supported in the platform that\n\n176\n00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.790\ndid not exist in 07, or\nat least in certain versions, anyway.\n\n177\n00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.897\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n178\n00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:26.532\nWe also wanna make sure that depending\non what version of the product you\n\n179\n00:08:26.532 --> 00:08:30.253\nare currently deploying,\n12, 12 SP1, 12 R2.\n\n180\n00:08:30.253 --> 00:08:34.143\nCertain of these versioned features will\nnot exist because some of them are only\n\n181\n00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:35.580\ngonna be available in R2.\n\n182\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.507\nSo you have to be aware of that as well,\nagain, check the documentation.\n\n183\n00:08:38.507 --> 00:08:42.775\nVery important to know that with regards\nto, did you just hear a go-kart go by?\n\n184\n00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:44.354\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I thought I heard a go-kart go by.\n\n185\n00:08:44.354 --> 00:08:47.458\nWith regards to R2,\nalso keep in mind that because the newest\n\n186\n00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:50.981\nfeatures are available obviously,\nclearly in the latest versions,\n\n187\n00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:55.004\nwhen newer service packs and/or updates\ncome out, they may add new features.\n\n188\n00:08:55.004 --> 00:08:58.756\nAnd while you're listening to this with\nus now, if you're listening live, three,\n\n189\n00:08:58.756 --> 00:09:02.607\nfour, six, seven, eight, nine months from\nnow, a year from now, if you come back and\n\n190\n00:09:02.607 --> 00:09:05.578\nreview these recordings at some point,\nthis conversation may have\n\n191\n00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:08.980\nnew features associated with it that\nare not gonna be mentioned here.\n\n192\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.900\nAnd so I'll remind you yet\n\n193\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.930\nagain to go out to the website and take\na look for the most recent information\n\n194\n00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.560\non the product because the vendor\nprovides great documentation for that.\n\n195\n00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.110\nBut obviously,\n\n196\n00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.434\nwe're not able to capture all of that\nin real time on an ongoing basis.\n\n197\n00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:23.382\nAnd so I just want to remind you of those\nthings when we talk about features.\n\n198\n00:09:23.382 --> 00:09:27.334\nIn addition, if you are planning on\npreparing for the exam, the exam\n\n199\n00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:32.124\nassociated with System Center Config\nManager 2012 R2, which is the, Mike?\n\n200\n00:09:32.124 --> 00:09:33.622\n>> 7243.\n\n201\n00:09:33.622 --> 00:09:34.621\n>> Oh, look at that.\n\n202\n00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:35.863\nMike studied during lunch.\n\n203\n00:09:35.863 --> 00:09:37.608\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what happens when you eat a good\n\n204\n00:09:37.608 --> 00:09:38.242\nlunch, boys and girls.\n\n205\n00:09:38.242 --> 00:09:38.823\n>> That's right.\n\n206\n00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:39.799\n>> You get to answer questions correctly.\n\n207\n00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:40.994\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's right.\n\n208\n00:09:40.994 --> 00:09:44.476\nThe 7243 exam, if you are gonna\nprepare for that exam, and\n\n209\n00:09:44.476 --> 00:09:48.813\nhopefully a lot of you will be, you're\ngonna wanna definitely without fail,\n\n210\n00:09:48.813 --> 00:09:52.708\nunderstand what the features\nare that are supported on 2012 R2.\n\n211\n00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:54.194\nIt's going to be very important for\nyou to know that.\n\n212\n00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:57.842\nYou're also going to gonna wanna make\nsure that you're not distracted by newer\n\n213\n00:09:57.842 --> 00:09:59.802\nfeatures that may get in the way of that,\nor\n\n214\n00:09:59.802 --> 00:10:02.045\nolder features that may\nno longer be supported.\n\n215\n00:10:02.045 --> 00:10:05.785\nSo just make sure you're focusing on that\nand have the right understanding of those.\n\n216\n00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:08.305\nYou can see a list of some of the common\nones available on the screen.\n\n217\n00:10:08.305 --> 00:10:10.442\nWe've kind of been talking around them for\na couple of minutes.\n\n218\n00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:14.062\nI mentioned operating system support,\nWindows 8, Windows 8.1 is up there.\n\n219\n00:10:14.062 --> 00:10:15.160\nThis is Windows RT.\n\n220\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.712\nWe have the iOS, Mac OS X and\nAndroid support as well.\n\n221\n00:10:19.712 --> 00:10:21.757\nI mentioned that with regards\nto being able to reach out and\n\n222\n00:10:21.757 --> 00:10:23.984\nto do management through\nthe Exchange ActiveSync Connector.\n\n223\n00:10:23.984 --> 00:10:28.592\nIn one of our prior episodes, we also had\nsupport for Windows Server 12, 12 R2 for\n\n224\n00:10:28.592 --> 00:10:30.057\nsite system role hosting.\n\n225\n00:10:30.057 --> 00:10:33.017\nYou'll notice Server 16 is\nnot on that list currently.\n\n226\n00:10:33.017 --> 00:10:37.329\nIt will be as Server 16 finally releases,\nand it's gonna be updated into the support\n\n227\n00:10:37.329 --> 00:10:40.297\nroles, most likely towards\nthe middle to end of 2016.\n\n228\n00:10:40.297 --> 00:10:42.567\nSo we'll see that coming\nout at some point later.\n\n229\n00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:45.515\nYou'll see we have support for SQL 2012.\n\n230\n00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:50.193\nWe have support for being able to\nmanage and to configure or to deal with\n\n231\n00:10:50.193 --> 00:10:55.235\nConfigure Manager hierarchies,\nmerging them, and coordinating them.\n\n232\n00:10:55.235 --> 00:10:57.590\nWe've talked a bit about that and\nhow some of that works.\n\n233\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.140\nSo wanna just make sure we're\nthinking about some of those things.\n\n234\n00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.910\nThe bottom choice,\n\n235\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.537\nbottom item, Configuration Manager\nWindows PowerShell cmdlets,\n\n236\n00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:06.632\ndo you know how many cmdlets there are for\nWindows PowerShell for System Center?\n\n237\n00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:07.306\n>> For System Center?\n\n238\n00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:09.546\nI would assume-\n>> For Config Manager, specifically.\n\n239\n00:11:09.546 --> 00:11:13.076\n>> For Configuration Manager,\nI would say over a dozen.\n\n240\n00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:16.097\n>> Over a dozen, wow,\nyou should go to Vegas and gamble for\n\n241\n00:11:16.097 --> 00:11:18.555\nyou are the most\nconservative person I know.\n\n242\n00:11:18.555 --> 00:11:19.925\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So over a dozen,\n\n243\n00:11:19.925 --> 00:11:21.319\nthat's like say, how big?\n\n244\n00:11:21.319 --> 00:11:24.001\nWell, it's bigger than a breadbox, but\nnowhere near as big as an elephant.\n\n245\n00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:26.404\nSo there are well over a dozen.\n\n246\n00:11:26.404 --> 00:11:27.645\nMike is absolutely correct.\n\n247\n00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:30.048\nI'm not going to give you any credit for\nthat one, however.\n\n248\n00:11:30.048 --> 00:11:30.780\n>> [LAUGH] Oh man.\n\n249\n00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.927\n>> [LAUGH] You hedged way too far\nto the safe zone on that one.\n\n250\n00:11:32.927 --> 00:11:34.460\nSo Mike is absolutely correct.\n\n251\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.181\n>> 137.\n\n252\n00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:35.900\nThere are more than that.\n\n253\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.522\nThere are over 430,\nactually closer to 470.\n\n254\n00:11:39.522 --> 00:11:42.738\nPowerShell cmdlets specific\njust FCCM 2012 R2.\n\n255\n00:11:42.738 --> 00:11:44.398\nSo that is quite a number.\n\n256\n00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:47.572\nAnd one of the things that as an\nadministrator you wanna be thinking about\n\n257\n00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:49.444\nand really if you have\nnot already done so,\n\n258\n00:11:49.444 --> 00:11:52.330\nyou need to start figuring out\nhow to integrate this knowledge.\n\n259\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.006\nI talked about supporting products and\nperipheral things we wanna be aware of.\n\n260\n00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:58.669\nTalked about SQL, talked about SharePoint,\ntalked about the Active Directory,\n\n261\n00:11:58.669 --> 00:12:01.700\ntalked about the other System Center\nproducts in the suite.\n\n262\n00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.690\nOne of the things I didn't mention,\nalthough I previewed it quickly for you\n\n263\n00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.310\nin our very first episode where we did the\nrun through the console, is PowerShell.\n\n264\n00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.810\nAnd we talked a bit about PowerShell.\n\n265\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.490\nI mentioned Orchestrator,\nwhich is a workflow automation product,\n\n266\n00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.160\nit's part of the System Center\nsuite that could be used to\n\n267\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.050\nautomate not just SCCM tasks and\nactivities but is very, very important,\n\n268\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.540\nvery valuable with regards to SCOM,\nthe System Center Ops Manager.\n\n269\n00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.010\nThe service level manager,\nthe SLM product, which is the helpdesk,\n\n270\n00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.250\nservice desk feature component.\n\n271\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.243\nIt's very valuable for all those things\nwhen we create what are called runbooks.\n\n272\n00:12:32.243 --> 00:12:35.967\nIt automates solutions across those\nplatforms and between the products, so\n\n273\n00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:39.060\nyou can use a runbook that will\nautomate monitoring in SCOM, and\n\n274\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.828\nthen interactivity, management,\nand action in SCCM.\n\n275\n00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:45.310\nCombine the two together with one\nrunbook as well as doing ticketing and\n\n276\n00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.746\nautomation for opening up tickets\nin SLM across the entire platform.\n\n277\n00:12:48.746 --> 00:12:50.353\n>> Wow.\n>> So you know I do a lot of work with\n\n278\n00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:51.135\nthese products.\n\n279\n00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:52.296\nI teach a lot of courses on them.\n\n280\n00:12:52.296 --> 00:12:56.053\nI do a lot of work for customers and\nclients doing custom installations and\n\n281\n00:12:56.053 --> 00:12:58.380\ncustom deployment solutions with this.\n\n282\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.710\nIt's a really powerful set of tools, but\n\n283\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.480\nthe one thing that ties most of that\ntogether, that often goes underrated and\n\n284\n00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.790\nreally underutilized and\nundersold is PowerShell.\n\n285\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.160\nAnd what you have to learn about if you\nare a system administrator today, or\n\n286\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.400\nif you're just starting out and you wanna\nbe, with regards to CCM is PowerShell.\n\n287\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.827\nThe value of automation,\nthe value of script-driven administration,\n\n288\n00:13:18.827 --> 00:13:21.490\ncannot really be understated\nwith a tool like this.\n\n289\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.769\nIf you're preparing for\nthe exam in particular,\n\n290\n00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:27.567\nif you do not know PowerShell and do not\nunderstand how PowerShell can be utilized,\n\n291\n00:13:27.567 --> 00:13:30.623\nyou are gonna struggle to get\nthrough this exam, just to be clear.\n\n292\n00:13:30.623 --> 00:13:34.424\nSo forewarned is forearmed, as they say.\n\n293\n00:13:34.424 --> 00:13:37.594\nYou've been warned, please act\nappropriately, but please, take the time.\n\n294\n00:13:37.594 --> 00:13:39.955\nAnd I'm not suggesting you\nhave to go through and\n\n295\n00:13:39.955 --> 00:13:43.015\nlearn every one of those 470 cmdlets,\nquite the opposite.\n\n296\n00:13:43.015 --> 00:13:47.137\nYou will probably never use three quarters\nof them, even once, let alone often.\n\n297\n00:13:47.137 --> 00:13:50.236\nBut there's a core group of those\ncmdlets that you may use very often.\n\n298\n00:13:50.236 --> 00:13:53.737\nAnd if you're gonna want to learn how to\nautomate and to effectively orchestrate\n\n299\n00:13:53.737 --> 00:13:57.546\nthese products, you're gonna have to start\nthinking about what PowerShell does, and\n\n300\n00:13:57.546 --> 00:13:58.799\nhow you can integrate that.\n\n301\n00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:02.061\nAnd I know that there's a lot of good\ntraining out there for PowerShell.\n\n302\n00:14:02.061 --> 00:14:03.478\nI'm sure there is.\n\n303\n00:14:03.478 --> 00:14:04.615\n>> We've got a few in our library.\n\n304\n00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:06.508\n>> Right, I'm sure that there's some\ngood stuff in the library already.\n\n305\n00:14:06.508 --> 00:14:09.555\nThere's always new stuff coming\nout with regards to PowerShell and\n\n306\n00:14:09.555 --> 00:14:11.085\nthe use of it on the platform.\n\n307\n00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:13.665\nAnd it's definitely something that\nyou wanna be thinking about, and\n\n308\n00:14:13.665 --> 00:14:17.480\nreally just as much as possible\nbe aware of and focus on.\n\n309\n00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.910\nOkay, so just think about that.\n\n310\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.940\nAll right, so with regards to\nnew features, right, obviously,\n\n311\n00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.130\nsome things to consider.\n\n312\n00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.738\nWhen we think about it and\nthere's one thing I did wanna bring up,\n\n313\n00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:27.774\nwe're not really going to talk about\nupgrading per se too much at least not in\n\n314\n00:14:27.774 --> 00:14:29.072\nthese initial conversations.\n\n315\n00:14:29.072 --> 00:14:32.554\nBut with regards to upgrading,\nI mentioned the SCCM 2007 product,\n\n316\n00:14:32.554 --> 00:14:35.000\nwhich is the earlier\nversion of the product.\n\n317\n00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.850\nWe can upgrade not from 2007 direct,\n\n318\n00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.130\nwe're not really talking about\nthat kind of an upgrade, but\n\n319\n00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:45.310\nwe can upgrade from 2012, if we have an\nearlier version of the product deployed.\n\n320\n00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.260\nBut we have to do it in a certain way.\n\n321\n00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.470\nA lot of people had 2007 for\na long time, 2012 came out.\n\n322\n00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.290\nThey deployed 2012, but\nthat was the initial release.\n\n323\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.530\nThen there was 2012 SP1,\nthen there's 2012 R2.\n\n324\n00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.296\nAnd so being able to figure out how to\nget to from where you are to where you\n\n325\n00:14:59.296 --> 00:15:02.022\nultimately wanna go with the newest\nversion of the product is also very\n\n326\n00:15:02.022 --> 00:15:02.552\nimportant.\n\n327\n00:15:02.552 --> 00:15:06.240\nWith regards to 2012,\nif you have 2012 deployed already,\n\n328\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.550\nthere is an upgrade path,\nbut only from 2012 with SP1.\n\n329\n00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.476\nSo in other words, you must apply\nService Pack 1 to the 2012 install.\n\n330\n00:15:13.476 --> 00:15:17.540\nOnce you've done that,\nyou can then update to 2012 R2.\n\n331\n00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.540\nIf you don't have SP1 applied, you will\nnot be able to upgrade to 2012 R2.\n\n332\n00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.275\nSomething else for\nyou to be aware of and to consider.\n\n333\n00:15:23.275 --> 00:15:27.020\nAgain, all these little things that\nwe may or may not know, that may or\n\n334\n00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.048\nmay not stand out.\n\n335\n00:15:28.048 --> 00:15:31.237\nA lot of times we'll read documentation,\nand you'll go to the website,\n\n336\n00:15:31.237 --> 00:15:33.520\nthe TechEd site or\nwhatever for the product.\n\n337\n00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.490\nAnd this information is\nburied there somewhere.\n\n338\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.333\nI promise you. It is there. >> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't make this stuff up.\n\n339\n00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:38.355\nIt doesn't come out of thin air.\n\n340\n00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:41.536\nI don't go to sleep at night, wake up in\nthe middle of the night, go, oh, yeah.\n\n341\n00:15:41.536 --> 00:15:43.892\nI gotta tell people about\nthat cuz nobody knows.\n\n342\n00:15:43.892 --> 00:15:45.552\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, this stuff is out there.\n\n343\n00:15:45.552 --> 00:15:48.336\nBut if you don't know where it is,\nand you're not familiar with it,\n\n344\n00:15:48.336 --> 00:15:51.120\nyou're gonna struggle to find it,\nespecially if you don't realize\n\n345\n00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.808\nyou need to know it as part of\nthe process of figuring out what to do.\n\n346\n00:15:53.808 --> 00:15:55.261\nSo keep that in mind, right?\n\n347\n00:15:55.261 --> 00:15:57.083\nIt is one of those things\nthat will be important.\n\n348\n00:15:57.083 --> 00:16:01.001\nIt is what I would say is a Piece of\nknowledge that, from a question and\n\n349\n00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:03.773\nanswer perspective,\nwould be very valuable for\n\n350\n00:16:03.773 --> 00:16:06.490\nyou to make sure you\nremember would be helpful.\n\n351\n00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.568\nWe always do tend to talk about and\nask about and\n\n352\n00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:11.450\nwanna know about migration pathways and\nthings like that.\n\n353\n00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.800\nWhen we tend to take exams,\n\n354\n00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.370\nthat's usually a piece of\ninformation that's very valuable.\n\n355\n00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.050\nSo just wanna keep that in mind,\nbe aware of that,\n\n356\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:18.920\nbe thinking about that if you will.\n\n357\n00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.040\nCan stand you in good stead, as they say.\n\n358\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.540\nSo we have talked a little bit about the\ndifferent sites, the central admin site,\n\n359\n00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.270\njust reminding you, the primary site,\nchild site, how all that comes together.\n\n360\n00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.500\nOr the secondary site, rather,\nwhich is the child site.\n\n361\n00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.090\nSo want to just be thinking about that.\n\n362\n00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.524\nI believe I mentioned that a single\nconfiguration manager site,\n\n363\n00:16:36.524 --> 00:16:41.030\na primary site, can handle up to 100,000\nclients depending on configuration.\n\n364\n00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.320\nThe key there was the idea of whether\nthe database was installed locally or\n\n365\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.480\nwas gonna be used remotely.\n\n366\n00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.540\nJust want to remind you of that.\n\n367\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.680\nI talked about the fact that if we\nhave the database installed locally,\n\n368\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.890\nwe're somewhere between 50,000 and\n25,000 clients.\n\n369\n00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.710\nWhen we hit that break point, we have to\ngo out and either scale the database up or\n\n370\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.320\nset up a secondary site to\nmanage additional clients.\n\n371\n00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.000\nPrimary site somewhere else for\nmore clients.\n\n372\n00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.680\nDifferent ways to go.\n\n373\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.130\nBut we're not going to be able to manage\nall 100,000 against a primary site\n\n374\n00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.570\nwith a database installed locally.\n\n375\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.310\nThere are some scalability\nissues associated with that.\n\n376\n00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:15.100\nSo as a result of that, you may need to\ninstall additional management points,\n\n377\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.620\nadditional site roles, additional sites.\n\n378\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.540\nSo again there's lots of ways to go there,\nbut keep that in mind and\n\n379\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.080\nthink about that.\n\n380\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.940\nAnd I know that we have some diagrams that\nwe were gonna talk about with regards\n\n381\n00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.910\nto kinds of deployments, or\n\n382\n00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.340\nat least show you the guards to\ndifferent types of deployments.\n\n383\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.150\nSo wanna be able to show the small\nto medium, and then medium to large,\n\n384\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.240\nand then ultimately large to\nwhat you called, I think,\n\n385\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.610\nmega and global, world spanning\ndeployments [LAUGH], as Mike labeled them.\n\n386\n00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:40.040\nSo you wanna think about that as well.\n\n387\n00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.429\nSo let's talk about what Config Manager\nlooks like in a small to a medium size\n\n388\n00:17:44.429 --> 00:17:45.600\norganization.\n\n389\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.200\nYou'll see a diagram on the screen there\nthat Michael's put together for us.\n\n390\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.125\nAnd giving credit where credit's due,\nMike's done all the illustrations for us.\n\n391\n00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:55.810\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> And I kid around a lot when we deliver\n\n392\n00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.720\nthis stuff sometimes, but it's all kidding\naside and very serious for a moment, it's\n\n393\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.090\na lot of hard work to put these diagrams\ntogether And reproduce them in a way that\n\n394\n00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.722\nnot only makes sense for us to talk to,\nbut also is clear for you to understand.\n\n395\n00:18:06.722 --> 00:18:09.670\nSo wanna make sure we give Mike credit for\ndoing all that hard work for us.\n\n396\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.248\nCuz I'm way too lazy and\nthere was no way I was gonna do it.\n\n397\n00:18:12.248 --> 00:18:13.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So glad he did it or\n\n398\n00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.100\nwe'd be looking at stick figures, cuz it's\nthe extent of my drawing capabilities.\n\n399\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.310\nCan we zoom in just a little bit, just so\n\n400\n00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.840\nwe can see a little bit\nof the detail there?\n\n401\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.930\nSo what we see is we have a circle.\n\n402\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.540\nThe circle just represents a boundary.\n\n403\n00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.910\nIt's really not anything\nmore important than that.\n\n404\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.700\nBoundaries are very important,\nbut for purposes of this diagram,\n\n405\n00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.420\nit's really just representing the boundary\nthat shows us that all the roles,\n\n406\n00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.250\nwhich is what is labeled\nnext to that server.\n\n407\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.660\nThat server's also a primary site server,\nby the way.\n\n408\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.240\nWe don't have to label it,\njust so we know.\n\n409\n00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.495\nBut it's a primary site\nserver in this example.\n\n410\n00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:43.350\nThis'll be a standalone\nprimary site server solution.\n\n411\n00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.810\nSingle server hierarchy as we’ve talked\nabout, small to medium organizations,\n\n412\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:52.860\nanywhere from several 10, several 100,\nseveral 1,000 endpoints, up to\n\n413\n00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.260\nmaybe as many as 100,000 endpoints, can be\nmanaged on this one installation, which is\n\n414\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.450\nactually a significant number of machines,\nand I’ve mentioned that most of my clients\n\n415\n00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.520\nworld wide are gonna run infrastructure\nthat looks very similar to this.\n\n416\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.380\nThey're gonna do a single server install.\n\n417\n00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.300\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n418\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.320\nAll those little machines down on the\nbottom there on the left are really just\n\n419\n00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.920\nrepresenting end points, whether they're\ndesktops, servers, whatever they may be.\n\n420\n00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.620\nJust representing end points\nthat are being managed.\n\n421\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.880\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n422\n00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.070\nCan we go to the next one,\nwhich is the medium.\n\n423\n00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.340\nThat's the global one, right?\n\n424\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.160\n>> No, that's medium large.\n\n425\n00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.880\n>> That's medium large.\n\n426\n00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.840\nI'm sorry.\nI'm looking at it from far away.\n\n427\n00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.108\nSo you wanna do medium to large.\n\n428\n00:19:25.108 --> 00:19:28.568\nLet's zoom in just a little bit and\ntake a look at that.\n\n429\n00:19:28.568 --> 00:19:34.288\nFewer than 100,000 clients, but probably\nmore than 50,000, cuz remember 50,000\n\n430\n00:19:34.288 --> 00:19:38.708\nis the outer edge of that break point with\nregards to a single primary server being\n\n431\n00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:42.680\nable to be set up with a database\non it's own system running locally.\n\n432\n00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.198\nSo you wanna be thinking about that.\n\n433\n00:19:44.198 --> 00:19:47.970\nWe're probably gonna go ahead and\nwe're probably gonna see that we have,\n\n434\n00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:52.260\nas you see here, different roles,\ndifferent site roles broken out.\n\n435\n00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.120\nAnd we can see software update\npoint on the left there.\n\n436\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.920\nSite server, again that's going to be\na primary site server sitting up there.\n\n437\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.740\nWe have a site database broken\nout separately on the right.\n\n438\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.450\nThat's gonna be a SQL install.\n\n439\n00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.300\nThat's gonna be dedicated just\nto running the SQL database,\n\n440\n00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.450\nbreaking that database out\nof the primary site server.\n\n441\n00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.610\nGives us the ability to scale up.\n\n442\n00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.250\nWe've got some clients down there\nat the bottom and that's fine.\n\n443\n00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.630\nWe're just seeing them managed there.\n\n444\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.890\nAnd then you'll notice on the left and\n\n445\n00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.636\nalso on the right as we roll over that\nwe have some additional site roles.\n\n446\n00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.630\nKinda right there, so\nwe can see the tools is really good.\n\n447\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.770\nWe have a secondary site\nserver on the left.\n\n448\n00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.690\nThat's gonna be a child of the primary\nup in the main circle up top.\n\n449\n00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.680\nIt's gonna be having a bidirectional\narrow for communication.\n\n450\n00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.910\nWe have a remote distribution\npoint on the right.\n\n451\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.710\nAgain, another site down below,\nnot a site server, but a site server role,\n\n452\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.920\nspecifically.\n\n453\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.600\nAnd that role is gonna simply act\nas a distribution caching point for\n\n454\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.870\napplication packages\nthat we're gonna deploy.\n\n455\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.650\nSo if we wanna deploy Office,\n\n456\n00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.700\nwe can throw that package into\nthe remote distribution server.\n\n457\n00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.120\nThat server can then effectively\nhave that packaged cached locally.\n\n458\n00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.390\nAnd then can distribute it over\nthe land to the various clients that\n\n459\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.152\nare sitting there.\n\n460\n00:20:58.152 --> 00:21:02.980\nWe're gonna manage those clients from up\ntop in the main site server up above,\n\n461\n00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.825\nbut we're gonna be able to distribute\nsoftware locally, reserving our,\n\n462\n00:21:05.825 --> 00:21:09.228\nconserving bandwidth along the way, which\nthat is gonna be very beneficial to us.\n\n463\n00:21:09.228 --> 00:21:10.820\nSo wanna think about that,\n\n464\n00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.940\nwe have management capabilities\nthere with management points.\n\n465\n00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.200\nOur management point is gonna be sitting\nup on the primary site server up above,\n\n466\n00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.870\nand that is gonna be able to manage\nup to 25,000 clients simultaneously.\n\n467\n00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:27.330\nSo if we have more than 25,000, but less\nthan 100,000, and we have our database\n\n468\n00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.930\nbroken out, we may need several management\npoints, which are site server roles, but\n\n469\n00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.720\nwe don't necessarily need more\nthan one primary site server.\n\n470\n00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.670\nWe may just deploy secondary site server\nmanagement points as a result of that.\n\n471\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.030\nSo we wanna again think about how\nwe're gonna scale all that and\n\n472\n00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.510\nwhat we're gonna be doing there.\n\n473\n00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.670\nAnd then the global organization,\nif we can go to that one, is gonna\n\n474\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.700\neffectively look very similar to what we\njust saw, but we're adding an additional\n\n475\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.720\nlayer of complexity, which is the central\nadministration site up above.\n\n476\n00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.760\nRemember that's where everything is\ngonna roll up to and report up to.\n\n477\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.520\nThat's where we're gonna be focused\non administration centrally,\n\n478\n00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.910\nreporting centrally.\n\n479\n00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.190\nNo client management there directly.\n\n480\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.620\nNo clients assigned there.\n\n481\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.260\nWe're simply gonna be able to have\nvisibility from a reporting and\n\n482\n00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.100\nmanagement perspective.\n\n483\n00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.420\nThink of dashboarding.\n\n484\n00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.190\nThink of being able to run reports.\n\n485\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.770\nThat's really what the CAS, the central\nadmin server is gonna be all about, or\n\n486\n00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:16.870\nadmin site is gonna be all about.\n\n487\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:21.110\nSo we're gonna see that, multi site\nhierarchies are supported and expected.\n\n488\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:26.280\nWe have up to or over, I should say,\n100,000, but up to 400,000, end points.\n\n489\n00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.120\nWe're gonna be looking at this\nkind of architecture where we have\n\n490\n00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.620\nmultiple primary sites linked to\na central admin site with one or\n\n491\n00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.070\nmore secondary sites down\nbelow as child sites.\n\n492\n00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.110\nSo wanna be thinking about that as well.\n\n493\n00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.600\nWhile we're here,\nwe may as well take a look at if we can,\n\n494\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.588\nthe discussion about how data flows and\nreplicates.\n\n495\n00:22:41.588 --> 00:22:42.795\n>> Sure.\n>> So I know we have a diagram for\n\n496\n00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:43.378\nthat as well.\n\n497\n00:22:43.378 --> 00:22:45.202\nWe'll just keep on going with that and\n\n498\n00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:48.964\nI know that we also are gonna have a list\nthat we'll take a look at in just a minute\n\n499\n00:22:48.964 --> 00:22:52.726\nabout some of the things that I'm going\nto mention here, because I'm going to\n\n500\n00:22:52.726 --> 00:22:56.680\nthrow out a bunch of different kinds of\ndata that will flow back and forth here.\n\n501\n00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.470\nWe just want to be sure that we're\naware of how to read the diagram.\n\n502\n00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:03.000\nAnd then Mike's going to put up\nthe actual list for us that I mentioned.\n\n503\n00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.970\nSo don't want you to worry about not\nseeing all the items I'm about to mention,\n\n504\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.718\nbut we are gonna take a look at them and\ntalk about them here briefly.\n\n505\n00:23:09.718 --> 00:23:12.520\nSo up in the top of this,\nyou have the central admin site.\n\n506\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.250\nIt's got a dedicated SQL\ndatabase sitting over there.\n\n507\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.200\nGot two primary sites down below,\ndedicated databases for them.\n\n508\n00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.230\nAnd then below that,\nwe've got a couple of secondary sites, or\n\n509\n00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.630\nat least one secondary site\noff to the left there.\n\n510\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:28.660\nAnd then have a bunch of clients\nthat are gonna be attached to one or\n\n511\n00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.550\nmore primary sites.\n\n512\n00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.590\nAnd you'll see there are some clients\nthat are reporting up through a secondary\n\n513\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.340\nsite down below.\n\n514\n00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.010\nBut, remember,\n\n515\n00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.850\nthose clients at the secondary site\nare actually managed at the primary site.\n\n516\n00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.331\nTheir site code is gonna\nbe the primary site code,\n\n517\n00:23:40.331 --> 00:23:44.160\nnot the secondary site cuz secondary\nsite does not have its own site code.\n\n518\n00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.410\nIt's a child of the primary in effect.\n\n519\n00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.580\nSo we have all that sitting there.\n\n520\n00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.740\nAnd then we have some arrows.\n\n521\n00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.660\nWe have a solid set of arrows.\n\n522\n00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.142\nThose are gonna represent\nglobal data flow.\n\n523\n00:23:53.142 --> 00:23:56.005\nData flow that is gonna go back and\nforth for global data.\n\n524\n00:23:56.005 --> 00:23:59.765\nData that is effectively going to deal\nwith things at the global level of\n\n525\n00:23:59.765 --> 00:24:00.837\nthe organization.\n\n526\n00:24:00.837 --> 00:24:05.403\nThings such as alert rules,\nclient discovery information,\n\n527\n00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:09.882\nconfiguration items meta data,\noperating system images,\n\n528\n00:24:09.882 --> 00:24:15.173\nsite security objects, I'm just\nrandomly rattling off some things.\n\n529\n00:24:15.173 --> 00:24:16.550\nWe can do an HSCM rap.\n\n530\n00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.050\n>> Yeah.\n>> Let's do it.\n\n531\n00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.680\n>> I was gonna say wrapping some things\n\n532\n00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.650\nbut I'm not good enough to rap.\n\n533\n00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.200\nBut we do have global data there and\nwe have a complete list of the things that\n\n534\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.490\nare gonna be classified as global\ndata items and you'll see them there.\n\n535\n00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.720\nAll of these things are the things\nthat are flowing back and\n\n536\n00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.970\nforth across those solid arrows in\nthe diagram and we can see them there.\n\n537\n00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.550\nAnywhere there's a solid arrow,\n\n538\n00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.260\nwe're seeing global data\nitems moving back and forth.\n\n539\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.830\nWe also have some dotted arrows and\n\n540\n00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.950\nI know it's kind of hard to see but\nbetween the primary site server there,\n\n541\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.840\nthere we go between the primary site\nservers and the central admin site.\n\n542\n00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.130\nWe'll see that we have\ndotted arrows moving up.\n\n543\n00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.980\nNotice they are unidirectional, they are\ngoing one way, they are not bidirectional.\n\n544\n00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.520\nAnd those arrows are gonna\nrepresent site data.\n\n545\n00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.070\nAnd I know we have a list for\nsite data as well, we can see them there.\n\n546\n00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:03.180\nThings like alert messages, client\nhealth data, client health history data,\n\n547\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.310\nstatus messages,\nnotice our inventory data is there.\n\n548\n00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.110\nSo this is the kind of stuff that moves\nfrom primary sites up to the central admin\n\n549\n00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.140\nsite with regards to being able to\naggregate for reporting and management.\n\n550\n00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.280\nThis is all considered site data.\n\n551\n00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.030\nIt would be a good idea for\nyou to be able to differentiate\n\n552\n00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.590\nbetween what is global data and\nwhat is site data and\n\n553\n00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.880\nmaybe we just wanna make sure we have the\nglobal data up again, just for a minute.\n\n554\n00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.570\nJust so as people review over\ntime they can see a list.\n\n555\n00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.770\nYou obviously can go out and Google for\nthis list if you're not seeing it here for\n\n556\n00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.410\nany reason able to capture it all.\n\n557\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:36.920\nIt's the kind of stuff you\ncan obviously look for and\n\n558\n00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.710\nget on the web but we just wanna make\nsure you're comfortable with that, you\n\n559\n00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.610\nhave a sense of that you're aware of what\nthose two particular designations are.\n\n560\n00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.400\nIt's very important for\nus to be thinking about that.\n\n561\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.110\nSo anything that is gonna move globally\nmoving back and forth with the solid\n\n562\n00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.520\narrows, effectively administrator\ncreated objects are global if you\n\n563\n00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.640\nthink about them this way and those are\ngonna move throughout the site hierarchy.\n\n564\n00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.900\nThere is a subset of those that goes down,\nyou could see a one headed arrow, or\n\n565\n00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.700\nunidirectional arrow coming from the\nprimary site, down to the secondary site,\n\n566\n00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.400\ngoing one way.\n\n567\n00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.140\nI know you actually asked me about\nthis when we were setting this up.\n\n568\n00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.240\nAnd said,\nhey why is it a uno-directional arrow.\n\n569\n00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.920\nWhy is it not bidirectional?\n\n570\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:19.190\nAnd the main reason we see uno-directional\narrow in this particular diagram\n\n571\n00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:23.945\nis because we see a subset of that global\ndata information that's at the primary\n\n572\n00:26:23.945 --> 00:26:28.385\nsite be delivered down to the secondary\nsite for the secondary site to be able to\n\n573\n00:26:28.385 --> 00:26:31.855\nhave access to it ,so it can manage and\nit can work with the clients that are down\n\n574\n00:26:31.855 --> 00:26:36.290\nthere for distribution purposes and\nto then aggregate that and report back up.\n\n575\n00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.800\nBut the secondary site does not\n\n576\n00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.600\nget a complete set of those global\ndata elements from the primary site.\n\n577\n00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.600\nSo that's why we see the one way\narrow because it represents the flow\n\n578\n00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.060\nof that subset of global data\ndown to the secondary site.\n\n579\n00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.780\n>> Very good.\n>> Good question.\n\n580\n00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.150\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's good that you picked up on that.\n\n581\n00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.090\nSite data is operational\ninformation as we mentioned and\n\n582\n00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.170\nthat's what's going up as you could see\nin the unidirectional arrows heading up.\n\n583\n00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.660\nSo we just want to be thinking about that\nand make sure we're comfortable with that.\n\n584\n00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.140\nIt's also gonna be something\nthat from our perspective.\n\n585\n00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.120\nWant to make sure we have a sense of\nbecause it becomes very important for\n\n586\n00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.740\nus to understand how data flows, how it\nmove within the organizational structure.\n\n587\n00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.300\nNow keep in mind if we have a single\nprimary site and that's it right, and\n\n588\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.730\na lot of clients will\nultimately go this way.\n\n589\n00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:23.210\nIf we have a single primary site and\nwe have nothing else associated with it\n\n590\n00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.980\njust one server where\ndoes the global data go?\n\n591\n00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.920\nWhere does the site data go?\n\n592\n00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.120\nDo we even differentiate?\n\n593\n00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.060\nWe don't everything is there.\n\n594\n00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.100\nIt's not going anywhere because\nit all sits on that one server.\n\n595\n00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.950\nThere's no replication,\n\n596\n00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.410\nthere's no movement, there's no management\nthat occurs outside that server.\n\n597\n00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.260\nSo this conversation is all about\nhaving a multi site hierarchy.\n\n598\n00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.930\nWant to make sure we differentiate that\nfor you because it is important to know\n\n599\n00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.180\nthat if there is a multi-site hierarchy,\nwe have to then understand where data is,\n\n600\n00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.760\nwhat kind of data we're talking about and\nhow it flows.\n\n601\n00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.510\nIn a single site hierarchy\nwhich is one machine,\n\n602\n00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.440\nwe're still concerned about global vs\nsite data but it's all in the same place.\n\n603\n00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.560\nWe just want to be able to\ndifferentiate what it is so we know,\n\n604\n00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.192\nwhen we talk about alert rules\nvs alert data which is which.\n\n605\n00:28:02.192 --> 00:28:06.120\nThroughout it all stays in the same place,\nit's all on the same server and\n\n606\n00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.775\nin no point during this demonstration\ndo my hands ever leave my body.\n\n607\n00:28:08.775 --> 00:28:10.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's why Mike's controlling\n\n608\n00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.570\neverything by the way, so\nkeep that in mind as well right?\n\n609\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.480\nWe kid around here a lot, but if we didn't\nwe'd go crazy and then of course you\n\n610\n00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.920\nwouldn't be able to hear anything from us,\ncuz we'd be babbling all the time.\n\n611\n00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.340\n>> It's all about Edutainment.\n\n612\n00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.741\n>> It's all about Edutainment, absolutely.\n\n613\n00:28:21.741 --> 00:28:22.966\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just wanna make sure we're aware of\n\n614\n00:28:22.966 --> 00:28:24.020\nthat, we're thinking about that as well.\n\n615\n00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.310\nWell now you want to\ntalk a bit about tools.\n\n616\n00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.530\nConfiguration management tools and\nsome of the support tools and\n\n617\n00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.390\nI know that I'd asked you Mike to put a\ncouple of URLs up or some searches up for\n\n618\n00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:33.850\nus that we're going to take a look at.\n\n619\n00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.550\nSo we can go to Mike's machine for\njust a second.\n\n620\n00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.070\nI want to just give you guys some\nadditional information that will\n\n621\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.620\nbe helpful for you.\n\n622\n00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.530\nIf you can just zoom in a little bit,\nso I can see which one this is,\n\n623\n00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.086\ncuz although my eyes are good\nthey're not that good.\n\n624\n00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:44.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I believe at the top here that's one\n\n625\n00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.640\nabout planning worksheets.\n\n626\n00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.860\n>> This is planning worksheets, yep.\n\n627\n00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.160\n>> So if you out there, all of you\nlistening and ultimately watching us and\n\n628\n00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160\nyou could do this for yourselves.\n\n629\n00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.520\nWhich is why I had Mike\npreload the search for us and\n\n630\n00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.000\nwe want to focus in on the Google\nquery for just a minute.\n\n631\n00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.170\nNotice we did sccm 2012 planning\nworksheet or worksheets.\n\n632\n00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.310\nYou can do it either way.\n\n633\n00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:05.030\nWhen you do that and\nyou scroll down you will see right there,\n\n634\n00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.610\nyou will see we have several hits.\n\n635\n00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.100\nNow I wanna differentiate this for you.\n\n636\n00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.710\nI don't want you to click,\nI just wanna tell people what they see.\n\n637\n00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:15.025\nThose first two items that say Config\nManager Planning Worksheets, it's TechNet.\n\n638\n00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:16.605\nSounds really cool and exciting.\n\n639\n00:29:16.605 --> 00:29:17.275\nYou get all excited.\n\n640\n00:29:17.275 --> 00:29:18.265\nWow, I got planning worksheets.\n\n641\n00:29:18.265 --> 00:29:18.935\nThese are cool.\n\n642\n00:29:18.935 --> 00:29:20.285\nMicrosoft puts these out.\n\n643\n00:29:20.285 --> 00:29:21.275\nProbably helpful.\n\n644\n00:29:21.275 --> 00:29:22.565\nUsually a spreadsheet.\n\n645\n00:29:22.565 --> 00:29:23.575\nI can open it up.\n\n646\n00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:24.735\nIt's been preset for me.\n\n647\n00:29:24.735 --> 00:29:27.870\nI put some numbers in as many of these\nplanning worksheets are set up and\n\n648\n00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:31.310\nas a result of that just some\ncalculations spits out on the back end.\n\n649\n00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.180\nMore or less configuration I need.\n\n650\n00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.370\nAnd if you're thinking along those lines,\nyou would absolutely correct but\n\n651\n00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:37.502\nonly if you're running 2007.\n\n652\n00:29:37.502 --> 00:29:40.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Those links will take in the 2007\n\n653\n00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.290\nversions of those planning worksheets.\n\n654\n00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.426\nNow this is interesting and\nthis is what I call a Microsoft-ism.\n\n655\n00:29:45.426 --> 00:29:47.070\nMicrosoft-ism is just that.\n\n656\n00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.150\nSomething that Microsoft does but\nnobody quite knows why.\n\n657\n00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.620\nSo there area planning worksheets for\nthe 2007 series.\n\n658\n00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.210\nYou like that one.\n\n659\n00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.210\nYou can use that by the way.\n\n660\n00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:55.900\n>> I'm going to steal it.\n\n661\n00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.480\n>> Microsoft-ism, so there are planning\nworksheets for the planning 2007 series.\n\n662\n00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.690\nAll they way up through R3 and\nI'll let you know a little secret.\n\n663\n00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.290\nI cheat I still use those\neven though I do most of my\n\n664\n00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.230\nwork these days in 2012, 2012 R2.\n\n665\n00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:10.150\nI've adjusted them accordingly\n,so that I can use them.\n\n666\n00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.730\nYou would have to do some work to\nchange the values and expand them for\n\n667\n00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.190\nuse but it's possible.\n\n668\n00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.260\nBut I want you to know is that when you go\nthere you will clearly see that it says,\n\n669\n00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.040\nhey these are for 2007,\n2007 R1 or R2 and R3.\n\n670\n00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.660\nThere's no mention to 2012 ,2012 SP1,\n2012 R2.\n\n671\n00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.480\nNow that third item down,\nagain, don't click.\n\n672\n00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.050\nI'm just pointing out configuration\nmanager planning checklist.\n\n673\n00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.520\nThat is also from TechNet.\n\n674\n00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.680\nThat one is actually going to,\ngo ahead and hold down the shift key and\n\n675\n00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.510\nclick on that one ,so we\ncan open a separate window.\n\n676\n00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:43.810\nLet's just take a look at that\none real quick for a second.\n\n677\n00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:44.970\nSo what that one's going to do as,\n\n678\n00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.630\nsoon as it comes up is that's\ngoing to give us a nice checklist.\n\n679\n00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:54.210\nIf you zoom in for just a second you'll\nsee that that one is for 2007 only.\n\n680\n00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.060\nIt says 2007 R2, R3 up top.\n\n681\n00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.310\nNow if you scroll down it will go through,\njust go down just a little bit,\n\n682\n00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.110\nit goes through and\nit talks about all of the planning stuff.\n\n683\n00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.730\nSo I'll let you in on\nanother little secret,\n\n684\n00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.590\nagain 85% of the planning associated with\nthis from the background perspective and\n\n685\n00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.360\nI'll have to let you see the links for\nall those steps right?\n\n686\n00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.780\nThe general thought process around this\nplanning checklist is still accurate.\n\n687\n00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.120\nIn other words the general\nidea of planning,\n\n688\n00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.750\ngeneral idea of understanding\nyour active directory typology.\n\n689\n00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.030\nGeneral idea of understanding your\nsequel server deployments currently\n\n690\n00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.160\nof scaling your hardware,\n\n691\n00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.240\nof understanding what you're gonna do\nall that still holds true in 2012.\n\n692\n00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.420\nYou just have to obviously understand that\ncertain links and certain things here\n\n693\n00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.270\nare only gonna be specific to 2007 and\nthey may not make sense to you.\n\n694\n00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.780\nSo I'm just trying to point out\nwhat's there and how you can use it.\n\n695\n00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.110\nIf you're able to filter through it.\n\n696\n00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.280\nIf we can kill that one and\nthere's one more right below,\n\n697\n00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.840\nI also want to show the people,\nso we go back to.\n\n698\n00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.012\nSo the one right below, sizing calculator\nyou don't have to click on it.\n\n699\n00:31:48.012 --> 00:31:51.315\nThe sizing calculator, or\nyou could click on it.\n\n700\n00:31:51.315 --> 00:31:52.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, if you did, no big deal.\n\n701\n00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:56.547\nThere's just a down, when you go there,\nthere's a discussion there.\n\n702\n00:31:56.547 --> 00:32:00.234\nIt says, hey this is one of those social\nTechNet Blog postings, where somebody\n\n703\n00:32:00.234 --> 00:32:03.589\nsays, hey I have this problem and\nthen a bunch of people chime in and say,\n\n704\n00:32:03.589 --> 00:32:05.644\nhe I have this or that and\nthis will help you.\n\n705\n00:32:05.644 --> 00:32:08.548\nSo when you go there there isn't\nactually a sizing calculator,\n\n706\n00:32:08.548 --> 00:32:10.630\ncause I get this question all the time.\n\n707\n00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.590\nI saw this thing there's\na sizing calculator.\n\n708\n00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.400\nNo there's not,\nthere's a post that says I wish there one.\n\n709\n00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.440\nWhat there is however\nis some guidance there.\n\n710\n00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.810\nYou gotta read the fine print,\nthat's what's important.\n\n711\n00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.460\nThere is a post there and\nif you follow, and\n\n712\n00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.920\nactually if you click on it for a second.\n\n713\n00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.240\nLet's just show the nice people there.\n\n714\n00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.350\nScroll down, and\nthere is a post right below in the answer.\n\n715\n00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:32.310\nThe first of those two links which says\nthis is the size and calculator available,\n\n716\n00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:36.560\nwhatever, click on that one and that one\nis gonna take us out to tech net and\n\n717\n00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.750\nwhat that's gonna show us\nat tech net is planning for\n\n718\n00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.680\nhardware configs for config manager, etc.\n\n719\n00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.210\nYou'll notice this one is for 2012 so\nif you go to this particular one, and\n\n720\n00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:50.550\nI think we'll give you that URL this is\ngonna give you all the information you\n\n721\n00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:54.180\nneed specifically to be able to do\nthe planning, and the assessment, and\n\n722\n00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.630\nthe look ahead to do the hey,\nwhat if scenarios around\n\n723\n00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.780\nplanning, that you need for\n2012, 2012 SP1, 2012 R2.\n\n724\n00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.370\nNow the other nice thing about this is,\n\n725\n00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:07.400\nthis is also going to give you\nthe information you need to prepare for\n\n726\n00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.570\nthe exam because we're going to ask you\nquestions about hardware configurations,\n\n727\n00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:17.030\nabout minimums, about what would happen in\nthis scenario, what's going on with this,\n\n728\n00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.360\ncan I employ the product\ngiven this configuration.\n\n729\n00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.990\nAnd you're gonna have\nto know those things.\n\n730\n00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:25.120\nThis is one of those websites, and\nagain, this is Microsoft's own website,\n\n731\n00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.030\nright I wanna be clear,\nthis is coming directly from the source.\n\n732\n00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.720\nThis is the authoritative\nvoice you want to listen to.\n\n733\n00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.190\nI mention there's a lot of\nother good stuff out there,\n\n734\n00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.260\nthat people have put together.\n\n735\n00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.730\nS-C-C-M gurus, Win New.\n\n736\n00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.035\nThere's a whole bunch of different sites.\n\n737\n00:33:40.035 --> 00:33:40.560\n>> Um-hm.\n>> You go out to.\n\n738\n00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.130\nYou see a lot of people\nposting on these things.\n\n739\n00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.660\nAnd a lot of that information\nis 100% accurate as well,\n\n740\n00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.980\nat least from the primary sites,\nthe ones that are really good.\n\n741\n00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.710\nBut it's always better\nto go to the source.\n\n742\n00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.190\nIf you can get it directly from Microsoft,\nthat's what's gonna be the most recent and\n\n743\n00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.200\nobviously the more authoritative.\n\n744\n00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.015\nCan you scroll down there for\nme for just a minute.\n\n745\n00:33:56.015 --> 00:33:56.680\n>> Um-hm.\n\n746\n00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.190\n>> And, keep going.\n\n747\n00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.190\nSo keep going.\n\n748\n00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.520\nYeah, right there.\nSo, all right, so go to Site Servers,\n\n749\n00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.370\nclick on Site Servers.\n\n750\n00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:04.430\nDrop that arrow down.\n\n751\n00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.890\nWhat you're gonna see, can we kill the\npicture in picture for just a second so\n\n752\n00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.220\nwe could see the full screen?\n\n753\n00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.050\nJust so we can see it.\n\n754\n00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.950\nThere we go, thank you.\n\n755\n00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.220\nSo what you're gonna see there in\nparticular, off to the right and it says,\n\n756\n00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.930\nfor instance, on the left side details.\n\n757\n00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.760\nCentral admin server site\nwith SQL edition Standard.\n\n758\n00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.080\nAnd then it's going to give you the\nhardware suggested minimum configurations.\n\n759\n00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.570\nYou're going to have a build guide here in\neffect that tells you what your building\n\n760\n00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.890\non the left with what configuration\nof the site role and the database.\n\n761\n00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:31.680\nAnd then on the right exactly\nwhat the configuration\n\n762\n00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.350\nneeds to be from a hardware perspective.\n\n763\n00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.480\nI E, you have everything you need.\n\n764\n00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.350\nSee how we did that by the way?\n\n765\n00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.440\nMicrosoft IE.\n\n766\n00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.270\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n767\n00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:40.339\n>> Actually I should have done\n\n768\n00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:40.948\nedge, right.\n\n769\n00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:45.970\nEdge becomes the new IE, depending on\nwhich version of Microsoft you're running.\n\n770\n00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:49.710\nSo what you have there is the actual\nguidance that you will need,\n\n771\n00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.390\nnot only to do this in the real world.\n\n772\n00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:54.130\nThis is equally important for\nthe real world, very important.\n\n773\n00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:57.320\nBut you're also gonna have the guidance\nyou need to prepare for the exam, right.\n\n774\n00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.400\nSo, definitely want to\ntake advantage of this,\n\n775\n00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.440\ntake a look at this, gonna be really\ncritical, really important for\n\n776\n00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.840\nus to have knowledge of that and\nbe aware of that, okay.\n\n777\n00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.060\nAnd then there was the other one.\n\n778\n00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.230\nSorry we do need to go back, I apologize.\n\n779\n00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.970\nIt's a premature removal there.\n\n780\n00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.330\nSo if we can go back there\nwas one other of the.\n\n781\n00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.520\nIn the search results or the.\n\n782\n00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.470\n>> The search, yeah, no the Google query,\nthe other Google query.\n\n783\n00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:21.290\n>> No, not that one.\n\n784\n00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.600\nYeah the other one.\n\n785\n00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.660\nThere yeah, we'd loaded two and\nthis one is System Center 2012 prereqs.\n\n786\n00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.560\nAnd what I wanted you to see is to\nunderstand what prerequisites are gonna be\n\n787\n00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.750\nnecessary to install System Center.\n\n788\n00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.450\nWe're going to come back and\ndo this as we do our walk-through for\n\n789\n00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.780\nthe actual installation.\n\n790\n00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.300\nWe're going to do a full live\ninstallation of the product.\n\n791\n00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.600\nWe're going to take a look at that but I'm\njust going to give you this hint here now.\n\n792\n00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.400\nThere is one tool I want you to at least\nthink about download and looking at.\n\n793\n00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.790\nClick on that top link, which is\nTechNet Config Manager Prereq tool.\n\n794\n00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.590\nThis is currently version 1.4.1.\n\n795\n00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.320\nThe version varies.\n\n796\n00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.580\nIt gets updated every so often.\n\n797\n00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.930\nSo if you go out there six months from\nnow whenever you actually watch this.\n\n798\n00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.580\nAnd if you see that there's\na newer version of the tool when\n\n799\n00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.520\nyou look at the link.\n\n800\n00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.030\nDon't be surprised, no big deal.\n\n801\n00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.596\nAs long as the version\ndoesn't go backwards.\n\n802\n00:36:05.596 --> 00:36:06.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You look at it and\n\n803\n00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.950\nit's like suddenly version 1.2 again.\n\n804\n00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:09.930\nThat might be a problem.\n\n805\n00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.310\nYou may not be in the right place.\n\n806\n00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:16.060\nBut we're at version 1.4.1 right now,\nyou can see this for 2012 R2 for\n\n807\n00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:21.950\nthe hierarchy, I think this was posted\nearlier back in August in 2015.\n\n808\n00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.350\nSo just keep in mind it\ndoes update every so often.\n\n809\n00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.990\nThis tool can be downloaded and broken out\nseparately from the installation media.\n\n810\n00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.740\nThis is the tool that\nruns the prereq check for\n\n811\n00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:34.290\nyou and tells you whether your system is\nconfigured, has all the software you need.\n\n812\n00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.610\nYou know how many prerequisite\nsoftware items and\n\n813\n00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:40.920\nconfiguration issues of concerns you have\nto address to Systems Center ConfigMgr.\n\n814\n00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.840\n>> Actually, more than 12.\n\n815\n00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.782\n>> More than 12.\nYou're spot on.\n\n816\n00:36:42.782 --> 00:36:44.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're on fire today.\n\n817\n00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.290\nOn fire, you are, sir.\n\n818\n00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.030\nThere are more than 12.\n\n819\n00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:51.260\nThere are 56 prereqs we have to download\nand configure, in one form or another.\n\n820\n00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.160\nThere was software and\nthings we have to do.\n\n821\n00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:53.800\nSo this tool.\n>> Right.\n\n822\n00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.870\n>> Is gonna help us go through all that.\n\n823\n00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:55.780\n>> Yes.\n>> Why do I know that?\n\n824\n00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.880\nBecause I don't get out much.\n\n825\n00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.785\nI need a hobby.\n\n826\n00:36:57.785 --> 00:36:59.140\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> That's why I know that.\n\n827\n00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.275\nIf any of you know that,\nyou should get out more and get a hobby.\n\n828\n00:37:02.275 --> 00:37:04.160\n>> [LAUGH.\n>> You should not be watching these videos\n\n829\n00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.270\non a regular basis.\n\n830\n00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:08.670\nAll right, so ConfigMgr prereq tool\nis obviously really important.\n\n831\n00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:12.450\nI get asked this a lot by clients\nas well as by students, hey,\n\n832\n00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:15.480\nwe run this prereq thing in the software,\nbut can I use it later as a tool?\n\n833\n00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.550\nCan I break that out?\n\n834\n00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.480\nIs it available separately?\n\n835\n00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.790\nAnswer is absolutely.\n\n836\n00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:23.490\nThere's also another link right below\nthis one if we go back to the query\n\n837\n00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.100\nI don't know if you do the back,\nso that one right below.\n\n838\n00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.741\nSystem Requirements for\nSystem Center 2012, we can go there.\n\n839\n00:37:32.317 --> 00:37:35.210\nAll right, so this is gonna give\nus all of the system requirements.\n\n840\n00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.660\nIf you can scroll down a little,\nyou'll see all the different topics there,\n\n841\n00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.790\nHardware Requirements,\nServer Operating System Requirements.\n\n842\n00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.970\nWe don't have to click on anything,\njust all in there, right.\n\n843\n00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.710\nSo you can see all of them broken out.\n\n844\n00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.490\nIt's gonna give us everything we need to\nknow, if we're gonna do the self-service\n\n845\n00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.630\nweb console, language support,\nget asked about that a lot.\n\n846\n00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.290\nCan we do some multiple languages?\n\n847\n00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.500\nAnswer is absolutely,\nany language we have.\n\n848\n00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.640\nNative core support for\nthe operating system, we can install and\n\n849\n00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.305\nuse against, well that's also usually\nsomething that comes up on exams a lot\n\n850\n00:38:01.305 --> 00:38:02.600\nMulti-language supports.\n\n851\n00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.880\nYou want to know that.\n\n852\n00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.330\nI prefer Mandarin Chinese personally,\nbut that's just me, all right, so.\n\n853\n00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.610\nGo back there is one more link there\nas well we also want to take a look at\n\n854\n00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.640\nwhich is the one right below that.\n\n855\n00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.070\nWhich is supported configs for\nconfig manager.\n\n856\n00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:18.710\nSo again notice I'm calling\nthe ones off the top of that list\n\n857\n00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:21.380\nthat are going to be specific to TechNet.\n\n858\n00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.100\nThere are some ones below that\nare from third party people.\n\n859\n00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.350\nA lot of them are good, but I tend to\nrecommend the ones that I mentioned\n\n860\n00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.755\nalready from Microsoft because\nthose are authoritative.\n\n861\n00:38:29.755 --> 00:38:31.940\nAnd as long as you're dealing with them,\n\n862\n00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.050\nusually information is gonna be\naccurate more often than not.\n\n863\n00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.450\nSo wanna just make sure we're\ntaking a look at these,\n\n864\n00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.390\ngiving you the opportunity\nto see what they are and\n\n865\n00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:41.400\njust making sure that you're familiar\nwith what's out there, right.\n\n866\n00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.825\nSo it is gonna be very valuable.\n\n867\n00:38:42.825 --> 00:38:44.975\n>> All right Adam, and\nagain another great episode.\n\n868\n00:38:44.975 --> 00:38:47.865\nA lot of information when it\ncomes to the architecture of\n\n869\n00:38:47.865 --> 00:38:50.615\nSystem Center Configuration Manager,\na lot of options, but\n\n870\n00:38:50.615 --> 00:38:51.855\nthe information is out there.\n\n871\n00:38:51.855 --> 00:38:55.637\nAdam's shown us where we can go to find\nthat information if we're doing this for\n\n872\n00:38:55.637 --> 00:38:59.227\nourselves, real world or for\npreparing for that exam.\n\n873\n00:38:59.227 --> 00:39:00.587\nSo go out there, take advantage of that.\n\n874\n00:39:00.587 --> 00:39:03.587\nWe'll make sure we get all of those\nlinks posted up in the show notes for\n\n875\n00:39:03.587 --> 00:39:05.397\nthese episodes for you as well.\n\n876\n00:39:05.397 --> 00:39:09.557\nAll right, remember, if you guys ever want\nto attend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n877\n00:39:09.557 --> 00:39:11.377\nyou can do that by\nshooting us an email here,\n\n878\n00:39:11.377 --> 00:39:16.677\nwe can get you in

00:00:17.678\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\n\n4\n00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:22.076\ntoday we're doing our Systems Center\nConfiguration Manager 2012 R2.\n\n5\n00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:23.519\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.045\nwe're gonna look at installing Systems\nCenter Configuration Manager 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.554\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I really should short\n\n8\n00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:30.300\nthat out, shouldn't I?\n\n9\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.450\nBut, yeah,\nwe're gonna take a look at installing.\n\n10\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.900\nOver the first couple of episodes,\n\n11\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.120\nwe've looked at architectures and we've\ntalked about the importance of planning.\n\n12\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.380\nAnd Adam mentioned 90% of it is\ngetting ready, planning everything,\n\n13\n00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.680\nsetting everything up.\n\n14\n00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.110\nBut then, obviously at some point\nwe've gotta get it installed so\n\n15\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.690\nwe can start playing with it or\nusing it in a production environment.\n\n16\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.090\nSo, that's what we're gonna do next, and\nhere to help us with that of course is Mr.\n\n17\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.730\nAdam Gordon.\n\n18\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.980\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n19\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.650\n>> Good, good, very good,\nvery good, thank you.\n\n20\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.720\nSo, I just have a quick question for\nMike if we could,\n\n21\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.016\nif we can do this for a second.\n\n22\n00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:03.660\nJust cuz I'm curious, I sit and\nlisten to Mike's great intros,\n\n23\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.240\nthey are great almost as great\nas his drawings by the way.\n\n24\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.180\nSo I listen to them every time\nwe do one of these episodes.\n\n25\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.520\nWe've done quite a number of them for\nalready with System Center Config Manager.\n\n26\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.670\nWe're coming off a rather\nlong run on CISSP.\n\n27\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.390\nDid a huge,\n\n28\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.750\nhuge amount of the episodes for that and\nevery one of them without exception.\n\n29\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.620\nMike says it is an exciting episode.\n\n30\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.280\nI've yet to see one that's not exciting.\n\n31\n00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.640\nI think that's because I'm here and I have\ncool socks, but that could just be me.\n\n32\n00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.545\n>> It is, it is, can we see the socks?\n\n33\n00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:34.692\n>> We didn't see the socks yet\ntoday, yeah, I've got what are they?\n\n34\n00:01:34.692 --> 00:01:36.939\n>> Got some yellows?\n>> They are yellow with kinda an Aztec,\n\n35\n00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.371\nIndian-ish kind of pattern, greenish and\nturquoise, a little blue, and\n\n36\n00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:44.722\nsome black in there\n>> If I've got an SMV wearing socks like\n\n37\n00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:47.663\nthat how can it not be exciting\n>> I mean you can see them on the screen\n\n38\n00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:50.180\nwhen you're looking at me right there\nyou can see it's like they stand out.\n\n39\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.940\nYou can see there's yellow behind me but\n\n40\n00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.670\nI'm tying the whole theme\nof the entire set in.\n\n41\n00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.180\nIt's magnificent, is what it is.\n\n42\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.662\n>> He plans all this out weeks ahead.\n\n43\n00:01:57.662 --> 00:01:59.713\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, it's exciting as I was saying, so,\n\n44\n00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:01.319\nmy point with this whole,\n\n45\n00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.446\nkind of just merge to the left-\n>> Segway, yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:05.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> And totally off to the side not\n\n47\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.990\nrelated to what we're\nhere to talk about is\n\n48\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.370\nhas there ever been an episode\nthat wasn't exciting?\n\n49\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.110\n>> I don't think so.\n\n50\n00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930\n>> Okay.\n>> I love this stuff so much, I mean,\n\n51\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.800\nwhen you say Systems Center\nConfiguration Manager, I get excited.\n\n52\n00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.520\nI know I'm a geek like that, but, yeah.\n\n53\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.440\nNo, they're all exciting and\n\n54\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.565\nespecially If I've got you on\nthe other side of the podium.\n\n55\n00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:23.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> Flattery will get you everywhere.\n\n56\n00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.610\nAll right, so, boys and\ngirls, let us begin.\n\n57\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.750\nSo what we're gonna do for you now, and\n\n58\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.560\nwhat we are gonna do during this\nepisode is something special.\n\n59\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.100\nWe're gonna do this several times\nthroughout our discussions together,\n\n60\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.410\nwe're gonna do a live lab.\n\n61\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.600\nWhat I'm effectively gonna do is\nwalk us through an installation of\n\n62\n00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.570\nSystem Center Config Manager 2012\n>> R2\n\n63\n00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.370\n>> Thank you very much, so\n\n64\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.065\n2012 R2 [LAUGH] we\nare gonna go through that.\n\n65\n00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:47.440\nWe're gonna go through top to bottom,\nwe're gonna ask for\n\n66\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.820\nyour indulgence a little bit, a little\nprequel to what we're gonna be doing.\n\n67\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.120\nSome of these steps are will take\na little bit of time to complete.\n\n68\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.180\nWe may cut away from some of them,\ntalk for a little bit, come back and\n\n69\n00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.540\nuse the magic of time lapse photography.\n\n70\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.519\nAnd time travel to speed up your\nexperience here in the wonderful\n\n71\n00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.074\nworld of SCCM 2012.\n\n72\n00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:04.830\n>> How about R2.\n\n73\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.170\n>> Thank you very much, so\nwe're going to go ahead,\n\n74\n00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.330\nwe're going to jump into my machine.\n\n75\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.280\nDon't want you to be scared, you're going\nto hear my disembodied voice from now on.\n\n76\n00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.308\nYou're not going to see me very often\nbecause we want to maximize the amount of\n\n77\n00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:17.930\nstuff you're able to see on the screen\nas opposed to looking at me.\n\n78\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.880\nSo just want to make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n79\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.790\nBut I'm gonna tell you where we are,\nwhat we're gonna do, and\n\n80\n00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.910\nhow we're gonna do this.\n\n81\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.770\nI am gonna zoom in for you because I\ndo understand also that being able to\n\n82\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.650\nsee the detail is gonna be\ncritical to your comfort level and\n\n83\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.510\nyour ability to be able to\nfollow what we're doing.\n\n84\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.559\nI've also taken advantage of\nthe opportunity to pre-load some software\n\n85\n00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:38.340\nand/or open up some consoles, and\nI'll explain what they are as we jump in.\n\n86\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.040\nBut I'm gonna assume a little bit\nof prior knowledge on your part.\n\n87\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.631\nAssume that you're comfortable\nwith navigating to certain areas\n\n88\n00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.516\nin certain respects.\n\n89\n00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:47.078\nThat'll also help speed up\nour process a little bit.\n\n90\n00:03:47.078 --> 00:03:49.930\nWe'll also be probably stopping and\ntalking about what I'm gonna do and\n\n91\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.710\nactually doing it,\nwill also help speed up the process, too.\n\n92\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.910\nSo I should probably do that now, probably\nsomething that we should get started with.\n\n93\n00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.290\nAll right, so what we're gonna do right\nnow is, and I'm gonna zoom in just so\n\n94\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.229\nyou can see where we are.\n\n95\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.368\nI'm going to move over so\nyou can actually see this.\n\n96\n00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:05.720\nI am gonna be on the play build machine\n\n97\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.270\nwhich is gonna be the machine that we're\ngonna use to set up all the prereqs.\n\n98\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.390\nAnd then ultimately do\nthe installation of SCCM.\n\n99\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.040\nSo, we're gonna get that up and\nrunning here.\n\n100\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.870\nWe're gonna jump to our domain\ncontroller in a little bit which is this\n\n101\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.300\nmachine right above me and\nthe selector there.\n\n102\n00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.290\nWe're going to be some\nschema modification there,\n\n103\n00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.210\ndoing the extension to schema, and setting\nup that systems management container that\n\n104\n00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.670\nwe took a look at back in the intro\nthat I was talking about.\n\n105\n00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.090\nWe're gonna get all that done here as\nwell, so we're gonna start by going in\n\n106\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.940\nto the add rules and features\nwizard right here on this machine.\n\n107\n00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.610\nI've done that or\nopened that up by being able to go in\n\n108\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.890\nGoing up to the Manage menu\nfrom the Server Manager and\n\n109\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.770\nI've just simply chosen out of that\nmenu the Add Roles and Features Wizard.\n\n110\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.390\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to now\n\n111\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.260\nmake some selections about installing\ncertain prereqs, specifically configuring,\n\n112\n00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.233\ninstalling and configuring IIS and\ngetting some of the prereqs required and\n\n113\n00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:58.530\nthe configuration required\nto do that out of the way.\n\n114\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.040\nSo I'm gonna narrate as we go and\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n115\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.650\nwe're going to do the following.\n\n116\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.780\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm going to start the wizard off.\n\n117\n00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.140\nWe are going to skip past\nthe before you begin,\n\n118\n00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.580\nmake sure you read all the stuff on the\nscreen, screen because we're all experts,\n\n119\n00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.740\nwe've done this before and\nwe don't need to worry about that.\n\n120\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.815\nOn the second screen,\nwe are doing a role-based or\n\n121\n00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:19.020\nfeature-based install,\nwhich is the default choice at the top,\n\n122\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.230\nnot the Remote Desktop Services\nInstallation, as you can see there.\n\n123\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.640\nWe wanna make sure we\nare choosing to install or\n\n124\n00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.890\nconfigure new features,\nnot doing an RDP based solution.\n\n125\n00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.000\nThat's effectively gonna allow us to host\nour remote desktop services in an app\n\n126\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.570\nscenario.\n\n127\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.220\nWe are now gonna select\na server from the server pool,\n\n128\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.750\nthe server we're gonna select is\nthe default server that's there.\n\n129\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.030\nIt's the PLAYBUILD server\nthat we have preloaded.\n\n130\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.860\nNow in the real world,\n\n131\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.330\nlet's just talk about what's gonna\nhappen in the real world for a minute.\n\n132\n00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.108\nBecause, obviously in the lab\nenvironment we've set up for\n\n133\n00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:50.350\nyou this is gonna be\nconfigured appropriately.\n\n134\n00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.760\nWe've got machines already setup.\n\n135\n00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.930\nWe've got ip addresses declared.\n\n136\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.020\nWe've got naming conventions established.\n\n137\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.120\nYeah, we know all that stuff and it's all\nthere and don't have to do any guess work.\n\n138\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.950\nWe just have everything and it kinda\nworks, at least we hope it works anyway.\n\n139\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.614\n>> We hope.\n[LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:03.672\n>> Obviously, see whether or\n\n141\n00:06:03.672 --> 00:06:07.095\nnot that happens, but we've kinda cheated\na little bit in the sense that we already\n\n142\n00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:08.800\nall the things that are gonna go on.\n\n143\n00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.880\nAnd we have them all\nkind of accounted for.\n\n144\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.830\nIn the real world that\nmay not be the case, for\n\n145\n00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.340\ninstance, the name of your machine\nis gonna clearly be different.\n\n146\n00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.800\nThe IP address is gonna\nmost likely be different.\n\n147\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.260\nYou'll notice we are using server 2012\nR2 standard off to the right under OS\n\n148\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.100\nto host this.\n\n149\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.560\nYou may be using Data Center for 2012 R2\nfor instance in an enterprise environment.\n\n150\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.100\nSo, things may be different,\nthat really doesn't matter.\n\n151\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.540\nWhat matters is the general thought\nprocess, the individuality or specificity\n\n152\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.410\nwith certain step will clearly have to be\nmodified to fit your particular needs.\n\n153\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.250\nTake notice of that, obviously\nremember that the general idea is for\n\n154\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.470\nyou to understand the steps and\nthen fill in the blanks.\n\n155\n00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.000\nIn other words, with your details\nas we go, just to be clear.\n\n156\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.450\nAll right, so\nwe've got our machine selected there.\n\n157\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.255\nWe're then going to go ahead and\nwe're going to get to our roles,\n\n158\n00:06:57.255 --> 00:06:58.126\narea server roles.\n\n159\n00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.976\nAnd what we're then going to be able\nto do is we're going to go ahead and\n\n160\n00:07:01.976 --> 00:07:03.360\nwe're going to select.\n\n161\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.478\nI'm going to move down and\nselect it for us in just a second.\n\n162\n00:07:05.478 --> 00:07:08.630\nBut we're gonna select the web server,\nso let me just scroll down so\n\n163\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.170\nwe can see that.\n\n164\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.210\nAnd then I'm gonna put a zoom\nin real quick so we can see it.\n\n165\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.790\nAnd you'll see that right above the, what\nis that, fourth item up from the bottom,\n\n166\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.380\nit says Web Server (IIS),\nI'm gonna go ahead and select that.\n\n167\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.170\nAnd when I do that,\nwe're gonna get a pop up screen.\n\n168\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.650\nTake just a second, and we're gonna get a\npop-up screen for Add Roles and Features.\n\n169\n00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.480\nYou can see what that looks like here.\n\n170\n00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.071\nWe often get this when we Add Roles and\nFeatures, gonna ask us to go ahead and\n\n171\n00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:38.785\nset up, in this case, dependencies,\ntools or features that are required.\n\n172\n00:07:38.785 --> 00:07:40.386\nThat if we choose to opt out of,\n\n173\n00:07:40.386 --> 00:07:43.850\nwe're not going to be able to\nadd the web server feature.\n\n174\n00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.190\nThis has been going on for\nsome time with Windows, with Microsoft.\n\n175\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.550\nAnd I obviously want to give props and\ncredit where credit is due.\n\n176\n00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.800\nAnd it is nice to see, and\nit's been nice to see for\n\n177\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.849\nsome time now in the OS\nseveral generations.\n\n178\n00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:58.509\nThat Microsoft got smart about this and\nfinally said hey you know what?\n\n179\n00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:00.628\nYou've gotta configure\nthings a certain way.\n\n180\n00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:03.971\nWe're not gonna leave it up to you,\nbecause chances are good you're not gonna\n\n181\n00:08:03.971 --> 00:08:06.010\nget all the things you\nneed to select selected.\n\n182\n00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.630\nWe're gonna wind up with an error later.\n\n183\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.730\nLet's force you to opt in and effectively\nsay, yeah we want it done the right way,\n\n184\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.735\nand make you select it upfront,\nor not let you install.\n\n185\n00:08:14.735 --> 00:08:17.595\n>> All right.\nOoh, I remember, I think it was 2003,\n\n186\n00:08:17.595 --> 00:08:19.095\ninstalling certificate services.\n\n187\n00:08:19.095 --> 00:08:19.875\n>> Oh, yeah.\nGood luck with that.\n\n188\n00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:24.085\n>> And I wanted to do the, the online,\nthe web enrollment process.\n\n189\n00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:26.227\nAnd so I installed certificate\nservices and everything.\n\n190\n00:08:26.227 --> 00:08:28.237\nForgot to install IIS, and\n\n191\n00:08:28.237 --> 00:08:31.547\ntrying to go back and\nmake that default website after the fact?\n\n192\n00:08:31.547 --> 00:08:32.267\nImpossible.\n\n193\n00:08:32.267 --> 00:08:33.137\nNear impossible.\n\n194\n00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.737\n>> Yep.\nYeah well that's why we have the command\n\n195\n00:08:34.737 --> 00:08:37.007\nlock, so yeah we certainly could do that.\n\n196\n00:08:37.007 --> 00:08:41.172\n>> It is fantastic that they finally said\nhey look, you might want these as well.\n\n197\n00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:42.367\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is, it is.\n\n198\n00:08:42.367 --> 00:08:46.107\nAnd so I'm just pointing that out because\nit is important to understand that despite\n\n199\n00:08:46.107 --> 00:08:50.080\nour best efforts to get educated there are\njust certain things we may not realize and\n\n200\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.030\nby the vendor going out of their way to\nmake sure we don't make a mistake that\n\n201\n00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.610\nwe could avoid.\n\n202\n00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.420\nThey've actually done a service.\n\n203\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.340\nWe tend to kid around a lot\nabout certain things, right?\n\n204\n00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.040\nBut in this particular case,\nthis actually a really good thing,\n\n205\n00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.960\nit prevents you as Mike indicated\nfrom his own experience,\n\n206\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.340\nfrom doing something that could\nlead to complications later.\n\n207\n00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.100\nYou're going to waste your time, your\nenergy trying to fix a problem you never\n\n208\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.790\nshould have had in the first place, if you\nwould have just made the right choice.\n\n209\n00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.100\nRight?\nSo obviously you'll learn from that and\n\n210\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.310\nhad to do it again,\nyou would do it differently but\n\n211\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.640\nthis way you don't have\nto worry about that.\n\n212\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.120\nYou can devote your time to\nmore important things, right?\n\n213\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.380\nAll right.\nSo we've gone ahead and\n\n214\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.330\nwe chose the web server.\n\n215\n00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.130\nWe've added the features.\n\n216\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.350\nWe're gonna click next.\n\n217\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.790\nAnd now we're gonna have in,\nthe next screen, the feature screen.\n\n218\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:32.590\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm going to and\nI'll zoom in on this for\n\n219\n00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.670\nyou quickly just so you could see it.\n\n220\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.730\nThen I'm gonna zoom out and\ndo what I need to do here.\n\n221\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.660\nWe see that we have two Dot-Net\nframeworks, version 3.5 and version 4.5.\n\n222\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.036\nAnd you'll notice by the way\nthat one of three for\n\n223\n00:09:43.036 --> 00:09:46.042\n.NET 3.52 of seven off\nto the right install for\n\n224\n00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:50.470\n.NET 4.5, we have different items\nselected already pre-selected right?\n\n225\n00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.030\nThese are grayed out.\n\n226\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.020\nIn other words they've already\nbeen selected and setup initially.\n\n227\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.770\nWe're going to add some of that\nfunctionality in that we need across one\n\n228\n00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.920\nor both of these so we're just going\nto be focused on that for a minute.\n\n229\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.630\nAnd so what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to go into the 3.5 feature set\n\n230\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.190\nfirst.\n\n231\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.770\nSo we're going to pull\nthis arrow down here.\n\n232\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.420\nWe call that a carrot by the way for\n\n233\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.760\nthose of you that are familiar with that\nfrom your Microsoft Office training.\n\n234\n00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.810\nAnd we're going to choose,\nwe have two items here.\n\n235\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.120\nLet me just zoom in on them so\nyou can see them real quick.\n\n236\n00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.120\nYou'll see we have HTTP Activation and\nNon-HTTP Activation.\n\n237\n00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.110\nNow I could ask the obvious question,\nwhat is the difference between the two?\n\n238\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.450\nMike will probably tell me well one\nis about activation, one is not\n\n239\n00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.000\nabout activation, and, and that would not\nquite be accurate although it's close.\n\n240\n00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.910\nBut let me show you what's\nreally important to know here.\n\n241\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.110\nI'm gonna highlight one of\nthem without selecting it.\n\n242\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.600\nI'm gonna zoom back in cuz I want you\nto be able to see off to the right and\n\n243\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.980\nI'm gonna actually scroll in\na little more so we can see that.\n\n244\n00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.680\nWhat the explanation is, because it is\nimportant to understand what this does.\n\n245\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.830\nYou know often, this is another thing\nMicrosoft has done really well.\n\n246\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.179\nAnd I don't get to say that very often,\nI must be fair, right?\n\n247\n00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:57.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it is one of the few times when\n\n248\n00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.340\nthey've actually done something very well.\n\n249\n00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.060\nAnd I'm not kidding when I say very well.\n\n250\n00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.800\nYou know documentation has been a big\nfocus in the product releases over\n\n251\n00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.970\nthe last several cycles,\nimproving the console experience,\n\n252\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.480\nimproving the health experience.\n\n253\n00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.410\nAnd there's some very good\ndescriptive dialogue going on now.\n\n254\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.370\nYou get some really good guidance as to\nwhat's happening with something if you're\n\n255\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.640\nnot clear but you have to know enough to\nselect and this is the challenge most IT\n\n256\n00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.060\nprofessionals have stop long enough\nto admit you don't know something and\n\n257\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.870\nthen actually read right?\n\n258\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.870\nBecause most of us click first,\nhit next second and then go back and\n\n259\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.440\nsay, oh yeah I should have done\nsomething different third.\n\n260\n00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.220\nDon't be that person by the way.\n\n261\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:33.780\nRight?\n\n262\n00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.170\nMake sure you stop and you read.\n\n263\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.760\nAnd here's why.\n\n264\n00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.030\nIf you don't know the difference\nbetween HTTP activation and\n\n265\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:44.090\nnon HTTP and more importantly if you\ndon't know what HTTP activation does,\n\n266\n00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.930\nyou're not going to install\nthis product properly.\n\n267\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.770\nAnd here's why, HTTP activation\nsupports process activation.\n\n268\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:54.560\nVia HTTP applications that use\nactivation HTTP activation\n\n269\n00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.910\ncan dynamically start and\nstop in response to work items.\n\n270\n00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.400\nIn other words,\nsomething like the console and\n\n271\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.454\nthe information that's\nmanaged in the SCCM console\n\n272\n00:12:04.454 --> 00:12:08.520\nis going to be able to leverage HTTP\nactivation in order to do it's job.\n\n273\n00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.070\nIn order to install that properly, we\ncan't stop and start services and stop and\n\n274\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.320\nstart the application\nwithin the application and\n\n275\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.250\nthe console as a result of that.\n\n276\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.505\nIt's a little oopsy, but\n\n277\n00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:21.905\nit's a big oopsy because it means that\nthe product doesn't work the right way.\n\n278\n00:12:21.905 --> 00:12:25.115\nSo this is something you have to be aware\nof because we have to provide support for\n\n279\n00:12:25.115 --> 00:12:28.305\nthis and we have to choose this\nas one of our options, right?\n\n280\n00:12:28.305 --> 00:12:31.555\nSo again just keeping you in\nthe loop here so to speak.\n\n281\n00:12:31.555 --> 00:12:36.035\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose the HTTP activation.\n\n282\n00:12:36.035 --> 00:12:39.280\nNow it's gonna ask us for\nsome additional features when I do this.\n\n283\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.050\nSo we're gonna get a pop up screen here.\n\n284\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.400\nAnd you can see we have\nthe .NET Framework 4.5 support.\n\n285\n00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.590\nRemember, I'm in 3.5 right now.\n\n286\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.000\nNotice it's calling 4.5\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n287\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.215\n>> Devious those people are.\n\n288\n00:12:51.215 --> 00:12:52.205\n>> Ah-ha.\n>> Devious I say.\n\n289\n00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:53.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n290\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:57.000\nwe are being asked to provide\nsupport across multiple areas.\n\n291\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.820\nNotice IIS, the web server is there.\n\n292\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.800\nDidn't we just configure and install that?\n\n293\n00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.250\nBut did we choose all the options?\n\n294\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.470\nClearly not, so we're gonna be asked\nto put some additional stuff in there.\n\n295\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.020\nSpecifically App Dev .NET\nExtensibility 3.5 for\n\n296\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.530\nthe framework to extend the .NET 3.5\nframework and provide the capabilities we\n\n297\n00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.620\nneed, along with configuration APIs for\nprocess activation.\n\n298\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.700\n>> That's a cool technology\nprocess activation.\n\n299\n00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.730\n>> So\nwe're going to hit add features there.\n\n300\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:22.930\nWe're going to get that in there.\n\n301\n00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.090\nWe're then going to do\nnon-http activation as well.\n\n302\n00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.720\nGet that one up and\nrunning so now we have both.\n\n303\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.030\nSo now we're going to go ahead and\nwe're going to open up the 4.5 frame.\n\n304\n00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.470\nI'm just going to leave 3.5 open.\n\n305\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.250\nI'm going to pull down\nthe 4.5 framework and\n\n306\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.480\nwe're gonna then further pull down\nthe WCF services within there,\n\n307\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.690\nwhich is a sub-feature with additional\nitems that we can choose right there.\n\n308\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.990\nLet you zoom in there real quick and\nsee that.\n\n309\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.670\nSo, I've opened up the dot\nnet 4.5 framework.\n\n310\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.790\nYou'll see I've got ASP\nnet 4.5 already selected.\n\n311\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.610\nThat was there before I chose anything.\n\n312\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.870\nThe dot net framework itself is already\ninstalled, but the WCF service,\n\n313\n00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.090\nWindows Communication Framework Services\nfor those of you in the app dev world,\n\n314\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.670\nit's gonna be the one of five selected\nTCP port sharing already installed.\n\n315\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.670\nWe need at least one if not more of\nthose other so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n316\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.110\nwe are going to select\nHTTP Activation as well,\n\n317\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.300\nbecause we need it in both\nareas of the framework.\n\n318\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.660\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n319\n00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.820\nWe're also gonna need the MSMQ Activation,\n\n320\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.500\nthe Microsoft Message Queuing Activation,\nwe'll get to that in a minute.\n\n321\n00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.850\nNeed some more features that\nwe have to install there.\n\n322\n00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.770\nWe're gonna pull those in as you can see.\n\n323\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.975\nGet those in there,\ngot those ASP filters going on.\n\n324\n00:14:32.975 --> 00:14:35.250\nSo gonna add those features.\n\n325\n00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.530\nLet that kick in, we're gonna do the MSMQ\nactivation, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n326\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:44.290\nwe're gonna select that as well, get some\nnew roles and features that we have to\n\n327\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.270\nbring in there for the message queuing\nserver, so we're gonna have those in.\n\n328\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:54.420\nWe're gonna go ahead and add a named\npipe activation, and TCP activation,\n\n329\n00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.320\nI said we're gonna need one or\nmore of them, we actually need all four.\n\n330\n00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.900\nSo we're gonna put that in.\n\n331\n00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.330\nWe're then gonna go ahead.\n\n332\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.420\nWhen we've done that, we're then gonna go\nahead and move down just a little bit.\n\n333\n00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.840\nSo let me just scroll down,\nsince we have all that open.\n\n334\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.810\nIt's kind of hard to see.\n\n335\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.755\nOf course,\nI managed to scroll a little too far.\n\n336\n00:15:08.755 --> 00:15:09.380\n>> Um-hm.\n\n337\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.500\n>> And we're gonna go ahead.\n\n338\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.760\nAnd we're gonna choose bits, the\nbackground intelligent, transfer service.\n\n339\n00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.880\nBits, kind of an interesting service.\n\n340\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.620\nWithout reading the information off to\nthe left, you know what bits does and\n\n341\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.550\nwhere it comes from?\n\n342\n00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.620\n>> You know, I believe it started with\nthe download from the internet but\n\n343\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.130\nI'm not positive in that and\nit allows you to continue a,\n\n344\n00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.310\nmaybe a file transfer or\ndownload one if it is interrupted?\n\n345\n00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.215\n>> It does, absolutely correct and so\nwhat BITS does is exactly Mike described.\n\n346\n00:15:34.215 --> 00:15:36.805\nIt is going to allow us\neffectively to do downloads and\n\n347\n00:15:36.805 --> 00:15:38.100\nbookmark them in effect, right?\n\n348\n00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.025\n>> Mm-hm In case they're interrupted.\n\n349\n00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:40.035\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n350\n00:15:40.035 --> 00:15:42.645\nIt is the server that sits behind\nthe Windows Update feature.\n\n351\n00:15:42.645 --> 00:15:44.375\n>> Mm.\nBecause it is what effectively allows us\n\n352\n00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:48.155\nto do the download of patching of\nMicrosoft and to stream software.\n\n353\n00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:51.829\nWe're gonna need it to do application and\npackage deployment with SCCM which is why\n\n354\n00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:54.043\nwe're putting it in,\nit's use for that as well.\n\n355\n00:15:54.043 --> 00:15:57.157\nBut that sits at the top of\nany kind of streaming service\n\n356\n00:15:57.157 --> 00:16:00.078\nThat Microsoft uses to deliver bits,\nliterally.\n\n357\n00:16:00.078 --> 00:16:03.690\nBinary bytes because we're gonna be able\nto bookmark and track that delivery and\n\n358\n00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:04.760\nif it's interrupted.\n\n359\n00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.771\nPull it back and\nthen pick it back up where we left off,\n\n360\n00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:08.438\n[CROSSTALK] which is\nexactly what that does.\n\n361\n00:16:08.438 --> 00:16:10.150\nSo, we're gonna be installing BITS.\n\n362\n00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.930\nWe're just talking about what BITS is and\nwhy it's so\n\n363\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.160\nimportant remembering that BITS\nis gonna allow us to effectively\n\n364\n00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.020\ninterrupt the stream download of some kind\nand then pick it back up again, right.\n\n365\n00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.000\nIt's almost like a bookmarker\nin that respect.\n\n366\n00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.330\nSo, it's gonna be real nice for\na bookmark.\n\n367\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.390\nIt's gonna be real nice to have that.\n\n368\n00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.650\nWe're gonna select that.\n\n369\n00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.500\nWhen we do, it's gonna ask us to\nprompt for some additional features.\n\n370\n00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.230\nYou guys have see this before.\n\n371\n00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.270\nWe're gonna go ahead and\njust accept those.\n\n372\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.300\nAdd those features in.\n\n373\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.860\nAnd then what we're gonna do is scroll\ndown a little bit more because we\n\n374\n00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.140\ndo have to get some\nadditional stuff down here.\n\n375\n00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.190\nLet me just scroll down\ntowards the bottom.\n\n376\n00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.040\nAnd went a little too far.\n\n377\n00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.840\nLet me go back up, R, S.\n\n378\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.500\nS, there we go, and we need,\nwait for that to stop.\n\n379\n00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.510\nI'm just gonna point to it.\n\n380\n00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.760\nAnd I'll zoom in so\nyou can see it real quick.\n\n381\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.800\nWe need Remote Differential Compression\nright there.\n\n382\n00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.600\nWe're gonna be able to\nselect that as well.\n\n383\n00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.890\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nhighlight that.\n\n384\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.050\nGet Remote Differential Compression\nin there.\n\n385\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.610\nThis is gonna effectively\nminimize the bandwidth for\n\n386\n00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:09.860\na transfer of objects between\ntwo end points on the network.\n\n387\n00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.340\nSo we're using built-in compression.\n\n388\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.510\nIn effect, they just have a fancy name for\nit these days.\n\n389\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.835\nWe used to just call it compression.\n\n390\n00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:17.545\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now we call it remote differential\n\n391\n00:17:17.545 --> 00:17:20.182\ncompression because compression\nwasn't good enough, right.\n\n392\n00:17:20.182 --> 00:17:21.557\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Huh?\n\n393\n00:17:21.557 --> 00:17:22.308\n>> It lost it over time.\n\n394\n00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:23.724\n>> Yeah [CROSSTALK].\n\n395\n00:17:23.724 --> 00:17:28.095\nYeah, we gotta freshen it up for\nthe new decade here.\n\n396\n00:17:28.095 --> 00:17:28.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n397\n00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.990\nwe're gonna hit next on this screen now\nthat we've got everything in place.\n\n398\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.050\nWe now have our Web Server IIS Role.\n\n399\n00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:38.250\nWe're gonna be able to just blow past that\ninitial welcome screen that kinda says,\n\n400\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.660\nhey, this is what we're gonna do.\n\n401\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.620\nWe're now on the Select\nroles services page,\n\n402\n00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.420\nand so what we're gonna do is come down.\n\n403\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.275\nAnd before I zoom in, I'm just gonna\nscooch down towards the bottom\n\n404\n00:17:49.275 --> 00:17:52.099\nhere to where we need to be to Security.\n\n405\n00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:54.110\nLet me scroll back up just a little bit.\n\n406\n00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.038\nThere we go.\n\n407\n00:17:55.038 --> 00:17:59.950\nAnd what we're gonna do, and again, I'm\njust gonna point to it so we can see it.\n\n408\n00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.730\nAnd we're gonna select or\nget to Windows Authentication.\n\n409\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.920\nLet me kind of scroll down so\nyou could see that.\n\n410\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.780\nWe'll zoom in real quick, so\nwe're on the security area there.\n\n411\n00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.265\nYou see I'm pointing to\nWindows Authentication.\n\n412\n00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:12.588\nI'm gonna check that off.\n\n413\n00:18:12.588 --> 00:18:15.430\nI'm not gonna trouble you to go\nthrough the difference between all\n\n414\n00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:20.340\nthe authentication mechanisms cuz\nI'm not that big of an idiot.\n\n415\n00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:26.088\nHowever, however, however, all kidding\naside, if I was you and I was planning,\n\n416\n00:18:26.088 --> 00:18:29.530\nnumber one, on installing this product,\nwhich hopefully, a lot of you are.\n\n417\n00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:30.860\nNumber two, using it safely and\n\n418\n00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.590\nsecurely in production, cuz remember\nsafe computing shows you care.\n\n419\n00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.320\nAnd number three,\nif I was preparing for the exam.\n\n420\n00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.582\nI would definitely wanna know the\ndifference between basic authentication,\n\n421\n00:18:42.582 --> 00:18:46.432\nbetween digest authentication, and\nbetween Windows authentication.\n\n422\n00:18:46.432 --> 00:18:49.761\nAnd this is not just for this product,\nthis is something you should know in\n\n423\n00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:52.190\ngeneral with regards to any\nWindows product you use.\n\n424\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.070\nIf you're not comfortable with\nthose three authentication forms,\n\n425\n00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.200\nit's a fairly straightforward\nconversation to have.\n\n426\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.807\nNot one we're gonna have here, but\none that you can easily bone up on.\n\n427\n00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.470\nJust go out and\ndo a little reading on your own.\n\n428\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.245\nBut you need to get those straight in\nyour head if you're gonna use this\n\n429\n00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.057\nproduct properly.\n\n430\n00:19:07.057 --> 00:19:13.004\nAnd you're also gonna be able authenticate\nand secure any kind of authentication that\n\n431\n00:19:13.004 --> 00:19:18.474\nyou use with SharePoint, with Exchange,\nwith Config Manager, Ops Manager.\n\n432\n00:19:18.474 --> 00:19:21.722\nAnd even if it has a console that you\nhave talked to over the Internet, or\n\n433\n00:19:21.722 --> 00:19:25.077\ngenerically over the network and\nthrough the web, is gonna require one or\n\n434\n00:19:25.077 --> 00:19:26.070\nmore of these forms.\n\n435\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.470\nIt's real important for\nyou to know what they are.\n\n436\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:28.940\nSo just wanna point those out to you.\n\n437\n00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.570\nMake sure you're\ncomfortable with all that.\n\n438\n00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.540\nWe're then gonna go down\nto Management Tools.\n\n439\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.830\nSo let me just scroll down\ntowards the bottom here.\n\n440\n00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.930\nAnd under Management Tools, we've got\nsome of the tools already selected.\n\n441\n00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.370\nWe're gonna expand\nIS6 Management Compatibility.\n\n442\n00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.060\nAnd just open that up so\nyou can see our options there.\n\n443\n00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.580\nI'm gonna zoom back in so\nyou could see what we need to have, and\n\n444\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.120\nyou'll see we have the metabase\ncompatibility already selected.\n\n445\n00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.730\nRemember the metabase,\nthose of you that may or\n\n446\n00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.130\nmay not know,\nthe metabase is the IIS registry.\n\n447\n00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.612\nIIS maintains its own registry separate\nfrom the registry in the Windows\n\n448\n00:20:01.612 --> 00:20:03.020\noperating system.\n\n449\n00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.220\nEffectively it's a configuration database.\n\n450\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.530\nIt stores all the information for IIS.\n\n451\n00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.710\nWe call it the metabase.\n\n452\n00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.188\nWe have for some time now.\n\n453\n00:20:10.188 --> 00:20:12.410\nSo the metabase is already selected there,\nbut\n\n454\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:16.030\nwe have management console scripting\ntools and WMI compatibility.\n\n455\n00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.270\nIf you're not familiar with WMI,\nboy, are you in for\n\n456\n00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.860\na shocker when we talk about querying.\n\n457\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.380\nWe talk about WQL, WMI query language\nwith regards to querying here.\n\n458\n00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.050\nWMI, interesting conversation,\n\n459\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:34.490\ninteresting language,\nis heavily utilized within Windows.\n\n460\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.330\nThere is a non-Microsoft specific version\n\n461\n00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.462\nof the WMI functionality that\nwe can point to outside CIM.\n\n462\n00:20:41.462 --> 00:20:45.058\nSo we use that in technologies like\nVM Ware for instance, where we use\n\n463\n00:20:45.058 --> 00:20:48.974\nthat to be able to do querying and\nto effectively achieve the same results.\n\n464\n00:20:48.974 --> 00:20:53.142\nBut what WMI allows us to do effectively\nis to ask a yes, no, on, off,\n\n465\n00:20:53.142 --> 00:20:56.325\nbinary kind of true, false,\none, zero question and\n\n466\n00:20:56.325 --> 00:21:01.207\nreceive an answer back through some sort\nof status check, in effect on an object or\n\n467\n00:21:01.207 --> 00:21:04.641\non a property of an object or\non some sort of an interface.\n\n468\n00:21:04.641 --> 00:21:07.691\nAnd it allows us under the hood in\nWindows to be able to deal with and\n\n469\n00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:11.685\nto understand what's going on with all of\nthe configuration issues, concerns, and\n\n470\n00:21:11.685 --> 00:21:13.400\nmonitoring that we have to do.\n\n471\n00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.080\nIt's just what WMI is really\ngoing to help us focus on.\n\n472\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.088\nIt's very valuable in the web area,\nbecause we obviously need to use it for\n\n473\n00:21:19.088 --> 00:21:20.180\na variety of things.\n\n474\n00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.860\nSo, we're gonna be focusing on it there.\n\n475\n00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.860\nSo, we're gonna go ahead, and we're\ngonna choose the following information.\n\n476\n00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.850\nWe need to have the IIS 6\nMetabase Compatibility.\n\n477\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:28.910\nGot that one already there.\n\n478\n00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:32.170\nWe need WMI Compatibility so we're\ngonna choose that one, click that in.\n\n479\n00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.610\nWe need Management Scripts and\nTools, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n480\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.940\nwe're going to choose that one down below.\n\n481\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.280\nAnd let me just zoom back in for one\nsecond to show you the difference here.\n\n482\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.480\nWhat I did is I did not\nchoose Management Console and\n\n483\n00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.150\nScripting Tools separately as two\ncheck off boxes on their own.\n\n484\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.880\nBut rather chose Management Scripts and\n\n485\n00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.130\nTools down below as\na separate combined item.\n\n486\n00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.810\nThat is different than\nthe IIS 6 Scripting Tools.\n\n487\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:02.105\nThe IIS Management Scripts and Tools,\nas you'll notice there if you look off to\n\n488\n00:22:02.105 --> 00:22:05.150\nthe right, is the support for\nIIS 7 and above.\n\n489\n00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.470\nWhich is the newer version of IIS that\nis running in the later versions of\n\n490\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.660\nthe service.\n\n491\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.190\nIIS 6 scripting tools and management\nconsole above the individual check\n\n492\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.440\nboxes are for version 6,\nwhich is the older version of IIS.\n\n493\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.140\nSubtle but important difference.\n\n494\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.660\nTry to do that three times while\nstanding on one foot, right?\n\n495\n00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.719\nAll right so, we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna hit Next.\n\n496\n00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.150\nWe are now finally gonna hit\nthe Confirmation screen.\n\n497\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.800\nWe're gonna hit Install, and\nyou may or may not have noticed,\n\n498\n00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.710\nI didn't point it out.\n\n499\n00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.790\nI'll just zoom in real quick so\nyou can see it while we're talking here.\n\n500\n00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.970\nIt's already gone by, but\nI just wanna point it out to you.\n\n501\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.404\nUp where Feature Installation is right\nnow as we're starting to install,\n\n502\n00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:46.145\nthere was a check box there that said,\n\n503\n00:22:46.145 --> 00:22:48.723\nhey, automatically restart\nthe system if necessary.\n\n504\n00:22:48.723 --> 00:22:52.703\nI did not bother to check that off because\nthis installation will not require\n\n505\n00:22:52.703 --> 00:22:55.160\na restart in order to configure itself.\n\n506\n00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.080\nNow I know that because I've done,\nI don't know,\n\n507\n00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.885\nseveral hundred thousand\nof them in my lifetime.\n\n508\n00:22:59.885 --> 00:23:02.913\nBut if you don't know that, and\nit's a good habit to get into,\n\n509\n00:23:02.913 --> 00:23:06.045\nif you wanna check that box off\nin case you do need to restart.\n\n510\n00:23:06.045 --> 00:23:09.970\nJust keep in mind if this is a production\nlevel server, it's got people connected to\n\n511\n00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.806\nit in real time,\nthat box will get you into trouble, right.\n\n512\n00:23:12.806 --> 00:23:14.750\n>> It will [LAUGH].\n>> Because it will restart without any\n\n513\n00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:15.625\nnotification.\n\n514\n00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:17.950\nIt just basically says, hey,\nguess what I'm restarting.\n\n515\n00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.735\nSo you wanna make sure you don't do this\non a production server during production\n\n516\n00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:25.910\ntime unless you're inside a maintenance\nwindow and automatically restart at\n\n517\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.270\nthe end of the installation if required,\nif people are actively using the server.\n\n518\n00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.270\nHowever if they're not,\nyou're building this off to the side,\n\n519\n00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.800\nit's out of production,\nno big deal, you wanna do that.\n\n520\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.990\nThis particular installation, however,\ndoes not require a restart, so\n\n521\n00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.050\nyou're not gonna run into that\nparticular problem, at least for\n\n522\n00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.990\nthe pre-reqs we're dealing with\nwith IIS and all of that here.\n\n523\n00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.226\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n524\n00:23:44.226 --> 00:23:46.880\nAll right, so we've gone ahead,\nwe've done all this.\n\n525\n00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.376\nOnce we're done with this,\nand this is just about done,\n\n526\n00:23:49.376 --> 00:23:53.220\nyou can see it actually I think is, yeah,\nit's installation is easier to finish.\n\n527\n00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.312\nWe're gonna get out of this.\n\n528\n00:23:54.312 --> 00:23:57.099\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ninstall another set of pre-reqs,\n\n529\n00:23:57.099 --> 00:24:00.719\nthe Windows assessment and deployment kit,\nwhat's called the Windows ADK.\n\n530\n00:24:00.719 --> 00:24:05.187\nWe're also gonna install the USMT and\nthe Windows PE environment.\n\n531\n00:24:05.187 --> 00:24:06.498\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n532\n00:24:06.498 --> 00:24:10.317\nshow you how to do those cuz those are\nalso Gonna be necessary, not necessary for\n\n533\n00:24:10.317 --> 00:24:14.022\nus to see them to get up and running,\nbut ultimately necessary for additional\n\n534\n00:24:14.022 --> 00:24:17.890\nsupport like doing user state migrations\nwhen we do refreshes on desktops.\n\n535\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.470\nWe need the WinP environment to\ndo operating system deployment.\n\n536\n00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.210\nIt's gonna need that support there.\n\n537\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.490\nSo we're gonna go ahead and show you\nhow to put all that stuff in as well.\n\n538\n00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:25.680\nSo let's get out of this.\n\n539\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.430\nWe'll finish this wizard up here.\n\n540\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.259\nLet me hit Close.\n\n541\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.870\nGo ahead and just get this done.\n\n542\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.550\nYou can see that that comes\nback to the server manager.\n\n543\n00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.500\nSo what we're gonna do now,\n\n544\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.760\nI'm just gonna scroll down here, so\nthat we can get to the next area.\n\n545\n00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.580\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead, and again,\nI've just kinda cheated a little bit in\n\n546\n00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.230\nthe sense that I've got\nthe software already set up.\n\n547\n00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.070\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\n\n548\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.660\nwe are going to just show you where\nit is in the lab environment.\n\n549\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.450\nSo let me just zoom in here real quick so\nyou can see this.\n\n550\n00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.670\nI've got in my downloads folder\nas you can see there two items.\n\n551\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:56.840\nI extended out the view so\nyou could see what they are.\n\n552\n00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.420\nI've got the System Center\n2012 R2 Config Manager ISO.\n\n553\n00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.620\nWe're going to use that in\na little bit to do the install.\n\n554\n00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.880\nBut right below it I've\ngot the Windows ADK.\n\n555\n00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.790\nWhere do you get this from is the logical\nquestion a lot of people ask.\n\n556\n00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.950\nAnd this is something you have to\ngo out and download from Microsoft,\n\n557\n00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.190\nso you can get it from\nMicrosoft on their website.\n\n558\n00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.145\nYou wanna go out and\nmake sure you have the most accurate and\n\n559\n00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:17.820\nup-to-date version of the ADK, because\nthis does get revised every so often.\n\n560\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.710\nSo this would be a good idea for\nyou to go out and download ahead of time.\n\n561\n00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.390\nAnd wanna make sure you put this on\nyour checklist of things that you wanna\n\n562\n00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.260\neffectively have access to and check out.\n\n563\n00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.670\nOne of those things from\nplanning perspective, right?\n\n564\n00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.230\nWe talked about this, planning six, nine\nmonths ahead is good for certain things.\n\n565\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.910\nPlanning six, nine months ahead and\ngetting your downloads of software done\n\n566\n00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.600\nIs okay, but\nthe reality is there may be a new version.\n\n567\n00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.970\nAnd so while I would suggest\nyou would be better served\n\n568\n00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.590\nto download the software within a few\ndays of you doing the actual deployment,\n\n569\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.580\nif you're one of those people that\njust wants to have it done and\n\n570\n00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.850\ncheck it off and say okay,\nI got it, I know where it is.\n\n571\n00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.001\nNo big deal, but just make a mental note\nyou gotta go back and check and make sure\n\n572\n00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:56.300\nthere hasn't been a revised or an updated\nversion released since you downloaded it.\n\n573\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.250\nCuz then you're gonna wind up having\nto do a bunch of, as you pointed out,\n\n574\n00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.800\nretrofitting and regression solutions,\n\n575\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.680\nin order to patch effectively and get up\nto speed with the most current version.\n\n576\n00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.900\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n577\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.770\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna install the Windows ADK.\n\n578\n00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.590\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\njust get, oops, there we go.\n\n579\n00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.870\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ntry to get in there.\n\n580\n00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.770\nWe're gonna get into the Windows ADK.\n\n581\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.850\nAnd if we can go ahead,\nwe're gonna blow this up and\n\n582\n00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.640\nshow you how to do the install here.\n\n583\n00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.192\nI'm just gonna move this down\na little bit so you could see this.\n\n584\n00:26:22.192 --> 00:26:25.190\nI am gonna zoom in just so you could see.\n\n585\n00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.150\nWe have an executable there, ADK setup.\n\n586\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.090\nWe're just gonna go ahead.\n\n587\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.820\nWe're gonna use that, no mystery there.\n\n588\n00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.180\nSo, we're just gonna blow that up.\n\n589\n00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.520\nSo let me just double click on that.\n\n590\n00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.460\nAnd give that a second,\nhopefully, to get started.\n\n591\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.820\nIt jumps around a little bit.\n\n592\n00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.910\n>> Yeah,\nit looked like it jumped back out.\n\n593\n00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.627\nI think maybe when you zoomed out.\n\n594\n00:26:42.627 --> 00:26:43.420\n>> Yeah, it may have.\n\n595\n00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.387\nOkay, well, give me one sec, and we're\njust gonna get back to where we were, and\n\n596\n00:26:46.387 --> 00:26:48.330\nI'm gonna be smart about this, this time.\n\n597\n00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.855\nI'm going to use the Enter key.\n\n598\n00:26:49.855 --> 00:26:51.602\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Unequivocal\n\n599\n00:26:51.602 --> 00:26:52.690\nrepresentation of doing that.\n\n600\n00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:53.270\n>> Old school.\n\n601\n00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.470\n>> Old school way of starting that up.\n\n602\n00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.810\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nhighlight that, we're gonna hit Enter.\n\n603\n00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.950\nAnd as you can see,\nwe're just gonna be asked for a,\n\n604\n00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.310\nhey do you really wanna run that.\n\n605\n00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.530\nNo, I don't really wanna run it.\n\n606\n00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.440\nI just thought it would be\na good idea to select it, but\n\n607\n00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.145\nI got nothing to do, so\nwhy don't you waste my time?\n\n608\n00:27:09.145 --> 00:27:09.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Remember I\n\n609\n00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.330\nmentioned certain things work really well,\nother things, yeah, not so much.\n\n610\n00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.130\nThis is one of those things that's\none of those not so much things.\n\n611\n00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.933\nYou know, if I didn't wanna do it in\nthe first place, you prompting me and\n\n612\n00:27:18.933 --> 00:27:22.030\nreminding me that I didn't wanna do it is\nreally not gonna get you on my good side.\n\n613\n00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.040\nI just thought I'd mention that.\n\n614\n00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.710\nAll right so, when we run and you can\nsee this is the ADK for Windows 8.1.\n\n615\n00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.830\nThat why I mentioned you wanna make\nsure you have the most recent version.\n\n616\n00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.880\nObviously there is one out now for\nWindows 10,\n\n617\n00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.750\nand you wanna be aware of that as well.\n\n618\n00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.110\nIt's something else to consider.\n\n619\n00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.880\nWe have to specify the install path.\n\n620\n00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.220\nChoose the default.\n\n621\n00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.760\nDon't choose the default.\n\n622\n00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.890\nModify the path.\n\n623\n00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.000\nDon't modify the path.\n\n624\n00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.490\nI get asked this all the time.\n\n625\n00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.250\nDoesn't matter to me cuz I'm\nnot gonna have to manage it.\n\n626\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.770\nSo it doesn't really matter to\nme where you put this thing.\n\n627\n00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.661\nAll kidding aside, please take note of\nthe install path there for a minute.\n\n628\n00:27:53.661 --> 00:27:58.525\nC:\\ProgramFiles (x86),\nas opposed to program files.\n\n629\n00:27:58.525 --> 00:28:01.498\nRemember, almost everything we\ndo today is a 64 bit solution,\n\n630\n00:28:01.498 --> 00:28:03.180\nespecially the operating systems.\n\n631\n00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.805\nThey're all 64 bit today.\n\n632\n00:28:04.805 --> 00:28:10.090\nHaving said that, we have two program\nfile directories in a 64 bit OS.\n\n633\n00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.200\nWanna make sure we are installing\ninto the right one.\n\n634\n00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.210\nYou will notice this is going\ninto effectively the x86\n\n635\n00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.630\ncontainer as opposed to program files.\n\n636\n00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:19.714\nThere is a reason for that.\n\n637\n00:28:19.714 --> 00:28:24.260\nUnless you have a compelling reason to\nmodify that path, leave it where it goes.\n\n638\n00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.490\nThe reason is that it may not work\ncorrectly and or other things that\n\n639\n00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:32.300\ncall this functionality, like the system\ncenter installer when it goes to look for\n\n640\n00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.450\nit and integrate it into the console\nmay not know where to find it.\n\n641\n00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.480\nSo you have to just be aware of that and\n\n642\n00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.790\nyou may cut off some errors\nthat could occur by moving it.\n\n643\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.360\nI'm not suggesting you can't move it.\n\n644\n00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.050\nI'm just specifying that if you do,\nyou have to know where you put it,\n\n645\n00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.810\nso that you can tell what's looking for\nit where to go find it when it needs it.\n\n646\n00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.330\nThat's what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n647\n00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.480\nSo I don't want it to come across is\nI'm saying don't move it if you have\n\n648\n00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.400\na compelling reason to, because obviously\nwe gave you the option with the browse\n\n649\n00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.060\nwindow to do so or Browse button.\n\n650\n00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.150\nAnd wouldn't it be funny if you\ncould browse and move it, but\n\n651\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.113\nyou're not supposed to?\n\n652\n00:29:01.113 --> 00:29:02.428\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would just be hilarious.\n\n653\n00:29:02.428 --> 00:29:04.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not like Microsoft's ever done\n\n654\n00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:04.720\nthat before.\n\n655\n00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.730\n>> No, never.\n\n656\n00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.550\n>> Never, right, okay.\n\n657\n00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.740\nSo here we are hitting Next.\n\n658\n00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.810\nDo we wanna join the Customer\nExperience Improvement Program?\n\n659\n00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.890\nI don't know about you but boy,\nam I excited about doing that.\n\n660\n00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.940\nSo we're gonna hit No, which is the\ndefault, because I figure if it is broken,\n\n661\n00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.540\nsomebody else has probably\nalready told you about it.\n\n662\n00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.990\nYou don't need me to tell you.\n\n663\n00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.900\nThere is a EULA, you will accept that.\n\n664\n00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.330\nSo we're going to go ahead and hit Accept.\n\n665\n00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:28.600\nYou ever read that, by the way?\n\n666\n00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.420\nThey have the rights to your\nfirst born child as part of that.\n\n667\n00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.530\n>> Pretty much.\n>> Yeah, they do.\n\n668\n00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.755\nAll kidding aside, I have three children,\none of which I had to give to Microsoft.\n\n669\n00:29:35.755 --> 00:29:39.242\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I hit Yes on one of those and\n\n670\n00:29:39.242 --> 00:29:41.360\nthey claimed my first born.\n\n671\n00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.015\nAll right, so I am kidding,\nby the way, totally kidding.\n\n672\n00:29:46.015 --> 00:29:48.935\nAnybody out there listening,\nwas not me, that was Mike talking.\n\n673\n00:29:48.935 --> 00:29:49.985\nThat was not me, by the way.\n\n674\n00:29:49.985 --> 00:29:54.205\nAll right, so what you'll see here on the\nselect the features you want to install.\n\n675\n00:29:54.205 --> 00:29:55.655\nThis is actually important.\n\n676\n00:29:55.655 --> 00:29:59.465\nIt's important because we need to\nknow what of the ADK feature set and\n\n677\n00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:02.805\nthe associated tools that go with it,\nwe actually wanna be able to use.\n\n678\n00:30:02.805 --> 00:30:04.975\nNow you notice by default\neverything is selected there.\n\n679\n00:30:04.975 --> 00:30:06.555\nWe may want it all, and that's fine.\n\n680\n00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:08.290\nThe reality is we don't need it all.\n\n681\n00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:11.280\nSo we may not necessarily want to\ninstall it all and for sake of time and\n\n682\n00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.730\nbrevity, we're not gonna\ninstall it all here.\n\n683\n00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.710\nSo I'm just gonna quickly tell\nyou what we are gonna install,\n\n684\n00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:18.100\ncuz we do wanna obviously\nfocus on things we need.\n\n685\n00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.080\nWe are gonna use, and I'm gonna make this\nselection in a minute after I zoom out.\n\n686\n00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.550\nWe're gonna use the Deployment Tools,\n\n687\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.160\nwe're gonna use the Windows\nPreinstall Environment Win PE, and\n\n688\n00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.590\nwe're gonna use\nthe User State Migration Tool, the USMT.\n\n689\n00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.200\nWe're gonna deselect the others.\n\n690\n00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.420\nWe don't need those, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and get rid of those.\n\n691\n00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:37.284\nBut just so you know, so we're gonna\ngo ahead and get rid of that, do that,\n\n692\n00:30:37.284 --> 00:30:41.800\njust get rid of that, that,\nthat, and, I believe, that.\n\n693\n00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.860\nAll right, and, oops, gonna, there we go.\n\n694\n00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.789\nAll right, and\nyou'll notice that when we do that,\n\n695\n00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.590\nwe're gonna get roughly about three gigs\nworth of stuff that's gonna be installed.\n\n696\n00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:55.428\nI'm gonna zoom back in so that you can\nquickly see the size estimate here.\n\n697\n00:30:55.428 --> 00:30:57.710\nRoughly about 3.1 gigs.\n\n698\n00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:02.460\nAbout three gigs of that is the operating\nsystem deployment environment from WinPE\n\n699\n00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.390\nthat we are deploying.\n\n700\n00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.554\nThe rest of it is not even 100 megs.\n\n701\n00:31:06.554 --> 00:31:10.900\nBut WinPE by itself is about three gigs\nbecause of the ISOs that are installed for\n\n702\n00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.110\nthe pre boot environments,\nthe images that we use.\n\n703\n00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.300\nSo just so you know why that's so big.\n\n704\n00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.535\nObviously you gotta make sure you have\nenough room to be able to do this, so\n\n705\n00:31:17.535 --> 00:31:19.335\njust be planning for that as well.\n\n706\n00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:21.975\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Install here.\n\n707\n00:31:21.975 --> 00:31:24.935\nLet that go ahead and do its thing,\nand surprisingly considering\n\n708\n00:31:24.935 --> 00:31:27.875\nhow much stuff we're moving into the\nenvironment, it is actually fairly quick.\n\n709\n00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:29.315\nDoesn't really take too long to do that.\n\n710\n00:31:29.315 --> 00:31:30.885\nSo we're gonna get that up and running.\n\n711\n00:31:31.912 --> 00:31:33.632\nWe're gonna come back and\ntake a look at that in two minutes.\n\n712\n00:31:33.632 --> 00:31:37.188\nWe're gonna let that cook,\njust like they do on the cooking shows.\n\n713\n00:31:37.188 --> 00:31:38.845\nWe're not gonna cut to a commercial break,\n\n714\n00:31:38.845 --> 00:31:41.618\ncuz we don't have a sponsor\nthat's sponsoring a commercial.\n\n715\n00:31:41.618 --> 00:31:45.060\nInstead we're gonna go to another machine,\nand do another part of the install for\n\n716\n00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:45.655\nthe prereqs.\n\n717\n00:31:45.655 --> 00:31:48.400\nGonna move to the domain controller,\nand we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n718\n00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.690\nAnd then by the time we come back,\n\n719\n00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.710\nthis will all be done through\nthe magic of modern video technology.\n\n720\n00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.206\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n721\n00:31:55.206 --> 00:31:58.728\ntake a look at how to extend\nthe schema in the SCCM installation.\n\n722\n00:31:58.728 --> 00:32:03.239\nAnd so what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ngo ahead and we're gonna use ADSI edit.\n\n723\n00:32:03.239 --> 00:32:07.899\nNow before we go in there, I'm gonna zoom\nin and I just wanna show you something.\n\n724\n00:32:07.899 --> 00:32:10.922\nBecause I'm about to make\na modification or a change here,\n\n725\n00:32:10.922 --> 00:32:13.890\nI am in the Active Directory\nUser Computer Manager.\n\n726\n00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:18.120\nI've turned on or\nactivated the Advanced Features view,\n\n727\n00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.090\nthat's what I wanted to say,\nthank you very much.\n\n728\n00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.250\nSo I went up to the View menu,\nchose Advanced Features.\n\n729\n00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.160\nYou're not seeing me do that,\nI've already done that.\n\n730\n00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.790\nAnd you'll now see that I can\nsee the system containers, and\n\n731\n00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.110\nthe system container is down there on the\nbottom and inside the system container,\n\n732\n00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.150\nwhen I open it up, and we're going\nto do that just so you can see.\n\n733\n00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.390\nAnd I'm going to span this out just\na little so you can see what is, and\n\n734\n00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.490\nmost importantly what is not there.\n\n735\n00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.890\nWhat you will find is that I do not,\n\n736\n00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:50.040\ndo not have a system management container\ncreated up under the system container.\n\n737\n00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.470\nIt is not there currently.\n\n738\n00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.550\nAnd if you look,\nyou will see that it does not exist.\n\n739\n00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.580\nIt would be there right between the P,\nthe R, and the W.\n\n740\n00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.910\nIt would actually be between the R and\nthe W there,\n\n741\n00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.160\nRAS and Windows Services or\nwhatever is there.\n\n742\n00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.940\nSo it's not there currently right?\n\n743\n00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.240\nWe're gonna put one in, which is what\nwe're gonna do with ADSI Edit right now.\n\n744\n00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.440\nSo, we're gonna have to create this and\n\n745\n00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.190\nI mentioned this when we did the\ndiscussion on the demo of the console and\n\n746\n00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:15.390\nI showed you the systems management\ncontainer in the AD environment.\n\n747\n00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:16.770\nI talked about the integration.\n\n748\n00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.190\nAnd I said this is gonna be\ndone as part of the install.\n\n749\n00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.920\nIt's a manual configuration item.\n\n750\n00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.547\nWe use ADSI Edit to do this.\n\n751\n00:33:22.547 --> 00:33:24.786\nAnd we need enterprise\nadministrative rights to do so.\n\n752\n00:33:24.786 --> 00:33:27.860\nThis is what we are about to\ndemonstrate for you right now.\n\n753\n00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.370\nNow for those of you that have\nnever used ADSI Edit before,\n\n754\n00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.820\nit is one of the tools\nthat is available to us.\n\n755\n00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.560\nWe get to it from the Server Manager.\n\n756\n00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.030\nWe can load it a variety of ways.\n\n757\n00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.503\nBut if we created MMC we could\nload it ourselves as well.\n\n758\n00:33:39.503 --> 00:33:40.560\nI learn, I yawn\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n759\n00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.804\n>> Yearn is what I'm trying to say.\n\n760\n00:33:43.804 --> 00:33:47.960\nI yearn for the old days where you had to\ncreate your own MMCs, load these tools.\n\n761\n00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.490\nThe ADSI Edit tool at one point was\na hidden Item, that you had to go out and\n\n762\n00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.740\nactually grab, install into the MMC and\nhave rights to use.\n\n763\n00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.980\nIt wasn't available as\na tool that was published.\n\n764\n00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.680\nMicrosoft has changed that.\n\n765\n00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.640\nBehavior is now available to\nyou as a tool that is available\n\n766\n00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.950\nfrom within the tool menu.\n\n767\n00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.670\nSo, we can go up to the tools area.\n\n768\n00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.240\nI'll just pull this down quickly so\nyou can see it.\n\n769\n00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.530\nI'll just kinda highlight it, zoom in so\nyou can see where it is right there.\n\n770\n00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.380\nAnd we can choose it right from that menu.\n\n771\n00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.900\nNow, I've already taken the liberty\nof opening it up for us so\n\n772\n00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.520\nwe're just going to scroll down here.\n\n773\n00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.960\nCome over here to the ADSI Edit tool.\n\n774\n00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.530\nBring that forward.\n\n775\n00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.520\nThis is what it looks like right here.\n\n776\n00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.280\nJust make this this full size so\nthat we can see this a little bit easier.\n\n777\n00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.850\nAnd what the ADSI Edit tool represents\nis the ability to do schema editing.\n\n778\n00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.890\nWe know, hopefully,\nabout the registry editing tools,\n\n779\n00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:36.580\nRegEdit, this is schema editing.\n\n780\n00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.730\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna take a look a this,\n\n781\n00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:42.890\nwe're gonna right click on ADSI Edit,\nand choose Connect To.\n\n782\n00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.890\nWe're gonna get\na Connection Settings window.\n\n783\n00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:47.470\nI'm gonna zoom in on this so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n784\n00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:50.250\nAnd we have some default\nsettings that are there.\n\n785\n00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.530\nThe default naming context is there.\n\n786\n00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.310\nNormally, leave the defaults in place.\n\n787\n00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.240\nIt will connect into the namespace\nautomatically locally\n\n788\n00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.250\nto the domain controller.\n\n789\n00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:01.080\nRemember, we are on the domain controller\nso it's gonna be a local connect.\n\n790\n00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.680\nSo you want to run this tool\non the domain controller so\n\n791\n00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.540\nyou don't have to modify the path.\n\n792\n00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.530\nIf you're on a remote\nmachine connecting in,\n\n793\n00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.080\nthen you got to worry\nabout the path statement.\n\n794\n00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.810\nAnd it becomes a little\nbit more complicated.\n\n795\n00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.250\nSo.\n\n796\n00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:16.780\nOne of those time saving shortcuts, like\npre-marinating ahead of time, in this case\n\n797\n00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.480\nmake sure you're on the domain\ncontroller when you wanna ADSI Edit.\n\n798\n00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.630\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nopen up the default naming context.\n\n799\n00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.850\nI'm just gonna move this over so\nwe can see this a little bit easier.\n\n800\n00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.670\nAnd I'm also going to just\nextend that out a little bit.\n\n801\n00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.630\nTake advantage of some of our room there.\n\n802\n00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.100\nAnd so we have our default naming context.\n\n803\n00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.350\nWe're gonna open that up.\n\n804\n00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.570\nAgain, this is a hierarchy so\nwe're gonna just drill down a little bit.\n\n805\n00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:41.020\nAnd if you haven't seen this before,\nI will as soon as I finish clicking,\n\n806\n00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.690\njust getting everything open so\nwe can see where we wanna be.\n\n807\n00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.120\nAnd I highlight the appropriate area.\n\n808\n00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.150\nI will zoom in so you can see this.\n\n809\n00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:53.790\nWhat I've effectively done is I have\nsimply gone to the same place I was in,\n\n810\n00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.900\nin the active directory user and computer\nmanagement tool, but I've done it in\n\n811\n00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.010\na tool that allows me to edit the schema\nto effectively add something in\n\n812\n00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:05.040\nto the schema definition that will then\nshow up in all the management tools.\n\n813\n00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.440\nNow, interesting thing about the schema.\n\n814\n00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:12.300\nMicrosoft's Active Directory schema,\nthe Ntds.dit\n\n815\n00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.150\nfile represents the schema and the ADSI\nEdit tools used to edit the schema.\n\n816\n00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.320\nThose are not the interesting things.\n\n817\n00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.141\nThose are just the mundane, average,\nevery ordinary day normal things.\n\n818\n00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:25.182\nThe interesting thing is what I'm\nabout to tell you now, so [NOISE].\n\n819\n00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:26.483\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Pay attention out there.\n\n820\n00:36:26.483 --> 00:36:29.360\nSo the interesting thing is the following.\n\n821\n00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.410\nYou can put things into the schema,\nbut here's the interesting thing,\n\n822\n00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.160\ncan you take them out?\n\n823\n00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.030\n>> You cannot.\n\n824\n00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:34.870\n>> No, but you can.\n\n825\n00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:36.130\n>> You can deactivate them.\n\n826\n00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.220\n>> No, you can also take them out.\n\n827\n00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:37.740\n>> Can you take them out?\n\n828\n00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.470\n>> I did not say you can\nyou deactivate them?\n\n829\n00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.493\nYou can deactivate them,\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n830\n00:36:41.493 --> 00:36:42.992\nYou can hide them from view,\nbut you can also take them out.\n\n831\n00:36:42.992 --> 00:36:43.839\nDo you know how?\n\n832\n00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:45.440\n>> I'm gonna say ADSI Edit.\n\n833\n00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.092\n>> No.\n\n834\n00:36:46.092 --> 00:36:46.880\n>> Darn it!\n\n835\n00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.774\n>> You would be wrong.\n\n836\n00:36:47.774 --> 00:36:49.411\nI would have gone with more than 12.\n\n837\n00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:50.432\n>> [LAUGH] Anyway, that's just me.\n\n838\n00:36:50.432 --> 00:36:52.174\nSo, here's how you actually take them out.\n\n839\n00:36:52.174 --> 00:36:52.719\nAre you ready?\n\n840\n00:36:52.719 --> 00:36:53.811\n>> Yes, this is an important part.\n\n841\n00:36:53.811 --> 00:36:54.716\nWrite this down.\n>> Okay.\n\n842\n00:36:54.716 --> 00:36:57.821\n>> C:\\format.\n\n843\n00:36:57.821 --> 00:36:59.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now so\n\n844\n00:36:59.100 --> 00:36:59.720\n>> I see that\n\n845\n00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.590\nyou didn't think about that one.\n\n846\n00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:01.840\n>> [LAUGH] Now I joke\naround about this but\n\n847\n00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.520\nhere's the real interesting thing is that\nMike is actually right when we says you\n\n848\n00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.370\ncan't take them out.\n\n849\n00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.240\nYou can't.\n\n850\n00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.050\nThe only way to get objects out of\nthe schema is to effectively blow out your\n\n851\n00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:13.150\ninstall and start over again because\nthe schema editing is a one way trip.\n\n852\n00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.520\nWe could put things in.\n\n853\n00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.865\nWe cannot remove them from the schema.\n\n854\n00:37:15.865 --> 00:37:19.735\nIt's been the same and\nbeen the way since Windows 2000.\n\n855\n00:37:19.735 --> 00:37:20.960\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So when we borrowed from\n\n856\n00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.700\nNovell to create the directory\ntree in Windows,\n\n857\n00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.815\nwe did not borrow the,\noh we can remove it option.\n\n858\n00:37:24.815 --> 00:37:25.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We only borrowed\n\n859\n00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.670\nthe let's create\nthe directory tree options.\n\n860\n00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.976\n>> We had to get out quick,\nwe were going to get caught.\n\n861\n00:37:28.976 --> 00:37:29.923\n>> That's the whole thing,\n\n862\n00:37:29.923 --> 00:37:32.560\nthat's when you borrow without\npermission these things happen right?\n\n863\n00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.010\nSo, want to be aware of that.\n\n864\n00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.200\nThey did not borrow without permission,\nI'm only kidding.\n\n865\n00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.580\nBut it is interesting, that we do\nhave the ability to put things in.\n\n866\n00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.750\nWhich is obviously very important for\nsomething like this.\n\n867\n00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.270\nBut we do not have the ability\nto remove them, but\n\n868\n00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.670\nMike was also right when he said,\n\n869\n00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:48.780\nwe could deactivate objects within the\nschema, effectively hiding them from view.\n\n870\n00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.770\nThat's part of a broader conversation\naround Windows server management,\n\n871\n00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.260\nadvanced services,\nthings like that in another area.\n\n872\n00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.660\nBut it's just important to be\naware of that and to know that.\n\n873\n00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.250\nSo, we're in the system area.\n\n874\n00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.660\nWhat we're gonna do is the following.\n\n875\n00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.510\nWe're going to right click\non the system container and\n\n876\n00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.300\nwe are going to create a new object.\n\n877\n00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.486\nSo, we're going to right click on system.\n\n878\n00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:10.866\nAnd we're going to do New.\n\n879\n00:38:10.866 --> 00:38:14.987\nAnd as soon as it comes up, I was zoom in\nquickly before I select so you can see New\n\n880\n00:38:14.987 --> 00:38:19.450\n> Object almost like the registry, right,\nwhere we can go in and say New > Reg Key.\n\n881\n00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:22.200\nSo we're gonna do New > Object,\nhighlight that.\n\n882\n00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.393\nWe have a create Object selector or\npicker that we're gonna use.\n\n883\n00:38:25.393 --> 00:38:30.328\nWe're gonna actually do the container\nobjects so I'm just gonna cheat\n\n884\n00:38:30.328 --> 00:38:35.030\na little bit by typing C-O-N to\nkinda get down to container there.\n\n885\n00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:38.540\nI'm gonna select container,\njust scroll up just a couple of clicks so\n\n886\n00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.020\nyou can see that clearly.\n\n887\n00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.400\nI'll zoom in just for a second so\nyou can it selected there.\n\n888\n00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.208\nI'm gonna choose container.\n\n889\n00:38:43.208 --> 00:38:47.372\nThere is over probably 250 objects in this\nlist that you can select to create, so\n\n890\n00:38:47.372 --> 00:38:50.530\nyou obviously want to make sure\nyou have the right object.\n\n891\n00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.818\nBecause creating a contact is not\ngoing to create the right object for\n\n892\n00:38:53.818 --> 00:38:56.269\nus to host the system's\nmanagement information.\n\n893\n00:38:56.269 --> 00:38:57.928\nSo we want to make sure\nthat we have that selected.\n\n894\n00:38:57.928 --> 00:38:59.890\nWe're going to click Container,\nclick Next.\n\n895\n00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:01.735\nAnd then like any good item\nhere that we're creating,\n\n896\n00:39:01.735 --> 00:39:03.790\nwe have to give it a value of some kind.\n\n897\n00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.340\nSo in this case this is where we name it.\n\n898\n00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:11.020\nNow I called this System Management\nwhen I did this the last time.\n\n899\n00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.019\nI'm gonna call it System Management again,\nthis is what you need to call this\n\n900\n00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:18.157\ncontainer it's what the install\nmedia is expecting to see,\n\n901\n00:39:18.157 --> 00:39:21.255\nit's the best practice recommendation,\nis it required?\n\n902\n00:39:21.255 --> 00:39:24.115\nI would say yes in the sense that\nif you call it something like,\n\n903\n00:39:24.115 --> 00:39:27.197\nWoodstock's Really Really Cool Funny and\nSnoopy-like Folder,\n\n904\n00:39:27.197 --> 00:39:30.951\nwhich you could do because they do accept\nup to 255 characters for a long name.\n\n905\n00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:33.295\nIf you did that,\nwhile technically that would work,\n\n906\n00:39:33.295 --> 00:39:36.994\nyou would run into complications with the\ninstall with regards to where things are,\n\n907\n00:39:36.994 --> 00:39:39.339\nand more importantly with\nthe hard-coded scripts,\n\n908\n00:39:39.339 --> 00:39:42.908\nthe PowerShell scripts behind the scenes\nthan the install media are expecting.\n\n909\n00:39:42.908 --> 00:39:46.413\nBecause what we've done with the install,\nnot just with this product, but\n\n910\n00:39:46.413 --> 00:39:50.191\nwith many of the products today is a lot\nless reliance on you getting things right,\n\n911\n00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:53.310\na lot more reliance on you putting\na couple of things in up front, and\n\n912\n00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.819\nthen PowerShell scripts\nkick off behind the scenes.\n\n913\n00:39:55.819 --> 00:39:57.911\nTo run the automated\ninstall requirements and\n\n914\n00:39:57.911 --> 00:40:01.557\nthen actually execute the installation,\nwhich means you may screw something up\n\n915\n00:40:01.557 --> 00:40:05.000\nif you start monkeying around with\nthe variables, so just be aware of that.\n\n916\n00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.362\nSo, Systems Management Going\nto go ahead and\n\n917\n00:40:07.362 --> 00:40:10.046\nwe're going to hit next\nthere to get that in there.\n\n918\n00:40:10.046 --> 00:40:12.720\nHit finish just to\ninstantiate that object.\n\n919\n00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.510\nWe're going to let that finish up.\n\n920\n00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.570\nWe do now have a systems\nmanagement container or\n\n921\n00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.990\nwill be created here momentarily.\n\n922\n00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:24.400\nWhat you often find by\nthe way in here is that,\n\n923\n00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.220\nand I'll just remind you that\nthis is a Microsoft product.\n\n924\n00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.550\nAnd what I mean by that is is\nthat we are notoriously bad\n\n925\n00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.130\nat refreshing our console\nin the Microsoft world.\n\n926\n00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.090\nSo if we were to zoom in right now.\n\n927\n00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:38.010\npost creation you will see that it does\n\n928\n00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.150\nexist down there at\nthe bottom on the right.\n\n929\n00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.450\nYou can see it System Management, right?\n\n930\n00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:46.300\nBut when you look over here on the left,\nit is down at the bottom.\n\n931\n00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.560\nYou'd have to know to look for\nit out of numerical order,\n\n932\n00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.980\nin this case out of alphabetical\norder because it is there.\n\n933\n00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.940\nBut what we do is we put it in as the last\nitem created, then when you hit F5 or\n\n934\n00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.620\nget out of the console it refreshes and\nalphabetizes properly.\n\n935\n00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:01.010\nAnd so it is there, but don't get tricked\ninto thinking it's not there because you\n\n936\n00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.420\ndon't see it in an alphabetized order.\n\n937\n00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.710\nThat's what I'm pointing out to you.\n\n938\n00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:04.710\nSo it's there.\nWe're going to go ahead,\n\n939\n00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.610\nwe're going to close out of ABSI edit.\n\n940\n00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:07.380\nWe're done with that.\n\n941\n00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.120\nWhat we're going to do is just quickly\ngo back to the active directory user and\n\n942\n00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.550\ncomputer interface.\n\n943\n00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:19.280\nAnd what we're going to do is we\ncan see that the container is here.\n\n944\n00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.910\nIt just is not showing up because again we\nhave to just refresh in order to have it\n\n945\n00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:27.700\nappear, but it is here, so\nif we do a quick F5 and wait for\n\n946\n00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.310\nthat to refresh back up.\n\n947\n00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:31.830\nIt would be nice if they put\nyou back where you were because\n\n948\n00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:33.342\nit's not like you wanna be there, right?\n\n949\n00:41:33.342 --> 00:41:34.770\n>> [LAUGH] You weren't there for\na reason, right?\n\n950\n00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:36.210\n>> I didn't go there for\nanything in particular.\n\n951\n00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.030\nI was just hanging out.\n\n952\n00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.490\n>> Not only puts you back at the top,\nbut collapse everything, so\n\n953\n00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:40.530\nyou gotta figure out where you were.\n\n954\n00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:41.230\n>> Exactly.\n\n955\n00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.200\n>> Right, and there's somebody who\ngets paid specifically to make\n\n956\n00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.150\nthose determinations in\nthe software hierarchy.\n\n957\n00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:50.890\nSo, you'll see now we have system\nmanagement, it is right there,\n\n958\n00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:51.890\nI've highlighted it.\n\n959\n00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:55.750\nNotice by the way, that there's nothing\nin there right now, it is blank.\n\n960\n00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.800\nWe're gonna install some stuff in there\nand create that information that we saw.\n\n961\n00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.660\nThe site code reference and\n\n962\n00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.960\nthe management point container information\nwill be put in during the install.\n\n963\n00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.560\nWe're gonna be doing that\nas we go through here.\n\n964\n00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.160\nAll right, so\nnow what we're gonna do is go ahead and\n\n965\n00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.850\nset permissions on this container.\n\n966\n00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.230\nLet me just actually get back in there,\nbecause I just minimized that.\n\n967\n00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.540\nLet me go back in there,\n\n968\n00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.110\nI forgot we're gonna set permissions,\nlet me just bring that back up.\n\n969\n00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.570\nSo the next thing we have to do is\nset permissions on this because\n\n970\n00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.440\nthe Systems Management or\nSystems Configuration Manager installer\n\n971\n00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.840\ndoes not have rights to write\nto this container by default.\n\n972\n00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.080\nThe computer object, and the account\nthat will be used to do the install\n\n973\n00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.430\nwill not have rights automatically.\n\n974\n00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:33.770\nA lot of people make this mistake.\n\n975\n00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.560\nOh I'm installing this domain in\nenterprise and I have rights to it.\n\n976\n00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.410\nWell, no,\nyou don't have rights to it necessarily.\n\n977\n00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.920\nIt's a new object that we just created.\n\n978\n00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.640\nIt wasn't there when we gave\nyou rights to everything else.\n\n979\n00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.620\nYou may or may not have rights to it.\n\n980\n00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.560\nWhat we need is to make sure that\nthe Machine Account that is gonna be\n\n981\n00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.480\ncreating the install has rights to it so\nthat's what we're gonna do right now.\n\n982\n00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.840\nSo we're gonna go in and\nwe're going to actually go and\n\n983\n00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.581\ndo a delegation of Control Wizard so\nwe're gonna right-click on this.\n\n984\n00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.110\nWe are going to delegate control.\n\n985\n00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.940\nI'll highlight this up top in case\nyou haven't seen this option before.\n\n986\n00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.720\nWe're gonna use the delegate control item,\nso we're gonna go ahead and do this.\n\n987\n00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.710\nSo, what we're gonna do now is delegate\ncontrol over the systems management\n\n988\n00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:14.080\ncontainer that we just created.\n\n989\n00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.090\nRemember we just got done in\nADSI Edit creating the container,\n\n990\n00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.050\ntaking a look at it, we're seeing in\nthe Active Directory Users and Computers.\n\n991\n00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.490\nWe're gonna right-click and go in and\nwe're going to delegate control.\n\n992\n00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.280\nSo I'm gonna go up to the top of\nthe menu there, choose delegate control.\n\n993\n00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.820\nWe're gonna start the little wizard up,\nwe're gonna go ahead and hit Next.\n\n994\n00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:34.720\nWe're gonna be presented with a user or\ngroup screen where we can select.\n\n995\n00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.990\nWe're gonna click add and what we're\ngonna do is make sure that we choose\n\n996\n00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.820\nthe computer type as an object,\nbecause by default and\n\n997\n00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.290\nby design computers are not part\nof the preselected options here.\n\n998\n00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.910\nWe have built in security principles,\ngroups and users, but\n\n999\n00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:50.330\nwe don't have access to computers.\n\n1000\n00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:52.550\nSo what we're going to\ndo is make a selection.\n\n1001\n00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.380\nWe're going to go ahead and\nwe're going to do that.\n\n1002\n00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.740\nWe're going to click okay\njust to put that in there.\n\n1003\n00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:02.050\nAnd then what we're going to\ndo is we're going to go ahead,\n\n1004\n00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:06.740\nwe're going to click advanced and we're\ngoing to go into the advanced selector and\n\n1005\n00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.690\nwe're going to go ahead and\nclick find now.\n\n1006\n00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:13.900\nJust because this way we'll get a listing\nof everything that is available.\n\n1007\n00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.360\nAnd we're just gonna scroll down,\n\n1008\n00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.030\nroughly a little bit more\nthan halfway approximately.\n\n1009\n00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:25.520\nAnd what we're gonna find is we're\ngonna find the computer, in this case,\n\n1010\n00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:30.290\n01, that we want to be able to use,\nthat we're gonna target, meaning that's\n\n1011\n00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:34.160\nthe machine that we're gonna install\nSystem Center Config Manager into we have\n\n1012\n00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.660\nto give that computer the right to be able\nto write to this container in the domain.\n\n1013\n00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.220\nSo we're going out and finding the\ncomputer account on the machine that we're\n\n1014\n00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:44.430\ngoing to target for\nthe installation of that SCCM.\n\n1015\n00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.030\n>> Right.\n\n1016\n00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.260\n>> Add it to the machine that we\nare then going to use the account for\n\n1017\n00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.440\nto give rights to this container.\n\n1018\n00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.720\n>> Right.\nYes, so not the domain controller,\n\n1019\n00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.570\nthe one we're installing SCCM on.\n\n1020\n00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:53.490\n>> Correct, right.\n\n1021\n00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:54.480\nSo we're going to highlight that.\n\n1022\n00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.210\nWe're going to click okay.\n\n1023\n00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.560\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nmake that selection.\n\n1024\n00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.590\nIt's gonna put it back in there for us.\n\n1025\n00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:03.220\nAnd what we'll see is that\nwe now have Access Control,\n\n1026\n00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.530\nI don't know how we got\nAccess Control Assistance Operators.\n\n1027\n00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:06.400\nWe'll take that out of there.\n\n1028\n00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.358\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was just me probably making a\n\n1029\n00:45:08.358 --> 00:45:12.087\nselection without realizing it, but we do\nhave the computer account in there as well\n\n1030\n00:45:12.087 --> 00:45:14.375\nor that could be the computer gremlins-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1031\n00:45:14.375 --> 00:45:16.000\n>> That are operating in there as well.\n\n1032\n00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.060\nSo, we'll just go ahead,\nand we'll delete that one.\n\n1033\n00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.790\nAnd we'll make sure the computer account\nis in there, gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n1034\n00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:23.660\nSo we've got that selected there, and\n\n1035\n00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:28.870\nthen what we're gonna do at that point\nis go to the next button, hit Next.\n\n1036\n00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:33.560\nWe're gonna get to the delegation\nof the following common task, or\n\n1037\n00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.470\ncreate a custom task to delegate screen.\n\n1038\n00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:41.040\nWe're gonna do a custom task, we're not\ngonna choose the falling common task,\n\n1039\n00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.120\nwe're gonna create our own task,\nso we're gonna choose custom.\n\n1040\n00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.520\nAnd then we've done that what\nwe're gonna do is the following.\n\n1041\n00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:54.260\nWe're gonna hit next one more time and\nwe're now going to have the ability to\n\n1042\n00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:59.910\neffectively specify what kind of\nActive director object that we want.\n\n1043\n00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:01.950\nAnd, I'm just going to zoom in so\nyou can see this.\n\n1044\n00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:06.340\nThis one says this folder, existing\nobjects in the folder, and creation of new\n\n1045\n00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.680\nobjects in this folder meaning,\nwhat are we delegating control of?\n\n1046\n00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.575\nWe're or the fact that we delegated\ncontrol of anything that takes place\n\n1047\n00:46:12.575 --> 00:46:17.105\nin this folder, so all writes,\nall reads, all modifies,\n\n1048\n00:46:17.105 --> 00:46:21.145\nall deletes, whatever, all that's gonna\nget deleted to whoever or whatever we\n\n1049\n00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:24.545\nfocus on as an account with whatever\npermissions we're about to specify.\n\n1050\n00:46:24.545 --> 00:46:28.615\nSo we're gonna leave the default which is\nyes everything, and then we're gonna go\n\n1051\n00:46:28.615 --> 00:46:33.380\nnext one more time and we're now gonna\nspecify what kind of permissions we want.\n\n1052\n00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:37.957\nNow, we have multiple permission options\nhere: general, property-specific,\n\n1053\n00:46:37.957 --> 00:46:40.730\ncreation/deletion of\nspecific child objects.\n\n1054\n00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:43.860\nAnd each one carries with it a subset\nof permissions that get selected.\n\n1055\n00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.960\nI'm gonna let you in on a little secret.\n\n1056\n00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.440\nWe want full control of everything.\n\n1057\n00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.430\nSo instead of having to select everything,\nall we're gonna do is check the full\n\n1058\n00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.780\ncontrol box that's gonna\nselect everything for us.\n\n1059\n00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.490\nSo let me show you how that works.\n\n1060\n00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:57.640\nWe're just gonna come over here,\ngonna do Full Control, and\n\n1061\n00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.479\nthen like magic, it selects everything.\n\n1062\n00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.320\nIt's the only thing that did work right so\nfar.\n\n1063\n00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.710\nAll right, so we're going to ahead and\nwe're going to choose all the permissions.\n\n1064\n00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:09.020\nWe're going to set Full Control because as\nI said we want this account to have full\n\n1065\n00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:12.660\ncontrol to be able to do all the additions\nit needs to do as well as the ongoing\n\n1066\n00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.180\nmaintenance and modification and\n\n1067\n00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:18.400\nmonitoring of that container over time\nduring the install and then post install.\n\n1068\n00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.730\nSo we're going to choose full control.\n\n1069\n00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:21.290\nWe're going to hit next.\n\n1070\n00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.140\nLet that finish up.\n\n1071\n00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.890\nWe get our Finish screen,\nnothing really of interest there.\n\n1072\n00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:27.050\nJust hit Finish, let that do its thing.\n\n1073\n00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:28.480\nIt's automatic and immediate, so\n\n1074\n00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.470\nthat's effectively been done and\nnow that we've done that\n\n1075\n00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:34.890\nwe're gonna do the extension schema\nby running the Extend Schema program.\n\n1076\n00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.320\nWe've set up the container.\n\n1077\n00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.180\nNow we're actually gonna\nextend to the schema.\n\n1078\n00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.980\nSo the next part of this is we're gonna go\nahead and extend the AD schema by running\n\n1079\n00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:47.150\nthe EXTADSH.utility tool which\nis the extend AD schema tool.\n\n1080\n00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.920\nWe're find that in the SMS\nsetup bin directory.\n\n1081\n00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.780\nSo we're gonna go ahead through\nthe install media and grab that.\n\n1082\n00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:56.835\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna change Machines,\n\n1083\n00:47:56.835 --> 00:47:59.288\nwe're gonna come back to our SMS.\n\n1084\n00:47:59.288 --> 00:48:03.297\nOur, SMS listen to me, cuz that hasn't\nhappen for a while, SCCM machine or\n\n1085\n00:48:03.297 --> 00:48:07.308\ntarget machine, you'll notice we have\nfinished the install of the ADK, so\n\n1086\n00:48:07.308 --> 00:48:09.586\nwe're just gonna go ahead and close that.\n\n1087\n00:48:09.586 --> 00:48:10.778\nWe left that running.\n\n1088\n00:48:10.778 --> 00:48:11.749\nSo we'll get out of that.\n\n1089\n00:48:11.749 --> 00:48:17.840\nWe're gonna minimize our install and\nI'm just gonna show you.\n\n1090\n00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.090\nWe're gonna go grab the install\nmedia in a second and bring it up so\n\n1091\n00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:21.970\nwe can go find it.\n\n1092\n00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:23.270\nI've already got it up and running.\n\n1093\n00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:26.140\nGonna use that to do our install\nthe actual product in a minute, but\n\n1094\n00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:30.460\nwe're gonna delve into the guts of the ISO\nhere and go into the Vin directory and\n\n1095\n00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.350\ngo get the AS Schema Extension Utilities.\n\n1096\n00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:36.040\nSo we're gonna open up\na Windows Explorer window,\n\n1097\n00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.330\nwhich we actually already have open,\nwe're just gonna go back to it.\n\n1098\n00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:41.800\nWe're just going to go into\nthe downloads directory so up one level,\n\n1099\n00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.915\ngo into the System 2012 R2 Configuration\nManager directory, we've got that there.\n\n1100\n00:48:46.915 --> 00:48:49.535\nAgain this is gonna be found\nhere because we went and\n\n1101\n00:48:49.535 --> 00:48:54.455\ndownloaded the media, the ISO from\nMicrosoft and just simply put it in here.\n\n1102\n00:48:54.455 --> 00:48:57.985\nAnd as we scroll through and you can\nsee we're delving in, we're gonna go to\n\n1103\n00:48:57.985 --> 00:49:01.785\nSMSSETUP and then the bin subdirectory and\nwe're gonna find that tool and run it.\n\n1104\n00:49:01.785 --> 00:49:04.445\nSo we're gonna go into SMSSETUP.\n\n1105\n00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:11.600\nGoing to go into bin and inside bin\nwe're going to go into I386 and then\n\n1106\n00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:20.050\nin I386 we're just going to scroll\ndown here below all the directories.\n\n1107\n00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:27.320\nDown a little bit of the way there and\nfind our extend AD schema tool.\n\n1108\n00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.070\nWe're going to right click,\njust show you that so you can see it.\n\n1109\n00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.220\nAnd we're going to choose run as\nadministrator because we have to make sure\n\n1110\n00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.760\nwe run that as an administrator.\n\n1111\n00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.810\nIf we just run that normally and\nwe don't have the proper rights and\n\n1112\n00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:39.340\nwe're not logged on\nwith the proper rights.\n\n1113\n00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.260\nThe tool will look like it worked but\nit actually will fail.\n\n1114\n00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.880\nWe're gonna take a look at how we know\nthat in a minute, Mike's got that nodding,\n\n1115\n00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.800\nknowing smile a nod going on there, so\nhe's been down this road once or twice.\n\n1116\n00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.860\n>> I have forgot\nthe Run Administrator once or twice.\n\n1117\n00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.040\n>> So\nwe're gonna use Run As Administrator, so\n\n1118\n00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.440\nwe're just gonna click that.\n\n1119\n00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.770\nAnd now the tool just flashes up quickly.\n\n1120\n00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:58.960\nAnd if you're not paying attention,\n\n1121\n00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.200\nit will actually go away\nbefore you even catch it.\n\n1122\n00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.560\nYou could see right there\npops up a command shell,\n\n1123\n00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.840\nit's gonna go do its things this\nis just a prescripted tool.\n\n1124\n00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.190\nIt's gonna just add a couple of\nthings in,so it's real quick,\n\n1125\n00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.880\nas a matter of fact it's already finished.\n\n1126\n00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.760\nEven though we're looking at it so I just\ndid a quick zoom in to capture it, so\n\n1127\n00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.660\nyou could see it.\n\n1128\n00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.270\nBut it comes and goes in about 15 seconds.\n\n1129\n00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:17.920\nIf you're not paying attention,\nyou miss it.\n\n1130\n00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.430\nYou're like oh, what the hell happened?\n\n1131\n00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.550\nAnd you go back and you keep doing\nthis thing three, four, five times.\n\n1132\n00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:24.420\nAnd you could obviously\ncause complications.\n\n1133\n00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.920\nSo pay attention to that.\n\n1134\n00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.040\nIt's actually already\nrun as you can see and\n\n1135\n00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.050\nwhat we're gonna do to validate\nthat it did run is the following.\n\n1136\n00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:33.610\nWe're gonna go take a look\nGonna go into this PC and we're\n\n1137\n00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:39.940\ngonna go into the root of C drive and,\nwhoops.\n\n1138\n00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.150\nThat's not the root of the C drive.\n\n1139\n00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.390\nLet's try that one more time cuz I\nonly clicked [LAUGH] the root of\n\n1140\n00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:46.250\nthe C drive once.\n\n1141\n00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.200\nPerhaps I should have clicked two or\nthree times right?\n\n1142\n00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.440\nAnd what we'll see there\nis we now have and\n\n1143\n00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.940\nI'll just highlight it ,so you\ncan see it before I zoom in.\n\n1144\n00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.230\nWe now have a log file.\n\n1145\n00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:00.280\nThe ExtADSch log file that\ntells us that this ran.\n\n1146\n00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.200\nIn fact it's got 2 kilobytes\nof size associated with it.\n\n1147\n00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.640\nMeans there's some stuff in there and\n\n1148\n00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.040\nwhat we're going to see is that this is\nthe log for the extension tool that ran.\n\n1149\n00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.800\nAnd if we open it up, and we'll just\ndo that really quickly just to validate\n\n1150\n00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.580\nthat the extension was successful.\n\n1151\n00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.990\nWhat we will see in there is\nthat the very bottom line,\n\n1152\n00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:20.110\nit's going to tell us yes\nit completed successfully.\n\n1153\n00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:21.920\nThere's only about 15 lines or\nso of stuff in there.\n\n1154\n00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.898\nThere isn't that much.\n\n1155\n00:51:22.898 --> 00:51:26.700\nLet's try that again.\n\n1156\n00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.220\nThere we go.\nSo we're going to open that up and\n\n1157\n00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:37.510\nyou could see it's got a whole bunch of\nstuff in there and down towards the bottom\n\n1158\n00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:44.220\nright there, you can see\nsuccessfully extended the AD schema.\n\n1159\n00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.810\nWhat it's doing is telling us all\nthe attributes and stuff that it put in.\n\n1160\n00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:52.160\nThe stuff up top is it's modifying with\nand notice it says SMS Extensions.\n\n1161\n00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:52.850\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1162\n00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.440\n>> I said that before and\nslip of the tongue.\n\n1163\n00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:55.940\nRight?\n\n1164\n00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:56.820\nI meant SSCM.\n\n1165\n00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:01.710\nSMS Systems Management Server is the old\nname of the prior versions of the product\n\n1166\n00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:03.450\nbefore it became part\nof the system center.\n\n1167\n00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.470\nSweden became branded as Config Manager.\n\n1168\n00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:09.640\nOne of this is standalone product use we\ncalled SMS, all the way back to version\n\n1169\n00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.720\none and I've been working with this\nproduct all the way back to that version,\n\n1170\n00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.818\nso I've been working with it for\nsome time.\n\n1171\n00:52:14.818 --> 00:52:18.430\nBut It's is funny cuz every often in\nsome of the logs and some of the areas,\n\n1172\n00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.680\nyou still see references\nto certain things.\n\n1173\n00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.740\nRight, we still use the SMS directories\nfor the product shares, we use it for\n\n1174\n00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.940\nall the information that goes back and\nforth through all the mailboxes,\n\n1175\n00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.430\nthe Dropfiles and folders that\nare used to move stuff back and forth.\n\n1176\n00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:34.820\nWe still see SMS referencing\nbecause the underlying architecture\n\n1177\n00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.780\nhas not really changed that much\nin terms of the communication.\n\n1178\n00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.220\nAnd so\nit's just interesting to see that and\n\n1179\n00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.610\nto obviously see that\nthat's still going on.\n\n1180\n00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:44.860\nSo we can see that the scheme\nextension was indeed successful, so\n\n1181\n00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:45.810\nwe've been able to do that.\n\n1182\n00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.090\nSo now that we have all that done.\n\n1183\n00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:51.405\nWhat were actually going\nto do is install SCCM2012\n\n1184\n00:52:51.405 --> 00:52:53.740\nit's a standalone primary site server.\n\n1185\n00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:57.170\nAll the work we have done up\nuntil now has been specifically\n\n1186\n00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:01.400\ndesigned to get all the prereq\nconfiguration information and\n\n1187\n00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.270\nthe configuration\nrequirements out of the way.\n\n1188\n00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:04.758\nNot all of the prereq software.\n\n1189\n00:53:04.758 --> 00:53:08.430\nBut the pre-req configuration and\nthe supporting cast characters,\n\n1190\n00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:13.050\nthe IS server,\nthe HTTP authentication, bytes,\n\n1191\n00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:16.250\nthe system container,\nall that stuff in the scheme extension.\n\n1192\n00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:17.510\nAll that's been done.\n\n1193\n00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.610\nWe still have to worry about\nthe 56 pre-req software items\n\n1194\n00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:21.450\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n1195\n00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:23.840\nWe're gonna see those, and\nthose are gonna come up now.\n\n1196\n00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.030\nSo we're now gonna go ahead and\nactually start the install.\n\n1197\n00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:27.060\nThat's gonna be the next step.\n\n1198\n00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.740\n>> And the SMS document [INAUDIBLE]\nnow you got me saying SMS.\n\n1199\n00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.950\nThe SCCN documentation that we looked\nat earlier would have guided us through\n\n1200\n00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.300\nwhat we needed to config IAS.\n\n1201\n00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.430\n>> Absolutely.\n>> The different check\n\n1202\n00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:38.840\nmarks that we selected in there.\n\n1203\n00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.640\n>> Absolutely, it certainly\nwill at least as I pointed out.\n\n1204\n00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.160\nThe ones from Microsoft Directory right?\n\n1205\n00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.720\nThere are a lot of hey, let me do this.\n\n1206\n00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.510\nLet me show you how to do it.\n\n1207\n00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:46.570\nHow to guides out there.\n\n1208\n00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:49.250\nA lot of them are very good by the way,\nwritten by third parties and\n\n1209\n00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:50.410\nthere are some that are spectacular.\n\n1210\n00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:52.010\nThey're really, really good.\n\n1211\n00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:58.020\nBut I usually recommend them only because,\nunless you know exactly who to follow and\n\n1212\n00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:01.690\nwho's really good, you may wind\nup getting one who's not so good.\n\n1213\n00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:04.860\nAnd if you go to the Microsoft stuff and\nuse the Microsoft stuff we looked at,\n\n1214\n00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:09.590\nyou're gonna get good guide and say how\nto choose they have step by step guides.\n\n1215\n00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:12.530\nThere's all the stuff you need out there\non the deployment page we've shown in\n\n1216\n00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:14.410\nthe URLs for right?\n\n1217\n00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:15.360\n>> Right.\n>> So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n1218\n00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.300\nwe're going to launch the product.\n\n1219\n00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.320\n>> Now I showed you I already\nhave the splash screen up and\n\n1220\n00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.670\nrunning, I'm just gonna zoom in ,so you\ncan see it but I launched that already.\n\n1221\n00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:24.580\nYou can see it here,\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n1222\n00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.300\nuse the install feature right there.\n\n1223\n00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.410\nTo be able to install, you would\nobviously have to download this product,\n\n1224\n00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.660\nit just doesn't magically appear right?\n\n1225\n00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:32.280\nYou have to get it.\n\n1226\n00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.310\nIf you've obviously licensed the product,\nyou're gonna get it from\n\n1227\n00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:38.420\nthe Microsoft partners site\nthrough the MSDN download area.\n\n1228\n00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:43.070\nIf you are using a demo version or a 90\nday eval, you're going to get that off\n\n1229\n00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:46.940\nthe download site from technet, probably\nthrough the Microsoft downloads area.\n\n1230\n00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.300\nSo just keep in mind you have\nto go out and get this media.\n\n1231\n00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.040\nWe've obviously done all that for\nyou ahead of time,\n\n1232\n00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.010\nput it in here, set it up ,so\nwe can then execute the install.\n\n1233\n00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:57.058\nYou're going to have to go out and do the\nheavy lifting to acquire that on your own.\n\n1234\n00:54:57.058 --> 00:54:59.160\nAll right ,so we're going to go ahead,\nwe're going to click install.\n\n1235\n00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:03.970\nWhen we do that, it'll take just a second\nto spin up here, we're gonna then be able\n\n1236\n00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:07.890\nto go ahead and you'll see it's gonna get\nstarted and launch the install for us.\n\n1237\n00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:13.320\nWe get a before you begin page, now\nthe before you begin page is interesting,\n\n1238\n00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.100\nit does tell us a couple of things\nthat we want to be aware of here,\n\n1239\n00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:20.800\nlet's just scroll and zoom in verify you\nhave a supported Microsoft SQL server\n\n1240\n00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.340\nInstall available for\nconfig manager to use.\n\n1241\n00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:27.180\nWe have shown you several times\nwhat the pre-req requirements are,\n\n1242\n00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.360\nthe versions that are supported.\n\n1243\n00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.690\nI've talked about those,\n\n1244\n00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:33.320\nif you don't have that available\nyou need to make sure that you do.\n\n1245\n00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.590\nIdentify the FQDN of the computer\nthat's running Microsoft SQL.\n\n1246\n00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:39.760\nAgain, because we're gonna path to\nthat and put our database out there.\n\n1247\n00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.600\nIf not we're going to install one on\nthis machine and we have that option.\n\n1248\n00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.760\nSo be aware of that.\n\n1249\n00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.420\nAlso confirm that the computers for\n\n1250\n00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.920\nconfig manager site systems meet\nminimum system requirements.\n\n1251\n00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.980\nRemember you're going to want to go\nout and check out what those are.\n\n1252\n00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:54.720\nWarning this program is copyrighted\nby law and international treaty.\n\n1253\n00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.110\nObviously important to know that.\n\n1254\n00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:57.750\nAnd there are release notes, and\n\n1255\n00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:00.040\nyou have a hyperlink there\nto go to the release notes.\n\n1256\n00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.348\nAlways good to read the release notes and\nbe aware of what's going on with that.\n\n1257\n00:56:03.348 --> 00:56:07.046\nWant to make sure we just have a sense of\nthe kind of things that are going to go\n\n1258\n00:56:07.046 --> 00:56:07.867\non, features,\n\n1259\n00:56:07.867 --> 00:56:11.588\ntips, how to steps in terms of installs\nthings like that, things to know.\n\n1260\n00:56:11.588 --> 00:56:14.119\nSo it's usually a good\nsource of information.\n\n1261\n00:56:14.119 --> 00:56:15.190\nWe're gonna click next.\n\n1262\n00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:20.500\nWe are gonna have, and\nthis is good for you to see as well.\n\n1263\n00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.660\nWe've talked about this.\n\n1264\n00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:25.510\nWe're gonna install a Config Manager\nprimary site, as you can see, and\n\n1265\n00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:29.650\nwe have the option below that to\nuse typical install options or\n\n1266\n00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:32.000\nto check off the box for\nstandalone primary site.\n\n1267\n00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.540\nRemember, if we're doing a standalone\nprimary site, which a lot of people do,\n\n1268\n00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.380\nthat's gonna be an all-in-one install.\n\n1269\n00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.890\nYou'll see we installed\nthe config manager primary site.\n\n1270\n00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:41.340\nUsed default install path.\n\n1271\n00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.010\nConfigure local SQL server\nwith default setting.\n\n1272\n00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:45.490\nEnable Local Management point for\n\n1273\n00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:49.450\nConfig Manager enable local\ndistribution point for Config Manager.\n\n1274\n00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:54.760\nWe can install a Config Manager primary\nsite without doing a typical install.\n\n1275\n00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.620\nEffectively we check off\nthe typical install option.\n\n1276\n00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.020\nWe're getting a local install of SQL.\n\n1277\n00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:02.470\nWe want a stand alone primary site.\n\n1278\n00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.220\nWhen we want to be able to path\nto an external SQL database,\n\n1279\n00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.840\nwe leave the radio button\nselected as it is.\n\n1280\n00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:10.860\nWe do not, do not check off the box below.\n\n1281\n00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.210\nAnd then we're gonna be asked where SQL\nis and where we want to go grab it.\n\n1282\n00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:17.430\nSo we have to make some option choices,\nbased on how we want to install.\n\n1283\n00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:22.110\nNotice we also have the option to install\nConfig Manager Central Admin site, and\n\n1284\n00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:23.490\nto recover a site.\n\n1285\n00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:27.710\nNotice that upgrading this config manager\nsite, performing site maintenance,\n\n1286\n00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:31.000\ninstalling or uninstalling rather,\nall are not available to us because\n\n1287\n00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.330\nwe haven't installed anything yet, and\nwe have no way to uninstall or repair.\n\n1288\n00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:36.230\nSo the wizard is smart.\n\n1289\n00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:38.242\nRight and\nwe have to obviously be aware of that.\n\n1290\n00:57:38.242 --> 00:57:40.600\nAll right we are going to\nselect the install and\n\n1291\n00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.990\nthen we're going to select\nthe typical install.\n\n1292\n00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:45.790\nWe're going to do the checkbox there\nbecause we're going to do the all in on\n\n1293\n00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:47.870\ninstall just for\nthe sake of time and brevity.\n\n1294\n00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:50.850\nObviously in the real world we would\nprobably path out to an existing SQL\n\n1295\n00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:52.110\ninstall somewhere else.\n\n1296\n00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:54.950\nBut for just our purposes,\nfor demo purposes,\n\n1297\n00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:57.970\nwe're gonna actually check off that\nbox and have it do everything for us.\n\n1298\n00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:58.960\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n1299\n00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.380\nI am making that selection,\njust so you know.\n\n1300\n00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:03.240\nBut I just wanted to point it out to you,\n\n1301\n00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.810\nthat way you are aware\nof what we're gonna do.\n\n1302\n00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.310\nWe're gonna hit Next.\n\n1303\n00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.250\nAnd we're just gonna give it a second.\n\n1304\n00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:12.210\nThumbs up.\nIt says, hey,\n\n1305\n00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:14.900\nwhen you use the typical\ninstall option right there,\n\n1306\n00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:17.210\nit's a stand-alone primary site installed.\n\n1307\n00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:20.010\nYou can expand this site into\na hierarchy at a later time\n\n1308\n00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:21.790\nby installing central\nadministration Admin Site.\n\n1309\n00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:25.570\nI mentioned this way back in our first\nepisode when we did a quick walk through\n\n1310\n00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:29.810\nand I said, hey by the way when we first\nhad twelve, the initial RTM product.\n\n1311\n00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:31.560\nWhen you did this you\ncould not expand that.\n\n1312\n00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:34.130\nThat was an all in one choice and\nboom you were done.\n\n1313\n00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:38.260\nYou had to tear it down in order to then\nget to a advanced hierarchy, multilevel or\n\n1314\n00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.200\nmulti site hierarchy.\n\n1315\n00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:45.170\nSince 2012 SP1 moving into R2 we\nnow the ability to do that in R2.\n\n1316\n00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:46.000\nSo this is new.\n\n1317\n00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.030\nThis is a new R2 feature.\n\n1318\n00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:49.840\nJust want to point that out to you,\nmake sure you're aware of that.\n\n1319\n00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.890\nDo you want to continue?\n\n1320\n00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:51.860\nWell, again duh.\n\n1321\n00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:53.040\nNo, I don't want to continue.\n\n1322\n00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.005\nI went to all this trouble.\n\n1323\n00:58:54.005 --> 00:58:57.120\n[LAUGH] Talk to you for an hour, and\nI decided you know what, I'm done.\n\n1324\n00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.100\nI don't wanna do this anymore.\n\n1325\n00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.920\nSo now, we have to install and\n\n1326\n00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.700\nwe're going to chose install\nthe evaluation edition of this product.\n\n1327\n00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.150\nBecause we're not installing\na licensed version.\n\n1328\n00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:10.480\nIf we were installing the full license\nversion we'd put out license key in there\n\n1329\n00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.390\nso obviously we're gonna figure that out.\n\n1330\n00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:15.090\nWe're gonna do the Evaluation Edition.\n\n1331\n00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:18.830\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\naccept the Licensing Agreement.\n\n1332\n00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:25.977\nWe then have to accept additional\nlicensing agreements as you can see here\n\n1333\n00:59:25.977 --> 00:59:30.730\nin SQL Server Express, SQL Server\nNative Client and Silverlight 5.0.\n\n1334\n00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.330\nI guess those rumors and\n\n1335\n00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:34.780\nmyths about Silverlight going the way\nof the dinosaurs are not true.\n\n1336\n00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.500\n>> It's still there.\n\n1337\n00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.330\n>> It is still there and\nit is there because we need it for\n\n1338\n00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:38.550\nthe web services and accounts.\n\n1339\n00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:39.080\n>> Well, okay.\n\n1340\n00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:39.990\n>> Which is why it is there.\n\n1341\n00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:41.100\n>> Yeah, right, okay.\n\n1342\n00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:45.960\n>> So we're gonna accept those licensing\nfeatures, or rather those licensing EULAs.\n\n1343\n00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.180\nSo we're just going to go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n1344\n00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:49.950\nIf you are one of those people\nwho likes to read those licensing\n\n1345\n00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:50.890\nrequirements, just go ahead and\n\n1346\n00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:53.830\nclick on any of the hyperlinks above\nthe checked boxes you are selecting, and\n\n1347\n00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:56.160\nthe licensing agreements are all there and\nI should take a look at them.\n\n1348\n00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:58.700\nWe're going to go ahead and click next.\n\n1349\n00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.219\nNow download required files.\n\n1350\n01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.570\nThis is where we are gonna go in and we\nare going to have to download those 56 odd\n\n1351\n01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.420\nsoftware requirements that I\ntalked about that are necessary.\n\n1352\n01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:12.270\nSo we can either download them or\nhave them already available.\n\n1353\n01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:14.315\nWe have two options as you can see.\n\n1354\n01:00:14.315 --> 01:00:17.115\nEither download them and then specify\nwhere you're gonna get them or\n\n1355\n01:00:17.115 --> 01:00:18.895\nuse previously downloaded files.\n\n1356\n01:00:18.895 --> 01:00:21.925\nNow I did give you,\nas one of the URLs that Mike showed you,\n\n1357\n01:00:21.925 --> 01:00:23.565\na link that shows you what\nall the pre-reqs are.\n\n1358\n01:00:23.565 --> 01:00:25.915\nAnd if you drill through that\ndocumentation we've pointed out to you,\n\n1359\n01:00:25.915 --> 01:00:27.245\nyou will see a list there and\n\n1360\n01:00:27.245 --> 01:00:30.465\nyou actually have links to download\nthem and you can go and get them all.\n\n1361\n01:00:30.465 --> 01:00:31.845\nBut remember what I told you.\n\n1362\n01:00:31.845 --> 01:00:35.200\nThere may be newer versions of certain\nthings that come out from time to time.\n\n1363\n01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.080\nI had an occasion recently,\nI was doing some work on my laptop,\n\n1364\n01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.000\nhad to get something uninstalled,\nI think it was the whole Java thing,\n\n1365\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.570\nwe were messing around with trying\nto get the client working, and\n\n1366\n01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:46.010\nit had uninstalled some of\nthe earlier versions of Java.\n\n1367\n01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.830\nSo I went into the control panel just to\nmake sure it cleaned up after itself, and\n\n1368\n01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:50.840\nI happened to look at all\nthe stuff I have installed.\n\n1369\n01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.990\nI have a whole bunch of\nthe Visual Studio C++ redistributables\n\n1370\n01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:58.100\ninstalled going back to like all\nthe way to probably the 2005 version.\n\n1371\n01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.750\nFor all sorts of stuff I have running.\n\n1372\n01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.510\nAnd then there's 2008,\nthere's 3 or 4 versions of each.\n\n1373\n01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:05.750\nSo there are multiple versions\nof some of these installation\n\n1374\n01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.990\nsoftware packages that may exist already,\nor may not be there, and\n\n1375\n01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:10.910\nyou wanna make sure you\nhave the most recent one.\n\n1376\n01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:16.470\nSo making sure that you don't use\nthe pre-cached downloaded files from five\n\n1377\n01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:20.460\nyears ago, but rather you go out and get\nthe most recent version when you do this,\n\n1378\n01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.900\nit's gonna be a good best practice for\nyou.\n\n1379\n01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.800\nJust wanna point that out,\nmake sure you're aware of that,\n\n1380\n01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.210\nit's gonna make our choices here.\n\n1381\n01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:28.260\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do here is we're gonna go\n\n1382\n01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:31.190\nahead and create a download folder,\nso we know where to put this stuff.\n\n1383\n01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:33.410\nBecause it's gonna go ahead and\ndownload for us right away.\n\n1384\n01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:36.800\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to\nBrowse, and I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n1385\n01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.710\nI'm gonna create a little directory here.\n\n1386\n01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:41.830\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna put this into the C drive.\n\n1387\n01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:46.560\nAnd I'm going to just make a folder.\n\n1388\n01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.990\nSo I'm just gonna go to this PC, and\n\n1389\n01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:53.390\nI'm just gonna scroll down here and\nI'm just gonna go to the C drive.\n\n1390\n01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.670\nAnd in the C drive I'm just\ngonna make a new folder.\n\n1391\n01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:59.130\nAnd I'm gonna call that new folder prereq.\n\n1392\n01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:01.930\nYou can pretty much call it anything\nyou'd like, it doesn't really matter, but\n\n1393\n01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:04.839\nI'm gonna call it Prereq just so\nI know what it is.\n\n1394\n01:02:04.839 --> 01:02:07.680\nAnd you'll see that I just went ahead and\ncreated right there.\n\n1395\n01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.660\nAll right, so I'm just creating it in\nthe new file or new folder wizard,\n\n1396\n01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:12.180\nI'm gonna click OK.\n\n1397\n01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.470\nIt's gonna put the path in there for me.\n\n1398\n01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:17.660\nI could type the path in, but I have\nto create the folder before I do that.\n\n1399\n01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:20.060\nIt would be nice if it did it for\nus, but it doesn't do that.\n\n1400\n01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:23.469\nAnd then what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna\nhit next and then watch what happens.\n\n1401\n01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:26.580\nIt's gonna start\ndownloading automatically.\n\n1402\n01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.930\nAnd you know how I knew\nthat there were 56 prereqs?\n\n1403\n01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:30.980\nWhat does that number say?\n\n1404\n01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:31.920\n1 of 56, right.\n\n1405\n01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.590\nSo it does help you to pay attention\nto details in certain cases.\n\n1406\n01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:40.780\nSo we have 56 downloads or\n56 items that we have to download for\n\n1407\n01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.690\nsoftware requirements that\nare gonna be downloaded and\n\n1408\n01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.390\nthen potentially configured for install.\n\n1409\n01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:45.570\nSo we're gonna be going through and\ndoing that.\n\n1410\n01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:48.910\nIt's gonna take a minute or two to do\nthat, so while we're letting that cook,\n\n1411\n01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:51.510\nlet's just talk about a couple of\nquick things you wanna be aware of.\n\n1412\n01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:55.460\nI did mention in one of my prier,\nI'm creating new works,\n\n1413\n01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.860\none of my prior conversations and\ncould you actually.\n\n1414\n01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.610\nCan we go over to Mike's machine for\njust a minute?\n\n1415\n01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.100\nI wanna have him type something up on\nthe screen real quick while we're talking.\n\n1416\n01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.820\nSo if we can just do screen share for\nhim if that's possible for a minute?\n\n1417\n01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.220\n>> Are you on Word or\n>> On notepad is fine,\n\n1418\n01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.730\njust want to give\nthe nice people out there\n\n1419\n01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:14.520\na little item that I just want them\nto take note of for PowerShell.\n\n1420\n01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:18.332\nSo, what we're going to do is quickly tell\nyou what you need to do to be able to\n\n1421\n01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:19.585\nconfigure PowerShell,\n\n1422\n01:03:19.585 --> 01:03:23.342\nto make sure you do the import on\nthe configuration manager modules that you\n\n1423\n01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:27.601\nneed to manage if you're not going to load\nPowerShell from within the SSCM console.\n\n1424\n01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:29.392\nFor some odd reason you're\njust not doing that.\n\n1425\n01:03:29.392 --> 01:03:34.284\nSo what you're going to want to do is\ngo out to the configuration manager\n\n1426\n01:03:34.284 --> 01:03:35.351\ninstall path.\n\n1427\n01:03:35.351 --> 01:03:40.343\nSo that's simply going to be\n\n1428\n01:03:40.343 --> 01:03:48.250\nthe programfilesx86(x86)/ right.\n\n1429\n01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:52.290\n>> And then we're gonna go Microsoft\nspace configuration space manager.\n\n1430\n01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:54.240\nImportant to include spaces\nwhen you need them there.\n\n1431\n01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.410\n>> Microsoft configuration manager?\n\n1432\n01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:56.740\n>> Yeah, Microsoft configuration manager.\n\n1433\n01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.830\nThere it a space between program and\nfiles by the way.\n\n1434\n01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:01.410\nI know you can go back and\nfix that when we're done.\n\n1435\n01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:02.219\nJust I forgot to mention that.\n\n1436\n01:04:02.219 --> 01:04:06.846\nProgram configuration, Microsoft\nconfiguration manager backslash and\n\n1437\n01:04:06.846 --> 01:04:09.498\nthen adminconsole all one word no spaces.\n\n1438\n01:04:09.498 --> 01:04:14.818\nAdmin console\\bin And\nthen in this directory.\n\n1439\n01:04:14.818 --> 01:04:19.344\nSo this is the path you want to change\ninto in Powershow in order to be able then\n\n1440\n01:04:19.344 --> 01:04:21.400\nexecute the following item.\n\n1441\n01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.786\nYou are then going to go ahead and\ntype in import-module.\n\n1442\n01:04:28.339 --> 01:04:35.210\n-name -configurationmanager\nall one word oops.\n\n1443\n01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.995\n>> No dash for that one.\n\n1444\n01:04:35.995 --> 01:04:40.180\n>> Configurationmanager,\nno dash, right yeah,\n\n1445\n01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:47.495\nname configurationmanager right good,\nall one word, .psd1.\n\n1446\n01:04:47.495 --> 01:04:51.295\nGood and so when you change in you may\nwant to zoom in so they can probably see\n\n1447\n01:04:51.295 --> 01:04:53.905\nthat a little better in case they\nwant to copy that down real quick.\n\n1448\n01:04:53.905 --> 01:04:57.165\nSo what you're doing here is\neffectively you're changing\n\n1449\n01:04:57.165 --> 01:04:58.375\nas I will to the side here.\n\n1450\n01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:01.947\nThe IT Pro TV studios are suddenly adrift,\nand we hit a rock, and\n\n1451\n01:05:01.947 --> 01:05:03.297\nwe're slowly taking on water.\n\n1452\n01:05:03.297 --> 01:05:07.497\nSo we're floating and I'm going off to\nthe side as I saw myself drifting out of\n\n1453\n01:05:07.497 --> 01:05:08.477\nthe frame there for a second.\n\n1454\n01:05:08.477 --> 01:05:10.537\nThat's what happens when you\nstand on the edge of the pad and\n\n1455\n01:05:10.537 --> 01:05:13.833\nyou happen to fall off,\nyou start lilting to one site.\n\n1456\n01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:17.463\nSo what see here is we have\na pass statement at the top\n\n1457\n01:05:17.463 --> 01:05:21.613\nthat allows us to change into\nthe proper directory, subdirectory,\n\n1458\n01:05:21.613 --> 01:05:25.143\nsubdirectory, etc, to ultimately\nend PowerShell, right, we do a CD.\n\n1459\n01:05:25.143 --> 01:05:28.823\nNow, if you know how to change\ndirectories in PowerShell, by the way?\n\n1460\n01:05:28.823 --> 01:05:29.833\n>> Just type.\n\n1461\n01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:32.220\n>> No, CD, type CD.\n\n1462\n01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.160\nAnd then you have to put a quote around\nthat because it's a little string that\n\n1463\n01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.100\nwe want to go to.\n\n1464\n01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.960\n>> I do love the, oops\n>> And\n\n1465\n01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.250\nyou want to make sure you don't do that\nbecause that will screw things up.\n\n1466\n01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.190\n>> Yeah, that would makes things bad.\n\n1467\n01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:43.950\n>> Yeah, so you want to put that in there\nbecause we need to be able to tell it,\n\n1468\n01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:45.360\nhey go to this exact literal string.\n\n1469\n01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.530\nThis is where I want to go, so\nwe are going to do a change directory.\n\n1470\n01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:50.280\nWe are going to this path, now again,\n\n1471\n01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.460\nthis assumes that you've installed\ninto the default directory by the way.\n\n1472\n01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:56.400\nShame on you if you did not,\nshame on you if you did not write down\n\n1473\n01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.770\nwhere you put it because now you\nhave to figure out where it is.\n\n1474\n01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:00.289\nBut this is where you are going to go,\n\n1475\n01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:03.281\nthe thing that would change would\nprobably be Program files(x86).\n\n1476\n01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:05.981\nThe rest of that string should be\nthe same because that's gonna be there\n\n1477\n01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:08.250\ndefault install string\nno matter where you go.\n\n1478\n01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:09.010\nSo we're gonna go in there,\n\n1479\n01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:13.290\ngo to bin, and inside of there you're\ngonna find ConfigManager.psd1.\n\n1480\n01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:16.130\nThe import module and\nthen the name designation\n\n1481\n01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:18.880\nis the command in powershell that tells\nyou how to actually import those modules.\n\n1482\n01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.590\nSo you actually can set that up,\nso that's gonna be helpful.\n\n1483\n01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:23.280\nAll right, good, so\nlet's go back to my machine.\n\n1484\n01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.710\nWe're gonna go ahead and\npick up where we left off.\n\n1485\n01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:29.760\nWe actually finished the pre req\ndownloads, we're ready to go ahead and\n\n1486\n01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.000\nspecify our site code.\n\n1487\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.060\nSo if we can go back to my machine we'll\ngo ahead and see that, there we go.\n\n1488\n01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.610\nAnd what we're going to be\nable to see on the screen\n\n1489\n01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:38.700\nis that we're now being\nprompted to put in a site code.\n\n1490\n01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:42.410\nSo through magic I'm going to go ahead and\ndisappear, poof.\n\n1491\n01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:44.180\nWait let me try that again, poof.\n\n1492\n01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.695\nThere, ooh see,\nIt actually worked that time, I'm gone.\n\n1493\n01:06:47.695 --> 01:06:49.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm no longer here,\n\n1494\n01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:51.355\nI'm coming to a theater\nnear you very soon.\n\n1495\n01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:52.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we're gonna see now is\n\n1496\n01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.210\nthe site code that we're\nbeing prompted for.\n\n1497\n01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:57.440\nRemember we talked about the value of\nsite codes and why they're important.\n\n1498\n01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.230\nYou could see there,\nwe're going to have to put one in.\n\n1499\n01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:00.780\nThree digits alphanumerically.\n\n1500\n01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.690\nCan mix and match,\nyou can do p01, you could do 000,\n\n1501\n01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:08.190\nyou could do abc, but it's three digits\nalphanumeric and you're stuck with it.\n\n1502\n01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:11.420\n>> Oh, I was gonna say, you said we could\nuse whatever we want and change it later.\n\n1503\n01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:12.766\n>> No, I did not, not since site code.\n\n1504\n01:07:12.766 --> 01:07:13.383\n>> Absolutely not.\n\n1505\n01:07:13.383 --> 01:07:14.046\n>> I did not say that.\n\n1506\n01:07:14.046 --> 01:07:15.327\n>> Unless you want to start all over.\n\n1507\n01:07:15.327 --> 01:07:16.845\n>> Unless you want to\nstart all over again,\n\n1508\n01:07:16.845 --> 01:07:19.549\nin which case you could certainly\nchange it as often as you would like.\n\n1509\n01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:21.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mike's available for parties and\n\n1510\n01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:22.200\nbar mitzvahs by the way.\n\n1511\n01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.060\n>> That's right. [LAUGH] >>\nCharges by the hour, all right so\n\n1512\n01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.700\nwhat we're gonna do here.\n\n1513\n01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.160\nAgain, you're gonna make up the cycle.\n\n1514\n01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.180\nNow what I do tell my customers, and\nI'm gonna type in P01 by the way, for\n\n1515\n01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.240\nmy side code there.\n\n1516\n01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.550\n>> Do you have any type of naming\nconventions you like to use?\n\n1517\n01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:38.875\n>> I do, let me just type in P01 so\nI can get that in there.\n\n1518\n01:07:38.875 --> 01:07:41.920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, naming conventions are important,\n\n1519\n01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.170\nbut they're kind of tough with site codes,\n\n1520\n01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:46.620\nbecause you obviously have three letters\nand numbers in some combination.\n\n1521\n01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:49.580\nAnd the reality is it is very tough to\ncome up with something that makes sense\n\n1522\n01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.806\nthat's gonna align with\nyour naming convention.\n\n1523\n01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:55.960\nSo instead of trying to do that,\nwhat I tell customers is keep it simple.\n\n1524\n01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.630\nUse the first letter, whatever the letter\nis of the domain that you're in,\n\n1525\n01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:04.260\nyour namespace so\nif it's ABC Corp, do A and then if\n\n1526\n01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:08.600\nit's the very first site you're installing\ndo 01 because it's just very simple.\n\n1527\n01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.880\nYou're always gonna figure that out and\nknow what it is.\n\n1528\n01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.080\nIf it's the third site you're doing,\ndo A03 that way you know.\n\n1529\n01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.950\nSo it's just very simple because that way\nyou don't get caught up in this crazy.\n\n1530\n01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:22.055\nOh my god I've got to come up with\nsomething, what does it mean?\n\n1531\n01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:26.360\nAnd if somebody ever figures out what I\ndid will they be able to know what I did\n\n1532\n01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.550\nor didn't do?\n\n1533\n01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:31.970\nJust keep it simple right, so\nfirst letter of the domain name space and\n\n1534\n01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:35.850\nthen 01 for your first site,\n02 for your second site, 03.\n\n1535\n01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:38.340\nYou're violating the rule by the way,\njust to point this out.\n\n1536\n01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.630\nBecause everything else we\ndo not only in Windows but\n\n1537\n01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:43.240\nin most operating systems,\nwe start numbering from zero.\n\n1538\n01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.470\nZero is actually one for most stakes, but\n\n1539\n01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:48.320\nthe reason I tell people not to use\nzero to represent the first site\n\n1540\n01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:53.260\nis that at some point they get confused\nand, or somebody follows them and\n\n1541\n01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:57.280\ncreates another site and\ndoesn't know that they followed the rule.\n\n1542\n01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:01.040\nAnd zero is the first one and they go and\nthey may screw up the ordering.\n\n1543\n01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.030\nAnd remember,\nsite codes have to be unique.\n\n1544\n01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:07.300\nSo I tend to tell them 01 for\nfirst site, 02 for second site.\n\n1545\n01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:11.270\nBecause that's obvious,\nIf you got 100 sites, you get to 99,\n\n1546\n01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:12.890\nyou're out of luck at that point.\n\n1547\n01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:14.538\nBut my point is not gonna get that big.\n\n1548\n01:09:14.538 --> 01:09:17.100\nAnd we know you're not gonna get big,\nyou're not gonna get that many sites.\n\n1549\n01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.790\nBut it's easy though at that point,\nyou see 01, you know it's my first site.\n\n1550\n01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:20.390\n>> Perfect.\n>> And so\n\n1551\n01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:25.290\nit's very easy to keep track of that way,\nso, simplifying the insanely obvious and\n\n1552\n01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:26.895\nthe mundane, that's my job.\n\n1553\n01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:27.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n1554\n01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:29.940\nwhat we're gonna do there,\nis we're gonna do that.\n\n1555\n01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.660\nNow we also have to specify a site name.\n\n1556\n01:09:32.730 --> 01:09:35.280\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to type in, and\n\n1557\n01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.710\nagain, your site name\nis gonna be up to you.\n\n1558\n01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:42.490\nYou can call it anything you like,\nI use a very, very important and very,\n\n1559\n01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:44.670\nvery basic concept for my site names.\n\n1560\n01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:45.770\nMine says Primary Site.\n\n1561\n01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:48.890\n>> Nice, [LAUGH] gotta say keep it simple.\n\n1562\n01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:50.800\n>> Yes, keep it simple, all right, so.\n\n1563\n01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.580\nThe site name,\nyou can call whatever you like there,\n\n1564\n01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.520\nI'm gonna call mine Primary Site,\nIt's up to you.\n\n1565\n01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.880\nWe have our installation folder,\nit's gonna go ahead and install.\n\n1566\n01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.750\nAnd we're gonna install\nthe Config Manager console, by the way.\n\n1567\n01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:03.900\nAs part of that, you can see that check\nbox right down there meaning that the site\n\n1568\n01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.050\nserver is going to have\nthe console on it as well.\n\n1569\n01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:09.400\nWe can install the console separately\non multiple workstations and\n\n1570\n01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.910\nthen use it to remotely manage, but we\nwant to have it running on the site server\n\n1571\n01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:14.770\nso we can do management\nlocally if necessary.\n\n1572\n01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:19.530\nIt may not always do that, but it's always\na good idea to do that because initially\n\n1573\n01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:21.850\nout of the box once we do the install\nwe're gonna wanna go in and\n\n1574\n01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:23.200\nconfigure certain things.\n\n1575\n01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.690\nAnd if we don't install the console,\nwe can't get into the product, right?\n\n1576\n01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:29.480\nThat's why it's there by default, so you\njust wanna make sure you're aware of that.\n\n1577\n01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.500\nSo we're going to to ahead and\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n1578\n01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.830\nWe don't wanna join the customer\nexperience program so\n\n1579\n01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.450\nwe're gonna go ahead and opt out of that.\n\n1580\n01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.290\nThat's all that is on\nthat screen by the way.\n\n1581\n01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:40.892\nWe then have a little summary\nof what's about to happen.\n\n1582\n01:10:40.892 --> 01:10:43.690\nWe're gonna click Next on\nour summary screen, and\n\n1583\n01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:48.530\nthen what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna get the prereq checker running.\n\n1584\n01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:50.275\nI'm gonna let it run\na sec before I zoom in,\n\n1585\n01:10:50.275 --> 01:10:53.430\ncuz I just wanna show you couple of\nthings that's gonna happen here.\n\n1586\n01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:56.890\nSo what's gonna happen is\nthat it's gonna run and\n\n1587\n01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:59.840\nit's going to show us things\nlike WSUS on the site server.\n\n1588\n01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.510\nVerifying site server permissions\nto publish to active dire.\n\n1589\n01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:04.731\nIt's supposed to active directory cuz\nI didn't move it all the way out.\n\n1590\n01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:05.411\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n1591\n01:11:05.411 --> 01:11:07.869\nconfiguration for\nSQL server memory usage and\n\n1592\n01:11:07.869 --> 01:11:11.300\nserver process,\nSQL server process memory allocation.\n\n1593\n01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.160\nAre all warnings, now you could select and\nsee what the warning is on these,\n\n1594\n01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.960\nit's perfectly fine, the system's\ngonna install with no trouble.\n\n1595\n01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.310\nIt's warning us cuz it doesn't necessarily\nlike the configuration we've chosen,\n\n1596\n01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:26.210\nit would prefer to have some additional\nheadroom for memory, things like that.\n\n1597\n01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.650\nNo big deal,\nit's still gonna work just fine,\n\n1598\n01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:32.920\nas long as you don't see error there,\nas opposed to warning, you're fine.\n\n1599\n01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.530\nBut that doesn't mean that\nyou shouldn't at least check\n\n1600\n01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:37.210\nto be able to make sure\nyou know what's going on.\n\n1601\n01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.650\nSo, for instance,\nwe highlight one of these.\n\n1602\n01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:44.500\nWhat we will find is, and\nyou have to scroll to see the whole thing,\n\n1603\n01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.370\nbut you highlight one, and\n\n1604\n01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:48.220\nyou'll see there is a description\ndown below of what the warning is.\n\n1605\n01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:52.820\nConfig manager requires WSUS of at least\nversion 3.0 SP2 with those patches or\n\n1606\n01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:56.130\nlater if using remote software update\npoints, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1607\n01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:58.810\nSo that's fine, we're not worried about\nthat right now because when we get to what\n\n1608\n01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.940\nwe wanna use, the software update feature.\n\n1609\n01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:04.419\nWe're gonna either have a WSUS server\nconfigured or we'll install one.\n\n1610\n01:12:04.419 --> 01:12:06.655\nSo right now during the install,\nit's not a big deal,\n\n1611\n01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:09.729\nit's just warning us that we're gonna\nhave to provide that at some point.\n\n1612\n01:12:09.729 --> 01:12:11.338\nWhen we are ready to use it.\n\n1613\n01:12:11.338 --> 01:12:12.059\nThat's okay.\n\n1614\n01:12:12.059 --> 01:12:13.117\nWe'll deal with that later.\n\n1615\n01:12:13.117 --> 01:12:13.798\nNo problem, right?\n\n1616\n01:12:13.798 --> 01:12:16.750\nSo we're gonna know that, and\nwe're not gonna freak out about this.\n\n1617\n01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:19.440\nWe're just gonna understand\nthat that's far for the course.\n\n1618\n01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.100\nNow, this is everything we've done\nup until now has been effectively\n\n1619\n01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.710\nsetting up the configurations.\n\n1620\n01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:25.610\nFind what we want.\n\n1621\n01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:28.770\nWe ran the last item before the install,\nwhich is the pre req check.\n\n1622\n01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:34.790\nAnd now what we're gonna do Is begin\nour install right there, right?\n\n1623\n01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:37.720\nSo that's actually now gonna\nallow us to actually go ahead.\n\n1624\n01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.360\nWe're gonna hit begin install,\nand to start the install.\n\n1625\n01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.790\nNow, the install is gonna take some time,\nwere not gonna sit and\n\n1626\n01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:43.916\nwatch this whole thing cook.\n\n1627\n01:12:43.916 --> 01:12:47.074\nThis is the most important part of\nthe stuff we've done up until now,\n\n1628\n01:12:47.074 --> 01:12:50.230\nwhich is walking through the process\ntil now, hitting the button and\n\n1629\n01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:53.595\nwatching the bars go across the screen,\nnot very exciting, right?\n\n1630\n01:12:53.595 --> 01:12:56.512\nSo, we're gonna let this go for a second,\njust so we can capture a screen\n\n1631\n01:12:56.512 --> 01:12:59.622\nreal quick and show you one thing,\nbut basically we're off the races.\n\n1632\n01:12:59.622 --> 01:13:02.352\nThis is just gonna go do its thing and\nabout 20,\n\n1633\n01:13:02.352 --> 01:13:05.352\n30 minutes later, maybe a little\nbit longer depending on the number\n\n1634\n01:13:05.352 --> 01:13:08.472\nof pre reqs that have to be installed,\nhow fast the system is,\n\n1635\n01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:11.982\nhow much memory, how many processors,\nthat kind of stuff, few variables.\n\n1636\n01:13:11.982 --> 01:13:15.072\nBut in general depending on what\nwe've chosen, anywhere from about 20,\n\n1637\n01:13:15.072 --> 01:13:18.300\n30 minutes, maybe an hour or\nso, it'll finish up.\n\n1638\n01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:22.180\nSo, what we're seeing right now is, and\nI just wanna point this out to you so\n\n1639\n01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.520\nI'm gonna let it run for just another\nsecond here because it's doing something I\n\n1640\n01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.510\nwanna point out to you and I wanna make\nsure you see and I just want it to get to\n\n1641\n01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:32.320\nthe next step before I do the zoom\nin real quick so we can see it.\n\n1642\n01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.940\nWe are, okay, there we go.\n\n1643\n01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:37.610\nAnd there, I just zoom it.\n\n1644\n01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:38.840\nI just want to capture that.\n\n1645\n01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.500\nSo we're evaluating setup environment\nno big deal, evaluating an eManager,\n\n1646\n01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:46.000\ndependency is great, that third green\ncircle is one I was waiting on,\n\n1647\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.210\ngenerating public key and\nSQL Server certificates where self signing\n\n1648\n01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:53.010\ncertificates do the install because we\nhave to be able to use certificates to\n\n1649\n01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:57.410\nnot only secure this install but\ndid actually sign and evaluate identity\n\n1650\n01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:00.570\nto provide the encryption capabilities\nwe need to transmit data.\n\n1651\n01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:03.500\nSo, we're creating those keys locally,\nself-signing them and using them and\n\n1652\n01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.330\nthat's one of the first\nsteps in the process.\n\n1653\n01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:08.860\nAnd then we go from there and obviously\nthen additional things take place.\n\n1654\n01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:11.010\nWe can see as we come out and go back in,\n\n1655\n01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:13.640\nwe're setting up server accounts,\nupdating the registry.\n\n1656\n01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.330\nWe're beginning the setting up\nof the SQL Server database.\n\n1657\n01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:19.550\nFrom there, we're just gonna keep\ngoing and eventually we will finish.\n\n1658\n01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:21.350\nAll right, so we've walked you through.\n\n1659\n01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:26.790\nStep by step all the way through\nin fairly gruesome detail,\n\n1660\n01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:29.170\nright, excruciating detail.\n\n1661\n01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:30.480\nMike was dying here.\n\n1662\n01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.366\nHe was saying oh, my God, I need a chair.\n\n1663\n01:14:32.366 --> 01:14:34.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I gotta sit down right.\n\n1664\n01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.990\nAnd I sat here and stood the whole time.\n\n1665\n01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:37.550\nI sat here and stood, that's what I do.\n\n1666\n01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.000\nI stood here the whole time.\n\n1667\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:39.980\nAnd walked you through everything.\n\n1668\n01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.430\nWe talked you through the whole thing.\n\n1669\n01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:43.290\nAnd it's really important\nto see this done and\n\n1670\n01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:44.680\nto understand how it's done at least once.\n\n1671\n01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.470\nSo, that you can better understand\nthe steps that you're gonna\n\n1672\n01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:48.250\nengage in when you do this.\n\n1673\n01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.524\nRight?\nBecause, at some point,\n\n1674\n01:14:49.524 --> 01:14:50.960\nthis is most likely gonna be you.\n\n1675\n01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.680\nIt's not gonna be me.\n\n1676\n01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.800\nIt's not gonna be Mike.\n\n1677\n01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.150\nNow, the reality of most situations is,\n\n1678\n01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:58.270\na lot of these installs are done\nbefore you even take over the system.\n\n1679\n01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:01.670\nEither a consultant like myself or\nsomebody like me, may get hired by your\n\n1680\n01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:04.670\ncompany to come in and put it together for\nyou, in which case we sit there and\n\n1681\n01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:06.908\nwe do all this and\nhopefully you get to sit and watch.\n\n1682\n01:15:06.908 --> 01:15:09.490\nAnd that's gonna be important for\nyou to tag along and try and\n\n1683\n01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:11.660\ninsert yourself into that process,\nif you can.\n\n1684\n01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:12.630\nBut if you're not able to,\n\n1685\n01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:15.150\nif it happened before you arrived on\nthe scene, whatever, no big deal.\n\n1686\n01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:16.770\nHopefully, there's good documentation.\n\n1687\n01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:19.410\nChance is good there's probably not,\nbut hopefully there is.\n\n1688\n01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:20.330\nSo if there is great.\n\n1689\n01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:22.070\nIf not, guess what?\n\n1690\n01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:23.100\nIt's already been done.\n\n1691\n01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.400\nNot the end of the world,\nyou're just not gonna see it installed.\n\n1692\n01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.160\nBut if you do have the option to do that\nor if you actually can build it from\n\n1693\n01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.650\nscratch, it's great for you to put your\nhand on the product and walk through it.\n\n1694\n01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:35.180\nWhat we've done for you over the last\nhour-ish, hour and 15 minutes,\n\n1695\n01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:36.120\nwhatever it's been.\n\n1696\n01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.300\nTime flies when you're\ninstalling as I've often said.\n\n1697\n01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.770\nI have to say that because it's incredibly\n\n1698\n01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:40.459\nboring\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1699\n01:15:40.459 --> 01:15:42.159\n>> When you're sitting there doing it by\n\n1700\n01:15:42.159 --> 01:15:42.695\nyourself.\n\n1701\n01:15:42.695 --> 01:15:44.240\nSo, what we've done for you.\n\n1702\n01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.670\nIs we've actually walked you through and\ngiven you\n\n1703\n01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:50.220\nhopefully a good talk track narrative\nthat's given you the comfort level and\n\n1704\n01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:54.230\nthe opportunity to absorb that information\nas you review, so that you'll become more,\n\n1705\n01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:56.950\nnot only comfortable with doing\nthe install but comfortable thinking\n\n1706\n01:15:56.950 --> 01:16:00.470\nabout what has to happen so you can be\nsuccessful at planning to get through it.\n\n1707\n01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:03.210\nAnd also hitting the highlights and\nfocusing on the areas you need to know\n\n1708\n01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:06.100\nabout as key decision points, so\nyou know what you have to do and\n\n1709\n01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.730\nwhat the right decisions are at\nthose crossroads, so to speak.\n\n1710\n01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.370\n>> Very good, Adam,\nagain great episode there.\n\n1711\n01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:15.280\nGot to see installing\nSystem Center Configuration Manager 2012\n\n1712\n01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.390\nR2 from beginning to end,\nincluding getting everything ready.\n\n1713\n01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:20.710\nWe had to go in,\nwe had to extend the schema,\n\n1714\n01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:24.140\nwe had to make sure we had all\nthe prereqs installed like IIS.\n\n1715\n01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.750\nAnd then the different options within\nIIS We had to download the 56.\n\n1716\n01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.630\n>> 56\n>> The 56 little additional software\n\n1717\n01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:34.840\ninstallations that we had to do for\nthat and got to see the beginning of that.\n\n1718\n01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.690\nAnd of course we're not gonna watch the\nprogress bar for the rest of that install.\n\n1719\n01:16:37.690 -->

episode here at itpro.tv.\n\n4\n00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.020\n>> Exciting episode.\n\n5\n00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.030\n>> It's gonna be exciting.\n\n6\n00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.660\n>> Another one.\n\n7\n00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.240\n>> It is, I'm your host, Mike Roderick and\n\n8\n00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.710\ntoday we're doing our System Center\nConfiguration Manager 2012 R2 and\n\n9\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.520\nin this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at a post installation, right?\n\n10\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.750\nIn that previous episode,\nif you watch that,\n\n11\n00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.200\nwe went through the installation\nprocess of STCM 2012 R2.\n\n12\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.790\nAdam did a great demonstration so\n\n13\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.970\nif you haven't seen that yet,\nmake sure you go back and watch it.\n\n14\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.260\nOnce we get it installed, then what?\n\n15\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.160\nWe really need to verify that\neverything's installed properly,\n\n16\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.020\neverything's where it should be,\neverything's working.\n\n17\n00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.330\nSo we need to know where to go to look to\nverify that everything has installed or\n\n18\n00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.490\nif it hasn't, what the heck do we do.\n\n19\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.630\nSo here with me today is Adam Gordan.\n\n20\n00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.850\nHow's it going, Adam.\n\n21\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.100\n>> Good, what the heck do we do,\nI don't know, I'm at a loss.\n\n22\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.520\n>> Now, we're in trouble,\nyou stumped me, I'm not sure what to do.\n\n23\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.030\nSo I think we have to just stop and\nwe can't use the product anymore.\n\n24\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.540\nIf it doesn't work,\nI don't know what to do.\n\n25\n00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.610\nYou get rid of it,\ngo buy a competitive product.\n\n26\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.110\nBuy HP Openview,\n\n27\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.370\nTivoli or something like that cuz they\ninstall easier, doesn't take as long.\n\n28\n00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.786\nAll right, so what do we do,\n\n29\n00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:24.750\nMike actually poses a good question which\nis we've done all this work, right?\n\n30\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.360\nWe've figured it out, at least in\ntheory we hoped we figured it out.\n\n31\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.100\nThings have gone relatively well,\nwe hope that things have installed.\n\n32\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.440\nWe're gonna look at that and\nvalidate and make sure it's there.\n\n33\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.430\nBut if it is there,\ngreat, what do we do now?\n\n34\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.850\nWell, we're gonna spend a lot of our time\nin future episodes talking about that.\n\n35\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.990\nNot gonna spend too much\ntime on that right now, but\n\n36\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.740\nrather what do we do to make sure\nthat things are installed correctly?\n\n37\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.520\nAnd how do we just kick\nthe tires a little bit?\n\n38\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.110\nWhen you go out and buy something,\nwhat you really want to do is you\n\n39\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.360\nwant to make sure you get to take it for\na test spin.\n\n40\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.010\nMake sure it is living up to expectations,\nbut\n\n41\n00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.750\nthe problem with that is,\nwhat are your expectations?\n\n42\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.180\nAt the beginning, you may not really know.\n\n43\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.705\nYou gotta remember when we went out and\nbought one of the,\n\n44\n00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:05.535\nwe still have the car actually,\nso it was a minivan.\n\n45\n00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:06.535\nRight, we had kids,\n\n46\n00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:08.815\nyou need to have a minivan cause when\nyou have kids you gotta have a minivan.\n\n47\n00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:09.805\n>> Course.\n>> Kind of standard.\n\n48\n00:02:09.805 --> 00:02:11.355\n>> Right,\nat least that's what my wife told me.\n\n49\n00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:14.255\nSo I had a minivan, actually,\nI had two cuz she said,\n\n50\n00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:17.155\nyou gotta have one and if one breaks you\ngotta have another one, so we had two.\n\n51\n00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:20.280\nSo we went out,\nwe bought the second minivan.\n\n52\n00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.830\nAnd remember, we went out and\n\n53\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.410\nwe were looking for different dealers,\nthis option, that option, whatever.\n\n54\n00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.810\nWound up going to a dealer that\none of my family members said,\n\n55\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.890\nhey I know somebody at, let's go there,\nprobably give you a good deal.\n\n56\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.810\nWent and test drove a bunch of cars.\n\n57\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.230\nI didn't know anything about\nthis particular brand,\n\n58\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.090\nI've never driven their cars before.\n\n59\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.642\nI get in there, and my wife said,\nwell, you gotta drive,\n\n60\n00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:39.606\nyou gotta figure this out and tell us\nwhether or not you think it's good.\n\n61\n00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:42.050\nI'm like, it's a car, it drives,\nif it drives it's good.\n\n62\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.250\nNo, have all these features,\nthese bells and whistles,\n\n63\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.095\nyou gotta play with all that stuff,\nI'm like, I'm driving, driving.\n\n64\n00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:48.765\nI can't, yeah, TV, that's cool, but\n\n65\n00:02:48.765 --> 00:02:51.925\nI can't watch TV while I'm driving,\ndoesn't work that way.\n\n66\n00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:56.675\nSo sometimes features are importance,\nother times, not so much, right.\n\n67\n00:02:56.675 --> 00:03:00.005\nSo if you're in the driver's seat,\nwhat you need to really figure out is what\n\n68\n00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.125\nyou're going to focus on,\nwhat's important for you.\n\n69\n00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.755\nSo let's start by talking about some the\nthings that are going to be important post\n\n70\n00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:06.785\ninstallation, wanna kick the tires.\n\n71\n00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:09.580\nGotta make sure things are working so, if\nwe can go to my machine I wanna show you\n\n72\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.050\na couple of things that\nare gonna be important for you.\n\n73\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.870\nI wanna show you how\nyou're gonna find them and\n\n74\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.040\nhow we're gonna get there, all right?\n\n75\n00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.360\nSo, I've already opened up the console,\nbut\n\n76\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.300\na lot of times people ask well, okay smart\nguy, so how'd you get to, the console?\n\n77\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.840\n>> Well, I've got a news flash for\nyou smart people.\n\n78\n00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.801\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna show you.\n\n79\n00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:27.009\nAll right, so\nif we can go to full screen so\n\n80\n00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.105\nyou can see I just kind of wanna zoom in.\n\n81\n00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:31.872\nWhat we're gonna do is,\nwe're in a server 12 machine,\n\n82\n00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:34.760\nthis is gonna be our server\nthat we're actually hosting on.\n\n83\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.060\nSo what I'm gonna do is\ngo to the Start page,\n\n84\n00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.025\nI think that's what we're\ncalling it this week.\n\n85\n00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:41.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Microsoft hasn't changed that yet\n\n86\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.010\nagain And, what you're going\nto see on the start page, or\n\n87\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.570\nthe start pane I think is\nthe actual proper terminology.\n\n88\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.260\nWhat we see there is,\nwe see a bunch of tiles,\n\n89\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.640\nthey're no longer called live tiles or\nmetro tiles, they're simply called tiles.\n\n90\n00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.800\n>> Lawsuits will do that.\n\n91\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.338\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\njust like Skydrive is no longer Skydrive.\n\n92\n00:04:00.338 --> 00:04:03.160\nI loved it when it was called Skydrive,\nnow it's just called Onedrive I hate it.\n\n93\n00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.180\n>> It's not the same.\n\n94\n00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.907\n>> No it's not, I can't stand it, so\n\n95\n00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:08.487\nI still have to use it I\njust can't stand it anymore.\n\n96\n00:04:08.487 --> 00:04:11.700\nBut, what you see there on the machine and\non the screen, I've zoomed in so\n\n97\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.470\nyou can see it.\n\n98\n00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.770\nIs we have tiles that are created and\nthe tile that is of interest to us\n\n99\n00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.840\nis the one directly across to the right\nfrom Administrative Tools at the top\n\n100\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.450\nof the two columns on the right\nhand side of the screen.\n\n101\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.338\nConfiguration Manager Console, that's the\none that you're gonna want to click on.\n\n102\n00:04:27.338 --> 00:04:31.091\nThe one that is green off to the right,\ndiagonally down in the middle there,\n\n103\n00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.920\nSQL Server Management Studio I use when\nI showed you the SQL Server Database.\n\n104\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.930\nSo we can click on this tile, and what I\nlike to do, is I like to take my tiles,\n\n105\n00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.675\nand I like to hide them, so\nnobody knows where they are.\n\n106\n00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:42.350\n[LAUGH] So\nthat way nobody that can use on,\n\n107\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.110\nif they can get to them on the machine but\nme.\n\n108\n00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.845\n>> It's a security feature.\n\n109\n00:04:44.845 --> 00:04:46.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's the end of the day people,\n\n110\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.450\nI'm just joking around, yeah,\nit's a security feature.\n\n111\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.350\nSo what I actually like to do though,\nall kidding aside,\n\n112\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.870\nif you've never used this\nenvironment before is the following.\n\n113\n00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.320\nI like to go in, I like to pin them to\nthe task bar so I know where they are and\n\n114\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.120\nI can get to them on the desktop.\n\n115\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.690\nCuz I don't want to keep coming out to\nthis area to have to launch things and\n\n116\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.680\nif my Right-click option.\n\n117\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.680\nFor instance, hypothetically, not that it\never happens, but if it were to happen\n\n118\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.715\nthat it stopped working, how strange\nwould that be, you can't right click.\n\n119\n00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:11.914\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> How do I come up with this stuff?\n\n120\n00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:13.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's just crazy,\n\n121\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.750\nwho can imagine a world where\nyou couldn't right click?\n\n122\n00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.520\nI can and I'll tell you why at some\npoint in the future, but not right now.\n\n123\n00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.710\nSo if you were not able to right click,\nhypothetically for\n\n124\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.040\ninstance, cuz that never\nreally does happen to you.\n\n125\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.155\nYou would want to be able to get to it and\ninstead of having to come in here.\n\n126\n00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:29.795\nAnd you could by the way come in here and\n\n127\n00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:32.535\nyou could start typing configuration\nmanager and the search feature will\n\n128\n00:05:32.535 --> 00:05:35.356\nfind it for you but again you'd have to\nbe able to use your keyboard and type.\n\n129\n00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:37.145\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not that that would ever stop\n\n130\n00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:40.725\nworking either, but if both things\nstopped working hypothetically\n\n131\n00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:42.535\nthen you'd want to be able\nto have access to this.\n\n132\n00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:46.545\nSo im going to go ahead and im going to\npin this to my task bar and by doing that.\n\n133\n00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.260\nWhat I've effectively allowed to happen\nas I go back to my desktop tile is,\n\n134\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.340\nI now have access to it on my taskbar.\n\n135\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.100\nAnd I can see it down here and\nI can interact with it,\n\n136\n00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.500\ndo whatever I want with it,\nand/or create shortcuts etc.\n\n137\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.980\nSo, I've gone ahead and\nI've found the console.\n\n138\n00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.470\nThat's the first thing I've got to do.\n\n139\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.660\nNow I can open the console and I've done\nthat and you've saw the console was open.\n\n140\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.920\nWhat if I wanted go check and\nsee whether the install was successful.\n\n141\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.980\n>> But I don't wanna launch the console\nto do so cuz I have console phobia.\n\n142\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.210\nThis is a recognized issue by\nthe way among IT professionals\n\n143\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.345\nin our community today.\n\n144\n00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:20.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Fear of consoles is a well established\n\n145\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.960\nand well known issue,\nfor IT professionals.\n\n146\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.870\nSo if that is the case,\nwhat are going to do?\n\n147\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.960\nWell, you could go and you could\nlook at the install directories and\n\n148\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.280\ncheck out some of the log files.\n\n149\n00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.460\nWe have a plethora, yet\nanother word, a plethora or\n\n150\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.830\na cornucopia of log files\nthat we may want to examine.\n\n151\n00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.900\nSo let's just take a look at where\nwe are and see how to find them.\n\n152\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.630\nI am in this PC, not your PC,\nnot that PC but this PC.\n\n153\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.130\n>> This one?\n>> Yes.\n\n154\n00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.710\n>> I'm in this PC, on the local drive,\n\n155\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.980\non C drive, I'm in my program files,\nMicrosoft Configuration Manager directory.\n\n156\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.330\nIn my subdirectory,\nwhich I'm about to go into in a minute,\n\n157\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.580\nyou will see there is a logs file.\n\n158\n00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.090\nRoughly about 3/4 of the way\ndown the list right there.\n\n159\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.620\nI'm gonna go in there and\nwhen I go into logs\n\n160\n00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.300\nI will see that there are just\na whole bunch of log files.\n\n161\n00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.230\nWe can see that there are as\nI click to open it up there.\n\n162\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.765\nWe have a whole bunch of them, how many,\nyou ask, it's good that you asked.\n\n163\n00:07:16.765 --> 00:07:19.892\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's see how many we actually have, so\n\n164\n00:07:19.892 --> 00:07:27.330\nif we do that hopefully and\nscroll down there.\n\n165\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.210\nWe have 73 log files,\n\n166\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.680\nhow do I know that magical information\nthat appears out of no where?\n\n167\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.270\nBecause I can highlight everything and\nlook by my screens and\n\n168\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.610\nsee I have 73 log items.\n\n169\n00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.790\nSo I have all those log files,\nnow the interesting thing,\n\n170\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.440\nno I do not want to do that,\nthank you very much.\n\n171\n00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.820\n>> Now all these were created during\nthe install process cuz we really haven't\n\n172\n00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.440\nused anything yet.\n\n173\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.170\n>> Correct, these were all,\nwell this one is up and running.\n\n174\n00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.307\n>> Okay.\n>> We've had it up and running for\n\n175\n00:07:52.307 --> 00:07:54.051\na little bit,\nwe switched to a different machine.\n\n176\n00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.423\nSo yes, hypothetically almost all of\nthese were created during install,\n\n177\n00:07:57.423 --> 00:07:58.180\nnot all of them.\n\n178\n00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.592\nA fair number of them I should say were\nactually created post-install because we\n\n179\n00:08:01.592 --> 00:08:02.552\nstarted to do things.\n\n180\n00:08:02.552 --> 00:08:06.089\nThere may be placeholders to these logs\nthat may show a very small value because\n\n181\n00:08:06.089 --> 00:08:08.435\nwe've done install, but\nthere's not much data.\n\n182\n00:08:08.435 --> 00:08:08.970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n183\n00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.640\nit's not fair to say all of these will\nbe there post-install immediately.\n\n184\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.570\nBut almost all of them will, but you're\ngonna definitely have multiple log files,\n\n185\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.170\nlet's put it that way.\n\n186\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.190\nBut what I did want to show you,\nspeaking of logs is,\n\n187\n00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.680\nlogs are important, but if we can't\nread them and see what's inside of them,\n\n188\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.290\nthey don't really do us a lot of good.\n\n189\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.950\nSo, regardless of what log file\nwe may want to choose, and\n\n190\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.800\nwe obviously can choose a variety of them,\nwhichever one it may be,\n\n191\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.030\nI'm gonna choose the log file that is\nrelatively small just because I'm gonna\n\n192\n00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.680\nopen it initially just by\ndouble-clicking on it.\n\n193\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.030\nI'm just gonna show you, not that I really\ncare about the ADService log per se, but\n\n194\n00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.930\nthe fact that it's only 30 kilobytes\nmeans that I could open it\n\n195\n00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:48.810\nby double-clicking on it.\n\n196\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.260\nAnd when I do that,\nit will open in Notepad,\n\n197\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.040\nbecause Notepad is the associated\ntool that opens up a text file,\n\n198\n00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.660\nwhich is what log files really\nare in Windows inside the server.\n\n199\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:04.230\nAnd it will pop up and\nit will, open I say.\n\n200\n00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.660\nIt will do that inside Notepad\nthere in just a moment.\n\n201\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.640\nNow while opening in Notepad may be\nvaluable and certainly may be helpful,\n\n202\n00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:17.630\nreality is while Notepad is\nan incredibly important tool,\n\n203\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.660\nthe reality of our situation is that\nNotepad is a tool that is going to\n\n204\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.565\npotentially cause us some concern, because\nit doesn't really have a lot of features\n\n205\n00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:29.415\nthat we can use to read log files and\nparse them.\n\n206\n00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:32.885\nAnd so what we're really gonna wanna do\ninstead, is we're gonna wanna go in and\n\n207\n00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:35.915\nuse a tool that's associated\nwith Config Manager.\n\n208\n00:09:35.915 --> 00:09:40.507\nThat's gonna allow us to be able to open\nthose log files, but open them with a tool\n\n209\n00:09:40.507 --> 00:09:45.037\nthat's gonna allow us to search them,\nto highlight errors using color coding,\n\n210\n00:09:45.037 --> 00:09:49.707\nto be able to do text-based search\nstrings and finds, and things like that.\n\n211\n00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:52.508\nSo we're gonna go back into\nour installation directory.\n\n212\n00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:56.348\nAnd instead of going to the log file,\nexcuse me the logs directory,\n\n213\n00:09:56.348 --> 00:09:58.738\ncuz, I sound like Kermit\nthe frog there for a second,\n\n214\n00:09:58.738 --> 00:10:02.018\nwhat we're gonna do instead is\ngo into the tools directory.\n\n215\n00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.108\nRight down there at the bottom.\n\n216\n00:10:03.108 --> 00:10:11.764\nAnd the tools directory is going to\nallow us to be able to get to a tool.\n\n217\n00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.960\nYou can see it right there.\n\n218\n00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.884\nCalled cmtrace, config manager trace tool,\nwhich is the log reader of choice.\n\n219\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.870\nFor us to use.\n\n220\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.745\nDo not scoff and laugh at my pain.\n\n221\n00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:29.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n222\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.300\nso, do you want to make this\nprogram the default viewer for\n\n223\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.840\nlog files is what this little prompt says.\n\n224\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.700\nAnd while you can make the log trace tool\nthe default viewer, what will happen if\n\n225\n00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.690\nyou do that is that all log files on the\nsystem are gonna be opened with this tool.\n\n226\n00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.310\nNow that's not a big deal because this is\nactually a really powerful and really cool\n\n227\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.250\ntool, but if you don't want all the log\nfiles to be associated, then just say no.\n\n228\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.240\nAnd it'll simply open up and\nyou can use it, but\n\n229\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.050\nyou're not gonna get every log file In the\nsystem all the IS logs and all that stuff.\n\n230\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.612\nYou're not gonna have to worry about\nall that so just make that choice.\n\n231\n00:11:00.612 --> 00:11:01.298\nI'm gonna say no for now.\n\n232\n00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:02.170\nI'm just gonna go to open.\n\n233\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.910\nThe nice thing about it is this tool knows\nwhere all the logs are already set up it\n\n234\n00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.860\ngoes right to the directory, don't\nhave to tell it, knows how to find it.\n\n235\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.264\nYou can see the ADService log and\nall the other logs are right there and so\n\n236\n00:11:13.264 --> 00:11:14.190\nI can open them up.\n\n237\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.060\nI'm gonna open up the CCM\nlog in this case.\n\n238\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.260\nAnd let it parse the log,\nbecause it's a really big log.\n\n239\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.160\nIt's about half a meg.\n\n240\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.290\nAnd in Notepad, that would take\na long time and may choke on it, but\n\n241\n00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.660\nin the CCM tool comes up with no trouble.\n\n242\n00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.340\nAnd what we then can\nsee is we can go in and\n\n243\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.210\nyou can see the Config Manager log trace\ntool, it's got the path on the top there.\n\n244\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:36.040\nShows us information, shows us what's\ngoing on in this particular case with\n\n245\n00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.700\nthe Config Manager Manager or\nthe Configuration Client Manager.\n\n246\n00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.720\nAnd it goes in and\nit shows us the timestamp.\n\n247\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.880\nDoes all this stuff and shows us all\nthe things that we need to know and\n\n248\n00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.040\nto understand.\n\n249\n00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.650\nKinda cool when you look at the date and\ntime on that, isn't it?\n\n250\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.350\nMay 1, 2016.\n>> Woo hoo.\n\n251\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.025\n>> We're time traveling, that is so cool.\n\n252\n00:11:55.025 --> 00:11:57.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's actually January 5, 2016.\n\n253\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.980\nIt's inverted just based on how the\nlogging is done and I call that out for\n\n254\n00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.695\na specific reason, because it logs by\ndefault as instead of what we're used to.\n\n255\n00:12:06.695 --> 00:12:07.530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n256\n00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.300\n>> Most of us anyway, depending on where\nwe come from, as day and then month,\n\n257\n00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.030\nwhich is how in North America,\nspecifically in the United States,\n\n258\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.030\nwe're used to seeing it unless\nwe have a European background.\n\n259\n00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.890\nWhat it is logging as there\nis actually the day and\n\n260\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.620\nthen the month, as opposed to month, and\nI said day to month first, I apologize.\n\n261\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.220\nMonth and then day, which is the normal\nformat we're used to seeing it in.\n\n262\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.160\nIt's actually doing day and then month.\n\n263\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.570\nSo, it is January 5, 2016, but\n\n264\n00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.580\nit's showing up as if you're not paying\nattention or not really thinking about it.\n\n265\n00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.715\nIt looks like it could be May 1st.\n\n266\n00:12:35.715 --> 00:12:36.310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n267\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.495\n>> And you just wanna note that or\nit could drive you a little batty.\n\n268\n00:12:38.495 --> 00:12:39.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Trying to figure out what the heck\n\n269\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.550\nhappened to your logs and\nwhy you're five months or\n\n270\n00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.850\nsix months in the future from\nwhere you think you should be.\n\n271\n00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.010\nSo just be aware of that,\n\n272\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.400\nbecause that is a little crazy\nbehavior you may not be expecting.\n\n273\n00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.110\nSo we go and we can check the log files.\n\n274\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.170\nAnd obviously looking at your log files is\ngonna be very important for us as well.\n\n275\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:57.800\nIn addition to checking the log files and\nin addition to using the CCM trace tool,\n\n276\n00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.945\nwhat we can also do is we can go in and\n\n277\n00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:06.640\nwe can go into the console.\n\n278\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.760\nLet me just get back to the desktop\nhere and go to our console.\n\n279\n00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.520\nAnd when we do that,\njust open up the console,\n\n280\n00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.750\nit will take just\na second to come back up.\n\n281\n00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.318\nWhat we're gonna be able to do.\n\n282\n00:13:21.318 --> 00:13:23.950\nIs we're gonna be able to use some\nof the built-in monitoring tools and\n\n283\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.960\ncapabilities in the console to\ncheck on the installation status.\n\n284\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.000\nSo we're gonna wanna take\na look at that as well.\n\n285\n00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.654\nSo if we go into Monitoring here.\n\n286\n00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.860\nLet's give that a second to\ncatch with us on the workspace.\n\n287\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.890\nI'm gonna zoom in so you can see that,\nbut I just want to show you.\n\n288\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.110\nBefore we get there,\nI'm just gonna set it up so we can see it.\n\n289\n00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.610\nI'm just gonna open up the system\nstatus area so we can see\n\n290\n00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.200\nsome of the status items, and I'm just\ngonna pull this down just a little bit so\n\n291\n00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.530\nwe can see what's going on in there.\n\n292\n00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.740\nI'm gonna highlight site status so\nthat we can get that to come up for us and\n\n293\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.450\nI'm gonna zoom in so you could see that.\n\n294\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.090\nWe're up in the,\nas you can see down here at the bottom,\n\n295\n00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.720\nthe monitoring work space, we're in\nthe system status, site status area, and\n\n296\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.150\nas we scroll over we can see that all of\nthe site databases, the site server roles,\n\n297\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.120\nall the things that have to be\nup close to install are running.\n\n298\n00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.690\nGreen circle, white check means good.\n\n299\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.940\nEverything is good.\n\n300\n00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.490\nStatus OK, so that's gonna be important.\n\n301\n00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.830\nWe also can go in,\nwe can drill into component status,\n\n302\n00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.920\nthe item right below, and\ntake a look at component status.\n\n303\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.460\nAnd we can, as we see here, drill in and\n\n304\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.880\nwe can see all the different\ncomponent items running.\n\n305\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.460\nWe can see they are online and available.\n\n306\n00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.470\nAgain, green circle,\nwhite check means good.\n\n307\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.870\nSo we're gonna be able to drill in and\nsee those.\n\n308\n00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:45.950\nWe can actually go into any one of\nthese items and we can right-click and\n\n309\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.700\nwe can, and I'll pull this up so\nyou can see it, we can show messages.\n\n310\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.000\nI right-clicked on the SMS_RULE_ENGINE.\n\n311\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.850\nRight-click shows show messages.\n\n312\n00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.040\nI'm just highlighting the fact we have\nall error warning and information.\n\n313\n00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.075\nVery similar to what we\nwould see in the event log.\n\n314\n00:14:59.075 --> 00:15:01.020\nIn event viewer or on any machine.\n\n315\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.620\nWe can go in and\n\n316\n00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.860\nlook at these status messages and\nsee what's going on in any one of these.\n\n317\n00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.780\nNow obviously, if everything is okay\nthere's probably not a lot for us to take\n\n318\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.030\na look at, but if there's issues and\nconcerns we may want to drill in.\n\n319\n00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.060\nSo let's just take a look and\n\n320\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.300\nsee if we have any items that\nare not going to be okay.\n\n321\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.910\nWe'll just do a sort real quick and see\nif we have any that may have a warning or\n\n322\n00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.990\nanything associated with them.\n\n323\n00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.500\nDon't believe we do, but if we do have\nany issues then we would know that or\n\n324\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.440\nsee that.\n\n325\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.800\nWe'd be able to move up to the top or\n\n326\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.600\nthe bottom of the console\nto be able to tell that.\n\n327\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.570\nAnd we do have a couple of warning items.\n\n328\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.280\nThose were, oop, there we go.\n\n329\n00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.060\nLet's see, let's stabilize that,\nget back to where they were.\n\n330\n00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.180\nMight have gone down to the bottom.\n\n331\n00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.720\nNow, there they are right about there.\n\n332\n00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.472\nLooks like we passed them yet again.\n\n333\n00:15:45.472 --> 00:15:46.697\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Try to get them back up\n\n334\n00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:47.350\nin the middle there.\n\n335\n00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:51.150\nJust give me a second and we'll navigate\nthe console, there's a small lag or\n\n336\n00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.095\ndelay as I scroll.\n\n337\n00:15:52.095 --> 00:15:53.310\nSo as I scroll it doesn't.\n\n338\n00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.821\nMove right away and then when it\ndoes it goes all the way past,\n\n339\n00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:56.766\nall right there we go.\n\n340\n00:15:56.766 --> 00:15:58.378\nSo, we got one of them there,\n\n341\n00:15:58.378 --> 00:16:01.870\nso it looks like the hierarchy\nmanager is set in a warning state.\n\n342\n00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.510\nSo, we'll right click on that one.\n\n343\n00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.331\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead an show\nthat to you by zooming in in a second.\n\n344\n00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:10.039\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\npull up the messages there.\n\n345\n00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:12.023\nAnd so what you'll see is I can scroll in,\n\n346\n00:16:12.023 --> 00:16:14.247\nyou'll see we have\na warning status on those.\n\n347\n00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:17.575\nSo, I am going to click all I am going to\nwant to see what those messages are just\n\n348\n00:16:17.575 --> 00:16:20.413\nto check and see if there is anything\nI have to be concerned about.\n\n349\n00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:23.988\nAnd what we get there is we get\na daytime range picker we can go in and\n\n350\n00:16:23.988 --> 00:16:27.043\nspecify a date and a time or\nsay hey just go back one day and\n\n351\n00:16:27.043 --> 00:16:31.081\nshow me all the data or you know I want\nto see the last two hours or whatever.\n\n352\n00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:35.624\nSo, our default is one day and\nwe'll just go ahead and we'll do that,\n\n353\n00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:40.414\nwe'll click OK, and then we'll be able\nto get our reading on our status.\n\n354\n00:16:40.414 --> 00:16:44.915\nSo we can see that there was one milestone\nissue that has a red circle with\n\n355\n00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:45.600\na white X.\n\n356\n00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.140\nThat is an error,\nthe restore informational\n\n357\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.190\nlooks like configuration manager\ncould not locate something\n\n358\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.970\non that second item up from the bottom\nright after the start of the component.\n\n359\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.340\nAnd we also have a message ID 4909.\n\n360\n00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.070\nNow, that is sometimes\nnormal right after startup.\n\n361\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:01.910\nStartup happens,\n\n362\n00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.980\nlot of things are going on simultaneously,\nespecially after install the first time.\n\n363\n00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.360\nSo, some services or [INAUDIBLE] may not\nhave fired off in the right order or\n\n364\n00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.664\nmay have been lagging\na little bit due to start up.\n\n365\n00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:13.690\nAnd as a result of that\nwe may get an error.\n\n366\n00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.760\nIf it happens once in\neverything clear itself up.\n\n367\n00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.956\nNo big deal.\n\n368\n00:17:16.956 --> 00:17:20.420\nIt happens repeatedly and systems running\nwas still see that then that's when you\n\n369\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.576\nknow maybe something we have to go in and\ndrill in and\n\n370\n00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:23.997\nwe'll do little diagnostic on.\n\n371\n00:17:23.997 --> 00:17:28.207\nBut one error over a couple hours of\noperation doesn't occur more than once,\n\n372\n00:17:28.207 --> 00:17:31.850\nprobably not even worth our time and\ntrouble to really examine it.\n\n373\n00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.260\nBut we are gonna take a look just so\nwe could see what's in there.\n\n374\n00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.210\nAnd so if we highlight that and we wanna\ntake a look, I'm just gonna highlight it\n\n375\n00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.350\nand double-click just to bring it up so\nyou could see what it looks like.\n\n376\n00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.200\nWe could see the status message in there,\ntells us the day and\n\n377\n00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.950\ntime, tells us what the error code is,\n\n378\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:52.860\nit gives a description cannot locate the\nactive systems management container in AD.\n\n379\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.610\nNow, we know it isn't there, right?\n\n380\n00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.831\nSo, we know that's not an issue.\n\n381\n00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:59.996\nBut we know that there may have been\na problem, because maybe it was trying to\n\n382\n00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:03.332\nget to it and maybe the main\ncontroller had not up right away.\n\n383\n00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:04.831\nMaybe the directory service was down.\n\n384\n00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:08.090\nThere could be a million reasons\nwhy it doesn't see that, right?\n\n385\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.030\nSo, we just know that that's there and\nobviously just be aware of that.\n\n386\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.310\nBut not a big deal and it says even\nthough the container's not there\n\n387\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.040\nyou may want to add one to make\nintegration a little bit easier, but\n\n388\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.070\nit goes about and\ndoes its stuff knowing that we added one.\n\n389\n00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.340\nWe know it is there right?\n\n390\n00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.360\nSo, we can go in and\nlook at the status there.\n\n391\n00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.544\nWe can go in and use the status messages\nto effectively diagnose and troubleshoot,\n\n392\n00:18:27.544 --> 00:18:28.872\nand see what's going on.\n\n393\n00:18:28.872 --> 00:18:34.190\nNow, another valuable tool that we can use\nin that regard as well, is PowerShell.\n\n394\n00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.200\nSo, I wanna go in and just show you\na couple of things in PowerShell.\n\n395\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.350\nWe talked a little bit about\nPowerShell earlier in one of our,\n\n396\n00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.820\nI think the introductory episode\nwhere we went through and\n\n397\n00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.710\nwe did the walk through the console.\n\n398\n00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.081\nAnd I showed you a couple\nof things about it.\n\n399\n00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:49.936\nOne of the things that we can do in\nPowerShell is click to make sure we have\n\n400\n00:18:49.936 --> 00:18:51.195\nfocus in the console.\n\n401\n00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:53.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One of the things we can do in\n\n402\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:58.290\nPowerShell\n>> Is we can, come on.\n\n403\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.246\nOr not.\n\n404\n00:19:00.246 --> 00:19:00.997\n>> It's thinking about it.\n\n405\n00:19:00.997 --> 00:19:02.831\n>> No, I think it just locked up.\n\n406\n00:19:02.831 --> 00:19:07.517\nIs we can go ahead and we can relaunch it,\nso let's do that real quickly [LAUGH],\n\n407\n00:19:07.517 --> 00:19:09.940\ncuz it is not paying attention to me.\n\n408\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.479\nSo, let me show you how to launch\nwhich is actually not a bad thing.\n\n409\n00:19:12.479 --> 00:19:14.050\nWe'll just restart it, no big deal.\n\n410\n00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.289\nSo, what we do is we come in and\nI'm gonna zero in on this.\n\n411\n00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:19.915\nI'm gonna click and\nthen I'm gonna zoom in so you can see it.\n\n412\n00:19:19.915 --> 00:19:24.422\nWe actually go to this little tab right\nthere at the right top left hand corner of\n\n413\n00:19:24.422 --> 00:19:28.270\nthe menu, or the top left hand\ncorner of the ribbon, I should say.\n\n414\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.310\nAnd the second item down is\nconnect via Windows PowerShell.\n\n415\n00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.456\nNow, when we do that.\n\n416\n00:19:33.456 --> 00:19:37.146\nWe are loading PowerShell with all the\nconfiguration manager commandlets already\n\n417\n00:19:37.146 --> 00:19:38.998\nin place, we don't have to import them.\n\n418\n00:19:38.998 --> 00:19:40.956\n>> Cuz if we had opened\nit from our task bar-\n\n419\n00:19:40.956 --> 00:19:42.049\n>> We would have to go in and\n\n420\n00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:45.772\nimport them using that string that I gave\nyou when we were doing the walk through in\n\n421\n00:19:45.772 --> 00:19:47.664\nour last lab, right, in our last demo.\n\n422\n00:19:47.664 --> 00:19:50.729\nSo, we're gonna be able to go in and\npull this up, and\n\n423\n00:19:50.729 --> 00:19:54.980\nthen what we're gonna be able\nto do is go in and start typing.\n\n424\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:02.456\nSo, that does not look, no,\nthat is, giving us an error.\n\n425\n00:20:02.456 --> 00:20:06.860\nWell not an error but the funky, you can\nsee it's giving me the little umlauts or\n\n426\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.310\nwhatever you call those\nthings when I type.\n\n427\n00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.020\nAll right, so\n\n428\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.230\nwhat I was gonna do is just demonstrate\na couple commands for you, no big deal.\n\n429\n00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.720\nWe're gonna do this another way,\n\n430\n00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.810\ncuz there's more than one way to skin\na cat proverbially, as they say.\n\n431\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.710\nSo, bear with me here half a second.\n\n432\n00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.206\nAnd what we're gonna do\ninstead is the following.\n\n433\n00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:28.455\nJust gonna go here, go here, go here.\n\n434\n00:20:28.455 --> 00:20:31.247\nType in Notepad so we can get to Notepad.\n\n435\n00:20:31.247 --> 00:20:33.790\nAnd then we're just gonna\nopen up Notepad real quick.\n\n436\n00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.880\nAll right, and\nwe're going to use Notepad as our editor.\n\n437\n00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.570\nAnd customize.\n\n438\n00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.872\nNow, what's going on?\n\n439\n00:20:43.706 --> 00:20:46.780\nWhat I want to do is, not that.\n\n440\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.872\nAll right, let's do the following,\none second, no problem.\n\n441\n00:20:49.872 --> 00:20:53.457\nLet's switch to a machine that actually\nfeels like it wants to [LAUGH] be\n\n442\n00:20:53.457 --> 00:20:54.210\nresponsive.\n\n443\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.610\nSo, we're just gonna to\ngo to another machine.\n\n444\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.350\nIt doesn't matter what\nmachine we're on actually.\n\n445\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.971\nIt's really kind of irrelevant.\n\n446\n00:20:58.971 --> 00:21:01.580\nAll we wanna do is just be\nable to get to notepad.\n\n447\n00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.290\nAnd so what we're gonna do\nis simply just come in here.\n\n448\n00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.350\nAnd let's say I happen\nto see it right there.\n\n449\n00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.770\nNope, we're just gonna\ndo Notepad right there.\n\n450\n00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.872\nAnd we're just gonna launch Notepad.\n\n451\n00:21:12.872 --> 00:21:15.004\nI'm just gonna type out some commands for\nyou really quick and\n\n452\n00:21:15.004 --> 00:21:16.190\nexplain to you what they do.\n\n453\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.680\nDoesn't have to be in PowerShell.\n\n454\n00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.860\nIt's really not that big of a deal.\n\n455\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.430\nI just want you to see them and\nat least be aware of them.\n\n456\n00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.010\nSo, give me a second here.\n\n457\n00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.720\nI'm gonna narrate as I go.\n\n458\n00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.180\nSo, what I'm doing is typing\nin get command module and\n\n459\n00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.700\nthen configuration manager.\n\n460\n00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.290\nAnd of course I need to spell correctly\nwhich may slow us down just a wee bit.\n\n461\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:42.330\nAnd then I'm gonna pipe that out\nto the out grid view command.\n\n462\n00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.600\nAnd what this does.\n\n463\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.880\nIs allows us, I'm just gonna make\nthe font a little bigger in here so\n\n464\n00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.400\nyou guys can see it when I zoom in.\n\n465\n00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.440\nSo, bear with me here half a second.\n\n466\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.663\nThat way you guys can see that.\n\n467\n00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:04.706\nAll righty, let's make that full screen.\n\n468\n00:22:04.706 --> 00:22:11.108\nAnd what get-command-module\nconfigurationmanager pipe out-gridview\n\n469\n00:22:11.108 --> 00:22:17.414\ndoes, is that lists all the commands\nthat are loaded for us in PowerShell.\n\n470\n00:22:17.414 --> 00:22:20.905\nSo it's gonna list all of the module\ncommands Remember, I said there's 470,\n\n471\n00:22:20.905 --> 00:22:22.460\napproximately, commandments.\n\n472\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.870\nIt's going to list them all for us and\n\n473\n00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.170\nshow us what they are in\na nice pop out window.\n\n474\n00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.130\nBecause what grid view does, is it pops it\nout into a table inside power shell and\n\n475\n00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.920\npops up a separate window for us.\n\n476\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.300\nPops out a little interact\nwindow we can search through and\n\n477\n00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.320\nwe can interact with and\nwe can see stuff in.\n\n478\n00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.386\nAnd then when we're done,\nwe can just go back into power shell,\n\n479\n00:22:38.386 --> 00:22:39.664\nfigure out what command we went to use.\n\n480\n00:22:39.664 --> 00:22:41.218\nSo, that's actually kinda nice.\n\n481\n00:22:41.218 --> 00:22:41.719\n>> Very nice.\n\n482\n00:22:41.719 --> 00:22:45.831\n>> If we wanna see a list of devices,\nwe can do the following in Config Manager.\n\n483\n00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:49.995\nSo if we want to,\nhow do you get number four for that?\n\n484\n00:22:49.995 --> 00:22:51.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Serious?\n\n485\n00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.925\n>> All right,\nthe keyboard is having some issues here.\n\n486\n00:22:55.925 --> 00:22:58.581\n[CROSSTALK] If it really\nis doing the [LAUGH]\n\n487\n00:22:58.581 --> 00:22:59.706\n>> I think, you know what it may be?\n\n488\n00:22:59.706 --> 00:23:03.326\nI think when I do the zoom in and zoom\nout, I'm wondering if that messes, yeah,\n\n489\n00:23:03.326 --> 00:23:05.970\nI think that may mess with I\nthink that may be what it is.\n\n490\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.320\nAll right, so\nwe figured that out, no big deal.\n\n491\n00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.165\nLet me do another one here.\n\n492\n00:23:08.165 --> 00:23:12.533\nGet cm device, if you want to be able to\nget a listing of all configuration manager\n\n493\n00:23:12.533 --> 00:23:14.539\ndevices that are under management.\n\n494\n00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:15.747\nWe could do that from PowerShell.\n\n495\n00:23:15.747 --> 00:23:20.337\nWe could do that obviously inside as well,\nbut if we want to do that and\n\n496\n00:23:20.337 --> 00:23:25.581\nwe pipe that out and we do ft for format\ntable, with a format table name rather.\n\n497\n00:23:25.581 --> 00:23:30.376\nAnd we do comma, and we do adsitename,\nso what we're specifying are the colon,\n\n498\n00:23:30.376 --> 00:23:34.042\nthe colon, the column headers,\nright, so when we format for\n\n499\n00:23:34.042 --> 00:23:37.000\nthe table we actually\nsee this information.\n\n500\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.206\nSo adsitename, sitecode, because we're\nprobably gonna want that, and deviceos.\n\n501\n00:23:46.414 --> 00:23:50.834\nWhat we're gonna get if we do that\nis the ability to be able to,\n\n502\n00:23:50.834 --> 00:23:56.710\nI'll put a list, pipe that list from\nmemory, because we do a get into memory.\n\n503\n00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.330\nGonna pipe that out across the pipe to ft,\nwhich is gonna do a format table for us.\n\n504\n00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.350\nAnd then we're gonna have the column\nheaders for name, adsitename, sitecode,\n\n505\n00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.430\nand deviceos.\n\n506\n00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.188\nSo, that we can see a list\nof those devices and\n\n507\n00:24:06.188 --> 00:24:07.914\nwe have it formatted in\na nice little table.\n\n508\n00:24:07.914 --> 00:24:09.590\nFirst, we're gonna be\nable to do that as well.\n\n509\n00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.640\nWhat if we want a list\nof distribution points?\n\n510\n00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.960\nThat may be an important one.\n\n511\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:19.997\nGet distribution point, so\nwe're gonna do get-cmdistributionpoint.\n\n512\n00:24:19.997 --> 00:24:24.108\nThat is going to give us a list of all\nthe distribution points that we have and\n\n513\n00:24:24.108 --> 00:24:26.930\nwe can work with as well and\nwe can go on and on and on.\n\n514\n00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.950\nIf I want to see a list of\npackages I can do get cm package.\n\n515\n00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:34.000\nIf I want to be able to a list of\nmanagement points get cm management point.\n\n516\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.081\nYou got the idea we can just go\nthrough a whole bunch of these.\n\n517\n00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:38.706\nIf I want to see a list of applications\nwhat do you think it would be?\n\n518\n00:24:38.706 --> 00:24:40.664\n>> I'm gonna say get-cmapplications.\n\n519\n00:24:40.664 --> 00:24:43.560\n>> get-cmapplication, not applications.\n\n520\n00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.150\nApplication, but absolutely correct.\n\n521\n00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.752\nIf I wanna view a list of all sites.\n\n522\n00:24:46.752 --> 00:24:48.456\n>> get-cmsite.\n\n523\n00:24:48.456 --> 00:24:51.775\n>> get-cmsite, don't have to tell him\ntwice about using a plural, right?\n\n524\n00:24:51.775 --> 00:24:52.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How about users?\n\n525\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.997\nGet cm-user, right?\n\n526\n00:24:53.997 --> 00:24:57.120\nCollections, get-cmusercollection for\nuser collections.\n\n527\n00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.075\nDevice collections,\nget-cmdevicecollection.\n\n528\n00:24:59.075 --> 00:24:59.630\nGet-cm.\n\n529\n00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.247\nI keep saying just get cm without\nputting the dash in there.\n\n530\n00:25:02.247 --> 00:25:04.120\nBut these are all commands\nthat are supported.\n\n531\n00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.100\nThis is just a small sampling\nout of the 470 that exist.\n\n532\n00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.925\n>> Fantastic.\n>> But obviously some fairly valuable\n\n533\n00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:12.248\nones and actually be of some importance\nfor us to know and to be aware of, right?\n\n534\n00:25:12.248 --> 00:25:15.287\n>> Yeah, absolutely, cuz these are things\nyou could put into the script, you could\n\n535\n00:25:15.287 --> 00:25:18.371\nsave it, run it whenever you want, very\nquickly and easily get these lists without\n\n536\n00:25:18.371 --> 00:25:21.039\nhaving to open up the console,\ngo through the GUI and that kinda thing.\n\n537\n00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:23.993\n>> Absolutely, so, lots of different\nways for us to check the validity of\n\n538\n00:25:23.993 --> 00:25:27.145\nthe install to make sure things are\nworking, to make sure that everything is\n\n539\n00:25:27.145 --> 00:25:30.294\nthere, and to then be able to through\na little power show into it, to sweeten\n\n540\n00:25:30.294 --> 00:25:33.289\nthe mix a little bit and then to be\nable to then use that to our advantage.\n\n541\n00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:36.803\nAs Mike was saying, maybe automate\nsomething maybe have a script that does\n\n542\n00:25:36.803 --> 00:25:38.830\nthat for us when we log on so\nwe can see that.\n\n543\n00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.039\nLots of different ways to use that.\n\n544\n00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:41.039\n>> Fantastic.\n\n545\n00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:44.558\nAll right, Adam again another great\nepisode we got to look at what happens\n\n546\n00:25:44.558 --> 00:25:48.630\nafter the installation where those log\nfiles reside and how we can view those.\n\n547\n00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.660\nAnd now we just verify\nthat everything's theirs.\n\n548\n00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.789\nAs you said, kick the tires, right?\n\n549\n00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:55.854\nMake sure everything is good,\ntest out some of those features,\n\n550\n00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:57.690\nmake sure everything's ready to go.\n\n551\n00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.570\nAll right, well we appreciate that Adam.\n\n552\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.330\nWe had a great episode.\n\n553\n00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.997\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n554\n00:26:01.997 --> 00:26:05.664\nRemember, if you want to attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n555\n00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:08.498\nshoot us an email here\nat

--> 00:00:17.560\n>> Mm, switching it up, that's awesome.\n\n4\n00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.700\n>> I'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.550\nI'm trying to throw Adam\noff a little bit there.\n\n6\n00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.930\nKeep him on this toes, you know?\n\n7\n00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.070\nToday we're doing our\nSystem Center Configuration Manager and\n\n8\n00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.240\nspecifically we're gonna be looking at\ninstalling or creating a secondary site.\n\n9\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.080\nPrevious episodes we saw how to get\nstarted, we talked about prereqs,\n\n10\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.970\nthings like that.\n\n11\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.660\nWe got the System Center Configuration\nManager primary site created,\n\n12\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.530\nnow we're gonna take a look at\ncreating one of those secondary sites.\n\n13\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.800\nAnd here with me of course is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.730\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n15\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.600\n>> It is going well, I am happy and I am\nexcited, cuz we're gonna learn how to, or\n\n16\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.370\ntake a look at how to install secondary\nsite as Mike was just saying.\n\n17\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.680\nWe've gone through the process\nboth from a talking perspective,\n\n18\n00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.300\ntell you what you need to do,\nmake sure you're aware of the dos and\n\n19\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.050\ndon'ts as well as actually walking\nyou through it in an pretty thorough,\n\n20\n00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.620\nin depth discussion, step by step,\nto show you how to set up a primary site.\n\n21\n00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.370\nWhat we're gonna do now\na little bit shorter,\n\n22\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.220\nnot gonna take as much\ntime to do this one.\n\n23\n00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.048\nWe've preloaded all the prereqs and\n\n24\n00:01:13.048 --> 00:01:17.795\ndone all that stuff that we walked through\nin tedious detail in our last demo.\n\n25\n00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:20.035\nBut in this one we're gonna go ahead and\njust show you,\n\n26\n00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:22.815\npicking up from the point of, hey,\nwe've already installed the prereqs.\n\n27\n00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:26.244\nWe've got the site server that's\ngonna become the secondary site,\n\n28\n00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:28.739\nalready set up in other words,\nbuilt ready to go.\n\n29\n00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:32.442\nGot IS installed and\nconfigured, got bits in there,\n\n30\n00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:35.242\ngot our Windows authentication set up,\n\n31\n00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:40.610\ngot our HTTP An non HTTP Authentication\nconfigured for the .NET framework.\n\n32\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.840\nSo all that's been done cuz we\nalready showed you how to do that.\n\n33\n00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.920\nSo we'll assume you can already\nunderstand that that stuff will happen.\n\n34\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.580\nAnd what we're gonna do is move in and\ngo to the console.\n\n35\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.020\nWe'll do that in just a second.\n\n36\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.890\nAnd we're gonna pick up from\nthat point and say, hey,\n\n37\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.180\nif we want to install a secondary site,\nwhat do we actually do?\n\n38\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.060\nAnd it's good to walk through how to\ndo this because, again, you may never\n\n39\n00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.160\nactually have the opportunity in the real\nworld to set up a secondary site.\n\n40\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.130\nA, you may not need one, and B,\nit may already be done for you.\n\n41\n00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.350\nAnd so we really want to do is take\nadvantage of the opportunities\n\n42\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.630\nwe have in our episodes with you, to show\nyou how all these things are gonna work.\n\n43\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.180\nSo that way, if you ever have a chance to\ndo them you'll feel confident, number one.\n\n44\n00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.017\nAnd number two if you don't,\nyou've seen them,\n\n45\n00:02:19.017 --> 00:02:21.730\nyou've been able to talk through them,\nsee them and interact with them,\n\n46\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.866\nand you have a better\nunderstanding of what's going on.\n\n47\n00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.258\nIt's also gonna help you with the skills\nrequired in this area to prepare for\n\n48\n00:02:27.258 --> 00:02:30.279\nthe exam that you're studying cuz\nyou are going to have to know how to\n\n49\n00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.396\nset up a secondary site.\n\n50\n00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:34.669\nThere may be questions about that, and\nyou're gonna wanna be able to walk through\n\n51\n00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.880\nthat process and\nget it straight in your mind.\n\n52\n00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.397\nSo what we're gonna do is\nswitch over to my machine and\n\n53\n00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:39.520\nwe're going to do a quick demo for you.\n\n54\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.990\nAnd we're going to show you how to walk\nthrough and set up a secondary site.\n\n55\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.060\nSo we're in the console.\n\n56\n00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.620\nI'm going to narrate for you as we go.\n\n57\n00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.450\nWe're in the console.\n\n58\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.270\nSo what I've done,\nI've opened up on my primary server.\n\n59\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.760\nI've opened up my secondary, or\nexcuse me on my primary server opened up\n\n60\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.930\nmy config manager console and\nI've got the sites area highlighted.\n\n61\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.110\nAnd what we're going to do is, I'm going\nto zoom in for you in just a second,\n\n62\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.590\nwe're gonna go into the administration\nworkspace, just setting it up for you, so\n\n63\n00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.556\nyou know where we are.\n\n64\n00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:08.267\nWe're in the administration workspace, and\nthen what we're gonna do from there is\n\n65\n00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:11.150\nwe're gonna go into the site\nconfiguration sites area.\n\n66\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.120\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead,\nhighlight our existing site, and\n\n67\n00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.030\nthank you very much.\n\n68\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.090\nAnd we're now gonna go ahead and\n\n69\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.460\nwe are going to get ready\nto set up a secondary site.\n\n70\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.440\nSo let me show you what\nthat's gonna look like.\n\n71\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.172\nJust to set the stage, here.\n\n72\n00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:26.250\nI'm gonna zoom in so\n\n73\n00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.780\nyou can see all of the goodness\nwe have going on in the console.\n\n74\n00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.440\nAnd I am in, as I showed you or\ntold you, the Administration workspace.\n\n75\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.470\nYou'll see that highlighted\ndown on the bottom.\n\n76\n00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.640\nI'm in the Site Configuration area\nwith the Sites item highlighted.\n\n77\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.610\nAnd off to the right as we highlight that,\n\n78\n00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.590\nwe have our primary site\nselected in the console.\n\n79\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.460\nAnd up above you'll see that we\ncan create a secondary site.\n\n80\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.812\nStraight up there at 12 o'clock,\napproximately,\n\n81\n00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:55.250\nif we kind of move it over to the center\nthere, it'll be roughly 12 o'clock.\n\n82\n00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.040\nAnd we can see that on the ribbon to\nthe right of saved searches we have three\n\n83\n00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.835\nicons that kinda have the asterisk\nassociated with them that look like new\n\n84\n00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:03.870\nsomething.\n\n85\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.510\nOne says Add Site System Roles, we'll\nbe dealing with that in another demo.\n\n86\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.890\nCreate Site System Server, and then to\nthe right of that, Create Secondary Site.\n\n87\n00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.220\nAnd that's where we're gonna go and\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n88\n00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.550\nIf you remember, the ability to be\nable to work with a secondary site\n\n89\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.010\nis predicated upon the idea of having\na primary site already installed.\n\n90\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.980\nAnd so we have to have a primary site set\nup, we do, you can see it in the console.\n\n91\n00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.180\nNow that we have that installed,\nwe have the option of going in and\n\n92\n00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.790\nsetting up a secondary site.\n\n93\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.240\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna highlight that primary site.\n\n94\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.067\nAnd we do already have it highlighted, but\n\n95\n00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:38.100\nwe're just gonna click to make\nsure we have focus in the console.\n\n96\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.369\nAnd as we do that,\nthen we'll be able to go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:44.271\nwe will be able to set\nup our secondary sites.\n\n98\n00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:48.030\nSo we're gonna do that, we're going to\nclick on our Create Secondary Site icon.\n\n99\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.820\nNow, we can do it from the ribbon,\nby the way, or\n\n100\n00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.070\nwe can right click on the primary\nsite that is selected in the window.\n\n101\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.400\nAnd through the right click option off\nour menu we have the same options.\n\n102\n00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.000\nSo there's a couple of ways to do this.\n\n103\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.060\nAnd we can also do this from\nPowerShell by the way as well.\n\n104\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.180\nSo we have at least three ways to do this.\n\n105\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.145\nMike's actually offered to do a demo\nof the PowerShell option for you later.\n\n106\n00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:12.388\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's going to be doing that this\n\n107\n00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:15.816\nevening at 7 PM local Ukrainian time.\n\n108\n00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:20.378\nIf you tune in you will see Mike doing\nthat on the government access channel\n\n109\n00:05:20.378 --> 00:05:21.810\nright after C-SPAN.\n\n110\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.620\n>> There you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.862\n>> So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n112\n00:05:23.862 --> 00:05:25.650\nwe are going to go through the wizard.\n\n113\n00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.530\nI am not gonna zoom in on every screen.\n\n114\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.400\nI'll zoom in on the ones that are\nimportant and show you what we gotta know,\n\n115\n00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.300\nbut some of the introductory screens\nreally nothing going on there.\n\n116\n00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.500\nNot a lot of value in showing you\nthat all we're doing is introducing\n\n117\n00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.950\nthe idea of the secondary site.\n\n118\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.500\nSo on the first Before you begin screen\nwe're just gonna go ahead and click next.\n\n119\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.480\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\n\n120\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.380\nwe are gonna have our Specify settings for\nnew secondary sites screen.\n\n121\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.450\nWe got a couple of red circles with\nexclamation points screaming at us there\n\n122\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.120\nmeaning we need some information.\n\n123\n00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.710\nSo let's go zoom in real quick,\nlet's take a look at what we need.\n\n124\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.480\nWe're gonna need a site code.\n\n125\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.750\nNow the site code, if you remember,\n\n126\n00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.060\nis gonna be the three digit\nalphanumeric value that we've assigned.\n\n127\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.650\nBut it's gonna be the site code\nwe've assigned to the primary site.\n\n128\n00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.000\nBecause, remember, the secondary site is\ngonna become a child of the primary site.\n\n129\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.120\nDoesn't have its own site code,\n\n130\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.600\nin other words, it will piggyback off the\nprimary site's, parent's site IE, right?\n\n131\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.100\nSite code, so we have to know\nwhat that is ahead of time or\n\n132\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.040\nwe're gonna wind up going\noff into space somewhere.\n\n133\n00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.530\n>> So this is really what's\nassociating it with the primary.\n\n134\n00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.905\nIf you had more than one primary site,\nthis is where you're telling it you're\n\n135\n00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:31.600\ngonna be a child of this\nparticular primary site.\n\n136\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.430\n>> Correct, so if we had, and Mike raises\nan excellent point because in a multi site\n\n137\n00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.390\nhierarchy, right, with a central admin\nserver, we've seen based on the diagrams\n\n138\n00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.780\nthat we looked at that we could indeed\nhave more than one primary site.\n\n139\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.880\nAnd if we do, we obviously are going to\nhave unique site codes for every site.\n\n140\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.330\nSo the child site has to be told\neffectively which site to associate with.\n\n141\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.780\nAnd if we don't know which\nsite we're associating with,\n\n142\n00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.050\nwe could in theory wind up\nassociating with the wrong one.\n\n143\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.010\nWe also have to provide a site server\nname, you'll see that as well.\n\n144\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.552\nThat's gonna work with the site code.\n\n145\n00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:04.130\nThe two have to match up in order to make\nsure that we have the right site code and\n\n146\n00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.310\nthe right server in the site that\nrepresents the site code as the primary\n\n147\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.270\nsite server.\n\n148\n00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.780\nAnd then we have to have the site name.\n\n149\n00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.240\nRemember the site name is\nthe name of the secondary site,\n\n150\n00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.690\nnot the name of the primary site.\n\n151\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.560\nBut this is gonna be the name of\nthe secondary site that we wanna create.\n\n152\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.690\nWe can call it anything we want.\n\n153\n00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.580\nWe're gonna call it Secondary Site.\n\n154\n00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.080\nRemember I like simplicity,\n\n155\n00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.600\nI like straightforwardness\nin our naming conventions.\n\n156\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.830\nI talked to you about the best practice\nI try to implement with my customers.\n\n157\n00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.870\nWhen we do site code naming,\nwe do the first letter of the site name,\n\n158\n00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.930\nthe domain name rather, and\nthen 01, 02, 03 to iterate.\n\n159\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.380\nSo we're gonna follow that\nthought process as well.\n\n160\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.638\nS for secondary site, 01.\n\n161\n00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:47.950\nSo S01 will be our site code for\nour secondary site.\n\n162\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.390\nYou know, 01 for the first secondary site.\n\n163\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.980\nSo that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n164\n00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.420\nAnd then we have our install folders.\n\n165\n00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.101\nYou can see we're gonna leave that at the\ndefault, we're not gonna bother with that.\n\n166\n00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:58.818\nSo let's go and let's just get\nthat programmed in real quick.\n\n167\n00:07:58.818 --> 00:08:02.676\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do S01.\n\n168\n00:08:02.676 --> 00:08:04.831\nSo let me type that in.\n\n169\n00:08:04.831 --> 00:08:08.938\nOr let me get in there and type that in.\n\n170\n00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:14.553\nAnd then.\n\n171\n00:08:14.553 --> 00:08:17.910\nHold on just one second there.\n\n172\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:18.860\nI clicked on the wrong.\n\n173\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.365\nThere we go.\n\n174\n00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:21.050\n[LAUGH] I clicked on the wrong button.\n\n175\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.930\nWound up not only getting out of\nthat screen, but actually wound up\n\n176\n00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.870\ngoing to a little bit of a different place\non the server that we don't need to be.\n\n177\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.740\nSo we're gonna put our site code in F01,\nwe're gonna go ahead in type in our\n\n178\n00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.540\nsite server name, so\nthat's gonna be our PLABSYS03.\n\n179\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.570\nI happen to have bad habit of\ntalking to myself when I type\n\n180\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.670\nbecause I don't know how to type, so it\ntakes my mind off the fact that I'm always\n\n181\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.830\none click away from making mistakes.\n\n182\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.000\nSo why you hear me talking\nto myself while I'm typing,\n\n183\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.130\nthat's because of I didn't do that then\nyou would see nothing on the screen.\n\n184\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.770\nNow we can also browse, we can find\na site survey by using the browse option.\n\n185\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.830\nWe're not going to do that but\nwe could go out in browser we need it too.\n\n186\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.690\nSo just want to make sure we're\naware of that is well and\n\n187\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.390\nthat we know that if we do you\nneed to browse want to go out and\n\n188\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.300\nuse that the pick list is in effect,\nright?\n\n189\n00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.240\nWe can always go out and\nfind a server that way.\n\n190\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.160\nAnd then we're gonna name our sites, we're\ngonna do that, call that secondary site.\n\n191\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.050\nSo we'll put all that in.\n\n192\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.620\nAnd then we're gonna do down below.\n\n193\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.120\nWe're gonna hit next.\n\n194\n00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.540\nGive that just a second.\n\n195\n00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.120\nMoves to our installation\nsource files screen.\n\n196\n00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.170\nOn the installation source files, we have\nthe default set to copy installation\n\n197\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.010\nsource files for the parent sites or\nover the network, meaning we're going to\n\n198\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.530\neffectively grab those over the network\nfrom the share on the primary site server.\n\n199\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.970\nWe're not gonna bother with having to\nchange that because that's gonna work, and\n\n200\n00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.280\nthe default is set that way.\n\n201\n00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.239\nBecause unless you have a reason not to do\nit, there's a share there that we can grab\n\n202\n00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:47.630\nit from, so\nwe're not gonna have to worry about that.\n\n203\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.920\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n204\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.800\nWe're then going to go ahead and\nhave our SQL server settings option.\n\n205\n00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.420\nNow what we're going to get here is\nthe ability to install a copy a local\n\n206\n00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.318\ncopy server express on\nthe secondary site computer.\n\n207\n00:10:01.318 --> 00:10:04.130\nYou know, SQL light as a lot\nof people like to refer to it.\n\n208\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.780\nBut remember we do have a SQL database\non the secondary site servers.\n\n209\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.200\nWe saw that in the graphics that\nMicah put together for us as well.\n\n210\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.280\nTalked about the fact that that data\nbase is going to be sitting there.\n\n211\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.470\nSo we're going to have to\nprovide that data base, and so\n\n212\n00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.730\nwe're going to install it.\n\n213\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.370\nWe just have some standard\nports associated with that.\n\n214\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.140\nWe've got the SQL server\nservice port set at 1433.\n\n215\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.290\nWe've got the SQL server\nbroker port set to 4022.\n\n216\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:32.020\nSo we're going to be able to have all\nthat there, and then we're going to have\n\n217\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.290\nthe ability to use an existing SQL\nserver instance if we choose to.\n\n218\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.110\nThis is the ability to be able to go\nto an existing SQL server somewhere,\n\n219\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.730\nhost it there.\n\n220\n00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.190\nWe did talk about the fact we could\nuse a external database in a cluster,\n\n221\n00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.450\nsomething like that.\n\n222\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.230\nReally up to us.\n\n223\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.430\nFor a secondary site, probably not really\nworth the time and effort to do that.\n\n224\n00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.450\nFor primary sites,\nprobably worth the time and\n\n225\n00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.990\neffort to think about that because of\nthe scalability requirements around\n\n226\n00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.780\ngoing into the thousands,\nthe tens of thousands and you're\n\n227\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.380\nultimately up from 25 to 50 to 100,000\nsince the end points on the site server.\n\n228\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.940\nBut for our purposes,\non a secondary site server,\n\n229\n00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.330\nwhere we can only host a very small by\ncomparison number of hosts, or excuse me,\n\n230\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.180\nnumber of end points, we're not gonna\nbother with that more often than not.\n\n231\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.920\nSo we're gonna use the SQL local install.\n\n232\n00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.780\nSo we're gonna do that,\njust leave the default there.\n\n233\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.690\nWe're then going to go ahead and\nget our distribution point option.\n\n234\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.360\nThe distribution point is important\nbecause what the distribution point allows\n\n235\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.920\nus to do is to effectively create\na cache where we put our applications in\n\n236\n00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.330\nour programs, and\nallows us to then be able to use that\n\n237\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.470\nas a effectively a drive share\nwhere we can stream the content.\n\n238\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.580\nThe packages from locally and we're then\nable to distribute them to the endpoints\n\n239\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.080\nthat require them based\non a deployment scenario.\n\n240\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.540\nBut we'll go in and talk about those\ndeployment scenarios in a future episode.\n\n241\n00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.470\nHow do we create an application,\nhow do we create a package?\n\n242\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.930\nWe talked about the fact that\nthe differentiator there\n\n243\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.110\nis the existence of an MSI\nversus an EXE to drive that.\n\n244\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.400\nSo we'll talk through that,\nwe'll show you how to all that.\n\n245\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.550\nWe'll deploy something for you,\nshow you how to push that out.\n\n246\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.380\nThe idea here is that in order to be able\n\n247\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.060\nto actually set that up we have to have\na distribution point as a site role\n\n248\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.980\nto be able to actually host that\napplication or that package.\n\n249\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.710\nSo we're going to set that\nup on the secondary site.\n\n250\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.115\nNow I did talk about in our\ndiscussions and the last lab or\n\n251\n00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:25.690\nwalk-through demo we did about the fact\nthat a distribution point can be a server,\n\n252\n00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.390\ncan be a site server as a role.\n\n253\n00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.480\nCould actually be a work station.\n\n254\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.700\nCould be a Windows 7, Windows 8 machine,\nas long as it's able to run IS locally.\n\n255\n00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.270\nWindows 7 is able to do that.\n\n256\n00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.260\nWindows 8, 8.1 able to do that.\n\n257\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.920\nWindows 10 able to do that.\n\n258\n00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.440\nSo the reality is we can use those as\ndistribution points, so we don't have to,\n\n259\n00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.300\nfor instance, invest in high-end\nhardware in order to be able to do this.\n\n260\n00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.560\nI have a lot of customers\nthat are setting up,\n\n261\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.300\ndistribution points in remote areas,\ncuz of band width concerns and\n\n262\n00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.460\nare using work stations in remote\noffices to do the distribution points.\n\n263\n00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.560\n>> Nice.\n>> Think about the logic of that.\n\n264\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.180\nMakes a lot of sense.\n\n265\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:58.900\nRight?\n>> They're going to spend\n\n266\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.960\na lot of money on a small location,\nput some expensive hardware out there.\n\n267\n00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.810\nAnd the workstation would\nbe dedicated to that.\n\n268\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.420\nProbably wouldn't be something\nthat somebody sat at or.\n\n269\n00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.210\n>> Could actually be either one.\n\n270\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.850\n>> Really.\n>> It really wouldn't really matter.\n\n271\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.050\nThe key driver, the key differentiator\nthere it's going to give you the ability\n\n272\n00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.308\nto have enough space on the hard drive.\n\n273\n00:13:12.308 --> 00:13:13.700\n>> Right.\n>> To be able to store packages.\n\n274\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.700\nYou know, if you think about what Office\n2013, roughly, if you think about\n\n275\n00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.100\ndoing a full install today, it's probably\nabout a gig and a half to two gigs.\n\n276\n00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.090\nYou think about Office 2016,\nit's close to about three gigs today.\n\n277\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.680\nSo you start stacking up all\nthese programs, not that five or\n\n278\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.560\nten gigs of stuff is a lot,\nbut you want a work station.\n\n279\n00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.200\nAs long as you have enough room,\nyou've got, you know 20, 30, 40,\n\n280\n00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.730\n100 gigs of space allocated to the cache.\n\n281\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:37.400\nThat's all you need.\n\n282\n00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.830\nFrom a performance perspective,\n\n283\n00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.980\nit would obviously be better if we\ndedicated work stations to this.\n\n284\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.160\nWe're doing deployments.\n\n285\n00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.460\nWe're not worried about all\nthe other stuff going on.\n\n286\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.610\nBut a deployment is really nothing more\nthan streaming bits out over the network.\n\n287\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.360\nSo bandwidth, gonna be very important.\n\n288\n00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.330\nThe ability to have\nthe storage is very important.\n\n289\n00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.660\nYou want to optimize the storage.\n\n290\n00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.130\nYou want to have a high speed drive\nspeed drives will be valuable here\n\n291\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.300\nbecause they'll speed\nup access to the data.\n\n292\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.360\nHigh speed network connection so your one\ngig verses ten gig network connection\n\n293\n00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.340\nobviously a differentiator there.\n\n294\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.720\nBut if you're a ten gig coming off\nthe back plan on the machine but\n\n295\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.940\none gig everywhere else realities\nare running one gig, right?\n\n296\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.140\nSo it's just a matter of\nthe weakest link in the chain.\n\n297\n00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.680\nBut if that machine has relatively decent\nresources, no reason to dedicate it.\n\n298\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.635\nYou can do other stuff because if\nyou think about it most of the time\n\n299\n00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:27.190\n90% of the time that workstation is in\noperation it's not doing deployments.\n\n300\n00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.960\nIts effectively sitting doing other stuff.\n\n301\n00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.590\nSo if all you did was sit there and say,\nokay I'm going to dedicate this machine,\n\n302\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.132\nright, like nothing but\ndeployments goes on here.\n\n303\n00:14:35.132 --> 00:14:39.485\nThat's fine but probably 90- 95% of\nthe time machine's going to sit relatively\n\n304\n00:14:39.485 --> 00:14:41.185\nidle not doing all that much.\n\n305\n00:14:41.185 --> 00:14:42.485\n>> Right.\n>> And then when you have a push and\n\n306\n00:14:42.485 --> 00:14:46.475\nyou're pushing out two or three packages\nover a short period of time it's busy.\n\n307\n00:14:46.475 --> 00:14:47.885\nThen it goes back to being idle again.\n\n308\n00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:48.765\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\n309\n00:14:48.765 --> 00:14:50.565\n>> Really just depends\non how you view that.\n\n310\n00:14:50.565 --> 00:14:51.835\nRight in that respect.\n\n311\n00:14:51.835 --> 00:14:53.655\n>> Okay.\n>> But it's good to talk through that.\n\n312\n00:14:53.655 --> 00:14:55.305\nIt's good to understand that and\nhave options.\n\n313\n00:14:55.305 --> 00:14:57.675\nSo we're going to go through and\ndo our distribution point.\n\n314\n00:14:57.675 --> 00:15:01.040\nSo let's just quickly take a look\nwhat we have going on there.\n\n315\n00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.880\nSo we're gonna see in the distribution\npoint area, we have the ability\n\n316\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.900\nto be able to install configure IIS,\nif it's required by the config manager and\n\n317\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.920\nbe able to configure BranchCacheing for\nthis distribution point.\n\n318\n00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.980\nWe can leverage BranchCache\nas well if we would like to.\n\n319\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.990\nSo we could set that up.\n\n320\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.170\nWe have the ability to use HTTP or HTTPS.\n\n321\n00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.440\nSo are we gonna go secure?\n\n322\n00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.980\nAre we gonna go non-secure on the protocol\nand therefore, create a secure connection?\n\n323\n00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.050\nSo that's gonna obviously be\nimportant to think about.\n\n324\n00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.300\nWe do see that we are gonna\nrequire a PKI solution,\n\n325\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.835\na certificate there if\nwe need one using HTTPS.\n\n326\n00:15:34.835 --> 00:15:35.420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n327\n00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.780\n>> So\nwe do wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n328\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.670\nAnd we're thinking about that because\nwe are gonna need a certificate or PKI\n\n329\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:46.150\ninfrastructure and digital certificates,\nto be able to drive that solution, right?\n\n330\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.140\n>> So normal like here we're using\nself-sign which means now we're gonna have\n\n331\n00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:53.825\nto worry about getting that trusted by all\nthe nodes that are pulling data from this\n\n332\n00:15:53.825 --> 00:15:54.335\ndistribution point?\n\n333\n00:15:54.335 --> 00:15:55.976\n>> We would potentially have to do that.\n\n334\n00:15:55.976 --> 00:15:58.656\nAnd/or we could preload\nthose certificates, right?\n\n335\n00:15:58.656 --> 00:16:01.041\nSo we can use or\nleverage the Active Directory,\n\n336\n00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:03.850\nbecause we know [INAUDIBLE]\nMicrosoft infrastructure.\n\n337\n00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.597\nWe can load the certificates through\nthe active directory, and although they're\n\n338\n00:16:07.597 --> 00:16:11.200\nself-signed, have them preloaded in\nthere for pre-trusted as part of that.\n\n339\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.420\nSo that would be one option.\n\n340\n00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.930\nBut, Mike brings up an excellent point,\nwhich is that if we're using,\n\n341\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.150\nlet's say third party certificates,\nbecause we may not just do self-signed\n\n342\n00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.120\ncertificates, we may have\nour own certificates.\n\n343\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.080\nWe may also buy some, although we\nreally don't buy them, we rent them,\n\n344\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.960\nbecause they don't really\nbelong to us long term.\n\n345\n00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.820\nBut we could get certificates from\na third party from RSA, from Verisign,\n\n346\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.960\nfrom whoever.\n\n347\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.220\nWe then would have to worry about\ngetting the certificates trusted,\n\n348\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.520\ndepending on where they're deployed.\n\n349\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.880\nSo if we're giving them to external\ncustomers, we would have to worry about\n\n350\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.970\nthat, because they would not be part of\nthe directory name space traditionally.\n\n351\n00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.490\nBut if we're dealing\nwith internal customers,\n\n352\n00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.310\nwe could either force them to trust,\nbecause we could pre-load that, or\n\n353\n00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.870\nsetup a group policy that\nforces that to occur.\n\n354\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.380\nSo it really does depend on the nature of\nthe architecture and what we're doing.\n\n355\n00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:00.890\nBecause we may have multiple domain\nspaces underneath the same tree.\n\n356\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.080\nWe have multiple domain spaces across\ndifferent trees in the same forest.\n\n357\n00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.930\nWe may have multiple domain name\nspaces in different trees in\n\n358\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.680\ndifferent different forests.\n\n359\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.850\nAnd it depends on where\nthe trust relationships lie,\n\n360\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.820\nbecause in a multilateral relationship\nwhere we have different trees, but\n\n361\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.760\nunderneath the same common forest, we can\nstill kind of push that trust down through\n\n362\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.340\nthe directory architecture, if we\nare dealing with different forests and\n\n363\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.770\ndoing what's called cross-forest\ntrusts because of federation,\n\n364\n00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:30.950\ncuz they may have partnerships, right,\n\n365\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.960\nwith external entities that\npotentially we're gonna be managing.\n\n366\n00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.230\nAnd as a result of that,\nit complicates things a little bit.\n\n367\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.260\nWe can still get that\ntrust relationship set up.\n\n368\n00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.120\nWe can still push certificates across\nthat trust boundary no problem, but\n\n369\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.730\nthe architecture to do that becomes\na little bit more involved.\n\n370\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.500\nSo, it just depends on what\nwe're looking to do, but\n\n371\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.420\nabsolutely we have to be\nthinking about all that.\n\n372\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.680\nWe can create the self sign certificate as\nyou can see, and, or import a certificate.\n\n373\n00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.550\nSo, we could set all those options up and\ndo whatever we want to do.\n\n374\n00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.350\nWe also have the option to allow clients\nto connect anonymously if we choose to.\n\n375\n00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:04.500\nThere's checkbox there, right above\ncreate all self-signed certificates.\n\n376\n00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.740\nSo really, it's just a matter\nof what we choose to engage.\n\n377\n00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.980\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncheck off the install and\n\n378\n00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.740\nconfigure IIS if required, cuz we do\nwanna have that set up on the server.\n\n379\n00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.680\nIt's actually already installed,\nbut we're gonna configure it.\n\n380\n00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.230\nSo that way it's going to be set up\nproperly because we did pre-load,\n\n381\n00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.800\nas I said, IIS and\nget some of that already done.\n\n382\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.320\nA little sneaky attempt on my part to\nsave a few minutes of time in the demo.\n\n383\n00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.000\nSo we're going to go ahead and do that.\n\n384\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.930\nThen we're going to get to drive settings.\n\n385\n00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.670\nOn the drive settings area,\nthis is really just what\n\n386\n00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.650\nare we going to do in terms of the set up\nfor that cache that I was talking about.\n\n387\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.380\nHow big do we wanna make it,\nfor setting up packages?\n\n388\n00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.830\nAnd what kind of information are we\ngonna have in terms of proxy items and\n\n389\n00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.630\nthings like that?\n\n390\n00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.800\nSo primary content library location,\nsecondary content location.\n\n391\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.130\nAll that stuff's gonna be specified.\n\n392\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.890\nWe're gonna leave that on automatic here.\n\n393\n00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.890\nWe're gonna leave the drive\nspace reserved at 50 megs.\n\n394\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:58.820\nThat's the default setting.\n\n395\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.450\nYou would never do that\nout in the real world.\n\n396\n00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.110\nThe real world,\nyou'd have to crank that up.\n\n397\n00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.120\nBut you do wanna know\nthat it's set megabytes.\n\n398\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.200\nCuz a lot of people say,\noh, I want 20 gigs.\n\n399\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.160\nThey'll put 20 there.\n\n400\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.310\nYou got 20 megs, not 20 gigs.\n\n401\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.250\nVMWare does this when they do their, not\nthat we're here to talk about VMware, but\n\n402\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.800\nI will digress, because I can,\nso in VMware for instance,\n\n403\n00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.190\nand this is the crazy thing about vendors.\n\n404\n00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.910\nYou know I'm convinced\nthat vendors don't sit and\n\n405\n00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.850\nactually think through the logic of\nhow users will use their product.\n\n406\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.600\nI'm convinced that they sit in a room, and\nthey say to themselves what's the wackiest\n\n407\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.860\nway we could set this up that would\njust snare the majority of users, so\n\n408\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.622\nwe could see if they're paying attention.\n\n409\n00:19:35.622 --> 00:19:40.230\nSo when VMWare does this on their VM\nsettings, so when you set up the VMWare,\n\n410\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.990\nand you're hosting it, you go to edit\nsettings, just like you would normally,\n\n411\n00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:49.760\nthe time out value on the restart cycle\nfor the VM is set to zero by default,\n\n412\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.862\nso you never get an FA prompt,\nright, to go into safe mode.\n\n413\n00:19:51.862 --> 00:19:53.070\n>> Right.\n>> Which is fine, no big deal,\n\n414\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.050\nyou change that.\n\n415\n00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.300\nBut it's set to zero by default,\nthat I can live with.\n\n416\n00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.520\nWhat I can't understand is why\nyou set that in milliseconds.\n\n417\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.110\nThat value is set in milliseconds.\n\n418\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:05.810\nSo if you want to actually get a 30 second\nwindow, like most normal people do,\n\n419\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.020\nyou've gotta figure out what\n30 seconds is in milliseconds.\n\n420\n00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.180\nYou've also gotta pay attention to the\nconsole, and realize that the value is set\n\n421\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.820\nin milliseconds,\nsometimes you have to program it in.\n\n422\n00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.170\nThat's one of the biggest things I\nget calls on from customers, right?\n\n423\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.450\nIs hey, we're setting this thing up,\nwe put 30 in there, and\n\n424\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.490\nwe still don't get a prompt.\n\n425\n00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.330\nWell, yeah,\nbecause you get 30 milliseconds.\n\n426\n00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:25.950\nYou know, unless you're The Flash.\n\n427\n00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not happening.\n\n428\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.740\nRight?\n\n429\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.330\nI mean who sits around and\nthinks about this stuff, right?\n\n430\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.150\nYou ever watch Pinky and the Brain?\n\n431\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.831\n>> Yes, yes.\n>> All right.\n\n432\n00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:34.745\n[CROSSTALK] We're gonna take over\nthe world today, that's exactly what's,\n\n433\n00:20:34.745 --> 00:20:35.473\nthat's what's happening.\n\n434\n00:20:35.473 --> 00:20:36.245\nI'm convinced.\n\n435\n00:20:36.245 --> 00:20:36.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n436\n00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.150\nanyway, I'm gonna stop ranting and\nraving here,\n\n437\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.840\nwe'll get back to what\nwe're actually here to do.\n\n438\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.640\nSo this is in megabytes, just make sure\nyou understand that we have to obviously\n\n439\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.440\nbe aware of that, and\nmake sure that we're sensitive to that.\n\n440\n00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.780\nYou would set that to\n5,000 if you want 5 gigs,\n\n441\n00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.360\nset it to 50,000 if you want 50 gigs,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n442\n00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.510\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n443\n00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.545\nThat's the extent of my math capabilities,\ntoo, by the way.\n\n444\n00:20:56.545 --> 00:20:58.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I had to study for that all night.\n\n445\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.190\n>> It looks pretty good.\n\n446\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.020\n>> I had to load that up ahead of time,\nhave a big piece of paper right here with\n\n447\n00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.570\nthe number 5,000 on it equals,\nto make sure I didn't screw that one up.\n\n448\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.000\nAll right, so we've got that.\n\n449\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.660\nWe've got content validation.\n\n450\n00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.159\nOn the content validation page,\n\n451\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.520\nwe're gonna be able to specify what\nthe content validation settings are.\n\n452\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.600\nThis checks the integrity of the packages\nat the distribution point at\n\n453\n00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.840\na predetermined schedule, in case they've\nbeen modified, in case they've changed for\n\n454\n00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.790\nany reason, this is important.\n\n455\n00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.410\nWe could validate it on a schedule,\nwe could check off the box and\n\n456\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.240\nspecify what that schedule'll look like.\n\n457\n00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.620\nWe're not gonna bother\nwith that right now.\n\n458\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.160\nJust because we want to set this up.\n\n459\n00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.070\nBut the reality is we could easily go\nin and put a check mark in the box, and\n\n460\n00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.320\nthen set up a schedule with a little\nschedule icon right there, or\n\n461\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.270\na little schedule button we click on,\nand it goes out by default.\n\n462\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:46.300\nThe magic number for SCCM is gonna\nbe seven, in this case, seven days\n\n463\n00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.790\nby default, more often than not, and\nsetup in one week or weekly increments.\n\n464\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.130\nSo every seven days, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll check that if we specify that.\n\n465\n00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.060\nSo we'll just go ahead since we already\ndid that just quickly to tell you\n\n466\n00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.810\nwhat it is.\n\n467\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.090\nWe'll put that in there.\n\n468\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.950\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n469\n00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.310\nWe have our boundary group item.\n\n470\n00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.310\nThe boundary group area is where we're\ngoing to take the boundaries that we've\n\n471\n00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.850\ndiscovered.\n\n472\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.100\nWe're gonna talk about discovery\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n473\n00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.040\nTalk about how we set up the limitations,\nor the boundary areas of our network, so\n\n474\n00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.010\nwe understand where our machines are and\nhow they're managed.\n\n475\n00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.760\nSo, I'm gonna talk about that.\n\n476\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.820\nWe take those boundaries we discover,\nwe put them into a boundary group, so\n\n477\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.640\nwe can effectively manage them and\napply them.\n\n478\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.670\nAnd that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n479\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.250\nWe're gonna add a boundary group in.\n\n480\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.100\nSo we're gonna click add, and\n\n481\n00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.170\nwe have a little add boundary\ngroup pick list that comes up.\n\n482\n00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.520\nWe only have one boundary group\nin here for demo purposes.\n\n483\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.695\nIt's called lab boundary group.\n\n484\n00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:37.680\nSo we're just gonna select that,\nand we're gonna click okay,\n\n485\n00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.130\nand we're just gonna put\nthat on the list there, and\n\n486\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:47.190\nthen once that's in,\nwe are gonna click Next just to finish up,\n\n487\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:52.770\nget a little summary page, and\nthen click Next one more time.\n\n488\n00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.180\nWe're gonna get our progress, so\nit's actually gonna go ahead and\n\n489\n00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.980\nstart working and boom,\nwithin about five seconds.\n\n490\n00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.880\n>> Wow.\n>> It's probably the quickest\n\n491\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.130\nthing we're gonna do in all the demos.\n\n492\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> for the entire\n\n493\n00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.810\nconversation across this entire class.\n\n494\n00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.500\nBut it's gonna be\nthe quickest thing we do.\n\n495\n00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.320\nWe actually are done,\n\n496\n00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.920\nbecause setting up the secondary site\nserver is not real complicated, right?\n\n497\n00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.860\nIt doesn't take very long,\nbecause we're not installing all of\n\n498\n00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.920\nthe guts of the primary\nsite server on this one.\n\n499\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.670\nWe're just basically going ahead and\nconfiguring and saying,\n\n500\n00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.900\nhey, now you're this.\n\n501\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.350\nAll that other stuff, installing SQL,\ngetting the components set up, that takes\n\n502\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.330\nplace on the server locally, and that's\nchugging away behind the scenes right now.\n\n503\n00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.530\nWe don't have to wait for that, that's\njust gonna happen over the next hour or\n\n504\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.830\nso, however long it may take.\n\n505\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.830\nWe're not gonna obviously sit around and\nwait for all that, but you get the idea.\n\n506\n00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.565\nJust configuring it in the console,\ngetting it assigned, if you will, and\n\n507\n00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:42.855\nhaving it come up is\na very simple process.\n\n508\n00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:45.535\nThere is installation\nconfiguration taking place, but\n\n509\n00:23:45.535 --> 00:23:47.215\nthat takes place locally on that machine.\n\n510\n00:23:47.215 --> 00:23:49.005\nAnd we don't have to sit around and\nwait for that.\n\n511\n00:23:49.005 --> 00:23:50.515\nSo, we've got that done, which is nice.\n\n512\n00:23:50.515 --> 00:23:52.535\nWe're gonna click close here.\n\n513\n00:23:52.535 --> 00:23:56.389\nAnd as soon as the wizard screen\ngoes away, I'm gonna zoom in so\n\n514\n00:23:56.389 --> 00:23:58.569\nyou can see this, what we now have,\n\n515\n00:23:58.569 --> 00:24:02.608\nis we now have our secondary server\nsitting there in the console.\n\n516\n00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:06.178\nIt may be a little tough to see, but at\nthe lower Righthand corner of that icon,\n\n517\n00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:08.234\nthe icon looks kinda\nlike a little building,\n\n518\n00:24:08.234 --> 00:24:10.941\nthere's something that's\nsitting there almost as tall,\n\n519\n00:24:10.941 --> 00:24:14.000\nit's a little hourglass that shows\nthat it's in a pending state.\n\n520\n00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.200\nYou can see if you look over to state\non the righthand side, the fourth,\n\n521\n00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.530\nfifth column over, you'll see state\npending under active for the primary.\n\n522\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.880\nYou'll see our site code there and you'll\nalso see the parent site code of PLB,\n\n523\n00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.060\nwhich is referencing\nthe parent site up above.\n\n524\n00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.440\nSo we now have a Secondary Site\nserver that's in a pending status.\n\n525\n00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.290\nIt'll stay that way, as I said,\nfor maybe an hour or so.\n\n526\n00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.770\nReally depends on the network community,\nspeed of local machine that's chugging\n\n527\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.260\nway, but\nit's gonna do that install eventually.\n\n528\n00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.170\nWhen it finishes and everything is good,\nit'll come up and refresh and\n\n529\n00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.770\nit'll say Active and\nthen it's actually ready to go.\n\n530\n00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:46.280\n>> Fantastic.\n\n531\n00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.240\n>> So we got all that.\n\n532\n00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.940\nSo that's how we set\nup the Secondary Site.\n\n533\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:54.554\nNow, once we've done that, the other thing\nthat we wanna be able to just at least\n\n534\n00:24:54.554 --> 00:24:58.672\nquickly take a look at while we're here is\nthe idea of how we're gonna configure file\n\n535\n00:24:58.672 --> 00:25:02.810\nreplication or file replicas and database\nreplicas within the SCCM architecture.\n\n536\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.300\nWe have a secondary site.\n\n537\n00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.020\nWe have the ability to look at file\nreplication and database replication.\n\n538\n00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.920\nThis is gonna be sitting over here under\nhierarchy configuration, same workspace,\n\n539\n00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.400\nin the administration workspace.\n\n540\n00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.990\nBut you'll see right below where our\nExchange server connectors are, right?\n\n541\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:22.540\nSo right above Active Directory Forests\nwe see Database Replication,\n\n542\n00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.580\nwe see File Replication.\n\n543\n00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.450\nSo we're just gonna quickly\ntake a look at those to\n\n544\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:26.915\nunderstand what's happening with that.\n\n545\n00:25:26.915 --> 00:25:29.520\nCuz we need to have a secondary\nsite server in place and\n\n546\n00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.120\na hierarchy where we're gonna\nbe able to have this make sense.\n\n547\n00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.010\nWith a single stand-alone primary site,\n\n548\n00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.270\nas I talked about when we actually did\nthe install, everything's there, right?\n\n549\n00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.440\nSo we want to know about the site data,\nthe global data.\n\n550\n00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.000\nIt's important to differentiate,\nas I said, but, it's not going anywhere.\n\n551\n00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.900\nIt's all in the same machine.\n\n552\n00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.540\nIt's not really being manipulated or\ntransferred.\n\n553\n00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.215\nWe got to worry about\nwhat arrow goes where.\n\n554\n00:25:48.215 --> 00:25:49.720\nIt's all in the same place.\n\n555\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.230\nWhen we set up a hierarchy we now suddenly\nhave to worry about moving stuff back and\n\n556\n00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.920\nforth in which direction and\n\n557\n00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.310\nwith what mechanisms, and\nthat's where this stuff becomes important.\n\n558\n00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.560\nSo where just going to quickly\ntake a look since we're here.\n\n559\n00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.650\nWe're just going to go\ninto File Replication,\n\n560\n00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.999\nso let's just go do that we'll\nhighlight that real quick.\n\n561\n00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.400\nAnd under File Replication, zoom in so\nyou can see what we selected there.\n\n562\n00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.420\nWhat you'll see is we now have our primary\nsite and our, excuse me, rather our\n\n563\n00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.850\nsite name for PLAB or site code PLB our\nsecondary site is the destination site.\n\n564\n00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.850\nIn other words the primary site's\ngonna replicate to the secondary site.\n\n565\n00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.360\nThat's what the first line says.\n\n566\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.950\nAnd then the secondary site,\nsite code SO1,\n\n567\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.990\ndestination site named PLAB, destination\nsite code PLB, second line is hey,\n\n568\n00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.010\nlet's replicate from Secondary to Primary.\n\n569\n00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.590\nSo we're setting up the unit\ndirectional communication in each\n\n570\n00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.130\ndirection in order to put bidirectional\ncommunication back and forth.\n\n571\n00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.680\nSo we've got two in effect\nreplication connectors,\n\n572\n00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.710\nif you wanna think of it this way,\nor paths.\n\n573\n00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.690\nAnd this is like when you\nget into Exchange, and\n\n574\n00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.610\nlook at the old Exchange architecture\nwhere you've got the site connectors.\n\n575\n00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.850\nYou gotta figure out which direction\nyou're going and how to replicate data.\n\n576\n00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.680\nSame concept, the active director\nimplication, apology right?\n\n577\n00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.570\n>> That's what I was thinking.\n\n578\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.060\n>> The same kinda thing\nwith side connects.\n\n579\n00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.080\nSame exact thing except putting\nthe word SECM in front of it, right?\n\n580\n00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.100\n>> See it represented as\na bidirectional arrow, but\n\n581\n00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.079\nwhen you really get in there and look at\nit, it's a series of separate one way.\n\n582\n00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:09.923\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Series of uni directional solutions,\n\n583\n00:27:09.923 --> 00:27:12.440\nas are trust relationships in some cases,\nright?\n\n584\n00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.360\nEven though we are,\nwe do call them bi-directional.\n\n585\n00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.300\nAnd indeed they are.\n\n586\n00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.050\nThey really are a collection of one way\nconnections that are then negotiated and\n\n587\n00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.280\nset up so that we can move\ntraffic back and forth, right?\n\n588\n00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.740\nSo that's the whole concept\nthat we're gonna think of here.\n\n589\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.560\nAnd so now that we have this,\nwhat we're gonna do is go ahead and\n\n590\n00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.840\njust zoom out for a minute.\n\n591\n00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.050\nAnd we're going to go in,\nwe're going to look at properties.\n\n592\n00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.860\nWe're just going to go up here, we're\ngoing to click on properties just to see\n\n593\n00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.402\nwhat's going on, so I'll bring this up.\n\n594\n00:27:38.947 --> 00:27:43.121\nAnd you'll see we're looking at the\nproperties of the primary site connection,\n\n595\n00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:44.470\nthe PLAB connection out.\n\n596\n00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:46.190\nWe can do this on either one.\n\n597\n00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:49.280\nAnd when we do this, we see\nthe properties, we see the schedule.\n\n598\n00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.140\nWe see rate limits.\n\n599\n00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.330\nWe see the ability to be able to go in and\n\n600\n00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.580\nto set up the access account\nthat may be required.\n\n601\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.360\nThe destination site server is there.\n\n602\n00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.750\nWhen we go through, we look at schedule,\nwe're able to go in and\n\n603\n00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.040\nsee when replication is taking place.\n\n604\n00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.780\nRight now by default we have it set up so\nthat it's available all the time, and\n\n605\n00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.330\neffectively, you know,\nit's just always on but\n\n606\n00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.775\nobviously we can start blocking\nout areas if we need to.\n\n607\n00:28:14.775 --> 00:28:16.995\nAnd we also have the ability\nto do Rate Limiting.\n\n608\n00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:19.315\nRate Limiting is effectively throttling,\nright?\n\n609\n00:28:19.315 --> 00:28:23.075\nWe have the ability to say, hey over this\nperiod of time, I wanna go ahead and\n\n610\n00:28:23.075 --> 00:28:28.077\nI wanna specify that we're going to\nset up the ability to be able to limit\n\n611\n00:28:28.077 --> 00:28:30.497\nthe maximum data transfer by time and\n\n612\n00:28:30.497 --> 00:28:33.657\nsay how much data over how\nmuch time is gonna go.\n\n613\n00:28:33.657 --> 00:28:35.937\nSo we can effectively control\nin throttle replication.\n\n614\n00:28:35.937 --> 00:28:37.437\n>> Probably something that\nwe really need to consider,\n\n615\n00:28:37.437 --> 00:28:40.342\nespecially when you're talking about\nsecondary sites a lot of times are set up,\n\n616\n00:28:40.342 --> 00:28:43.058\nwhere I have limited bandwidth.\n\n617\n00:28:43.058 --> 00:28:44.088\n>> Absolutely right and\n\n618\n00:28:44.088 --> 00:28:47.148\nthat's absolutely correct and it's real\nimportant to remind ourselves of that.\n\n619\n00:28:47.148 --> 00:28:50.998\nI'm glad you brought that up because this\nis really one of the key reasons, probably\n\n620\n00:28:50.998 --> 00:28:55.538\nthe key reason actually, that we set up\nand configured a secondary site server.\n\n621\n00:28:55.538 --> 00:28:57.728\nWhich is when we wanna deal\nwith low bandwidth issues or\n\n622\n00:28:57.728 --> 00:28:59.088\nunreliable bandwidth issues.\n\n623\n00:28:59.088 --> 00:29:00.132\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n624\n00:29:00.132 --> 00:29:03.592\nbeing able to have the ability to do\nthrottling becomes very, very critical.\n\n625\n00:29:03.592 --> 00:29:05.360\nSo this is one of\nthe things we can do here.\n\n626\n00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.370\nNow we're also going to go in and\n\n627\n00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:10.110\nwe'll just get rid of this particular item\nnow that we've just seen what's there.\n\n628\n00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.000\nWe're gonna also go in and\n\n629\n00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.160\nwe're just going to quickly take a look\nat the database replication area.\n\n630\n00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.800\nAnd with database replication,\nwhat we can do is we can go in\n\n631\n00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.540\nand, just give me half a second here.\n\n632\n00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.180\n>> Let that machine wake up again.\n\n633\n00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:27.720\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n634\n00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.550\n>> And it may not be ready yet,\n\n635\n00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.520\nbecause the secondary\nsite is still cooking.\n\n636\n00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.196\nSo I may not actually have\nanything in this one yet.\n\n637\n00:29:34.196 --> 00:29:37.760\nI know File Replication shows up, cuz it's\none of the first things the wizard does\n\n638\n00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.220\nwhen it does the configuration.\n\n639\n00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:39.760\nLet's just see.\n\n640\n00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.830\nWe'll give it a second and\nif we can't show that to you now,\n\n641\n00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.940\nwe can always just come back to\ntake a look at it another time.\n\n642\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.660\nLet me just refresh in\nthe console here real quick and\n\n643\n00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:52.520\nsee if maybe we can get to have\nsomething up in database replication.\n\n644\n00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.250\nRemember this is live boys and\ngirls no safety net right.\n\n645\n00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.113\n>> That's right.\n>> Yeah we don't have\n\n646\n00:29:56.113 --> 00:29:56.950\nanything in there yet.\n\n647\n00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.020\nWe just haven't gotten to the point of\nthe config where it's running behind\n\n648\n00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.180\nthe scenes where it's\ndone the connectors yet.\n\n649\n00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.330\nThat usually happens four of five\nsteps down on the configuration.\n\n650\n00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.920\nWe may just not have gotten there yet.\n\n651\n00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.500\nBut the idea would have been the same.\n\n652\n00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.330\nI was just going to show you that we\neffectively have a set of connectors\n\n653\n00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.620\nroughly looking the same\nthat we can interact with.\n\n654\n00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.940\nAnd we can go in and we can take\na look at the child database and\n\n655\n00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.320\njust take a look at the properties.\n\n656\n00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.320\nWe can take a look at\nthe sender tab in there and\n\n657\n00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.770\njust see what's going on\nwith the replication.\n\n658\n00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.070\nSo we can always circle back to that\nat some point in a future episode.\n\n659\n00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.060\nBut the idea is the same.\n\n660\n00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.210\nWe just wanted to be able to show you now\nthat we have a secondary site set up,\n\n661\n00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.570\nhow these communication pathways\nare going to be created and\n\n662\n00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.930\nultimately what they're gonna look like.\n\n663\n00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.960\n>> Very good.\n\n664\n00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.830\nAll right, well Adam again another\ngreat look, love these labs,\n\n665\n00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.060\nlove these demonstrations.\n\n666\n00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:42.220\nGot to see how to set up that secondary\nsite, associated with that primary site.\n\n667\n00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.780\nGot to see the things going on in\nthe background, getting everything set up.\n\n668\n00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.290\nIt's still in the process of\nbuilding that secondary site up but\n\n669\n00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.500\nwe got to see everything\nwe really needed to see.\n\n670\n00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.450\nFantastic, appreciate that.\n\n671\n00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.540\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Hope you guys enjoyed this one.\n\n672\n00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.680\nRemember, if you want to attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n673\n00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.380\nshoot us an email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n674\n00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.986\nSigning off for this one,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n675\n00:31:00.986 --> 00:31:01.799\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n676\n00:31:01.799 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:18.000\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.060\nToday we're doing our SCCM 2012R2 content.\n\n5\n00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.160\nAnd specifically in this episode, the one\nyou guys have all been waiting for,\n\n6\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.660\nI know, is our-\n>> Not me.\n\n7\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.300\n>> Operating system deployment [LAUGH].\n\n8\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.240\nAnd here to help us work our way\nthrough this relatively complex but\n\n9\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.865\nfun, exciting topic is Adam Gordon,\nhow you doing Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:38.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm good, I'm good.\n\n11\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.820\nI'll see if I can say the same\nthing when we're done.\n\n12\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.100\nAll right, so here is the plan for\noperating system deployment.\n\n13\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.730\nWe're gonna do something a little bit\ndifferent for you guys because here\n\n14\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.550\nat ITProTV it's all about Mike\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.240\n>> And so as a result of that we're gonna\n\n16\n00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.560\nchange up what we're doing just a bit,\nso what we-\n\n17\n00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.280\n>> I feel so important.\n\n18\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.322\n>> You should, you should, and you nailed\nthat entry, you got it right, not once but\n\n19\n00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:01.380\ntwice which is even better.\n\n20\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n21\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.820\nwhat we're gonna do is take a little bit\nof a different approach with this thing.\n\n22\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.190\nThe Operating System deployment is a very\nimportant part of what we use SCCM for\n\n23\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.780\nbut it's also, as Mike indicated,\na fairly complex topic.\n\n24\n00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.726\nOne that has a lot of moving parts,\none that has a lot of things that will go\n\n25\n00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:23.062\nright that we will walk you through how to\nmake them go right, but can go sideways\n\n26\n00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:27.170\nif you're not taking your time and\ndon't understand what you're doing.\n\n27\n00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.522\nAnd in order to give you the full scope,\nthe full picture, end to end of what needs\n\n28\n00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:35.812\nto happen to make this technology work\nthe right way which is of course obviously\n\n29\n00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:39.396\ngonna be very critical to what\nwe're doing in terms of this topic,\n\n30\n00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:40.996\nwe wanna be able to go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:45.090\nhave an environment where we can\ndemo all of that for you end to end.\n\n32\n00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.470\nAnd we also wanna give you the opportunity\nto be able to play with this in particular\n\n33\n00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.650\npiece of functionality, and\nthis solution end to end and\n\n34\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.830\nbe able to reproduce it, and if you don't\nhave the ability to be able to do so\n\n35\n00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.040\nbecause you don't have SCCM up and\nrunning.\n\n36\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.690\nWe thought it would be great to show\nyou a way that you can do that and\n\n37\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.140\nbe able to do that as often as you like,\n\n38\n00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.570\nusing Microsoft's hands on labs that\nare hosted and are free of charge.\n\n39\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.920\nSo what we're gonna do is to\nshow you that we firmly believe\n\n40\n00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.000\nthat those labs are as good\nas they possibly can be.\n\n41\n00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.490\nWe're gonna use them to actually drive\nthis entire deployment segment for you.\n\n42\n00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.230\nAnd, I'm gonna operate, and doing all of\nthe demoing, and all of the discussion,\n\n43\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.580\nright out of the same environment that\nwe're encouraging you to take a look at,\n\n44\n00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.290\nand use, as a hands-on lab.\n\n45\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.150\nIf you wanna go back and\n\n46\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.360\nreview this material, because if we don't\nbelieve in it enough to actually use it,\n\n47\n00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.760\nit would be very hard for us to tell\nyou that you should go out and use it.\n\n48\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.760\nSo, we thought it would be great if\nwe actually used this environment so\n\n49\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.050\nthat we can demo everything for\n\n50\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.510\nyou so, we are gonna walk you through the\nprocess in the beginning of just how to go\n\n51\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.520\nfind this content in case you aren't\naware of the fact that it exisst.\n\n52\n00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.630\nAnd you know we assume a lot\nof thing often times and\n\n53\n00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.540\nmost of my students are aware of this but\nnot everybody is.\n\n54\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.030\nAnd sometimes I have students\nthat come in to class and say,\n\n55\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.160\nhey I never heard about that,\nnever knew that that stuff was out there.\n\n56\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.580\nSo I wanted to take the time\nto show you where to find it.\n\n57\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.030\nAnd then we're gonna actually show\nyou how to get set up to use it.\n\n58\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.710\nReally, all you need's a Windows Live ID.\n\n59\n00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.810\nIf you don't have one,\nyou can easily create an account.\n\n60\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.990\nIt's very straightforward.\n\n61\n00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.740\nIt's free.\n\n62\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.330\nWe like free.\n\n63\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.270\nFree is good.\n>> We do.\n\n64\n00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.030\n>> Right?\nSo,\n\n65\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.210\nit's gonna be just the process of\nme logging on with my Windows ID,\n\n66\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.640\nselecting the appropriate lab,\nand then launching it.\n\n67\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.640\nThe lab interface looks somewhat\nsimilar what we have been demoing with.\n\n68\n00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.720\nThe particulars of the actual\nexternal window and\n\n69\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.040\nwhat goes on in there really\nnot all that important for us.\n\n70\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.630\nWe will go on and we will select the\nappropriate machines, there is a lab guide\n\n71\n00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.420\nthat comes with everyone of these hands\non labs that you can download and\n\n72\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.460\nhave as a reference point externally.\n\n73\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.760\nIt is about a 30 some odd page,\nabout 32 pages in this case lab guide.\n\n74\n00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.490\nBut we're gonna do a bare metal install\nend-to-end for a Windows 8.1 image.\n\n75\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.460\nSo we're gonna walk you through how to set\nup, configure SCCM, put all the moving\n\n76\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.390\nparts and pieces in, including\ngetting the PXE boot support set up.\n\n77\n00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.730\nWe'll specify device affinity so\nthe user advice affinity can be toggled.\n\n78\n00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.020\nWhen we do the image install,\nwe'll capture a reference image.\n\n79\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.700\nMeaning, we'll take a Windows 8.1 machine,\nand we'll capture it,\n\n80\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.240\nso we have that as a base\nof working solution.\n\n81\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.080\nWe'll do a little task sequencing.\n\n82\n00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.110\nDo editing on the image.\n\n83\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.430\nIn other words,\nmake sure we know what's going on there.\n\n84\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.570\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\nwe will actually set the task sequence up.\n\n85\n00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.550\nAnd we will actually\nkick off a deployment.\n\n86\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.705\nNow, to be clear.\n\n87\n00:04:18.705 --> 00:04:21.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're not gonna spend three hours\n\n88\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.360\nwatching the deployment happen becuase\nit does take a while to deploy, but\n\n89\n00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.390\nwe are gonna get it ready,\nkick it off, let you see it start.\n\n90\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.500\nAnd then it'll cycle through.\n\n91\n00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.290\nDo a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n92\n00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.798\nWe're not going to stick around for\nall that.\n\n93\n00:04:31.798 --> 00:04:33.630\nYou're gonna use your imaginations and\n\n94\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.100\nyou're gonna close your eyes, and\nMike's gonna play a little harp music for\n\n95\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.500\nyou, and we'll lite a candle, and have\na little incense taking place here, and\n\n96\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500\nyou'll imaging, if you will,\njoin me on a journey.\n\n97\n00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.190\nThere we go.\n\n98\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.870\nYou know what I actually saw last\nnight on TV, is actually really cool,\n\n99\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.190\nsince you did all that.\n\n100\n00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.829\nSo I see, when we got done shooting\nbecause we don't do this 24 hours\n\n101\n00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:55.040\naround the clock,\nalthough it feels that way sometimes.\n\n102\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We didn't do it.\n\n103\n00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.351\nWe actually had a little time last night,\nor at least I did anyway before I got\n\n104\n00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:04.397\ndone, and so when I went back to kinda\nrelax and kick back for a bit, got back\n\n105\n00:05:04.397 --> 00:05:08.790\nand turned on the TV, and actually Willy\nWonka and the Chocolate Factory was on.\n\n106\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.630\n>> Really?\n>> The original, which is the only one.\n\n107\n00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.045\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n108\n00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.775\n>> Because the other one,\nthe one with Johnny Depp is okay.\n\n109\n00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:16.645\nIt's nothing wrong,\nI like Johnny Depp a lot.\n\n110\n00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:19.775\nBut I just don't care for\nwhat they did with the treatment of it.\n\n111\n00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:23.275\nI think they just took something that was\nawesome and was just cool the way it was.\n\n112\n00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:26.065\nAnd although they updated it,\nit just never really was the same,\n\n113\n00:05:26.065 --> 00:05:26.615\nat least for me.\n\n114\n00:05:26.615 --> 00:05:28.730\nI'm of that generation that\nyou saw the original and\n\n115\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.850\ngrew up with it,\nthat's Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,\n\n116\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.070\nthat was a classic we'd watch\nevery year at the holidays.\n\n117\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.750\nSo, actually, I got to watch that last\nnight, but the reason I just thought about\n\n118\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.520\nthat was we have that whole scene\nin there where he's on the boat,\n\n119\n00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.400\nand before he goes with the whole\npsychedelic trip and he goes crazy.\n\n120\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.830\nAnd they go, they show all the background\nstuff, and they go nuts on the boat,\n\n121\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.830\nhe starts singing Gene Wilder\nstarts singing as Willy Wonka,\n\n122\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.050\ncoming soon to a theater near you,\nhe starts singing that song\n\n123\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.320\nabout how they're gonna go on the boat\ntrip and the whole nine yards.\n\n124\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.800\nAnd so, Mike's gonna do that for you.\n\n125\n00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.300\nHe's memorized the song, and\nwe're gonna let him sing that for\n\n126\n00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.870\nyou later while we are finishing\nup the deployment.\n\n127\n00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.982\nSo if you make it through\nthe entire episode and\n\n128\n00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:12.465\nyou hang all the way through with us,\nyou're gonna get to hear Mike warble.\n\n129\n00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:14.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And he is going to not wobble,\n\n130\n00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.770\nbut warble.\n\n131\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.040\nHe is going to sing.\n\n132\n00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.510\nAnd boy, is that something\nexciting to stick around for.\n\n133\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.010\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n134\n00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.220\n>> Let me tell you what.\n\n135\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.880\nAll right.\nSo\n\n136\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.330\nwhat we're gonna do is go to my screen and\nmy machine here, if we could.\n\n137\n00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.010\nWe're gonna get in and get started.\n\n138\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.760\nNow, just a couple of ground\nrules before we do this.\n\n139\n00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.009\nThe one thing, the only thing you want to\nbe aware of with the TechNet labs are they\n\n140\n00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.084\nare timed and there is a clicking tock.\n\n141\n00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.111\nThere is a-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:06:40.111 --> 00:06:42.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.670\nOh my god, it's been a long day.\n\n144\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.940\nThere is a clock that is gonna tick\ndown in there from 75 minutes,\n\n145\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.230\nso just about two hours,\ngive or take down to zero.\n\n146\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.560\nSo what we're gonna do is I'm\ncertainly gonna try to zoom in and\n\n147\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.510\nI'm gonna certainly try\nto narrate as we go.\n\n148\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.390\nBut we are gonna be a little bit pressed\nfor time, in order to make sure we get all\n\n149\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.030\nof this done, and\nget all the way through the demo.\n\n150\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.660\nSo we're gonna constrain\nourselves a little bit and\n\n151\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.730\nnot quite have as much of the discussion.\n\n152\n00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.440\nAnd, as much of the deep thought process\naround doing things that we have,\n\n153\n00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.610\nexhibited and shown you the other areas.\n\n154\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.380\nThat doesn't mean that we're not gonna\ncapture that for you, but we're going to\n\n155\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.115\nkeep it to a minimum during the live demo,\nbecause that way, we can move through.\n\n156\n00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:28.055\nAnd there'll be a couple of key break\npoints where we're waiting on some\n\n157\n00:07:28.055 --> 00:07:29.125\nthings to happen.\n\n158\n00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:31.925\nAnd we'll then kind of circle back and\nsummarize a little bit,\n\n159\n00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:34.605\ntalk about some of the things we've\nbeen doing up until that point.\n\n160\n00:07:34.605 --> 00:07:37.895\nSo it'll still flow more or\nless roughly the same way it's been.\n\n161\n00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:41.685\nBut it's gonna be compressed into certain\nareas where we can do some talking while\n\n162\n00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:44.350\nwe're waiting on some things and\nmaximize our time.\n\n163\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.379\nWe're also going to try to make sure\nas much as possible, in the environment\n\n164\n00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:54.972\nas we're demoing that we are minimizing\nflipping back and forth between machines.\n\n165\n00:07:54.972 --> 00:07:57.121\nAlthough we will do that a little bit and\nexplain why, so\n\n166\n00:07:57.121 --> 00:07:58.368\nwe can be doing certain things.\n\n167\n00:07:58.368 --> 00:08:01.468\nBut we are gonna try to really not\nonly stay focused on what we're here\n\n168\n00:08:01.468 --> 00:08:04.994\nto accomplish, but as I normally do where\nI go out and say, hey, let me show you\n\n169\n00:08:04.994 --> 00:08:08.440\nthis other cool stuff, remember we\ndid this, let's talk about this.\n\n170\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.320\nI'm not going to do as much as that here,\nbecause we really want to be sensitive to\n\n171\n00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.500\nthe amount of time we have, to get this\ndone, so if you notice a little bit of\n\n172\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.200\na change in our general approach to this\none, it is with that following caveat, so\n\n173\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.540\nwe can maximize the amount of stuff we can\nget done for you in this episode, okay?\n\n174\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.259\nSo if you guys are cool with that,\nwe're gonna get going,\n\n175\n00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:28.199\ncan we go to full screen please,\nthat way we can just go ahead and\n\n176\n00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:31.474\nsee what's going on, so what we did here,\nI'm gonna just scroll up so\n\n177\n00:08:31.474 --> 00:08:35.450\nwe can see where we are, we're in TechNet,\nand we're on the TechNet Virtual Labs.\n\n178\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.191\nAnd what we're gonna do, and\nMike will actually capture this URL and\n\n179\n00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:43.060\nput it up there for you at some point\nlater, oh, you could see it here and\n\n180\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.125\nI'll leave it up for a minute, so\nif you guys wanna actually follow along,\n\n181\n00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:50.995\nyou actually can type that in and\ngo there as well, but you'll see it's\n\n182\n00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:55.258\ntechnet.microsoft.com/en-us/virtuallabs,\nthis is gonna take you to\n\n183\n00:08:55.258 --> 00:08:59.193\nthe hands on hosted labs section of\nMicrosoft at the TechNet site, now,\n\n184\n00:08:59.193 --> 00:09:03.129\na little warning here, this URL\nnormally doesn't change, but every so\n\n185\n00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:07.578\noften, Microsoft, I think they just get\nrestless, they got nothing going on.\n\n186\n00:09:07.578 --> 00:09:10.395\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> No products, no companies to go out and\n\n187\n00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:15.103\nbuy, and so as a result, they do randomly\nmove their real estate around every so\n\n188\n00:09:15.103 --> 00:09:19.810\noften and so if, in the future, you're\nwatching this, you go to that URL, and\n\n189\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.169\nit doesn't take you exactly to the page\nthat we're looking at right now,\n\n190\n00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:28.736\nall you need to do is just go to TechNet,\nand just search for Virtual Labs, and\n\n191\n00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:30.493\nyou'll find them, right?\n\n192\n00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:33.835\nSo just wanna know that although it\nshould, almost without exception,\n\n193\n00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:36.352\nalways be that URL,\nif it does switch for some reason,\n\n194\n00:09:36.352 --> 00:09:38.575\nat least you know how to deal with that,\nright?\n\n195\n00:09:38.575 --> 00:09:42.735\nAll right, so on the Virtual Lab website,\nwhere we go down,\n\n196\n00:09:42.735 --> 00:09:47.874\nwe have a little selector area off to\nthe left here and we can just choose what\n\n197\n00:09:47.874 --> 00:09:53.503\nit is that we wanna see and so we're gonna\ncome under here, open up System Center,\n\n198\n00:09:53.503 --> 00:09:59.370\nopen up System Center again, there's\na bunch of different System Center items.\n\n199\n00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.460\nWe're going to choose System Center\nConfiguration Manager 2012 R2, so\n\n200\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.630\nwe're gonna check that box off it will\nthen filter all the labs off to the right,\n\n201\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.810\nand then prioritize them and\nshow us the ones that we want, so\n\n202\n00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.110\nwe're gonna do that right now, and\n\n203\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:20.250\nas soon as that is done you will see it\nswitches over, let's just go take a look.\n\n204\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.600\nAnd so now that we have selected,\nas you can see there,\n\n205\n00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.790\nwe have all these different labs here,\nnow, again, the order may differ by\n\n206\n00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.630\nthe time you go in to look at them,\nthese labs may have changed, who knows.\n\n207\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.439\nBut for now, at the moment in\ntime that we're shooting this,\n\n208\n00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:43.220\nyou'll see there is a lab there Deploying\nWindows 8.1 to Bare Metal Clients, so\n\n209\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.622\nwe're gonna choose that lab and\nthat's the one we're gonna jump into, so\n\n210\n00:10:46.622 --> 00:10:49.862\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna click on that, and\n\n211\n00:10:49.862 --> 00:10:53.157\nif we hover over, we get a little\ndescription what the lab looks like, so\n\n212\n00:10:53.157 --> 00:10:55.675\nyou can obviously read\nthat if you would like.\n\n213\n00:10:55.675 --> 00:11:00.595\nWe're then gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ncome right down here at the bottom of that\n\n214\n00:11:00.595 --> 00:11:04.287\npage to where it says Get Started,\nwe're to click on that link, and\n\n215\n00:11:04.287 --> 00:11:08.207\nthat then is going to allow us to be able\nto get going, now I will just point out to\n\n216\n00:11:08.207 --> 00:11:13.197\nyou, right up here, just for a minute that\nthere is a link for System Requirements.\n\n217\n00:11:13.197 --> 00:11:17.310\nIf you're not sure if your machine will\nrun the lab, there's no plugin, simply, or\n\n218\n00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.740\nanything required, it's pretty straight\nforward, but, in case you are concerned,\n\n219\n00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.690\njust go to that link, check the system\nrequirements, make sure your system meets\n\n220\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.800\nwhatever the requirement are,\nand then you should be good.\n\n221\n00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:33.200\nWe're gonna click, Get Started Here,\nand then we are going to\n\n222\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.980\nbe able to launch our lab, now,\nI've already signed in, when you do this\n\n223\n00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:43.070\nthe first time, it'll prompt you and\nsay, Hey sign in and get started,\n\n224\n00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.580\nyou'll have to click there, that's where\nyou put in your account credential.\n\n225\n00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.830\nSo if you don't have a Windows Live ID,\nI won't even say .NET passport, for\n\n226\n00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.140\nthose of you who have been around for\na million years,\n\n227\n00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.670\nif you don't have a Windows Live ID,\nthen what you're gonna do is,\n\n228\n00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:00.000\nobviously be prompted to create an account\nwhen you do click there, and, you'll be\n\n229\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.010\nable to do that, and then you can sign in,\nand it'll bring you right back here, and,\n\n230\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.960\nthat link will then go live, and\nyou will be able to launch the lab.\n\n231\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.830\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and launch the\nlab right now in order to get started, so\n\n232\n00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.560\nwe're gonna do that, it will take,\nas you can see, a moment,\n\n233\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.642\nyou'll see this screen, it'll be building,\nso it's gonna be gears spinning and\n\n234\n00:12:18.642 --> 00:12:22.610\nwhirling and yeah, doing stuff in\nthere for about a minute or so, and\n\n235\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.160\nthen when it gets done, we'll be able\nto actually get our lab interface up.\n\n236\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.503\nSo we'll give that just a moment to\nbe able to build, and you can see,\n\n237\n00:12:29.503 --> 00:12:31.243\nit's running pretty quick there.\n\n238\n00:12:31.243 --> 00:12:34.241\n>> Yeah, these are just a valuable\nresource for this, and for other things,\n\n239\n00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:36.535\nwith Microsoft products,\nthose [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK].\n\n240\n00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:40.148\n>> Yeah there's such ton of other labs\nare not just System Centers Exchange, or\n\n241\n00:12:40.148 --> 00:12:42.483\nSharePoint Sequel,\nall sorts of stuff in there,\n\n242\n00:12:42.483 --> 00:12:46.153\nall sorts of Windows Server admin stuff\nfor people that are just starting out,\n\n243\n00:12:46.153 --> 00:12:48.380\nthat wanna learn a little bit about that.\n\n244\n00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.600\nSo we've got, and we'll just quickly\nshow you the interface here,\n\n245\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.120\nwe have got a selector on the left that\nlets us move between the machines,\n\n246\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.000\nwe're gonna move down to the R2 Primary 1,\nthat's our system center machine.\n\n247\n00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.740\nClient81 is the existing\nWindows 8 install.\n\n248\n00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.493\nBare Metal Client,\nwhich is what's booting up right now,\n\n249\n00:13:06.493 --> 00:13:08.915\nis the shell box that we're\nalso gonna deploy into,\n\n250\n00:13:08.915 --> 00:13:12.548\nso, just so you know that we're gonna\nleave that running, we're go ahead and\n\n251\n00:13:12.548 --> 00:13:15.659\nclick over there, and you'll see\nthat it allows us to go right in.\n\n252\n00:13:15.659 --> 00:13:19.673\nWhat I'm gonna do is come down here,\nI'm gonna Go To Start,\n\n253\n00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:23.060\nand I'm gonna open up\nthe Config Manager console,\n\n254\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.704\nso we're gonna give that just a minute\nto launch and to load for us, and\n\n255\n00:13:27.704 --> 00:13:32.536\nthat will come right up and we're just\ngonna get that up and run in there.\n\n256\n00:13:35.034 --> 00:13:41.500\nAll right, so we have that loaded up,\nnow, the other thing that we're gonna do,\n\n257\n00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:47.030\njust minimize that there for\njust a second, is we're gonna go ahead,\n\n258\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.714\nand we are gonna open up\nthe Server Manager, so lets go in and\n\n259\n00:13:51.714 --> 00:13:56.398\nopen that up as well,\nnow this is not a Server 12 machine,\n\n260\n00:13:56.398 --> 00:14:02.685\nthat we're hosting on, this is\na server 2008 R2 machine, I believe.\n\n261\n00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:05.345\nSo may look a little different than\nthe one you've been used to seeing in\n\n262\n00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:09.475\nthe other demos, where we've been using\nServer 12 on the back-end as the OS, and\n\n263\n00:14:09.475 --> 00:14:11.505\nthat Server Manager looks\nlittle different, but\n\n264\n00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:13.115\nit's basically gonna be the same idea.\n\n265\n00:14:13.115 --> 00:14:17.085\nSo what we're gonna do here, is we're\ngonna come over here to Roles, and\n\n266\n00:14:17.085 --> 00:14:20.994\nwe're going to add a Role, so\nlet's right-click, choose Add Roles,\n\n267\n00:14:20.994 --> 00:14:25.284\nrun the Add Role Wizard, you guys have\nseen this before, and what we need to do,\n\n268\n00:14:25.284 --> 00:14:28.869\nis we need to go in here and\nI will zoom in, I'm gonna highlight it,\n\n269\n00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:33.544\nselect it there, and just zoom in briefly,\nwe need to have a Windows, that was great,\n\n270\n00:14:33.544 --> 00:14:37.120\nthat was like the perfect zoom,\nyou ever see those commercials?\n\n271\n00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.278\nThis is the only digression we're\ngonna make the entire time,\n\n272\n00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:40.418\nyou ever see those commercials,\n\n273\n00:14:40.418 --> 00:14:43.118\nthe MS commercials with Jerry Seinfeld,\nthe perfect pour at the gas station?\n\n274\n00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:43.660\n>> Yeah.\n\n275\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.826\n>> Right?\nSo it was like that.\n\n276\n00:14:44.826 --> 00:14:46.638\n[LAUGH]\n>> I couldn't try that again and\n\n277\n00:14:46.638 --> 00:14:47.900\ndo that if I tried.\n\n278\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.540\nSo Windows Deployment Services,\nwe need to have a WDS box available,\n\n279\n00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.170\nbut it has to be on the same\nbox as the site server\n\n280\n00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:00.050\nin order to be able to do this in Server\n12 R2, we now have that requirement, so\n\n281\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.050\nwe're gonna install the Windows Deployment\nServices as part of this to get this up\n\n282\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.310\nand running, so you're gonna see me\njust quickly configure this out.\n\n283\n00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:12.040\nI'm gonna click there, hit Next,\nwe get our little welcome screen for WDS,\n\n284\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.040\nno big deal there, we then are gonna\ngo ahead, and we see that we have\n\n285\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:22.070\nboth the Deployment Server and\nTransport Server options selected,\n\n286\n00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:26.580\nso we have those there, we're going to\nmake sure that we see those, they're good,\n\n287\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.360\nwe're gonna leave them selected,\nwe're gonna click Next, and\n\n288\n00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.260\nwe're gonna click Install,\nwe're gonna go off to the races here,\n\n289\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.612\nwe're gonna get that up and\nrunning, it doesn't take too long,\n\n290\n00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:39.210\nit actually takes about a minute maybe, or\ntwo, there we go, installation succeeded,\n\n291\n00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:43.690\npretty straight forward, click Close and\nwe should have that up and running.\n\n292\n00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.668\nAll right, so\nnow that we have that installed,\n\n293\n00:15:46.668 --> 00:15:50.987\nand we will see that that role is there,\nwe'll just come over here and\n\n294\n00:15:50.987 --> 00:15:56.049\nwe'll zoom in real quickly so you can see,\nwhoa, hello, crazy man on the zoom,\n\n295\n00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:59.846\nwe can see Windows Deployment Services\nnow listed as a role,\n\n296\n00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:04.252\nit's been installed, so we can see that,\nso we're gonna minimize.\n\n297\n00:16:04.252 --> 00:16:06.052\nOut of that server manager.\n\n298\n00:16:06.052 --> 00:16:08.358\nCome down here and\nget our console back up.\n\n299\n00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:09.937\nGive me just a second to bring that up.\n\n300\n00:16:09.937 --> 00:16:13.112\nAll right, so now that we have that,\nright, we're gonna go in and\n\n301\n00:16:13.112 --> 00:16:15.450\nstart twiddling around\nwith a couple of things.\n\n302\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.743\nBut we need to go ahead and we need to\nmake sure that we take a look at WDS and\n\n303\n00:16:20.743 --> 00:16:25.793\nwe configure the service console\nbefore we start the integration.\n\n304\n00:16:25.793 --> 00:16:29.085\nSo we're gonna go to the WDS console and\nopen that up.\n\n305\n00:16:29.085 --> 00:16:31.570\nSo let me, actually I'll just leave\nthat open, that's no big deal.\n\n306\n00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.830\nWe can do that right from here.\n\n307\n00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.730\nLet's just go to Administrative Tools,\nand we'll just bring up WDS,\n\n308\n00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.331\nthat's gonna be down\ntowards the bottom here.\n\n309\n00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.403\nAnd, where is it?\n\n310\n00:16:41.403 --> 00:16:44.620\nRight there, Windows Deployment Services,\nwe'll bring that up.\n\n311\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:51.843\nLet's open up the server here,\nopen up our primary one .config manager.\n\n312\n00:16:51.843 --> 00:16:56.394\nDomain or ConfigMgrDom.local, that's\ngonna be our server in its current state.\n\n313\n00:16:56.394 --> 00:17:02.950\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna go\nahead, and we are going to highlight that.\n\n314\n00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.865\nAnd up on the action menu,\nwe're gonna go ahead and configure server.\n\n315\n00:17:06.865 --> 00:17:07.820\nSo gonna bring that up.\n\n316\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.550\nWe'll get a little wizard\nhere before you begin.\n\n317\n00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.215\nSo then we have to enter a path to\nthe remote installation folder.\n\n318\n00:17:14.215 --> 00:17:15.921\nSo we're gonna make sure we have that.\n\n319\n00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:20.800\nLet's make sure that we use the default\none, I believe, for boot images.\n\n320\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.680\nThat will just be C:\\RemoteInstall.\n\n321\n00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.200\nNo big deal, we can use that.\n\n322\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.180\nYou can change that, by the way, if you\nwould like, but that's the one that comes\n\n323\n00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.100\nup and that's the one that we'll be\ngoing ahead and we will be using.\n\n324\n00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.576\nWe'll go ahead and we will click Next.\n\n325\n00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:38.310\nNow we get a little warning\nif we do this on the C drive.\n\n326\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.790\nSo let's just take a look there.\n\n327\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.240\nVolume selected is also\nWindows system volume.\n\n328\n00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.588\nWe recommend that you\nmove that somewhere else,\n\n329\n00:17:44.588 --> 00:17:47.064\nbecause you wanna make sure\nyou have enough space.\n\n330\n00:17:47.064 --> 00:17:51.420\nAnd not only that but from a performance\nstandpoint tends to bog down the system.\n\n331\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.700\nBut hey, we're just gonna be rebels.\n\n332\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.380\n>> Living on the edge.\n\n333\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.615\n>> And we're not gonna pay\nattention to any of that.\n\n334\n00:17:56.615 --> 00:17:58.760\nWarnings, who needs warnings, right.\n\n335\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.370\nAll right, so we're then gonna see that we\nquickly have a DHCP Option 60 screen for\n\n336\n00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.970\nconfiguration here.\n\n337\n00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.080\nThis is gonna indicate that if we\nset this up on the same server,\n\n338\n00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.030\nwe're gonna need to make sure that\nwe tell this service, WDS, not\n\n339\n00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:18.870\nto use certain ports the DHCP is already\nusing or we're gonna run into a conflict.\n\n340\n00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.090\nSo this is going to be really\nimportant because by default,\n\n341\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.100\noh I was zoomed in, by default we\nactually do run into an issue here.\n\n342\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.410\nSo you'll see that we are going\nto be able to specify\n\n343\n00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.210\nthat with this configuration\nwe don't listen on port 67.\n\n344\n00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.910\nAnd we put the DHCP option 60,\nset it to PXE or PXEClient,\n\n345\n00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:39.685\nwhich will then allow us to do\na PXEClient boot down the road.\n\n346\n00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:43.240\nYou probably may often refer to that and\nknow that as a network boot.\n\n347\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.480\nF12 or whatever the function\nkey is that you hit to do that.\n\n348\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.560\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna set these up real quick.\n\n349\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.890\nSo let me just click there, click there,\ngonna go ahead and click Next.\n\n350\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:57.620\nThen Pixie server initial settings,\nwe're gonna specify\n\n351\n00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:02.000\nthat we want to respond all client\ncomputers unknown and known.\n\n352\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.710\nWhat this allows us to do,\nis to specify that as clients\n\n353\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:11.000\nhit the pixie server or\nthe boot server and they show up\n\n354\n00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.890\nwe're gonna respond to them even if\nwe are not able to know who they are,\n\n355\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.600\nmeaning we don't already have a record\nof them in the directory pre staged.\n\n356\n00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.080\nWe're going to still talk to them.\n\n357\n00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.450\nSo effectively we're saying we're\ngoing to talk to strangers.\n\n358\n00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.240\nIs what we're saying here.\n\n359\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.750\nBut we're going to do that and\nby doing that we're then going to allow\n\n360\n00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.800\nany machine that shows up to\npotentially pull down an image.\n\n361\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.295\nBecause some of the machines\nmay be pre staged.\n\n362\n00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:32.372\nOthers may not be.\n\n363\n00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:32.872\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n364\n00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:33.929\n>> So that's going to be important.\n\n365\n00:19:33.929 --> 00:19:34.587\nNow, we do have\n\n366\n00:19:34.587 --> 00:19:37.443\nan opt in option to require admin\napproval for unknown computers.\n\n367\n00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:39.502\nBut, they'll be put into a pending state,\n\n368\n00:19:39.502 --> 00:19:42.619\nand we'll then have to go ahead and\ndo some work on the back end, and\n\n369\n00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:45.812\nthat's gonna be complicated.\nSo, we're not gonna mess with that option.\n\n370\n00:19:45.812 --> 00:19:47.254\nBut, you do have that option in the real\n\n371\n00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:49.421\nworld, if you choose to.\nWe're just gonna go ahead, and\n\n372\n00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:50.356\nget that up and running.\n\n373\n00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.850\nWe're not gonna add any images\nto the server right now.\n\n374\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:55.740\nWe'll deal with that later.\n\n375\n00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.390\nSo we're gonna clear that dialog box,\nclick Finish, and then we now are going to\n\n376\n00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:05.500\nbe able to go in and start using WDS, and\n\n377\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.315\nintegrate it with our SSC console, or\nthrough the console integrated with SSC,\n\n378\n00:20:11.315 --> 00:20:14.160\nbecause you can see now it is up and\nrunning and configured.\n\n379\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.740\nCorrect?\n\n380\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.540\nSo we have done the back\nend work,so to speak.\n\n381\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.750\nWe'll just get rid of that and close that.\n\n382\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.070\nAnd now, in our console, we're gonna\ngo ahead and we're gonna come in.\n\n383\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:29.490\nAnd gonna go to the administration work\nspace as we often do to get started.\n\n384\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.960\nWe'll go to site configuration,\nand we'll go in and\n\n385\n00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.990\nwe will be able to take a look\nat distribution points here.\n\n386\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.420\nSo let's just go in and take a look.\n\n387\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.200\nWe'll see that we do have\na distribution point here.\n\n388\n00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.410\nI'll zoom in quickly so you can see it.\n\n389\n00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.520\nIt is there, we've already got it set up.\n\n390\n00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.440\nThat is our site server by the way.\n\n391\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.680\nSo we've got that set up and\nwhat we are then gonna do is go ahead and\n\n392\n00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.790\nmake sure that we look at\nproperties real quickly.\n\n393\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.040\nSo let's just go in and pull that up and\nwe're gonna configure this to support\n\n394\n00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.380\nPXE Boot or\nPXE Clients with PXE Client Support.\n\n395\n00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.150\nSo we're gonna go in go\nto properties here, and\n\n396\n00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.960\nyou'll see as I zoom in\nthat we have a PXE tab.\n\n397\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.070\nWe're gonna go to that PXE tab and\nmake a couple of changes there.\n\n398\n00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:19.250\nBecause by default, this distribution\npoint, all distribution points actually,\n\n399\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.850\nare set up to not work with\nPXE clients automatically.\n\n400\n00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:23.670\nWe have to enable them.\n\n401\n00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.290\nSo we're gonna enable that\ncheck box right there.\n\n402\n00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.420\nAnd you'll see that when we do that,\nwe'll then have some options.\n\n403\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.705\nIt says Windows Deployment Services\nwill be installed if required.\n\n404\n00:21:31.705 --> 00:21:34.110\nWell we've already done that, so\nwe're not worried about that.\n\n405\n00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.910\nBut then we're gonna specify that\nwe all the distribution point\n\n406\n00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.220\nto respond to incoming PXE requests.\n\n407\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.930\nEnable unknown computer support.\n\n408\n00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.090\nObviously we're going to make some\nadjustments here, maybe require a user\n\n409\n00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:48.950\nname, rather a password when we\nare connecting the computers with PXE, so\n\n410\n00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.970\nwe could add a password in there for\nsafety and for security.\n\n411\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.470\nSo we may choose to do those things.\n\n412\n00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.860\nSo we're going to ahead and\nset this up real quick.\n\n413\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.830\nWe'll check that off.\n\n414\n00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.864\nWe do get a little prompt here,\nprompt tells us hey,\n\n415\n00:22:01.864 --> 00:22:06.424\nwhen you use PXE make sure you\nknow that UDP port 67, 68, 69, and\n\n416\n00:22:06.424 --> 00:22:09.704\n4011 are gonna be used for\noperating install.\n\n417\n00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:11.654\nGonna use UDP port 69.\n\n418\n00:22:11.654 --> 00:22:14.560\nWe may need some firewall related\nstuff to get that configured.\n\n419\n00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.901\nAre you sure you want to do this?\n\n420\n00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:17.648\nAgain, no, I'm not sure.\n\n421\n00:22:17.648 --> 00:22:19.720\nI came all this way, and\nI've decided against it.\n\n422\n00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.305\nI'm not gonna do that at all.\n\n423\n00:22:21.305 --> 00:22:23.040\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna click the PXE tab.\n\n424\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.880\nWe've done all that.\n\n425\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.160\nWe're gonna go ahead,\ngot the enabled support there.\n\n426\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.540\nWe did all that, we said yes.\n\n427\n00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.166\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\n\n428\n00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:32.970\nallow the distribution point to\nrespond to incoming PXE clients.\n\n429\n00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.510\nWe're gonna check that off.\n\n430\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.110\nSo that's gonna obviously be\nvery important for us to do.\n\n431\n00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.330\nAnd enable unknown client's\ncomputer support as we said.\n\n432\n00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.200\nWe've got another little dialog box there.\n\n433\n00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.740\nLet's just zoom in and\nlet you see that one.\n\n434\n00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.010\nIt says any unknown computers\nthat use PXE OS deployments\n\n435\n00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.360\nwill attempt to run\nrequired task sequences.\n\n436\n00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.875\nThose task sequences are ones\nthat we will build later.\n\n437\n00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:52.932\nWe'll show you how to do that.\n\n438\n00:22:52.932 --> 00:22:55.776\nBut they could include doing\nsomething like applying an image.\n\n439\n00:22:55.776 --> 00:22:57.158\nPartitioning a disk.\n\n440\n00:22:57.158 --> 00:23:00.126\nWhat they're basically telling us is hey,\nif you're gonna do this,\n\n441\n00:23:00.126 --> 00:23:01.648\nmake sure you make a task sequence.\n\n442\n00:23:01.648 --> 00:23:03.885\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz task sequences are actually what\n\n443\n00:23:03.885 --> 00:23:04.980\ndrive the deployment.\n\n444\n00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.544\nWe're gonna talk about those and\nhow they work.\n\n445\n00:23:06.544 --> 00:23:08.109\nSo, we're gonna get all that done.\n\n446\n00:23:08.109 --> 00:23:10.425\nGone through our dialog.\n\n447\n00:23:10.425 --> 00:23:12.355\nWe're gonna not require a password.\n\n448\n00:23:12.355 --> 00:23:14.020\nSo, we're gonna uncheck that one.\n\n449\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.440\nWe're not gonna use that for\nsake of just brevity here.\n\n450\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.700\nAnd on the user device affinity area,\nwhich is right down here, we are going to\n\n451\n00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.480\npull down, and we are going to, and\nI'll zoom in so you can see it,\n\n452\n00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.540\nwe're going to request and actually\nallow users to do device affinity so\n\n453\n00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.590\nthat way we can actually have them specify\na device as part of this deployment.\n\n454\n00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.630\nSo we're going to do that, and\nwe're going to do that and\n\n455\n00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.220\nset that up with automatic approval.\n\n456\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.920\nSo I'm going to go ahead, and\nI'm going to do that right now.\n\n457\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.620\nGet that in there and\nthen we're going to click, Okay,\n\n458\n00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.460\nget that done,\nlet that just save itself off.\n\n459\n00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:53.705\nNow what we're gonna do, so we're gonna go\nahead and we are going to modify a boot\n\n460\n00:23:53.705 --> 00:23:58.742\nimage and prompt or have the boot image\nprompt the user for a device affinity.\n\n461\n00:23:58.742 --> 00:23:59.984\nWe just set up support for it.\n\n462\n00:23:59.984 --> 00:24:01.819\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nmodify the boot image.\n\n463\n00:24:01.819 --> 00:24:04.841\nAnd we have talked about what the boot\nimage is because it's obviously important\n\n464\n00:24:04.841 --> 00:24:05.824\nfor us To be aware of that.\n\n465\n00:24:05.824 --> 00:24:08.413\nSo let's go to the software\nlibrary workspace.\n\n466\n00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:11.727\nThis is where we're gonna start\nintegrating that third folder that we've\n\n467\n00:24:11.727 --> 00:24:14.987\nbeen talking about, but we haven't\nreally had a chance to play with yet,\n\n468\n00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:16.630\nwhich is the operating system area.\n\n469\n00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.180\nAnother perfect zoom.\n\n470\n00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.495\n>> Nice one.\n>> It's two for two.\n\n471\n00:24:19.495 --> 00:24:21.099\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Actually it's like two for\n\n472\n00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:23.080\ntwo hundred cuz I keep screwing up.\n\n473\n00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.080\nAt least those two were good.\n\n474\n00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.010\n>> Oh, who's counting?\n\n475\n00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.522\n>> All right.\n>> Exactly.\n\n476\n00:24:25.522 --> 00:24:26.035\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n477\n00:24:26.035 --> 00:24:26.693\n>> Not me!\n\n478\n00:24:26.693 --> 00:24:28.153\nAll right, so you'll see we have operating\n\n479\n00:24:28.153 --> 00:24:28.970\nsystems there.\n\n480\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.860\nAnd we're gonna go in, and\nwe're gonna go to the Boot Images.\n\n481\n00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.910\nAnd we're gonna start drilling in and\nusing some of the functionality here.\n\n482\n00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.670\nSo we're gonna go in to\nthe Boot Image area.\n\n483\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.060\nNow in the boot image area we have\ntwo boot images that are pre-loaded.\n\n484\n00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.990\nYou can see we're in the boot image area.\n\n485\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.580\nWe have an x64 and an x86 boot image.\n\n486\n00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.370\nThese are the WinPE images that\nare stock that are loaded.\n\n487\n00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.550\nThat are gonna come that\nwe can then leverage and\n\n488\n00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.540\nuse to create the initial\nboot environment to connect,\n\n489\n00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.470\nand then eventually download\na full operating system.\n\n490\n00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:02.490\nSo these come stocked with the software\nwhere you install SCCM those we there,\n\n491\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.590\nMicrosoft provides them.\n\n492\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.160\nYou don't have to download them or\nintegrate them, they are already provided.\n\n493\n00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.080\nSo, if you wondering where to they\ncome from, they're already there,\n\n494\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.832\nwe don't have to mess around with them,\nor do anything with them.\n\n495\n00:25:12.832 --> 00:25:17.070\nAll right, so we are going to ahead and\nwe are going to modify the X64 one because\n\n496\n00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:22.670\nthat's the one we're going to be using\nto do our windows 8.1 deployment.\n\n497\n00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.120\nSo we're going to do that, we're\ngoing to go in and we are going to go\n\n498\n00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.000\nto properties, and we're going to take\na look and go to the customization tab.\n\n499\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.190\nSo we're going to bring that up,\ntakes just a second to load.\n\n500\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:37.530\nAnd among the many tabs we have here,\nwe will go to customization.\n\n501\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.520\nI'm just going to zero in on that\none before I zoom so you can see it,\n\n502\n00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.930\nand you'll see we have\na whole bunch of tabs.\n\n503\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.930\nWe're going to enable the win\nPE pre-start command, and\n\n504\n00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.300\nor, various things like command support,\ntesting only.\n\n505\n00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.205\nThey're available here, so\nwe're going to go in on this one.\n\n506\n00:25:53.205 --> 00:25:57.570\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nclick and enable the pre-start command,\n\n507\n00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.380\ncuz we're gonna go ahead and\nput in a command line and\n\n508\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.840\nspecify what's that gonna be.\n\n509\n00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.110\nAnd so our command is gonna\nbe the following, do CMD\n\n510\n00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:10.830\nspace forward slash C for\ncommand, and set UDA.\n\n511\n00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:13.900\nDot.\nWas that a dot?\n\n512\n00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.000\nNo, that was a comma I think.\n\n513\n00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.230\nSet uda.hta, all right?\n\n514\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.070\nAnd so we're gonna do this.\n\n515\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.460\nThis is a custom file that's not included,\nbut\n\n516\n00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.050\nis just being used in this particular lab.\n\n517\n00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.190\nYou'd have to write this file or\nbe able to go out and grab it.\n\n518\n00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:31.290\nWhat this does basically is we\nspecify any prestar command\n\n519\n00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.210\nprocesses that we want inside this file.\n\n520\n00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.996\nSo if we wanna setup and\nuse pre-start commands and\n\n521\n00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:43.909\nspecify them we'd have to go in and create\na file called setuda.hta and use it.\n\n522\n00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:46.432\nThen we could use it and\npopulate what we want in there, so\n\n523\n00:26:46.432 --> 00:26:49.166\nwe're gonna use that just to be\nable to get some things done but\n\n524\n00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:52.237\nwe're just throwing this in as\na little extra, added bonus for you.\n\n525\n00:26:52.237 --> 00:26:54.655\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you will, so we're gonna do that.\n\n526\n00:26:54.655 --> 00:26:57.550\nAnd then we're gonna include files for\nthe pre-start command.\n\n527\n00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.120\nSo we're gonna check that off.\n\n528\n00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.750\nGo to browse to get to our source\ndirectory, and we're gonna put this in.\n\n529\n00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:09.270\nThis is going to be a UNC,\nso we're going to do primary\n\n530\n00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:17.600\none and then lab files and\nthen we've got OSD.\n\n531\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.740\nLet's narrow that down just a bit,\nOSD files.\n\n532\n00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:27.130\nAnd then in there we've got OSD pre-start.\n\n533\n00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.550\nSo we're going to do that,\nput that path in right there, and\n\n534\n00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:35.910\nthen we're gonna select that folder,\nthat's gonna go out to that folder.\n\n535\n00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.010\nAnd we've set up the preference or rather,\nthe prestart command references for\n\n536\n00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.460\nus in the HDA file.\n\n537\n00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.970\nAnd we have all that information,\n\n538\n00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:46.980\nwhatever we need, in that other\nfolder that we just went and grabbed.\n\n539\n00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.160\nNow we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ngo to the optional components tab, so\n\n540\n00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.170\nlet's go back to optional components.\n\n541\n00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.180\nWe'll just zoom in so\nyou could see where that is.\n\n542\n00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.110\nThat was right behind customizations.\n\n543\n00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.360\nJust brought that up.\n\n544\n00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:04.460\nSo optional components here, and\nwhat we'll see is that we have\n\n545\n00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:09.930\nalready a bunch of components, scripting,\nstartup, networking, script, etc..\n\n546\n00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.920\nAll this different stuff is there for\nWIN PE.\n\n547\n00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.570\nWhat we're gonna do is\nadd in a new components.\n\n548\n00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:20.910\nWe're gonna click on new here, and\nnotice all of the options we have.\n\n549\n00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:26.010\nWe have Windows PowerShell,\nDISM Commandments, using for\n\n550\n00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:31.490\nimaging, we have the .net support there,\nwe've got storage, file management.\n\n551\n00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:35.340\nAll sorts of stuff is available\nto us within the WinPE format,\n\n552\n00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.530\nwe just have to add them in.\n\n553\n00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.270\nRemember when we added in classes and\n\n554\n00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.390\nwe extended the hardware capabilities for\ninventory?\n\n555\n00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.150\nIt's kind of like that.\n\n556\n00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.260\nWe're bringing on new functions,\nin fact compiling them in.\n\n557\n00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.400\nAnd we are gonna choose this one here.\n\n558\n00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:53.690\nSo we want to go ahead select,\nwhat do they want, Windows HTML 1PHTE.\n\n559\n00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.380\nOr HDA rather, which right down here.\n\n560\n00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.898\nWe are going to go ahead and\ncheck that one off.\n\n561\n00:28:57.898 --> 00:29:02.470\nAnd then we're gonna click okay.\n\n562\n00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:07.990\nSo we got that additional one in there,\nand then once we've done that\n\n563\n00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:11.600\nwe are going to have all of that.\n\n564\n00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.390\nWe're going to click okay.\n\n565\n00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.380\nJust making sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n566\n00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.760\nHave a little dialogue\nbox that pops up there.\n\n567\n00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.140\nMade a few changes.\n\n568\n00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.840\nDo we want to go ahead and\ndo we want to update\n\n569\n00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.440\nthe distribution points with\nthe new version of this package?\n\n570\n00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.030\nSo it's actually going to\nallow us to do that right now.\n\n571\n00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.190\nSo you know we've talked before about,\nhey, are we deploying?\n\n572\n00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.890\nAre we distributing?\n\n573\n00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:29.950\nAre we updating?\n\n574\n00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.690\nSo this is going to force us to go out and\n\n575\n00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:35.030\nupdate that package that's sitting\nout there because we made changes.\n\n576\n00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.180\nWe're gonna click yes.\n\n577\n00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:42.540\nAnd automatically we go right into the\nupdate distribution points wizard, right?\n\n578\n00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.830\nSo we didn't even have to toggle that,\nwe didn't even have to select it.\n\n579\n00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.320\nWe went ahead and\nwe just get thrown right in there.\n\n580\n00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.950\nSo where to click next.\n\n581\n00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.250\nRemember, we already know what our\ndistribution point is, no big deal.\n\n582\n00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:54.190\nSo we're gonna watch that.\n\n583\n00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.740\nTakes a couple of minutes.\n\n584\n00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.450\nYeah, two, three minutes or so.\n\n585\n00:29:58.450 --> 00:29:59.440\nWe're already at 28%.\n\n586\n00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.080\nIt's not gonna take too long.\n\n587\n00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.940\nSo we'll let that cook for just a minute.\n\n588\n00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.420\nAs soon as that is done, we're then\ngonna go ahead, and we are going\n\n589\n00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.050\nto be able to think about now getting\nstarted, or we will in just a minute,\n\n590\n00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.120\ndistributing boot images to\nthe distribution point, right?\n\n591\n00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.750\nSo now that we're actually updating\nall this, we've got this set up.\n\n592\n00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.960\nWe'll then be able to go in and\n\n593\n00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.490\ntake the next step in our journey here,\nand we'll take a look.\n\n594\n00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.680\nAnd we will then be able to start\nworking with this boot image, and\n\n595\n00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.660\nthen once we've done this and\n\n596\n00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.850\ngot it all staged we're gonna start\ncapturing a reference computer.\n\n597\n00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.680\nSo what we're gonna do is go into\nthe Windows 8 machine, Windows 8.1\n\n598\n00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.240\nmachine rather, and we're gonna start\nusing that and capture that image.\n\n599\n00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.690\nAnd use that and\nmodify that image to become the basis for\n\n600\n00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.070\nwhat we actually want to throw.\n\n601\n00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.160\nSo that's gonna be our next\nstop on the journey here.\n\n602\n00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.130\nSo we're at about 42%.\n\n603\n00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:52.270\nWhat we're gonna do is give that\nanother moment to finish up.\n\n604\n00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.850\nBecause as I said, remember,\nwe have to be patient in this environment.\n\n605\n00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.980\nIt will take a certain amount\nof time to do certain things.\n\n606\n00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.290\nWe jump there, we're at 71% right now.\n\n607\n00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.680\nSo it's moving along fairly quickly.\n\n608\n00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.990\nIt does pause at certain places.\n\n609\n00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.840\nDoes a few things, and picks up again,\nand jumps dramatically.\n\n610\n00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.130\nSo, expect that behavior\nwhen using the lab.\n\n611\n00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.710\nYou know, that's something\nthat we will normally see.\n\n612\n00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.980\nWe will see in the real world,\nby the way, if we're doing this as well.\n\n613\n00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.390\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n614\n00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.470\nAll right, so once we're done.\n\n615\n00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.038\nWe're getting close.\n\n616\n00:31:19.038 --> 00:31:20.957\nWe're at 70 odd percent.\n\n617\n00:31:20.957 --> 00:31:22.070\nWe're gonna go back in and\nwe're gonna take a look.\n\n618\n00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.880\nThere we are, we're done.\n\n619\n00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.160\nWe're going to take a look\nat our data sources tab.\n\n620\n00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.640\nSo let's just hit close here.\n\n621\n00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.120\nWe'll get ahead, or\nrather let that close out.\n\n622\n00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.270\nWe are going to go back in, and\nwe are going back to our boot image x64,\n\n623\n00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.210\ngoing back to our properties and\ngo to a different tab.\n\n624\n00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:38.040\nThis time we are going to\ngo to our data source tabs.\n\n625\n00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.270\nLet me just go in and grab that.\n\n626\n00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.580\nZoom in there for you real quick so\nyou can see that.\n\n627\n00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.370\nThere is our data source tab, we have\nour image path there, as you can see.\n\n628\n00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.090\nImage index,\ngot all the information we need there.\n\n629\n00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:53.230\nAnd so what we are going to do there\nIs really just show you, right,\n\n630\n00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.040\nquickly, what it is that we've set up.\n\n631\n00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.445\nWe've set up that boot image.\n\n632\n00:31:56.445 --> 00:31:59.581\nIt's called boot.wim, by the way,\njust so you know what it is.\n\n633\n00:31:59.581 --> 00:32:03.343\nDo you guys know what the .wim file\nextension stands for, by the way?\n\n634\n00:32:03.343 --> 00:32:04.828\nWindows image.\n\n635\n00:32:04.828 --> 00:32:05.419\n>> Windows image.\n\n636\n00:32:05.419 --> 00:32:06.010\n>> Woo hoo.\n\n637\n00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.629\n>> Absolutely correct.\n\n638\n00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:07.590\nYou got that one.\n\n639\n00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.390\nThat was awesome.\n\n640\n00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.460\n>> All right so we've got that out there,\nwe see the image baff, we've got all that.\n\n641\n00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:18.010\nWhat we're gonna do is go out and\ntake a look at, what do I need to do here?\n\n642\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.055\nOh yes, distribute content.\n\n643\n00:32:19.055 --> 00:32:23.149\nAll right, so we're gonna hit Cancel here,\nget out of this, and\n\n644\n00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:25.613\nwhat we're gonna do is the following.\n\n645\n00:32:25.613 --> 00:32:28.818\nWe are going to select both boot images.\n\n646\n00:32:28.818 --> 00:32:33.835\nWe just click,and we're gonna select both\nand then we're gonna distribute both out,\n\n647\n00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:37.510\nthrough the distribution content\nwizard distribute both out.\n\n648\n00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.500\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ndistribute content.\n\n649\n00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.440\nWe did just update the one.\n\n650\n00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.910\nNow we're gonna distribute both out so\nthey're actually staged and ready to go.\n\n651\n00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.770\nSo we're gonna distribute those,\nclick Next.\n\n652\n00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:46.620\nWe've done this before.\n\n653\n00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.800\nThis is real simple.\n\n654\n00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.360\nAnd real quick,\nwe'll do Distribution Point here.\n\n655\n00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.940\nGonna add in our Distribution Point.\n\n656\n00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.970\nLet's hit that.\n\n657\n00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.435\nClick Primary, click OK,\nand then click Next.\n\n658\n00:32:56.435 --> 00:32:58.110\nLet's click Next there.\n\n659\n00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.450\nLet that go, do its thing, hit Close.\n\n660\n00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.725\nAnd we've got those set up.\n\n661\n00:33:01.725 --> 00:33:02.880\nAll right.\nSo, we've got all that.\n\n662\n00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.400\nAnd once we're done with that, we can take\na look at the monitoring workspace and\n\n663\n00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.480\nget a sense of what's happening with that.\n\n664\n00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.420\nIf we choose to, we'll see down here, for\n\n665\n00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.700\ninstance, that we have\none that's in progress.\n\n666\n00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.440\nAnd if we wait long enough and update\nthat, it takes usually about three or\n\n667\n00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.750\nfour minutes, it will show up and\neventually go green.\n\n668\n00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.540\nRight, so\nwe're not gonna wait around for that.\n\n669\n00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.480\nWe will see that, but it will happen\nas part of the other stuff we're doing,\n\n670\n00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.220\nit will just happen behind the scenes.\n\n671\n00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.296\nAll right so now what we're gonna do\nis we're going to go in and we're\n\n672\n00:33:33.296 --> 00:33:37.990\ngoing to set up a task sequence that's\ngoing to do a capture for us, right?\n\n673\n00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.227\nSo we're going to do a task sequence.\n\n674\n00:33:40.227 --> 00:33:43.079\nSo we're going to come over\nhere to task sequences.\n\n675\n00:33:43.079 --> 00:33:46.369\nScroll down and just zoom in so\nyou can see that right there.\n\n676\n00:33:46.369 --> 00:33:50.340\nAnd then, what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to come over here, we're going to\n\n677\n00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.930\nright click, and we're going to\ncreate a task sequence media item.\n\n678\n00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.140\nI'm gonna zoom in so\nyou can see the difference here.\n\n679\n00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.700\nWe have two options, Create Task Sequence,\nCreate Task Sequence Media.\n\n680\n00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.810\nThe Task Sequence Media creation\nitem is actually going in and\n\n681\n00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.340\ncapturing the reference media.\n\n682\n00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.500\nThe Task Sequence is what we do to\nsequence out all the actions we want\n\n683\n00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.610\non the media once we have it.\n\n684\n00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.230\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nengage in this activity now.\n\n685\n00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.990\nSo create task sequence media.\n\n686\n00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.919\nWe're gonna click there.\n\n687\n00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:16.030\nIt takes just a second.\n\n688\n00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:19.665\nWe have to specify the type\nof media that we want to use.\n\n689\n00:34:19.665 --> 00:34:21.172\nDo we want to do stand alone?\n\n690\n00:34:21.172 --> 00:34:24.170\nDo we want to do Bootable,\nCapture Media, or Prestaged?\n\n691\n00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.730\nSo we have different options.\n\n692\n00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:34.120\nWe're gonna go ahead and we are going\nto do the, what do we want there?\n\n693\n00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.000\nFour different types that can be created.\n\n694\n00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.650\nClick capture media.\n\n695\n00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:38.250\nI'm just making sure I\nchoose the right one.\n\n696\n00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.340\nSo we're going to do capture media.\n\n697\n00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.540\nSo we're going to choose capture media and\nwhat I'll do is just quickly zoom in so\n\n698\n00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.350\nyou can see this.\n\n699\n00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.220\nCapture media is used to\ncapture an OS deployment image\n\n700\n00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.560\nfrom a reference computer.\n\n701\n00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.950\nWe're going to in and capture that\nfrom that Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n702\n00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:53.440\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click next.\n\n703\n00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.340\nAnd then we have to specify\nhere whether or not, or\n\n704\n00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.450\nwhere I should say We're gonna\nget this from, the media file.\n\n705\n00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.625\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click browse under media file.\n\n706\n00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:07.030\nNow we're gonna type in the path here.\n\n707\n00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.200\nSee colon, what path do we have,\n\n708\n00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.255\nmy capture iso is what\nthey want us to call it.\n\n709\n00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:11.959\nOkay.\n\n710\n00:35:11.959 --> 00:35:14.320\nMycapture.iso.\n\n711\n00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.080\nSo we'll do actually just mycapture,\nso it's gonna be, yep, .iso.\n\n712\n00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.640\nOkay, got that, and let me just make sure\nI spelled that correctly, mycapture.iso.\n\n713\n00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.030\nOkay, good, so we've got that.\n\n714\n00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.320\nWe'll just go ahead,\nput that in there, hit save.\n\n715\n00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.270\nAnd then click next.\n\n716\n00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:33.320\nThen we have our boot image.\n\n717\n00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.370\nWe're going to select our boot image and\nbring it in.\n\n718\n00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.230\nSo we're going to browse\nto go grab our boot image.\n\n719\n00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.230\nWe have two boot images, X64 and X86.\n\n720\n00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.920\nWe're going to select the X64 boot image.\n\n721\n00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.390\nWe're going to click OK.\n\n722\n00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:48.350\nGrab that one, and\n\n723\n00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:53.620\nthen we are going to, Browse for\nthe distribution point.\n\n724\n00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.810\nJust remember,\nwe have to go get it from where it is.\n\n725\n00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.410\nIt's at the distribution point,\nso we're gonna go grab that.\n\n726\n00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:59.850\nGonna click OK there.\n\n727\n00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.000\nSpecify what we want, hit next.\n\n728\n00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.250\nEffectively, next again, just to let\nthat start working pretty quick.\n\n729\n00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:08.372\nWait for that to finish.\n\n730\n00:36:10.664 --> 00:36:13.240\nAll right, there we go, starting to work.\n\n731\n00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.840\nProcessing, processing, processing.\n\n732\n00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.690\nAll right, so\n[COUGH] soon as that does finish up,\n\n733\n00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:24.570\nwhat we'll then be able to do,\nand we'll see that run through,\n\n734\n00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.570\nis we'll be able to prepare the client for\nimage capture.\n\n735\n00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:31.180\nSo we'll be able to go in and\nswitch over to the client.\n\n736\n00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.050\nAnd then the client will\nbe the Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n737\n00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:39.430\nWe'll be able to switch over there, and\nwe will be able to take a look at that.\n\n738\n00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.550\nAnd we're gonna do that right now.\n\n739\n00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.630\nWe just finished up capture, or\nsetting up the media for capture, so\n\n740\n00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.640\nwe're just gonna close out of that.\n\n741\n00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:50.815\nAnd then what we'll do is we'll come over\nhere, gonna switch over to our client,\n\n742\n00:36:50.815 --> 00:36:56.365\nso I'm just switching over to our Windows\n8.1 machine, and what we're gonna do is,\n\n743\n00:36:56.365 --> 00:37:01.540\nwe're going to come in here, and we're\ngonna go over here, just scroll down just\n\n744\n00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:07.492\na wee bit, and do it right here,\ntype in System.\n\n745\n00:37:07.492 --> 00:37:11.960\nJust so that we can get to what we\nneed and we are gonna go in and\n\n746\n00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.110\nwe are going to change our settings.\n\n747\n00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.340\nSo let's go in here and go to system and\n\n748\n00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.910\nlet's go in here.\n\n749\n00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:30.000\nAnd let's go into\nAdvanced System Settings.\n\n750\n00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.890\nSystem Properties,\njust drag that over here.\n\n751\n00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:37.240\nNow what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna go into the computer name tab.\n\n752\n00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.860\nAnd then we're gonna go to our change\ncomputer name and/or domain, and\n\n753\n00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.220\nclick change.\n\n754\n00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.230\nAnd we're in Workgroup right now.\n\n755\n00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.450\nWe're gonna make sure we're in work group.\n\n756\n00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:48.500\nLet me just check that.\n\n757\n00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.430\nLooks like we are there.\n\n758\n00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.260\nOkay.\nMake sure we got that.\n\n759\n00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:53.880\nThat's all good.\n\n760\n00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.420\nThat's all good.\n\n761\n00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.050\nThat's all good.\n\n762\n00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:58.480\nAnd yeah, so, we're in work group.\n\n763\n00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.130\nThat's all okay.\n\n764\n00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:01.680\nAnd system properties.\n\n765\n00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.588\nNo problem.\n\n766\n00:38:02.588 --> 00:38:06.930\nAnd then okay.\n\n767\n00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.510\nAnd just make sure we don't wanna\nchange the name on that either.\n\n768\n00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:12.190\nAnd no, we don't.\n\n769\n00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.835\nAll right, good.\nSo we're in the work group.\n\n770\n00:38:13.835 --> 00:38:16.370\nGot all that, just checking\nto make sure everything looks\n\n771\n00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:19.490\ngood because we're not gonna want\nimages as a member of the domain.\n\n772\n00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:22.470\nSo we have to check and\nmake sure that we are in a work group and\n\n773\n00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.960\nthat we can obviously join it\nto the domain when we get done.\n\n774\n00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.890\nAll right, so, we're gonna log on, or\nexcuse me, we're already logged on,\n\n775\n00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:31.390\nwe're gonna go ahead and insert\nthe disk here is what we need to do.\n\n776\n00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:34.040\nAnd so, let me see.\n\n777\n00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:38.160\nWe do insert disk, and do my capture.\n\n778\n00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.706\nOkay, so, let's do the following.\n\n779\n00:38:46.831 --> 00:38:49.456\nNavigate over to here, go there.\n\n780\n00:38:49.456 --> 00:38:55.380\nAnd, what\n\n781\n00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.160\nwe are going to do is Insert this.\n\n782\n00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:00.810\nOh, you know what?\n\n783\n00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.320\nI was wrong, it is over there.\n\n784\n00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.170\nHold on just half a second, yeah.\n\n785\n00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:09.704\nBut it should be,\nMycapture.iso not updates.iso.\n\n786\n00:39:09.704 --> 00:39:12.010\nIt's not showing up.\n\n787\n00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.320\nThat should be that one we created huh?\n\n788\n00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.670\nRight.\nIt's suppose to show up there,\n\n789\n00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.420\nwe have figured out our\nlittle conundrum here.\n\n790\n00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:30.570\nSo the ISO mount point was just mislabeled\nbased on what is in the lab guide,\n\n791\n00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:31.370\nversus what you see.\n\n792\n00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:33.650\nNow, this is a good point just\nin case this happens to you,\n\n793\n00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:35.140\nI don't know that it will.\n\n794\n00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.790\nBut apparently in the Microsoft lab guide,\nyou're told to look specifically,\n\n795\n00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:47.140\nwhen you mount it, as to look for\nrather, mycapture.iso.\n\n796\n00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.270\nIt is not coming up as my\ncapture.iso on the screen.\n\n797\n00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:54.519\nWhen you go in to choose the mount\npoint and the picker it is coming up as\n\n798\n00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:59.592\nupdates.iso, but the problem is there is\nthree updates.iso all in a row there.\n\n799\n00:39:59.592 --> 00:40:02.610\nNone of them are labeled and tell you\nwhat it is, so you have to actually mount\n\n800\n00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.413\nthem and figure out, which is what\nwe were just doing to figure it out.\n\n801\n00:40:05.413 --> 00:40:09.193\nFigure out which one it actually is so\nyou are gonna have to go through and\n\n802\n00:40:09.193 --> 00:40:10.930\njust play around with that.\n\n803\n00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:15.570\nI believe we had chose and\nindeed are using the second of the three.\n\n804\n00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:16.500\nYou can see they're all called\n\n805\n00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.243\nthe same thing-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n806\n00:40:17.243 --> 00:40:18.976\n>> In there, cuz that's does make\n\n807\n00:40:18.976 --> 00:40:22.645\nabsolutely perfect sense instead\nof calling it what you're told.\n\n808\n00:40:22.645 --> 00:40:25.460\nIt would be in the [LAUGH] lab guide.\n\n809\n00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.280\nSo we're mounting that.\n\n810\n00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.060\nWe did figure it out.\n\n811\n00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.490\nIt just took a couple minutes for\nus to work through the logic and\n\n812\n00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.000\nto figure out which of those\nwould be the one we need.\n\n813\n00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.330\nSo we've done that, we then have\njust basically right-clicked and\n\n814\n00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:36.690\nchose autoplay.\n\n815\n00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.775\nAnd then we get the prompt to run TSMBA,\nor\n\n816\n00:40:39.775 --> 00:40:44.130\nTSMBAutorun.exe which is gonna\nactually then launch, for\n\n817\n00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:48.270\nus, the wizard that's gonna\nactually run and do the capture.\n\n818\n00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.200\nSo we're gonna just give\nthat a second to come up.\n\n819\n00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:56.604\nAnd as soon as that does, we will\nthen have the Image Capture Wizard,\n\n820\n00:40:56.604 --> 00:41:00.072\na welcome screen come up,\nyou could see that right there, so\n\n821\n00:41:00.072 --> 00:41:02.190\nwe're gonna be able to run that now.\n\n822\n00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:06.422\nRemember, what we're doing is\neffectively running this software on\n\n823\n00:41:06.422 --> 00:41:11.120\nthe existing machine, loaded up,\ninstalled, ready to go, logged on.\n\n824\n00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.080\nThis is effect we're gonna go through and\nrun the system, shut it down,\n\n825\n00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.430\ncapture an image.\n\n826\n00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:19.260\nSo it's almost like\nsyspreping in that respect,\n\n827\n00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.010\nif you want to think of it that way.\n\n828\n00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.460\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're going to click Next, here.\n\n829\n00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.350\nLet's specify our destination.\n\n830\n00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:29.340\nWhere do we want to ultimately put\nthe file that we're gonna capture.\n\n831\n00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.632\nSo we have to specify\nwhere that's gonna go.\n\n832\n00:41:31.632 --> 00:41:35.200\nWe're gonna put that out on our machine,\nour site server.\n\n833\n00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.683\nSo we're gonna go back to primary one,\n\n834\n00:41:40.683 --> 00:41:46.663\nand on primary one, gonna go to lab files,\n\n835\n00:41:46.663 --> 00:41:52.646\nwhere we already have that setup and then,\n\n836\n00:41:52.646 --> 00:41:58.490\nOSD files and then MyWindows8.1win.\n\n837\n00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:01.128\nSo that part,\nyou can call anything you would like.\n\n838\n00:42:01.128 --> 00:42:08.520\nMy Windows 8.1 or 81, rather, .wim.\n\n839\n00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.190\nI would recommend that you include the\nname of the operating system in there, so\n\n840\n00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.640\nyou know what the image is,\nbut that's gonna be up to you.\n\n841\n00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.645\nBut you can see the path there,\n\n842\n00:42:16.645 --> 00:42:20.310\nmywindows81.wim, the important part\nis that it has the .wim extension\n\n843\n00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.660\non the back end of it cuz\nthat's really what's important.\n\n844\n00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:29.700\nFor the account name there, we're gonna\ndo our domain which is configmgrdom,\n\n845\n00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.781\nso configmgrdom and\n\n846\n00:42:33.781 --> 00:42:38.600\nthen /administrator.\n\n847\n00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:43.460\nAnd then, we're going to do our password,\nwhich is password lowercase.\n\n848\n00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:47.080\nI love the complexity and the richness of\nthose passwords, that is just so awesome.\n\n849\n00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.020\n>> All right.\n\n850\n00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.060\n>> And created by, yeah,\nwe'll put in whatever.\n\n851\n00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.640\nYou can put in your name there,\nit doesn't really matter what you put in.\n\n852\n00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:58.470\nAnd then we are going to-\n>> So the slash on that.\n\n853\n00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:03.740\nI was just making sure\nLinux Windows now that you've-\n\n854\n00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:04.720\n>> No back slash.\n\n855\n00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.113\n>> I thought you might have,\noh you might have said forward slash and\n\n856\n00:43:07.113 --> 00:43:07.860\ntyped a back slash.\n\n857\n00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:10.662\nYep, there we go, okay, just making sure.\n\n858\n00:43:10.662 --> 00:43:13.670\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n859\n00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:14.648\n>> Thank you for nothing.\n\n860\n00:43:14.648 --> 00:43:16.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, it's good to check.\n\n861\n00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:17.790\nMike's right to call me out on that.\n\n862\n00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.270\nI very well might have when\nI was just bumbling along.\n\n863\n00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.640\nI told you I talk to myself,\nI never pay attention to what I say.\n\n864\n00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.470\n>> I like listening to it.\n\n865\n00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:25.680\n>> All right, it's just a matter of\npaying attention to the details.\n\n866\n00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.130\nAll right, so you can see as we go here,\nwe are now running the prepare operating\n\n867\n00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:33.320\nsystem, and remember I told you,\nthis is effectively gonna do sysprep.\n\n868\n00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.450\nWhat does that say right there?\n\n869\n00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.350\n>> Sysprep.\n\n870\n00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:36.970\n>> Sysprep command.\n\n871\n00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:37.480\n>> Nice.\n\n872\n00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.540\n>> Period, with authority.\n\n873\n00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.120\nSo we're gonna run sysprep,\nwe are gonna go through and\n\n874\n00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.750\neffectively blow out the box if you will.\n\n875\n00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.710\nThis process is gonna take\nover an hour to complete.\n\n876\n00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.650\nSo we are not gonna sit here and wait for\n\n877\n00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.150\nthat, we're just gonna let you\nsee the beginning of that.\n\n878\n00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.270\nBut the idea is that we\neffectively are running that.\n\n879\n00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.140\nWe're gonna sysprep the box, shut it down,\nbit stream that image back up to\n\n880\n00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.850\nthe server, capture it with all\nthe bells and whistles and settings.\n\n881\n00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:07.100\nAnd then we're gonna ultimately be able\nto use that when we're ready to do\n\n882\n00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:07.680\na deployment.\n\n883\n00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.290\nSo this is the part you'll be doing.\n\n884\n00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:10.840\nYou'll obviously have to be patient and\nwait for that to run.\n\n885\n00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.944\nWhat we're gonna do is just leave\nthat running behind the scenes and\n\n886\n00:44:13.944 --> 00:44:16.240\nwe're gonna kick over to\nthe next part of our lab.\n\n887\n00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.180\nWe'll take a look at that from time to\ntime to see what's going on with that.\n\n888\n00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.670\nIt's gonna move back over\nto the primary server.\n\n889\n00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:24.940\nThat was me just messing around seeing if\nI could copy that file to get it working\n\n890\n00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.600\nbecause I like a good challenge,\nand so we fixed that.\n\n891\n00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.640\nSo we're gonna go back\nin now on the console.\n\n892\n00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.060\nWe're gonna go to the Administration\nworkspace here, and we're gonna go\n\n893\n00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.410\ninto Hierarchy Configuration and\ntake a look at our Boundaries here.\n\n894\n00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:42.510\nSo we're gonna go back in, take a look at\nour Boundaries and we'll see we have our\n\n895\n00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:46.602\nconfig manager site boundary, our default\nfirst site name boundary is there.\n\n896\n00:44:46.602 --> 00:44:49.448\nWe're gonna create another boundary here,\nwe've done this before.\n\n897\n00:44:49.448 --> 00:44:52.580\nSo we're gonna create a boundary,\nwe're gonna give this boundary a name,\n\n898\n00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.309\nthis will be our range for DHCP clients.\n\n899\n00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:00.870\nBecause, let me just finish typing,\nwhen we are doing this and\n\n900\n00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.870\nwe boot up to a PXE boot.\n\n901\n00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:05.830\nWe have to pull a DHCP\naddress in order to be able\n\n902\n00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:09.210\nto be associated with the site server,\nwe have to be in a range or\n\n903\n00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.320\nsite boundary that has a DHCP\nrange that will associate us.\n\n904\n00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.310\nSo we're gonna create that in order to\nmake this work, so we're gonna do that.\n\n905\n00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:18.760\nWe're gonna specify, instead of IP subnet,\n\n906\n00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.840\nwe are gonna specify a IP address range,\ncuz we need to set that up.\n\n907\n00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.409\nSo we're gonna choose IP address\nrange right down there at the bottom,\n\n908\n00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:29.940\nthat's gonna change.\n\n909\n00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:37.271\nWe're gonna put that in,\nthat is gonna be 192.168.3.200 and\n\n910\n00:45:37.271 --> 00:45:43.472\nthen 192.186.3.210,\njust gonna specify that.\n\n911\n00:45:43.472 --> 00:45:47.410\nGonna go ahead and\nwe are going to click OK.\n\n912\n00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:53.490\nAnd so\nnow we have our new boundary right there.\n\n913\n00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:56.260\nWe could just see it, right, we've\nadded it in, it's sitting right there.\n\n914\n00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:00.340\nAll right, so we're gonna obviously\nmake sure we have that selected, and\n\n915\n00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.675\nnow we are going to go ahead and\nwe're gonna click Add Selected Items.\n\n916\n00:46:03.675 --> 00:46:06.475\nAnd we're gonna choose\nadd selected items and\n\n917\n00:46:06.475 --> 00:46:09.145\nadd that into an existing boundary group.\n\n918\n00:46:09.145 --> 00:46:11.225\nWe hadn't really looked at\nthat behavior before but\n\n919\n00:46:11.225 --> 00:46:14.245\nyou'll see we can add the boundary\ninto a boundary group.\n\n920\n00:46:14.245 --> 00:46:15.725\nRemember boundary groups are important for\n\n921\n00:46:15.725 --> 00:46:18.725\nmanagement from an administration\nperspective easy use.\n\n922\n00:46:18.725 --> 00:46:21.780\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nadd that into an existing boundary group.\n\n923\n00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.010\nWe're gonna put that in to a boundary\ngroup that's already been created,\n\n924\n00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.590\nin other words.\n\n925\n00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.630\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click there.\n\n926\n00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:31.248\nWe have our boundary group and\nit's local clients in MCM.\n\n927\n00:46:31.248 --> 00:46:35.223\nSo, we're gonna choose that one, that's\nbeen put in there by Microsoft, or whoever\n\n928\n00:46:35.223 --> 00:46:39.370\nprogrammed the labs, in the real world,\nyou would have to create that, of course.\n\n929\n00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:40.300\nSo, we've put that in.\n\n930\n00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.802\nNow, what we're gonna do\nis go into our Start Menu >\n\n931\n00:46:46.802 --> 00:46:53.170\nAdministrative Tools >\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n932\n00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.010\nGonna go in, gonna open this up.\n\n933\n00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.300\nLet's just move this over here real quick,\nand\n\n934\n00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.220\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna create a brand new user.\n\n935\n00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.045\nWe're gonna do that on the user's.\n\n936\n00:47:02.045 --> 00:47:03.510\nWe're gonna right-click.\n\n937\n00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.840\nDo new,\nif I can get my mouse to cooperate.\n\n938\n00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:12.870\nNew user, and we are going to\nprovide the following information.\n\n939\n00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:15.530\nOur network access account\nis what we are creating.\n\n940\n00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:19.470\nThis account is gonna be\nan account that is used to able to\n\n941\n00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.520\ndo the installations and\naccess the system and everything.\n\n942\n00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.470\nAnd give us the permissions to do\nthe things we need to do effectively as\n\n943\n00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:28.830\na proxy behind the scenes.\n\n944\n00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:31.320\nSo we're gonna create this account,\nso we're gonna do that.\n\n945\n00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.110\nWe're going to do, oh,\nI did that in first name not full name.\n\n946\n00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:36.590\nLet me get that out of there.\n\n947\n00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.020\nAnd what we wanna do is the following.\n\n948\n00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:46.630\nYeah, actually just leave it there,\nthat's no big deal.\n\n949\n00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:51.030\nAll right, so what we need there is\nthe following for, that we need NAA,\n\n950\n00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:55.250\njust a short name, and then we're gonna\ngo ahead, we're gonna click Next.\n\n951\n00:47:55.250 --> 00:48:00.996\nAnd for password, we're gonna put in\nthe word password all lower case.\n\n952\n00:48:00.996 --> 00:48:06.376\nAnd we're gonna specify that user must\nnot change password on next log-on,\n\n953\n00:48:06.376 --> 00:48:08.371\nso we're not gonna do that.\n\n954\n00:48:08.371 --> 00:48:12.118\nAnd then we're gonna make user\ncannot change password and\n\n955\n00:48:12.118 --> 00:48:14.950\npassword never expires, those settings.\n\n956\n00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:16.690\nWe'll hit Next there.\n\n957\n00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:17.550\nAnd then we'll hit Finish.\n\n958\n00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:19.020\nWe'll get that user account created.\n\n959\n00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:23.900\nAll right, and then once we've done\nthat we're gonna go back in and\n\n960\n00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.570\nwe're gonna configure our site server and\n\n961\n00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:31.200\ndo a little work here on site\nconfiguration in the sites area.\n\n962\n00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.420\nWe're gonna go ahead.\n\n963\n00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.220\nAnd we are gonna go to the settings and\nconfigure site components.\n\n964\n00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:40.025\nRemember, I showed you this when\nwe did our software installation,\n\n965\n00:48:40.025 --> 00:48:43.005\nnot a software installation,\nrather our WSUS functionality.\n\n966\n00:48:43.005 --> 00:48:43.645\nWe went in, and\n\n967\n00:48:43.645 --> 00:48:46.305\nwhen we were troubleshooting I showed\nyou a little behind the scenes tour, and\n\n968\n00:48:46.305 --> 00:48:48.615\nI showed you how we can go and\nconfigure certain things.\n\n969\n00:48:48.615 --> 00:48:51.105\nSo, we're gonna go do that right now\nbecause one of the other site roles that\n\n970\n00:48:51.105 --> 00:48:54.489\nwas there was going to actually allow us.\n\n971\n00:48:56.667 --> 00:49:00.632\nAnd I'll just show you in this one,\nbecause of the constrained screen size,\n\n972\n00:49:00.632 --> 00:49:04.353\nwhere we just dont have as much real\nestate on top, sometimes that little\n\n973\n00:49:04.353 --> 00:49:08.684\nsetting configure site components hides\nbecause it gets compressed in the window,\n\n974\n00:49:08.684 --> 00:49:10.150\nso it's up under settings.\n\n975\n00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.830\nSo we see there's a whole\nbunch of stuff there.\n\n976\n00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.970\nIn the larger scheme where\nwe have more real estate,\n\n977\n00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.290\nbecause remember we changed the screen\nresolution and the other environment.\n\n978\n00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:19.650\nSo this way we could see it but\nit's just hiding there.\n\n979\n00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:20.830\nSo in case you go to look for it and\n\n980\n00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.250\ndon't see it,\nyou just have to go up under settings.\n\n981\n00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:27.170\nWe're gonna go there, but one of\nthe other site roles that we have here\n\n982\n00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.510\nthat we can play with is\nSoftware Distribution.\n\n983\n00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.600\nAnd so we have to go in and we have to\ntake a look at this cuz we need to set up\n\n984\n00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.640\nthe network account that we just created\non the Software Distribution item so\n\n985\n00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.600\nthat we can actually push the image out.\n\n986\n00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.800\nBecause the ISO image\n\n987\n00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.660\nis effectively distributed through the\nSoftware Distribution Site server role.\n\n988\n00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.630\nSo, we're gonna go to\nSoftware Distribution.\n\n989\n00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:47.760\nWe have our network access\naccount right there.\n\n990\n00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.070\nAnd, what we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna go ahead and\n\n991\n00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:52.410\nspecify the account we are going to use.\n\n992\n00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:55.050\nAnd, the one that we just created\nis the one that we'll put in here.\n\n993\n00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:56.800\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and specify.\n\n994\n00:49:58.625 --> 00:50:03.720\nClick new, and we will go ahead,\nand we will choose new account.\n\n995\n00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.730\nWe'll do Windows account.\n\n996\n00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:06.670\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nand we're gonna browse.\n\n997\n00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:07.850\nWe'll do Select User.\n\n998\n00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:11.580\nAnd then we're gonna do NAA, which is\nthe name of the account we just created.\n\n999\n00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.550\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n1000\n00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:14.820\nThat does come up.\n\n1001\n00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:18.410\nAnd you can see that does\nregister our account there.\n\n1002\n00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:20.386\nSo you can just see that just so you know.\n\n1003\n00:50:20.386 --> 00:50:24.250\nClick OK, oh darn, there we go.\n\n1004\n00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.310\nOkay, wait, I did come in.\n\n1005\n00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:26.960\nI thought I hadn't selected it for\na second.\n\n1006\n00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.720\nAll right, so we got that.\n\n1007\n00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.470\nWe're gonna put our password in there.\n\n1008\n00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.430\nLet's put in our password.\n\n1009\n00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.860\nLet's put in our password and match that.\n\n1010\n00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.510\nLet's just do a quick verify there.\n\n1011\n00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.220\nMake sure everything is good.\n\n1012\n00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:38.740\nAll right, so we've got all of that.\n\n1013\n00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:45.800\nAnd then, I'm going to type in the path\nto the share that we want to test.\n\n1014\n00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.880\nWe'll do primary one and what is that?\n\n1015\n00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.209\nLab files.\n\n1016\n00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:58.320\nAll right, test that connection,\nit tested successfully so\n\n1017\n00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:02.070\nwe know we can use that,\nclick okay and we're good there.\n\n1018\n00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:05.900\nAll right, so we'll click okay again,\nget that all set up, so\n\n1019\n00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:10.090\nnow we've configured the software\ndistribution point to be able to use\n\n1020\n00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:13.940\nthe network access account, which is then\ngonna set us up so we can push the image.\n\n1021\n00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.830\nAnd use the account that\nwe've just created.\n\n1022\n00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.070\nNow we're gonna deploy or\n\n1023\n00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:20.630\nget ready to deploy the operating\nsystem image to the client.\n\n1024\n00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.080\nBut let's check on our client first here.\n\n1025\n00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.140\nLet's just see what's going\non with our image capture.\n\n1026\n00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:29.770\nWhat we can see is we are now actually\ncapturing that reference image.\n\n1027\n00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:34.400\nAnd we're on the volume so\nwe're actually starting to run and\n\n1028\n00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.470\nstart to capture the hard drives and\nall the information about it.\n\n1029\n00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:40.190\nSo if we let this run long enough,\n\n1030\n00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.420\nwe'll see the whole thing\nwill ultimately complete.\n\n1031\n00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.490\nSo we'll just throw an eye\non that every so often.\n\n1032\n00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:47.610\nIt's not costing us anything to leave\nthat running because we're not paying for\n\n1033\n00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:48.745\nthe electricity so to speak.\n\n1034\n00:51:48.745 --> 00:51:51.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let that go and let it do its thing.\n\n1035\n00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.772\nAll right, so we're gonna go in,\n\n1036\n00:51:52.772 --> 00:51:55.281\nwe're gonna go to software\nlibrary in the workspace, here.\n\n1037\n00:51:56.691 --> 00:51:58.270\nAnd, we're gonna switch over.\n\n1038\n00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:00.140\nWe're gonna go to operating system images.\n\n1039\n00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.830\nSo, let's just click over there.\n\n1040\n00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:05.210\nWe do not have an operating system image\ncurrently, so we're gonna go in, and\n\n1041\n00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:06.400\nwe're gonna add one.\n\n1042\n00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.380\nThis is gonna allow us to add, right here,\n\n1043\n00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.220\nthe Operating System Image,\nwe can see that.\n\n1044\n00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.560\nSo we're gonna click and do this.\n\n1045\n00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.558\nAdd Operating System Image,\nwe're gonna go out to our path here and\n\n1046\n00:52:17.558 --> 00:52:19.463\ngo get our Windows 8.1 WIMP.\n\n1047\n00:52:19.463 --> 00:52:23.340\nSo we're gonna go do this and let me see.\n\n1048\n00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.640\nJust type in our pass, so let's do.\n\n1049\n00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.180\nWhat is that?\n\n1050\n00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:27.200\nIs that a primary one?\n\n1051\n00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:31.475\nAnd then lab files.\n\n1052\n00:52:31.475 --> 00:52:36.730\nAnd then OSD,\n\n1053\n00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:41.880\nand then we have Windows 8.1 WIMP.\n\n1054\n00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.920\nNow by the way will just zoom in here so\nyou can see this one second.\n\n1055\n00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:54.360\nRemember we said that we were going\nto capture right the mywindows81.wim?\n\n1056\n00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.230\nSee that it is already listed there\nbecause we're writing to it in real time\n\n1057\n00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:58.670\nremember from the other client.\n\n1058\n00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:59.650\nWe're doing the capture live.\n\n1059\n00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:01.570\nYou can see that it's already\nthere It's not complete yet\n\n1060\n00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:05.510\nbecause we saw the image capture\nmanager still running rather.\n\n1061\n00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:08.300\nBut you can see on the screen\nthat it's happening and\n\n1062\n00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.610\nthat file has already been created.\n\n1063\n00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.780\nWe're starting to write to it so\nwe can see it there.\n\n1064\n00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.320\nNow we could throw a monkey wrench in\nthings and do a Windows 7 deployment,\n\n1065\n00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:14.910\nthe Windows 7 wim.\n\n1066\n00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:17.020\nThat would really be,\nwe could troubleshoot through that,\n\n1067\n00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.411\nwe might actually be here all night.\n\n1068\n00:53:18.411 --> 00:53:19.095\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1069\n00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:21.688\n>> So we're not gonna do that but\nyou see we have Windows 7 in there.\n\n1070\n00:53:21.688 --> 00:53:24.110\nThe Windows 8.1 wim at\nthe bottom has been loaded.\n\n1071\n00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:27.770\nThat's a full-featured one that's\nalready set up so we can use that one\n\n1072\n00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:31.510\ninstead of having to wait an hour and\nwho knows how long to capture our own.\n\n1073\n00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:33.640\nSo the capture part,\nwhen you do this lab, is really just for\n\n1074\n00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.000\nyou to see how it starts.\n\n1075\n00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.840\nYou can leave it running like I did,\nbut the lab's probably gonna\n\n1076\n00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.360\ntime out before the capture finishes,\nand you could actually use it.\n\n1077\n00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.230\nSo they give you a second wim,\none that's already pre-loaded, so\n\n1078\n00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:45.340\nwe could actually use that one.\n\n1079\n00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.460\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1080\n00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:48.350\nWe're gonna go down and\nselect that one, but\n\n1081\n00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.550\nI did wanna show you that ours is there,\nit's important to know.\n\n1082\n00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:56.320\nSo we've got that one,\nwe'll go ahead, and what do we got?\n\n1083\n00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:04.200\nWindows 8.1, we'll do X64, enterprise\njust to tell everybody what that is.\n\n1084\n00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.330\nGo ahead and click next.\n\n1085\n00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:08.090\nHit next and then just let that run.\n\n1086\n00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:10.550\nAnd that doesn't take very\nlong to pull that in.\n\n1087\n00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:12.590\nSo we now have that sitting there.\n\n1088\n00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.640\nSo we have our operating system there and\nwe can go through.\n\n1089\n00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.690\nWe can see of course that it\nis sitting and ready to go.\n\n1090\n00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:22.030\nAll right so what we're gonna do now is\ndistribute the operating system out to\n\n1091\n00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:23.580\nthe distribution points.\n\n1092\n00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.160\nSo we're gonna right-click on that.\n\n1093\n00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.070\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ndistribute content.\n\n1094\n00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.920\nWe're gonna go ahead and\njust quickly zip that out there.\n\n1095\n00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.240\nSo, I'm just gonna quickly speed\nthrough adding the distribution point.\n\n1096\n00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.730\nYou've seen me do this a lot already so\n\n1097\n00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:37.790\nI'm not gonna spend too much\ntime narrating as I go.\n\n1098\n00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.645\nJust click next and\nget that distributed out.\n\n1099\n00:54:39.645 --> 00:54:42.580\nSo, we're gonna wait on that to\nwind up getting distributed.\n\n1100\n00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:47.670\nWe obviously have to make\nsure that it does show up.\n\n1101\n00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:54.050\nSo, what we're gonna do Here is\nwhere we're gonna look for that.\n\n1102\n00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:56.640\nWe're gonna wait and\nsee when that does show up.\n\n1103\n00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.720\nIn the meantime,\nwe just look at the content,\n\n1104\n00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.770\nwe can see the disk's information,\nsee the disk's configuration.\n\n1105\n00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:03.100\nOf course, I'm saying we can see it.\n\n1106\n00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.160\nI can see it just fine.\n\n1107\n00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.550\nYou guys are looking at it, going, what\nthe hell's that small thing on the window?\n\n1108\n00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.720\nCan't even see that.\n\n1109\n00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:11.620\nSo down here at the bottom, I'm just\nclicking on the Disk Configuration tab.\n\n1110\n00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.280\nWe can see the configuration\nof the disks in the image.\n\n1111\n00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:19.040\nWe do have the details area\nwhere we can zoom in and\n\n1112\n00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:25.700\nwe are seeing the details in Windows\nEnglish X64 architecture, the size, etc.\n\n1113\n00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.310\nRight?\nSo, we have all that.\n\n1114\n00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:30.100\n>> So it's actually able to read that\nWIN file and see what's inside it.\n\n1115\n00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.410\n>> Absolutely, it is.\n\n1116\n00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.530\nWe can see right now\nthat it is in process, so\n\n1117\n00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:36.320\nit is actually being distributed out.\n\n1118\n00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.700\nWe're just waiting on that to turn green.\n\n1119\n00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.610\nSo, we'll give that a minute or so.\n\n1120\n00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:42.888\nYou can ponder the beautiful yellow,\nmustardy, brownish color there.\n\n1121\n00:55:42.888 --> 00:55:46.819\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And hopefully, that does wonders for\n\n1122\n00:55:46.819 --> 00:55:50.030\nyour persona, and your mood, if you will.\n\n1123\n00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:52.380\nBut as soon as we get this done,\nas soon as this does change.\n\n1124\n00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:54.700\nAnd I'll zoom back out in a minute,\nwe'll see if it's changed.\n\n1125\n00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.520\nOnce we get this done,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n1126\n00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.740\ncreate a task sequence to\nactually drive the deployment.\n\n1127\n00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.064\nSo we're gonna start setting up and\nsequencing.\n\n1128\n00:56:01.064 --> 00:56:03.456\nWe actually can do that\nwhile we're waiting.\n\n1129\n00:56:03.456 --> 00:56:04.766\nBut let's just do a quick refresh.\n\n1130\n00:56:04.766 --> 00:56:06.599\nLet's see if maybe it's already done.\n\n1131\n00:56:06.599 --> 00:56:08.467\nIf not, we can certainly get it done.\n\n1132\n00:56:08.467 --> 00:56:09.267\nYeah, it's still working.\n\n1133\n00:56:09.267 --> 00:56:11.920\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do a task\nsequence in the meantime, no big deal.\n\n1134\n00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:12.450\nCome back to that.\n\n1135\n00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:14.205\nSo we'll go to the task\nsequence area here.\n\n1136\n00:56:14.205 --> 00:56:16.083\nAnd in the task sequence area,\n\n1137\n00:56:16.083 --> 00:56:19.705\nremember we did the task\nsequence media capture last time.\n\n1138\n00:56:19.705 --> 00:56:23.430\nThis time now, we're gonna go ahead and\nactually create a task sequence.\n\n1139\n00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:26.110\nThis is gonna be the sequence set of steps\n\n1140\n00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:29.230\nthat we wanna use to actually\nautomate deployment.\n\n1141\n00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:31.050\nIf you've ever done,\nI know you have probably done them,\n\n1142\n00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:35.990\nI don't know if everybody else out\nthere has, but if you've ever done\n\n1143\n00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:39.800\nany automation of system installation\nwith answer files on a 10.txt,\n\n1144\n00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.850\nyou wouldn't go all the way\nback to the ris stage.\n\n1145\n00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:44.800\nRemember good old remote install services?\n\n1146\n00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.420\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1147\n00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:49.521\n>> Right, now WDS of course more recently,\nbut we automate the process through\n\n1148\n00:56:49.521 --> 00:56:53.372\nbasically going through an answer file,\nand making a bunch of choices,\n\n1149\n00:56:53.372 --> 00:56:56.716\nsaving them off, and\nthen using that to drive the deployment so\n\n1150\n00:56:56.716 --> 00:57:00.346\nwe don't have to sit there and\nhit Next, Next, Next on the screen.\n\n1151\n00:57:00.346 --> 00:57:02.012\nWe're doing something like that here,\n\n1152\n00:57:02.012 --> 00:57:05.295\nbut it's not gonna look quite like the old\nanswer files we've created before,\n\n1153\n00:57:05.295 --> 00:57:07.647\nbecause this is gonna be a point and\nclick interface, and\n\n1154\n00:57:07.647 --> 00:57:10.708\nthe task sequencer that we can move\nthings around and make selections on.\n\n1155\n00:57:10.708 --> 00:57:13.468\nBut we'll save that off when we're done,\nand then use that sequence to actually\n\n1156\n00:57:13.468 --> 00:57:16.052\ndrive deployment, so\nthat's what we're gonna take a look at.\n\n1157\n00:57:16.052 --> 00:57:17.372\nSo we've got some options here.\n\n1158\n00:57:17.372 --> 00:57:21.952\nWe can install an existing image package,\nbuild and create and capture a reference\n\n1159\n00:57:21.952 --> 00:57:26.072\nimage, install an existing image,\nand/or create a new custom task sequence.\n\n1160\n00:57:26.072 --> 00:57:29.009\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nand what we're gonna do is\n\n1161\n00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:34.530\nwe are going to install an existing\nimage package, because we are gonna\n\n1162\n00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:37.570\nsequence out one that is going to\nassume that we already have that.\n\n1163\n00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:38.940\nSo we're going to click Next.\n\n1164\n00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:40.820\nWe're gonna give this a name.\n\n1165\n00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:48.640\nWe'll go ahead and we'll call this,\nWindows 8.1 x64 Enterprise.\n\n1166\n00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.970\nThat names it what our image is.\n\n1167\n00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:52.880\nSo we know that the task\nsequence matches the image.\n\n1168\n00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.730\nGood to do that,\njust from a continuity perspective, so\n\n1169\n00:57:55.730 --> 00:58:00.570\nwe don't lose track of that and wind up\nhaving three task sequences labelled, oh,\n\n1170\n00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:05.050\nI don't know, Updates.iso that\nmay just randomly cause you to\n\n1171\n00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:09.280\nscrew everything up when you're doing\na live demonstration with no safety net.\n\n1172\n00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.540\nI'm not bitter, by the way.\n\n1173\n00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.070\nI'm not, I do try to manage that.\n\n1174\n00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:17.270\nAnd I do apologize, cuz I do let it come\nout from time to time, those bastards.\n\n1175\n00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:19.470\nAll right, so, Boot image (x64).\n\n1176\n00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:21.210\nWe're gonna grab that one here,\n\n1177\n00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:23.650\nbecause that's the boot image\nwe're gonna work off of.\n\n1178\n00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:26.770\nSo we're gonna go ahead and grab that,\ngonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n1179\n00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.620\nWe're then gonna go ahead and click Next.\n\n1180\n00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:35.080\nAnd now, what we're gonna do, as you can\nsee, and I'll zoom in just a wee bit here\n\n1181\n00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.160\nfor you, is we're gonna set\nup the install to Windows OS,\n\n1182\n00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:41.240\nthen configure networking,\ninstall config manager client member.\n\n1183\n00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.370\nI talked about the fact we can use\nthe client agent to get it in there or\n\n1184\n00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:45.910\nthe install option will do that.\n\n1185\n00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:49.900\nTalked about state migration for\nthe USMT, doing the updates, that's\n\n1186\n00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:54.080\nthe WSUS that's bringing the security\nupdates, do any installs for applications.\n\n1187\n00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.120\nWe got the whole shooting match in here.\n\n1188\n00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.980\nBy the time we're done we're gonna\nhave like a rooting tooting and\n\n1189\n00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.520\nrock them sock them image that's going on.\n\n1190\n00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.160\nYou remember Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots?\n\n1191\n00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:03.690\n>> Yes.\n>> Remember that?\n\n1192\n00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:05.760\nThat was awesome, awesome toy.\n\n1193\n00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:08.850\nAlright, so Image Package, we're gonna\ngo out, we're gonna browse for that.\n\n1194\n00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:11.717\nWe've got our image package there.\n\n1195\n00:59:11.717 --> 00:59:16.816\nWindows81 Enterprise x64,\ndah, dah, dah, dah, dah.\n\n1196\n00:59:16.816 --> 00:59:19.820\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click that, click OK.\n\n1197\n00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.229\nWe then are going to go ahead,\npull that in, and\n\n1198\n00:59:23.229 --> 00:59:26.657\nwe are going to,\nlet me just get caught up here.\n\n1199\n00:59:26.657 --> 00:59:30.706\nNotice the default image, got all that,\nin the image box click 2-2.\n\n1200\n00:59:30.706 --> 00:59:34.592\nSo let's go to images there and we're\ngoing to choose that one right there.\n\n1201\n00:59:34.592 --> 00:59:39.340\nAll right, so then we're going to do is,\nconfigure task sequencer for\n\n1202\n00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:41.090\nuse with BitLocker, and\nwe're going to get rid of that,\n\n1203\n00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:44.940\nbecause we do not want to use BitLocker so\nwe have some options here.\n\n1204\n00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:48.480\nWe can actually allow BitLocker\nto be used with this image.\n\n1205\n00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.020\nWe're not gonna do that, but\nin the real world, we actually may.\n\n1206\n00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:54.650\nWe can partition and format the target\ncomputer before installing the OS if\n\n1207\n00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:58.830\nwe want to, so we can actually go in and\nblow out the drive and specify it.\n\n1208\n00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:01.909\nWe have the product key here,\nwe can do that, specify licensing.\n\n1209\n01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.480\nI love this one.\n\n1210\n01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.890\nRandomly generate\nthe administrator password and/or\n\n1211\n01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.660\nspecify what the password will be.\n\n1212\n01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:12.240\nSo yeah, we're gonna have you do that.\n\n1213\n01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.390\nSo we are gonna go ahead,\nwe are going to uncheck the BitLocker.\n\n1214\n01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:18.430\nJust wanna make sure\nthat one is gonna work.\n\n1215\n01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:22.580\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose join a domain.\n\n1216\n01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.320\nSo let's just do configure network.\n\n1217\n01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.420\nSo let me see there.\n\n1218\n01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.130\nAll right, join a domain.\n\n1219\n01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:32.700\nThe domain is going to be as follows.\n\n1220\n01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.280\nLet's browse and go grab that.\n\n1221\n01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.830\nWe'll choose our\nConfigMgrDom local domain.\n\n1222\n01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:41.980\nLet's specify our domain OU, do that,\n\n1223\n01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:49.190\nand then we are going to\nspecify the account for\n\n1224\n01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:51.670\npermission that is used\nto join the domain.\n\n1225\n01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:55.430\nLet's go ahead and set that, we'll use our\ndomain admin account, so we'll set that.\n\n1226\n01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:57.610\nGo ahead and browse there.\n\n1227\n01:00:57.610 --> 01:01:00.686\nType that in, administrator.\n\n1228\n01:01:00.686 --> 01:01:04.750\nClick check names, click Okay.\n\n1229\n01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:07.490\nLet's wait for that to come back\ncuz I made that mistake last time.\n\n1230\n01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:08.160\nIt took a second.\n\n1231\n01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:14.320\nAll right, let's choose password and\nlet's choose password.\n\n1232\n01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.780\nAnd let's make sure that's good.\n\n1233\n01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.886\nLet's just verify that.\n\n1234\n01:01:19.886 --> 01:01:23.433\nOkay, cuz you fooled me once\nwith that stupid verify thing.\n\n1235\n01:01:23.433 --> 01:01:24.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't fool me again.\n\n1236\n01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:29.460\nAll right, so we're gonna do that, then\nwe're gonna make sure that we're on the,\n\n1237\n01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:35.210\nlet me just see here,\ndid that, did that, did that.\n\n1238\n01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:41.380\nAnd then, state migration box\non the install client manager.\n\n1239\n01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.910\nOkay so on the install client manager box,\n\n1240\n01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.270\nwe are going to just take\na look here real quick.\n\n1241\n01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:52.050\nWe will see that we have our FSP=Primary1,\nthat's our fallback status\n\n1242\n01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:56.340\npoint equal to Primary1, but we've\ngot the config manager package there.\n\n1243\n01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.500\nWe can go in and\nwe can specify things like SMS site code.\n\n1244\n01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.560\nIf you remember, we did that\nstring in one of our earlier demos\n\n1245\n01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.370\nwhere we programmed in the whole thing.\n\n1246\n01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:07.138\nWe would put that in here in the real\nworld, we're not gonna bother with it\n\n1247\n01:02:07.138 --> 01:02:09.566\nright now, but in the real world\nwe would obviously put that in.\n\n1248\n01:02:09.566 --> 01:02:12.956\nSo you would type in SMS site code equals,\nand then put in the site code and\n\n1249\n01:02:12.956 --> 01:02:13.909\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n1250\n01:02:13.909 --> 01:02:16.375\nSo we'll be doing that for\nreal in the real world,\n\n1251\n01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:18.990\nhere we're just gonna\nleave the default there.\n\n1252\n01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:23.970\nFor state migration we could\ncapture the user information.\n\n1253\n01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:26.240\nWe're not gonna bother with that,\nwe're gonna clear all these boxes,\n\n1254\n01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.720\nbut remember user state migration tool\nallows us to be able to effectively\n\n1255\n01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:33.340\ncapture the existing user profile\nfrom the box, store it somewhere,\n\n1256\n01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:34.900\nthen bring it back after the update.\n\n1257\n01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:37.640\nWe're not gonna bother with that, so\nwe're not gonna worry about that.\n\n1258\n01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.060\nSo we're gonna clear all that, and\nwe're gonna capture, or rather also clear\n\n1259\n01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:47.960\nthe capture Microsoft Windows settings,\nget rid of that, so we'll click that.\n\n1260\n01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.420\nAnd the network settings as well, just get\nrid of all of those, we'll click Next, and\n\n1261\n01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.650\nthen are we gonna include\nany software updates?\n\n1262\n01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:58.740\nWe can have the option,\nI'll just show you to go ahead and\n\n1263\n01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:03.410\nput in the mandatory software updates, all\nsoftware updates, or no software updates.\n\n1264\n01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:07.430\nSo we have the option if we have\nthe software update feature installed and\n\n1265\n01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:09.120\nconfigured to do that.\n\n1266\n01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:14.450\nWe then have the option on applications to\ninstall any applications that we may have.\n\n1267\n01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:17.800\nWe don't have any applications\nother than the Config Manager\n\n1268\n01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:24.040\nagent application, but we actually may\nhave Office and all sorts of stuff there.\n\n1269\n01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.150\nWe actually can choose those and install\nthem right from here if we choose to.\n\n1270\n01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:31.020\nSo we can stream those in,\nin effect, and put them in.\n\n1271\n01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.650\nSo, we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Next there.\n\n1272\n01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:34.970\nWe're gonna get Next for the summary.\n\n1273\n01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:35.660\nWe'll let that go.\n\n1274\n01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.320\nNow printing the task sequence really\nisn't hard, because all it is,\n\n1275\n01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.780\nis literally capturing the answers\nto a file, so we can set it up.\n\n1276\n01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.380\nSo, that doesn't take very long.\n\n1277\n01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:48.710\nNow we can go in on that task sequence,\nwe can right-click, and we can edit it.\n\n1278\n01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:51.710\nAnd then, this is the environment that I\nwas talking about that looks a little bit\n\n1279\n01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:56.240\ndifferent than your standard hey, let's\ncreate an answer file environment because\n\n1280\n01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.010\nnow we can go and if we want to make\nchanges, highlight something, we can add\n\n1281\n01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:05.010\nremove we can re-sequence, reorder, do all\nsorts of stuff in here if we choose to.\n\n1282\n01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.652\nSo let's just take a look at,\nuh-oh, how did that happen?\n\n1283\n01:04:07.652 --> 01:04:10.342\nLet's just take a look at\nsome of the settings here.\n\n1284\n01:04:10.342 --> 01:04:12.394\nGive me half a second we'll bring\nthat back up, I did not mean for\n\n1285\n01:04:12.394 --> 01:04:12.927\nthat to happen.\n\n1286\n01:04:12.927 --> 01:04:15.251\nI hit like one too many\nbuttons all at once.\n\n1287\n01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:18.609\nBut what you'll find here is for instance,\n\n1288\n01:04:18.609 --> 01:04:23.670\none of the things we can do is add\nsomething with the menu up there.\n\n1289\n01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:26.040\nAnd you'll see we have all\nthese different options to add.\n\n1290\n01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.200\nSo look under general.\n\n1291\n01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.090\nWe can do any of those\nthings we were doing.\n\n1292\n01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:34.760\nSet up software updates, install a task,\nset a variable, run a powershell script.\n\n1293\n01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.670\nImagine, it's about 100 different\nthings we could do in here as we start\n\n1294\n01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:38.300\ngetting into it.\n\n1295\n01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.580\nI love this action, this is a really cool\nlittle interface, and we can go in on any\n\n1296\n01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:47.000\none of these things, click on it and\nwe can see what the options are.\n\n1297\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.520\nSo restarting Windows PE, the boot\nimage assigned should be specified, or\n\n1298\n01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.130\nwe can go ahead and change that and\nwe can modify that behavior.\n\n1299\n01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:57.550\nAnd so we have properties and\nwe also have options here.\n\n1300\n01:04:57.550 --> 01:04:59.780\nSo we can go ahead and\nwe can sequence that.\n\n1301\n01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.860\nLet's say, for instance,\nwe wanna go into this hard drive.\n\n1302\n01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:07.710\nAnd on restart, we wanna actually be\nable to change the volume structure and\n\n1303\n01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:09.650\nspecify how big the hard drive's gonna be.\n\n1304\n01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:11.487\nRight now we're giving 350 megs for\n\n1305\n01:05:11.487 --> 01:05:14.520\na System Reserved partition and\neverything else to Windows.\n\n1306\n01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.450\nWe can modify that,\njust do the whole thing.\n\n1307\n01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:17.620\nSo we can go in and blow this out and\n\n1308\n01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:21.860\ndo whatever we want in here,\njust by specifying different solutions.\n\n1309\n01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:27.710\nWe can come in under options, and we can\nsee that this is the actual language and\n\n1310\n01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:30.340\nthe system variables\nthat are being set up.\n\n1311\n01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.390\nNow we can click on those and\nactually program them.\n\n1312\n01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:35.082\nThis is kind of like getting into\nthe whole, hey let me learn WQL and\n\n1313\n01:05:35.082 --> 01:05:36.590\nwrite my own queries, right?\n\n1314\n01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:39.134\nYou gotta know enough about what's going\non here to actually be able to specify\n\n1315\n01:05:39.134 --> 01:05:40.170\nthe conditions.\n\n1316\n01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.260\nBut, you can actually\nget very detailed here.\n\n1317\n01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:44.350\nAnd you can go and\nreally play around in here.\n\n1318\n01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:45.370\nThis is kind of nice, right?\n\n1319\n01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:48.460\nBecause we have this capability and we\nhave the ability to be able to go in and\n\n1320\n01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.091\ndo all this stuff, right?\n\n1321\n01:05:50.091 --> 01:05:50.621\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1322\n01:05:50.621 --> 01:05:53.140\n>> Now, they actually wanted us\nto set up the manager toolkit,\n\n1323\n01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:54.560\noh well, we don't care about that.\n\n1324\n01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.580\nYou want to go ahead and\ninstall an application.\n\n1325\n01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.500\nLet's go ahead and\ninstall an application, shall we?\n\n1326\n01:05:58.500 --> 01:05:59.720\nSo let's actually go back in here.\n\n1327\n01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.620\nWhat we'll do is the filing\ncuz I forgot to do that.\n\n1328\n01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:08.960\nLet's just make sure that, because they\nactually want us to edit here anyway.\n\n1329\n01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.880\nSo what we're going to do is just\nsee where they want us to edit for\n\n1330\n01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.200\nuser device affinity, and then I'll\nput in the application here as well.\n\n1331\n01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:16.710\nSo, let me see.\n\n1332\n01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:19.620\nClick Install Operating System and\nadd in General.\n\n1333\n01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:22.830\nAll right, so,\nlet's just go Install Operating System.\n\n1334\n01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:29.460\nAdd in General, and\nwe want to set up Device Affinity.\n\n1335\n01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.960\nWe're gonna Task Sequence Variable.\n\n1336\n01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.970\nSo, where is that?\n\n1337\n01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.860\nSet Task Sequence Variable.\n\n1338\n01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:36.830\nAnd we're gonna go in there.\n\n1339\n01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:38.140\nWe're gonna set that up.\n\n1340\n01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.260\nAnd they want us to enable UDA\nsupport which is gonna enable us to do\n\n1341\n01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.600\nthe solution here for\nuser device affinity.\n\n1342\n01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.730\nSo we're gonna set that up,\nso let's program that in.\n\n1343\n01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:53.570\nWe will do enable UDA support as the name.\n\n1344\n01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:56.540\nSo we'll call that,\noh actually, no wait, sorry.\n\n1345\n01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.100\nYou know what?\n\n1346\n01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:57.870\nWait one second.\n\n1347\n01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:00.049\nControl, what am I doing?\n\n1348\n01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:05.020\nControl C, and control there.\n\n1349\n01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.640\nAnd for the variable,\nwe actually need the following.\n\n1350\n01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.977\nWhat is that test sequence variable?\n\n1351\n01:07:09.977 --> 01:07:13.813\nSMS, SMSTS,\n\n1352\n01:07:13.813 --> 01:07:18.614\nassign, users.\n\n1353\n01:07:20.215 --> 01:07:21.330\nMode.\n\n1354\n01:07:22.723 --> 01:07:25.840\nAll right and for value,\nI'm gonna set that to auto.\n\n1355\n01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:29.910\nAnd then, we are going to go ahead and\n\n1356\n01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:35.540\nwe're going to click OK\nto put that in there.\n\n1357\n01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:36.800\nLet's just make sure that took.\n\n1358\n01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:41.550\nGo back, all right yes so we have that\nthere right now, so that's all good.\n\n1359\n01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:43.610\nSo we're going to get all that in.\n\n1360\n01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:47.420\nAnd then under setup the operating system,\n\n1361\n01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:51.846\nafter we set Windows in configuration\nmanager, we are then going to go ahead and\n\n1362\n01:07:51.846 --> 01:07:56.930\nwe're gonna add, and do general, and\nwe're gonna install an application.\n\n1363\n01:07:56.930 --> 01:08:00.330\nAnd they wanted us to install that\nconfigure manager toolkit, so\n\n1364\n01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:01.710\nwe'll just go ahead and we'll click there.\n\n1365\n01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:04.450\nGo ahead and click OK to set that up.\n\n1366\n01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:05.470\nGot all that set up.\n\n1367\n01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:08.920\nAnd then we'll get that done.\n\n1368\n01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:12.175\nSo we'll actually put in\nthe install application.\n\n1369\n01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:12.835\nAnd see right down there,\n\n1370\n01:08:12.835 --> 01:08:16.075\nwe're going to install an application\nafter we actually configure this thing,\n\n1371\n01:08:16.075 --> 01:08:18.995\nand right up top, we just enabled\nthe user device affinity support,\n\n1372\n01:08:18.995 --> 01:08:23.105\nso that way the users can actually\nspecify that this is their own device.\n\n1373\n01:08:23.105 --> 01:08:25.855\nSo we just edited out that setting or\nthose settings.\n\n1374\n01:08:25.855 --> 01:08:27.375\nWe've got that in the task sequence.\n\n1375\n01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:30.025\nNow we're going to get the task\nsequence deployed out, but\n\n1376\n01:08:30.025 --> 01:08:32.820\nlet's just quickly take a look at\nwhere we are with our image here.\n\n1377\n01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.830\nSo looks like we're still capturing.\n\n1378\n01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:37.395\nWe are just continuing to\nstream those bits out.\n\n1379\n01:08:37.395 --> 01:08:39.250\nWe're a little bit further\nahead then we were, but\n\n1380\n01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:42.240\nthis takes a long time because we're\nbasically sequencing the hard drive and\n\n1381\n01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.162\nwe're capturing it,\nthat's why take so long to go.\n\n1382\n01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:46.870\nAll right so we're going to come back in\nhere, we're going to deploy that task\n\n1383\n01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:50.575\nsequence out now so let's right\nclick on that task sequence and\n\n1384\n01:08:50.575 --> 01:08:55.080\nlet's actually go ahead and\nlet's do a deploy.\n\n1385\n01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.780\nSo we're going to deploy the task\nsequence out, we have a collection.\n\n1386\n01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.150\nWe have to go specify,\n\n1387\n01:09:00.150 --> 01:09:05.520\nwe're going to go put that into our,\nwhich collection do they want us to use?\n\n1388\n01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.360\nWe're gonna do all unknown computers.\n\n1389\n01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.700\nOkay so we're gonna go grab that one,\nall unknown computers,\n\n1390\n01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.960\nclick OK, and then click next.\n\n1391\n01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:17.940\nAnd then our purpose is gonna be required.\n\n1392\n01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:21.030\nSo we're gonna set that up.\n\n1393\n01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:23.360\nAnd then make available to the following.\n\n1394\n01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.130\nWe're gonna specify only media and PXE.\n\n1395\n01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.180\nSo we're gonna go in, grab that.\n\n1396\n01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:32.460\nAnd just zero in on that so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n1397\n01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.680\nWe're gonna make this available for\n\n1398\n01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:38.410\nthe following cuz remember this is\ngonna be used for PXE boots, right?\n\n1399\n01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:41.360\nSo we're gonna use this and\nspecify that setting.\n\n1400\n01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.420\nSo we're gonna choose that.\n\n1401\n01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.170\nGoing to, there we go.\n\n1402\n01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:47.730\nHit next.\n\n1403\n01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:50.350\nWe're not going to worry about scheduling,\n\n1404\n01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:52.790\nno actually we are going to\ncreate a schedule assignment.\n\n1405\n01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:53.850\nI'm sorry.\n\n1406\n01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.610\nWe wanna do it right away,\nwe wanna do it as quickly as possible.\n\n1407\n01:09:56.610 --> 01:10:01.160\nSo we're gonna assign this,\nwe're gonna set this up and you'll see it\n\n1408\n01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.320\njust basically sets up and says okay,\nassign on the following schedule.\n\n1409\n01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.250\nOccurs starting on that day, notice we can\ndo this immediately if we wanted to and\n\n1410\n01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:10.930\nget that deployed out as well.\n\n1411\n01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:12.980\nSo we'll do that, we'll get that set up.\n\n1412\n01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:17.730\nI'm gonna choose to actually go ahead and\njust do that immediately.\n\n1413\n01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:21.470\nThat'll get it set up right away and\njust get it you there for us.\n\n1414\n01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:22.340\nSo we'll do that.\n\n1415\n01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:26.420\nWe don't care about user experience.\n\n1416\n01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.530\nWe're just gonna accept\nthe defaults there.\n\n1417\n01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:30.695\nI mean, I should say we do\ncare about user experience.\n\n1418\n01:10:30.695 --> 01:10:34.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're not gonna do any alerts.\n\n1419\n01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:38.100\nAnd on distribution point\nwe'll accept the defaults and\n\n1420\n01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:41.440\nthen hit next and just get that set up.\n\n1421\n01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.490\nAll right so we're gonna do that.\n\n1422\n01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:45.630\nAnd we should be good.\n\n1423\n01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:49.530\nLet's go out and just take a look\nat our references tab there.\n\n1424\n01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:51.890\nAnd we should have all of that.\n\n1425\n01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:57.920\nAnd on our references tab, what you'll\nsee is what's in that package now.\n\n1426\n01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.480\nWe've got the config manager toolkit,\n\n1427\n01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.600\nbecause I put that in there, along with\nour Windows WIM and our boot image.\n\n1428\n01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.270\nSo, that's just what we've been building.\n\n1429\n01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:06.120\nWe set all that up for deployment.\n\n1430\n01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.970\nSo now, what we're actually gonna\nbe able to do is start the task\n\n1431\n01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:11.422\nsequence that's gonna deploy\nto the bare metal system.\n\n1432\n01:11:11.422 --> 01:11:12.890\nSo we're gonna be able go in and\ndo that next.\n\n1433\n01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:13.900\nThat is kinda nice, isn't it?\n\n1434\n01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.070\nAll right?\n\n1435\n01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:16.260\nAll right, so you'll see.\n\n1436\n01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.820\nWe'll just check on our existing system.\n\n1437\n01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.670\nStill capturing, no big deal there.\n\n1438\n01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:22.990\nSo, what we're gonna do is go into the\nbare metal system that's already been set\n\n1439\n01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:27.450\nup, and because it did an auto boot\nwhen we brought it up, it tried and\n\n1440\n01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.870\nfailed because there was\nnothing to connect to.\n\n1441\n01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:33.560\nWe're gonna go ahead and recycle that\nin just a second and get that running.\n\n1442\n01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.970\nSo, what we're gonna do is the following.\n\n1443\n01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:42.160\nWe are going to, let me just make sure\nthat there's nothing weird we gotta do.\n\n1444\n01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.070\nConfig Manager, click OK to install that.\n\n1445\n01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:48.550\nAll right, so, yeah,\nwe're gonna go ahead and start that up.\n\n1446\n01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:51.171\nIt's gonna require an IP from\nthe DHCP environment, so\n\n1447\n01:11:51.171 --> 01:11:54.240\nlet's hope that that does work\nthe way it's supposed to.\n\n1448\n01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.210\nLet's take a look,\ncuz it wasn't getting one before, so\n\n1449\n01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:58.100\nhopefully it will do so now.\n\n1450\n01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.070\nLet's see what happens there.\n\n1451\n01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.774\nThere we go.\n\n1452\n01:12:02.916 --> 01:12:08.273\nAnd you'll see that it is probably not.\n\n1453\n01:12:08.273 --> 01:12:09.630\nLet's see.\n\n1454\n01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:10.662\nOkay, I could probably get it there.\n\n1455\n01:12:10.662 --> 01:12:15.014\nIt is got an IP address,\nit is starting the TFTP download.\n\n1456\n01:12:15.014 --> 01:12:19.533\nRight there, connecting to the server,\ndownloading smsboot\\x64\\pxeboot,\n\n1457\n01:12:19.533 --> 01:12:21.850\nthat's gonna be our network boot.\n\n1458\n01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:22.950\nSo it's doing that.\n\n1459\n01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:26.750\nIt is now connected and\nit is loading our file,\n\n1460\n01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:31.144\nSMSImages [SOUND] boot,\nwhatever, whatever .wim.\n\n1461\n01:12:31.144 --> 01:12:34.330\nThat's the image code by the way for\nour wim image, right?\n\n1462\n01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:40.140\nThe MC00005 is the unique package ID for\nour Windows 8 wim that we've created.\n\n1463\n01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:43.100\nSo that, remember everything is unique\npackage ID when we set up the software.\n\n1464\n01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:47.440\nSo that is actually gonna be the install\nfile coming down or the wim image coming\n\n1465\n01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:51.220\ndown to start loading, so that way we\ncan actually start running, right?\n\n1466\n01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.460\nSo we're going to get our WinPE,\n\n1467\n01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.150\nand then we're gonna be able to bring in\nthe Windows 8 wim and start the install.\n\n1468\n01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:59.560\nSo we're gonna just wait for\nthat to load up.\n\n1469\n01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.965\nWe'll give that just a second.\n\n1470\n01:13:00.965 --> 01:13:01.555\nWon't take very long.\n\n1471\n01:13:01.555 --> 01:13:06.415\nWe'll get a menu here in a minute as soon\nas the WinPE image actually kicks in.\n\n1472\n01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:09.455\nIt'll look like it's actually gonna\nstart installing WIndows, by the way.\n\n1473\n01:13:09.455 --> 01:13:10.725\nPeople often get stopped by this and\n\n1474\n01:13:10.725 --> 01:13:13.145\ngo oh my God,\nam I really installing WIndows right away?\n\n1475\n01:13:13.145 --> 01:13:13.787\nNot right away.\n\n1476\n01:13:13.787 --> 01:13:17.275\nYou're gonna get the WinPE which is gonna\nlook just like Windows in the beginning,\n\n1477\n01:13:17.275 --> 01:13:19.510\nbut we'll get the WinPE environment.\n\n1478\n01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:21.120\nThen once that comes up,\n\n1479\n01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.550\nwe'll have a menu that we can then\nactually choose an image from.\n\n1480\n01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:26.270\nAnd then we'll be able to deploy that\nimage cuz right now we're loading\n\n1481\n01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:30.280\nthe WinPE environment which is that\nx64 boot image that we modified.\n\n1482\n01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:35.400\nAlmost done here, give that\nprobably another 30 seconds or so.\n\n1483\n01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.110\nLooks like it's just about done loading,\nwe'll watch while that comes up.\n\n1484\n01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:41.965\nSee it's gonna start looking like Windows.\n\n1485\n01:13:41.965 --> 01:13:43.600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1486\n01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.200\n>> We even got the spinning vortex\nof nothingness that goes on,\n\n1487\n01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.570\non the bottom there.\n\n1488\n01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:51.550\nAnd then we're gonna get,\nas you can see, right?\n\n1489\n01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.480\nWindows is starting up.\n\n1490\n01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.440\nIt looks like it may be loading Windows,\nexcept for\n\n1491\n01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.490\nthat whole initializing\nWinPE thing that's going on.\n\n1492\n01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:03.206\nAnd then we got a whole bunch\nof stuff that comes up,\n\n1493\n01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:08.420\nand, Let's just take a look at that.\n\n1494\n01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.090\nWe're actually running\nX Windows/system32/cmd.exe.\n\n1495\n01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:15.620\nThat's a mount point that's running\nthe WinPE environment force.\n\n1496\n01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:19.300\nWe got the system center 2012 config\nmanager splash screen behind there.\n\n1497\n01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.180\nAnd this is cool.\n\n1498\n01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:21.870\nWhen was the last time you saw that?\n\n1499\n01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:25.261\nWe get to set user device affinity as\npart of the install, isn't that cool?\n\n1500\n01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:26.390\n>> [CROSSTALK] Ever.\nThat is.\n\n1501\n01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:27.740\n>> That's that thing that we set up.\n\n1502\n01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:28.800\n>> That's what you set up early on.\n\n1503\n01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.210\n>> The EDA, or the user device UDA,\nthe user device affinity.\n\n1504\n01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:34.840\nSo we're gonna be able to set\nthe user device ID right there\n\n1505\n01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.820\nas part of the actual installation.\n\n1506\n01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.109\nSo we're gonna go and we're gonna do that.\n\n1507\n01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.710\nSo, let me just see what they want\nus to use specifically there.\n\n1508\n01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.520\nThey want us to do user1, okay?\n\n1509\n01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.500\nSo, let's go in, and let's do our domain,\n\n1510\n01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:52.297\nso configmgrdom,\n\n1511\n01:14:52.297 --> 01:14:58.040\nand then user1, I'm gonna hit Set.\n\n1512\n01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.970\nThat's gonna put our user\ninformation in there.\n\n1513\n01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:06.590\nSo now what it's doing is telling us,\nhey, we're about to run,\n\n1514\n01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:13.712\nthere we go, we're about to run that\nmandatory task sequence that we created.\n\n1515\n01:15:13.712 --> 01:15:16.765\nIt's gonna start in 178 seconds\nif we don't get out of the way.\n\n1516\n01:15:16.765 --> 01:15:20.530\n[LAUGH] It's gonna be\na lot less than that.\n\n1517\n01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:21.180\nNow it's counting down.\n\n1518\n01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:23.760\nWe're just gonna click OK and\nlet that kick off.\n\n1519\n01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.450\nIt's gonna start running.\n\n1520\n01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:28.730\nFirst thing it's doing there\nis partitioning disk 0 and\n\n1521\n01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:31.510\ngoing in and setting up the BIOS and\nstarting a partition.\n\n1522\n01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:33.680\nAnd eventually if we\nlet this thing run and\n\n1523\n01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.310\ndo its thing, it's now formatting\nthe C drive right there.\n\n1524\n01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.790\nWe eventually let that go.\n\n1525\n01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:44.150\nIt's downloading the Windows\n8.1.wim right there.\n\n1526\n01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:46.760\nSo you could see it zipping\nalong pretty nicely.\n\n1527\n01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.657\nAnd if we let it go eventually,\n\n1528\n01:15:50.657 --> 01:15:55.565\nthen we will be able to see that\nthe install actually completes.\n\n1529\n01:15:55.565 --> 01:15:58.941\nAnd we would be able to eventually\nlog on to the operating system and\n\n1530\n01:15:58.941 --> 01:16:03.175\nbe able to actually validate that the\ninstall was done and that it's working.\n\n1531\n01:16:03.175 --> 01:16:04.125\nIt's gonna take awhile.\n\n1532\n01:16:04.125 --> 01:16:07.585\nWe're not gonna let this thing go the\nwhole way as you know, because as I told\n\n1533\n01:16:07.585 --> 01:16:11.425\nyou it'll take some time to download and\nthen to actually run through the install.\n\n1534\n01:16:11.425 --> 01:16:13.385\nWe really just wanted to demo for you and\n\n1535\n01:16:13.385 --> 01:16:17.520\nshow you what the background steps\nare to get this all set up, so\n\n1536\n01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.210\nthat way we would understand the specifics\nof operating system deployment.\n\n1537\n01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:22.990\n>> That's fantastic.\n\n1538\n01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:28.020\n>> I'd say that's just more than\nfantastic, that is just down right dandy.\n\n1539\n01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.480\n>> It is, it is.\n\n1540\n01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.110\nAll right, well, Adam, I'll tell you what,\nanother great episode here.\n\n1541\n01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:36.650\nA really good, hands on look at how we\ncan get that operating system deployed.\n\n1542\n01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:38.130\nOnce we get a lot of that set up, and\n\n1543\n01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:41.100\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, we don't have\nto go through that every time, right?\n\n1544\n01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:44.360\nOnce we've got that package created,\nthat task sequence created,\n\n1545\n01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:48.910\nnow it's just a matter of pulling out to\ndifferent collections, or assigning it?\n\n1546\n01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:49.770\n>> Absolutely, yes.\n\n1547\n01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:51.405\nIt's a really good point to make,\nby the way.\n\n1548\n01:16:51.405 --> 01:16:54.730\nAnd we do, by the way, have a couple of\nsummary things we wanna go to before we\n\n1549\n01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:56.530\nfinish up, just to keep that in mind.\n\n1550\n01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:59.120\nBut yes, Mike makes an excellent\npoint which is, yeah,\n\n1551\n01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.850\nwe did a lot of heavy lifting, right?\n\n1552\n01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:03.910\nDid a lot of work to get this all\nconfigured, get it all set up.\n\n1553\n01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:05.580\nWe had to create the task sequence.\n\n1554\n01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.370\nWe had to load the boot, or\nrather modify the boot wim.\n\n1555\n01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:12.640\nWe had to go in and\ncapture the operating system image,\n\n1556\n01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.110\nwhich is actually still\nrunning as we speak.\n\n1557\n01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:19.510\nWe had to do all that in theory, then take\nthat captured image, turn that around and\n\n1558\n01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:22.610\nthen use that to do the deployment\nafter we set up the task sequence and\n\n1559\n01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:23.760\nsequence everything out.\n\n1560\n01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.650\nCaptured that, distributed that task\nsequence out to the distribution point.\n\n1561\n01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:28.560\nA lot of work.\n\n1562\n01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.830\nNow the answer to Mike's question is yes,\nbut.\n\n1563\n01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:35.410\nAnd this is one of those where we have to\nreally think about what it is we're doing.\n\n1564\n01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:40.150\nSo, the answer is, we do not have to do\nthat work again provided that we want to\n\n1565\n01:17:40.150 --> 01:17:42.300\nkeep maintaining and\ndeploying the same image.\n\n1566\n01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.050\n>> Mm.\n>> We may have to to recreate, and\n\n1567\n01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:46.210\nindeed we do, have to recreate this exact,\n\n1568\n01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:49.790\nstep by step process whenever we want\nto deploy a new operating system.\n\n1569\n01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.470\nSo, we've done Windows 8.1,\nhypothetically.\n\n1570\n01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:55.310\nWhen Windows 10 comes along,\nwe've gotta go through and\n\n1571\n01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:57.530\ndo this whole thing again to\nbe able to sequence that.\n\n1572\n01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:59.330\nI'll capture that and deploy that.\n\n1573\n01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:03.920\nSo we don't do this very often, but we do\nit often enough that it is something you\n\n1574\n01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.240\nwould do more than once or twice,\nif you're running the system long term,\n\n1575\n01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.550\nthree or four years deploying, using\nmultiple operating systems over that time.\n\n1576\n01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:14.470\nYou're definitely gonna\nsee this occurring,\n\n1577\n01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:15.880\nwe just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n1578\n01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.780\nSorry, I was just sneaking a peek to see\nif we had something cool that might have\n\n1579\n01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.010\nfinished, so\nwe can pop up on the window and show you.\n\n1580\n01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:23.450\nBut it's still running,\nit's gonna be cooking for a while.\n\n1581\n01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:26.770\nWe did wanna go ahead and\njust throw up some of the summary\n\n1582\n01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:29.210\nnotes we always make for\nyou and always provide for you.\n\n1583\n01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:30.990\nWe're gonna do that just so\nwe can go through them.\n\n1584\n01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:33.760\nWe actually have a couple cool diagrams,\nsomething to demonstrate out\n\n1585\n01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.660\nsome of the stuff that you've\nactually seen live as well.\n\n1586\n01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.350\nAll right, so\n\n1587\n01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:40.000\nwe're gonna start with I think some\nterminology if I'm not mistaken.\n\n1588\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.780\nI want to do a little terminology,\na little vocab if you will.\n\n1589\n01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.830\nCould we zoom in,\nmake that a little bigger perhaps for\n\n1590\n01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:48.565\nthe people at home that want to actually\nbe able to see what's on the screen?\n\n1591\n01:18:48.565 --> 01:18:49.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As opposed to just hearing me\n\n1592\n01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:50.560\ntalk about it.\n\n1593\n01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.990\nSo we'll give Mike just a second\nto kind of zoom in on that.\n\n1594\n01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:55.610\nSo we thought we'd start with\na little vocabulary here for you.\n\n1595\n01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:00.430\nWe have terminology that's commonly used\nwith the operating system deployment\n\n1596\n01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:01.360\nthought process.\n\n1597\n01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.800\nWe have our image,\nthe category rather is image,\n\n1598\n01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.820\nin the category rather I should say.\n\n1599\n01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.982\nWe have terms called boot image, OS\nimage and the Windows image file format,\n\n1600\n01:19:08.982 --> 01:19:13.205\nor the .wim file which Mike\ncorrectly identified for us.\n\n1601\n01:19:13.205 --> 01:19:15.220\nWhen I asked what is a .wim and\nhe said, well it's a file.\n\n1602\n01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:18.855\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Duh, so it's the WIndows image file.\n\n1603\n01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:20.975\nIn the task area we have task sequencing,\n\n1604\n01:19:20.975 --> 01:19:23.710\nremember task sequence steps,\ntask sequence group.\n\n1605\n01:19:23.710 --> 01:19:24.940\nWe did the task sequencing.\n\n1606\n01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.110\nWe set all that up.\n\n1607\n01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:27.970\nWe didn't look at drivers, but\n\n1608\n01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:31.770\nwe normally will actually want to\nprobably install drivers, right,\n\n1609\n01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:35.280\nbecause drivers are actually gonna be\npotentially really important to us here.\n\n1610\n01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:39.037\nAnd one of the things we can do\nIs we can actually throw this\n\n1611\n01:19:39.037 --> 01:19:42.430\noperating system image\ninto virtual machines.\n\n1612\n01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:44.700\nIt's not just about imaging\nphysical machines anymore,\n\n1613\n01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:48.880\nbut we actual create a virtual machine\nimage as well, or virtual hard drives.\n\n1614\n01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.460\nAnd so we may need drivers for\nthe virtual environment,\n\n1615\n01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.630\nlike the virtual network card\ndrivers that Hyper-V supports.\n\n1616\n01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:57.990\nSo we may have a reason and need to\ngo in and add drivers at some point.\n\n1617\n01:19:57.990 --> 01:20:01.430\nAnd actually if we could flip back\nto my machine for just a moment\n\n1618\n01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.520\nI just actually wanna take the opportunity\nto show you that real quick,\n\n1619\n01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.500\ncuz we didn't actually look at that and\nI apologize, we probably should of.\n\n1620\n01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:07.790\nI didn't think about that.\n\n1621\n01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:08.884\nSo let me just zoom in here real quick.\n\n1622\n01:20:08.884 --> 01:20:12.610\nWe're not gonna actually add drivers cuz\nwe don't have any drivers to add in and\n\n1623\n01:20:12.610 --> 01:20:14.778\nwe'd have to recompile\nthem into the images,\n\n1624\n01:20:14.778 --> 01:20:16.958\nbut I am just going to\nshow you where they live.\n\n1625\n01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:21.138\nSo in the operating system image or rather\noperating system deployment area here,\n\n1626\n01:20:21.138 --> 01:20:23.230\nwe have drivers and driver packages.\n\n1627\n01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:26.200\nThere currently are no drivers here,\nbut we could add them in.\n\n1628\n01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:29.650\nAnd what we'd have to do is just\nright-click and import driver so\n\n1629\n01:20:29.650 --> 01:20:31.740\nwe could certainly go in and\ndo that easily enough,\n\n1630\n01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:36.380\nand we would then have to have the source\nfile to be able to import from, so\n\n1631\n01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:39.190\nwe would have the source\nfolder where the driver's are.\n\n1632\n01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:41.040\nWe'd have the INF files.\n\n1633\n01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.890\nAnd the INI files and\nall the files associated with the drivers.\n\n1634\n01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:46.820\nSo we would have to get\nthose from the manufacturer.\n\n1635\n01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:50.910\nWe'd have to get them from whatever\nvendor is gonna provide them to us.\n\n1636\n01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:52.430\nWe would them load them in.\n\n1637\n01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:55.900\nWhen I do this for virtual machine\nsupport, we're gonna image and\n\n1638\n01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.410\nCentOS is out to do virtual machines.\n\n1639\n01:20:58.410 --> 01:21:01.880\nWe have to load the virtual machine\ndriver files for the NIC cards.\n\n1640\n01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.590\nWhether they are, in this case,\nHyper-V, or whatever they may be.\n\n1641\n01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:05.680\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1642\n01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.590\nBut that's where we're\ngonna see those drivers,\n\n1643\n01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:10.340\nwhen we're thinking about our drivers and\ntalking about them.\n\n1644\n01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:12.670\nAll right, we can go back to\nthe list on Mike's machine.\n\n1645\n01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:15.610\nWe'll be able to go ahead and\ncontinue our conversation.\n\n1646\n01:21:15.610 --> 01:21:19.720\nIn the computer area, we talked about\nreference computers, source computer,\n\n1647\n01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.790\ndestination computer.\n\n1648\n01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:24.500\nWe had all those different terms,\nand we examined those.\n\n1649\n01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.960\nAnd then we have the Operating System\nInstaller, the PXE boot, the Win PE, and\n\n1650\n01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.290\nenvironment Sysprep.\n\n1651\n01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:31.860\nYou saw us run those\nsolutions there as well.\n\n1652\n01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:33.280\nSo just some of the vocabulary.\n\n1653\n01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.450\nNow I know that we did have some images I\nthink that we're gonna go to next, right?\n\n1654\n01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:39.860\nSo we had some images that\nwe wanted to take a look at.\n\n1655\n01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:42.130\nWe need to go full screen on this\nprobably to zoom in a little.\n\n1656\n01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.540\nThank you so much.\n\n1657\n01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.610\nSo what we're gonna do\nnow is walk through.\n\n1658\n01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:48.840\nI think the first one's gonna be\nwhat we just did and we're demoing,\n\n1659\n01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.560\nwhich is the bare metal install, right?\n\n1660\n01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.870\nSo we diagrammed out a bunch of\ndifferent install thought processes for\n\n1661\n01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:55.660\nyou to show you how they may operate.\n\n1662\n01:21:55.660 --> 01:22:01.200\nSo what we have here in the middle is\nthe primary sight server up top there.\n\n1663\n01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.150\nThen we have a management point\noff to the side on the left.\n\n1664\n01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:06.750\nWe have a distribution\npoint there as well and\n\n1665\n01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:09.640\nwe have the client machine that's\ngoing to be getting that image.\n\n1666\n01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:13.550\nAnd so what's happening there the client\nis talking to the management point at\n\n1667\n01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:17.010\nthe dotted line arrow and it's talking\nto the distribution point as well.\n\n1668\n01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:20.980\nRemember, we talked to the management\npoint to find up policy updates,\n\n1669\n01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:24.000\nto find out where our distribution point\nis, which you get an image from, and\n\n1670\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.640\nto find out where to go.\n\n1671\n01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.750\nWe then go and\ntalk to the distribution point,\n\n1672\n01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:30.030\ndistribution point sends\nthe image back up to the client.\n\n1673\n01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:32.480\nSo in a bare metal install,\n\n1674\n01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:35.730\nthat client is downloading the operating\nsystem cuz nothing is there.\n\n1675\n01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:39.520\nNow, remember, and\nI know you have the steps there.\n\n1676\n01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.110\nLet's zoom in on that one right there.\n\n1677\n01:22:42.230 --> 01:22:43.580\nLet's just zoom in on that one.\n\n1678\n01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.840\nSo, what's happening is,\nI think we just lost the top on that.\n\n1679\n01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.530\n>> There we go.\n\n1680\n01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:48.700\n>> It disappeared, and\nall we had was distribution point.\n\n1681\n01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:51.730\nWhat essentially happens here\nfrom the clients perspective\n\n1682\n01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:54.060\nis remember the client doesn't\nhave an operating system.\n\n1683\n01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:57.105\nThe client also does not have\na config manager client agent.\n\n1684\n01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:57.750\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n1685\n01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:01.990\nwhat has to happen is the client performs\na PXE boot from the distribution point.\n\n1686\n01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:04.710\nA client reads the instructions\nfrom the management point,\n\n1687\n01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:07.540\ninstalls operating system from\nthe distribution point, and\n\n1688\n01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.910\nthen the results are reported\nback to the management point.\n\n1689\n01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:10.570\nThese are the steps.\n\n1690\n01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:13.580\nAnd, you actually saw us doing this live,\nin the demo environment,\n\n1691\n01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.520\nas we were walking through this just now.\n\n1692\n01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.320\nSo, we wanna keep that in mind,\nand be aware of that.\n\n1693\n01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.000\nBecause, that's basically the process for\nthe bare metal install.\n\n1694\n01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:24.062\nWhen we do an operating system refresh,\nwhich I think, is the next one,\n\n1695\n01:23:24.062 --> 01:23:25.610\nif I'm not mistaken, right?\n\n1696\n01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:29.420\nSo, if we're gonna do an operating system\nrefresh, where we have an existing client,\n\n1697\n01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.530\nand we wanna update the operating system.\n\n1698\n01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:33.070\nMaybe it's running Windows 7.\n\n1699\n01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:37.440\nWe want to go ahead, and we want to\ninstall Windows 8 or something like that.\n\n1700\n01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:41.290\nSo we're gonna do an existing operating\nsystem, existing client refresh.\n\n1701\n01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:43.250\nWe still have our primary\nsite sitting up there.\n\n1702\n01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:44.900\nWe have our management point.\n\n1703\n01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:45.564\nWe have our distribution.\n\n1704\n01:23:45.564 --> 01:23:48.135\nIn point, but notice not as many arrows.\n\n1705\n01:23:48.135 --> 01:23:52.115\nClient talks to management point say okay,\nyeah there's a policy update.\n\n1706\n01:23:52.115 --> 01:23:56.145\nGo grab, or there's an update in this case\nsay distribution of an OS that's waiting.\n\n1707\n01:23:56.145 --> 01:23:59.055\nThe client installs the OS from\nthe distribution point and\n\n1708\n01:23:59.055 --> 01:24:00.545\nthen comes back up the agents there.\n\n1709\n01:24:00.545 --> 01:24:03.125\nWe just lay the new bits in on top and\naffect right?\n\n1710\n01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:06.265\nSo that's what's gonna happen\nwith an operating system refresh.\n\n1711\n01:24:06.265 --> 01:24:07.949\nWhat about if we do an in place upgrade?\n\n1712\n01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:13.070\nAnd then place upgrade is going to\nallow us to essentially download\n\n1713\n01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:14.440\nstate information.\n\n1714\n01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.660\nOr, excuse me, upload state information.\n\n1715\n01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.890\nThen download the operating system.\n\n1716\n01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:21.010\nAnd then download state information again.\n\n1717\n01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:24.810\nThat state information is the USMT,\nthe user state migration tool.\n\n1718\n01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:25.670\nState information,\n\n1719\n01:24:25.670 --> 01:24:29.640\nwhich is the profile information, and\ncurrent status settings on the system.\n\n1720\n01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.950\nSo this is where we're going to,\neffectively.\n\n1721\n01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:35.330\nRoll over the top of the system and\nwe wanna save everything.\n\n1722\n01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:37.800\nAs opposed to just installing the OS and\n\n1723\n01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.250\nrestarting from scratch,\nwhere our profile is probably gonna be\n\n1724\n01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:44.395\nstored remotely on a network share\nsomewhere with all my documents.\n\n1725\n01:24:44.395 --> 01:24:45.305\nAnd all that stuff.\n\n1726\n01:24:45.305 --> 01:24:46.895\nWe can map to it and pull it back.\n\n1727\n01:24:46.895 --> 01:24:49.425\nThis is if we want to save\nthat off the machine and\n\n1728\n01:24:49.425 --> 01:24:50.655\nthen actually pull it back down.\n\n1729\n01:24:50.655 --> 01:24:52.265\nSo that's what this process would be.\n\n1730\n01:24:52.265 --> 01:24:54.005\nSo you can see the steps over there,\n\n1731\n01:24:54.005 --> 01:24:57.455\non the right the client's gonna download\npolicy from the management point,\n\n1732\n01:24:57.455 --> 01:25:01.225\nclient will upload the state information\nto the state migration point.\n\n1733\n01:25:01.225 --> 01:25:04.775\nState migration point is that other\nsite role that we have not installed or\n\n1734\n01:25:04.775 --> 01:25:08.280\ntalked about but it's sitting down there\nat the lower left hand side of the screen.\n\n1735\n01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:12.570\nThat's the site roll that is gonna\ndrive the user State Migration tool,\n\n1736\n01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:16.650\ninformation gathering, management,\nand dispersion processes for us.\n\n1737\n01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:18.920\nSo, that's a new site\nroll that we can install.\n\n1738\n01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.500\nClient installs the OS from\nthe distribution point.\n\n1739\n01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.800\nClient downloads needed information\nfrom the migration point, and\n\n1740\n01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.890\nthen results are uploaded\nto the management point.\n\n1741\n01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:31.430\nAnd then we have a side-by-side\nmigration option as well.\n\n1742\n01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:33.800\nThis is where we can use\nan existing client and\n\n1743\n01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.060\nwe create an association\nwith a new computer and\n\n1744\n01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:39.840\nwe bounce that state migration\ndata from one machine to another.\n\n1745\n01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.480\nSo effectively we have two clients we are\ngoing to take the state off the old client\n\n1746\n01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.530\nwe're going to install the operating\nsystem on the new client and then\n\n1747\n01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:50.200\nwe're going to drop that state into the\nnew client leaving the old one in tact and\n\n1748\n01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.480\ndoing something else with it.\n\n1749\n01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.240\nProbably selling it on Ebay, and,\nI don't know, who knows what, right?\n\n1750\n01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.860\nSo it's the same process,\nbasically, only difference is,\n\n1751\n01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:02.220\nwe're transferring that state to the\nholding pattern on the immigration point,\n\n1752\n01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:04.860\nbut instead of downloading it\nback to the original machine,\n\n1753\n01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:07.310\nwe're going to download it back\na newly installed machine.\n\n1754\n01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:08.950\nIt's really the only difference there.\n\n1755\n01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:10.290\nAll right, so we have all that.\n\n1756\n01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:12.970\nNow, I think we also then go back\nto a list for prerequisites,\n\n1757\n01:26:12.970 --> 01:26:14.300\nwhich is what you were about to show.\n\n1758\n01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.500\nThere, we may have to zoom out just a bit.\n\n1759\n01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:20.050\nPrerequisites there for\noperating system deployment.\n\n1760\n01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:21.740\nIn other words,\nwhat are the roles that we need?\n\n1761\n01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.320\nWhat are the things we need to do?\n\n1762\n01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:26.820\nWe have a primary site server,\nwe know that.\n\n1763\n01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:28.030\nWe need to have the Windows ADK,\n\n1764\n01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:31.900\nthe automated deployment kit,\nset up for Windows 8.1.\n\n1765\n01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:35.520\nBecause that's what we get,\nwhere we get the WinP boot images from and\n\n1766\n01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.400\nall the user state migration tool.\n\n1767\n01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.910\nNow in our very first demo.\n\n1768\n01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:43.100\nIn one of our very first episodes\ntogether as we did the installation in\n\n1769\n01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.355\nthe build out and\nI demoed all that for you.\n\n1770\n01:26:45.355 --> 01:26:47.035\nWe actually installed the Windows ADK,\n\n1771\n01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:51.175\nand we chose to install the Windows PE\nboot images so we would see those.\n\n1772\n01:26:51.175 --> 01:26:52.345\nSo that's where that comes from.\n\n1773\n01:26:52.345 --> 01:26:56.015\nIf you don't remember that, if you haven't\nseen that, or you're just not familiar\n\n1774\n01:26:56.015 --> 01:26:59.277\nwith or it just doesn't register, while\nwith you in terms of what I'm saying,\n\n1775\n01:26:59.277 --> 01:27:02.117\ngo back and look at that very first\nepisode with did with the first demo,\n\n1776\n01:27:02.117 --> 01:27:06.802\nwhere we actually walked through and set\nup the site, and we did install the ABK.\n\n1777\n01:27:06.802 --> 01:27:09.387\nOn the distribution point,\nwe have to enable that for PXE and\n\n1778\n01:27:09.387 --> 01:27:10.867\nour multicast support.\n\n1779\n01:27:10.867 --> 01:27:12.327\nWe did do that, by the way.\n\n1780\n01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:15.677\nThe windows DS, the deployement services\nrole has to be installed there.\n\n1781\n01:27:15.677 --> 01:27:17.800\nWe did that as part of our walk through.\n\n1782\n01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.760\nState migration point would have to\nbe installed, if we're gonna use\n\n1783\n01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:24.040\nthe User State Migration Tool\nto support state migrations.\n\n1784\n01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.010\nWe didn't bother with that,\nbut in the real world,\n\n1785\n01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:28.250\nif you wanted to do that,\nyou could do that.\n\n1786\n01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:31.120\nWe need the DHCP setup to support PXE and\nMulticast,\n\n1787\n01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.470\nand we took care of that as\npart of the configuration.\n\n1788\n01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:36.230\nAnd then firewalls need\nto allow PXE traffic,\n\n1789\n01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:40.380\nthey need to be allowing us to be able\nto move that PXE traffic back and forth.\n\n1790\n01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:42.110\nSo it's important for us to know that.\n\n1791\n01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:45.350\nThat is down there on the bottom,\nkind of just hiding under the chart.\n\n1792\n01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:47.390\nBut we do wanna make sure we\nare aware of that as well.\n\n1793\n01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.410\nI think we have the difference\nbetween image file and\n\n1794\n01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:51.730\ninstaller packages up, right?\n\n1795\n01:27:51.730 --> 01:27:52.640\nSo we got that.\n\n1796\n01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.070\nSo we can avoid two types of operating\nsystem images, either an image file, or\n\n1797\n01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:57.350\nan installer package.\n\n1798\n01:27:57.350 --> 01:28:01.350\nThe image file's used to deploy to\na target computer and reference computers.\n\n1799\n01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:03.130\nYou create that from a reference computer.\n\n1800\n01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:06.830\nThat's essentially what we did in\nour walk-through was to create and\n\n1801\n01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:08.260\nthen deploy an image file.\n\n1802\n01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:11.170\nThat was my Windows 8.1 or\nmy Windows 8.1.wim.\n\n1803\n01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:14.318\nThat was what we were capturing and\nwhat we're actually deploying.\n\n1804\n01:28:14.318 --> 01:28:17.638\nSo that's what that is,\nspeaking of capturing.\n\n1805\n01:28:17.638 --> 01:28:20.005\nAwesome, we gotta zoom\nin on this real quick.\n\n1806\n01:28:20.005 --> 01:28:22.281\nCan we go back to my machine for\njust half a second.\n\n1807\n01:28:22.281 --> 01:28:24.119\nYou guys are gonna love this.\n\n1808\n01:28:24.119 --> 01:28:26.520\nSo what do we have here?\n\n1809\n01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.615\nImage successfully\ncaptured to primary lab.\n\n1810\n01:28:28.615 --> 01:28:32.985\nOur primary 1 lab OSD\nfiles My windows 81.wim.\n\n1811\n01:28:32.985 --> 01:28:35.633\nRemember I told you we were in\nthe process of capturing and\n\n1812\n01:28:35.633 --> 01:28:39.510\nwould finish eventually and sure enough I\njust looked over to see what was going on.\n\n1813\n01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:41.290\nI noticed a change on the graphic.\n\n1814\n01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:42.960\nWhen we finish the capture,\n\n1815\n01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.051\nthat's the one we were running on\nthe existing Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n1816\n01:28:46.051 --> 01:28:47.310\nOne already had the OS.\n\n1817\n01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:49.060\nOur reference machine, thank you.\n\n1818\n01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.770\nAnd so, on that, because I never would\nhave come up with that on my own.\n\n1819\n01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:54.570\nWould not said reference,\nI would have said, yeah, that machine.\n\n1820\n01:28:54.570 --> 01:28:57.540\nNever would I have known that\nbecause I've been doing this for\n\n1821\n01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.335\nlike 12 hours straight.\n\n1822\n01:28:59.335 --> 01:29:02.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm, like, my brain is done.\n\n1823\n01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:02.910\nSo, yes.\n\n1824\n01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:03.743\nOn the reference computer.\n\n1825\n01:29:03.743 --> 01:29:07.237\nBut what we did is now we actually let\nit run long enough that we have actually\n\n1826\n01:29:07.237 --> 01:29:08.740\nsuccessfully captured.\n\n1827\n01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.620\nSo if we click okay there,\nwe actually will rerun.\n\n1828\n01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:14.380\nOr rather, click okay and\nrestart the computer, and we're good.\n\n1829\n01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:15.850\nSo we actually did\nthe capture on that one.\n\n1830\n01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.060\nSo that one did successfully finish.\n\n1831\n01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.580\nSo that is kind of cool.\n\n1832\n01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:20.430\nAnd this one,\n\n1833\n01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:25.470\nsince we're here we'll just take a look,\nhas finished our capture there.\n\n1834\n01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:26.660\nIt's gonna do a system restart.\n\n1835\n01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:28.310\nIt's about to do a restart there.\n\n1836\n01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:29.280\nIf we don't do anything with it.\n\n1837\n01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.119\nWe'll just let that restart right now.\n\n1838\n01:29:30.119 --> 01:29:32.732\nWhy don't we take a look for\na second since we're in here anyway and\n\n1839\n01:29:32.732 --> 01:29:34.380\nthen we'll go back and we'll finish up.\n\n1840\n01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:38.301\nWouldn't it be cool if, when you saw them\ncome up with their hosting environment it\n\n1841\n01:29:38.301 --> 01:29:40.110\nwas the instead of Hyper-V?\n\n1842\n01:29:40.110 --> 01:29:41.330\nThat would be so cool.\n\n1843\n01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:42.230\n>> On the TechNet Labs show.\n\n1844\n01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:44.290\n>> On the TechNet Labs,\nthat would just be too cool for words.\n\n1845\n01:29:44.290 --> 01:29:45.890\nSo we're going to let that come back up.\n\n1846\n01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:47.180\nWe'll let that come up.\n\n1847\n01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:50.570\nWe'll give that just a second, so\nwe're on our bare metal client here.\n\n1848\n01:29:50.570 --> 01:29:54.220\nWe're waiting on it to restart, you can\nsee it here, since we're waiting on it\n\n1849\n01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:59.000\nit's gonna continue on with some system\nprocesses based on the task sequencing.\n\n1850\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.790\nBut it's probably good to\nsee what's happening there.\n\n1851\n01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.880\nGetting devices ready.\n\n1852\n01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.030\n>> And then we got that application.\n\n1853\n01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.783\nWhat did we tell it to install?\n\n1854\n01:30:05.783 --> 01:30:10.081\n>> The config manager tool kit, so you\ncan see it's actually starting to run and\n\n1855\n01:30:10.081 --> 01:30:11.681\ndo the Installation there.\n\n1856\n01:30:11.681 --> 01:30:14.431\nSo you can see it's gonna start\nrunning through its paces now.\n\n1857\n01:30:14.431 --> 01:30:19.309\nAnd, eventually if we let that run\nlong enough, we will actually have\n\n1858\n01:30:19.309 --> 01:30:23.860\na functional operating system\nthat we can log into as we said.\n\n1859\n01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:26.230\nSo we are making progress there,\nslowly but surely.\n\n1860\n01:30:26.230 --> 01:30:29.060\nThat image came down and we're starting\nto turn the machine around and\n\n1861\n01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.150\nget it organized.\n\n1862\n01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:32.116\nAnd this is what you would see\nthe first time you install Windows,\n\n1863\n01:30:32.116 --> 01:30:33.709\nif you've ever gone through that process,\nright?\n\n1864\n01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:36.377\nYou would actually see it do\na bunch of this stuff, and\n\n1865\n01:30:36.377 --> 01:30:40.010\neventually, it will come up with its\nown functional operating system.\n\n1866\n01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:43.600\nLog in, got the desktop, accept the user\nlicense agreement, do all that stuff.\n\n1867\n01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.640\nSo, we actually will see that\nfinish up at some point.\n\n1868\n01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.020\nAll right,\nif we can go back to Mike's machine,\n\n1869\n01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:50.260\nwe'll just finish our discussion on\nImage file and Installer package.\n\n1870\n01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:53.360\nSo, you're seeing the Image file happen,\nlive in real time, there.\n\n1871\n01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.563\nThe Installer package is gonna be\nused to build the reference computer.\n\n1872\n01:30:56.563 --> 01:30:59.080\nWe copy the install media.\n\n1873\n01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:02.570\nWe don't preinstall applications or\npatches, the way we do with System image.\n\n1874\n01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:07.450\nBut the installer pack will let us\nbuild the reference environment and\n\n1875\n01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:09.260\nthen capture it to create an image file.\n\n1876\n01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:09.805\nSo we can do either one.\nSo\n\n1877\n01:31:09.805 --> 01:31:11.800\nit's just a question of\nwhich one we choose to do.\n\n1878\n01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.101\nJust be aware of those.\n\n1879\n01:31:13.101 --> 01:31:17.644\nWe do have additional packages that\nwe could deploy the configuration\n\n1880\n01:31:17.644 --> 01:31:22.423\nmanager client package which is the app\npackage that installs the agent.\n\n1881\n01:31:22.423 --> 01:31:25.525\nWe could do the USMT tool\nif we want to do that,\n\n1882\n01:31:25.525 --> 01:31:30.310\nwe may as you saw do applications\nlike the config manager tool kit.\n\n1883\n01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:32.762\nYes, we have those, and we've seen those\nbefore and we know what those are.\n\n1884\n01:31:32.762 --> 01:31:35.104\nWe could deploy\nthe operating system image,\n\n1885\n01:31:35.104 --> 01:31:37.820\nkind of have a set of sequence\nsteps that we use here.\n\n1886\n01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:41.190\nAs you see,\nwe kind of summarize what we did for you.\n\n1887\n01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:44.360\nWe import the OS image\nmetadata to Config Manager.\n\n1888\n01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.770\nIt's effectively importing the information\nabout the captured .wim file.\n\n1889\n01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:49.200\nWe took a look at that and saw that.\n\n1890\n01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.100\nWe did that.\n\n1891\n01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:53.590\nWe distributed the operating system\nimage content to distribution points.\n\n1892\n01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:56.210\nThe content must be on a distribution\npoint to be able to be used.\n\n1893\n01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:57.939\nWe did that so\nwe actually have that done as well.\n\n1894\n01:31:57.939 --> 01:32:00.700\nCreated a task sequence to install the OS.\n\n1895\n01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:01.800\nSelect your deployment method.\n\n1896\n01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.362\nWe did that.\nAnd then actually deploy\n\n1897\n01:32:03.362 --> 01:32:04.509\nthe task sequence,\n\n1898\n01:32:04.509 --> 01:32:09.440\nselect an initiation method that is gonna\nbe aligned with what we've already chosen.\n\n1899\n01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.010\nWe did that as well.\nWe're running that live as we speak right\n\n1900\n01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:13.900\nnow, as a matter of fact.\n\n1901\n01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:17.520\nWhat are the methods that we can use to\nrun an installation task sequence, so\n\n1902\n01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.841\nwe can actually use\na Config Manager client.\n\n1903\n01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:23.370\nWe could deploy to a collection\nwith existing clients.\n\n1904\n01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:24.870\nIn other words we wanna do an update.\n\n1905\n01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:27.790\nWe talked about all these different\nways to do it with the diagrams we\n\n1906\n01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:28.540\ncreated, right?\n\n1907\n01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:29.090\nWe could do that.\n\n1908\n01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:30.040\nWe could do a PXE boot.\n\n1909\n01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:30.920\nYou know that we did that.\n\n1910\n01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.130\nThat's the one we're actually\ndemoing live right now.\n\n1911\n01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:36.628\nWe could use boot media, we can boot\noff a iso that's been mounted, so\n\n1912\n01:32:36.628 --> 01:32:37.532\nwe could do that.\n\n1913\n01:32:37.532 --> 01:32:39.496\nWe could do stand alone media, and\n\n1914\n01:32:39.496 --> 01:32:44.290\nstand alone media would effectively be\neverything all in one to install the OS.\n\n1915\n01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:46.790\nBoot media is like WIN PE,\nwe're just booting, and\n\n1916\n01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:48.320\nthen it's just gonna connect out remotely.\n\n1917\n01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:52.650\nAnd pull down the OS and or prestaged\nmedia that's what OEM's typically use to\n\n1918\n01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:54.296\nbe able to do their installs.\n\n1919\n01:32:54.296 --> 01:32:57.359\nRight, so that's not something\nthat we normally do, but\n\n1920\n01:32:57.359 --> 01:33:01.435\nif we were an OEM vendor we would then\nactually be able to use prestaged media.\n\n1921\n01:33:01.435 --> 01:33:04.262\nAnd then I believe we finally have\ntroubleshooting the operating system\n\n1922\n01:33:04.262 --> 01:33:04.825\ndeployment.\n\n1923\n01:33:04.825 --> 01:33:09.024\nWe did as we always try to do, put up some\ntroubleshooting tips for you in terms of\n\n1924\n01:33:09.024 --> 01:33:13.180\nlog files and reports and things like\nthat that you'd want to be aware of.\n\n1925\n01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:18.820\nThe log to take a look at MS,\nMSS, SMS, TS.log.\n\n1926\n01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:24.890\nThat is gonna be where we can go and\ntake a look at overall information.\n\n1927\n01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:27.972\nIf the task sequence completes\nwhile we're in WIN PE,\n\n1928\n01:33:27.972 --> 01:33:30.526\nthe logs located in\nthe SMSTS log directory.\n\n1929\n01:33:30.526 --> 01:33:33.320\nIf it completes while\nwe're in the deployed OS,\n\n1930\n01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:36.810\nwe look in the CCM install directory and\nthen the logs files.\n\n1931\n01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:38.200\nSo I gave you both options.\n\n1932\n01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.916\nBecause it depends on what we're doing and\nwhere we are.\n\n1933\n01:33:39.916 --> 01:33:43.230\nThe CCMSetup.log could be used as well.\n\n1934\n01:33:43.230 --> 01:33:46.110\nWe have a bunch of different report\ncategories we can look at on\n\n1935\n01:33:46.110 --> 01:33:47.480\nTask Sequence there.\n\n1936\n01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:49.200\nSo I just wanna be aware of that.\n\n1937\n01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:53.930\nAnd we also want to know, as I said and as\nI pointed out in the information up above,\n\n1938\n01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:56.740\nfor if the Task Sequence\nis completing in Win PE.\n\n1939\n01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:58.854\nAnd I pointed out we\nwere using the X drive.\n\n1940\n01:33:58.854 --> 01:34:01.340\nWe're using a RAM drive as we load that.\n\n1941\n01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:05.308\nAll that log information is loaded\ninto memory when we're in Win PE.\n\n1942\n01:34:05.308 --> 01:34:08.780\nAnd we made a reference to the fact\nthat we lose that when we restart.\n\n1943\n01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:09.900\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1944\n01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:14.590\nObviously if we want to be able to take\na look at that, we'll want to go in and\n\n1945\n01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:16.870\ntake a look at that\ninside the environment.\n\n1946\n01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:19.787\nWe have to enable command line\nsupport on the boot image.\n\n1947\n01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:22.580\nAnd we actually went in and\ntook a look at how to do that.\n\n1948\n01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:25.880\nWhen we're editing the boot image and\nwe would then be able to hit F8 and\n\n1949\n01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.430\nlaunch a command prompt in there and\nactually then be able to go in and\n\n1950\n01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:29.990\nread that log file if we have to, so.\n\n1951\n01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:33.050\nWe just talk about how to do\nthat down at the bottom there.\n\n1952\n01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:33.614\nAll right, very good.\n\n1953\n01:34:33.614 --> 01:34:38.580\nI was gonna just finally give you one more\nlook at it it'sstill doing the get ready.\n\n1954\n01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:40.820\nIt's gonna be doing get ready for\nawhile cuz it has to prep everything.\n\n1955\n01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:42.790\nSo it's probably not gonna\nbe able to show you.\n\n1956\n01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:44.630\nI was kind of hoping we\ncould show you the desktop.\n\n1957\n01:34:44.630 --> 01:34:47.870\nYou'd figure that would be kind of cool,\nbut unfortunately that's just not\n\n1958\n01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:52.820\nprobably gonna come up, but you've seen us\ngo end to end, other than just actually\n\n1959\n01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:56.980\nputting the ball across the finish line to\nshow you a log on on a completed image.\n\n1960\n01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:59.590\nBut we are actually in process right now.\n\n1961\n01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:03.220\nIf you wanted to stick around for\nabout another hour and just watch that,\n\n1962\n01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:06.650\nwe'll put it up on the screen while\nMike and I go and grab a beer, and\n\n1963\n01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:10.170\nthen you will come back you guys,\ncan tell us how it was.\n\n1964\n01:35:10.170 --> 01:35:11.540\nWe'll tell you how our beer was.\n\n1965\n01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:13.290\nI think we're gonna have\na lot more fun than you.\n\n1966\n01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:14.530\n>> I think so.\n>> I'm just guessing,\n\n1967\n01:35:14.530 --> 01:35:16.400\nbut that is an option for you.\n\n1968\n01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:19.222\nBut, we basically have gone end to end\non the operating system deployment.\n\n1969\n01:35:19.222 --> 01:35:24.370\nTalked through and shown you how to\ndo it from start to finish, right?\n\n1970\n01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:26.550\n>> Very good.\nYeah, like we said at the beginning,\n\n1971\n01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:27.860\nit was fun and exciting.\n\n1972\n01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:28.970\nHopefully you guys agree with me there,\nright?\n\n1973\n01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:30.757\n>> Especially the part in\nthe middle where we broke it and\n\n1974\n01:35:30.757 --> 01:35:32.433\ncouldn't figure out what\nthe hell to do to fix it.\n\n1975\n01:35:32.433 --> 01:35:34.233\nThat was really a lot of fun.\n\n1976\n01:35:34.233 --> 01:35:35.270\n>> That was.\n\n1977\n01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:36.699\nBut got it fixed in the end.\n\n1978\n01:35:36.699 --> 01:35:37.350\n>> We did.\n>> We did.\n\n1979\n01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:40.770\nAll right, well, thank you,\nAdam, for all of that.\n\n1980\n01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:43.360\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n1981\n01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.860\nRemember, if you wanna attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n1982\n01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:49.580\nshoot us an email here\nat

[LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n1986\n01:35:53.996 --> 01:35:54.983\n>> Take care everybody.\n\n1987\n01:35:54.983 --> 01:36:00.446\n[SOUND]\n\n",

episode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.338\nThat's right, we're gonna have you\ndoing all kinds of cool things today.\n\n5\n00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:23.210\n[LAUGH] Another action-packed\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.850\nToday we're doing our System Center\nConfiguration Manager 2012 R2,\n\n7\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.292\nand in this episode specifically we're\ngonna be looking at managing software.\n\n8\n00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:34.870\nWe wanna be able to\ndeploy out applications,\n\n9\n00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.042\npackages, programs, and\nthere's a lot to it.\n\n10\n00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:40.730\nWe've gotta get those packages and\nprograms created,\n\n11\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.380\nwe've got to set up distribution points so\nwe can get them out to end systems.\n\n12\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.240\nAnd here to help us get all that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon, how are you doing, Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.660\n>> Good,\nI feel like I should do a handstand or\n\n14\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.650\nsomething and\nget in that action-packed mood.\n\n15\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.197\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe put on my action-packed cape or\n\n16\n00:00:55.197 --> 00:00:56.670\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n17\n00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.520\n>> Yeah, I had to change it\nup just a little bit for you.\n\n18\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.730\n>> You did, you caught me off guard there,\nI was not expecting that.\n\n19\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.670\nI'm doing well, hopefully everybody\nout there is doing well as well,\n\n20\n00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.440\nbecause you're well, and so are we.\n\n21\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.160\nWe are all well.\n\n22\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.730\n>> All is well.\n\n23\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.320\n>> All is well.\n\n24\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.589\nLet's talk about how we maintain and\nhow we actually are going to create\n\n25\n00:01:15.589 --> 00:01:20.213\nthe opportunity for us to take all the\nthings we've been doing up until now and\n\n26\n00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:23.131\npush those forward into\none of the final phases,\n\n27\n00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:27.220\none of the final stages of what we\nactually deploy this product for.\n\n28\n00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.516\nWhich is to figure out how to deploy,\nas Mike had said, software,\n\n29\n00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:34.420\napplications, packages, etc.\n\n30\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.240\nThat is the whole, if you will, area or\n\n31\n00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240\nall the different things that we can do\ntogether, we're gonna break those down and\n\n32\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.350\ntalk about the individual parts,\nwhat's a package,\n\n33\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.630\nwhat's an application, how do we deploy\nthose things, why are they important.\n\n34\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.540\nWe're gonna do all of that.\n\n35\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.670\n>> And then some.\n\n36\n00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.250\n>> No, we're gonna do all of that well.\n\n37\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.180\n>> Well.\n>> Well.\n\n38\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.260\n>> We're gonna do that well.\n\n39\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260\n>> We gotta work on our prompts here,\nwe're a little bit off today after lunch.\n\n40\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.110\n>> Try it again.\n\n41\n00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.252\n>> We're gonna do all of that.\n\n42\n00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:00.940\n>> Well.\n[LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.670\n>> There you go, outstanding.\n\n44\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.270\nAll right so, we are gonna talk about all\nthat and what we wanna do is we have done,\n\n45\n00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.490\nin many of our prior episodes,\nwe're gonna mix and match a little bit, do\n\n46\n00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.240\na little bit of discussion, kinda get you\nthinking about the things we have to do.\n\n47\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.090\nGive you some of the general background,\nthe baselines if you will,\n\n48\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.850\nof information that help you to\nunderstand what we're gonna show you.\n\n49\n00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.730\nAnd then we're gonna go\ninto the environment,\n\n50\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.460\nwe're gonna do all of this live.\n\n51\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.120\nWe're gonna go ahead and deploy,\nor at least attempt to, anyway.\n\n52\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.090\nWe'll see how that goes,\nyou never know for sure.\n\n53\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.220\nBut in theory, if all works out.\n\n54\n00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.710\n>> Well.\n>> We will go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.160\nwe will deploy applications,\n\n56\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.490\nwe'll take a look at how to set up and\npush out WinZip and some of those things.\n\n57\n00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.240\nJust small programs,\nbut we'll go ahead and\n\n58\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.820\nwe'll do that just to give you a sense.\n\n59\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.660\nI'm also gonna reach back\nto a prior episode and\n\n60\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.260\nwe're gonna have a little\nmomentary flash back if you will,\n\n61\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.890\nshow you a future we talked\nabout in a prior episode.\n\n62\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.560\nBut, give you a little update on the fact\nthat, although I mentioned that we can do\n\n63\n00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.000\nsomething, I realized afterwards I didn't\nactually show you how to do the very,\n\n64\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.980\nvery last step in the process.\n\n65\n00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.790\nI want to go back and just update you on\nthat, make sure you're comfortable with\n\n66\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.480\nthat last piece, cuz I think it\nactually will be valuable for you.\n\n67\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.980\nSo have a little extra added bonus\nsurprise there, cuz we wanna treat you.\n\n68\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.940\n>> Well.\n\n69\n00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.130\n>> Always, and so we'll be doing that.\n\n70\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.460\nI have,\nthen as we are finishing up with all that,\n\n71\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.570\nas we always do, in addition we're\ngonna take you out on the web,\n\n72\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.250\ngive you a little guided tour with\na couple of websites that may be valuable\n\n73\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.515\nfor resources, and valuable for\nreference material.\n\n74\n00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:26.785\nHelp you to get ready for the exam, also\nhelp you to form that additional knowledge\n\n75\n00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:30.315\nbase as you're looking at this material,\ntrying to figure it out in the new world.\n\n76\n00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:33.563\nSo we're gonna do all of that and then as\nsoon as we get all that done I'm gonna be\n\n77\n00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:37.157\ntired so I'm gonna sit down and take\na break cuz that's a lot of stuff to do.\n\n78\n00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:38.277\nSo let's get started shall we?\n\n79\n00:03:38.277 --> 00:03:41.607\nSo let's talk a little bit about packages,\nlet's talk about applications,\n\n80\n00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:43.747\nlet's talk about all of\nthe things that go into that.\n\n81\n00:03:43.747 --> 00:03:46.507\nWhat I'd like to do is move over\nto Mike's machine if we could.\n\n82\n00:03:46.507 --> 00:03:48.277\nWe're gonna put up some\nstuff he has there.\n\n83\n00:03:48.277 --> 00:03:50.837\nActually wanna go to the web site that\nwe just brought up right before we\n\n84\n00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:51.707\ngot started.\n\n85\n00:03:51.707 --> 00:03:55.750\nSo the first thing we wanna\nshow you there is what\n\n86\n00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.540\nI did is had Mike just go out to Google,\ndo you still have the Google search up?\n\n87\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.290\n>> I could probably go back to it.\n\n88\n00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.330\n>> Okay, so\nwe're just gonna do that real quick so\n\n89\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.970\nyou can see what Mike actually wrote out\nthere and if we zoom in we could see it.\n\n90\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.780\nI had them go ahead and\n\n91\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.740\nGoogle, I hate those pop ups,\nsoftware deployment sccm 2012.\n\n92\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.430\nRemember we always add-on, or at least\nI've been telling you, in all of our\n\n93\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.830\nepisodes as we go out to the web that we\nshould always try to add on that reference\n\n94\n00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.510\nto the product specifically, so we get\nthe right information the first time.\n\n95\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.980\nSoftware deployment sccm 2012.\n\n96\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.120\nWhen we do that,\nthe first link that comes up,\n\n97\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.360\nhow to deploy applications\nin config manager.\n\n98\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.630\nMike has clicked on that, he will do so\nagain and then what we see there\n\n99\n00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.170\nis the Technet reference from\nthe system center, Technet text center.\n\n100\n00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.730\nAnd what we then see is that that is\ngoing to be able to walk us through\n\n101\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.610\nnot just how to deploy an a application,\nhow to delete an application deployment,\n\n102\n00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.530\nset it up,\ndo all the stuff you need to do.\n\n103\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.154\nBut on the left if you could\nzoom in on the navbar there,\n\n104\n00:04:52.154 --> 00:04:54.260\nand maybe just go in a little bit and\nmove over.\n\n105\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.945\nYou'll see that we have,\nwhich is why I picked this link and\n\n106\n00:04:56.945 --> 00:05:01.640\nI think it's helpful for you, underneath\nthe operations and maintenance for\n\n107\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.690\napp management in config manager, how to\ncreate applications, how to create and\n\n108\n00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.280\ndeploy applications for\nthe Mac, specifically.\n\n109\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.880\nSo if we need guidance on the Mac,\n\n110\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.630\nlittle bit different than the standard\nprocess we're gonna engage in demo here.\n\n111\n00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.505\nIt's gonna be valuable to go in and\ndrill down and read up on that.\n\n112\n00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:18.950\nHow to simulate an app\ndeployment in config manager.\n\n113\n00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.800\nWe'll be talking about that and talk about\nthe what if or the simulated deployment.\n\n114\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.860\nThe link we're using there,\nhow to manage applications and\n\n115\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.940\ndeployment types in config manager.\n\n116\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.250\nHow manage application revisioning,\nwe'll talk a little bit about that.\n\n117\n00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.930\nHow to use apps supersedence, so\nwe can actually put something out there.\n\n118\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.960\nAnd the difference between revision and\nsupersedence is important.\n\n119\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.580\nYou can read up on it there, but\ngenerically, the idea of being able to\n\n120\n00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.220\ngo ahead and do a revision,\nwhich is simply just an update and\n\n121\n00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.790\nsay oh, I wanna put this package out\nin place of the one that's there.\n\n122\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.160\nAnd I'm gonna effectively\njust update it and\n\n123\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.980\nrevise it in some way,\nversus supersedence,\n\n124\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.120\nthe idea that I wanna remove that older\nversions and put out a newer version.\n\n125\n00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.990\nSo we can think about those things and\nmanage those in different ways.\n\n126\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.550\nSo we have all that information.\n\n127\n00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.050\nHow to uninstall apps, so\nwe can reach out and do an install, but\n\n128\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.880\nalso do an uninstall.\n\n129\n00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.580\nWe have to use a package for\nboth, by the way.\n\n130\n00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.070\nA lot of people don't realize that we\ncan do uninstalls, but we do it by\n\n131\n00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.090\npackaging up the uninstall application and\nrunning it, in effect, in reverse.\n\n132\n00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.700\nSo we create the package and\ndeploy the package to do the uninstall,\n\n133\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.370\nat least if we wanna do it automated\nthrough the SCCM interface.\n\n134\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.090\nSo we have all that.\n\n135\n00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.740\nHow to manage user device\naffinity is there.\n\n136\n00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.450\nHow to create global conditions.\n\n137\n00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.325\nHow to do App-V virtual\nenvironment configuration.\n\n138\n00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:34.505\nHow to create and deploy apps for\n\n139\n00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:38.325\nmobile devices, a whole separate\ncategory we have to think about there.\n\n140\n00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:41.395\nAnd how to control apps using mobile\napplication management policies.\n\n141\n00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:43.485\nSo all of the things that we\nwould wanna know how to do.\n\n142\n00:06:43.485 --> 00:06:45.657\nAnd we're not gonna be able\nto demo through all of that,\n\n143\n00:06:45.657 --> 00:06:47.907\nthat would take over a day.\n\n144\n00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:51.597\nLiterally, just to go through and\nsetup and run through in the depth and\n\n145\n00:06:51.597 --> 00:06:54.497\nthe detail that we go into in these demos.\n\n146\n00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:58.420\nAnd so what we want to do is to show\nyou how to find that information,\n\n147\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.590\ngive you the maximum amount of\ninformation that's possible so\n\n148\n00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.950\nthat you can obviously use it as\na reference point certainly, but\n\n149\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.630\nyou can also use it to prepare if you\nare gonna go out and pursue the exam.\n\n150\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.460\nYou can read through and\n\n151\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.250\nstudy up on the objectives that you\nfeel you need a little work on.\n\n152\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.540\nSo that's gonna be a good valuable\nresource for all of our members out there\n\n153\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.130\nin the studio audience, so\nhopefully you'll find that to be valuable.\n\n154\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.950\nI know Michael will make sure we make\nthat available along with all the other\n\n155\n00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.130\nURLs that we've been putting\nout that are important for you.\n\n156\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.850\nAll right, so if we can go to\nthe actual listing now, perfect.\n\n157\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.520\nSo, can we zoom in just a little bit,\nmake that a little bit bigger and maybe,\n\n158\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.730\nyeah I'm kinda covering a little bit\non the words, yeah but now it's still,\n\n159\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:34.970\nokay there we go that's better.\n\n160\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.080\nWe just have to adjust that screen size so\n\n161\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.900\nyou can see it while we can still\nmake sure it's on the screen.\n\n162\n00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.587\nSo when we think about starting out here,\nwhat we wanna do is first of all think\n\n163\n00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:48.389\nabout how to create a package, set it up\nand just walk through the steps involved\n\n164\n00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:52.004\nwith it, we're gonna do this live as I\nsaid just to give you a heads up here.\n\n165\n00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:56.320\nThe idea of being able\nto set up the package is\n\n166\n00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.986\nreally the idea of being\nable to package up, and\n\n167\n00:08:00.986 --> 00:08:08.219\nI hate to use a word to describe a word\nbut So we're packaging the objects or\n\n168\n00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:13.005\nputting together all\nthe objects that represent\n\n169\n00:08:13.005 --> 00:08:17.788\nthe actual files that\nthe client is gonna require\n\n170\n00:08:17.788 --> 00:08:22.730\nto run the program that\nwe wanna actually deploy.\n\n171\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.520\nAnd so, the package, you could think\nof it as being, basically, the wrapper\n\n172\n00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.770\nthat's gonna contain all the things that\nare necessary to do the deployment, and\n\n173\n00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.810\nto structure it and control it.\n\n174\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:35.210\nAnd so, this is what\nthe package is gonna represent.\n\n175\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.510\nAnd, as we go through, and we will be\ntaking a look in a few minutes at this,\n\n176\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.990\nin the Config Manger console, we go\ninto the Software library workspace, and\n\n177\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.100\nwe can see we have both Application and\nPackage sub-items.\n\n178\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.160\nAnd on the Package area,\nwe go in and we create a package.\n\n179\n00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.490\nThe package has the general and\n\n180\n00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.910\ndata source information,\nthe program types, the requirements,\n\n181\n00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.600\nthe estimated disk space that's gonna\nbe required for the deployment.\n\n182\n00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.640\nWhether it's gonna be\na standardized program,\n\n183\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.880\nwe're gonna specify maybe some additional\nrun line, parameters and options so\n\n184\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.520\nI have the ability to see all that.\n\n185\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.332\nAnd then once we have that,\nwe create that package and then,\n\n186\n00:09:12.332 --> 00:09:15.440\nwe are able to deploy that\nif we choose to, right?\n\n187\n00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.680\nSo we'll take a look at that and\nsee how that goes.\n\n188\n00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.660\nSo we've got that.\n\n189\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.000\nWe have another one that we set up for\neverybody as well,\n\n190\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.600\nwhich is to create a program.\n\n191\n00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.750\nRemember the program is gonna be\nthe command or the group of commands and\n\n192\n00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.940\nthe information that indicates\nhow to manage the package files.\n\n193\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.230\nSo this is what's gonna actually be used,\nwe're to specify a name for\n\n194\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.350\nthe program, specify the command line,\n\n195\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:39.610\nthe requirements, the environment,\nthe advanced settings if there are any,\n\n196\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.110\nwhether we're gonna import\nthe Windows Installer product information.\n\n197\n00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.980\nIf there is an MSI file or a windows\ninstaller file that the manufacturer\n\n198\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.175\nmay have provided to us,\nwe can import that, pre-populate all that.\n\n199\n00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:54.585\nOh, look, it's from Microsoft,\nit's this version number, this build,\n\n200\n00:09:54.585 --> 00:09:55.935\nall that stuff we may wanna put in.\n\n201\n00:09:55.935 --> 00:09:58.135\nBut we may not have the time, patience, or\n\n202\n00:09:58.135 --> 00:10:00.765\nknowledge, cuz we may not know\nit to actually type it all out.\n\n203\n00:10:00.765 --> 00:10:04.765\nWe can import that in a file in effect\nif the vendor gives that to us.\n\n204\n00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:08.955\nAnd then if we are gonna be linking up\nto System Center Operations Manager,\n\n205\n00:10:08.955 --> 00:10:13.440\nwhat's called SCOM, then, we can specify\nthe Op Manager maintenance mode settings,\n\n206\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.760\nso that we can put the system in\nthe maintenance mode to do the deployment.\n\n207\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.790\nAnd not have the system go all hay wire\nand crazy when we're monitoring it, so\n\n208\n00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.830\nwe can allow their maintenance windows and\ntheir SLAs, so we choose to do that.\n\n209\n00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.350\nSo we're able to do that\nwith our programs, so\n\n210\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.030\nwe'll be taking a look at that as well.\n\n211\n00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.611\nAnd then we have the need to go in and\n\n212\n00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:34.087\nfigure out how to set up\na distribution point.\n\n213\n00:10:34.087 --> 00:10:38.459\nThe distribution point is a site\nserver system role that is deployed,\n\n214\n00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:43.219\nthat allows us to effectively ship all\nof the programs, the applications.\n\n215\n00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:46.886\nAll the stuff we wanna actually send out,\nwe send it there and then that\n\n216\n00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:51.530\nbecomes out central point of distribution,\nhence the name, distribution point.\n\n217\n00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:56.110\nSo we are going to effectively deploy\nthe software to the distribution point,\n\n218\n00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.450\nonce it's configured.\n\n219\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.940\nAnd then,\nwe can have multiple distribution points.\n\n220\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.330\nMaybe one or more than one, but\nwhatever that particular story is,\n\n221\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.790\nwe'll choose the distribution point or\npoints we want to deploy to.\n\n222\n00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.310\nWe'll talk about what's known\nas a distribution point group,\n\n223\n00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.210\nwhich is really just putting one or\nmore distribution points together\n\n224\n00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.515\nfrom an administrator\nstandpoint to make it easier.\n\n225\n00:11:16.515 --> 00:11:19.564\nInstead of having to check off 20\nboxes that deployed all these,\n\n226\n00:11:19.564 --> 00:11:22.730\nI just grab the group like a distribution\ngroup would be in exchange.\n\n227\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.200\nWe wanna email a bunch of people\ninstead of addressing it individually.\n\n228\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.790\nWe'll just check off our selected\ndistribution point group and\n\n229\n00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.140\nsay, deployed all of\nthe members of the group.\n\n230\n00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.820\nSo it's just a time saving device.\n\n231\n00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.280\nSo, I'll quickly show\nyou how to set that up.\n\n232\n00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.765\nI am never gonna basically put\nyour software out there and\n\n233\n00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:38.655\nthen have it set up.\n\n234\n00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:42.834\nAnd then, at that point, based on what we\nalready know about client settings and\n\n235\n00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:46.953\nmanaging software deployment, and\nmanaging, updating both user and machine\n\n236\n00:11:46.953 --> 00:11:50.958\npolicy intervals and all that, then we\ncan actually push that software out.\n\n237\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.685\nAnd over a period of time,\ndepending on how long it takes, and\n\n238\n00:11:53.685 --> 00:11:56.518\ncertain circumstances,\nwhether we set it to run immediately,\n\n239\n00:11:56.518 --> 00:11:59.470\nmaybe we scheduled it for\na maintenance window based deployment.\n\n240\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.980\nSo it's gonna effectively get\nqueued up for several hours.\n\n241\n00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.890\nA lot of different things\nwe may have going on there,\n\n242\n00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.880\nwe will eventually see\nthe software deploy.\n\n243\n00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.910\nAnd so we're gonna use those\ndistribution points both locally,\n\n244\n00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.620\nwhat we call on-prem there.\n\n245\n00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.500\nWe remember, we can have them in the cloud\nalthough we're not gonna get in to have it\n\n246\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.720\nset them up in the cloud or\nwhat to do, it all run through here.\n\n247\n00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.670\nYou could read up on that on the Internet,\non the websites that we've sent you to.\n\n248\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.530\nBut, we could set up distribution\npoints now in 2012 R2 using the cloud.\n\n249\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.750\nSo we can manage as external\ncloud-based resources and\n\n250\n00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.950\nhave them pull their software down from\noutside the organizational boundary.\n\n251\n00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.490\nAnd still be able to do the installation\nwithout having to worry about bailiff\n\n252\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.123\nconsiderations.\n\n253\n00:12:35.123 --> 00:12:36.176\n[CROSSTALK] So it's gonna be\n>> Very nice.\n\n254\n00:12:36.176 --> 00:12:37.340\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> No matter where they are,\n\n255\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.490\nas long as they're\nconnected to the Internet,\n\n256\n00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.950\nthey could get that software\nto pull it to them.\n\n257\n00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:40.500\n>> Absolutely.\n\n258\n00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.040\n>> Fantastic.\n>> Absolutely, so we're gonna have that,\n\n259\n00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.590\nso we're gonna be able to walk through.\n\n260\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.460\nSo, we'll see those building blocks.\n\n261\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.330\nAnd, then, we have one more,\n\n262\n00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.410\nI believe, that we wanna just\ntake a look at here quickly.\n\n263\n00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.290\nSo, install and configuration of the\ndistribution point, kinda what happens,\n\n264\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.018\nwe've already got the distribution\npoint set up in our lab environment,\n\n265\n00:12:56.018 --> 00:12:57.730\nit's a site role we've added it in.\n\n266\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.470\nSo, there's really not a lot of mystery\nthere, but I did wanna just show you,\n\n267\n00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.340\nmore or less, what the steps look like.\n\n268\n00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.080\nI'll show you what the role is,\nand how it's configured.\n\n269\n00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.800\nBut this way you'll be able to, at least,\nhave a sense of what goes on with it.\n\n270\n00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.120\nWe go to the site and\nsystem container, servers, rather,\n\n271\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.500\non the administration workspace.\n\n272\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.430\nWe go into the service and\nsite system role container.\n\n273\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.220\nWe highlight the site server, this case,\nit's our primary site server.\n\n274\n00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.550\nWe see the site rolls down below as\nwe've seen with some of the other\n\n275\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.508\ndemos we've done, where we set up\nthe reporting point, for instance.\n\n276\n00:13:28.508 --> 00:13:32.280\nSo, we right-click install site role,\nchoose distribution point, and\n\n277\n00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.090\nthen these are just the screens in\nthe wizard that we have to, basically,\n\n278\n00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.720\nanswer and, or provide.\n\n279\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.210\nWhat's the name in the side code that we\nwanna associate distribution point with,\n\n280\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.330\nif we have proxy settings,\nright, we have to put those in.\n\n281\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:48.965\nSelect the distribution point site\nsystem role within the wizard.\n\n282\n00:13:48.965 --> 00:13:52.855\nSo what role do we want, so we're gonna\ndo that, then what are our communication\n\n283\n00:13:52.855 --> 00:13:57.038\noptions, storage options,\nthe pull distribution point options.\n\n284\n00:13:57.038 --> 00:13:59.870\nPXE and multi-cast settings,\nwe're gonna be doing imaging.\n\n285\n00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.800\nWe'll need that.\n\n286\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.000\nContent validation options,\nboundary group associations, we know about\n\n287\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.860\nmost of these things already, and so\nwe set all that up and configure all that.\n\n288\n00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.600\nAnd then once we have that all done,\n\n289\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.880\nthen the role is actually what\nwe call instantiated or setup.\n\n290\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.760\nAnd then we're, pretty simple, rather,\n\n291\n00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.310\nit's pretty simple it's\npretty straightforward.\n\n292\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.850\nWe're ready to go, we're gonna take\na look at just what those settings are.\n\n293\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.810\nWe'll bring up the properties areas so\nyou could just see those and\n\n294\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.290\nat least be aware of them.\n\n295\n00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.560\nAnd then we'll take a look,\nonce we're done with that,\n\n296\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.185\nwe'll talk a little bit about\nmonitoring and status updates,\n\n297\n00:14:28.185 --> 00:14:30.805\nand go through some of the other\nstuff we set up on that list for you.\n\n298\n00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:34.155\nSo, let's go ahead and switch over,\nif we could, to my machine.\n\n299\n00:14:34.155 --> 00:14:35.115\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\n\n300\n00:14:35.115 --> 00:14:37.845\nwe're gonna get started with taking\na look at some of this, okay?\n\n301\n00:14:37.845 --> 00:14:41.895\nSo, [COUGH] as you join me and\nmy machine, and you can see oh,\n\n302\n00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:44.110\nno, I gotta go the other way.\n\n303\n00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.560\nYou can see, isn't that cool?\n\n304\n00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.068\nLook, I'm waving underneath the machine,\nand actually if you look,\n\n305\n00:14:50.068 --> 00:14:51.175\nif I'm like [INAUDIBLE] holding\nI'm going the other way.\n\n306\n00:14:51.175 --> 00:14:55.750\nIf I do this right over here I'm actually,\nthose pictures like far enough away from\n\n307\n00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.270\nthe Eiffel tower you do one of these and\nyour finger's on top of it, so\n\n308\n00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.060\nI'm holding up, right, I'm actually\nholding up my chin right here.\n\n309\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.040\n>> Forced perspective.\n\n310\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.770\n>> Forced perspective.\n\n311\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.788\nI'm holding up the console right here,\nas you can see.\n\n312\n00:15:04.788 --> 00:15:06.394\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so what we're gonna do,\n\n313\n00:15:06.394 --> 00:15:09.018\nI did that with the Taj Mahal,\nactually, when I was in India, yeah.\n\n314\n00:15:09.018 --> 00:15:12.780\nLike you said, we did the tourist tour\nthing from the hotel when I was there,\n\n315\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.220\nwith one of the guys I was working with.\n\n316\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.270\nAnd it was, yeah, we were in Delhi, we're\ngonna digress by the way for a minute, so\n\n317\n00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:21.520\njust kick back, grab a soda, have some\ncoffee, it's a cool little story.\n\n318\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.670\nWe're staying in Delhi,\nthey're working for\n\n319\n00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.340\nMicrosoft where they're on a long trip.\n\n320\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.570\nAnd so we have a day off,\nthe only day off on the whole trip.\n\n321\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:30.710\nWell, what are we gonna do?\n\n322\n00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.420\nSo, we say, well, let's go to Taj Mahal,\n\n323\n00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.890\nhow often are you in India,\nhow do you get to go to Taj Mahal?\n\n324\n00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.870\nSo we hire a car, we do the whole thing.\n\n325\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.730\nSo it's a day trip,\n\n326\n00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.840\nbecause literally you're going, in the\nUnited States we would call them states.\n\n327\n00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.930\nYou're going three or four states in\neffect, over, to get to Uttar Pardesh,\n\n328\n00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.260\nwhere the Taj is.\n\n329\n00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.960\nSo it took us about four hours each way,\nso we hire a driver from the hotel,\n\n330\n00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.379\ntakes us out there, and we do all\nthe touristy things along the way.\n\n331\n00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:58.518\nWe stop at the Redford and all the other\nstuff, and so we finally get there, and\n\n332\n00:15:58.518 --> 00:16:02.595\nwhen you get to the Holy City where\nthe Taj Mahal is, you cannot drive Within,\n\n333\n00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:05.477\nI think it's about a mile or\na mile and a half of the Taj,\n\n334\n00:16:05.477 --> 00:16:08.500\nthere's no cars allowed\nbecause of the pollution.\n\n335\n00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.040\n>> Okay.\n>> Because the pollution has gotten so\n\n336\n00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.000\nbad, the auto emissions and stuff, that\nit's actually destroying the building.\n\n337\n00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.740\nAnd so they stop you, there's a border\nset up, a boundary that they put up.\n\n338\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.789\nAnd then the only way to get\nin is either to walk in, or\n\n339\n00:16:19.789 --> 00:16:22.560\nto take what's called a click-clack,\nwhich is a horse and cart.\n\n340\n00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.240\n>> Oh, nice.\n\n341\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.125\n>> And so, you jump in, they're all\nwaiting for you like little taxis.\n\n342\n00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:27.630\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n343\n00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.340\n>> You take one of these things\nabout a mile and a half in,\n\n344\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.092\nthey dump you right at the front,\nthen you can walk in.\n\n345\n00:16:31.092 --> 00:16:34.089\nBut because if you do with\nthe click-clack drivers,\n\n346\n00:16:34.089 --> 00:16:36.340\nit's the whole tourist scam thing.\n\n347\n00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.526\nSo okay, so hey let me take you in\nthere and I'll get you the tickets,\n\n348\n00:16:38.526 --> 00:16:39.450\nwhole nine yards.\n\n349\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.720\nSo they stand you up right at\nthe place where you can do,\n\n350\n00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.450\nonce you get inside the wall,\nwhere you can do the picture.\n\n351\n00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.290\nAnd the driver says, oh,\nlet me take the picture for\n\n352\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.386\nyou so you have the souvenir picture.\n\n353\n00:16:48.386 --> 00:16:50.500\nCuz they want you to give them\na couple of bucks, which is fine.\n\n354\n00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.179\nSo, they did the picture.\n\n355\n00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:55.140\nSo I actually have the picture\nof me doing like this and\n\n356\n00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.140\nthe whole things is right\nunderneath my hand.\n\n357\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.620\n>> Right.\n>> You see me from that perspective,\n\n358\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.250\nso it's kind of cool.\n\n359\n00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.920\nSo it has nothing to do\nwith what we're doing here.\n\n360\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.667\nAnd in case you were not interested,\nI'm sorry,\n\n361\n00:17:03.667 --> 00:17:05.092\nwe just wasted two minutes of your life.\n\n362\n00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:07.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you're never gonna get them back.\n\n363\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.910\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about what we're doing here.\n\n364\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.719\nSo I did mention that one of the things\nwe'd do, just to get started,\n\n365\n00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:15.051\nwould be actually to reach\nbackwards to a prior episode.\n\n366\n00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:18.289\nAnd quickly demo one little\nfeature item that I mentioned but\n\n367\n00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:20.100\nwe did not get a chance to do.\n\n368\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.970\nSo I'm gonna do that for you now before we\nkick off the actual software discussion.\n\n369\n00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.350\nSo let me just zoom in so\nyou could see where we are here.\n\n370\n00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.840\nAnd what we're doing,\nwe're in the Administration workspace,\n\n371\n00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.620\nas you can see, I'm in Client Settings.\n\n372\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.842\nAnd this came up in the prior\nepisodes when I mentioned this.\n\n373\n00:17:35.842 --> 00:17:40.344\nAnd I said hey, we could create a set\nof customized client settings and\n\n374\n00:17:40.344 --> 00:17:43.716\nknock off the original if you will,\ncreate our own.\n\n375\n00:17:43.716 --> 00:17:46.624\nAnd I did this as a demo and a few of\nthe people out in the audience said wow,\n\n376\n00:17:46.624 --> 00:17:47.770\nthat was kinda cool.\n\n377\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.850\nDidn't know we could do that,\nthat would be great,\n\n378\n00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.070\nI could use that to drive\na bunch of deployments.\n\n379\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.050\nSo that would be cool.\n\n380\n00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.140\nSo we did all that and I mentioned well\nyeah, then all you do is simply go in and\n\n381\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.630\ndeploy that to the collection or\ncollections that you want to use it on.\n\n382\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.426\nBut I didn't actually show you how\nto do that, I just said you could.\n\n383\n00:18:02.426 --> 00:18:06.058\nAnd I realized afterwards, oh, I probably\nshould've taken the extra two minutes and\n\n384\n00:18:06.058 --> 00:18:08.744\nshowed that to you so you would be\nable to complete that circle and\n\n385\n00:18:08.744 --> 00:18:09.760\nreally understand it.\n\n386\n00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.540\nSo I'm gonna quickly show\nthat to you right now just so\n\n387\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.990\nyou understand how to do that.\n\n388\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.620\nThat was cool, as I zoomed out,\nwe actually had that,\n\n389\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.750\nI didn't even have to do the whole signal\nthing, it just happened right away.\n\n390\n00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.860\nWe've got that synergy developing here,\nthat's what's going on.\n\n391\n00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.778\nSo what we can do is we can select,\nand I'm gonna zoom back in so\n\n392\n00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:28.884\nyou can see this in a second,\nwe'll select our custom settings.\n\n393\n00:18:28.884 --> 00:18:33.249\nAnd when we do that,\nwe can right-click on them, and\n\n394\n00:18:33.249 --> 00:18:36.260\nI will just highlight so you can see.\n\n395\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.926\nAnd as I right-click and I do that,\nwe can, you'll see there, choose,\n\n396\n00:18:40.926 --> 00:18:45.668\nlet me just just move over so that you\ncan see that I've highlighted it, and\n\n397\n00:18:45.668 --> 00:18:47.580\nwe can choose Deploy.\n\n398\n00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.693\nAnd by doing that we're effectively\nthen gonna get a selector window for\n\n399\n00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:53.870\nthe collections and we choose which\ncollection we wanna deploy that too.\n\n400\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.000\nSo I'm gonna show that to you right now.\n\n401\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.250\nWe also, by the way, have the ability\n\n402\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.330\nto be able to do that from right up there\nat the top, as well, in the ribbon.\n\n403\n00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.030\nSo you could see in either place,\nright, it's basically the same thing.\n\n404\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.739\nSo remember, there's always three ways-\n>> Always.\n\n405\n00:19:06.739 --> 00:19:07.620\n>> To do everything.\n\n406\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.759\nNow the real bonus will be,\nhow do you do that through PowerShell?\n\n407\n00:19:09.759 --> 00:19:12.551\n>> [LAUGH] Right [LAUGH].\n\n408\n00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:14.603\n>> Yeah, I don't like you that much so\nthat's not happening, but\n\n409\n00:19:14.603 --> 00:19:16.010\nI just thought I'd tell\nyou that you could.\n\n410\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.691\nAll right-\n>> We give you\n\n411\n00:19:16.691 --> 00:19:18.841\nlinks to several websites and I'm sure-\n>> We did.\n\n412\n00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:19.466\n>> We give you the information on it.\n\n413\n00:19:19.466 --> 00:19:22.840\n>> And there are 470 PowerShell commandlet\noptions and I promise you that at least 2\n\n414\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.467\nof them will be very valuable for\nyou in that particular context.\n\n415\n00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:28.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so you can see here that\n\n416\n00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.094\nwhen I go in and we get our selector for\nthe collections, you'll see we have our\n\n417\n00:19:32.094 --> 00:19:36.700\ndevice collections, and obviously I've\nonly got the default built-in ones here.\n\n418\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.990\nBut we would have multiple\ncollections most likely.\n\n419\n00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.890\nWe would choose the collection\nthat we wanna deploy\n\n420\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.710\nthis group of customized settings to.\n\n421\n00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:46.718\nAnd that would then get deployed out\nto all the systems in that collection.\n\n422\n00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:49.125\n>> Wow.\n>> Modifying the default client settings\n\n423\n00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:51.967\nand overriding them with\nthe custom ones we've created.\n\n424\n00:19:51.967 --> 00:19:52.467\n>> Very nice.\n\n425\n00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:55.101\n>> So I just wanted to make sure\nyou guys got a chance to see that,\n\n426\n00:19:55.101 --> 00:19:57.410\ncuz I didn't actually demo that piece for\nyou.\n\n427\n00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.850\nBut I did want to make sure\nyou understood how to do it,\n\n428\n00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.050\nin case you actually\nwere interested in it.\n\n429\n00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.745\nSince a few of you had expressed in the\nchat window that that was something that\n\n430\n00:20:05.745 --> 00:20:08.220\nactually was very valuable and\nyou hadn't realized you could do that.\n\n431\n00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.150\nI wanted to make sure you had\nthe opportunity to at least see\n\n432\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:10.910\nhow that works.\n\n433\n00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.370\n>> Very good.\n>> All right, so having said that,\n\n434\n00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.150\nwe did say that we would quickly take\na look at the distribution point\n\n435\n00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.370\nbefore we actually go in and\nstart configuring software.\n\n436\n00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.380\nSo we're going to start with that here.\n\n437\n00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:27.301\nWe've got our, in the Administration\nworkspace, our site and server, or system.\n\n438\n00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:29.756\nServers and\nSite Systems Roles is what I meant to say,\n\n439\n00:20:29.756 --> 00:20:31.590\nyou'll see that selected on the left.\n\n440\n00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.980\nWe have our site server\nselected up top there.\n\n441\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.390\nYou'll notice down below\nwe have our site roles and\n\n442\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.200\nthe distribution point is item number two.\n\n443\n00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.468\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna highlight that.\n\n444\n00:20:40.468 --> 00:20:44.158\nAnd when we do that we're\ngonna right-click, go in and\n\n445\n00:20:44.158 --> 00:20:48.910\ngrab properties off that, and\nopen up the Properties window.\n\n446\n00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.340\nThere we go.\n\n447\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.690\nAnd as soon as we do that and\nour Property window comes up, and\n\n448\n00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:58.176\nit's loading right now, we will be able\nto, as you can see, if you look across,\n\n449\n00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:04.520\nThe top here, I mentioned all the things\non that list that will get configured.\n\n450\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.670\nWe have General tab,\nPXE, Multicast, Content,\n\n451\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.260\nContent Validation, Boundary Groups.\n\n452\n00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.660\nEvery one of those tabs are the tabs\nthat we would actually configure\n\n453\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.420\nin the wizard as we set this up.\n\n454\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.590\nSo this is where you would go\nto see all this after the fact.\n\n455\n00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.750\nAnd if you do it during the actual wizard\nwhen you configure the role you get\n\n456\n00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.180\na chance to do all this.\n\n457\n00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:29.100\nSo the PXE tab is going\nto allow us to specify,\n\n458\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.290\nand we'll do this in a future episode\nwhere we enable PXE support for clients.\n\n459\n00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.450\nThat way we will be able to use WDS and\n\n460\n00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.980\nbe able to do operating system\ndeployments, obviously.\n\n461\n00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.120\nComing up in that discussion,\nin those episodes where we get to that,\n\n462\n00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.920\nwe'll be taking a look at this and\nsetting up those things.\n\n463\n00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.260\nSo we may need a password and username.\n\n464\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.450\nSo we'll be setting up the password there.\n\n465\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.110\nKind of things that we may\nwant to be able to do, so\n\n466\n00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.030\nwe will be taking a look at all that.\n\n467\n00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:03.950\nIn the Multicast area, I enable\nmulticasting, again, for the imaging.\n\n468\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.040\nFor multiple clients to be able\nto be sent images simultaneously.\n\n469\n00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.925\nOne of the tricks in the specifications\naround using imaging platforms,\n\n470\n00:22:11.925 --> 00:22:15.820\nis we need multicasting capabilities\nto image multiple systems at once.\n\n471\n00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.200\nOtherwise it's a very laborious,\nvery tedious process to do imaging.\n\n472\n00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.680\nSo we're gonna be using that and so we'll\npotentially be taking a look at that and\n\n473\n00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.230\nmaking sure we understand that.\n\n474\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:29.470\nWe have, on the Group Relations area,\nthe ability, we'll just zoom in so\n\n475\n00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.990\nyou can see this,\nspecify the distribution point groups.\n\n476\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.740\nThis is where the distribution\npoint groups,\n\n477\n00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.630\nif we choose to create one,\nwould be found.\n\n478\n00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.990\nIn other words, we would already\nhave them created somewhere else and\n\n479\n00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.310\njust listed here.\n\n480\n00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.320\nWe'll take a look at how\nto actually create one.\n\n481\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.810\nBut once we do that and we associate\nthis distribution point with the group,\n\n482\n00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.750\nit just shows up here as\nbeing a member of that group.\n\n483\n00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.680\nThat's all this is, is just a reference\nto groups we may already be a member of.\n\n484\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.970\nWe could add in the groups here,\nif we have one created.\n\n485\n00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:58.175\nUnder Content,\nwhat packages are actually deployed or\n\n486\n00:22:58.175 --> 00:23:01.134\nassigned to this distribution point.\n\n487\n00:23:01.134 --> 00:23:05.259\nRight now the only one that is there is\nthe Configuration Manager Client Package.\n\n488\n00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:09.204\nWhich is what's used for\npush installations to push to software out\n\n489\n00:23:09.204 --> 00:23:12.676\nthrough the console to put\nan agent on one or more machines.\n\n490\n00:23:12.676 --> 00:23:18.390\nSo we have that there, notice it's\nabout 175 megs in size approximately.\n\n491\n00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:23.690\nAnd, like all unique objects, it has its\nown unique ID, in the case, Package ID.\n\n492\n00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:25.382\nIt has the site code as\npart of the package,\n\n493\n00:23:25.382 --> 00:23:26.843\nthe first three letters or numbers.\n\n494\n00:23:26.843 --> 00:23:31.671\nPLB is the site code and\nthen it iterates from 0001, 0000,\n\n495\n00:23:31.671 --> 00:23:33.967\nfour 0s, and then the number.\n\n496\n00:23:33.967 --> 00:23:37.731\nAnd so we potentially have a total\nof five items there, right,\n\n497\n00:23:37.731 --> 00:23:41.010\nwhich will give us up to\n99,999 unique entries.\n\n498\n00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.634\nSo go ahead and try to figure out how\nto deploy that much software, right?\n\n499\n00:23:43.634 --> 00:23:46.849\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's quite a bit, but we have\n\n500\n00:23:46.849 --> 00:23:53.379\nthe unique opportunity to iterate through\n99,999 individual packages if we need to.\n\n501\n00:23:53.379 --> 00:23:55.424\nAnd then Content Validation, and\n\n502\n00:23:55.424 --> 00:24:00.291\neven with the aggressive patch management\ncycle that Microsoft has for updates,\n\n503\n00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:02.879\nI think we still should be okay-\n>> Right [LAUGH].\n\n504\n00:24:02.879 --> 00:24:05.809\n>> For that unless we have a really,\nreally big patch Tuesday,\n\n505\n00:24:05.809 --> 00:24:07.712\nin which case then, maybe not so much.\n\n506\n00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:11.083\nAlso content validation,\nthis allows us to be able to,\n\n507\n00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:15.850\nas you see here, verify integrity of\npackages on the distribution point.\n\n508\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.720\nWe do that again, our magic number,\nonce a week, every seven days.\n\n509\n00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.680\nNow content validation and integrity\nis all about making sure that packages\n\n510\n00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.500\nthemselves have not been\nmodified without our knowledge.\n\n511\n00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.450\nWe are digitally signing those packages,\nhashing them so we understand that they\n\n512\n00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:33.220\nare effectively in the state they\nwere in when they were deployed.\n\n513\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.150\nWe are comparing that and checking that.\n\n514\n00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.570\nIf that has changed in any way, then\nwe may have to take remediative action.\n\n515\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:42.240\nSo we check that once a week to ensure\nthe integrity of those packages.\n\n516\n00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.390\nVery important.\n\n517\n00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:47.130\nAnd then boundary groups, we've\ntalked about boundary groups already.\n\n518\n00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.600\nYou'll see our lab boundary group there\nthat we've been using and demoing with.\n\n519\n00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.500\nRemember the boundary group is\nsimply the administrative container,\n\n520\n00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.800\nlike a distribution point group\nwould be for distribution points.\n\n521\n00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.340\nIt's the administrative container for\nthe boundaries we create.\n\n522\n00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.730\nIf you remember, we create boundaries\nby using either IP V4 addresses,\n\n523\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:10.010\nIP V4 subnets, IP V6 prefixes,\nand or at the directory sites.\n\n524\n00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.700\nWe can use any or\nall of those things to create boundaries.\n\n525\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.322\nAnd those boundaries are then going\nto associate systems with a site.\n\n526\n00:25:16.322 --> 00:25:19.614\nAnd the site is going to have those\nboundaries as part of its definition.\n\n527\n00:25:19.614 --> 00:25:22.800\nAnd then the systems within those\nboundaries are going to be able to use\n\n528\n00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.418\nthis particular distribution point, or\nthis group, if we have more than one,\n\n529\n00:25:26.418 --> 00:25:30.040\nassuming we have multiple distribution\npoints in a distribution point group.\n\n530\n00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.930\nSo I just want to make sure\nwe're aware of all that.\n\n531\n00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.650\nSo that is how the distribution point\nis set up and configured for us.\n\n532\n00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.070\nAnd now that we've seen that,\n\n533\n00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:43.010\nwhat we're going to do is shift over\nto the Software Library workspace.\n\n534\n00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.540\nSo we're going to open that up.\n\n535\n00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:49.340\nBefore I go in, I'm just going to\nquickly zoom in so you can see this,\n\n536\n00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.580\nthat when we go into the Software library\nworkspace, you see we have three folders.\n\n537\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.130\nNow over the next several episodes,\n\n538\n00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.010\nwe're going to be dealing with\nevery one of these in-depth.\n\n539\n00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.540\nWe're going to be taking on\nthe Application Management area now.\n\n540\n00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.450\nWe're going to open that up.\n\n541\n00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.433\nThat's where our packages,\nour applications and\n\n542\n00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:06.820\nall the stuff we're going to\ntalk about are going to be.\n\n543\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.300\nSo we're going to nail that one and\ngo through that in great detail now.\n\n544\n00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.580\nWe'll be coming back,\nyou'll be joining us for\n\n545\n00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.730\nfuture episodes to do the Software Updates\nwhich will be the WSUS,\n\n546\n00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.740\npatch management functionality,\nand the operating systems area,\n\n547\n00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.780\nwhich is the OSD, or\noperating system deployment functionality.\n\n548\n00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.070\nSo we will be visiting those again and\n\n549\n00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.580\ntaking a look at those in more\ndepth in future episodes.\n\n550\n00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.464\nBut I'll just give you a sense\nof what's in there for now.\n\n551\n00:26:28.464 --> 00:26:29.900\nBut we're gonna only open up and\n\n552\n00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.920\nreally spend our time in the application\nmanagement area for the time being.\n\n553\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.000\nOkay, so just so\nyou know what's going on there.\n\n554\n00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.989\nSo we're gonna open that up.\n\n555\n00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.480\nLet me do that, and\nthen just zoom back in so\n\n556\n00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.120\nyou can see what's there real quick,\nas we begin our discussions.\n\n557\n00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.300\nSo you will see that we have\nour application work space.\n\n558\n00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.800\nWe'll be going in the and starting to set\nthings up by creating an application.\n\n559\n00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.130\nWe have our package work space.\n\n560\n00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.240\nWe'll be going in there.\n\n561\n00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.180\nWe have our conditions,\nour approval requests.\n\n562\n00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.980\nWe have have App-V, virtual environment.\n\n563\n00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.080\nWe do app virtualization,\nwe'll have a few things to say about that.\n\n564\n00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.990\nWe have some side loading keys, so\nwe're going to create our own apps and\n\n565\n00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.880\nput them into the Windows Store and\nload them into clients.\n\n566\n00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.590\nWe'll have a couple of things to say\nabout that at the very end just to wrap\n\n567\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.360\nup as well.\n\n568\n00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.777\nWe're not going to actually demo\nthose particular things, but\n\n569\n00:27:12.777 --> 00:27:15.114\nwe'll talk about them just so\neverybody knows what they are.\n\n570\n00:27:15.114 --> 00:27:19.409\nBut we'll take a look at that, because you\nmay or may not actually be side loading\n\n571\n00:27:19.409 --> 00:27:23.644\nyour own applications, taking other\napps and effectively loading them into,\n\n572\n00:27:23.644 --> 00:27:28.383\nlet's say, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 or\nWindows 10 through the Windows Store and\n\n573\n00:27:28.383 --> 00:27:32.656\nor on being able to load non-Windows\napplications using side loading as well.\n\n574\n00:27:32.656 --> 00:27:36.133\nThat may not be your thing, but\nit's important no you could do it and\n\n575\n00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:39.671\nobviously in a large enterprise you\nmay set up your own app store, and\n\n576\n00:27:39.671 --> 00:27:41.900\nbusiness have the ability to do that.\n\n577\n00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.400\nAnd if they choose to do that,\n\n578\n00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.230\nthen they have to load those\napplications through the store.\n\n579\n00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.050\nAnd so it's important just to at least\nbe aware of the fact that we know that\n\n580\n00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:49.710\nthat exist.\n\n581\n00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.596\nBut we're going to focus really at\nthe top layer there with applications and\n\n582\n00:27:53.596 --> 00:27:54.390\npackages.\n\n583\n00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.380\nThis is the bread and\nbutter of what we do for\n\n584\n00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.320\napplication or\nsoftware deployment within SCCM.\n\n585\n00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.720\nNow, when we start out and\nwe zoom in on the application work space,\n\n586\n00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.560\nyou'll see that we have no\napplications in there by default.\n\n587\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.910\nBy default.\n\n588\n00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:11.850\nBy default.\n\n589\n00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.730\nRight?\nWe have no applications in there\n\n590\n00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:14.710\nby default.\n\n591\n00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.090\nWhat we have to do is start building them.\n\n592\n00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.825\nUnlike in the package area, and we'll zoom\nin just you could see packages briefly for\n\n593\n00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:25.966\na second, where we actually do have two\npackages that exist out of the box,\n\n594\n00:28:25.966 --> 00:28:29.257\nthe Configuration Manager Client Package\nwhich is again,\n\n595\n00:28:29.257 --> 00:28:33.992\nhow would you push installs, and the User\nState Migration Tool, it's called USMT,\n\n596\n00:28:33.992 --> 00:28:38.333\nwhich we actually installed as we did\nthe configuration build out in our very,\n\n597\n00:28:38.333 --> 00:28:42.938\nvery first hands-on lab environment demo\nwhere we went in and we installed the side\n\n598\n00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:47.115\nserver and we installed the ADK,\nthe Windows Automated Deployment Kit.\n\n599\n00:28:47.115 --> 00:28:52.176\nAnd we actually chose USMT as part of that\ndeployment, and as a result of that we\n\n600\n00:28:52.176 --> 00:28:57.680\nwere able to actually go in and say hey,\nby the way, we'd like to have this tool.\n\n601\n00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.810\nNow, it's interesting because\na lot of people don't use USMT.\n\n602\n00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.500\nThe User State Migration Tool is really\nused in a very narrowly defined set of\n\n603\n00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.620\ncircumstances.\n\n604\n00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:10.320\nIt is used when you want to migrate your\nuser profile from one machine to another\n\n605\n00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.650\nand you're not centrally storing\nthings like, files, and pictures, and\n\n606\n00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.080\nstuff like that.\n\n607\n00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.360\nSo we are, if we're going to image\na machine, do an update to it, you take\n\n608\n00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.540\nit from seven to eight, 8.1, something\nlike that, we could use that tool.\n\n609\n00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.440\nIt winds up being very valuable in a very,\nvery narrowly defined business case.\n\n610\n00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.980\nIt's a lot of work to be\nable to move the profile.\n\n611\n00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.650\nIt's usually not worth the effort if you\nhave lots and lots and lots of users.\n\n612\n00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:38.410\nBecause what typically is done is we\nuse folder redirects and group policy\n\n613\n00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.310\nto manage all that information up to\ncentral stores in the network somewhere\n\n614\n00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.310\non a storage area network or out on\na file share or whatever that may be.\n\n615\n00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.580\nAs a result of that users\nreconnect to their data and\n\n616\n00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.890\npull it back down when we\ngive them a new desktop.\n\n617\n00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.860\nAnd if we're doing VDI,\nwe don't need that because with VDI\n\n618\n00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.830\nour desktop is effectively\nfollowing us wherever we go.\n\n619\n00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.590\nSo the reality is, this really is probably\nnot technology you're going to spend a lot\n\n620\n00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.630\nof time with, but\nit's there as a package, because\n\n621\n00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.580\nyou may actually have a need to be able to\ndo that or need to be able to use that.\n\n622\n00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.850\nAnd so we just want to make sure we at\nleast know about the fact that it's there,\n\n623\n00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.790\nand are aware of the fact that\nthat is something that we\n\n624\n00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.895\nmay just have to take a look\nat from time to time.\n\n625\n00:30:17.895 --> 00:30:20.728\nSo now that we've at least got\na sense of what's going on in there,\n\n626\n00:30:20.728 --> 00:30:22.156\nlet's go back to Applications.\n\n627\n00:30:22.156 --> 00:30:24.747\nAnd now that we know we have nothing\nthere, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n628\n00:30:24.747 --> 00:30:27.725\nactually start by creating our walk\nthrough steps to create an application.\n\n629\n00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:31.278\nSo we're going to right\nclick on Applications, and\n\n630\n00:30:31.278 --> 00:30:34.203\nchoose Create Application from our menu.\n\n631\n00:30:34.203 --> 00:30:36.045\nWe're going to give that\na second to come up.\n\n632\n00:30:36.045 --> 00:30:38.440\nWe have a little wizard,\na window that will open up there, and\n\n633\n00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.739\nwalk us through our deployment.\n\n634\n00:30:41.822 --> 00:30:44.637\nAnd so, what we're going to see\nas soon as that comes up and\n\n635\n00:30:44.637 --> 00:30:48.520\njust while we're waiting for it,\nI'll just zoom in for half a second here.\n\n636\n00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.920\nSo you'll see that's thinking.\n\n637\n00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.915\nBut you'll notice up top that we have\nthe ability to do that as well but\n\n638\n00:30:53.915 --> 00:30:55.585\nalso import applications.\n\n639\n00:30:55.585 --> 00:30:59.295\nWe can actually, just like we did with\nqueries for instance, export import.\n\n640\n00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:03.155\nWe can actually import application\ndefinitions and actually bring them in if\n\n641\n00:31:03.155 --> 00:31:05.605\nsomebody has them packaged up\nfrom somewhere else as well.\n\n642\n00:31:05.605 --> 00:31:09.245\nSo we have our create application\nwizard going on there.\n\n643\n00:31:09.245 --> 00:31:12.590\nLet's just zoom in so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n644\n00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.310\nWe have our general window.\n\n645\n00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.650\nAnd I normally say hey,\ngeneral window introduction,\n\n646\n00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.890\ndon't even pay attention,\nnot worth our time and effort.\n\n647\n00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.240\nNot the case on this one.\n\n648\n00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.810\nWe have to specify settings for\nthe application here.\n\n649\n00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.160\nAnd so\nwhat we're going to have to do here is,\n\n650\n00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.420\nwe have to take a look at he fact\nthat automatically detect information\n\n651\n00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.460\nabout this app from the install file\nis the default choice that is selected.\n\n652\n00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.472\nWe can see that there.\n\n653\n00:31:33.472 --> 00:31:40.680\nType is .msi, Windows installer,\nthe .msi file type.\n\n654\n00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.100\nWe also have to provide a location for\nthat, as you can see, or\n\n655\n00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.020\nwe can manually specify\nthe application information.\n\n656\n00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.830\nWhenever I see the word manually specify\n\n657\n00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.660\nanything,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n658\n00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.205\n>> I'm immediately going the opposite\n\n659\n00:31:51.205 --> 00:31:53.504\ndirection, regardless of\nwhatever that may entail.\n\n660\n00:31:53.504 --> 00:31:56.712\nSo for me, I'm usually going\nto be doing the automated one.\n\n661\n00:31:56.712 --> 00:31:58.671\nBut all kidding aside, here's why.\n\n662\n00:31:58.671 --> 00:32:01.231\nBecause as I mentioned\nin our opening remarks,\n\n663\n00:32:01.231 --> 00:32:05.263\nA lot of the times the manufacturer of\nthe software that we are going to try to\n\n664\n00:32:05.263 --> 00:32:08.040\nultimately deploy is gonna provide an MSI.\n\n665\n00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.060\nAnd if they have done that and we go out\nand get that MSI file it will populate\n\n666\n00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.680\nall those fields for us so we don't\nhave to worry about putting all that in.\n\n667\n00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.390\nNow I talk to customers\nabout this all the time.\n\n668\n00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.000\nAnd I tell them hey you know you can\ndo that, and they're like wow that's so\n\n669\n00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.500\ncool, but where do we get the MSI's from?\n\n670\n00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.240\nWell, you obviously have\nto work with the vendor,\n\n671\n00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.510\nso hypothetically let's just say Adobe,\nright?\n\n672\n00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.790\nSo Adobe Acrobat is what you're deploying,\n\n673\n00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.770\nAdobe might give you that capability\nto download that in several forms.\n\n674\n00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.760\nIt may be an EXC, it maybe an NSI file\nthat's already packaged up along with\n\n675\n00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.900\nAn installer or\nrather the installer may call the exe.\n\n676\n00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.680\nIt just depends on the vendor.\n\n677\n00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.384\nIf you don't have MSIs from the vendor,\nyou have to go back and\n\n678\n00:32:44.384 --> 00:32:46.059\nask them whether they are available.\n\n679\n00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:50.473\nNow there's also the opportunity for you\nto be able to go on and create your own.\n\n680\n00:32:50.473 --> 00:32:53.615\nA lot of people will write their own\napplications, or a lot of companies do\n\n681\n00:32:53.615 --> 00:32:57.095\ntheir own internal app deaf, and\nthey will create their own applications.\n\n682\n00:32:57.095 --> 00:33:01.175\nAnd they do their own cycle and\nmaintenance work on those applications.\n\n683\n00:33:01.175 --> 00:33:03.752\nSo, they may actually\nthe developers internally\n\n684\n00:33:03.752 --> 00:33:06.221\nmade to simply put out an exe and\nnot give you an MSI.\n\n685\n00:33:06.221 --> 00:33:10.402\nYou can actually create your own\nMSIs using repackaging software so\n\n686\n00:33:10.402 --> 00:33:14.152\nWyse, W-Y-S-E,\nis one of the companies that does this and\n\n687\n00:33:14.152 --> 00:33:15.742\nthere is part of this fairly well known.\n\n688\n00:33:15.742 --> 00:33:19.662\nUp at there there are many, many companies\nout there that provide re packagers, and\n\n689\n00:33:19.662 --> 00:33:24.172\nso you may go out and actually create your\nown packaged up software with MSIs and\n\n690\n00:33:24.172 --> 00:33:26.450\nEXEs and be able to deploy that way.\n\n691\n00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.850\nSo it really just depends on what\nyou're doing and how you're doing it,\n\n692\n00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:34.120\nbut here we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna search, or rather not search but\n\n693\n00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:40.420\nselect what we can see, and I'll just show\nyou here quickly, is that we have a huge,\n\n694\n00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.300\nhuge, well, list here of the potential\ndifferent types of installers.\n\n695\n00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:50.640\nYou'll see we have the Windows app\npackage, both in the old and new formats,\n\n696\n00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:56.739\napx, apx or appx for app package, app, let\nme slow down, app package bundle, right?\n\n697\n00:33:56.739 --> 00:33:58.600\n>> O and addition, did I just do that?\n\n698\n00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.810\nI think I did.\n\n699\n00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:00.440\n>> Yes, we did.\n\n700\n00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:00.940\n>> I did.\n\n701\n00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.930\n>> Amazing.\n\n702\n00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:05.135\n>> All I did was get\nclose to the touch pad.\n\n703\n00:34:05.135 --> 00:34:07.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it sensed my indication that I\n\n704\n00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.120\nwanted to not zoom out, and\nit did the exact opposite.\n\n705\n00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.100\nBad touchpad.\n\n706\n00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.115\nI'm gonna stay on this side\nof the machine for a minute.\n\n707\n00:34:15.115 --> 00:34:18.195\nSo, you can see we also have\napp virtualization of app v\n\n708\n00:34:18.195 --> 00:34:19.035\ncapabilities there.\n\n709\n00:34:19.035 --> 00:34:20.515\nVersion four, version five.\n\n710\n00:34:20.515 --> 00:34:22.515\nSo, we can do app v packages.\n\n711\n00:34:22.515 --> 00:34:26.065\nWe have Windows phone app packages for\nthe mobile platform.\n\n712\n00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:31.254\nWe have Windows mobile cabinet for\nnon Windows on phones, but mobile devices.\n\n713\n00:34:31.254 --> 00:34:34.325\nSo, like, the Nokia device,\nthe Microsoft download can be done there.\n\n714\n00:34:34.325 --> 00:34:38.650\nThe app package for iOS, you can\nsee we port the deployment for IOS.\n\n715\n00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:43.268\nApp packages for Androids, we talked about\nthat, and we see that there as well.\n\n716\n00:34:43.268 --> 00:34:47.922\nMac OS X is down there as well for\nthe OS on the desktop laptop etc, so\n\n717\n00:34:47.922 --> 00:34:49.820\nwe could do all of that.\n\n718\n00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.380\nSo you'll see that we have lots and\nlots and lots of options there.\n\n719\n00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.030\nBut we're gonna stick with Windows MSI,\n\n720\n00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:57.310\nbecause that's what we're gonna\nbe deploying right now and\n\n721\n00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.660\nobviously what we're gonna wanna make\nsure that we are going to be focusing on.\n\n722\n00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.270\nAnd we're gonna type in in Location here,\nwhere we wanna go and\n\n723\n00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.290\nactually get that MSI file from.\n\n724\n00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:07.180\nSo we're gonna type that in.\n\n725\n00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.190\nNow in your world,\n\n726\n00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:12.280\nthis would be where ever you have set up\nthe share, where you have this software.\n\n727\n00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.900\nBest practice recommendation is that\nyou typically create a central store or\n\n728\n00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.520\nrepository somewhere, a file share of some\nkind, and you put it on a machine and\n\n729\n00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.810\nyou make it available.\n\n730\n00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.636\nWe've done that, and we have that here.\n\n731\n00:35:24.636 --> 00:35:27.560\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ntype in the path to get to it.\n\n732\n00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.950\nBut you can set that up and\ndo anything you would like.\n\n733\n00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.290\nIt's really up to you.\n\n734\n00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.930\nWhat we're doing here, and\n\n735\n00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:39.050\nI'm just gonna highlight this before I\nmake this selection so you can see it, is\n\n736\n00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:44.540\nwe are using a share we've created out on\nour domain controller In this environment.\n\n737\n00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.070\nWe've created a folder called SW for\nsoftware.\n\n738\n00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.030\nWe got Winzip 10 there,\n\n739\n00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.420\nand you'll see I'm selecting from\nthe share the install.msi file.\n\n740\n00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.450\nAll the other files that are necessary\nto support the install are there.\n\n741\n00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:57.800\nThe reg file, right,\nthe program files, etc.\n\n742\n00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.030\nThey'll all be called by\nthe MSI if necessary.\n\n743\n00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.050\nBut we can get to that.\n\n744\n00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.850\nAll that is is just a domain controller's\ngot a share on it that we published out\n\n745\n00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:08.180\nand made available with permissions to\nallow us to go in and grab software.\n\n746\n00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:12.460\nNothing special, no fancy,\ncrazy stuff going on,\n\n747\n00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.840\njust real basic Networking 101,\nset up a share, sign permissions to it,\n\n748\n00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.280\nput a bunch of stuff in there and\nthen go and connect to it.\n\n749\n00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.430\nSo, how do you know that?\n\n750\n00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.200\nYou read up on the guidance and\ndocumentation that we provided to you.\n\n751\n00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.290\nAnd you go out and make sure that you\nunderstand where that share needs to be\n\n752\n00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:29.140\ncreated relevant as long\nas you can get to it,\n\n753\n00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.770\nby making sure you create it\nthe right way, and just set it up so\n\n754\n00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.610\nwe can get to it with the proper\npermissions is what is important.\n\n755\n00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.590\nSo we got that out there,\nwe're going to go ahead and select that.\n\n756\n00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.330\nWe're just gonna choose install.msi so\nwe have that.\n\n757\n00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.460\nWe're gonna click Next,\ngive that a second.\n\n758\n00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.890\nIt then goes ahead, and I'll just show\nyou what this is so you can see it.\n\n759\n00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:48.870\nGives us a little pop up window there,\n\n760\n00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:52.270\nit says publisher of install.msi\nfile could not be verified.\n\n761\n00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:55.800\nAre you sure that you wanna publish,\nor rather excuse me, import this file?\n\n762\n00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.980\nSo this is actually a good prompt.\n\n763\n00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.000\nYou know I often rant and\n\n764\n00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.090\nrage about a lot of these stupid\nprompts that show up, right?\n\n765\n00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.970\nBecause I don't think that\nthey're all that important.\n\n766\n00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:09.540\nAnd I don't really think, honestly, that\nit's worth our time to be prompted to do\n\n767\n00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.740\nsomething we've already\ncommitted to doing.\n\n768\n00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.000\nBut in this particular case, I'm gonna\ntake the opposite view and tell you that\n\n769\n00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.980\nI think it is really important that\nMicrosoft does this, and here's why.\n\n770\n00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.270\nBecause since the publisher cannot be\nverified, what they're effectively saying\n\n771\n00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.090\nto us is, from a security standpoint is,\nhey guess what?\n\n772\n00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.400\nWe can't tell you whether\nthis is valid content.\n\n773\n00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.710\nWe don't know and\nwe can't prove beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n774\n00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.900\nthat what you're about to do may\nnot negatively impact your system.\n\n775\n00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.470\nAnd it's good for them to stop us and tell\nus that, to give us pause and say hey,\n\n776\n00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.960\nare we sure we really wanna install and\n\n777\n00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.550\npotentially use software\nthat cannot be verified.\n\n778\n00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:47.309\nNow this is not to say that\nthe software is necessarily bad.\n\n779\n00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:51.404\nThis is just simply saying we don't have\na certificate that validates the publisher\n\n780\n00:37:51.404 --> 00:37:55.390\nthat lets us know beyond any reasonable\ndoubt that they are trustworthy.\n\n781\n00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.440\nWe're doing WinZip.\n\n782\n00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.250\nWinZip is not a Microsoft product.\n\n783\n00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:02.755\nAnd so as a result of that, there's no\ncertificate associated with this MSI and\n\n784\n00:38:02.755 --> 00:38:05.790\nthis installer package\nthat we can validate.\n\n785\n00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:10.440\nThat's not a bad thing, it's just a thing,\nand we have to pause and understand that.\n\n786\n00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.238\nIf you trust the source where you\ndownloaded the software from,\n\n787\n00:38:14.238 --> 00:38:16.428\nthen it's okay, you'd click Yes.\n\n788\n00:38:16.428 --> 00:38:18.868\nIf you don't, and\nyou have no idea where it came from,\n\n789\n00:38:18.868 --> 00:38:20.619\nthis is your opt out option right here,\n\n790\n00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:23.745\nto make sure you don't do something\nthat may come back and haunt you.\n\n791\n00:38:23.745 --> 00:38:25.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, this particular pop-up\n\n792\n00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.650\nis actually good one.\n\n793\n00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:30.200\nThis is one of the few that I\napproved up and then, I can say.\n\n794\n00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:30.760\n>> Right.\n\n795\n00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.930\n>> Adam sealed approval on that one,\nright.\n\n796\n00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.208\n>> All right, so we're gonna click the yes\nthere so, you're gonna see that by\n\n797\n00:38:36.208 --> 00:38:39.644\nthe way, when you have seen a production,\nunless you have the certificates for\n\n798\n00:38:39.644 --> 00:38:43.080\nthat software installed and trusted in\nyour certificate store on the machine,\n\n799\n00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.420\nyou're gonna always get that pop up and\nthat is fine.\n\n800\n00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.320\nJust make sure you understand\nthe implications of saying yes and\n\n801\n00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.098\nthen click yes and go on about your way.\n\n802\n00:38:50.098 --> 00:38:53.766\nAnd remember my adage and my guidance\nhere, when in doubt, test early and\n\n803\n00:38:53.766 --> 00:38:56.169\ntest often on someone else's system,\nright?\n\n804\n00:38:56.169 --> 00:38:57.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just be aware of that.\n\n805\n00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.380\nAll right, so we're to click next,\nwe're gonna get to general information\n\n806\n00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.880\nscroll down, we can take a look at this\nreal quick, let's just zoom in here.\n\n807\n00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.460\nWe've got some interesting stuff going on.\n\n808\n00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.628\nSo we've got Winzip 10.\n\n809\n00:39:08.628 --> 00:39:10.350\nHow do we know that?\n\n810\n00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:14.198\nWell that's because the msi file tells\nus what the name of the software is.\n\n811\n00:39:14.198 --> 00:39:17.780\nNow we were hoping potentially that it\nmay have provided some additional stuff.\n\n812\n00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.759\nLike publisher software version etc.\n\n813\n00:39:19.759 --> 00:39:22.350\nYou know the vendor chose not to do that,\nthat's fine.\n\n814\n00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:23.143\nBut they have, and\n\n815\n00:39:23.143 --> 00:39:26.128\nif they did that would have been in\nthe MSI file that we're bringing in.\n\n816\n00:39:26.128 --> 00:39:27.620\nSo that's what that would be.\n\n817\n00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:32.678\nWe also have there installation program,\nmsiexec/i for install.\n\n818\n00:39:32.678 --> 00:39:36.341\nIf you're not up to speed on your msiexec\nswitches, would be a good idea for\n\n819\n00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:38.350\nyou to go out and read up on those.\n\n820\n00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:42.780\nWe should, and hopefully you do know how\nto find help on something like that.\n\n821\n00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.840\nYou can obviously Google for it, and\nsee what are the acceptable switches for\n\n822\n00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.830\nmsiexec.\n\n823\n00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.586\nThere's i, there's q, there's l for list,\nthere's different things you can do.\n\n824\n00:39:51.586 --> 00:39:56.218\nWe then have a string, a literal string,\ninstall.msi, that's in quotes to\n\n825\n00:39:56.218 --> 00:40:00.796\nrepresent it and say hey, make sure you\ninstall this exact file called this.\n\n826\n00:40:00.796 --> 00:40:03.254\nWhich is why the codes are there so\nwe can see that.\n\n827\n00:40:03.254 --> 00:40:07.163\nAll right, so we have all that and\nthen we have the box to check off and\n\n828\n00:40:07.163 --> 00:40:12.034\nsay run install program as 32-bit process\non 64-bit clients if necessary, so\n\n829\n00:40:12.034 --> 00:40:13.267\nif we need to do that,\n\n830\n00:40:13.267 --> 00:40:18.296\nwe could do that if not natively we're\nrunning this on a 64-bit processor, right?\n\n831\n00:40:18.296 --> 00:40:21.130\nAnd Mike will show you when we get down\nwith this whole thing where to go out and\n\n832\n00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:24.750\nfind the MSI exec file, help if you need\nit, he's been kind enough to go out and\n\n833\n00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:25.530\npull that up.\n\n834\n00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.055\nAnd he'll just make sure you can see\nthat as a reference when we get done.\n\n835\n00:40:28.055 --> 00:40:31.630\nAlright so we're gonna go ahead, we're\ngonna click next here to go ahead and\n\n836\n00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.750\ncontinue.\n\n837\n00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.340\nSo let me just go ahead and do that.\n\n838\n00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.750\nWe have our general information page.\n\n839\n00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.340\nJust a summary, if you will,\nof what we have here.\n\n840\n00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.190\nAnd I'm making sure that we can see,\noh actually, you know what,\n\n841\n00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.160\nlet me go back one second,\nI forgot to do one quick thing.\n\n842\n00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.820\nI'm so busy explaining I forgot\nto talk about this one option.\n\n843\n00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.150\nAnd none of you out there said anything.\n\n844\n00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.980\nIt's ridiculous.\n\n845\n00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.310\nYou guys should be keeping\nme honest about this stuff.\n\n846\n00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.800\nWe didn't talk about install behavior.\n\n847\n00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.210\nLet me just show you this real quick and\ntalk about what's here.\n\n848\n00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:06.290\nSo we have install for user,\ninstall for system, and/or install for\n\n849\n00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:09.590\nsystem if resource is device\notherwise install for user.\n\n850\n00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:12.840\nSo effectively, hey,\nwhat's going to be the behavior here?\n\n851\n00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.930\nWho are we installing for?\n\n852\n00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.980\nWhat's our target audience, in effect?\n\n853\n00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:20.040\nSo if we do install for user, it installs\nfor any and all users on the device.\n\n854\n00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.400\nIf we do install for system,\nit installs on the system one time.\n\n855\n00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.640\nIf we do install for\nsystem if resource is device.\n\n856\n00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.130\nIf not, install for user.\n\n857\n00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.080\nIt toggles and figures out which is which.\n\n858\n00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.230\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose the bottom one so\n\n859\n00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:38.160\nthat it does that regardless so we'll just\nset that up just so you guys can see that.\n\n860\n00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.340\nWe'll then go ahead and click next on\nour summary page, nothing of interest on\n\n861\n00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.580\nthe summary page just telling us\nwhat we're already going to do.\n\n862\n00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.560\nWe've worked through that and\nnarrated through all that already.\n\n863\n00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.485\nSo we're just gonna let that work here.\n\n864\n00:41:47.485 --> 00:41:51.770\nIt's gonna cook for a couple of seconds\nand then as soon as that is going to be\n\n865\n00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:55.440\ndone we'll get a little completion screen\nand when we have our completion screen and\n\n866\n00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.940\nwhen we have our completion screen then\nwe'll be able to go ahead hit next,\n\n867\n00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.090\nyou're finished.\n\n868\n00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:02.685\nOnce we are done with that,\nwe actually hit close by the way, and\n\n869\n00:42:02.685 --> 00:42:05.630\nthen we will see our\napplication is actually set up.\n\n870\n00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.100\nWe will be able to take a look at it.\n\n871\n00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.440\nThen what we will do is take\na look at employment types and\n\n872\n00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.450\nso we will be able to go\nin take a look at that.\n\n873\n00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:12.850\nWhile we are waiting on this to finish,\n\n874\n00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.240\nwhy don't we quickly take a look at\nthe MSI exec help file you brought up or\n\n875\n00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.630\nthe information on the web I'll just give\nthis a second or two to finish cooking.\n\n876\n00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.530\nSo if we can go over to Mike's machine for\njust a minute, we can bring that up and\n\n877\n00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.850\nwhat Mike did is he just\nwent out to Google and\n\n878\n00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:29.130\nhe just quickly Googled I'm guessing\nmsiexec or msiexec command line options.\n\n879\n00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.530\nAnd when he did that, he brought that up,\nfirst link probably to Tech Net.\n\n880\n00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.090\nAnd we can see command\nline options right there.\n\n881\n00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.420\nAnd we can see that there is\na listing with all of them.\n\n882\n00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.740\nAnd you can have all of\nthe different switches.\n\n883\n00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.890\nLet me be clear on this, I would not\nsuggest you spend a huge amount of time\n\n884\n00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:47.410\npreparing for this particular piece of\nknowledge if you're taking the exam, but\n\n885\n00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:51.170\nI would suggest it's probably valuable for\nyou to be aware of the common ones\n\n886\n00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:56.020\nlike I for install, like Q for quiet just\nas a point of reference and then obviously\n\n887\n00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:59.430\nin the real world, as you do this you're\ngonna be automating and scripting then\n\n888\n00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:02.040\nyou're gonna have to really understand\nwhat's going on in there, all right?\n\n889\n00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.070\nSo let's go back to my machine.\n\n890\n00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.150\nWe are done, I just wanted to give it\na couple seconds to finish cooking.\n\n891\n00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.200\nSo you'll see here we have finished,\nthe completion screen is up there.\n\n892\n00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.700\nWe're gonna hit close and\nthen what we'll see, and I'll zoom in so\n\n893\n00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.510\nyou could see this, I'll just highlight\nit, but I'll zoom in so you can see it.\n\n894\n00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.641\nIs we now have an application\ncalled Winzip10 and\n\n895\n00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:26.677\nwe could see that it is set up and\nit is status active and\n\n896\n00:43:26.677 --> 00:43:32.099\nhas not been deployed yet, but\nit is sitting there and it is ready to go.\n\n897\n00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:34.873\n>> That really wasn't that\ncomplicated setting that up,\n\n898\n00:43:34.873 --> 00:43:38.010\nI guess the MSI gives us\na lot of the information.\n\n899\n00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:41.980\n>> It could, I mean it may not, again\nremember we may not have an MSI, we may,\n\n900\n00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.280\nit just depends.\n\n901\n00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.170\nSo if we don't have an MSI then we're\njust going to go ahead and do this from\n\n902\n00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:49.850\na different perspective, but either way,\nit certainly helps, let's put it that way.\n\n903\n00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:52.250\nIt doesn't hurt to have it,\ncuz it does kick us off and\n\n904\n00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:55.080\nkinda set up that install command line for\nus.\n\n905\n00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.620\nIf it's preloaded,\nit tells us who the vendor is, and\n\n906\n00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.770\nwhat the name of the, in this case,\nthe software or the application is.\n\n907\n00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.070\nSo it definitely adds value,\nthere's no doubt about it.\n\n908\n00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:09.480\nNow the other thing we could see down here\nand let me zoom in on the bottom of this.\n\n909\n00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.430\nSo just so\nyou can see where we are, right?\n\n910\n00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.750\nWe are looking at the app package, right?\n\n911\n00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.700\nJust gonna zoom out a little so\nyou can see that.\n\n912\n00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.960\nI'm coming down below to the bottom\nunder application status and\n\n913\n00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:24.950\nnotice that there are tabs there, summary,\ndeployment types and deployments.\n\n914\n00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:27.420\nWe're looking at\nApplication Status right now and\n\n915\n00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:31.480\nwe are looking at just the stuff that\ndeals with the application package and\n\n916\n00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.660\nnotice that there's nothing\ngoing on right now.\n\n917\n00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.570\nWe haven't done anything with it yet, but\n\n918\n00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:40.265\nwhen we do ultimately decide to\ndo a deployment we can then go in\n\n919\n00:44:42.265 --> 00:44:47.285\nand we can take a look at deployment\ntypes and we see that it is a .msi\n\n920\n00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:50.285\nfile that has been set up there for\nthe Windows Installer.\n\n921\n00:44:50.285 --> 00:44:53.225\nThere are no dependencies,\nit has not been superseded, and\n\n922\n00:44:53.225 --> 00:44:56.790\nit's using the Windows Installer\nto be able to do a deployment and\n\n923\n00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.550\nthen, we can also actually see if\nthere have been any deployments.\n\n924\n00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:03.210\nWhat they look like, right now there\nare none.There is nothing there, but\n\n925\n00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.230\nwe would see them.\n\n926\n00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.790\nSo we would be able to go in and\n\n927\n00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.000\nwe'd be able to tell a lot of\ninformation about the actual system.\n\n928\n00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.040\nFor instance, if you look at the headers\nin the area here on deployments.\n\n929\n00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.070\nYou'll see we have collection,\nwe have deployment start time,\n\n930\n00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:20.190\nwe have purpose,\nwe have compliance percentage action.\n\n931\n00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:22.440\nWe'll be able to tell\na lot about this package.\n\n932\n00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.120\nRather this application, excuse me.\n\n933\n00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.090\nAnd where it's been deployed and\nits history.\n\n934\n00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.660\nSimply by looking at this.\n\n935\n00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.380\nSo this is actually really nice and\nwe'll take advantage of that.\n\n936\n00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.130\nWe'll take a look at that\nonce we've done this.\n\n937\n00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:38.180\nI also will remind you that we can\ncustomize that view on the column headers.\n\n938\n00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.730\nYou see we only have five or six there.\n\n939\n00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:42.820\nLook at that whole list and\nthat's not even the whole list by the way.\n\n940\n00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.490\nLook at that whole list of all\nthe things we could put put in and\n\n941\n00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:46.660\nwe may wanna focus on.\n\n942\n00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.010\nThings like number and progress,\n\n943\n00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:51.980\nso how many deployments are in progress\nversus ones that have completed.\n\n944\n00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.970\nWe can take a look at date creation.\n\n945\n00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:57.370\nWe could look at assets that are targeted,\nso we could see how many are targeted,\n\n946\n00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:58.380\nhow many have completed.\n\n947\n00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.840\nWe have a lot of information available\nto us, just by right clicking, and\n\n948\n00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.060\nchoosing to customize that\nview if we choose to.\n\n949\n00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.090\nSo, want us to be aware of that and,\nyou know, maybe keep that in the back for\n\n950\n00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.790\nmine to take advantage of\nthat at some point as well.\n\n951\n00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.010\nAlright, so we have our application.\n\n952\n00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:15.760\nNow let's just take a look of\nthe properties of the application,\n\n953\n00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.000\nbefore we do anything else in here,\nso I'm going to right click.\n\n954\n00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.180\nI'm going to go to properties.\n\n955\n00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.730\nJust bring that up real quick,\nit'll take just a second for\n\n956\n00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:27.990\nthe properties to load before we create a\ndeployment type, and the properties sheet,\n\n957\n00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:32.490\nit's really just that, it's just\nthe property sheet for the application.\n\n958\n00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.340\nYou can see that we have a great\ndeal of information, and\n\n959\n00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.990\nall that general information that\nwe use when we set up is here.\n\n960\n00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:40.560\nSo who created it, when, what day, etc.\n\n961\n00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.060\nWe have our application catalog,\nreferences, distribution settings,\n\n962\n00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.630\ndeployment types, content locations,\nsupersedence and security tabs.\n\n963\n00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.200\n>> Nice.\n>> All of this information is now\n\n964\n00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.950\nassociated with this application.\n\n965\n00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.210\nSo we're gonna be able\nto interact with and\n\n966\n00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.060\npotentially deal with\nall those if we need to.\n\n967\n00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:57.750\nSo we have all that.\n\n968\n00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.740\nSo now what we're gonna do is go ahead and\ncreate a deployment type.\n\n969\n00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.860\nApplications can have\nmultiple deployment types.\n\n970\n00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.700\nDeployment type is effectively\ngonna be a criteria selection\n\n971\n00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:11.030\nthat's gonna effectively focus us in on\nthe criteria that must be available so\n\n972\n00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.780\nthat the application\nwill run against them.\n\n973\n00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.680\nSo in other words we may say,\nhey only deploy to this collection.\n\n974\n00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.370\nWell that's a application\ncriteria that we have to\n\n975\n00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:21.320\nmeet in order to run this application,\nwe are going to do a deployment type.\n\n976\n00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.410\nThat is what we are going to do next,\n\n977\n00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.320\nit's very important to be\nthinking about these things.\n\n978\n00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:29.330\nNow we can right click and do that and\nor as you see some highlighting right up\n\n979\n00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:33.040\nthere on the ribbon, we can simply go up\nand click on it right there, either way.\n\n980\n00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.340\nRight click, we have it in the right\nclick option on the application.\n\n981\n00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.780\nWe can do it right from there as well,\ncreate deployment type.\n\n982\n00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.265\nSo we're just gonna go ahead,\n\n983\n00:47:40.265 --> 00:47:44.320\nwe're gonna obviously make sure we have\nhighlighted our application so we're just\n\n984\n00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.630\ngonna click to make sure we have focus\nin the console cuz if we do that or\n\n985\n00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:51.254\nrather if we don't do that, we will not\nbe able to focus in on the right one.\n\n986\n00:47:51.254 --> 00:47:55.347\nThen we're gonna click create deployment\ntype, so we're gonna go do that and\n\n987\n00:47:55.347 --> 00:47:58.212\nwe're just gonna wait for\nthat wizard page to come up.\n\n988\n00:47:58.212 --> 00:48:01.046\nWhat we're then gonna do\nis Scroll down just so\n\n989\n00:48:01.046 --> 00:48:03.671\nwe can get that squared\nin the Window here.\n\n990\n00:48:03.671 --> 00:48:06.260\nSpecify settings for this deployment type.\n\n991\n00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:11.340\nWe will see that we have our type Windows\nInstaller MSI file already selected.\n\n992\n00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.890\nAutomatically identify information\nabout this deployment type from\n\n993\n00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:14.930\nthe install file.\n\n994\n00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:17.875\nSo we can go grab that,\nremember we already know where that is,\n\n995\n00:48:17.875 --> 00:48:21.830\naame path we just used the you know domain\ncontroller software share winzip 10.\n\n996\n00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.770\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nput that in.\n\n997\n00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.930\nSo that's the same screen basically we\njust saw to create the application right?\n\n998\n00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:28.180\n>> Right.\n>> Now had I been smart I would have\n\n999\n00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:29.221\ncopied that path and.\n\n1000\n00:48:29.221 --> 00:48:31.689\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not actually have to type it back in\n\n1001\n00:48:31.689 --> 00:48:35.940\nagain, but I did not do that, so\nwe're just gonna type that back in PLAB.\n\n1002\n00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.711\nThe DC's are a 1 and\nthen we're just gonna go down there and\n\n1003\n00:48:40.711 --> 00:48:45.198\nwe're gonna view that and\nwe're gonna do winzip10,\n\n1004\n00:48:45.198 --> 00:48:50.730\nwe're gonna do that and,\nthen we're gonna do install that NSI.\n\n1005\n00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:54.270\nSo it's gonna grab all that, publisher\nof the software cannot be trusted.\n\n1006\n00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:56.050\nWe know all that, we've seen that already.\n\n1007\n00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:56.680\nIt's no big deal.\n\n1008\n00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.390\nWe're just going to go ahead and\nwe're going to click Yes.\n\n1009\n00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:03.170\nAll right, so now we have that and\nthen it looks like to us,\n\n1010\n00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:05.370\nif we aren't paying attention,\noh hey, summary.\n\n1011\n00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:06.110\nWow.\nSucceeded.\n\n1012\n00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:06.740\nWe're done.\n\n1013\n00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.690\nNo.\nThat's just the import of the file.\n\n1014\n00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:11.970\nNow we actually have to go in and\nwe have to look at general information and\n\n1015\n00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:15.590\nget requirements and dependencies,\nwhich is really where the magic happens.\n\n1016\n00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:19.010\nSo you don't wanna get fooled by the fact\nthat we see that, because if you take\n\n1017\n00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:23.380\na look here, what you'll actually see,\nthat's just the import successful, but\n\n1018\n00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:26.070\nthen below, Requirements and\nDependencies are coming up, and\n\n1019\n00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:29.270\nthat's where we actually have to make some\nchoices about the content deployment type.\n\n1020\n00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:30.410\nSo we're gonna do that right now.\n\n1021\n00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.570\nClick Next.\n\n1022\n00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.370\nWe then have general information.\n\n1023\n00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:38.030\nThis is that stuff that Mike was\ntalking about that we already saw,\n\n1024\n00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:41.280\nthat is effectively being provided,\nright, where we have a name,\n\n1025\n00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.730\nwe have to specify a name for\nthe deployment type.\n\n1026\n00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.230\nWe have the install program,\nthe install behavior, etc.\n\n1027\n00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:48.800\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do this.\n\n1028\n00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:54.110\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nmake sure that we do the following.\n\n1029\n00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:55.110\nLet me just get out of this here.\n\n1030\n00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:57.070\nWe're going to do install behavior.\n\n1031\n00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:03.420\nInstall is, let me just see, do da doo,\ninstall is for system resource or user.\n\n1032\n00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.240\nSo we're just going to set that\nthe way we did the other one and\n\n1033\n00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:12.920\nwe're going to make sure we go ahead and\nclick next.\n\n1034\n00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.460\nOh, by the way, let me just show you one\nquick thing I forgot to mention this.\n\n1035\n00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:19.460\nJust in case you are doing multilingual\nsupport, notice there for languages,\n\n1036\n00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:22.420\nyou could actually hit select,\nif we do have a need for\n\n1037\n00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.770\nsupporting multilingual installs, we can\nactually select language sets there and\n\n1038\n00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:28.960\nspecify what languages or\nwhat versions of the program and\n\n1039\n00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.950\nwhat languages we actually would\nmeet as criteria for deployment.\n\n1040\n00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:35.110\nSo I just wanted to point that out to\nyou because I forgot to mention that.\n\n1041\n00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:39.380\nSo then we have Requirements here, and so\non Requirements we're going to click Add,\n\n1042\n00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:44.260\nand then we have our Requirements\nwhere we have Category,\n\n1043\n00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.860\nwe have Condition, we have Value,\nwe have Operator, and\n\n1044\n00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.690\nyou can see for\ninstance with this one we're saying that\n\n1045\n00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:54.840\nthe device has a total physical amount of\nmemory greater than or equal to something.\n\n1046\n00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.820\nSo we've got to be actually very\nprescriptive here about what it is we want\n\n1047\n00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.480\nthe conditions to be in\norder to do a deployment.\n\n1048\n00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.450\nYou know only deploy this on systems\nthat have 4 gigs of memory or more.\n\n1049\n00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:06.900\nYou know certain software needs a certain\namount of memory to run, things like that.\n\n1050\n00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.290\nWe could easily do this and\n\n1051\n00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:09.940\nthere's a bunch of stuff we\ncould pull down in there.\n\n1052\n00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.520\nThis is just one example but\nwe can do any of these things.\n\n1053\n00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.620\nSo it's kind of interesting\nbecause we can go in and\n\n1054\n00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:20.760\nunder category we have as you can see\nthere we have custom device and or user.\n\n1055\n00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:24.730\nSo we can actually specify this\nacross multiple categories and\n\n1056\n00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:31.110\nthen depending on what we choose\nwe have a bunch of conditions.\n\n1057\n00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:36.430\nSo under device we have active directory\nsite, configuration manager site so\n\n1058\n00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:40.840\nwe can say only if it's in this site, Cpu,\nspeed, disk space, number of processors,\n\n1059\n00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.720\nOS, OS language, OU, Ownership,\nTotal physical memory and\n\n1060\n00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:49.540\nor Windows Store inactive,\nwhich means it is or is not in the store.\n\n1061\n00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.590\nSo interesting we're gonna not, whether it\nis or is not in the store rather, whether\n\n1062\n00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:56.230\nthe store app is active or not active\non that machine is what I meant to say.\n\n1063\n00:51:56.230 --> 00:52:00.270\nSo we cannot actually decide on\na bunch of different conditions and\n\n1064\n00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.810\nthen create values and\nwe'll associate it with that, right?\n\n1065\n00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.360\nThis is actually pretty neat.\n\n1066\n00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.280\nThis is a newer feature set as well,\nthis would not have been available\n\n1067\n00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.790\nsome of the prior versions so what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n1068\n00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:15.945\nwe're gonna, going to choose 1,024\nhere for total physical memory.\n\n1069\n00:52:15.945 --> 00:52:17.265\nSo we're gonna put in value.\n\n1070\n00:52:17.265 --> 00:52:19.335\nIn other words, 1 megabyte of memory.\n\n1071\n00:52:19.335 --> 00:52:21.780\nAll right, cuz 1,024,\nexcuse me, 1 gigabyte.\n\n1072\n00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.385\n1,024 megabytes is 1 gigabyte\nis what I meant to say.\n\n1073\n00:52:24.385 --> 00:52:27.625\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna do that and then we'll click OK.\n\n1074\n00:52:27.625 --> 00:52:32.800\nSo that's gonna be our requirement or\nour rule that we're gonna set up and\n\n1075\n00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.100\nthen we could obviously stack\nthese up if we chose to.\n\n1076\n00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:38.130\nWe could go and\ntake a look at dependencies.\n\n1077\n00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:44.210\nIf we have any software dependencies\nhere this would effectively tell us\n\n1078\n00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:48.180\nthat there may be other things that have\nto happen before we actually can do this.\n\n1079\n00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.580\nAnd so there may be other packages that\nwould have to be deployed we may have set\n\n1080\n00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:55.460\nup a dependency in this sequencing of this\nparticular product where we say, hey.\n\n1081\n00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:59.570\nBefore you install winZip, install Adobe\nAcrobat, and then we would have to check\n\n1082\n00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:02.140\nto make sure Acrobat is there,\nbefore we actually do that.\n\n1083\n00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.550\nSo, that will be available to us here,\nwe can add those in if we wanted to,\n\n1084\n00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:06.690\nwe don't have any of those,\n\n1085\n00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:10.700\nbut we had a need to do that, we could\nset that up and sequence that here.\n\n1086\n00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.890\nWe're just going to click next,\nwe're just gonna let that finish up.\n\n1087\n00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:18.040\nJust scroll down here and hit next,\nwatch that work for a minute or two.\n\n1088\n00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.620\nThis doesn't take very long, so all we're\ndoing is really just creating the rule,\n\n1089\n00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:23.610\nand then just saying, put it out there so\nthat we associate it with it.\n\n1090\n00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:25.870\nAnd then close that back up and\nsave that so\n\n1091\n00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:29.010\nwe have the deployment type\nassociated with the application.\n\n1092\n00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:34.110\nSo as soon as that finishes up, what we'll\nthen be able to do is be able to go on and\n\n1093\n00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.580\nactually deploy the application\nbecause we've created it,\n\n1094\n00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.240\nwe've created the deployment type for it.\n\n1095\n00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.070\nSo we've specified, hey, make sure\nyou have this amount of memory and\n\n1096\n00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:44.625\nthen once we do that, we're now gonna\nwork on, or we will in just a moment,\n\n1097\n00:53:44.625 --> 00:53:47.905\nwork on actually deploying the\napplication, how we're going to do that.\n\n1098\n00:53:47.905 --> 00:53:51.735\nSo we'll be going in and we'll,\nI'm sorry you were going to say something?\n\n1099\n00:53:51.735 --> 00:53:53.415\nNope? Okay.\nThen you should not open your mouth and\n\n1100\n00:53:53.415 --> 00:53:55.065\nmake a noise because I\nthought you were going to.\n\n1101\n00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:58.430\nThat's the universal sign for I'd like\nto say something please stop talking.\n\n1102\n00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:59.510\nAll right.\nSo, we're going to then go in you\n\n1103\n00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:00.160\ncan see it finish here.\n\n1104\n00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.390\nWe'll get back to it in a second.\n\n1105\n00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:04.680\nWe're gonna go in and we're gonna right\nclick on the application and what we're\n\n1106\n00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.380\nthen gonna have to do is actually decide\nhow we're going to do the deployment.\n\n1107\n00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.005\nMeaning, we're gonna have go out and we're\nactually going to get it out there and\n\n1108\n00:54:12.005 --> 00:54:14.275\nset it up so\nwe can actually have it show up somewhere.\n\n1109\n00:54:14.275 --> 00:54:18.315\nSo let's click close, and let's take\na look at what we're gonna do next here.\n\n1110\n00:54:18.315 --> 00:54:20.905\nSo let me close that out, and let's go in.\n\n1111\n00:54:20.905 --> 00:54:25.575\nWe're gonna get back to our application,\nwe're going to actually scroll up just\n\n1112\n00:54:25.575 --> 00:54:31.590\na smidge so we can see that up at the top,\nand then when we right-click,\n\n1113\n00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:35.240\nwe're going to have the ability, and\nI'm gonna kinda highlight there, and\n\n1114\n00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.810\njust zoom in for a second so you can see\nit on the menu, we have the ability to be\n\n1115\n00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:42.870\nable to either simulate a deployment,\nto deploy and or distribute content.\n\n1116\n00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:45.390\nWe have to just figure out\nexactly what we're gonna do.\n\n1117\n00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:46.270\nWe have some options.\n\n1118\n00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:49.690\nSo simulate deployment allows us to walk\nthrough what that deployment would look\n\n1119\n00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:53.930\nlike, do a what if analysis in effect, but\nnot actually push the application out.\n\n1120\n00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:55.980\nSo what would happen if\nwe did use those rules?\n\n1121\n00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.670\nWhat would happen if we did it?\n\n1122\n00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:59.450\nHow many people would get it?\n\n1123\n00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:00.120\nWould it show up?\n\n1124\n00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:00.780\nWould it work?\n\n1125\n00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:04.440\nAnd if there are [COUGH], excuse me,\nif there are gonna be errors,\n\n1126\n00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.170\nif there are errors, what's gonna happen\nis we're gonna get a report on that and\n\n1127\n00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:09.560\nthen as a result of that,\n\n1128\n00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.290\nwe actually then can take some action\nto fix it before we have a problem.\n\n1129\n00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:13.810\n>> Nice.\n>> So that's what simulate deployment will\n\n1130\n00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:15.500\nbe, and\nwe'll take a look at how to do that.\n\n1131\n00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.940\nThe Deploy is actually hey,\npush it out the door and go, right?\n\n1132\n00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.580\nGet it out there and\nthen Distribute Content,\n\n1133\n00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:24.410\npeople often get confused between\nDeploy and Distribute Content.\n\n1134\n00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:26.870\nWhat Distribute Content does is\nit actually distributes it to\n\n1135\n00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.530\nthe distribution points to get it ready,\nwe're staging as opposed to deployment,\n\n1136\n00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.550\nwhich is actually then to actually\npush the application out.\n\n1137\n00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:35.550\nSo we're gonna take a look at these and\nkinda walk through them.\n\n1138\n00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:41.400\nSo let's start with going in and\nlet's do a deployment.\n\n1139\n00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.810\nSo we'll click on Deploy, we'll just\ntake a look at this real quickly.\n\n1140\n00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:51.190\nNow, interesting, let me just\ncome scroll down here, all right.\n\n1141\n00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:52.227\nSo let's zoom in, so\n\n1142\n00:55:52.227 --> 00:55:55.753\nfirst thing we're gonna do is we're\ngonna have to choose a collection.\n\n1143\n00:55:55.753 --> 00:55:59.108\nThat we wanna be able to target for\nthis particular deployment you can see\n\n1144\n00:55:59.108 --> 00:56:01.754\nthere collection, we have to browse,\nset one up there.\n\n1145\n00:56:01.754 --> 00:56:05.337\nAnd then make a choice that we know\nwhere we are going to deploy this thing.\n\n1146\n00:56:05.337 --> 00:56:09.792\nLet us click browse and let us specify\nwhether we want to do a user or\n\n1147\n00:56:09.792 --> 00:56:14.248\na devise collections remember I\nsaid at certain points we will see\n\n1148\n00:56:14.248 --> 00:56:18.160\nboth as oppose to only seeing\none option on the pull down.\n\n1149\n00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.579\nSo we're gonna be able to chose whether\nwe want to deploy this to users and or\n\n1150\n00:56:21.579 --> 00:56:22.190\nto devices.\n\n1151\n00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:23.550\nIt will be up to us to decide.\n\n1152\n00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:28.280\nNow remember our deployment type that we\ncreated was specified around devices,\n\n1153\n00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.212\nbecause users, at least not right now\nanyway, don't have memory in their heads.\n\n1154\n00:56:31.212 --> 00:56:32.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And as a result of that,\n\n1155\n00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.100\nwe can't measure that.\n\n1156\n00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:34.440\nThis is not Johnny Mnemonic, right.\n\n1157\n00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.640\n>> Yes.\n>> You ever see that movie?\n\n1158\n00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.190\n>> Great movie, yeah.\n\n1159\n00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:37.510\n>> Keanu Reeves' finest work.\n\n1160\n00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:38.050\n>> Yes.\n\n1161\n00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:38.710\n>> No doubt about it.\n\n1162\n00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:39.967\nAnd that doesn't say very much for him.\n\n1163\n00:56:39.967 --> 00:56:42.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But that is there.\n\n1164\n00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:43.900\nSo what we have is\nthe ability to decide this.\n\n1165\n00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.300\nSo we're gonna choose to\ndo a device collection.\n\n1166\n00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.820\nSo we'll just pull that up, and\nthen obviously see what's there.\n\n1167\n00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:53.270\nWhen we look for that, what we're gonna\ndo is make sure that we figure out\n\n1168\n00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:56.560\nwhat collection is that we\nwould actually going to target.\n\n1169\n00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.880\nIn this case we will do all desktops and\nservers which I think is yeah,\n\n1170\n00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.420\nright there up at the top.\n\n1171\n00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:02.680\nI am going to set that up.\n\n1172\n00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.920\nWe'll specify that.\n\n1173\n00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.090\nWe're going to go ahead and we're going\nto click okay and when we have done,\n\n1174\n00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:11.700\nwhen we do that it says hey,\nthat collection doesn't have any members.\n\n1175\n00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.444\nSo let me zoom in,\n\n1176\n00:57:12.444 --> 00:57:16.140\nso you can see that real quick, it says\nthat collection doesn't have any members.\n\n1177\n00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.310\nIf it doesn't have any members in it,\nit's going to warn us and say hey,\n\n1178\n00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:19.220\nyou know what?\n\n1179\n00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.690\nThere's no way I could do a deployment\nthere because there's nothing there.\n\n1180\n00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:24.320\nSo you've got to understand that\nyou have to choose a collection\n\n1181\n00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.860\nthat actually has members in it.\n\n1182\n00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:28.350\nNow ours don't have any members, most of\nthem don't have any members in them, so\n\n1183\n00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:30.400\nwe're not going to actually\nreally use that one.\n\n1184\n00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.240\nI just wanted to show you\nthat you'll get an error, or\n\n1185\n00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.450\na warning in effect, if that's the case,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n1186\n00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:40.190\nWhat we're going to do is the following,\nlet's actually change that real quick to\n\n1187\n00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:46.060\nsomething that we do have, a set of\nitems in, so device collection, and\n\n1188\n00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.360\nlet's do all systems, because all systems\nactually have some members in it, so we'll\n\n1189\n00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:54.620\ndo that one, and then we'll click Next,\nand then when we do that, we have content.\n\n1190\n00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:56.930\nNow this is the interesting part.\n\n1191\n00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:59.360\nScroll down so you can see this.\n\n1192\n00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:06.140\nIf we do a deployment, right, and we\ndon't choose to distribute content first.\n\n1193\n00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:09.620\nSo we don't put it out at the distribution\npoint first, we jump right to deployment.\n\n1194\n00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:14.070\nWe have to then put the deployment or\nrather put the distribution point in and\n\n1195\n00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:18.420\nspecify it here as part of the deployment,\nso we know how to stage the content.\n\n1196\n00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.430\nIf we distribute content first, and\n\n1197\n00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.700\nthen do it we can just select the\ndistribution points that's already there.\n\n1198\n00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:27.300\nSo this is kind of an all-in-one,\nas opposed to doing a two-step.\n\n1199\n00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:29.230\nDistribute content first and then deploy.\n\n1200\n00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:30.630\nIt's up to us, it doesn't matter.\n\n1201\n00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:31.950\nWorks the same way either way,\n\n1202\n00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:35.350\nbecause you'll see here we\ncan add distribution points.\n\n1203\n00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:35.910\nRight?\n\n1204\n00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:38.560\nSo we have the option to\nadd distribution points in,\n\n1205\n00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.820\nif they have not already\nreceived the content.\n\n1206\n00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:44.640\nBut notice in the box up top there,\nit says distribution point or\n\n1207\n00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:48.980\ndistribution point groups that the content\nhas been distributed to already.\n\n1208\n00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.840\nAnd it's blank because we\nhaven't done anything.\n\n1209\n00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:53.920\nBut if we had,\nit would actually show up there.\n\n1210\n00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.140\nAnd so\nlet's just quickly take a look at that.\n\n1211\n00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.260\nWe'll just cancel out of here for\na second.\n\n1212\n00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:01.100\n>> So it might be a situation where\nyou've deployed it once to a particular\n\n1213\n00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.190\ncollection, had distributed for\nthat deployment.\n\n1214\n00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:05.750\nNow we're deciding to deploy it again.\n\n1215\n00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.130\nIt's already been distributed.\n\n1216\n00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.340\n>> It could be right and then we're going\nto deploy to a different collection so\n\n1217\n00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.500\nit will already be there,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n1218\n00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:17.310\nSo if we decide that we're gonna go in and\ndistribute content instead, right?\n\n1219\n00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:20.310\nWhat would happen is, we get\nthe Distribute Content Wizard running,\n\n1220\n00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:22.320\nlittle bit of a different wizard,\njust wanna show it to you so\n\n1221\n00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.860\nyou can have a sense of it right?\n\n1222\n00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.860\nThis here is just give me\nthe name of the content.\n\n1223\n00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.180\nWe have that, no big deal.\n\n1224\n00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:27.920\nWhat content?\n\n1225\n00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.500\nWell we want the Winzip application.\n\n1226\n00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.640\nSo we've got that there and\n\n1227\n00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.570\nthen this is where we add\nthe distribution point in, right?\n\n1228\n00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.880\nAnd so we add it in by\npulling it down from there.\n\n1229\n00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.310\nAdding it in so we're gonna do that.\n\n1230\n00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:43.230\nAnd when we add it in here, we can do\nadd collection distribution point or\n\n1231\n00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:44.510\ndistribution point groups.\n\n1232\n00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:46.060\nWe don't have just distribution\npoint groups yet so\n\n1233\n00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.040\nwe're just gonna choose\na distribution point.\n\n1234\n00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.580\nAnd when we do that, we have our\ndistribution points already there.\n\n1235\n00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:58.743\nWe're gonna just check off the box,\nselect it, Click OK.\n\n1236\n00:59:58.743 --> 01:00:00.880\nIt's now there, click Next.\n\n1237\n01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.840\nAnd just let that finish.\n\n1238\n01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.880\nIt's not a very big package,\nshouldn't take very long at all.\n\n1239\n01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.140\nWe'll click Close.\n\n1240\n01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:10.140\nAnd so that is now being staged\nto the distribution point.\n\n1241\n01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:10.740\nThat will show up.\n\n1242\n01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.280\nAnd then if we run the wizard again, and\n\n1243\n01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.470\nwe'll run it just to show you, when we\nrun the application deployment, it's\n\n1244\n01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:18.450\nactually gonna already show up in the top\nbox, and say oh hey, I'm already there.\n\n1245\n01:00:18.450 --> 01:00:21.250\nYou can just keep going,\ncuz you don't have to worry about it now.\n\n1246\n01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.390\nSo we can do either one of those right?\n\n1247\n01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:29.630\nAnd so what we can actually take\na look at, is just come down.\n\n1248\n01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.370\nGo back to deployments.\n\n1249\n01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:34.350\nAlright, and, so, now, let's just go in.\n\n1250\n01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:37.020\nLet's come back here.\n\n1251\n01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.470\nLet's do our deployment again.\n\n1252\n01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.270\nJust rerun the wizard.\n\n1253\n01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.310\nRight?\n\n1254\n01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:43.583\nGo grab our collection.\n\n1255\n01:00:50.261 --> 01:00:54.487\nAnd then, and you'll see that now,\nwe already have\n\n1256\n01:00:54.487 --> 01:00:59.483\nthe distribution point sitting\nthere selected because we did\n\n1257\n01:00:59.483 --> 01:01:05.065\nthe deploy content outside,\nit's already been batched in here.\n\n1258\n01:01:05.065 --> 01:01:07.555\nAnd so it's already part of the process so\nwe can effectively\n\n1259\n01:01:07.555 --> 01:01:11.085\nnot have a necessary need, or\nneed rather to be able to make a choice.\n\n1260\n01:01:11.085 --> 01:01:12.975\nThis is already staged, so it's up to us.\n\n1261\n01:01:12.975 --> 01:01:14.045\nWe can do it either way.\n\n1262\n01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:17.070\nLot of people get confused by\nthose options and don't realize.\n\n1263\n01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:20.120\nThat deploy incorporates,\ndistribute if you haven't done it,\n\n1264\n01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.850\nwhereas distribute is just put it\nout to the distribution point.\n\n1265\n01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:24.150\nIt's not about the deployment.\n\n1266\n01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:26.450\nIt's just one step in the overall process.\n\n1267\n01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:29.220\nSo we're gonna continue, hit Next here.\n\n1268\n01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.930\nAction, what are we gonna do?\n\n1269\n01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.330\nRemember we talked about the fact\nthat if we want to install or\n\n1270\n01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:38.700\nuninstall, we must create an application,\ndo a deployment either way.\n\n1271\n01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.190\nSo the default is install.\n\n1272\n01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.820\nIf we wanna uninstall,\n\n1273\n01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.280\nwe create an uninstall application and\nredeploy to uninstall.\n\n1274\n01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.490\nSo it's kind of interesting,\nso we can do that.\n\n1275\n01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:49.910\nWe can't uninstall until we install,\nhowever.\n\n1276\n01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:51.600\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n1277\n01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.030\nAnd then we're going to go ahead and\nwe are going to decide\n\n1278\n01:01:56.030 --> 01:02:00.930\nwhether our Purpose here is\ngonna be Available or Required.\n\n1279\n01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:05.910\nRequired means that we are specifying that\neverybody must have it Available means\n\n1280\n01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:08.900\nit's optional, users can decide whether or\nnot they're gonna use it.\n\n1281\n01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.270\nSo we can see we have the ability\nto do the install run.\n\n1282\n01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:15.430\nAnd Installing, as I was also\ntalking about, we can go through and\n\n1283\n01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.920\ndecide how we're gonna\nset the software up.\n\n1284\n01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.110\nIs it going to be available,\nis it gonna be required or\n\n1285\n01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:22.480\npurpose in other words is\nan option here as well.\n\n1286\n01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.950\nWe can kinda hold that down and\nzoom in real quick and see that.\n\n1287\n01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:30.026\nThen you'll see that we also have the\noption on the gray outbox that we haven't\n\n1288\n01:02:30.026 --> 01:02:31.690\nset yet required there.\n\n1289\n01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:34.670\nRequire administrator approval if\nusers request this application.\n\n1290\n01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:37.490\nCan actually have an opt-in where\nthe user can request it, but\n\n1291\n01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:40.610\nas a result of that,\nwe then actually could go in and you know,\n\n1292\n01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:42.780\ncheck off whether that it is the case or\nnot.\n\n1293\n01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.620\nIf we choose required,\n\n1294\n01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.664\nwe also get the ability to pre-deploy\nto the user's primary device.\n\n1295\n01:02:50.664 --> 01:02:54.470\nIf we have device affinity set up, and\nwe'll talk about device affinity in one of\n\n1296\n01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:58.740\nthe upcoming episodes with the application\nwebsite, the application catalog.\n\n1297\n01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.640\nSo we'll take a look at that, but\nthe general idea is there, that we\n\n1298\n01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.010\ncan specify or have the user specify, hey\nthis is my primary device, and if it is,\n\n1299\n01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:09.790\nI want the software that I'm supposed\nto have on that device at all times.\n\n1300\n01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:11.050\nWe can actually pre populate and\n\n1301\n01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:15.530\npreload required software based on device\naffinity if we check that box off.\n\n1302\n01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:18.110\nWe could do a wake on land to\ndo the deployment because,\n\n1303\n01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:22.980\nsince it's required it must be installed\nwhether a device is available fully up and\n\n1304\n01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.390\nrunning or in sleep mode.\n\n1305\n01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:27.710\nRemember awake on land is typically going\nto be something we see on servers not\n\n1306\n01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:28.530\non work station.\n\n1307\n01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:31.200\nRight.\nYou putting your lid down on your\n\n1308\n01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.660\nlaptop and putting your laptop to\nsleep is effectively the same idea,\n\n1309\n01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.820\nbut the reality is, we don't tend to\nworry about that on the user desktop,\n\n1310\n01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.120\nwe worry about it on servers that may have\npower management associated with them\n\n1311\n01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.590\nthat may power cycle down and power cycle\nup in the data center to conserve energy.\n\n1312\n01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:49.150\nSo, we can send awake on land,\nwhat's called a WLL packet out there\n\n1313\n01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:52.230\nto effectively bring the server up and\nthen deploy to it.\n\n1314\n01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:54.240\nSo, this is kinda what\nwe're thinking about there.\n\n1315\n01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.628\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n1316\n01:03:55.628 --> 01:03:59.462\nSo, we have some nice options would\nyou require verses available.\n\n1317\n01:03:59.462 --> 01:04:01.462\nBe up to us,\nwe'll set the back to available.\n\n1318\n01:04:01.462 --> 01:04:04.711\nSo we're gonna do that and\nthen click Next here.\n\n1319\n01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:07.490\nThen this is also a pretty cool one,\nI like this a lot.\n\n1320\n01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:11.220\nA lot of my customers are,\nI have customers all over the world, so\n\n1321\n01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.200\nI have people that are going to be\nworking in different time zones.\n\n1322\n01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.280\nAnd this is nice because we can schedule\nthis deployment and do it based on UTC so\n\n1323\n01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.030\nwe could specify\nUniversal Time Coordination.\n\n1324\n01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:25.429\nSo when we say it's five o'clock somewhere\nall the time, it is really always five\n\n1325\n01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:30.023\no'clock somewhere, and we could specify\nthat this deployment only happens based on\n\n1326\n01:04:30.023 --> 01:04:33.130\nthat time localized for\nevery time zone that we exist in.\n\n1327\n01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:36.380\nBecause which you don't want to do, is\nsay you wanted to deploy at five o'clock\n\n1328\n01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.817\neastern time and that would be three\no'clock in the morning somewhere else, and\n\n1329\n01:04:39.817 --> 01:04:42.490\nit's two o'clock in\nthe afternoon somewhere else.\n\n1330\n01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:45.120\nBecause then that screws with not\nonly your maintenance windows but\n\n1331\n01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.300\nit can also screw up people who are live\non those systems in real time, right?\n\n1332\n01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.930\nSo we can set that up, schedule it.\n\n1333\n01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:53.350\nNotice we have a calendar option,\nas well as a time option.\n\n1334\n01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:55.280\nWe can actually drop\nthat a month from now,\n\n1335\n01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.190\nat two o'clock in the morning,\nglobally if we choose to.\n\n1336\n01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:59.160\n>> Wow, that is cool.\n\n1337\n01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.730\n>> That is kinda cool.\n\n1338\n01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.500\nRight?\nSo we can do that if we choose to.\n\n1339\n01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:08.768\nWe have User Experience, cuz we actually\ncare about what users are able to do.\n\n1340\n01:05:08.768 --> 01:05:10.838\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I typically don't.\n\n1341\n01:05:10.838 --> 01:05:14.000\nIn theory that's the rumor anyways,\nis that we should do that.\n\n1342\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.719\nSo I should at least tell you that we can,\n\n1343\n01:05:15.719 --> 01:05:18.308\neven though I don't really care\nabout what happens to them.\n\n1344\n01:05:18.308 --> 01:05:23.262\nI just care about deploying my software,\ncuz I'm managing a software management\n\n1345\n01:05:23.262 --> 01:05:26.583\nservice not a user experience\nservice when I use SCCM.\n\n1346\n01:05:26.583 --> 01:05:27.420\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1347\n01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:31.073\n>> Display in Software Center, and only\nshow notifications for computer restarts\n\n1348\n01:05:31.073 --> 01:05:34.155\nand/or display in Software Center and\nshow all notifications.\n\n1349\n01:05:34.155 --> 01:05:38.255\nMeaning, hey we're installing, hey we're\ninstalling, hey we're done installing.\n\n1350\n01:05:38.255 --> 01:05:40.710\nNo, just, hey we're done installing,\nby the way we're restarting.\n\n1351\n01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:41.625\n>> Right.\n>> You have the option,\n\n1352\n01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:44.385\nyou figure out what you want done there,\nthat will be up to you.\n\n1353\n01:05:44.385 --> 01:05:46.043\nYou know what my preference is, right?\n\n1354\n01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:47.835\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> Only show for restart.\n\n1355\n01:05:47.835 --> 01:05:50.695\nIf I could automate that and not show\nanything and just restart I would.\n\n1356\n01:05:50.695 --> 01:05:52.645\nBut that's obviously up to me.\n\n1357\n01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:57.560\nAnd then we have alerts here,\nso we can go in and\n\n1358\n01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.060\nwe can specify when we generate alerts and\nunder what conditions.\n\n1359\n01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:07.210\nWe also can, as I think I talked about,\nuse the System Center Ops manager\n\n1360\n01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:09.441\nif we are setting this up\nin a suite of products,\n\n1361\n01:06:09.441 --> 01:06:12.780\nto be able to deal with maintenance\nmode on the servers, so we don't set off\n\n1362\n01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:16.240\nalarm bells when we start doing patch\nmanagement and things like that.\n\n1363\n01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.283\nSo we can specify that, and\nwe can also generate alerts in SCOM,\n\n1364\n01:06:20.283 --> 01:06:22.750\nso that way we have a record of\nthe fact that we did the install,\n\n1365\n01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:24.710\nby checking that box off, if we choose to.\n\n1366\n01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:25.930\nSo we have some options there.\n\n1367\n01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:30.850\nThose really only make sense if you are\nintegrating System Center Config Manager\n\n1368\n01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:32.950\nwith System Center Ops Manager, but\n\n1369\n01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:35.420\nif you're not then obviously those\noptions really don't mean anything.\n\n1370\n01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.770\nThey're not going to matter to you.\n\n1371\n01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:38.040\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1372\n01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.950\nThen we have a little summary,\nclick Next there.\n\n1373\n01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:45.910\nWe go ahead, get that set up, she doesn't\ntake very long, it's a very small package,\n\n1374\n01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:49.750\nor very small application, rather,\nand then we have done that and\n\n1375\n01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:54.860\nthen what we will see is that now,\non the Deployment tab,\n\n1376\n01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.880\non the bottom there, remember before we\nhad no deployments, now, all of a sudden,\n\n1377\n01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.170\nwe have one, because we just\nwent ahead and we did that.\n\n1378\n01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:02.160\nSo, we've actually done the deployment,\nright.\n\n1379\n01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.100\nAnd we have all that set up and\nnow that we've done the deployment,\n\n1380\n01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:09.440\nin theory if we waited long enough that\nsoftware, the application that we set up\n\n1381\n01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.620\nand deployed, would actually show up and\nthen we'd be able to use it, in theory.\n\n1382\n01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:13.250\n>> Yay.\n\n1383\n01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:14.470\n>> Yay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1384\n01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:15.630\n>> So that's how we do\n\n1385\n01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:17.840\nan application based deployment.\n\n1386\n01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.730\nSo now what we're gonna do,\nis were gonna go ahead and\n\n1387\n01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:24.622\ntake a look at how to do\na package based deployment.\n\n1388\n01:07:24.622 --> 01:07:26.800\nWe've done applications,\nnow were gonna do a package,\n\n1389\n01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.790\nwhich is the other side of the divide,\nin effect, cuz we may do one or both,\n\n1390\n01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:32.210\nit just depends on how\nwe choose to do this.\n\n1391\n01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:33.290\nIt'll be up to us.\n\n1392\n01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:36.860\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nselect packages, off to the left there.\n\n1393\n01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:40.090\nWe all ready took a look at the two\npackages that are there, and\n\n1394\n01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:43.450\nwe're gonna right click, and we're gonna\ngo ahead and choose to do a new package.\n\n1395\n01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.620\nSo I'm gonna right-click, and\nI'm gonna create a package.\n\n1396\n01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:49.040\nJust gonna choose that real quick.\n\n1397\n01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.110\nBring up our create package wizard, so\njust scroll down so you could see that.\n\n1398\n01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:55.250\nWe're gonna have to give it a name.\n\n1399\n01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:58.290\nYou could see we have the option for\na name there, language, version, etc.\n\n1400\n01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:00.870\nThose are optional items,\nit's up to us, but\n\n1401\n01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:03.640\nthis package contains source\nfiles is not optional,\n\n1402\n01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.690\nbecause we need that in order to figure\nout what we're going to deploy, right?\n\n1403\n01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:08.100\nSo we're going to go ahead and\ngive it a name.\n\n1404\n01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:12.025\nSo we'll call this Snoopy.\n\n1405\n01:08:12.025 --> 01:08:17.424\n>> [LAUGH]\nCuz, today's just a Snoopy like day.\n\n1406\n01:08:17.424 --> 01:08:21.770\nThis package contains source files, so\nwe have to specify the source folder.\n\n1407\n01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:25.060\nSo what we're gonna do is the following,\nwe're going to go back out and\n\n1408\n01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.200\ngrab that software.\n\n1409\n01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:36.356\nSo we're just gonna type in our\n>> [CROSSTALK].\n\n1410\n01:08:36.356 --> 01:08:38.350\nOkay, we'll just browse for a step.\n\n1411\n01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:40.049\nNo big deal.\nIt's just one of those things.\n\n1412\n01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.966\nAll right so we will go a head and\nwe'll type it in.\n\n1413\n01:08:41.966 --> 01:08:49.500\nWe are going to type in our path,\nPLABDC01 and then we'll do SW.\n\n1414\n01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:55.895\nAnd we will do, we're doing 7-Zip\nthis time, so we'll do 7-Zip.\n\n1415\n01:08:55.895 --> 01:08:59.450\nAnd then grab that one, there we go.\n\n1416\n01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:02.150\nAnd then click OK.\n\n1417\n01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:04.890\nSo we have that sitting there,\ngot our path statement.\n\n1418\n01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:05.970\nWe'll click Next.\n\n1419\n01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:09.850\nAnd then we have to specify\nour program type and\n\n1420\n01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:12.050\nyou'll see that we have some options.\n\n1421\n01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:14.750\nWe can do standard program,\ncreate a program for\n\n1422\n01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:18.990\na client computer, program for device,\nthat's gonna be a mobile device, or\n\n1423\n01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:22.830\ndo not create a program, create\na package but do not create the program.\n\n1424\n01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:24.780\nWe can then add the program in later.\n\n1425\n01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.990\nSo we can create the package which\nremembers the wrapper, the container, but\n\n1426\n01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:30.500\nthen put the guts in after\nthe fact if we choose to.\n\n1427\n01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.390\nIt is up to us to decide how to do that.\n\n1428\n01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:33.270\nWe are going to go ahead and\n\n1429\n01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:37.692\nchoose standard program cuz, we are going\nto go ahead and do a deployment out to, or\n\n1430\n01:09:37.692 --> 01:09:41.050\npotentially anyway, I will show you how to\ndo a deployment out to a client computer.\n\n1431\n01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:42.290\nSo we will click Next there.\n\n1432\n01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:47.390\nWe then have to specify name and all\nthe stuff that we are going to need, so\n\n1433\n01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:52.580\nwe're gonna go ahead and we are going\nto fill in some information here.\n\n1434\n01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.160\nSo let's do the following.\n\n1435\n01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.070\nWe'll give it a name.\n\n1436\n01:09:55.070 --> 01:10:01.510\nWe'll call this winzip or\n7-zip rather is what we're doing.\n\n1437\n01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:04.020\nSo let's do 7-zip just so\nwe can keep track of it.\n\n1438\n01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.610\nSo we'll do 7-zip.\n\n1439\n01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:10.910\nThen on command line,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll browse.\n\n1440\n01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:13.400\nGive that a second.\n\n1441\n01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:17.856\nAnd we'll go out and\nwe'll grab our executable.\n\n1442\n01:10:23.518 --> 01:10:25.858\nLet's go find that real quickly.\n\n1443\n01:10:30.948 --> 01:10:34.734\nIn this case, we're gonna choose our\nMSI file because we have a MSI not or\n\n1444\n01:10:34.734 --> 01:10:35.970\nexecutable.\n\n1445\n01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:40.290\nSo, you'll see I changed it from a .exe\nto All Files and our MSI is there so,\n\n1446\n01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:44.570\nwe're gonna grab our MSI and bring that\nin so, just gonna go ahead and grab that.\n\n1447\n01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:48.875\nSelect that, bring that in, click OK,\nand then you'll see it populate,\n\n1448\n01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:50.880\njust zoom in so you could see that.\n\n1449\n01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.180\nIt's gonna populate there,\noops, there we go, we got that.\n\n1450\n01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.010\nWe've got some information.\n\n1451\n01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:58.080\nWe'll take a look what\nthose setting Settings are.\n\n1452\n01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.930\nSo we've got a Run, and then under Run we\nhave Normal, Minimized, Maximized, Hidden.\n\n1453\n01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:05.410\nSo how are we gonna run this?\n\n1454\n01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:09.620\nWhen we actually do the install, are we\ngonna run it full screen, minimize it,\n\n1455\n01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:13.260\nhide it, hidden is Q, /Q for\nquiet, that kind of thing.\n\n1456\n01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.280\nSo it really depends.\n\n1457\n01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.200\nRemember, if we do this hidden,\n\n1458\n01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.220\nthe user on the system has no idea\nwe're doing it, can't get in the way,\n\n1459\n01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.250\ncan't stop it or freak out when\nit shows up, that kind of thing.\n\n1460\n01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:27.080\nIf we allow them to see it,\nthey may actually screw it up.\n\n1461\n01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.480\nWhich remember, could be an issue.\n\n1462\n01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.720\nSo just be aware of that, and\nunderstand that that may be a problem.\n\n1463\n01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.270\nThen program can run only\nwhen a user is logged on.\n\n1464\n01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:37.775\nWe have some options there.\n\n1465\n01:11:37.775 --> 01:11:40.867\nWe'll see that we can do this whether or\nnot a user is logged on, or\n\n1466\n01:11:40.867 --> 01:11:42.633\nonly when no user is logged on.\n\n1467\n01:11:42.633 --> 01:11:45.235\nSo we may wanna be able to do that\nregardless of the state of the system, so\n\n1468\n01:11:45.235 --> 01:11:47.775\nthat's gonna be very important for\nus to consider.\n\n1469\n01:11:47.775 --> 01:11:50.629\nWe'll do this whether or\nnot a user is logged on.\n\n1470\n01:11:50.629 --> 01:11:55.651\nAnd then if we do only when a user\nis logged on, you'll see we have\n\n1471\n01:11:55.651 --> 01:12:02.254\nthe rights to be able to run with either\nuser rights and/or Administrative rights.\n\n1472\n01:12:02.254 --> 01:12:02.837\nRight?\n\n1473\n01:12:02.837 --> 01:12:07.290\nWe have to use administrative rights\na lot of the time to do a installation.\n\n1474\n01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:12.450\nBut if we choose a top program can run\nwhether or not a user s logged on.\n\n1475\n01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:16.670\nIt defaults automatically to run with\nadministrative rights because that's going\n\n1476\n01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.880\nto imply we have to have admin rights\nbe able to do the installation.\n\n1477\n01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.780\nSo it really just depends\non the choices you make.\n\n1478\n01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.570\nThings change a little bit in other words,\nright?\n\n1479\n01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:25.600\nAs we do that, we're gonna do that.\n\n1480\n01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:30.340\nAnd then, we'll go ahead and\nwe will click Next.\n\n1481\n01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.690\nWe have our Requirements page.\n\n1482\n01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:36.190\nThis is where we can go in, we can specify\nwe wanna run another program first.\n\n1483\n01:12:36.190 --> 01:12:39.900\nSo we may be able to go in and pull in\na program from a dependency standpoint.\n\n1484\n01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.340\nYou'll see it browses there.\n\n1485\n01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.980\nWe can go grab packets and programs.\n\n1486\n01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.120\nHey I want Adobe Acrobat\ninstalled before I do this.\n\n1487\n01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:45.790\nNo problem.\n\n1488\n01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:48.110\nWe can tee that up and\neffectively set that up.\n\n1489\n01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:49.890\nAnd then this one I like a lot.\n\n1490\n01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:51.370\nPlatform requirements,\n\n1491\n01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:54.990\nwe can specify that it'll only be able to\nrun on certain operating system platforms.\n\n1492\n01:12:56.230 --> 01:13:00.890\nSo if you wanna be able to install\nthis only on Windows RT platforms,\n\n1493\n01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:02.970\nas opposed to anything else,\nyou check off that box,\n\n1494\n01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:05.410\nhit that radio button,\nit only installs on RT.\n\n1495\n01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:07.140\nSo it's up to us to decide.\n\n1496\n01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.820\nWe're gonna obviously allow it to\nbe installed on any platform, and\n\n1497\n01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:13.610\nwe're not gonna worry about running other\nprograms, but we could if we wanted to.\n\n1498\n01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:14.560\nAnd then,\n\n1499\n01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:19.110\nin addition, we have one other thing\ndown here which is equally important.\n\n1500\n01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:20.850\nWanna focus in on this.\n\n1501\n01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:23.820\nWe have maximum allowed\nrun time in minutes.\n\n1502\n01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.390\nThe default is 120 minutes or 2 hours.\n\n1503\n01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:28.030\nYou ever have one of those things\nwhere you start installing,\n\n1504\n01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:32.500\nprogram just sits there and waits, and\nwaits, and waits and never finishes?\n\n1505\n01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.245\nYou come back like a year\nlater it's still installing?\n\n1506\n01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:36.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, you've had kids.\n\n1507\n01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.240\nIt's still there.\n\n1508\n01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.020\nThey're in college.\n\n1509\n01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.320\nIt's still installing.\n\n1510\n01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.800\nSo you know if we don't\nset a limit on that,\n\n1511\n01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.430\nit actually could be that\nthe program kicks off, locks up.\n\n1512\n01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:46.980\nAnd unless we interact with\nit in some way and kill it,\n\n1513\n01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.180\nit would just in theory\ncycle there forever.\n\n1514\n01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:52.540\nThis allows us to prevent that behavior\nfrom happening by saying if we hit that\n\n1515\n01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:56.960\nmaximum time limit based on the start of\nthe install and it has not finished, we,\n\n1516\n01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.730\nwell not we, but\nSCCM automatically kills it off and\n\n1517\n01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:02.650\nprevents it from just sitting there and\ncycling.\n\n1518\n01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:04.250\nSo that is gonna be\na real valuable one and\n\n1519\n01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:05.900\nyou wanna make sure your aware of that.\n\n1520\n01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:10.000\nI tend to ratchet that down, I tend to\nput that out about 20 minutes or so.\n\n1521\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.060\nYou don't wanna have 120, that's just\ngonna be a little bit of a ridiculous one,\n\n1522\n01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:18.735\nand I'll usually put\nsomething in there for\n\n1523\n01:14:18.735 --> 01:14:21.655\nthe estimated disk size,\nI'll put in 50 megs.\n\n1524\n01:14:21.655 --> 01:14:24.445\nDoesn't really matter, it's just\nthe estimate, it's just something,\n\n1525\n01:14:24.445 --> 01:14:27.945\nit's better than just unknown, right, so\nthat's the only thing that we'll do there.\n\n1526\n01:14:27.945 --> 01:14:31.415\nOh, I am still working, thank you for\nvolunteering to take care of that for me.\n\n1527\n01:14:31.415 --> 01:14:32.755\nAll right, so we'll take care of that,\n\n1528\n01:14:32.755 --> 01:14:36.325\nlet's just put 20 minutes in there,\nhit next.\n\n1529\n01:14:36.325 --> 01:14:39.630\nAnd then, as all good systems do,\nwe have our little summary screen.\n\n1530\n01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:43.670\nSo we'll do our summary there, this one\nhappens pretty quickly, we'll click close\n\n1531\n01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:49.740\nand then we will have our package,\nand we'll highlight our package,\n\n1532\n01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:54.090\nand we can see that again on\nthe summary screen down below we have,\n\n1533\n01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:59.420\njust some information, we have our unique\npackage ID, PLB00007 there, right?\n\n1534\n01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:03.340\nWe have our status indicator.\n\n1535\n01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.772\nWe have not done anything so\nthere's nothing for\n\n1536\n01:15:05.772 --> 01:15:08.915\nsuccess in progress or fail but\nwe could see that if there was and\n\n1537\n01:15:08.915 --> 01:15:11.655\nwe'd be able to interact\nwith that as we do that.\n\n1538\n01:15:11.655 --> 01:15:15.385\nAnd then we can also highlight and\ngo in here to programs.\n\n1539\n01:15:15.385 --> 01:15:19.770\nWe can see the program that is associated\nwith the package down below here\n\n1540\n01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:22.940\non our tab, so\nwe can see it's the 7zip program.\n\n1541\n01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.980\nAnd if there are any deployments\nassociated with that,\n\n1542\n01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.020\nlike we saw with the other one,\n\n1543\n01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:31.060\nwe'd be able to zoom in and we'd be able\nto see what deployments are there, right?\n\n1544\n01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.078\nSo we could do all that with our program.\n\n1545\n01:15:34.078 --> 01:15:34.704\n>> Nice.\n\n1546\n01:15:34.704 --> 01:15:36.550\n>> Excuse me, with our package, pardon me.\n\n1547\n01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:37.960\nNow that we've done that,\n\n1548\n01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.380\nwe would have to distribute our package\nout to our distribution point right.\n\n1549\n01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.830\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's do that real quick,\n\n1550\n01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:46.330\nyou can never practice that one too much.\n\n1551\n01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:51.595\nSo let's right click on that, and let's\ngo ahead and let's just quickly zoom in,\n\n1552\n01:15:51.595 --> 01:15:53.590\nso now we have another option\nthat we wanna take a look at and\n\n1553\n01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:54.830\nmake sure we're comfortable with.\n\n1554\n01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:57.010\nWe talked about deploy and\ndistribute content.\n\n1555\n01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:59.330\nWe know that but,\nwe didn't see update distribution points.\n\n1556\n01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:00.640\nThat wasn't option that\nwe saw on the other ones.\n\n1557\n01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.940\nSo let's just talk about that one, and\nmake sure we understand the difference,\n\n1558\n01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.650\nnot between deploy and distribute content,\n\n1559\n01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:08.150\ncuz I'm pretty sure you guys\nunderstand that now, but\n\n1560\n01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:11.650\nthe difference between distribute\ncontent and update distribution points.\n\n1561\n01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.680\nSo distribute content as we now, is hey,\n\n1562\n01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.240\nlet's push it out to the distribution\npoint the first time.\n\n1563\n01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.452\nUpdate distribution point is,\n\n1564\n01:16:18.452 --> 01:16:21.390\nhey I've made an update of\nsome kind to the package.\n\n1565\n01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:24.690\nIt's all ready there,\nlet me refresh it and update it.\n\n1566\n01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:28.280\nSo, effectively, I'm redeploying it,\nand I shouldn't use the word redeploy.\n\n1567\n01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.170\nI'm redistributing it to\nthe distribution point with updates.\n\n1568\n01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:34.130\nThat's what update\ndistribution points is for.\n\n1569\n01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:37.310\nYou know, sometimes we'll open up this\npackage, we'll go ahead and we'll say,\n\n1570\n01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:38.570\nyou know, I do wanna create a dependency.\n\n1571\n01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:41.500\nI wanna deploy something else and\nresequence that.\n\n1572\n01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.830\nAnd now, I wanna push that back out\nwith the new and improved version.\n\n1573\n01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:46.380\nUpdate distribution points does that and\n\n1574\n01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:50.318\ngets that out to the distribution points,\nso that's what the difference is there.\n\n1575\n01:16:50.318 --> 01:16:53.220\nSo, just wanna make sure we're aware\nof all of these little options,\n\n1576\n01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:55.190\nthese little nooks and\ncrannies, as I call them.\n\n1577\n01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:58.130\nThey're like the english\nmuffin of the SECM world.\n\n1578\n01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:00.240\nIt has all of these\nindividual little nooks and\n\n1579\n01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.820\ncrannies that are full of flavor,\nand are very, very cool,\n\n1580\n01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.784\nbut we have to know about them\nin order to truly enjoy them.\n\n1581\n01:17:05.784 --> 01:17:08.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, we're gonna choose distributes\n\n1582\n01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.020\ncontent, we are going to come in,\njust gonna click next faster for\n\n1583\n01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.600\nour screen, you've seen me do this\nalready, we're gonna choose to add in our\n\n1584\n01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.380\ndistribution point, we're gonna see that\nthat's there, I'm gonna check that off,\n\n1585\n01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:24.160\nclick okay, I'm gonna go ahead and click\nnext, we have our little summary screen,\n\n1586\n01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.950\nclick next there, get that working.\n\n1587\n01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:29.840\nPretty quick cuz we're using\npretty small packages so\n\n1588\n01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.010\nthey're not gonna be very big and\nwe're gonna get that going out there.\n\n1589\n01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:39.560\nAnd if we take a look, and\nwe zoom in right now we can actually see\n\n1590\n01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.160\nthat it's in progress so we do see\nthat happening in real time, right?\n\n1591\n01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.230\nSo we could see because that's showing\nus that's it's actually targeting\n\n1592\n01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:49.080\nthe distribution point, and\ndoing the distribution.\n\n1593\n01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.970\nAnd then if we wait, probably about a\nminute or so, shouldn't take too long, and\n\n1594\n01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:59.070\nwe go in and we do a little refresh,\nwe're gonna see that\n\n1595\n01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:04.600\nchange to success once that actually\ngoes through and is actually done right?\n\n1596\n01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.480\nAnd that'll change to green and then we'll\nbe able to actually see success there.\n\n1597\n01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.040\nSo, we'll come back and\ntake a look at that,\n\n1598\n01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.490\nwe'll do a quick refresher\nto see if it does change.\n\n1599\n01:18:11.490 --> 01:18:13.670\nYeah, here we go, we all ready got it to.\n\n1600\n01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:17.400\nUsually it doesn't take very long, and\nyou can see there that we now have that\n\n1601\n01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:22.040\nsuccessful which means we've actually\ntargeted, successfully distributed and\n\n1602\n01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:26.210\nnow, have that package sitting\non the distribution point.\n\n1603\n01:18:26.210 --> 01:18:26.780\n>> Fantastic.\n\n1604\n01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.740\n>> Kinda cool, right?\n\n1605\n01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.450\n>> Very good.\n>> All right.\n\n1606\n01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:33.050\nSo, we have all that so, so we distributed\nthe MSI package, we've gone ahead\n\n1607\n01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:35.780\ndeployed it or showed you how we would\ndo the deployment, and I'm not gonna do\n\n1608\n01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:38.430\nthe deployment again, so we've already\ndone at once that's no big deal.\n\n1609\n01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:42.580\nBut, I did say that I wanted to show you\nhow to do a simulated deployment right?\n\n1610\n01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:45.090\nSo we do want to take a look\nat that really quickly,\n\n1611\n01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:49.190\njust to make sure we understand what\nwe can do there with the, you know,\n\n1612\n01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:53.960\nthe what if scenario, and we also\ntalked about being able to go ahead and\n\n1613\n01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.650\ncreate a distribution point group.\n\n1614\n01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:58.670\nSo we did want to just quickly take\na look at that option as well.\n\n1615\n01:18:58.670 --> 01:19:01.520\nLet's go in and let's create\na distribution point group first, and\n\n1616\n01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.380\nthen we'll come back and\n\n1617\n01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:07.470\nwe'll do the assimulated deployment\njust to quickly break up the feature and\n\n1618\n01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:10.890\nthe theme here a little bit and\nshift to a different area of the console.\n\n1619\n01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:13.410\nSo I'm gonna zoom back in just\nto show you where we are.\n\n1620\n01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:15.190\nWe're in the admin workspace, and\n\n1621\n01:19:15.190 --> 01:19:19.020\nyou'll see in the admin workspace\nthat we are now over here.\n\n1622\n01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.160\nAnd we are going to come down\nto distribution point groups.\n\n1623\n01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.320\nSo I'm gonna highlight them.\n\n1624\n01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.250\nI'm actually sitting on the servers and\nsite system rolls right now, but\n\n1625\n01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:29.440\nright below it, we have distribution\npoints and distribution point groups.\n\n1626\n01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.850\nWe're gonna go select distribution point\ngroups and we're gonna work with that.\n\n1627\n01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:34.220\nSo we're gonna go\ndistribution point group,\n\n1628\n01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:37.870\nand we'll see that there is no\ndistribution point group there right now.\n\n1629\n01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:39.650\nThat's okay, we're gonna create one.\n\n1630\n01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:40.820\nWe're gonna right click, create group.\n\n1631\n01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:44.241\nWe're gonna come in we're\ngonna give it a name.\n\n1632\n01:19:44.241 --> 01:19:48.961\nAnd then call it peanuts.\n\n1633\n01:19:48.961 --> 01:19:50.462\nKeeping with our theme here.\n\n1634\n01:19:50.462 --> 01:19:51.129\n>> I like it.\n\n1635\n01:19:51.129 --> 01:19:53.129\n>> If you are allergic to peanuts\nfeel free to call it something else.\n\n1636\n01:19:53.129 --> 01:19:55.086\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n1637\n01:19:55.086 --> 01:19:57.774\n[COUGH] And then you'll see down here,\nunder members,\n\n1638\n01:19:57.774 --> 01:20:00.530\nwe can click add,\nwe're gonna do that in just a second.\n\n1639\n01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:02.310\nAnd we're gonna add in one or\n\n1640\n01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:06.940\nmore distribution points that will become\npart of the Peanuts Distribution group.\n\n1641\n01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.490\nIt's really just that simple.\n\n1642\n01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:12.260\nNow we only have one distribution point so\nnot a lot of mystery here, right?\n\n1643\n01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.730\nBut if we had more than one,\n\n1644\n01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:16.960\nwe would have a list obviously, we'd check\noff the ones that we wanna add in there,\n\n1645\n01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.970\nwe'll click OK, add that one in,\nthat's gonna be available.\n\n1646\n01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:24.010\nWe're gonna click OK there, and\nthen as soon as that is done,\n\n1647\n01:20:24.010 --> 01:20:28.400\nwe'll have our distribution point\ngroup created, we can see it there.\n\n1648\n01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:33.975\nAnd then a a result of that,\nwe now have the ability to be able to,\n\n1649\n01:20:33.975 --> 01:20:38.905\nas you can see, look at the packages\nsoftware, whatever it may be and\n\n1650\n01:20:38.905 --> 01:20:43.747\nif we choose to do a distribution, we can\ndo it individual distribution point group.\n\n1651\n01:20:43.747 --> 01:20:46.767\nAre the individual distribution\npoint rather or the group.\n\n1652\n01:20:46.767 --> 01:20:48.387\nIn our case it's effectively\nthe same things.\n\n1653\n01:20:48.387 --> 01:20:49.765\nCuz it's only one system, but\n\n1654\n01:20:49.765 --> 01:20:53.104\nin a large scale system in production\nwith multiple distribution points,\n\n1655\n01:20:53.104 --> 01:20:56.673\nsaves us the time and trouble having\nto check off five or 10 or 20.\n\n1656\n01:20:56.673 --> 01:20:59.043\nOn an individual pick list,\nwe hit the group and\n\n1657\n01:20:59.043 --> 01:21:00.893\nit distributes to everything all at once.\n\n1658\n01:21:00.893 --> 01:21:04.513\nSo, it's a time saving device for us when\nwe have large amounts of infrastructure,\n\n1659\n01:21:04.513 --> 01:21:05.563\nso we're gonna do that.\n\n1660\n01:21:05.563 --> 01:21:08.393\nLet's go back and take a look at that\nwhat if or what we call the simulated\n\n1661\n01:21:08.393 --> 01:21:11.613\ndeployment, and then we'll be able\nto wrap up our conversation here.\n\n1662\n01:21:11.613 --> 01:21:14.808\nAll right, so, let's go to Software\nLibrary, go back to where we were,\n\n1663\n01:21:14.808 --> 01:21:17.140\ncome back over here.\n\n1664\n01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:18.730\nLet's go over to our application.\n\n1665\n01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:21.300\nSo we'll just click back there\nto get to our application.\n\n1666\n01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:25.360\nAnd what we're going to do is,\nwith our application, highlight it.\n\n1667\n01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.800\nI'll just come up and\nselect it so you can see it.\n\n1668\n01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.190\nWe have our Simulate Deployment\nitem there,\n\n1669\n01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:32.730\nunder the Deployment area of the ribbon.\n\n1670\n01:21:32.730 --> 01:21:35.120\nWe can right click by the way,\nhit Simulate Deployment.\n\n1671\n01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.180\nIt's an option there.\n\n1672\n01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:38.080\nIt's just a matter of knowing where to go.\n\n1673\n01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.320\nOr we could do that right from here.\n\n1674\n01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.370\nSo we'll just simulate deployment.\n\n1675\n01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:45.410\nWhen we do simulate deployment what we're\ngonna do is get ourselves a little wizard\n\n1676\n01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:49.330\nhere that's gonna come up called the\nSimulate Application Deployment Wizard.\n\n1677\n01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:52.200\nWe're gonna have our first screen\nthat lists the application.\n\n1678\n01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.550\nWe have to specify\nthe collection we wanna target.\n\n1679\n01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:56.650\nJust remember, this is gonna be a what if.\n\n1680\n01:21:56.650 --> 01:21:59.200\nWhat if we did it, and\nwhat if we did it to here.\n\n1681\n01:21:59.200 --> 01:21:59.870\nWhat would happen?\n\n1682\n01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:00.800\nWhat would be the outcome?\n\n1683\n01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.770\nSo we can target collections and\nsee what will occur.\n\n1684\n01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:06.890\nBut we're not actually gonna do\nthe deployment, this is just a simulation.\n\n1685\n01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:08.220\nRight?\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n1686\n01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:08.770\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n1687\n01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:10.060\nSo we'll browse for our collection.\n\n1688\n01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:15.320\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe will choose our device collection, and\n\n1689\n01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:20.194\nwe'll choose our all systems\ncollection where we have some members.\n\n1690\n01:22:20.194 --> 01:22:26.230\nWe'll click okay, we have to choose our\naction, install or uninstall we know\n\n1691\n01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:28.950\nthat obviously we wanna choose install\ncuz we haven't done an install yet.\n\n1692\n01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:30.052\nSo, I just wanna check that.\n\n1693\n01:22:30.052 --> 01:22:35.160\nAll right, now notice here and this is\nsomething you need to know about in\n\n1694\n01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:40.170\nthe real world, that when we do this,\nwe already have a deployment there,\n\n1695\n01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:42.890\nremember I did the deployment live, right?\n\n1696\n01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:45.845\nYou cannot simulate a deployment\nthat's already taken place.\n\n1697\n01:22:45.845 --> 01:22:48.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's already taken place.\n\n1698\n01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:50.590\nI get this question a lot in class.\n\n1699\n01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:52.090\nHey, can I do a what if?\n\n1700\n01:22:52.090 --> 01:22:53.650\nAbsolutely, as long as\nyou've already done it,\n\n1701\n01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:56.160\nbut if you've already done it,\nwhy would you do a what if?\n\n1702\n01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.880\nYou already know what happens.\n\n1703\n01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.460\nSo as a result of that,\n\n1704\n01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:03.500\nyou can only do simulated deployments\nprior to actually doing the deployment,\n\n1705\n01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.995\nbecause we're effectively targeting\nthe thing that's already been done.\n\n1706\n01:23:05.995 --> 01:23:06.545\n>> Makes sense.\n>> But\n\n1707\n01:23:06.545 --> 01:23:09.255\nwhat would happen here is\nthis would simply go through.\n\n1708\n01:23:09.255 --> 01:23:11.425\nYou can see the summary\nprogress completion.\n\n1709\n01:23:11.425 --> 01:23:14.955\nIf there were any problems it would print\nout and tell us what would be the outcome.\n\n1710\n01:23:14.955 --> 01:23:18.165\nAnd then we'd be able to take\nthe appropriate steps as a result of that.\n\n1711\n01:23:18.165 --> 01:23:20.225\nSo, just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n1712\n01:23:20.225 --> 01:23:22.635\nNo big deal,\nyou could easily do it if you go back and\n\n1713\n01:23:22.635 --> 01:23:24.255\ncreate a brand new application.\n\n1714\n01:23:24.255 --> 01:23:26.155\nYou could do another one,\nyou'd easily be able to see it.\n\n1715\n01:23:26.155 --> 01:23:29.355\nIf you wanna simulate that in your\nenvironments just see what it would look\n\n1716\n01:23:29.355 --> 01:23:30.792\nlike, feel free to try that.\n\n1717\n01:23:30.792 --> 01:23:32.420\nThere's really going to be\nno downside to that at all,\n\n1718\n01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:35.420\nbecause remember we're not\nactually doing any deployment,\n\n1719\n01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:39.290\nwe're just simply checking the status,\nor checking the waters, if you will.\n\n1720\n01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:42.370\nTo see what would happen,\nin theory, if we chose to.\n\n1721\n01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:42.870\n>> Very good.\n\n1722\n01:23:44.395 --> 01:23:47.996\n>> All right, yeah, we're going to go\nahead and what we wanna do is remember,\n\n1723\n01:23:47.996 --> 01:23:51.149\nwe just have the quick little\nsummaries on your machine that we want\n\n1724\n01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:54.545\nto take a look at for monitoring\nthe status of a distribution point.\n\n1725\n01:23:54.545 --> 01:23:56.090\nI actually already showed us all that but\n\n1726\n01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:58.495\nwe just have a couple of items\nthat we wanted to talk about.\n\n1727\n01:23:58.495 --> 01:24:02.622\nWe can go to Mike's machine real quick\njust on the Word document list that we\n\n1728\n01:24:02.622 --> 01:24:03.740\nhave there.\n\n1729\n01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:07.760\nThe methods to monitor distribution point\nstatus include we obviously took a look at\n\n1730\n01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.150\nthe fact that we could see the package and\nsee the status going out there.\n\n1731\n01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:13.520\nBut there are a couple of\nlog files that are there.\n\n1732\n01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.066\nThe Distmgr.log and\n\n1733\n01:24:15.066 --> 01:24:20.010\nthe Smsdpprov.log which is gonna be\nthe distribution point provider.\n\n1734\n01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:22.460\nSo we can check those logs and\nsee what's going on with those.\n\n1735\n01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:25.820\nThat will help us to understand what may\nor may not be happening in real time.\n\n1736\n01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:28.670\nSo we always wanna be aware of\nthose things just to make sure\n\n1737\n01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:31.420\nwe're focusing on ways in which\nwe can doubt it was happening.\n\n1738\n01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:34.610\nI believe we also have\nthe content management tasks and\n\n1739\n01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:35.760\nwhat is involved there.\n\n1740\n01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.440\nWe went through and\n\n1741\n01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.000\ntalked about distributing content\nto the distribution points.\n\n1742\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.410\nUpdating content, we talked about that.\n\n1743\n01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:42.420\nWe talked about the difference there.\n\n1744\n01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:45.750\nRedistributing, validating, removing,\nwe talked about how to do those things.\n\n1745\n01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:50.320\nManaging content and pre staging content,\nas you saw we did distribution\n\n1746\n01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.300\nverses deployment to pre stage so\nyou saw how to do all that as well.\n\n1747\n01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:58.865\nWe also want to make we know\nthat monitoring distribution,\n\n1748\n01:24:58.865 --> 01:25:01.455\nas we have talked about,\nit can be done through PowerShell.\n\n1749\n01:25:01.455 --> 01:25:03.455\nWe can take a look at content status.\n\n1750\n01:25:03.455 --> 01:25:07.015\nI showed you that we could see the status\nmodel in real time for the package or\n\n1751\n01:25:07.015 --> 01:25:10.355\nthe application down below on\nthe tabs on the interface.\n\n1752\n01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:12.230\nSo we could see it there as well.\n\n1753\n01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:13.710\nWe didn't take a look at reports but\n\n1754\n01:25:13.710 --> 01:25:17.530\nwe do know that we have reports that are\ncrossing a variety of different areas, and\n\n1755\n01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.410\nwe do have reports that will\nbe available there as well.\n\n1756\n01:25:19.410 --> 01:25:22.540\nSo we actually can use those\nas additional mechanisms, and\n\n1757\n01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:25.500\nas we mentioned, PowerShell cmdlets\nare also gonna be very valuable for us.\n\n1758\n01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.680\nSo just wanna be thinking about\nthat stuff, and keeping in mind\n\n1759\n01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.270\nhow we can monitor status and do those\nthings is gonna be very important so\n\n1760\n01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:35.400\nwe can not only troubleshoot, but we can\nmake sure we're on the right path and\n\n1761\n01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.750\ndoing the right things as we continue on.\n\n1762\n01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:40.060\nWe also talked about creating\nconfiguring deployment.\n\n1763\n01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:40.945\nYou saw how do this.\n\n1764\n01:25:40.945 --> 01:25:43.828\nMaking sure we understood that we\ndon't have to specify the program and\n\n1765\n01:25:43.828 --> 01:25:44.845\nthe target collection.\n\n1766\n01:25:44.845 --> 01:25:49.200\nSo we spent some time on talking about\nthat, verifying the content destination.\n\n1767\n01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.020\nDefining the deployment settings,\nthe action and the purpose.\n\n1768\n01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:52.780\nIs it required?\n\n1769\n01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:53.820\nIs it optional?\n\n1770\n01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.160\nWhat's happening with that?\n\n1771\n01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:59.520\nWe took a look at the schedule option, the\nuser experience option, we talked through\n\n1772\n01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.850\nmost of those things, and then we\nspecified how the program would run.\n\n1773\n01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:05.570\nYou know, is it going to be running\nwhether you're logged in or not?\n\n1774\n01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:08.060\nLog on, or\nrather run while we're logged on.\n\n1775\n01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.120\nRun only if we're logged on or logged off.\n\n1776\n01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.640\nWhat rights do we need?\n\n1777\n01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.530\nThat kinda thing.\n\n1778\n01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:14.250\nWe went through and talked about all that.\n\n1779\n01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:16.990\nSo we see all that, and we obviously\nhave the hit list there for you for\n\n1780\n01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.830\nthat as well.\n\n1781\n01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:20.400\nCuz again we just want to summarize\nall the things that we did.\n\n1782\n01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.770\nSo that way we have a good understanding\nof all the activities that we've\n\n1783\n01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:24.870\nengaged in here.\n\n1784\n01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:28.160\nSo that way when you go back,\nyou review, you study, you summarize.\n\n1785\n01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.040\nYou have a good little set of hit\nlist of things that will help to just\n\n1786\n01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.440\nkeep all this straight in your mind.\n\n1787\n01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.640\nBecause we spent probably\nthe better part of an hour,\n\n1788\n01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.450\nif not a bit longer than that,\ngoing through how all this stuff works.\n\n1789\n01:26:37.450 --> 01:26:40.150\nAnd we want to make sure you're\ncomfortable with all the various steps.\n\n1790\n01:26:40.150 --> 01:26:40.940\n>> Very good.\n\n1791\n01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.678\nAll right Adam.\nAgain, another excellent episode.\n\n1792\n01:26:42.678 --> 01:26:46.475\nGreat hands on demonstrations of how we\nmanage software from beginning to end.\n\n1793\n01:26:46.475 --> 01:26:48.440\nSetting up our distribution point,\n\n1794\n01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.800\nthat roll service that we have\nto add to our site servers.\n\n1795\n01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.100\nGetting that software or\nour programs created.\n\n1796\n01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.355\nCreating packages out of those, sending\nthose out to the distribution points and\n\n1797\n01:26:58.355 --> 01:27:02.150\nthen eventually deploying them\nout to collections, so fantastic.\n\n1798\n01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:02.840\nYou like that Adam.\n\n1799\n01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.910\nI hope everybody out there enjoyed\nwatching, and remember if you want to sit\n\n1800\n01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:09.990\nin one of Adam's classes live choose\nthe email here at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n1801\n01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:12.654\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n1802\n01:27:12.654 --> 01:27:14.511\n>> I'm tired.\n\n1803\n01:27:14.511 --> 01:27:16.275\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n1804\n01:27:16.275 --> 01:27:22.580\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:17.591\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:20.810\nToday we're doing our SCCM 2012R2 content.\n\n6\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.460\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be taking\na look at the application catalog, and\n\n7\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.670\nhere to help us with that is our\nSCCM 2012R2 guru, Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.760\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.072\n>> Wow, that's a mouthful.\n\n10\n00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:35.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is going well considering I've\n\n11\n00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.950\nbeen promoted to lead guru for\nSCCM 2012R2.\n\n12\n00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.540\nNot just 2012 but 2012R2.\n\n13\n00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.120\nIt is going well.\n\n14\n00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.210\nHopefully it is going well for\nyou out there.\n\n15\n00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.930\nWe are going to do two things that\nare hopefully of interest to you in\n\n16\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.000\nthis episode.\n\n17\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.900\nOne, we are gonna do a little review.\n\n18\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.520\nYou know I often find especially when I'm\nteaching this content that after we finish\n\n19\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.980\nup the sprint we just ran through with\nregards to application deployment and\n\n20\n00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.020\nmanagement of packages and applications\nand setting it all up, creating\n\n21\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.090\nthe distribution points, all that,\nit's good to pause, catch our breath.\n\n22\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.800\nYou've obviously been able to do that if\nyou have gone through that episode, but\n\n23\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.690\nit's good to look back, review a little\nbit, get a sense of what we just did,\n\n24\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.000\nmake sure we're comfortable with\nthat before we carry out and\n\n25\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.550\nadd some new material to the mix.\n\n26\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.160\nSo we've prepared a little review for you.\n\n27\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.840\nI'm gonna ask Mike to help me out.\n\n28\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.340\nI know he's going to here in a minute.\n\n29\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.240\nWe're gonna put up some stuff\nthat we've summarized for\n\n30\n00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.960\nyou, just by way of quickly\nrunning through the things we did.\n\n31\n00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.075\nWhen we're done with that,\nno show and tell for that piece.\n\n32\n00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:34.210\nIf you need to see me do that again in\ndepth, you go back and watch that episode.\n\n33\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.570\nWatch that, pause it, review it as needed.\n\n34\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.996\nThis is really just a high level\ndiscussion with some bullet points on some\n\n35\n00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:42.385\nlists for\nyou to capture the essence of what we did.\n\n36\n00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:46.485\nAnd then going forward, the show and tell\non this particular piece is gonna be about\n\n37\n00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:50.763\nsetting up configuring, installing and\nconfiguring, the application catalog site\n\n38\n00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:54.940\nservice role, so if you have not seen that\nbefore, we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n39\n00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.779\nAnd then once we finish with all that,\nwe're gonna throw a little application\n\n40\n00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:02.791\nvirtualization in there on the top just to\ngive us a little essence of what's going\n\n41\n00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:06.979\non with that, so that way we have a sense\nof application virtualization technology,\n\n42\n00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.121\nwhat's commonly referred to as\nApp-V in Microsoft's world,\n\n43\n00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:12.980\nand how we can integrate that\nif we choose to within SSCM.\n\n44\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.390\nSo we'll be doing all that in this\nepisode, and if we have time,\n\n45\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.020\nI'll share with you my recipe for\ncranberry scones, it's awesome by the way.\n\n46\n00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.150\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nshow those review lists if we can.\n\n47\n00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.110\nThen we'll have to go wide and\ngo full screen and\n\n48\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.330\nget me out of there because we\nare blocking part of the content.\n\n49\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.370\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n50\n00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.260\nBesides nobody wants to see me anyway.\n\n51\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.860\nThey really just want to\nhear a disembodied voice and\n\n52\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.430\nthey want to be able to look at the stuff\nthey need to know so they can prepare for\n\n53\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.120\nthe exam and be successful.\n\n54\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.270\nNobody wants to watch me, that's boring.\n\n55\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.330\n>> Not true.\n\n56\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.940\n>> No ,very true, very true.\n\n57\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.040\nAll right, so let's first talk about\napplication management features.\n\n58\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.920\nThe things, right, that we could\ndo with application management,\n\n59\n00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.210\nkind of the categories, if you will,\nin the areas that we focused on.\n\n60\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.130\nWe have requirements.\n\n61\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.480\nYou saw me set these and talk about these.\n\n62\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.250\nAre we going to be able to\nevaluate these requirements and\n\n63\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.640\nlook at them on a schedule to\nmake sure that we know whether or\n\n64\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.160\nnot the deployment type is\napplicable to a targeted client?\n\n65\n00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.150\nWe talked about the fact\nthat the answer is yes.\n\n66\n00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.900\nSo we wanna make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n67\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.120\nWe build these by adding operators and\nvalues to the global conditions.\n\n68\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.040\nYou saw me do this, right, where in, for\ninstance, and said, hey, by the way,\n\n69\n00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.590\nwe wanna deploy this particular software\nto a system that only has a gigabyte or\n\n70\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.910\nmore of memory under this\nparticular conditions, right?\n\n71\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.980\nSo global conditions,\ndefined conditions that are examined,\n\n72\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.780\nthey're used to create requirements,\nand then deployment actions and\n\n73\n00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.420\npurposes define what we want to do,\ninstall or uninstall.\n\n74\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.270\nIn this case, we talked about both.\n\n75\n00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.140\nDefine how you want to do it,\noptional or mandatory.\n\n76\n00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.570\nWe talked about that as well.\n\n77\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.540\nWe talked about user device affinity, the\nidea of allowing the association of a user\n\n78\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.478\nwith a specific device or multiple\ndevices as their primary device and\n\n79\n00:03:52.478 --> 00:03:56.320\nthen the other devices, because we saw\nthat we could actually specify and\n\n80\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.790\nconstrain a deployment just to, if it's\nrequired, to the devices that the user\n\n81\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.690\nspecifies as their, or the device rather,\nthat they specify as their primary device.\n\n82\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.760\nWe can do that, whether or\nnot the user is actually\n\n83\n00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.950\non that device cuz we know we can\nactually wake it up if we need to, and\n\n84\n00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.360\nwe can go ahead and preload it for them so\nit's there the next time they log in.\n\n85\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.650\n>> Very nice.\n>> So it can do all that,\n\n86\n00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.510\nthose are some of the features\navailable in application management.\n\n87\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.100\nWe also put together a little chart for\nyou that compares applications and\n\n88\n00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.680\npackages, yeah probably wanna just\nmake sure that's the revision,\n\n89\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.270\nyes that's the bottom of that one,\nyeah that's good.\n\n90\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.580\nAll right and then the features that\nare there, so basic software information,\n\n91\n00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.455\nmultiple deployment options,\ndeployed by, the deployment option use.\n\n92\n00:04:38.455 --> 00:04:42.035\nWe just compared them across\napplications and packages.\n\n93\n00:04:42.035 --> 00:04:45.335\nSo you can see the differences,\nsubtle or in some cases,\n\n94\n00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:46.795\nglaring, though they may be.\n\n95\n00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:48.295\nYou want to make sure\nwe're aware of these.\n\n96\n00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:50.565\nIf you're preparing for the exam,\nit would be valuable for\n\n97\n00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:52.315\nyou to take a look at a chart like this,\n\n98\n00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:56.415\nhave a sense of the difference\nbetween applications and packages.\n\n99\n00:04:56.415 --> 00:04:59.039\nSo we'll obviously just let\nthat sink in for a moment.\n\n100\n00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.910\nLet you absorb all the wonderful goodness\nthat Mike has thrown up on the screen\n\n101\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.950\nthere for you.\n\n102\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.690\nOne of the things that\nI will point out and\n\n103\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.540\nwanna be thinking about is that when we\nlook at multiple deployment options, so\n\n104\n00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.250\none, two, three, fourth one down from\nthe top happens also to be fourth one up\n\n105\n00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.130\nfrom the bottom and works out, well it's\nin the middle, I guess you could say.\n\n106\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.880\nMultiple deployment\noptions under application,\n\n107\n00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.640\nsingle application can contain multiple\ndeployment types, whereas packages,\n\n108\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.430\na package can contain multiple programs.\n\n109\n00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.000\nSo we can effectively contain\nmultiples in either areas.\n\n110\n00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.100\nIt's just a question of\nwhat the multiple is.\n\n111\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.500\nA package has multiple programs, an\napplication has multiple deployment types.\n\n112\n00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.350\nSubtle, but important difference,\nespecially if you are questioning and\n\n113\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.030\nanswering, and looking to do so\nappropriately and consistently correctly,\n\n114\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.400\nso be aware of that.\n\n115\n00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.680\nSo we also wanna make sure we know about,\nand just go back for\n\n116\n00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.020\none more minute if you could down at\nthe bottom, very, very important.\n\n117\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.200\nFocus in for me, zoom in.\n\n118\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.926\nWhat's the word I'm looking for\non that's so\n\n119\n00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:02.060\nwe can see revision history\njust a little bit more there.\n\n120\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.519\nRight, and so just to understand\nspecifically with Revision History that in\n\n121\n00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:10.635\napplications, which is what that\nfirst column is in the middle there,\n\n122\n00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:13.191\nfirst column in the middle\nthat was stupid.\n\n123\n00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:14.212\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The middle\n\n124\n00:06:14.212 --> 00:06:16.931\ncolumn there is what I meant to say so,\nlate in the day,\n\n125\n00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:21.560\nI haven't no had coffee in the last 30\nminutes, so I'm waning here quickly.\n\n126\n00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.860\nSo, when we talk about revision history,\nthe applications do maintain,\n\n127\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.860\nas you can see, they do maintain\na revision history, but packages,\n\n128\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.242\noff to the right, does not maintain,\nor do not maintain a vision history.\n\n129\n00:06:34.242 --> 00:06:37.960\nSo just be aware of that, and make sure\nyou are, again, picking up on those subtle\n\n130\n00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.980\nbut important differences in a chart\nlike this as we look at the comparison.\n\n131\n00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.990\nOh, yeah, let's go down to the next one.\n\n132\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.880\nI know you were already kind of getting\nthere before I pulled you up short.\n\n133\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.110\nSo the server role requirements that\napplication management needs and\n\n134\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.140\nhas, we'll put those into a chart for\nyou by server role.\n\n135\n00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.040\nWe got the Management point,\n\n136\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.295\nthe Distribution point,\nApplication Catalog website point,\n\n137\n00:06:58.295 --> 00:07:01.285\nApplication Catalog web service point\n,we're gonna be setting those up.\n\n138\n00:07:01.285 --> 00:07:02.695\nYou'll notice their listed is optional.\n\n139\n00:07:02.695 --> 00:07:05.049\nWe're going to show you how to\nset those up in the show and\n\n140\n00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:08.095\ntell portion of our discussion here\nin a few minutes, that's the focus\n\n141\n00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:12.285\nour hands on exercises in this episode,\nand then reporting services point,\n\n142\n00:07:12.285 --> 00:07:15.855\nwhich you saw me configure and\nwe set up in a prior episode.\n\n143\n00:07:15.855 --> 00:07:19.195\nSo all of these are either required or\noptional in some combination.\n\n144\n00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.010\nPotentially a total of five.\n\n145\n00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.790\nThe two that are mandatory,\nboth management point and\n\n146\n00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.220\ndistribution point, we've taken a look\nat and talked about in great detail.\n\n147\n00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.490\nWe spent a lot of time in the last\nepisode as we did the live run through,\n\n148\n00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.500\nwith the distribution point in particular.\n\n149\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.895\nWe talked about how to set it up,\n\n150\n00:07:35.895 --> 00:07:39.157\nI showed you what all the configuration\nparameters would be in the wizard,\n\n151\n00:07:39.157 --> 00:07:42.296\nwe went through took a look at how to\ncreate a distribution point group.\n\n152\n00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:46.545\nWe went ahead and used the distribute\ncontent, we used the update, or\n\n153\n00:07:46.545 --> 00:07:51.514\nat least took a look at update distribute\ncontent options to see how we would manage\n\n154\n00:07:51.514 --> 00:07:55.421\ncontent distribution down to or\nout to the distribution point.\n\n155\n00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:57.940\nSo we spent a lot of time with those,\nso make sure you're familiar with that.\n\n156\n00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.991\nAnd I know we have some verbiage\ndown there On the bottom we also\n\n157\n00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:03.172\njust want to make sure\nwe call attention to.\n\n158\n00:08:03.172 --> 00:08:04.723\nWe have not done App-V yet, but\n\n159\n00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:07.635\nwe will be talking about it at\nthe end of this conversation.\n\n160\n00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:11.705\nApp-V or Application Virtualization\nis also potentially part of software\n\n161\n00:08:11.705 --> 00:08:12.791\ndeployment today.\n\n162\n00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:17.216\nThis is the idea of being able to\neffectively deploy software like we showed\n\n163\n00:08:17.216 --> 00:08:19.332\nyou and demoed in the last episode.\n\n164\n00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:23.571\nBut not to do it actually to the machine\nwith a heavy footprint where we install it\n\n165\n00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:27.115\nand it shows up as an application\nthat actually is going to maintain\n\n166\n00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:27.958\nitself there.\n\n167\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.778\nBut rather deploying the memory in\neffect in a memory bubble and then once\n\n168\n00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:36.650\nthe application virtualization client is\nrunning so we do actually deploy software.\n\n169\n00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.540\nWe deploy the App-V client.\n\n170\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.490\nThat stays on the system.\n\n171\n00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.410\nBut the App-V client\ncreates a memory space.\n\n172\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.260\nEffectively a virtual memory environment.\n\n173\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.020\nAnd we deploy the applications into that,\nzero footprint or\n\n174\n00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.058\nzero touches what we\nwould refer to with us.\n\n175\n00:08:52.058 --> 00:08:57.230\nSo, the App-V client gets installed, it\nopens up a effective virtual memory space,\n\n176\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:01.110\nwe deploy Office or whatever we wanna\ndeploy into the virtual memory bubble.\n\n177\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.580\nThe application runs inside\nthe memory bubble, when we're done,\n\n178\n00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.980\nthe memory bubble is\neffectively collapsed,\n\n179\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.030\nthe application goes away,\nnever actually sits on the system.\n\n180\n00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.332\nAnd gets installed directly but\nrather runs in memory and then is removed.\n\n181\n00:09:14.332 --> 00:09:19.263\nSo it's a zero touch and zero footprint\nsolution which is actually kinda cool.\n\n182\n00:09:19.263 --> 00:09:23.624\nSo what we're talking about there\nis the fact that the client system\n\n183\n00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:28.217\nrequirements for app management\nincludes installing either App-V,\n\n184\n00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:33.749\nthe older version of the the App-V client\nis App-V 4.6.x whatever that is SP1.\n\n185\n00:09:33.749 --> 00:09:37.166\nOr the newer one is currently App-V 5.x,\nI think it's 5.1 right now.\n\n186\n00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:38.873\nIt's the most recent version.\n\n187\n00:09:38.873 --> 00:09:40.697\nBut it just a depends on\nwhat you're doing and\n\n188\n00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:43.180\nhow you're setting up\napplication virtualization.\n\n189\n00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.708\nThe trick there as we've talked about in\nseveral other places is to go out and\n\n190\n00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:48.042\nlook at the vendor website.\n\n191\n00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:51.248\nMake sure we have the most recent\ninformation on what App-V is, and\n\n192\n00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:53.000\nkinda how its setup and how it works.\n\n193\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.749\nAnd since we're talking about it,\nwe might as well quickly go out.\n\n194\n00:09:55.749 --> 00:09:58.295\nLet's just throw up the website\nthat I know I asked you to go out,\n\n195\n00:09:58.295 --> 00:10:00.860\nthat's the one I think we looked up for\nthe other thing, right?\n\n196\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.586\n>> Mm-hm\n>> We need the one on,\n\n197\n00:10:02.586 --> 00:10:06.457\nnot how to deploy application that, but\nthat one right there about App-V 5.1.\n\n198\n00:10:06.457 --> 00:10:08.958\nSince we're already talking about it,\nwe'll just throw out the website for\n\n199\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:09.582\nyou real quickly.\n\n200\n00:10:09.582 --> 00:10:12.523\nThis is gonna be the website,\nyou should go out to read up on\n\n201\n00:10:12.523 --> 00:10:16.380\nApp V to understand more about it,\nto understand the client specifically.\n\n202\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.730\nHave a better sense of\nhow this is gonna work.\n\n203\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.940\nSo Mike will provide that link for\nyou as well.\n\n204\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.342\nBut it gives you the software prereqs,\nsupported configurations for installation,\n\n205\n00:10:26.342 --> 00:10:30.802\nhow to migrate if you're already using an\nearlier version to the App-V 5.1 platform\n\n206\n00:10:30.802 --> 00:10:32.691\nor whatever the current version is.\n\n207\n00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:36.021\nAnd it gives you a little overview\nwhat's new, how to set it up,\n\n208\n00:10:36.021 --> 00:10:40.032\nwe do have App-V support for Windows 10,\nthat's previewing now so you can\n\n209\n00:10:40.032 --> 00:10:44.590\nobviously use that as well in 5.1, which\nis nice, because we do support in 5.1.\n\n210\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.160\nWe don't support in 5.0, so if you are\ngonna need to be playing with Windows 10,\n\n211\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.608\nthen wanna make sure we have\nthe most recent App-V client.\n\n212\n00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:54.030\nSo you'll wanna take a look at that, it's\nobviously gonna be beneficial there for\n\n213\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.090\nyou and Mike will make sure we get\nthat URL posted up as well, I believe.\n\n214\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.460\nSo if we can go back to that,\nif I we actually wanna go to the slide,\n\n215\n00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.155\nI believe, right?\n\n216\n00:11:03.155 --> 00:11:04.030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n217\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.310\n>> And just make sure we can see that,\nor the graphic rather, not the slide but\n\n218\n00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.130\nthe slate or the board, or\nthe thing with the pretty pictures on it.\n\n219\n00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.280\nWhatever that is.\nWhatever we're calling this today.\n\n220\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.030\nBut what we wanna take a look at is,\nwhat is the Application Catalog?\n\n221\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.749\nI think it's gonna be that one?\n\n222\n00:11:16.749 --> 00:11:17.708\nYeah, that's the one.\n\n223\n00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:20.738\nSo I wanna just talk about what\nthe application catalog is, and\n\n224\n00:11:20.738 --> 00:11:24.418\ngive you a general sense of this,\nthe idea behind it and what it's used for.\n\n225\n00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:28.735\nYou have the general concept of the\nApplication Catalog is the idea of being\n\n226\n00:11:28.735 --> 00:11:31.889\nable to effectively allow\nweb based clients, right,\n\n227\n00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:35.332\neither Intranet based clients or\nInternet based clients.\n\n228\n00:11:35.332 --> 00:11:38.669\nSo clients on the outside or\non the inside, either way,\n\n229\n00:11:38.669 --> 00:11:43.142\nto be able to effectively go to a website\nand self service through selecting\n\n230\n00:11:43.142 --> 00:11:47.473\napplications that are effectively\npublished there, pull them down and\n\n231\n00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:50.450\neffectively invoke them for installation.\n\n232\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.895\nThis is self service software, right?\n\n233\n00:11:52.895 --> 00:11:54.124\nIs the idea behind it.\n\n234\n00:11:54.124 --> 00:11:59.460\nWe've reinvented the concept\ncoming out of 2007 R3 into 12,\n\n235\n00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.332\n12 SP1 now 12 SP1 post 12 SP1, 12 R2.\n\n236\n00:12:03.332 --> 00:12:07.886\nAnd we now have a complete set of websites\nand site server roles that support them,\n\n237\n00:12:07.886 --> 00:12:10.064\nthat then will allow the user to go in and\n\n238\n00:12:10.064 --> 00:12:13.694\nto select software that's been\npublished by the SCCM admin, and\n\n239\n00:12:13.694 --> 00:12:17.541\nthen effectively invoke it, and\npull it down and install on demand.\n\n240\n00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:22.039\nSo, imagine, hypothetically,\nlet's just say,\n\n241\n00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:28.082\nas a business case, that you and\nI are both users in the ITProTV arena.\n\n242\n00:12:28.082 --> 00:12:32.230\nAnd we have a need to be able to\ninstall Office 2016 hypothetically,\n\n243\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.038\nlike David was saying, he was planning\non doing with his key that he\n\n244\n00:12:36.038 --> 00:12:39.167\nwas talking about earlier\nin the chat window, right?\n\n245\n00:12:39.167 --> 00:12:42.160\nCuz I assume he's gonna install that\nsoftware cuz he has a key for it.\n\n246\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.916\nOtherwise, he may of just been\nadvertising, we're not quite sure which.\n\n247\n00:12:44.916 --> 00:12:47.288\nBut we'll assume and give him the benefit\nof the doubt that he's planning on\n\n248\n00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:48.560\ninstalling the software at some point.\n\n249\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.194\nSo, let's say he's gonna do that,\n\n250\n00:12:50.194 --> 00:12:52.791\nhe's gonna most likely have\nto do that manually, right?\n\n251\n00:12:52.791 --> 00:12:56.042\nHe's gonna have to get the installation\nmedia, probably download that most likely.\n\n252\n00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:59.246\nHe's then gonna have to go through\nthe installation, set it up,\n\n253\n00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:02.406\nput his license key in and\nconfigure it locally at his machine.\n\n254\n00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:04.880\nNo big deal,\nwe've probably done that hundreds of times\n\n255\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.385\nas individuals that do\nthis on a regular basis.\n\n256\n00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:11.040\nBut what we can do, one of the things we\nnow know we can do with SCCM is we can\n\n257\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.970\npackage that application and\nthat software up and\n\n258\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.940\nwe can provide it in a configurable\nform and then push it out the door.\n\n259\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.160\nNow we can do what we've already done in\nthe prior demos or we could set it up and\n\n260\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.460\nlet users self service and\nbring it down on demand.\n\n261\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.592\nBecause everything we've talked about\nuntil know has been hey let's set that up\n\n262\n00:13:28.592 --> 00:13:32.661\neffectively, let's put it out there,\nand let's us as admins control when and\n\n263\n00:13:32.661 --> 00:13:34.680\nwhere and how and what happens with it.\n\n264\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.042\nWe, in other words will centrally\nmanage it, not the user.\n\n265\n00:13:39.042 --> 00:13:42.896\nAnd we do have an option where we can set\nup the package, put it out there, but\n\n266\n00:13:42.896 --> 00:13:45.728\nthen effectively give the user\nthe right to invoke it and\n\n267\n00:13:45.728 --> 00:13:49.540\nbring it down on their timeline with\ntheir needs whenever they wanna do it.\n\n268\n00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.230\nAnd, so that's what we're gonna be talking\nabout with the Application Catalog.\n\n269\n00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.970\nThis is just a reimagining of\nthe self service software solution,\n\n270\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.260\nthat we've had NSCCM for\nsome time, but it's been updated.\n\n271\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.900\nAnd actually it's a pretty cool solution.\n\n272\n00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.740\nSo, we see the graphic there,\nI love that I pointed and\n\n273\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.820\nit was almost like my\nhand was coming at me.\n\n274\n00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.374\nScared me there for second.\n\n275\n00:14:08.374 --> 00:14:09.199\nWouldn't that be cool 3D?\n\n276\n00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:10.946\n>> [LAUGHS] Right?\n>> 3D glasses and I go like that,\n\n277\n00:14:10.946 --> 00:14:13.430\nand my hand is coming out of the screen?\n\n278\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.658\nAnd I'm right-clicking on\nthe button on the user's side.\n\n279\n00:14:16.658 --> 00:14:19.400\nCuz their right-click will work\neven though mine is crap and\n\n280\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.600\ndoesn't work, right?\n\n281\n00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.452\nAll right, so what we see here is we\nsee that we have either an Intranet or\n\n282\n00:14:24.452 --> 00:14:25.890\nan Internet client.\n\n283\n00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:27.500\nAs I said, doesn't matter, either one.\n\n284\n00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.000\nPoint is we're showing you that we\ncan do this from either location but\n\n285\n00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.065\nthere is a subtle but very important\ndifference between the two there.\n\n286\n00:14:35.065 --> 00:14:36.940\nYou will see the protocol or\n\n287\n00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.310\nprotocols that are supported\ndepending on where we are.\n\n288\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:44.660\nOn the Intranet client which is the one up\nat the top, notice that we support both\n\n289\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.830\nHTTP and or\nHTTPS whereas with the Internet client,\n\n290\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.615\nthe client that is on the outside,\nwe are supporting only HTTPS.\n\n291\n00:14:54.615 --> 00:14:58.380\nThat'd be very important for\nus to recognize that.\n\n292\n00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.370\nEqually important for\n\n293\n00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:03.725\nyou if you are preparing for, let's say\neither doing this in the real world\n\n294\n00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:08.210\nand/or preparing to answer questions about\ndoing this at some point in the future.\n\n295\n00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:12.656\nThat you are aware of the fact\nthat we support only HTTPS for\n\n296\n00:15:12.656 --> 00:15:14.666\nInternet based clients.\n\n297\n00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:16.630\nHave to have that secure\ncommunication pathway.\n\n298\n00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.780\nSo then, we are connecting to\nthe Application Catalog website, right?\n\n299\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.660\nSo we see that there.\n\n300\n00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.475\nAnd then we're able to go through, and\nthose are gonna push traffic laterally,\n\n301\n00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:29.916\njust cuz of the way we drew the diagram,\nor the way Mike drew the diagram.\n\n302\n00:15:29.916 --> 00:15:33.774\nBut their just pushing the traffic out\ntowards the site server in the primary\n\n303\n00:15:33.774 --> 00:15:35.832\nsite where the site server database is.\n\n304\n00:15:35.832 --> 00:15:39.326\nAnd then we're able to gather up\ninformation, say oh, you need this piece\n\n305\n00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:42.320\nof software, it's available there,\nyou can go download it and\n\n306\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.380\nwe're gonna then be able to\nactually see how that's gonna work.\n\n307\n00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.207\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat this thought process.\n\n308\n00:15:47.207 --> 00:15:48.400\nAnd actually go in and\n\n309\n00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.921\nwe're gonna demonstrate exactly\nhow this is going to behave.\n\n310\n00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:55.019\nSo let's go ahead and let's take a look at\nthat on my machine, we'll do a little demo\n\n311\n00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:57.815\nand then we'll come back we'll just\nwrap up a couple of summary thoughts but\n\n312\n00:15:57.815 --> 00:15:59.713\na few other things that we\njust wanna remind you of.\n\n313\n00:15:59.713 --> 00:16:03.062\nThings like device affinity Making\nsure we remember how that works and\n\n314\n00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:06.310\nwhat that is, and a couple of other\nodds and ends we'll talk about.\n\n315\n00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:10.656\nSo, gonna go to my machine,\nthere's that whole 3D [SOUND].\n\n316\n00:16:10.656 --> 00:16:11.360\n>> Reach out and touch someone.\n\n317\n00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.860\n>> I need, like one of those big Mickey\nhands, like, you go to Disney World and\n\n318\n00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.390\nthey have those big mouse hands and\nit's five times the size,\n\n319\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.242\nyou do this, fill up the whole screen.\n\n320\n00:16:18.242 --> 00:16:20.980\nAll right, I'll stop messing around\ncuz we're here to be serious.\n\n321\n00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.060\nStop doing this.\n\n322\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.492\nYou're making me go off-topic here.\n\n323\n00:16:23.492 --> 00:16:25.420\n>> [LAUGH] My bad.\n>> Bad host.\n\n324\n00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.250\nAll right, so let's go ahead,\nwe're gonna zoom in.\n\n325\n00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.782\nI'm gonna zoom in, I should say.\n\n326\n00:16:28.782 --> 00:16:32.140\nWe're gonna take a look at our\ncatalog here and how to set this up.\n\n327\n00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.560\nWhere we are, and let's just do as we\nalways do, a little screen capture here.\n\n328\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.650\nZoom in,\nshow you where we're starting out from.\n\n329\n00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.870\nWe're in the administration workspace,\nI've highlighted my servers and\n\n330\n00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.430\nsite system roles.\n\n331\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.640\nI've got my site server selected up there.\n\n332\n00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.900\nWe're seeing our roles that\nare currently installed.\n\n333\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.300\nWhat we notice, conspicuously, is missing,\nis our application catalog, and so\n\n334\n00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.790\nwe're gonna go ahead and add that role in.\n\n335\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.350\nSo we're gonna get out of here, now you've\nseen me do this a couple of times already.\n\n336\n00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.700\nWe're gonna right-click\non our site server,\n\n337\n00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.470\nwe're gonna add the site system roles.\n\n338\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.760\nWe're gonna use that wizard that we have,\nso we're gonna bring that up.\n\n339\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.940\nOn the first screen,\nwe're pretty familiar with this now.\n\n340\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.670\nWe got the name of the site server,\nthe site code,\n\n341\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.060\nwe're not gonna worry too\nmuch about any of that.\n\n342\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.100\nWe're gonna click Next, we're gonna\ngo through, we don't need the proxy\n\n343\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.150\ninformation cuz we're not using proxy,\nso we'll click Next past that as well.\n\n344\n00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:23.700\nAnd then we're going to have\nthe pick list and we can see\n\n345\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.290\nwe have application catalog web service\npoint, application catalog website point.\n\n346\n00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.828\nWe're gonna install both of those and\nthen we're gonna go ahead and\n\n347\n00:17:30.828 --> 00:17:32.400\nwe're gonna take a look at what they do.\n\n348\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.530\nSo we're gonna be selecting\nthose site server roles.\n\n349\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.740\nRemember, once we select them and install\nthem, they no longer show up on the list,\n\n350\n00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.840\nso because we have our\ndistribution point installed, for\n\n351\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.490\ninstance, you'll see it's not there.\n\n352\n00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.778\nWe know it's there, it's just not on the\npick list because it's already configured.\n\n353\n00:17:47.778 --> 00:17:50.990\nSo we're gonna set this up,\nso if any of you ever go in\n\n354\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.760\nto run this wizard on a site server and\ndon't see a certain roll,\n\n355\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.940\nit's because it's already been configured,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n356\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.140\nIt's not that the roll magically\ndisappeared or was retired, it's just that\n\n357\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.090\nyou have not or did not for some reason\nsee that in the list down below.\n\n358\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.630\nSo application,\nwe're gonna select both of those.\n\n359\n00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.280\nSo let's just go ahead and do that.\n\n360\n00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.810\nWhat we're gonna do is configure,\nI'll zoom in so\n\n361\n00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.310\nyou could see it although it's\nkind of hard to see because\n\n362\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.340\nthey don't really give us\na good understanding of that.\n\n363\n00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.180\nBut off to the left you see now we\ndo you have the options to start\n\n364\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.430\nconfiguring stuff, so we're gonna be going\nin and taking a look at this as we go.\n\n365\n00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.070\nSo we're just gonna click out of that.\n\n366\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.180\nSo we're going to hit next down her,\nlet me do that real quick.\n\n367\n00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.110\nAnd what we're gonna have,\njust get over there,\n\n368\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.880\nis our specify settings for\nthe application catalog web service point.\n\n369\n00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.940\nWe have our IIS website,\nour web application name, we have HTTP and\n\n370\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.705\nor HTTPS, so\nwe can see our port numbers there.\n\n371\n00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:53.000\nAnd obviously we have to choose whether\nwe're going to communicate with HTTP or\n\n372\n00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.750\nHTTPS, so we have to keep that in mind.\n\n373\n00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.420\nSo we'll make sure that we are just\nthinking about what we would choose there.\n\n374\n00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.880\nWe're going to leave the defaults, but\n\n375\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.670\nwe can obviously modify that\nport number if we choose to.\n\n376\n00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.500\nA lot of times they randomize that port\nnumber for a more secure connection.\n\n377\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.731\nWe can do that but we have to specify\nwhat the port would be here, and\n\n378\n00:19:10.731 --> 00:19:14.367\nthen as a result of doing that, we then\nhave to know that that's the port and\n\n379\n00:19:14.367 --> 00:19:17.638\nwe have to give that port to all\nusers as part of the connection URL.\n\n380\n00:19:17.638 --> 00:19:21.504\nBecause the default connection\nwill normally assume HTTP port 80\n\n381\n00:19:21.504 --> 00:19:24.348\nHTTPS port 443, and\nunless we put a colon in and\n\n382\n00:19:24.348 --> 00:19:28.751\nspecify the port number on the end of\nthe URL statement, it will not connect,\n\n383\n00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:31.360\neven if the URL is correct\nin every other way.\n\n384\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.650\nSo, do want to know that,\njust be aware of that,\n\n385\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.386\nit's one of those little subtle things.\n\n386\n00:19:35.386 --> 00:19:38.420\nSo we just wanna make sure we're kind of\nthinking about that cuz that can kind\n\n387\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.140\nof ruin a Monday morning if we're\nnot paying attention to that.\n\n388\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.680\nSo we have that, then we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna do Next here.\n\n389\n00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.790\nAnd we have our settings\n\n390\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:55.120\nto configure the IIS application catalog,\nwe'll just kind of scroll in there.\n\n391\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.930\nWe have our site server name on this one,\nwe have our default website name, again,\n\n392\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:59.430\nand all that.\n\n393\n00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.030\nWe have our NetBIOS name, again,\nwe have our application protocols, and\n\n394\n00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.100\nour port numbers, so we see that.\n\n395\n00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.180\nNow it says at the bottom there,\n\n396\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.760\nensure that the following client\nsettings are configured as yes, to allow\n\n397\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.390\nclients to connect to this app catalogue,\nadd application client websites,\n\n398\n00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:17.050\ninternet explorer trusted site zone,\ncurrent default.\n\n399\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.660\nThe current default client setting for\nthis value is no, and\n\n400\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.450\nallow Silverlight applications\nto run in elevated trust mode,\n\n401\n00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.720\ncurrent default client setting for\nthis value is yes.\n\n402\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.440\nNow, let's just be clear about this.\n\n403\n00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.290\nLet me zoom in a little bit more.\n\n404\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.180\nLet's make that a little bigger so\n\n405\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.790\nyou guys can see, it's kinda hard\nto get that whole thing in there.\n\n406\n00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:47.590\nWhat I'm trying to focus on is,\nthat right there, client settings.\n\n407\n00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.910\nWhat I wanna highlight for you and\nmake sure you're clear and\n\n408\n00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.670\nI'm gonna take you and show you this\nonce we finish running this wizard.\n\n409\n00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.960\nWhat client settings are we\ntalking about there?\n\n410\n00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.080\n>> Talking about the configuration manager\nclient we pushed out to the endpoints.\n\n411\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.370\n>> The default client settings for\nthat agent, exactly, correct.\n\n412\n00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.580\nSo what the system is showing\nus here is it's doing a quick\n\n413\n00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.460\nvalue check on the current settings\nof the client agent settings,\n\n414\n00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.296\nthe default client agent\nsettings that are in play.\n\n415\n00:21:14.296 --> 00:21:17.370\nAs Mike said, once we push out,\nremember by default and\n\n416\n00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.420\nby design,\nwe only have one set in the console,\n\n417\n00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.905\nunless we create custom ones that we have\ntalked about and are deploying those.\n\n418\n00:21:24.905 --> 00:21:28.350\nBut the normal standpoint is hey,\nwe've got one set, it's the default set,\n\n419\n00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.110\neveryone operates with it, we are checking\nthose settings in that particular item and\n\n420\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.960\nwe're seeing that one of them is\nset to yes, the other is set to no.\n\n421\n00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.360\nSo one of the things we're gonna\ndo as soon as we finish this,\n\n422\n00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.010\nis we're gonna have to go and\nupdate those client settings\n\n423\n00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.350\nto make sure that it works the right way\nso we actually can bring up the website,\n\n424\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.290\nand that all the clients can\nactually interact with it.\n\n425\n00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.970\nSo this is reminding us of that,\nwe have to focus on that,\n\n426\n00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:54.850\nhave to understand that in case we\nare not aware of it, we may miss that and\n\n427\n00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.460\nas a result of that,\nalthough we've done all this great work,\n\n428\n00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.960\nthe application catalogue\nwill not work the right way.\n\n429\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.500\nSomething as simple as that, just not\nhaving in the default trusted site zone\n\n430\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.214\nfor IE, which is not so simple, cuz if\nyou think about it, is a security issue.\n\n431\n00:22:07.214 --> 00:22:11.520\nIt'll work but the problem is IE will\nblock it and won't allow it to show up,\n\n432\n00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.420\nwhich will be a royal pain, for\nlack of a better way of describing that.\n\n433\n00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.030\nSo, just make sure you take note of that.\n\n434\n00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.202\nI will show you how to set\nthose settings by the way.\n\n435\n00:22:19.202 --> 00:22:21.590\nWe will take a look at that as soon as\nwe're done running through this wizard.\n\n436\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.910\nSo we're gonna click Next here.\n\n437\n00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.315\nWe then have our organization name.\n\n438\n00:22:27.315 --> 00:22:31.005\nAnd we have, and this is my most favorite\npart of the whole thing by the way.\n\n439\n00:22:31.005 --> 00:22:35.275\nI love this part right here,\nwe can choose a color scheme.\n\n440\n00:22:35.275 --> 00:22:36.745\nSo exciting.\n\n441\n00:22:36.745 --> 00:22:38.175\n>> [LAUGH] Extremely important for sure.\n\n442\n00:22:38.175 --> 00:22:40.095\n>> I can hardly contain myself.\n\n443\n00:22:42.895 --> 00:22:46.405\nI'm trying really hard to contain\nmyself by the way, as you can see.\n\n444\n00:22:46.405 --> 00:22:52.323\nSo we'll put in our name of our\norganization, whatever that is,\n\n445\n00:22:52.323 --> 00:22:56.638\nand then we will choose\nthe appropriate color.\n\n446\n00:22:56.638 --> 00:23:00.316\nI like to choose red because it's just\none of the most annoying colors in\n\n447\n00:23:00.316 --> 00:23:03.460\nthis particular scheme,\njust pisses off users to no end..\n\n448\n00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.750\n>> [LAUGH] I can see you doing that.\nWe could actually go to the color wheel\n\n449\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:09.060\nand choose a nice magenta or a teal and\n\n450\n00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.158\npurple combination that create turple,\nwhich is also a very nice color.\n\n451\n00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:15.800\nAnd I've patented that color, by the way.\n\n452\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.740\nTurple, that is mine, or chime, which\nis lime and cherry all rolled together.\n\n453\n00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.530\nYou can have all sorts of fun here, right?\n\n454\n00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.230\nPorge which is pink and\norange all combined together.\n\n455\n00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.750\nSo you could do all sorts of ones,\ntotally up to you.\n\n456\n00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.690\nWe're gonna move along because as\nusual Mike is just distracting\n\n457\n00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.070\nus from getting our job done.\n\n458\n00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.517\nBut the default is blue, you'll see\nwhat this color scheme actually mean,\n\n459\n00:23:37.517 --> 00:23:40.680\nall this really is is just\nthe branding on the sites so\n\n460\n00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.180\nthe color of the words and\nthe background is gonna be this or that.\n\n461\n00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.470\nSo you choose whatever color you want.\n\n462\n00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.670\nIt's actually one of the most\nirrelevant settings we actually have in\n\n463\n00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:50.546\nthe entire thing.\n\n464\n00:23:50.546 --> 00:23:53.185\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nchoose a nice lime, and\n\n465\n00:23:53.185 --> 00:23:56.470\ncuz I really do like you guys enough\nnot to piss you off totally, but\n\n466\n00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.047\nI don't like you just enough to be able\nto make you suffer a little bit, so\n\n467\n00:24:00.047 --> 00:24:02.422\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do lime.\n\n468\n00:24:02.422 --> 00:24:06.004\nAnd then, what we're gonna do here is\nwe're just gonna simply finish up.\n\n469\n00:24:06.004 --> 00:24:08.210\nWe'll hit Next here,\nit's gonna finish out.\n\n470\n00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.090\nIt's gonna take a moment to do this.\n\n471\n00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.100\nThe configuration is really very,\nvery straightforward.\n\n472\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.310\nAll we're doing is\nloading the actual role.\n\n473\n00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.580\nAnd then, everything else\ntakes place behind the scenes.\n\n474\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.510\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click Close here.\n\n475\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.780\nAnd we will see as soon as that is done,\nwe'll wait for\n\n476\n00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.950\nan update here, just has to refresh.\n\n477\n00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.521\nBut we 'll see that the site roles\nare now gonna be instantiated there, so\n\n478\n00:24:29.521 --> 00:24:31.511\nwe'll kinda move away, change focus.\n\n479\n00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:36.980\nWe'll be able to come back at a listing\nof our site roles and we can zoom in.\n\n480\n00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.630\nAnd indeed see that they\nare now listed there and\n\n481\n00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.860\nhave been set up, so we can see them.\n\n482\n00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.714\nSo that's pretty straightforward.\n\n483\n00:24:44.714 --> 00:24:48.361\nSo now that we've done that,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n484\n00:24:48.361 --> 00:24:52.894\nwe're gonna just take a quick look\nat what that ultimately equals.\n\n485\n00:24:52.894 --> 00:24:56.690\nAnd what I'm talking about is just what\nare the dos and don'ts around this.\n\n486\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.699\nWe obviously would be able to go in and\nload up software and\n\n487\n00:24:59.699 --> 00:25:03.284\nbe able to set software up for\nsomebody to download if they chose to.\n\n488\n00:25:03.284 --> 00:25:06.252\nWe'd have to have the application\nclient running, or excuse me,\n\n489\n00:25:06.252 --> 00:25:09.697\nthe agent client running and I'm gonna\nshow you the settings to make sure that\n\n490\n00:25:09.697 --> 00:25:12.980\nwe've changed settings that have\nto be configured for that to work.\n\n491\n00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.040\nSo let's start with taking\na look at the settings,\n\n492\n00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.180\nwe're gonna go in and we're gonna go to\nour client settings which is right here.\n\n493\n00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.106\nAnd we'll just bring up that default\nclient setting and we'll go in and\n\n494\n00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:22.995\nlook at Properties.\n\n495\n00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:28.189\nSo we'll just give that a second\nto load up there and there we go.\n\n496\n00:25:28.189 --> 00:25:31.699\nAnd of course, that's nice,\nwe have one of the client settings, but\n\n497\n00:25:31.699 --> 00:25:33.438\nnot the default client settings.\n\n498\n00:25:33.438 --> 00:25:35.375\n>> [INAUDIBLE] another default one, yeah.\n\n499\n00:25:35.375 --> 00:25:39.493\n>> That is nice, let's give the system a\nsecond to rethink that one, since we know\n\n500\n00:25:39.493 --> 00:25:43.670\nthe default client settings have not\ngone away, they do have to be there.\n\n501\n00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:48.190\nBut every so often, the interface\njust does not wanna cooperate.\n\n502\n00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.209\nAll right, we'll take a look, no big deal,\n\n503\n00:25:51.209 --> 00:25:55.470\njust stop, it's still thinking so\nwe give it a second to.\n\n504\n00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.151\nThere we go to come up,\nI know they're there even though\n\n505\n00:25:58.151 --> 00:26:01.190\nit doesn't wanna show them to us,\nwe know they are there.\n\n506\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.450\nAll right, so we do see them there.\n\n507\n00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.110\nWhat we're gonna do is go ahead and\njust bring up the Properties of that one.\n\n508\n00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:09.351\nSo let me right-click and the system\nruns a little slow, sometimes when we’re\n\n509\n00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:13.402\ndoing a deployment, I don't know if you\ncan actually see it and you may not be\n\n510\n00:26:13.402 --> 00:26:17.530\nable to on the screen, although it's\nkinda moving so you may be able to.\n\n511\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:21.155\nBut there is a gray, and I'm just gonna\nkinda focus on it, and zoom in for\n\n512\n00:26:21.155 --> 00:26:21.880\na second.\n\n513\n00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.590\nThere's a gray bar that kinda runs\nright underneath the ribbon and\n\n514\n00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.800\nright above that white space where it says\nClient Settings, there's a gray bar there.\n\n515\n00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.910\nWhen the system is busy, it's almost like\nan escalator, it's zooming through there,\n\n516\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.840\nand you see shades of gray\nstreaming along in the console.\n\n517\n00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.247\nAnd that's how you could tell that it's\nbusy and that something's going on.\n\n518\n00:26:37.247 --> 00:26:40.645\nSo, we're just waiting on that to\nfinish and it has, so let's go in,\n\n519\n00:26:40.645 --> 00:26:44.680\nwe'll do our default client settings,\nright-click, we'll go to Properties,\n\n520\n00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.695\ngonna bring those up,\nwe'll come in to our Properties area.\n\n521\n00:26:47.695 --> 00:26:50.176\nAnd what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go into,\n\n522\n00:26:50.176 --> 00:26:52.301\nwe are gonna go ahead rather I should say.\n\n523\n00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:55.106\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nwhere we have to worry about or\n\n524\n00:26:55.106 --> 00:26:58.135\nat least we have to interact with,\nin terms of those settings for\n\n525\n00:26:58.135 --> 00:27:00.730\nthe deployment that we\nwere just talking about.\n\n526\n00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.905\nSo we're gonna go in and\nwe're going to take a look here.\n\n527\n00:27:03.905 --> 00:27:07.000\nLet's go in and do the following.\n\n528\n00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.894\nIf I could skip my mouse to behave itself,\nthere we go.\n\n529\n00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:12.800\nAll right, so we're gonna go in and\n\n530\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.540\nwe are going to get over\nhere to computer agent.\n\n531\n00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.084\nWe're just gonna scroll down,\n\n532\n00:27:20.084 --> 00:27:23.660\nlet me just kinda scroll down just\na little bit in there so we can see that.\n\n533\n00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.450\nAnd what we're gonna do is to [INAUDIBLE]\njust zoom in so you could see it.\n\n534\n00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.810\nAnd you can see right there.\n\n535\n00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.300\nSince add default Application Catalog\nwebsite to Internet Explorer\n\n536\n00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.205\ntrusted sites zone is set to no and\nyou'll see Silverlight applications to run\n\n537\n00:27:39.205 --> 00:27:42.990\nin elevated trust mode is set to yes,\nwe had previewed those, checked them and\n\n538\n00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.180\nsaw that those settings\nwhere the way they are.\n\n539\n00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.120\nNotice it, and it did that tell us,\nhey, both of those need to be yes.\n\n540\n00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.900\nSo obviously pull down that item and just\nchange that to yes so we can go in and\n\n541\n00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.350\ndo that real easily.\n\n542\n00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.650\nNo big deal there,\nwe'll just go ahead, we'll do that.\n\n543\n00:27:55.650 --> 00:28:00.810\nAnd then the default application\ncatalog website point, go in there,\n\n544\n00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.240\nwe'll set a website.\n\n545\n00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.555\nWe can go in, and we could select that\napplication website and let it be auto\n\n546\n00:28:06.555 --> 00:28:11.161\ndetected and, or if we know what it is,\nwe could specify URL if we wanna do that.\n\n547\n00:28:11.161 --> 00:28:14.064\nSo we'll just let that be\nauto detected and click OK.\n\n548\n00:28:14.064 --> 00:28:17.875\nThat way, we'll figure it out, and\nthen, once we're done with that,\n\n549\n00:28:17.875 --> 00:28:21.198\nthat's really the main settings\nwe need to deal with in there.\n\n550\n00:28:21.198 --> 00:28:23.780\nSo we're gonna click OK,\nthat will take care of the app settings.\n\n551\n00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.632\nWe've pushed that out to the client's,\nupdate that and then,\n\n552\n00:28:26.632 --> 00:28:31.150\nover time we would then be able to go in\nand actually be able to get that to work.\n\n553\n00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:36.900\nNow, what we're gonna do is to follow,\nI'm gonna come over here to assets and\n\n554\n00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.780\ncompliance, and I'm gonna come over\nhere to the, what am I on SY01,\n\n555\n00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.970\nlet me just go down here to SY01.\n\n556\n00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:50.840\nAnd let's go ahead, let's do\na installation of the client real quick\n\n557\n00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.138\ncuz we don't have the client\nagent currently running.\n\n558\n00:28:53.138 --> 00:28:55.090\nSo let's just go ahead and install that.\n\n559\n00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.150\nThat way you guys can\njust see that happen.\n\n560\n00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.400\nWe'll push that out to our selves here.\n\n561\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.380\nAnd then we can take a look at that and\njust see the information.\n\n562\n00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.700\nAll right, so we'll get that set up, or\n\n563\n00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.780\nat least we'll push the agent\nout as soon as it's finished.\n\n564\n00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.160\nI don't know if you can see it, but\nthat gray line is racing across up there.\n\n565\n00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.160\nIt's kind of, you can see the white go by,\nso it's a little busy.\n\n566\n00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.630\nSo we're just waiting on\nthat to finish thinking.\n\n567\n00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.980\nSo while we wait on that to finish\nthinking, that'll take just a minute.\n\n568\n00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.290\nWhat we basically are able to do at this\npoint if we choose to is to go out and\n\n569\n00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:30.570\nbe able to actually take a look at the,\nor potentially if you want to,\n\n570\n00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:35.320\nnot only deploy it, but actually go out\nand take a look at the software center,\n\n571\n00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.880\nor at least think about taking\na look at the software center.\n\n572\n00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.659\nAnd so what we can do is we can go in, and\n\n573\n00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:43.296\nactually let me just see if while we're\nwaiting on that we can do the filings.\n\n574\n00:29:43.296 --> 00:29:47.952\nOur pointer's kind of all crazy here,\nso let me go in and\n\n575\n00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:51.831\nI'll just take a look at\none quick thing here.\n\n576\n00:29:54.791 --> 00:29:56.707\nJust make sure, okay, so it's not there.\n\n577\n00:29:56.707 --> 00:29:58.135\nSo I wanna make sure it was not there.\n\n578\n00:29:58.135 --> 00:30:04.671\nAll right, how do we get that deployed,\nand there we go.\n\n579\n00:30:04.671 --> 00:30:05.948\nAll right, so\nlet's just come back in there.\n\n580\n00:30:05.948 --> 00:30:07.109\nThat should be all right,\nthat's ready to go.\n\n581\n00:30:07.109 --> 00:30:10.382\nSo we're gonna highlight our\nmachine there, just go ahead and\n\n582\n00:30:10.382 --> 00:30:13.669\nclick Install Client, go ahead and\nwe'll click Next on that.\n\n583\n00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:20.303\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe will install from a specific site.\n\n584\n00:30:20.303 --> 00:30:24.290\nAlways install, allow on to make\ncontrollers if we have a need to.\n\n585\n00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.371\nSome selected resources,\nall right oh, I know why,\n\n586\n00:30:29.371 --> 00:30:31.968\ncuz it didn't register\nthe click on the machine.\n\n587\n00:30:31.968 --> 00:30:34.904\nIt's thinking I wanna do the whole\ncollection, all right, one second.\n\n588\n00:30:34.904 --> 00:30:38.074\nIt's not realizing that I only\nwanna do that one machine.\n\n589\n00:30:38.074 --> 00:30:39.595\nAll right, let's do it this way.\n\n590\n00:30:39.595 --> 00:30:41.719\nThat should eliminate the error there.\n\n591\n00:30:41.719 --> 00:30:43.750\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nwe'll do that.\n\n592\n00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:49.847\nLet's go ahead and do that cuz that\nshould come back without a problem.\n\n593\n00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:53.702\nThere we go, see that,\nlove that console, boy.\n\n594\n00:30:53.702 --> 00:30:55.569\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just love how quickly that keeps\n\n595\n00:30:55.569 --> 00:30:56.419\nup with everything.\n\n596\n00:30:56.419 --> 00:30:59.150\nAll right, so we're gonna just\npush that out there real quick.\n\n597\n00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:04.120\nThat way, the agent shows up, then what\nwe can do is do a refresh on the policy,\n\n598\n00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.950\nso that way, it registers the fact\nthat we made the change and\n\n599\n00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.340\nput the website in on the trusted site.\n\n600\n00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.089\nSo we would then be able to see that\nif we wanted to take a look at it.\n\n601\n00:31:12.089 --> 00:31:16.489\nThat would then allow us to be able to go\nin and to then actually be able to go take\n\n602\n00:31:16.489 --> 00:31:20.173\na look ultimately and\nsee that the security settings are there.\n\n603\n00:31:20.173 --> 00:31:24.090\nAnd then we would be able to bring up the\napplication catalog site if we chose to\n\n604\n00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.336\nand actually be able\nto interact with that.\n\n605\n00:31:26.336 --> 00:31:29.254\nSo that's something that it\nbecomes important for us,\n\n606\n00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:32.543\nbecause if we wanna actually be able\nto go in and to take a look and\n\n607\n00:31:32.543 --> 00:31:36.764\nsee what's going on in there, we will then\nhave to obviously have the rights from\n\n608\n00:31:36.764 --> 00:31:39.090\na security standpoint\nto be able to do that.\n\n609\n00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.220\nSo that is gonna be important and\nwe do have to be thinking about whether or\n\n610\n00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.190\nnot that is something that we\nwould like to be able to do.\n\n611\n00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.782\nLet's go in and let's just take\na look at the App Catalog release.\n\n612\n00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:50.950\nLet's just take a look at\npotentially what it would look like.\n\n613\n00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:57.940\nSo let me just bring up\nthe Item right here,\n\n614\n00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:03.690\nlet's get rid of that,\nand let's just do this,\n\n615\n00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:07.615\nhttp:, this is, what is this,\n\n616\n00:32:07.615 --> 00:32:13.224\nthis is P-L-A-B-S what is that, SYS 01,\n\n617\n00:32:13.224 --> 00:32:18.080\nSYS 01, dot, what is my domain name?\n\n618\n00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:18.810\nHold on one second.\n\n619\n00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:19.640\nI just need my domain name.\n\n620\n00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.895\nI forgot what the whole domain thing is.\n\n621\n00:32:21.895 --> 00:32:22.470\nPracticelab.com.\n\n622\n00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.730\nThat's what it was,\nI just couldn't remember what it was.\n\n623\n00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.810\nPracticelab.com, and\n\n624\n00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:35.020\nthen we need the following,\nor, did I, stupid me.\n\n625\n00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.515\nHalf a second, I'm just getting my domain.\n\n626\n00:32:36.515 --> 00:32:39.081\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Information there, and\n\n627\n00:32:39.081 --> 00:32:44.635\nthen we need a slash, whoops,\n/CMApplicationCatalog.\n\n628\n00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.800\nAnd I think I spelled that correctly.\n\n629\n00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.575\nAll right now you'll see here, because I\nhave not put in the security policy yet\n\n630\n00:32:58.575 --> 00:33:01.240\nand put it into the trusted site, right?\n\n631\n00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.590\nYou'll see that it's not allowing\nme to go in there, right?\n\n632\n00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.930\nSo we're not allowed effectively,\n\n633\n00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.720\nthat web page block is coming from the lab\nenvironment, but the idea is that we're\n\n634\n00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.950\nnot able to get to it because we\nhaven't allowed it to show up, right?\n\n635\n00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:20.000\nAnd so just be aware of the fact\nthat without that policy we're gonna\n\n636\n00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.965\nhave an issue.\n\n637\n00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:23.705\nWe wouldn't be able to bring it up\nif we had it actually loaded and\n\n638\n00:33:23.705 --> 00:33:24.535\navailable in real time.\n\n639\n00:33:24.535 --> 00:33:27.965\nSo I just wanted to show you that\nobviously that's gonna become important,\n\n640\n00:33:27.965 --> 00:33:32.835\nbecause if we don't actually have that\nin there, we're gonna run into an issue.\n\n641\n00:33:32.835 --> 00:33:37.445\nAnd so we do wanna obviously update that\nand although we could do it manually, and\n\n642\n00:33:37.445 --> 00:33:39.255\nlet's just see if the agent's installed.\n\n643\n00:33:39.255 --> 00:33:41.130\nIf it's not,\nwe're gonna wait any longer on it.\n\n644\n00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.530\nYou guys get the general idea, but if the\nagent's, there I'll just run the updated,\n\n645\n00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.758\nhasn't installed yet, it can take up\nto five to ten minutes to install.\n\n646\n00:33:47.758 --> 00:33:50.780\nSo, may not actually be able to get it\nin there, but you get the general idea.\n\n647\n00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.000\nWe're blocking that.\n\n648\n00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.180\nWe'd have to go in and allow it and\nIE in effect, right, and\n\n649\n00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.610\njust be able to bring that up.\n\n650\n00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.510\nBut once we did that we would then be able\nto bring up the application catalog site.\n\n651\n00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.820\nWe then would be able to effectively\ndownload any software that may\n\n652\n00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.510\nhave been posted there from\na self-service perspective.\n\n653\n00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.110\nSo it would allow us to be\nable to do that functionality.\n\n654\n00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:11.000\nSo configuring it was really just\na matter of setting up the roles, and\n\n655\n00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.870\nthen from there we would be able to do\nthe deployment the way we've done and\n\n656\n00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.910\nset up the software, and push it out.\n\n657\n00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:17.560\nThen, we'd be able to\nuse it if we wanted to.\n\n658\n00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.763\nSo it's obviously pretty cool.\n\n659\n00:34:18.763 --> 00:34:22.023\nIf you wanted to see the tail end of\nthat where it actually does show up,\n\n660\n00:34:22.023 --> 00:34:23.530\nyou could go out and take a look.\n\n661\n00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.730\nIf you look at the documentation\nwe told you to take a look at, or\n\n662\n00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:30.380\neven just go out and look for a YouTube\nvideo on how to do the whole set up.\n\n663\n00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.420\nMicrosoft actually has some really\ncool videos on their MVA site.\n\n664\n00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.400\nYou guys talk about MVA,\nthe Microsoft Virtual Academy, at all?\n\n665\n00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:36.930\n>> I don't think so.\n\n666\n00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:39.600\n>> Okay, so let's just do this real quick,\njust bring up the website, and\n\n667\n00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.220\nwe'll go out and we'll take a look,\nand I'll show where to go.\n\n668\n00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.370\nGo to MicrosoftVirtualAcademy.com,\nall one word.\n\n669\n00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.490\nAnd can we go to Mike's website,\nMike's website,\n\n670\n00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:52.110\ncan we go to Mike's machine real quick,\nTitus?\n\n671\n00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.270\nThank you so much.\n\n672\n00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.730\nSo, MicrosoftVirtualAcademy.com.\n\n673\n00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.360\nNo, that's not the right one.\n\n674\n00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.450\nDo a google for Microsoft Virtual Academy.\n\n675\n00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.415\nThat's somebody else that's\npretending to be Microsoft.\n\n676\n00:35:01.415 --> 00:35:04.430\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> I think it might be mva.microsoft.com\n\n677\n00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:05.060\nis what I'm thinking.\n\n678\n00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.048\nBut just do Microsoft Virtual Academy,\nyeah, just bring that up and\n\n679\n00:35:08.048 --> 00:35:08.660\nget a listing.\n\n680\n00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.830\nI think that should be\nthe right one right there.\n\n681\n00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.878\n>> mva.microsoft-\n>> mva.microsoft.com, right.\n\n682\n00:35:11.878 --> 00:35:13.730\nSo just click on that and bring it up.\n\n683\n00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.540\nSo if you guys have not seen the Microsoft\nVirtual Academy before, this is where all\n\n684\n00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:23.330\nthe online, free e-learning and\ntraining is offered from Microsoft.\n\n685\n00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.650\nIt's got a wealth of\nreally cool stuff on it.\n\n686\n00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:29.660\nAnd it's broken up by category,\nso you can do app-dev stuff,\n\n687\n00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.030\nyou can do system admin stuff,\nthere's all sorts of stuff in there.\n\n688\n00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.010\nAnd if you go in and\nyou search by topic or by area.\n\n689\n00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.400\nSo you go to IT Pro,\ninstead of Developers,\n\n690\n00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.110\ncuz right now I think you\nhave the Developers one.\n\n691\n00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.970\nSelect it, you bring up the IT Pro area.\n\n692\n00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.090\nIt's got category stuff\nspecific to IT Pros.\n\n693\n00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.780\nAnd, excuse me, then you may be\nable to do a search in there, so\n\n694\n00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.460\nyou could probably do a search by topic.\n\n695\n00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.430\nSo you could go in.\n\n696\n00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.350\nYou could do a search for\nyou know SCCM for instance, right?\n\n697\n00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.040\nFind all the stuff that's\navailable on SCCM so\n\n698\n00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.380\nwe'd be able to take a look for that.\n\n699\n00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.090\nIt does have to load the catalog.\n\n700\n00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:06.906\nIt may take a minute to do that,\nbut the idea would be that yeah,\n\n701\n00:36:06.906 --> 00:36:08.623\nthen you can see results for courses.\n\n702\n00:36:08.623 --> 00:36:10.913\nYou can see this is a pretty\nintuitive interface.\n\n703\n00:36:10.913 --> 00:36:14.250\nYou could go in and you could search for\nwhatever you want to see.\n\n704\n00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:18.971\nAnd then these are self paced e-Learning\nenvironments that have prerecorded\n\n705\n00:36:18.971 --> 00:36:20.040\ncontent.\n\n706\n00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.592\nIt's not live, it's not interactive, but\n\n707\n00:36:22.592 --> 00:36:26.220\nit does give you the opportunity\nto learn some basic stuff.\n\n708\n00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:30.130\nThere maybe links to additional\nresources available there.\n\n709\n00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.550\nThere's usually links to the hosted\nhands-on labs through TechNet.\n\n710\n00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:36.320\nSo it's actually a really nice\nlittle integrated environment\n\n711\n00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.540\nto do some additional, hands-on follow\nup in terms of skill gathering.\n\n712\n00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.950\nSo you could just follow up there as\nwell if you're not familiar with that.\n\n713\n00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.280\nIt would be an additional\ncool resource for you.\n\n714\n00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.520\nSo just think about that.\n\n715\n00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.030\nWe did have a couple of graphics\nwe just wanted to end up with,\n\n716\n00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.550\nwith regards to device affinity.\n\n717\n00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.300\nYou've got that little one there.\n\n718\n00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.130\nAnd so\nlet's just talk about device affinity and\n\n719\n00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.640\nwe'll just quickly review what simulated\ndeployments are and give you a list of\n\n720\n00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.950\nsome additional log files that you want\nto be looking at as well from a trouble\n\n721\n00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.940\nshooting perspective to wrap up this\nparticular episode and this conversation.\n\n722\n00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.160\nSo I mentioned device\naffinity in the last episode.\n\n723\n00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.680\nWe talked about the idea\nthat device affinity\n\n724\n00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.020\nallows users to be associated with\na device and say hey, this is my device,\n\n725\n00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.970\nany software you deploy to me should be\ndeployed to this device on my behalf.\n\n726\n00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.050\nThat kind of thing.\n\n727\n00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.370\nSo the idea with device affinity\nis that a user says yes,\n\n728\n00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.690\nI use this particular set of devices.\n\n729\n00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:30.250\nYou could see we have a user kinda\npointing to three devices of various\n\n730\n00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.530\ntypes up there.\n\n731\n00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:32.870\nAnd then down below,\n\n732\n00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.408\nwe have another user that's kind of\noff to the side that's not associated.\n\n733\n00:37:36.408 --> 00:37:37.320\nThat user looks so\n\n734\n00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:42.190\nmuch sadder by comparison to the one\nup above, not associated with a device.\n\n735\n00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.950\nAnd as a result of that, we could see the\nbig red X that Mike has put on the screen,\n\n736\n00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:49.360\nindicating no device affinity.\n\n737\n00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.455\nAnd so, as a result of that,\nwhen we do a deployment\n\n738\n00:37:52.455 --> 00:37:57.370\nthe arrows coming out of the site server\non the right kind of indicate software or\n\n739\n00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.870\napplication packages being deployed.\n\n740\n00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:03.190\nWe don't deploy to the one with the X\nbecause there's no affinity, the user has\n\n741\n00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:07.420\nnot said, I work and/or I play here so\nyou should put my software there.\n\n742\n00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.320\nSo device affinity is all about making\nsure that users associate with devices.\n\n743\n00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.510\nAnd then if we do user-based deployments\nas opposed to computer-based deployments,\n\n744\n00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:20.150\nwe don't deploy software to devices that\nusers have not created an affinity for.\n\n745\n00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.252\nSo, that's kind of how that works.\n\n746\n00:38:21.252 --> 00:38:24.560\nSo just interesting to review that, and\nmaybe give you a little graphic on that to\n\n747\n00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.000\nmake sure you're\ncomfortable with that idea.\n\n748\n00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.780\nWe also, I want to remind you about\ndeploying applications over all,\n\n749\n00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.383\njust the thought process with that.\n\n750\n00:38:32.383 --> 00:38:34.025\nI don't know if we can\nzoom in just a little bit,\n\n751\n00:38:34.025 --> 00:38:35.740\nmaybe make that just slightly bigger.\n\n752\n00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.880\nBut the idea we have there is we have\n\n753\n00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.150\na user down at the bottom there on\nan end point looking at information or\n\n754\n00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:47.400\njust waiting for information to\ncome down and/or go back and forth.\n\n755\n00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:52.310\nRemember the computer agent will actually\nupdate the management point every so\n\n756\n00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:56.270\noften by checking in and\nsaying hey every 60 minutes by default.\n\n757\n00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.510\nIs there a policy update?\n\n758\n00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.180\nIf there is, can I please receive the\noutput of that and see what's going on?\n\n759\n00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.870\nManagement point is a central point\nof communication for the endpoint,\n\n760\n00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.468\nthe managed endpoint, the client agent.\n\n761\n00:39:06.468 --> 00:39:10.280\nThe management point checks with\nthe primary site server, says hey,\n\n762\n00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.440\nis there any update?\n\n763\n00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.920\nPrimary site server may say,\nyes, there is.\n\n764\n00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.100\nThere is a package or an application\nwaiting at one more distribution points\n\n765\n00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.930\nplease notify the endpoint that it\nshould go ahead and download that.\n\n766\n00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:25.130\nSo then the endpoint goes out in\nthe arrow on the right, goes and\n\n767\n00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.770\nfinds the distribution point.\n\n768\n00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.690\nAnd, then, actually,\nwill stream down that application,\n\n769\n00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:32.450\nor whatever package is waiting there,\nand will bring it down.\n\n770\n00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.110\nSo this is how an application or\npackage deployment is gonna take place.\n\n771\n00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.530\nSo, just wanted to give you\na graphic to remind you of that.\n\n772\n00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:45.240\nWe, actually, did this in our last\ndiscussion in the other episode, but\n\n773\n00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.980\nthis just brings to life for us\ngraphically what we did by way of review.\n\n774\n00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.490\nWe also talked about what\na simulated deployment is.\n\n775\n00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.456\nI went through and\ntalked to you about that and\n\n776\n00:39:53.456 --> 00:39:55.129\njust talked about the what if nature.\n\n777\n00:39:55.129 --> 00:39:56.845\nWe demoed it from the perspective of hey,\n\n778\n00:39:56.845 --> 00:39:58.961\ncan you do it after you've\ndone a real deployment?\n\n779\n00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:00.587\nThe answer is of course no.\n\n780\n00:40:00.587 --> 00:40:04.856\nWe talked about that and I showed you that\nwe got an error as a result of that but\n\n781\n00:40:04.856 --> 00:40:08.727\nI did remind you that you would want\nto do these prior to actually doing\n\n782\n00:40:08.727 --> 00:40:13.560\nthe deployment so that way we could test\nthe water and see what would happen.\n\n783\n00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.960\nWe just summarized the points here for\nthe simulated deployment.\n\n784\n00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.550\nIt allows us to test evaluation of, as you\ncan see, requirements in the application\n\n785\n00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:24.428\ndeployment type without having\nto distribute the files.\n\n786\n00:40:24.428 --> 00:40:27.630\nMeaning you wanna check the logic of\nthe rules of the deployment without\n\n787\n00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.170\nactually doing the deployment.\n\n788\n00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:33.820\nWe just put the information up there that\nhelps you to kinda work through logically\n\n789\n00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.010\nand make sure you understand the do's and\ndon'ts there.\n\n790\n00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.960\nGood for you to have a sense of that\nin case you're ever asked about it.\n\n791\n00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.910\nThen I think we're gonna finalize and\nfinalize our conversation today in this\n\n792\n00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:49.430\nepisode with just a referencing nod to\nthe logs both on the server side and\n\n793\n00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:54.200\non the client side that are appropriate\nand important for application deployment.\n\n794\n00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.700\nWe wanna make sure we know that there are,\nas you can see,\n\n795\n00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.390\na fairly large number of log files\nthat we may wanna take notice of and\n\n796\n00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:03.400\nbe aware of,\nthere are 73 log files overall.\n\n797\n00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.270\nIf you remember we talked about\nthat in one of our prior episodes.\n\n798\n00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:10.360\nBut of that super set, we can see\nthat there are probably a good 12 at\n\n799\n00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.500\na minimum, maybe even 14 or so,\nthat are gonna be important for\n\n800\n00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.280\nus to take notice of both on\nthe server side and on the client side.\n\n801\n00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.300\nWe would have individual\nclient logs by client\n\n802\n00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.830\nthat we may need to look at from\na troubleshooting perspective.\n\n803\n00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:27.500\nAnd then we have a group of server logs\n\n804\n00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.345\nthat are going to be common to all clients\nthat are managed across those servers.\n\n805\n00:41:31.345 --> 00:41:33.535\nWe wanna make sure we're\nfamiliar with both of those.\n\n806\n00:41:33.535 --> 00:41:36.875\nAgain, if you're preparing for the exam,\nit's always a good idea to have a sense of\n\n807\n00:41:36.875 --> 00:41:39.775\nthe log files that are appropriate for\ncertain activities.\n\n808\n00:41:39.775 --> 00:41:42.265\nYou may get asked about them, you may not.\n\n809\n00:41:42.265 --> 00:41:43.795\nHard to say, you never know.\n\n810\n00:41:43.795 --> 00:41:46.635\nBut it's always good to know because\nif you are asked about them,\n\n811\n00:41:46.635 --> 00:41:49.235\nit'll be helpful to know we do\nhave log files in both locations.\n\n812\n00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.100\nVery good, Adam.\n\n813\n00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.502\nAgain, another great episode.\n\n814\n00:41:52.502 --> 00:41:57.382\nThey're a good hands on look and we did a\nlittle review on managing applications and\n\n815\n00:41:57.382 --> 00:42:01.840\ntalked about some do's and don'ts of\ndeploying packages and applications.\n\n816\n00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.010\nWe also got to look at setting\nup the application catalog and\n\n817\n00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.820\nhow we can make those available\nvia the network, we'll say.\n\n818\n00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.300\nWhether you're inside and\nusing HTTP and or HTTPS or\n\n819\n00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.010\non the outside in the internet\nwhere we can only use HTTPS but\n\n820\n00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.650\nmaking it available to the user\nwhere the they can choose.\n\n821\n00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:22.630\nInstead of us scheduling that install,\ntelling them when they're gonna get it,\n\n822\n00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.590\nwhat they're gonna get,\nwe can set up a catalog.\n\n823\n00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.590\nLet them pick and see what they want and\nwhen they wanna get it.\n\n824\n00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:29.070\nSo really good stuff there.\n\n825\n00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.160\nI hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n826\n00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.650\nRemember, if you attend one\nof Adam's classes live,\n\n827\n00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.540\nshoot us an email here\nat seeadam@itpro.tv.\n\n828\n00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.470\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n829\n00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.060\n>> I'm an application package,\nwaiting deployment.\n\n830\n00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.139\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n831\n00:42:43.139 --> 00:42:48.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:18.091\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:21.550\nToday we're doing our SCCM 2012R2 content.\n\n6\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.300\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be focusing on software updates.\n\n7\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.420\nI know this is a big part of what\npeople wanna do with SCCM, so\n\n8\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.800\nhere to help us to figure out how we do it\nand how we do it well, is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.210\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.570\n>> I have to do it and do it well?\n\n11\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.450\nWow, that is a huge, huge burden for\n\n12\n00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.640\nme to bear in the early\nmorning with rain outside.\n\n13\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.390\n>> No pressure, right?\n\n14\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.040\n>> You haven't fixed\nthe valet parking issue, so\n\n15\n00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.900\nI had to walk to the studio in the rain.\n\n16\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.270\n>> It's crazy.\n\n17\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.561\nI can't work under these conditions,\nthis is really.\n\n18\n00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:54.043\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is presenting a challenge for me.\n\n19\n00:00:54.043 --> 00:00:55.240\n>> Drop the mic and go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.740\n>> All right.\n\n21\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.690\nSo, I am doing well, and I thank you for\n\n22\n00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.720\nasking on this fine, rainy morning that\nwe're having outside the studios, here.\n\n23\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.541\nSo, we're gonna spend some time\ntalking about integrating WSUS and\n\n24\n00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.170\nthe patch management\nfunctionality into SCCM.\n\n25\n00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.340\nWhat we're gonna do is take a slightly\ndifferent approach than we've been using\n\n26\n00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.730\nup until now, because of some of\nthe constraints of setting up and actually\n\n27\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.790\ngetting all of the infrastructure built\nout, so that we can do the demo for this.\n\n28\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.620\nI'm gonna explain what I mean because\nthis'll happen even in the real world\n\n29\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.460\nas well.\n\n30\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.560\nAnd so you're gonna wanna account for\nthis as you begin to set up and\n\n31\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.910\nintegrate WSUS into the patch\nmanagement functionality or\n\n32\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.880\nthrough into the software updating\nfunctionality within the SCCM console.\n\n33\n00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.190\nSo, what we normally have done in most of\nthe episodes where we're gonna do a live\n\n34\n00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.750\ndemo, is spend some time setting it up for\nyou.\n\n35\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.390\nGive you the background,\nshow you some of the configuration steps,\n\n36\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.030\nput out the lists for you,\nexplain to you what we're gonna do,\n\n37\n00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.000\nand give you that high level summary,\nso that by the time we get in and\n\n38\n00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.070\nactually do something, you've got a fairly\ngood understanding of the process.\n\n39\n00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160\nWe're still gonna do that by the way.\n\n40\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.500\nWe're not gonna do that up front.\n\n41\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.240\nInstead what we're gonna do, is jump right\ninto the demo environment here in just\n\n42\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.930\na minute, begin the process of getting the\nsite server roles installed, going in and\n\n43\n00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.080\nsetting up and configuring\nthe synchronization of the WSUS server,\n\n44\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.070\ndo the download for us for\nMicrosoft to build our security catalog.\n\n45\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.916\nThat, in the real world, can take a\nsignificant amount of time the first time\n\n46\n00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:25.242\nthat's done, and it will take\na significant amount of time here.\n\n47\n00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:28.156\nWe're gonna shortcut that process\na little bit by cheating,\n\n48\n00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:30.790\nand only downloading a few updates for\none category, so\n\n49\n00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.718\nwe're obviously gonna streamline\nthat as much as possible.\n\n50\n00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:36.300\nBut even then,\nit will take a little bit of time.\n\n51\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.970\nSo, what we're gonna do is get to\nthat point then while that's cooking,\n\n52\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.930\nwe'll come back out, we'll have\nour normal fireside chat, Mike and\n\n53\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.850\nI will joke around a little\nbit like we normally do.\n\n54\n00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.570\nWe'll talk about some serious things.\n\n55\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.750\nWe'll put up our list, put up the demo\ngraphics that Mike has put together for\n\n56\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.440\nus to walk us through the process\nthat we have already been through,\n\n57\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.740\nthe ones that will be coming up\nthroughout the rest of the demonstration.\n\n58\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.130\nThat'll give us the buffer time we need\nhopefully to get that synchronization\n\n59\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.600\nhappening behind the scenes.\n\n60\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.130\nAnd then we'll go back in, we'll pick up\nfrom that point, and we'll continue on.\n\n61\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.000\nSo, just wanna give you a sense\nof what's gonna happen, so\n\n62\n00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.350\nthat as you're watching\nus do certain things and\n\n63\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.950\nyou see potentially that it looks just\na little bit different than it has.\n\n64\n00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.270\nWe don't want you to wonder about why and\nbe concerned about that.\n\n65\n00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.320\nSo, what I'd like to do, let's just\nreally quickly paint a picture for\n\n66\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.720\nyou of what it is we're gonna do at a high\nlevel, just in terms of the initial steps.\n\n67\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.550\nThen, we're gonna go to my\nmachine in just a minute,\n\n68\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.470\nand then we're gonna\nactually start the process.\n\n69\n00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.380\nSo, the idea here is that ultimately,\nwe wanna be able to use the software\n\n70\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.340\nupdate feature that is\nbuilt into SCCM 2012.\n\n71\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.210\n>> R2.\n>> R2, because,\n\n72\n00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.420\nwhen we do that,\nwe are effectively bringing in the WSUS,\n\n73\n00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.590\nthe Windows Software Update Server\nfunctionality.\n\n74\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.190\nWe are actually leveraging a WSUS server.\n\n75\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.700\nWe have to have one set up somewhere and\ninstalled, so we're gonna talk about that.\n\n76\n00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.440\nWe've already installed and\nconfigured the WSUS server.\n\n77\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.620\nWe're not gonna spend time on that piece.\n\n78\n00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.960\nWe assume that you will be\ncomfortable doing that.\n\n79\n00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.940\nIf not, we will give you so\nguidance on how to do that.\n\n80\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.510\nWe'll take you out to\nthe web as we've done and\n\n81\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.070\ngive you a little hint on\nwhere to go to look for that.\n\n82\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.480\nBut that process if\nfairly straight forward.\n\n83\n00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.090\nIt's a feature and a roll install in\nterms of the dot net framework and\n\n84\n00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.120\nthe WSUS roll.\n\n85\n00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.590\nAnd we're not gonna spend a lot of time\non stuff that should, at this point,\n\n86\n00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.117\nin this kinda discussion, we're\nrelatively straight forward solution for\n\n87\n00:04:22.117 --> 00:04:23.270\nmost of you to engage in.\n\n88\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.427\nBut, we at least wanna\nacknowledge the step,\n\n89\n00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:27.540\nmake sure we understand\nthat has to be there.\n\n90\n00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.870\nAnd we've got some guidance\non what the pre look like for\n\n91\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.510\ngetting the software update\nfeatures set totally installed.\n\n92\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.470\nWe'll share those with you,\n\n93\n00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.440\nwhen we take that break from the demo\nenvironment in a little bit.\n\n94\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.248\nBut, basically we're gonna set this up and\nintegrate this, so the first step in\n\n95\n00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:44.670\nthe process is gonna be to set up a site\nserver roll for software updated.\n\n96\n00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.950\nWe're gonna go through that\nprocess,configure that.\n\n97\n00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.240\nOnce we've got that done, we'll go out and\nwe will synchronize our catalog,\n\n98\n00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.560\nour update catalog.\n\n99\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.600\nWe'll then leverage that update catalog\nto then begin to figure out what updates\n\n100\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.770\nwe may be able to deploy.\n\n101\n00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.100\nKeep in mind that, in any of\nthe environments that we're managing,\n\n102\n00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.490\nwe're gonna have different\noperating systems,\n\n103\n00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.120\ndifferent endpoints with\ndifferent programs on them.\n\n104\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.300\nWe may be downloading updates for things\nsuch as Microsoft Office, for SQL Server,\n\n105\n00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.950\nfor Exchange server, for SharePoint,\nas well as the core operating systems,\n\n106\n00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.320\nWindows 7, Windows 8,\nWindows 10 on the desktop.\n\n107\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.470\nOn the server side, 2008, 2008 R2,\nServer 12, 12 R2, Server 16, etc.\n\n108\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.229\nAnd so, we may have multiple categories,\nand potentially also multiple language\n\n109\n00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.920\nsets, cuz this is one of the other\nthings that does come up.\n\n110\n00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.223\nAnd it may or may not come up for\nyou, but it comes up for\n\n111\n00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:44.030\na great number of my clients,\nthat they support multilingual installs.\n\n112\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.330\nSo, working across different geographies,\ndifferent countries.\n\n113\n00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.790\nYou may have the same installation\nof Windows 7 on the desktop, but\n\n114\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.760\nit may be running in English,\nin German, in Spanish,\n\n115\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.440\nin French,\nwhatever those language sets may be.\n\n116\n00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.850\nAnd so, our update feature has to\nsupport multilingual installs as well.\n\n117\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.350\nAnd so, we actually have the option,\n\n118\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.400\nas we do in WSUS, to be able to download\nmultiple updates in multiple languages.\n\n119\n00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.510\nSo, we're not gonna do\nmultilingual update installs here,\n\n120\n00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.200\ncuz we really only working\nwith an English set overall.\n\n121\n00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.700\nBut the idea is the same as\nit would be anywhere else.\n\n122\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.310\nYou have the need,\n\n123\n00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.930\nyou download the appropriate once\nin the catalog and sync it up.\n\n124\n00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.630\nSo, we're wanna go to my machine.\n\n125\n00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.550\nWe're gonna start to take\na look on how to set this up.\n\n126\n00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.710\nWe'll go wide screen so\nthat way you can see everything.\n\n127\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.190\nYour not gonna see me\ntalking over the console.\n\n128\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.550\nSo, if we can go to my demo\nmachine that would be wonderful.\n\n129\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.600\nThank you.\nAnd if we can go to full screen,\n\n130\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.960\nthat way we can see everything.\n\n131\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.750\nPerfect.\n\n132\n00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.790\nWe've installed the new voice command\nmodule here at ITProTV and we're testing\n\n133\n00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.250\nit out today but it's working very well so\nfar, we're very happy about that.\n\n134\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.880\nAnd we're gonna continue with\nthat particular thought process.\n\n135\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.970\nSo, where I am, and let me just zoom in,\nso we can see that.\n\n136\n00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.710\nWe always start out showing\nyou where we are, so\n\n137\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.030\nyou have a sense of how to navigate.\n\n138\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.320\nWe're the administration workspace there.\n\n139\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.600\nI've gone ahead and\nI've highlighted the servers and\n\n140\n00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.240\nsite system roles as we've been\ndoing in most of our demonstrations.\n\n141\n00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.990\nWe have our primary site\nserver sitting up there.\n\n142\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.150\nWe do see our roles that are already\nconfigured and installed.\n\n143\n00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.240\nBut what is not on that list is\nthe software update point, and so\n\n144\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.070\nwe're gonna go in and configure that.\n\n145\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.270\nWe're gonna run the install role wizard\nand we've seen this run several times.\n\n146\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.250\nWe're gonna choose the software update\npoint off there, run through some\n\n147\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.400\nof the configuration steps, and that way\nwe can get this role up and running.\n\n148\n00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.220\nNow, one of the prior steps that would\ntake place before we actually go ahead and\n\n149\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.590\ndo this, and this is critical, you do\nneed to know that this has to happen.\n\n150\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.280\nIs that you have to have a WSUS server\nsetup and configured, as I mentioned,\n\n151\n00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.110\nsomewhere in your network.\n\n152\n00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.430\nIt does not have to be and\nit should not be on this same machine,\n\n153\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.750\non the site server.\n\n154\n00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.595\nDon't necessarily want it installed here.\n\n155\n00:07:52.595 --> 00:07:55.637\nIt could be, but it doesn't have to be,\nlet me just put it that way.\n\n156\n00:07:55.637 --> 00:07:59.423\nLot of times we will build out\na WSUS server somewhere else.\n\n157\n00:07:59.423 --> 00:08:02.186\nEither have one up and running already, or\n\n158\n00:08:02.186 --> 00:08:07.406\nperhaps have one sitting in the DMZ to do\nthe downloads into a semi-secure area,\n\n159\n00:08:07.406 --> 00:08:11.966\nand then move those back behind\nthe firewall so that we can stage them.\n\n160\n00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:15.417\nThere's different architectural\nelements that we may engage in and\n\n161\n00:08:15.417 --> 00:08:17.490\nchoose from a design perspective.\n\n162\n00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.350\nIt really just depends on\nwhat our thought process is.\n\n163\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:26.840\nSo you just want to think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n164\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.660\nWe normally, in most of these situations,\nwill be able to leverage\n\n165\n00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.910\nan existing WSUS server, cuz you probably\nalready have one in place is my point.\n\n166\n00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.550\nIf you don't, then obviously you're gonna\nwanna go ahead and build one out, and\n\n167\n00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:42.510\nset it up.\n\n168\n00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.890\nSo just keep that in mind and\nremember that, right?\n\n169\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.770\nAnd as we said, we're not gonna go through\nthe process of actually had to do that,\n\n170\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.220\nbut Mike will go out on the web in a few\nminutes when we jump back into the hay.\n\n171\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.920\nLet's kill some time portion of our\nprogram, while we're cooking and\n\n172\n00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.930\nwe will actually then take you out, show\nyou some of the tech net real estate where\n\n173\n00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.140\nyou can learn How to build out WSUS\nin case you're not familiar with it.\n\n174\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.810\nNever want to assume that you know,\n\n175\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.640\nwe always wanna make sure you\nare prepared to do it just in case.\n\n176\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.030\n>> Right.\n>> You wanted to say something, Mike.\n\n177\n00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.940\n>> Yeah I was gonna ask you now when you\nsay that we need a WSUS server does it\n\n178\n00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.230\nhave to be configured and\nalready synchronized and all of that or\n\n179\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.390\ncan we just set it up, install and\nget it ready, just has to be there?\n\n180\n00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.640\n>> Just has to be there and\nthat's actually a really good point,\n\n181\n00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.640\nbecause what I've done on the back end is\nsimply to install the WSUS feature, and\n\n182\n00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.728\nset it up, or the role rather, and\n\n183\n00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:33.520\n.NET Framework 3.5 support the goods\nwith it, and then left it.\n\n184\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.160\nI ran the post config of run now to\ndo the basic configuration wizard,\n\n185\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.600\nbut then I did not actually go through and\n\n186\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.090\nrun the WSUS configuration\nwizard that comes up after that.\n\n187\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.090\nIt's a multi-step process.\n\n188\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:51.020\nWe cancel out of that WSUS configuration\nwizard and just leave WSUS installed,\n\n189\n00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.810\nbecause we don't need to have\nWSUS necessarily fully cooking.\n\n190\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.540\nWe just need to have the role available so\nwe can leverage it to go out and\n\n191\n00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.170\ndownload and create a catalog.\n\n192\n00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.970\nNow what normally happens quite honestly,\nis that you've probably got WSUS\n\n193\n00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.310\nalready configured and running, because\nyou've been doing patch management,\n\n194\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.520\nyou've been doing it with WSUS\nmost likely for some time, and\n\n195\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.460\nshame on you by the way\nif you're not doing that.\n\n196\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.320\nYou better stop listening to me right now\nand go out and fix that problem, if you're\n\n197\n00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.480\nnot doing patch management, cuz you're\ngoing to have major security concerns.\n\n198\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.440\nBut assuming you are, because we assume\nlogically that you understand the value of\n\n199\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.630\ndoing this and that you should be\ndoing it, we normally will assume, and\n\n200\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.410\nindeed we normally will find when I go\nout and consult with clients we got, and\n\n201\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.770\nwe talk to clients about this, hey,\nthis is a cool thing we gotta do this.\n\n202\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.460\nWhat do we need to do?\n\n203\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.440\nWe heard we can integrate it,\nwhat do we do?\n\n204\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.490\nWe're kind of doing something already,\ncan we leverage what we're doing?\n\n205\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.990\nWe normally find that almost without\nexception all of our clients, and indeed\n\n206\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.930\nalmost all of my students are already\nusing WSUS, even if you're not using SCCM,\n\n207\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:54.840\neven if they are using SCCM but haven't\nintegrated the software update points yet,\n\n208\n00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.730\nthey've gone ahead and they already have\nWSUS running, so it's probably configured.\n\n209\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.930\nWe probably have a catalog\nalready built out of updates.\n\n210\n00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.500\nWe're probably synchronizing.\n\n211\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.070\nSo we'll just leverage that already, but\nif we don't if we're just doing this all\n\n212\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.330\nbrand new, that will install WSUS,\nwill set up the role.\n\n213\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.450\nWe won't bother to configure WSUS,\n\n214\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.260\nbecause the software update point\nis now gonna basically go out and\n\n215\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.475\ndrive that synchronization through us for\nWSUS, build up the catalog, and\n\n216\n00:11:20.475 --> 00:11:24.695\nall the management of software updates now\ntakes place through SCCM on the console.\n\n217\n00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:27.865\nWe don't bother to go to WSUS and\nset up our update groups,\n\n218\n00:11:27.865 --> 00:11:31.045\nand go ahead and\nfigure out how to preload our updates, and\n\n219\n00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:34.355\nfigure out which ones we want to push,\nall that's now done and it is all done.\n\n220\n00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:37.085\nBut it's all done through SCCM,\nthrough the console.\n\n221\n00:11:37.085 --> 00:11:40.815\nSo in that respect chances are good, we\nwon't have to do anything else with WSUS.\n\n222\n00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:43.870\nWe'll just assume it's there,we'll\ncheck of course, but know it's there.\n\n223\n00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.500\nAnd once we get it up and\nrunning, we're good.\n\n224\n00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.210\nWe then just go ahead and\ncontinue on with what we're doing here.\n\n225\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.990\nSo, what you'll see on the screen in front\nof you now is, I've just zoomed in, and\n\n226\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.690\nI've gone ahead and just shown you.\n\n227\n00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.540\nI skipped through the first couple\nof screens on the update wizard, or\n\n228\n00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.640\non the server role install wizard, rather.\n\n229\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.960\nAnd instead what we've done.\n\n230\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.210\nDo I have to make the signal?\n\n231\n00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.160\nLet me make the signal.\n\n232\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.610\n>> Okay oh there we go, I was gonna say.\n\n233\n00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.260\n>> The voice, the voice control\nsometimes is still not 100%,\n\n234\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.790\nwe're working out the kinks on that one.\n\n235\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.920\nSo I have my standby\nsignal ready just in case.\n\n236\n00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.490\nRemember you saw that in one of\nthe prior episodes where I wink at you,\n\n237\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.405\nthen I go like well, you can't see me\ngoing like this, but I go like this.\n\n238\n00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:23.960\nand so that way you can see it.\n\n239\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.150\nAll right, so what we're seeing\nis just I zoomed back in, and\n\n240\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.480\nI've just shown you that we're\non the role selector screen.\n\n241\n00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.370\nAnd we're gonna choose down there at\nthe bottom there software update point.\n\n242\n00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.550\nSo we're gonna zoom out so\nyou can see that.\n\n243\n00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.450\nAnd I'm gonna put a check mark in\nthe software update point and select that.\n\n244\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:46.590\nAnd once I do that, you'll notice\nnow that I've got all these things\n\n245\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.800\nthat I have to go in and set up, and\nyou'll see Synchronization Source as we\n\n246\n00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.070\nwere just talking about, Synchronization\nSchedule, Supersedence Rules,\n\n247\n00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.735\nClassification, Products,\nthis is all the WSUS bells and whistles.\n\n248\n00:12:58.735 --> 00:13:00.430\nNow we're Bringing it all in.\n\n249\n00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.780\nIt's effectively WSUS,\njust WSUS literally with the overlay of\n\n250\n00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.410\nthe SCCM console to allow us to\nconfigure and manage all in one place.\n\n251\n00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.320\n>> Fair enough.\n>> That's essentially\n\n252\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.040\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n253\n00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.701\nI'm glad you like it.\n\n254\n00:13:10.701 --> 00:13:12.126\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I worked on this all night.\n\n255\n00:13:12.126 --> 00:13:13.410\nI was a little concerned, you know?\n\n256\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's one\n\n257\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.039\nof those things you either like or\nyou hate.\n\n258\n00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:18.182\nThere's no in-between.\n\n259\n00:13:18.182 --> 00:13:22.265\nAnd I I lost sleep over this actually,\nMike, I was very concerned.\n\n260\n00:13:22.265 --> 00:13:24.365\nBut the fact that you've affirmed for\n\n261\n00:13:24.365 --> 00:13:26.715\nme that you like it has just\nmade it all worthwhile.\n\n262\n00:13:26.715 --> 00:13:27.587\n>> I'm glad.\n\n263\n00:13:27.587 --> 00:13:29.845\n>> All right, so\nwe'll stop being silly and\n\n264\n00:13:29.845 --> 00:13:33.048\njust continue on with the business\nwe that we are here to conduct.\n\n265\n00:13:33.048 --> 00:13:34.887\nAll right, so what you'll see now,\n\n266\n00:13:34.887 --> 00:13:38.455\nand let me just kind of move down and\nas we zoom in we can see this,\n\n267\n00:13:38.455 --> 00:13:42.375\nwe are on the first of these configuration\nareas, software update point.\n\n268\n00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:46.240\nRight, software update point integrates\nWSUS to provide software updates\n\n269\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.460\nto configuration manager clients.\n\n270\n00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.540\nYou'll see here the little warning.\n\n271\n00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.910\nSays for config manager to use a software\nupdate point that is not installed on\n\n272\n00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:01.500\nthe site server, you must first install\nthe WSUS admin console on the site server.\n\n273\n00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.430\nSo we wanna know that we may\nwanna use the WSUS admin console\n\n274\n00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:10.160\nif the software update point is not\ngoing to be available directly here.\n\n275\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.240\nIn other words, it's not installed on the\nsite's server, right, then we want to know\n\n276\n00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.380\nthat we need the WSUS admin console so\nthat we can have SCCM integrate that.\n\n277\n00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.815\nSo it's right there for you as you\ndo the wizard, you'll just wanna,\n\n278\n00:14:21.815 --> 00:14:25.625\nas we've always told you to do and\nwe encourage you to do, stop and\n\n279\n00:14:25.625 --> 00:14:28.575\npay attention as you're\ndoing these installs.\n\n280\n00:14:28.575 --> 00:14:30.075\nReally important to read and\n\n281\n00:14:30.075 --> 00:14:33.082\nto understand what you're\nseeing in these config screens.\n\n282\n00:14:33.082 --> 00:14:35.212\nIt's helpful to get it\nright the first time.\n\n283\n00:14:35.212 --> 00:14:39.552\nIt's also really important from\na exam preparation perspective.\n\n284\n00:14:39.552 --> 00:14:41.382\nThese are little nooks and crannies,\n\n285\n00:14:41.382 --> 00:14:45.422\nright, that we tend to pull\ninformation out of to test on, and\n\n286\n00:14:45.422 --> 00:14:48.722\nit's those kind of things that, if you pay\nattention to, you're actually then gonna\n\n287\n00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:52.972\nbe a lot better situated to be successful\nout of the gate the first time.\n\n288\n00:14:52.972 --> 00:14:54.002\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n289\n00:14:54.002 --> 00:14:57.820\nAnd this is so cool, I can actually\ndo my sign in case my backup,\n\n290\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.860\nin case voice control does not work.\n\n291\n00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.040\nSo remember, my sign to go\nback out of screen-to-screen,\n\n292\n00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.180\nand go right to the console,\nis gonna be this.\n\n293\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.200\nIt's gonna be this, and I'm gonna do this.\n\n294\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.860\nAnd when I do that, see that?\n\n295\n00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.360\nLook at that, you always need\na backup just in case, right?\n\n296\n00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.500\nAll right, so\nyou can see WSUS is configured by default.\n\n297\n00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.010\nAnd, as you can see,\nour default selection is, use port 80 and\n\n298\n00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.910\n443 for client communications there.\n\n299\n00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.210\nDefault settings for WSUS 3.0 SP2.\n\n300\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.610\nNow this brings up\nan interesting option for us.\n\n301\n00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.955\nWe'll come back to this when we do\nour talk with Mike later and we'll\n\n302\n00:15:33.955 --> 00:15:38.075\nsee this document, and we have this in our\nlittle hit list for you of things to know.\n\n303\n00:15:38.075 --> 00:15:41.651\nYou have different versions of WSUS,\ndepending on when you built WSUS.\n\n304\n00:15:41.651 --> 00:15:46.223\nWSUS 3.0 SP2 is gonna be old school,\nand if you're doing old school,\n\n305\n00:15:46.223 --> 00:15:48.233\nwe do port 80 and port 443.\n\n306\n00:15:48.233 --> 00:15:51.750\nWSUS on Windows, it rolls out there.\n\n307\n00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.233\nServer 12 is ports 8530 and 8531.\n\n308\n00:15:56.233 --> 00:15:59.581\nSo depending on what version\nof WSUS you're running,\n\n309\n00:15:59.581 --> 00:16:03.320\nreally what that depends on is\nwhat OS WSUS is installed on.\n\n310\n00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:09.559\nIf it's on Server 08R2,\nyou're gonna be doing port 80 and 443.\n\n311\n00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:16.372\nIf you've moved your WSUS infrastructure\nto 12 or 12R2, you're on 8530, 8531.\n\n312\n00:16:16.372 --> 00:16:19.683\nSo you need to understand that and make\nsure that you're aware of that cuz you've\n\n313\n00:16:19.683 --> 00:16:22.550\ngotta make the right choice here or\nthings will not work.\n\n314\n00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:27.400\nThat is important and and require SSL\ncommunication to the WSUS server to\n\n315\n00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.350\nthe check off option to enforce\nthe use of SSL to secure port,\n\n316\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.380\nregardless of how we set this up,\nwhatever that port map will be.\n\n317\n00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.840\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n318\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.220\nWe'll make our appropriate\nchoice here in just a minute.\n\n319\n00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.450\nClient connection types.\n\n320\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.050\nAllow intranet-only client connection.\n\n321\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.880\nAllow Internet-only client connection.\n\n322\n00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.005\nAllow both.\n\n323\n00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:50.195\nIntranet-only is behind the firewall,\nright?\n\n324\n00:16:50.195 --> 00:16:53.280\nInternet-only is outside the firewall.\n\n325\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.660\nInternet and intranet is both.\n\n326\n00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.270\nWe have to decide if we have Internet\nbased clients and intranet based clients.\n\n327\n00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.180\nWe always will have\nintranet based clients.\n\n328\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.162\nThe question is whether we have external\nclients that we wanna be able to\n\n329\n00:17:05.162 --> 00:17:08.530\npatch manage as well, we may have to\nmake the appropriate choice here.\n\n330\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.639\nSo I just wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout those things and we see them,\n\n331\n00:17:11.639 --> 00:17:12.572\nwe know what they are.\n\n332\n00:17:12.572 --> 00:17:15.655\nCuz obviously making the right\nchoices here is going to be very\n\n333\n00:17:15.655 --> 00:17:16.815\nimportant, rightt?\n\n334\n00:17:16.815 --> 00:17:17.320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n335\n00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.900\n>> All right, so just be aware of that.\n\n336\n00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.910\nOh, and you know what, actually,\nI made a mistake here,\n\n337\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.430\njust let me go back two screens.\n\n338\n00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.880\nI forgot on this particular lab,\nI didn't make a mistake,\n\n339\n00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.620\nI just forgot to put a setting in.\n\n340\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.970\nWe never use proxies, normally,\nbut on this particular lab,\n\n341\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.750\nbecause of the configuration to go out and\nactually set up the download,\n\n342\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.570\nwe actually need to put a proxy\nin on this particular one.\n\n343\n00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.180\nSo let me just go ahead and\ndo that real quick.\n\n344\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.180\nBecause for our lab environment,\nwe have the need to have a proxy.\n\n345\n00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.480\nSo let me just put that in cuz I'm so\nused to never using the proxy.\n\n346\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.040\nI totally forgot about it.\n\n347\n00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.070\nSo we're just setting this one up.\n\n348\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.980\nYou guys don't have to worry about this\nscreen cuz this is only pertinent if you\n\n349\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.200\nactually need a proxy.\n\n350\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.480\nIf you do in the real world,\nyou would figure out what that is and\n\n351\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.640\nset that up yourself.\n\n352\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.180\nIf you don't, you'll just blow\nright past it the way we did and\n\n353\n00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.480\nsimply not worry about it.\n\n354\n00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.080\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and hit Next\nthere to make sure we get that in there\n\n355\n00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.775\nand then go back to the software\nupdate point where we were.\n\n356\n00:18:11.775 --> 00:18:14.055\nAnd now what we're gonna\ndo is the following.\n\n357\n00:18:14.055 --> 00:18:17.245\nWe are gonna go ahead and make sure\nthat we change that to Server 12.\n\n358\n00:18:17.245 --> 00:18:21.497\nSo port 8530, 8531,\ncuz that's where we're hosting.\n\n359\n00:18:21.497 --> 00:18:23.357\nAnd to make sure that\nwe have that selected.\n\n360\n00:18:23.357 --> 00:18:26.307\nNow we're going to leave that\nat intranet-only clients cuz\n\n361\n00:18:26.307 --> 00:18:29.237\nwe're not dealing with anything on\nthe Internet in the demo environment.\n\n362\n00:18:29.237 --> 00:18:29.977\nBut in the real world,\n\n363\n00:18:29.977 --> 00:18:32.577\nyou would most likely want to make sure\nyou make the appropriate choice and\n\n364\n00:18:32.577 --> 00:18:33.487\nmaybe change that there.\n\n365\n00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.488\nSo, just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n366\n00:18:35.488 --> 00:18:38.388\nThe next screen is proxy and\naccount settings.\n\n367\n00:18:38.388 --> 00:18:41.928\nSo we just want to make sure that we\nknow what the account settings will be.\n\n368\n00:18:41.928 --> 00:18:45.568\nHere we're gonna use a proxy\nserver when synchronizing updates.\n\n369\n00:18:45.568 --> 00:18:47.879\nLet me just scroll in so you can see this.\n\n370\n00:18:47.879 --> 00:18:51.687\nAgain this will depend on how you\nare setting up in your world.\n\n371\n00:18:51.687 --> 00:18:55.467\nWhen we use the proxy server for software\nupdates, we have to obviously configure\n\n372\n00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:58.111\ncertain settings so\nwe're gonna want to make sure here.\n\n373\n00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:01.718\nUse a proxy server when synchronizing and\nthen also use a proxy server when\n\n374\n00:19:01.718 --> 00:19:04.909\ndownloading content by using\nautomatic deployment rules.\n\n375\n00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:07.430\nWe'll talk about automatic deployment\nrules a little bit later on.\n\n376\n00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.163\nWe'll set those up and\nat least take a look at what they are, but\n\n377\n00:19:10.163 --> 00:19:12.070\nwe're just gonna want\nto take note of that,\n\n378\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.830\nhere we're gonna use the proxy\nserver when doing the updates.\n\n379\n00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.556\nWe're gonna use the proxy server\nwhen downloading using automatic\n\n380\n00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:18.620\ndeployment rules.\n\n381\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.280\nWe're also gonna use credentials to\nconnect to the WSUS server here and\n\n382\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.770\nprovide what those are.\n\n383\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:24.530\nWe'll set those up.\n\n384\n00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.010\nThose will be synched to our domain\nadmin account, so we'll set that up now.\n\n385\n00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.230\nRemember we've talked about this while\nI'm checking off boxes and doing this.\n\n386\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.350\nWe've talked about this in the real world,\nand remember in the real world,\n\n387\n00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.885\nwe wanna make sure that we don't\nuse the domain admin account.\n\n388\n00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.950\nWe've talked about that and\nwhy that is such a bad idea.\n\n389\n00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.300\nSo let me just check these boxes off here.\n\n390\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.070\nGo ahead and specify that.\n\n391\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.860\nLet's just pull set there, and\nlet's put in a new account.\n\n392\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:53.100\nAnd then what we're gonna\ndo is the following.\n\n393\n00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.790\nPut in our domain, there we go.\n\n394\n00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.820\nOur domain admin.\n\n395\n00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.377\nSo we just go ahead and browse,\nand get that in there, and\n\n396\n00:19:59.377 --> 00:20:02.509\nyou've seen me do this\nin other demonstrations.\n\n397\n00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:05.375\nThat's why we're not going to\nbother to zoom in and show this.\n\n398\n00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:08.615\nWe're just gonna do this for you,\nreal quickly and get it set up in there.\n\n399\n00:20:08.615 --> 00:20:10.737\nHowever, I am gonna make sure\nwe put the right password in.\n\n400\n00:20:10.737 --> 00:20:13.471\n>> Good. [LAUGH] >> Because, the good\nnews is, they've changed the password yet\n\n401\n00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:14.770\nagain in the lab environment.\n\n402\n00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.680\nSo it's now back to the original password,\nlower case,\n\n403\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.710\ninstead of that upper password one\nthat we had to do in that one episode,\n\n404\n00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.570\nwhere I put in the wrong one,\nand we had to go back and fix it.\n\n405\n00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:25.630\nSo we are gonna do that.\n\n406\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.260\nWe are gonna verify real quick,\nand just take a look here, or\n\n407\n00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.360\nat least show you verification just\nto show you what's going on in here.\n\n408\n00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:39.090\nSo the idea is that we can go in and\nwe can verify our connection out, right?\n\n409\n00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.890\nAnd if we do that, let me just get rid\nof that, just zoom in and show you.\n\n410\n00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.840\nWe would obviously have to make sure\nwe have the appropriate proxy server\n\n411\n00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.730\nname in there.\n\n412\n00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.968\nNow, microsoft.com's not\nthe name of our proxy but\n\n413\n00:20:50.968 --> 00:20:53.067\nI'm just showing you what\nthe settings would be.\n\n414\n00:20:53.067 --> 00:20:55.382\nWe would specify whatever\nthe settings are and\n\n415\n00:20:55.382 --> 00:20:57.825\nthen test our connection accordingly,\nright?\n\n416\n00:20:57.825 --> 00:21:00.165\nWe'd have to put in our proxy server.\n\n417\n00:21:00.165 --> 00:21:03.135\nWhatever the name of the proxy server\nwould be and then test the connection.\n\n418\n00:21:03.135 --> 00:21:04.155\nWe're not gonna bother with that.\n\n419\n00:21:04.155 --> 00:21:05.195\nWe know it's working.\n\n420\n00:21:05.195 --> 00:21:07.315\nWe just wanna show you that that's there.\n\n421\n00:21:07.315 --> 00:21:11.226\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click OK.\n\n422\n00:21:11.226 --> 00:21:12.918\nAnd set that up.\n\n423\n00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:15.157\nAll right, so let's just go there.\n\n424\n00:21:15.157 --> 00:21:18.339\nLet's go hit Next and\nthen we're go ahead and\n\n425\n00:21:18.339 --> 00:21:21.540\nget the synchronization source page there.\n\n426\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.058\nWe just zoom in so\nyou can see what those are and\n\n427\n00:21:24.058 --> 00:21:28.388\nscroll down here a little bit just so\nthat we can keep everything in the frame.\n\n428\n00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:31.360\nDo a little refresh on our timer there,\nsurreptitiously, yet\n\n429\n00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.970\nanother good vocabulary word behind\nthe scenes while we're doing that.\n\n430\n00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.093\n>> We're up to like a dozen now.\n\n431\n00:21:36.093 --> 00:21:36.893\n>> We are.\n\n432\n00:21:36.893 --> 00:21:38.220\n>> I like it.\n\n433\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.420\n>> All right, so\nselect the synchronization source for\n\n434\n00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.690\nthe software update point.\n\n435\n00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.660\nThe default is Synchronize\nwith Microsoft or\n\n436\n00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.560\nfrom Microsoft Update, that's\nthe standard, that makes the most sense.\n\n437\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.270\nThat's where we're gonna get\nthe live updates from, but\n\n438\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:56.070\nI did mention that we may actually have\na WSUS Server set up somewhere in a DMZ or\n\n439\n00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.380\nsomewhere in our network that's\ndoing the actual download directly.\n\n440\n00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.400\nAnd that becomes our distribution point.\n\n441\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.730\nAnd then we synchronize from there.\n\n442\n00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.830\nThere's different\narchitectures that we can use.\n\n443\n00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.250\nIt really just depends, ultimately,\n\n444\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.600\non how the security architecture has\nbeen implemented across the enterprise.\n\n445\n00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.960\nAnd based on the existing\npatch management topology,\n\n446\n00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.905\nif you're not in charge of it but you have\nto go out and kinda figure it out, you\n\n447\n00:22:18.905 --> 00:22:22.890\nneed to talk to the network administrators\nthat are in charge of that aspect of it.\n\n448\n00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:27.250\nAnd find out whether the existing SUSS\nservers are gonna be set up as your\n\n449\n00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:32.180\nprimary distribution points for\nthe distribution of patches internally.\n\n450\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.010\nSo they are effectively\ndoing multi-stage downloads.\n\n451\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.420\nWe download into the DMZ,\n\n452\n00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.090\nwe then from there synchronize back behind\nthe firewall, clean up those updates and\n\n453\n00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.250\ngrab them from a central source, or we go\nright out to Microsoft and download them.\n\n454\n00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:49.270\nWhat may not,\nlet me try this in a different way so\n\n455\n00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.080\nI can say this in a way that makes sense.\n\n456\n00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.390\nWhat is most likely driving this\ndetermination is whether or\n\n457\n00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.080\nnot you have multiple download servers.\n\n458\n00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.832\nAnd if you have a need for multiple\ndownload servers based on geography.\n\n459\n00:23:01.832 --> 00:23:05.961\nIf you do, what we typically want to try\nto do is conserve bandwidth instead of\n\n460\n00:23:05.961 --> 00:23:10.805\nhaving to download 20 versions of the same\nupdate across different servers 20 times.\n\n461\n00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:15.259\nAnd then have 20 outgoing connections\nbringing in gigabytes of downloads in\n\n462\n00:23:15.259 --> 00:23:18.371\norder to synchronize initially and\ncreate catalogs.\n\n463\n00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:22.091\nWhat we want to do is probably have one\ncentral server and then from there,\n\n464\n00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:25.394\nI'll bring that in and\nthen synchronize that behind the scenes.\n\n465\n00:23:25.394 --> 00:23:28.927\nBecause it becomes a lot easier to manage\nthat because now that bandwidths being\n\n466\n00:23:28.927 --> 00:23:32.301\nconsumed on the LAN, not through\nthe LAN/WAN interface which is then gonna\n\n467\n00:23:32.301 --> 00:23:34.340\nultimately get in the way\nof other traffic.\n\n468\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.170\nSo we just wanna think about that.\n\n469\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.402\nBe aware of that.\n\n470\n00:23:37.402 --> 00:23:40.830\nThat's gonna be a discussion that takes\nplace outside the context of this\n\n471\n00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.180\nenvironment, cuz that's\nalready been decided on.\n\n472\n00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.180\nYou just have to effectively mirror\nwhat's happening in the real world and\n\n473\n00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.902\nfigure that out.\n\n474\n00:23:46.902 --> 00:23:50.231\nSo, just know that, but\nthat's why we have different options here.\n\n475\n00:23:50.231 --> 00:23:52.065\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna go back to the screen there.\n\n476\n00:23:52.065 --> 00:23:55.217\nAnd what you'll see is we can synchronize\ndata from that upstream source,\n\n477\n00:23:55.217 --> 00:23:57.850\nthat would be whatever\nexisting SUSS server is there.\n\n478\n00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.840\nNotice, we, not we, but\nMicrosoft, rather I should say,\n\n479\n00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.590\nhas gone to the trouble of giving you\nan example URL using both the older,\n\n480\n00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:11.050\nprior server 2012 and the newer\nserver 2012 port designations here.\n\n481\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.530\nSo it's nice that they've shown you that.\n\n482\n00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.740\nI would try to call out\nthe things that they do right,\n\n483\n00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.990\ncuz we love calling out\nthe things that they do wrong.\n\n484\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.150\nSo, we wanna make sure we give them credit\nwhere they've done something that actually\n\n485\n00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.250\nmakes a lot of sense.\n\n486\n00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.800\nAnd in this case, they give us\nthe reminders to what we need.\n\n487\n00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.260\nAnd then, if we are not gonna actually\nset synchronization up right now, but\n\n488\n00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.970\nrather just wanna go ahead,\nbuild out the functionality, and\n\n489\n00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.620\nthen build the catalog at a later date.\n\n490\n00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.750\nWe may choose to do that\nfrom a timing prospective,\n\n491\n00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.730\nfrom a performance prospective.\n\n492\n00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.360\nWe may not be able to\nkick off synchronization\n\n493\n00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.070\ndue to bandwidth issues\nduring the business day.\n\n494\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.530\nWe may have to do that during\na maintenance window at night.\n\n495\n00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.680\nSo, we have the option to opt out and\nthen go back and do this later.\n\n496\n00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.050\nNot opt out of the config, but simply opt\nout of this synchronization of the catalog\n\n497\n00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.530\neven though we're gonna set up and\ninstantiate.\n\n498\n00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.530\nAnother good one, instantiate.\n\n499\n00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.440\nThat's a cool one to through out there.\n\n500\n00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.670\nPeople look at you like you're\nauthoritative when you say words\n\n501\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.180\nlike that.\n\n502\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:08.172\nWe're not going to instantiate or actually\ngo through and configure the entire role,\n\n503\n00:25:08.172 --> 00:25:11.660\nbut rather configure and\nset up the software update point but\n\n504\n00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.730\nnot synchronize right now and\ncome back and do that as a secondary step.\n\n505\n00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.270\nSo we have options here,\nit'll be up to us.\n\n506\n00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.470\nSo we're gonna go ahead and leave that\nat synchronize with Microsoft update.\n\n507\n00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.070\nWe'll leave the defaults in place,\nin other words.\n\n508\n00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:29.650\nAnd then, we're going to go ahead,\njust hit next.\n\n509\n00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.386\nAnd then, on synchronization schedule\nwe can go ahead, and we will.\n\n510\n00:25:33.386 --> 00:25:36.430\nAnd I'll show you this, how to\nenable the synchronization schedule.\n\n511\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.660\nBecause if we don't,\nthen we're not synchronizing.\n\n512\n00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.356\n>> Right.\n\n513\n00:25:39.356 --> 00:25:41.494\n>> Which is one of those things that,\nobviously,\n\n514\n00:25:41.494 --> 00:25:43.262\nis gonna be very important for us to do.\n\n515\n00:25:43.262 --> 00:25:46.740\nSo I'm just gonna put check mark\nin the box before I zoom in.\n\n516\n00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:51.560\nAnd then, show you that our magic\nnumber still holds true there, right?\n\n517\n00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.240\nSo you'll see, enables synchronization.\n\n518\n00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.180\nAnd then, the default simple\nschedule is once every seven days.\n\n519\n00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.130\nBut, of course, we can customize that.\n\n520\n00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:02.180\nNow, keep in mind, cuz there's kind of\na debate that goes on a lot of the times\n\n521\n00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.930\nwhen I do this with customers or I talk\nabout this in classes with students.\n\n522\n00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.390\nEverybody says, well,\nshouldn't we actually be more aggressive?\n\n523\n00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.460\nShouldn't we be checking for\nupdates every day?\n\n524\n00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.110\nRight?\n\n525\n00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:17.180\nBut the reality is that, while in prior\nyears, before Microsoft really went to,\n\n526\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.420\nalmost without exception, for the most\npart to a fixed schedule for updates,\n\n527\n00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.345\nwe commonly and\nlovingly refer to that as Patch Tuesday.\n\n528\n00:26:24.345 --> 00:26:24.850\nRight?\n\n529\n00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.160\nSo if you are aware,\nand hopefully you are,\n\n530\n00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.520\nof the fact that Microsoft's committed\nto a once-monthly release schedule for\n\n531\n00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.750\npatches, as most vendors have unless\nthere's a catastrophic issue, we\n\n532\n00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.500\ncall an out of band or out of cycle patch\nthat's released because of an emergency.\n\n533\n00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.830\nAnd if that's the case, then, yeah,\nyou're gonna probably have to go out and\n\n534\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.875\nmanually sync in order to figure\nout that that patch is out there,\n\n535\n00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:48.250\ncuz it may come out, and it may be some\ntime outside that seven day cycle.\n\n536\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.930\nBut the reality is, normally,\nunless things go horribly, horribly wrong\n\n537\n00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.820\nsomewhere, and while that happens,\nit doesn't happen very often at all.\n\n538\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.000\nYou can probably count on less than one\nhand the number of times that may happen\n\n539\n00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.210\nover the course of a year.\n\n540\n00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:02.740\nAnd I'm not kidding when I\nsay something like this.\n\n541\n00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.890\nI'm being very serious.\n\n542\n00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.870\nRight?\nThe majority of patches that Microsoft\n\n543\n00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.610\nputs out are put out on\nthat once a month cycle.\n\n544\n00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.050\nThere may be 30 or 40 of them that\ncome out across a given cycle\n\n545\n00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.085\nbecause of all the different\nproducts that are patching.\n\n546\n00:27:14.085 --> 00:27:16.770\nBut the reality is,\nif we know that we're patching,\n\n547\n00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.500\nor be able to download new\npatches once every thirty days,\n\n548\n00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.390\napproximately, then checking every week\njust to catch up on something that may\n\n549\n00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.990\nhave come up out of cycle\nmakes a lot of sense.\n\n550\n00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.690\nChecking every day doesn't, because we're\njust generating a lot of traffic that\n\n551\n00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.950\nreally probably 99% of the time gonna\ncome back negative and say, well,\n\n552\n00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.090\nthere's nothing new.\n\n553\n00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.990\nSo, we don't need to be that aggressive.\n\n554\n00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.845\nJust want to point that out.\n\n555\n00:27:37.845 --> 00:27:40.720\nCuz a lot of people think,\noh I got to go out there, got\n\n556\n00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.270\nto really make sure I'm checking everyday\nto make sure I get the security things and\n\n557\n00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.321\nmake sure I have them all.\n\n558\n00:27:45.321 --> 00:27:47.940\nAnd the reality is once\nevery seven days is fine.\n\n559\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.830\nI actually tell customers to probably\nof that out to every 14 days.\n\n560\n00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.980\nAnd the reality is as long as you're\npaying attention to out of patch or\n\n561\n00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.220\nout of cycle patches that do come out,\nand if you have to,\n\n562\n00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.150\nyou go out and manually sync to grab them,\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n563\n00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.070\nPush that boundary out a little bit and\nyou're perfectly fine as well.\n\n564\n00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.830\nSo, that's up to you.\n\n565\n00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:05.660\nJust keep that mind.\n\n566\n00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.990\nSo, we're gonna zoom out here.\n\n567\n00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:08.570\nGonna go back.\n\n568\n00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.370\nGonna leave that at every seven days.\n\n569\n00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:16.210\nAnd we are going to go ahead and hit Next.\n\n570\n00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.360\nThere we go.\n\n571\n00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.330\nAnd then,\nwhat we're gonna do is the following.\n\n572\n00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.280\nWe have our supersedence rules page here.\n\n573\n00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.330\nLet's just zoom in so you can see that.\n\n574\n00:28:28.447 --> 00:28:32.717\nAnd what supersedence does, and I'll\nkind of scroll over so you can see this,\n\n575\n00:28:32.717 --> 00:28:36.550\nwe configure a software update to\nexpire as soon as it has superseded.\n\n576\n00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.500\nOr in other words,\nanother update has come out that says,\n\n577\n00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.980\nhey, now I'm the update\nthat takes care of this.\n\n578\n00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.210\nYou're no longer needed.\n\n579\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.340\nRight?\nGet out of here.\n\n580\n00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.140\nRight?\nWe don't want you here anymore.\n\n581\n00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.280\nSo, what we're doing is configuring\nthis idea that supersedents\n\n582\n00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.735\nshould be allowed to automatically expire\nupdates when new updates are pushed\n\n583\n00:28:53.735 --> 00:28:55.500\nup by Microsoft that replace old ones.\n\n584\n00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.560\nIn effect, and this makes a lot of sense.\n\n585\n00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.160\nRight?\n\n586\n00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.760\nSo, as a result of that,\nyou'll see here we have some options.\n\n587\n00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.450\nImmediately expire\na superseded software update.\n\n588\n00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.580\nDo not expire a superseded software update\nuntil the software update is superseded\n\n589\n00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.910\nfor a specified period of time,\nwhatever that is.\n\n590\n00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.070\nPeriod of time is in so\nmany months by the way, just to note that.\n\n591\n00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.440\nNot days, but months.\n\n592\n00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.380\nOne of those things.\n\n593\n00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.510\nSo you go ahead and you put three\nover there thinking,okay, three days.\n\n594\n00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.680\nAnd, no, it's really 90 days, right?\n\n595\n00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.890\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n596\n00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.550\nSo what we have to decide\nis how long we wanna wait.\n\n597\n00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:33.440\nNow, you'll notice the default behavior\nhere is that we will not expire\n\n598\n00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:38.080\nthe superseded software update\nimmediately, but rather wait three months.\n\n599\n00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.120\nNow, the reason for\n\n600\n00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.720\nthis is what can happen sometimes\nis that patches are put out,\n\n601\n00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.390\nthey run their normal life, then Microsoft\nputs out another patch or any vendor.\n\n602\n00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.120\nMicrosoft or any vendor puts out\nanother patch, and says, okay,\n\n603\n00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.020\nwe're superseding that patch.\n\n604\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.990\nBut the problem is, number one,\nyou may have that patch\n\n605\n00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.700\nalready deployed across part of your\ninfrastructure, but not all of it.\n\n606\n00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.190\nYou may also have that patch\ndeployed to most, if not all,\n\n607\n00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:07.300\nthe infrastructure but be looking\nto bring some new machines online.\n\n608\n00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.350\nIt may be in your built in images, so\n\n609\n00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.370\nyou may already have the patch\nin different places and\n\n610\n00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:15.040\nhave to work through the logic of whether\nyou are gonna continue using it or not.\n\n611\n00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.760\nAnd so, we don't supersede the patch\nright away to give you a window to\n\n612\n00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.850\nbe able to continue applying that patch if\nnecessary from a remediation standpoint\n\n613\n00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:27.080\nto make sure that you get to a point\nwhere your base line is now going to,\n\n614\n00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.530\nnot only reflect the fact that you're\ngonna get rid of this patch, but\n\n615\n00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.640\nthat you have the chance to update it so\nyou can integrate the new patches.\n\n616\n00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.530\nSo, this is much about bandwidth,\nI keep saying bandwidth,\n\n617\n00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.350\nas much about baseline management\nas it is about anything else.\n\n618\n00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:45.225\nSo we wanna keep in mind that superseding\npatches right away can lead to disruption.\n\n619\n00:30:45.225 --> 00:30:48.165\nBecause what'll happen is that patch is\nno longer available for you to deploy.\n\n620\n00:30:48.165 --> 00:30:50.810\nAnd there may be systems that\nactually still need that patch.\n\n621\n00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:51.345\n>> Right.\n\n622\n00:30:51.345 --> 00:30:52.865\n>> So that's why we want\nto give ourselves a window.\n\n623\n00:30:52.865 --> 00:30:55.075\nBut that's gonna be up to you to decide,\nobviously, right?\n\n624\n00:30:55.075 --> 00:30:57.455\nIt's gonna be a question of\nhow you choose to manage this.\n\n625\n00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:59.115\nWe'll leave the defaults in place.\n\n626\n00:31:00.305 --> 00:31:06.120\nAnd we will decide if in the real\nworld we do this how long,\n\n627\n00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.460\nbased on months,\nwe want to be able to give a window.\n\n628\n00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.220\nOr we can decide to immediately\nexpire a software update.\n\n629\n00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.878\nI'm gonna just choose the immediately\nexpire, just cuz in our world,\n\n630\n00:31:13.878 --> 00:31:15.990\nnot really gonna matter\nin the demo environment.\n\n631\n00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.600\nIt just makes for\na better set of choices for\n\n632\n00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.130\nus just in terms of\nstreamlining certain things.\n\n633\n00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.455\nAll right.\nSo, what we're gonna do now,\n\n634\n00:31:23.455 --> 00:31:25.140\nlet's just take a look at language here.\n\n635\n00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.210\nI'm not gonna bother with, or\n\n636\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.050\nexcuse me, first choices, and\nthen we'll deal with language.\n\n637\n00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.750\nI'm not gonna bother with going in and\n\n638\n00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.415\nreally explaining what each\none of these categories is.\n\n639\n00:31:36.415 --> 00:31:38.440\nJust gonna show them to you so\nyou can see.\n\n640\n00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.660\nBut critical updates,\ndefinition updates, feature packs, etc.\n\n641\n00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.010\nWe have our options here.\n\n642\n00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.530\nWe choose which one or ones we want.\n\n643\n00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.668\nIn most cases you would\nobviously select everything.\n\n644\n00:31:47.668 --> 00:31:51.567\nBut, of course, then, you understand we're\nsynchronizing quite a large number of\n\n645\n00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:54.292\nitems so you have to decide what\nit is you're gonna do here.\n\n646\n00:31:54.292 --> 00:31:58.653\nAnd we're just going to do security\nupdates and nothing else for our purposes,\n\n647\n00:31:58.653 --> 00:32:02.169\njust in the demo environment,\nbecause obviously if we do a whole\n\n648\n00:32:02.169 --> 00:32:05.749\nbunch of other stuff, this little hey,\nlet's go out and talk for\n\n649\n00:32:05.749 --> 00:32:09.630\na few minute while we cook stuff is\ngoing to turn into a three day event.\n\n650\n00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.600\nAnd we'll have a patch fest here,\n\n651\n00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.650\nas opposed to being able\nto do things quickly.\n\n652\n00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.070\nSo we're gonna streamline, just for\npurposes of demonstration.\n\n653\n00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.900\nBut in the real world here, we would\nmake sure that we are downloading and\n\n654\n00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.810\nsynchronizing all of those categories,\ncuz they are gonna all be very important.\n\n655\n00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.820\nAll right, so now that we've done that,\nwe're gonna go and do products and\n\n656\n00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.970\nthen languages.\n\n657\n00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.090\nAnd so, under products,\nwe'll open up all products here.\n\n658\n00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.480\nAnd obviously Microsoft.\n\n659\n00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.480\nThere's another one of those\ninteresting things, right?\n\n660\n00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.935\nSo talk about, like,\nthe blatantly obvious, right?\n\n661\n00:32:38.935 --> 00:32:39.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you know?\n\n662\n00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.330\nWe're doing all products.\n\n663\n00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.660\nNow we're doing Microsoft,\n\n664\n00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.900\nas if there's gonna be a product that\nexists that's not a Microsoft product.\n\n665\n00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.910\nSo we need the Microsoft subcategory\nto then list the products.\n\n666\n00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.420\nI don't know.\nIt's just me but I'm thinking that's\n\n667\n00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:56.360\nthe difference between me getting done\nquickly and me getting done quickly.\n\n668\n00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.580\nAnd so,\nI may just choose to pull that out.\n\n669\n00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.870\nThere actually is, all joking aside,\na very good reason why.\n\n670\n00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:05.240\nAnd you know sometimes these things are\nnot obvious, and we make jokes about them.\n\n671\n00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.140\nBut there actually is a really good reason\nwhy Microsoft is there as a subcategory\n\n672\n00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.620\nbefore we get to the products.\n\n673\n00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.420\nDo you know why, by the way?\n\n674\n00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:17.070\n>> I would think maybe they're gonna start\ndoing updates for other, maybe like Adobe?\n\n675\n00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:22.070\n>> So that's actually, there is a business\nplan there that says we will take over and\n\n676\n00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.410\nrule the world, so\nthat could certainly be one option.\n\n677\n00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:30.550\nExpansion and global dominance is\ncertainly a driving factor for updates.\n\n678\n00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.530\nBut actually, and\n\n679\n00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.400\na lot of people when I ask them that\nsay something similar to what you said.\n\n680\n00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.740\nHey, maybe they're gonna at some point\nactually start pushing out updates for\n\n681\n00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.295\nother products.\n\n682\n00:33:38.295 --> 00:33:39.940\nSo we need the categorization.\n\n683\n00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.510\nThat's a really good thought process,\nreally good answer.\n\n684\n00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:46.490\nBut unfortunately it's not really\nthe main one that drives this choice.\n\n685\n00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.190\nBut it is potentially certainly an option\nin the sense of thinking about things.\n\n686\n00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:56.050\nWhat really is the reason why we see this\nhere is that we list, and we catalogue,\n\n687\n00:33:56.050 --> 00:34:01.530\nand we track based on reporting and usage\nsoftware in SCCM and software updates,\n\n688\n00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:06.062\nare software based on one of\nthe categories based on attribute and\n\n689\n00:34:06.062 --> 00:34:07.816\nproperty in the class is vendor.\n\n690\n00:34:07.816 --> 00:34:10.410\nSo we need Microsoft as the vendor,\n\n691\n00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:14.600\nbecause we use that to do the reporting\nand the compliance and audit work that we\n\n692\n00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.590\ndo with regards to reporting to check on\nsoftware installs and check on patches.\n\n693\n00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:22.380\nSo that's actually why it sits there\nbecause we need that in order to make sure\n\n694\n00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.860\neverything lines up when we\ndo that because we look for\n\n695\n00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.980\nthat attribute specifically.\n\n696\n00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.380\n>> So they weren't just trying\nto make us do an extra click?\n\n697\n00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.130\n>> No they were not.\n\n698\n00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.700\nIt's actually very important to have that.\n\n699\n00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.790\nThey are still bent on\nglobal dominance however, so\n\n700\n00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.300\nthat is something that we do\nwant to take into account.\n\n701\n00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.300\nBut we don't talk about that\nnormally in mixed company cuz we're\n\n702\n00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.000\nnot supposed to say anything about that.\n\n703\n00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.590\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna make a couple selections here.\n\n704\n00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.760\nJust wanted to show you that.\n\n705\n00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.742\nHey, that's one of those little quirky\nthings that if you don't think about it\n\n706\n00:34:46.742 --> 00:34:49.550\nand don't stop and realize is actually\nkind of cool just to see there.\n\n707\n00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.600\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ntake the Windows server 12 product.\n\n708\n00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.460\nSo let me just scroll down here and\n\n709\n00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.280\njust get to the bottom and we're just\ngonna go ahead and only synchronize that.\n\n710\n00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.720\nSo, I'm just gonna open up Windows here,\nand\n\n711\n00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.870\nof course, like all good systems,\nwe have a whole bunch of stuff in here.\n\n712\n00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:09.000\nSo, we're gonna uninstall all of that.\n\n713\n00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.670\nAnd actually, you know what I should do,\nis I should do this, and then do that.\n\n714\n00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.620\nAnd by doing that we'll\ndeselect everything,\n\n715\n00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.252\nbecause I should be smart about this.\n\n716\n00:35:22.252 --> 00:35:27.400\nAll right, we're going to do server 12 and\nwe're going to pull that in.\n\n717\n00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.256\nSo we got server 12 there and\nthen we're going to go ahead and\n\n718\n00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:34.940\nwe're gonna click next and\nthen we have our languages, and\n\n719\n00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:40.440\nwhat I was just going to show you with\nlanguages, quickly is the following.\n\n720\n00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.950\nThis is annoying behavior that I hate and\nI cannot stand and\n\n721\n00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:46.790\nit's been this way forever and I happen\nto really think this one is stupid,\n\n722\n00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.810\nall right, for no good reason other than\nthe fact that it's just stupid, right?\n\n723\n00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:50.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you'll see all\n\n724\n00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.680\nthe languages we support.\n\n725\n00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.630\nThat's not the stupid part.\n\n726\n00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:53.240\nThat's the good part.\n\n727\n00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.410\nWe got a lot of languages.\n\n728\n00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:58.680\nThe stupid part is that regardless of\nwhat installation you are using, and\n\n729\n00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.960\nregardless of the fact that we can\ntell what language set you are using,\n\n730\n00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.720\nwe automatically select\nthe majority of the common\n\n731\n00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.820\nlanguages that would be deployed for you,\nand this has been the case since forever.\n\n732\n00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.860\nGoing all the way back to NT 4.0 we\nhave done all this ridiculousness, and\n\n733\n00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.640\nnobody's ever thought to change it.\n\n734\n00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.860\nAnd in all that time, I have not been\nable to get a good answer from anybody,\n\n735\n00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.850\nas to why we auto-populate these\nlanguages, instead of using the logic\n\n736\n00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:31.170\nwhich we have that would allow us to say,\nwell the install is in English.\n\n737\n00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:35.230\nLet's auto-populate that one, and then\nlet you choose the others, as opposed to\n\n738\n00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:40.250\nhaving to deselect all of these, cuz\nthe reality is we're not gonna need them.\n\n739\n00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:44.510\nAnd even if we are supporting alternate\nlanguages, you would not know that here.\n\n740\n00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.030\n>> Right.\n>> So there would be no way for\n\n741\n00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:51.390\nyou to signify unless we make a choice\nwhat those alternate language sets are.\n\n742\n00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.500\nThere actually is a way.\n\n743\n00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.520\nWe could go out and query and\n\n744\n00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.420\nfind out through WMI what language\nsets are installed in the, or\n\n745\n00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.280\nthrough the hardware software inventory,\nspecifically, the software inventory.\n\n746\n00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.050\nWe could check that if that was up and\nrunning.\n\n747\n00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.220\nBut the problem is,\nwe may not have a complete inventory.\n\n748\n00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.480\nAnd as a result,\nwe may not get accurate information.\n\n749\n00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:13.380\nSo, it would make more sense to\nactually just auto select English and\n\n750\n00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.230\nleave everything else alone.\n\n751\n00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:18.740\nOr auto select the default OS language of\nthe operating system we're running on.\n\n752\n00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.700\nCuz, if you're in France your\ndefault language may be French and\n\n753\n00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.010\nthat's fine,\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n754\n00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:28.260\nBut default to that based on\nquerying the local server, and\n\n755\n00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.620\nthen leave everything else unchecked.\n\n756\n00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.820\nI've only been saying this for\nI don't know how many years, right, but\n\n757\n00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.940\nnobody pays attention.\n\n758\n00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.540\nAll right, so anyway, so we're gonna\nunselect all that language that's there,\n\n759\n00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.760\ncuz we're not gonna need all\nthe other language sets.\n\n760\n00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.640\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nclean up on here real quick.\n\n761\n00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.550\nWe are gonna leave English in place.\n\n762\n00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.470\nWe're gonna unselect everything else.\n\n763\n00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:55.030\nWhile we're doing this,\na message from our sponsor.\n\n764\n00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.535\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n765\n00:37:55.535 --> 00:37:58.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, and Russian and\n\n766\n00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.600\nthere we go, cuz we are now clean.\n\n767\n00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.110\nAll right, so we have English there.\n\n768\n00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.270\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do that, set that up.\n\n769\n00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:06.540\nWe're gonna click next.\n\n770\n00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.810\nWe get our summary screen.\n\n771\n00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:12.015\nAnd then, boy, times flies when\nyou're demoing and talking.\n\n772\n00:38:12.015 --> 00:38:14.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n773\n00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.050\nwe're going to click next.\n\n774\n00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.300\nWe got a little progress bar going there,\npretty quick.\n\n775\n00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.590\nYou can see the role\nhas been added already.\n\n776\n00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.490\nNo big deal there.\n\n777\n00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.830\nAnd then we're going to go ahead and\nclick close.\n\n778\n00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:28.570\nGet that back.\n\n779\n00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:34.810\nAnd then we're going to, soon as\nthe system updates and just kind of shows\n\n780\n00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:39.170\nus what our roles are we will see that our\nsoftware update point has been installed.\n\n781\n00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:42.020\nNow, that's not the end of\nthe story before we go back out of\n\n782\n00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.140\nthe demo environment.\n\n783\n00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:48.020\nBecause that's just giving the role\nactually, the role, the role, excuse me,\n\n784\n00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.690\nlet me speak clearly and enunciate.\n\n785\n00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.060\nThat's getting the role installed,\nand instantiated.\n\n786\n00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.610\nWhat we now are going to do,\nand we can see,\n\n787\n00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.520\nI'll just point to it\ndown at the bottom there.\n\n788\n00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.330\nWe now have our software update\npoint role right there, so\n\n789\n00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.930\nwe can see that that's actually in and\nworking.\n\n790\n00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.150\nSo now that we have that yeah that\nis kind of nice, thank you for\n\n791\n00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.010\nacknowledging that I was feeling\na little down in the dumps this morning,\n\n792\n00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.800\nyou picked me right up by by doing that,\nI do appreciate that thank you.\n\n793\n00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:19.000\nSo acknowledging my purpose for\nexisting here I do appreciate that.\n\n794\n00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.860\nYou validate me Mike,\nI do appreciate that.\n\n795\n00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.430\nWhat we're going to do\nnow is the following.\n\n796\n00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.050\nWe're going to go into software library.\n\n797\n00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:32.810\nGo to the new workspace here, and\nwhat we're going to do is take a look at,\n\n798\n00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:38.060\nscroll down here,\ntake a look at what we have and\n\n799\n00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:42.290\nshow you other working areas that\nwe're going to spend some time on.\n\n800\n00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:47.270\nAnd so in the software library or\nin the software library workspace.\n\n801\n00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:50.355\nWe spent time on application\nmanagement in the prior episodes,\n\n802\n00:39:50.355 --> 00:39:54.124\ngoing through all the deployment work\nnow we're in the software update area,\n\n803\n00:39:54.124 --> 00:39:57.627\nthe second of the three folders we're\ngoing to be intently focusing on.\n\n804\n00:39:57.627 --> 00:40:00.112\nOperating system deployment\ncoming up later on.\n\n805\n00:40:00.112 --> 00:40:03.124\nAnd you'll see now we have All Software\nUpdates, Software Update Groups,\n\n806\n00:40:03.124 --> 00:40:05.440\nDeployment Packages, and\nAutomatic Deployment Rules.\n\n807\n00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.450\nWe're gonna be going through and\nworking with these.\n\n808\n00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.790\nAnd so this where we're now gonna\nspend a little bit of time.\n\n809\n00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.669\nNow, when we go into All Software Updates,\nwe will see,\n\n810\n00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:20.790\nwe'll just let that go out and query for\njust a moment, we will see that right now,\n\n811\n00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:24.870\nright, we have to go out and\nstart synchronization process and\n\n812\n00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.990\nget some stuff going,\nbecause right now we have no items there,\n\n813\n00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.260\nI'm not gonna zoom in, but\nyou kinda see there's nothing listed and\n\n814\n00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.190\nso logic would dictate that\nthere's nothing there, and\n\n815\n00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.510\nthere will be nothing there initially,\nbecause we have not actually gone out and\n\n816\n00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.720\nbuilt the catalog yet, so\njust keep that in mind.\n\n817\n00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.220\nWhat we're gonna do now,\nif we can go back to full screen please,\n\n818\n00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:44.630\nwhat we're gonna do now is the following,\nright.\n\n819\n00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:49.310\nSo what we're gonna do, is we're gonna\ngo ahead, and we are going to set up\n\n820\n00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.190\nour software updates or\nour software update synchronization.\n\n821\n00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.570\nSo we're gonna come up here.\n\n822\n00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.360\nI'm just gonna point to it\nbefore I actually do it.\n\n823\n00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.260\nI am gonna zoom in so\nyou can see this part.\n\n824\n00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:01.370\nWhat we can do is right up there, you'll\nsee we have synchronous software updates.\n\n825\n00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:02.440\nSo we're gonna use that.\n\n826\n00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.130\nAnd we're gonna then actually go out and\n\n827\n00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.950\neffectively say to the software\nupdate role, hey go out and\n\n828\n00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:11.960\nstart bringing down those updates from\nwhere we told you to go get them before.\n\n829\n00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.240\nSo this is what we're gonna do now.\n\n830\n00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:19.450\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to get in and click that.\n\n831\n00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.580\nWe'll give that just a second.\n\n832\n00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.160\nWe get a little dialogue box here,\nwe'll just show you what that says, so\n\n833\n00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.025\nyou are prepared for\nthe mayhem that's about to ensue here.\n\n834\n00:41:29.025 --> 00:41:31.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so Run Synchronization,\n\n835\n00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.349\nyou'll see where you can review\nthe sync process by checking\n\n836\n00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:38.530\nSMS_WSUS_SYNC_MANAGER component.\n\n837\n00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:42.180\nThat's the component, the working process,\nthat actually is gonna go out and\n\n838\n00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.350\ndo the sync.\n\n839\n00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.240\nSo, we can look at the status of that\nto make sure that's working if we have\n\n840\n00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.650\nan issue or a concern.\n\n841\n00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:48.510\nAre you sure?\n\n842\n00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.060\nAgain, yeah.\n\n843\n00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.820\nNo, I clicked on it, but no, I'm not sure.\n\n844\n00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.580\nAs a matter of fact,\nI've rethought this whole thing.\n\n845\n00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.990\nI'm going into a whole different line of\nwork and I'm gonna become an auto mechanic\n\n846\n00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:02.855\ninstead so, I no longer need to\nsynchronize, I'm done, and I'm leaving.\n\n847\n00:42:02.855 --> 00:42:06.310\nNo I am sure, which is why I\nclicked in the first place, so\n\n848\n00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.720\nare we sure we want to synchronize?\n\n849\n00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.750\nYes, we are sure, so\nwe're gonna click Yes.\n\n850\n00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:17.210\nGonna kick that off, now this is obviously\nat this point going to take some time.\n\n851\n00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:20.380\nBecause it would be great if it would\njust boom, suddenly happens, and wow,\n\n852\n00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.690\nit's all there.\n\n853\n00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.600\nNow, in the real world,\nthis can actually take,\n\n854\n00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.700\ndepending on the size of the catalog that\nyou are going to be working with, right?\n\n855\n00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:34.025\nAnd depending on the size of the catalog\nwhat I'm really talking about is,\n\n856\n00:42:34.025 --> 00:42:39.265\ndepending on the number of updates,\nthe language feature sets you have chosen,\n\n857\n00:42:39.265 --> 00:42:43.645\nand the products you have chosen based\non categories, we could be talking about\n\n858\n00:42:43.645 --> 00:42:49.775\na significant amount of time to do an\ninstall and to then do a synchronization.\n\n859\n00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:53.805\nThis could take days, because potentially\nwe're down to gigabytes of stuff.\n\n860\n00:42:53.805 --> 00:42:56.300\nAnd if we have a slow connection,\nit could take a long time.\n\n861\n00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.041\nIf you've ever gone out, for instance on\nyour desktop, on your own machine and gone\n\n862\n00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:03.800\nto Windows Update, you know just do patch\nmanagement locally on your workstation.\n\n863\n00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.720\nIf you've ever done that and\nyou have gone ahead, and\n\n864\n00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.220\nyou've gone in the control panel and\nsaid, hey, search for new updates now.\n\n865\n00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.880\nAnd you sit there for 20,\n30 minutes sometimes while it's searching.\n\n866\n00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.310\nPart of that is because we have to search\nthe local system, see what is installed,\n\n867\n00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:24.010\nbuild up a effectively a delta, a hit\nlist, then we have to go out to Microsoft,\n\n868\n00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:28.710\nto the W, to the Windows update site, and\nwe have to do a comparison on the manifest\n\n869\n00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:34.280\nfor current pageants, and then based on\na comparison of the two, I have this,\n\n870\n00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.400\nyou tell me I need this, we go through and\nkind of figure out what we need.\n\n871\n00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.480\nWe then queue up and request and\n\n872\n00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.220\nultimately using bits to download\nthe deltas, the differences in the patch\n\n873\n00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.310\nthat we do have from what we should\nneed and then we have to install this.\n\n874\n00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.330\nThat's what takes so long,\nis doing that whole comparison.\n\n875\n00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:49.870\n>> Absolutely.\n\n876\n00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:51.370\n>> So, it can take awhile, so\n\n877\n00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.540\nwe're gonna wait for\nthis because this will take a little bit.\n\n878\n00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.330\nSo, what we're going to do now is to go\nback to Mike's machine, if that's okay,\n\n879\n00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:58.560\nand we're going to do a little\nbit of that discussion and\n\n880\n00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.950\nshow and\ntell we talk about it on his machine, so\n\n881\n00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:04.140\nif we can bring up Mike's machine, and\nMike's screen, we're going to go ahead and\n\n882\n00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.160\nstart going through some of those lists\nthat we want to be able to take a look at.\n\n883\n00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.830\nBut before we do that, and we're\ngoing to get to that in a minute, but\n\n884\n00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:13.410\nwe talked about being able to show\nthe kind folk out in audience land\n\n885\n00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:16.270\nhow to install a W-server just in\ncase they're not familiar with that.\n\n886\n00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.640\n>> We better do that.\n>> We're going to go ahead and\n\n887\n00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.980\njust quickly Google for\nthat and show you what to do.\n\n888\n00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.720\nSo if you could do WSUS installation,\nand then just bring up,\n\n889\n00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.430\nlet's see what we get there.\n\n890\n00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.570\nNow remember, I have talked about from a\nbest practice perspective when we do this,\n\n891\n00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:34.310\nthat we should always try to put\nout the operating system, or\n\n892\n00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:36.470\nthe version, or whatever we want, and\n\n893\n00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:41.060\nI pointed out to you that we have WSUS\n3.0 SP2, which would go on Server 08.\n\n894\n00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.800\nWe have in Server 12, or excuse me,\n\n895\n00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.720\nwe have WSUS 3 SP2 and/or WSUS N2012.\n\n896\n00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.220\nSo you have to figure out which\none you're gonna be installing.\n\n897\n00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.090\nNow that first, no, no, no, don't have\nto do that, don't have to do that.\n\n898\n00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:53.940\n>> No?\n>> Don't\n\n899\n00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.211\n>> Don't go off script here,\n\n900\n00:44:55.211 --> 00:44:57.730\nno ad-libbing unless I tell you it's okay.\n\n901\n00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:00.020\nWhat I wanna show people is that,\nif we don't specify,\n\n902\n00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.650\nwhat we get at the top there,\nWSUS 3.0, shift-click on that link,\n\n903\n00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:07.100\nI probably wanna keep the page,\nand then just open up a new one.\n\n904\n00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.320\nAnd what we'll see there is,\nwhen we go down and zoom in,\n\n905\n00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.960\nzoom in on the top where it says,\nthis is gonna be good for.\n\n906\n00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.780\nYou'll see there, it applies to Server\n2003, 2003 R2, 2003 SP1, 2003 SP2,\n\n907\n00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:23.490\n2008, and\nsoftware update services on all of those.\n\n908\n00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:28.830\nThat is WSUS 3.0 and or 3.0 SP2,\nso that's the older version right?\n\n909\n00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:33.920\nNow, if you go back to that other one,\ninstall the WSUS server roll.\n\n910\n00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.470\nNo, go down, go down, go down.\n\n911\n00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:37.543\nWait go up.\n\n912\n00:45:37.543 --> 00:45:39.980\nSP 2, step-by-step guide.\n\n913\n00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.460\nThat's still Microsoft.\n\n914\n00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:42.930\nYeah, do that one right there.\n\n915\n00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:43.980\nYeah, do that one.\nLet's see that one.\n\n916\n00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.470\nI think that one is the W 12,\nthe WSUS 2012 one.\n\n917\n00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:52.270\nYeah, so that second one is\nthe one that does 12 and 12 R2.\n\n918\n00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.010\nSo you'll get both.\n\n919\n00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.480\nThe first two hits effect,\nwe're gonna give you one of each.\n\n920\n00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.320\nBut we just wanna make sure that you\nknow that you could do a generic search\n\n921\n00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:00.850\nand you'll get both.\n\n922\n00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.100\nBut then you have to differentiate and\n\n923\n00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.980\nfigure out which OS you're\nactually gonna be using.\n\n924\n00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.630\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n925\n00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:08.070\nBut you will wanna make sure\nyou choose the right one so\n\n926\n00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.840\nthat way you know which\nguidance to follow.\n\n927\n00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.390\nThe install steps are pretty\nmuch almost identical.\n\n928\n00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:17.760\nThe key difference there primarily\nis really the port designations.\n\n929\n00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.480\n>> Port numbers.\n\n930\n00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.640\n>> Tried 80 and 443 versus 8530, 8531.\n\n931\n00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.800\nAll right, so we have that.\n\n932\n00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.550\nSo, now if we can go back to the actual\nhit list that we created, we'll go ahead\n\n933\n00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:26.630\nand we'll do that, and we'll start\ntalking through that, wonderful.\n\n934\n00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:30.570\nSo what we have there is, put together\na little list of several requirements\n\n935\n00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.540\nthat are gonna be necessary for\n\n936\n00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.520\nthe prereqs to get the software\nupdate feature up and running.\n\n937\n00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.770\nWe do need WSUS as we talked about.\n\n938\n00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:40.750\nYou could see that there,\nWSUS 3.0 SP2 or newer.\n\n939\n00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.110\nWe need the WSUS admin\nconsole on the site server.\n\n940\n00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.890\nThere is guidance on how to install,\na page for\n\n941\n00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.830\nTech Net to figure out how to get the\nadmin console installed if you need to, so\n\n942\n00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.120\nyou could figure that out and\ngo through there.\n\n943\n00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.770\nWe need appropriate permissions,\nof course.\n\n944\n00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:55.110\nWe talked a bit about that.\n\n945\n00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.360\nConfiguration manager\ninfrastructure roles.\n\n946\n00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.430\nWe need the management point,\n\n947\n00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:02.310\nthe distribution point, the software\nupdate point on the WSUS server.\n\n948\n00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.270\nWe've been doing that and\nconfiguring that.\n\n949\n00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.170\nAnd then reporting services\npoint optional there.\n\n950\n00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:08.810\nBecause remember the only\nreason we need that, and\n\n951\n00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:12.580\nwe'll come to that in our list in a couple\nminutes, is if we need to do reporting.\n\n952\n00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.570\nAnd we've talked a lot about reporting and\nreasons why it may be important.\n\n953\n00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.450\nBut we don't have to do reporting,\nit's up to us.\n\n954\n00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:23.030\nIt would not make a lot of sense to\nrun an enterprise infrastructure\n\n955\n00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:27.190\nasset management program like SCCM and\nnot be able to do reporting.\n\n956\n00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:31.300\nBut in a small environment,\nyou just may not have the resources and/or\n\n957\n00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.330\nthe skills to set up SQL reported\nservices, as we talked about, and\n\n958\n00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:38.980\nit may not be at the top of the list for\nthings you wanna do as you roll SCCM out.\n\n959\n00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:42.312\nI've a lot of customers that role out\nSCCM, and then they use it for a period of\n\n960\n00:47:42.312 --> 00:47:45.953\ntime before they do the reporting, because\nthey're more focused on fine tuning and\n\n961\n00:47:45.953 --> 00:47:49.620\ngetting the product installed then they\nare about configuring reports right away.\n\n962\n00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.174\nBut they almost without exception\nwind up putting reports in.\n\n963\n00:47:52.174 --> 00:47:53.647\nIt's just that it may take\na little bit of time.\n\n964\n00:47:53.647 --> 00:47:55.214\nSo Just be aware of that.\n\n965\n00:47:55.214 --> 00:47:57.235\nWe then have the client settings\ndown there at the bottom.\n\n966\n00:47:57.235 --> 00:48:00.749\nClient settings are required, meaning,\nwhat do we need on the default client\n\n967\n00:48:00.749 --> 00:48:04.090\nsettings for the agent to be able\nto make sure that this will work.\n\n968\n00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:07.570\nAnd then the Windows Update Agent\nneeds to be installed on the client's,\n\n969\n00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:12.320\nthat is the Windows Update Agent\nthat is by default,\n\n970\n00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.920\nnatively in every operating\nsystem that Microsoft puts out.\n\n971\n00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.180\nSo, that's just got to be there.\n\n972\n00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.720\nBut the client's settings,\n\n973\n00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:23.130\nspecifically for the SCCM client,\nmaking sure the client agent,\n\n974\n00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.910\nthat they are configured,\ndo have to be configured properly.\n\n975\n00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:29.030\nWe've looked at those before\nwith default client settings,\n\n976\n00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:32.110\ntalked about how to create\na custom superset or smaller set,\n\n977\n00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:35.680\na subset of those, and figure out what\nthey are and deploy them to a collection.\n\n978\n00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.320\nI've shown you how to do that.\n\n979\n00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.420\nSo, just keep that in mind, right?\n\n980\n00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.960\nWhat we see here, is we're gonna take\na look at the graphic that's gonna\n\n981\n00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.910\nhelp us to illustrate how\nwe're going to set up and\n\n982\n00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:47.840\nsynchronize the software update catalog,\nand the metadata associated with it.\n\n983\n00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:53.950\nSo, what we're looking at on the right,\non the left upper, right, I'm sorry.\n\n984\n00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.300\nLet me turn around and\nmake sure I'm facing the right way.\n\n985\n00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.740\nOn the upper lefthand side of the screen,\n\n986\n00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.900\nin the cloud,\nis the Microsoft Update function now.\n\n987\n00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.020\nIn other words, going out to Microsoft,\nto their update site, and\n\n988\n00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.290\ngrabbing updates from them through the\ncloud, is what we're showing you there.\n\n989\n00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.210\nThose are coming down to the WSUS server.\n\n990\n00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:11.740\nYou'll see that there.\n\n991\n00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.140\nMike's kinda hovering and\ncircling around that right now.\n\n992\n00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.305\nThe two-way arrows simply represent\nbidirectional communication\n\n993\n00:49:17.305 --> 00:49:20.165\ntaking place in every one of\nthese communication paths,\n\n994\n00:49:20.165 --> 00:49:23.175\nbecause the WSUS server\ntalks to Microsoft Update.\n\n995\n00:49:23.175 --> 00:49:27.365\nMicrosoft Update talks back to the WSUS\nserver, and then updates fly back and\n\n996\n00:49:27.365 --> 00:49:28.455\nforth as a result of that.\n\n997\n00:49:29.697 --> 00:49:34.947\nWe then see the WSUS server down towards\nthe bottom, with a WSUS database.\n\n998\n00:49:34.947 --> 00:49:39.277\nThat WSUS server may have the database\ninstalled right on it there locally,\n\n999\n00:49:39.277 --> 00:49:41.897\nmaybe leveraging a database\nthat's somewhere else.\n\n1000\n00:49:41.897 --> 00:49:46.287\nSo, the idea is we're simply dropping\nthose updates into the SQL database.\n\n1001\n00:49:46.287 --> 00:49:48.547\nIt's gonna maintain and\nbuild that catalog for us.\n\n1002\n00:49:48.547 --> 00:49:52.560\nSo, we're seeing those streaming in and\ndownloading, if you will.\n\n1003\n00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.620\nAnd then the site server over there.\n\n1004\n00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.480\nThe site server is going to\nbe the primary site server\n\n1005\n00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.730\nthat has its own site database.\n\n1006\n00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.070\nYou'll see that off to the right there.\n\n1007\n00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:07.670\nAnd the site server has the administrative\nconsole on it, the management point,\n\n1008\n00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:08.670\nthe distribution point.\n\n1009\n00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:11.587\nAll that stuff sitting there, and\nthose functionalities are there.\n\n1010\n00:50:11.587 --> 00:50:15.272\nBut the idea is that we're basically\nusing the WSUS server to go out and\n\n1011\n00:50:15.272 --> 00:50:19.333\ngrab the catalog updates, and then we\nare pushing those out to the database,\n\n1012\n00:50:19.333 --> 00:50:20.410\nthe WSUS database.\n\n1013\n00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:24.425\nAnd then leveraging them when necessary,\nthrough the deployment process that we'll\n\n1014\n00:50:24.425 --> 00:50:27.635\nbe taking a look at, once our catalog\nupdates are finished cooking.\n\n1015\n00:50:27.635 --> 00:50:29.435\nAnd actually, I'll show up and\nresynchronize.\n\n1016\n00:50:29.435 --> 00:50:31.627\nSo, we'll be taking a look at that.\n\n1017\n00:50:31.627 --> 00:50:33.555\nAll right, so, then what we wanna do is,\n\n1018\n00:50:33.555 --> 00:50:37.525\nwanna go ahead and see what we do when\nwe are gonna scan for compliance.\n\n1019\n00:50:37.525 --> 00:50:39.235\nNow, compliance is kind of interesting.\n\n1020\n00:50:39.235 --> 00:50:43.600\nAnd we'll give the picture a moment\njust to kinda sit on the screen, and\n\n1021\n00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.690\nlet you look at it and\nabsorb it while we're talking,\n\n1022\n00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.210\nbefore we talk about what's\nactually happening there.\n\n1023\n00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:52.220\nThe idea with compliance and the idea with\npatch management in general is twofold.\n\n1024\n00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:55.790\nWe need to build the catalog so that we\nunderstand what updates are available.\n\n1025\n00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:59.677\nBut, then we have to decide what updates\nare gonna necessarily be applied in our\n\n1026\n00:50:59.677 --> 00:51:04.029\nenvironment, and what effectively is gonna\nbecome part of our baseline going forward,\n\n1027\n00:51:04.029 --> 00:51:07.799\nand which updates are just not important\nat the time for whatever reason, and\n\n1028\n00:51:07.799 --> 00:51:09.446\nwe're not going to worry about.\n\n1029\n00:51:09.446 --> 00:51:13.234\nAnd the ones that are important that\nwe want to apply, and ultimately\n\n1030\n00:51:13.234 --> 00:51:17.169\nmake part of a standard baseline for\nour machines, have to be managed.\n\n1031\n00:51:17.169 --> 00:51:18.973\nSo, we have to think about testing them,\n\n1032\n00:51:18.973 --> 00:51:21.430\nwhich always test an update\nbefore we ever deploy it.\n\n1033\n00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:23.690\nNever a good idea to put a patch out for\nany reason,\n\n1034\n00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:26.680\nunder any circumstances,\nunless we know what it's gonna do.\n\n1035\n00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:30.210\nNot because we don't trust the vendor.\n\n1036\n00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:32.840\nBecause we should,\nall kidding aside, right?\n\n1037\n00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.245\nHopefully, more often than not,\n\n1038\n00:51:34.245 --> 00:51:37.680\nthey do good work and we know that that\nstuff will do what it's supposed to do.\n\n1039\n00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.010\nBut we don't know how it's gonna\noperate in our environment.\n\n1040\n00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:44.350\nIt's not so much that the vendor itself,\nor the vendor themselves, may or\n\n1041\n00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:45.610\nmay not be trustworthy.\n\n1042\n00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:49.750\nThe problem is that we may not know\nhow that patch is gonna behave,\n\n1043\n00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.530\nbecause we have different\noperating environments,\n\n1044\n00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:56.740\ndifferent system configurations,\ndifferent hardware, different software.\n\n1045\n00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.310\nAnd we can't know just\noff the top of our head,\n\n1046\n00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:03.200\nwithout doing a little patch management,\nQA testing, whether or\n\n1047\n00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.140\nnot that patch is gonna break anything,\nand if so, what does it break, right?\n\n1048\n00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.410\nSo we need to think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n1049\n00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:13.517\nSo as a result, what's gonna happen\nis we're going to test those patches,\n\n1050\n00:52:13.517 --> 00:52:16.620\nfigure out which ones, and\nidentify which ones we need.\n\n1051\n00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:17.550\nTest those.\n\n1052\n00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:19.130\nWe're then going to say,\nokay those look good.\n\n1053\n00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.570\nLooks like we obviously\nhave a good match here.\n\n1054\n00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:23.470\nNothing breaks,\nat least on the surface anyway.\n\n1055\n00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:24.535\nIt seems like everything is okay.\n\n1056\n00:52:24.535 --> 00:52:27.780\nAnd then based on that,\nwe're going to set those patches up, and\n\n1057\n00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.410\nget ready to identify them and\n\n1058\n00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:32.720\ndeploy them, because we have to\nactually now decide to push those out.\n\n1059\n00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.632\nBut, before we can do any of that, what we\nhave to do is, or rather, as we do that,\n\n1060\n00:52:36.632 --> 00:52:37.270\nI should say.\n\n1061\n00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:41.750\nWhat we then have to do is figure out\nwhich machines out there, which endpoints,\n\n1062\n00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:45.220\nservers, desktops, etc.,\nneed which patches because\n\n1063\n00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.220\na new machine that's just been brought up,\nmay require a lot of patches.\n\n1064\n00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.030\nWhereas a machine that's been\noperating for a long time, and\n\n1065\n00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:54.255\nhas been getting patches,\nmay already have a lot of those, right?\n\n1066\n00:52:54.255 --> 00:52:55.180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1067\n00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.920\n>> Now, we, we may get smart.\n\n1068\n00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:00.899\nWe may say, well, what if we integrate\nsome of those patches into our baseline\n\n1069\n00:53:00.899 --> 00:53:02.665\nimage for our operating systems?\n\n1070\n00:53:02.665 --> 00:53:04.944\nThat way, as we deploy those new machines,\n\n1071\n00:53:04.944 --> 00:53:09.748\nwe don't have to worry about regressively\npatching 20, 30, 40, 50 patches, and\n\n1072\n00:53:09.748 --> 00:53:14.026\nback filling the machine because that\ncan present a security liability, right?\n\n1073\n00:53:14.026 --> 00:53:16.025\nBecause we bring up an unpatched machine.\n\n1074\n00:53:16.025 --> 00:53:18.765\nAnd it may take several hours for\na mediator to cross the network.\n\n1075\n00:53:18.765 --> 00:53:21.045\nSo, I wanna make sure that we're aware\nof that and we're thinking about that.\n\n1076\n00:53:21.045 --> 00:53:22.610\nWe have options in other words.\n\n1077\n00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:23.555\nAnd we can look at,\n\n1078\n00:53:23.555 --> 00:53:27.100\nand we will indeed talk about when\nwe do operating system deployment,\n\n1079\n00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.970\nwhat that thought process would be if we\nwant to integrate some of those patches.\n\n1080\n00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:31.532\nHow can we do an update to the baseline?\n\n1081\n00:53:31.532 --> 00:53:33.271\nWe're not gonna really deal with that now,\nbut\n\n1082\n00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:34.806\njust want to throw that out there for you.\n\n1083\n00:53:34.806 --> 00:53:39.470\nSo, the idea would be now, when we\nthink about scanning for compliance,\n\n1084\n00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:43.250\nis ultimately how are we going\nto approach understanding?\n\n1085\n00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:47.350\nOr approach, from our perspective,\nfiguring out\n\n1086\n00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:50.340\nwhat it is that already exists out there\non the majority of our systems, and\n\n1087\n00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.980\nwhere the gaps and\nthe deltas are gonna be.\n\n1088\n00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:56.060\nAnd this is what this process that we're\ndiagramming here for you represents,\n\n1089\n00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.070\nthis idea of scanning the systems for\ncompliance, to see whether or\n\n1090\n00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:01.470\nnot they own these patches and\nthey're installed.\n\n1091\n00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:02.690\nSo, that's what we're gonna talk through.\n\n1092\n00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:04.600\nSo, you'll see we have a laptop there.\n\n1093\n00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.450\nIt says managed computer,\nkind of in the middle, right there, and\n\n1094\n00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.153\nwe've got an arrow that's pointing\noff to the WMI repository.\n\n1095\n00:54:10.153 --> 00:54:14.009\nWMI repository is gonna\nbe on every machine.\n\n1096\n00:54:14.009 --> 00:54:17.545\nThe WMI repository allows us to\nunderstand through the namespace,\n\n1097\n00:54:17.545 --> 00:54:21.820\nwhat classes of objects, what attributes,\nattribute classes we have.\n\n1098\n00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.970\nAnd we've seen this when we did\nan extension to the hardware\n\n1099\n00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:24.780\ninventory, for instance.\n\n1100\n00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:28.560\nWe extended out and\nlooked at the WMI repository,\n\n1101\n00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.110\nand actually created a couple of new\nattribute classes and put them in.\n\n1102\n00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.980\nAnd we actually can see in the real world,\nevery so\n\n1103\n00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:39.080\noften, that there may be errors\nassociated with the WMI repository.\n\n1104\n00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.780\nThe namespace, right, for instance.\n\n1105\n00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:44.060\nIf we have a corrupt namespace,\nif something were to go wrong,\n\n1106\n00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.880\nwe may try to install the client agent,\nfor instance, and\n\n1107\n00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.850\nhave a problem because one of the failures\nthat can occur when we're installing\n\n1108\n00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:54.560\nthe client agent, is that if the WMI\nrepository, the namespace is corrupt, or\n\n1109\n00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:59.450\nunavailable for some reason we can not\nget to, the agent installation will fail.\n\n1110\n00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:00.820\nAnd so what can happen is,\n\n1111\n00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.420\nif we see that, it's actually a fairly\nstraightforward thing to fix.\n\n1112\n00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.730\nBut you'll get an error code,\n800 something or other,\n\n1113\n00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:08.990\nI forget, what\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n1114\n00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:10.080\n>> Something or other.\n\n1115\n00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.600\nBut whatever the error code is,\nI forget the exact one, but\n\n1116\n00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.500\nyou'll get one of two error codes\nthat normally will come up.\n\n1117\n00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.170\nAnd you'll simply,\n\n1118\n00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.880\nthe easiest way is to just go out and\nGoogle for that error code.\n\n1119\n00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:23.130\nBut you'll basically, what you need to do\nis effect a repair on the WMI repository.\n\n1120\n00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:26.560\nYou'll effectively create a new one and\ninstall it, get rid of the old one.\n\n1121\n00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.679\nAnd that will, more often than not,\nfix the problem.\n\n1122\n00:55:28.679 --> 00:55:31.809\nSo, one of those things that can really\njust happen in the real world, and\n\n1123\n00:55:31.809 --> 00:55:35.059\nif you happen to come across that,\nat least you'll know how to deal with it.\n\n1124\n00:55:35.059 --> 00:55:37.372\nBut here we're checking for the WMI,\n\n1125\n00:55:37.372 --> 00:55:40.920\nor with the WMI repository to\nbe able to see what's there.\n\n1126\n00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.379\nIn addition, what we have to do is,\n\n1127\n00:55:42.379 --> 00:55:45.507\nyou'll notice we have arrows going out\nto the WSUS server, off to the left.\n\n1128\n00:55:45.507 --> 00:55:48.796\nThose go down to the WSUS database, right?\n\n1129\n00:55:48.796 --> 00:55:50.382\nBecause we're talking to the WSUS server.\n\n1130\n00:55:50.382 --> 00:55:51.939\nFigure out what patches are available.\n\n1131\n00:55:51.939 --> 00:55:55.233\nWe also have arrows coming off the managed\ncomputer going down to the right.\n\n1132\n00:55:55.233 --> 00:55:57.887\nThat's going down into\nthe management point.\n\n1133\n00:55:57.887 --> 00:56:01.515\nRemember, the management point is their\ncentral point of communication for\n\n1134\n00:56:01.515 --> 00:56:02.490\nevery client.\n\n1135\n00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:05.550\nThat is then going to affect where\nwe receive policy updates, receive\n\n1136\n00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.870\ninformation about any pending actions that\nneed to take place to reconfigure and\n\n1137\n00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:10.460\nor modify.\n\n1138\n00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:13.410\nAnd there's an arrow coming out of\nthe management point that kind of loops up\n\n1139\n00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:16.952\ntowards the site server representing\ncommunication with the site server.\n\n1140\n00:56:16.952 --> 00:56:19.450\nSite server's talking\nto the site database.\n\n1141\n00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:20.370\nAnd, also, potentially,\n\n1142\n00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.240\nis gonna be generating reports\non the status of the client.\n\n1143\n00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.170\nSo we've got a lot of communication\nactivity going on here,\n\n1144\n00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:27.540\nlot of different things happening.\n\n1145\n00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.840\nAnd so,\nwe wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n1146\n00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:39.610\nThe idea here is that we want to figure\nout what is on that managed computer.\n\n1147\n00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:43.030\nAnd then, based on what is currently\nthere versus what is being advertised or\n\n1148\n00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:48.900\navailable through the WSUS database\nthrough the software update feature.\n\n1149\n00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.640\nWe then wanna figure out what\npatches we are gonna need to apply.\n\n1150\n00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.660\nSo we're effectively looking to\nsee what our current baseline is.\n\n1151\n00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:58.240\nCreating an effected delta,\na gap analysis in our mind.\n\n1152\n00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.300\nAnd then, we can look at and then decide\nwhich patches we're gonna need and\n\n1153\n00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.050\ndownload those.\n\n1154\n00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.510\nSo this is what we're effectively gonna\nbe doing here, and trying to figure out.\n\n1155\n00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:09.015\nSo this is the process that we\nare engaging in and looking at.\n\n1156\n00:57:09.015 --> 00:57:13.170\nAnd so, we just wanna make sure\nthat we are thinking about that.\n\n1157\n00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:16.840\nAnd taking a look and seeing what is\ntaking place is really helping us\n\n1158\n00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.870\nto understand what patches\nwill be available, and\n\n1159\n00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:22.920\nwhich ones may ultimately\nwind up getting deployed.\n\n1160\n00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.180\nSo this is what scanning for\ncompliance is gonna look like.\n\n1161\n00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.440\nWe have different compliance states,\nby the way.\n\n1162\n00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.180\nWe have a list of them.\n\n1163\n00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:30.480\nWe'll quickly show you what they are.\n\n1164\n00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.120\nI believe if we scroll\ndown we should get those.\n\n1165\n00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:32.790\nThere we go.\n\n1166\n00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:37.680\nSo compliance states include required,\ninstalled, not required, and unknown.\n\n1167\n00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:42.760\nAnd the idea with compliance states is\nwhen we look, if we have a required state,\n\n1168\n00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.040\nthat's a patch that is going\nto have to be there, right?\n\n1169\n00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.580\nSo we need to install that.\n\n1170\n00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:49.400\nIf we installed, it's already there.\n\n1171\n00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:51.010\nNot required, optional.\n\n1172\n00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:52.490\nUnknown, we have no way of knowing.\n\n1173\n00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:54.935\nSo we haven't scanned or\njust not sure what that is.\n\n1174\n00:57:54.935 --> 00:57:56.635\nSo we can look at those different states,\nand\n\n1175\n00:57:56.635 --> 00:57:59.235\nthen as a result of understanding\nthe meaning of them,\n\n1176\n00:57:59.235 --> 00:58:03.905\nreally figure out exactly what is going\non, path by path, machine by machine.\n\n1177\n00:58:03.905 --> 00:58:07.845\nWe have a software update deployment\nprocess, I think, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n1178\n00:58:07.845 --> 00:58:10.785\nA graphic, and then we'll take a look\nwhat the actual process looks like.\n\n1179\n00:58:10.785 --> 00:58:15.490\nSo what this graphic is gonna represent\nfor us is the ability to be able to go out\n\n1180\n00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:20.690\nand to effectively show you how\nwe're gonna deploy software updates.\n\n1181\n00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:22.640\nWe're starting over with,\nat the bottom there,\n\n1182\n00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.120\nthe administrative console,\nthe management point, distribution point.\n\n1183\n00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.230\nWe see all that functionality\non the site server.\n\n1184\n00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.900\nSo, the site server is going to,\nyou'll remember, be that local or\n\n1185\n00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:37.080\nthat focus point of information,\ninformation management coordination.\n\n1186\n00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.590\nAll that's taking place there.\n\n1187\n00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:42.410\nAnd what we see at the site server, up\nabove, from the console list, is that we\n\n1188\n00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:46.520\nsee that it's going up and talking to\nthe software update local source, or\n\n1189\n00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:50.470\nthe software update point, up at the top,\nwhich is over to the left talking to\n\n1190\n00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:54.360\nMicrosoft Update pulling in all\nthose patches as we talked about.\n\n1191\n00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.390\nOff to the right there, we have\na one way arrow that that goes up to\n\n1192\n00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:59.860\nthe site database to check on\nthe status and update information.\n\n1193\n00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.920\nWe have a manage computer\ndown on the left hand side.\n\n1194\n00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:07.170\nAnd that computer's talking with the\nmanagement point, the distribution point,\n\n1195\n00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:10.720\ntalking with the administrative console,\nor rather the administrative console is\n\n1196\n00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.500\ntalking to those other roles and\nshowing us what's going on.\n\n1197\n00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.410\nAnd so, we'll download patches\nfrom Microsoft Update.\n\n1198\n00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:18.940\nWe'll check the bin, if you will,\n\n1199\n00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.140\nmake sure that they\nare available in the console.\n\n1200\n00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.460\nAnd then, we will go ahead and\nonce we choose which packages we want to\n\n1201\n00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:29.230\ndeploy and create our deployment solution\nto do that, we'll be able to go in and\n\n1202\n00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:33.870\nthen be able to start to see those\npatches showing up in the console,\n\n1203\n00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.970\nand then be able to start deploying them.\n\n1204\n00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.790\nAnd so, this process is\nactually fairly straightforward\n\n1205\n00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:40.390\nonce the patches are available.\n\n1206\n00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.770\nAnd we simply say, hey,\nI want these five patches.\n\n1207\n00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:46.640\nPackage them up and then deploy them as if\nthey were just a normal piece of software.\n\n1208\n00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.210\nBecause, effectively,\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n1209\n00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:51.640\nWe're deploying packages just using the\nsoftware deployment model, the way we did\n\n1210\n00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.970\nwith applications and packages as we\nwalked through and discussed all that.\n\n1211\n00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:59.510\nSo, deploying software updates to client\ncomputers is fairly straightforward.\n\n1212\n00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:02.360\nWe have a list that will just walk us\nthrough the high level steps here.\n\n1213\n01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.515\nProvide the name and target collection.\n\n1214\n01:00:04.515 --> 01:00:09.370\nSo what are we gonna call\nthe deployment package?\n\n1215\n01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:11.630\nSecurity update one or whatever.\n\n1216\n01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:12.860\nWhat's our target collection?\n\n1217\n01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.550\nAll systems or\nwhatever we may want to call it.\n\n1218\n01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:18.540\nSpecify the type of deployment required or\navailable.\n\n1219\n01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.370\nRequired is obviously gonna be mandatory.\n\n1220\n01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.640\nAvailable is optional.\n\n1221\n01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.860\nRight?\nSo, we can choose to opt in on that.\n\n1222\n01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.210\nSpecify the schedule.\n\n1223\n01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:29.510\nI want this available starting on\nTuesday afternoon at 5 PM or whatever.\n\n1224\n01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:31.990\nConfigure user notifications and\nrestart behavior.\n\n1225\n01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:34.540\nAre we gonna tell users\nwe're doing patching?\n\n1226\n01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.160\nAre we gonna tell them 20 minutes out?\n\n1227\n01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.390\nAre we gonna tell them as we're doing it?\n\n1228\n01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:40.080\nAnd then,\nare we gonna automatically restart?\n\n1229\n01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.200\nAre we gonna let them opt out?\n\n1230\n01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.820\nIf so, for how long.\n\n1231\n01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.730\nWe do have that opt-out\nwarning that comes up with\n\n1232\n01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:49.510\nautomatic updates when we do it through\nthe local client on the end point.\n\n1233\n01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:50.770\nSo we can do that.\n\n1234\n01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:52.130\nConfigure alert settings.\n\n1235\n01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.950\nWhat kind of alerts may get generated.\n\n1236\n01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.480\nSpecify installation behavior based\non boundary group association and\n\n1237\n01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.520\ncontent availability.\n\n1238\n01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.940\nRemember, the need to\nhave boundary groups and\n\n1239\n01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.790\nthe use of boundary\ngroups is very important.\n\n1240\n01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.270\nWe've talked about them before.\n\n1241\n01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:08.080\nThe boundary group is really just\nthe administrative container for\n\n1242\n01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.000\nthe boundaries.\n\n1243\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.810\nThat just helps us to manage them.\n\n1244\n01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:12.580\nBut the boundaries themselves, remember,\n\n1245\n01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:17.890\nbased on either IPV4 address\nrange on subnet, on IPV6 prefix,\n\n1246\n01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:21.927\nand or active directory site boundaries\nare going to let us associate machines.\n\n1247\n01:01:21.927 --> 01:01:24.050\nEnd points manage clients.\n\n1248\n01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:26.460\nWith one or more of those boundaries\nset up, they're part of that group, and\n\n1249\n01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.010\nassociated with that site server.\n\n1250\n01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.659\nAnd then, they can leverage this\nfunctionality from within those\n\n1251\n01:01:30.659 --> 01:01:31.280\nsite servers.\n\n1252\n01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.890\nSo, want to make sure we know\nthat we have to associate them\n\n1253\n01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.915\nwith that boundary group in order\nto be able to figure that out.\n\n1254\n01:01:35.915 --> 01:01:36.735\nAll right.\n\n1255\n01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.785\nSo, we've gone through, at that point,\n\n1256\n01:01:38.785 --> 01:01:41.725\nall the stuff that we wanted to at\nleast set up and tee up ahead of time.\n\n1257\n01:01:41.725 --> 01:01:46.115\nI'm gonna take a look here real quick, see\nif we have our updates coming back down.\n\n1258\n01:01:46.115 --> 01:01:47.895\nSo give me just a second to do that.\n\n1259\n01:01:47.895 --> 01:01:49.030\nSo far, I haven't seen any.\n\n1260\n01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.519\nI've snuck a peek once or\ntwice while we've been talking.\n\n1261\n01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.550\nBut, as I did say, this process can take a\nfair amount of time depending on the speed\n\n1262\n01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:57.860\nof the Internet connection.\n\n1263\n01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.920\nAnd I'm not seeing any\nupdates showing up yet.\n\n1264\n01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.570\nSo what we're gonna do, I think,\nis maybe wrap up this episode here.\n\n1265\n01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:04.210\nWe'll come back and\n\n1266\n01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:07.380\nwe'll do another one, just pick up\nwhere the updates have come in.\n\n1267\n01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.870\nThat way, we're not stuck waiting and\n\n1268\n01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:12.830\ntalking to you about what I read\nin the newspaper yesterday,\n\n1269\n01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:16.610\nhow exciting that was, and what I had for\nbreakfast this morning just to kill time.\n\n1270\n01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:18.920\nBut rather, we'll go, I mean,\nwe could do that, if you'd like.\n\n1271\n01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.495\n>> [CROSSTALK] interesting.\n\n1272\n01:02:19.495 --> 01:02:21.586\n>> Had a cool breakfast,\nit actually was really neat.\n\n1273\n01:02:21.586 --> 01:02:23.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But what I think would make more sense,\n\n1274\n01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.510\nall kidding aside, is we'll go ahead and\nwe'll give you back a little bit of time,\n\n1275\n01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:27.090\nlet you go and\n\n1276\n01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:30.385\nmaybe do some stuff, get organized\n>> Get a cup of coffee.\n\n1277\n01:02:30.385 --> 01:02:33.215\nDo whatever you need to do to come\nback and be fresh and focused.\n\n1278\n01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:36.475\nAs soon as we get these updates\nsynced up in the system here,\n\n1279\n01:02:36.475 --> 01:02:37.975\nwe'll be able to jump right back in.\n\n1280\n01:02:37.975 --> 01:02:39.875\nWe'll pick up the demo from that point.\n\n1281\n01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:40.985\nWe'll be able to, then, run through and\n\n1282\n01:02:40.985 --> 01:02:42.960\nshow you how to do\nthe deployment of the package.\n\n1283\n01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.550\nAnd then we'll finish up\nwith this discussion.\n\n1284\n01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:46.640\n>> Sounds like a plan, Adam.\n\n1285\n01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.860\nAgain, another great episode.\n\n1286\n01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:51.000\nWe got to look at at least the first\npart of getting all this set up so\n\n1287\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.540\nwe can deploy those software updates\nout to our clients and our enterprise.\n\n1288\n01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.770\nAnd, as Adam told you,\nthere's more to come.\n\n1289\n01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:59.580\nWe've just gotta wait for everything\nto kind of start synchronizing so\n\n1290\n01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.390\nwe can get in there and\nactually perform those next steps.\n\n1291\n01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:03.460\nSo, we'll step away.\n\n1292\n01:03:03.460

--> 00:00:16.505\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:20.680\nToday we're doing our\nSCCM 2012 R2 content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.280\nAnd specifically we're\nlooking at software updates.\n\n6\n00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.450\nSo this is a part two actually.\n\n7\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.130\nWe've already got everything set up and\nwe were getting some updates synchronized\n\n8\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.200\nwith Microsoft and\nthat takes a little bit of time.\n\n9\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.480\nSo we took a little break and\nnow we're gonna dive right back into it.\n\n10\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.210\nAnd of course here with me is Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.040\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.720\n>> Good, good.\n\n13\n00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.270\nSo we broke the internet but\n\n14\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.890\nwe fixed it so\nnow we can get back to what we were doing.\n\n15\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.940\nSo I did mention at the ending of\nour first episode in this series,\n\n16\n00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.890\nthe part one if you will, to make that\nless complicated for those of you that\n\n17\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.170\nare keeping track, that we had a bit\nof a problem with the synchronization.\n\n18\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.700\nI fixed it.\n\n19\n00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.840\nWe were just waiting on\neverything to finish up.\n\n20\n00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.410\nIt has.\n\n21\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.370\nWe have the catalog built.\n\n22\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.000\nWe'll jump back in there in a second.\n\n23\n00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.090\nJust wanted to quickly give you a heads up\nfor the real world, that if this occurs,\n\n24\n00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.480\nyou'll at least have a sense of\nhow to deal with it there as well.\n\n25\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.290\nSo, we were demoing, and as we were\ngoing through, I spent some time and\n\n26\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.470\nshowed you that we were\nusing a proxy server.\n\n27\n00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.730\nWe don't normally do that\nunless we have a reason to,\n\n28\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.640\nmeaning that we are using\nproxies in the enterprise.\n\n29\n00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.599\nAnd as a result of that, we have to\nspecify what that proxy will be and\n\n30\n00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:27.446\nput in the address,\nput in the connection port,\n\n31\n00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:30.796\nif there is alternate port mapping for\nit, and the name.\n\n32\n00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:33.400\nAnd so we put all that in\non one of the two screens.\n\n33\n00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.970\nWhen we went to verify the credentials,\npartially my fault, partially the fault\n\n34\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.890\nof the organizational elements that\nset up our lab environment for\n\n35\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.900\nus in the sense that I did not realize\nthat they had not done the proxy\n\n36\n00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.220\nmapping and had it set up so that we\nwould be able to find it automatically.\n\n37\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.780\nSo I did not bother to verify it,\nwhich again, was my fault.\n\n38\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.505\nI should not have assumed that it would\nbe there automatically and it would work.\n\n39\n00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:02.012\nSo because I didn't verify the connection\nwe were not able to go out and\n\n40\n00:02:02.012 --> 00:02:04.430\nconnect automatically the first time.\n\n41\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.240\nThe sync failed, in other words.\n\n42\n00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.020\nWhen we were sitting and talking with you,\nkeeping an eye on it here,\n\n43\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.200\nas we looked at it we went back and\nsaw that nothing had happened.\n\n44\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.090\nThat's why we decided to take the break,\npause for a few minutes,\n\n45\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.742\ncheck on what was going\non behind the scenes.\n\n46\n00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:22.820\nWent and looked at the status of the sync\nmanager, took a look at the logs,\n\n47\n00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.810\nqueried, found out that we did indeed have\na failure, went back, figured out why.\n\n48\n00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.540\nWe did not have the right credential and\nport mapping in for the proxy.\n\n49\n00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.870\nSo it was simple enough to go back and\n\n50\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.350\nfix that once we diagnosed\nwhat the problem was.\n\n51\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.810\nBut this can happen if you're not\nconfiguring the proxy the right way.\n\n52\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.080\nAnd so I just want to quickly\nshow you as we get started again,\n\n53\n00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.600\nwe're gonna go back into my\nmachine here in a second,\n\n54\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.560\nwanna show you just where I went and\nwhat I did to see that.\n\n55\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.840\nSo that way if you ever have a problem,\n\n56\n00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.910\nyou'll at least have a sense\nof what to do to fix it.\n\n57\n00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.450\nAnd then we'll jump back in, cuz now\nthe catalog is built, we have our updates\n\n58\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.050\nsitting here, and we'll be able to\npick back up where we left off.\n\n59\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.310\nWe'll choose an update,\nwe'll go ahead and we will highlight one,\n\n60\n00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.410\nwe'll talk about how to create a software\nupdate group, and then we'll go in and\n\n61\n00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.440\nwe'll package it up and\nget ready to deploy it.\n\n62\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.460\nSo if we can go to full screen on that,\nso that we can see the entire console,\n\n63\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.120\nwhat I'm gonna do is just quickly take\nyou in to the monitoring workspace,\n\n64\n00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.130\nwe'll switch the focus here for\njust a moment.\n\n65\n00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.680\nAnd I'll zoom in on this for\n\n66\n00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.110\nyou as soon as I get it just\nto where we need it to be.\n\n67\n00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.900\nAnd then let me just scroll down just\na little bit here, bring the WSUS items up\n\n68\n00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.504\ninto the middle of the screen so\nwe can see them a little better.\n\n69\n00:03:28.504 --> 00:03:33.810\nAnd I'm gonna highlight the one\nthat we are going to be using.\n\n70\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.770\nAnd what you'll see as we zoom in is\nthat we are in the Monitoring workspace.\n\n71\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.250\nWe're up under on System Status,\nComponent Status.\n\n72\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.490\nSo we're looking at the components that\nactually are making the, in this case,\n\n73\n00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.260\nWSUS functionality work, but generically,\nall the different components.\n\n74\n00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.145\nThink of the components as\neffectively the services,\n\n75\n00:03:56.145 --> 00:04:02.000\nand/or the object managers that\nare managing the services inside SCCM.\n\n76\n00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.220\nAnd we've highlighted the two,\nactually all three that are there.\n\n77\n00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.500\nBut the one in particular,\nall as you can see, all three say WSUS.\n\n78\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.260\nThe sync manager,\nthe one I'm highlighting and\n\n79\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.340\npointing to,\nis the one that was the issue for us.\n\n80\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.320\nThe config manager, no problem.\n\n81\n00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.145\nControl manager, no problem.\n\n82\n00:04:19.145 --> 00:04:22.460\nSetup of the site role went fine,\nit was configured, everything was good.\n\n83\n00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.521\nWell, with the exception\nof the stupid proxy thing.\n\n84\n00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:26.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But that was obviously an issue, but\n\n85\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.520\nwe wouldn't see that\nin the config manager.\n\n86\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.530\nActually, we see evidence of\nthat in the sync manager.\n\n87\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.255\nSo we have to know where to go.\n\n88\n00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:37.415\nAnd so when we go into the sync manager,\nand I'm going to show you how we did this\n\n89\n00:04:37.415 --> 00:04:40.211\nright now,\nwe're going to right click on this one.\n\n90\n00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:44.280\nOf course, we have to select the right\none first, which is why I did move down.\n\n91\n00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.210\nBut of course,\nwe just love our lab environment here.\n\n92\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.630\nLet me just scroll down a little more,\n\n93\n00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.320\nget that back up in the middle\nof the screen there.\n\n94\n00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.420\nSo when I zoom in and\nzoom out we lose focus and\n\n95\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.345\neverything just kind of goes to\nhell in a handbasket, as they say.\n\n96\n00:05:00.345 --> 00:05:01.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so,\n\n97\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.690\nI'm not gonna zoom back in because\nthen I'll lose the focus again,\n\n98\n00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.560\nI have to come out and do it again.\n\n99\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.760\nI'm just gonna click through, but I'll\ntell you what's there so you can see it.\n\n100\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.730\nI've highlighted the WS, or\nWSUS rather, Sync Manager.\n\n101\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.820\nI've gone to right click, Show Messages,\nand then I'm pointing to the All option.\n\n102\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.400\nSo I can see all the messages.\n\n103\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.930\nThis effectively is gonna go out and it's\nlike Event Viewer, it's gonna query, or\n\n104\n00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.600\nit will query in a minute as soon as I\nset the time value, we're gonna query\n\n105\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.750\nthe event log for this particular manager,\nin this case the WSUS Sync Manager object,\n\n106\n00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.000\nand pull back all the events that\nhave occurred over a period of time.\n\n107\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.920\nAnd then we're gonna drill in and\ndo a little troubleshooting.\n\n108\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.940\nSo just click All here real quick,\nwe'll get that going.\n\n109\n00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.410\nWe get our status messages,\nset viewing period.\n\n110\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.620\nWe're gonna do that at the default which\nis over the last 24 hours, one day.\n\n111\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.010\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nclick OK for that as well.\n\n112\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.482\nWe'll give that just a second to come up,\nand\n\n113\n00:05:54.482 --> 00:06:00.560\nthen, Let me go to full screen so it'll\nbe a little bit easier to see everything.\n\n114\n00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.970\nAnd I will extend out the descriptor area.\n\n115\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.210\nI'm gonna just move a couple\nof these things over so\n\n116\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.440\nthat we can see a little bit\nmore clearly what's happening.\n\n117\n00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.620\nNot too worried about the site code,\nbecause everything is in the same site.\n\n118\n00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.500\nThey don't have any issue there.\n\n119\n00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.544\nAnd we're really not worried about\ncomponent because we do know what this is,\n\n120\n00:06:21.544 --> 00:06:25.282\nand system cuz we know where we are,\nand date and time because who cares,\n\n121\n00:06:25.282 --> 00:06:26.712\nit's in the past, right?\n\n122\n00:06:26.712 --> 00:06:28.377\nSo I just wanna make it\na little bit easier for\n\n123\n00:06:28.377 --> 00:06:30.540\nus to see some of the things\nthat are on the screen.\n\n124\n00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.960\nSo I'm just gonna extend\nthat out a little bit.\n\n125\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.300\nAll right, so what we're looking for here,\nand we'll zoom in, I'm gonna highlight it\n\n126\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.640\nand I'm gonna hover so\nthat you can see it.\n\n127\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.376\nAnd what you'll see is we have that red X,\nor red circle, white X right there where\n\n128\n00:06:47.376 --> 00:06:52.796\nit says Milestone, and as we scroll over,\nwe can see an event ID of 6703.\n\n129\n00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:54.740\nWould you do me a favor,\nMike, while I'm doing this?\n\n130\n00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.820\nAnd we'll just jump to a live\nGoogle shot here in a minute.\n\n131\n00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.670\nWe can coin that by the way, Google shot.\n\n132\n00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.230\n>> Google shot.\n\n133\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.140\n>> Yeah, that's kind of cool.\n\n134\n00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.420\nI didn't think about that one.\n\n135\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.940\nThat can be a new term that\nwe can use here at ITProTV.\n\n136\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.000\nSo I'd like you to Google for me SSCM 2012\n\n137\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.690\nEvent ID 6703 and then we'll go to\nwhat you see there in a minute.\n\n138\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.770\nSo just show our studio\naudience there the power and\n\n139\n00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.610\nvalue of looking up event IDs or\nin this case, error codes.\n\n140\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.030\nSo we have an error code of 6703, right?\n\n141\n00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.040\nAnd what you'll see now, if we can go back\nto full screen please, what you'll see now\n\n142\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.430\nis you will see that when we scroll over,\nyou will see that we have and\n\n143\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.600\nI've highlighted,\nI've hovered over the actual error so\n\n144\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.750\nit pulls it up fully, cuz we have a little\ndialog line but it kinda trails off.\n\n145\n00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.290\nI'd have to extend this thing out probably\nhalfway to the parking lot to get all that\n\n146\n00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.320\nstuff to come up.\n\n147\n00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.820\nAnd so what we actually do is,\nwe actually can just hover and\n\n148\n00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.250\nthat's the nice thing about the viewer.\n\n149\n00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.148\nWhen we hover, we do get the full pop-out\non whatever the code is there, so\n\n150\n00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:54.754\nthat's nice.\n\n151\n00:07:54.754 --> 00:07:56.088\nWSUS Synchronization failed.\n\n152\n00:07:56.088 --> 00:07:58.171\nWell, okay, that's an issue.\n\n153\n00:07:58.171 --> 00:07:58.671\nBut why did it fail?\n\n154\n00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:00.254\nThis is the trigger.\n\n155\n00:08:00.254 --> 00:08:05.454\nThat tells me, oh, it must be something\nhaving to do with the proxy cuz I keep\n\n156\n00:08:05.454 --> 00:08:10.576\nreading and it says, message WSUS update\nsource not found on the site PLB,\n\n157\n00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:12.800\nwhich is the primary site code.\n\n158\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.000\nPlease refer to the WCM.log,\nI did, go and do that as well and\n\n159\n00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.920\nI looked it up and sure enough,\nI'll see the same information, but\n\n160\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.190\nbasically when it tells me that,\nits telling me that it cannot go out and\n\n161\n00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:28.010\nfind the Microsoft update site,\ncuz we set it to update for Microsoft.\n\n162\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.131\nWell there's only two reasons, three\nreasons in theory, why that would occur.\n\n163\n00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:34.500\nWe have a connectivity problem\nin the physical plane,\n\n164\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.310\nthere's no network access of some kind.\n\n165\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.795\nWe have a communication problem because\nwe're able to get to a certain point, but\n\n166\n00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:45.410\nthen they'll not out beyond that because\nof routing, topology, and or some sort of\n\n167\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.025\nconfiguration, and or we have a credential\nproblem, because maybe the credential\n\n168\n00:08:50.025 --> 00:08:53.750\nwe provided and or the connectivity\ninformation out to the server.\n\n169\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.473\nThis case the proxy server is bad, because\nwe can pretty safely cross off the list\n\n170\n00:08:57.473 --> 00:09:01.035\nthat Microsoft has self-destructed and\nthat they're no longer there, and\n\n171\n00:09:01.035 --> 00:09:04.840\nthat the website has been shut down\nbecause nobody's paying their bill, right?\n\n172\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.739\nSo as a result of that, while in theory it\ncould be that hey, the website is offline\n\n173\n00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:14.870\non the far end, the chances of Microsoft\nUpdate going offline are relatively small.\n\n174\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.990\nSo we're not gonna put that at the top\nof the list of things we'd wanna trouble\n\n175\n00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.547\nshoot first.\n\n176\n00:09:19.547 --> 00:09:23.867\nSo what that tells me is Jen's gonna have\na connectivity problem based on using\n\n177\n00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:24.900\nthe proxy.\n\n178\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.638\nNow if I wasn't using a proxy here,\nI would be looking at other issues for\n\n179\n00:09:28.638 --> 00:09:29.506\nconnectivity?\n\n180\n00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:32.437\nDo we have path,\ndo we have a network failure somewhere,\n\n181\n00:09:32.437 --> 00:09:35.990\nis there a card that went down,\nis there a router that went down.\n\n182\n00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.300\nBut because I'm using the proxy,\nthe first logical choke point.\n\n183\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.500\nThe first logical place where I'm probably\ngonna run into a connectivity issue\n\n184\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.510\nis at that gateway and so that's what it\ntells me when I look at that message.\n\n185\n00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.560\nAnd sure enough we went back and we looked\nand we found that the proxy configuration\n\n186\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.390\ninformation had not been properly\nsynchronized and entered in both places.\n\n187\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.212\nSo as a result of that,\ndoing a little logical troubleshooting,\n\n188\n00:09:58.212 --> 00:09:59.250\nwe can work backwards.\n\n189\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.280\nAnd we actually can figure\nout what's going on.\n\n190\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.890\nNow, I did ask you to\nbring that up real quick.\n\n191\n00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.590\n>> Huh.\n>> What do we have?\n\n192\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.600\nCould we go to Mike's machine for\njust a second, please?\n\n193\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.810\nThank you so much.\n\n194\n00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.870\nAnd what we get there is\ntroubleshooting software updates,\n\n195\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.214\nsoftware update synchronization failures.\n\n196\n00:10:13.214 --> 00:10:16.780\nAnd so, if we and/or the one right below,\neither one would work.\n\n197\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.517\nWhen we click on any one of those,\nwe will find Information that\n\n198\n00:10:20.517 --> 00:10:24.900\nwill help us to understand what the nature\nof these kinds of issues may be.\n\n199\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.864\nCheck for errors, these\nare the things that can go wrong, and\n\n200\n00:10:27.864 --> 00:10:31.120\npotentially these are the places\nwhere you go to look.\n\n201\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.290\nSo this can help us to do a little real\ntime troubleshooting because look,\n\n202\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.100\neven here.\n\n203\n00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.507\nRight?\nWe try to control for\n\n204\n00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:40.080\nall the variables when we set up our\ndemo and lab environments for you.\n\n205\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.062\nTry to make sure things go smoothly,\ntry to pre-load some stuff so\n\n206\n00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:44.297\nwe don't run into issues.\n\n207\n00:10:44.297 --> 00:10:47.820\nBut even then, reality is sometimes\nthings just don't go as planned.\n\n208\n00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.722\n>> Right.\n>> And we've got to be\n\n209\n00:10:48.722 --> 00:10:50.006\nprepared to troubleshoot.\n\n210\n00:10:50.006 --> 00:10:53.320\nAnd while I didn't set this up and\nsay, hey Mike, let's cause it to fail.\n\n211\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.480\nAnd then we can fix it and\ntell them how to troubleshoot.\n\n212\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.730\nReality is you want to take advantage\nof an opportunity like this, right?\n\n213\n00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.250\n>> Absolutely.\n\n214\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.330\n>> And\nsee what happens in the real world and\n\n215\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.220\ntalk about things that go wrong because\nwe want to obviously educate you and\n\n216\n00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.250\nour failure is a great way for us to learn\nand have an experience to learn from.\n\n217\n00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.020\nAnd then, you'll admit our failure.\n\n218\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.290\nAnd blame it on Mike cuz it was his fault\ncuz he should have told me that I should\n\n219\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.410\nhave done that differently.\n\n220\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.790\nAnd now we've learned from that,\n\n221\n00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.850\nwe know we're not gonna let Mike\nconfigure proxy servers any more, and\n\n222\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.200\nwe're now gonna go forward and\nactually pick up where we left off.\n\n223\n00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.546\nSo I just wanted to\nshare that with you and\n\n224\n00:11:22.546 --> 00:11:26.756\njust make sure that you guys had\nthe opportunity to learn from the issue.\n\n225\n00:11:26.756 --> 00:11:29.620\nAnd see us work through it or at least\nhear about how we worked through it.\n\n226\n00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.433\nAnd then as a result of that,\nhopefully if it ever happens to you,\n\n227\n00:11:32.433 --> 00:11:34.800\nyou'll be a little bit better\neducated about what do.\n\n228\n00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.275\nOn this particular issue anyway.\n\n229\n00:11:37.275 --> 00:11:40.135\nSo we're gonna move back I'm just\ngonna change focus on the console.\n\n230\n00:11:40.135 --> 00:11:40.905\nWe're gonna move back and\n\n231\n00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:44.205\npick up with taking our updates\nwhich are now built in the catalog.\n\n232\n00:11:44.205 --> 00:11:44.935\nI'm gonna show you those.\n\n233\n00:11:44.935 --> 00:11:48.385\nAnd we're then gonna go ahead and\nstart patching up.\n\n234\n00:11:48.385 --> 00:11:50.025\nWe go back to full screen please.\n\n235\n00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:53.134\nWhat we're gonna do is go\nback to software libraries,\n\n236\n00:11:53.134 --> 00:11:57.459\nwe're gonna go to our software library\nwork space, and I'll zoom in just so\n\n237\n00:11:57.459 --> 00:12:00.923\nyou can see this, and\nthen we will talk about what's there.\n\n238\n00:12:00.923 --> 00:12:05.733\nBut now, that we have and I'll kinda go\nover here, scroll up just a wee bit and\n\n239\n00:12:05.733 --> 00:12:06.550\nhighlight.\n\n240\n00:12:08.671 --> 00:12:11.523\nNow that we have in our software library,\nand\n\n241\n00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:14.500\nwe have all our software updates selected.\n\n242\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.070\nWe have, as you can see a lot of security\nupdates that have come down now.\n\n243\n00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.100\nFor remember we did the security\nupdates only for server 12.\n\n244\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.840\nWe have those there.\n\n245\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.527\nAnd for every one that we highlight,\n\n246\n00:12:23.527 --> 00:12:26.256\nyou'll notice we get a little\nsummary at the bottom there.\n\n247\n00:12:26.256 --> 00:12:28.200\nTells us what the update is.\n\n248\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.870\nTells us the severity.\n\n249\n00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.960\nTells us the bulletin ID.\n\n250\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.180\nTells us article ID, when it was released.\n\n251\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.714\nThis one's from December of 2014.\n\n252\n00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:38.960\nHas it been superseded?\n\n253\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.640\nNo.\nWe talked about that.\n\n254\n00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.910\nIs it expired?\n\n255\n00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.706\nNo.\nAll right,\n\n256\n00:12:42.706 --> 00:12:44.090\nso we have all that kind of stuff.\n\n257\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.230\nDoes it do NAP evaluation,\nnetwork access protection.\n\n258\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.290\nIt's not doing that so\nit's not gonna be used for that.\n\n259\n00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.113\nWe don't have any statistics on this,\nit has not actually been used and\n\n260\n00:12:53.113 --> 00:12:56.440\ndeployed yet so we have no\ncompliancy baseline information.\n\n261\n00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.650\nBut if we start scanning\nwe'll start to see that.\n\n262\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.670\nWe'll be talking about some of that\nstuff in a future upcoming discussion.\n\n263\n00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.280\nBut we now have the baseline\n\n264\n00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.110\ncatalog that we can use to start\nthinking about deployment.\n\n265\n00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.075\nNow what I want to do is just delve into\none of these updates for a minute and show\n\n266\n00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:16.173\nyou what actually comes down with it when\nyou select one of them from Microsoft.\n\n267\n00:13:16.173 --> 00:13:20.679\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nhighlight one of these updates and I'm\n\n268\n00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:26.150\njust gonna right click, and we'll see that\nwe have some menu options when we do that.\n\n269\n00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.070\nWe can go in and\nwe can create a software update group.\n\n270\n00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.220\nWe're gonna talk about how\nto do that momentarily.\n\n271\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.530\nCreating a software update group allows\nus to batch one or more updates together.\n\n272\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.994\nAgain a logical association\nfrom a organization and\n\n273\n00:13:37.994 --> 00:13:41.690\nfrom the administration prospective,\ncreate a group for those updates, and\n\n274\n00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.839\neffectively apply the group, as opposed to\napplying individual updates one at a time.\n\n275\n00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:47.650\nSo, we'll talk about how to do that.\n\n276\n00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.850\nIt's actually very straightforward.\n\n277\n00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.590\nIt's a real quick process.\n\n278\n00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.930\nWe can go ahead, and we can deploy.\n\n279\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.655\nWe, hopefully, know what deploy means.\n\n280\n00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:56.296\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna take a look in Properties,\n\n281\n00:13:56.296 --> 00:13:58.463\nreal quick, and\njust see what goes on with this update.\n\n282\n00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:03.310\nSo, every update that comes down is\ngonna look like this or very similar.\n\n283\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.680\nAnd akin to this particular look and feel,\nwe have the name of the update up top,\n\n284\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.760\nas you can see.\n\n285\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.757\nWe've got a bunch of tabs there.\n\n286\n00:14:11.757 --> 00:14:16.406\nSoftware update details, max run time,\ncustom severity, content information,\n\n287\n00:14:16.406 --> 00:14:21.220\nsecurity, supersedence information,\nas well as custom bundle information.\n\n288\n00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.300\nAnd on everyone of these,\n\n289\n00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.300\nwe're getting information that\nis populated from Microsoft.\n\n290\n00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.900\nWe have a little overview\non this particular update.\n\n291\n00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.830\nWhat the applicable languages are,\nif there's multilingual support for\n\n292\n00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.970\nit, affected product.\n\n293\n00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.770\nIn this case, this is for Server 12.\n\n294\n00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.990\nWe have the Bulletin ID, so it references\nthe MS ID for the actual bulletin.\n\n295\n00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.200\nAnd then the Article ID for the update.\n\n296\n00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.810\nSo we can see all of that.\n\n297\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:48.010\nWe have on maximum run time,\nthe ability to specify\n\n298\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.320\nhow long this software update\ninstallation has to complete.\n\n299\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.506\nThis is set to 10 minutes, that is\na reasonable amount of time for an update.\n\n300\n00:14:56.506 --> 00:15:00.839\nWe may want to modify that, which is why\nwe have the opportunity to do so here.\n\n301\n00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:02.819\nRemember, some updates may take longer,\n\n302\n00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:05.660\nthat number may not always\nbe 10 when you go and look.\n\n303\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.088\nMicrosoft pre-loads all this but you have\nthe right to change certain settings.\n\n304\n00:15:09.088 --> 00:15:11.971\nAnd again, depending on your environment,\nyou may choose to do that and\n\n305\n00:15:11.971 --> 00:15:13.020\nwant to think about that.\n\n306\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.631\nThat will be up to you.\n\n307\n00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:19.250\nWe could set a custom severity rating for\nthe update.\n\n308\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.430\nWe have it set to none.\n\n309\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:25.370\nWhich means right now it's not set to\nrequired or, oh my God if you don't\n\n310\n00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.310\ninstall this the end of the world\nwill happen, or anything like that.\n\n311\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.510\nBut if you want to you can go in and\nuse Severity Ratings.\n\n312\n00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.070\nNow if you create Severity Ratings\ninside the organization,\n\n313\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.630\nyou can do that if you have some\nsort of data classification and\n\n314\n00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:43.020\non taxonomy solution that allows you\nto rank and prioritize these updates.\n\n315\n00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.989\nAnd you can do that so that you can\nspecify from a priority perspective which\n\n316\n00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:51.336\nupdates should be installed immediately,\nwhich ones may be able to wait a certain\n\n317\n00:15:51.336 --> 00:15:54.297\namount of time,\nthat is totally up to you to decide, but\n\n318\n00:15:54.297 --> 00:15:56.631\nyou can customize all\nthat if you choose to.\n\n319\n00:15:56.631 --> 00:16:00.199\nSo you'll figure that out and\ndecide whether you want to do that.\n\n320\n00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:07.480\nThere is content information here,\nmeaning we see the Content ID.\n\n321\n00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.040\nNotice it says Downloaded, No.\n\n322\n00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.860\nAnd it has Source Path there.\n\n323\n00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.860\nWhat we've done is downloaded the package\ninformation and the meta data if you will.\n\n324\n00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.940\nYou saw a download option\non the shortcut menu.\n\n325\n00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.750\nWhen I right clicked,\n\n326\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:22.410\nthat I purposefully did not explain\ncuz I wanted you to see it here.\n\n327\n00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.760\nSo download on that menu will then go out\nand actually get the whole package and\n\n328\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.030\nallow me to actually use that\nif I want to deploy that.\n\n329\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.580\nBecause imagine how long it would\ntake if we actually tried to download\n\n330\n00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.660\nevery one of those updates and\nsynchronize the entire library one time,\n\n331\n00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.600\nyou're looking at days and days of time\nto build that library immediately.\n\n332\n00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.610\nIt takes long enough as it is,\njust to download all the header and\n\n333\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.860\nmetadata information, let alone actually\ndownloading all these packages.\n\n334\n00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.900\nSo, we don't actually download\nuntil you decide you want it, but\n\n335\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.980\nwe do download the descriptor information,\nthe metadata for it.\n\n336\n00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.950\nSo that's what we're seeing here.\n\n337\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.490\nSo we're just taking a look at that.\n\n338\n00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.910\nWe do have\nCustom Bundle Information if this\n\n339\n00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:10.110\nparticular update was bundled\nwith any other software updates.\n\n340\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:12.980\nOr if we had visible update information,\nin other words.\n\n341\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.020\nDo we have other updates bundled within\nthis, is there other software in there,\n\n342\n00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.010\nwe would see that.\n\n343\n00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.410\nThis is a single standalone update,\nit's got probably one executable and\n\n344\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.720\nan MSI to drive that installation.\n\n345\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.840\nThere's not a whole bunch of stuff\nthat's tasked or sequenced in here.\n\n346\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.090\nSo it shows nothing.\n\n347\n00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.310\nYou may get certain updates, that we\ncall other software, though, and there\n\n348\n00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.190\nmay be bundling, but again, that's driven\nby the venger, not by us, traditionally.\n\n349\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.200\nUnless we're making our own,\nin which case we may do that, and\n\n350\n00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.865\nthen we have supersedence information,\nand this update as we saw,\n\n351\n00:17:41.865 --> 00:17:46.815\nhas not been superseded by anything,\nand does not supersede anything.\n\n352\n00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:49.115\nBut we would get a listing of that again,\n\n353\n00:17:49.115 --> 00:17:54.120\nbased on what Microsoft says this update\ndoes, or is going to do to another update.\n\n354\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.510\nWe can check that and look at that.\n\n355\n00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.860\nSo this is just all the meta data\nthe properties unit information\n\n356\n00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.500\nassociated with the update.\n\n357\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.160\nEveryone of these updates that\ncomes down has this information\n\n358\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.290\nassociated with it and\nwe could through the catalogue and\n\n359\n00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.490\nsee all sorts of interesting\nstuff from there if we chose to.\n\n360\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.600\nFirst thing we're going to do is go in and\n\n361\n00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.010\ncreate a software update\ngroup real quickly.\n\n362\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.230\nSo, I'm going to show you how to do that.\n\n363\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.090\nWe'll just bundle a couple\nupdates together.\n\n364\n00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.180\nReally no big deal.\n\n365\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.680\nThen when we're done with that, we'll take\na single update and we'll patch it up\n\n366\n00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.920\nthrough the Deployment Wizard, and show\nyou how to actually push it out the door.\n\n367\n00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.020\nSo, let's create our\nsoftware update group.\n\n368\n00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.000\nI'm just going to randomly\nchoose a couple updates.\n\n369\n00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.679\nDoesn't really matter which ones we use.\n\n370\n00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.450\nFor demonstration purposes.\n\n371\n00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.930\nSo what I've done is I've gone ahead and\n\n372\n00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.750\nI've just selected those\nthree updates right there.\n\n373\n00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.170\nJust because they're all security updates\nand they're not gonna be specific to .NET\n\n374\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.580\nFramework or anything like that,\nthey're specific to server 12.\n\n375\n00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.920\nSo I'll just group them together logically\nwhich again makes a lot of sense for\n\n376\n00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.450\na software update group.\n\n377\n00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.320\nI'm then gonna right click on them, and\n\n378\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.680\nyou'll notice I can create create a\nsoftware update group out of that bundle,\n\n379\n00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.420\nand that's what I'm about to do right now.\n\n380\n00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.380\nCreate Software Group, all we have to\ndo is give the software group a name.\n\n381\n00:19:20.207 --> 00:19:21.422\nI'm in a sci-fi mood today.\n\n382\n00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:21.923\n>> All right.\n\n383\n00:19:21.923 --> 00:19:24.487\n[LAUGH]\n>> Test Group Alpha 1, so we've got that,\n\n384\n00:19:24.487 --> 00:19:27.810\nand obviously, we give it\na description if we feel we need to.\n\n385\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.010\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click create right down here.\n\n386\n00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.320\nYou can see the create button,\nnot to be confused with the cancel button.\n\n387\n00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.900\nBoth start with C by the way, so we wanna\nmake sure we don't, fall into that trap.\n\n388\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.410\nAnd both have six letters.\n\n389\n00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.260\nI could get so confused so\neasily, it just boggles the mind.\n\n390\n00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.470\nRight?\nSo we're gonna choose create, and\n\n391\n00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.680\ngive that just a second or two,\nit doesn't take very long.\n\n392\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.450\nOnce we get that together, we'll then\nbe able to go over to the software\n\n393\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:01.200\nupdate group area, so we'll just take\na look at the output process, and\n\n394\n00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.850\nwe'll see that we now have a nice little\nhandy dandy software update group,\n\n395\n00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.020\nit will be called test group alpha one.\n\n396\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.730\nWe could see that here,\n\n397\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.240\nup under Software Update Groups,\nTest Group Alpha 1, right there.\n\n398\n00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.320\nSo, we just went ahead and\neffectively created that.\n\n399\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.640\nAnd then that group is going\nto have a creation and\n\n400\n00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.980\nmodification date associated with it.\n\n401\n00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.530\nIt tells us What updates\nare bundled into the group.\n\n402\n00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.435\nSo we can right click on\nthat group if we choose to.\n\n403\n00:20:33.435 --> 00:20:34.010\nAnd we can go in.\n\n404\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:39.790\nAnd we can show members.\n\n405\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.580\nWe can download.\n\n406\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.410\nAgain remember, download implies, go get\nthose patches so we can actually use them.\n\n407\n00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.110\nRun summarization.\n\n408\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.450\nRun Summarization allows us to go out and\ndo a baseline compliance scan\n\n409\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.400\nto see whether or not we have\nmachines that need the patches, so\n\n410\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.390\nthat's what summarization does.\n\n411\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:21:00.260\nRefresh and Delete, those probably do\nnot need much, if any, explanation.\n\n412\n00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.270\nDeploy, which we're gonna do and\ntake a look at in just a second,\n\n413\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.510\nlet's just package that up.\n\n414\n00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:08.030\nAnd then Properties, which show us what's\nactually in the Software Update Group.\n\n415\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:13.210\nNow, the trick with Software Update Groups\nIs that you wanna obviously label them and\n\n416\n00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.130\nset them up in a meaningful way\nnow it's something like you know\n\n417\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.535\ntest group alpha one.\n\n418\n00:21:17.535 --> 00:21:18.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It use a name and\n\n419\n00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.190\nconvention to some sort that actually\nmakes some sense to you so that way\n\n420\n00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.300\nyou can actually can understand whats in\nthere, you have a sense on whats going on.\n\n421\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.860\n>> And it actually will be meaningful,\nright.\n\n422\n00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.860\nSo we just want to make sure we know that.\n\n423\n00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.330\nNow all I did just now was I went ahead,\nand\n\n424\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:41.470\njust chose the first option out of\nthat menu and I chose Show Members.\n\n425\n00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.280\nAnd now you can see the three\nitems that are in the group,\n\n426\n00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.830\nyou can see the group that's highlighted\nright there and we can see all the,\n\n427\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.360\nI'd have to scroll out a little of course,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n428\n00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.150\nYou know what the updates were, we can see\nthe updates there and see what they are.\n\n429\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.190\nSo Show Members will allow us to do that,\nin case you're interested.\n\n430\n00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.180\nAnd as I've always told you and\nI will show you yet again right click on\n\n431\n00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.970\nthe headers on the columns there\nif you want to customize the view.\n\n432\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:09.460\nAnd look at all the other things that\npotentially can be added into the view\n\n433\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.130\nthat are not currently selected.\n\n434\n00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:16.330\nMax runtime in minutes, language,\nlicense terms, date released,\n\n435\n00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:21.230\nbundle update, custom severity,\ndeployable, expired.\n\n436\n00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.690\nRight, we can do all sorts of additional\nstuff to show us what kind of issues and\n\n437\n00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.240\nconcerns, we may wanna\ntrack inside that console.\n\n438\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.740\nRight now we have very limited\nview with only maybe six or\n\n439\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.310\nseven of the column headers selected.\n\n440\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.300\nBut there's probably close to 30\nthat we can potentially bring in.\n\n441\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.250\nNow that would be a great business case\nfor you to go out and put in the PO for\n\n442\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.180\nthe 24 by 48 inch monitor that\nyou will need to see all that.\n\n443\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.850\nPer monitor on the monitor wall as\nyou build out your 72 by 125 inch\n\n444\n00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.250\nmonitor wall.\n\n445\n00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:58.310\nBut the idea would be that, of course,\nif we are using this, all kidding aside.\n\n446\n00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.740\nIf we're setting this up and monitoring\nthis in a for instance, where we're gonna\n\n447\n00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:06.830\nhave a lot screen real estate on an all\nup heads up display up on the wall.\n\n448\n00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.330\nOne of those nice 72 inch or\n90 inch monitors you find.\n\n449\n00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.835\nIn a well financed organization.\n\n450\n00:23:11.835 --> 00:23:12.695\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's right.\n\n451\n00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:13.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> So when you go in and\n\n452\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.740\nyou see those, you know what you're seeing\nis you've got a lot of these columns up on\n\n453\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:21.200\nthe display because they have the room to\ndisplay them without having to scroll and\n\n454\n00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.060\nthey can track the most important ones.\n\n455\n00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.700\n>> Yes.\n>> So I just want to\n\n456\n00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.980\nmake sure that were aware of that.\n\n457\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.750\nThe other thing that we can do of\ncourse and I'm going to do this and\n\n458\n00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.260\nI'm going to zoom in so\nyou can see it and freeze it.\n\n459\n00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.420\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm\ndragging the bulletin ID over and\n\n460\n00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.330\nyou can see I'm going to reorder you\nknow this is a Microsoft console\n\n461\n00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.050\nI can we order those column headers\nas well if I need to to get the view\n\n462\n00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:45.070\nlined up with all the things I want to\nsee prioritized running left to right.\n\n463\n00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.090\nAnd figure out exactly how\nI want to present them.\n\n464\n00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.040\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n465\n00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.558\nYou don't have to do that but since\nwe're in here talking about how to make\n\n466\n00:23:51.558 --> 00:23:54.679\nthe world a little bit easier for\nyou to interact with and manage,\n\n467\n00:23:54.679 --> 00:23:58.200\njust want to make sure you're comfortable\nwith all those little bells and\n\n468\n00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.090\nwhistles that we can allocate in or\ndeal with there.\n\n469\n00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.255\nAll right so we have our software updates.\n\n470\n00:24:03.255 --> 00:24:04.010\nWe're just gonna go back.\n\n471\n00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.923\nGet into there,\nget out of our software group and,\n\n472\n00:24:07.923 --> 00:24:13.720\nI'm going to right click on the first\nsoftware update up at the top.\n\n473\n00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.270\nThis one is just a generic security\nupdate and I'm gonna go in,\n\n474\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.658\nand I'm gonna hit deploy.\n\n475\n00:24:18.658 --> 00:24:22.500\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna run through the deployment wizard.\n\n476\n00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.196\nSo we're gonna click on that,\nand then what we get.\n\n477\n00:24:29.446 --> 00:24:32.760\nIs the deployment wizard here.\n\n478\n00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.040\nYou'll see we have a bunch of\nstuff we have to configure\n\n479\n00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.190\nover here in our navigation area.\n\n480\n00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.870\nSo we're gonna go through those screens,\nshow them to you.\n\n481\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.230\nAnd on this screen,\njust zoom out just a little bit.\n\n482\n00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.290\nWe have the software update information.\n\n483\n00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:51.820\nThere's our software update right there,\nlisted so we know what it is.\n\n484\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.480\nWe do have a deployment\ntemplate that we can select.\n\n485\n00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.860\nAnd, or\na collection that we have to specify.\n\n486\n00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.070\nWe do have to target a collection for\ndeployment,\n\n487\n00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.370\njust like when we do a deployment of\nan application, right in the package.\n\n488\n00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.610\nWe have to target a collection because we\ncan't just throw this stuff out there and\n\n489\n00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.275\nsay hey, you know whoever may want it,\ncome take it.\n\n490\n00:25:10.275 --> 00:25:10.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We gotta say,\n\n491\n00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.690\nwe wanna put it over\nthere on those machines,\n\n492\n00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.445\nas if you could see me doing this\nwhere I'm pointing over there.\n\n493\n00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:18.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The far side of the studio.\n\n494\n00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:18.820\nPut them out there.\n\n495\n00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.770\nSo, we wanna go ahead, and we want to\nbe able to focus in on a collection.\n\n496\n00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.510\nNow this brings up an interesting\nthought process for us,\n\n497\n00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.540\nwhich is, well which collection?\n\n498\n00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.140\nSo this goes back to the idea\nof how smart were we?\n\n499\n00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.990\nAnd remember we've talked about\nthe value of planning and\n\n500\n00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.670\nhow important it is to plan,\nto be successful.\n\n501\n00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.630\nBecause otherwise you wind up planning\nto fail without really realizing\n\n502\n00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.237\nthat you're doing that or meaning to.\n\n503\n00:25:40.237 --> 00:25:44.020\nIf you have not named your collections\nin such a way that you are following\n\n504\n00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:48.114\na standardized naming convention that\ntells you what's in the collections,\n\n505\n00:25:48.114 --> 00:25:49.986\nyou're gonna struggle with this.\n\n506\n00:25:49.986 --> 00:25:53.420\nCuz you're gonna go in and\nsee all systems, right?\n\n507\n00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.500\nAll, undiscovered,\nall unknown things like that.\n\n508\n00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.530\nThe default ones But, if you wanna be\nable, because this is a update that is\n\n509\n00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.590\nspecific to server 12, if you wanna\nbe able to deploy this to server 12,\n\n510\n00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.040\nyou have to know where\nthe server 12 machines are.\n\n511\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.600\nOtherwise, you're gonna spend\na lot of time chasing your tail,\n\n512\n00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.350\ntrying to figure out how to deploy this.\n\n513\n00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:13.450\nSo if you have a collection called all\nserver 12 machines, and all your server 12\n\n514\n00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.790\nmachines are in that collection,\nit'll make life a lot easier for you.\n\n515\n00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:20.460\nSo, think about the fact that out of\nthe box those default collections\n\n516\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.650\ndon't differentiate by operating system.\n\n517\n00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.170\nThey really just group\neverything together,\n\n518\n00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.040\nand what we would want to do is then come\nup with a way to be able to figure out\n\n519\n00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.140\nhow to create additional\ncollections that will then allow us\n\n520\n00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.080\nto be able to actually start\nsegmenting out our population, right.\n\n521\n00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.590\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n522\n00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.490\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to browse for a collection.\n\n523\n00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.547\nAnd we will see here that we have our, and\n\n524\n00:26:43.547 --> 00:26:47.810\nI'll just zoom in so you could see,\nour focuses on device collections, right.\n\n525\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:51.700\nBecause remember,\nwe're not gonna be distributing and, or\n\n526\n00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.360\ndeploying security patch updates to users,\nright.\n\n527\n00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:55.950\n>> Unfortunately.\n\n528\n00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:56.815\n>> I was gonna say, unfortunately.\n\n529\n00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:57.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would be a cool little\n\n530\n00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.590\nnew feature.\n\n531\n00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.430\nHey let me fix that attitude issue for\nyou, I've got a patch for that, right.\n\n532\n00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.190\nWe could deploy that right now.\n\n533\n00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.275\nComes with a big hammer, and some tape.\n\n534\n00:27:05.275 --> 00:27:07.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But since we are deploying these two\n\n535\n00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.730\nsystems, we only have the device\ncollection option there.\n\n536\n00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.980\nAnd as I said, since we do not\nhave any custom collections\n\n537\n00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.260\ncreated in the demo environment,\nwe just have our built-in ones.\n\n538\n00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.500\nNow we could obviously go in and\ncreate a custom collection.\n\n539\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.050\nAnd if we did that,\nit would show up on the list, and\n\n540\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.570\nwe would then be able to do that.\n\n541\n00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.040\nBut we're just gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna choose all systems.\n\n542\n00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.100\nSo I'm just gonna to go ahead and\nhighlight all systems, and select that.\n\n543\n00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.860\nWe'll click OK.\n\n544\n00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:39.388\nAnd now we have made a choice\nin terms of our collections.\n\n545\n00:27:39.388 --> 00:27:42.640\nSo we've kinda specified okay, I want it\nto go here and this is what I want to do.\n\n546\n00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.510\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n547\n00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.840\nNow keep in mind, right,\nin production we would\n\n548\n00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.070\nprobably never deploy a patch\nto the all systems collection,\n\n549\n00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.640\nbecause that's gonna include\nevery system we've discovered.\n\n550\n00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.530\nAll the workstations, all the servers,\nall the mixed operating systems.\n\n551\n00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.720\nThat would probably end badly, right?\n\n552\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.540\nSo we would not do this.\n\n553\n00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.910\nThis is really just for testing purposes.\n\n554\n00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:08.670\nTo demonstrate for you, wanna be\nclear about that in the real world.\n\n555\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.900\nAs we said, you would choose the\ncollection that is most closely aligned\n\n556\n00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.390\nwith the specification of the patch\nthat we are deploying, just to be clear.\n\n557\n00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:20.998\nAlright, so we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose next here.\n\n558\n00:28:20.998 --> 00:28:23.220\nReset our timer.\n\n559\n00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.190\nAnd we are going to go ahead and\n\n560\n00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.300\nwe're gonna get on to\nthe deployment settings screen.\n\n561\n00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.170\nJust zoom in so you guys can see that.\n\n562\n00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.360\nWe have type of deployment required.\n\n563\n00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:38.440\nAre we gonna use Wake-on-LAN to\nbe able to do that deployment?\n\n564\n00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.000\nState message detail level.\n\n565\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.800\nWhat kind of detail do we\nwant to see around this?\n\n566\n00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.040\nYou'll return by clients for the software.\n\n567\n00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.110\nOnly success in error.\n\n568\n00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:50.150\nSo we can you know, manipulate\nthe alerting and the logging, and\n\n569\n00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.250\nmanipulate the kind of deployment.\n\n570\n00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:58.120\nYou know the other option there is that\nwe have available as well as required.\n\n571\n00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.085\nWe've talked about the difference.\n\n572\n00:28:59.085 --> 00:28:59.880\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Between these before,\n\n573\n00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.950\njust showing you that.\n\n574\n00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.100\nSo since this is a security update,\n\n575\n00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.930\nchances are good we're gonna\nprobably make that required.\n\n576\n00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.790\nSo we're just gonna\nwanna keep that in mind.\n\n577\n00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.770\nThat, you know, just know that most\nlikely that is gonna be a good choice.\n\n578\n00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.140\nAnd that's the default, by the way.\n\n579\n00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.050\nCuz most of these are gonna\nbe required patches.\n\n580\n00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.400\nYou're not gonna opt out of\ndoing the security update, or\n\n581\n00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.625\nyou wouldn't bother to patch\nit up in the first place.\n\n582\n00:29:18.625 --> 00:29:20.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Really no reason to do that\n\n583\n00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:21.150\nwhen you think about it.\n\n584\n00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.850\nSo now we're on our scheduling page,\nand what we're gonna do is go ahead and\n\n585\n00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:29.180\ndecide how quickly we wanna\nget this thing deployed.\n\n586\n00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.820\nWe have an as soon as\npossible option here.\n\n587\n00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.610\nNow we have time based\non local client time, so\n\n588\n00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.430\nwe can localize that\ndeployment if we choose to.\n\n589\n00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.475\nWe have the ability to do,\noh, did I, yes I did.\n\n590\n00:29:41.475 --> 00:29:42.679\nThere we go.\n\n591\n00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:43.750\nYeah, okay.\n\n592\n00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.276\nI hit that arrow.\n\n593\n00:29:44.276 --> 00:29:46.253\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n>> Or I hit the other button for\n\n594\n00:29:46.253 --> 00:29:47.940\nfreeze and mark.\n\n595\n00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.370\nWe could see as soon as possible there for\n\n596\n00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.920\nthe software available time and\ninstallation deadline.\n\n597\n00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.590\nWe could specify not just, hey,\ndo it as soon as possible, but install by.\n\n598\n00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.900\n>> And in fact we say okay by the way,\nby this day and\n\n599\n00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.060\ntime, wanna make sure we got it in there,\notherwise bad things happen.\n\n600\n00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.485\nSo we have the option to\nbe incredibly prescriptive.\n\n601\n00:30:08.485 --> 00:30:10.780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And focused on how this is gonna occur.\n\n602\n00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.095\nWe're gonna accept our defaults here.\n\n603\n00:30:13.095 --> 00:30:15.800\nWe're gonna do as soon as possible.\n\n604\n00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.970\nAnd we've got a date in the future\nthere one week out for the deployment.\n\n605\n00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.450\nSo we're not gonna worry\ntoo much about that,\n\n606\n00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.665\nbecause by then I will no longer be\ntalking with you about doing this.\n\n607\n00:30:24.665 --> 00:30:27.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I will actually be somewhere else doing\n\n608\n00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.360\nsomething else, and\nit will be totally unrelated to this.\n\n609\n00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.190\n>> But the update would be out by then.\n\n610\n00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.712\n>> But if not.\n\n611\n00:30:32.712 --> 00:30:34.892\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> it would stop because we've specified\n\n612\n00:30:34.892 --> 00:30:36.745\na drop dead date one week in the future.\n\n613\n00:30:36.745 --> 00:30:39.460\nBut I'm no longer gonna be around and\nconcerned about that so\n\n614\n00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.312\nI'm not gonna care.\n\n615\n00:30:40.312 --> 00:30:43.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so we're gonna click next.\n\n616\n00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:47.500\nAnd we are going to get on to\nour user experience screen.\n\n617\n00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.980\nOur user experience screen is gonna\nallow us to effectively take a look at\n\n618\n00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.540\nsome of the options associated\nwith user notifications.\n\n619\n00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:00.010\nI'll just pull that down so you can kinda\nsee the options there as we scroll in.\n\n620\n00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:04.920\nSo you'll see here, display in software,\ncenter, and show all notifications.\n\n621\n00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.780\nDisplay and show notifications for\neverything, and computer restarts.\n\n622\n00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.390\nHide in software center,\nand don't show anything.\n\n623\n00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.970\nYou know my preferences.\n\n624\n00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.185\nI don't care about users, so.\n\n625\n00:31:14.185 --> 00:31:15.362\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> As far as I'm concerned,\n\n626\n00:31:15.362 --> 00:31:16.875\nthey need to know nothing, right.\n\n627\n00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:17.473\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n628\n00:31:17.473 --> 00:31:20.815\nyeah we would display in software\ncenter show notifications.\n\n629\n00:31:20.815 --> 00:31:24.565\nThat lets users know that things are going\non, that patches are being applied.\n\n630\n00:31:24.565 --> 00:31:28.085\nYou choose that based on what your\nsettings are in the organization from\n\n631\n00:31:28.085 --> 00:31:29.150\na policy perspective.\n\n632\n00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.475\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Do you notify users, do you not?\n\n633\n00:31:31.475 --> 00:31:32.425\nTotally up to you.\n\n634\n00:31:32.425 --> 00:31:35.995\nNo right and wrong here at all by the way,\ntotally up to you to decide.\n\n635\n00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:41.740\nWe also have when installation deadline\nis reached, what are we gonna do?\n\n636\n00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.910\nAre we going to do the software update\ninstallation, and do restart if necessary?\n\n637\n00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:49.180\nSo when that expiration date hits,\na week from now or whenever we set,\n\n638\n00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.440\nit is a week by default.\n\n639\n00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.850\nBecause remember our magic number is seven\ndays for almost everything we do here.\n\n640\n00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.355\nWhat will happen then is that\nsoftware updates, and or\n\n641\n00:31:57.355 --> 00:31:59.421\nsystem restarts can be forced.\n\n642\n00:31:59.421 --> 00:32:03.142\nSo you may have a lot of remote systems\nthat are running and nobody's on, and\n\n643\n00:32:03.142 --> 00:32:06.980\nyou may not have been able to do\nan install for a variety of reasons.\n\n644\n00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.200\nThat will now force that system\nnot only to do an update, but\n\n645\n00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.590\nto restart if we check off those boxes.\n\n646\n00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.480\nSo we have that, and\nthen device restart behavior,\n\n647\n00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.580\nwe actually can suppress restart on\nthe following devices, servers and\n\n648\n00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.610\nor workstations, because remember,\nthat may be important as well.\n\n649\n00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.880\nIf we're outside a maintenance window and,\nor during business hours,\n\n650\n00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.000\nwe may not be able to do a restart easily.\n\n651\n00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.970\nSo that is something to think about,\nright?\n\n652\n00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.470\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Yeah, definitely important for\n\n653\n00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.400\nus to know.\n\n654\n00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:38.050\nAnd then write filter handling for\nWindows Embedded devices, if we\n\n655\n00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:42.600\nare using embedded devices, this will be a\nWindows CE, like a point of sales system.\n\n656\n00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.880\nYou know, something like that.\n\n657\n00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.530\nA lot of times you go to hotels.\n\n658\n00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.430\nI don't know if you ever noticed this when\nyou're checking in, but I'm that nosy\n\n659\n00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.510\nperson that leans over the counter and\ngoes, hey, what are you doing over there?\n\n660\n00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:52.380\nWhat's going on with that?\n\n661\n00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.690\nWhat kind of OS are you running?\n\n662\n00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.664\nRight, by the way,\ndon't walk up to police officers and\n\n663\n00:32:55.664 --> 00:32:57.944\nask them that same question while\nthey're sitting in their car.\n\n664\n00:32:57.944 --> 00:33:00.000\nThey get really freaked out about that.\n\n665\n00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.670\nBut you see a lot of these\nlaptops in patrol cars as well.\n\n666\n00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.580\nAnd I actually have a couple of customers,\nwe do a lot of government training, and\n\n667\n00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.180\nI have a lot of customers that\nare municipal governments, local city and\n\n668\n00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.140\ncounty governments.\n\n669\n00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.810\nWe do all typically the public\nsafety training for them as well.\n\n670\n00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:16.620\nSo I actually get to find out a lot about\nhow they do their deployments, how they're\n\n671\n00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.010\nmanaging their fleets, and most of those\nlaptops are actually managed through\n\n672\n00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.500\nSystem Center, if they're being managed on\nWindows infrastructure, believe it or not.\n\n673\n00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.470\nSo it's just interesting.\n\n674\n00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.790\nYou get to find out about a lot of little\nbells and whistles that they are using.\n\n675\n00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:31.960\nBut this particular issue right here\nis for something like a hotel system,\n\n676\n00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.310\nwhere a lot of times, they're not running\na full version of Windows the way we would\n\n677\n00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.790\nthink of Windows,\nlike what we run on our desktop.\n\n678\n00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:43.190\nInstead, they're running an embedded\nsolution, a Windows CE solution.\n\n679\n00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:47.780\nWhich is really designed for retail point\nof sale, those res systems, reservation\n\n680\n00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.644\nsystems, medical companies may do some\nof this and hospitals, things like that.\n\n681\n00:33:51.644 --> 00:33:54.920\nWhere they're running a limited\nversion which is really just running\n\n682\n00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.285\ntheir applications and\na couple of other things.\n\n683\n00:33:57.285 --> 00:33:59.780\nIt's not a full featured version\nof Windows the way we would use.\n\n684\n00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.405\nSo in those Win CE Embedded devices,\n\n685\n00:34:02.405 --> 00:34:05.760\na lot of times, the handheld tablets\nare used to do the scanning for\n\n686\n00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.520\ninventory, like the wireless bar code and\nall that kind of stuff, all run Win CE.\n\n687\n00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.780\nThey run embedded device\noperating systems.\n\n688\n00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.780\nSo, we can manage those with\nSystem Center ConfigMgr as well,\n\n689\n00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.528\nbecause they are Windows based devices.\n\n690\n00:34:17.528 --> 00:34:20.740\nWe do wanna account for them and\nmanage them, but they do need to be\n\n691\n00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.680\npatch matters because they are running\nWindows, just a different version.\n\n692\n00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.180\nSo we have to think about how\nto commit the changes for that.\n\n693\n00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.470\nAnd so we have the option here and\nit is selected by default as you can see.\n\n694\n00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:31.665\nCommit changes at deadline or\nduring a maintenance window,\n\n695\n00:34:31.665 --> 00:34:35.270\nit probably requires a restart to\ndo that so we're setting that up so\n\n696\n00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.160\nwe can actually push those if that\npatch is appropriate for that OS.\n\n697\n00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.870\nPush it in there and to do that as well.\n\n698\n00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.850\nSo we're just controlling how these\nthings are gonna happen here.\n\n699\n00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:50.070\nSo we have a lot of interesting little\nareas to think about and focus on here.\n\n700\n00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:54.570\nSo we're gonna specify all that,\nwe'll just check off those check\n\n701\n00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:59.000\nboxes just to make sure that\nwe have everything organized.\n\n702\n00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.500\nWe'll hit next.\n\n703\n00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.040\nThen we have our configuration\nmanager alert screen.\n\n704\n00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.070\nWhen do we wanna generate alerts?\n\n705\n00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.510\nUnder what conditions?\n\n706\n00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:12.620\nIf we're having some sort of a problem\nwith the install, so we can specify that.\n\n707\n00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.480\nThat way we are notified if\nsomething were to go wrong.\n\n708\n00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.990\nClient compliance is below\nthe following percent.\n\n709\n00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.170\nSo if we see that across the board,\n\n710\n00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.450\nwe only have 25% of our\nclients that have met this.\n\n711\n00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.500\nThen we would generate\nan alert in the console, and\n\n712\n00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.170\nsay, hey, you're below the threshold\ntargeted for this deployment.\n\n713\n00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.760\nPay attention, maybe go out and do some\nfact finding, find out what's going on.\n\n714\n00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.730\nMaybe a bunch of people\nturned their machines off.\n\n715\n00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:38.950\nOver a long holiday break and were told\nto leave them on and they didn't do that.\n\n716\n00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.050\nAnd now we can't patch them.\n\n717\n00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.070\nNot because they're asleep but\nbecause they're actually off.\n\n718\n00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.270\nAnd we may have to go in and\nmanually cycle them.\n\n719\n00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.630\nSo this could be valuable to keep track\nof that kind of stuff, right, in theory.\n\n720\n00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.390\nOr aliens could have come and\njust stolen all the machines,\n\n721\n00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.090\nand we may not have them anymore.\n\n722\n00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.720\nThat could also be an issue, right?\n\n723\n00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.900\nSo we also have operation manager alerts.\n\n724\n00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.800\nWe've taken a look at this when\nwe did software packaging and\n\n725\n00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.350\ndeployment in a prior episode.\n\n726\n00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:05.320\nI talked about the fact we can integrate\nthis with SCOM, System Center Ops Manager.\n\n727\n00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.270\nAnd if we are integrating Config Manager\nand Ops Manager together and\n\n728\n00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.935\nwe get the power of that platform really\nbeing scaled out to do monitoring.\n\n729\n00:36:13.935 --> 00:36:17.305\nWe then would be able to interact\nwith Operations Manager and\n\n730\n00:36:17.305 --> 00:36:22.365\ndeal with the alerting and deal with the\nfact that you may either wanna create or\n\n731\n00:36:22.365 --> 00:36:24.565\nnot create alerts based on\ncertain things happening.\n\n732\n00:36:24.565 --> 00:36:26.585\nSo we have opt in and\nopt out options here for that.\n\n733\n00:36:27.945 --> 00:36:29.835\nSo we just wanna keep\nthat in mind as well.\n\n734\n00:36:29.835 --> 00:36:30.710\nWhoops.\n\n735\n00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:31.300\nThere we go.\n\n736\n00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.760\nKeep that in mind as well.\n\n737\n00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.280\nI guess it doesn't work as good when you\nonly hit one of the two keys to toggle\n\n738\n00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.100\nback and forth as opposed to both.\n\n739\n00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:41.192\nSo we may decide that we wanna generate\nan alert, so I'll just go ahead and\n\n740\n00:36:41.192 --> 00:36:42.644\nI'll check that off, and\n\n741\n00:36:42.644 --> 00:36:46.520\nwe'll say at 95% offset from\nthe deadline time of seven days.\n\n742\n00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.320\nSo we'll just take a look at that.\n\n743\n00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.890\nOkay, we'll go ahead,\nwe'll hit next there.\n\n744\n00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:57.130\nThen, we have our deployment options and\nour download settings, specifically.\n\n745\n00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:58.040\nSo let's zoom in so\n\n746\n00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.730\nyou could see these, and then we'll\ntalk about what we're going to do here.\n\n747\n00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.570\nSo, we are right here\non download settings,\n\n748\n00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.320\nwe're getting close to the bottom\nof the list as you can see,\n\n749\n00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.600\nbut still have some interesting stuff and\nimportant stuff to go, right?\n\n750\n00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.340\nYou guys don't have anywhere to be for\nlike the next, I don't know, two hours or\n\n751\n00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:11.900\nanything, do you?\n\n752\n00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.930\nCuz I'm gonna take my time, and\nI'm gonna just take a walk,\n\n753\n00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:21.300\nstroll slowly but\nsurely down memory lane here and\n\n754\n00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.778\ntalk about all these settings and\nthings like that.\n\n755\n00:37:23.778 --> 00:37:27.730\nSo we're gonna select the deployment\noption here, and what you're gonna see is\n\n756\n00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:33.690\nthat we need to go in and\nspecify what deployment options.\n\n757\n00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:35.690\nDo not install software updates or\n\n758\n00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:38.120\ndownload software updates from\nthe distribution point and install.\n\n759\n00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.840\nIn other words, select the option where\nto use when the client specifically, and\n\n760\n00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.790\nthis is important to note, is on a slow or\nunreliable network boundary.\n\n761\n00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.230\nIn other words,\nyour normally well connected clients,\n\n762\n00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.290\nwe're gonna wanna download that update and\ninstall automatically,\n\n763\n00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:52.740\nnot even think twice about it.\n\n764\n00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.560\nBut if we're on a slow network\nwith unreliable bandwidth,\n\n765\n00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.310\nwe may not wanna stream, I don't know,\na couple hundred megs worth of updates,\n\n766\n00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:04.140\nwhatever it may be, and as a result\nof that, we actually can opt out.\n\n767\n00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.550\nNow the logical question then becomes,\nso hey, smart person.\n\n768\n00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.565\nHow do we actually know it's slow?\n\n769\n00:38:09.565 --> 00:38:11.955\nDoes Microsoft magically figure that out?\n\n770\n00:38:11.955 --> 00:38:13.235\nDo they use the force?\n\n771\n00:38:13.235 --> 00:38:14.830\nActually I've had a student\nask me that once in class.\n\n772\n00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.652\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do we use the force to figure that out?\n\n773\n00:38:17.652 --> 00:38:20.005\nThey were very contrite, very serious.\n\n774\n00:38:20.005 --> 00:38:22.847\nI tried to be serious about my answer, but\n\n775\n00:38:22.847 --> 00:38:27.227\nit was hard not to laugh cuz that was just\nsuch a crazy way of thinking about things.\n\n776\n00:38:27.227 --> 00:38:29.227\nBut no,\nwe just to take that one off the table,\n\n777\n00:38:29.227 --> 00:38:32.227\nwe do not use the force,\nin case anybody was wondering.\n\n778\n00:38:32.227 --> 00:38:35.467\nThat's a future service pack update,\nhasn't come out yet.\n\n779\n00:38:35.467 --> 00:38:37.937\nComing soon to a galaxy near you,\nbut not right now.\n\n780\n00:38:37.937 --> 00:38:40.540\nBut no, what we do,\nit's actually kind of interesting.\n\n781\n00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.660\nWe do a couple of things.\n\n782\n00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.520\nSo remember, we rely on boundaries.\n\n783\n00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:48.166\nRight, we've talked about the value\nboundaries and the active directory site\n\n784\n00:38:48.166 --> 00:38:51.838\nboundaries that are used are going\nto be set up, and remember,\n\n785\n00:38:51.838 --> 00:38:56.986\nautomatically generated and managed by the\nactive directory configuration process.\n\n786\n00:38:56.986 --> 00:39:01.956\nThat when we do an install and\nadd domains and name spaces in,\n\n787\n00:39:01.956 --> 00:39:08.694\nwill then populate those boundaries but\nwe have the topology site ITSG I believe.\n\n788\n00:39:08.694 --> 00:39:09.733\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> The Inter-Site Topology [CROSSTALK]\n\n789\n00:39:09.733 --> 00:39:10.810\nReplication Site Generator,\nwhatever it's called.\n\n790\n00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:14.100\nI think it's called ITSG if I\nremember correctly from years ago.\n\n791\n00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:18.750\nBut the automation process that\ngoes on under the hood between\n\n792\n00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:22.110\nthe domain controllers which\nare talking to each other and\n\n793\n00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.870\ntrying to figure out who's where.\n\n794\n00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:29.840\nAnd then ultimately the process of\nsetting all of those site connections up.\n\n795\n00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.825\nOh, it's\nthe Inter-Site Topology Generator, ISTG.\n\n796\n00:39:32.825 --> 00:39:35.400\nInter-Site Topology Generator\nis what it's called.\n\n797\n00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.460\nAnd so what happens is we\nautomatically monitor that.\n\n798\n00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:43.780\nAnd then there's an automatic active\ndirectory replication monitor, ReptoMon,\n\n799\n00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.710\nthat runs as well behind the scenes and\n\n800\n00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:49.240\nis managing that whole process\nto set up AV replication.\n\n801\n00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.212\nRemember, we piggy back on top of that.\n\n802\n00:39:51.212 --> 00:39:55.480\nWe know when those site connectors are\ngoing in and are using good bandwidth or\n\n803\n00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.090\nare not using good bandwidth in the sense\nthat they're below a certain threshold.\n\n804\n00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:03.430\nNow we can play with those settings,\nwe actually can modify them.\n\n805\n00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:08.443\nSo we can manually adjust what\na minimum bandwidth threshold is.\n\n806\n00:40:08.443 --> 00:40:11.850\nBy default, if we are below,\n\n807\n00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:16.410\nI believe it is still 128k,\nit used to be 128k.\n\n808\n00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:21.040\nMaybe it'd be 64k now cuz we're optimized\na lot better today than we used to be.\n\n809\n00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.620\nBut I believe it's somewhere around 128k,\nto maybe as low as 50k,\n\n810\n00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.710\nthat is the default on\nthe bandwidth on the connection.\n\n811\n00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:31.750\nIf we're at that level, or above,\n\n812\n00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.838\nwe are considered to have\ngood reliable bandwidth.\n\n813\n00:40:33.838 --> 00:40:37.850\nIf we are below that level, then the\nsystem says, oh this is a bad connection,\n\n814\n00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:41.140\nit is low speed and\nthen we mark the boundary as such.\n\n815\n00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.520\nSo we're playing off that whole process\non the AD side with the topology site\n\n816\n00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.220\ngenerator and the measurement of\nthe connectivity on that link.\n\n817\n00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.560\nNow, the measurement is done\nby Microsoft across the wire.\n\n818\n00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.130\nThere's an algorithm it's used to run to\nfigure out exactly how much bandwidth we\n\n819\n00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.285\nhave, what kind of connectivity we have,\nand what that looks like, and\n\n820\n00:40:59.285 --> 00:41:03.140\nthat's part of that replication monitor,\nauto generation process that takes place.\n\n821\n00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.270\nSo we're not really involved in that but\n\n822\n00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:09.740\nwe can hard code the minimum threshold\nthat we wanna see good connectivity at.\n\n823\n00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.500\nNormally we set that to\nsomewhere between 128 and\n\n824\n00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.850\n512K but that's up to us based on\nthe kind of bandwidth that we're using.\n\n825\n00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.730\nAnd we may or may not choose to\nactually use that guidance and\n\n826\n00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.880\ngo out and manipulate that, or\nwe may just leave it alone and\n\n827\n00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.030\nlet the default system values kick in and\nkinda manage that on their own.\n\n828\n00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.360\nBut that's what we're talking about\nhere with low bandwith connections,\n\n829\n00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.820\nit's gonna be based on that management\ntopology and how we generate that.\n\n830\n00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.730\nSo, that's what we're seeing here, and\n\n831\n00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:37.000\nthen when software updates are not\navailable on a preferred distribution\n\n832\n00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.680\npoint, we could see that we have\nthe option, it's either not installed.\n\n833\n00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.380\nCould we go back to the full screen again\ncuz we're kinda cutting, thank you.\n\n834\n00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.330\nJust cutting some of that off,\nit's hard to see while we're talking, so\n\n835\n00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.950\nwe could see there either not available or\n\n836\n00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:50.100\nare not available on any\npreferred distribution point.\n\n837\n00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.295\nAnd we hadn't really talked about\ndistribution points from a preferred,\n\n838\n00:41:53.295 --> 00:41:56.980\nnot-preferred perspective yet, but\nthe idea is that we can actually\n\n839\n00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.240\nspecify that certain distribution points\nare preferred for distributing things,\n\n840\n00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.960\nbecause geographically they're located\nclose to the majority of our clients.\n\n841\n00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.640\nThey're within the site boundary, so\na preferred distribution point is one that\n\n842\n00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.370\nis within the site boundary, a external or\na fallback source location for content.\n\n843\n00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:18.040\nA non preferred distribution point is one\nthat is typically outside of the site\n\n844\n00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.180\nboundary and again we're thinking about\nwell connected, not well connected,\n\n845\n00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.040\nclose, and therefore able to stream\nquickly, not able to stream because it's\n\n846\n00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.420\nacross a boundary that may involve\na firewall, may involve several hops,\n\n847\n00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.590\nthere's different scenarios\nthat we would see there.\n\n848\n00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.990\nSo we can control that behavior as well,\ndo not install software updates or\n\n849\n00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:38.030\ndownload and install from the fallback\ncontent source if it's not available.\n\n850\n00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.980\nMeaning, go to the alternate one and\nstream it in from outside, so\n\n851\n00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.200\nwe wanna be thinking about that.\n\n852\n00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:48.100\nAllow clients to share content with\nother clients on the same subnet.\n\n853\n00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.410\nWe can actually cache this download\nlocally on clients, and then\n\n854\n00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:57.150\nget it out to them directly from those\nclients in the same subnet in a pinch.\n\n855\n00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.670\nSo that way,\n\n856\n00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:01.120\nwe may not all have access to the\ndistribution point, cuts down on traffic,\n\n857\n00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.150\ncuts down on the need to be able to worry\nabout that good or bad connectivity.\n\n858\n00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.920\nSo again,\ncan just be thinking about that, and\n\n859\n00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.855\nwe have allowed clients\nat the bottom there.\n\n860\n00:43:09.855 --> 00:43:14.055\nOn metered internet connections to\ndownload content after install deadline\n\n861\n00:43:14.055 --> 00:43:18.615\nwhich might incur as you can see\nadditional costs, remember those clients\n\n862\n00:43:18.615 --> 00:43:21.925\ntypically are not going to connect all the\ntime, are probably coming in on something\n\n863\n00:43:21.925 --> 00:43:26.602\nlike a tethered option with maybe\na cellphone as their connectivity device.\n\n864\n00:43:26.602 --> 00:43:29.202\nAnd so as a result they may\nconnect sporadically and\n\n865\n00:43:29.202 --> 00:43:31.762\nthey may not connect during\nthe distribution window.\n\n866\n00:43:31.762 --> 00:43:33.422\n>> Right.\n>> We can allow them to opt out and\n\n867\n00:43:33.422 --> 00:43:36.932\nactually get those updates after the fact\nbut we're being sensitive to the fact that\n\n868\n00:43:36.932 --> 00:43:39.462\nthere may be bandwidth charges\nthat we have to incur there.\n\n869\n00:43:39.462 --> 00:43:42.032\nSo have a lot of stuff going on and again,\n\n870\n00:43:42.032 --> 00:43:47.400\nthis is all going to be on our\ndownload settings area, right there.\n\n871\n00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.700\nSo that's one of the key pages, right,\nthat we're going to spend a little time on\n\n872\n00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:56.100\nand really think about with regards to how\nwe want to actually go in and set this up.\n\n873\n00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.390\nSo, do not install software updates,\nif we are on a low bandwidth connection,\n\n874\n00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.340\nis the default, so want to just\nmake sure that we're aware of that.\n\n875\n00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:08.220\nMake sure that download and install\nsoftware updates from the fallback or\n\n876\n00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.960\nupdates from the fallback content\nsource location is our default there\n\n877\n00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.830\nwhere the primary or the preferred\ndistribution point is not available.\n\n878\n00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:18.560\nAgain those are the defaults,\njust wanna make sure we're aware of those.\n\n879\n00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.370\nAnd allow clients to share content\nwith others on the same subnet.\n\n880\n00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.250\nAlso selected, all three defaults.\n\n881\n00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.350\nWhy am I saying default\ndefault default over again?\n\n882\n00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:31.860\nMaybe because it's important to know that\ncertain settings, the default settings.\n\n883\n00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.430\nIf anyone were to ever ask you about them,\nfor instance.\n\n884\n00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:37.150\n>> When would they ask me about these?\n\n885\n00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:39.020\n>> You know, surprisingly enough.\n\n886\n00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.860\nWhen I went to Starbucks to get my\ncoffee earlier, while we were waiting on\n\n887\n00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:47.970\nthe synchronization to occur,\nI actually got asked that very question.\n\n888\n00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.250\nRight before they said would\nyou like to pay for your Dopio?\n\n889\n00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.790\nThey said you can only do that if you can\ntell me what the three default settings\n\n890\n00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:57.810\nare when you're configuring\nFCCM update deployments and\n\n891\n00:44:57.810 --> 00:44:59.590\nyou're on the deployment settings page.\n\n892\n00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:03.410\nAnd luckily, I knew what they were so\nI was able to give my money away.\n\n893\n00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.710\nOtherwise I would have\nto have kept my money.\n\n894\n00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.835\nAnd I would not have been able to pay for\nmy coffee.\n\n895\n00:45:07.835 --> 00:45:09.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n896\n00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.880\nthat's why it's important to\nknow what the updates are.\n\n897\n00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.570\n>> That's good.\n\n898\n00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:13.470\n>> Right?\nCuz now I'm richer for\n\n899\n00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.225\nmy knowledge but\npoorer because I actually had to pay.\n\n900\n00:45:16.225 --> 00:45:16.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For my coffee.\n\n901\n00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:22.015\nSo just so you know that is why and\nwhere you may be asked about that, right.\n\n902\n00:45:22.015 --> 00:45:23.025\nWhy would they ask that?\n\n903\n00:45:23.025 --> 00:45:23.555\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> Why?\n\n904\n00:45:23.555 --> 00:45:24.995\nWhy would you want to know?\n\n905\n00:45:24.995 --> 00:45:26.175\nThink about the logic of that.\n\n906\n00:45:26.175 --> 00:45:29.445\nYou're gonna want to know obviously,\nif you're playing geek trivia, and\n\n907\n00:45:29.445 --> 00:45:32.587\nthat's gonna be the trump card for\nyou to win that particular round.\n\n908\n00:45:32.587 --> 00:45:34.072\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n909\n00:45:34.072 --> 00:45:36.192\nso what else do we see\nhere next screen down?\n\n910\n00:45:36.192 --> 00:45:37.772\nWe have deployment package.\n\n911\n00:45:37.772 --> 00:45:40.132\nAnd we have to specify\nour deployment package.\n\n912\n00:45:40.132 --> 00:45:44.162\nNow notice we do have an option to select\na deployment package if one already\n\n913\n00:45:44.162 --> 00:45:46.382\nexists, but\nwe're probably going to create a new one.\n\n914\n00:45:46.382 --> 00:45:48.537\nNow we've done deployment\npackage before if you remember.\n\n915\n00:45:48.537 --> 00:45:50.452\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So we're going to create a package,\n\n916\n00:45:50.452 --> 00:45:53.360\nwe'll give it a name, and we'll go\nthrough this process in just a minute.\n\n917\n00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.410\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n918\n00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:58.890\nwe will specify by going on a browsing\nto a path with package sources.\n\n919\n00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.790\nThat's gonna be where the update is,\nand we're gonna specify that.\n\n920\n00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.810\nAnd then what sending priority do we want?\n\n921\n00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:07.770\nThe sending priority is gonna be, you\nknow, how priority point of perspective,\n\n922\n00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:08.830\nlow, medium high.\n\n923\n00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.050\nHow do we rate this so that it gets\ndone relatively quickly or, hey,\n\n924\n00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.800\nwhen we get around to it,\nbecause we're bored.\n\n925\n00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.640\nWe got nothing better to do.\n\n926\n00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.960\nWe should probably go ahead and\n\n927\n00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.195\nthink about doing that thing\nthat was set to never deploy.\n\n928\n00:46:18.195 --> 00:46:19.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're going to go ahead and\n\n929\n00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.950\nobviously specify that as well.\n\n930\n00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:24.010\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and we're\ngonna create a new deployment package.\n\n931\n00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:25.390\nI'm gonna go ahead and select that.\n\n932\n00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.800\nLet's actually just get back there and\ndo that right now.\n\n933\n00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.240\nWe're gonna go ahead and give it a name.\n\n934\n00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:37.665\nAnd let's go ahead and\nlet's call this oh, whoops, not TYTest.\n\n935\n00:46:37.665 --> 00:46:42.270\n[LAUGH] Let's just call that,\nwhat did I call it?\n\n936\n00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:46.320\nTestAlpha1 Package, right?\n\n937\n00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.280\nSomething like that.\n\n938\n00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.540\nDoesn't really matter what we name it.\n\n939\n00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.060\nWe're gonna go ahead and name it that.\n\n940\n00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.310\nAnd then for our package source,\nwe're gonna go ahead and browse.\n\n941\n00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.480\nNow I have cheated a little bit.\n\n942\n00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:01.740\nAnd I have created a little update\nfolder that we can already use here.\n\n943\n00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:06.140\nAnd so, what we're gonna do is go ahead\nand select our update package item.\n\n944\n00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:11.750\nSo give me just a second\nto be able to do that.\n\n945\n00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.560\nAnd let me see here.\n\n946\n00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:19.360\nLet's go there and let's go in here\njust to this PC and I'd put that\n\n947\n00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.310\nin the root of the C drive if I remember\ncorrectly so let me actually go up there.\n\n948\n00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:30.090\nAnd yeah, let's actually do it this way,\ngo here and we'll go down here and,\n\n949\n00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:36.060\noops and let's just get right\nthere to the C drive and\n\n950\n00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.170\nthis will be updates,\npackage right down there.\n\n951\n00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.730\nSo I'm gonna select that folder.\n\n952\n00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:45.130\nThat is the folder where we\nare gonna be storing updates.\n\n953\n00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:48.870\nSo that's effectively the one that we've\njust created, put our update into.\n\n954\n00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.421\nIn the real world you would\nhave a source directory.\n\n955\n00:47:51.421 --> 00:47:52.838\nYou would specify where that is.\n\n956\n00:47:52.838 --> 00:47:53.530\nI don't know where that would be.\n\n957\n00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.463\nIt would really be up to you to decide.\n\n958\n00:47:55.463 --> 00:47:57.983\nBased on setting up WSUS,\nwhere you put everything,\n\n959\n00:47:57.983 --> 00:48:01.260\nthat'll be part of your WSUS\ninstallation and configuration.\n\n960\n00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.130\nRemember we talked about the fact that\nyou would go out and, I'll probably take\n\n961\n00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:08.635\na look at that TechNet article that Mike\nbrought up on the Google Search for you,\n\n962\n00:48:08.635 --> 00:48:12.135\nthat we showed you to give you\nthe heads up on how to configure WSUS,\n\n963\n00:48:12.135 --> 00:48:14.565\njust in case you need that\nlittle extra bit of knowledge.\n\n964\n00:48:14.565 --> 00:48:16.795\nYou would create that folder\nas part of the process.\n\n965\n00:48:16.795 --> 00:48:20.675\nI have that created already,\ncuz we had done the WSUS install remember,\n\n966\n00:48:20.675 --> 00:48:23.045\nprior to starting the actual\ndemonstration for you,\n\n967\n00:48:23.045 --> 00:48:26.427\njust to speed the process up a little bit,\nand boy did that work out well.\n\n968\n00:48:26.427 --> 00:48:27.199\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz,\n\n969\n00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:30.010\nboy we flew right through\nthat with no trouble.\n\n970\n00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.980\nBoy, we just took no time\nat all to get that done.\n\n971\n00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.720\nAll right, so we did just set that up.\n\n972\n00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:37.220\nSo obviously,\nthe source there is coming in from\n\n973\n00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.490\na folder that I created in the real world.\n\n974\n00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.070\nWhen you're doing this, you would have\nthat folder or that directory set up.\n\n975\n00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.640\nOr whoever set up SUS would\ngive you that information, and\n\n976\n00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.290\nyou would then know obviously\nwhere to go to be able to do that.\n\n977\n00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:52.500\nSo you would take that information,\nand figure that out from your own\n\n978\n00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.890\nconfiguration of your own infrastructure,\nall right.\n\n979\n00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:58.020\nOh, I didn't do that as a UNC did I?\n\n980\n00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.010\nI just did that as a local,\nyeah let me go and grab that, one second.\n\n981\n00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.715\nAnd of course I was not paying attention,\ncuz I should have done that as a USC.\n\n982\n00:49:05.715 --> 00:49:06.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let me just go in and\n\n983\n00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:11.210\ndo this instead, so what we need is the\nfollowing, let me actually just go browse\n\n984\n00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:17.360\nand let me get rid of this, let me browse\nthis real quick and do that that way.\n\n985\n00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.340\nBrowse back in there all right, so what\nwe need is the following, let's go in and\n\n986\n00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.347\nwe are on PLABSYS01, right.\n\n987\n00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:30.740\nSYS01, and I believe right.\n\n988\n00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:36.020\nAnd then there is Update Package,\ncuz I shared that out, so we've got that.\n\n989\n00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.100\nLet's just go ahead and\nselect that folder.\n\n990\n00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.820\nThat's my mistake, boys and girls,\nnothing to do with you guys,\n\n991\n00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.810\nI just wasn't paying attention\nto the screen we were on.\n\n992\n00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.970\nAll right, so we've got that set up,\ncuz I had already shared that out and\n\n993\n00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:50.070\nmade that available over UNC.\n\n994\n00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:51.670\nSo then let's go in there.\n\n995\n00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:56.270\nI will go to Distribution Points, and\nwe have to add in a distribution point.\n\n996\n00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:00.310\nNow you've seen me do this in our other\ndiscussions about software deployment.\n\n997\n00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:03.470\nAll we're doing as you can see,\nis just zooming in and\n\n998\n00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:04.830\nadding a distribution point.\n\n999\n00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:07.700\nThere isn't one out there right\nnow because unlike the other labs,\n\n1000\n00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.230\nwe don't already have it preloaded,\nso we're gonna just add it in.\n\n1001\n00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.720\nNow remember,\nour site server is a distribution point.\n\n1002\n00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.940\nWe're just gonna go grab it and\ncheck off the box, but\n\n1003\n00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.300\nwe reset the environment after\nwe do a lot of these things.\n\n1004\n00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.840\nSo we just wanna keep that in mind and\nthat's why we're gonna go and reselect it.\n\n1005\n00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.490\nSo we'll do that.\n\n1006\n00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.390\nWe'll just check off the box there.\n\n1007\n00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.930\nClick okay.\n\n1008\n00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:27.310\nPut that in there.\n\n1009\n00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:30.640\nNow if we have more than one distribution\npoint, obviously we could do that,\n\n1010\n00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.940\nwe could use our distribution point\ngroup if we have one of those.\n\n1011\n00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.380\nWell, you know we don't have that created,\nbut we could if we wanted to.\n\n1012\n00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:39.510\nSo just reminding you about\nthe stuff that's going on there.\n\n1013\n00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:43.380\nAll right, so now, what we have is,\nwe have our download location.\n\n1014\n00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.800\nRemember, download has to occur in\norder to be able to bring in the actual\n\n1015\n00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.020\nbits of the package.\n\n1016\n00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:51.400\nWe really just kind of have the overview,\nthe metadata that we were looking at,\n\n1017\n00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.370\ndescriptors.\n\n1018\n00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:56.480\nSo we are either gonna download software\nupdates directly from the Internet, or\n\n1019\n00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.670\ngo and download them from a cache\nlocation somewhere on the network, right?\n\n1020\n00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:02.580\nAnd so we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n1021\n00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.220\nWe're gonna select,\nobviously, the default,\n\n1022\n00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.230\nwhich is download from the Internet,\ncuz we haven't preloaded those.\n\n1023\n00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:08.190\nWe could have downloaded them.\n\n1024\n00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.610\nRemember, you did see I had\nthe option to right-click, download.\n\n1025\n00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:13.345\nCould have brought that down,\nput it somewhere on the machine, and\n\n1026\n00:51:13.345 --> 00:51:15.705\nthen grabbed it, but we're just gonna\nlet it go out to the Internet and\n\n1027\n00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:18.535\ndownload that from\nMicrosoft Update directly, right?\n\n1028\n00:51:18.535 --> 00:51:19.865\nCuz that worked so well the first time.\n\n1029\n00:51:19.865 --> 00:51:22.277\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why wouldn't we wanna go do that\n\n1030\n00:51:22.277 --> 00:51:22.947\nagain, right?\n\n1031\n00:51:22.947 --> 00:51:25.962\nWe don't have anywhere to be\nuntil late tonight, right?\n\n1032\n00:51:25.962 --> 00:51:28.328\n>> No, no.\n>> All right, so, we're gonna go ahead,\n\n1033\n00:51:28.328 --> 00:51:30.350\nselect our choice for language now.\n\n1034\n00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:33.530\nLuckily, and thankfully, because I've\nalready done this, when we set up,\n\n1035\n00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:38.030\nthe configuration the first time,\nfor the software update point role,\n\n1036\n00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.430\nwe chose the primary language,\ngot rid of all the others.\n\n1037\n00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:43.010\nYou'll notice it now that\nlanguage selection sticks here.\n\n1038\n00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:46.710\nThey don't go in and reset it all and say,\noh, by the way here's the 20 languages you\n\n1039\n00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:51.350\nnormally need, so they do keep it there on\nthis one, and we read that setting based\n\n1040\n00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:53.510\non the configuration of\nthe software update point.\n\n1041\n00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.990\nSo that part is done well, it's just that\ninitial configuration with all those other\n\n1042\n00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:58.830\nlanguages, so\nwe gotta kinda struggle through.\n\n1043\n00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:00.410\nSo we're gonna hit Next here.\n\n1044\n00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:04.760\nWe will get our summary screen,\ntells us all the stuff that we are doing.\n\n1045\n00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.120\nNow I'm gonna give you a little\nhint here about two things.\n\n1046\n00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:11.630\nI'm gonna zoom in,\nshow you two things that we can do.\n\n1047\n00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:16.240\nNumber one, when I go and do auditing\nwork for customers, and I do a lot of\n\n1048\n00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.330\nsecurity work, a lot of auditing work,\nI have for many, many years.\n\n1049\n00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:22.040\nOne of the things that I specialize in,\n\n1050\n00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.510\none of the things that I talk\nto customers about is, so\n\n1051\n00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:28.200\nhow good is your documentation, and then\nI tend to hear the groans and the moans.\n\n1052\n00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.930\nYeah, we know the documentation\nis a sore point for many people.\n\n1053\n00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:35.000\nOne of the things I recommend to customers\nthat are doing this kind of work is\n\n1054\n00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.800\nwhen you get to a screen like this,\ntake all that information and\n\n1055\n00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.550\neither screen capture it or\njust copy it and print it out.\n\n1056\n00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:43.890\nWhatever you wanna do, cut, copy, paste.\n\n1057\n00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.275\nPut into your run book or\nyour change order for\n\n1058\n00:52:46.275 --> 00:52:49.860\nyour documentation around this process,\ncuz you should never be doing these\n\n1059\n00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.190\nupdates, unless you have a change request\nthat drives them and approves them.\n\n1060\n00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:56.440\nAnd as a result of that,\nif you attach this to that documentation,\n\n1061\n00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.410\nwhen it comes time for an audit,\nand we say, okay, so show us,\n\n1062\n00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:03.560\nyou randomly will pick an event and say,\nokay so this change request right here,\n\n1063\n00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.900\nshow us the documentation trail\non this thing to validate.\n\n1064\n00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.950\nWhat you do, show us your policy,\nyour process, make sure it works.\n\n1065\n00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:11.370\nYou've got everything right there,\nso it's actually really nice,\n\n1066\n00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.220\ncuz Microsoft has basically\nsummarized everything we're about to\n\n1067\n00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:17.740\ndo in this window, and all you need to\ndo is just be smart enough to grab it.\n\n1068\n00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.697\n>> Almost no excuse not to document.\n\n1069\n00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:20.860\nAlmost.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1070\n00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.700\n>> Almost no excuse not to document.\n\n1071\n00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:27.370\nNow the other thing we can do,\nis we can also save this as a template.\n\n1072\n00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:30.050\nI'm just going to click\nthe Save as a Template button\n\n1073\n00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:31.230\nwhich was right over there.\n\n1074\n00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:35.590\nAnd when I did that, I get this\nlittle window right here, right?\n\n1075\n00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:40.140\nAnd I can give it a name and I have all\nthe settings that I just configured,\n\n1076\n00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.440\nsee all the check boxes there.\n\n1077\n00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.420\nI have them all and pretty much\nwhatever I did is all checked off.\n\n1078\n00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:45.400\nI have it all there.\n\n1079\n00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.350\nI can save this and\n\n1080\n00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:50.210\nnext time I wanna do a deployment I don't\nhave to go through all this trouble.\n\n1081\n00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:53.530\nCuz I'm one of the laziest people\nyou could ever wanna meet, right?\n\n1082\n00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.520\nIf it requires me doing it twice and\n\n1083\n00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.160\nI can't save it once,\nI pay somebody else to do it for me.\n\n1084\n00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.660\nThis is why I firmly believe that\nminions are the way to go, right?\n\n1085\n00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.950\nSo the idea here would be that\nyou save as a template, and\n\n1086\n00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:08.540\nthen we can pull that template up and\nif you remember, back on one of the very\n\n1087\n00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:12.330\nfirst screens in this wizard, it said\ndownload or it said deployment template.\n\n1088\n00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:14.730\nWe didn't click the body because I\nknow there's nothing there now, so\n\n1089\n00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:18.740\nwe don't have any, but there at that\npoint, we could simply hit that if we've\n\n1090\n00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:23.570\nalready saved this as a template, and\npull up this preconfigured script, and all\n\n1091\n00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:27.390\nthose options are there and now all I have\nto do is make a couple of minor changes,\n\n1092\n00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:30.430\nlike maybe rename just a couple of things,\nand I'm ready to go.\n\n1093\n00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:32.462\nI've just saved myself at least three or\n\n1094\n00:54:32.462 --> 00:54:36.110\nfour minutes worth of time by\nreasoning through all this every time.\n\n1095\n00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:39.766\nSo saving this as a deployment template\nwould be very, very valuable for you.\n\n1096\n00:54:39.766 --> 00:54:42.460\nSo want to just make sure you've\ngot a chance to see that, and\n\n1097\n00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.310\nthat you are aware of that.\n\n1098\n00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:45.722\nSo we'll just save this out,\nwe'll call this.\n\n1099\n00:54:53.158 --> 00:54:53.934\nCome on.\n\n1100\n00:55:00.526 --> 00:55:04.961\nThere we go, okay, just trying get it to\nlet me go ahead and type in there, yeah,\n\n1101\n00:55:04.961 --> 00:55:06.020\nrefocus, right.\n\n1102\n00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.770\nSo I got my name in there,\njust going to go ahead and hit save.\n\n1103\n00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:11.020\nThere we go.\nSo we got that, we took care of that.\n\n1104\n00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:11.940\nGrabbed that option.\n\n1105\n00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.260\nSo we're gonna hit next here and\nlet this actually go.\n\n1106\n00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.650\nWe get our progress bar, and\nthat'll take a moment to kinda spin up and\n\n1107\n00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:20.300\nstart working.\n\n1108\n00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.700\nNow remember we are going\nto be downloading, and so\n\n1109\n00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:28.420\nwhat you're gonna see, right, is that we\nhave a processing percentage there, and\n\n1110\n00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.570\nthat's gonna climb and that went by\nreal quick and it's actually done.\n\n1111\n00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:33.890\nSo quick that I didn't even have\na chance to screen shot it for you and\n\n1112\n00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:35.920\nshow it to you,\nbecause it was a small update.\n\n1113\n00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.270\nWhat it's gonna say is probably\ngonna be real quick this time,\n\n1114\n00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:39.980\nbecause the update is really tiny.\n\n1115\n00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:42.620\nWe did one of those really big\nupdates like a service pack, right?\n\n1116\n00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.500\n>> Right.\n>> Which could be big.\n\n1117\n00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.970\nWould have taken a little bit,\nbut this one was actually really,\n\n1118\n00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:47.490\nreally reasonable.\n\n1119\n00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:49.454\nFirst thing that happened that\nway all day as a matter of fact.\n\n1120\n00:55:49.454 --> 00:55:50.507\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n1121\n00:55:50.507 --> 00:55:53.398\nwe're gonna click Close, and\nwe're gonna go ahead, and\n\n1122\n00:55:53.398 --> 00:55:56.838\nwhat we're gonna do now,\nis come over here to Deployment Packages.\n\n1123\n00:55:56.838 --> 00:55:57.940\nWhich is the other area that we see here.\n\n1124\n00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.690\nWe'll just scroll down so\nwe can kind of center that a little bit.\n\n1125\n00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:06.230\nHighlight that so\nwe can see what we're doing there, and\n\n1126\n00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:09.930\nyou'll see that we now have\nour deployment package.\n\n1127\n00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:14.320\nZoom in, see our deployment package,\nsee Test Alpha 1 package.\n\n1128\n00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.270\nGot that cool name going on there.\n\n1129\n00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:17.590\nPackage ID.\n\n1130\n00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:20.560\nAnd then if we scroll down,\ndistribution point status.\n\n1131\n00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.700\nYou'll see it has been\ndistributed as successful.\n\n1132\n00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:23.420\nIt's so quick, right?\n\n1133\n00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.600\nCuz it was already done.\n\n1134\n00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.730\nSo we see that there.\n\n1135\n00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:26.310\nRight?\n\n1136\n00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:26.821\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n1137\n00:56:26.821 --> 00:56:29.620\nwe could see that that's\nalready available to us, right?\n\n1138\n00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.510\nSo now what we would need to\ndo is just kinda sit back.\n\n1139\n00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.430\nCuz remember we already\nchose our collection.\n\n1140\n00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:35.300\n>> Right.\n>> We already said,\n\n1141\n00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.040\nhey go download this thing,\nset it up, get it out there.\n\n1142\n00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.290\nAnd we wait 30 minutes,\nan hour, whatever it may be.\n\n1143\n00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:42.700\nI'm not quite sure, but\nhowever long it may take.\n\n1144\n00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.650\nAnd eventually we're golden.\n\n1145\n00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:45.150\nWe're good.\n\n1146\n00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.760\n>> Fantastic.\n\n1147\n00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.230\nYeah.\n>> Now, we're not done yet, though.\n\n1148\n00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.950\nNot done yet.\n\n1149\n00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:48.715\n>> Nope.\n>> Not done yet.\n\n1150\n00:56:48.715 --> 00:56:50.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me say it one more time.\n\n1151\n00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:50.905\nWe're not done yet.\n\n1152\n00:56:50.905 --> 00:56:52.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We still have automatic\n\n1153\n00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:53.774\ndeployment rules that we have to do.\n\n1154\n00:56:53.774 --> 00:56:55.210\n>> Yes.\n>> Remember we wanna talk about those.\n\n1155\n00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.060\nWe need a chance to talk about\nthem in the last episode.\n\n1156\n00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.200\n>> Absolutely.\n>> And\n\n1157\n00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.130\nwe would be remiss if we did not spend\na few minutes talking about that.\n\n1158\n00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.660\nSo I wanna spend a few minutes just\ncovering that last little piece\n\n1159\n00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:05.950\nof functionality here.\n\n1160\n00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:07.940\nWe also have a couple of summary\nstatements we want to go to.\n\n1161\n00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:08.860\nWe're not gonna go to them yet.\n\n1162\n00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.600\nWe're gonna stay on my machine and\nshow you how to create one.\n\n1163\n00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.580\n>> Okay.\n>> But we summarize this process as well.\n\n1164\n00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:14.400\nSo we'll go back.\n\n1165\n00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.170\nWe'll wrap that up with\na nice little review.\n\n1166\n00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:21.045\nPut a little bow on it for you because\ncuz it is review Friday here at\n\n1167\n00:57:21.045 --> 00:57:25.125\nItProTv and it's also pretty bow\nFriday cuz we have a surplus of those.\n\n1168\n00:57:25.125 --> 00:57:29.545\nSo we'll put a pretty bow on it for\nyou and then we're gonna wrap this one up\n\n1169\n00:57:29.545 --> 00:57:31.345\nno pun intended with the bow\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1170\n00:57:31.345 --> 00:57:33.215\n>> And then as soon as we're done with\n\n1171\n00:57:33.215 --> 00:57:36.635\nthat we're gonna go ahead and get teed\nup and get ready for our next release.\n\n1172\n00:57:36.635 --> 00:57:38.845\nAnd I'm gonna say it so\nyou're gonna have to commit to this.\n\n1173\n00:57:38.845 --> 00:57:39.735\nFun and exciting.\n\n1174\n00:57:39.735 --> 00:57:40.725\n>> Fun and exciting I got it.\n\n1175\n00:57:40.725 --> 00:57:42.190\n>> Fun and exciting episode.\n\n1176\n00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:44.616\nWhich is gonna be operating\nsystem deployments.\n\n1177\n00:57:44.616 --> 00:57:45.390\n>> Whoo hoo.\n\n1178\n00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:46.560\n>> You thought this was fun.\n\n1179\n00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.140\nJust wait.\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1180\n00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:48.970\n>> All right.\n\n1181\n00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:51.870\nOther big logical group of functionality\nthat we wanna spend some time on.\n\n1182\n00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:55.170\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\ntake a look at automatic deployment rules.\n\n1183\n00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:56.700\nLemme just scroll down here.\n\n1184\n00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.250\nShow you that right now, as you can see.\n\n1185\n00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:01.750\nI'm not gonna zoom in but you can see,\nwe have no rules stated there yet, so\n\n1186\n00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.110\nwe're going to go ahead and create one.\n\n1187\n00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:06.490\nNow lets talk about what an automatic\ndeployment rule is while I'm just getting\n\n1188\n00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:09.080\nready to be able to do this, and\nI'll zoom in so you can see the one.\n\n1189\n00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.780\nI right click on there that we\nhave the ability to go out and\n\n1190\n00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:18.450\nuse the little icon to go ahead or\nlittle pop up menu to create one.\n\n1191\n00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:20.029\nJust like the name implies.\n\n1192\n00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:25.880\nIf you had to think and guess to what\nan automatic employment rule is.\n\n1193\n00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.930\nWhat would you think it does, Mr. Mike?\n\n1194\n00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:31.470\n>> I think it's gonna somehow\nautomate the deployment\n\n1195\n00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:33.138\nof some of these software updates.\n\n1196\n00:58:33.138 --> 00:58:35.319\n>> Outstanding sir.\n\n1197\n00:58:35.319 --> 00:58:37.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I tip my hat to you.\n\n1198\n00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.425\nYou are a master of the obvious, you are.\n\n1199\n00:58:40.425 --> 00:58:43.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it is exactly that as Mike said.\n\n1200\n00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:45.660\nIt's effectively just gonna\nbe an automation process for\n\n1201\n00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.680\nfiguring out what we wanna deploy, right?\n\n1202\n00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:52.490\nNow if you remember I went ahead and\nI created a deployment ready.\n\n1203\n00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:55.440\nI also created a software update group.\n\n1204\n00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.990\nIf you remember, we did that as well.\n\n1205\n00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:59.830\nSo we'll just take a look at\nhow to view this real quickly.\n\n1206\n00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:01.150\nWe're gonna go ahead and give it a name.\n\n1207\n00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:09.980\nI'll call this auto rule, oops,\nor AutoRuke that would also work.\n\n1208\n00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:10.720\nAutoRule1A.\n\n1209\n00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.220\nAnd now what we're gonna do\n\n1210\n00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.670\nis we are going to select a template\nthat may have been saved.\n\n1211\n00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:20.670\nAnd you'll see that we have\ntwo templates here, and\n\n1212\n00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:23.590\nI\"m gonna zoom in and\nshow you what these are real quick.\n\n1213\n00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.770\nSo we have two templates that are here\nthat define configuration settings for\n\n1214\n00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:29.540\nthis deployment we have Patch Tuesday.\n\n1215\n00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:30.730\nThese are the ones that are built in,\n\n1216\n00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:34.760\nby the way, that come from Microsoft\ndirectly, and Definition Updates.\n\n1217\n00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:39.470\nNow when we do a baseline later and\n\n1218\n00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:43.400\nwe set that up, we'll use that Definition\nUpdates one because that's where we're\n\n1219\n00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:47.250\ngonna add information in,\ndo updates to an existing baseline.\n\n1220\n00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.750\nThat's gonna be a separate conversation,\nanother episode, but\n\n1221\n00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:52.540\nwe'll use Patch Tuesday here\nbecause we're doing patching.\n\n1222\n00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.360\nSo we have a template that's already\nbeen preconfigured that allows us to\n\n1223\n00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.970\ndo some of this work.\n\n1224\n00:59:56.970 --> 00:59:59.650\nSo we've talked about the value of\nsaving it as a template already.\n\n1225\n00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:00.710\nWe've just demonstrated that.\n\n1226\n01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:03.960\nWe're gonna put that thought\nprocess to work here, if you will.\n\n1227\n01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.440\nWe're gonna specify our collection.\n\n1228\n01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.160\nBecause you know we do have to obviously\nspecify which collection we're going\n\n1229\n01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.130\nto deploy to.\n\n1230\n01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:14.740\nAgain, we'll choose all systems here, but\nin production environments you will be\n\n1231\n01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.910\na little bit more selective about that,\nright?\n\n1232\n01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.285\nAnd we've talked about the value of that,\nwhy that is so important.\n\n1233\n01:00:20.285 --> 01:00:25.785\nSo I did create a software update group\nand I just wanna show you this here.\n\n1234\n01:00:25.785 --> 01:00:29.425\nEach time the rule runs and\nfinds new updates, what do we want to do?\n\n1235\n01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:32.285\nDo you want to add them to\nan existing software update group?\n\n1236\n01:00:32.285 --> 01:00:33.967\nIn which case, right?\n\n1237\n01:00:33.967 --> 01:00:38.707\nWhich case we will then have to choose or\nspecify what that will be or\n\n1238\n01:00:38.707 --> 01:00:42.337\ncreate a new software update group,\nmeaning create one of those update groups\n\n1239\n01:00:42.337 --> 01:00:44.987\nwith the new updates, and\nthen name it so that we have it there.\n\n1240\n01:00:44.987 --> 01:00:46.504\n>> That's right.\n>> We could iterate through it, right?\n\n1241\n01:00:46.504 --> 01:00:47.737\nSo yeah, we're going to decide on that.\n\n1242\n01:00:47.737 --> 01:00:49.967\nThe default is create\na new one every time.\n\n1243\n01:00:49.967 --> 01:00:52.057\nSo that's okay.\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n1244\n01:00:52.057 --> 01:00:54.240\nSo we'll hit next, then\n\n1245\n01:00:56.190 --> 01:01:01.150\ndo we want to use Wake-on-LANs, so you\nget clients up and running if necessary?\n\n1246\n01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:03.120\nWe'll specify what that is.\n\n1247\n01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.480\nWe then have the option down below and\nit's probably important to scroll in so\n\n1248\n01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.610\nyou could see this part.\n\n1249\n01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.660\nSome software updates\ninclude a license agreement.\n\n1250\n01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.098\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know how sometimes,\n\n1251\n01:01:12.098 --> 01:01:14.381\nyeah you get like those\nhardware updates from or\n\n1252\n01:01:14.381 --> 01:01:17.751\nthe the driver updates from Microsoft\nare like the Microsoft mouse and\n\n1253\n01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:21.430\nthe keyboard and they put up the drivers\nand you have the license agreement.\n\n1254\n01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:25.404\nYou have to select so that will stop the\nupdate process call because it's prompting\n\n1255\n01:01:25.404 --> 01:01:29.570\non the screen that somebody's gotta click\nthe button and it will just sit there.\n\n1256\n01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:33.360\nSo we actually can do this and\nsay, if you saw four updates\n\n1257\n01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.560\nare going to require that,\nwe can deploy them automatically and\n\n1258\n01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.220\nif we do this,\nthey won't display a license agreement.\n\n1259\n01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:44.628\nSo it can say automatically\ndeploy softgrade [NOISE].\n\n1260\n01:01:44.628 --> 01:01:45.750\nAutomatically.\n\n1261\n01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.420\nSlow down and talk normally!\n\n1262\n01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.650\nAutomatically deploy only software\nupdates found by this rule that do not,\n\n1263\n01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:53.510\nas you can see,\ninclude a license agreement or for\n\n1264\n01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:55.920\nwhich license agreements\nhave already been approved.\n\n1265\n01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.900\nOr automatically deploy all software\nif it's found by this rule and\n\n1266\n01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.160\napprove any license agreements.\n\n1267\n01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.820\nSo, another it's, we automatically\napproved in and opt in so,\n\n1268\n01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.300\nthey freeze on that screen and get stuck.\n\n1269\n01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.030\nSo, that is the default\nbehavior by the way.\n\n1270\n01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:10.030\nSo, we're just wanna make sure we're aware\nof that as well because that's good,\n\n1271\n01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.330\nbecause that can really you know,\n\n1272\n01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:14.140\nscrew up your day because you're\nwaiting on this thing to happen and\n\n1273\n01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.820\nthese machines are remote and just\nprobably no human being sitting in front\n\n1274\n01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:20.270\non some of them like servers that are\nyeah, gonna send a data center somewhere.\n\n1275\n01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:23.550\nAnd that would ba an issue because\nthat can actually stop the deployment\n\n1276\n01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:24.240\nprocess cold.\n\n1277\n01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:28.920\nSo we'll fix that then we'll adjust for\nthat I should say.\n\n1278\n01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.150\nThen these software updates have met\nthe criteria we'll see here, right?\n\n1279\n01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:35.990\nThe software updates that meet\nthe specified criteria are added to your\n\n1280\n01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:37.500\nassociated software group.\n\n1281\n01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.060\nSo what criteria do we want to use\nin order to build out the rules?\n\n1282\n01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.410\nRemember this is a rule-building exercise,\nright?\n\n1283\n01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:48.680\nAutomatic deployment rule, so we're\nbuilding the business logic of the rules.\n\n1284\n01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.830\nNow, this should look very similar or\nindeed identical to you\n\n1285\n01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:55.380\nif you've ever done the rule building\nin Outlook, for instance, right?\n\n1286\n01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.790\nOr if you've done this\nin some other programs.\n\n1287\n01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:02.470\nPrograms like Visio for\ndesign and things of that nature.\n\n1288\n01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:04.060\nYou're gonna see these kinds of rules.\n\n1289\n01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.010\nWe see this in SharePoint as well where\nwe're building in some of the business\n\n1290\n01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:08.280\nlogic with workflows.\n\n1291\n01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.635\nIt all looks the same.\n\n1292\n01:03:09.635 --> 01:03:14.095\nSo we would check off the items,\nwe then get those blue highlightable and\n\n1293\n01:03:14.095 --> 01:03:16.195\nclickable areas down below here.\n\n1294\n01:03:16.195 --> 01:03:19.855\nWe can go in it and you know, write\ncode in or program in what we want so\n\n1295\n01:03:19.855 --> 01:03:22.095\nyeah, was it released within the last day?\n\n1296\n01:03:22.095 --> 01:03:24.525\nThus it shows security\nupdates as a classification.\n\n1297\n01:03:24.525 --> 01:03:27.785\nThose are the default ones well obviously\nbe able to modify that depending on what\n\n1298\n01:03:27.785 --> 01:03:29.565\nwe want, but you get the general idea.\n\n1299\n01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:36.440\nWe also have a preview button here, and\nwe can click preview and we just did that.\n\n1300\n01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.797\nAnd then we would see when we do preview\nif there are any updates that actually\n\n1301\n01:03:40.797 --> 01:03:42.580\nmeet the rule criteria or not.\n\n1302\n01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.755\nNow obviously,\nthe update that we have was for 2014, so\n\n1303\n01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:48.754\nthat's not gonna meet\nthe criteria unless we modify it.\n\n1304\n01:03:48.754 --> 01:03:53.105\nBut the idea is in the real world,\nyou'd wanna do the preview, and\n\n1305\n01:03:53.105 --> 01:03:54.671\nthe preview button is.\n\n1306\n01:03:54.671 --> 01:03:58.868\nRight down there so\nyou can see it right at the bottom there.\n\n1307\n01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:03.620\nAnd so we'd wanna just make sure we do\nthat, to get a sense of what updates\n\n1308\n01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.960\nultimately wind up in this list, and that\nwe know the ones that we're working with.\n\n1309\n01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.000\nSo, we do want to make sure\nwe're thinking about that,\n\n1310\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.510\nbecause that is gonna\nobviously be important.\n\n1311\n01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:14.080\nWe do want to make sure that\nwe know that we can preview,\n\n1312\n01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.240\nwe can take a look at that.\n\n1313\n01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.610\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n1314\n01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.160\nWe are gonna select last one day and\n\n1315\n01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.040\nlet me just make sure we get all that\ndone yeah, let me move that out to last\n\n1316\n01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:30.460\nmonth actually get a couple of updates to\nshow up in there so, let's change that so\n\n1317\n01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:34.070\nwhen I click on that just to\nshow you what that looks like,\n\n1318\n01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:37.640\nwhat I did is I just clicked on it and\nI get a little descriptor\n\n1319\n01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.560\npop down box of pop out menu that I can\nchoose and modify through toggling.\n\n1320\n01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:47.610\nSo i'm gonna go ahead take that out and\n\n1321\n01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:53.246\ndo last one month, modify that and\nthat way we have that.\n\n1322\n01:04:53.246 --> 01:04:57.040\nAnd then, let's preview and\nsee if we get anything in there.\n\n1323\n01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.560\nI think that will give us there we go,\n\n1324\n01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.940\nyeah I was thinking we\nwould get at least one.\n\n1325\n01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:02.860\nSo yeah, when we do that,\nyou can see that we now have at\n\n1326\n01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.970\nleast one update in there that\nwill be able to use, right?\n\n1327\n01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:07.880\nSo just wanna make sure we've\ngot something in there, right?\n\n1328\n01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.630\nAll right, so we're gonna click close,\n\n1329\n01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:14.470\nthat's the value of the preview\nbutton boys and girls.\n\n1330\n01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:15.980\nAll right, so we're gonna do that.\n\n1331\n01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:19.400\nClick next, we now have our\nsynchronization schedule, you know,\n\n1332\n01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.980\nwhat schedule we're gonna use,\n\n1333\n01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:25.430\nhow often run the rule right on\nhowever many days we specify.\n\n1334\n01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:26.370\nWe've seen this before.\n\n1335\n01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:28.050\nWe're not really gonna\nspend a lot of time.\n\n1336\n01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:29.060\nZooming in on this one.\n\n1337\n01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.220\nYou guys know about\nthe scheduling options.\n\n1338\n01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:34.620\nYou've also seen the local\ntime client base.\n\n1339\n01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.820\nYou've seen the specific\ntime that we wanna run,\n\n1340\n01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.490\nwhat happens at the install deadline,\nhow long is it available for, all that.\n\n1341\n01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:44.420\nWe've done all this just\nnow in the last run through\n\n1342\n01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:45.740\nas we were setting up the package.\n\n1343\n01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.710\nWe're just reproducing a lot\nof that behavior here.\n\n1344\n01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:54.420\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to specify installation\n\n1345\n01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:58.850\ndeadline be as soon as possible and\nmake it available as soon as possible.\n\n1346\n01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:02.200\nJust that way, we try to get that\nkicked off as quickly as possible.\n\n1347\n01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.080\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll click next.\n\n1348\n01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.252\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nunder user visual experience,\n\n1349\n01:06:07.252 --> 01:06:09.400\nyou know, on the experience page\njust leave the default settings.\n\n1350\n01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.610\nWe did this last time so\nwe're not too worried about that.\n\n1351\n01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:17.650\nClick next, and\nthen configuration manager alerts.\n\n1352\n01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:19.410\nWe've talked about those,\nwe've talked about them and\n\n1353\n01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:22.060\nshowed you what they were as well so\nwe'll just click next on that.\n\n1354\n01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:28.210\nOn the download page,\nwe've went through and talked about this.\n\n1355\n01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:31.920\nWe'll go ahead and we will do,\nand let me scroll in so\n\n1356\n01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.000\nyou can see this real quick\nbefore we actually configure it.\n\n1357\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.800\nWe will do the download software updates\nfrom distribution point of install option,\n\n1358\n01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.280\nbecause now we are, you can see there,\n\n1359\n01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:47.720\ngonna have those, remember, already set\nup at the distribution point, right?\n\n1360\n01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:51.090\nSo as a result of that, we're just gonna\ngo grab them off the distribution point.\n\n1361\n01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.940\nWhen software updates are not\navailable on any preferred, remember,\n\n1362\n01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.400\nwe talked about using the fallback,\ncontent status point or content source.\n\n1363\n01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.340\nWe see that.\n\n1364\n01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.000\nWe talked about allowing clients\nto share content on the subnet,\n\n1365\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.570\nyou'll see that there.\n\n1366\n01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:05.930\nSo we're going to be able to use those\nsettings that we've already leveraged and\n\n1367\n01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:08.590\ntalked about on the last run-through,\nas we packaged up.\n\n1368\n01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:09.930\nSo we're going to do that.\n\n1369\n01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:11.090\nWe have all that set up,\n\n1370\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.410\nwe will click next here then we\nhave our deployment package.\n\n1371\n01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:20.270\nWe have to specify our deployment package.\n\n1372\n01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:24.300\nNow remember,\nour deployment package is going to either\n\n1373\n01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:28.140\nbe one that we can select that we already\nhave, or we have to create a new one.\n\n1374\n01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.790\nWe're going to create a brand\nnew one because we don't have\n\n1375\n01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:32.120\none that we want to use.\n\n1376\n01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:36.360\nSo we're going to go out and create a new,\nwe'll click on that, we'll get a little\n\n1377\n01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:39.590\noption here to give it a name and\ngo out and get our package source.\n\n1378\n01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:41.210\nSo, I'm gonna give it a name.\n\n1379\n01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:48.160\nI'm gonna go ahead I'm\ngonna call that test ADR.\n\n1380\n01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.860\nJust give it a random name,\nreally no big deal there.\n\n1381\n01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.090\nGo ahead and we'll browse.\n\n1382\n01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.380\nGo ahead and we'll just type in our path.\n\n1383\n01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.630\nOnly two backslashes for that.\n\n1384\n01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:00.285\nPlay or plab rather.\n\n1385\n01:08:00.285 --> 01:08:05.480\nPlabsys01\\ and\nthen we want updates package,\n\n1386\n01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:11.130\nso scroll down and grab that.\n\n1387\n01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:11.880\nAnd then\n\n1388\n01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.690\ninside updates package we have our update,\nwhatever that update is that's in there.\n\n1389\n01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:20.410\nThat's that long string that's there.\n\n1390\n01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:23.760\nThat is the actual update information.\n\n1391\n01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.110\nYou can see it right there.\n\n1392\n01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:28.100\nThis would be whatever update\nyou wanna grab and put in.\n\n1393\n01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.540\nWe have at least one in there.\n\n1394\n01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.730\nYou guys would obviously\nsee something similar but\n\n1395\n01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:33.900\nit would be the updates that\nyou have actually set up.\n\n1396\n01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.190\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna specify that.\n\n1397\n01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:39.580\nSet that up.\n\n1398\n01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.690\nGot our folder there.\n\n1399\n01:08:40.690 --> 01:08:43.970\nLet's do select folder.\n\n1400\n01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:45.790\nSo we got all that.\n\n1401\n01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:52.990\nAnd then we'll click next,\ndo our distribution points.\n\n1402\n01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.860\nWe've already done this so\n\n1403\n01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:57.920\nI'm not going to spend a lot\nof time showing that to you.\n\n1404\n01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.775\nI\"m just gonna go ahead and\nselect that and\n\n1405\n01:09:01.775 --> 01:09:06.660\nthen click next, and\nthen our download location.\n\n1406\n01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:10.730\nWe're gonna go ahead and download in\nthis case from Microsoft to populate and\n\n1407\n01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:11.240\nthen remember,\n\n1408\n01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:14.830\nwe'll have the content at the distribution\npoint when we actually go to distributor.\n\n1409\n01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:16.740\nRight?\nSo that will take care for\n\n1410\n01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:21.490\nus, we saw this when we created a path the\nfirst time, so leave the default in place.\n\n1411\n01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:25.150\nWe'll go ahead, we have our language\nselection, leave that one in place.\n\n1412\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.527\nWe'll go ahead and we will summarize,\nwe could save this template if we want to,\n\n1413\n01:09:31.527 --> 01:09:33.520\nwe've talked about that.\n\n1414\n01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.640\nLet that finish up.\n\n1415\n01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:38.670\nOkay, that was successful.\n\n1416\n01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:40.720\nSo, we'll close out there.\n\n1417\n01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.880\nAnd then what we have is\nthe ability to now go in, and\n\n1418\n01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.010\nyou'll see we have a rule there.\n\n1419\n01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:48.160\nAnd I'll zoom in so you can see it.\n\n1420\n01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.900\nAnd we now have our auto deployment rule.\n\n1421\n01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:51.500\n>> Yes.\n>> And so\n\n1422\n01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:55.360\nthat rule can now be used to drive\nauto deployments of any updates\n\n1423\n01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.410\nthat are gonna come down,\nand are gonna be found.\n\n1424\n01:09:57.410 --> 01:10:02.380\nNow, what we would do, is we would right\nclick on that rule and chose run now.\n\n1425\n01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:07.130\nAnd then we could run that as often as we\nneed to and it will go out, find rules, or\n\n1426\n01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:10.830\nrather remember the business logic.\n\n1427\n01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:12.760\nThe actual filters for\nthe rule, look at that.\n\n1428\n01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.740\nThat's the word I was struggling\nto find and could not for\n\n1429\n01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.640\nthe life of me come up with, the criteria.\n\n1430\n01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.530\nThat's what happens when you use all your\nintellectual capital on the big fancy\n\n1431\n01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:21.420\nwords, forget the simple ones.\n\n1432\n01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.920\nSo, the criteria that we\nwere going to use and\n\n1433\n01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:25.730\nwe did use\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1434\n01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:28.340\n>> was set to last 30 days on any updates\n\n1435\n01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:28.960\nthat have been released.\n\n1436\n01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.320\nSo, if we're running that update cycle,\nright?\n\n1437\n01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.300\nEvery one week, we said every seven days.\n\n1438\n01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.870\nNormally I said maybe push it out\n\n1439\n01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:35.470\na little bit,\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1440\n01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:36.760\n>> But however you're doing that.\n\n1441\n01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.280\nIf every seven days we're running and\nwe're seeing hey,\n\n1442\n01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.610\nthere's some new updates that come in and\n\n1443\n01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:43.660\nwe're downloading them initially, right,\nthat was part of, remember, the initial\n\n1444\n01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:45.830\nconfiguration of the software update point\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1445\n01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:47.840\n>> And the sync for the configuration.\n\n1446\n01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.240\nIf we've done that, and\nwe're getting new updates potentially,\n\n1447\n01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.210\nprobably not very often, but\npotentially every seven days.\n\n1448\n01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:59.230\nIf we then run this rule every, let's say,\neight days after the download cycle,\n\n1449\n01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:02.970\nif we see any new patches that came in,\nright, we'll start picking them up.\n\n1450\n01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.970\nBut remember they have to be at\nleast within the 30 day window.\n\n1451\n01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:07.660\nSo we'll start to pick those up and\n\n1452\n01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.832\nthen we can start packaging\nthem into software groups.\n\n1453\n01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.680\nAnd potentially teaming them up for\ndeployment.\n\n1454\n01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.530\n>> Nice, very nice.\n\n1455\n01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:13.760\n>> So we're gonna automate that process.\n\n1456\n01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.550\nNow we're not quite done yet.\n\n1457\n01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:20.100\nI'm gonna show you a little bit of a magic\nbehind the scenes, under the hood, and\n\n1458\n01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:24.930\nthen we're gonna summarize our automatic\ndeployment rule discussion and\n\n1459\n01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:28.100\nwrap that whole thought process up.\n\n1460\n01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.710\nWe're gonna go to our\nadministration work space here,\n\n1461\n01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:35.650\nand we are going to take you on\na little behind the scenes tour.\n\n1462\n01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:37.062\nYou ever go to Disney World?\n\n1463\n01:11:37.062 --> 01:11:38.050\n>> Yeah.\n\n1464\n01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:39.750\nThey do like the feel out magic and\n\n1465\n01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.796\nall that stuff you get to see\nbehind the scenes a little bit.\n\n1466\n01:11:42.796 --> 01:11:45.755\nSo I actually had something really\ninteresting happen a few years ago.\n\n1467\n01:11:45.755 --> 01:11:47.411\nWe did a big company trip And\n\n1468\n01:11:47.411 --> 01:11:52.379\nduring the company trip somebody that was\none of our team members had gotten sick.\n\n1469\n01:11:52.379 --> 01:11:54.860\nWe wound up having to\ntake her to the hospital.\n\n1470\n01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.910\nAnd so, it's interesting\nbecause when you're in Disney,\n\n1471\n01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:59.456\nI mean, literally it's like you're\nin your own little country, right?\n\n1472\n01:11:59.456 --> 01:12:02.920\nIt's almost like being in the Vatican,\nright, or something like that.\n\n1473\n01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.211\nSo the idea is that they\nhave their own police force,\n\n1474\n01:12:05.211 --> 01:12:07.080\nthey have their own everything.\n\n1475\n01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.159\nSo, we were in EPCOT, right,\nand she had gotten sick, and\n\n1476\n01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:13.299\nwe wound up talking to whoever\nwas there in the country room,\n\n1477\n01:12:13.299 --> 01:12:16.190\nwe were in one of\nthe restaurants in the country.\n\n1478\n01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:20.090\nAnd said hey,\nthis person's not feeling well.\n\n1479\n01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:22.300\nWe need to get her some help.\n\n1480\n01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.780\nThey called fire rescue.\n\n1481\n01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:25.150\nPolice and fire rescue show up,\n\n1482\n01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:28.920\nthey come in, figure out she's okay but\nneed to take her to the hospital.\n\n1483\n01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.540\nSo they get her in the ambulance.\n\n1484\n01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.990\nSo to get her in the ambulance,\nthey take you and\n\n1485\n01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:36.140\nthey roll you out on the gurney or\nwhatever it is.\n\n1486\n01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.005\nAnd so they took us,\none of us had to go with her so\n\n1487\n01:12:38.005 --> 01:12:40.350\nI was the one who wound\nup having to go with her.\n\n1488\n01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:43.023\nAnd they take you behind the scenes\nbecause in order to get out,\n\n1489\n01:12:43.023 --> 01:12:45.697\nthey park the ambulance back in\nthe service area where nobody is\n\n1490\n01:12:45.697 --> 01:12:47.780\ncuz they don't want people to see it.\n\n1491\n01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.340\nAnd so they actually allow you,\n\n1492\n01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:52.260\nbecause of what was going on,\nthey took us behind the scenes.\n\n1493\n01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:56.050\nAnd we got to go in the service corridors\nand all that stuff and then they drive us\n\n1494\n01:12:56.050 --> 01:13:00.420\nout in the back areas to to get off\nproperty to go to the hospital.\n\n1495\n01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:03.430\nSo you get to see all this behind the\nscenes stuff you would never normally see.\n\n1496\n01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:04.660\nI was really cool.\n\n1497\n01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:08.001\nThis is not the really cool underground\nstuff where all the computers are, that's\n\n1498\n01:13:08.001 --> 01:13:11.339\neven cooler, but this was just behind\nthe scenes, what happens behind the rides,\n\n1499\n01:13:11.339 --> 01:13:14.607\nthe areas that the team members, or\ncast members, whatever they call them are.\n\n1500\n01:13:14.607 --> 01:13:16.047\n>> The employees only door.\n\n1501\n01:13:16.047 --> 01:13:18.000\n>> The employees only door, exactly.\n\n1502\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.370\nSo, we're going to take you through the\nemployee's only door here at SCCM central.\n\n1503\n01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:26.080\nSo strap in and grab ahold of something.\n\n1504\n01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.320\nSo let's go back to console.\n\n1505\n01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.890\nI'm gonna show you part of what,\nas soon as I say yes,\n\n1506\n01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:32.950\nI would still like to keep\nworking on the console.\n\n1507\n01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:37.220\nI'm gonna show you part of what\nhappened when we were troubleshooting.\n\n1508\n01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.930\nI talked to you about how to go in and\nlook at the status and\n\n1509\n01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:41.900\nlook at the status viewer\nto see what the error was.\n\n1510\n01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:44.390\nWhat I didn't show you was\nwhat we did to go in and\n\n1511\n01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:47.990\ncheck all the settings to figure\nout that it indeed was the proxy.\n\n1512\n01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:51.440\nNow this is also an important piece of\nthe puzzle because from a troubleshooting\n\n1513\n01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.270\nperspective, there may be times we have\nto go back and check the setup and\n\n1514\n01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:58.397\nthe configuration of a site role\nin order to figure out whether or\n\n1515\n01:13:58.397 --> 01:13:59.600\nnot it's running the right way.\n\n1516\n01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.000\nYou need to know where to go to do this.\n\n1517\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.650\nSo we haven't really shown you this\nbefore and talked about this, so\n\n1518\n01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:05.280\nI want to take the opportunity\nto do that for you now.\n\n1519\n01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.890\nSo we can go back to wide screen so\n\n1520\n01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:09.480\nwe can see this,\nit'll be a little bit easier to show you.\n\n1521\n01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:13.570\nAnd so what we're gonna do, I'm gonna\nzoom in just so you can see where we are.\n\n1522\n01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:16.750\nI am in the Servers and\nSite System Roles area.\n\n1523\n01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:20.060\nI've got my Site server there, I've\ngot all my roles here, as you can see.\n\n1524\n01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:24.520\nAnd we have a couple of options, we can\nright click on the role itself down there.\n\n1525\n01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.190\nDo properties and get a little bit\nof the configuration information but\n\n1526\n01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:30.060\nmost of what we need to see\nis not going to be there.\n\n1527\n01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:32.030\nAnd people get confused\na lot of the time and\n\n1528\n01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:35.800\nthey don't realize that there's more than\none place to go to check configurations.\n\n1529\n01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.990\nSo I'm going to show you both places.\n\n1530\n01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:39.120\nWe're going to start with\nthe site roles right here.\n\n1531\n01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.340\nBut them I'm gonna take you to the other\nplace that most people don't know about.\n\n1532\n01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.220\nWhy?\nBecause we like you, and\n\n1533\n01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:48.640\nbecause Mike threatened to move my car\nfurther away if I didn't do this for\n\n1534\n01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.470\nyou and\nit's already very far way today because\n\n1535\n01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:54.240\nthere was no valet parker when\nwe showed up this morning.\n\n1536\n01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.655\nAll right, so I'm going to go ahead and\n\n1537\n01:14:55.655 --> 01:14:58.350\nI'm gonna right click on\nthe Software update point.\n\n1538\n01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:00.650\nWe're going to do that and\nwe'll get a Properties item.\n\n1539\n01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:02.140\nJust scroll in so\nyou can see that real quick.\n\n1540\n01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.470\nIt's really simple, right?\n\n1541\n01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:05.080\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n1542\n01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:07.450\nGo to Properties.\n\n1543\n01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:10.610\nNow, what we get on this one\nis really just two screens and\n\n1544\n01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:13.830\nthese are pretty limited but\nwe'll scroll down so you can see it.\n\n1545\n01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:17.190\nWe have the ability to see\nwhat ports we are using cuz\n\n1546\n01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:20.370\nthis is the server 2012 config with 8530,\n8531.\n\n1547\n01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:24.870\nWhether we're acquiring the SSL and what\nkind of client connections that we want.\n\n1548\n01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:27.180\nNow, that's important stuff, right?\n\n1549\n01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:30.320\nAnd then we have proxy and\naccount settings.\n\n1550\n01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.350\nAnd we could see what proxy settings\nwe chose, user proxy to connect and\n\n1551\n01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:36.190\nwhat account we were using for that.\n\n1552\n01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:39.765\nBut we don't have any of the other\nconfiguration areas like,\n\n1553\n01:15:39.765 --> 01:15:41.335\nhey how did we set this up?\n\n1554\n01:15:41.335 --> 01:15:43.615\nWhat's our download area gonna be?\n\n1555\n01:15:43.615 --> 01:15:46.325\nWhat's all the parameters that\nwe specified in the wizard\n\n1556\n01:15:46.325 --> 01:15:47.685\nas we were setting this thing up?\n\n1557\n01:15:47.685 --> 01:15:48.845\nGo out to Microsoft and\n\n1558\n01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:51.795\ndownload from there,\ndon't download using an internal one.\n\n1559\n01:15:51.795 --> 01:15:53.935\nAll that other stuff is somewhere else.\n\n1560\n01:15:53.935 --> 01:15:55.995\nSo we're gonna go take a look\nat that right now as well.\n\n1561\n01:15:57.795 --> 01:16:02.210\nSo let's go in here, and now what I'm\ngonna do instead is I'm gonna go instead,\n\n1562\n01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:04.054\nand let's just come over here real quick.\n\n1563\n01:16:04.054 --> 01:16:07.300\nWe're gonna come over here to Sites, and\nI'll zoom in so you could see this, and\n\n1564\n01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:11.470\nI'm just gonna highlight the site server,\nhowever before I do that.\n\n1565\n01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:13.030\nSo now we're gonna go up one level.\n\n1566\n01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:17.330\nYou can see now we're on the Sites as\nopposed to Server and Site System Roles.\n\n1567\n01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:20.390\nAnd under Sites,\nI've highlighted my Primary site.\n\n1568\n01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:24.920\nAnd what I have here, is an interesting\nlittle doodad right there,\n\n1569\n01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.280\nsays Configure Site Components.\n\n1570\n01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.530\nHiding in plain sight as they say.\n\n1571\n01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:33.220\nAnd so what I can do,\nis I can come over here,\n\n1572\n01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:37.480\nI can pull that down, I'm gonna\nhighlight the one we're gonna want.\n\n1573\n01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.630\nBut you'll see that we now have\nan option to go in and configure.\n\n1574\n01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:46.230\nNow not every site role has an additional\nconfiguration option here because some of\n\n1575\n01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:48.820\nthem are just simple and you configure\nthem and boom they're done and\n\n1576\n01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.550\nthe settings you see are the settings\nyou get in the other area.\n\n1577\n01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:54.350\nBut certain ones have additional settings.\n\n1578\n01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:56.800\nThe ones that have additional\nsettings wind up here and so\n\n1579\n01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.040\nwe have to know to go\nto actually get here.\n\n1580\n01:16:59.040 --> 01:16:59.620\nSo for instance,\n\n1581\n01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:03.270\nnotice Management Point is there,\nSoftware Distribution is there, right?\n\n1582\n01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:06.350\nFor Software Distribution,\nput software out, that kind of thing.\n\n1583\n01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:09.060\nSo we need to know that we may have\nto come in here at certain points\n\n1584\n01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.140\nto do certain things.\n\n1585\n01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:14.480\nSo we came in here,\nwent to Software Update Point.\n\n1586\n01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.110\nWe'll click on that.\n\n1587\n01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:20.065\nGive that a second to come up and now\nwe're gonna see the component properties.\n\n1588\n01:17:20.065 --> 01:17:22.430\nAnd we're gonna see all the bells and\nwhistles here.\n\n1589\n01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:27.550\nWe have our Sync Setting tab,\nClassifications, Products.\n\n1590\n01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:31.300\nSo, let's say I wanted to add products in,\ncuz once you make that choice one time\n\n1591\n01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.290\nit's not like you can never go back,\nright?\n\n1592\n01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:35.740\nOf course you're gonna wanna go back and\nmake a change at some point.\n\n1593\n01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:36.980\nHow do we do that, right?\n\n1594\n01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.940\nWell, you could uninstall the role and\nreinstall it.\n\n1595\n01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:39.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1596\n01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.130\nthat would be kind of tedious every time,\nright?\n\n1597\n01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:45.128\nAnd so instead, we come in here, we can\nchoose products and we can add products.\n\n1598\n01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:47.676\nSync Schedule,\nlet's say we want to change that.\n\n1599\n01:17:47.676 --> 01:17:49.155\nSupersedence Rules and/or Languages,\n\n1600\n01:17:49.155 --> 01:17:52.055\ncuz maybe we do actually want to\nadd additional language support in.\n\n1601\n01:17:52.055 --> 01:17:52.865\n>> Yeah.\n>> You could do any or\n\n1602\n01:17:52.865 --> 01:17:53.955\nall of that right here.\n\n1603\n01:17:53.955 --> 01:17:56.255\nSo we're able to go in and\ndo all that after the fact.\n\n1604\n01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:58.765\nSo I came in here behind the scenes and\n\n1605\n01:17:58.765 --> 01:18:01.965\nwas checking everything to make sure that\nI hadn't made a mistake inadvertently with\n\n1606\n01:18:01.965 --> 01:18:04.315\nthe configuration that\nwas causing the problem.\n\n1607\n01:18:04.315 --> 01:18:06.940\nAnd figured out pretty quickly,\nnope, all those settings look good.\n\n1608\n01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:09.825\nGotta be the proxy credential issue.\n\n1609\n01:18:09.825 --> 01:18:12.430\nAnd sure enough, we went back,\nwe checked, looked at the logs,\n\n1610\n01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:15.750\ndid a little troubleshooting,\ncross referenced that information,\n\n1611\n01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:19.070\napplied some common sense and\nwe figured out that indeed it was and\n\n1612\n01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:21.410\nwe were able to fix the problem\nas a result of that.\n\n1613\n01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:23.010\nSo, just wanted to show you\n\n1614\n01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.370\nthat particular issue in that area as\nwell because that's one of those little\n\n1615\n01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:30.310\nhidden gems that we don't\nalways realize is there.\n\n1616\n01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:32.830\nAnd unless you know it's there,\nit's going to drive you\n\n1617\n01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:35.690\nabsolutely nuts trying to figure\nout how to troubleshoot it and\n\n1618\n01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:39.360\nget the settings cuz you know they're\nthere but you just can't find them.\n\n1619\n01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.700\n>> I know I would have been spending\na lot of time on the role itself,\n\n1620\n01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.250\nnot looking at the site for\nthat kind of information.\n\n1621\n01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:47.420\n>> Right, and then what would\nultimately have happened is,\n\n1622\n01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:50.610\nyou would probably at some point have\nsaid well, it's gotta be there, right?\n\n1623\n01:18:50.610 --> 01:18:53.520\nSo you tear the console apart or\nyou'd Google and find out sure enough,\n\n1624\n01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.660\nyeah we go there.\n\n1625\n01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:56.891\nOr you would do what\none of my clients did.\n\n1626\n01:18:56.891 --> 01:18:59.546\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, Microsoft must have a reason,\n\n1627\n01:18:59.546 --> 01:19:02.343\nit's not there so\nI gotta uninstall, right?\n\n1628\n01:19:02.343 --> 01:19:04.134\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what you do.\n\n1629\n01:19:04.134 --> 01:19:05.070\nIt's not there.\n\n1630\n01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:08.410\nIt must have gone away and so\nif I reinstall, it'll reappear.\n\n1631\n01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.760\nAnd so they uninstalled a production.\n\n1632\n01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.410\n>> Oh no.\n>> Production level role which does fix\n\n1633\n01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:15.250\nthe problem because when you reinstall,\nthe wizard runs,\n\n1634\n01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.224\nyou get everything back again.\n\n1635\n01:19:16.224 --> 01:19:19.520\nBut they called me, and\nI love this about clients,\n\n1636\n01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.260\nclients are great,\nit's like having a dog, right?\n\n1637\n01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.062\nAll they wanna do is just please you, so\n\n1638\n01:19:24.062 --> 01:19:27.760\nthey will go out of their way to make\nsure, but they then wanna tell you\n\n1639\n01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.380\nwhat they did so that you're happy and you\ngive them props for doing the right thing.\n\n1640\n01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:33.140\nSo they did it.\n\n1641\n01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.456\nNice client, good client, good client.\n\n1642\n01:19:35.456 --> 01:19:36.700\nHere's a treat.\n\n1643\n01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:38.189\nAnd so they did it and\nthen they called me.\n\n1644\n01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:42.110\nNot before they did it, which would\nhave actually been the right thing to do\n\n1645\n01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:43.504\nbecause I could've stopped them.\n\n1646\n01:19:43.504 --> 01:19:46.124\nThey did it then they called\nme afterwards, all excited,\n\n1647\n01:19:46.124 --> 01:19:47.838\nyou'll never guess what we just did.\n\n1648\n01:19:47.838 --> 01:19:48.587\nWe fixed a problem.\n\n1649\n01:19:48.587 --> 01:19:50.046\nLet me tell you what we did.\n\n1650\n01:19:50.046 --> 01:19:52.560\nAnd they proceed to tell me\nthey uninstalled the roll, and\n\n1651\n01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.545\nthen reinstalled it.\n\n1652\n01:19:53.545 --> 01:19:54.875\nThis is in production.\n\n1653\n01:19:54.875 --> 01:19:57.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now thankfully uninstalling\n\n1654\n01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:59.670\nthe software update roll is not the end\nof the world because you don't really\n\n1655\n01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:02.485\naffect anything in\nproduction that's going on.\n\n1656\n01:20:02.485 --> 01:20:04.725\nOther than the patch\nmanagement capabilities.\n\n1657\n01:20:04.725 --> 01:20:08.098\nYou're not uninstalling the server,\nbut you are blowing out the catalog.\n\n1658\n01:20:08.098 --> 01:20:08.955\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1659\n01:20:08.955 --> 01:20:10.155\n>> So one of the problems is you\n\n1660\n01:20:10.155 --> 01:20:10.915\ngotta rebuild that.\n\n1661\n01:20:10.915 --> 01:20:12.045\nBut it's not the end of the world.\n\n1662\n01:20:12.045 --> 01:20:13.575\nIt takes a little time.\n\n1663\n01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:15.235\nIt's not the worst thing you can do.\n\n1664\n01:20:15.235 --> 01:20:16.235\nBut they called me.\n\n1665\n01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:19.835\nAnd they said hey so this is what\nthe problem was, this is what we did.\n\n1666\n01:20:19.835 --> 01:20:24.680\nCuz you've told us hey,\ntry to be a little bit forward thinking,\n\n1667\n01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.240\ndo a little diagnosis,\nfigure stuff out, work on your run.\n\n1668\n01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.000\nIf we can't figure it out call you.\n\n1669\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.970\nI said yeah but you're suppose to\nask before you do stuff, right.\n\n1670\n01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:36.610\nI want you to be self sufficient,\nthat's good do that but ask first.\n\n1671\n01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:38.660\nWould have saved you a lot of time and\ntrouble.\n\n1672\n01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:39.940\nLuckily they didn't damage anything,\n\n1673\n01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.320\nit just took a little bit of\ntime to rebuild everything.\n\n1674\n01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.911\nBut they uninstalled and sure enough, you\nrun the wizard again, all those settings\n\n1675\n01:20:45.911 --> 01:20:49.060\nare available, but you could've fixed\nthe problem just by knowing where to go.\n\n1676\n01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.295\n>> Right.\n>> In the first place, right?\n\n1677\n01:20:50.295 --> 01:20:53.340\nSo, sometimes it's good to be out\non that limb and thinking about it.\n\n1678\n01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:56.130\nSometimes when you're sawing the limb\nas you're looking back at the tree and\n\n1679\n01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:59.400\nyou're on the wrong side of it,\nyou may want to pause momentarily and\n\n1680\n01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.270\nponder whether or not gravity does\nwork cuz usually you find out it does.\n\n1681\n01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:05.380\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna quickly go to Mike's machine.\n\n1682\n01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:07.840\nWant to just wrap up a couple of\nlast minute items that we have\n\n1683\n01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.120\non the list there for you.\n\n1684\n01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:14.089\nThat we promised you about doing\nautomatic update deployment rules and\n\n1685\n01:21:14.089 --> 01:21:17.025\nthen we are going to wrap up this episode.\n\n1686\n01:21:17.025 --> 01:21:17.770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1687\n01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:19.670\n>> Because I have nothing left to say.\n\n1688\n01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:22.780\nWhich is not very common and\ndoes not happen very often.\n\n1689\n01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:25.620\nAll right, so what is the process for\ncreating an automatic deployment rule?\n\n1690\n01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:26.940\nYou see we've documented this for you.\n\n1691\n01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:29.830\nNow we just ran through this in\nthe wizard, you saw me do this.\n\n1692\n01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:32.810\nBut as we always try to do when\nwe do the demonstrations for you.\n\n1693\n01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:35.420\nTrying to summarize that and\ngive you some steps that you can rely on.\n\n1694\n01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:36.630\nYou can look at.\n\n1695\n01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:38.890\nYou can use as you're\nstudying as reference.\n\n1696\n01:21:38.890 --> 01:21:39.390\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n1697\n01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:40.210\n>> So that way it's always\n\n1698\n01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:41.290\na good thing to do that.\n\n1699\n01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:44.510\nSo you'll see here we have the steps\nthat we more or less followed and\n\n1700\n01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:45.910\nthe wizard laid out for you.\n\n1701\n01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:46.990\nSo you can take a look at them.\n\n1702\n01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:49.630\nSo you'll just want to make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n1703\n01:21:49.630 --> 01:21:51.900\nAnd that you have a sense of what we did.\n\n1704\n01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.810\nLet's go ahead and let's talk,\nor let's rather not talk.\n\n1705\n01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:59.250\nBut let's move to the monitoring\ndeployment of software updates.\n\n1706\n01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:01.600\nI think we have some status\nmessages we put up there as well,\n\n1707\n01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.350\nif I remember correctly.\n\n1708\n01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.930\nRight?\n\n1709\n01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:04.780\nDeploy software,\nyou think going the other way.\n\n1710\n01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:05.500\nThere you go, yeah.\n\n1711\n01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.540\nIt's not up, it must be down.\n\n1712\n01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:07.389\n>> It must be.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1713\n01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:08.600\n>> That's right, it must be down.\n\n1714\n01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:13.420\nSo when we are monitoring software update\ndeployments, and I showed you this,\n\n1715\n01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:15.110\nwe saw that it was already\ngreen when it was there.\n\n1716\n01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:16.790\nBut we do have the monitoring workspace,\n\n1717\n01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:19.600\nthat's what I showed you where the pie\nchart was there, it was all green.\n\n1718\n01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.320\nSaid oh, success.\n\n1719\n01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.415\nWe have status messages and alerts which\nshowed you the value of status messages\n\n1720\n01:22:25.415 --> 01:22:28.255\nwhen I went in and showed you how we\ndebunked the problem and went and\n\n1721\n01:22:28.255 --> 01:22:33.685\nsaw the different status updates on or\nin the the event viewer, right in the log.\n\n1722\n01:22:33.685 --> 01:22:35.530\nWe took a look at that so you saw that.\n\n1723\n01:22:35.530 --> 01:22:37.760\nAnd we have alerts as well,\nso these are valuable.\n\n1724\n01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.190\nWe do have some reports that\nare specific to software updates,\n\n1725\n01:22:40.190 --> 01:22:42.750\nthought we'd just give you\na preview of what those are.\n\n1726\n01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.090\nThere's a bunch of different ones there.\n\n1727\n01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:46.320\nWe can do compliance,\ndeployment management,\n\n1728\n01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.060\ndeployment states, scanning and/or\ntroubleshooting, so you've got those.\n\n1729\n01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.680\nAnd then we have a couple of log files for\nsoftware updates,\n\n1730\n01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.450\none of which came in handy for\ntroubleshooting.\n\n1731\n01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:55.960\n>> Yes, it did.\n>> Because I talked to you about that and\n\n1732\n01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.460\nwe actually took a look at that.\n\n1733\n01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:03.240\nBut we do have WCM log as you can see and\nW Sync Manager log on the site server.\n\n1734\n01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:06.690\nWe have the software update\npoint which is the WSUS server.\n\n1735\n01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:11.770\nWe could see that, that's WSUSctrl.log,\nthe Softwaredistribution.log and\n\n1736\n01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:14.960\non the client side, if we do get that far.\n\n1737\n01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.400\nAnd we have some things going on, but\n\n1738\n01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.330\nwe're thinking maybe there's\na problem with the agent settings.\n\n1739\n01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:22.420\nMaybe there's a problem with\none of the configurations.\n\n1740\n01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.726\nWe could take a look at the five\nlogs that are listed there.\n\n1741\n01:23:23.726 --> 01:23:28.665\nScanAgent.log, WUA update handler.log,\nwhich is a Windows update agent handler,\n\n1742\n01:23:28.665 --> 01:23:32.430\nWindows update, updates handler,\nand/or updateStore.log.\n\n1743\n01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:36.530\nSo we just want to make sure\nwe're aware of that and\n\n1744\n01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:38.620\nwe have that in the back of our mind.\n\n1745\n01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.590\nRemember, and I will remind you again,\njust while we're finishing up on this\n\n1746\n01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:44.970\nscreen, that the reason we're throwing\nthose logfile references out there for\n\n1747\n01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:45.590\nyou is twofold.\n\n1748\n01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:48.780\nNumber one, because you do obviously\nwanna know that they exist and\n\n1749\n01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:49.410\nthey are valuable.\n\n1750\n01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:52.550\nAnd in this case,\nin the real troubleshooting scenario\n\n1751\n01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:56.720\nthat we went through, they actually proved\nto be invaluable to solving the problem.\n\n1752\n01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.630\nBut in addition, in the real worlds\nyou need to know where these are if\n\n1753\n01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:02.990\nyou have an issue and you may be\nasked about them at some point and so\n\n1754\n01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:05.740\nyou do have to have knowledge\nof them just in case.\n\n1755\n01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.430\n>> Very good.\nAll right Adam, fantastic episode.\n\n1756\n01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:13.500\nGreat hands on look at, at the entire\nprocess of doing our software updates and\n\n1757\n01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.140\neven some troubleshooting.\n\n1758\n01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:18.800\nI always say that sometimes when things go\nwrong that's when you learn the most cuz\n\n1759\n01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.240\nyou really get to dive in there and\nsee what the heck is going on.\n\n1760\n01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.325\nAnd the behind the scenes tour of\nwhere to find some of those things so\n\n1761\n01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:27.800\nwe don't have to uninstall the rule\nto get those settings back.\n\n1762\n01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.705\nAlways handy.\n\n1763\n01:24:28.705 --> 01:24:30.460\nThanks for that Adam, we appreciate that.\n\n1764\n01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:32.240\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n1765\n01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.080\nRemember if you wanna attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n1766\n01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.500\nshoot us an email here\nat SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n1767\n01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.410\nSigning off I'm Mike

00:00:16.841\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:22.262\nToday we're doing our system center\nconfiguration manager 2012 R2 content.\n\n5\n00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:26.329\nIn this episode we're gonna be looking\nat Managing compliance when it comes to\n\n6\n00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.682\ncompliance settings compliance profiles.\n\n7\n00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:30.005\nWait did I get that right?\n\n8\n00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.222\nCompliant settings and compliant policies.\n\n9\n00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:33.685\n>> No you're right you're close enough.\n\n10\n00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:34.650\n>> Very good right?\n\n11\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.080\n>> That's good enough for\ngovernment work as we say so that'll work.\n\n12\n00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.900\n>> That's why we have and that's why\nwe have the expert Adam Gordon here.\n\n13\n00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.710\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.365\n>> It's going well.\n\n15\n00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:42.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we're going to do,\n\n16\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.640\nwe're going to spend a little\nbit of time talking.\n\n17\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.110\nI never know where to look, the red\nlights just keep bouncing left right.\n\n18\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.300\nAnd you know it's just crazy here, crazy I\nsay on Friday evening, so we're going to\n\n19\n00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.830\ntalk about compliance settings and how to\nset up configuration items and baselines.\n\n20\n00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.290\nAnd the idea behind compliance and\ncompliance management is not new.\n\n21\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.087\nThis is something that is actually\na thought process that exists and\n\n22\n00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:06.286\nhas existed for\nsometime both outside of this product and\n\n23\n00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:10.233\nin theory outside of any of the asset\nmanagement products that we use.\n\n24\n00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:14.294\nRemember, although we hear to talk about\nMicrosoft system center config manager,\n\n25\n00:01:14.294 --> 00:01:17.953\nthis is not the only asset management\nproduct in the world, there are many,\n\n26\n00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:21.328\nmany products from many vendors to\ndo basically the identical thing so\n\n27\n00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:22.990\nwe're talking about here.\n\n28\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.510\nWe're not allowed to name them because\nof the fact that you know if we do,\n\n29\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.530\nwell you know, your software may randomly\nstop working and things would happen.\n\n30\n00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.581\n>> ITProTV explodes.\n\n31\n00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:36.514\n>> We don't want that to happen, but you\nknow things like HP openview, IBM Tivoli,\n\n32\n00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:39.930\nthere are many, many of these\nproducts out there on the market.\n\n33\n00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.190\nAnd so compliance generically is\nthe idea of being able to go in and\n\n34\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.780\nto establish a configuration baseline,\nor some sort of a standard that we will\n\n35\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.390\nmanage against, manage to,\nand manage from.\n\n36\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.420\nNow that baseline is gonna be made\nup of individual building blocks,\n\n37\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.555\nthese are called configuration items,\nor, in the language, or\n\n38\n00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:03.830\nthe parlance, another cool word there you\ncan add to the vocabulary list for you.\n\n39\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.500\nIn the parlance or\nlanguage of change management,\n\n40\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.340\nconfiguration management generically\nin these frameworks we so\n\n41\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.460\noften talk about,\nwe call these configuration items or CIs.\n\n42\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.990\nAnd we put these CIs into a configuration\nmanagement database what's called a CMDB.\n\n43\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.690\nWe combine them together into what is\nknown as a configuration baseline.\n\n44\n00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.842\nWe call that a configuration baseline,\nwe don't have a cool acronym for that one,\n\n45\n00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:29.030\nit's just called a configuration baseline.\n\n46\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.980\nAnd as a result of that, we then can take\nthat baseline, and we can apply it, and\n\n47\n00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.010\nwe will show you how to do this\nin the console in a few minutes.\n\n48\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.320\nWe can apply it, and\nwe can then use it, and\n\n49\n00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.710\nwe can measure all the systems against it.\n\n50\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.120\nSee whether those systems are indeed\ngoing to be in compliance,\n\n51\n00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.090\nin compliance means that\nthe baseline is applied,\n\n52\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.710\nthe settings are being managed\nappropriately and the system is in effect\n\n53\n00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.810\nconfigured the way the baseline says it\nshould be, or they are out of compliance.\n\n54\n00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.280\nOut of compliance means that while\nthe settings are listed in the compliance\n\n55\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.580\nbaseline, those settings are not applied,\nand for some reason are not\n\n56\n00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.990\nbeing managed here, and then we can\ndecide to do what's called remediate.\n\n57\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.930\nGo back and change or effect a change in\nthat system by applying the baseline and\n\n58\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.280\nthe changing the current configuration.\n\n59\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.430\nSo we're gonna talk\nthrough how that works,\n\n60\n00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.330\nand what the building blocks and\nmoving parts are with system center,\n\n61\n00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.535\nin order to get that done and\nthen when we are finish as we always do.\n\n62\n00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:22.985\nWe'll come back out, we wrap up, we'll\nshow you the pretty picture that Mike has\n\n63\n00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:26.805\ncreated for this along with some lists\nof things that would just be helpful for\n\n64\n00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:31.385\nyou, to just kind of remember and wrap up\nand consolidate all that knowledge for us.\n\n65\n00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:35.025\nSo, if we can go and\ntake a look at the console and\n\n66\n00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:39.460\nwe'll take a look at what's going on there\nand this is gonna be the really cool one.\n\n67\n00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.840\nIf we can go ahead and we can go are you\nready, do it with me, can we put Mike and\n\n68\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.540\nme in the same picture at the same time\nand keep the console there as well.\n\n69\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.700\n>> I don't know if you can do that,\nlet's see.\n\n70\n00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.690\n>> I don't know if you can do that.\n\n71\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.280\nDo we have picture in picture in picture?\n\n72\n00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.690\nI'd have to hold a mirror up we could do\nlike the whole mirrored hallway thing.\n\n73\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.570\nAll right so just do me, but\n\n74\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.716\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\ngo big jazz hand finish, fullscreen.\n\n75\n00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:00.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay there we go outstanding.\n\n76\n00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.220\n>> All right so we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna take a look at this.\n\n77\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.570\nSo let me just zoom in here real quick and\nshow you where we are.\n\n78\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.230\nThat's what we always do we want to start\nout knowing what part of the console we're\n\n79\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.240\ngonna manage from, we're in assets and\n\n80\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.500\ncompliance in that work space and\nup here, we're in compliance settings.\n\n81\n00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.140\nYou could see it right there and\nI've highlighted configuration items, so\n\n82\n00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.430\nwe're gonna go ahead and take a look at\nthat, so we're gonna start in over here.\n\n83\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.530\nWe'll notice that we have no configuration\nitems which actually makes a lot of sense\n\n84\n00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.850\nif you think about because we have not\nset up anything or specified that we want\n\n85\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.900\ncertain configurations,\nto be captured out of the box.\n\n86\n00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.410\nWe're going to provide those,\nso we're going to go ahead,\n\n87\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.870\nwe're going to right-click and we will\nchoose to create a configuration item.\n\n88\n00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.580\nBut we also notice that we\ncan import configuration data\n\n89\n00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.510\nfrom somewhere else if we choose to.\n\n90\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.430\nVendors may give us configuration items\nthat we can populate to use their\n\n91\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.470\nsolutions, to build baselines for\ntheir products.\n\n92\n00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.730\nSo we do have the ability to do that\nif we choose to, but I'm old school and\n\n93\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.740\nhardcore and we're gonna create our\nown because that's just what we do,\n\n94\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.680\nthat's how we roll here at ITProTV.\n\n95\n00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.820\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and we are going\nto give that a name, you know we\n\n96\n00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.920\ncan call this whatever it is that we may\nwanna do, something like CI Bobcat, why?\n\n97\n00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.530\nCuz, I don't know, it just sounds cool,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.200\n>> That's what we're gonna do.\n\n99\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.030\nSo were gonna call that one that and then\nwhat we have to do is specify what it is\n\n100\n00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.920\nthat we actually want to create the,\nCI, configuration item for.\n\n101\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.350\nNotice we have the option for\nWindows, Mobile Devices and Mac OS X.\n\n102\n00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.230\nWe actually can configure and create CIs\nfor the Mac platform, which is kind of,\n\n103\n00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.750\ninterestingly nice, however notice that\nLinux is suspiciously absent there.\n\n104\n00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.750\nThought I'd point that out, for those of\nyou out there going, yeah, that's cool but\n\n105\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.460\nyou left out the most\nimportant operating system.\n\n106\n00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.650\nJust thought I'd mention that,\nall right, so now we can go ahead, and\n\n107\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.510\nwe can decide to assign categories\nto improve search and filtering.\n\n108\n00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.080\nLet me just zoom in here for a second so\nyou could see that, this is really about\n\n109\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.870\nthe metadata management, right, if you are\ndown with and familiar with the idea of\n\n110\n00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.820\ntagging things In order to be\nable to make searching easier.\n\n111\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.530\nWe're really just talking about categories\nas another way of referencing tags and\n\n112\n00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.390\nmetadata, to be able to make\nthese items a little bit more\n\n113\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.590\neasily accessible through searching,\nthat's all we're doing.\n\n114\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.480\nSo we could do that if we want to,\n\n115\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.680\nwe're not gonna waste any time doing\nthat right now, but that's up to us.\n\n116\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.100\nSo we'll go ahead and click Next here,\nand then what we have to do,\n\n117\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.700\nis we have to decide what version and\nor what versions of\n\n118\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.800\nWindows we will assess this configuration\nitem for compliance against.\n\n119\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.680\nAnd notice we have everything in there\nfrom windows XP all the way forward to\n\n120\n00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.090\nserver 12 R2, Windows 10 is\nobviously not there right now.\n\n121\n00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.910\nWe'll be adding that in with\nadditional features that support\n\n122\n00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.290\nas we continue to evolve, but for the\nmoment, we see we have everything in there\n\n123\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.900\nthat we most likely would wanna be able\nto use including operating systems that\n\n124\n00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.645\nare [LAUGH] no longer in market and\nbeing supported.\n\n125\n00:06:58.645 --> 00:07:00.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I love it when that happens.\n\n126\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n127\n00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.850\nso we obviously can have that.\n\n128\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.620\nWe could also specify the Windows version\nmanually, down here at the bottom if we\n\n129\n00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.620\nchoose to, put that in,\nwe can click Add right there.\n\n130\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.850\nAnd if we do that, we do have to know\na little bit of information here.\n\n131\n00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.680\nWe do have to specify this but\nwe have to know the build number, major,\n\n132\n00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.100\nminor version and service pack updates,\nso we do just have to be aware of that.\n\n133\n00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.090\nSo just be aware of that, are,\njust be aware of that twice, sorry,\n\n134\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.240\nI'm babbling on incoherently here.\n\n135\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.290\nJust make sure that you know, and it's not\njust a matter of making up a number string\n\n136\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.930\nhere, by the way,\nI want to be clear about this.\n\n137\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.340\nBecause there actually are, you have, darn\nit, one, two, three, is not going to work,\n\n138\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.930\nthere is actually a format and\na form that these have to follow and\n\n139\n00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.590\nwe have need the right build numbers\nto specify the right operating system.\n\n140\n00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.337\nAnd so you'd have to go out and Google for\nthat and make sure you get that.\n\n141\n00:07:54.337 --> 00:07:58.701\nIf it's something like hypothetically for\ninstance Windows 10 and we wanted to add\n\n142\n00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.701\nthat in we would have to go out and get\nthe actual build number From Microsoft and\n\n143\n00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:06.660\nhave the right one in order to be able to\nactually have that work the right way.\n\n144\n00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.910\nSo just be aware of that,\nthat is important.\n\n145\n00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.840\nWe don't just randomly put some\nsort of a string in there, right?\n\n146\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.524\nThat's gonna be a bit of an issue,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n147\n00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:19.835\nAll right, so we're gonna hit Cancel\nthere, we are going to hit Next,\n\n148\n00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:23.376\noh, wait one second, sorry.\n\n149\n00:08:23.376 --> 00:08:24.660\nGotta go back [LAUGH] and\n\n150\n00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.100\nspecify we actually want all\nthe ones that are selected up top.\n\n151\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.360\nI left it on the hey let\nme declare that string and\n\n152\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.940\nthen I didn't bother to\nput anything in there.\n\n153\n00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.630\nAll right, so what we're gonna\ndo is specify settings for\n\n154\n00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.080\nthis operating system.\n\n155\n00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.490\nThis is the kinda cool part,\nwe're gonna zoom in there,\n\n156\n00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.560\nwe're going to click New,\ngonna go ahead and do that.\n\n157\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.680\nI think we did that, there we go, yeah.\n\n158\n00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.290\nAnd so then what we're gonna\ndo is give that a name and\n\n159\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.310\nwe're gonna specify registry keys that\nwe wanna go in and we wanna look for.\n\n160\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.360\nCuz compliance is typically all about\nhow things are configured, and so\n\n161\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.720\nwe're gonna be delving into the registry,\nand looking at this key or that key.\n\n162\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.649\nRemember we just talked in our prior\nepisode about the reg keys and maybe there\n\n163\n00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.640\nwhen we do the install of the System\nCenter Protection Agent on the client, and\n\n164\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.310\nwe could obviously specify those\nreg keys or any other reg keys.\n\n165\n00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.400\nYou ever wonder how Microsoft knows\nwhether you're actually using a licensed\n\n166\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.147\nproduct or not, or\n\n167\n00:09:13.147 --> 00:09:16.350\nyou're borrowing it from somebody without\nactually having the rights to do so?\n\n168\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.124\nWhile we do a registry scan looking for\nhacked reg keys and looking for\n\n169\n00:09:20.124 --> 00:09:24.419\nthe proper keys in the proper place and\nthat string for the proper version ID and\n\n170\n00:09:24.419 --> 00:09:25.900\nthe proper format.\n\n171\n00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.568\nThis is how we know,\nI'm letting the cat out of the bag, right?\n\n172\n00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:32.590\nAnd as Achmed as the terrorist would say,\nI have to kill you now, right?\n\n173\n00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.500\nBecause now you all know.\n\n174\n00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.400\nBut the reality is we could use\nthe strength of the registry to edit and\n\n175\n00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.580\nthen look for all sorts of things.\n\n176\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.483\nNow we have options not just in the\nsetting type there for registry value, but\n\n177\n00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:46.643\nlet's just take a look\nwhat else we can do,\n\n178\n00:09:46.643 --> 00:09:48.900\ncuz we have a lot of cool stuff in there.\n\n179\n00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.750\nRegistry value is just gonna\nbe the default setting.\n\n180\n00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.503\nBut, we can center that so we can see,\nwe have Active Directory queries,\n\n181\n00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:00.719\nAssembly, which will be a programmatic,\nwhat am I thinking of,\n\n182\n00:10:00.719 --> 00:10:05.910\na piece of program code, a compiled\nprogram, which will be the Assembly.\n\n183\n00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.500\nAlso we could be looking for that,\nwe could look for File system.\n\n184\n00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.260\nThe IIS metabase,\nwhich of you remember from one of our\n\n185\n00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.970\nprior conversations is a registry, but\nthe registry maintains separate from\n\n186\n00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.050\nthe Windows registry\nspecific to IIS sub system.\n\n187\n00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.010\nSo we could be looking at web server\nsettings, in other words reg keys,\n\n188\n00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:27.520\nreg values, scripts, SQL and or\nWQL queries, and XPath query.\n\n189\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.040\nWe've got quite a bit of stuff\nin there that we could do from\n\n190\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.080\na compliance standpoint.\n\n191\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.830\nAnd I would love to be able to sit here\nall night and demo each one of them for\n\n192\n00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.020\nyou in detail.\n\n193\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.061\nBut however, my mother gave me a note\nthat said I'm excused from doing that.\n\n194\n00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:43.850\nSo I'm gonna leave Mike here to\ncarry on that conversation with you.\n\n195\n00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.135\nSo let's just say hypothetically that\nwe do registry key for just a second.\n\n196\n00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:53.230\nYou'll obviously see that this will\nkind of organize itself here and change.\n\n197\n00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.375\nAnd what we can do is, we can go Browse,\nand we'll zoom in so you could see that.\n\n198\n00:10:57.375 --> 00:11:01.395\nWe then open up whatever key it is, and we\nactually are effectively in the registry,\n\n199\n00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.685\nwe're editing the registry\nnot to make changes, but\n\n200\n00:11:03.685 --> 00:11:08.245\nrather to go browse read-only, grab a key,\nand then specify that that's what we want.\n\n201\n00:11:08.245 --> 00:11:12.435\nSo we can go in, profile the system, and\nfigure out what it is we're looking for.\n\n202\n00:11:12.435 --> 00:11:16.939\nSo that's actually kinda cool, so\nwe'll go grab one, we'll just go ahead and\n\n203\n00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:20.650\ngrab one of those, we'll go into System,\nwe'll go into Setup.\n\n204\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:27.390\nJust move that out of the way there.\n\n205\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.548\nLet's go into Status and let's just\ntake that audit boot, I don't know,\n\n206\n00:11:31.548 --> 00:11:32.480\nwhatever it is.\n\n207\n00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.804\nSo we'll just take that one,\nwe'll make a selection just so\n\n208\n00:11:35.804 --> 00:11:37.920\nyou could see what it looks like.\n\n209\n00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.440\n>> You could see we have it there, it\nfills itself out, we're not doing this for\n\n210\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.496\neffect, we're just doing it just to demo,\nnot really concerned about what's there,\n\n211\n00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.050\ncuz we're not gonna use this for anything.\n\n212\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.660\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\nsay that as part of the setting down here,\n\n213\n00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.950\nwhich is what we do wanna know, Select\nthe rule that defines compliance for\n\n214\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.910\nthe selected registry key.\n\n215\n00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.355\nThe selected registry key\nmust exist on client devices,\n\n216\n00:11:57.355 --> 00:11:59.264\nThe selected registry key must not exist.\n\n217\n00:11:59.264 --> 00:12:00.650\n>> Nice.\n>> So again, we have that option.\n\n218\n00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.466\nSo if we have the reg key value that says,\nhey, we installed Windows and\n\n219\n00:12:04.466 --> 00:12:05.940\nthis is the proper string.\n\n220\n00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.770\nAnd we say, does not exist, guess what?\n\n221\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.790\nYou're using cracked or hacked software.\n\n222\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.370\nAnd as a result of that you\nhave a problem, [LAUGH] right?\n\n223\n00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.540\nSo this is the kinda logic we're using\nto go out and define these things.\n\n224\n00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.860\nSo we're gonna define that,\nwe'll click OK there, put that back in.\n\n225\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.995\nAnd then on the compliance rules area\nthat is the one that we just choose,\n\n226\n00:12:27.995 --> 00:12:29.440\nit says must exist, right?\n\n227\n00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.108\nSo we have all that, whoops,\nwe have all that, so we're gonna go ahead,\n\n228\n00:12:32.108 --> 00:12:33.020\nwe're gonna click OK.\n\n229\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:38.320\nWe'll just wait for that to get in there.\n\n230\n00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.416\nThat's there, we'll click Next,\nwe have our rules in there,\n\n231\n00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:44.840\nor we already did the rules, so\nno big deal, just click Summary.\n\n232\n00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.510\nClick Next, click Progress, make progress,\n\n233\n00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:53.270\nand then as soon as that is finished,\nit'll take just a moment.\n\n234\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.880\nOnce that comes up we'll then\nhave a configuration item,\n\n235\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.610\nwe can obviously have as many of these\nas we would like to use and or create.\n\n236\n00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.690\nSo we would be in the business of going\nin and creating a whole bunch of these.\n\n237\n00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.450\nSo we now our configuration item or items,\n\n238\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.050\nwe may have more than one sitting there,\nso you'll see we have that.\n\n239\n00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:15.240\nNow another thing that we could do is\nwe may decide that we wanna go in and\n\n240\n00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.500\nbring in from the outside configuration\ndata, remember, talking about importing.\n\n241\n00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.314\nSo there maybe vendor based data that we\nwanna bring in because they've already\n\n242\n00:13:22.314 --> 00:13:23.160\npopulated that for us.\n\n243\n00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.303\nSo I've gone ahead and arranged for\n\n244\n00:13:25.303 --> 00:13:28.740\nus to be able to do that because\nI am just that kind of a guy.\n\n245\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.157\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to Import Configuration Data,\n\n246\n00:13:33.157 --> 00:13:37.279\nyou could see it right up there,\nso we're gonna use that wizard and\n\n247\n00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:42.210\nwe are going to go out and we are going to\nadd right here, and we're gonna go up and\n\n248\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.930\nwere going to go grab that.\n\n249\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.440\nNow, I took the liberty of installing,\n\n250\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.126\nThe Configuration Management Pack or\nConfiguration Pack for\n\n251\n00:13:57.126 --> 00:14:00.690\nSystem Center 2012 Configuration Manager.\n\n252\n00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.474\nWe download that from the Internet, so\n\n253\n00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:04.920\nwe're pretending that\na vendor gave that to us.\n\n254\n00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.960\nBut we could get that, and vendors\nwill provide this, so we can go in and\n\n255\n00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.588\ngrab that.\n\n256\n00:14:08.588 --> 00:14:13.450\nAnd I'm gonna bring in that server\nrole's configuration pack right there,\n\n257\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.070\nand I'm going to effectively\ngo grab that cab file.\n\n258\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.650\nYou could see it right there,\nit is a cab file, I'm gonna explode that,\n\n259\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.950\nbring that in and\nimport what's inside of it.\n\n260\n00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.537\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n261\n00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:33.191\nGo ahead and import, and so we have\nour configuration baselines, so we're\n\n262\n00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:39.000\ngonna bring in some baselines and we have\nfour configuration items as part of this.\n\n263\n00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.140\nSo we're getting a configuration item for\n\n264\n00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.788\nSystem Center 2012\nConfig Manager Site Server, one for\n\n265\n00:14:44.788 --> 00:14:48.420\nWindows Server Update Services and\na couple for\n\n266\n00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.230\nlooks like Management Point and something\nelse, plus we're gonna get a baseline.\n\n267\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.700\nWe haven't done baselines yet,\nbut we'll get a baseline,\n\n268\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.570\nand we'll create our own baseline\nby bringing in config items.\n\n269\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.840\nSo we can get these packs from vendors,\nand\n\n270\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.780\nthey'll be preconfigured\nwith a bunch of stuff.\n\n271\n00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.380\nSo we'll go ahead and\n\n272\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.180\nwe'll click Next, we'll bring this in,\nit'll take just a minute to do the import,\n\n273\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.890\nand then we'll see those configuration\nitems populated in here.\n\n274\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.669\nSo we'll wait for these to show up.\n\n275\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:20.180\nWhen they do, we then will have five total\nCIs, and then we'll also have a baseline.\n\n276\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.668\nWe'll take a look at that, and\n\n277\n00:15:21.668 --> 00:15:25.275\nwe can use the configuration items to\nmake our own baseline, or as you saw,\n\n278\n00:15:25.275 --> 00:15:28.827\nwe can use pre-made baselines,\ncuz the vendor's providing one for us,\n\n279\n00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:32.230\nin this case that has all the\nconfiguration items associated with it.\n\n280\n00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.840\nAnd we'll be able to use\nthat if we choose to,\n\n281\n00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.650\nto then be able to drive compliance and\nto do some compliance monitoring.\n\n282\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:42.320\nSo we're just gonna let that run for\na second or two and get that to finish up.\n\n283\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.520\nUsually it doesn't take too long,\nbut it is the end of the day,\n\n284\n00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.465\nsystem's a little tired, gonna take\na little longer than normal most likely.\n\n285\n00:15:49.465 --> 00:15:51.004\nBut we'll go ahead and get that in there.\n\n286\n00:15:51.004 --> 00:15:53.176\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nas I said, create our own,\n\n287\n00:15:53.176 --> 00:15:56.045\nwe'll examine the baseline but then\nwe'll go ahead and we'll create our own.\n\n288\n00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:58.171\nThere it is, so we got that done.\n\n289\n00:15:58.171 --> 00:16:00.754\nWe see that populated\nbehind the scenes there.\n\n290\n00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:03.972\nJust go in and take a look,\nwe now suddenly, magically,\n\n291\n00:16:03.972 --> 00:16:05.860\nhave five configuration items.\n\n292\n00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.150\nWe can see them all there.\n\n293\n00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:14.700\nAnd, we now have,\nas soon as that refreshes, a baseline.\n\n294\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.385\nYou see the base line right there.\n\n295\n00:16:17.385 --> 00:16:19.050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n296\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:23.180\n>> And that baseline is enabled, so we can\nsee that, although it is not deployed.\n\n297\n00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.420\nWe can see that it is enabled,\nbut not deployed.\n\n298\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.590\nBut that is the one that\nwe just brought in.\n\n299\n00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:34.640\nWe can see that that has been set up,\nbut it is not actually deployed yet.\n\n300\n00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.080\nThe baseline evaluates\ndetected System Center.\n\n301\n00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.630\nConfig manager site server roles for\n\n302\n00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.370\ncompliance against known best\npractices from the vendor.\n\n303\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.670\nSo this will go through and\nprofile our system,\n\n304\n00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.620\ntell us whether we're aligning with\nbest practices from the vendor.\n\n305\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.610\nSo that's actually pretty cool, right?\n\n306\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.940\n>> Very cool.\n>> So we can go ahead and\n\n307\n00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.210\nlook at this one,\njust to see what it's doing.\n\n308\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.460\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe will take a look at Properties there.\n\n309\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.649\nAnd we'll go in quickly\njust bring that up.\n\n310\n00:17:04.379 --> 00:17:07.430\nAnd we have just a General tab,\nreally no big deal there.\n\n311\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.320\nWe have Evaluation Conditions,\nDeployments, so we'll take a look at those\n\n312\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.350\nreal quick, cuz that's kinda\nwhere the interesting stuff is.\n\n313\n00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:16.660\nWe have evaluation\nconfiguration data there.\n\n314\n00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.140\nWe're taking a look at the four\nconfiguration items that we brought in\n\n315\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.782\nalong with this,\nthat are gonna be used to evaluate this.\n\n316\n00:17:22.782 --> 00:17:26.200\nWe also can add our own down\nat the bottom if we choose to.\n\n317\n00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.838\nRight there, we can see that.\n\n318\n00:17:32.849 --> 00:17:36.860\nAnd then you'll notice that right now, we\ndo not have this actually deployed against\n\n319\n00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.580\nany of the following collections,\nbut we could if we wanted to.\n\n320\n00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.100\nSo we can go ahead right here.\n\n321\n00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:49.020\nWe can right-click on that and\nwe can go ahead and we can do a Deploy.\n\n322\n00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.750\nAnd so\nwe could zoom in do a deploy on that one.\n\n323\n00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.830\nThis is how we get it out there and\nwe've done deployments before.\n\n324\n00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:59.220\nYou know deployment is just SSM or\nSSCM codespeak for let me\n\n325\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.460\nthrow that up against the collection and\nthen apply it and see what happens.\n\n326\n00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.940\nAnd that's really all we're gonna do.\n\n327\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.890\nSo we would take a look here and\n\n328\n00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.555\nthis one looks little bit different\nthan the ones we've seen before.\n\n329\n00:18:08.555 --> 00:18:09.960\nWe'll go in and\n\n330\n00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.360\nwe'll specify what are, if we have more\nthan one available baselines maybe.\n\n331\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.180\nNow this one doesn't show as being\navailable cuz it's already been over\n\n332\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.250\nhere and move to select it because\nwe right-clicked on this one.\n\n333\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.790\nSo the nature of the model is\neither we have a list of them and\n\n334\n00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.000\nthen we choose or\nif we highlight one specifically and say,\n\n335\n00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.872\nhey I want that one, it automatically\nassumes that is the one we want.\n\n336\n00:18:29.872 --> 00:18:32.770\n>> So that's kind of indicating to me that\nwe might have more than one baseline that\n\n337\n00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:33.610\nwe want to apply.\n\n338\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.430\n>> Correct, we could but\nwe only one place in our demo.\n\n339\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.160\nWe're too lazy to make more than one,\nso that's why we only have one.\n\n340\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.380\nBut you're right, we could.\n\n341\n00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.610\nAnd we can remediate noncompliance when we\nfind it, so we can go ahead and do that.\n\n342\n00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.060\nWe have rules that we may generate.\n\n343\n00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.900\nWe can also generate alerts.\n\n344\n00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.950\nWe can select a collection for\nthis baseline, so\n\n345\n00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.950\nwe'll go put it on the all\nsystem collection.\n\n346\n00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.770\nWe schedule that as you can see and\nthen we click OK.\n\n347\n00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.750\nAnd we run that thing so\nit's actually fairly straightforward.\n\n348\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.571\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna Browse.\n\n349\n00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:03.730\nWe'll put that on to\nthe all systems collection.\n\n350\n00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.690\nBrowse one more time there we go.\n\n351\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.970\nAnd or we could do it to users.\n\n352\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.080\nBut in this case we'll\ndo it to the devices.\n\n353\n00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.080\nNow keep in mind as I've said before, in\nproduction we would not want to go in and\n\n354\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.610\ndo this against all systems.\n\n355\n00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.560\nTypically, we would wanna subdivide\nthe collections and do them some again\n\n356\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:26.120\nsomething that is going to be a little bit\nmore prescriptive and narrowly defined.\n\n357\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.550\nBut in our demo environment, we're\njust gonna throw caution to the wind.\n\n358\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:35.100\nAnd we're just gonna go all out and\nscan every system cuz we just don't care.\n\n359\n00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.290\nAll right, so we've applied that.\n\n360\n00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.770\nAnd so, when we come down here.\n\n361\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.040\nAnd we look at our Deployments tab, we can\nthen begin to see at the bottom there.\n\n362\n00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.910\nThat although we have not scanned yet\nfor compliance but we've deployed it.\n\n363\n00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.710\nWe do see that it is deployed\nto the all systems collection.\n\n364\n00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.650\nWe see compliance is set at 0 right now\ncuz we actually haven't done anything with\n\n365\n00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.460\nit, we just kinda put it out there.\n\n366\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.760\nBut once we get it out there and\nwe start scanning,\n\n367\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.710\nwe then actually can go ahead and\npotentially start to see data coming back.\n\n368\n00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.150\nAnd we then actually can decide whether or\nnot we are compliant and\n\n369\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:11.690\nif so, to what percentage?\n\n370\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.478\nSo we will then be able to actually go\nin and start to gather up useful data.\n\n371\n00:20:15.478 --> 00:20:17.260\nSo we're taking a look at that and\n\n372\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.740\nobviously we're able to Refresh there\nover time and see what that looks like.\n\n373\n00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.240\nIt takes some time to actually\nhave that come in and to run that.\n\n374\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.910\nWhat we would do is now that we've\ndeployed that, we can go in and\n\n375\n00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:35.840\nwe can Run Summarization so we can\nsummarize and get the status on that.\n\n376\n00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.590\nWe're probably not gonna get anything\nright now because we just deployed it,\n\n377\n00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.960\nbut we'll Run Summarization just to\nshow you what that may look like.\n\n378\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.580\nAt least in theory, if we do get anything\nback, we'll see we may or we may not.\n\n379\n00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.960\nI believe I clicked, I thought I clicked.\n\n380\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.800\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n381\n00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.800\nCuz we know that the console is just so\nresponsive.\n\n382\n00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n383\n00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.020\nnormally we will start\nto get back some data.\n\n384\n00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.970\nIt may take a little bit.\n\n385\n00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.380\nAs I said, we're probably not gonna\nactually be able to demo that piece for\n\n386\n00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.180\nyou live because it's going to take\nlittle while to compile that data.\n\n387\n00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.580\nThough we can go in, we obviously cannot\nbegin to see some of that showing up.\n\n388\n00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.160\nAnd so the idea behind creating those\nconfiguration baselines is the ability for\n\n389\n00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.540\nus to be able to set them up and\ndeploy them.\n\n390\n00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.930\nLet's just take a loot\nat one other thing here.\n\n391\n00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:24.850\nWhile we are talking, I'm just going here,\n\n392\n00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:29.530\nover here, real quick,\nbring up our client settings, all right?\n\n393\n00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.800\nAnd let's go over here\nto compliance settings.\n\n394\n00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.820\nAnd just show you that\non the SCCM client agent\n\n395\n00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.560\nwe do have compliance settings\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n396\n00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.230\nNow it is turned on by\ndefault that we will enable\n\n397\n00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.320\na compliance evaluation on clients.\n\n398\n00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.070\nRemember our magic number,\nevery 7 days, right?\n\n399\n00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.900\nAnd so we are gonna automatically be set\nup, without having to modify anything,\n\n400\n00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.470\nto do compliance scanning.\n\n401\n00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.660\nAssuming there's a baseline that we apply.\n\n402\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.040\nBut remember we would have to\nmake sure that agent is deployed.\n\n403\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.050\nIn our demo environment I don't have\nany agent deployed on the machine, so\n\n404\n00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.338\nI'm not gonna actually get\nthe data back right now.\n\n405\n00:22:05.338 --> 00:22:08.860\nBut the idea's that I would be\nable to do that and in production,\n\n406\n00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:14.000\nonce I deploy that baseline to\nthe collection within a certain\n\n407\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.630\ncycle depending how often we have set that\nupdate, cuz by default it's seven days.\n\n408\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.290\nWe may wanna actually go in and\ndo that a little more aggressively.\n\n409\n00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.110\nWe'll actually get information,\nwe'll scan.\n\n410\n00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.960\nWe'll upload that back into\nthe Configuration Manager database and\n\n411\n00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.970\nthen we can run reports against that and\nfind out what level of compliance we have.\n\n412\n00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.880\n>> Nice.\n>> So that's gonna help us with that.\n\n413\n00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.900\n>> All right, very good.\n\n414\n00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.110\n>> So let's go ahead and let's,\nif we could, go to Mike's machine\n\n415\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.400\ncuz he's got just a couple of things\nup that we wanna take a look at.\n\n416\n00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.140\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\n\n417\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.500\njust kinda summarize what\nwe were doing just now.\n\n418\n00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.090\nAnd make sure that we can first of all,\ncan we go to the graphic first of all?\n\n419\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.220\n>> Sure.\n>> Just take a look at that.\n\n420\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.410\nSo I just wanna talk about kinda\nthe process that we just went through\n\n421\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.560\nwith getting this deployed and\nsetting it up.\n\n422\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.380\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\nwe'll just summarize some of the steps and\n\n423\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.950\nthe things that we wanna be aware of\nthat are gonna be equally important.\n\n424\n00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:09.150\nSo what you see on the screen there is,\nwe may wanna zoom in just a touch.\n\n425\n00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.540\nCuz that way I can read the numbers, cuz\nI see the boxes I can't see the numbers.\n\n426\n00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.000\nAll right, so up at the top there where we\nhave our configuration management pack,\n\n427\n00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.500\nyou saw me bring that in and import that.\n\n428\n00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.900\nWe have configuration items that are\neither going to be imported or created.\n\n429\n00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.290\nWe did both by the way.\n\n430\n00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.590\nWe brought those in and\n\n431\n00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:29.700\nwe see those wind up off to the right in\nMike's big wheel of cheese over there.\n\n432\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.460\nWhich looks like one of those big 50\npound wheels of cheese you see on like\n\n433\n00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.560\nthe food channel.\n\n434\n00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.840\n>> I was hungry when I drew this up.\n\n435\n00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.460\n>> Apparently, but I notice there's\nno wedge taken out of that,\n\n436\n00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.636\nso it wasn't virtual cheese.\n\n437\n00:23:40.636 --> 00:23:43.620\nSo we can see configuration\nmanager database which is where\n\n438\n00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.310\nall of those CIs that we've created\nconfiguration items are going to wind up.\n\n439\n00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.670\nSo we're gonna see those.\n\n440\n00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.830\nWe are then gonna create\na configuration baseline in step two,\n\n441\n00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.390\neither import that or create that.\n\n442\n00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.587\nWe did both as well.\n\n443\n00:23:54.587 --> 00:23:56.917\nOr actually we only imported,\nI didn't bother to create a baseline, but\n\n444\n00:23:56.917 --> 00:23:57.754\nyou see the general idea.\n\n445\n00:23:57.754 --> 00:23:59.337\nIt would basically be the same thing.\n\n446\n00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:00.421\nSo we've done that.\n\n447\n00:24:00.421 --> 00:24:03.346\nThen, I believe down on\nthe bottom on the right there,\n\n448\n00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:06.220\nwe have the configuration\nbaseline being deployed.\n\n449\n00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.100\nSo we got some servers there,\nthat we're deploying it against for\n\n450\n00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.020\nwhatever collection we\nwanna put them into.\n\n451\n00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.710\nYou saw me do that.\n\n452\n00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.670\nThen in step four,\n\n453\n00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:17.100\nthat baseline is gonna be downloaded\nwith policy out to the clients.\n\n454\n00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.920\nWe're gonna evaluate that,\nrun on a scheduled seven days by default.\n\n455\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.140\nWe just took a look at that on\nthe manage client settings.\n\n456\n00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.710\nThen we are going to go over and\ndo compliance information being sent up\n\n457\n00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:33.250\ninto the compliance data base or rather up\nto the configuration manager data base.\n\n458\n00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.630\nWe would actually see a little line.\n\n459\n00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.045\n>> Mike doesn't have on the diagram and\nthat's fine, it's no big deal.\n\n460\n00:24:38.045 --> 00:24:41.015\nBut we would see a line coming\noff that block of three machines,\n\n461\n00:24:41.015 --> 00:24:44.375\ngoing up into the database\nto upload the data.\n\n462\n00:24:44.375 --> 00:24:47.315\nAnd then coming back down, because we\nwould be applying the configuration\n\n463\n00:24:47.315 --> 00:24:49.895\nbaseline initially as\npart of that as well.\n\n464\n00:24:49.895 --> 00:24:54.305\nAnd then off to the right there, or excuse\nme, off to the left, except if you're\n\n465\n00:24:54.305 --> 00:24:56.895\nstanding the opposite way, in which\ncase it would be off to the right.\n\n466\n00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:59.960\n>> But off to the left\n>> Is gonna be compliance reports that\n\n467\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.020\nare going to be run, or\nat least looked at, so\n\n468\n00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.950\nthat we can get an update on\nwhat the compliance status is.\n\n469\n00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:10.260\nSo this is the general thought process\nbehind how compliance settings are going\n\n470\n00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.947\nto be implemented, created, and\nultimately used and managed.\n\n471\n00:25:12.947 --> 00:25:13.520\n>> Sounds good.\n>> And\n\n472\n00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.020\nthis is actually one of those\nunderappreciated areas of SCCM,\n\n473\n00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.090\nit's a relatively newer feature set.\n\n474\n00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.240\nThis is something that was lacking for\na piece of time or\n\n475\n00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.560\na bit of time with the product.\n\n476\n00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.880\nWe've really done a lot to build\nthis up and incorporate it, and\n\n477\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.050\nthis is really valuable functionality\nbecause now we can really begin to\n\n478\n00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.860\nbring in what are known as GRC activities.\n\n479\n00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.390\nGovernance, risk, and\ncompliance activities.\n\n480\n00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:42.860\nFrom the broader security ecosystem\nwithin the enterprise, and apply\n\n481\n00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.470\nthe best practices and security thought\nprocesses we need to be able to use both,\n\n482\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.130\nthat we have internally, but also that\nvendors may create for us as we saw.\n\n483\n00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.280\nBecause we brought in that configuration\n\n484\n00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.610\nbaseline in the CI management pack from\nMicrosoft for configuration manager.\n\n485\n00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.950\nAnd we use their best practices to scan,\n\n486\n00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.140\nand we would then be able to check\nthe configuration based on how\n\n487\n00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.140\nthey say it should be done, which\nwould obviously very important for us.\n\n488\n00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.620\nSo, wanna be thinking about that,\nwanna be aware of that.\n\n489\n00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.721\nBut this is gonna be\nsome pretty good stuff.\n\n490\n00:26:12.721 --> 00:26:16.038\nAnd stuff that hopefully, for you out\nthere, you're gonna not only wanna use\n\n491\n00:26:16.038 --> 00:26:19.050\nthe functionality too, hopefully you're\nbetter men in your organization.\n\n492\n00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.370\nBut you're gonna become familiar with\nit because, as with many things,\n\n493\n00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.230\nthis may be something that you're asked\nabout if you ever take an exam, so\n\n494\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.430\nwe do just wanna be comfortable with that.\n\n495\n00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.570\nNow remediation is available for\nthe following, I showed you this.\n\n496\n00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:35.810\nWe have registry values, scripts,\nWQL Query config items, mobile platforms.\n\n497\n00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.050\nSo we have a whole bunch of\ndifferent areas that we can go into.\n\n498\n00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:42.180\nWe saw Active Directory, queries.\n\n499\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.500\nWe saw SQL queries as values, so\n\n500\n00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:49.460\nwe could use on the overall thought\nprocess for setting up the rules, but\n\n501\n00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:55.410\nof that huge superset, only those four\nitems can actually be remediated again.\n\n502\n00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.810\nSo we had more items.\n\n503\n00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.900\nWe had X query, but\na bunch of different stuff on there, but\n\n504\n00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.790\nof all the things that were there,\nonly those four items, reg values,\n\n505\n00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.900\nnot reg keys, but reg values,\nscripts, WQL queries.\n\n506\n00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:12.120\nSo specifically WQL and\nmobile phone settings can be remediated.\n\n507\n00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.230\nSo we have a subset for\n\n508\n00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.720\nremediation of the larger superset\nof all the things we could scan for.\n\n509\n00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.960\nRemediation can be in the following forms.\n\n510\n00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.910\nCreate the value if it doesn't exist.\n\n511\n00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.060\nSet the value if it exists but\nit's not compliant.\n\n512\n00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.840\nRun some sort of remediation script\nand/or set the value for phone settings,\n\n513\n00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.290\nif supported on the mobile site,\nwhich is obviously also very good.\n\n514\n00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.350\nWe have to set up, and think about\nhow we would drive remediation.\n\n515\n00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.730\nThat is something to consider,\njust think about.\n\n516\n00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.660\nAnd then we have a listing of all of the\ndifferent compliance setting logs that may\n\n517\n00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:41.440\nbe valuable for you,\n\n518\n00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.810\nbecause no good episode will be\ncomplete without at least five logs.\n\n519\n00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.010\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> At a minimum,\nif not more.\n\n520\n00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:52.275\nSo we actually have, I think, seven logs\nif I'm not mistaken here on this one.\n\n521\n00:27:52.275 --> 00:27:54.490\n>> Yep.\nSo you can see them all listed there.\n\n522\n00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.650\nYou can see what they do.\n\n523\n00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.388\nWe kind of have the device or, excuse me,\nthe definition of them off to the right.\n\n524\n00:27:59.388 --> 00:28:02.710\nSo we'll leave that up to you to kind\nof ponder there quietly for a moment,\n\n525\n00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.750\njust to see what we have going on.\n\n526\n00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.280\nOkay.\n\n527\n00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.476\n>> Very good.\nAdam again another fantastic episode\n\n528\n00:28:07.476 --> 00:28:11.046\nyou know, taking a look at it, how we\ncan manage compliance of settings and\n\n529\n00:28:11.046 --> 00:28:14.180\npolicies using our system\nconfiguration manager 2012 R2.\n\n530\n00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.160\nThank you for that.\n\n531\n00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.050\nHope everybody out there enjoyed this one.\n\n532\n00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.340\nRemember, if you wanna sit in\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n533\n00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.460\nshoot as an email here\nat seeadam@itpro.tv.\n\n534\n00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.820\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n535\n00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.210\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n536\n00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.865\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n537\n00:28:33.865 --> 00:28:35.350\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.120\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.650\nToday we're doing our system center\nconfiguration manager 2012 R2.\n\n5\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.570\nAnd specifically in this one we're\ngonna be looking at boundaries and\n\n6\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.520\nboundary groups.\n\n7\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.610\nAnd here to help us with that is\nthe one and only Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.460\nHow's is going, Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.480\n>> Good, good.\nI'm feeling very fenced in this\n\n10\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.475\nmorning for some reason.\n\n11\n00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:37.181\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's see if we can clarify why that is\n\n12\n00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:38.260\nthe case as we go.\n\n13\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.690\nSo we're gonna talk about boundary\ngroups as Mike was alluding too.\n\n14\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.570\nThe idea with boundary groups,\nwe mentioned them in a prior episode as we\n\n15\n00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.290\ntalked about how to set\nup a secondary site and\n\n16\n00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.730\nwhy boundary groups are important and\nwhat they are.\n\n17\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.110\nWe also need to be aware of them as\nwe set up our primary sites, but\n\n18\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.010\nthe reality is as we set up our primary\nsite, we don't really have a sense with\n\n19\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.260\nthat boundary is gonna be yet, because we\nhave to first install the primary site,\n\n20\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.190\nand then start figuring out\nwhat our boundary is gonna be.\n\n21\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.900\nAnd then link that and set it up in our\nhierarchy, if we're gonna indeed install\n\n22\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.330\na hierarchy for our secondary sites,\nand leverage that for discovery.\n\n23\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.180\nSo we're gonna back track a little bit,\ntalk through that logic.\n\n24\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.510\nWe're also demo that for you,\nset up a boundary group or a boundary.\n\n25\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.547\nAnd then a boundary group and\nlink it to the boundary group.\n\n26\n00:01:16.547 --> 00:01:20.580\nBut you saw me in the demonstration,\nwe did a setting up the secondary site.\n\n27\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.500\nSpecify what a boundary group was,\n\n28\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.690\nthe lab boundary group we used\nto set the secondary site up.\n\n29\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.150\nThat boundary group is\nthe administrative container in effect\n\n30\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.628\nthat lets us bring our boundaries in and\nassign them and manage them.\n\n31\n00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:36.306\nSo we're gonna talk about what that\nlooks like, why that's the case, and\n\n32\n00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:37.379\nhow all that comes together.\n\n33\n00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:40.693\nMikes actually gonna help me\ndo that because Mikes been\n\n34\n00:01:40.693 --> 00:01:44.379\nkind enough to volunteer to\nexplain using only his fingers.\n\n35\n00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:45.667\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What a boundary and\n\n36\n00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:47.254\na boundary group are, okay, go.\n\n37\n00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:48.212\n>> Here we go.\n>> Okay.\n\n38\n00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:50.285\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you see the graphics,\n\n39\n00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:53.815\nremember Mike's in charge of all graphics,\ngood, bad, or indifferent.\n\n40\n00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:55.212\nIt's Mr. Mike who's on the graphics.\n\n41\n00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:58.100\nSo great job of the finger usage there for\nthe boundaries.\n\n42\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.870\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n43\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.590\n>> I never could have done that, I just\nstart this and I, it get's confusing.\n\n44\n00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.580\n>> It takes a lot of practice.\n\n45\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.132\n>> Doesn't work, it does,\nit takes a lot of practice.\n\n46\n00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:09.750\nAll right, so let's start by talking\nnot boundaries and boundary groups, but\n\n47\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.690\nactually client assignment cuz the first\nthing we have to understand with\n\n48\n00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.950\nregards to boundaries and boundary groups\nis actually how we assign a client and\n\n49\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.200\nwhat the process of client assignment\nis with regards to taking an endpoint.\n\n50\n00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.490\nA client is a managed endpoint,\ntaking an endpoint and\n\n51\n00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.270\nfiguring out where we actually want to\nhave that endpoint be homed or assigned.\n\n52\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.210\nAnd Mike and I were talking about\nthis right before we got started for\n\n53\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.210\nthis episode.\n\n54\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.060\nHey, what is that whole\nclient assignment thing?\n\n55\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.140\nYou were telling me, right?\n\n56\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.340\nThat we can assign a client,\ndoes that mean we assign it to one site?\n\n57\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.960\nCan we assign it to more than one site?\n\n58\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.490\nWhat site do we assign it to?\n\n59\n00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.430\nThese are all very important questions\nthat we have to really understand and\n\n60\n00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.948\nultimately have straight in our\nhead as we get started with this.\n\n61\n00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:51.400\nSo I wanna spend just a minute kind of\nclarifying for us before we get in and\n\n62\n00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.530\nreally start looking at how to do this.\n\n63\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.880\nClient assignment implies that we're gonna\ntake an unmanaged endpoint, desktop,\n\n64\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.860\na server, whatever that specific\nWindows infrastructure may be,\n\n65\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.610\nand we're gonna then assign.\n\n66\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.940\nEffectively, associate is assigning,\nassociate or\n\n67\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.300\nassign that endpoint to a site\nby specifying the site code.\n\n68\n00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.600\nThe primary server site code\nis what we're gonna be doing.\n\n69\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.120\nDid you hear a go-cart?\n\n70\n00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.426\nI thought I heard a go-cart.\n\n71\n00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:21.171\n>> I think so.\n>> [CROSSTALK] that I have going on.\n\n72\n00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:23.004\nCode for why are we doing this, right?\n\n73\n00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:24.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, we just hear a noise going on\n\n74\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.405\nsometimes and we talk about it as if it\nwas a go-cart just to keep you guys on\n\n75\n00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:29.755\nyour toes and confuse you.\n\n76\n00:03:29.755 --> 00:03:30.420\n>> That's right.\n\n77\n00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.200\n>> So when we're thinking\nabout client assignments\n\n78\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.320\nwe're thinking about the ability to be\nable to take an unmanaged endpoint and\n\n79\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.150\neffectively associate\nit with a primary site.\n\n80\n00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.090\nRemember the site code is the primary\nsite code that we are associating with.\n\n81\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.860\nI was also mentioning to\nMike as we got started that\n\n82\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.850\ncentral admin sites don't\nhave their own site codes.\n\n83\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.330\nRemember, they do not manage\nin a multi-set hierarchy\n\n84\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.282\nthe clients themselves.\n\n85\n00:03:50.282 --> 00:03:52.180\nThey are responsible for\nadministration and\n\n86\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.650\nreporting, all up view in other\nwords of data in the hierarchy.\n\n87\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.540\nPrimary sites are where site codes\nare created where we associate and\n\n88\n00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.750\nmanage clients through\nclient assignment and\n\n89\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.020\nsecondary sites are child\nobjects of the primary.\n\n90\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.590\nJust like the primary site is indeed\na child object of a central admin site but\n\n91\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.530\nthe secondary site associators who saw\nthe demonstration in the prior episode\n\n92\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.050\nwith a primary site.\n\n93\n00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.140\nWe specified the primary site server\nsite code to create the assignment but\n\n94\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.450\nwe did give the secondary site, if you\nremember, it's own site code, right?\n\n95\n00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.500\nBut remember that secondary sites are not\ncapable of managing clients directly,\n\n96\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.650\nbut rather are gonna manage those\nclients on behalf of the primary site.\n\n97\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.080\nEffectively they're gonna\ngroup them together,\n\n98\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.170\nthey're gonna be responsible for them.\n\n99\n00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.210\nAnd then we're going to be able to push\ndown a package to the distribution point\n\n100\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.790\nor whatever from the primary\nsite distributed out or\n\n101\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.360\nput in that secondary site down there.\n\n102\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.460\nPrimarily, it's a bandwidth management\nsolution to offset lack of bandwidth or\n\n103\n00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.480\nlack of ability to bring multiple\nclients across the divide and\n\n104\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.900\nhave them managed directly.\n\n105\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.260\nSo we're just gonna be\nthinking about that and\n\n106\n00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.170\nwe're gonna assign those\nclients to our primary site.\n\n107\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.350\nSo we're going to go ahead and we are\ngoing to, in the process of assignment,\n\n108\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.350\nspecify as we deploy the agent,\n\n109\n00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.610\nthe client agent, on what the site\ncode is we want to associate with.\n\n110\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.430\nThat site code will be the site\ncode of the primary site.\n\n111\n00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.340\nNow Mike also referenced and\nasked me in our conversation prior, hey,\n\n112\n00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.505\ncan we have more than one primary site?\n\n113\n00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.650\nAnd if so is a sign and\neffectively saying,\n\n114\n00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.921\nwhich primary sites you\nwanna be a member of?\n\n115\n00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:21.130\nAnd I said that's absolutely correct,\nbecause that's exactly what it is.\n\n116\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.878\nIt's a question of which primary\nsite we wanna associate with.\n\n117\n00:05:23.878 --> 00:05:27.870\nIn a multi-site hierarchy,\nit's a question of which primary site\n\n118\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.400\nthe client will be assigned to and\nthat's the site code we specify.\n\n119\n00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.535\nWe can't specify multiple site codes,\nand a client cannot be a member or\n\n120\n00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:39.300\nbe associated with,\nmore than one primary site at a time.\n\n121\n00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.180\nBut as I mentioned to Mike,\nyou can reassign a client.\n\n122\n00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.046\nSo we can say hey,\nyou're gonna be a member of A01, right?\n\n123\n00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:48.129\nAdam site primary site 01.\n\n124\n00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.462\nBut then I wanna move you to\nMike primary site, Mike 01.\n\n125\n00:05:51.462 --> 00:05:56.886\nSo I can actually reassign the client\nform A01 to M01 simply buy reassigning or\n\n126\n00:05:56.886 --> 00:05:59.820\nchanging the site code on the client.\n\n127\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.840\nNow, here's something interesting.\n\n128\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.915\nAs if everything I've said up\nto now is not interesting.\n\n129\n00:06:03.915 --> 00:06:05.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So here's something relevant\n\n130\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.010\nand interesting.\n\n131\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.220\nSo we can assign and\nchange site codes, obviously.\n\n132\n00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.730\nThere's several ways to do this.\n\n133\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.050\nWe can manually put in the site code,\nso we can do that by programming it in.\n\n134\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.620\nCan we do that through PowerShell?\n\n135\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.050\n>> Of course.\n>> Of course we can,\n\n136\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.590\ncuz we have more than 12 commandments so\n\n137\n00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.710\nas a result we definitely\nhave the option to do that.\n\n138\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.760\n>> 470.\n>> 470 is bigger than 12, right?\n\n139\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.742\n>> So we can do that we'll\n\n141\n00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:27.640\ngo through PowerShell, we can do it\nmanually, we can actually script it and\n\n142\n00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.490\ndo it through a log-on script or through\ngroup policy, There's a lot of different\n\n143\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.560\nways to do that.\nWe'll be talking about client assignment\n\n144\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.130\nand how it can actually get that up and\nrunning in one of our future discussions,\n\n145\n00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.290\nbut the reality is we have\nmultiple options here.\n\n146\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.780\nSo, we just want to keep that in mind,\n\n147\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.634\nbe aware of that.\nWe also will, as I said, have the ability\n\n148\n00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:45.895\nto be able to go in and to auto decide.\nI didn't actually say this but\n\n149\n00:06:45.895 --> 00:06:47.765\nI should have.\nWe can also auto discover the site\n\n150\n00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:51.135\nassignment, using the active directory\nintegration for our site code.\n\n151\n00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:52.595\nSo we can actually do that as well.\n\n152\n00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:54.045\nThat's where boundaries come in because\n\n153\n00:06:54.045 --> 00:06:57.955\none of the key things we're gonna do with\nboundaries is set up a subnet association,\n\n154\n00:06:57.955 --> 00:07:01.790\nor an IP range association.\nAnd by doing that, leveraging our active\n\n155\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.340\ndirectory site topology, which is what\nwe're gonna talk about and do and\n\n156\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.450\nusing a discovery method known as\nthe active directory farce discovery\n\n157\n00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.080\nmethod to effectively pull in those\nIP ranges and site boundaries.\n\n158\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.690\nAs a result of that, any client that is\nin an IP range associated with the site\n\n159\n00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.390\nis automatically gonna be associated\nwith that site based on association\n\n160\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.900\nof that site boundary with that\nprimary site and so as a result.\n\n161\n00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.500\nWe effectively now have an automated\nprocess to discover site codes, and\n\n162\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.090\nthat's normally how we do it by the way.\n\n163\n00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.070\nWe normally simply automate the process\nand have a client come up, and\n\n164\n00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.870\nbased on IP address and\nboundary association,\n\n165\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.640\nhave that client auto discover its\nsite code assuming DNS is working and\n\n166\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.980\nobviously all the bells and\nwhistles we associate with LDAP and\n\n167\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.180\nall the things we need for\ndirectory services are there.\n\n168\n00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.504\nAssuming that all works, the theory\ncomes up and it should work just fine.\n\n169\n00:07:47.504 --> 00:07:49.746\nBut we also have the option of\nmanually overriding that and\n\n170\n00:07:49.746 --> 00:07:51.587\nassigning site codes on\nour own if we choose to.\n\n171\n00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:55.431\nWe did talk about client reassignment\nas well We can move clients back and\n\n172\n00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:57.837\nforth if necessary so\njust keep that in mind.\n\n173\n00:07:57.837 --> 00:08:01.110\nNow we do a site compatibility check\nwhen we do client site assignments.\n\n174\n00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.580\nWe actually check whether or not the site\nthat we are signing the client to\n\n175\n00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.520\nis capable of running that\nclient based on versioning.\n\n176\n00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.780\nSo its important to know that\nif you have a 2007 client,\n\n177\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.500\nan older client like say that's coming up\ninto 2012 R2 site that's not gonna work,\n\n178\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.920\ncuz we don't support 2007 clients in 2012.\n\n179\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.920\nSo we do compatibility checks\nto make sure that the client and\n\n180\n00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.890\nthe site are at the right version\nlevel and will work together.\n\n181\n00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:29.055\nWe're also gonna make sure that the\nConfiguration Manager can check back and\n\n182\n00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:31.835\nsee what's going on in AD to\ndo automatic site assignments.\n\n183\n00:08:31.835 --> 00:08:34.345\nIt's gonna be part of the compatibility\ncheck that we do as well.\n\n184\n00:08:34.345 --> 00:08:38.165\nIf we have Internet-based management of\nclients, cuz we can manage clients locally\n\n185\n00:08:38.165 --> 00:08:41.633\ninside the LAN, so\nmanage them through the cloud using 12 R2.\n\n186\n00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:45.955\nIf they're Internet-based,\nwe do no client compatibility check for\n\n187\n00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:49.165\nsite assignment,\nmanually we have to specify everything.\n\n188\n00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:53.330\nSo it's important for you to know from an\nexam perspective, as well as in the real\n\n189\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.530\nworld, that if you're setting up Internet\nbased client management, everything must\n\n190\n00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.470\nbe configured manually, the site\nassignment, the site code, all that.\n\n191\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.957\nWe don't do any compatibility checks,\nwe don't auto-discover.\n\n192\n00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:06.146\nBut if we are on the LAN locally within\nthe network and active directories\n\n193\n00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:09.701\navailable and all that's working, we\nactually do the compatibility checks and\n\n194\n00:09:09.701 --> 00:09:11.593\nauto discover and auto assign the client.\n\n195\n00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.200\nSo there's a little bit of a difference\nthere depending on how we want to\n\n196\n00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.305\napproach that.\n\n197\n00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.945\nWanna give you just a standing kind of\nworking condition of what a boundary\n\n198\n00:09:17.945 --> 00:09:20.437\nis before we go in and\nactually start playing around with one.\n\n199\n00:09:20.437 --> 00:09:24.097\nThe formal definition of a boundary\nis that it is a demarkation point.\n\n200\n00:09:24.097 --> 00:09:25.877\nIt's effectively a marker.\n\n201\n00:09:25.877 --> 00:09:28.957\nIt's some sort of an indicator\nof things being on one side,\n\n202\n00:09:28.957 --> 00:09:32.307\nbeing a member of a group, things being\non the other side being excluded or\n\n203\n00:09:32.307 --> 00:09:34.327\nnot being a member of the group\nthat we are creating.\n\n204\n00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:37.867\nSo the boundaries really nothing more than\nthis line that we create or the circle.\n\n205\n00:09:37.867 --> 00:09:39.317\nYou wanna do the graphic for\nme again there?\n\n206\n00:09:39.317 --> 00:09:39.897\n>> [CROSSTALK] Do that one more time?\n\n207\n00:09:39.897 --> 00:09:40.919\n>> Yeah, can you do that for me?\n\n208\n00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:42.160\nI'm not good at that.\n\n209\n00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.035\nThank you very much.\n\n210\n00:09:43.035 --> 00:09:44.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You have to be a professional to be\n\n211\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.810\nable to carry that off and do it well.\n\n212\n00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.360\nDid you catch the facial expression\nwhile Mike was doing that?\n\n213\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.470\nHe was so focused, so\njust like he was in the zone.\n\n214\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.950\n>> You gotta make sure that you get to\nthe bottom at the same time with both-\n\n215\n00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:54.655\n>> He was in the boundary.\n\n216\n00:09:54.655 --> 00:09:55.932\nI would say the zone, but\nhe was in the boundary exactly.\n\n217\n00:09:55.932 --> 00:09:58.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's exactly where he was.\n\n218\n00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.159\nSo the boundary, right?\n\n219\n00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:01.690\nHey look, you gotta,\nyou gotta, just you know.\n\n220\n00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.290\n>> We gotta liven it up.\n\n221\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.360\n>> And if you don't joke around then\njust it's dry and boring, so you gotta,\n\n222\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.890\nyou gotta make it a little lively.\n\n223\n00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.570\nSo the boundary is really just\nthis demarcation point for us.\n\n224\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.200\nEverything inside the circle or\ninside the boundary is part of\n\n225\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.230\nthe group that we are managing, or\npart of the group we're gonna associate.\n\n226\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.950\nAnything outside of it may be a member of\nanother group inside another boundary, but\n\n227\n00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.430\nthey're not a member of our\ngroup inside this boundary.\n\n228\n00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.040\nAnd that's something we\nwanna differentiate and\n\n229\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.570\nreally make sure we understand as well.\n\n230\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.840\nJust because you're not a member\nof this particular boundary group,\n\n231\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.970\ndoesn't mean that you're not\na member of another boundary group.\n\n232\n00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.890\nIt just means you're not part of our\nboundary group that we're talking about,\n\n233\n00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.290\nboundary group A, let's say.\n\n234\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.240\nBut you may be member of\nboundary groups B, C or\n\n235\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.570\nD, it's just that you're going to be,\nhey look, I only have a half an arm.\n\n236\n00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.430\nBut what happens is that when that occurs\nyou're simply outside our boundary.\n\n237\n00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.650\nAnd we can only operate with and interact\nwith one boundary group at a time.\n\n238\n00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.800\nBecause we're associating and\n\n239\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.945\ncreating those boundaries and\nputting them into boundary groups.\n\n240\n00:10:49.945 --> 00:10:52.730\nSo once we do that, we then can\nobviously use them and assign them.\n\n241\n00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.120\nSo let's go ahead and let's take\na look at how all this is gonna work.\n\n242\n00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.630\nWe're gonna shift over to our demo\nmachine and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n243\n00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.016\nwe're gonna take look for you and kinda\nwalk you through this process all right?\n\n244\n00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.550\nSo let's, I'm gonna just scroll down here,\nso we can get this all set up.\n\n245\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.570\nAnd let me use the magical ellipsis\nbutton to reset our lab time there.\n\n246\n00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.910\nIt's great when you\nunderstand how things work.\n\n247\n00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:13.491\n>> Right.\n\n248\n00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:14.434\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's so\n\n249\n00:11:14.434 --> 00:11:15.533\nmuch smoother when you know\nwhat the rules are of the game.\n\n250\n00:11:15.533 --> 00:11:17.070\nAll right, so what we have here.\n\n251\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.030\nLet me just zoom in so\nyou can see where we are.\n\n252\n00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.850\nWe are in our Administration workspace,\nas you can see.\n\n253\n00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.063\nPretty common we've been spending a lot of\ntime in there recently getting everything\n\n254\n00:11:26.063 --> 00:11:29.052\nset up, and by the way this is not unusual\nin the real world as you're starting to\n\n255\n00:11:29.052 --> 00:11:30.407\nmanage and work with this product.\n\n256\n00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:32.877\nA lot of this set up work we're\ndoing is done one time and\n\n257\n00:11:32.877 --> 00:11:36.226\nthen you kind of forget about it unless\nyou have a reason to change things.\n\n258\n00:11:36.226 --> 00:11:39.228\nSo it's common you'll be in there\na lot in the beginning, but\n\n259\n00:11:39.228 --> 00:11:43.387\nas I've indicated a couple of times in\nsome comments I've made, it's very normal,\n\n260\n00:11:43.387 --> 00:11:46.446\nindeed it's more normal than not,\nthat a lot of this is done for\n\n261\n00:11:46.446 --> 00:11:50.494\nyou because you've probably already got\ninfrastructure already up and running or\n\n262\n00:11:50.494 --> 00:11:53.555\nsomebody may have come in and\nis helping you to get this set up.\n\n263\n00:11:53.555 --> 00:11:57.342\nSo the reality is that you may not\nactually be the person that's going in and\n\n264\n00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:01.190\ndoing all this, and you may not actually\nhave a reason to be in here doing a lot\n\n265\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.923\nthe administrative back\nend work that we're doing.\n\n266\n00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:07.996\nYou just may be in there you know plugging\naway everyday, setting up collections,\n\n267\n00:12:07.996 --> 00:12:10.218\ndealing with query's deploying packages.\n\n268\n00:12:10.218 --> 00:12:14.598\nWhen we talk to ITM, it's they'r\nusing SCC and they're using it daily.\n\n269\n00:12:14.598 --> 00:12:16.309\nAnd we say, hey,\nwhat are your most common activities?\n\n270\n00:12:16.309 --> 00:12:17.772\nWhat do you do?\n\n271\n00:12:17.772 --> 00:12:21.050\nThe majority of activity is not taking\nplace in the Administrative area.\n\n272\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.700\nThe majority of the activity is taking\nplace in the other workspaces so.\n\n273\n00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.902\nYou just wanna be aware of that, but for\n\n274\n00:12:25.902 --> 00:12:27.750\nnow we're obviously gonna\nspend a little time here.\n\n275\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.590\nSo we're in the Boundaries area\nunder Hierarchy Configuration.\n\n276\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.628\nYou can see it highlighted on the left\nunder Discovery Methods, and off to\n\n277\n00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:36.816\nthe right here, we already have a boundary\nthat's been set up as you can see.\n\n278\n00:12:36.816 --> 00:12:40.059\nSee we have a boundary\nthat is a IP subnet range,\n\n279\n00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:45.752\n192.168.0.1 through 192.168.0.5,\nso small boundary.\n\n280\n00:12:45.752 --> 00:12:48.436\nIt's an IP address range boundary\nof different boundary types.\n\n281\n00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:53.200\nWe could do IP subnet, do IP address\nrange, we could do Active Directory sites,\n\n282\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.613\nand/or IPv6 prefix.\n\n283\n00:12:54.613 --> 00:12:56.596\nSo we have four different ways.\n\n284\n00:12:56.596 --> 00:12:58.923\nFour different options for\nsetting up boundaries.\n\n285\n00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:02.141\nAnd would be important for you,\nif you are preparing for the exam,\n\n286\n00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:04.511\nto know what the four\nboundary type options are.\n\n287\n00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:08.548\nSo let's just quickly rattle those off\none more time, no particular order,\n\n288\n00:13:08.548 --> 00:13:09.801\nno priority in any way.\n\n289\n00:13:09.801 --> 00:13:14.801\nWe have IP subnet, active directory site,\nIPv6 prefix, and/or,\n\n290\n00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:18.967\nas you see in the screen in front of you,\nIP address range.\n\n291\n00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:21.466\nAnd I'm gonna show you that when we set\nup the boundaries in just a minute and\n\n292\n00:13:21.466 --> 00:13:22.665\nwe'll see what those options are.\n\n293\n00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:24.715\nWe have a group count there so\nwe have one group.\n\n294\n00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:26.365\nAnd we have a creation date which,\n\n295\n00:13:26.365 --> 00:13:29.095\nour way of thinking really\ndoesn't matter all that much.\n\n296\n00:13:29.095 --> 00:13:32.089\nSo when we want to create a new boundary,\nwe're gonna go to the boundary area.\n\n297\n00:13:32.089 --> 00:13:33.504\nWe can right click.\n\n298\n00:13:33.504 --> 00:13:34.248\n>> Sometimes.\n\n299\n00:13:34.248 --> 00:13:35.190\n>> Sometimes.\n\n300\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.640\nWe create a new boundary.\n\n301\n00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.350\nWe can do this through PowerShell,\nof course.\n\n302\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.180\nWe can also go up to the ribbon\nup top on the left there and\n\n303\n00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.830\nuse the Create Boundary icon.\n\n304\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.760\nSo I'm just gonna click Create New\nBoundary or Create Boundary rather.\n\n305\n00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.220\nWe're gonna open up our\nCreate Boundary wizard here.\n\n306\n00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.310\nWait a second for that to pop up.\n\n307\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.750\nIt's actually fairly straightforward.\n\n308\n00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.700\nAnd you'll see as we zoom in that we\nhave and actually what I should do,\n\n309\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.600\nhold on one second, we zoom back out and\nlet me do that, and\n\n310\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.430\nzoom in that way you guys can\nactually see the options there.\n\n311\n00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.530\nYou'll see the four options I just\ndiscussed in the pick list and under Type.\n\n312\n00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.586\nWe have to provide a description,\nprovide a type.\n\n313\n00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:12.023\nWe have to provide since we've\nchosen an IP subnet, a subnet mask.\n\n314\n00:14:12.023 --> 00:14:15.345\nIf I choose Active Directory site,\nI'll have to provide a site boundary.\n\n315\n00:14:15.345 --> 00:14:17.900\nThere's different options,\nthe wizard changes the configuration.\n\n316\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.760\nIn other words, based on that.\n\n317\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.560\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we are going\nto choose to create a boundary.\n\n318\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.910\nBut we're gonna do this based\non the Active Directory site,\n\n319\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.680\nso we're gonna choose\nActive Directory site.\n\n320\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.490\nAnd when we do that,\nwe are going to go in.\n\n321\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.204\nYou'll just zoom in here\nreal quick to show you.\n\n322\n00:14:36.204 --> 00:14:37.537\nYou'll see that that changeed, and\n\n323\n00:14:37.537 --> 00:14:39.648\nnow we'll have to provide\nan active directory site name.\n\n324\n00:14:39.648 --> 00:14:42.326\nSo the descriptor\ninformation we choose under\n\n325\n00:14:42.326 --> 00:14:47.340\ntype will then change the appropriate or\nmake the selection options change for us.\n\n326\n00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.430\nSo under after directory site name, what\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n327\n00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.600\nwe're gonna browse.\n\n328\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.200\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\ngonna choose, as soon as it comes up.\n\n329\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:57.980\nWe just have to wait for it to go out and\n\n330\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.150\neffectively connect to\nthe active directory.\n\n331\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.770\nLook at the site typology, get the\ninformation for the existing replication\n\n332\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.380\nsite typology back, so we can then\npopulate that list, so takes a minute.\n\n333\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.780\nAnd what we'll see there is, let me\njust extend that out so you can see it.\n\n334\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.480\nWe get our default first site name and\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n335\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.790\nAnd I'm actually gonna switch\nmachines here for just a second.\n\n336\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.500\nGonna show you where that comes from.\n\n337\n00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.600\nSo I'm gonna go to the domain controller,\nand\n\n338\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.630\nI'm gonna go over to tools up here in the\ndomain controller in the server manager,\n\n339\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:29.730\nand I'm gonna go to the active\ndirectory sites and services tool.\n\n340\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.450\nWe're just gonna pull that up for a second\nand just show you where those sites,\n\n341\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.290\nthe default for\nthe site name site actually comes from.\n\n342\n00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.977\nThis has been in place since Windows 2000,\nfor\n\n343\n00:15:39.977 --> 00:15:43.579\nsome preview of the LDAP\nbased active directory,\n\n344\n00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:47.796\nas opposed to the good old\nfashioned NT4 PVCBVC concept.\n\n345\n00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:50.283\n>> Now do you find that\nmost organizations,\n\n346\n00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:53.979\nif they've already got active\ndirectory sites configured,\n\n347\n00:15:53.979 --> 00:15:58.755\nis it pretty easy just to follow those\nalong within our configuration manager?\n\n348\n00:15:58.755 --> 00:16:03.673\nOr do you see him trying, I've already\ngot site set up, and I wanna use IP or\n\n349\n00:16:03.673 --> 00:16:07.050\nsubnets to do my configuration manager.\n\n350\n00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:07.960\n>> We see a lot of both.\n\n351\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.310\n>> Yeah.\n>> And there's no reason not to use one or\n\n352\n00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:11.230\nthe other.\n\n353\n00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:16.735\nThere are, in some cases, going to\nbe reasons to do IP subnets, because\n\n354\n00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:21.245\nyou may want a subset of that Active\nDirectory site set up as its own site.\n\n355\n00:16:21.245 --> 00:16:25.205\nSo there definitely is a reason where you\nmay want to effectively differentiate by\n\n356\n00:16:25.205 --> 00:16:27.140\nIP sub, either IP subnet or\n\n357\n00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.820\nIP address range,\nyou can think about doing it either way.\n\n358\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.420\nIn theory, it really depends on how\nyou set your addressing up within\n\n359\n00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.510\nthe organization.\n\n360\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.320\nA lot of organizations\nwill use private class A,\n\n361\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.220\nranges typically are class C ranges.\n\n362\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.410\nFor some reason, most people don't\nuse class B, I don't know why.\n\n363\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.180\nI like 172 16 a lot myself,\nbut that's just me.\n\n364\n00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:47.907\nBut, in general, what we often see for\nprivate address ranges is 10 dot\n\n365\n00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:52.570\nsomething, or 192 168 0 dot,\nor 192 168 whatever.\n\n366\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.930\nAnd so we see private A or\nprivate C ranges behind the firewalls,\n\n367\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.178\nbehind the MAP devices, right?\n\n368\n00:16:57.178 --> 00:17:02.100\nSo we could certainly segment out\nbased on that, and Mike brings up\n\n369\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.930\na really excellent point to think about\nfrom an architecture perspective.\n\n370\n00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.030\nGo take a gold medal and\na cookie out of petty cash.\n\n371\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:13.762\nSo the idea there is that if we just stick\nto the Active Directory Site Topology and\n\n372\n00:17:13.762 --> 00:17:18.287\nuse the AD sites as you were saying,\nwe're gonna get all of the IP addresses,\n\n373\n00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:22.337\nall those subnets associated with\nthat site, in the Site Boundary.\n\n374\n00:17:22.337 --> 00:17:25.152\nAnd in effect, we're getting\neverything in one Site Boundary,\n\n375\n00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:28.540\nwhich is fine if we wanna manage\neverything all up in one Site Boundary.\n\n376\n00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:33.290\nBut what if in that Site Boundary, we have\ndifferent offices and we wanna maybe have\n\n377\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:37.280\nthe ability to segment our management\nof the infrastructure by office?\n\n378\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.160\nSo that way, we can effectively\nfurther differentiate and\n\n379\n00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.830\nfurther manage down that infrastructure.\n\n380\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.950\nWe would then have to go in and\n\n381\n00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.430\nactually subdivide the Active Directory\nsite into IP based subnet ranges and\n\n382\n00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.680\ncreate site boundaries in SECM\nin order to be able to do that.\n\n383\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.270\n>> Very good.\n>> And so,\n\n384\n00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.630\nthere may be reasons why you\nwanna do one or the other.\n\n385\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:18:00.090\nRemember, there's no right and wrong to\nmaking this choice, the right and wrong\n\n386\n00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.840\ndiscussion is about what is the business\nrequirement that you're managing against.\n\n387\n00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.290\nAnd if you get the business\nrequirement aligned and\n\n388\n00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.020\nspecify the architecture to manage that,\nthen you've made the right choice.\n\n389\n00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.400\nAnd as long as you\nunderstand the requirements,\n\n390\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.100\nyou then can make educated choices.\n\n391\n00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.160\nNow this also brings up a really\nimportant thought process for\n\n392\n00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.140\nus with regards to exam preparation.\n\n393\n00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.970\nWhich is a lot of times, especially\non exams around products like this,\n\n394\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.870\nwhich have complicated\ninfrastructure requirements.\n\n395\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.810\nThere's a lot of options,\na lot of choices you can make.\n\n396\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.302\nExchange is another good example of this.\n\n397\n00:18:30.302 --> 00:18:34.535\nSo SharePoint, where you do those kinds\nof exams, and you're being given,\n\n398\n00:18:34.535 --> 00:18:39.485\nnot just remotes, not remote,\nmultiple choice questions, right.\n\n399\n00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:41.965\nGenerically, hey, look at this,\nwhat's the best option?\n\n400\n00:18:41.965 --> 00:18:43.125\nChoose the one that applies.\n\n401\n00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:44.225\nThose are pretty straightforward.\n\n402\n00:18:44.225 --> 00:18:46.245\nWe've all seen those on exams.\n\n403\n00:18:46.245 --> 00:18:48.435\nBut there's gonna be\nscenario based questions.\n\n404\n00:18:48.435 --> 00:18:50.615\nWe call them case studies\nin the Microsoft world.\n\n405\n00:18:50.615 --> 00:18:52.015\nI'm not saying there definitely will be.\n\n406\n00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:54.235\nI'm saying there could be,\njust to be clear.\n\n407\n00:18:54.235 --> 00:18:57.710\nSo, if there are case study questions,\nthe case study is gonna have\n\n408\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.030\na list of business requirements along\nwith current configuration status and\n\n409\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.860\ntypically topology.\n\n410\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.680\nAnd you're gonna have to then\nblend all that together in\n\n411\n00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.370\norder to figure out how to make\nthe best choices given the scenario or\n\n412\n00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.030\nthe twists and\nturns that are offered in those questions.\n\n413\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.610\nSo you do wanna think about that,\nyou do wanna be aware of that.\n\n414\n00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.170\nIn addition, even if we don't give you\ncase studies on this particular exam,\n\n415\n00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.430\nthere are gonna be certainly network\ntopologies that you may see.\n\n416\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.040\nSo you may see a picture of something\nlaid out, and when they ask you, hey,\n\n417\n00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.840\nbased on this, what's going on?\n\n418\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.620\nWhat's the best choice?\n\n419\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.560\nWhat do I do?\n\n420\n00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.715\nSo there definitely are reasons why you\nwould wanna be cognizant of or aware of.\n\n421\n00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.035\nAnother good word, cognizant.\n\n422\n00:19:35.035 --> 00:19:39.175\nCognizant or aware of the opportunities\nfor you to configure and\n\n423\n00:19:39.175 --> 00:19:41.355\nto make choices here\nbased on requirements.\n\n424\n00:19:41.355 --> 00:19:44.187\nCan be very, very important for you to\ndo that, so glad you brought that up.\n\n425\n00:19:44.187 --> 00:19:47.505\nIt's actually really,\nreally helpful for our studio audience.\n\n426\n00:19:47.505 --> 00:19:51.920\nAll right, so as we are thinking about\nthis then, I've just gone in, and\n\n427\n00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.600\nwhat I've done is, I've opened up\nthe Active Directory Sites and Services.\n\n428\n00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.705\nAnd what we see here is we see that\nwe do indeed have a site called\n\n429\n00:19:58.705 --> 00:20:00.480\nDefault-First-Site-Name site.\n\n430\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.280\nAnd again, I'd like to be the evil\ngenius that gets to name this\n\n431\n00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.960\nstuff at Microsoft or wherever, right?\n\n432\n00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.720\nI know, I sit in a room all day,\nI couldn't possibly come up with a name.\n\n433\n00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.980\nSo I just went ahead and said,\nlet me make the absolute longest,\n\n434\n00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.680\nmost complicated default\nname I can come up with.\n\n435\n00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.880\nBut it's really just could\nhave been as easy as saying,\n\n436\n00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.570\nyeah, it's the default site.\n\n437\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.780\nRight, but\nhas to be Default-First-Site-Name site.\n\n438\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.700\nSo, that's the actual\nformal name by the way.\n\n439\n00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.770\nIt has been that way since Windows 2000.\n\n440\n00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.460\nNobody's thought to change that although\nmany people have commented that\n\n441\n00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.400\nthey should.\n\n442\n00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.240\nI guess that person's been\non an extended vacation and\n\n443\n00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.512\nnobody's been paying attention.\n\n444\n00:20:33.512 --> 00:20:36.790\nSo Default-First-Site-Name\nsite is the site that we get.\n\n445\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.740\nNow could we create our own sites in AD?\n\n446\n00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.290\nAbsolutely.\n\n447\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.580\nThese sites are auto generated\nthrough the auto topology or\n\n448\n00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:47.550\nthe site topology generation that\ntakes place behind the scenes.\n\n449\n00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.700\nWhen we create name spaces and\nwe add domain controllers in, and\n\n450\n00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.320\nwe extend our Active Directory,\nwe're talking about the AD now.\n\n451\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:00.408\nThe Active Directory sites are built on or\nbased on the Active Directory name space.\n\n452\n00:21:00.408 --> 00:21:03.392\nSo we have to understand what\nthe domain tree and the forest are.\n\n453\n00:21:03.392 --> 00:21:05.665\nAnd I'm not gonna go into\nthat whole conversation and\n\n454\n00:21:05.665 --> 00:21:07.850\ndo the two hour drill down\non what these things are.\n\n455\n00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:12.794\nBut the 30 second quick version is a\nforest is the all up container that holds\n\n456\n00:21:12.794 --> 00:21:16.445\nall the name spaces associated\nbelow it through a tree and\n\n457\n00:21:16.445 --> 00:21:19.790\nthen a domain association in a hierarchy.\n\n458\n00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.780\nThe active directory sites and services\ntopology generation is built around\n\n459\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.892\nthe replication pathways that take place\nto create the two way transit of trusts\n\n460\n00:21:28.892 --> 00:21:33.350\nthat link domains from child to parent in\nthe relationship up through the trees and\n\n461\n00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.570\nfrom trees into the forest.\n\n462\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.980\nThese are the pathways that\nallow communication and\n\n463\n00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.380\ntherefore proffer trust through\nthe domain name spaces to occur.\n\n464\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:46.100\nSo if you're in domain A and I wanna go\nover to domain B, I have to have a trust\n\n465\n00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.880\nrelationship and a communication pathway\nthat links the two inside the forest.\n\n466\n00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.970\nThese pathways are auto-generated by\nactive directory when we set these name\n\n467\n00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:57.950\nspaces up and we use the dcpromo wizard\nand you go through and do all that.\n\n468\n00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.200\nWe can also manually create\nadditional ones as fall backs, or\n\n469\n00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.140\nadditional pathways for redundancy.\n\n470\n00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.930\nThat's a whole other conversation for\na different class and\n\n471\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.340\na different kind of set of skills around\nWindows server administration, right?\n\n472\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.900\nSo, things like the 410 or\n411 classes for server 12,\n\n473\n00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.780\nfor instance,\nwould be appropriate for that.\n\n474\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.420\nBut the idea is still the same.\n\n475\n00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.580\nWe have to have those skills here in order\nto be able to understand how to manage\n\n476\n00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.800\nSCCM effectively.\n\n477\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.790\nSo this is where that site comes from,\nthat Default-First-Site-Name site,\n\n478\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.260\nthe AD site that we're talking about.\n\n479\n00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.710\nYou're gonna see it right here, right?\n\n480\n00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.120\nSo, we're just gonna get rid of that.\n\n481\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.130\nWe're just gonna close that out.\n\n482\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.360\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\n\n483\n00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.460\nwe're going to skip back over to\nthe machine that we're on to set this up.\n\n484\n00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.110\nAnd we've got our\nDefault-First-Site-Name selected there.\n\n485\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.870\nJust go ahead and hit Enter on our wizard.\n\n486\n00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.459\nIt's gonna put that in for us.\n\n487\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.720\nWe've got that.\n\n488\n00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.420\nAnd now we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna put a little description in.\n\n489\n00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.570\nBecause no good wizard is going to\nbe complete without a description.\n\n490\n00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.400\nNow the interesting thing is\nthat it's a required field.\n\n491\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.180\nBut it doesn't have the asterisk\nthere to say hey, required.\n\n492\n00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.040\nAnd you have to put a description in or\nit yells at you.\n\n493\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.860\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n494\n00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.590\nwe're gonna do AD site,\njust to make that our description.\n\n495\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.980\nAgain, description is random in the sense\nyou can put whatever you want in there,\n\n496\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.260\nit's really just the descriptive\ntag associated with the object and\n\n497\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.210\nthe console for management purposes.\n\n498\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.534\nYou wanna call that Snoopy's really\ncool AD site, or Woodstock rocks, or\n\n499\n00:23:15.534 --> 00:23:17.668\nwhatever you wanna call that,\ncall that that.\n\n500\n00:23:17.668 --> 00:23:18.248\nIt's up to you.\n\n501\n00:23:18.248 --> 00:23:23.553\n255 characters long file name support,\nand you can just go hog wild as they say.\n\n502\n00:23:23.553 --> 00:23:25.810\nAll right, so we have all that,\nwe're gonna set that up,\n\n503\n00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.127\nand then we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Apply.\n\n504\n00:23:28.127 --> 00:23:33.513\nAnd once we've clicked Apply,\nwe're then gonna click OK.\n\n505\n00:23:33.513 --> 00:23:35.615\nWhy?\n\n506\n00:23:35.615 --> 00:23:39.400\nBecause it's cooler than just clicking OK\nto get it done in one step, that's why.\n\n507\n00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.631\nThere actually is an urban myth and\na legend around Apply and OK.\n\n508\n00:23:42.631 --> 00:23:45.364\nA lot of times, people will say, well,\nhey, why do I have to do both and\n\n509\n00:23:45.364 --> 00:23:47.780\nwhy do you have both, and\nis there really a difference?\n\n510\n00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.878\nAnd the answer is there actually is,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n511\n00:23:49.878 --> 00:23:53.336\nClicking OK is a one-step process\nthat does the application and\n\n512\n00:23:53.336 --> 00:23:56.630\nthen saves the change and\nkills the window all at once.\n\n513\n00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.867\nApply associates the change in\nthe console or whatever you're doing But\n\n514\n00:23:59.867 --> 00:24:02.796\nleaves the window open and\nthen you have to go click OK to close it.\n\n515\n00:24:02.796 --> 00:24:06.540\nSo you're breaking down the process into\ntwo steps instead of doing it in one step.\n\n516\n00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.600\nIs there any difference overall,\nat the end of the day?\n\n517\n00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.990\nWe wound up in same place,\ndoes it impact anything?\n\n518\n00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.090\nSo the urban myth is oh,\nif you don't don't click apply,\n\n519\n00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.390\nthings aren't gonna work.\n\n520\n00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.630\nWrong, right?\n\n521\n00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.960\nWorks just fine, really no issue.\n\n522\n00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.260\nThe real question is why on earth do they\nmake you do both if they could just make\n\n523\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:21.790\nyou do one?\n\n524\n00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.791\nAnd I think it's the same person that did\nthe default first site name site thing.\n\n525\n00:24:24.791 --> 00:24:26.543\n>> [LAUGH] Probably, probably\n>> I think that was also a part of their\n\n526\n00:24:26.543 --> 00:24:27.086\njob description.\n\n527\n00:24:27.086 --> 00:24:28.583\nThey did all that and then they left.\n\n528\n00:24:28.583 --> 00:24:29.306\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n529\n00:24:29.306 --> 00:24:30.611\nthen they've just have\nnever been around so\n\n530\n00:24:30.611 --> 00:24:31.960\nnobody ever thought to\nchange it after that.\n\n531\n00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.260\nSo that's why it's that way.\n\n532\n00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.260\nAll right, so we have our [LAUGH] boundary\nnow and it's been created and you can see.\n\n533\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.650\nLet me zoom back in so as I say\nyou can see, you actually can see.\n\n534\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.170\nYou can see that we actually have gone\nahead and we have our default first site\n\n535\n00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.550\nname boundary up there, type active\ndirectory site, description, AD site, and\n\n536\n00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.590\nwe can see that's now been created.\n\n537\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.850\nSo we've gone ahead and\nwe created our boundary.\n\n538\n00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:54.770\nNow we're going to go ahead and\n\n539\n00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:58.140\ntake that boundary and we're going to link\nit to what's known as a boundary group.\n\n540\n00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.880\nAnd remember, the boundary group\nis effectively going to allow us\n\n541\n00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.300\nto be able to create an associative\ncontainer, an administrative container,\n\n542\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.400\nthat effectively is an object\nthat gathers up boundaries and\n\n543\n00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.130\nallows us then to group them together so\nwe can apply them and manage them.\n\n544\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.640\nAnd that's really what we're gonna do.\n\n545\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.670\nWhat we have here is\nI've just gone ahead and\n\n546\n00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.380\nI've gone and selected the boundary\ngroup right below boundaries.\n\n547\n00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.420\nAnd you'll see that we now have Lab\nBoundary Group which is the boundary group\n\n548\n00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.400\nthat was existing there, we used that to\nset up our secondary site if you remember.\n\n549\n00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.430\nSo that's already just been pre-populated.\n\n550\n00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.130\nNow, to be clear,\n\n551\n00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.910\nin the real world you would not see\nany boundary groups here by default.\n\n552\n00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.100\nYou would have to create these,\nso we have gone ahead and\n\n553\n00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.550\ncreated that boundary group and\nput it in there.\n\n554\n00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.120\nThe minions and gremlins that we\nhave that work behind the scenes for\n\n555\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.110\nus here at ITProTV,\nwent ahead and did that for us.\n\n556\n00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.360\nSo we have that set up, but\nin the real world you would not see that.\n\n557\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.260\nThat would be something that\nwould either be blank, or\n\n558\n00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.290\nsomething that you would\npopulate yourself.\n\n559\n00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.930\nSo what we're going to do is show\nyou how to create one right now.\n\n560\n00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.600\nSo we're going to go ahead, and we are\ngoing to right click on boundary groups\n\n561\n00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.920\nand we'll, as a result of that be\nable to create a boundary group.\n\n562\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.720\nAnd I am gonna zoom in on this one for\njust a second, not to show you that so\n\n563\n00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.890\nmuch, but to show you that up here,\nwe also have a Create Boundary Group icon.\n\n564\n00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.727\nAnd remember through PowerShell we\nhave the option to do that as well.\n\n565\n00:26:06.727 --> 00:26:08.561\nThree, three is the magic number.\n\n566\n00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:10.442\nCan you do the count from Sesame Street?\n\n567\n00:26:10.442 --> 00:26:11.405\nThree!\n\n568\n00:26:11.405 --> 00:26:12.463\nThree!\n\n569\n00:26:12.463 --> 00:26:14.227\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can't really do it well but\n\n570\n00:26:14.227 --> 00:26:15.579\nthree is the magic number.\n\n571\n00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.240\nI love that laugh that he had.\n\n572\n00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.500\nI used to hate Barney, but I loved that.\n\n573\n00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.730\nI think every parent that is of a certain\nage has been scarred by Barney for life.\n\n574\n00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.270\nI just, oh God.\n\n575\n00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.840\nAnd I remember Barney on VHS tapes,\nI mean it wasn't even like Barney on DVD.\n\n576\n00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.155\nIt was the cool Barney on DVD,\nit was like first gen barney on VHS.\n\n577\n00:26:35.155 --> 00:26:36.640\nThat's how old I am.\n\n578\n00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.320\nBut anyways, so we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do this.\n\n579\n00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.320\nWe're gonna provide a name for this,\nso I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n580\n00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.500\ncall this test, click in there so\nthat I can actually do that.\n\n581\n00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.210\nI'm gonna go ahead, whoops.\n\n582\n00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.330\nOh, I did that again.\n\n583\n00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:49.920\nOne second.\n\n584\n00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.330\nI am so silly.\n\n585\n00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.115\nI hit the wrong key.\n\n586\n00:26:53.115 --> 00:26:58.020\n>> [LAUGH]\nYeah, I got a little lag going there.\n\n587\n00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.326\nNo, I don't think I have a little lag.\n\n588\n00:27:00.326 --> 00:27:00.929\n>> Well maybe.\n\n589\n00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:02.184\n>> I think I have.\n\n590\n00:27:06.663 --> 00:27:09.655\nA left click, right click thing going on.\n\n591\n00:27:09.655 --> 00:27:15.100\nNow I have a lag,\nnow I have a spinning machine icon.\n\n592\n00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.870\nSo let me just open\nthe console directly again.\n\n593\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.670\nWe'll just open it back up from here and\nget that going.\n\n594\n00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.900\n>> Now we're good.\n\n595\n00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:28.560\n>> And change focus,\nI think that will help.\n\n596\n00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.920\nCome back and\nsee if we can get that, there we go.\n\n597\n00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.702\nThere we go, okay.\n\n598\n00:27:31.702 --> 00:27:35.520\nAll right so, it's just a matter of making\nsure the gremlins in the Console Wizard\n\n599\n00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.672\nare paying attention.\n\n600\n00:27:36.672 --> 00:27:38.620\nAll right so, let me just come in here.\n\n601\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.190\nAnd let's just call that TestBG for\nboundary group.\n\n602\n00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.272\nWe're just gonna keep it simple for\nnaming purposes, no big deal.\n\n603\n00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:48.250\nAll right, so now what we have to do down\nbelow our name is actually go in and\n\n604\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.060\nadd our boundaries.\n\n605\n00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:53.130\nAnd so what we're gonna do\nis click Add down here and\n\n606\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:58.560\nwe'll see that when I do click Add, I have\nnow two boundaries that could be added in.\n\n607\n00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.450\nWe have that ip range\nthat we had from before.\n\n608\n00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.580\nWe also have our default first site-name\nsite boundary, the AD site boundary.\n\n609\n00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.560\nYou can see we have one or both.\n\n610\n00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.910\nAnd we could choose to add one or both in.\n\n611\n00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.600\nSo it's just a matter, it's a check box,\nit's a matter of choosing which one or\n\n612\n00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.270\nwhich ones we actually\nwould like to add in.\n\n613\n00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.670\nNow the goal here is to understand\nthat we wanna be able to add in one or\n\n614\n00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.680\nmore boundaries based on what we wanna\nachieve from a management perspective as\n\n615\n00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.820\nwe were saying before.\n\n616\n00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.180\nWhat's the goal here?\n\n617\n00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.700\nWhat are we looking to accomplish?\n\n618\n00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.440\nIs it to subdivide an existing\nboundary into smaller units?\n\n619\n00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.770\nIs it perhaps to be able to\ncreate a larger boundary and\n\n620\n00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.730\nhave a bunch of stuff in one place?\n\n621\n00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:32.520\nSo we have options.\n\n622\n00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.720\nWe have to think through ahead of time\nwhat it is that we're gonna want.\n\n623\n00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.450\nSo we're gonna select all the boundaries\nthat are available to us,\n\n624\n00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:41.630\njust to put them all in here,\njust for demonstration purposes.\n\n625\n00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.470\nBut in the real world, we would obviously\nwanna be a little bit more thoughtful\n\n626\n00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.710\nabout this, and try to figure out\nexactly what it is we're looking to do.\n\n627\n00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.970\nSo we're gonna do that,\nwe're gonna click OK.\n\n628\n00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:54.000\nI'm not gonna do Apply and OK,\nI'm gonna be a rebel, shortcut that.\n\n629\n00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.235\n>> Asking for trouble.\n\n630\n00:28:55.235 --> 00:28:56.320\n>> Woo-hoo, as they say.\n\n631\n00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.200\nAll right,\n\n632\n00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.050\nso now that we have that, we will see\nthat we have both boundary groups there.\n\n633\n00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.790\nYou can see we now have\nTest BG up at the top and\n\n634\n00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.950\nLab Boundary Group down\nthere at the bottom.\n\n635\n00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.900\nSo we actually have both,\n\n636\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.110\nand we're able to now effectively see\nthat we have both our boundary groups.\n\n637\n00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.410\nNow the next thing we wanna talk about is\nhow to associate a management point with\n\n638\n00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.130\na boundary group.\n\n639\n00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.620\nA management point is one of the site\nserver roles that are created\n\n640\n00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.690\nupon creation of the site.\n\n641\n00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.460\nThe primary site has a management\npoint associated with it.\n\n642\n00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.220\nThe management point's gonna be critical,\n\n643\n00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.940\nbecause the management point is where\na client goes to get information\n\n644\n00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.950\nabout any policy changes that may\noccur with client agent settings.\n\n645\n00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.570\nSo reconfiguring or\nchanging the client agent\n\n646\n00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.900\nsettings are gonna be done\nthrough the management point.\n\n647\n00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.060\nManagement point is also gonna be where a\nclient goes to update the primary site, or\n\n648\n00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.520\nthe site server on it's status.\n\n649\n00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.800\nSo it reports in through\nthe management point, so\n\n650\n00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.710\nit's a central point of communication.\n\n651\n00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.450\nIt's really how the server reaches out and\nmanages the clients,\n\n652\n00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.760\nhow the clients reach out and effectively\ntalk to the primary site server, or\n\n653\n00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.930\nthe site server that\nthey are associated with.\n\n654\n00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.450\nAnd so as a result of that, we're gonna\nhave to associate that management point,\n\n655\n00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.520\nor management points,\nmeaning more than one, with a boundary.\n\n656\n00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.270\nCuz we have to effectively put\nthe management point into the boundary.\n\n657\n00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.480\nSo that way the clients know that\nthey can communicate with it.\n\n658\n00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.130\n>> Gotcha.\n\n659\n00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.950\n>> Very important.\n\n660\n00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.970\nSo it's not enough just to say,\nhey, let me set up a boundary.\n\n661\n00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:11.870\nLet me establish some.\n\n662\n00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.050\nLet me set up a boundary group and\nassociate the boundaries with that,\n\n663\n00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.640\nif we don't put a management point\ninto that boundary group, or\n\n664\n00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.480\neffectively allow a management point to\nbe associated without those boundaries,\n\n665\n00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.410\nthen clients are not able to effectively\ncommunicate with the system.\n\n666\n00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:28.750\nAnd we're not able to push updates out or\ndelete anything that has to be done or\n\n667\n00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:29.950\nthe clients will not work.\n\n668\n00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.260\nSo this is a very critical\nstep in the process.\n\n669\n00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.360\nProbably the most important\none as a matter of fact.\n\n670\n00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.620\nSo now we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna take a look at how to do this.\n\n671\n00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:43.320\nSo we're gonna go in and we are going\nto [COUGH] make sure we have our\n\n672\n00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.450\nboundary group selected, so let me just\nhighlight our boundary group, there we go.\n\n673\n00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.800\nWe just highlight our boundary group and\nthen what we're gonna do\n\n674\n00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.140\nis we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna bring up the properties of it.\n\n675\n00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.760\nNow I'm just gonna right-click on it so\n\n676\n00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.490\nthat we can bring up the properties\ndown here on the bottom and\n\n677\n00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.350\nI'll zoom in real quick so\nyou can see that just right clicking.\n\n678\n00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.010\nBut notice we have properties\nup on the ribbon as well, so\n\n679\n00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.940\nwe can actually just get there and,\nbelieve it or\n\n680\n00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.580\nnot, Alt Enter, which is\nthe shortcut keyboard short cut for\n\n681\n00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.620\nProperties does work really well and\nanother thing I love if you notice there,\n\n682\n00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.220\nthey don't document all\nthe keyboard shortcuts.\n\n683\n00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.170\nNotice that five is there for refresh,\ndelete the shortcut for delete,\n\n684\n00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.212\nby the way, is delete.\n\n685\n00:31:16.212 --> 00:31:17.368\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's a real good one.\n\n686\n00:31:17.368 --> 00:31:18.168\nLove that.\n\n687\n00:31:18.168 --> 00:31:20.230\n>> That is helpful.\n>> Yeah, that is helpful\n\n688\n00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.490\nin case you forget the Delete is the\nDelete item then you can use the Delete\n\n689\n00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.765\nshortcut to delete something.\n\n690\n00:31:24.765 --> 00:31:26.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then Properties.\n\n691\n00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:27.910\nThey don't have the Alt Enter key, but\n\n692\n00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.830\nyou can use Alt Enter to\nbring up Properties as well.\n\n693\n00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.650\n>> Nice.\n>> I'm just full of\n\n694\n00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.300\nuseless information and\ntrivia here today boys and girls.\n\n695\n00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.610\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna bring up Properties.\n\n696\n00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.620\nSo let me just click on that to bring up\nthe Properties for the Boundary Group.\n\n697\n00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.050\nAnd when we do that,\nwe are going to be able to go in.\n\n698\n00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.160\nAnd as we can see,\nwe do have Boundaries here.\n\n699\n00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.970\nAnd we can go ahead and on our tab here,\nwe can add additional banners.\n\n700\n00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.712\nWe're not gonna do that because\nwe've already done that.\n\n701\n00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:58.439\nWe're gonna go to references and\nI'm just gonna scroll or rather zoom in so\n\n702\n00:31:58.439 --> 00:31:59.337\nyou can see this.\n\n703\n00:31:59.337 --> 00:32:00.850\nI'm gonna go to the references tab.\n\n704\n00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:01.672\nWe didn't look at this earlier.\n\n705\n00:32:01.672 --> 00:32:04.829\nAnd you'll see we have the site assignment\nbox, use this boundary group for\n\n706\n00:32:04.829 --> 00:32:05.630\nsite assignment.\n\n707\n00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:08.049\nAnd then below that we have\nsite system servers and\n\n708\n00:32:08.049 --> 00:32:09.730\nat the bottom there we can hit add.\n\n709\n00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.810\nAnd that's what we're gonna do to\nadd in the management point and\n\n710\n00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.110\nassociate it with the boundary group.\n\n711\n00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.900\nIt begins to make sense,\nsays the grasshopper.\n\n712\n00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.477\nAll right, so what we're gonna do is\nwe're actually gonna come in here,\n\n713\n00:32:21.477 --> 00:32:25.620\nwe're gonna click Add, and we're gonna\nagain get one of those pic less boxes.\n\n714\n00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:30.560\nAnd you'll see that we have\nAdd Site Systems, and we only have one\n\n715\n00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.390\nsite server that we can add in, and\nthis is our primary site server.\n\n716\n00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.160\nHappens to also be a management point,\nbecause management point role is\n\n717\n00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.850\nassociated with the primary\nsite server when we install it.\n\n718\n00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.008\nSo we're gonna go and we're gonna\ncheck that box off and select that.\n\n719\n00:32:42.008 --> 00:32:43.620\nThat's already pre-populated there,\n\n720\n00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.980\nbecause the system knows what\nthe primary site server is.\n\n721\n00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.874\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna check that.\n\n722\n00:32:47.874 --> 00:32:48.840\nWe're gonna click OK.\n\n723\n00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.110\nNotice there's no Apply button there,\n\n724\n00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.826\nwhoever designed that interface\nknew that they were doing.\n\n725\n00:32:53.826 --> 00:32:54.917\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we're going to go ahead and\n\n726\n00:32:54.917 --> 00:32:55.950\nwe're going to click OK.\n\n727\n00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:02.000\nAnd then once we've done that,\nwe are then going to click Apply,\n\n728\n00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.060\nand then okay, just because,\nI'm feeling that way.\n\n729\n00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.630\nAnd, then when we're done,\nas soon as it goes through,\n\n730\n00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:15.160\nwe've effectively assigned the management\nrole, the management site server to that.\n\n731\n00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.364\nNow what I wanna show you, really quickly,\n\n732\n00:33:17.364 --> 00:33:21.310\nis how do we actually know that this site\nserver is a management point, right.\n\n733\n00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.210\nSo we're gonna go over and\ntake a look at that.\n\n734\n00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.100\nSo let's go in here.\n\n735\n00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.620\nJust come down here and\nlet's go to Site Configuration.\n\n736\n00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.330\nI'm gonna zoom in, so you could see this\nin a minute, soon as I open this up.\n\n737\n00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:36.390\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nhighlight Servers and Site System Roles.\n\n738\n00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.510\nAnd we're gonna bring this up, and then as\nsoon as I get everything organized here,\n\n739\n00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.330\nI'm going to zoom in,\nso we can see all that.\n\n740\n00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.560\nSo what I did is still\nin the same workspace,\n\n741\n00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.560\nI went to Site Configuration,\nwent to Servers and Site System Roles.\n\n742\n00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.330\nOff to the right here you'll\nsee my primary site server,\n\n743\n00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:53.670\nand then we can see the roles down below.\n\n744\n00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.360\nAnd as we look over at\nthe roles that are assigned,\n\n745\n00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.410\nthere are six of them there by default.\n\n746\n00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.550\nThe third one down, you can see,\nis the management point.\n\n747\n00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.710\nAnd that's assigned as part of the build\nout of the primary site server\n\n748\n00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:05.280\nautomatically.\n\n749\n00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.730\nI don't have to actually add that in.\n\n750\n00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.180\nBut if I did wanna add a role in, and\nwe will talk about how to add roles and\n\n751\n00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:14.160\ndo this formally in a demo in a future\nepisode, but I want to preview it for you.\n\n752\n00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:19.710\nIt's always good to leave our thought\nprocess kind of wrapped up nicely\n\n753\n00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.270\nin a bow and really bring it all back\ntogether and just show you what we can do.\n\n754\n00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.590\nWe have Add Site System Role option.\n\n755\n00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:29.470\nWe can just right click on the site server\nthere and we can add the site system role.\n\n756\n00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:32.470\nAnd when we do that, we have a little\nwizard that comes up, so we'll just\n\n757\n00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:35.880\nclick that and just show you quickly the\nbeginning of what this process looks like.\n\n758\n00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.930\nLet me just scroll down so we can\nactually see what's going on in there.\n\n759\n00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:41.790\nSo, on this one, on the first screen\nwhich you don't really need to look at,\n\n760\n00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.460\nwe just have the name of the site\nserver operating on the site code.\n\n761\n00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.408\nThat's easy, what we wanna do\nis we wanna get past that.\n\n762\n00:34:47.408 --> 00:34:50.325\nWe wanna go past the proxy screen\ncuz we're not using proxies.\n\n763\n00:34:50.325 --> 00:34:53.205\nBut if you are, obviously you\nwould provide that information.\n\n764\n00:34:53.205 --> 00:34:57.065\nAnd then what we wanna do, is we wanna\nzoom in and see on the system role\n\n765\n00:34:57.065 --> 00:35:00.865\nselection area, that we have a list of all\nthe system roles that are available to us.\n\n766\n00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:03.938\nAnd what you'll notice is that the ones\nthat have already been assigned,\n\n767\n00:35:03.938 --> 00:35:06.221\nlike the management point,\nthe distribution point,\n\n768\n00:35:06.221 --> 00:35:08.222\nare not on that list cuz\nthey're already used.\n\n769\n00:35:08.222 --> 00:35:13.093\nSo we only have the ones available there\nthat are outstanding that we have not set\n\n770\n00:35:13.093 --> 00:35:13.609\nup yet.\n\n771\n00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:16.259\nAnd so we can always tell what a site\nserver's function is by looking\n\n772\n00:35:16.259 --> 00:35:19.188\nat the properties and seeing what\nthe roles are that are already assigned,\n\n773\n00:35:19.188 --> 00:35:21.768\nor going through and looking at\nwhich roles are still available.\n\n774\n00:35:21.768 --> 00:35:23.092\nWe could do this either way.\n\n775\n00:35:23.092 --> 00:35:25.732\nSo one other thing that we wanna\ntalk about briefly as well is how,\n\n776\n00:35:25.732 --> 00:35:28.612\nnot just adding site roles,\nnot just setting up the management point,\n\n777\n00:35:28.612 --> 00:35:31.690\nwe've done all that and\nthat's obviously gonna be very important.\n\n778\n00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.260\nBut I mentioned at the beginning\nof our conversation the concept of\n\n779\n00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.694\nActive Directory Forest Discovery.\n\n780\n00:35:35.694 --> 00:35:38.900\nAnd I wanna just quickly show you what\nthat first discovery method looks\n\n781\n00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.562\nlike as well.\n\n782\n00:35:39.562 --> 00:35:42.530\nWe're gonna take a look at the other\ndiscovery methods in an upcoming\n\n783\n00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:43.460\nconversation.\n\n784\n00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.370\nBut this particular discovery method's\ncritical here because this is what\n\n785\n00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.058\nactually ties in for\nus the ability to understand and\n\n786\n00:35:50.058 --> 00:35:53.131\nrecognize our IP subnets and\nthe AD sites and bring them in.\n\n787\n00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:54.733\nIf we want to actually\nhave access to them.\n\n788\n00:35:54.733 --> 00:35:57.422\nSo wanna go back into the demo\nenvironment for just one more minute,\n\n789\n00:35:57.422 --> 00:35:58.471\nwanna take a look at that.\n\n790\n00:35:58.471 --> 00:36:01.165\nSo we are going to stay\nin the admin workspace.\n\n791\n00:36:01.165 --> 00:36:04.038\nWhat we're gonna do is just go\nup to Discovery Methods under\n\n792\n00:36:04.038 --> 00:36:05.890\nHierarchy Configuration.\n\n793\n00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:07.164\nAnd we're going to zoom in, so\n\n794\n00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:09.830\nyou could see this real quick\nbefore we do anything in here.\n\n795\n00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:10.670\nSo, we're still there.\n\n796\n00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:14.510\nWe're just working our way up all those\ndifferent options up underneath Hierarchy.\n\n797\n00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.902\nWe're hitting all of them to make sure\nyou know what's going on in there.\n\n798\n00:36:16.902 --> 00:36:19.360\nGoing to leave no method\nunturned as they say.\n\n799\n00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.850\nAnd Discovery Methods off to the right,\nyou will see that we have a total of six.\n\n800\n00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.200\nWe're gonna break down all of these for\n\n801\n00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.705\nyou in an upcoming conversation and go\nthrough each one, but for now we're just\n\n802\n00:36:28.705 --> 00:36:32.040\ngonna focus on Active Directory Forest\nDiscovery, which is at the top.\n\n803\n00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.510\nYou'll notice that status is\nset to disabled by the way.\n\n804\n00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:36.760\nAnd we're gonna go in and\nwe're gonna take a look at that and\n\n805\n00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.314\njust examine what's going on in there.\n\n806\n00:36:38.314 --> 00:36:44.930\nSo I'm gonna highlight that one, and going\nto, as soon as we are able to select it.\n\n807\n00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.610\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna bring that up.\n\n808\n00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:50.164\nAnd I'm gonna bring up Properties.\n\n809\n00:36:50.164 --> 00:36:54.251\nSo I'm just gonna right click,\ngo to Properties.\n\n810\n00:36:54.251 --> 00:36:55.180\nI'm glad you approved, sir.\n\n811\n00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.498\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n812\n00:36:57.498 --> 00:37:02.178\nwe are going to be able to enable this.\n\n813\n00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:06.650\nSo I'm gonna check off the box to enable\nthe discovery method before I show it you.\n\n814\n00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.450\nAnd then I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna zoom in so you can see it,\n\n815\n00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.100\nbecause there really isn't much\nto it to be honest with you.\n\n816\n00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.370\nAll we have is one tab there.\n\n817\n00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.620\nI did just check off the box\nto enable it just so\n\n818\n00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.820\nyou can see that because then the other\nboxes and the options become available.\n\n819\n00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.600\nIf we don't do that,\nthey'll all grayed out.\n\n820\n00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.300\nSo we have Enable Forest Discovery,\ncheck that off.\n\n821\n00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.780\nThen you'll see automatically\ncreate AD site boundaries\n\n822\n00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.120\nwhen they are discovered as an option.\n\n823\n00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.160\nWe can check that off.\n\n824\n00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.160\nAutomatically create IP\naddress range boundaries for\n\n825\n00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.850\nIP subnets when they are discovered.\n\n826\n00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.740\nCheck that off.\n\n827\n00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.725\nSo if I don't wanna go in and manually put\nin my IP subnets, I don't wanna go in and\n\n828\n00:37:37.725 --> 00:37:41.735\nmanually put in all of my Active Directory\nsites based on replication topology.\n\n829\n00:37:41.735 --> 00:37:46.299\nI can come in here, enable this discovery\nmethod, check off those two boxes,\n\n830\n00:37:46.299 --> 00:37:50.653\nsit back, wait an hour or two, and then\nit will go ahead and it will go out and\n\n831\n00:37:50.653 --> 00:37:55.427\nrun the discovery pathway, find everything\ndocumented and bring it all back in,\n\n832\n00:37:55.427 --> 00:37:59.060\nset it all up for automatically\ninside of the Config Manager.\n\n833\n00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.393\nAnd then I'll have my boundaries\nalready populated and\n\n834\n00:38:01.393 --> 00:38:03.210\nthen I can create my boundary groups.\n\n835\n00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:07.920\nSo I can do this this way and\ntake a lot of the workload off of me, or\n\n836\n00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.130\nI can go ahead and auto or rather manually\nconfigure everything we took a look at.\n\n837\n00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.456\nNow remember I told you that one of\nthe magic numbers with FCCM is seven,\n\n838\n00:38:15.456 --> 00:38:17.360\nas in seven days from one week.\n\n839\n00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.760\nYou'll notice that the schedule for this,\nby default, is set to run once a week.\n\n840\n00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.720\nSo more often than not,\nmost of the schedules for\n\n841\n00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.230\ndiscovery will run once every seven days.\n\n842\n00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:29.290\nNow we can modify that,\nthat's definitely something we can change.\n\n843\n00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:32.390\nThe reason we don't run it more\naggressively is it's very unlikely\n\n844\n00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.380\nthat when we're dealing with\nActive Directory sites, or\n\n845\n00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.930\nIP subnets within the sites,\nthat those are gonna change very often.\n\n846\n00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:41.030\nSo the reality is once a week is usually\nmore than enough to capture anything that\n\n847\n00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.540\nmay be added in.\n\n848\n00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.880\nSo you think about it,\nonce you get a system up and running,\n\n849\n00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.730\nyou've got your topology setup, it's very\nrare that you add a brand new site and\n\n850\n00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:49.730\nvery rare you extend your subnets.\n\n851\n00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:52.370\nIt may happen, but\nit just doesn't happen very often, right?\n\n852\n00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:53.830\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n853\n00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:57.270\nBut that discovery type is going to be\ndisabled by default as all of them are,\n\n854\n00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:00.200\nas a matter of fact, with one exception.\n\n855\n00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.000\nAnd let's just take a quick look at this\neven though it's not set up this way right\n\n856\n00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.790\nnow, but since we're here, I'll just\ngo through this with you quickly.\n\n857\n00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:10.430\nSo you will notice that we have\nthe Active Direction System Discovery,\n\n858\n00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.700\nthe third item down, is set to enabled.\n\n859\n00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.420\nAnd Heartbeat Discovery,\nthe fifth item down, is set to enabled.\n\n860\n00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.830\nThe only one that is turned on by default\nout of the box is the Heartbeat Discovery.\n\n861\n00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.970\nAll the other discovery methods\nare actually turned off,\n\n862\n00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.080\nthey are all disabled by default.\n\n863\n00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.470\nWe'll talk about why in an upcoming\nepisode, as we go through and\n\n864\n00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.080\nwe demo these Discovery Methods.\n\n865\n00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.370\nBut for now just understand that the only\ndiscovery method that we normally be\n\n866\n00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:37.201\nturned on unless you've made changes\nwill be Heartbeat Discovery.\n\n867\n00:39:37.201 --> 00:39:38.200\n>> All right, good.\n\n868\n00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.516\nAll right, Adam again,\nanother great episode,\n\n869\n00:39:40.516 --> 00:39:44.280\ngreat demonstration of how we work with\nour boundaries and our boundary groups.\n\n870\n00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.470\nThank you so much for that.\n\n871\n00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:48.020\nHope everybody out there enjoyed\nwatching and remember if you wanna\n\n872\n00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.960\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\nshoot us email here at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n873\n00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.500\nSigning off, I'm Mike

--> 00:00:17.190\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.680\nToday we're doing our system center\nconfiguration manager 2012 R2.\n\n5\n00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.970\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\nbe looking at discovery methods.\n\n6\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.010\nNow in a previous episode we kinda\ngot started with that, right?\n\n7\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.350\nAt the end of our boundaries and\nboundary groups,\n\n8\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.720\nAdam showed us one called Active\nDirectory, or four is Active Directory.\n\n9\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.720\nFour is discovery, and\nwe took a quick peek at it.\n\n10\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.220\nBut as we saw, there were several other\nmethods, I think four other methods\n\n11\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.430\nthat we could use, five other methods\nthat we could use for discovery.\n\n12\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.590\nSo here to help us with all\nthat is Adam Gordon of course.\n\n13\n00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.932\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:49.291\n>> I'm good, I'm good,\nrun Forrest, run, run!\n\n15\n00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:50.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n16\n00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.740\nwe're gonna take a look at discovery.\n\n17\n00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.550\nResearch discovery,\ndiscovery mechanisms if you will.\n\n18\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.230\nWe're gonna continue, as Mike said,\nthat conversation we previewed for,\n\n19\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.570\nwe gave you a little teaser of,\nin the last episode.\n\n20\n00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.586\nWe are gonna do that in two ways, right.\n\n21\n00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:07.520\nWe're going to actually do a little\nshow and tell with some slides,\n\n22\n00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.000\ntalk about a few things, just give you\na little better understanding graphically,\n\n23\n00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.990\nof what actually happens\nwith discovery first.\n\n24\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.060\nSo we're gonna set up the file process,\nhelp to explain or\n\n25\n00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.180\nhelp to illustrate by doing that what the\nmechanics are that operate under the hood.\n\n26\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.820\nThen we're gonna go back into demo\nenvironment as we've been doing and\n\n27\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.750\nwe're gonna take a look live at all\nthe discovery methods the ones we showed\n\n28\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.110\nyou in the last episode.\n\n29\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.110\nWalk through each one,\ntalk about how to set them up,\n\n30\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.280\nwhat happens with them, why they work\nthe way they do, why they're important,\n\n31\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.500\nwhy are all of them turned off\nby default except for discovery.\n\n32\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.570\nWe'll go through all that.\n\n33\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.960\nAnd then when we're done, we'll come\nback out, we'll take a look at some of\n\n34\n00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.290\nthe associated support mechanisms like the\nlogs that are gonna be generated around\n\n35\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.810\nsome of this, and of course, you never\nwanna leave out PowerShell commandlet and\n\n36\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.510\nsome of the things that\nmay be valuable there.\n\n37\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.355\nSo we'll take a look at a couple of those,\nmake sure you are aware of them and\n\n38\n00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:54.535\nknow what you need to know about those for\nthe exam.\n\n39\n00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:55.687\nSo let's go ahead and let's jump in.\n\n40\n00:01:55.687 --> 00:01:57.765\nI wanna take a look at Mike's machine and\n\n41\n00:01:57.765 --> 00:02:00.397\ntake a look at that nice graphic\nthat Mike put together for us there.\n\n42\n00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:02.795\nWanna talk a little bit\nabout resource discovery,\n\n43\n00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:04.505\nfrom kind of a picture perspective.\n\n44\n00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:06.365\nCan we zoom in just a bit,\njust a wee bit there.\n\n45\n00:02:06.365 --> 00:02:07.545\nA little too much, but okay.\n\n46\n00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:08.335\nAll right, that's good.\n\n47\n00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:10.195\nThat's probably good right there,\nwe can see that.\n\n48\n00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:14.470\nSo what we have on the left is,\n\n49\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.880\nat the upper left hand corner, we have\na machine labeled as Active Directory.\n\n50\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.360\nThat would be a domain controller\nin other words, right?\n\n51\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.733\nAt the lower left hand side we've\ngot some scattering of machines.\n\n52\n00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:26.512\nI think we see a printer down there,\ncouple of work stations,\n\n53\n00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.179\ngot a server sitting off to the side.\n\n54\n00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:32.621\nThose are all network components that\nwe can go out and interact with and\n\n55\n00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.580\nthen in the circle we've\ngot a site server.\n\n56\n00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.995\nThe site server as we know in\nthis case primary site server.\n\n57\n00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:41.455\nIt's gonna be the machine that's gonna\ncontrol the activity, interact with and\n\n58\n00:02:41.455 --> 00:02:42.685\nkinda coordinate all this.\n\n59\n00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:46.095\nWe have an arrow that's moving\noff towards the site database.\n\n60\n00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:48.915\nSite database is gonna be a SQL\ndatabase sitting out there.\n\n61\n00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:52.635\nAnd under the arrow we have the dot or\nperiod DDR.\n\n62\n00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:55.795\nI know it's kinda hard to see,\nwe may wanna zoom in just a little bit.\n\n63\n00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:59.085\nMichael, highlight that for us or\nat least zoom in and show us that.\n\n64\n00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:03.970\nSo .DDR, we're gonna have something to\nsay about .DDR and that file extension,\n\n65\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.070\nand what that represents in just a minute.\n\n66\n00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.490\nSo let's actually stayed\nzoomed in right there.\n\n67\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.200\nIt's actually really good.\n\n68\n00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.680\nLet's talk about this for a second.\n\n69\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.590\nSo what we have going on here is the site\nserver that is sending out communication\n\n70\n00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.283\ninformation or requests for information\nto either the active directory and\n\n71\n00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:22.606\nor network related systems and\nservices down below.\n\n72\n00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:24.280\nThat's what those arrows represent.\n\n73\n00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.720\nIt simply just requests or represents\na request for the site server to\n\n74\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.640\neffectively find information, to discover\nas we're talking about information.\n\n75\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.430\nSo the process of\ndiscovery is the process of\n\n76\n00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.580\nfiguring out what's out there\ninside of our network, or\n\n77\n00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.890\nacross the network, in all the little\nnooks and crannies we can look in.\n\n78\n00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.310\nAnd then gathering up\nall that information,\n\n79\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.050\nbringing it back in using one or\nmore discovery methods.\n\n80\n00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.870\nSo that's what we're gonna focus\non in the demo environment.\n\n81\n00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.940\nAnd then recording that information\ninto the site database, and\n\n82\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.240\nthat's where the .DDR file comes in.\n\n83\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.630\nThe site server is gonna run one or\n\n84\n00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.040\nmore discovery methods,\ngather up all that information.\n\n85\n00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.020\nWhen it does, it has to send that\ninformation over to the site database and\n\n86\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.580\nthen put it into the appropriate table so\nthat it can reference it and\n\n87\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.430\nuse it for future communications and\nall the stuff it needs to do.\n\n88\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.740\nIt does that by creating\na series of .DDR records.\n\n89\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.640\nThe DDR records are going to\nbe the currency if you will,\n\n90\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.600\nthe mechanism of exchange, the formatting\nfor the information that we have\n\n91\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.750\nthat comes back from all the end\npoints that are discovered.\n\n92\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.180\nAnd then is used to transmit that\ninformation into the SQL database.\n\n93\n00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.236\nNow here is something interesting.\n\n94\n00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:38.090\nCan we go to that Google page search we're\ngonna talk about doing for a second?\n\n95\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.150\nSo Mike's got Google up.\n\n96\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.450\nI'm gonna ask Mike to go ahead and type\nin either .ddr or ddr file, either way.\n\n97\n00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.640\nIt doesn't really matter,\njust do either one.\n\n98\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.780\nAnd we're gonna hit Enter, and\nMike's gonna zoom in on the results.\n\n99\n00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.790\nNow the reason we're doing\nthis is lot of times,\n\n100\n00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.000\npeople say, hey Adam, what's the DDR\nextension, what does that mean?\n\n101\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.680\nAnd I'll tell you what it means,\nit means data discovery record.\n\n102\n00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.950\nBut when you search for DDR file, and you\ndon't put SCCM on the end of it, what you\n\n103\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.730\nget is a bunch of random stuff, because\nDDR is not exclusively used by Microsoft.\n\n104\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.350\nIt's used by all sorts of other vendors to\n\n105\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.420\ndeal with their particular\nfile extensions.\n\n106\n00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.672\nThere's all sorts of stuff in there from\ndifferent vendors about a USB key fob\n\n107\n00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:23.336\nextension, and all sorts of stuff\nthat you find that has nothing to\n\n108\n00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:25.973\ndo with the actual DDR file extension for\nSCCM.\n\n109\n00:05:25.973 --> 00:05:29.498\nNow if we go back up to the Google search,\n\n110\n00:05:29.498 --> 00:05:34.800\ndo .ddr file sccm 2012, and\nyeah, and then hit Enter.\n\n111\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.889\nWhat we're gonna see is you're gonna\nget ConfigMgr related information.\n\n112\n00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.200\nYou'll see SCCM 2007.\n\n113\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.470\nYou go down a little bit more,\nInbox Folders in ConfigMgr, et cetera,\n\n114\n00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.840\net cetera, et cetera.\n\n115\n00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.470\nNow remember, and then like fifth one\ndown is this data discovery record.\n\n116\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.930\nRemember that even though a lot\nof this kind of stuff, for\n\n117\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.570\ninstance most of the DDR references\ninitially, are all referencing SCCM 2007.\n\n118\n00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.565\nThat's okay.\n\n119\n00:05:59.565 --> 00:06:01.935\nBecause the DDR extension hasn't changed.\n\n120\n00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:05.315\nIt's identical, it was still used\nthe same way it was in 2007.\n\n121\n00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:07.375\nIt's still being used\nthe same way in 2012.\n\n122\n00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:11.435\nSo the fact that we see older references\nis really not a big deal in most cases.\n\n123\n00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:12.870\nIn this case it doesn't matter.\n\n124\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.080\nBut what I just wanted to show\nyou is that it's critical for\n\n125\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.400\nyou when you're looking up this\ninformation, trying to figure it out\n\n126\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.490\nto make sure you're getting the right\ninformation by asking the right questions.\n\n127\n00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.630\nIn this case it's always\nimportant to extend or\n\n128\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.060\nadd the SCCM reference on the end of that\nquery so that we actually focus in on\n\n129\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.410\nthe right file, the right\ninformation with the right product.\n\n130\n00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.890\nAs opposed to just randomly searching and\npotentially maybe getting something that\n\n131\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.580\nmay work, but may actually\ngive us erroneous information.\n\n132\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.900\nYou have another good word, erroneous.\n\n133\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.530\n>> Very good.\n\n134\n00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.570\nMy vocabulary is building up every day.\n\n135\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.040\n>> You are gonna be the vocabulary\nmaster by the time we are done\n\n136\n00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.403\nthis week going through all these lessons.\n\n137\n00:06:48.403 --> 00:06:49.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n138\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.980\nSo we go back to the diagram for\njust a second.\n\n139\n00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.730\nSo now that we know what a DDR\nfile is Data Discovery Record\n\n140\n00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.260\nis what DDR stands for.\n\n141\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.160\nThose Data Discovery Records\nare gonna be created and\n\n142\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.400\nmoved over through discovery, through\nthe site server into the site database.\n\n143\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.540\nThat's the process that we're\ngonna effectively go through.\n\n144\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.160\nWe're gonna take a look at an example.\n\n145\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.590\nSo what we're gonna do now is\nwe're gonna go into my machine and\n\n146\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.230\nwe're gonna actually go take a look and\n\n147\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.580\nwe're gonna see how we actually go through\nthese discovery methods and set them up.\n\n148\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.250\nIt's gonna magically appear\nthere on the screen.\n\n149\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.821\nI didn't get to do my poofy thing.\n\n150\n00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:21.337\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Can we put the other one back up\n\n151\n00:07:21.337 --> 00:07:21.903\nfor a minute.\n\n152\n00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:23.502\nI go poof and it can reestablish?\n\n153\n00:07:23.502 --> 00:07:24.554\nNo, I guess, not important.\n\n154\n00:07:24.554 --> 00:07:25.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's already there.\n\n155\n00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.580\nLet's pretend I did that and\nthere it is, it's good.\n\n156\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.730\nSo let's go,\nlet's talk about discovery methods.\n\n157\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.000\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna,\nwhoa, okay.\n\n158\n00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000\nGotta make sure we don't use that.\n\n159\n00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.800\nI did this with the track and\nwow, look at it.\n\n160\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.785\nOkay, sorry I'm making you\ndizzy out there, I apologize.\n\n161\n00:07:37.785 --> 00:07:39.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're not gonna do that,\n\n162\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.030\nwhat I wanna do is, give me half a second\nhere, let me just actually refresh my lab.\n\n163\n00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.710\nThat's what I wanted to do to get back up,\nso we don't wind up with a timeout.\n\n164\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.937\nSo what I wanna do is I just wanna show\nyou, oh so now you put it back up.\n\n165\n00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:52.168\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, there we go, all right.\n\n166\n00:07:52.168 --> 00:07:55.473\nSo now what we're gonna see is We're\ngoing to be able to see all the different\n\n167\n00:07:55.473 --> 00:07:58.366\ndiscovery methods that are there,\nand we have the six of them, and\n\n168\n00:07:58.366 --> 00:07:59.310\nwe do have six total.\n\n169\n00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.500\nMike said there were five, but we're going\nto talk about besides the active directory\n\n170\n00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.940\nforest discovery method,\nwe've already talked about that one,\n\n171\n00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.510\nthat's the one at the top and that's\nback to disabled because I just simply\n\n172\n00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.160\nhit cancel, I didn't bother to\nenable it when we did the last demo.\n\n173\n00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.800\nSo we left it in that state.\n\n174\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.450\nWe did talk about the fact that of all\nthe discovery methods, all six of them,\n\n175\n00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.060\nthe only one that is going to be enabled\nby default is the Heartbeat Discovery.\n\n176\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.230\nAnd so, we're gonna actually start talking\nabout that one first since it's the one\n\n177\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.010\nturned on.\n\n178\n00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.490\nThe other one that's already there,\nactive directory system discovery,\n\n179\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.850\nis turned on because we're\nusing it to find computers.\n\n180\n00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.050\nWe'll talk about that and\nwhy that's important.\n\n181\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.380\nLet's start with Heartbeat Discovery.\n\n182\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.725\nSo, I'm gonna go in,\nI'm gonna highlight heartbeat discovery\n\n183\n00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:39.008\nand- [SOUND]\n>> Time out,\n\n184\n00:08:39.008 --> 00:08:41.580\nthat's not Heartbeat Discovery.\n\n185\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.982\nYou tried to go full screen with your\nlab and it went to the wrong machine.\n\n186\n00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.495\n>> Oh!\nOkay, all right, no problem, that's cool.\n\n187\n00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:49.558\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Okay.\n\n188\n00:08:49.558 --> 00:08:53.971\n>> [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK]\n>> He's gotta mark it so\n\n189\n00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:56.490\nthey can find out where it is.\n\n190\n00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.380\n>> Are we good?\n\n191\n00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.490\nGood, okay, alright.\n\n192\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.480\nSo let's go,\nlet's take a look at Heartbeat Discovery.\n\n193\n00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.260\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead,\nI'll slow down and talk so\n\n194\n00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.670\nyou can actually understand me.\n\n195\n00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.410\nI'm gonna go ahead, and I'm gonna skip\nevery third word while I'm talking.\n\n196\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.720\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna click\non Heartbeat Discovery to bring it up.\n\n197\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.070\nOr highlight it rather, and\nthen if I can get it to, there we go.\n\n198\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.260\nAnd, going to right click and\nchoose properties.\n\n199\n00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.560\nLet's bring that up.\n\n200\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.760\nAnd when we do that, scroll over here so\nwe can see that, I will zoom in,\n\n201\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.100\nbecause I'm that kind of person, and-\n>> Thank you.\n\n202\n00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.600\n>> You are welcome.\n\n203\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.090\nSo it's important to be nice to the\npleasant people that are doing things for\n\n204\n00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.981\nyou, especially if you want\nthem to do them the right way.\n\n205\n00:09:35.981 --> 00:09:37.262\n[LAUGH] So it is important.\n\n206\n00:09:37.262 --> 00:09:39.347\nSo what we see here is that\nwe have a check box for\n\n207\n00:09:39.347 --> 00:09:41.050\nenabling the discovery method.\n\n208\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.080\nAll the discovery methods have to be\nturned on if we're gonna use them.\n\n209\n00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.560\nWe can turn them all on or off so\n\n210\n00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.920\nthere is an on, off mechanism\nin effect for every one of them.\n\n211\n00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.470\nThe only one that's turned on by default\nas you can see is Heartbeat Discovery so\n\n212\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.120\nthat's enabled.\n\n213\n00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.265\nAnd then the Heartbeat\nschedule as you can see,\n\n214\n00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:59.065\nremember I said the magic number for SCCM,\none of them, is seven days or one week.\n\n215\n00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.315\nWe can see it runs once every seven days.\n\n216\n00:10:01.315 --> 00:10:03.775\nNow, the reason Heartbeat Discovery\nis turned on by default, but\n\n217\n00:10:03.775 --> 00:10:06.175\nall the other's is not,\nis actually kind of interesting.\n\n218\n00:10:06.175 --> 00:10:11.120\nWhat Heartbeat Discovery does, is it goes\nout and effectively it's like a ping.\n\n219\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.130\nGoes out and\nhits all the agent machines, or\n\n220\n00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.490\nall the machines that are being managed,\nonce a week and\n\n221\n00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.140\nchecks to see the status to make sure\nthat effectively they're up and running.\n\n222\n00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.540\nWe send our Heartbeat Discovery record\nout to the site and that way we say,\n\n223\n00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.890\nhey yeah we're still alive.\n\n224\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.850\nNow the reality is once we setup and\n\n225\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.650\nwe install the agent on a machine and\nwe start managing it,\n\n226\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.540\nwe're gonna have multiple ways to\ntell that the machine is there.\n\n227\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.140\nBut the Heartbeat Discovery keeps us\nhonest and makes sure that at least once\n\n228\n00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.710\na week, that client checks in so that we\nupdate the status in the site database\n\n229\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.980\nto ensure that we know that\nthat client is still active.\n\n230\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.330\nNow a lot of people ask and say, well,\n\n231\n00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.560\nshouldn't we be doing that\nmore aggressively, right?\n\n232\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.790\nI mean, isn't that important?\n\n233\n00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.792\nShouldn't we, in theory, be doing that,\nI don't know, every 30 minutes or\n\n234\n00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:51.483\nsomething crazy like that or\nwhatever it is?\n\n235\n00:10:51.483 --> 00:10:55.330\nThe answer is no because we have other\nmechanisms that actually allow us to check\n\n236\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.040\non the client and make sure it is up and\nrunning as well and\n\n237\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.700\nsome of those are going to\nrefresh more frequently.\n\n238\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.590\nWhen we get into talking about client\nagent settings we will be doing that in\n\n239\n00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.880\nan upcoming episode, we're going to see\nthat we're going to check on those client\n\n240\n00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.960\nagent settings and refresh those\nprobably about every 15 minutes.\n\n241\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.070\nAs result of that, we're gonna\nknow that that clients there and\n\n242\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.430\nwe're not gonna have to worry about it.\n\n243\n00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.200\nSo then the logical question then becomes,\n\n244\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.530\nwell okay then, why do we even bother\nwith Heartbeat Discovery at all?\n\n245\n00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.670\nWe bother with it because we\nhave different needs that we're\n\n246\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.770\nservicing with these\ndifferent check in points.\n\n247\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.260\nThe check in point for\nclient agent settings to be refreshed\n\n248\n00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.170\nis about configuring the client to\nmake sure it's working the right way.\n\n249\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.650\nThis check in for Heartbeat Discovery\nis about updating the status flag on\n\n250\n00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.930\nthe client in the site database to\nensure we know that it's still active.\n\n251\n00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.370\nSo these perform different functions,\nbut ultimately wind up,\n\n252\n00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.290\neffectively getting us to the same place.\n\n253\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.930\nSo we do set this up,\nwe do run this once a week.\n\n254\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.420\nThere usually is not a reason to change\nthis timeline setting by the way,\n\n255\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.460\nyou can certainly get more\naggressive with this.\n\n256\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.350\nBut the reality is once a week is usually\nthe best practice accepted way of doing\n\n257\n00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.780\nthis, and more often than not\ndoes not need to be changed.\n\n258\n00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.770\nSo this is set up by default, there's\nreally nothing we have to do in there,\n\n259\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.090\nother than simply just acknowledge\nthe fact that it's running.\n\n260\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.620\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna hit Cancel on this one.\n\n261\n00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.740\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ntake a look at some of the others.\n\n262\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.430\nNow we have four of the six discovery\nmethods that are involved with\n\n263\n00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.060\nActive Directory.\n\n264\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.150\nSo I'm gonna take those as a block,\nwe're gonna look at those next, and\n\n265\n00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.950\nwe'll save network discovery for\nthe last one,\n\n266\n00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.398\nwhich is the one down at the bottom\nbecause that's kind of a special one.\n\n267\n00:12:21.398 --> 00:12:23.610\nWe'r going to talk about that and\ntalk about some options there.\n\n268\n00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.340\nBecause we don't set\nthat up the right way,\n\n269\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.120\nwe actually run the risk of potentially\ncausing a network outage because of\n\n270\n00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.070\nthe bandwidth storm we're\ngonna create as a result.\n\n271\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:31.970\nSo we'll talk about that and\n\n272\n00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.033\nwhy that's important to test\non your friend's network.\n\n273\n00:12:34.033 --> 00:12:35.520\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n>> And not test on your own,\n\n274\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.820\nwe'll come back to that\nwhole thought process.\n\n275\n00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.830\nAlright, so active directory Forest,\nwe've talked about that one already.\n\n276\n00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.230\nWe see what that one is.\n\n277\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.470\nLet's talk about it, or\nhaven't seen what that on is I should say,\n\n278\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.940\nlet's talk about the next one down which\nis Active Directory Group Discovery.\n\n279\n00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.550\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nhighlight that one.\n\n280\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.890\nAnd, just give me half a second\n\n281\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.865\nhere to wait for\nthe console to kick out and come back in.\n\n282\n00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.725\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As is the case in some of these demos.\n\n283\n00:13:05.725 --> 00:13:06.480\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n284\n00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.780\n>> So give me a second.\n\n285\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.000\nI've figured out why it does that.\n\n286\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.260\nNow we're gonna change focus and\nfix that problem, is what we're gonna do.\n\n287\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:12.962\nHere we go.\n\n288\n00:13:14.264 --> 00:13:15.230\nShould, there we go.\n\n289\n00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.580\nIt's that whole zoom in and\nzoom out thing, it's the focus.\n\n290\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.090\nAll right.\nSo\n\n291\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.970\nnow of course what I did was\nrandomly scramble there we go and\n\n292\n00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.140\nput it back in the right order.\n\n293\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.760\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna go to Group Discovery and\n\n294\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.970\nI'm gonna right click and\ngo to Properties.\n\n295\n00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.170\nAnd bring up the properties of\nthe Active Directory Group Discovery item.\n\n296\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.080\nSo we'll select that.\n\n297\n00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.820\nAnd I'm going to zoom in and\nlet you see what that looks like, but\n\n298\n00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.190\nI'm just going to enable it first so\nI'm just going to simply put a check mark\n\n299\n00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.640\nin the box there so\nyou can see what's going on with that.\n\n300\n00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.420\nAnd I'm going to highlight the add item\nand then zoom in so you can see that.\n\n301\n00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.880\nAnd you'll see that we have the Active\nDirectory Discovery Method enabled, so\n\n302\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.950\nI've turned that on.\n\n303\n00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.150\nYou'll see at the bottom that we\ncan add in discovery scopes and\n\n304\n00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.110\nI can add by group or location.\n\n305\n00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.980\nWe'll take a look at that to\nsee what that is in a minute.\n\n306\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.200\nWe've got a polling schedule tab that's\nwhere we set up how often we want it\n\n307\n00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.930\nto happen, so we'll go and we'll take\na look at that, and we have some options.\n\n308\n00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.360\nSo let's go in and\nlets see whats going on there.\n\n309\n00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.090\nLets add in groups, or least lets just\ntalk about adding in by group and\n\n310\n00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.610\nlets take a look at what that looks like.\n\n311\n00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.530\nWhen we add by group, as you can see,\nwe specify a group to discover.\n\n312\n00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.370\nConfig Manager goes out discovers\nthe members of the group and\n\n313\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.890\nnested groups that may be in there.\n\n314\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.751\nSo we have to give this a name, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and specify a name.\n\n315\n00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:27.917\nAnd-\n>> It's not really that it's discovering\n\n316\n00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:30.710\ngroups, it's using groups\nto discover resources.\n\n317\n00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.310\nIt's going-\n>> You gotta tell it the groups.\n\n318\n00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:38.870\n>> Well no, so, what we're going to do is\nwe're gonna go into the Active Directory\n\n319\n00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.402\ndomain, we're going to use the structure\nof the domain, and then what we're\n\n320\n00:14:42.402 --> 00:14:46.670\ngoing to do is we're going go in and\nsay okay, tell me what groups are there.\n\n321\n00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.180\nSo we'll take a look,\nthis is just the screen, zoom in.\n\n322\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.330\nSo let's actually just set this up.\n\n323\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.120\nI was gonna start typing,\n\n324\n00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.778\nbut then I realized I was on the picture,\ncan't type on the picture.\n\n325\n00:14:53.778 --> 00:14:55.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n326\n00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.200\ngive this a name, and\nthere we go, one second.\n\n327\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.950\nOkay, change focus, come back in,\nand we could solve that problem.\n\n328\n00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:03.651\n>> Getting good.\n\n329\n00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:04.338\n>> Come right back to where we were.\n\n330\n00:15:07.295 --> 00:15:07.995\n>> Come on.\n\n331\n00:15:07.995 --> 00:15:09.365\nThere we go.\n\n332\n00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:10.875\nShould register a click.\n\n333\n00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:12.585\nAnd then we should be able\nto get back to our console.\n\n334\n00:15:12.585 --> 00:15:13.165\nThere we go.\nAlright.\n\n335\n00:15:13.165 --> 00:15:14.975\nSo that's just a focus issue.\n\n336\n00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:15.745\nNothing to do with you guys.\n\n337\n00:15:15.745 --> 00:15:18.710\nIt has to do with just the the nature\nof the zoom tool we're using.\n\n338\n00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.690\nIt screws up the focus in the console and\nscrews up the remote connection.\n\n339\n00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.580\nWe gotta just come out and\ncome back in and get it to work.\n\n340\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.440\nSo we figured that out over\nthe last couple of episodes.\n\n341\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.810\nSo you may happen from time to time and\ndon't worry about it.\n\n342\n00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:30.920\nWe'll just work right through it.\n\n343\n00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.834\nAlright, so what we're gonna do is\nuse the default domain in Forest.\n\n344\n00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:38.332\nAnd then here under groups, lets go\nahead and click add real quick, and\n\n345\n00:15:38.332 --> 00:15:42.121\nwe can specify if there are going to be\nany distinguished names or groups we may\n\n346\n00:15:42.121 --> 00:15:46.166\nwant to use specifically unless we want to\nhard code certain groups we can do that.\n\n347\n00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:48.406\nWe have to go out and find all\nthe group that are there its up to us.\n\n348\n00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.718\nWe can actually program in\ncertain groups and say hey,\n\n349\n00:15:50.718 --> 00:15:52.587\nJust bring back everything you find there.\n\n350\n00:15:52.587 --> 00:15:53.702\nAnd then kind of tell me what's there.\n\n351\n00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:56.380\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and let that run.\n\n352\n00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.610\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\n\n353\n00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.690\nsay use the site server computer account\ndown at the bottom or specify an account.\n\n354\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.350\nThis is the connection account that's\nused to query Active Directory.\n\n355\n00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.660\nWe're gonna use the site server's\ncomputer account, and if you remember\n\n356\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.160\nwhen we did this, and if you don't\nremember this, if you have not seen it, or\n\n357\n00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.990\nyou might have seen it, but it's been\na little while since you watched it.\n\n358\n00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.680\nIf you go back and\nlook at the episode where we actually\n\n359\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.530\ndo the run through in the lab of\nsetting up the primary site server and\n\n360\n00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.670\nyou remember we had to add in the computer\naccount of the primary site server\n\n361\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.400\nto give it rights to write to\nthe system container that we created.\n\n362\n00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.250\nSystems manner for container in AD and\n\n363\n00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.506\nwe gave that computer account rights\nto effectively do be able to do that.\n\n364\n00:16:33.506 --> 00:16:36.370\nThat is the same computer account we're\ngonna use to go do the discovery.\n\n365\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.500\nSo we've given it rights to effectively\ngo into the Active Directory\n\n366\n00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.050\nand work with that.\n\n367\n00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.660\nAnd that's why it's\ngonna find all of this.\n\n368\n00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.530\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n369\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.440\nSo we're gonna have all that.\n\n370\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.860\nSo we're gonna go ahead we're gonna set\nthat up, or at least just click OK.\n\n371\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.420\nAnd you'll see we wanna have one or\n\n372\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.010\nmore groups on my list just to be able\nto go out and discover something.\n\n373\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.470\nI'm not worried about that right now\n\n374\n00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.860\nbecause we're not just\nactually gonna go do it.\n\n375\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.240\nI'm just showing you what it would be.\n\n376\n00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.800\nSo we're gonna go in,\nwe're gonna just hit Cancel here.\n\n377\n00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.650\nBut you got the idea.\n\n378\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.260\nWe'll set that up and then once we've\ndone that, we can either do that or\n\n379\n00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.560\ndo by location.\n\n380\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.430\nSo let's just choose by\nlocation real quick.\n\n381\n00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.320\nAnd what we can do is, you can see\nhere I can go in and I can specify,\n\n382\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.350\nand I'll zoom in so you can see.\n\n383\n00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.370\nWe can specify the Active Directory\nlocation again have to go in and\n\n384\n00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.540\nspecify what the naming context will be.\n\n385\n00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.370\nSo our LDAP path Yo for OU equals\nDC equals whatever for the domain.\n\n386\n00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.250\nAnd then we can go through and\nspecify what account will be used as well.\n\n387\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:27.370\nSo again, just another way for us to\ngo in and do a search and to discover.\n\n388\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.140\nSo we can go in and we could set that up.\n\n389\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.870\nWe then have to specify\na polling schedule.\n\n390\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.550\nYou'll see that is going to be configured\nthere for every seven days, again,\n\n391\n00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.410\nby default.\n\n392\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.250\nAnd notice that we've\nEnable delta discovery.\n\n393\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.900\nBy default it's turned on.\n\n394\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.370\nDelta discovery,\nthis is kind of interesting, right?\n\n395\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.720\nWhat delta discovery does is\nafter we gotta do full discovery\n\n396\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.690\nrun through on most of these mechanisms,\nwe've got a lot of information.\n\n397\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.688\nWe've also generated a fair amount\nof traffic initially to do this.\n\n398\n00:17:53.688 --> 00:17:55.890\nWe don't wanna go back and\nreinvent the wheel every time right, and\n\n399\n00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.400\ndiscover everything all over\nagain that we already know about.\n\n400\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.330\nInstead, what we do is just simply run\na delta discovery looking for changes.\n\n401\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.550\nSo that if we add new groups or\nanything like that those get picked up or\n\n402\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.270\nchanged to the groups we already\ndiscovered will be picked up.\n\n403\n00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.340\nAnd then we'll simply\nrecord those changes.\n\n404\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.820\nSo delta discovery allows us to\nstreamline and be bandwidth aware, right,\n\n405\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.470\nand kinda manage that bandwidth and\nbe more cognizant of and\n\n406\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.140\ntherefore better steward of our resources,\nif you will.\n\n407\n00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.102\nNotice the delta discovery\ninterval is 5 minutes by default.\n\n408\n00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:26.267\nSo every five minutes we're looking for\ndelta changes.\n\n409\n00:18:26.267 --> 00:18:28.845\nOnce a week we do a full discovery, so\n\n410\n00:18:28.845 --> 00:18:33.520\nthat way if we miss anything in\nthe delta updates every 5 minutes.\n\n411\n00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:39.559\nSo 5 into 60 is twelve,\n[CROSSTALK] more than twelve?\n\n412\n00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:43.360\nSo it's 12, every 12, 12 times an hour and\nthen 24 hours in a day.\n\n413\n00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.100\nSo 24 x 12, which I have no clue what\nthat will be but you can figure that out.\n\n414\n00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.370\nThat would be, what,\n288 I think if I'm not mistaken.\n\n415\n00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:56.110\nAnd then from there, so 288 times a day,\nand then do that by seven days.\n\n416\n00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:00.750\n1600 and change, and\nwhatever that will be, we actually\n\n417\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.900\nare doing close to 1600 touches every\nfive minutes to find deltas, and\n\n418\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.900\nthen one full discovery cycle once a week\nin order to capture anything we missed.\n\n419\n00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.530\nSo like I said, we have multiple\nways of getting this information in,\n\n420\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.070\nand we're getting a lot of it over time,\nright?\n\n421\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.000\nSo we have all that.\n\n422\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.568\nSo we're gonna get out of this one.\n\n423\n00:19:16.568 --> 00:19:18.075\nWe effectively.\n\n424\n00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:19.350\nOh, let me just show you the options.\n\n425\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.540\nThis is what I forgot to mention, options.\n\n426\n00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.500\nSo let me just go in there.\n\n427\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.150\nSo you'll see here that we also on the\nOptions tab have the ability to go in and\n\n428\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.910\ndiscover computers that have logged on\nour domain during a given period of time.\n\n429\n00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.020\nSo we can actually say,\nhey show me only computers or\n\n430\n00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.180\ngroups that have been used for\nx number of days, right?\n\n431\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.870\nWhatever that is, times since last log\non in days, and we can discover and\n\n432\n00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:37.750\nwork through that.\n\n433\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.250\nWe can also discover the membership\nof distribution groups.\n\n434\n00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.290\nSo we actually pull\ndistribution groups in as well.\n\n435\n00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.391\nNow we're not really interested in groups\nas much as users as you were pointing out.\n\n436\n00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:48.966\nWhat we really want is we want the user\nmembership in the groups because what we\n\n437\n00:19:48.966 --> 00:19:52.156\nactually are gonna do and we're gonna\ngo over here to collections for\n\n438\n00:19:52.156 --> 00:19:53.810\njust a second so I can show you this.\n\n439\n00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.945\nAnd we'll zoom in as soon\nas I change the workspace.\n\n440\n00:19:55.945 --> 00:20:01.760\nBut what we actually wanna focus on is the\nfact that one of the two collection types,\n\n441\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.810\nwe're gonna talk about collections in\nan upcoming episode, but one of the two\n\n442\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.600\ncollection types that we are able to\nuse is gonna be user collections.\n\n443\n00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.680\nSo you see,\nDevice Collections are there as well.\n\n444\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.820\nAnd under the User Collections,\nyou see we have the groups there.\n\n445\n00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.410\nWe do want groups because we wanna\nbe able to know we have groups or\n\n446\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.410\nwe really want our users because\nwhen we distribute software,\n\n447\n00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.160\nwe have the option to distribute\nsoftware either to computers,\n\n448\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.780\nthrough device collections or\nto users based on user collections.\n\n449\n00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.060\nSo we discover and we populate those\ncollections based on that and then we\n\n450\n00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.670\nultimately push software applications and\nor packages equals software.\n\n451\n00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.140\nWe push software out to one or\nmore collections based on membership.\n\n452\n00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.450\nIt's actually a very straightforward\nprocess when you think about it,\n\n453\n00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.550\nbut the way we populate collections\nis through discovery and\n\n454\n00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.330\nthat's why we need to\nbe doing the discovery.\n\n455\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:45.030\nSo we're gonna go back.\n\n456\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.652\nGo into back to\nthe administrative workspace.\n\n457\n00:20:48.652 --> 00:20:50.420\nWe're gonna come back over\nhere to discovery methods.\n\n458\n00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.380\nWe'll just wait on that to come back up.\n\n459\n00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.660\nSo we've got\nActive Directory User Discovery.\n\n460\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.110\nExcuse me,\nActive Directory Group Discovery rather.\n\n461\n00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.705\nWe've got forest discovery.\n\n462\n00:20:58.705 --> 00:21:02.858\nLet's take a look at user discovery which\neffectively is basically gonna be the same\n\n463\n00:21:02.858 --> 00:21:03.870\nconcept.\n\n464\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.510\nThe idea that we're gonna do discovery but\njust with users.\n\n465\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.350\nGonna bring that up.\n\n466\n00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.945\nI'm just gonna enable that.\n\n467\n00:21:08.945 --> 00:21:13.337\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click on the little icon,\n\n468\n00:21:13.337 --> 00:21:15.150\nthe asterisk, which is new.\n\n469\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.190\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna get an Active Directory container.\n\n470\n00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.040\nLet me just zoom in and show you that.\n\n471\n00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.140\nThis specifies the active container or\nthe AD container that we want to search.\n\n472\n00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.380\nSo you'll see we have to specify\na path window browse for that.\n\n473\n00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.750\nAnd then we can search for those Active\nDirectory users and or groups and then\n\n474\n00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.080\nuse the computer account that we are going\nto be using as we talked about earlier.\n\n475\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.675\nAnd so if we go in we Browse here.\n\n476\n00:21:38.275 --> 00:21:41.445\nWe can indeed pull up the new container.\n\n477\n00:21:41.445 --> 00:21:43.595\nWe'll just move that over so\nyou can see that and\n\n478\n00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:46.235\nyou'll see that we have the domain\nthere with all the OUs.\n\n479\n00:21:46.235 --> 00:21:49.145\nWe just specify what OU or\nOUs we wanna actually go into.\n\n480\n00:21:49.145 --> 00:21:52.985\nSo if I specify I want the domain and I\nwanna be able to search the whole domain I\n\n481\n00:21:52.985 --> 00:21:55.835\nput that in there and\nthen go ahead and click OK.\n\n482\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:01.060\nAnd then I have that set up, and then once\nI've done that that's populated in there.\n\n483\n00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.350\nSo it's put the name space in for\nme, tells me where I wanna go.\n\n484\n00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.650\nAnd then I go and\nI take a look at polling schedule.\n\n485\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:07.930\nSame thing we looked at.\n\n486\n00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:12.090\nDelta discovery is there once every\nseven days for the full discovery.\n\n487\n00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:16.000\nAnd we do delta discovery once every\nfive minutes, worked out that.\n\n488\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.150\nAnd then we have\nan Active Directory attribute area,\n\n489\n00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.710\nwhich is kind of interesting.\n\n490\n00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.350\nFor users.\n\n491\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.400\nWe can go in and we can specify what\nActive Directory object attributes\n\n492\n00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.490\nare gonna be discovered for the user.\n\n493\n00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.140\nSo if we wanna only populate\ncertain attributes,\n\n494\n00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.660\nwe can actually streamline that process,\ncuz the ones that are on that list on top,\n\n495\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.520\nare the ones that\nare discovered by default.\n\n496\n00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.851\nBut we may want others, and so on the left\nthere is a list of available attributes.\n\n497\n00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:42.812\nAnd we can move those over by\nselecting to the right, and\n\n498\n00:22:42.812 --> 00:22:44.892\nthen we can add to that attribute list.\n\n499\n00:22:44.892 --> 00:22:47.646\n>> So there may be a unique\nidentifier like an employee ID or\n\n500\n00:22:47.646 --> 00:22:50.990\nsomething that's not populated and\ndiscovered automatically but\n\n501\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.859\nis in the system because we've modified\nthe user attributes in the AD schema by\n\n502\n00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:58.510\ngoing in and using ADSI Edit as we\ndid to add the system container.\n\n503\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.000\nWe can actually discover those\nif we need to and use them.\n\n504\n00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.990\nNow the reason we would do this\nis several different reasons.\n\n505\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:07.320\nOne of the main ones would be probably\nbecause when we do reporting,\n\n506\n00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.260\nwe wanna look at deployments and or\n\n507\n00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.240\ntrack deployments across users who may\nwanna use that attribute to uniquely\n\n508\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.740\nidentify the users that were gonna\nget them distributed software.\n\n509\n00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.250\nSo we may wanna pull in an employee ID and\nthen in reporting, which we'll talk about\n\n510\n00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:22.520\nin one of our future episodes, be able to\nadd that attribute into a custom report\n\n511\n00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.040\nand then pivot on that to\naffect we see what's happening.\n\n512\n00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.310\nSo there may be reasons here why having\nthese attributes will become valuable.\n\n513\n00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:29.469\n>> Nice,\n>> If you wanna be able to know\n\n514\n00:23:29.469 --> 00:23:30.860\nthat we can do that.\n\n515\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.080\nSo when we're talking about the Active\nDirectory User Discovery method,\n\n516\n00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.040\nremember the idea behind the attribute\nfields there is that we can actually then\n\n517\n00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.410\ngo in the theory customize, right?\n\n518\n00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.175\nAnd so,\nwe'll make that connection again for\n\n519\n00:23:39.175 --> 00:23:41.448\nyou later when we talk about\nreporting in another episode.\n\n520\n00:23:41.448 --> 00:23:43.689\nSo we've done\nActive Directory User Discovery method.\n\n521\n00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:46.530\nWe've done the forest discovery method,\nwe've done the group discovery method.\n\n522\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.131\nWe've talked about Heartbeat Discovery.\n\n523\n00:23:48.131 --> 00:23:49.791\nGot four down, two to go.\n\n524\n00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:52.080\nAwfully excited about this one.\n\n525\n00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.266\nActive Directory System Discovery is the\nnew one that we're gonna take a look at.\n\n526\n00:23:55.266 --> 00:23:56.150\n>> I see.\n\n527\n00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.910\n>> So let's go in,\nlet's take a look at that one.\n\n528\n00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.300\nSo that's gonna be\nhighlighting it in our list.\n\n529\n00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:06.070\nWe're gonna do that and as soon that\nis able to highlight and select.\n\n530\n00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.370\nWe'll go ahead and we'll bring that up.\n\n531\n00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:12.000\nLet me actually just do this real quick\nand change our focus, come back in.\n\n532\n00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.610\nThere we go.\n\n533\n00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:21.880\nAnd then should be able to connect in and\ngrab our discovery method.\n\n534\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.780\nAll right, there we go.\n\n535\n00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.270\nSo I want System Discovery.\n\n536\n00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.740\nNow let's highlight that one.\n\n537\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:31.706\nAnd let's right click and\nlet's get our properties up there.\n\n538\n00:24:31.706 --> 00:24:35.304\nSo we're gonna bring that up.\n\n539\n00:24:35.304 --> 00:24:39.810\nAnd just bring that up a little bit in\nthe frame there so we can see that.\n\n540\n00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.130\nAnd what we have with\nthe active discovery, or\n\n541\n00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.780\nthe Active Directory System Discovery\nmethod, is you'll see that, again,\n\n542\n00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:48.500\nit has to be turned on.\n\n543\n00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.730\nI've taken the liberty of\nturning that one on for us.\n\n544\n00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:55.050\nI've also taken the liberty of adding\nin some active directory container name\n\n545\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.620\nreferences like we did in\nthe other one already.\n\n546\n00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.990\nSo those are there, you can see those.\n\n547\n00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.000\nAnd so now that we have those,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n548\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.390\nwe'll just simply look at\nthe other options that we have.\n\n549\n00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:04.550\nWe do have a polling schedule,\n\n550\n00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.620\nthat's gonna be the same exact\nschedule we see for all the others.\n\n551\n00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.430\nWe do have our active\ndirectory attributes as well.\n\n552\n00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:17.530\nBut instead of the user attributes,\nwe are going to be getting the option to\n\n553\n00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.700\nadd in all the other attributes that may\nactually be associated with the computer.\n\n554\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.570\nSo we're gonna wanna be able to get\ncomputer-based attributes as well.\n\n555\n00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.360\nSo we'll be able to go in and\npull in the computer account and\n\n556\n00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.240\nall that kind of stuff, and\nthings that may be of interest to us.\n\n557\n00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.480\nThere was a DNS hostname in there,\nI don't know if you saw that,\n\n558\n00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.060\nbut that was on the list.\n\n559\n00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.210\nSo obviously those kind of\nthings will be important.\n\n560\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.450\nAnd then under options here.\n\n561\n00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:42.193\nAgain, we do have the option to be able to\ngo in and use that, hey, when was the last\n\n562\n00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:45.634\ntime that computer was discovered, or\nrather logged in concept and say only\n\n563\n00:25:45.634 --> 00:25:49.431\ncomputers that have been actively used\nwithin this time frame will be discovered.\n\n564\n00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:52.259\nCuz we may have computers that\nare not being actively used right now,\n\n565\n00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:55.107\nwe may want to exclude them,\nto not actually discover them, right?\n\n566\n00:25:55.107 --> 00:25:56.920\nSo we can think about that.\n\n567\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.930\nSo we'll turn that on and\nturn that method on and\n\n568\n00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.950\nwhen we do that, we've got those enabled.\n\n569\n00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.230\nNow, in our system the only other\ndiscovery method other than heartbeat\n\n570\n00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.370\nthat is currently enabled\nis system discovery.\n\n571\n00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:09.070\nWhat often happens is you\nturn on system discovery\n\n572\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.960\nto start discovering all of\nthe computers that are out there.\n\n573\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.380\nRemember, these are computers that\nare not gonna be managed right away.\n\n574\n00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.180\nIn other words, they don't have\nagents installed on them initially.\n\n575\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.720\nWe just wanna find them,\nbut they're unknown to us.\n\n576\n00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.090\nLet me show you what I mean by unknown.\n\n577\n00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:24.800\nWe're gonna go back to the assets and\ncompliance work space.\n\n578\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.460\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nbring this up in a second for you.\n\n579\n00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.850\nI'm gonna switch, instead of\nshowing you the User Collections,\n\n580\n00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.180\nwhich is what we had a minute ago.\n\n581\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.020\nI'm gonna go into\nthe Device Collections area.\n\n582\n00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.580\nAnd I'm gonna zoom in.\n\n583\n00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.970\nAnd what you'll see here,\nwe've chosen Device Collections,\n\n584\n00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:44.770\nis under all systems, I have ten\nsystems that have been discovered and\n\n585\n00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.540\nI have two unknown computers.\n\n586\n00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.380\nAll the systems that\nare available to me but\n\n587\n00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.460\ndon't have agents on them right now are\ngoing to be on the all systems collection,\n\n588\n00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.780\nand until I install an agent our clients,\nin other words.\n\n589\n00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.770\nI don't actually have the ability\nto manage that system, but\n\n590\n00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.890\ndiscovery populates that collection for\nme so I could begin to reach out to\n\n591\n00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.960\nsystems that are not managed and\nactually deploy an agent onto them and\n\n592\n00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.830\nbegin to manage them cuz this\nis how the process kicks off.\n\n593\n00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.163\nAnd if you look down below, where it\nsays All Desktops and Server Clients,\n\n594\n00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:16.620\nyou'll see it's showing me that under\nMember Count, Member Visible on Site,\n\n595\n00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.650\nReference Collection,\netcetera, there's no members.\n\n596\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.630\nMeaning, I have,\nof those machines that are there,\n\n597\n00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.850\nthe ten that are there,\nnone of them have agents on them.\n\n598\n00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.000\nNone of them are currently\nbeing managed right now.\n\n599\n00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.560\nRight?\n\n600\n00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.880\nSo that's what we're doing, we're using\nthis ability to engage in discovery.\n\n601\n00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.130\nAnd discovery mechanisms to actually\nthen drive populations of collections.\n\n602\n00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.192\nWe'll pick that thread up\nin a future episode and\n\n603\n00:27:36.192 --> 00:27:38.875\ntalk about how to take collections and\ndo something like this.\n\n604\n00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:40.908\nIf you take a look at\nthe screen real quick,\n\n605\n00:27:40.908 --> 00:27:42.613\nlet me show you a neat little trick.\n\n606\n00:27:42.613 --> 00:27:46.151\nWe can go to all systems,\nthis collection, and\n\n607\n00:27:46.151 --> 00:27:51.994\nwe can potentially decide that we want to,\nI'll just zoom in so you can see it.\n\n608\n00:27:51.994 --> 00:27:55.640\nIts grayed out right now but you can see,\nwe could where I'm pointing to choose to\n\n609\n00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.191\ninstall a client we can actually then\nchoose to run the install client wizard.\n\n610\n00:27:59.191 --> 00:28:02.600\nNow the reason it's grayed out right now\nis that I did this in a demo off screen\n\n611\n00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.470\nbefore we got back on with you guys.\n\n612\n00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.190\nAnd I canceled out of the wizard,\nI didn't cancel it out.\n\n613\n00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.400\nI canceled it out but\nI just kinda shut it off.\n\n614\n00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.250\nI didn't actually go back and\nrefresh the screen and reset it.\n\n615\n00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.540\nSo it still thinks it's trying to do\nan install which is why it's grayed out.\n\n616\n00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.510\nBut that's just a little\nglitch in the environment.\n\n617\n00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.160\nIt's nothing to do with the way\nthe product really normally works.\n\n618\n00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.760\nNormally I could go ahead and\nselect that and do an install client.\n\n619\n00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.120\nThe reason I cancelled out of it was, I\nwas just testing something really quickly\n\n620\n00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.000\nand most of those machines, the ten that\nwe have discovered really don't exist.\n\n621\n00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.270\nThey're phantoms or ghosts.\n\n622\n00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.590\nWe only have three machines running in\nthe environment and so I got an error at\n\n623\n00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.510\nthe end of the wizard saying, hey eight\nof these machines are not even available,\n\n624\n00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.170\nwhat are you thinking about doing and\nit wouldn't have worked the right way so\n\n625\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:42.860\nI canceled it.\n\n626\n00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.110\nI have to reset the system\nin order to get rid of that.\n\n627\n00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.220\nI just haven't bothered to do\nthat in the demo environment.\n\n628\n00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.110\nThat's why it's grayed out.\n\n629\n00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.710\nThat's why you're seeing it that way,\njust so you know.\n\n630\n00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.700\nIn case you're wondering,\n\n631\n00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.660\nwell how can you install a client if\nwe can't actually get the option.\n\n632\n00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.666\nSo we definitely can normally.\n\n633\n00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:57.913\nIt's just a little glitch with what we're\ndoing here, but that's the idea and\n\n634\n00:28:57.913 --> 00:29:01.406\nthat's what we'll do, and we'll bring that\nthought process together with pushing\n\n635\n00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.558\nthe client agent out and\nthen once we've done that.\n\n636\n00:29:03.558 --> 00:29:07.900\nOnce we have actually deployed the client,\nwe'll in a discussion around that\n\n637\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.060\ncome back into the area\nthat we're in right here.\n\n638\n00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.210\nWhich is back in\nthe administration work space, and\n\n639\n00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:19.520\nwe'll scroll down, and\nwe will take a look at client settings,\n\n640\n00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.800\nand again, we'll do this in a future\nupcoming episode as well, but\n\n641\n00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.730\nwe'll go in and take a look at\nthe default client settings.\n\n642\n00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.115\nI'm just going to bring them up so\nyou can get a sense of what's in there.\n\n643\n00:29:29.115 --> 00:29:30.620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n644\n00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:36.450\n>> And we will be talking in great detail\nabout all the options that exist in here.\n\n645\n00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.730\nI'm just gonna slide this over so\nyou can kinda see this when I zoom in.\n\n646\n00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.003\nAnd so, what you're seeing is,\n\n647\n00:29:42.003 --> 00:29:44.620\nI've gone back to the administration\nwork space down here.\n\n648\n00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.840\nI've gone to client settings.\n\n649\n00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.670\nYou could see it kinda right there\nat the bottom of the screen.\n\n650\n00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:55.630\nI've moved over to default\nclient settings, and now.\n\n651\n00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.380\nWhat I've done is brought\nup the properties.\n\n652\n00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.650\nI have list of all the client settings\nin here that we're gonna go through and\n\n653\n00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:01.410\ntalk about it.\n\n654\n00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.670\nEffectively this is how we\nconfigure the client agent running\n\n655\n00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.140\non an individual end point\nto effectively be managed.\n\n656\n00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.180\nThese are like registry settings in effect\nbecause these are the leverage we pull to\n\n657\n00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.460\nbe able to configure the software and\n\n658\n00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.450\nget it to do things we want it\nto do on each individual client.\n\n659\n00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.980\nWe then push this out\nwith a policy update, and\n\n660\n00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.180\nthe client talks to the management point,\nsays, oh,\n\n661\n00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.240\nthere's an update, let me reconfigure my\nagent so that it operates the right way.\n\n662\n00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.690\nAnd this is how we make changes.\n\n663\n00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.607\nThis is the life cycle in effect, right?\n\n664\n00:30:27.607 --> 00:30:29.165\nThe circle of life, as they say.\n\n665\n00:30:29.165 --> 00:30:30.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Timon and\n\n666\n00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.890\nPumba of the systems management\nconfiguration suite.\n\n667\n00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.710\nSo this is what we're ultimately\ngonna be doing this week.\n\n668\n00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.530\nContinue our conversations and\nsome of these additional episodes\n\n669\n00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:42.670\ncoming up with new demos and\nsome additional things we'll delve into.\n\n670\n00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.620\nWe're gonna bring together those threads.\n\n671\n00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.970\nLet's go back and\nlet's talk about network discovery.\n\n672\n00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.460\nBecause that's the last discovery\nmethod we have going on there so\n\n673\n00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.420\nwe'll wrap that part of\nthe conversation up.\n\n674\n00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.240\nThen we're gonna talk about some of the\nlogs that are associated with discovery\n\n675\n00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.380\nand we'll talk a look at those.\n\n676\n00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.110\nSo let me go back up to discovery methods\nhere, we'll just reload those discovery\n\n677\n00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.410\nmethods and we're gonna go ahead, we're\ngonna take a look at network discovery.\n\n678\n00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.640\nSo I'll highlight that one and we'll\ngo ahead and we'll bring this one up.\n\n679\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.561\nGo in to properties here,\n\n680\n00:31:11.561 --> 00:31:16.729\noh wait we have to get that\n[CROSSTALK] back in there.\n\n681\n00:31:16.729 --> 00:31:19.179\n>> While we're waiting for that,\nI have a question for you.\n\n682\n00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:20.247\n>> Yeah.\n\n683\n00:31:20.247 --> 00:31:22.380\n>> So we got all these different\ndiscovery methods that we can use.\n\n684\n00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.310\nIs it important that we use one or\nthe other?\n\n685\n00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.570\nCan we turn them all on?\n\n686\n00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.522\nAm I worried about duplicate\ndiscovery in other words?\n\n687\n00:31:29.522 --> 00:31:30.630\n>> Sure, and it's a great question and\n\n688\n00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.980\nactually gonna be a good segue into\nwhat we're doing with network discovery.\n\n689\n00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.528\nSo let's address the question holistically\noverall then we'll talk about specifics of\n\n690\n00:31:36.528 --> 00:31:37.389\nnetwork discovery.\n\n691\n00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:41.441\nSo the question is, hey,\ncan I just flip all these switches on,\n\n692\n00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:43.926\ndo likr this massive discovery event.\n\n693\n00:31:43.926 --> 00:31:46.666\nMaybe have a party,\nserve some cocktails, little food.\n\n694\n00:31:46.666 --> 00:31:47.525\nIt's kinda nice out this time of year.\n\n695\n00:31:47.525 --> 00:31:48.128\n>> Sounds fun, yeah.\n\n696\n00:31:48.128 --> 00:31:50.130\n>> Could have a little\noutside activity thing.\n\n697\n00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.360\nIt would be cool, right?\n\n698\n00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.762\nYeah, maybe not so cool, and here's why.\n\n699\n00:31:54.762 --> 00:31:58.080\nEvery one of these discovery methods\ngenerates traffic, and if we have too much\n\n700\n00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.880\ntraffic going through the system and too\nmuch stress on the system simultaneously,\n\n701\n00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.490\nwe're not gonna get duplicative\ndiscovery method data back.\n\n702\n00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.970\nThat's not necessarily a concern,\nso it is not that.\n\n703\n00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.600\nIt really is more about the stress\nwe put on the system and\n\n704\n00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.150\nthe fact that we are gonna be generating\na tremendous amount of traffic to do\n\n705\n00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:17.280\nall this discovery.\n\n706\n00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.330\nIt's really more about the stress and\nthe potential liabilities associated with\n\n707\n00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:25.010\nall that traffic than it is about oh,\nif I do four discovery methods all around\n\n708\n00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.780\nActive Directory, am I gonna get\nfour entries for every item?\n\n709\n00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.730\nWe're not really worried about that,\nbut we are worried about the stress and\n\n710\n00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.420\nstrain that this puts on the system.\n\n711\n00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.290\nWe are especially worried about it\nwith regards to Network Discovery, and\n\n712\n00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.160\nwe're gonna talk about why here\nas we get into this method.\n\n713\n00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.540\nBut as a general rule of thumb, cuz\nreally the end point of that question is,\n\n714\n00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.930\nall right, so what's the best practice?\n\n715\n00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.070\nWhat do we, what should we do,\nwhat do we really do?\n\n716\n00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:49.670\nWe know that Heartbeat Discoveries turn\non once, turn on rather by default, and\n\n717\n00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.330\nruns once a week.\n\n718\n00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.140\nSo that's good, we leave that alone,\nwe don't ever touch that.\n\n719\n00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.080\nWhat you tend to do in the beginning is\nset up discovery on the active directory,\n\n720\n00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.020\nso you're gonna use a combination\nof either the System Discovery and,\n\n721\n00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.952\nperhaps, the Forest Discovery because we\nwant to set up our boundaries and probably\n\n722\n00:33:04.952 --> 00:33:08.900\nauto-populate our sites and our IP rating,\nso we're gonna probably run that.\n\n723\n00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.602\nBut that discovery method has to run for\nmaybe 30 minutes and it's done, and\n\n724\n00:33:12.602 --> 00:33:16.190\nyou don't have to leave it on very long\nbecause the reality is you turn it on,\n\n725\n00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.459\nyou let it do it's thing,\nand then it's done.\n\n726\n00:33:18.459 --> 00:33:22.300\nSo take that once-a-week timeline there\nand drop that down to once an hour, and\n\n727\n00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.631\nthen let it run for an hour, and\nthen just turn it off because then it's\n\n728\n00:33:25.631 --> 00:33:29.605\nprobably populated everything you need and\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n729\n00:33:29.605 --> 00:33:34.082\nSo you would turn on Active Directory\nForest Discovery, let that run,\n\n730\n00:33:34.082 --> 00:33:39.240\nget that auto discovery done, and then you\ndon't have run that again for a while.\n\n731\n00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.140\nYou can just then set that\nback to run once a week.\n\n732\n00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.360\nAnd you know if these things\nkick off once a week and\n\n733\n00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.790\njust run for small period of time,\nit's no big deal.\n\n734\n00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.820\nThey don't generate a lot\nof traffic at that point.\n\n735\n00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.750\nIt's when we run them all at\nthe same time, all at once up front,\n\n736\n00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.990\nthat we tend to have issues.\n\n737\n00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.680\nSo if we incrementally turn them on, let\nthem run, and then put them back to hey,\n\n738\n00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.590\nlet's just run normally, we're fine.\n\n739\n00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:01.410\nSo we typically do Active Directory Forest\nDiscovery to populate the boundaries.\n\n740\n00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.540\nThen we typically do System Discovery\nto get all the computers in so\n\n741\n00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.960\nthat we can actually find them and\npopulate them in the device collections.\n\n742\n00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.540\nThen we either do Group or User Discovery\nto bring in the groups and users.\n\n743\n00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.530\nAnd I would stagger those.\n\n744\n00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.970\nI would do System Discovery.\n\n745\n00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:16.670\nLet that run for\nyou know maybe 24, 48 hours.\n\n746\n00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.540\nGive that a little time to populate.\n\n747\n00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.480\nThen come back to User and\nGroup Discovery.\n\n748\n00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.230\nLet that run for 24 to 48 hours.\n\n749\n00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.320\nMake sure that's good.\n\n750\n00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.430\nThen I would go ahead and\nI would turn on Network Discovery.\n\n751\n00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:28.960\nNow Network Discovery is a special animal.\n\n752\n00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.590\nWe have to really talk about how to\ncontrol this and what's going on with\n\n753\n00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.990\nthis, so let's talk about our options\nhere, talk about what we have.\n\n754\n00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:36.030\nWe're gonna zoom in real quick.\n\n755\n00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:37.570\nAnd we've got a lot going on, by the way,\n\n756\n00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.510\nif you look at all\nthe tabs up the top there.\n\n757\n00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.280\nWe've got General, we've got Subnets,\n\n758\n00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.500\nwe've got Domains, SNMP,\nSNMP devices, DHCP, and Schedule.\n\n759\n00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:51.077\nThe Network Discovery solution is gonna\nrun based on using SNMP to be able to find\n\n760\n00:34:51.077 --> 00:34:52.182\nnetwork devices.\n\n761\n00:34:52.182 --> 00:34:54.661\nWhat we're doing is we're going out and\nlooking for\n\n762\n00:34:54.661 --> 00:34:58.438\ndevices that are not going to be\nnecessarily Microsoft-friendly end points,\n\n763\n00:34:58.438 --> 00:35:02.294\nmeaning we're not looking at Windows 7\nwork stations and Server 12 servers.\n\n764\n00:35:02.294 --> 00:35:06.386\nWe're looking at potentially\nthe idea that we may have switches,\n\n765\n00:35:06.386 --> 00:35:11.353\nmay have routers, may have other devices\nout there, Linux and Unix systems that\n\n766\n00:35:11.353 --> 00:35:16.830\nare not gonna be able to run client agents\nbut are still gonna need to be discovered.\n\n767\n00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:20.460\nAnything that uses SNMP or\nis registered with DHCP and\n\n768\n00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.710\nhas a resource record,\na host record in DHCP, can be pulled in.\n\n769\n00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.817\nSo a lot of our infrastructure\nthat is non-Microsoft and\n\n770\n00:35:27.817 --> 00:35:31.110\nis hardware-based can still be discovered,\nbecause to get a complete,\n\n771\n00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:36.070\naccurate assessment of all the resources\nand all the assets to manage them,\n\n772\n00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:39.200\nwe're gonna wanna have those assets\nthat switches those routers and\n\n773\n00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.792\nthose non-Microsoft machines\nrunning in the inventory.\n\n774\n00:35:42.792 --> 00:35:44.320\nWe wanna be able to tell what's out there.\n\n775\n00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.781\nSo this is gonna help us to do that.\n\n776\n00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:47.569\nSo we can enable Network Discovery,\n\n777\n00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:51.377\nwe can do a Topology-based Discovery\nby discovering IP subnets and routers,\n\n778\n00:35:51.377 --> 00:35:55.494\nit's dependent on the number of HOPs that\nwe go through, that's the max hop count.\n\n779\n00:35:55.494 --> 00:36:01.310\nWe could do Topology and client, we could\ndo Topology, client, and operating system.\n\n780\n00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:03.340\nSo we can actually discover\nin different grades.\n\n781\n00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.350\nNow the more we do in terms\nof stepping down that list,\n\n782\n00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.515\nthe more intensive the discovery,\nthe more traffic we generate,\n\n783\n00:36:09.515 --> 00:36:13.440\nthe longer it takes, the more time it\ntakes, so we have to be aware of that.\n\n784\n00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.600\nNotice we have a little opt-out item\ndown here, where it says Network speed.\n\n785\n00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.840\nJust zoom in just a little bit there for\nthat and,\n\n786\n00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.800\nof course,\nthat was the opposite of zooming in.\n\n787\n00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.640\nIt says slow network and what we can\nsee is make automatic adjustments for\n\n788\n00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.520\nnetworks that have low bandwidth,\nand effectively what that does is,\n\n789\n00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:38.320\nit will double the SNMP time-out value and\nreduce the number of sessions, so that way\n\n790\n00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.910\nwe're not actually going to be, I love the\ncounter-intuitive zoom that we're using.\n\n791\n00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:45.770\nNo, you shouldn't go backwards or\nforwards to zoom,\n\n792\n00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:49.050\nyou should do a combination of them\nboth to figure out which way to go.\n\n793\n00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:53.660\nSo it allows us effectively then to be\nable to compensate for slow networks or\n\n794\n00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.350\nlatency and low bandwidth conditions and\nnot overwhelm the system.\n\n795\n00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:00.630\nThe one thing you can do to really screw\nthings up is to turn on a full-blown\n\n796\n00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.700\nNetwork Discovery and\n\n797\n00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.230\njust let it run and then pile\nthe other discovery mechanisms on top.\n\n798\n00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.410\nThat can actually prove to be\na challenge for us, so we do,\n\n799\n00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.610\nwe do wanna be aware of that.\n\n800\n00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.432\nSo, we would enable this, right?\n\n801\n00:37:11.432 --> 00:37:12.510\nSo we'll check that off.\n\n802\n00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.100\nWe can then go to the Subnets area,\n\n803\n00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.740\nand you'll see we can add in\nSubnets that we wanna search.\n\n804\n00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.950\nSo we can go ahead and\nadd in one or more Subnets.\n\n805\n00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.250\nIf we already know what they are,\nwe would just go over,\n\n806\n00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.090\nhit the little asterisk at the upper\nright-hand corner there, add in one or\n\n807\n00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.210\nmore IP Subnets that we wanna search.\n\n808\n00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.960\nWe can go ahead and\nwe can go to the Domain tab and\n\n809\n00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.040\nwe can add domains in the same way.\n\n810\n00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.600\nWe can go to SNMP and on SNMP we\ncan put in our community strings.\n\n811\n00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.540\nYou'll see we have public there\nwhich is the standard open one for\n\n812\n00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.690\nanything that's gonna\nto be available to us.\n\n813\n00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.880\nWe could put private in, which is the\nstandard default for private SNMP devices,\n\n814\n00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.310\nbut we obviously then would\nhopefully be a little bit smarter.\n\n815\n00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.070\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> From a security\nstandpoint, not just be using those two.\n\n816\n00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:55.937\nWanna use something like Tsunami, or\nsomething like that, like Cisco uses, or\n\n817\n00:37:55.937 --> 00:37:56.900\nnot anymore.\n\n818\n00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.090\nSo to SNMP devices,\nwe can add in IP addresses for those.\n\n819\n00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.650\nSo, in other words, we can specify\nranges that we wanna go out and probe.\n\n820\n00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:09.860\nWe can go to DHCP, and through DHCP we\ncan actually add in DHCP server ranges,\n\n821\n00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.910\nand we can query the DHCP servers that\nare running Microsoft DHCP Servers.\n\n822\n00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:18.080\nNotice it does say specifically,\nMicrosoft's implementation of DHCP.\n\n823\n00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.910\nNow we do support non-Microsoft DHCP\nservers, they're called BIND servers.\n\n824\n00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:27.020\nWe do support them for general use in\nMicrosoft networks to do DHCP addressing,\n\n825\n00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.830\nthat's not a problem, but\nSystems Center ConfigMgr cannot\n\n826\n00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:34.400\nquery non-Microsoft DHCP\nservers to do discovery.\n\n827\n00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.030\nCan only query Microsoft DHCP servers.\n\n828\n00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:40.556\nSo while we may be using\nnon-Microsoft DNS, excuse me,\n\n829\n00:38:40.556 --> 00:38:43.200\nnon-Microsoft DHCP architecture.\n\n830\n00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.150\nDid I say DNS and by,\nI meant, stupid [CROSSTALK].\n\n831\n00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.855\nTell me when I do\nsomething stupid like that.\n\n832\n00:38:48.855 --> 00:38:51.590\nNon-Microsoft DNS servers\nare BIND servers.\n\n833\n00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:55.200\nWe also do support the use of\nnon-Microsoft DHCP servers, and those\n\n834\n00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.100\nare not called BIND servers, they are just\ncalled non-Microsoft DHCP servers.\n\n835\n00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.400\nBut we can't query them is the problem.\n\n836\n00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.350\nWe don't have the ability to get\nthe resource records out of them\n\n837\n00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:07.660\nbecause we're not able to effectively get\nthem, we don't speak the same language.\n\n838\n00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.910\nSo we just have to be aware\nof that because remember,\n\n839\n00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:15.120\nDHCP servers are to be used with Microsoft\ntoday that are in the active directory,\n\n840\n00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.980\nare gonna be authorized for use in the\nactive directory and we create a special\n\n841\n00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:23.050\nresource record for them and\nwe tie that to the computer registration.\n\n842\n00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:26.040\nWe can't do that with non-Microsoft\nservers, that's one of the problems, so\n\n843\n00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.310\nas a result of that we don't\nhave any way of querying them.\n\n844\n00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.967\nSo that's just something to consider and\nto be aware with DHCP.\n\n845\n00:39:30.967 --> 00:39:35.789\nAnd then with Schedule,\nwe have our ability to go in and specify,\n\n846\n00:39:35.789 --> 00:39:40.098\nlet me just actually add in here so\nwe that before I zoom in.\n\n847\n00:39:40.098 --> 00:39:43.456\nWe have the ability to go in and to\nspecify what our schedule's gonna be for\n\n848\n00:39:43.456 --> 00:39:44.061\ndiscovery.\n\n849\n00:39:44.061 --> 00:39:47.930\nSo we can go in and\nyou can see we do a custom schedule there.\n\n850\n00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:50.270\nHow long we want it to run for,\nhow many hours?\n\n851\n00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.220\nLike I said,\nhow long do we want it to run for?\n\n852\n00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.930\nAnd notice we do then the recurrence,\nnone, weekly, monthly, custom interval,\n\n853\n00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.780\nevery day or something like that.\n\n854\n00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.761\nSo we can specify how this is gonna run,\nwhen it's gonna run and for\n\n855\n00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:02.621\nhow long, right?\n\n856\n00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:05.280\nSo we can go in and\ndo all that if we need to.\n\n857\n00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.400\nSo these are all of our discovery methods.\n\n858\n00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.480\nAnd we will program in one or more of them\nand set them up just based on what it is\n\n859\n00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.920\nwe're looking to do and kind of\nthe thought processes associated with it.\n\n860\n00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.780\nNow once we've done one or\nmore of these discovery methods and\n\n861\n00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.070\nwe have used the infrastructure\nthat's gonna drive this,\n\n862\n00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.590\nwe're probably gonna\nhave some log entries.\n\n863\n00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:28.090\nIf you remember in some of the prior\nepisodes we took a look at set up.\n\n864\n00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.110\nWe went in, we took a look at the logs.\n\n865\n00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.940\nThere were 73 logs in the log folder.\n\n866\n00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.990\nAnd you said wow, are all those\ngonna be there immediately, and\n\n867\n00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.900\nI said no, not all of them.\n\n868\n00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.290\nSo a lot of them are gonna be generated\nonce we start doing stuff, right?\n\n869\n00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.990\nAnd so discovery's gonna generate a lot\nof log entries, and I know we have a nice\n\n870\n00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.880\nlittle table that we have put up that\nwe're gonna be able to take a look at\n\n871\n00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.240\nwhere all the logs, at least listing the\nlogs that are gonna be used for discovery.\n\n872\n00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.130\nSo what do I wanna take a look,\nsee that up there,\n\n873\n00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.038\nand you could see that we have\nthe component name on the left.\n\n874\n00:40:53.038 --> 00:40:57.580\nFor instance\nSMS_AD_FOREST_DISCOVERY_MANAGER,\n\n875\n00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.830\nthat's the one is used for\nthe Forest Discovery Method.\n\n876\n00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.630\nAnd we have a log associated with that.\n\n877\n00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:03.395\nADForest.\n\n878\n00:41:03.395 --> 00:41:06.015\nD-I-S-C or discovery, short for discovery.\n\n879\n00:41:06.015 --> 00:41:08.390\nADForestDisc.log.\n\n880\n00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.650\nAnd you can walk down that list and\nsee all of them there.\n\n881\n00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.080\nWe have Network Discovery.\n\n882\n00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.660\nWe have WINNT Server Discovery Agent.\n\n883\n00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.470\nNot only interesting that we use\nSMS as the header for all these,\n\n884\n00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:21.160\nremember we talked about the use of\nSMS but notice we're using WINNT.\n\n885\n00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.307\nAs opposed to anything else.\n\n886\n00:41:22.307 --> 00:41:25.610\nSo, yeah we see some old system references\nkinda poking their heads up there.\n\n887\n00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:30.500\nSo we have AD user, AD System Discovery,\nDiscovery Data Manager, etc.\n\n888\n00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.510\nNow if I was you, and\nyou were preparing for the exam,\n\n889\n00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:40.190\nI would wanna make sure that I am\nfamiliar with the seven logs and\n\n890\n00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.350\nthe seven component names that go with\nthe logs that are on this screen.\n\n891\n00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:44.430\nThis is important stuff.\n\n892\n00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.759\nYou would wanna associate the idea of the\nFOREST_DISCOVERY_MANAGER having a log and\n\n893\n00:41:48.759 --> 00:41:50.782\nknowing it's the ADForestDisc.log.\n\n894\n00:41:50.782 --> 00:41:51.885\nYou'd wanna know that.\n\n895\n00:41:51.885 --> 00:41:55.639\nSo I would make sure you just take\na moment, kinda capture that information,\n\n896\n00:41:55.639 --> 00:41:57.470\nmake sure it's fresh in your mind.\n\n897\n00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.220\nYou have a sense of that, because that's\ngonna be valuable information for you.\n\n898\n00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.310\nWe also have a couple of PowerShell\ncommandlets that are valuable for us, so\n\n899\n00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.000\nwe wanna take a look at.\n\n900\n00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:06.690\nThere we go.\n\n901\n00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.011\nThe value of being able to slide up,\ndown, and sideways.\n\n902\n00:42:09.011 --> 00:42:10.010\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n903\n00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.228\n>> As I was saying with my scroll thing.\n\n904\n00:42:11.228 --> 00:42:14.593\nSo these commandlets in particular,\nSet-CMDiscoveryMethod,\n\n905\n00:42:14.593 --> 00:42:17.716\nGet-CMDiscoveryMethod These\nare gonna allow us to be able to\n\n906\n00:42:17.716 --> 00:42:19.640\nautomate the discovery process.\n\n907\n00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.240\nYou have talked a lot about PowerShell,\n\n908\n00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.668\ntalked a lot about the fact we\nhave those 470 or so commandlets.\n\n909\n00:42:24.668 --> 00:42:27.736\nAnd we tried to preview a few of them\nin most of our discussions for you,\n\n910\n00:42:27.736 --> 00:42:30.604\njust to get them out there,\nnumber one, but also to focus you in.\n\n911\n00:42:30.604 --> 00:42:34.180\nIn some cases, on ones that would\nbe valuable for you to know.\n\n912\n00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:37.130\nSo you probably wanna make sure you're\nfamiliar with these two as well,\n\n913\n00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.820\nwould be good to know.\n\n914\n00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.728\nAnd then we have the ability to go and\nknow we'll be good with that.\n\n915\n00:42:41.728 --> 00:42:45.501\nWe have the ability to be able to use\nthese to be able to automate discovery.\n\n916\n00:42:45.501 --> 00:42:47.329\nWe can also obviously parse log files and\n\n917\n00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:49.332\ndo all sorts of stuff\nwith the CM trace tool.\n\n918\n00:42:49.332 --> 00:42:52.328\nWe talked about CM trace tool, if you\nremember, looking at those log files.\n\n919\n00:42:52.328 --> 00:42:56.006\nSo we just wanna be aware of that and\nmake sure we're obviously thinking about\n\n920\n00:42:56.006 --> 00:43:00.080\nthat as part of our general\nconversation and thought process, okay?\n\n921\n00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:00.694\n>> All right.\n\n922\n00:43:00.694 --> 00:43:05.522\nWell, Adam, again another great episode\nthere looking at the discovery methods,\n\n923\n00:43:05.522 --> 00:43:09.480\nthe next logical step as we setup\nour SCCM 2012 R2 environment.\n\n924\n00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.689\nThank you for that.\n\n925\n00:43:10.689 --> 00:43:11.580\nGreat.\nLoved it.\n\n926\n00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:12.784\nHope you guys loved it as much as did.\n\n927\n00:43:12.784 --> 00:43:16.083\nAnd remember if you wanna sit\nin one of Adam's classes live,\n\n928\n00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:18.681\nshoot us an email here\nat SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n929\n00:43:18.681 -->

--> 00:00:17.250\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.130\nToday we're talking about system\ncenter configuration manager 2012 R2.\n\n5\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.720\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at collections and roles.\n\n6\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.720\nYou know in the previous episode\nwe looked at discovery, right?\n\n7\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.600\nWe talked about different\ndiscovery methods.\n\n8\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.360\nHow we can go out and\n\n9\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.580\nfind the different resources on our\nnetwork that we can manage through SCCM.\n\n10\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.100\nBut you know how do we go\nabout actually managing them?\n\n11\n00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.970\nCollections I believe are where\nwe're going to go with that.\n\n12\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.190\nBut here to make sure that I'm right,\n\n13\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.770\nto tell us if I'm wrong\nis Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.790\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n15\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.450\n>> Good, good.\n\n16\n00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.260\nMIke is, we'll give him a gold star\na green check for that one, he is right.\n\n17\n00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.300\nWe are going to use collection and\nwe are going to talk about collections.\n\n18\n00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.020\nKind of carry on with our conversations\nwith regards to discovery methods as Mike\n\n19\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.300\nwas pointing out for us.\n\n20\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.280\nThe next logical step in our\njourney is gonna be figuring out,\n\n21\n00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.780\nnow that we found or\ndiscovered what resources we have,\n\n22\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.520\nhow we're gonna manage them\nbecome the central focal point.\n\n23\n00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.950\nNow, what we're gonna do is build\non that discovery methodology.\n\n24\n00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.300\nWe hopefully have machines, we have users,\n\n25\n00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.070\ngroups, most likely\na combination of those things.\n\n26\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.380\nWe've already got our site boundaries\nwe've talked about those and\n\n27\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.530\nhow to configure those.\n\n28\n00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.900\nWe've got one or more site systems\nwith rolls associated with them.\n\n29\n00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.050\nWe've done all this stuff now what\nwe're going to do, and going to\n\n30\n00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.570\nshow you how to do most importantly is go\nthrough and start setting up collections.\n\n31\n00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.490\nCollections are going to used, and\n\n32\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.580\nyou can think of collections\ncollectively like OU containers.\n\n33\n00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.760\nWhen we think about the Active Directory\nwe've talked a lot about this, and\n\n34\n00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.780\nthe linkage to AD with regards to\nsystem center being able to leverage\n\n35\n00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.750\nthe Active Directory to do discovery.\n\n36\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.230\nYou saw that of the six discovery methods,\n\n37\n00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.050\nwe have four of them specifying\nActive Directory in one form or another.\n\n38\n00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.910\nSo we're relying heavily on\nthe directory service integration.\n\n39\n00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.180\nWe could think of collections to,\nit would be very similar,\n\n40\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.710\nalmost akin to or aligned with the concept\nof EOU in the Active Directory.\n\n41\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.410\nThe idea that it's container that helps us\nto organize logically and manage objects.\n\n42\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.305\nAnd that's exactly what collections do\ninside system center config manager.\n\n43\n00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:12.075\nThey allow us to organize\nthe user objects and or\n\n44\n00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:15.310\nthe groups of user objects,\nas well as the device objects.\n\n45\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.245\nIE they are going to be\nthe computers that we find,\n\n46\n00:02:18.245 --> 00:02:19.740\nor the end points that we're managing.\n\n47\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.200\nWe're going to talk about\nhow to create one or\n\n48\n00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.440\nmore collections I'll do a quick\ndemo of the user collection as\n\n49\n00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.870\nwell as a quick demo of how to\ncreate a computer collection.\n\n50\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.250\nThere are some small\ndifferences between the two.\n\n51\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.830\nOne of the key things we'll focus on is\nthe ability to have maintenance windows\n\n52\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.290\nassociated with computer collections.\n\n53\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.890\nSpeaker 1: And to specify whether or\nnot we're going to do a deployment and\n\n54\n00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.480\nif so during what time period.\n\n55\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.710\nSo that we can hard code\nthat deployment and\n\n56\n00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.730\nallow it to occur in alignment\nwith our change benefit processes.\n\n57\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.760\nSo, obviously it's going\nto be very important and\n\n58\n00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.240\nas Mike would say, very exciting.\n\n59\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.460\n>> Yes.\n\n60\n00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.860\n>> Say exciting, right yes exciting.\n\n61\n00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.010\n>> Yes, exciting.\n\n62\n00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.680\n>> There you see, smile and exciting.\n\n63\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.240\nSo we're going to do that and we're\ngoing to take a look at how that works.\n\n64\n00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.910\nWe're also,\nThis part of the conversation here.\n\n65\n00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.940\nBecause correct me if I'm wrong, but\nI did hear you say collections and roles.\n\n66\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.320\n>> I did.\n>> You did say roles.\n\n67\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.450\n>> I did.\n>> We are going to talk about\n\n68\n00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.430\nroles as well.\n\n69\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.110\nAnd roles is just shorthand in SSCM for\nsecurity.\n\n70\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.700\nWhat we're going to talk about a little\nbit is the whole concept of security,\n\n71\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.740\nhow do we deal with user delegation, in\na sense being able to delegate a role and\n\n72\n00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.740\nresponsibility for\nsomebody to be able to do their job.\n\n73\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.970\nWe can make Mike, for instance,\na full administrator in SCCM, but\n\n74\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.580\nwe may just want to constrain Mike and\nmake him responsible, hypothetically,\n\n75\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.880\nlet's say, for reporting.\n\n76\n00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.780\nOr perhaps, hypothetically, responsible\nfor application or software deployment.\n\n77\n00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.010\nAnd we can assign Mike a role or\neffectively put Mike into a group,\n\n78\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.130\nif you want to think of it this way,\nalthough roles are not really groups, but\n\n79\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.490\nthey operate similarly.\n\n80\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.370\nA role is a predefined set of permissions\nand tasks that are then going to be given\n\n81\n00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.430\nto a user, and\nallow that user to carry out their job.\n\n82\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.760\nAnd straining the user's permissions or\nthe user's abilities along the way.\n\n83\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.630\nSo we're going to take a look at that\nwhole area inside the administration work\n\n84\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.360\nspace.\n\n85\n00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.610\nWe'll talk about what security and\nthe roles equals.\n\n86\n00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.390\nAnd how that's going to affect ultimately.\n\n87\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.680\nAnd remember planning is so\ncritical to being successful.\n\n88\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.690\nHow that's going to affect our\nthought process With regards to what\n\n89\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.710\nwe're gonna plan to do versus\nwhat happens out of the box.\n\n90\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.540\nBecause out of the box we have a User\nAccount that basically is given full\n\n91\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.550\nrights to everything.\n\n92\n00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.010\nThat's fine as long as that User Account\nis the only account that logs in and\n\n93\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.675\nadministers.\n\n94\n00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:16.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But chances are good if you\n\n95\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.560\nhave more than one user that's\na member of the IT team,\n\n96\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.940\nyou may actually have multiple\nusers that have to get in to STCM.\n\n97\n00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.610\nSo now we have to worry about either\nhaving them all use one account and\n\n98\n00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.767\nhaving rights to everything, which is\nusually, how can I put this bluntly and\n\n99\n00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:31.200\nnicely without being insulting.\n\n100\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.938\n>> I don't think you can.\n\n101\n00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:32.512\n>> A really bad idea.\n\n102\n00:04:32.512 --> 00:04:34.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we don't wanna do that,\n\n103\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.950\nbecause then what will happen is,\nunfortunately, somebody will\n\n104\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.610\nmost likely make a mistake and or\ndo something that they didn't mean to do.\n\n105\n00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.960\nIt's not often that people go ahead and\ndo this on purpose.\n\n106\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.020\nBut what will happen is,\n\n107\n00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.730\nthey will probably do something without\nrealizing that it's a bad idea.\n\n108\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.490\nAnd because of that,\nthey will most likely cause us concern and\n\n109\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.090\nprobably damage the installation in\na way that's then gonna cause us to\n\n110\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.610\nnot be able to use it properly at\nleast now without a mediation.\n\n111\n00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.440\nSo what we're gonna instead is\ndelegate responsibility for\n\n112\n00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.180\ncertain key roles, a down if you will and\ngive you just constraint abilities or\n\n113\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.610\nto talk about why that's important.\n\n114\n00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.200\nWell supportively we gonna talk\nabout planning to do that And\n\n115\n00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.570\nwhat the default roles are and\nhow to utilize them.\n\n116\n00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.440\nDo we know how many default roles we have?\n\n117\n00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.910\n>> I'm gonna say more than 12.\n\n118\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.668\n>> Just wow.\n\n119\n00:05:17.668 --> 00:05:18.718\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [SOUND] I am amazed.\n\n120\n00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:23.080\nI am going to have to stop and\ntake a private moment, I wow.\n\n121\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.090\nI just don't know what to say.\n\n122\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.870\nYou are absolutely right, more than 12.\n\n123\n00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.560\nWe actually have 15 by the way and\nso we'll talk about what those are.\n\n124\n00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.490\nIf I remember correctly,\n\n125\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.020\nwe do have a nice little screen capture-\n>> We do.\n\n126\n00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.580\n>> Of those roles I'm gonna\nshow everybody as well.\n\n127\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.780\nWe'll do that at some point.\n\n128\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.950\nAll right, very good, so let's if we can\njoin me in the demo studio as we say.\n\n129\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.960\nLet's transition over and pow there we go.\n\n130\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.510\nI want to be like Emeril.\n\n131\n00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.040\nBam.\n>> Bam.\n\n132\n00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.790\n>> There it is right there.\n\n133\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.300\nI gotta come up with my own,\n\n134\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.780\ninstead of bam I've gotta come up\nwith something, whatever that is.\n\n135\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.330\n>> Shazam.\n\n136\n00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.410\n>> Shazam.\nShazbot.\n\n137\n00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.340\nRemember Mork and Mindy, remember that?\n\n138\n00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.540\nThat's one right there.\n\n139\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.820\nFor those of you who have no\nidea what I'm talking about.\n\n140\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.120\noh well.\nWhat can I tell you?\n\n141\n00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So we're going to go ahead and\n\n142\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.420\nget into taking a look at collections.\n\n143\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.030\nSo what I've done is I've opened.\n\n144\n00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.860\nI was going to say upended.\n\n145\n00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.200\nI opened the console so\nwe just have it available for us already.\n\n146\n00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.840\nAnd let's just take a quick\nlook at where we are in here.\n\n147\n00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.910\nWe are in the administration workspace.\n\n148\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.280\nAs you can see down here.\n\n149\n00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.150\nExcuse me.\nPardon me.\n\n150\n00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.370\nNot an administration workspace.\n\n151\n00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.590\nWe are in assets and compliance.\n\n152\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.790\nWe're talking about collections.\n\n153\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.700\nI'm thinking security and\nstill stuck on roles,\n\n154\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.180\nwhich would be\nthe administration workspace.\n\n155\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.730\nSo we're in the assets and\ncompliance workspace and\n\n156\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.160\nyou'll see we have chosen\nthe user collection.\n\n157\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.430\nOff to the left and then off to the right,\nyou can see we have that highlighted.\n\n158\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.800\nAnd we have the user\ncollections that are here.\n\n159\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.640\nThese are part of the built in\ncollections that are there by default.\n\n160\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.390\nIn other words, as we setup and operate\nthe system all user groups, all users,\n\n161\n00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.620\nall users and user groups, these\nare the three built in user collections\n\n162\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.470\nthat are available to us out of the box.\n\n163\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.170\nWe're going to go ahead and\ncreate our own, but we have these three.\n\n164\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.830\nNow on the system's side we have some\ndevice collections that are there by\n\n165\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.930\ndefault as well.\n\n166\n00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.440\nWe'll take a look at what those are in\na minute when we do the device collection\n\n167\n00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.210\ndemo and we'll just make sure\nyou're familiar with what they are.\n\n168\n00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.040\nWouldn't be a bad Idea for you to know\nthat we have built-in collections.\n\n169\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.540\nWould I spend a huge amount of time\nas I'm preparing for the exam?\n\n170\n00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.250\nMemorizing, we don't ever say memorize,\nwe say learn with feeling and with effort.\n\n171\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.890\nDo we wanna learn with\nfeeling with effort?\n\n172\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.719\nDo we wanna know what those built-in\nuser and or device collections are?\n\n173\n00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.590\nIt's not a bad idea to know they're there.\n\n174\n00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.020\nThe reality is if you ever ask,\nyou can probably reason through and\n\n175\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.820\nfigure out what they are.\n\n176\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.710\nThe secret is that most of them\nare gonna start with the word all.\n\n177\n00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.560\nAnd as a result of that it's usually not\ntoo hard to figure out what they are.\n\n178\n00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.290\nSo we're not gonna spend\na lot of time on that.\n\n179\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.820\nBut we do want you te be aware\nthe fact that they are there.\n\n180\n00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.850\nSo what we're gonna do is go ahead and I'm\ngonna right-click on User Collections and\n\n181\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.050\nI'm just gonna go ahead and I am gonna\nchoose the Create User Collection option.\n\n182\n00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.480\nIt's also at the upper\nleft on the ribbon there.\n\n183\n00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.590\nWe can see that right there, so\nwe can see what we're doing, so\n\n184\n00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.230\nthat you can understand\nwhat we're about to do.\n\n185\n00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.100\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n186\n00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.200\nclick on that and just launch\nthe create user collection wizard.\n\n187\n00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.125\nAnd let's just scroll down a little area,\na little bit there so we can see.\n\n188\n00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:58.145\nWe have to give our\nuser collection a name.\n\n189\n00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:01.857\nNow, this is important, a sense that you\nknow we may only have two or three or\n\n190\n00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:02.844\nfour collections.\n\n191\n00:08:02.844 --> 00:08:04.818\nBut I have customers that\nhave hundreds of collections.\n\n192\n00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:05.445\n>> Wow.\n\n193\n00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:10.093\n>> Because they have very large\ninfrastructure, and they are managing it\n\n194\n00:08:10.093 --> 00:08:15.700\neither with a geography focus, based on,\nlet's say, building and location.\n\n195\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.830\nSo some of my big healthcare clients,\nfor instance,\n\n196\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.770\nare doing this based on the hospitals they\nown, or clinics, or things like that.\n\n197\n00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.050\nSo you can create these collections and\nhave them do a variety of things.\n\n198\n00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.110\nWe're gonna talk about that in relation to\nthe rules that we use to be able to drive\n\n199\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.400\nthe collection creation,\nbecause collections are just containers.\n\n200\n00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.690\nThe secret to collections are the rules\nthat we use to actually populate them.\n\n201\n00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.810\nAnd there's four types of\nrules that we can use.\n\n202\n00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.420\nWe can use what's called a direct rule,\nand\n\n203\n00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.200\nI'm gonna show you these in\nthe interface here in a second.\n\n204\n00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.030\nBut we can have what's called a direct\nrule, a rule that effectively\n\n205\n00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.590\nallows us to select, specifically,\nhighlight the exact users,\n\n206\n00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.540\nor in the case of computers,\nwhat computers we wanna put in.\n\n207\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.480\nWe can use what's called a query rule.\n\n208\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.950\nA query rule is going to allow us to\neffectively create a dynamic solution,\n\n209\n00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.900\nrun a query against whatever\nthe database we're gonna pull from.\n\n210\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.500\nIn this case, the active directory.\n\n211\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.570\nUsers and or active directory.\n\n212\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:06.830\nComputers areas.\n\n213\n00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.780\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n214\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.360\nif there's ever an update to that,\nwhen we run the membership rule, we then\n\n215\n00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.620\neffectively are updating the collection\nmembership, because the query is dynamic.\n\n216\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.350\nIt populates every time it runs.\n\n217\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.640\nSo we actually can keep that going,\nand keep that updated in real time\n\n218\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.060\nby using the query role,\nwhich is actually kind of cool.\n\n219\n00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:26.150\nSo we can do that, that's gonna be\na little bit more involved in a sense.\n\n220\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.430\nWe have to write out the query language,\n\n221\n00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.440\nand we'll at least talk\nabout what that looks like.\n\n222\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.840\nWe're gonna talk about queries\nin another episode overall.\n\n223\n00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.513\nAnd so we'll take a look at\nqueries in more depth there, but\n\n224\n00:09:34.513 --> 00:09:38.310\nI'll at least preview that, and\njust give you a sense of that.\n\n225\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.100\nIn addition to the query rule and\nthe direct rule,\n\n226\n00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.940\nwe also have an include collections\nrule or an exclude collections rule.\n\n227\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.050\nAnd the idea is that, as the name implies,\nwith include collections rule,\n\n228\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.840\nwe are effectively including these\nparticular things in the collection.\n\n229\n00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.235\nWith an exclude rule we're gonna\neffectively exclude them from\n\n230\n00:09:54.235 --> 00:09:55.240\nthe collection.\n\n231\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.595\nSo we're able to go in and purposely\nselect, using a direct rule dynamically,\n\n232\n00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:03.690\nusing a direct rule and or the query\nrule dynamically, and then include and\n\n233\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.350\nexclude allows us to include or\nexclude from other collections.\n\n234\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.260\nSo it's actually gonna be valuable for\nus to know that.\n\n235\n00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.410\nSo let's go back and we'll take a look,\nI'm gonna zoom in here.\n\n236\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.050\nLet me just go ahead and\ngive this a name, so I'm gonna call this,\n\n237\n00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.840\njust like we've been doing, and\ntype there so I can do that.\n\n238\n00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.180\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna call that,\n\n239\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.620\noh that's our change focus, one second,\nwe have to change focus and change back.\n\n240\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.880\nWouldn't be a good demo if we didn't\nhave to do that at least once.\n\n241\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.110\n>> Right.\n>> So, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n242\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.300\ndo that, and\njust let me get back to our desktop.\n\n243\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.660\nThere we go.\n\n244\n00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:40.270\nAnd we scroll over there, and\nlet's just call that Test User Collection,\n\n245\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.620\nand I'm just gonna put the number one on\nthe end, just so that we know what it is.\n\n246\n00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.700\nBut we can name it anything we would like.\n\n247\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.000\nThat's just going to be the name that\nwe're going to use to keep track of it.\n\n248\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.520\nStandard naming convention\nthought processes apply here.\n\n249\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.050\nYou'll plan for\nhaving multiple collections.\n\n250\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.720\nName them something meaningful.\n\n251\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.370\nWhatever that is in your world.\n\n252\n00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.365\nSo I mentioned some of my clients\nare doing this based on geography,\n\n253\n00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:01.065\nothers are doing it based on function.\n\n254\n00:11:01.065 --> 00:11:04.615\nIf you wanna call it Windows Server 12 for\nthe device collection, and\n\n255\n00:11:04.615 --> 00:11:06.155\nthat's all your Server 12 machines,\n\n256\n00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:09.975\nthat makes a lot of sense, cuz we know\nthose members are Server 12 machines.\n\n257\n00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:14.475\nBut then don't go do something stupid like\nputting Linux boxes or Windows Server 2008\n\n258\n00:11:14.475 --> 00:11:17.930\nboxes in the Server 12 collection,\notherwise you're gonna have a problem.\n\n259\n00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.220\nSo you got to think through the logic\nof how you're gonna use this, right?\n\n260\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.010\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose a limiting collection.\n\n261\n00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.840\nThe limiting collection is gonna be\nthe collection that we are going to\n\n262\n00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.640\nstart from, and that we're gonna\nbe able to work from there.\n\n263\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.010\nSo in this case, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose all users, and\n\n264\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:34.950\nall user groups.\n\n265\n00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.090\nSo I'm just gonna select\nthat off to the right.\n\n266\n00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.520\nAnd this gives us the broadest possible\napproach in terms of being able pull in\n\n267\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.700\nany users or groups that may exist\nin the system, and then remember, we\n\n268\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.910\nmay choose to narrow that, or dynamically\nmodify that with a membership rule.\n\n269\n00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.330\nThe idea with a limiting collection\nis that effectively you are gonna\n\n270\n00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.880\nselect a collection that allows us to\nestablish the resources in terms of,\n\n271\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.950\nthink of it like a pool.\n\n272\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.670\nA pool of resources we're gonna pull\nfrom initially, and then, based on that,\n\n273\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.420\nwe'll start making selections, additions,\nmodifications, based on rules.\n\n274\n00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.880\nSo the limiting collection is\nnothing more than starting point for\n\n275\n00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.260\nour journey in terms of\npopulating the collection.\n\n276\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.660\nWe normally will go ahead.\n\n277\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.690\nWe use an established collection,\none that's already there for\n\n278\n00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.940\nlimiting purposes.\n\n279\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.660\nWe normally will choose the one that gives\nus the broadest coverage, so all users and\n\n280\n00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.130\ngroups in the user case, in the case of\ndevices, all systems typically, which\n\n281\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.990\ngives us everything, and then from there\nwe can kind of select and narrow down.\n\n282\n00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.760\nSo that's what we're normally going to do.\n\n283\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.310\nSo we've gone ahead and\nwe've done that, and\n\n284\n00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.240\nthen what we are going to do is hit Next\nhere, and we're going to get and I'm going\n\n285\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.790\nto zoom in on the membership rule for you\nbecause this is now where the fun happens.\n\n286\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.560\nLet me just scroll down so\nyou can see that, and\n\n287\n00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.690\nI'll zoom in in just a second, but\nlet me just pull down the add rule area.\n\n288\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.510\nSo that way, there we go,\nyou can see it, and then\n\n289\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:51.170\nyou'll see that we have gone ahead, we've\ngone to the membership rules on the left.\n\n290\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.420\nYou can see that on the selector,\n\n291\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.200\nand you'll see that when I'm about to\nadd a rule, I have the four options\n\n292\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.625\nI mentioned to you, direct rules,\nabout to say memorize them.\n\n293\n00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:00.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't have to memorize,\n\n294\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.340\nI know what they are.\n\n295\n00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.820\nDirect rule, query rule, include\ncollections, and exclude collections,\n\n296\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.790\nthey're all there.\n\n297\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.050\nSo you can see the four of them there,\n\n298\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.710\nwe're obviously gonna choose one of those,\nevery rule, or every choice here is then\n\n299\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.770\ngonna have it's own configuration\nparameters associated with it.\n\n300\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.330\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to do a direct rule.\n\n301\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.270\nSo let me grab that.\n\n302\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.230\nThat wizard screen then changes\ninto a direct membership rule so\n\n303\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.240\neach selection drives a separate\npart of the wizard that\n\n304\n00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.970\nhas its own configuration\nparameters associated with it.\n\n305\n00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.570\nSo we're going to go ahead and click Next.\n\n306\n00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:37.620\nWe then have to in the direct\nrule here go ahead, and we\n\n307\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.660\nare going to be able to choose a Resource\nClass, an Attribute Name, and a Value.\n\n308\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.040\nAnd so let's just zoom in for a second.\n\n309\n00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.650\nLet's just take a look at these.\n\n310\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.490\nAnd so, what you'll see here is\ndirect membership, remember,\n\n311\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.070\nallows us to go in and\nselect exactly what we want, right?\n\n312\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.400\nAnd so when we do use a resource,\n\n313\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.640\nthe resource class is users want\nto be able to choose users.\n\n314\n00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.330\nAttribute name or\nattribute name type is name.\n\n315\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.270\nMeaning we're gonna use user name.\n\n316\n00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.070\nRight now we can pull down, and there's a\nwhole list of options in there that we can\n\n317\n00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:11.420\nuse, we could do, same account name, we\ncould do all the other attributes that may\n\n318\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.650\nbe available for the user resource,\nso we have the option to do that.\n\n319\n00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.798\nAnd then,\nwe have Value down there at the bottom,\n\n320\n00:14:17.798 --> 00:14:21.500\nwhere effectively we would specify what\nit is that we wanna actually match.\n\n321\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.630\nAnd so, if we go in and we pull down,\n\n322\n00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:28.316\nwe can see that we only have two options\nunder Resource Class, User Resource or\n\n323\n00:14:28.316 --> 00:14:32.370\nUser Group Resource, so\nwe can do either the user or the group.\n\n324\n00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:38.450\nAnd then, under Attributes,\nwe have an incredibly long list here,\n\n325\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.430\nas you can see,\nof potential attributes for users.\n\n326\n00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.910\nAgent Name, Agent Site,\nDistinguished Name, Domain,\n\n327\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.840\nFull User Name, all sorts of stuff.\n\n328\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.960\nThese are attributes associated\nwith the user in one form or\n\n329\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.930\nanother that we can pull in.\n\n330\n00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.830\nYou'll see User Name, User OU Name,\nUser Principal Name, there's a lot.\n\n331\n00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.840\nThe SID is there if we\nknew the SID string, for\n\n332\n00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.170\ninstance, could actually pull that in,\nput in in for a single user.\n\n333\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.747\nThat would be very limiting of course,\nbecause the SID is going to be unique,\n\n334\n00:15:03.747 --> 00:15:04.940\nright, but we could do that.\n\n335\n00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.490\nIf it was the RID the Relative ID,\nthen you know it may be broader,\n\n336\n00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.730\nthe relative ID of the group,\nthe domain, right, but\n\n337\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.590\nthe SID would be the unique\nindividual identity for the user.\n\n338\n00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.350\nSo we have those capabilities, right?\n\n339\n00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.640\nWe're going to leave that there and\n\n340\n00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.980\nwe could then type in any unique value,\nright?\n\n341\n00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.690\nAnd so we can go and specify,\nyou know, something like test.\n\n342\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.230\nAnd I'm just really doing this\nas a demo more than I am for\n\n343\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.100\nanything that I want to\nspecifically show you.\n\n344\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.040\nI'm gonna actually do a inclusion rule and\n\n345\n00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.620\njust to use that one\nspecifically to drive this.\n\n346\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.700\nI just wanna demo the different types for\nyou.\n\n347\n00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.340\nSo we would type in the string, and\nthen assuming that we had users that met\n\n348\n00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.130\nthat particular criteria, they would show\nup in the list and I could select them.\n\n349\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:51.341\nSo what I have to know here is I'd have\nto actually have something, right?\n\n350\n00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:54.444\nOn this particular screen\nthat actually matches, right?\n\n351\n00:15:54.444 --> 00:15:59.448\nWhere we say value,\nwe'd have to have a value that matches.\n\n352\n00:15:59.448 --> 00:16:03.084\nA user that already exists in there.\n\n353\n00:16:03.084 --> 00:16:07.400\nThey have to type in the username that\nactually exists in order to do that.\n\n354\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.090\nAnd so,\nwe just want to be aware of that, right?\n\n355\n00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.450\nBecause that obviously gonna limit\nour delimitative make a selection.\n\n356\n00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.230\nSo, this is how we would\ndo a direct membership rule\n\n357\n00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.780\nif we're gonna use direct membership.\n\n358\n00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.480\nI'm gonna cancel out that one, cause we're\nnot gonna use the direct membership rule.\n\n359\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.330\nLet's choose another one.\n\n360\n00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.040\nWe'll just quickly demo them for you.\n\n361\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.190\nA query rule to take a look at that one.\n\n362\n00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.730\nThe query rule's a little bit different.\n\n363\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.370\nQuery rule we have to give it a name.\n\n364\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.020\nWe have to either import a query statement\nor edit an existing query statement.\n\n365\n00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.530\nSo we can bring one in from somewhere\nelse use and then we can edit one and\n\n366\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.640\nthen modify it.\n\n367\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.500\nAgain we have a resource class\nin this case user resource.\n\n368\n00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.020\nAnd the query is going\nto be written in wql.\n\n369\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.920\nWindows or excuse me w myquery language.\n\n370\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.410\nOr whikle as some people like to say.\n\n371\n00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's fun to say, you should say whikle.\n\n372\n00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.290\n>> Whikle.\n>> Whikle, there you go.\n\n373\n00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.240\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna put that in there.\n\n374\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.940\nWe have our user resource,\nSMS user resource.\n\n375\n00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.870\nGonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click that, and\n\n376\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.930\nthen, if we want to do that, that will\nthen effectively bring in the users.\n\n377\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.920\nJust that simple query\nbecause that's preloaded.\n\n378\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.450\nBut we may want to narrow that focus,\nor go out and\n\n379\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.230\nget a certain group users from somewhere.\n\n380\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.300\nWe'd want to modify the query\nas a result of that right?\n\n381\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.800\nWe could also go in and we could\ndo an include collections rule, so\n\n382\n00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.740\nlet's take a look at that one real quick.\n\n383\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.180\nWhen we do that we have\nto choose one collection,\n\n384\n00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.210\nin this case the user collections\nthat we want to be able to use.\n\n385\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.200\nNow, we do have the option to\npull down here normally, and\n\n386\n00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.890\nI'm just gonna zoom in so\nyou can see that.\n\n387\n00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.200\nIn the other picker where we\ndo the device collection,\n\n388\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.380\nthat will say device collections and\nit'll be limited to computers.\n\n389\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.450\nThe reason that both do not exist here, is\nthat when we're doing the user collection\n\n390\n00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.810\nand the user rule to populate it, we don't\nneed devices so it doesn't show it to us.\n\n391\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.970\nBut it some wizards,\ndepending on what we're doing,\n\n392\n00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.990\nyou actually have the option\nto move through both.\n\n393\n00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.340\nSo it just depends on where we are.\n\n394\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.380\nBut we'll see that change to device\ncollections when we do the device\n\n395\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.590\ncollection in just a minute.\n\n396\n00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.990\nSo we could go ahead and we could choose,\n\n397\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:01.010\nlet's say hypothetically here,\nAll Users and User Groups.\n\n398\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.430\nWe could select that and\n\n399\n00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.420\nit would include any users from\nthat particular association.\n\n400\n00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.350\nNow we could also do an exclude and\nif we do an exclude, you get the idea,\n\n401\n00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.810\nit's basically the same thing.\n\n402\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:16.190\nWe make that choice and we go ahead\n\n403\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.650\nand effectively you'll see it\ndoes not allow me to do that.\n\n404\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.520\nAnd what I did is I chose the same\nexact group that I put in for\n\n405\n00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.770\nthe include because a lot of times people\nsay well what if you do it for both?\n\n406\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.990\nCan we have multiple rules?\n\n407\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.890\nYeah, you could have multiple rules,\nbut the problem is you have rules\n\n408\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.580\nthat effectively cancel each other out,\nwe get an error just like this.\n\n409\n00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.750\nIt says, hey you can't do that because\nyou just told me to include it.\n\n410\n00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.110\nNow you're telling me to exclude it,\nyou gotta make up your mind, right?\n\n411\n00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:45.020\nSo we wanna make sure we know that there\nis logic built into this here, right.\n\n412\n00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.580\nEven though I complain sometimes\nabout the fact that it doesn't always\n\n413\n00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.510\nwork the right way.\n\n414\n00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.380\nThere is logic built in there so, I'm\ngoing to delete out that rule on the top\n\n415\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.080\njust use the one that we did for\nthe include, right we can do that.\n\n416\n00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.060\nWe can schedule that.\n\n417\n00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.240\nWe know when that's going to run, so\nthat's no big deal we'll hit next there.\n\n418\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.560\nWe're just going to hit next, populate\nthat let it go you see how quick it goes.\n\n419\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.680\nIt's done almost immediately and\nonce we hit close there and and\n\n420\n00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.380\nit comes back, we then will have\nTest User Collection 1, right?\n\n421\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.120\nIt has not populated yet,\nbecause it hasn't actually run.\n\n422\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.200\nit will run over the next few minutes and\nover time it will populate and\n\n423\n00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.270\ngo out and pull in a membership.\n\n424\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:25.000\nBut you can see right now, at least,\nthat we have it there, it's been created.\n\n425\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.450\nAnd you can see that there\nare no members currently, but\n\n426\n00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.030\nwe do have the opportunity\nto be able to use that.\n\n427\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.480\nNow the other thing that's interesting is\nif we wanna update the membership on this\n\n428\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.100\nparticular collection, we can right click.\n\n429\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.570\nAnd I'm gonna highlight update membership\nand zoom in so you could see this.\n\n430\n00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.920\nWe can do that by right clicking.\n\n431\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.520\nNow people often get confused\nbetween the refresh function and\n\n432\n00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.890\nupdate membership in this console.\n\n433\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.490\nRefresh is just that.\n\n434\n00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.220\nIt refreshes the console, but\n\n435\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.230\nit doesn't force us to go out\nto the site server database, and\n\n436\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.800\nactually update the table listings and\nsee whether or not there's any new data.\n\n437\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.930\nIt simply refreshes what's\nalready in the console,\n\n438\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.650\nwhich means that chances are good\nyou're not gonna see a change.\n\n439\n00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.210\nUpdate Membership forces a recompilation\nof the data in the table.\n\n440\n00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.010\nSo we go out to the SQL database,\nin other words, and\n\n441\n00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.360\nwe check to see if there's any updates,\nand we process what's ever pending, and\n\n442\n00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.170\nwe come back with new information.\n\n443\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.180\nSo when you wanna see if\nsomething is actually modified and\n\n444\n00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.190\nchanged based on an update,\nyou have to do update membership.\n\n445\n00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:27.945\nNow when you update membership what will\nhappen is we'll get this little pop up.\n\n446\n00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:30.455\nMove it up so\nyou can see it before I click on it,\n\n447\n00:20:30.455 --> 00:20:34.325\nand you'll see it says we'll\nre-evaluate the membership rules for\n\n448\n00:20:34.325 --> 00:20:37.795\nthe selected collections and it may\ntake or might take some time to finish.\n\n449\n00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:39.165\nAre you sure you want to continue?\n\n450\n00:20:39.165 --> 00:20:42.475\nWell, again, no,\nI just thought I'd kill some time.\n\n451\n00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:45.735\nI'm waiting on somebody to show up at the\nairport and I'm a little bored right now\n\n452\n00:20:45.735 --> 00:20:48.718\nand I ran out of battery so\nI can't be playing Candy Crush.\n\n453\n00:20:48.718 --> 00:20:50.151\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So therefore I'm actually\n\n454\n00:20:50.151 --> 00:20:51.150\nplaying with this.\n\n455\n00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.630\nSo yes, I wanna be able to do this,\nof course I do.\n\n456\n00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.030\nBut what they're telling\nus here is the following.\n\n457\n00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.240\nWe are re-evaluating collections\nbased on membership rules.\n\n458\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.670\nIn other words, we're going back and\nre-running the rules to pull in updates\n\n459\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.480\nand then update the database and, as\na result of that, show us new information.\n\n460\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.450\nSo this is going to potentially get us\nupdates in the console over time, but\n\n461\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.990\nagain this could take some time.\n\n462\n00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.470\nSuccess doesn't happen\novernight right away.\n\n463\n00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.870\nIt could happen literally one or two hours\nlater as those things get queued up and\n\n464\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.160\neventually they're processed.\n\n465\n00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.290\n>> And from what you're saying there,\n\n466\n00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.190\nlet me make sure I'm clear,\nwe're querying the database so\n\n467\n00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.340\nthe only thing these queries will\npull back are discovered resources.\n\n468\n00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.810\nWe're not actually going\nout to Active Directory, so\n\n469\n00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.810\nwe'd have to You have to discover again-\n>> No, no, no, no\n\n470\n00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.180\n>> to pull them into the database again.\n\n471\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.680\n>> No, when we do this we're actually\nre-running all those rules and potentially\n\n472\n00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.840\ngoing out and pulling everything in and\nupdating the data in the data table.\n\n473\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.010\n>> Okay.\n>> In case there's been an update,\n\n474\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.110\nthen reflecting all that back.\n\n475\n00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.600\n>> Very good.\n>> So we're touching both, the AD and,\n\n476\n00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.540\nultimately, we're touching\nthe database as well.\n\n477\n00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.570\nNow, if you take a look.\n\n478\n00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.260\nRight back there you'll see\nthat now we do have two\n\n479\n00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.170\nmembers\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n480\n00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.030\n>> in that collection.\n\n481\n00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.000\nSo we just did an update membership.\n\n482\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.300\nAnd in this case the lab environment's\nusually pretty quick right.\n\n483\n00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.900\nIt's a very small environment not a lot\ngoing on so it updates almost immediately.\n\n484\n00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.270\nIn the real world that could\ntake some time, right.\n\n485\n00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.760\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n486\n00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.250\nWe saw that that updated cuz\nwhen I did the screen shot\n\n487\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.090\njust two minutes ago as we\nwere starting to talk and\n\n488\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.660\nwe created it that was zero\nbecause it had not updated yet.\n\n489\n00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.170\nNow I'll let you in on a little\nsecret with regards to SCCM.\n\n490\n00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.740\nThis is Microsoft,\nthis is a Microsoft console.\n\n491\n00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.935\nYou know how I feel about consoles and\nhow well they update.\n\n492\n00:22:19.935 --> 00:22:20.470\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n493\n00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.790\n>> And how well they refresh.\n\n494\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.945\nAlmost as much love as I have for\napps on phones.\n\n495\n00:22:24.945 --> 00:22:25.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n496\n00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.390\nthe reality here is that that\nmembership was already updated.\n\n497\n00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.750\nIn that collection, it just wasn't\nactually showing in the console\n\n498\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.070\nbecause the membership goes out and\nexecutes when I hit apply and OK.\n\n499\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:43.590\nAnd it's actually gone out, found the\nusers, updated the data in the data table,\n\n500\n00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.270\nbut the console has not talked to\nthe database and refreshed the view.\n\n501\n00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.400\nSo I didn't see it.\n\n502\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.730\nNow by running an update membership\nI just forced it go out and do that.\n\n503\n00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.850\nBut the reality is within probably 10 or\n\n504\n00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.750\n15 seconds of me executing\nthat first okay,\n\n505\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.520\nto actually set the rule up and populate\nthe collection, it was already there.\n\n506\n00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.260\nIt just hadn't shown up in the console.\n\n507\n00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.985\nThat has to do with the amount of\ntime it takes takes to do refreshes.\n\n508\n00:23:05.985 --> 00:23:08.455\nNot the amount of time it takes\nto actually execute that query.\n\n509\n00:23:08.455 --> 00:23:11.125\nSo in this case,\nthat rule just be aware of that.\n\n510\n00:23:11.125 --> 00:23:14.005\nWe didn't include, we didn't do a query\nrule, but it's the same thing, right?\n\n511\n00:23:14.005 --> 00:23:14.845\nJust so you know.\n\n512\n00:23:14.845 --> 00:23:16.455\nSo let's do the same\nthing on the device side.\n\n513\n00:23:16.455 --> 00:23:18.055\nLet's take a look at devices real quick.\n\n514\n00:23:18.055 --> 00:23:20.275\nThen we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna talk about roles.\n\n515\n00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:21.335\nI like sourdough personally.\n\n516\n00:23:21.335 --> 00:23:22.215\nThat's just me.\n\n517\n00:23:22.215 --> 00:23:23.695\nIt's a good crunchy sourdough though.\n\n518\n00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:24.925\n>> Yes, yes.\n>> It's gotta be like a nice thick\n\n519\n00:23:24.925 --> 00:23:25.665\ncrunchy sourdough.\n\n520\n00:23:25.665 --> 00:23:27.490\nDon't like that wimpy\nsourdough that's kinda.\n\n521\n00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.340\nYou know, just, yeah.\n\n522\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.030\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, it's not,\n\n523\n00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.000\nyou gotta have a crust on it,\nthat's important.\n\n524\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.880\nAll right, so what we see here,\nwe're just talking about baking.\n\n525\n00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.170\nThere's nothing wrong with talking\nwrong with talking about baking.\n\n526\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.670\n>> Always good.\n>> Always good, so we're in Assets and\n\n527\n00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:39.870\nCompliance, we went down\nto Device Collections here.\n\n528\n00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.750\nAnd we're gonna scroll over and see we\ndo have the built-in Device Collections.\n\n529\n00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.760\nSo you can see all desktops and servers.\n\n530\n00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.450\nAll mobile devices all\nsystems all unknown computers\n\n531\n00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.120\nagain all starting with the word all.\n\n532\n00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.571\nKind of a dead give away if you will.\n\n533\n00:23:51.571 --> 00:23:54.363\nSo we can see those we are going\nto go ahead and build on that.\n\n534\n00:23:54.363 --> 00:23:57.230\nWe are going to basically just create\na collection there the way we do with\n\n535\n00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.191\nthe users So we're gonna right-click,\ngonna go to device collections,\n\n536\n00:24:00.191 --> 00:24:01.320\ncreate device collection.\n\n537\n00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.370\nHave the same wizard that opens up.\n\n538\n00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.270\nBasically the only difference is it\nsays create device instead of create\n\n539\n00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:07.990\nuser collection.\n\n540\n00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.200\nOther than that, it's gonna be the same.\n\n541\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:11.900\nScroll down here, we'll give that a name.\n\n542\n00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:17.430\nWe'll call that test or twist,\nwhichever one, cuz I can't type.\n\n543\n00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.855\n>> They both work.\n>> Test Device.\n\n544\n00:24:18.855 --> 00:24:22.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Collection 1,\n\n545\n00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.840\nall right, so we've got that.\n\n546\n00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.810\nI think I typed the word, yeah,\nthere we go, number 1 in there.\n\n547\n00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.870\nSo we're gonna go grab\nour limiting collection.\n\n548\n00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.120\nThis time in the limiting collection we'll\nhave our device collections as opposed\n\n549\n00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.540\nto our user collections.\n\n550\n00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.320\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n551\n00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.080\ndo all systems cuz that's gonna\ngive us our broadest coverage.\n\n552\n00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.520\nThat's gonna be all the machines that have\nbeen found whether they are known or not.\n\n553\n00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.530\nJust everything that's available to us.\n\n554\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.130\nGonna go ahead and click Next,\nwe have our membership rules.\n\n555\n00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.250\nWe have our same four membership rules,\nI'm not gonna bother to demo them again.\n\n556\n00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.900\nThey work the same exact way.\n\n557\n00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.830\nI'm just gonna go ahead\nan include collection rule.\n\n558\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:57.580\nI'm gonna go ahead and choose all systems.\n\n559\n00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.890\nLet's get the broadest coverage in there.\n\n560\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.650\nClick OK, gonna go ahead and hit next.\n\n561\n00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.080\nI'm going to go ahead and hit next there,\njust finish that out real quick.\n\n562\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.070\nAgain it's going to happen\nalmost immediately.\n\n563\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:15.080\nWe'll have our collection populate here\nin a little bit as well so down at\n\n564\n00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.710\nthe bottom we're going to show you, going\nto highlight it so you can see it, and\n\n565\n00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.680\nI'm going to zoom in to show you something\nthat you want to be aware of here.\n\n566\n00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.930\nSo I know it's kind of hard to see.\n\n567\n00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.890\nSee if we can zoom in\na little bit on that.\n\n568\n00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.690\nSo you can see the icon and\nI've highlighted the icon.\n\n569\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.560\nLet me zoom in a little more and\nscroll down.\n\n570\n00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.680\nI know it's very pixellated.\n\n571\n00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.930\nBut I want to show you the hourglass\noff to the right lower hand corner\n\n572\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.835\nof the three or four monitor icon\nthat represents the collection.\n\n573\n00:25:40.835 --> 00:25:43.755\nThat hour glass indicates there\nis an update in progress.\n\n574\n00:25:43.755 --> 00:25:46.269\nSo, what that is is that's\nthe membership rule going out and\n\n575\n00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:49.476\nactually being run to populate the\ncollection and the console is saying hey,\n\n576\n00:25:49.476 --> 00:25:52.827\nwait a second, I'm I'm in a holding\npattern, I don't have an update status yet\n\n577\n00:25:52.827 --> 00:25:55.002\nback from the database\nsaying I'm complete.\n\n578\n00:25:55.002 --> 00:25:57.772\nThat's what that hourglass is\nsitting there representing.\n\n579\n00:25:57.772 --> 00:26:00.292\nNow that's gonna sit there for some time.\n\n580\n00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:03.912\nNow, if we go in and\nwe go up here and we do a refresh.\n\n581\n00:26:03.912 --> 00:26:05.372\nNot a delete, but a refresh.\n\n582\n00:26:05.372 --> 00:26:08.289\nAnd we do a refresh, and we hit refresh.\n\n583\n00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:14.500\nGive that a second, that's going to go\naway and immediately when I hit refresh\n\n584\n00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:19.100\nwhat you'll see is,\nthat that hourglass is gone and\n\n585\n00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.210\nnotice that the number is updated, and\nremember I said that within ten to 15\n\n586\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.280\nseconds, that include collection\nrule kicks and runs and it's there.\n\n587\n00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.190\nIt doesn't update in the console.\n\n588\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:34.630\nThat hourglass would have sat on that\nicon for probably a good 30 minutes\n\n589\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.710\nuntil the console updated if we didn't go\nout and just do a simple F5 and refresh.\n\n590\n00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.080\nSo it is done, actually,\nalmost immediately,\n\n591\n00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.730\nbut the console doesn't reflect that.\n\n592\n00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.780\nYou just wanna know that and\nbe aware of that, right?\n\n593\n00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.890\nThat's not a test thing by the way, that's\njust a, hey, in the real world don't let\n\n594\n00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:52.250\nthat catch you unaware and make you\nthink it's not working when it is thing.\n\n595\n00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.600\nBecause then what you do is\nyou sit on that collection and\n\n596\n00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.950\nyou start re-running it.\n\n597\n00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.270\nDo an update membership and all that stuff\nand you're just creating a lot of traffic\n\n598\n00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.110\nand a lot of stress when,\nin fact, all you have.\n\n599\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.420\nAll you have to do is just refresh.\n\n600\n00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.320\nAnd chances are good that the console\nhas actually already updated.\n\n601\n00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.140\nIt just hasn't reflected in the console.\n\n602\n00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.350\nSo I just want you to be confident in\nthat and be aware of that as well.\n\n603\n00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.410\nSo we've gone ahead, we've created a user\ncollection, created a device collection.\n\n604\n00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:18.780\nNow we also talked about the fact\nthat we're going to go ahead and\n\n605\n00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.640\ntalk a bit about rules and security.\n\n606\n00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.330\nSo I want to just go ahead and take\na quick look at that while we're in here.\n\n607\n00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.910\nSo we're going to scroll down to\nthe administration work space.\n\n608\n00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.840\nAnd bring that up, and\nI'm going to go back in and zoom in for\n\n609\n00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.100\nyou as soon as that transitions.\n\n610\n00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.550\nJust want to give the system a second\nto kind of catch up with us.\n\n611\n00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.950\nWhat I'm gonna do is just come down here\nand I'm gonna highlight security rolls and\n\n612\n00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.200\njust bring them up and see what they are.\n\n613\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.510\nWhat we have here is,\n\n614\n00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:50.830\nlet me just come and get the arrow\nout of the way so we can see,\n\n615\n00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:56.680\nwe have a in the administration workspace\nunder security, was security roles.\n\n616\n00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.520\nWe have a list,\nnow these are not all the roles,\n\n617\n00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.260\nbecause there are a few\nthat are not being shown.\n\n618\n00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.520\nBut we do see at the very top upper left\nhand corner, security roles, 15 items.\n\n619\n00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.760\nDid talk about factor of 15, so\nwe do have 15 built in roles.\n\n620\n00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.330\nWe're gonna show you a separate graphic\nwith them listed on the screen,\n\n621\n00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.170\na nice little screen capture Mike did for\nus.\n\n622\n00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.510\nWe'll do that in a few minutes, so\ndon't worry about that for now.\n\n623\n00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.560\nBut it will be helpful for\nyou to know what all the roles are.\n\n624\n00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.750\nSo you are gonna wanna take note of that.\n\n625\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.280\nBut what we have here is just\na list of the built-in roles, and\n\n626\n00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.670\nyou see I've highlighted one,\nI think application author.\n\n627\n00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:25.710\nSo when it's highlighted, so\n\n628\n00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.380\nwe got some information down at the bottom\nthere about the type of role it is.\n\n629\n00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.340\nIt's got no user\nassociated with right now.\n\n630\n00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.130\nIt says user count 0.\n\n631\n00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:33.590\nSo we see there's nothing in there,\n\n632\n00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.320\ngives us a little description\nof what that role is.\n\n633\n00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.370\nNow if we wanna create our own roles,\nthese are the ones that we start out with.\n\n634\n00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.130\nBut let's say, Mike and I talk.\n\n635\n00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:41.880\nWe do some planning.\n\n636\n00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.000\nWe're talking about some stuff,\n\n637\n00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.450\nand Mike says, you know, I want to create\nthis role, but it's gonna be a derivative.\n\n638\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.300\nIt's gonna be a role that's gonna be\nable to do several different things,\n\n639\n00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.160\nnot just be able to give\napplication authoring rights.\n\n640\n00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.040\nBut it's gonna do that\nplus something else.\n\n641\n00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.270\nAnd do we have a role like that,\nis what he asked me, and\n\n642\n00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.920\nI say well no we probably don't but\nwe have the beginning of one.\n\n643\n00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.610\nSo what we're going to do is take that as\na starting point and then customize them.\n\n644\n00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.680\nSo we're going to,\nlike we do with any good template,\n\n645\n00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.210\nwe're going to make a copy because we\nnever want to modify the original.\n\n646\n00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.930\nBecause that would obviously lead\nto complication if things go wrong.\n\n647\n00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.980\nWe're gonna copy that original role,\nand then we're gonna modify it.\n\n648\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.040\nSo let's take a look at how to do that.\n\n649\n00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.220\nWhat we're gonna do is just grab one\nof these, I'm gonna choose application\n\n650\n00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.240\nauthor, it happens to be the one I'm one,\nit's no big deal.\n\n651\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.400\nI'm gonna take that, I'm gonna right\nclick, and what I'm gonna do, and\n\n652\n00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.840\nI'll just highlight it and zoom in there\nfor you real quick, is I'm gonna copy it.\n\n653\n00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.890\nYou can see I'm about to select\nthe copy option, so I'm gonna do that.\n\n654\n00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.650\nMake a copy.\n\n655\n00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.180\nCopy security roll wizard comes up,\na little dialogue box.\n\n656\n00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.880\nI have to give it a name.\n\n657\n00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.588\nI'm gonna call it coffee.\n\n658\n00:29:43.588 --> 00:29:45.854\n[LAUGH]\n>> C-O-U-G-H.\n\n659\n00:29:45.854 --> 00:29:49.310\nWhy?\nBecause that's what Mike is doing quietly\n\n660\n00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.218\nwhen nobody is looking.\n\n661\n00:29:50.218 --> 00:29:52.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's coughing, and so then when I do\n\n662\n00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.630\nthat, customize the permissions for\nthis copy of the security role.\n\n663\n00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.820\nLet me just zoom in so\nyou can see this on the bottom here.\n\n664\n00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.310\nSo I have my little name and\n\n665\n00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.850\nthen what I see is I have a bunch of\npull down items that can be modified.\n\n666\n00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.470\nAt the bottom I can click on those arrows,\nthose carrots open up those hierarchical\n\n667\n00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.130\nareas, and I can start added or\nmodifying permissions as necessary.\n\n668\n00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.730\nSo this is effectively just a listing of\n\n669\n00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.450\nall the different areas of the permissions\nassociated with this role.\n\n670\n00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.450\nI can modify them as needed.\n\n671\n00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:25.130\nSo if I wanna be able to go in, let's say,\nhypothetically to alert subscription,\n\n672\n00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:29.750\nand I wanna be able to, as I open that up,\nyou can see, go in, and I could set,\n\n673\n00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.370\nyou know, hey,\nI wanna be able to modify that.\n\n674\n00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.470\nIt's currently set to no.\n\n675\n00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.690\nWhat I have to do is obviously\nmake a change and set that to yes.\n\n676\n00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:35.550\nSo I can do that.\n\n677\n00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.150\nI'm gonna go in there,\ngo to modify, highlight it,\n\n678\n00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:43.890\ngoing to pull that down, and\nyou'll see I've highlighted that,\n\n679\n00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.580\nI pull that down, and\nI now have an option to go yes.\n\n680\n00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:51.090\nAnd obviously I would make a choice there\ndo this and whatever, configuration I\n\n681\n00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.640\nwould like once I'm done twiddling around\nin there, getting all the settings done.\n\n682\n00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.640\nI'll go ahead and I'll hit okay, and then\nwe have, effectively, a copy of this role,\n\n683\n00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.070\nbut now it's been modified to\nreflect whatever I want to do.\n\n684\n00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.050\nSo, I'll just make a slight change here.\n\n685\n00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:04.770\nWe'll do yes on that one.\n\n686\n00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:10.120\nAnd so, by doing that, by the way,\nwe are also dependency aware.\n\n687\n00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.730\nNow, what that means is I\nonly chose modify yes, but\n\n688\n00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.520\nmodify is also gonna\ndrag read along with it.\n\n689\n00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.840\nAnd so without having to choose read,\nyou'll notice it set read to yes as well.\n\n690\n00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.430\nBecause modify will not work unless\nyou have the read permission\n\n691\n00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:24.510\nassociated with it.\n\n692\n00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.620\nSo the logic, the intelligence, in\nthe console is set up in such a way that\n\n693\n00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.475\nif you make one choice but it requires\nother things to work, just like we do for\n\n694\n00:31:32.475 --> 00:31:35.165\ninstance with the add features\nwizard that we talked about,\n\n695\n00:31:35.165 --> 00:31:37.645\nwhere we gave Microsoft props for\ndoing it the right way.\n\n696\n00:31:37.645 --> 00:31:39.805\nAnd they do deserve credit for\ndoing that the right way.\n\n697\n00:31:39.805 --> 00:31:41.015\nJust like they do here,\n\n698\n00:31:41.015 --> 00:31:44.512\nthey're not gonna allow us to assign\na permission that will be incomplete and\n\n699\n00:31:44.512 --> 00:31:47.602\nnot work unless you bring in the dependent\npermission that will allow it to work.\n\n700\n00:31:47.602 --> 00:31:48.422\n>> Fair enough.\n>> So it's good that\n\n701\n00:31:48.422 --> 00:31:51.292\nthey're doing that and we can see\nthat happening here so that's good.\n\n702\n00:31:51.292 --> 00:31:52.846\nSo we've got that.\nSo let's just assume you know,\n\n703\n00:31:52.846 --> 00:31:54.376\nmade a whole bunch of changes, right.\n\n704\n00:31:54.376 --> 00:31:56.463\nWe've got nothing else\nthat we want to change.\n\n705\n00:31:56.463 --> 00:31:57.206\nSo we're going to click OK.\n\n706\n00:31:57.206 --> 00:31:59.156\nSo we'll do that.\n\n707\n00:31:59.156 --> 00:32:01.060\nGive that just a second to instantiate.\n\n708\n00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:07.131\nAnd then alphabetically, thankfully this\none does update in almost real time,\n\n709\n00:32:07.131 --> 00:32:09.820\nwe can see that it is created there.\n\n710\n00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.330\nAnd you'll see it says custom role.\n\n711\n00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.650\nBecause now that is under the Thoms's\nrole type says customer role\n\n712\n00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:18.200\nbecause that's one of the ones\nthat I built as opposed to\n\n713\n00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.300\nall the other ones around\nit say built in role.\n\n714\n00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.510\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz those are the ones\n\n715\n00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.130\nthat are managed by the system.\n\n716\n00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:26.440\nAnd you'll notice down at the bottom of\nthat list under the last item right above\n\n717\n00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.230\ncoffee where it says full\nadministrator built in role.\n\n718\n00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.930\nNotice user count set to one.\n\n719\n00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.510\nThat's the default built in\nuser that's actually used\n\n720\n00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.980\nthe alias we're using to open up and\n\n721\n00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.680\noperate the system because that's affected\nwith the console users we're logged in as.\n\n722\n00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.330\nAll the other roles are set\nto zero because there's no\n\n723\n00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.570\nother users associated with them.\n\n724\n00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:43.130\n>> Right, no.\n>> Right?\n\n725\n00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.602\nSo no members or no users,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n726\n00:32:45.602 --> 00:32:48.270\nAll right, so the other thing we wanna\ntalk about in here is something known as\n\n727\n00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.250\nAdministrative Users.\n\n728\n00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.739\nSo we're gonna come up here real quick.\n\n729\n00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:56.870\nNow I was talking about the fact\nthat I may want to go ahead and\n\n730\n00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:01.710\nassign another user to give rights to,\nand you can see here by default we\n\n731\n00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.770\nhave our administrator user\nalready set up in there.\n\n732\n00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.830\nBut let's say we want to be able to\ndelegate out a roll, we want to be able to\n\n733\n00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.070\ngive Mike some rights, so I'm gonna bring\nhim in and create him as an admin user.\n\n734\n00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.700\nI have to create another user in here.\n\n735\n00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:13.880\nWell that's no big deal.\n\n736\n00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.640\nWe can right click on this, and we can go\nahead and we can do the add user or group,\n\n737\n00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.530\nand we're just gonna do that.\n\n738\n00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.500\nAnd we're gonna be asked to\nprovide a user name or a group so\n\n739\n00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.730\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna browse.\n\n740\n00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:26.458\nAnd I'm just gonna narrate for this part\nbecause you guys have seen me browse for\n\n741\n00:33:26.458 --> 00:33:27.045\nusers before,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n742\n00:33:27.045 --> 00:33:29.230\n>> This is not very exciting.\n\n743\n00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:32.400\nBut what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna go ahead,\n\n744\n00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.990\nand we're going to hit cancel for\na second, try that one more time.\n\n745\n00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:43.845\n>> It's that same dialog box.\n\n746\n00:33:43.845 --> 00:33:44.930\n>> It is.\n>> It does not want us to type.\n\n747\n00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.100\n>> Yeah, well just now we have to change,\nchange focus, go back.\n\n748\n00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.475\nIt's that whole, when I do the zoom in,\nzoom out thing, it messes with the focus.\n\n749\n00:33:52.475 --> 00:33:53.740\n>> Right.\n>> So we're just gonna do that real\n\n750\n00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.410\nquick to get it to do that, there we go.\n\n751\n00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:59.170\nAnd we're going to type in test user\nwhich is the name of the user we have.\n\n752\n00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.160\nWe're going to check name and\n\n753\n00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.370\nfound out its in th user AD so we're\njust going to pull that out really quick\n\n754\n00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:08.170\nclick OK put the user back in there and\nthen in the middle dialog\n\n755\n00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.270\nbox here after a signed security roll\nthat I want to be able to get it.\n\n756\n00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:14.950\nSo i'm going to go ahead and grab my\ncustom roll because I now have a roll that\n\n757\n00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:19.480\nI can assign, and so what I have to\ndo is make a selection there and\n\n758\n00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.200\nyou can see I've chosen our Custom Role,\nright?\n\n759\n00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.140\nSo I've done that so\nwe're gonna be able to do that.\n\n760\n00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:30.010\nClick OK and I've effectively now in\na moment, as soon as I make the selection,\n\n761\n00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:35.190\nassigned the Test User to the Coughy Role\nand I now am going to click OK.\n\n762\n00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.450\nAnd I have a secondary user,\n\n763\n00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:42.300\na one that has been given a constrained\nrole in order to be able to do its job.\n\n764\n00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.440\n>> Nice.\n>> It's kinda nice to be able to go in and\n\n765\n00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.940\ndo those things, so this is how we're\nactually going to be going in and\n\n766\n00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.310\nworking with not just collections but\n\n767\n00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:54.160\nalso creating custom roles from a security\nstandpoint, assigning users to them.\n\n768\n00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:54.860\n>> Yeah, very good.\n\n769\n00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.770\nI like the built in roles that\nalready have permissions assigned.\n\n770\n00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.650\nMakes it a lot easier to get started\nworking with and then very customizable.\n\n771\n00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.460\nYou can go in and make your own rules, and\ngive em exactly the permissions you need.\n\n772\n00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.680\n>> It does.\nSo let's take a look at\n\n773\n00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.430\none other thing in the assets and\n\n774\n00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.040\ncompliance work space before we come back\nout to the graphics Mike has for us.\n\n775\n00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.330\nJust to clean up a couple of little items.\n\n776\n00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.800\nI mentioned that one of the interesting\nthings with device collections,\n\n777\n00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.050\nis the idea of a maintenance window.\n\n778\n00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.090\nSo I just wanna show\nthat to you real quickly,\n\n779\n00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.160\nsince we didn't really get\na chance to take a look at it.\n\n780\n00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.630\nSo let's go to our Test Device Collection.\n\n781\n00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.540\nI'm gonna highlight, and\nI'll zoom in for you in a minute,\n\n782\n00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.900\nas soon as we bring it up.\n\n783\n00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.910\nGonna right-click and\njust go to properties, and\n\n784\n00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:34.370\nget that out of the way before we\nactually ask you to join us here so\n\n785\n00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:39.210\nlet me just bring that up, and\nas soon as we get the properties sheet,\n\n786\n00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:44.570\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna just\nclick on the maintenance window tab.\n\n787\n00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.990\nAnd you can see there that we have\na maintenance window area, and we have\n\n788\n00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:53.050\nthe little yellow asterisk that allows\nus to create a new maintenance window.\n\n789\n00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.740\nI'm gonna show you something interesting\nabout maintenance windows aside from\n\n790\n00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.716\nthe fact we can create them.\n\n791\n00:35:56.716 --> 00:35:59.120\nAll the built-in device collections and\nbuilt-in user,\n\n792\n00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.530\nfirst of all user collections\ndon't have maintenance windows,\n\n793\n00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.280\nbut any user collection rather,\ndoesn't have a maintenance window.\n\n794\n00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.170\nThe built-in device collections have\nthe maintenance window tab, but you\n\n795\n00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.840\ncan't actually create maintenance windows\non the built-in device collections.\n\n796\n00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.170\nThe system controls those.\n\n797\n00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.350\nBut, on the ones that we create, we can\nactually create a maintenance window.\n\n798\n00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.670\nSo, we can go in and do that, and\nby creating a maintenance window,\n\n799\n00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:25.550\nby clicking there what we're effectively\ndoing is we're giving it a name.\n\n800\n00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.990\nWe're specifying an effective date and\na time value.\n\n801\n00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.950\nAnd we're specifying a recurrence window.\n\n802\n00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.230\nAnd what we're doing is\napply the schedule to and\n\n803\n00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.780\nwe're choosing what action\nwe want this to cover.\n\n804\n00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.160\nMaintenance windows\nare effectively going to be,\n\n805\n00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.750\nif we do this the right way,\nlinked to our change management process,\n\n806\n00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:46.470\nand hopefully our management of\nthe output of change management,\n\n807\n00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:50.210\nwhich is gonna be hey, we've got these\nchanges going in from out in the system,\n\n808\n00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.620\nand then what's the next time\nwe're allowed to do that?\n\n809\n00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.790\nEffectively as we talked about with SLA's,\n\n810\n00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.730\nwith service level agreements,\nwhat is our maintenance window?\n\n811\n00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.650\nAnd it's the same maintenance\nwindow we're talking about here.\n\n812\n00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.890\nWhere in effect we're just recreating\nthat window in the system, so\n\n813\n00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:07.700\nthe way we guarantee that things like\nsoftware deployments or things like\n\n814\n00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:14.230\napplication or software packages mainly,\nis really what we're thinking of,\n\n815\n00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:17.450\nthat they're gonna occur within\nthat specified maintenance so\n\n816\n00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.010\nthen they will not occur outside\nof it to affect the business.\n\n817\n00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.840\nSo we're bracketing that deployment.\n\n818\n00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.710\nBecause what will happen is you will see\nwhen we do this in a future episode that\n\n819\n00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:27.420\nwe're gonna go in.\n\n820\n00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:31.080\nWe're gonna create an application and\nor package to do a software deployment.\n\n821\n00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.260\nWe're gonna push that and\nwe're gonna say do it immediately.\n\n822\n00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.940\nBut immediately doesn't\nreally mean immediately.\n\n823\n00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.190\nImmediately could be well I'll queue it\nup and do it as soon as I get to it or\n\n824\n00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.260\nimmediately it could be,\nit'll happen right away.\n\n825\n00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.250\nOr I could schedule it and\nsay do it at some point.\n\n826\n00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:45.140\nOr I could say do it in\nthe maintenance window.\n\n827\n00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.900\nAnd then it will be queued and\n\n828\n00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.910\nit'll be sitting until the maintenance\nwindow opens up, and then it'll execute.\n\n829\n00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:52.850\nI can also override that maintenance\nwindow, and I can and say what,\n\n830\n00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.520\neven though I'm not supposed to be able\nto do deployment now, go ahead and\n\n831\n00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.800\ndo it anyway so I can override the\nmaintenance window with a deployment and\n\n832\n00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.230\nactually force the deployment to\nhappen immediately if I choose to.\n\n833\n00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.070\nSo maintenance windows\ncan actually be valuable.\n\n834\n00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.840\nThey can do different things for us so\n\n835\n00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.300\nwe're just gonna wanna be aware\nof that and understand that.\n\n836\n00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.630\nThat was good as I exploded out.\n\n837\n00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:11.800\nI zoomed out as well.\n\n838\n00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.230\nSo I disappeared, and then we just\nsuddenly created some synergy there.\n\n839\n00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.650\nI disappeared right as\nthe window zoomed back out.\n\n840\n00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.280\nThat was awesome, by the way.\n\n841\n00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.110\nVery cool.\n\n842\n00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.700\nSo I can go ahead and\nI can create that maintenance window.\n\n843\n00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.410\nIf I choose to.\n\n844\n00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:28.520\nWe'll just call that we,\njust name it something.\n\n845\n00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.380\nClick OK.\nAnd you'll see that's there.\n\n846\n00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.550\nAnd so let's click OK on that and\nthen what we'll do is just that in there.\n\n847\n00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:38.910\nAnd then if w go to one of these built\nin collections, like all systems, and\n\n848\n00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:42.150\nwe right click on this one and\ngo to properties.\n\n849\n00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.270\nWhat we'll see,\njust click on that one there real quick,\n\n850\n00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:50.500\nbring that up, is we do have a maintenance\nwindow tab that will be there as well.\n\n851\n00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:55.480\nWhat we will see is that\nit grayed out in terms of\n\n852\n00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.310\nthe ability to add new maintenance windows\nbecause it is controlled by the SCCM.\n\n853\n00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:03.980\nThe SCCM process itself because this\nis one of the built in ones and\n\n854\n00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.420\nwe don't have rights to it.\n\n855\n00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.620\nSo as a result we're not able to\nactually play with that one, so\n\n856\n00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.940\nI just want to point that out to you and\n\n857\n00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.080\nmake sure you guys are aware of\nthat little nugget of information.\n\n858\n00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.020\nAlways valuable.\n\n859\n00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.540\nLet's go out to Mike's machine if we can.\n\n860\n00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.180\nI want to show just a couple\nof quick items we have set up\n\n861\n00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.010\nto wrap up a couple of things.\n\n862\n00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.100\nSo we can see on this slide right here,\nthis table I'll call it, that we have\n\n863\n00:39:26.345 --> 00:39:30.925\nactually want to go to the one up\nabove that, no I'm sorry back there,\n\n864\n00:39:30.925 --> 00:39:33.015\nI apologize, no you're absolutely right,\nI take it back, I do apologize.\n\n865\n00:39:33.015 --> 00:39:35.915\nSo, I should pay attention\nto where we are is what I\n\n866\n00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:37.765\nwould take away from that conversation.\n\n867\n00:39:37.765 --> 00:39:41.915\nSo what we want to see is how are we going\nto, actually, wait, no, I take it back.\n\n868\n00:39:41.915 --> 00:39:44.645\nMonitor and collections, we want,\ndo we have monitor and collections?\n\n869\n00:39:44.645 --> 00:39:45.285\nThat a different one.\n\n870\n00:39:45.285 --> 00:39:47.230\n>> Let's see\n>> Okay, no,\n\n871\n00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.200\nwe need that one, go to that one.\n\n872\n00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.400\nNo, that's the one we wanna see.\n\n873\n00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.000\nZoom in on that one, no, look at that one.\n\n874\n00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.490\nThat's the rules, let's zoom in on that,\nwe'll talk about that one for a minute.\n\n875\n00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.980\nWell, we have the monitoring collection.\n\n876\n00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.930\nI know what you did, you split it,\nthat's why I didn't recognize.\n\n877\n00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.980\nYou split it into two, right?\n\n878\n00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.742\n>> Yep.\n>> It's because it was\n\n879\n00:39:58.742 --> 00:39:59.426\na table, my mistake.\n\n880\n00:39:59.426 --> 00:40:00.703\nAll right, we'll do that one in a second.\n\n881\n00:40:00.703 --> 00:40:04.042\nI was looking for one that was gonna be\nall in one, and it split on two pages,\n\n882\n00:40:04.042 --> 00:40:06.068\nthat's why I didn't recognize what it was.\n\n883\n00:40:06.068 --> 00:40:07.564\nSo let's zoom in just a little bit more so\n\n884\n00:40:07.564 --> 00:40:09.643\nthey can probably see that\na little better if possible.\n\n885\n00:40:09.643 --> 00:40:10.154\nAll right, good.\n\n886\n00:40:10.154 --> 00:40:15.048\nSo, what this is is the list of all\nof the built in roles that exist\n\n887\n00:40:15.048 --> 00:40:16.780\ninside of the system.\n\n888\n00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.030\nThe 15 that we talked about.\n\n889\n00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.600\nNow it may be hard for you to sit\nthere and copy these all down and\n\n890\n00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.350\nknow what they are.\n\n891\n00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.430\nI don't want you to stress over the fact\nthat you should remember all 15.\n\n892\n00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:26.420\nWhat I want you to know for\n\n893\n00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.420\nexam preparations is that we do\nhave them and it would be good for\n\n894\n00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.870\nyou to know what they are but if you don't\nremember them, not the end of the world.\n\n895\n00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:34.090\nBut if you need to get them all down,\n\n896\n00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.470\nyou don't wanna spend five minutes with\nthe screen pause trying to copy them.\n\n897\n00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:40.230\nJust go out and Google for them because\nyou remember you will find the stuff,\n\n898\n00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.400\nit is out there on\nthe Microsoft website as well.\n\n899\n00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.120\nIt is in the documentation,\nwe are just trying to summarize and\n\n900\n00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.120\nprovide it for you.\n\n901\n00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.510\nMake it a little easier for you to consume\nbut if it doesn't work for you that way,\n\n902\n00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.230\njust go out and\nget a list off the Internet.\n\n903\n00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.740\nAnd just write them down and then remember\nwhat they are and you'll be fine.\n\n904\n00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.170\nLet's go back up to that beautiful table.\n\n905\n00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.400\nWe did create that split into two,\nand we will be able to see that.\n\n906\n00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.320\nAll right, and you can see it now\njust a little bit if you want.\n\n907\n00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.310\nYeah, that's good, just so we have that.\n\n908\n00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.940\nSo then what we have here is how\nwe monitor collections, right?\n\n909\n00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.970\nWe've talked about how to create them,\nbut we wanna keep an eye on them, right?\n\n910\n00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:12.490\nAnd so if we're looking at the Component\nStatus for the creation or, excuse me, for\n\n911\n00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:16.035\nthe actual running and the manipulation\nand management of the collection,\n\n912\n00:41:16.035 --> 00:41:20.730\nSMS_COLLECTION-EVALUATOR is gonna\nprovide us status information related to\n\n913\n00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.270\nwhat's going on in a collection.\n\n914\n00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.500\nWhen we look for log information,\nthe Colleval, short for\n\n915\n00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.650\ncollection evaluation log, is where we're\ngonna get detailed status information for\n\n916\n00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:31.110\nthe actual collections themselves.\n\n917\n00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:35.030\nSo, it's one of the logs we'd look for\nin that group of 73 that we spoke about.\n\n918\n00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.070\nStatus message queries\nwill allow us to go in and\n\n919\n00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.430\nlook at status information\nbased on a query dynamically.\n\n920\n00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:43.030\nWe took a look at some of those\nin one of our prior discussions.\n\n921\n00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.380\nAnd then reports are going to allow us,\nwe haven't really looked at reports yet\n\n922\n00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.870\nbut we will,\n\n923\n00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:52.060\nit's going to allow us to leverage SQL\nserver reporting services capabilities.\n\n924\n00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.220\nAnd we have over 400 built in\nreports that we can go and use.\n\n925\n00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.210\nAnd there are reports on all collections.\n\n926\n00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:01.290\nAll packages and program deployments,\nall resources in a collection.\n\n927\n00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.530\nLots of different ways to\nlook at this information.\n\n928\n00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.380\nSo we'll be able to take\na look at all that and\n\n929\n00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.970\nbe able to diagnose things\nthat maybe going on as well.\n\n930\n00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.990\n>> Another great episode Adam,\nlove those demos.\n\n931\n00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:11.520\nWe got to look at collections,\n\n932\n00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.380\nat ways we can take those resources that\nwe've discovered, collect them up, right.\n\n933\n00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.800\nManage them as a unit.\n\n934\n00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.180\nStart simplifying that administration\nwithin SCCM, as well as a look at roles.\n\n935\n00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.210\nThe default roles, the 15 default\nroles that are built in there\n\n936\n00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.725\nthat we can use to control permissions or\naccess to SCCM and\n\n937\n00:42:27.725 --> 00:42:29.985\nthe console and\nall the goodies inside there.\n\n938\n00:42:29.985 --> 00:42:31.375\nAnd the ability to create our own rules.\n\n939\n00:42:31.375 --> 00:42:34.635\nSo, if we wanna customize what\nsomebody can do when we get in there,\n\n940\n00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:36.135\nwe've got that capability as well.\n\n941\n00:42:36.135 --> 00:42:37.405\nSo, thanks for that Adam.\n\n942\n00:42:37.405 --> 00:42:38.875\nHope everybody enjoyed that episode.\n\n943\n00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:42.030\nRemember, if you wanna attend\none of Adam's

--> 00:00:17.141\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:21.080\nToday we're doing our System Center\nConfiguration Manager 2012 R2,\n\n5\n00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.570\nand specifically in this episode\nwe're gonna be looking at\n\n6\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.280\ndeploying the client agent, right.\n\n7\n00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.850\nWe've seen how to create our collection,\n\n8\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.780\nstart gathering up our different resources\nthat we wanna be able to manage, but\n\n9\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.680\nsomehow we've gotta be able\nto talk to those resources.\n\n10\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.110\nAnd the agent is where that's\ngoing to come into play.\n\n11\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.210\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.790\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.780\n>> I'm good I'm good we're going\nto talk about client agents.\n\n14\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.680\nAnd specifically, as Mike was just\ntalking about, how to deploy them.\n\n15\n00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.170\nNow deploying sounds fairly\nstraightforward, and indeed it is.\n\n16\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.650\nBut we have to understand that deployment\ncould take one of several paths.\n\n17\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.960\nAnd so\nwhat we wanna do is at a high level,\n\n18\n00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.310\nfirst understand the generic concepts\nof what the client agent represent.\n\n19\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.390\nAnd then talk through, actually show and\ntell as we will in the demo environment,\n\n20\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.770\nthrough a couple of different\nscenarios for client agent deployment.\n\n21\n00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.620\nThe general concept of the client agent is\nthis little piece of software that gets\n\n22\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.000\ninstalled on the managed end point that\nallows us to effectively maintain control,\n\n23\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.470\nas Mike was indicating, to do inventory,\nto do policy updates, to deploy\n\n24\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.390\nsoftware through either an application or\na package, whatever it may be.\n\n25\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.440\nWe have to install this in some way.\n\n26\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.320\nIn the Windows world we can Group Policy\nbased deployment just like we would with\n\n27\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.590\na MSI file to be able to\ndrive that deployment.\n\n28\n00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.570\nWe can go ahead and we can deploy the\nclient agent manually by pulling down and\n\n29\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.930\nexecuting the CCMsetup.exe solution.\n\n30\n00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.891\nWe can go ahead and we can do a log\non script, we can go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.915\ndeploy it as part of and image for\nimaging operating system and\n\n32\n00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:50.268\nput the agent in the system and\njust have it some up in auto discover.\n\n33\n00:01:50.268 --> 00:01:52.790\nSo there's lots of different ways for\nus to do this.\n\n34\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.990\nThe challenge for us is just figuring\nout what the most efficient way will be\n\n35\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.610\ngiven the parameters of our network and\nhow we choose to operate.\n\n36\n00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.540\nWhile we're not gonna demo\nevery deployment model for you,\n\n37\n00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.250\nwe will at least highlight the dos and\ndon'ts and\n\n38\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.820\nthe things you should be aware\nof with regards to them.\n\n39\n00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.710\nSo what I wanna do is jump in and\nshow you how to do this.\n\n40\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.160\nWe're going to go ahead and go to my\nmachine, and we're gonna take a look at\n\n41\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.300\nthe client deployment, or\nat least the process associated with it.\n\n42\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.890\nNow normally we start out in SCCM and\nwe're in the console.\n\n43\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.358\nIn this case what we're gonna do is start\nout in the domain controller cuz we're\n\n44\n00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:25.020\ngonna demo how to do a Group Policy\nbased deployment for you.\n\n45\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.020\nOr at least I'm gonna walk you\nthrough the major parts of that.\n\n46\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.515\nNow this is something that most people\nactually really don't bother to take\n\n47\n00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:34.370\nthe time to do cuz the reality is\nit takes a lot of time to set up.\n\n48\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.380\nYou have to create a custom Group Policy.\n\n49\n00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.720\nYou have to add in the SSCM templates from\n\n50\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.580\nthe SSCM install directory in order to\nprovide support for the deployment,\n\n51\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.590\nand then you have to configure that,\nand then set that up and manage it.\n\n52\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.600\nWhile it's doable, it's a lot of work.\n\n53\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.160\nBut a lot of times people ask about this,\neither when I'm teaching or\n\n54\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.630\nwhen I'm on site and I'm doing work.\n\n55\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.220\nThey say, hey you know I've heard I\ncan do this but it's kind of hard and\n\n56\n00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.550\nconfusing to figure out what\nto do based on reading it.\n\n57\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.650\nCould you walk me through it?\n\n58\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.860\nWell, no I don't happen to have it all\nset up and just waiting around for\n\n59\n00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.360\nyou to do it.\n\n60\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.930\nSo I can tell you what's gonna happen but\nit's a little tough to actually show it to\n\n61\n00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.360\nyou unless you turn me loose inside\nyour directory and let me do it.\n\n62\n00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.380\nAt that point we decide it's\nprobably not a good idea and\n\n63\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.520\nwe decide we'll spend our\ntime doing something else.\n\n64\n00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.320\nBut, I thought it would be valuable\nto show you how to do it so\n\n65\n00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.590\nI am gonna walk you\nthrough how to do this.\n\n66\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.000\nWe will also take a look at\nhow to do a manual deployment,\n\n67\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.310\nhow to pull the CCMsetup.exe package and\nexecute that to install.\n\n68\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.770\nWe could also push the agent out as I've\nalready mentioned through, in some of our\n\n69\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.280\nother demonstrations, through the console\nonce we have a collection and we have it\n\n70\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.530\npopulated if we find machines we can right\nclick and do an install client from there.\n\n71\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.070\nAnd we can do what's called a push install\nwhich is another method for installation.\n\n72\n00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.200\nAnd a lot of times that's really\nthe preferred method actually,\n\n73\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.790\nis just do a push install or to image your\noperating systems as we will talk about in\n\n74\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.530\na future episode with OSD, the operating\nsystem deployment feature and\n\n75\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.720\nto actually include\nthe agent inside the image.\n\n76\n00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.790\nAnd then when you throw the image\nthe machine comes up, it auto-configures,\n\n77\n00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.350\nit is able to leverage the batteries that\nare already set up, so it auto-discovers.\n\n78\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.600\nAnd then the client associates and\nis found, and ultimately managed.\n\n79\n00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.468\nSo there's a lot of\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n80\n00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:10.330\nGroup Policy based deployment may not\nbe at the top of your list, but it is\n\n81\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.720\nsomething interesting and so we will take\nsome time to go through and take a look.\n\n82\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.910\nSo check this one out, I got this.\n\n83\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.495\nI figured out what I'm gonna do,\nthis is gonna be my new one.\n\n84\n00:04:17.495 --> 00:04:19.590\nTitus are you ready,\nthis is what I'm gonna do, ready?\n\n85\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.290\nThis is the signal to go.\n\n86\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.540\nOh look at, that's awesome.\n\n87\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.175\nAll right,\nthat's gonna be the new one right there.\n\n88\n00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:26.062\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n89\n00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:27.712\nwhat we're gonna do is the following.\n\n90\n00:04:27.712 --> 00:04:29.550\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna jump in here.\n\n91\n00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.040\nSo let me just show you where we are.\n\n92\n00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.830\nI am on the domain control.\n\n93\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.579\nOr you can see that with\nthe highlighted dark\n\n94\n00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:40.004\nblue selector in my virtual\nmachine area PLABDC01.\n\n95\n00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:42.100\nSo I'm on the domain controller right now.\n\n96\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.200\nAnd in the domain controller I'm in\nthe Group Policy Management Editor.\n\n97\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.444\nYou can see that up top there.\n\n98\n00:04:46.444 --> 00:04:48.650\nI know the little blue square's\nkinda sitting in the middle of that.\n\n99\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.050\nI apologize, that's the control tools for\nthe virtual environment that we're using.\n\n100\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.060\nCan't really move those so\nthat's just gonna kinda have to be there.\n\n101\n00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.173\nBut what I've done is I've gone ahead and\n\n102\n00:04:57.173 --> 00:05:02.230\nI've created kind of a custom\nGroup Policy called SCCM Client Install.\n\n103\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.500\nYou can see the name up at the very\ntop on the left of the hierarchy.\n\n104\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.740\nAnd I've just gone ahead and\ndone that in the editor,\n\n105\n00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.490\nright clicked, figured out where I wanted\nto create a new policy, give it a name.\n\n106\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.110\nI just did all that ahead of time\ncuz I figured probably be okay for\n\n107\n00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.850\nus to do that part and\njust tell you what we did there.\n\n108\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.750\nThen I've opened up the policy editor,\nthe computer configuration side,\n\n109\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.630\nas you can see.\n\n110\n00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.810\nI've drilled down inside policies,\ndown to administrative templates.\n\n111\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.560\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n112\n00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.450\nI'm gonna right click on that\nadministrative template folder here\n\n113\n00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.160\nin a minute because I have to add in some\nof those templates that I was managing.\n\n114\n00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.580\nWe have to, I was mentioning,\nthat we have to bring in to manage.\n\n115\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.000\nWe have this process from\nthe SCCM installation media.\n\n116\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.350\nSo we're going to take\na look at how to do that.\n\n117\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.460\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna go over here.\n\n118\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.180\nI am going to right click on\nthe Administrative Templates area.\n\n119\n00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.520\nWe do have a little menu that shows\nup there, Add/Remove Templates.\n\n120\n00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.315\nYou may or may not have seen\nthis depending on how often\n\n121\n00:05:51.315 --> 00:05:52.770\nyou're in playing around\nwith Group Policy.\n\n122\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.560\nBut we're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n123\n00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.350\nSo I am gonna go ahead and\ndo Add/Remove Templates.\n\n124\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.810\nSo let me just click on that.\n\n125\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.060\nWe're gonna get our little\nAdd/Remove Template dialogue box here.\n\n126\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.494\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna click Add and\n\n127\n00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:07.142\nwe're going to get our\npolicy template browser.\n\n128\n00:06:07.142 --> 00:06:09.420\nWe're gonna be able to go out\neffectively and look for it.\n\n129\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.050\nNow what we're gonna have to do\nis obviously know ahead of time\n\n130\n00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.430\nwhere these templates will be, right.\n\n131\n00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.140\nSo we have to know where to find them,\nwe have to know that we have to get them\n\n132\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.670\nbecause they're not just\ngonna magically appear.\n\n133\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.710\nThey are part of the SCCM install.\n\n134\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.306\n>> Okay, that was the question.\n\n135\n00:06:21.306 --> 00:06:22.120\n>> We have to know where to find them.\n\n136\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.280\n>> Was this part of the install or\ndo we have to download it from Microsoft?\n\n137\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.587\n>> We could get it from Microsoft as well,\nbut they are part of the install.\n\n138\n00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:29.025\nSo when the install is done\nthey actually will show up,\n\n139\n00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:31.065\nnot in the place we would\nlogically think of.\n\n140\n00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:32.610\nWe gotta go find them but\nthey are gonna be there.\n\n141\n00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.780\nSo, I'm gonna tell you\nwhere to go get them from.\n\n142\n00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.650\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\ndo the following.\n\n143\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.712\nWe're gonna go into the C Drive,\nwe're gonna go to our share there.\n\n144\n00:06:40.712 --> 00:06:44.836\nI'm just checking my path statements so\nbear with while I mumble to myself.\n\n145\n00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:46.160\nSo that we're gonna go do that.\n\n146\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.060\nNow the place that you're gonna wanna\ngo find them, if you have to go out and\n\n147\n00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.600\nget them, for real,\nfrom the install media is gonna be.\n\n148\n00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.710\nAnd we'll go ahead,\nwe'll reproduce this path statement.\n\n149\n00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.635\nDuring the demo Mike will type it out.\n\n150\n00:06:57.635 --> 00:06:58.670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n151\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.520\n>> Mike will type it out and put it up so\nthat way we can show it to you after we're\n\n152\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.300\ndone, so don't worry about\nwriting it all down right now.\n\n153\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.285\nBut it's gonna be SCCM Source Media, it's\ngonna be SCCM Source Media > SMS Setup >\n\n154\n00:07:09.285 --> 00:07:11.970\nTools > Config Manager > ADM2 Templates.\n\n155\n00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.130\nI'll give you the path, I'll tell you\nwhat it is, don't worry about it.\n\n156\n00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.460\nSo we'll reproduce that for you.\n\n157\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.210\nAnd look at that,\nmy device is not connected.\n\n158\n00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.004\nOutstanding, let's reconnect to my device.\n\n159\n00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:24.090\nThis is what happens when you play\nwithout a safety net, boys and girls.\n\n160\n00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.350\nAll right,\nlet me just reconnect back in here.\n\n161\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.100\nGive me half a second to do that.\n\n162\n00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.310\nSometimes that does happen.\n\n163\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.410\nWe just lose our connection out.\n\n164\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.540\nThere we go and\nit's establishing the connection.\n\n165\n00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.690\nIf I wait too long it times out,\nthat's the problem.\n\n166\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.748\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n167\n00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.830\nWe're not gonna use that\ninstallation path, but\n\n168\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.260\nI'll make sure that you have that\nat the end of our discussion.\n\n169\n00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.240\nWe are going to use the one that we've\nset up which is in hidden share inside\n\n170\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.995\nthe system already.\n\n171\n00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:46.050\nSo I'm gonna go to that.\n\n172\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.430\nSo bear with me here just\na second while I type that in.\n\n173\n00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.450\nSo we're gonna go, whoops, here.\n\n174\n00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.255\nLet me just click in there.\n\n175\n00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:59.489\nAnd there we go, play, and\noh plat rather, I keep saying,\n\n176\n00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:01.962\nI keep doing play instead of plat.\n\n177\n00:08:01.962 --> 00:08:06.607\nASSIST01 and then C$.\n\n178\n00:08:06.607 --> 00:08:08.680\nSo we're going to go to the hidden\nshare of the C:\\ drive.\n\n179\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.269\nThen we're going to go to Program Files.\n\n180\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.245\nBecause I love typing.\n\n181\n00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n182\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.780\nthen in Program Files, we're going to\ngo to Microsoft Configuration Manager.\n\n183\n00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.440\nAnd then of course,\nif you could see it, right?\n\n184\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.260\nJust cause I love pointing\nout the inanity of life.\n\n185\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.060\nSo the browse window for\n\n186\n00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.400\nyou to be able to see the path your typing\nis like about five characters long.\n\n187\n00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.870\nSo I get past like C colon backslash,\nI can't see everything.\n\n188\n00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.770\nSo I have to actually type it, because all\nthe things that are in Microsoft there,\n\n189\n00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.650\nI have no clue which one\nis the one I actually want.\n\n190\n00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.230\n>> Right.\n\n191\n00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.210\n>> So that's gonna be ever so much fun.\n\n192\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.870\nAll right, so where was I?\n\n193\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.085\nSo, Microsoft.\n\n194\n00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:50.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what I get for\n\n195\n00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.270\nbeing a nice guy and saying,\noh, I'll demo that for you.\n\n196\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.330\nNo problem.\n\n197\n00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.780\nSo, that doesn't take-\n>> We like watching you type.\n\n198\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.495\n>> Oh, no, you don't.\n\n199\n00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Configuration Manager, all right.\n\n200\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.460\nThen we got to tools.\n\n201\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.090\n>> And while you're typing that out,\nif you guys ever, if you have any\n\n202\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.330\nquestions about adding about new templates\nto your policy, remember we've talked\n\n203\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.050\nabout that in our active directory classes\nin our library so go check those out.\n\n204\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.340\nExtending that functionality\nof active directory,\n\n205\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.470\nadding in those new templates, right?\n\n206\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.800\nWe've demoed importing office\ntemplates and adding all of those\n\n207\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.030\nhundreds of settings that we can now\ncontrol Office through group policy.\n\n208\n00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.190\nWe're doing the same thing here.\n\n209\n00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.940\nWe're getting a template from Microsoft.\n\n210\n00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.580\nThere are no SCCM settings in\na group policy by default.\n\n211\n00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.420\nWe go out, we get these templates,\nwe import them in.\n\n212\n00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.510\nAnd now we've got all of these new\nsettings that we can use to control\n\n213\n00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.590\nSCCM or at least the agent, or\nwhichever templates we import.\n\n214\n00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.610\nSo, really,\n\n215\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:43.110\nnot difficult to do other than the lovely\ndialogue box that they give us to type in.\n\n216\n00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.200\n>> We'll get that in and then he's\njust gonna go get those templates,\n\n217\n00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.560\nbring them into that group policy.\n\n218\n00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.520\n>> We'll mention why\nhe's typing out that path\n\n219\n00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.145\ndepending on whether or not, and again,\nthis is on the active directory side not\n\n220\n00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:57.795\nnot really system center\nconfiguration manager.\n\n221\n00:09:57.795 --> 00:10:01.555\nIf you've set up that central store or\nnot, with inactive directory.\n\n222\n00:10:01.555 --> 00:10:05.675\nIf you import these templates onto\none main controller, those go into\n\n223\n00:10:05.675 --> 00:10:09.885\nthat local policy definitions folder, and\nif you go to another domain controller and\n\n224\n00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:11.865\ntry an edit a policy,\nit wouldn't be there.\n\n225\n00:10:11.865 --> 00:10:16.330\nSo if you put them in that policy\ndefinitions within they'll replicate and\n\n226\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.490\nbe available on any main control.\n\n227\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.670\n>> All right so they are there.\n\n228\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.085\nThe system is just stupid.\n\n229\n00:10:20.085 --> 00:10:20.670\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n230\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.480\n>> Cuz it couldn't find them but\nthey're sitting right there.\n\n231\n00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.520\nSo all I did was just short the path and\nthen click through to find it.\n\n232\n00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.880\nThis happens sometimes when\nyou go into a hidden share,\n\n233\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.500\nthe system isn't always able to\nresolve it even though it's there.\n\n234\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.540\nBecause you have to type in the entire\nstring including the file name.\n\n235\n00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.130\nAnd if you get the file name extension\nwrong even though the file's there it\n\n236\n00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.230\ndoesn't find it.\n\n237\n00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.570\nSo it is there because you can see as\nwe zoom in I'm able to point to it and\n\n238\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.420\nit's sitting right there,\nbut I have to go and\n\n239\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.630\nactually drill through to actually get\nto the point where I can select it.\n\n240\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.010\nSo, it is there, no problem.\n\n241\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.820\nSo we're gonna choose it We're going\nto see to we have the config manager\n\n242\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.500\nassignment dot ADM and\nConfig Manager installation dot ADM files\n\n243\n00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.210\nthe ADM files act directory extension\ntemplate files that we were talking about.\n\n244\n00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.640\nWe're going to the Config Manager\nassignment dot ADM so\n\n245\n00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.580\nthat's going to be our top one we're going\nto click open so we're going highlight\n\n246\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:14.240\nthat you'll see we have that right there\nand were going to bring that one in and\n\n247\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.740\nthen we are going to go and do add.\n\n248\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.650\nSo, we can simply add that.\n\n249\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.860\nSo, we're gonna have that there.\n\n250\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.300\nOh, wait.\nI'm sorry, we already did that one.\n\n251\n00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.190\nLet me bring in the installation one\nas well, just to show that to you.\n\n252\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.680\nSo, we'll bring in both.\n\n253\n00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.690\nGot that.\n\n254\n00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.310\nLet's do close.\n\n255\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.310\nBring those in and\nwe now have those added in.\n\n256\n00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.910\nAll right, so now what we're gonna\ndo is we are going to go ahead\n\n257\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.310\nand we are going to open that.\n\n258\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.684\nSo let me go in and\n\n259\n00:11:45.684 --> 00:11:51.220\nlet me do the following.\n\n260\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.750\nUnder, I'm just gonna expand this so\nyou can see it a little bit.\n\n261\n00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.655\nThey come in under classic\nadministrative templates ADM.\n\n262\n00:11:57.655 --> 00:11:58.770\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now it's interesting.\n\n263\n00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.530\nLet me just zoom in so you can see this.\n\n264\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.840\nIt would be great if they actually\ncame in and said, oh look.\n\n265\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.430\nThese are the config manager\ntemplates that you wanted.\n\n266\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.560\nAnd they do, but you have to open up the\nclassic administrative template ADM folder\n\n267\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.230\nto find them.\n\n268\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.810\nYeah, don't make this stuff up.\n\n269\n00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.040\nI just explain it to you.\n\n270\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.600\nSo, just so you know.\n\n271\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.430\nThe reason that happens is that the ADM\nis the older template file type, and it's\n\n272\n00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:25.980\nbeing used and labeled as such because we\nnow use a new one for the newer solution.\n\n273\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.170\nWe have the ADMX files which is the newer\nversion now cuz everything has to\n\n274\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.290\nsound better and doesn't need to operate\nbetter when you put an x on the end.\n\n275\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.100\n>> It does, it does.\n\n276\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.301\n>> So anyway, this is the older school,\nold school style of doing it.\n\n277\n00:12:38.301 --> 00:12:40.011\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's why it's labeled under\n\n278\n00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:42.990\nclassic administrative templates so\nit has ADM, at the end of that.\n\n279\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.740\nSo it does show up there, but it's kinda\nhidden, you have to know to look for\n\n280\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.410\nit there, otherwise you're scratching\nyour head going, where did it go,\n\n281\n00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.180\nwhy isn't it there?\n\n282\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.560\nAnd sure enough it is,\nbut you have to explode or\n\n283\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.560\nexpose that folder by opening\nup the hierarchy to find it.\n\n284\n00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.740\nSo when we do that,\nwe do have Config Manager 2012.\n\n285\n00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.290\nWe'll just click on that to open that up.\n\n286\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.380\nAnd we have Config Manager 2012 Client,\nlet me highlight that so we can see that.\n\n287\n00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.900\nLet me just expand this out\njust a wee bit over here.\n\n288\n00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.500\nAnd we'll zoom in real quick so\nyou can see that, so\n\n289\n00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.960\nif it exploded up that hierarchy on\nthe right, or on the left rather.\n\n290\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.810\nAnd then on the right you will see\nwe have the site assignment and\n\n291\n00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.020\nclient deployment settings item so\nwe can go in and edit.\n\n292\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.050\nSo we're going to go in and\nbe able to address one or\n\n293\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.150\nboth of those to complete this.\n\n294\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.460\nSo we've got those imported, so we're\ngoing to just zoom out for a minute so\n\n295\n00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.590\nwe can get to that.\n\n296\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.880\nAnd now what we're going to do is\nthe file, we're going to go ahead and\n\n297\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.580\nwe are gong to edit those.\n\n298\n00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.330\nSo let's go in and I believe we're going\nto start going with, oh let me see,\n\n299\n00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:42.630\nlet us do the Config Manager for\nsite assignment first.\n\n300\n00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.420\nSo let's do that one,\n\n301\n00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.010\njust thinking logically through in my head\nkinda what we have to do and get done.\n\n302\n00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.040\nSo let me just zoom in so\nyou could see that.\n\n303\n00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.260\nJust gonna right click and choose edit\nthere, right, pretty straightforward.\n\n304\n00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.210\nNow the nice thing about this,\nbefore I zoom about,\n\n305\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:58.050\nis again if we're not sure what this does,\nagain, props for props are due.\n\n306\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.770\nMicrosoft does a good job,\nespecially in the group policy area and\n\n307\n00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.230\nhas, by the way for some time.\n\n308\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.680\nIf you don't know the history of group\npolicy, this is again kind of folklore and\n\n309\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.930\nurban myth and\nlegend all rolled up into one, but\n\n310\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.630\ndo you know what group policy\noriginally comes from?\n\n311\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.800\n>> I do not.\n>> You do not?\n\n312\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.400\n>> No\n>> Leave.\n\n313\n00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.495\n>> I'm out of here.\n\n314\n00:14:16.495 --> 00:14:20.120\n>> [LAUGH] So group policy originally,\nway back, and\n\n315\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.430\nwe're talking back in the 9X\noperating system, this is back before\n\n316\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.790\nthe directory concept This is back\nbefore what we think of as the domain.\n\n317\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.770\nThis is prior to all of that,\nwhen we just really had work groups.\n\n318\n00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.350\nWe had the poledit tool in Windows 95 and\n98.\n\n319\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.600\nAnd the poledit tool was\nthe orignal forerunner, or\n\n320\n00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.260\nthe precursor,\nto what we think of today as group policy.\n\n321\n00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:47.020\nIt was first policy editor, but it was\nlocal policy on the local machine only.\n\n322\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.510\nSo edit used to be the tool\nthat we would use.\n\n323\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.510\nAnd even in edit,\nMicrosoft had done a good job\n\n324\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.170\nof documenting what the settings were and\ngiving you a little nudge.\n\n325\n00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.270\nAnd saying hey if you highlight\nthis thing, this is what it is, and\n\n326\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.240\nthis is what it means.\n\n327\n00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.895\nThey've done that here as well, because\nthey tell us on the left hand side as we\n\n328\n00:15:01.895 --> 00:15:04.635\nselect exactly what\nthis policy template or\n\n329\n00:15:04.635 --> 00:15:07.415\nthis group of policy settings\nare going to help us to achieve.\n\n330\n00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:09.225\nSo it is actually kind of\ninteresting that they do this and\n\n331\n00:15:09.225 --> 00:15:12.245\nit is again really good that they\ntake the time to do this stuff for\n\n332\n00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:15.900\nsomebody who may not really understand\nexactly what's happening and\n\n333\n00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.340\nthere's a lot of us and\nby the way every so often that's me.\n\n334\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.330\nI know for a fact it's some of you.\n\n335\n00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.360\nIf Mike was just able to admit this\nin public and not have a problem he\n\n336\n00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.880\nwould say it's him as well but-\n>> I mean there's over 4,000\n\n337\n00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.620\nsettings in there.\n\n338\n00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.490\n>> There are a lot right and\nhe may not realize what all\n\n339\n00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.210\n>> And some of them were.\n\n340\n00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.670\n>> of them do.\n>> Some of them are confusing.\n\n341\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.330\n>> A lot of them confusing.\n\n342\n00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.052\n>> Disable the, enable the yeah.\n\n343\n00:15:32.052 --> 00:15:35.690\n>> Yeah so it's no, there's absolutely no\nshame, and I'm not kidding about this,\n\n344\n00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.760\nI'm being totally serious,\n\n345\n00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.030\nthere's absolutely no shame in saying\nhey you what, I'm just not sure.\n\n346\n00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.740\nAnd I'd rather read up on it and\nmake an informed decision than,\n\n347\n00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.590\nyou know, take a chance, and\nmake the wrong decision.\n\n348\n00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.950\nAnd there's times where I gotta stop\nIn the middle of what I'm doing,\n\n349\n00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.790\nwhether it's you know, something with\nyou guys, whether it's teaching a class,\n\n350\n00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.073\nwhether it's working with a client.\n\n351\n00:15:53.073 --> 00:15:55.053\nAnd I got to say, you know what,\nI got take a minute,\n\n352\n00:15:55.053 --> 00:15:57.979\nI got to really figure this out, because\nI dont' do this one all the time, and\n\n353\n00:15:57.979 --> 00:15:59.394\nI just don't want to go from memory.\n\n354\n00:15:59.394 --> 00:16:01.812\nIt might have been five years\nsince I looked at this, and\n\n355\n00:16:01.812 --> 00:16:03.674\nI want to make sure I\nmake the right choice.\n\n356\n00:16:03.674 --> 00:16:07.475\nSo, it's really important, when you go\nout, when you guys do the group policy\n\n357\n00:16:07.475 --> 00:16:11.393\ndiscussions, you were mentioning in some\nof the prior classes in the library that\n\n358\n00:16:11.393 --> 00:16:15.950\nyou've done them, do you actually bring in\nthe Microsoft spreadsheets and templates?\n\n359\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:16.850\nNot the templates rather but\n\n360\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.950\nthe spreadsheets on group policy settings\nand have you talked about or shown those?\n\n361\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:20.890\n>> I don't think so.\n\n362\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.150\n>> So,\nwe're gonna do something real quick.\n\n363\n00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.210\nWe're gonna take a field trip.\n\n364\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.230\nCan we go over to Mike's machine\nreal quick, for just a second,\n\n365\n00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.930\nif you don't mind.\n\n366\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.197\nAll right, so on the Google\n>> You didn't know what I was looking at\n\n367\n00:16:28.197 --> 00:16:29.078\nit while you were talking there-\n>> Oracle.\n\n368\n00:16:29.078 --> 00:16:34.927\nIt's a good thong you weren't looking at\nanything you shouldn't be looking at.\n\n369\n00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:39.843\nOn the Oracle of the Internet for Google,\nplease go ahead and type group policy\n\n370\n00:16:39.843 --> 00:16:44.540\nspreadsheet and let's hit Enter,\nand let's see what we get there.\n\n371\n00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.790\nSo let me-\n>> Group Policy Reference.\n\n372\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.740\n>> Download Group Policy Settings,\nyeah is that from Microsoft, though?\n\n373\n00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.720\n>> It's a blogs.technet thing?\n\n374\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.680\n>> Yeah, TechNet it should be,\nbut directly from Microsoft?\n\n375\n00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.320\nI just don't know,\nI can't see the URL, that's why.\n\n376\n00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.940\n>> I think it's might be Microsoft.\n\n377\n00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.109\n>> Yeah, Microsoft, yeah, go to that\nlink real quick, click on that one.\n\n378\n00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.930\nSo, scroll down, should be able\nto get a download right, so okay,\n\n379\n00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.420\nzoom in, don't download it, just zoom in.\n\n380\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.240\nSo, if you've never seen these, and\nthis is actually really good to know, so\n\n381\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.670\njust a little extra knowledge for you\nwith regards to group policy in general.\n\n382\n00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.130\nSince Mike referenced the fact that we do\ndefinitely give you that information in\n\n383\n00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.320\nother areas but wanna make sure you have\nthe ability to do this in real time if\n\n384\n00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.310\nyou need to, you can look at the current\ngroup policy settings by operating system.\n\n385\n00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.162\nMicrosoft has spreadsheets.\n\n386\n00:17:29.162 --> 00:17:30.537\n>> Nice.\n\n387\n00:17:30.537 --> 00:17:32.030\n>> They allow you to download them.\n\n388\n00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.860\nThey're free.\n\n389\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:33.730\nAnd they do update them.\n\n390\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.780\nAgain, this is one of those things you\nreally gotta go to the source on, right?\n\n391\n00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.410\nGet them.\nThat's why I said is make sure it's\n\n392\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.600\nthe Microsoft one, not somebody who\nposted or reposted them on their blog.\n\n393\n00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.590\nBecause you may not be getting\nthe most up-to-date ones.\n\n394\n00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.210\nBut as Mike scrolls down you'll see we\nhave for Vista at the bottom there.\n\n395\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.000\nYou got 12R2 on the server side.\n\n396\n00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.590\nOn Windows 8, Windows 8.1,\nyou got Windows 7, Server 12,\n\n397\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.160\nyou got Windows 10 at the top there,\nWindows 8.1 Update whatever.\n\n398\n00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.400\nSee got all the different mixing and\nmatching you need by OS platform and\n\n399\n00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.130\nevery group there has the group policy\nsettings associated with that OS.\n\n400\n00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.080\nAnd it's in the spreadsheet you\ncan interact with and filter and\n\n401\n00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.450\nfind all the settings,\nfind the registry keys for\n\n402\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.320\nthe settings and find the information\nabout what those settings do.\n\n403\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.520\nIt's really cool interactive\nsort of spreadsheets.\n\n404\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.890\nI use them with my clients all the time as\nwe go through and we do planning cycles.\n\n405\n00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.440\nI also give them to all my students, or\nat least tell them where to find them,\n\n406\n00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.340\nwhen I do the same kind of classes you\nwere talking about, when we teach those.\n\n407\n00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.290\nSo, it's a good little thing for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n408\n00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.650\nIt's obviously and\nit would be nice if they had one, but\n\n409\n00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:35.260\nit's only like literally five settings, so\nwe don't have one specifically for SCCM.\n\n410\n00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.990\nBut we have the broader\ncontext of the support for\n\n411\n00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.510\nthe operating system within which is runs,\nso it is important to be aware of that,\n\n412\n00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.670\nso good little piece of\nadditional information.\n\n413\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.200\nAll right, if we come back to my\nmachine now that we've done that.\n\n414\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.190\nWe'll go ahead and we'll continue and\npick back up with editing the settings.\n\n415\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.610\nSo, we're going to go and\nwe're going to do that.\n\n416\n00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.460\nI'm going to go ahead and edit these,\nso let me just click here to edit this.\n\n417\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.170\nWe'll bring this up and when we scroll\ndown and kind of get that organized and\n\n418\n00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.070\njust into a place, where we can see that.\n\n419\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.720\nBecause of course, it would be nice if\nit just automatically understood that\n\n420\n00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.210\nI'm in only three quarters of a window and\nit should come up accordingly,\n\n421\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.040\nbut that would be asking for way to much.\n\n422\n00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.630\n>> Yeah it would.\n\n423\n00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.780\n>> All right, so we are in here, and we\nhave done this for the site assignment and\n\n424\n00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.700\nwhat we're going to do is we're going\nto first go in, as Mike was saying, and\n\n425\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.300\nenable this.\n\n426\n00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.560\nSo, it comes up by default not configured.\n\n427\n00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.470\nWe're going to choose enable, and then\nI'm going to zoom in and show you this.\n\n428\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.610\nWe're going to put in the assigned\nsite code on the side and\n\n429\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.510\nin the side assignment retry\nsettings really isn't a lot\n\n430\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.320\nof mystery here its\npretty straight forward.\n\n431\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.990\nI've chosen to enable it as you can see,\nand\n\n432\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.070\nthen I have to put in the assigned site\nwhich is where I'm going to put in\n\n433\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.730\nmy site code we have to know we have\nto know what the site code is remember\n\n434\n00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.528\nthree digits alphanumeric, what was my\nsecret recipe or ingredient for that?\n\n435\n00:19:43.528 --> 00:19:48.315\n>> First letter of your domain name, and\nthen a zero one for that very first site.\n\n436\n00:19:48.315 --> 00:19:51.100\n>> Correct, so, we are going to think\nabout what you think would be the most\n\n437\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.340\nappropriate naming dimension.\n\n438\n00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.050\nRemember just because I\nsaid that it's a good idea\n\n439\n00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.100\nmeans you should always do it\nwithout questioning unfailingly and\n\n440\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.360\nunflinchingly accept that\nas something you should do.\n\n441\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.910\nBut all kidding aside, you should\nobviously come up with your own.\n\n442\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.830\nIf mine makes sense, feel free to use it.\n\n443\n00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.500\nYou can even feel free to tell people\nthat you said it was a good idea.\n\n444\n00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.260\nIt's not a problem.\n\n445\n00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.640\nI don't care if you claim credit for\n\n446\n00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.940\nit, just be able to explain why it's\na good idea and pay it forward.\n\n447\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.860\nRight?\nYou certainly can do that if you like.\n\n448\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.440\nSo, feel free to do that.\n\n449\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.930\nI'm going to put in our site code here.\n\n450\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:23.320\nOur site code is going to be PLB,\nso let's just type that in there.\n\n451\n00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.730\nAnd then, we're gonna go ahead, and we're\ngonna set the assignment retry interval.\n\n452\n00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:29.840\nAnd this is set in minutes.\n\n453\n00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.680\nSomebody was actually smart enough\nto pay attention to this one.\n\n454\n00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.900\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> Supposed to\nmilliseconds or something crazy like that.\n\n455\n00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.800\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\njust set that up, and we'll.\n\n456\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.980\nSet that and do that.\n\n457\n00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.390\nAll right, so we've got all that.\n\n458\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.990\nWe're going to go ahead and we're going\nto hit apply, and we're going to hit OK.\n\n459\n00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.350\nNow, we're going to go ahead and\n\n460\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.660\nwe're going to go down to the next item\nwhich is the client deployment setting.\n\n461\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.450\nSo, I'm going to right click and\nedit that one as well.\n\n462\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.250\nSo, we'll just skip you, or\nskip over that part for you and\n\n463\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.020\njust show you what actually is in there.\n\n464\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.660\nSo again, let me just move this\naround real quick, get this set up,\n\n465\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.430\nlet's just do enable right there,\nand then we have CCM setup.\n\n466\n00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.910\nNow, let me just scroll in so\nwe can see that.\n\n467\n00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.000\nAnd so we've enabled that,\nwe have CCM setup.\n\n468\n00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.240\nNow, with the CCMSetup dialogue box,\nit would be great if I could just say,\n\n469\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.450\noh, let's type out what I'm about to tell\nyou that would magically appear, but yet\n\n470\n00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.670\nit doesn't work that way.\n\n471\n00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.220\nSo, what happens here,\n\n472\n00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.080\nis you have to type in a string\nthat's going to effectively create\n\n473\n00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.070\nthe installation parameters that you\nwould like to have apply to the client.\n\n474\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.030\nSo, we don't have to type that in.\n\n475\n00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:38.643\nSo, I am going to type that in right now\nbut what I'm gonna do type it in and\n\n476\n00:21:38.643 --> 00:21:41.251\nthen, after I get done typing and\nyou heard me type,\n\n477\n00:21:41.251 --> 00:21:44.775\nso you are going to hear me talk\nwhile I type, I will narrate as I go.\n\n478\n00:21:44.775 --> 00:21:48.215\nBut I will explain to you what that does\nas we go, and then I'll zoom back and\n\n479\n00:21:48.215 --> 00:21:49.595\nsee if you can actually see it.\n\n480\n00:21:49.595 --> 00:21:51.475\nBecause I can't do everything\nall at once with the zoom in.\n\n481\n00:21:51.475 --> 00:21:52.625\nIts gonna be too complicated.\n\n482\n00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:54.685\nSo, bear with me here\nwhen we type to send, but\n\n483\n00:21:54.685 --> 00:21:57.155\nI'm going to basically go ahead and\ndo the following.\n\n484\n00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:03.395\nWe're going to type in CCMsetup.exe\nwhich is the name of the executable.\n\n485\n00:22:03.395 --> 00:22:05.160\nSo, we gonna start by doing that.\n\n486\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.260\nSpace SMS,\n\n487\n00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.640\nremember we talked about the fact we\nuse SMS even though it is now SCCM.\n\n488\n00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.200\nSMSSITECODE, all one word and\n\n489\n00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.462\nit automatically is typing capitals\neven though I have taken caps lock off.\n\n490\n00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:18.700\n[LAUGH] That's just the way it is.\n\n491\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.250\nIt's designed to do that.\n\n492\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.090\nSo, don't get freaked out by\nthat when you start typing and\n\n493\n00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.950\nall of the sudden you see\neverything is in caps.\n\n494\n00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.000\nYou are hitting the caps\nlock like what's going on.\n\n495\n00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.942\nIt's designed to do it that way,\nthat's fine.\n\n496\n00:22:27.942 --> 00:22:30.760\nSo, SMS site code equals, and\nthen the site code itself.\n\n497\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.890\nIn our case, it's PLB.\n\n498\n00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.660\nSo, we're putting in the site codes.\n\n499\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.910\nWe're actually going to enter that.\n\n500\n00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:40.580\nThen we're gonna hit a space and do FSP\nfor fallback service pointer status point.\n\n501\n00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:46.230\nWhich is going to be the fault of\nthe fail-over point if you have a problem\n\n502\n00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.010\nwith the primary, we actually have\na fail-over or a fallback that we can use.\n\n503\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.260\nSo, we're gonna specify that.\n\n504\n00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:57.220\nSo, we're going to do the name,\n\n505\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:03.507\nthe fully qualified domain name, P-L-A-B,\n\n506\n00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:10.579\ndo not [INAUDIBLE].\n\n507\n00:23:13.954 --> 00:23:17.287\nAnd then, space and then MP for\nmanagement points so\n\n508\n00:23:17.287 --> 00:23:19.954\nwe have to specify the management point.\n\n509\n00:23:19.954 --> 00:23:26.300\nAnd we'll do POABSYS, POBSYS01.\n\n510\n00:23:29.615 --> 00:23:34.160\nPracticeLBS.com.\n\n511\n00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.470\nAll right.\n\n512\n00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.560\nSo, the FSP is gonna kick in for us,\nif the primary management point fails.\n\n513\n00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.780\nSo, we specify the management point,\nspecify the fall back status point which\n\n514\n00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.030\nis gonna be effectively\na secondary management point.\n\n515\n00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.792\nNow, in our world it's\nactually the same machine.\n\n516\n00:23:47.792 --> 00:23:51.310\nBut make that a different machine, right?\n\n517\n00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.925\nJust so you know in case, you happen\nto catch that when I zoom in and\n\n518\n00:23:53.925 --> 00:23:55.267\nyou see that, you'll know why.\n\n519\n00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:59.170\nAll right, so\nwhat we've done is we've gone ahead,\n\n520\n00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.443\nwe've typed this in Just get\nback to the beginning there.\n\n521\n00:24:03.443 --> 00:24:06.336\nNow, you're not gonna see much of it,\nbecause it trails off as we go, but\n\n522\n00:24:06.336 --> 00:24:08.360\nyou can see, I've started typing that in.\n\n523\n00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.110\nI put the whole thing in there, so\nwe've gone ahead and done that.\n\n524\n00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:15.000\nNow, what I will point out to you is the\nfollowing, let me just scroll over here,\n\n525\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.270\nand zoom in so you can see that.\n\n526\n00:24:21.665 --> 00:24:22.970\nWell I guess it can't\nget better than that.\n\n527\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:23.880\nAll right, we'll do it that way.\n\n528\n00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.370\nAll right, so\nthe help file off to the right says,\n\n529\n00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.990\nhey enabling this policy supersedes\nclient deployment properties or\n\n530\n00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.860\npolicies that may be configured\nin the group policy.\n\n531\n00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.600\nTry that again.\nThe group\n\n532\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.640\npolicy supersedes the properties of\nthe configuration manager client console.\n\n533\n00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.220\nSo that's fine.\n\n534\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.890\nYou wanna know that, but\nwhat's more important is in\n\n535\n00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.880\nthe CCM set up field enter\nthe required command line parameters.\n\n536\n00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.780\nFine, we did that.\n\n537\n00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.780\nIf you don't know what they are,\ncause you probably don't, read on for\n\n538\n00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.340\na list of all CCM setup command line\nproperties and examples of their use.\n\n539\n00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.840\nSee about client install properties in the\nConfig Manager 2012 Documentation Library.\n\n540\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.220\nNow, we did show the kind people,\nand the folk out in audience land,\n\n541\n00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.335\nin one of our prior episodes how to\nfind that Documentation Library online.\n\n542\n00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:04.130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n543\n00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.880\n>> So just pointing out to you that if\nyou're not familiar with what you need\n\n544\n00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.700\nto do here, you can read up on it and\neasily find it.\n\n545\n00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.590\nA little hint for you,\nwe tend to ask at least one or\n\n546\n00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:17.250\nperhaps even more than one question,\non an exam about how to configure\n\n547\n00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.740\nwith group policy and the parameters\nassociated with CCMsetup.exe.\n\n548\n00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:25.505\nMight be worth your time to go in and,\nyou know, take a look,\n\n549\n00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:28.295\nand at least be familiar with it so\nif you did, for instance,\n\n550\n00:25:28.295 --> 00:25:31.165\nperhaps, see questions about\nthis kind of activity,\n\n551\n00:25:31.165 --> 00:25:33.935\nyou would be prepared potentially to\nunderstand how to deal with them.\n\n552\n00:25:33.935 --> 00:25:35.325\nSo just want to make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n553\n00:25:35.325 --> 00:25:38.095\nGoing to click apply.\n\n554\n00:25:38.095 --> 00:25:39.325\nGoing to click okay.\n\n555\n00:25:39.325 --> 00:25:42.890\nGet that configured there as well,\nso we've got that all set up.\n\n556\n00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:49.810\nSo, now that we've done that,\nwe can go ahead and we are going to\n\n557\n00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:54.350\nneed to create or use a Windows installer\npackage for group policy based installs.\n\n558\n00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.420\nSo, now we're gonna have\nto do the following.\n\n559\n00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.280\nWe're going to have to go in, and under\npolicies here we're going to come in and\n\n560\n00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.140\nshift, and\nI'm going to just clean this up and\n\n561\n00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.380\nthen I'll go back in to where we are and\nzoom in so you can see it.\n\n562\n00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.780\nBut under policies we're going\nto go to software settings now.\n\n563\n00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.870\nWe're going to go to software\ninstallation, and we're going to click and\n\n564\n00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.240\nfind there's nothing there.\n\n565\n00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.850\nSo before I zoom in, let me just do this,\n\n566\n00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.610\nI'm going to right click, we're gonna\ndo new and we're gonna do package.\n\n567\n00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:23.390\nAnd so what I did is, I came up here as\nyou can see, I went up under computer\n\n568\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.820\nconfiguration, left the administrative\ntemplate area, came up to software\n\n569\n00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.940\nsettings, software installation, new\npackage, cause there is no package there.\n\n570\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.550\nWe're gonna create a package that's\ngonna allow me to do this installation.\n\n571\n00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.040\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ndo that right now.\n\n572\n00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:42.330\nSo lets just get in there, do package and\nwe're given a browse window to go and grab\n\n573\n00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:46.210\na package because it wasn't fun enough to\ntype in the path one time, we now have to\n\n574\n00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.525\ngo in and type in yet another path and I'm\njust to excited for words, boys and girls.\n\n575\n00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:50.344\n[LAUGH]\n>> I can see that\n\n576\n00:26:50.344 --> 00:26:50.964\n>> All right, so\n\n577\n00:26:50.964 --> 00:26:53.670\nlets see if we can get this\none going in under 5 minutes.\n\n578\n00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:54.825\nSo we're gonna type this in.\n\n579\n00:26:54.825 --> 00:26:59.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we're gonna type this in,\n\n580\n00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.470\nhere we are,\nwe're typing it in, all right.\n\n581\n00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.900\nSo let's try that one more time,\nall right, there we go.\n\n582\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.955\n>> And this is why we really like\nthat right click push method or\n\n583\n00:27:08.955 --> 00:27:11.270\nmaking it part of our image, right?\n\n584\n00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.165\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, this is why\n\n585\n00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:15.935\nwe just love doing that.\n\n586\n00:27:15.935 --> 00:27:16.571\nAll right so I am gonna.\n\n587\n00:27:16.571 --> 00:27:19.049\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Once you get it set up once, right,\n\n588\n00:27:19.049 --> 00:27:21.370\nit's not that you have\nto do this every time.\n\n589\n00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.994\nYou do have to create different policies,\nI'm assuming,\n\n590\n00:27:24.994 --> 00:27:29.631\nbecause we put a site code in there,\nif we've got a multi site environment,\n\n591\n00:27:29.631 --> 00:27:32.022\nwe might have the different policies,\n\n592\n00:27:32.022 --> 00:27:37.190\ndifferent scopes to make sure we associate\nthe right clients with the right site.\n\n593\n00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.420\n>> It would be important to do that,\nyes, so program files, so\n\n594\n00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:46.070\nMicrosoft configuration manager, if I\ncould not hit the use micro, there we go,\n\n595\n00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:53.846\nfat fingering stuff,\nMicrosoft configuration manager,\n\n596\n00:27:53.846 --> 00:27:58.390\nand then clients, and then i386.\n\n597\n00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:03.540\nAll right, so let's try that.\n\n598\n00:28:08.822 --> 00:28:14.547\n>> There we go and\nthen what do I need from there, oh yeah,\n\n599\n00:28:14.547 --> 00:28:19.915\nand then any client that\nend site right after that.\n\n600\n00:28:19.915 --> 00:28:25.642\nSo client.msi.\n\n601\n00:28:25.642 --> 00:28:33.924\nWhat do you mean cannot find plabsys?\n\n602\n00:28:33.924 --> 00:28:35.677\nSeriously?\n\n603\n00:28:35.677 --> 00:28:39.900\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n>> See\n\n604\n00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.278\nthe lab knows how much Adam loves to type,\nit wants to make him do it again.\n\n605\n00:28:44.278 --> 00:28:47.470\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, let's see here real quickly.\n\n606\n00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.230\nSo let's try to do it this way.\n\n607\n00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.810\nWe're going to cheat a little bit boys and\ngirls.\n\n608\n00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.920\nSo what we're going to\ndo is the following.\n\n609\n00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.912\nWe're going to go out there and\nwe are going to do.\n\n610\n00:29:03.912 --> 00:29:10.225\n[SOUND] Now A B sys 01.\n\n611\n00:29:10.225 --> 00:29:11.880\nHit enter.\n\n612\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.980\nAnd we're going to cheat.\n\n613\n00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.672\nAll right, so we're gonna go in and\nwe have to go to program files.\n\n614\n00:29:17.672 --> 00:29:22.370\nAll right, so in there, let's do.\n\n615\n00:29:28.873 --> 00:29:30.359\n>> Okay, that's why.\n\n616\n00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:35.000\nGot it, got it, got it.\n\n617\n00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.460\nAll right, so, [LAUGH] It is.\n\n618\n00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.120\n>> No, it's just not shared, that's why.\n\n619\n00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.730\nAll right, so instead what we're going\nto do because they didn't set it up in\n\n620\n00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.080\nthe lab the right way,\nlet's go in there to the SMS site.\n\n621\n00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.936\nAnd let's do this.\n\n622\n00:29:49.936 --> 00:29:51.979\nLet's go to the C drive on this.\n\n623\n00:29:51.979 --> 00:29:54.170\nWe'll do the hit and share and\njust do it that way.\n\n624\n00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.450\nAll right, so\nthere's more than one way to get to there.\n\n625\n00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.080\nWe're going to do C dollar sign, and we're\ngoing to go in there and just go direct.\n\n626\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.260\nSo we're not going to let that stop us.\n\n627\n00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.350\nAll right, so we're going to go in there\nand we're going to go into program files,\n\n628\n00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.401\nand we're going to go into Microsoft\nconfiguration manager, and\n\n629\n00:30:08.401 --> 00:30:09.786\nwe're going to client, and\n\n630\n00:30:09.786 --> 00:30:13.328\nwe're going to i386, because they should\nhave shared it, but they did not.\n\n631\n00:30:13.328 --> 00:30:15.012\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, and\n\n632\n00:30:15.012 --> 00:30:17.160\nthen we're going to go to client.msi.\n\n633\n00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.460\nSo, what we're going to do is\njust grab the client.msi file,\n\n634\n00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.430\nyou can see it right there,\nI'm gonna grab that, open it up.\n\n635\n00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.880\nAnd then what we're gonna do there,\nis we're gonna select assigned.\n\n636\n00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.250\nNow assigned allows us,\njust gonna grab that,\n\n637\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.330\nclick assign,\nallows us then to set that up.\n\n638\n00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:36.260\nSo it's gonna come in.\n\n639\n00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.090\nIt's gonna just take a second or\ntwo to update, and\n\n640\n00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:43.980\nthen what we're gonna be able to do,\nis once we have that in there,\n\n641\n00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.380\ngoing to be able to\nclose the policy editor.\n\n642\n00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.120\nThat should be ready.\n\n643\n00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:51.759\nAll right so we're going to close that,\nand then what we're going to do is, we're\n\n644\n00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:57.400\ngoing to right-click on our policy right\nhere and we are going to choose enforced.\n\n645\n00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.300\nAnd Mister Policy Guru,\nwhy are we choosing enforced?\n\n646\n00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.890\n>> That way,\nremember what we were talking about?\n\n647\n00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.540\nThat if we enforce a policy,\nit'll go through any blocks,\n\n648\n00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.920\nit'll also give it the highest,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n649\n00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.020\n>> Priority\n>> Priority,\n\n650\n00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.160\nthank you, if any other policies\nare linked to the same location.\n\n651\n00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.000\nSo put this up at the top of the list,\nand make sure nothing can override it.\n\n652\n00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.010\n>> And it mandates because in our\neffect only makes it mandatory.\n\n653\n00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.077\nRight, so effectively,\nwhich is what you were saying, but\n\n654\n00:31:21.077 --> 00:31:22.280\nit's kinda summarizing it.\n\n655\n00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.620\nIt'll make it a mandatory deployment, so\n\n656\n00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.070\nthat way it's gonna hit every machine,\nin this case,\n\n657\n00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.380\nin the domain, we're doing at the root of\nthe domain, it's gonna hit every machine.\n\n658\n00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.720\nAnd it's not gonna be able to be blocked,\nas you said, or overwritten.\n\n659\n00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.250\nWe're gonna enforce that.\n\n660\n00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.480\nNow enforcing it is important\nbecause that means, as we said,\n\n661\n00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.320\nit will then be applied to everybody.\n\n662\n00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.840\nSo that effectively has done the group\npolicy installation as a result of that.\n\n663\n00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.800\nNow if we start logging off machines,\nlogging back in, or\n\n664\n00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.910\nwe start doing a GP update to do\na refresh right on the machine,\n\n665\n00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.170\nwe'll pull down that group policy,\nand eventually have it deployed.\n\n666\n00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.491\nSo that would be doing the group\npolicy based deployment.\n\n667\n00:31:55.491 --> 00:31:58.710\nNow again, you know, it's not rocket\nscience, let's be fair, right,\n\n668\n00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.603\nI mean it's relatively straightforward,\n\n669\n00:32:00.603 --> 00:32:03.841\nlittle hiccups with the path,\nbecause the path wasn't shared out, and.\n\n670\n00:32:03.841 --> 00:32:06.302\nBeing the trusting soul that I am I didn't\nbother to check that ahead of time.\n\n671\n00:32:06.302 --> 00:32:07.811\n[LAUGH] So, shame on me.\n\n672\n00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:09.337\nI should have known to do better, and\n\n673\n00:32:09.337 --> 00:32:11.810\nI certainly got caught by that\ncuz I didn't check it to see.\n\n674\n00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.050\nBut, you saw we could overcome that.\n\n675\n00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.090\nAll we do is go to the C share,\nC dollar sign,\n\n676\n00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.230\nthe administrative share of the machine to\nbe able to get that file and pull it in.\n\n677\n00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.750\nNo big deal.\n\n678\n00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.900\nIn the real world you would obviously have\nthat set up, be able to pull that down.\n\n679\n00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.330\nWe wouldn't have to worry about that.\n\n680\n00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.250\nThis is just the little vagueries of the\nlab environment that we have to deal with\n\n681\n00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:27.010\nsometimes.\n\n682\n00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.040\nBut in general it's\nrelatively straight forward.\n\n683\n00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.796\nNow whats even more straight forward is\na set up called the client push method so\n\n684\n00:32:31.796 --> 00:32:34.553\nthat's where we go to the console and\neffectively push the agent out to members\n\n685\n00:32:34.553 --> 00:32:36.877\nof the collection so lets go ahead and\nlets take a look at that one.\n\n686\n00:32:36.877 --> 00:32:39.649\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to ahead and\n\n687\n00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:42.032\nI'm going to change into console itself.\n\n688\n00:32:42.032 --> 00:32:46.154\nI'm going to go to\na device collection here.\n\n689\n00:32:46.154 --> 00:32:50.252\nSo let's just bring that up and\ngive that just a second.\n\n690\n00:32:50.252 --> 00:32:55.176\nAnd you'll see here that we\nare going to have all of our\n\n691\n00:32:55.176 --> 00:32:58.796\ncollections available, now notice.\n\n692\n00:32:58.796 --> 00:33:00.456\nLet me zoom in so you can see it.\n\n693\n00:33:00.456 --> 00:33:04.618\nNotice that the collection that I created\nin the last episode is not there,\n\n694\n00:33:04.618 --> 00:33:06.280\nbecause we reset the system.\n\n695\n00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.260\nSo remember that test collection right,\nis not gonna be there.\n\n696\n00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.550\nBut all the default built\nin collections are.\n\n697\n00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:15.040\nSo we can see those so what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n698\n00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.890\ngo to site configuration in\nthe administration space cuz\n\n699\n00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.600\nwe have to set something up\nbefore we actually do the push.\n\n700\n00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.710\n>> Okay.\n>> So, we're gonna go out to\n\n701\n00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:22.880\nthe administration work space.\n\n702\n00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.760\nWe're gonna go to site configuration.\n\n703\n00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.670\nGonna go to sites.\n\n704\n00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.670\nAnd so I'm just narrating as we go so\nyou can see where we are before I zoom in.\n\n705\n00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.814\nAnd then what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go to settings and\n\n706\n00:33:34.814 --> 00:33:39.131\nwe're gonna go in and\nwe are going to actually do the following.\n\n707\n00:33:39.131 --> 00:33:43.323\nLet me just go ahead and do this.\n\n708\n00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:54.989\n[SOUND] There we go, all right.\n\n709\n00:33:54.989 --> 00:33:58.332\nGive me one second I'm just checking\nsomething really quickly before we\n\n710\n00:33:58.332 --> 00:34:00.000\ndo what we need to do.\n\n711\n00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.912\nAll right, yeah, that's good.\n\n712\n00:34:00.912 --> 00:34:04.140\nOkay so I just wanna make sure\nthe fall back site is not selected.\n\n713\n00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.890\nAll right, so we're going to go ahead.\n\n714\n00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:06.800\nWe're going to come in here.\n\n715\n00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:15.675\nGonna select our site and we are going\nto come to client install settings.\n\n716\n00:34:15.675 --> 00:34:17.985\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust highlight this and zoom in so\n\n717\n00:34:17.985 --> 00:34:20.585\nyou can see that real quick\nbefore we do anything.\n\n718\n00:34:20.585 --> 00:34:21.955\nSo we come to sites.\n\n719\n00:34:21.955 --> 00:34:25.105\nWe've come over here, highlighted\nour primary site, the PLA site.\n\n720\n00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:28.032\nWe've right clicked and\noff our right click option\n\n721\n00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:31.772\nwe are choosing client installation\nsettings right down there.\n\n722\n00:34:31.772 --> 00:34:32.982\nWe have our little dropout or\n\n723\n00:34:32.982 --> 00:34:36.282\npopout menu, client push\ninstall is what we're gonna do.\n\n724\n00:34:36.282 --> 00:34:38.452\nWe're gonna go configure that,\nso we're gonna choose that.\n\n725\n00:34:38.452 --> 00:34:41.680\nSo I'm gonna go in there and\njust highlight that real quick.\n\n726\n00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.000\nSo we'll go grab that.\n\n727\n00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.390\nWe'll bring that up,\ntakes just a second to load so\n\n728\n00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:49.780\nwe can actually then enable this and so\nwhat we're going to do here is we're going\n\n729\n00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.220\nto enable automatic client wide or\nautomatic site wide client push install.\n\n730\n00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.860\nSo we're going to turn on this\nfeature by enabling it and\n\n731\n00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.960\nby default we are not set up to do that.\n\n732\n00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.300\nSo we're going to enable that,\nturn that on.\n\n733\n00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.030\nSo we've done that and then notice what\nkind of systems are we going to install\n\n734\n00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:09.770\non, you'll see that we are installing on\nservers and workstations by default, but\n\n735\n00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:13.510\nnotice config manager site\nsystem servers are not included.\n\n736\n00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.800\nWe want to install the client on our own\nservers and manage our own site service,\n\n737\n00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.615\nso we have to check that box off.\n\n738\n00:35:18.615 --> 00:35:21.745\nBecause by default we don't manage the\nservers themselves, even though we should.\n\n739\n00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:24.355\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose that obviously.\n\n740\n00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:25.795\nAnd then at the bottom there,\n\n741\n00:35:25.795 --> 00:35:29.225\nhow are we gonna handle the installation\nof the client on Domain Controllers?\n\n742\n00:35:29.225 --> 00:35:31.345\nDo we wanna install it on\nDomain Controllers or not?\n\n743\n00:35:31.345 --> 00:35:35.355\nSeparate category again and on the bottom\nthe default is hey never install\n\n744\n00:35:35.355 --> 00:35:39.475\non a Domain Controller unless we override\nthat and specify it in the wizard, and\n\n745\n00:35:39.475 --> 00:35:40.555\nthat's the default choice.\n\n746\n00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:43.660\nBut we can choose that upper level\nradial button always install the main\n\n747\n00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.610\ncontrollers.\n\n748\n00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.360\nSo it is up to us to you know\nkind of configure through that.\n\n749\n00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.470\nI am a gambling kind of guy so\nI am just going to go ahead,\n\n750\n00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.870\ngo buck wild here as they say and\njust turn everything off.\n\n751\n00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:55.380\n>> Yee haw.\n>> I want to rename that and\n\n752\n00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.240\ncall it Adam wild.\n\n753\n00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.050\nI am going to go Adam wild because I am\nnot a buck, I don't look like a buck.\n\n754\n00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.630\nIf you have ever seen me you would\nknow I don't look like a buck at all.\n\n755\n00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.880\nI actually look like a George, but\n\n756\n00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.020\nsince I wasn't named George I\nam going to go with Adam.\n\n757\n00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.080\nSo we are going to go to the accounts tab.\n\n758\n00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.726\nI always wanted to be\ncalled George by the way.\n\n759\n00:36:08.726 --> 00:36:10.641\n>> Yeah I can call you George for\nthe rest of the week.\n\n760\n00:36:10.641 --> 00:36:13.940\n>> Yeah might confuse everybody because\nthen they'll be like George who?\n\n761\n00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:16.100\nWhere's the guy with long hair and\nthe beard, right?\n\n762\n00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.550\nSounds like him, but it's not him.\n\n763\n00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.810\nAll right.\nSo, we're gonna go to the accounts tab and\n\n764\n00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.010\nnow you'll notice that we\ndon't have an account here.\n\n765\n00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.083\nAnd if you notice it says\nspecify the account or\n\n766\n00:36:24.083 --> 00:36:26.596\naccounts that can install\nthe account manager client.\n\n767\n00:36:26.596 --> 00:36:30.614\nThis account must be a member of, very\nimportant, member of the local admin group\n\n768\n00:36:30.614 --> 00:36:34.342\non the destination computer but what\naccount do know by default out of the box\n\n769\n00:36:34.342 --> 00:36:38.616\nthat's automatically a member of the local\nadmin group on any computer in the domain.\n\n770\n00:36:38.616 --> 00:36:40.393\n>> I'm going to show the built\nin domain administrator account.\n\n771\n00:36:40.393 --> 00:36:43.407\n>> Built in domain\nadministrator's account, correct.\n\n772\n00:36:43.407 --> 00:36:46.117\nSo we have to think about what account or\naccounts,\n\n773\n00:36:46.117 --> 00:36:50.267\nif we choose more than one, would have\nrights to be able to meet this criteria.\n\n774\n00:36:50.267 --> 00:36:52.857\nThis is a great scenario,\npotentially, for troubleshooting.\n\n775\n00:36:52.857 --> 00:36:56.650\nIt's a great scenario for potentially\ntroubleshooting on a timed experience\n\n776\n00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.940\nwhere you're sitting in a room in front of\na computer screen answering questions and\n\n777\n00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:00.715\nthe clock is ticking.\n\n778\n00:37:00.715 --> 00:37:01.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n779\n00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.765\nI would be thinking\nabout that if I was you.\n\n780\n00:37:03.765 --> 00:37:05.370\n>> [LAUGH] Hint, hint.\n\n781\n00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.650\n>> Hint, hint, right, hint, hint.\n\n782\n00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.710\nSo what we're gonna do is obviously\nwe have to specify this account here.\n\n783\n00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:14.320\nSo what we're gonna do is go in and we are\ngoing to click the asterisk to be able to\n\n784\n00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.360\ngrab that account and we're going\nto see that we have two options.\n\n785\n00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.270\nWe have either existing account or\n\n786\n00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.820\nnew account because we can use one\nthat's already there to create one.\n\n787\n00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.950\nIt's going to be up to us.\n\n788\n00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:29.950\nWe're going to go ahead and we're going\nto create a, or rather I should say use.\n\n789\n00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.050\nI'm just looking to see how we're\ngoing to use an existing account.\n\n790\n00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.530\nLet's go in there, no we don't have one,\nit's not already in there.\n\n791\n00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.340\nOkay, no, no problem, we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna create a new one,\n\n792\n00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.510\ncuz I thought we already had it in there,\n\n793\n00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.020\nI thought we already put it in,\nbut I guess not.\n\n794\n00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.380\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\ncreate one.\n\n795\n00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.050\nDoesn't mean we're gonna create a brand\nnew account in AD, we're just gonna create\n\n796\n00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.280\nthe account and bring it in, in other\nwords it's gonna go naming and grabbing,\n\n797\n00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.520\nin other words, what we're gonna do.\n\n798\n00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.480\nSo you'll see here we have the ability\nto be able to name the account using\n\n799\n00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.500\nthe domain/username format, so\n\n800\n00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.760\nwe're gonna do yourdomain/administrator,\nput it in and then specify the password.\n\n801\n00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:03.583\nSo we're gonna go do that so let me\njust do that in, that is going to be\n\n802\n00:38:03.583 --> 00:38:08.933\nthe following, we are going to use\n[SOUND], practice labs administrator.\n\n803\n00:38:08.933 --> 00:38:10.570\nOkay, so we're just going to go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n804\n00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.770\nSo that is going to be.\n\n805\n00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:12.860\nActually let's go browse.\n\n806\n00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.980\nIt'll be easier than us typing.\n\n807\n00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.025\nAnd administrator, and\ndo a check name there.\n\n808\n00:38:20.025 --> 00:38:23.665\nClick okay because I'm too\nlazy to type in the domain.\n\n809\n00:38:23.665 --> 00:38:28.015\nAnd then for password we're going to\ntype in the word password lower case.\n\n810\n00:38:28.015 --> 00:38:29.565\nVery, very secure password.\n\n811\n00:38:29.565 --> 00:38:31.155\nDon't mention that to anybody by the way.\n\n812\n00:38:31.155 --> 00:38:33.435\nDon't want them to know what that is.\n\n813\n00:38:33.435 --> 00:38:36.755\nAnd then we have this little verified\n\n814\n00:38:36.755 --> 00:38:39.675\nbutton here which is going\nto be important for us.\n\n815\n00:38:39.675 --> 00:38:42.360\nWhy do we think we should verify?\n\n816\n00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.690\nWhat's gonna happen when we verify?\n\n817\n00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.660\nLet's open that up so\nyou can see what happens.\n\n818\n00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.130\nWe're gonna check whether or\nnot we can go out and hit the machine.\n\n819\n00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.190\nRight, hit a share so\nthat this account is active.\n\n820\n00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.730\nWe know it's good.\n\n821\n00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:52.830\nThe password's right.\n\n822\n00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.750\nWe don't have to verify,\nbut if we don't verify and\n\n823\n00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:57.090\nsomething's wrong, we're gonna be\nwaiting an awful long time for\n\n824\n00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.920\nthe installs to fail and have to trouble\nshoot to figure out the obvious.\n\n825\n00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.620\nIf we do it now, and we check it,\nand we find out it's wrong,\n\n826\n00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.788\nwe could just blame Mike, and move on.\n\n827\n00:39:03.788 --> 00:39:04.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And everything will be good, so\n\n828\n00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.600\nit won't be a problem.\n\n829\n00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.200\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna fix\nthat, and we're gonna actually verify.\n\n830\n00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.720\nSo we're gonna go and\nwe're gonna verify, we're gonna go and\n\n831\n00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.600\nconnect to a data source or\na network share, or whatever it may be.\n\n832\n00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.089\nWe'd specify what it is,\nand put in test connection.\n\n833\n00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:23.319\nSo we'll just browse out there real quick,\nand\n\n834\n00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:29.349\nwe'll put in our p-l-a-b-d-c-a-1 machine.\n\n835\n00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:32.541\nLet's just see if we\ncan find that machine.\n\n836\n00:39:32.541 --> 00:39:38.363\nOkay no big deal,\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n837\n00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.200\n>> So that's there.\n\n838\n00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.170\nAll right, yeah.\n\n839\n00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:46.840\nSo we got it in there, and you can see we\nhave that so you could see it in there.\n\n840\n00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.578\nSo now that we've done that,\nwhat we're gonna do is\n\n841\n00:39:51.578 --> 00:39:56.651\njust go ahead and\nbasically click apply and click okay.\n\n842\n00:39:56.651 --> 00:40:00.864\nAnd now that we have done that, we've\neffectively set up the backend process.\n\n843\n00:40:00.864 --> 00:40:05.398\nSo now if we go over to the collections,\nso let's just go back to assets and\n\n844\n00:40:05.398 --> 00:40:06.287\ncompliance.\n\n845\n00:40:06.287 --> 00:40:11.067\nLet's come over here to collections and\nlet's, for instance, do,\n\n846\n00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:13.910\nactually wait, let's do this one here.\n\n847\n00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.369\nLet's see if we can get this one.\n\n848\n00:40:20.988 --> 00:40:24.702\nAnd you'll see that, I'll just zoom in so\nyou can see it, I right clicked and\n\n849\n00:40:24.702 --> 00:40:27.580\nyou see that we have the install\nclient option right there.\n\n850\n00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.460\nIt's highlighted.\n\n851\n00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.889\nWe could run through the wizard that would\nallow us to install the client now to\n\n852\n00:40:31.889 --> 00:40:37.475\nmembers of that collection, or\nwe could do it from up on the, Menu up on\n\n853\n00:40:37.475 --> 00:40:42.740\nthe ribbon up at the top and see install\nclient, it's point to it right there.\n\n854\n00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.440\nSo we could go ahead and we could just\nrun through a quick wizard app to drive\n\n855\n00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.120\nthe install, specify a few things.\n\n856\n00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.130\nAnd we'll take a look at it just\nto show you what it looks like.\n\n857\n00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.120\nAnd we would then be able\nto do that if we wanted to.\n\n858\n00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:57.790\nSo, if we do install client here, real\nquick, we get our install client wizard.\n\n859\n00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.700\nThis is just a welcome screen,\nreally nothing of importance there.\n\n860\n00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.074\nWe then have to specify.\n\n861\n00:41:05.117 --> 00:41:08.780\nYou'll see that we are hard coding allowed\nto be installed on domain controllers.\n\n862\n00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.745\nIt's grayed out because we've\nalready done that in the set up.\n\n863\n00:41:10.745 --> 00:41:12.050\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Allow install,\n\n864\n00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:13.620\nalways install the client's software.\n\n865\n00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.910\nSo if there's an earlier version or\nversion that may be corrupt,\n\n866\n00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.400\nwe can repair it on the fly.\n\n867\n00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.260\nSo we have that.\n\n868\n00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.160\nInstall the client's software from\na specified site, that's grayed out.\n\n869\n00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.410\nThat's hard coded, so\nwe have our site code there as well.\n\n870\n00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:25.730\nSo we already got most of that done.\n\n871\n00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:26.780\nWe're just gonna click Next.\n\n872\n00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.120\nYou'll see we get a couple of errors\nin there that I mentioned in one of\n\n873\n00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.930\nthe previous demos about the fact that\nmost of those machines don't exist.\n\n874\n00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:33.900\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah, it's okay, no big deal.\n\n875\n00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.260\nWe'll click Next.\n\n876\n00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.230\nAnd it goes ahead.\n\n877\n00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:43.670\nIt says, okay, summary of and\nyou could see the things that did work.\n\n878\n00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:44.280\nYes.\nYes.\n\n879\n00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:44.780\nYes.\n\n880\n00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.050\nTotally resources, 10.\n\n881\n00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.540\nBut then some of the resources are not\nassigned to any site, that's okay.\n\n882\n00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.310\nAny of them are not, number of resources.\n\n883\n00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.810\nOops, I see what you mean\nabout that touch thing.\n\n884\n00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:54.666\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n885\n00:41:54.666 --> 00:41:57.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> Number of resources that are not\n\n886\n00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.410\nsupported for client push.\n\n887\n00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:01.080\nSo it just goes ahead and tells us\nthat some of them will be installed,\n\n888\n00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:01.880\nsome will not be.\n\n889\n00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.825\nSo that's okay, no big,\nthere we go, no big deal.\n\n890\n00:42:04.825 --> 00:42:06.125\nBut at least we just showed you more or\n\n891\n00:42:06.125 --> 00:42:07.995\nless what the wizard looks like\nto be able to kick that off.\n\n892\n00:42:07.995 --> 00:42:09.295\nSo that's effectively all you would do.\n\n893\n00:42:09.295 --> 00:42:12.835\nAnd then from there, then about 10 or 15\nminutes the clients start being deployed\n\n894\n00:42:12.835 --> 00:42:16.025\nout, the agents start being deployed out\nto various machines that we're targeting.\n\n895\n00:42:16.025 --> 00:42:17.665\nYou'd be able to see that kick off,\n\n896\n00:42:17.665 --> 00:42:22.425\nby the way, if you were curious,\nby being able to do the following.\n\n897\n00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.669\nIf you go to Task Manager and\nin Task Manager,\n\n898\n00:42:28.669 --> 00:42:35.710\nyou look for\nIt's probably not gonna be here right now.\n\n899\n00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:39.070\nYou've got a whole bunch of\nsystem center processes but\n\n900\n00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:42.080\nwe would be looking for CCMSetup.exe.\n\n901\n00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.510\nI'm just gonna quickly look and\nsee if it's started yet.\n\n902\n00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.990\nBut if you find ccmsetup.exe,\nthen you would actually\n\n903\n00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.950\nsee the installation of\nthe client agent kicking off.\n\n904\n00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.470\nI doubt we're gonna see\nours kick off this quickly.\n\n905\n00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:56.330\nBut you would just monitor for it.\n\n906\n00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.385\nAnd this would be one of the ways that\nyou could tell that it's running.\n\n907\n00:42:58.385 --> 00:42:59.530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, I don't see it yet.\n\n908\n00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:00.810\nWe're not gonna sit around and\nwait for it.\n\n909\n00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:01.900\nBut you have the general idea.\n\n910\n00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.590\nI just thought we might be able to\ncatch it if it started up right away.\n\n911\n00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:08.190\nSo we'd be able to see that, but\nthat's what we were looking for there.\n\n912\n00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.060\nNow we could also do a manual install,\nright?\n\n913\n00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.670\nWe can actually go grab the ccmsetup.exe,\nand\n\n914\n00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:15.450\njust click on it and run it,\nI don't think I have to demo that one,\n\n915\n00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.050\nI think just telling you guys about\nthat probably makes a lot of sense, so\n\n916\n00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:20.300\nyou could easily figure\nout how that one happened.\n\n917\n00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.760\nWe could do a log on script, we could\nactually write a log on script and\n\n918\n00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.030\nthat might be a little involved because\nthe script itself would take a fair amount\n\n919\n00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.800\nof typing.\n\n920\n00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.360\nBut we could set up and\ncreate a logon script and\n\n921\n00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.890\ndeploy that as well if we wanted to.\n\n922\n00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:33.490\nSo it would be another way to do this.\n\n923\n00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.540\nIf you want to get into the logon\nscripting, you actually can go out on\n\n924\n00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.540\nthe Internet, you can google for sample\nlogon scripts, there are some out there.\n\n925\n00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.370\nMicrosoft has some out there as well.\n\n926\n00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.800\nAnd you can actually just grab one,\nuse it as a template and\n\n927\n00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.650\nthen do the deployment based on that.\n\n928\n00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.480\nWe talked about the fact that we also\ncould include this in the operating\n\n929\n00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.430\nsystem image.\n\n930\n00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.990\nWe're not going to get into how that works\nbecause that's a little involved for\n\n931\n00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.990\nthis discussion.\n\n932\n00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:59.800\nWe will be doing an event or rather\na live demo and a what do we call them?\n\n933\n00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.300\nEpisodes right?\n\n934\n00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.830\nThat's what we call them\nthank you very much.\n\n935\n00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.030\nWe call them episodes.\n\n936\n00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:04.990\nWe'll have one of those,\nwhatever those things are.\n\n937\n00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.860\nWe'll have an episode later on\ncoming up where we actually demo\n\n938\n00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.800\nthe operating system deployment\nfeatures and show you how to build out\n\n939\n00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.230\nan operating system image and\nwe'll do a deployment there.\n\n940\n00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.780\nAt least we'll start one off and\ngive you a sense of what it looks like.\n\n941\n00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.110\nWe can obviously integrate the client\nagent software into that as a schedule\n\n942\n00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.120\ntask and sequence it and we could actually\ndeploy it through there as well, so\n\n943\n00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.090\nwe have a lot of different options, lot\nof different ways to go about doing this.\n\n944\n00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:27.230\n>> Fantastic, and\nwe got to get that agent out there,\n\n945\n00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.320\nnow we know we've got several different\nways, make it part of our image,\n\n946\n00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.130\nwe could do a log on script,\nwe can install it manually,\n\n947\n00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:37.950\nwe can do group palsy, or we can do a push\nthrough that SCCN console, very cool Adam,\n\n948\n00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.320\nappreciate those demonstrations,\nlike that, hope you guys enjoyed watching.\n\n949\n00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.810\nRemember, if you want to attend\none of Adam's classes live\n\n950\n00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:47.140\nshoot us an email here at\nsee Adam at IT Pro dot TV.\n\n951\n00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.850\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n952\n00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:50.490\n>> I am Adam Gordon.\n\n953\n00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:51.340\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n954\n00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.192\n>> I'm not George, I'm Adam.\n\n955\n00:44:52.192 --> 00:44:54.292\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I almost said that.\n\n956\n00:44:54.292 --> 00:45:00.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.256\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:21.100\nToday we're doing our SCCM 2012 R2.\n\n5\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.520\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.430\nwe're going to be dealing\nwith that client agent.\n\n7\n00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.810\nWe've talked about different ways\nthat we can deploy that client, but\n\n8\n00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.450\nwe've got to be able to manage it as well,\nwe've got to understand some prereqs for\n\n9\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.810\nit, and where the heck we\ncan actually deploy it too.\n\n10\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.140\nSo here to help us with\nall that is Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.160\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.880\n>> Good, I thought we were\nhere to talk about coffee.\n\n13\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.120\n>> Yeah, we could talk about coffee.\n\n14\n00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.430\nEspresso, what's your preference?\n\n15\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.800\n>> Did you send the valet driver out for\ncoffee, is that why he's not around?\n\n16\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.524\n>> [LAUGH] That's where he is, yeah,\nhe's stuck in line at Starbucks.\n\n17\n00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:50.080\n>> He's stuck at Starbucks, trying to get,\n\n18\n00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.464\ntrying to get coffee in the drive\nthrough line at Starbucks.\n\n19\n00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:53.583\nIt's an all day commitment.\n\n20\n00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:54.720\nAll right, so anyway.\n\n21\n00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.550\nLittle inside joke.\n\n22\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.885\nPlease, please don't pay any attention to\nthat at all, it's just us being silly.\n\n23\n00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:00.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're here to talk about\n\n24\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.480\nclient requirements.\n\n25\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.280\nAnd as Mike was saying, you know we've\ntalked a lot about deployment methods,\n\n26\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.410\nwe talked about how to set up all\nthe architecture of the plumbing,\n\n27\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.050\nplan all that out, get that all set up.\n\n28\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.960\nWe just went through how to do\ngroup policy based deployment,\n\n29\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.330\ntalked about how to do a manual push,\ntalked about potentially how to do log on\n\n30\n00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.830\nscript based deployments, and\nall the different methods, so\n\n31\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.410\nwe've gotten agent out there in theory,\nnow what we are going to focus on and\n\n32\n00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.160\nspend some time on is how do we\nactually configure the agent settings.\n\n33\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.110\nSo the agent starts doing what it\nis we actually would like it to do,\n\n34\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.750\nwhich is more than just show up on the\nendpoint and say hey I'm here, surprise.\n\n35\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.320\nWe actually want it to do some work for\nus, do the heavy lifting of\n\n36\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.520\nconfiguration management, asset management\nand report back on all those things.\n\n37\n00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.920\nSo we're gonna take some time to go in and\ntake a look at those settings in detail,\n\n38\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.800\nbut before we go and\n\n39\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.785\ndo that, what we wanna do,\nset the stage a little bit right.\n\n40\n00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:53.215\nGive you some information,\nlet you chew on that.\n\n41\n00:01:53.215 --> 00:01:55.615\nThink about what it is we're\nactually trying to accomplish.\n\n42\n00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.855\nAnd most importantly the parameters and\nthe requirements around doing that.\n\n43\n00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:00.385\nAnd then we'll go in and\nwe'll have a little fun.\n\n44\n00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:02.205\nWe'll take a look at it\nin the interface and\n\n45\n00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.137\nwe'll wrap it all up in a nice pretty bow.\n\n46\n00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:06.947\nWe talk about how policy gets pushed down\n\n47\n00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:09.777\nfrom the management point down\nto the client and back again.\n\n48\n00:02:09.777 --> 00:02:12.557\nFor updates, Mike's got a nice\ngraphic he puts together for us.\n\n49\n00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:13.337\nShow us how to do that.\n\n50\n00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:15.787\nAnd we'll wrap up by talking about that.\n\n51\n00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:19.167\nIf we could go and take a look at some\nof the information Mike has sitting\n\n52\n00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:22.257\non his screen, it's gonna help\nus to drive this conversation.\n\n53\n00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:26.620\nSo device requirements are gonna help\nus to figure out what Windows based,\n\n54\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.390\nWindows based client agents are going\nto look like, be managed by, and\n\n55\n00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.130\nas result of that have some you know\njust default configuration settings and\n\n56\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.980\nconcerns that we want to be aware of.\n\n57\n00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.040\nWe've got that information\nup on the screen.\n\n58\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.080\nThis is going to be what a Windows\nbased endpoint is going to need to make\n\n59\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.140\nin terms of the minimum requirements\nand/or meet in terms of prereqs for\n\n60\n00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.090\nus to be able to install the.\n\n61\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.710\nYou'll notice we can run anything\nwith Windows XP SP3 or later,\n\n62\n00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.350\nWindows XP x64 SP2.\n\n63\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.650\nSo XP SP3 would be on the 32 bit side.\n\n64\n00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.672\nXP x64 SP2 at a minimum\non the client side.\n\n65\n00:03:01.672 --> 00:03:05.660\nWindows server 2003 SP2 and\nnewer on the server side.\n\n66\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.336\nIt's good that we have all those operating\nsystems that we no longer support\n\n67\n00:03:08.336 --> 00:03:09.004\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:10.839\n>> Still right there at the top of\n\n69\n00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:11.504\nthe list.\n\n70\n00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:14.924\nNow obviously you know the reality\nwhile you still may have some XP,\n\n71\n00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:17.324\nmay still have some server 2003 deployed,\n\n72\n00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:21.420\nthose operating systems are no longer\nconsidered to be supported my Microsoft.\n\n73\n00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.020\nServer 2003 was dropped earlier\nin 2015 around summertime, and\n\n74\n00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.920\nXP a little bit prior to that.\n\n75\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.476\nActually by the way Microsoft's getting\nready to drop support formally for IE 8,\n\n76\n00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:34.650\nIE 9, and IE 10.\n\n77\n00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.910\nIt's coming up actually in the very\nbeginning of January 2016.\n\n78\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.735\nWithin the fist two weeks I believe,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n79\n00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:42.835\nActually, what would it be.\n\n80\n00:03:42.835 --> 00:03:43.575\nWhat is today?\n\n81\n00:03:43.575 --> 00:03:46.128\n[CROSSTALK] Today is Tuesday,\ntoday is Wednesday, so\n\n82\n00:03:46.128 --> 00:03:50.003\nit would be I think on the 12th if I'm\nnot mistaken, of January, of 2016.\n\n83\n00:03:50.003 --> 00:03:51.980\nThey have dropped by\nthe time you hear this and\n\n84\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.750\nsee this most likely you're not watching\nit live, then we'll have done it already.\n\n85\n00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.702\nBut they are actually dropping support for\nIE 8, 9 and\n\n86\n00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:02.160\n10 because they want to push\neverybody into, God help us all,\n\n87\n00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.800\nthe Edge browser and IE 11, because\nwe know both of those work so well.\n\n88\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.016\nWith the lab environment\nthat we are using.\n\n89\n00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:12.040\nSo as a result of that,\ngood luck is all I have to say.\n\n90\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.270\nThey are moving to push everybody\ninto those late-stage browsers.\n\n91\n00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.860\nAnd they already have dropped support for\n2003.\n\n92\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.140\nBut when server 16 comes\nout later in 2016,\n\n93\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.765\nserver 2008 will be on the chopping\nblock shortly thereafter as well.\n\n94\n00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:28.672\nSo we do see a cycle and\na turnover in these OS's in real time.\n\n95\n00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:32.108\nWe are still reaching backward and\nsupporting them in theory right now on\n\n96\n00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:36.221\nthe platform, but the reality is if you're\nrunning these things in production you may\n\n97\n00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:39.879\nstill clearly have a reason to manage\nthem, but you should have an exit plan,\n\n98\n00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.881\nand really a remediation to move off those\noperating systems and really roll forward\n\n99\n00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:47.146\ninto something, at a bare minimum like,\nWindows 7 on the desktop,\n\n100\n00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:51.922\nI would say Windows Vista but people might\nstart throwing things at the screen.\n\n101\n00:04:51.922 --> 00:04:54.640\nI happen to like Windows Vista a lot.\n\n102\n00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.430\nAnd ran it for quite a long time and only\nrecently got off it to go to Windows 7.\n\n103\n00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.650\nBecause I had to change\nout one of my systems for\n\n104\n00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.900\none of the hard drives blew up and\nI wasn't able to easily reimage and\n\n105\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.830\ndo the whole thing I needed\nto do to bring it up.\n\n106\n00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.700\nSo I went up and saw Windows 7 but\nmyself and Sheldon Cooper,\n\n107\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.910\nI think are the only two\npeople on the planet.\n\n108\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.240\nOne of which is real, one is not.\n\n109\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.490\nYou get to choose which is which.\n\n110\n00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.620\nBy the way but the two people on the\nplanet that actually will admit in public.\n\n111\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.460\n>> Right.\n>> And I don't get paid to admit it, but\n\n112\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.770\nhe does, a great deal of\nmoney apparently by episode.\n\n113\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.360\nBut I did not get paid to admit\nthat I actually like Windows Vista.\n\n114\n00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.320\nI thought it was a great operating system.\n\n115\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.140\nSo I keep good company\ncuz Sheldon is cool.\n\n116\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.010\n>> He is very cool.\n\n117\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.330\n>> Yeah.\nSo if you're not running Windows Vista But\n\n118\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.710\nour running Window 7, Windows 8, Windows\n8.1, Windows 10 obviously going forward\n\n119\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.020\nas soon as we an update or\na patch for that into the new system.\n\n120\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.760\nBut those kind of operating systems\nwill be supported on the Windows side.\n\n121\n00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.950\nSo what do we need from\na prereq software area?\n\n122\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.680\nWindows Installer version blah blah blah,\nwhatever's up on the screen or newer.\n\n123\n00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.535\nWhen I say blah blah blah,\nthat is a technical term.\n\n124\n00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:51.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You are only allowed to\n\n125\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.620\nuse that if you are certified.\n\n126\n00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.090\nAnd have taken the official blah,\n\n127\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.260\nblah, blah oath, and swear that you will\nuse it appropriately in all circumstances.\n\n128\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.990\n>> Oh, I'm in trouble then.\n\n129\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.615\n>> Then you should not be saying,\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n130\n00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:03.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what do we need to know?\n\n131\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.290\nIf you are studying for the exam,\n\n132\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.710\nwould you wanna know the exact\nWindows Installer version number?\n\n133\n00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.540\nNo, don't waste your time.\n\n134\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.210\nWhat you should know generically, however,\nis that we do have prereq software.\n\n135\n00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.040\nThat includes the Windows Installer,\nthat includes the things like\n\n136\n00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.930\nthe Windows Update Agent, the Core XML\nServices, .NET Framework, Silverlight.\n\n137\n00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.140\nYou have the redistributable C++ or\nC# package.\n\n138\n00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.530\nSo you just wanna make sure you're\naware of those things, generically.\n\n139\n00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.724\nWe dont tend to spend a huge amount\nof time focusing on something like\n\n140\n00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:35.293\na versioning number on a build for\n\n141\n00:06:35.293 --> 00:06:37.714\nsomething like that when\nwe tend to ask questions.\n\n142\n00:06:37.714 --> 00:06:41.462\nWe tend to focus at a slightly\nhigher level with regard to\n\n143\n00:06:41.462 --> 00:06:45.790\nare there prereqa definitely is\nthere a minimum OS definitely.\n\n144\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.000\nShould we know what the minimum OS is?\n\n145\n00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.690\nProbably gonna be more likely to see\nthat than we would a build number\n\n146\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.290\non something like a Windows Installer\nversion, when we're thinking, excuse me,\n\n147\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.320\nthinking about the exams.\n\n148\n00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.430\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n149\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.470\nSo we have device requirements for\nWindows-based installs.\n\n150\n00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.460\nWhat about configuration support\nsolutions, or things we have to consider\n\n151\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.570\nif we're gonna run virtual\ndesktop infrastructure, or VDI?\n\n152\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.230\nWe may need to actually, because I think\nI'm cutting off part of the words in\n\n153\n00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.350\nthe screen,\nas a matter of fact I know I am.\n\n154\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.590\nSo we may just want to move that out\na little bit cuz you're gonna lose,\n\n155\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.860\nyeah we are losing part of that.\n\n156\n00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.940\nSo, well we have to do the sign,\nwait for me to do the sign.\n\n157\n00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.440\nReady?\n>> There it is.\n\n158\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.460\n>> Travis, ready, I'm gonna do this.\n\n159\n00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.275\nReady one, two, three?\n\n160\n00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.720\n[NOISE]\n>> Ooh.\n\n161\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.315\n>> Oh look, awesome.\n\n162\n00:07:24.315 --> 00:07:26.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Teamwork that is, right there.\n\n163\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.500\nAll right, so, we got RDS.\n\n164\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.930\nRDS stands for Remote-\n>> Desktop Services.\n\n165\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.420\n>> Remote desktop services.\n\n166\n00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.700\nSo when we're thinking about VDI,\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure, and\n\n167\n00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.450\nwe're thinking about\nremote desktop services,\n\n168\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.520\nwhich is Microsoft's- Terminal\nservices hosting platform these days.\n\n169\n00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.970\nOld school would be T astral services.\n\n170\n00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.980\nThese days remote desktop services.\n\n171\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.070\nThe config manager client agent is\ngonna be installed once and only once,\n\n172\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.110\nas you can see there.\n\n173\n00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.045\nAt the remote desktop session host,\nall features are fully supported.\n\n174\n00:07:54.045 --> 00:07:57.771\nSo all instances we spin up through there,\nwe have the benefit of using the agent,\n\n175\n00:07:57.771 --> 00:07:59.722\nwhich is kind of cool, makes it real easy.\n\n176\n00:07:59.722 --> 00:08:01.134\nPrivate virtual machines,\n\n177\n00:08:01.134 --> 00:08:05.260\nwe're thinking about virtualization\nthrough a center virtual machine manager.\n\n178\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.722\nAnd through a Hyper-V on the host side.\n\n179\n00:08:07.722 --> 00:08:11.133\nWe may virtualize in other platforms,\nbut this is Microsoft-centric,\n\n180\n00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:14.104\nwe're thinking about Microsoft\ninfrastructure right now, so\n\n181\n00:08:14.104 --> 00:08:18.050\nwhen we talk about virtualization and\nVMs, we're talking about them in Hyper-V.\n\n182\n00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.850\nConfig Manager client agent is installed\non each VM, all features are supported.\n\n183\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.406\nSo, again, full support for VDI, full\nsupport for VMs that are not VDI based but\n\n184\n00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:27.616\njust are normal VMs.\n\n185\n00:08:27.616 --> 00:08:29.764\nAnd then if we have\npooled virtual machines,\n\n186\n00:08:29.764 --> 00:08:32.860\nConfig Manager agents installed\non each virtual machine.\n\n187\n00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.754\nAnd software agent, the hardware\ninventory, software inventory, and\n\n188\n00:08:36.754 --> 00:08:41.402\nsoftware metering data may not actually be\nrelevant, because a pooled virtual machine\n\n189\n00:08:41.402 --> 00:08:43.992\nis basically a cloned instance for\nVDI, right?\n\n190\n00:08:43.992 --> 00:08:48.700\nSo, from that perspective, we are seeing\ndifferencing disks being used to spit\n\n191\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.867\nout multiple copies against a hard\nwired back end hard drive in effect.\n\n192\n00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:55.208\nAnd then we just store those\ndifferencing disks, and\n\n193\n00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:57.295\nthose files that we create separately.\n\n194\n00:08:57.295 --> 00:09:01.675\nSo we may not be as concerned about some\nof that stuff in pooled virtual instances,\n\n195\n00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:04.835\nbut in general, we do support the\ncapabilities using virtual infrastructure,\n\n196\n00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:05.905\nso it's good to be aware of that.\n\n197\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.693\nWhen we think about supporting, or\nconsiderations around supporting,\n\n198\n00:09:10.693 --> 00:09:13.637\nInternet-based clients, we want to,\nand I think we do have a,\n\n199\n00:09:13.637 --> 00:09:14.739\nthere you go thank you.\n\n200\n00:09:14.739 --> 00:09:15.611\nThat thing, whatever that is.\n\n201\n00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:17.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That thing right there, that thing.\n\n202\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.326\nWe do have a pretty picture to\ntalk about Internet-based clients.\n\n203\n00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:21.533\nWe want to start with the picture.\n\n204\n00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:26.346\nWe'll come back to the considerations but\nlet's just begin by talking about what\n\n205\n00:09:26.346 --> 00:09:30.388\nwe think of in kind of laying out\na schematic here for us to consider and\n\n206\n00:09:30.388 --> 00:09:31.880\nchew on a little bit.\n\n207\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.511\nI like the flourish, by the way,\nwith the red firewall.\n\n208\n00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:35.607\n>> [LAUGH] You like that.\n\n209\n00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:38.347\n>> I was thinking personally I\nwould have gone with an auburn or\n\n210\n00:09:38.347 --> 00:09:39.388\nperhaps a burnt orange.\n\n211\n00:09:39.388 --> 00:09:41.659\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is the fall season.\n\n212\n00:09:41.659 --> 00:09:42.617\n>> That is true.\n\n213\n00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:45.040\n>> Would have been appropriate,\nwe're not quite in spring yet.\n\n214\n00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.020\nRed's a little bold of a statement there.\n\n215\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.868\nBut you're carrying that off beautifully.\n\n216\n00:09:49.868 --> 00:09:51.617\nI do commend you for that.\n\n217\n00:09:51.617 --> 00:09:54.059\nIt's an excellent choice, sir.\n\n218\n00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:56.030\nSo, when we are looking at this,\n\n219\n00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.510\nwhat we're thinking of here,\nis we are thinking of, what do we do\n\n220\n00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.310\nif we have a client that's sitting out\non the Internet, beyond the firewall?\n\n221\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.580\nNotice the red firewall by the way, right?\n\n222\n00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.860\nSo we see the firewall there,\n\n223\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.430\nif the client is out beyond the firewall,\nout somewhere on the LAN and\n\n224\n00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.058\nwe're gonna manage it, because we do\nhave a Internet-based client support.\n\n225\n00:10:14.058 --> 00:10:17.880\nAnd with SCCM, we can manage clients\nthan are out remotely on the Internet.\n\n226\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.330\nBut we may not be able to manage them,\nindeed we do not mange them,\n\n227\n00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.570\nthe same exact way that we do for\nclient's inside, because outside,\n\n228\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.580\nthey have to come in and prove who\nthey are and we have to trust them.\n\n229\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.380\nAnd trust usually implies?\n\n230\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.250\n>> Authentication.\n\n231\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.202\n>> Authentication and authentication via?\n\n232\n00:10:32.202 --> 00:10:33.201\n>> Certificates.\n\n233\n00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:34.867\n>> Certificates, with a?\n\n234\n00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:37.137\n>> Public key infrastructure.\n>> PKI, public key infrastructure,\n\n235\n00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.910\nin order to do that, right?\n\n236\n00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.540\nSo we are gonna have to add some\nadditional things in here to the mix.\n\n237\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.280\nAnd I know you've got our certificate\ninfrastructure sitting off up there on\n\n238\n00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.200\nthe right-hand side.\n\n239\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.110\nWe're gonna zoom in and\ntake a look at that as well.\n\n240\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.920\nSo let's start if we can,\nyeah, let's zoom in.\n\n241\n00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.200\nLet's go to the lower left.\n\n242\n00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.870\nNo, no, lower left.\n\n243\n00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.360\nLet's start with the client there.\n\n244\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.330\nSo we see the client system that's\nout on the Internet with PKI issued\n\n245\n00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.200\nclient certificate.\n\n246\n00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.520\nThe certificate's kinda sitting up\nabove the client machine there, so\n\n247\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.530\nwe can see that.\n\n248\n00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.560\nSo what Mike has done is in fact we\njust put a workstation out there for\n\n249\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.970\nus, and throw the certificate\nonto the machine in effect,\n\n250\n00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.340\nbinding it there is what we're implying.\n\n251\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.410\nAnd that PKI issued certificate,\nand we're gonna quickly review and\n\n252\n00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.730\ntalk about how we actually issue\ncertificates through PKI as part of this\n\n253\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:23.560\nprocess, but that's already been set up\nand attached in effect to that machine.\n\n254\n00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.550\nNow that's outside the firewall, we see an\ninbound arrow representing traffic coming\n\n255\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.410\ninto the environment we\nhave in the middle there.\n\n256\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.250\nLet's just go up a little bit so\nwe can see what's above the globe.\n\n257\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.835\nWe have our primary site,\nour primary site is gonna be,\n\n258\n00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:39.685\nthe firewall applies to sitting behind the\nfirewall and the LAN, we didn't put out\n\n259\n00:11:39.685 --> 00:11:43.334\nkind of the boundary with the cloud and\nthe whole nine yards to represent that.\n\n260\n00:11:43.334 --> 00:11:47.977\nBut you guys would hopefully get the idea\nthat the client is gonna be outside,\n\n261\n00:11:47.977 --> 00:11:50.201\nthe primary site is gonna be inside.\n\n262\n00:11:50.201 --> 00:11:54.543\nAnd the reality is that we are simply\nlooking at a primary site server\n\n263\n00:11:54.543 --> 00:11:58.290\nsitting inside of a LAN somewhere\nprotected behind a DMZ.\n\n264\n00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.100\nEven though we haven't gone to all\nthe trouble of putting all that into\n\n265\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.570\nthe diagram, but\nthat's kind of the implied message there.\n\n266\n00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.830\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n267\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.630\nWe obviously are gonna have that primary\nsite server be able to communicate with\n\n268\n00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.530\nthat client and validate that client's\nidentity by using that certificate.\n\n269\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.130\nSo that's happening there.\n\n270\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.830\nOff to the right,\nwe have our PKI infrastructure.\n\n271\n00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.350\nWe have our Root CA,\nwhere the Root CA certificate sits.\n\n272\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.716\nWe have a issuing, or subordinate,\nCA, we confer to it differently,\n\n273\n00:12:23.716 --> 00:12:25.242\nit's basically the same idea.\n\n274\n00:12:25.242 --> 00:12:28.863\nThe issuing CA is actually issuing the\ncertificate out, and it's probably issuing\n\n275\n00:12:28.863 --> 00:12:32.230\nthe certificates out to the client,\nwe don't have an arrow indicating that.\n\n276\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.316\nBut that's fine, we know that that's gonna\nhappen, cuz this is kind of two separate\n\n277\n00:12:36.316 --> 00:12:39.910\ndiagrams that are effectively being\nsuper imposed to represent one idea.\n\n278\n00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.808\nAnd so the idea there is that the\ncertificate that's issued from the issuing\n\n279\n00:12:44.808 --> 00:12:48.420\nCA is gonna wind up on the client and\nbe used to validate the client's identity.\n\n280\n00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.260\nSo that way all the secure web\nservices that are being consumed and\n\n281\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.810\nused are going to effectively\nutilize HTTPS to be secure, and\n\n282\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.174\nwe can use digital certificates\nin order to drive that.\n\n283\n00:12:58.174 --> 00:13:03.540\nSo supporting Internet-based clients is\ngonna require the fact that we must have\n\n284\n00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.660\na PKI solution in place, and\n\n285\n00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.590\nbe able to issue certificates that\ncan be self signed internally.\n\n286\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.770\nOr we can choose to go out and\npurchase them, it really is up to us, but\n\n287\n00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.310\nwe do have that capability, and\n\n288\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.710\nwe are gonna have to have that in order\nto manage those Internet-based clients.\n\n289\n00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.000\nSo, we do have a little list of\nthe things that we need to have, and\n\n290\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.260\nI know we have that set up.\n\n291\n00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.010\nSo considerations for\nsupporting Internet-based clients, we\n\n292\n00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:27.150\nhave the Internet-based clients requiring\nthe PKI, Microsoft Certificate services,\n\n293\n00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.750\nalong with their templates, can be used\nto simplify certificate enrollment.\n\n294\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:36.900\nThe default certificate type will be\nX509V3, X.509V3 for version three.\n\n295\n00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.170\nAll systems must trust the Root CA.\n\n296\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.470\nSo they have to trust\nthe issuing Root CA in the PKI.\n\n297\n00:13:43.845 --> 00:13:46.358\nInternet-facing roles will\nrequire a certificate.\n\n298\n00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:50.880\nSo the IIS web services that are gonna be\nservicing those clients through the site\n\n299\n00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.910\nsystem role will have to have a\ncertificate associated with them as well.\n\n300\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.810\nWe showed that with the globe,\n\n301\n00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.310\na little certificate that was at\nthe bottom of the slide there.\n\n302\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.450\nAnd then client systems use a certificate\nfor authentication as we said.\n\n303\n00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.496\nSo wanna make sure we know all the dos and\n\n304\n00:14:02.496 --> 00:14:06.280\ndon'ts there associated with\nInternet-based client support.\n\n305\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.030\nWe also wanna talk a bit about\nmobile device support, right?\n\n306\n00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.070\nWe got some stuff for mobile devices.\n\n307\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.890\nWe support a wide range of mobile devices.\n\n308\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.830\nI hinted at this in one of our very\nfirst episodes, where we talked about\n\n309\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.800\nthe Exchange ActiveSync controller,\nand the fact that that's in there or\n\n310\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.110\nthe Exchange connector rather and\nthe ActiveSync connector.\n\n311\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.770\nAnd the fact that we can use that to\nbring in non-Windows-based devices and\n\n312\n00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:26.660\nstill manage them.\n\n313\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.630\nSo you'll see here,\n\n314\n00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.580\nwe support Windows phone mobile\ndevice platform on the Windows side.\n\n315\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.878\nWindows RT, so the Surface tablets,\niOS devices are supported,\n\n316\n00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:37.740\nWindows Mobile 6 or newer.\n\n317\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.530\nSo we have that.\n\n318\n00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.360\nWe have Windows CE.\n\n319\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.640\nSo the embedded 5.0 and newer.\n\n320\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.220\nWe have the Nokia Symbian solutions, so\n\n321\n00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.498\nthere are our solutions although it's\nnot very prevalent much anymore.\n\n322\n00:14:48.498 --> 00:14:51.300\nWe do have limited support for\ndevices through ActiveSync, so\n\n323\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.230\nBlackberry comes in,\nAndroid comes in, etc.\n\n324\n00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.580\nWe may not be able to do\neverything that we want to do, but\n\n325\n00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.890\nwe certainly can get a basic read on\nthe device, and manage it at some level.\n\n326\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.260\nSo we do want to be aware of that.\n\n327\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.079\nWe do need client certificates for full\nsupport there, so again we get back to\n\n328\n00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:08.159\nthis idea of PKI to have trust and\nto be able to do those things.\n\n329\n00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:10.579\nAnd if we want to support and\nmanage a mobile device,\n\n330\n00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:14.159\nwe can use the Windows Intune connector,\ntalked a bit about Windows Intune.\n\n331\n00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:17.835\nThat's the SMS or SCCM Lite that's\navailable through the cloud\n\n332\n00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:21.600\nthat we then take back control over and\nuse if we wanna integrate.\n\n333\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.126\nThat's a subscription-based service, I\nthink it's about $7 a month per device, or\n\n334\n00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:26.360\nsomething like that.\n\n335\n00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.890\nYou can then effectively get SCCM\nfunctionality through a SaaS model\n\n336\n00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.720\nfrom Microsoft directly, without having\nto implement the entire infrastructure.\n\n337\n00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.200\n>> Nice.\n>> So Windows Intune\n\n338\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.290\nis a Configuration Manager client agent.\n\n339\n00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.300\nSo depending on the mobile\ndevice platform, so\n\n340\n00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.740\nwe don't have an agent, let's say for\nthe Apple iOS devices, but\n\n341\n00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.430\nwe can bring them and manage them\nthrough the ActiveSync connector.\n\n342\n00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.520\nSo it just depends on the kind of\nmobile device we're talking about.\n\n343\n00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.090\nSome will support the Windows\nconfiguration, or\n\n344\n00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.120\nthe Configuration Manager client agent.\n\n345\n00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.680\nWindows Mobile devices, for\ninstance, right, we can do that.\n\n346\n00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.048\nBut if it's a different one,\nwe may not be able to do that.\n\n347\n00:15:59.048 --> 00:16:02.439\nWe may have a Legacy Config Manager\nclient agent from an older install or\n\n348\n00:16:02.439 --> 00:16:06.130\nthe exchange ActiveSync connector,\nwhich again, brings in some of those.\n\n349\n00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.254\nSo it just depends On how we do this,\nright?\n\n350\n00:16:08.254 --> 00:16:11.280\nWe're gonna mix and match, but\nwe are gonna see support for all of that.\n\n351\n00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.560\nWhat about when we are dealing\nwith workgroup-based clients?\n\n352\n00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.660\nBecause we may, although it's still\nrare today that we have workgroups.\n\n353\n00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.063\nWe may have workgroups in maybe\nQA environments, test dev.\n\n354\n00:16:23.063 --> 00:16:25.948\nYou have things like that where\nwe're not joined to the domain and\n\n355\n00:16:25.948 --> 00:16:29.516\nproduction directly, but we have a group\nof machines that are networked just for\n\n356\n00:16:29.516 --> 00:16:31.280\ninformation sharing purposes.\n\n357\n00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.500\nThey may have a workgroup.\n\n358\n00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.590\nSo, if we have a workgroup,\n\n359\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.180\nwe do offer the capabilities to be\nable to offer some support there.\n\n360\n00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.280\nWe do need the Configuration Manager\nclient agent to be installed.\n\n361\n00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.450\nIt obviously is gonna have to be installed\nmanually, cuz we don't have a central\n\n362\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.620\ndirectory to be able to push it out of,\nso wanna think about that.\n\n363\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.580\nNetwork access account has to be\nconfigured in the SCCM console in order to\n\n364\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.430\nbe able to drive that.\n\n365\n00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.831\nThat's the account we use to\nbe to drive the installation.\n\n366\n00:16:53.831 --> 00:16:56.790\nThat can be the computer account or\nthe domain admin account.\n\n367\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:00.640\nIn the case of the domain services,\nbecause it is not connected to a domain,\n\n368\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.560\nwe have all the local\nadmins accounts by machine.\n\n369\n00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.351\nSo we have to go around and\n\n370\n00:17:05.351 --> 00:17:07.668\nadd in an account that in fact we're\ngonna have rights to every machine.\n\n371\n00:17:07.668 --> 00:17:09.725\nSo get's a little more involved, but\n\n372\n00:17:09.725 --> 00:17:13.838\nthe features that the workgroup computers\ndo not support, in other words,\n\n373\n00:17:13.838 --> 00:17:17.300\nwhen we install the agent,\nwhat will we not be able to do?\n\n374\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.780\nClient push install, because that's gonna\ncome directly from the console based on\n\n375\n00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.260\nauthentication through AD, targeting\nusers for app deployment, because again,\n\n376\n00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.760\nwe don't have the central depository\nto authenticate them, global roaming so\n\n377\n00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.160\nwe can't roam between boundaries.\n\n378\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.240\nCuz we can't auto discover them with AD,\ncuz that doesn't exist.\n\n379\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.360\nUsing anything associated with\nAD is basically off the table.\n\n380\n00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.760\nAnd so you can see all the stuff that\nwe're saying will not be supported\n\n381\n00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.410\nis all stuff that requires\nActive Directory integration.\n\n382\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.050\nNow before we move off that, if you\nare planning on studying and preparing for\n\n383\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:49.930\nthe exam, the list of things that is off\nthe table, that we do not support for\n\n384\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.260\nsomething like workgroup-based computers\nwould be probably be valuable for\n\n385\n00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.100\nyou to be aware of.\n\n386\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.520\nThose are the kind of things again\nthat we may want to know about.\n\n387\n00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.270\n>> Very good to know.\n>> What you will often find is that we\n\n388\n00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:05.530\ntend to ask a lot of questions about off\nin the corner kind of business cases\n\n389\n00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:09.620\nthat may not be the norm for your world\n>> But Microsoft wants to know that,\n\n390\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.050\nregardless of whatever\nthe circumstances are,\n\n391\n00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.270\nthat you're gonna be\nprepared to deal with them.\n\n392\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.372\nAnd you understand that some things may or\nmay not work, and\n\n393\n00:18:17.372 --> 00:18:20.241\nyou know what those things\nare if you come across that.\n\n394\n00:18:20.241 --> 00:18:22.576\nYou may never, ever,\nin all the time you use this product,\n\n395\n00:18:22.576 --> 00:18:24.860\nhave to deal with workgroup\nbased configurations.\n\n396\n00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.200\nMost of us don't.\n\n397\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.860\nBut the reality is you still may\nneed to know that it's possible and\n\n398\n00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.290\nyou should have a sense\nof what that looks like.\n\n399\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.660\nSo, just pointing out that you may want\nto know about those things which is why\n\n400\n00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.590\nwe took the time to have\nMike type them out for you,\n\n401\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.400\nand put them up on the screen so\nwe could talk about them.\n\n402\n00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.070\nSo obviously it's going\nto be very important for\n\n403\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.650\nus to be able to tell you about that.\n\n404\n00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.240\nAll right we also have some support for\nMacintosh computers.\n\n405\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.440\nDon't want to leave out\nthe Apple Macintosh OS people out there.\n\n406\n00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.770\nAll three or four of you\nbecause you are very important.\n\n407\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.070\nWe want to make sure we account for\nyour needs because remember,\n\n408\n00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.040\nit's all about you.\n\n409\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.290\nSo, I want to make sure you know that.\n\n410\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.190\nSo, the following features are supported\nfor the Mac OSX computers.\n\n411\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.420\nWe could do hardware inventories\nyou could see there.\n\n412\n00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.790\nWe can take a look at and\ndo software based deployment.\n\n413\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.950\nWe actually could do software\ndeployment for the following formats.\n\n414\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.520\nYou see the package format's there.\n\n415\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.640\nWe have the Mac OS installer package.\n\n416\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.190\nWe have the Mac OSX application package,\nthe Apple disk image and\n\n417\n00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.380\nthe meta package file.\n\n418\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.573\nI would if I was you know\nthe extensions on those, the .pkg.\n\n419\n00:19:18.573 --> 00:19:23.881\n.APP, .DMG, d as in dog and .MPKG.\n\n420\n00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:27.600\nWant to know those and want to know what\nthe four types are that we do support.\n\n421\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.420\nAnd compliant settings, Configuration\nManager supports both the .plist files and\n\n422\n00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.700\nthe shell scripts with regards to\nMac OSX configuration and compliance.\n\n423\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.160\nSo we got a lot of support for that.\n\n424\n00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.450\nThat's relatively new.\n\n425\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.681\nThat's a 2012 R2 feature set that's\nbeen updated and really added so\n\n426\n00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.770\nwe that have full support to manage\nin cross-platform environments.\n\n427\n00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:46.440\nSo that's kind of neat.\n\n428\n00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.643\nThat's kind of new.\n\n429\n00:19:47.643 --> 00:19:48.304\n>> That is really neat.\n\n430\n00:19:48.304 --> 00:19:49.105\n>> That is kind of neat.\n\n431\n00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:49.610\nNot really neat.\n\n432\n00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.250\nSorry so many people use that.\n\n433\n00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.180\nWhat's really neat cuz more people\ndo this, is Linux-based and\n\n434\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.420\nUNIX-based computers.\n\n435\n00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.190\nHey, I can make fun of the people who\nuse Apple Macintosh Computers because\n\n436\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.480\nnumber one it is fun to make fun of them.\n\n437\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.910\nAnd number two I happen to be one of them\nwhich is why I can make fun of them.\n\n438\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.050\nI only make fun of them because\nthe reality is in the modern enterprise\n\n439\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.190\nwe still see quite a bit of this\ninfrastructure, all kidding aside.\n\n440\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.700\nBut until very recently, we have not been\nable to manage it with Microsoft gear.\n\n441\n00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.400\nAnd so it's great that Microsoft's\ngone out and actually incorporated it,\n\n442\n00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.150\nfound the value in it, because there\nis a lot of value in managing it.\n\n443\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.130\nAnd we know that there's enough of it out\nthere that it makes sense to be able to do\n\n444\n00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.550\nthat in certain environments.\n\n445\n00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.480\nAnd the fact that they've given\nus the capability to do that I\n\n446\n00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.320\nthink is phenomenal, actually, so\nit's really good that we see that.\n\n447\n00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.860\nSupporting Linux based and Unix based\ncomputers, how do we deal with those?\n\n448\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.130\nThings like RHE, Red Hat Enterprise.\n\n449\n00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:40.740\nSolaris, SUSE Linux, Debian,\nCentOS, Ubuntu, Oracle Linux,\n\n450\n00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.940\nIBM AX, IAX, HP UX for UNIX.\n\n451\n00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.370\nWe support the main line enterprise\ncapable and ready platforms.\n\n452\n00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.840\nAgain a pretty tremendous need out there.\n\n453\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.010\nFor a long time we're had a lot of this\ninfrastructure and we've had to manage it\n\n454\n00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.760\nseparately and effectively build two\nparallel asset management systems for\n\n455\n00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.530\ndifferent platforms.\n\n456\n00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.050\nIf you incorporate Apple it\ncould theoretically be three, so\n\n457\n00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.610\nthis allows us to be able to be\na little bit more focused on this.\n\n458\n00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:08.030\nSo Linux based and Unix based computers\nwill support the following features:\n\n459\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.620\nhardware inventory and\nsoftware based deployment, but\n\n460\n00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.750\nwith software based deployment user\ninteraction is not supported so\n\n461\n00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.130\nwe can basically just automate, we can't\nallow users to interact, we would call\n\n462\n00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.900\nthis a quiet deployment generically right\nhiding it from the users so we can do\n\n463\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.590\nquiet deployments but maintenance windows\nare fully supported which is great.\n\n464\n00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.200\n>> That's nice.\n\n465\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.880\n>> So we do support maintenance\nwindows across that infrastructure.\n\n466\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.880\nA lot of web hosting in particular is\ndone on Linux based solutions and so\n\n467\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.970\nbeing able to automate that process and\nhave it done with maintenance windows and\n\n468\n00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.880\nalign it with our service of agreements\nis gonna be very, very important.\n\n469\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.580\nSo we do have those capabilities but\nwe do not support user interactions so\n\n470\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.910\njust be aware of that.\n\n471\n00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.565\nThe site systems that are used\nto support client deployment,\n\n472\n00:21:46.565 --> 00:21:50.200\nyou remember we did in the last\nrun through in our last episode,\n\n473\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.710\ndo the different discussions\nabout client deployments.\n\n474\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.770\nJust thought we'd throw a quick\nreview up here for you.\n\n475\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.130\nThat's better.\nThank you very much.\n\n476\n00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.280\nA quick little review of\nthe different site system rules\n\n477\n00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.500\nthat are required to be\nable to do the deployments.\n\n478\n00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.190\nSo we can see management point there.\n\n479\n00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.980\nIt is used as a primary point of\ncommunication, provides site assignment if\n\n480\n00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.440\nnot specified, talked about the management\npoint and why it's so important.\n\n481\n00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.000\nI talked about the fallback status point,\n\n482\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.070\nwe did that,\nthat was the FSP equals designation.\n\n483\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.731\nThat provides client location\nin case they can not or\n\n484\n00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:21.738\nclient location capabilities in case\nthey can not find the management point.\n\n485\n00:22:21.738 --> 00:22:25.584\nAs I said, if the management point fails,\nfallback status point is the effectively\n\n486\n00:22:25.584 --> 00:22:29.100\nthat alternate that we use so we do\nwant to make sure we are aware of that.\n\n487\n00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.880\nSoftware update point is\nused to effectively do\n\n488\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.300\nour is used with the software\nupdate installation methods so\n\n489\n00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.130\nwe're doing software updates,\nwe need that.\n\n490\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.270\nThe enrollment point in enrollment\nproxy point are used for\n\n491\n00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.250\nthe mobile device enrollments\nwhen we actually go through and\n\n492\n00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.600\nset up mobile device support and\ncertificates.\n\n493\n00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.320\nWe need the enrollment points to do that.\n\n494\n00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.790\nWe have our distribution point.\n\n495\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.340\nWe know that's used to push\nout our client software.\n\n496\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.960\nAnd then reporting services\ndown at the bottom is used to\n\n497\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.590\nactually do the reporting and\nto view all of that information.\n\n498\n00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:02.050\nWe also have, if I'm not mistaken, a quick\nreview on the different methods for\n\n499\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.770\noperating, or rather generically for,\nclient deployment.\n\n500\n00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.810\nWe threw those up there and\nwe're reminding you of those as well.\n\n501\n00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.970\nWe have manual or\nlog-on based script deployments.\n\n502\n00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.980\nSo we can go in and\nrun either CCMSetup.exe,,\n\n503\n00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.213\nas we said, or\nwe can do a logon script that allows us\n\n504\n00:23:17.213 --> 00:23:20.960\nto be able to specify at logon\nthat we attach to the user.\n\n505\n00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.820\nAnd then it will be installed.\n\n506\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.760\nNotice that using CCMSetup requires\nadministrative rights, as we talked about.\n\n507\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.010\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n508\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:34.870\nSoftware distribution, we can go ahead and\nwe can do a package deployment.\n\n509\n00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.890\nWe actually have a package deployment\nalready set up in the console that\n\n510\n00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:43.140\nwe can just use and when we do the push\ninstall, it leverages that client package.\n\n511\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.530\nAnd that's what we actually do.\n\n512\n00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.860\nSo that software distribution just\npushes out and upgrades the package.\n\n513\n00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.370\nBut a push installation is\neffectively what we talked about.\n\n514\n00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.970\nAnd I showed you how to install the client\nand actually demo'd that for you.\n\n515\n00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.406\nAnd then operating system deployment,\nwe talked about the fact that we\n\n516\n00:23:56.406 --> 00:24:00.472\ncould integrate this into the operating\nsystem image, and have it thrown that way,\n\n517\n00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:04.248\nor we could do computer imaging, where\neffectively we will throw the image and\n\n518\n00:24:04.248 --> 00:24:07.133\nthen update it or do some sort\nof a transform after the fact.\n\n519\n00:24:07.133 --> 00:24:10.849\nSo we may be doing imaging with\nWindows Deployment Services or WDS,\n\n520\n00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:15.050\nwe may be doing it with ghost, we may\nbe doing it with the OSD functionality.\n\n521\n00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:16.690\nThere's different way to do that.\n\n522\n00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.470\nBut we have a lot of different options so\n\n523\n00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.220\nwe just wanna make sure we're aware\nof that, we think about that.\n\n524\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:25.582\nWhen we install the configuration\nmanager client agent into the Mac and\n\n525\n00:24:25.582 --> 00:24:30.101\nor Linux or UNIX system, what do we\nneed to know about getting it in there.\n\n526\n00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:32.789\nSo we have to make sure that we\nare setting this up because we do\n\n527\n00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:35.558\nactually have an agent that gets\ninstalled on the Mac client.\n\n528\n00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:38.568\nSo it's not just, hey, we have the support\nfor it, we actually have a version of\n\n529\n00:24:38.568 --> 00:24:41.563\nthe agent that runs on these systems that\nwe can actually download and install.\n\n530\n00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:44.994\nSo we configure the management point and\ndistribution point for\n\n531\n00:24:44.994 --> 00:24:46.500\nHTTPS communication.\n\n532\n00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.720\nSo we use secure communication,\nvery important.\n\n533\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.330\nWe install an enrollment point,\nan enrollment proxy points,\n\n534\n00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.600\nwe need certificates, so\nyou want to be aware of that.\n\n535\n00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.750\nWe change default client settings to\nallow users to enroll Mac computers,\n\n536\n00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.690\nbecause we wanna support that.\n\n537\n00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:03.230\nWe run the config manager Mac clients, you\nsee the Mac client that MSI is there for\n\n538\n00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.900\nthe Mac client, so we have to run that,\n\n539\n00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.990\nthat's an MSI package we run to then\ninstall and enroll the Mac as a client.\n\n540\n00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.280\nWe run Ccmsetup and CMEnroll.\n\n541\n00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.870\nAnd then installing configuration\nmanagement client agents for Linux and\n\n542\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:15.800\nUnix computers.\n\n543\n00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.542\nDown on the bottom,\nwe have the ccm-universal-x86.build.\n\n544\n00:25:20.542 --> 00:25:24.805\nWhatever the build number is, there'll\nbe a random number in there that's gonna\n\n545\n00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:27.398\nto be based on the build\nnumber that we're using so\n\n546\n00:25:27.398 --> 00:25:31.723\nthat'll change based on iterations .tar,\nthe .tar extension, tar is short for\n\n547\n00:25:31.723 --> 00:25:33.555\ntarball, or we call it a tarball.\n\n548\n00:25:33.555 --> 00:25:36.670\nBut that's only just a zip file\nin UNIX and Linux world, right?\n\n549\n00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.510\nSo it's effectively just a compressed\nfile, we call it a tar file, or\n\n550\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:45.403\nthe CCM universal x64,\nx86 32-bit, x64 64-bit.tar,\n\n551\n00:25:45.403 --> 00:25:48.660\nthat's gonna be on the Linux or\nUNIX computer.\n\n552\n00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.830\nWe run the install command and\n\n553\n00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:54.780\nreview the contents of the scxcm.log file\nto check whether it's installed or not, so\n\n554\n00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.490\nwe actually have agents that run on all\nthree of these platforms that we install.\n\n555\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.450\n>> Fantastic.\n\n556\n00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.650\n>> We do need to know you,\n\n557\n00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:04.570\nI should say you need to know because I\nalready know because I've already done it,\n\n558\n00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.400\nbut you need to know in case\nyou have never done this live.\n\n559\n00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.060\nThat we do have these agents.\n\n560\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.660\nAnd you should be familiar of what they\nare, in terms of the names of those files,\n\n561\n00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.360\nif ever asked about them.\n\n562\n00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.580\nVery important to know that and to know\nthat we obviously have these agents,\n\n563\n00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.098\ngenerically, would be good.\n\n564\n00:26:19.098 --> 00:26:22.715\nWhat I wanna do now before we show you\nhow client policies actually retrieved,\n\n565\n00:26:22.715 --> 00:26:24.845\nwe wanna take a look at\nthat after we get done.\n\n566\n00:26:24.845 --> 00:26:27.595\nWanna go into my machine,\ngonna do some demoing for you,\n\n567\n00:26:27.595 --> 00:26:31.185\nshow you all these settings that we've\nbeen alluding to or talking about.\n\n568\n00:26:31.185 --> 00:26:32.575\nSpend a few minutes in a live environment.\n\n569\n00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:35.665\nAnd then when we're done taking a look at\nall that, we're gonna come back out and\n\n570\n00:26:35.665 --> 00:26:38.675\ntake a look at our client policy\nactually moves back and forth.\n\n571\n00:26:38.675 --> 00:26:41.420\nSo once we make all these changes\nto the default client settings.\n\n572\n00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.700\nWe're gonna see how to\nactually update them.\n\n573\n00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.988\nSo we're gonna take\na look at that as well.\n\n574\n00:26:43.988 --> 00:26:46.860\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\ngo right over there, and\n\n575\n00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.838\nlet's take a look at\nthe actual client's settings.\n\n576\n00:26:49.838 --> 00:26:52.960\nAnd I'm gonna zoom in, or I will zoom in\nin just a second to take a look at that.\n\n577\n00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.200\nSo what I've done is I've opened up the\nconfig manager console and where we are,\n\n578\n00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.770\njust so you can see,\nwe're in the administration work space.\n\n579\n00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.790\nWe are on the client's settings area,\n\n580\n00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.292\nand you'll see we have the default\nclient settings there.\n\n581\n00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:08.770\nWe're gonna right click and\nopen them up and go to properties, and\n\n582\n00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.512\ntake a look at them.\n\n583\n00:27:09.512 --> 00:27:11.770\nSo gonna go ahead and do that right now.\n\n584\n00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.995\nRight click, let's go to properties,\nbring that up,\n\n585\n00:27:13.995 --> 00:27:17.410\ngot a lot of stuff in\nhere to take a look at.\n\n586\n00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.925\nScroll down a little bit.\n\n587\n00:27:19.925 --> 00:27:24.696\nAnd we can see we have four,\nsix, eight, and 12,\n\n588\n00:27:24.696 --> 00:27:28.390\n14, 16, 18, a whole big bunch.\n\n589\n00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.300\nI don't know how many, we got at least 20\ndifferent categories there we're gonna\n\n590\n00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.730\ntake a look at and go through.\n\n591\n00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.890\nBut you can see we have stuff for\nBITs there, we have cloud services,\n\n592\n00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.530\nclient policy, hardware and\nsoftware inventory, computer restarts,\n\n593\n00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.375\nremote tools, power management.\n\n594\n00:27:42.375 --> 00:27:43.610\nThat all sorts of stuff.\n\n595\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.110\nSo we've got a lot of settings in there.\n\n596\n00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:50.060\nSo when we deal with BITS,\nwe have the ability to be able to\n\n597\n00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.330\ndecide whether or\nnot we want to limit the bandwidth.\n\n598\n00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.390\nAnd if we are gonna use BITS to throttle,\nwe say yes.\n\n599\n00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:02.660\nWe then enable those settings down\nbelow that allow us to specify exactly\n\n600\n00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.940\nhow we're gonna throttle.\n\n601\n00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.540\nRemember, BITS allows us to stream\ndownloads at the place hold and\n\n602\n00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.990\nbookmark them, but it also allows us\nto control the bandwidth being used and\n\n603\n00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.510\nallocated on the system, which a lot\nof people don't know for download, so\n\n604\n00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.600\nwe can actually do that.\n\n605\n00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.917\nThe default on this is no, by the way, but\nif we choose to set this up, we actually\n\n606\n00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:24.235\ncan specify how much bandwidth on a client\nagent will be allocated out of the total\n\n607\n00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:28.396\npercentage for software downloads, so\nwe can actually do that if we want to.\n\n608\n00:28:28.396 --> 00:28:31.872\nWe have cloud services,\nunder cloud services do\n\n609\n00:28:31.872 --> 00:28:36.463\nwe allow access to a cloud based\ndistribution point, yes or no?\n\n610\n00:28:36.463 --> 00:28:39.249\nCloud distribution points\nare a new 2012 feature.\n\n611\n00:28:39.249 --> 00:28:42.882\nWe can actually set up distribution points\nout in the cloud and then access or\n\n612\n00:28:42.882 --> 00:28:46.540\nallow clients outside on the internet\nto access them to download software.\n\n613\n00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.160\nSo we can do software based\ndeployments of packages and\n\n614\n00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.480\napplications through the cloud\nif we want to from outside.\n\n615\n00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.470\nSo that's actually kind of cool,\nso the default by the way is no,\n\n616\n00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.980\nwe do have to turn that on.\n\n617\n00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.320\nThat will be up to us.\n\n618\n00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.760\nWe do have client policy.\n\n619\n00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.510\nRemember I talked about when we were\ntalking about refresh intervals for\n\n620\n00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.340\ndiscovery, I said the magic number\nis seven, seven days or one week.\n\n621\n00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.480\nThe other number here is that every\n60 minutes we poll to see whether or\n\n622\n00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.660\nnot there's updates to\nthe client policy settings.\n\n623\n00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.190\nSo the client actually\nchecks in once in hour,\n\n624\n00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.440\n24 hours a day with the management\npoint to see if there are changes.\n\n625\n00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.250\nAnd I said that we can see whether\nthe clients alive in more than one way.\n\n626\n00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.360\nNow we normally will leave\nthis setting at 60 minutes.\n\n627\n00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.490\nBut if you need a little bit more\naggressive cycles because you\n\n628\n00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:35.280\nmay be doing a lot of churning in your\nenvironment early on as you're setting up.\n\n629\n00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.590\nWe can drop that down\nin a lab environment.\n\n630\n00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.320\nYou know, usually we'd drop it down\nabout five minutes to get that quick\n\n631\n00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.705\nturn on policies when we're doing stuff,\nwhen we're doing testing.\n\n632\n00:29:43.705 --> 00:29:46.990\nWanna drop that down, but\ngenerically you can leave it at 60.\n\n633\n00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.190\nIt's about right for most environments,\nand then we have the option to manually\n\n634\n00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.790\nforce a refresh from within the client\nagent itself if we need to, right?\n\n635\n00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:57.720\nSo, we can do that if we want to, but\nthe default there will be 60 minutes, so\n\n636\n00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.190\njust be aware of that.\n\n637\n00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:04.700\nWe have compliance settings,\njust continuing down.\n\n638\n00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.830\nHow often do we wanna check compliance?\n\n639\n00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.150\nYes, we definitely wanna enable it and\nhow often?\n\n640\n00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.350\nAgain, magic number, every seven days.\n\n641\n00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:16.580\nSo, checking for compliance evaluation\nspecifies that the device should go up\n\n642\n00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.750\nof the managed device, should go out and\ncheck, and see if there's been an update\n\n643\n00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:24.010\nfor any of the settings that we may need\nto change on the compliance baseline side.\n\n644\n00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.398\nAnd if there are, we have to then report\nin and say our baseline is X, and\n\n645\n00:30:27.398 --> 00:30:31.093\nit looks like it needs to be X plus, and\nthen we'll get marked for mediation.\n\n646\n00:30:31.093 --> 00:30:33.430\nSo, wanna be thinking about that.\n\n647\n00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:38.870\nWith the computer agent, we have\na very large number of settings here.\n\n648\n00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.220\nSo many so that I can't show\nthem all to you in one screen,\n\n649\n00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.730\nbut you'll see that we have\nthe ability here to be able to control\n\n650\n00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.070\nwhat the timing is around\nclient deployment.\n\n651\n00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.538\nWhether or not we wanna add the default\napplication catalog website for\n\n652\n00:30:51.538 --> 00:30:54.847\nself-service software deployment and,\nif so, what is that URL?\n\n653\n00:30:54.847 --> 00:30:58.070\nWe'll be taking a look at that in an\nupcoming episode when we do software based\n\n654\n00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.390\ndeployments, we'll talk about that.\n\n655\n00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.040\nAre we gonna allow Silverlight\napplications to run using\n\n656\n00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.800\nan elevated trust mode, yes or no?\n\n657\n00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.770\nYet we obviously need to be doing\nthat in certain circumstances.\n\n658\n00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:09.330\nDefault setting there is yes.\n\n659\n00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.880\nAre we gonna specify install\npermissions and what are they?\n\n660\n00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.490\nAre we gonna suspend lock or pin entry\non restart if we are automanaging?\n\n661\n00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.910\nCuz if you're using bit locker, you've\ngot a pin you have to incorporate and\n\n662\n00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.790\nenter every time you power on the machine.\n\n663\n00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:26.550\nWe could suspend that for restarts based\non policy based software deployments,\n\n664\n00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.860\ncuz there isn't gonna be anybody\nthere to put the pin in.\n\n665\n00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.900\nSo we can do that but we have to override\nthat setting cuz by default it says no,\n\n666\n00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.465\nbecause if we do that, that's violating\nthe security policy of the system.\n\n667\n00:31:36.465 --> 00:31:40.240\nSo, we have a lot of control here,\nwe can in and do all sorts of stuff.\n\n668\n00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.580\nWhat about computer restarts?\n\n669\n00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.110\nWell, we could specify\n\n670\n00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.880\nthat we will give a user a temporary\nnotification that we're about to restart.\n\n671\n00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.990\nYou know how you get that\ndial-up balloon that pops up?\n\n672\n00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.800\nSays, hey you know, stop working,\nyou've got five minutes.\n\n673\n00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.214\nI don't give my users any time.\n\n674\n00:31:55.214 --> 00:31:56.159\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just restart and\n\n675\n00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:57.200\ndon't tell them anything.\n\n676\n00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.130\nI figure if they're not saving\noften enough, well, guess what?\n\n677\n00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.554\nIt's unfortunate, but\nthey're gonna learn the hard way, right?\n\n678\n00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:07.860\nBut we do actually not only give them\nthat, but the bottom choice says, hey,\n\n679\n00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.718\ndisplay a dialogue box that\nthe user cannot close.\n\n680\n00:32:10.718 --> 00:32:12.842\nWhich I also like doing because\nit really pisses them off-\n\n681\n00:32:12.842 --> 00:32:14.131\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n682\n00:32:14.131 --> 00:32:15.429\n>> And it does a count down for\n\n683\n00:32:15.429 --> 00:32:17.858\nthem and\ngoes from fifteen minutes down to zero.\n\n684\n00:32:17.858 --> 00:32:19.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now if you're smart and\n\n685\n00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:24.510\nyou want to get really cool you could hack\nthat and put a little dancing skull and\n\n686\n00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.580\ncrossbones or something-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n687\n00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.680\n>> In there and make it laugh at them and\n\n688\n00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.560\nthen they will get really\nreally upset at you.\n\n689\n00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.870\n>> As long as they don't\nknow what car you drive.\n\n690\n00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:32.940\n>> Exactly.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n691\n00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.310\n>> Don't want to do that, so\n\n692\n00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.680\nwe can do that.\n\n693\n00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.440\nWe also have end point protection.\n\n694\n00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.340\nEnd point protection in the settings\nforum end point protection here\n\n695\n00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.540\ncan be implemented.\n\n696\n00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.830\nThis will allow us to install\nthe end point manager client.\n\n697\n00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:49.070\nRemember the end point management\nprotection solution allows us to take over\n\n698\n00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.180\nand centrally manage the configuration\nin the Windows firewall and\n\n699\n00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:56.870\nthe anti-malware scanning engine the\nWindows Defender and security essentials.\n\n700\n00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.220\nWhatever it is now,\nwhatever the hell we call it now.\n\n701\n00:32:59.220 --> 00:32:59.980\n>> Windows Defender, right?\n\n702\n00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.540\n>> Is it Windows Defender now,\nyeah, whatever that is.\n\n703\n00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.080\nMicrosoft Security Central\nis what it's called now.\n\n704\n00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.880\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Used to be called Windows Defender,\n\n705\n00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.194\nwe're both showing our age.\n\n706\n00:33:09.194 --> 00:33:10.350\n>> Yeah, I was going to say.\n\n707\n00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.865\n[LAUGH]\n>> So it's called Microsoft security\n\n708\n00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:15.205\nessentials now but we're going to take\nover central management of that and\n\n709\n00:33:15.205 --> 00:33:16.765\nconfigure both of those items.\n\n710\n00:33:16.765 --> 00:33:19.145\nThat's what endpoint protection\nis going to allow us to do.\n\n711\n00:33:19.145 --> 00:33:23.737\nSo we have that, we have hardware\ninventory, we have settings for\n\n712\n00:33:23.737 --> 00:33:24.657\nthe hardware inventory.\n\n713\n00:33:24.657 --> 00:33:28.677\nAnd what we can do with the hardware\ninventory, by default it is turned off.\n\n714\n00:33:28.677 --> 00:33:32.267\nAs you can see again magic number set for\nseven days.\n\n715\n00:33:32.267 --> 00:33:33.887\nWe have what's known as a MIF file,\n\n716\n00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:36.637\nMicrosoft information management and\nform file.\n\n717\n00:33:36.637 --> 00:33:40.257\nIt's going to allow us to\neffectively specify custom hardware\n\n718\n00:33:40.257 --> 00:33:41.557\nthat we want to configure.\n\n719\n00:33:41.557 --> 00:33:44.450\nAnd a capture if we have\ncustom hardware on a Endpoint,\n\n720\n00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.150\nwe can actually capture\nup information about it.\n\n721\n00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:50.670\nNow we can do more than just that, what we\ncan do is go into set classes here, and\n\n722\n00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.490\nwe actually, and\nthis is like really like way cool.\n\n723\n00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:58.970\nWe can go in and by default we\nare capturing certain information, and\n\n724\n00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.490\nwe expose what that information is.\n\n725\n00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.094\nSo for instance, if you look here,\n\n726\n00:34:02.094 --> 00:34:07.284\nwhat you will notice Is\nthat we are not capturing\n\n727\n00:34:07.284 --> 00:34:11.940\nanything having to do with FireWire\ncontrollers, 1394's FireWire right?\n\n728\n00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.770\nAnd we are capturing ActiveSync,\nwe are capturing AMT but\n\n729\n00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.360\nwe're not capturing anything having.\n\n730\n00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.200\nHaving to do with AppV or the battery,\nbecause most systems are desktops,\n\n731\n00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:20.790\nthey're not mobile.\n\n732\n00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.630\nThey won't have batteries, and\nthat's not the CMOS battery,\n\n733\n00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.440\nthat's the battery battery in a laptop.\n\n734\n00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.510\nSo if we wanna capture that because\nmaybe we have a group of machines that\n\n735\n00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.870\nare mobile, and we're using them and\n\n736\n00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:34.980\nthey are laptops and we have batteries,\nwe have to go in and add that class in.\n\n737\n00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:40.480\nAnd all those items that are checked\noff are the Classes in the Win32 system\n\n738\n00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.850\nclass for the individual areas that\nwe wanna be able to manipulate.\n\n739\n00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.470\nSo Win32_battery is gonna actually give\nus the information on the battery.\n\n740\n00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:50.380\nBoot Config is there, Browser Help Object,\n\n741\n00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.880\nyou name it,\nwe got all sorts of stuff in here.\n\n742\n00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:59.820\nSo we actually can go in and\nopen one of these and we can decide that\n\n743\n00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.570\nwe wanna capture and\nI mean if you look at just this one area,\n\n744\n00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.220\nlook at all the stuff that's opened\nup under here under battery.\n\n745\n00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.930\nThere's like another 20 things below that\nthat I can't even scroll down and see.\n\n746\n00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.340\nSo we can actually go in and\nwe can get any or\n\n747\n00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.570\nall of those things on the battery\nby checking off what we want and\n\n748\n00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:23.430\ncustomize the inventory capture so\nthat we get that eye collections.\n\n749\n00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.650\nBecause what we can do what a lot of\npeople don't know we can do actually\n\n750\n00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.360\nmost people say hey,\nwe got these default client settings.\n\n751\n00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.880\nWe got one agent,\nI don't know if I can customize.\n\n752\n00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.846\nI think I can customize the settings but\nthe agent gets pushed out to all\n\n753\n00:35:34.846 --> 00:35:37.269\nthe systems in the default\nsettings supply to the agent.\n\n754\n00:35:37.269 --> 00:35:41.060\nWhich means that all the agents\nare configured the same way, right?\n\n755\n00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.360\nIf you know anything about me, you know\nwhenever I ask that it's rhetorical.\n\n756\n00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.620\nThe answer is always no, because what we\ncan do and what most people are not aware\n\n757\n00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.260\nof, is that we can actually create\nmultiple client agent setting files.\n\n758\n00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.929\nAnd so we have the default one but we can\ncopy that, modify it, and then apply that\n\n759\n00:35:55.929 --> 00:36:00.412\nto a specific collection, and modify\nthe client agents in that collection.\n\n760\n00:36:00.412 --> 00:36:02.540\nSo that if we have, say laptops and\n\n761\n00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.270\nwe're smart and we put them into\na collection specific to mobile devices.\n\n762\n00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:10.134\nBecause we want battery information and\nall the other agents on desktops don't\n\n763\n00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:13.660\nneed that, we can set up a separate\nagent configuration specific\n\n764\n00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:17.220\nto that particular collection and we can\ncustomize it just for mobile devices.\n\n765\n00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:17.890\n>> That's pretty sweet.\n\n766\n00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:21.400\n>> That is very sweet, so\nwe actually can do that.\n\n767\n00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.500\nI'll show you how to make copy of it when\nwe're done going through the dry run.\n\n768\n00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.790\nBut actually we, if we know that, can get\nvery granular and incredibly specific\n\n769\n00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:32.880\nabout the hardware inventory\ninformation we want to capture back.\n\n770\n00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.970\nA lot of times we have this custom\nhardware configurations on servers and\n\n771\n00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:37.550\nthings like that.\n\n772\n00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.730\nLike imagine your blades for\ninstance, right?\n\n773\n00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.750\nThat we may be using we can capture,\n\n774\n00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.180\nmanage some of that depending\non how that set up.\n\n775\n00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.880\nWe may be able to manage it totally\nthe way we do a Windows system.\n\n776\n00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.110\nRemember through SMNP an IP based\ndiscovery over the network.\n\n777\n00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:53.220\nWe could still capture stuff like Blade\nservers and at least know their there.\n\n778\n00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.010\nNow we may don't have great detail for\nhardware inventory there But\n\n779\n00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.770\nfor Unix an Linux systems, for\nMac systems, for Windows systems,\n\n780\n00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.890\nwe can get basic inventory back and\nmaybe even advanced inventory.\n\n781\n00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:05.840\nSo we do have capabilities to drill\nin very, very specifically and\n\n782\n00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.040\nvery granularly here.\n\n783\n00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.670\nSo wanna just be aware of that and\nunderstand that,\n\n784\n00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.420\ncuz that is actually really kind of cool.\n\n785\n00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.980\nNow, we also can import\nNIF files from vendors.\n\n786\n00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.269\nThey have their own files for that, we can\nimport those and use those here as well.\n\n787\n00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.710\nMetered internet connections, we actually,\n\n788\n00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:25.750\nI like this one because\nthis does piss people off.\n\n789\n00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.900\nWe can take client communication that's on\nmetered internet connections and block it,\n\n790\n00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.365\nwhich means if somebody's coming in.\n\n791\n00:37:32.365 --> 00:37:37.015\nOn a slow connection over the Internet\nmeaning if they're tethered let's say to\n\n792\n00:37:37.015 --> 00:37:40.165\na cell phone, and they're using\nthat as their primary method.\n\n793\n00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:42.705\nWe don't want to ding them for\nthe data it's gonna take to deploy\n\n794\n00:37:42.705 --> 00:37:45.245\noffice unless we really don't\nlike them in which we could.\n\n795\n00:37:45.245 --> 00:37:47.440\nBut if we don't want to\nbe able to ding them for\n\n796\n00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.330\nthe data charges to push let's say\na three gig file out to deploy Office.\n\n797\n00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:55.080\nWe actually can block that connection and\nnot allow the software to be deployed\n\n798\n00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.330\nuntil they connect on\na land based connection so\n\n799\n00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.580\nthey won't get dinged for that.\n\n800\n00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.720\nSo we can actually set that up, and\n\n801\n00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.350\nby default it's set to block because\nwe don't want to have our users\n\n802\n00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.840\nactually paying the price cuz\nit's all the way of the business.\n\n803\n00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.040\nPays the price for that, but\n\n804\n00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.510\nwe don't wanna ding those users when\nthey're coming in on slow connections.\n\n805\n00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.840\nSo we actually have the capability\nto manage that as well,\n\n806\n00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.970\nthat's also a new 2012 feature.\n\n807\n00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.230\nWe have NAP, Network Access Protection.\n\n808\n00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:21.585\nWhat NAP allows us to do is it allows\nus to turn on the network access or\n\n809\n00:38:21.585 --> 00:38:24.455\nthe network access\nprotection on the clients.\n\n810\n00:38:24.455 --> 00:38:26.140\nNAP is health remediation.\n\n811\n00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.967\nWhat NAP effectively does, is it allows\nus to scan all of the inbound systems\n\n812\n00:38:30.967 --> 00:38:34.277\nlook at a configuration base line for\nhealth monitoring.\n\n813\n00:38:34.277 --> 00:38:37.427\nCheck to see that the patches are up to\ndate, check to see if the configuration is\n\n814\n00:38:37.427 --> 00:38:41.517\nup to date, you only use https for\ninstance, instead of http, check and\n\n815\n00:38:41.517 --> 00:38:43.913\nmake sure our certificates are there,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n816\n00:38:43.913 --> 00:38:46.913\nMicrosoft calls it NAP, Cisco has for\n\n817\n00:38:46.913 --> 00:38:49.093\nmany years had their product\nin market calls it NAC.\n\n818\n00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:53.813\nNetwork access control, similar concept,\nit's about quarantining systems,\n\n819\n00:38:53.813 --> 00:38:56.653\nvalidating them against\nthe health monitor baseline, and\n\n820\n00:38:56.653 --> 00:38:59.613\nthen remediating them if\nthey don't meet compliance.\n\n821\n00:38:59.613 --> 00:39:01.773\nAnd this technology is\nfairly robust today.\n\n822\n00:39:01.773 --> 00:39:05.303\nSo we can support that fully\nintegrated with SCCM client here, and\n\n823\n00:39:05.303 --> 00:39:07.750\nwe can take a look at\nthat to enforce our and\n\n824\n00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:11.780\nwith rather our policy based\nconfiguration management.\n\n825\n00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.330\nWe have power management capabilities\nhere so we can actually drill in and\n\n826\n00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.880\nspecify that we allow power\nmanagement of devices.\n\n827\n00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.480\nWe support wake on LAN, so if we do WOL\nwe support wake on LAN proxies as well.\n\n828\n00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.080\nWe can reach out and\nwake those devices up,\n\n829\n00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.660\nwe're thinking more serves than desktops\nfor this but we can do that and\n\n830\n00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.900\nwe actually then can do that\nthrough the engine if we need to.\n\n831\n00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:34.340\nSo that's kind of nice assuming of course\nthat the support is there in the system.\n\n832\n00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:39.970\nWe have remote tools, remote tools allow\nus to be able to effectively go in and\n\n833\n00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:42.050\nexecute remote control on the client.\n\n834\n00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:45.800\nSo this is gonna allow us to be able to go\nin, and from a help desk perspective a lot\n\n835\n00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.030\nof my customers are using\nthis on their help desks.\n\n836\n00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:50.500\nTo be able to reach out and\nremotely control systems.\n\n837\n00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.900\nSo they're getting rid of things\nlike VNC or GoToMyPC or Hyena or\n\n838\n00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.870\nwhatever they use, and they're using\nthis because this is all integrated,\n\n839\n00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.750\ngives them the same level of control.\n\n840\n00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.298\nBut the nice thing about It is,\nthey can shadow the user and\n\n841\n00:40:02.298 --> 00:40:04.962\nsee what they're doing unlike\nRDP where you get kicked out.\n\n842\n00:40:04.962 --> 00:40:08.132\nSo this is actually nice and gives you\nthose advanced capabilities, right?\n\n843\n00:40:08.132 --> 00:40:08.886\n>> Mm hm.\n\n844\n00:40:08.886 --> 00:40:13.136\n>> And, yeah, no Jonathon definitely\nnot recommended, I just caught that.\n\n845\n00:40:13.136 --> 00:40:16.758\nDefinitely not recommended to check off\nevery class in that hardware inventory\n\n846\n00:40:16.758 --> 00:40:17.900\ncycle and pull it all in.\n\n847\n00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.460\nAt least not if you want to be able\nto get anything back in a reasonable\n\n848\n00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.420\namount of time.\n\n849\n00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.890\nBut as I do encourage you to do.\n\n850\n00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.890\nTest early and test often on your\nfriend's machines, on their networks.\n\n851\n00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.150\nTotally acceptable there,\nit's no problem at all.\n\n852\n00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.570\nBut just don't do it on your own,\nthat's the only thing.\n\n853\n00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:31.740\nWith software deployment.\n\n854\n00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:37.690\nWe do have the ability to re-evaluate how\noften software deployments are scheduled\n\n855\n00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:38.760\nand how often they're coming down.\n\n856\n00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.230\nSo this is not hey, let me go redeploy\neverything, this is wow, did I miss\n\n857\n00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.810\nsomething that's pending, and if I did\nlet's just make sure we're caught up.\n\n858\n00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.470\nSo this just allows us to go out again.\n\n859\n00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.790\nMagic number, every seven days.\n\n860\n00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:51.520\nWe have software inventory,\nbecause no inventory cycle would be\n\n861\n00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.720\ncomplete without doing software\ninventory as well as hardware inventory.\n\n862\n00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.490\nAlso turn on by default,\nalso schedule once every seven days.\n\n863\n00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.060\nBut here's kinda the interesting and\ncool thing about this, so\n\n864\n00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.280\nwe talked about the really cool granular\ncapabilities on the hardware side.\n\n865\n00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.150\nWe have equally cool granular\ncapabilities on the software side.\n\n866\n00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:10.039\nI'm gonna actually throw in a pair of\nthose Groucho Marx glasses one time with\n\n867\n00:41:10.039 --> 00:41:11.310\nthe beard and the mustache.\n\n868\n00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.990\nSo when it cuts to me randomly, like out\nof the blue while I'm talking, right,\n\n869\n00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.690\nyou're gonna see I'm gonna be wearing\na really cool mask or something.\n\n870\n00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:20.700\nJust so it comes up randomly and\nsurprises everybody,\n\n871\n00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.230\nlike it surprises me when he cuts to me\nwithout telling me he's gonna do that.\n\n872\n00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:27.280\nSo I don't know that you're gonna put\nme back up in the picture on picture.\n\n873\n00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:32.810\nSo when we're talking about this, the\nreally cool thing with the software and\n\n874\n00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:36.360\nthe software inventory is that\nwe can actually go out and\n\n875\n00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.650\nnot just record what software is there, we\nactually can get copies of certain files.\n\n876\n00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.910\nSo we actually can take copies of\nfiles that are on all these machines,\n\n877\n00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.040\nbring them back and\ncentrally archive them, and\n\n878\n00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.530\nhave a record of what's going on in\nthe system during certain periods of time.\n\n879\n00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.500\nNow it takes a little work to do what\nI'm about to describe to you, but\n\n880\n00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.050\none of the things you could use this for\nis an early warning system, or\n\n881\n00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:59.190\na trip wire system for\neither security monitoring.\n\n882\n00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:02.815\nAnd or you can also use it for doing\ncompliance checking and validating of your\n\n883\n00:42:02.815 --> 00:42:06.440\nbase lines at certain periods of time to\nsee whether certain files are there or\n\n884\n00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.307\nhave been moved.\n\n885\n00:42:07.307 --> 00:42:10.653\nSo it's actually kind of interesting\nthat we can do this because we have\n\n886\n00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:14.052\nthe capability to go in and we actually\nhave the ability to be able to go and\n\n887\n00:42:14.052 --> 00:42:17.731\nsay hey, let me choose certain files,\nand when I've chosen those files let me\n\n888\n00:42:17.731 --> 00:42:20.678\nactually collect them and\nby computer bring them all back in.\n\n889\n00:42:20.678 --> 00:42:22.638\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat that real quick and\n\n890\n00:42:22.638 --> 00:42:24.450\njust kind of see what that looks like.\n\n891\n00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:27.730\nWe can go in here and we can inventory\nfiles so we're gonna do set type,\n\n892\n00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.620\nand when we do set type,\nwe actually can go in and specify.\n\n893\n00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.600\nAnd when we do that,\nwe can specify what kind of files we want.\n\n894\n00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.760\nWe actually can do a wild card.\n\n895\n00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:47.820\nAnd so what we can do is we can say there,\nhey, let me do *.txt and\n\n896\n00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:52.930\nget a text files, let me do *.log and\nget a log files or\n\n897\n00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.860\nfrom a certain directory and\na certain path as you can see.\n\n898\n00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.880\nAll client hard disks or\nonly certain ones.\n\n899\n00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.630\nWe could exclude certain directories.\n\n900\n00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.790\nWe can search subfolders so\nwe can do that, as well.\n\n901\n00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:06.960\nAnd we could exclude encrypted and\ncompressed files and\n\n902\n00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.680\nwe could also exclude files in\nthe Windows folder by default.\n\n903\n00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.050\nSo we can do all sorts of stuff in here\nif we'd like to, which is kind of cool.\n\n904\n00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:18.980\nAnd then that's just to inventory,\nmeaning just tell me what's there.\n\n905\n00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.130\nIf I wanna collect the files\nlike I was saying,\n\n906\n00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.860\nwe go into collect files, set files.\n\n907\n00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.200\nWe effectively do the same exact thing.\n\n908\n00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.990\nSo we can go in and grab that.\n\n909\n00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:33.070\nBut in addition, when we do that\nwe can exclude encrypted and\n\n910\n00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.070\ncompressed files on the gather.\n\n911\n00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.190\nSo we actually can pull files in but\nexclude certain ones.\n\n912\n00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:41.930\nNow we have to be careful here because\nwe're now making copies of certain files.\n\n913\n00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.930\nSo we have the capability to stop\nthe collection at a certain size.\n\n914\n00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:47.960\nAnd that is in kilobytes by the way,\nright.\n\n915\n00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.800\nIt does say at the bottom\nthere under stop KB.\n\n916\n00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.990\nSo that size value is in kilobytes.\n\n917\n00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.860\nSo if I want to say I\nwant up to five megs of\n\n918\n00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.920\nfiles I would say 5,000 kilobytes give\nme five megs worth of those file,\n\n919\n00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.470\nafter five megs stop because we don't\nwant to have unrestricted collection.\n\n920\n00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:06.290\nOr effectively gonna run out of\nspace on the Config Manager Server,\n\n921\n00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.620\nbecause that's where this all winds up,\nwe keep copies of this.\n\n922\n00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.490\nSo just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n923\n00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.725\nWe do have the capability to be\nable to do that as well in here, so\n\n924\n00:44:14.725 --> 00:44:15.844\nthat's actually kinda cool.\n\n925\n00:44:15.844 --> 00:44:16.563\n>> It is.\n\n926\n00:44:16.563 --> 00:44:18.345\n>> We do have Software Metering.\n\n927\n00:44:18.345 --> 00:44:22.805\nSoftware Metering is just gonna\ngive us the capability to check and\n\n928\n00:44:22.805 --> 00:44:26.005\nsee when software is executed and\nused and how often and\n\n929\n00:44:26.005 --> 00:44:28.087\nagain the magic number\nthere is every days.\n\n930\n00:44:28.087 --> 00:44:31.237\nNow what you need to do with software\nmetering is let that run for\n\n931\n00:44:31.237 --> 00:44:35.867\n30 days to actually get a period of time,\nin terms of reporting, so\n\n932\n00:44:35.867 --> 00:44:39.277\nwe actually have enough data in\nthe system to start generating reports.\n\n933\n00:44:39.277 --> 00:44:42.417\nBecause the software metering\nreports have a 30 day time window.\n\n934\n00:44:42.417 --> 00:44:44.587\nSo we actually,\nalthough we'll get data usage or\n\n935\n00:44:44.587 --> 00:44:49.130\nusage on data, usage on data,\ndata on usage is what I'm saying.\n\n936\n00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.910\nWe will not be able to start reporting\non it until we get 30 days out.\n\n937\n00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.640\nSo just have to be aware of that.\n\n938\n00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.950\nWe have Software Updates.\n\n939\n00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.970\nWe can go in and\nwe can here enable software updating and\n\n940\n00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.410\nwe see that's turned on by default.\n\n941\n00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.410\nWe checked the software updates,\nscan schedule, and\n\n942\n00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.890\nreevaluation schedule\nagain every seven days.\n\n943\n00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:07.800\nAnd then we can go ahead, and\n\n944\n00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.230\nwe can specify just some basic parameters\nabout hey, how often we want to check in.\n\n945\n00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:15.590\nNow, we're going to push software updates\nout using the WSUS integration, right.\n\n946\n00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:17.310\nSo we're going to see how to do that.\n\n947\n00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:18.690\nWe'll do an episode on that.\n\n948\n00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:21.680\nThat's just basically here,\nwhat we're doing is\n\n949\n00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.470\nallowing ourselves to have the setups\nthat we will accept software updates.\n\n950\n00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.710\nThis is not about configuring\nhow they're gonna come down.\n\n951\n00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:29.660\nWe have a whole solution that does that.\n\n952\n00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.760\nWe'll be taking a look at that\nin one of our future episodes.\n\n953\n00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.350\nWe have state messaging.\n\n954\n00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.810\nOur state messaging reporting\ncycle every 15 minutes.\n\n955\n00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.710\nThis updates the client\nstatus into the system so\n\n956\n00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:45.090\nwe can report on it and see that\nthe status indicators in the console.\n\n957\n00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:48.350\nSo I said it's not critical that\nyou view the heartbeat discovery\n\n958\n00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:51.470\nevery seven days is fine because we're\nchecking the status on the client\n\n959\n00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.460\nevery 15 minutes by default anyway.\n\n960\n00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.981\nSo we're gonna see a problem with it\nway before we get out one week, so\n\n961\n00:45:55.981 --> 00:45:57.607\nwe're not gonna worry too much about that.\n\n962\n00:45:57.607 --> 00:46:01.056\nAnd then user and device affinity,\nagain, new for 2012.\n\n963\n00:46:01.056 --> 00:46:05.597\nWe're able to actually specify that\nusers can define their primary devices.\n\n964\n00:46:05.597 --> 00:46:09.836\nThis becomes important in the asset\ncatalog and the software website for\n\n965\n00:46:09.836 --> 00:46:13.796\nself service deployment because,\nwe can say to a user hey, go on and\n\n966\n00:46:13.796 --> 00:46:18.678\nsave this is my primary device and then we\ndeploys software to that primary device.\n\n967\n00:46:18.678 --> 00:46:21.488\nSo we actually have the capability\nto tag that and to do that, and\n\n968\n00:46:21.488 --> 00:46:23.788\nwe could look at user device\naffinity usage as well.\n\n969\n00:46:23.788 --> 00:46:26.280\nWe could see how often you're using\nthat device and things like that.\n\n970\n00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.310\nSo those of you that are out there,\nyou know, going out and\n\n971\n00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:33.470\ndoing Spotify during work hours and all\nthat crazy stuff, we're coming for you.\n\n972\n00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.150\nWe know where you are, right?\n\n973\n00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:36.360\nJust be aware of that.\n\n974\n00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.870\nSo we have all of these different\nsettings that we can set up in here.\n\n975\n00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:43.490\nNow, I promised you that I'd show you\na little added additional bonus which is,\n\n976\n00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:46.650\nhey, we now know because I told\nyou that we can actually make\n\n977\n00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.660\na copy of these Default Settings that\nhave different client policy settings and\n\n978\n00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.090\nassign them or\nuse them in different configurations.\n\n979\n00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.940\nSo, let's take a look at how to do that.\n\n980\n00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.750\nWe can actually right click on\nthe default client settings,\n\n981\n00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:58.920\nand you'll see we have properties, right?\n\n982\n00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.330\nWe zoom in.\n\n983\n00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:05.290\nYou'll see we have properties, but what we\nalso can do up here is if we come up here.\n\n984\n00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:06.440\nAnd I'm just going to point to it.\n\n985\n00:47:07.635 --> 00:47:11.075\nAnd zoom in, you'll see we can create\ncustom client device settings,\n\n986\n00:47:11.075 --> 00:47:13.015\ncreate custom client user settings.\n\n987\n00:47:13.015 --> 00:47:17.355\nUp on the ribbon, we actually can go in\nand create a customized set of settings\n\n988\n00:47:17.355 --> 00:47:21.585\nspecifically and then use those and deploy\nthem against one of the collections.\n\n989\n00:47:21.585 --> 00:47:22.835\nAnd then tailor and\n\n990\n00:47:22.835 --> 00:47:25.655\ncustomize exactly what we need just\nby using the options right up there.\n\n991\n00:47:25.655 --> 00:47:26.355\n>> That is cool.\n\n992\n00:47:26.355 --> 00:47:27.195\n>> That is very cool.\n\n993\n00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.890\nAlright, do you guys know\nabout that by the way?\n\n994\n00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.630\nI don't hear anything out there.\n\n995\n00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:33.630\n>> I don't hear anything either.\n\n996\n00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:34.600\n>> I think a lot of you did but\n\n997\n00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.390\nyou're not saying anything because\nyou're shy, but that's okay.\n\n998\n00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:37.720\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n999\n00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.460\nLet's actually just take a look at how\nto do one of those real quickly so\n\n1000\n00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.140\nyou guys can see that.\n\n1001\n00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.580\nI'm gonna do the device\nsettings all right,\n\n1002\n00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.310\nwe're just gonna take a look\nat that one real quick.\n\n1003\n00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:46.620\nSo I'm gonna click on that,\nit's gonna open up a little wizard for us,\n\n1004\n00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.170\nit will take us just a moment to do that.\n\n1005\n00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.770\nSo what we'll have here is, and\nI'll just call this test one,\n\n1006\n00:47:55.770 --> 00:48:00.270\nthe ability to be able to generate that,\nand then you'll see you have a checklist\n\n1007\n00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:02.640\nof all the different setting\noptions I just showed you.\n\n1008\n00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.299\nWe're going to check off the ones we want.\n\n1009\n00:48:04.299 --> 00:48:08.058\nThey're going to be put onto the left-hand\nselector window right here under general,\n\n1010\n00:48:08.058 --> 00:48:11.254\nand then I'm going to be able to start\nconfiguring them as I choose them, so\n\n1011\n00:48:11.254 --> 00:48:13.425\nlet's just take a look at\nwhat that may look like.\n\n1012\n00:48:13.425 --> 00:48:18.520\nLet's say that I want BITs and\nlet's say that I want Hardware Inventory.\n\n1013\n00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.196\nSo I've selected those two.\n\n1014\n00:48:20.196 --> 00:48:21.940\nYou'll see they've been moved over there.\n\n1015\n00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.210\nAnd what I can now do is\ngo to Hardware Inventory.\n\n1016\n00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:30.560\nAnd I can go in and I can,\n\n1017\n00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:36.565\nbecause Jonathon asked, I can go in and-\n>> Check them all.\n\n1018\n00:48:36.565 --> 00:48:38.210\n>> Check them all,\nexcept I'm not gonna do that,\n\n1019\n00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.790\nbecause it's a pain in the ass to\ngo through and check each one.\n\n1020\n00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:43.870\n>> We need some battery status.\n>> They don't have a set all for\n\n1021\n00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:46.685\na reason because it is really\nnot a good idea, all right?\n\n1022\n00:48:46.685 --> 00:48:48.848\n[LAUGH] But you can,\nyou know they have like in Windows update,\n\n1023\n00:48:48.848 --> 00:48:50.692\nwhere you have the check up,\ncheck box, check all?\n\n1024\n00:48:50.692 --> 00:48:53.000\nYeah, we don't have that for\na reason, all right.\n\n1025\n00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.250\nBut I am gonna choose most of those, so\n\n1026\n00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:59.270\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ncheck off like, let's say those.\n\n1027\n00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.880\nI'm gonna click OK and\nthen I've done that, so\n\n1028\n00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:05.325\nthen when I'm done, what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna click OK.\n\n1029\n00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.520\nAnd now, what you'll see\n\n1030\n00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:13.000\nis that we actually now have not just the\nDefault Client Settings, but I also have\n\n1031\n00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.660\na new set of Client Settings called Test\n1 that are available there, all right?\n\n1032\n00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.910\n>> Nice.\n>> So now I have that, and\n\n1033\n00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:23.090\nnow I can use that, and I can actually\nuse that to then drive a custom set\n\n1034\n00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:27.050\nof settings down to certain collections,\nand use it to be further focused\n\n1035\n00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:31.210\non how I'm gonna effectively gather that\ninformation and use it to my advantage.\n\n1036\n00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:34.140\nNow in terms of gathering that\ninformation, we wanna take a quick look,\n\n1037\n00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:37.780\nand I know you have a nice little graphic\nthat we've put together, that we want to\n\n1038\n00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:41.840\ntalk about for client policy retrieval and\nhow once we push all this stuff up and set\n\n1039\n00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.820\nit up, how we're actually then gonna be\nable to see the client actually updating.\n\n1040\n00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.560\nAnd so what we have is we now\nhave the agent settings set up.\n\n1041\n00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.140\nWe've done that.\n\n1042\n00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.280\nConfigured them.\n\n1043\n00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.270\nWe've even showed you how to create\na custom set of agent settings if we want.\n\n1044\n00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:55.442\nBut they're still sitting on\nthe server on the console.\n\n1045\n00:49:55.442 --> 00:49:58.800\nWe gotta get them down to the client,\nnot just a client but to all clients.\n\n1046\n00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.370\nWe've gotta push them out there.\n\n1047\n00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:04.300\nSo once we've done that, we now have to do\nwhat's called a policy retrieval cycle.\n\n1048\n00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.610\nSo the agent checks in by default\nevery 60 minutes to see whether or\n\n1049\n00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.270\nnot with the management point\nthere's been an update.\n\n1050\n00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:14.400\nSo at least once an hour we're gonna\nsee if there's been a policy change.\n\n1051\n00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.950\nIf there has,\nwe pull down the pending policy file and\n\n1052\n00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.700\nwe apply it to the endpoint.\n\n1053\n00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.324\nNow it's the server's responsibility,\nthe site server.\n\n1054\n00:50:24.324 --> 00:50:28.250\nIt's the site server's responsibility to\ntee up these changes when we make them and\n\n1055\n00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.846\nput them into a pending queue and alert\nthe management point, which is simply\n\n1056\n00:50:31.846 --> 00:50:35.610\na site server role that typically is\nsitting on the primary site server.\n\n1057\n00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.970\nBut alert any management points\nthat there's been a change,\n\n1058\n00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:38.950\nthere's been an update.\n\n1059\n00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:43.190\nSo there's communication that takes place\nbetween the primary site server and\n\n1060\n00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:46.030\nthe management points, plural,\nif there's more than one.\n\n1061\n00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:49.795\nIf the management point is on\nthe primary site server, the function.\n\n1062\n00:50:49.795 --> 00:50:51.190\nThe management point function,\n\n1063\n00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:53.900\nis made aware of the fact\nthat there's a policy update.\n\n1064\n00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:58.060\nThe management point is then gonna tee\nthat up and so in step one on the left\n\n1065\n00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.240\nthere where the client checks in and\nsays hey, Mr. management pointer Mrs.\n\n1066\n00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.730\nmanagement point, do I have any\nupdates that I have to be aware of?\n\n1067\n00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:09.190\nManagement point goes back to\nconfiguration management database server,\n\n1068\n00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:10.670\nyou'll see that in step two.\n\n1069\n00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:14.190\nChecks the database server and\ndownloads the policies,\n\n1070\n00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:19.670\nright, that have been updated, downloads\nthe updated policy file, the information.\n\n1071\n00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:22.780\nReturns that back to the management point,\nso we have it teed up.\n\n1072\n00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.100\nAnd then ultimately pushes that\nout in step four to the client.\n\n1073\n00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.340\nSo at least once an hour\nthe client does this by default,\n\n1074\n00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.910\nbecause we have a 60 minute interval.\n\n1075\n00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:33.520\nNow, we can change that, or we can say\nhey, let's check in every 5 minutes,\n\n1076\n00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.430\nor every 15 minutes, or whatever.\n\n1077\n00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:39.190\nBut at least once an hour, clients check\nin to see if there's a policy update.\n\n1078\n00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:44.270\nNow if we wait that cycle, if we wait an\nhour, we can make a change two minutes in,\n\n1079\n00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:47.390\n59 minutes later, roughly,\nthat change will show up, maybe even\n\n1080\n00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:50.680\na little bit more than that, but\nit's gonna take a full hour at a minimum.\n\n1081\n00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.770\nIf we don't wanna wait, if we're\nimpatient, we can go to the end point.\n\n1082\n00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:56.720\nWe can go to the SCCM client\nin the control panel.\n\n1083\n00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.930\nWe can highlight policy retrieval.\n\n1084\n00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:02.780\nMachine policy retrieval, user policy\nretrieval and kick off run now and\n\n1085\n00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.810\nmanually intervene and we can launch that\nwhenever we want as often as we want,\n\n1086\n00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:09.120\nright, so\nwe can do that if we need to as well.\n\n1087\n00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.286\n>> As always, Adam, another great episode,\n\n1088\n00:52:11.286 --> 00:52:14.388\nwe got to take a look at managing\nthose client agent settings and\n\n1089\n00:52:14.388 --> 00:52:18.389\nthere were a lot of them, and some really\ncool ones that were pretty surprising.\n\n1090\n00:52:18.389 --> 00:52:22.080\nWe saw support for devices that\nwe might not normally think of.\n\n1091\n00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.607\nWe see Microsoft opening up and\n\n1092\n00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:27.072\nsaying, hey, we can put these agents\non Apple device, iOS devices,\n\n1093\n00:52:27.072 --> 00:52:31.127\nAndroid devices, Linux devices, and\nthen going through all of those settings,\n\n1094\n00:52:31.127 --> 00:52:35.490\nfantastic, I feel like I could work my\nway around there pretty comfortably now.\n\n1095\n00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:37.939\nHope you guys can too,\nhope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n1096\n00:52:37.939 --> 00:52:41.585\nRemember, if you wannna sit in\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n1097\n00:52:41.585 --> 00:52:44.455\nshoot us an email here\nat SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n1098\n00:52:44.455 --> 00:52:46.198\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n1099\n00:52:46.198 --> 00:52:47.621\n>> I'm confused.\n\n1100\n00:52:47.621 --> 00:52:49.084\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n1101\n00:52:49.084 --> 00:52:49.735\n>> Take care.\n\n1102\n00:52:49.735 -->

here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.600\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.610\nToday we're doing our system\ncenter configurations manager.\n\n6\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.490\n2012 R2 content.\n\n7\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.008\nAnd in this episode, we're going\nto focus in on some inventories.\n\n8\n00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.520\nWe're going to take a look at hardware\ninventories and software inventories.\n\n9\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.600\nAnd here to help us with that is\nthe one and only, Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.600\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.390\n>> I have a checklist of things that\nis going to indicate it's going well.\n\n12\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.983\n>> Good.\n>> When we think about inventories,\n\n13\n00:00:38.983 --> 00:00:39.841\nas Mike was saying,\n\n14\n00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:43.180\nwe've actually talked about these in\nour prior episode We went through this.\n\n15\n00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.700\nWe talked about setting up the client\nagent and default settings.\n\n16\n00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.690\nWe drilled down a little bit.\n\n17\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.793\nI'll share with you some of the\ninteresting little tidbits of information\n\n18\n00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:52.714\nabout both hardware and\nsoftware inventory,\n\n19\n00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:55.980\nthe fact that we can go through and be\nvery granular on the hardware inventory.\n\n20\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.770\nWe'll take a look at that.\n\n21\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.830\nWe felt that was pretty exciting.\n\n22\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.260\nWe talked about software inventory.\n\n23\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.500\nThe fact that we can collect\nfiles from individual machines.\n\n24\n00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.760\nAnd so we're gonna delve in and\ngo a little bit deeper there in the sense,\n\n25\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.750\nI'm gonna actually show you the agent,\nI'm gonna show you the settings.\n\n26\n00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.480\nWe haven't really previewed\nthe agent up until now.\n\n27\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.920\nWe've been talking about it, but\nwe actually have it installed.\n\n28\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.690\nWe'll go and we'll take a look at what\nit looks like in the control panel.\n\n29\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.600\nWe'll pull up the agent and show you what\nthe settings are once they are pushed\n\n30\n00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.880\nthe management point and configured.\n\n31\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.300\nWe'll go in and\nwe'll make a change to the hardware.\n\n32\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.630\nAgent settings.\n\n33\n00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.790\nSo, we'll see how to customize\nwhat's called a mav file,\n\n34\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.040\nthe sms_desktopmavfile,\nto update and modify and\n\n35\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.410\nconfigure the inventory to be\ndone a slightly different way.\n\n36\n00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.580\nWe'll take a look at wmi classes and\nmaybe add in an inventory class just for\n\n37\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.590\ngood measure.\n\n38\n00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.190\nAnd then, we'll go through,\nwe'll run an inventory cycle.\n\n39\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.340\nWe'll do a hardware and\na software inventory.\n\n40\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.360\nWe'll then look at the resources for it.\n\n41\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.240\nAt least we'll talk about what it is,\nsee what the outcome of that looks like.\n\n42\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.777\nSo we'll do a full little\nrunaround that way.\n\n43\n00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:56.014\nBefore we get started with that, I know\nthat we have put together just a couple of\n\n44\n00:01:56.014 --> 00:02:00.504\nlittle list items for you, as we often do,\nset the tone, give you a little appetizer\n\n45\n00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:04.553\nfor your knowledge palate, if you will,\nand get you excited about the whole\n\n46\n00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:08.650\nconcept of inventory because if we\ndon't it is rather dry and boring.\n\n47\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.230\nSo we're going to do that for\nyou to get you thinking about it and\n\n48\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.580\nget you up and running.\n\n49\n00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.330\nSo what I want to do is to just really\nthrow out some items that are going to\n\n50\n00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.680\nbe helpful for you to remember, to think\nabout kind of get you organized around\n\n51\n00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.650\nas we start thinking about getting into\nand ultimately doing our hands-on demo.\n\n52\n00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.890\nSo what do we use hardware and\nsoftware inventories for?\n\n53\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.420\nWe've talked about this already.\n\n54\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.720\nThe idea is obviously we wanna make sure\nthat we can think through gathering up\n\n55\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.330\nthis information, and when we get it,\nwhat do we do with it?\n\n56\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.335\nWe may wanna report on it.\n\n57\n00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:38.094\nMay wanna be able to look at\ncompliance activities and\n\n58\n00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:41.420\nspecify whether a certain machine\nis configured a certain way.\n\n59\n00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.880\nSo we think about what's called GRC,\ngovernance risk and compliance activities.\n\n60\n00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.380\nWithin the organization, and inventory can\nhelp us to drive through and manage this.\n\n61\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.550\nWe may think about getting ready for\nan audit.\n\n62\n00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.168\nSomebody may be coming in, and they want\nto see how certain machines are set up,\n\n63\n00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:00.730\nhow they're configured,\nhow they're managed.\n\n64\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.600\nWe can validate that by\nshowing them the inventory.\n\n65\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.535\nSo troubleshooting client problems,\n\n66\n00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:08.521\nmaintaining corporate standards based\non policy, collection of files through\n\n67\n00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:12.730\nsoftware inventory to validate that\na certain system's set up a certain way.\n\n68\n00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.410\nAnd all these things can be done through\ninventory, so, some of the uses of or\n\n69\n00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.890\nthe management uses of hardware and\nsoftware inventory very important.\n\n70\n00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.040\nHow is software inventory\ngoing to be collected?\n\n71\n00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.890\nWhat is the software inventory process?\n\n72\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.740\nWhen we think about it we\ncollect data directly from\n\n73\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.610\nfiles by reading the file header and\nthen gathering it up.\n\n74\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.170\nSo if we say hey we want everything that's\ngot a .txt extension, we're gonna look for\n\n75\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.980\nall that, look at the metadata\nto validate the file type,\n\n76\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.500\ngather that information up and\nthen collect it.\n\n77\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.930\nSo we're gonna go through and\nbe able to pull that in.\n\n78\n00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.292\nWe are gonna use, and\nI did talk about the Resource Explorer,\n\n79\n00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:47.850\nI mentioned it down there at the bottom.\n\n80\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.970\nWe're gonna use that or\n\n81\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.510\nat least take a look at that tool\nonce we're done with the inventory.\n\n82\n00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.954\nAnd we're gonna then be able to see\nwhat software is running on a system,\n\n83\n00:03:55.954 --> 00:03:57.761\nand/or what hardware inventory is,\n\n84\n00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:00.880\nand actually drill down and\nsee what the settings are in a system.\n\n85\n00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.396\nNot in real time, because it is flat\nbased on the captured inventory and\n\n86\n00:04:04.396 --> 00:04:06.180\nthe last time it was captured.\n\n87\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.747\nSo it's not dynamic, it is static, but\n\n88\n00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.850\nit's gonna show us very detailed granular\ninformation based on what is there.\n\n89\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.850\nSo it's gonna be kinda cool.\n\n90\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.660\nSo think about that.\n\n91\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.389\nNow some do's and\n\n92\n00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.460\ndon't's from a security perspective\nwith regards to client inventory.\n\n93\n00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.598\nWe should enable inventory encryption,\nwe should in other words make sure that\n\n94\n00:04:22.598 --> 00:04:25.700\nthe inventory data is sent and\nreceived in encrypted form.\n\n95\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.490\nThat way nobody can snoop that data and\npotentially take it off the wire.\n\n96\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.840\nWe might want to disable\nMIF file collections.\n\n97\n00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.760\nThe MIF concept we talked a little bit\nabout this when we did this, is going to\n\n98\n00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.020\nallow us to extend the inventory and as a\nresult of that get additional information.\n\n99\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.980\nWe may not want to do that because we may\nnot want to expose proprietary information\n\n100\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.030\nand the specifics of\nconfiguration that we are using.\n\n101\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.710\nSo we may not actually want to do that.\n\n102\n00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.780\nThat will be up to us because those MIF\nfiles can then actually be snooped by\n\n103\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.870\nsomebody, or gathered off the system and\nused to figure out how systems\n\n104\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.330\nare inventoried, or excuse me, how they\nare configured based on the inventory.\n\n105\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.500\nAnd that can lead to security\ncomplications, so just be aware of that.\n\n106\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.920\nIf we are using File Collection and we\nare getting copies of critical files and\n\n107\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.520\nwe are storing them on the server.\n\n108\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.380\nAgain, we have an issue they're storing\nsense of proprietary information.\n\n109\n00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.140\nSomebody maybe have gather that and\nuse it against us think about that.\n\n110\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.201\nAnd we also want to set specific deletion\nintervals for older inventory data and\n\n111\n00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:23.945\ncollected files we were generically\ncalled retention period, right.\n\n112\n00:05:23.945 --> 00:05:26.450\nBecause we don't want to leave\nthis stuff playing around forever,\n\n113\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.410\nwe could run into some issues.\n\n114\n00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.690\nAnd some concerns right?\n\n115\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.251\nSo just wanna be aware of that thing about\nthat, Mike's getting a little excited and\n\n116\n00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:36.163\nscrolling down there while I'm\ntalking before I'm actually able to\n\n117\n00:05:36.163 --> 00:05:37.320\nfinish my point.\n\n118\n00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.910\nWe're gonna come back to that stuff\nMike was just about to preview for\n\n119\n00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.850\nyou, which are inventory collection,\ntroubleshooting tasks, and a log so\n\n120\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.630\nit'll help us to do that.\n\n121\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.470\nBut we're first gonna take a look at\nhow inventory's actually done and\n\n122\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.408\ngo in a little deeper in\nthe demo environment, so\n\n123\n00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:51.750\nwe wanna go to my machine if we could and\ntake a look at that.\n\n124\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.363\nAnd then as soon as we're done\nwith that we'll come back and\n\n125\n00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:57.870\nwe'll take a look at those log files\nthat Mike was about to preview for us.\n\n126\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.540\nSo we're in the machine and we are as we\nalways do gonna just scroll in here first.\n\n127\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.235\nKind of show you where we are so\nyou know how to orient yourself.\n\n128\n00:06:05.235 --> 00:06:09.875\nSo before we get going here we are on\nour system servers you can see\n\n129\n00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:13.745\nwe are in the administration work\nspace where in client settings and\n\n130\n00:06:13.745 --> 00:06:17.045\nwe our default client settings up and\nrunning just say where we are.\n\n131\n00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:20.145\nSo the first thing we're gonna\ndo is actually minimize this and\n\n132\n00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:21.446\npretend it doesn't exist.\n\n133\n00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:22.982\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You maybe saying what the hell is\n\n134\n00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:23.494\nthat all about?\n\n135\n00:06:23.494 --> 00:06:24.433\nWell, I'm about to tell you.\n\n136\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.070\nWhen we want to go in and\n\n137\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.380\nplay with inventory,\nit's actually very straightforward.\n\n138\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.600\nYou saw me demo this in the prior lab that\nwe did so that part's not too difficult.\n\n139\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.320\nWe are going to run back through that\nagain in terms of the hardware and\n\n140\n00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.520\nsoftware settings.\n\n141\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.387\nBut if we want to get creative, we want\nto extend the inventory capabilities and\n\n142\n00:06:41.387 --> 00:06:43.927\nwe want to be able to not\njust gather what's there but\n\n143\n00:06:43.927 --> 00:06:46.490\nadd additional classes and\nor inventory material.\n\n144\n00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.820\nWe have to go outside the box, literally.\n\n145\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.274\nYou can see I'm outside the box and\nwe are outside the box, literally and\n\n146\n00:06:52.274 --> 00:06:53.070\nfiguratively.\n\n147\n00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.150\nThank you sir.\n\n148\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.250\nI appreciate your doing that for me.\n\n149\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.599\nSo we are outside the box and the idea\nbehind me outside the box in this case\n\n150\n00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:03.411\nis We are going to use what's\ncalled the SMS_def.mof files.\n\n151\n00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:05.640\nSo I'm gonna show you,\nnot only how to create one,\n\n152\n00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.460\nbut I'm gonna show you how to\ncheat a little bit at creating\n\n153\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.010\nbecause creating one is hard if\nyou have to write it from scratch.\n\n154\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.925\nBut let's be honest,\nyou're not gonna waste your time and\n\n155\n00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.160\ngo through the trouble of doing that.\n\n156\n00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.870\nYou're gonna do what smart\nIT administrators do.\n\n157\n00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.040\nYou're gonna copy shamelessly from other\npeople that have done it before you.\n\n158\n00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.865\nSo we're gonna talk about\nhow to do that right now.\n\n159\n00:07:21.865 --> 00:07:24.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so let's go back in here.\n\n160\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.863\nSo what I've done is I've actually\ngone out on the internet,\n\n161\n00:07:27.863 --> 00:07:32.731\nand instead of having Mike's machine show\nus how to do this I'm gonna actually\n\n162\n00:07:32.731 --> 00:07:37.449\njust do it from within my machine here and\nwhat you can see is I've gone out and\n\n163\n00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.358\nI have gone ahead and\ndone a Google search for sms_def.mof and\n\n164\n00:07:41.358 --> 00:07:46.487\nas I've always indicated you should do\ntacked on sccm 2012 on the end of that.\n\n165\n00:07:46.487 --> 00:07:50.162\nNow in this particular case\nyou wouldn't need to do that,\n\n166\n00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:54.147\ncuz sms_def.mof is unique to\nMicrosoft in the sccm product.\n\n167\n00:07:54.147 --> 00:07:57.465\nSo you're gonna get the same information\neither way but just to be safe.\n\n168\n00:07:57.465 --> 00:08:00.012\nPractice the common sense approach here.\n\n169\n00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:03.190\nAdd an SCCM 2012 so\nyou get where you need to be.\n\n170\n00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.518\nThat first item that comes up,\nyou can see it there, create or\n\n171\n00:08:06.518 --> 00:08:09.080\nedit the Sms_def.mof file through TechNet.\n\n172\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.425\nIt's going to give you the link\nthat you're going to want to go to.\n\n173\n00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:16.000\nSo we've gone ahead, I've gone ahead,\nI should say, and I have done that.\n\n174\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.050\nI've clicked on it.\n\n175\n00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.740\nLet me just bring that up so\nyou can see that one here.\n\n176\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:30.545\nAnd I've gone in and I have,\nBrought this up here.\n\n177\n00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:34.400\nAnd what we get is basically a how\nto on how to create this file.\n\n178\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.390\nWe'll just create a text file and\nwe call it Sms_def.mof but it's empty.\n\n179\n00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.300\nEmpty files don't get us very far by\nthe way, neither do empty gas tanks,\n\n180\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.610\njust in case you're wondering.\n\n181\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.880\nUnless you have shoes and\nyou're planning on walking.\n\n182\n00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.130\nI just thought I'd free associate for\n\n183\n00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.010\na minute while I'm thinking\nabout what I need to do next.\n\n184\n00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.890\nThat way you can be\nthoroughly confused and\n\n185\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.615\nnot realize that I have no\nclue what I'm about to say.\n\n186\n00:08:53.615 --> 00:08:55.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, all kidding aside.\n\n187\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.000\nWhat do we we get here when we do this?\n\n188\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.720\nWhat we get is the nice people in\nMicrosoft at Technet actually put out\n\n189\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.040\na sample SNS_def.mof file for us and\nput all the details out there.\n\n190\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.440\nNow this one happens to be associated\nwith Microsoft BitLocker Administration\n\n191\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.200\nand Monitoring.\n\n192\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.100\nWe know that because they've\ndone to the trouble of doing\n\n193\n00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.530\nthe right thing when they wrote the file\nand labeled it right at the top.\n\n194\n00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.920\nBut, what this also does is gives us the\ngeneral structure if we copy all the code\n\n195\n00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.540\nto create the SMS_def.mof file,\nand then manipulate and\n\n196\n00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.130\nmodify it to our specific needs.\n\n197\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.040\nSo what you typically do, and\nwhat you will see the best practice\n\n198\n00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.940\ncontent out there in the blogs and\non Technet itself will tell you is, hey,\n\n199\n00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.560\ntake this format and then modify\nit as opposed to writing your own.\n\n200\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.130\nBecause when you look at\nthe structure of this file\n\n201\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.460\nyou're gonna see that\nit's fairly detailed.\n\n202\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.800\nAnd so I've gone ahead and\n\n203\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.710\nthere's this nice little area right\nat the top there where it says Copy.\n\n204\n00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.970\nYou can see it right there.\n\n205\n00:09:54.495 --> 00:09:55.585\nI can't zoom in any further.\n\n206\n00:09:55.585 --> 00:09:57.355\nIf you don't get it from there, I'm sorry.\n\n207\n00:09:57.355 --> 00:09:58.645\nBut, guess what, you're on your own.\n\n208\n00:09:58.645 --> 00:09:59.755\nYou're gonna have to write.\n\n209\n00:09:59.755 --> 00:10:03.575\nYou can copy and when you do copy that,\nit copy's all of the code for\n\n210\n00:10:03.575 --> 00:10:04.895\nyou, right out of the thing.\n\n211\n00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:07.150\nSo that thing Microsoft done\nreally nicely, recently.\n\n212\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.680\nEspecially with PowerShell, and\n\n213\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.640\nyou have a scripting center with\nall the scripts they put out.\n\n214\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.240\nThey give you that copy feature,\nputs all the code into the clipboard, but\n\n215\n00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.960\ndoes it with the proper line ordering and\n\n216\n00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.790\nnumbering, doesn't change\nthe formatting in any way.\n\n217\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.960\nYou can then drop it right in.\n\n218\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.110\nAll I did was copy it.\n\n219\n00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.560\nUse the Clipboard function.\n\n220\n00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.590\nPut it into my empty shell\nSms_def.mof file on my desktop.\n\n221\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.120\nSo I'm gonna show you that right now.\n\n222\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.120\nAnd then I just button that thing up and\nsaved it.\n\n223\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.220\nAnd then we're gonna go and\nahead and we're gonna import that.\n\n224\n00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.250\nSo I've created that file here.\n\n225\n00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.360\nYou can see it looks suspiciously like\nthe one we were just looking at because\n\n226\n00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.210\nwell I'm shameless in my\ncopying capabilities.\n\n227\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.840\nAnd so\nwhat you can see is that I went ahead and\n\n228\n00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.080\nI just programmed that in by just\nsimply literally cutting and pasting.\n\n229\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.050\nNow you can see when I said hey you\ngotta pay attention to the structure,\n\n230\n00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.250\nit's a fairly detailed file.\n\n231\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.930\nIt's got probably over 100\nlines of text in it, and\n\n232\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.800\nit's all set up specifically to achieve\ncertain results specific to Bit Locker.\n\n233\n00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.960\nNow, you are gonna have to modify\nthis if you wanna add in or\n\n234\n00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.815\nextend the inventory for\na different set of class objects,.\n\n235\n00:11:04.815 --> 00:11:09.665\nBut if you go out and start searching\nSms_def.mof, USCCM 2012, and then\n\n236\n00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:14.725\nWindows class Win32 battery or whatever\nbecause you wanna extend or do something\n\n237\n00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:17.752\nthere, you can find additional files that\nhave been set up for specific things.\n\n238\n00:11:17.752 --> 00:11:20.722\nSo you're gonna have to do a little\nsearching, you may have to figure out,\n\n239\n00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:23.152\nget a little creative,\nto get this to where you want it to be.\n\n240\n00:11:23.152 --> 00:11:26.002\nBut we can import these\nsettings by simply starting out\n\n241\n00:11:26.002 --> 00:11:27.292\nwith a template like this and\nthen modifying.\n\n242\n00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:29.242\nSo that's what we're gonna do, in effect,\n\n243\n00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:31.752\ncuz we're not gonna go ahead\nreinvent the wheel, that's for\n\n244\n00:11:31.752 --> 00:11:34.372\npeople that don't understand how\nto use Google, we know better.\n\n245\n00:11:34.372 --> 00:11:36.222\nSo we've created that file.\n\n246\n00:11:36.222 --> 00:11:39.392\nNow that we've done that, we're gonna\nactually go back into the console,\n\n247\n00:11:39.392 --> 00:11:40.909\nso we're gonna open that back up.\n\n248\n00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.880\nAnd now, what we're gonna do is go\ninto the default client settings.\n\n249\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.590\nWe're gonna go to properties, and\nwe're gonna go into the hardware agent, or\n\n250\n00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.360\nthe hardware inventory agent setting.\n\n251\n00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.500\nSo we're gonna go to hardware inventory,\nand we're gonna go to set classes.\n\n252\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.560\nNow, we've done this already, so\nI'm not zooming in for you, there.\n\n253\n00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.130\nI'm gonna zoom in,\n\n254\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:03.330\nin just a second, cuz I wanna specifically\nfocus in on the next step in the process.\n\n255\n00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.440\nAnd so what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna be able to go in and\n\n256\n00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.370\nwe are actually going to be\nable to use this mof file and\n\n257\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.550\nbe able to effectively add in or\nimport settings.\n\n258\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.750\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ngo ahead and I'm just gonna zoom in so\n\n259\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.210\nyou could see it down there at the bottom.\n\n260\n00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.152\nWe're gonna import that mof file and\nadd those settings in, in this case for\n\n261\n00:12:22.152 --> 00:12:23.889\nthe BitLocker stuff that we did.\n\n262\n00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:28.429\nRight so as you'll look here,\nyou'll see BitLocker, Win32 right up here,\n\n263\n00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:31.544\nis there but it is not selected,\nit is not configured,\n\n264\n00:12:31.544 --> 00:12:34.310\nhas no settings associated with it at all.\n\n265\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:39.230\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ngo import, we're gonna go find that,\n\n266\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.660\nnow I have this really\nincredibly cool thing that I do.\n\n267\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.180\nIt's called putting\nthings on the desktop so\n\n268\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.250\nI never lose them when\nI have to import them.\n\n269\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.580\nSo I always know where my files\nbecause I often hear from people hey,\n\n270\n00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.140\nyou did that really cool thing in\nclass and when they did that and\n\n271\n00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.040\nI forgot where you put the file well,\nduh right?\n\n272\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.730\nYou put it on the desktop so\nyou know how to find it, right?\n\n273\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.130\nAll right, so what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna go look for the mof file.\n\n274\n00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.610\nNow, you'll notice I'm not finding it and\nlet me explain why?\n\n275\n00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.680\nAll right,\ndoes any body know why I'm not finding it?\n\n276\n00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.650\n>> It could be a file type.\n\n277\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.620\n>> It is a file type, you know what\nhappens when you're not paying attention\n\n278\n00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.490\nto detail and you're rushing to do\n5000 things and you create a file.\n\n279\n00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:20.990\nIt is a text file.\n\n280\n00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.790\n>> Yep.\n\n281\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.500\n>> And it is a text file\nthat actually is type .txt.\n\n282\n00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.533\nSo it's Sms_def.mof.txt actually, right?\n\n283\n00:13:28.533 --> 00:13:29.450\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n284\n00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.170\n>> So, what we have to do is we\nhave to go in and do the following.\n\n285\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:39.050\nLet's go to Save As, and\nlet's save it as type not .txt [LAUGH],\n\n286\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:44.950\nbut type all files so that it actually\nbecomes sms_def.mof for real.\n\n287\n00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.460\nYes, I do wanna replace it.\n\n288\n00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:46.990\nDuh.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.110\n>> Oh my gosh!\n\n290\n00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.930\nThe inanity of these things.\n\n291\n00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.170\nJust unbelievable.\n\n292\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:58.230\nAll right, so we're gonna come back here,\nwe're gonna do this one more time and\n\n293\n00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.930\ngo in, grab the properties and\ndo the import here.\n\n294\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.370\nSo let me go do that, bring that back up.\n\n295\n00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.060\nWhere are my properties?\n\n296\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.235\nBring me my properties.\n\n297\n00:14:07.235 --> 00:14:08.630\n>> [LAUGH] One the way, sir.\n\n298\n00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.930\n>> You saw me click on it.\n\n299\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.050\n>> I did.\n>> I'm not fooling around,\n\n300\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.430\nI did do that, didn't I?\n\n301\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.310\nThere we go.\nAll right.\n\n302\n00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.190\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.300\n>> Just in time for\n\n304\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.600\nme to make a really bad decision.\n\n305\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.800\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna go to set classes here.\n\n306\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.790\nAnd we're gonna go back to Import.\n\n307\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.235\nAnd we are going to go to our Desktop.\n\n308\n00:14:27.952 --> 00:14:29.995\nAnd where are you you little bugger?\n\n309\n00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:31.230\nWhy are you not showing up?\n\n310\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.710\nI think I know why, let me see.\n\n311\n00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.750\nLeast I hope I know why.\n\n312\n00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.630\nWhy are we not seeing my file?\n\n313\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.230\n>> Well you know, is that machine hiding\nthe file extensions from your view.\n\n314\n00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.150\nSometimes notepad has\nthat as that habit of-\n\n315\n00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.610\n>> It could, it could be.\n\n316\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:56.430\nAll right, so let's go figure that out\nreally quickly, let me just go see.\n\n317\n00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:03.860\nIf, it won't be a Windows Explorer thing,\nright?\n\n318\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.566\nThat would be on, yeah.\n\n319\n00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:11.350\nView options, I believe,\n\n320\n00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:15.960\nchange folder and search options and\nI think under view.\n\n321\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:23.390\nAnd Show hidden files and\nfolders, and we also want to make\n\n322\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.130\nsure that we are, what's the other one?\n\n323\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:29.920\nHide, hide, hide.\n\n324\n00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.720\nHide extensions for known file types.\n\n325\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.470\nWe don't wanna do that.\n\n326\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:37.188\nAll right, so we're gonna do that,\ndo that, do that.\n\n327\n00:15:37.188 --> 00:15:40.509\nAnd let's see.\n\n328\n00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:42.970\nIf-\n>> No THT-\n\n329\n00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.250\n>> There it is right there.\n\n330\n00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.020\nThat's why.\n\n331\n00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.220\nAll right this is why you\nalways need a buddy when you\n\n332\n00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:48.770\ngo diving-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.981\n>> and when you go into FCCM and\n\n334\n00:15:50.981 --> 00:15:52.044\noperate it.\n\n335\n00:15:52.044 --> 00:15:58.155\nCuz if you don't have that you're gonna\nwind up With that, all right, there we go.\n\n336\n00:15:58.155 --> 00:15:59.931\nThird time's a charm.\n\n337\n00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:00.779\nIf it's not, I'm done.\n\n338\n00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:03.089\nI'm throwing down the mouse and\nI'm walking out.\n\n339\n00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:06.770\n[LAUGH] All right, let's go back in\nhere this time it should show up.\n\n340\n00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:07.400\nJust give me a second,\n\n341\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.310\nwe'll bring properties back up, and\nlet's go in the hardware inventory here.\n\n342\n00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:19.960\nGo back to set classes, scroll down a wee\nbit there, import, and there we go.\n\n343\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.480\nLook at that.\n\n344\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.140\nIt only took three times to figure\nout how to get that working.\n\n345\n00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.450\nSo we got our sms_def.mof file there,\nyou can see it right there.\n\n346\n00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.714\nWe're going to go ahead, we're going to\nimport that, going to click open, and\n\n347\n00:16:30.714 --> 00:16:31.966\nyou'll see it has been added.\n\n348\n00:16:31.966 --> 00:16:35.570\nNow notice here select inventory items\nyou want to install before we actually do\n\n349\n00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.980\nthis, let me just zoom in so\nyou can see this.\n\n350\n00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.200\nImport both hardware inventory classes and\nhardware inventory class settings up at\n\n351\n00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.730\nthe top, Import inventory classes only,\nImport inventory class settings only.\n\n352\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.640\nWell, the class without the settings\ndoesn't do us a lot of good.\n\n353\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.585\nThe settings without the class to link it\nto, that's just plain old-fashioned dumb.\n\n354\n00:16:52.585 --> 00:16:53.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n355\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.590\nwe're gonna do both because if we don't\ndo both, we're not gonna be able to get\n\n356\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.720\nthe benefit of all that great code\nthat I went out and stole shamelessly.\n\n357\n00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.140\nSo, we're gonna do both, right?\n\n358\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.990\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna import those, and if you look\n\n359\n00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:09.580\nat this area right down here, BitLocker\nencryption details, BitLocker policy,\n\n360\n00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.640\ncomputing system and operating system are\nall extended, are all gonna be brought in.\n\n361\n00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.140\nSo we're gonna get the benefit of all\nthat, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n362\n00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.500\nwe're gonna import that, gonna click yes,\nand that's gonna bring it in, and\n\n363\n00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.650\nwe're then going to have all that\ninformation available to us.\n\n364\n00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.310\nAnd you'll notice that Bit Locker itself,\nright down here,\n\n365\n00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.350\nstill has not been configured.\n\n366\n00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.356\nBut notice all the stuff\nwe have up top now.\n\n367\n00:17:34.356 --> 00:17:39.170\nBitLocker Encryption Details, BitLocker\nPolicy, Computer System Extended,\n\n368\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.640\nOperating System Extended,\nall four are selected up top.\n\n369\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.130\nThose were not there before, all right?\n\n370\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:47.890\nSo those have now been brought in,\nand those are basically going to,\n\n371\n00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.570\nas you can see,\nbring in this kind of information.\n\n372\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.550\nThis is the BitLocker encryption details.\n\n373\n00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.500\nIt'll show us all that.\n\n374\n00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.390\nThese are all the class and setting\nobjects that were set up in that file.\n\n375\n00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:03.180\nSo like I said, we can bring these in,\nand/or we can go out and\n\n376\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.790\nfind another file that will have the\nsettings that we want, cuz this may not be\n\n377\n00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.380\nreally what we wanna do, but the idea is\njust to bring that into to show that you.\n\n378\n00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.888\nAnd then once we've done that, we actually\nthen can configure it, set it up,\n\n379\n00:18:12.888 --> 00:18:15.331\nand then we can go out,\nupdate the agent settings, and\n\n380\n00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:18.789\nthen push out an update through our\nmanagement point, and then actually have\n\n381\n00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:22.014\nthat hardware inventory be configured,\nand collected the right way.\n\n382\n00:18:22.014 --> 00:18:25.224\nNow, before we do that, we're going to\nalso take a look at how to add a new\n\n383\n00:18:25.224 --> 00:18:26.974\ninventory class from a WMI name space.\n\n384\n00:18:26.974 --> 00:18:29.265\nWant to go ahead and we want to go ahead\nand we want to walk through that real\n\n385\n00:18:29.265 --> 00:18:30.899\nquickly in case you ever\nget stopped on the street.\n\n386\n00:18:30.899 --> 00:18:33.426\nSomebody says to you hey,\nyou know how to do that, right,\n\n387\n00:18:33.426 --> 00:18:35.490\ncuz I'm gonna be really\nupset if you don't.\n\n388\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.410\nInstead of just running away like a smart\nperson, you're actually going to talk to\n\n389\n00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.040\nthe lunatic who's trying to get\nthat information out of you, and\n\n390\n00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.100\nyou're going to engage them in\na conversation because you care, right?\n\n391\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.830\nSo we're gonna make sure you're armed for\nthat conversation just in case.\n\n392\n00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.130\nSo what we're gonna do is go back\ninto our hardware inventory.\n\n393\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.830\nWe're gonna go back to set classes,\njust where we were, but instead of using\n\n394\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.640\nthe import feature, this time we're gonna\nuse the add feature right down there.\n\n395\n00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.480\nSame thing,\njust you know a couple of boxes over.\n\n396\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.720\nSo we're gonna click Add there.\n\n397\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.680\nWe have our Add Hardware Inventory Class.\n\n398\n00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.560\nWe have to connect to the name space,\ndo the WMI namespace.\n\n399\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.500\nIf you remember, we took a look at this\nduring the very first demo we did in\n\n400\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.990\nthe intro, in the first episode, where\nwe went in and did the introduction, and\n\n401\n00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:23.960\nwalked through and did the,\nnot the introduction, did the install and\n\n402\n00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.850\nI showed you how to do the ADSI edit.\n\n403\n00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.970\nWe did ADSI edit in the install and\nwe actually connected to the namespace and\n\n404\n00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.200\nconfigured systems management container.\n\n405\n00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.050\nWe're gonna connect to that same\nnamespace in order to be able to do this.\n\n406\n00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.670\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ndo that, the WMI namespace.\n\n407\n00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.520\nWe're gonna connect, we're going\nto specify the computer name so\n\n408\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.729\nyou could see we have that there.\n\n409\n00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:48.060\nWe are going to specify the WMI namespace,\nthe WMI namespace,\n\n410\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.810\nyou have to zoom in so\nyou can see that, is always root/cimv2.\n\n411\n00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.030\nThat's gonna be the root WMI namespace,\nand then we're gonna be able to,\n\n412\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.060\nif we are not connecting locally, we are,\nso we're not gonna worry about it, but\n\n413\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.240\nif we weren't, we would then\nhave to specify a credential.\n\n414\n00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.340\nWe don't have to worry about that so\nthat's not a big deal,\n\n415\n00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.822\ncuz we're connecting to local machine.\n\n416\n00:20:04.822 --> 00:20:06.179\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna connect.\n\n417\n00:20:06.179 --> 00:20:09.550\nWe're going to bring in our classes,\nand you can see there,\n\n418\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.520\nwe have our WMI class list now.\n\n419\n00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.830\nSo we can add in something that may\nnot have already been selected or\n\n420\n00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.010\nbe provided there.\n\n421\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.420\nSo we're going to be able to go in and\neffectively go shopping.\n\n422\n00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.375\nIt's like a smorgasbord,\nthat's a really fun word to say.\n\n423\n00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:22.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Smorgasbord,\n\n424\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.325\nif you can spell that by the way,\nthen good for you, all right.\n\n425\n00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:28.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n426\n00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.930\nwe're gonna, yeah, think about\nwhich class we may want to add.\n\n427\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.250\nNow we would obviously need to\nknow what class is already there,\n\n428\n00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.470\nand we'd have to have a plan for\nthis, right?\n\n429\n00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.490\nWe're not going to do this off the cuff,\ncuz that would be foolish.\n\n430\n00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.710\nSo, we're going to actually, in theory,\nin the real world, have a plan for\n\n431\n00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:46.420\nsetting this up, but\nhere we have no plan, this is live TV.\n\n432\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.820\nIf we plan things,\nthey wouldn't be exciting, and\n\n433\n00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.880\nyou wouldn't be having\nas much fun as we are.\n\n434\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.328\nSo what we're going to do is\njust randomly choose something.\n\n435\n00:20:53.328 --> 00:20:55.212\nWell let's go ahead and\nlet's take a look, for instance,\n\n436\n00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:56.241\nat what some of our options are.\n\n437\n00:20:56.241 --> 00:21:01.670\nI'm thinking Win32_FolderRedirection may\nbe good because that may be good to know.\n\n438\n00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.970\nSomebody's bouncing folders around and\nmoving stuff so that may be cool.\n\n439\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.970\nWe may want to take a look\nat some of those settings.\n\n440\n00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.990\nI'm thinking Disk Quota\nmay be good as well.\n\n441\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:13.780\nAnd you'll notice that we have a bunch\nof these that say yes they exist,\n\n442\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:14.770\nor no they don't.\n\n443\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.845\nClearly, the ones that don't exist are the\nones we'd want to target and potentially\n\n444\n00:21:17.845 --> 00:21:20.763\nbring in, because those are the ones that\nare not currently being used, right?\n\n445\n00:21:20.763 --> 00:21:24.768\nSo I'm gonna select Disk Quota.\n\n446\n00:21:24.768 --> 00:21:27.930\nI'm going to select Defrag analysis,\nand Folder redirection.\n\n447\n00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.177\nSo I'm gonna highlight those three.\n\n448\n00:21:31.177 --> 00:21:35.930\nI'm going to select one of them,\ntwo of them, three of them as I do.\n\n449\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.570\nYeah, just make sure that catches\nup with me there, click OK.\n\n450\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.370\nWe are saving the inventory\nclasses as you can see.\n\n451\n00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.550\nSo it's going through and\nsaving them and writing them back in.\n\n452\n00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:52.610\nAnd then once we're done with that,\nwe'll wait for that to come across.\n\n453\n00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.320\nOnce we're done with that, we then will\nbe able to look in our master list back\n\n454\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.570\nbehind there, and they will show up.\n\n455\n00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.170\nIt will take a moment or two to save.\n\n456\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.150\nThere we go, kicks off, gets it in there.\n\n457\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.466\nAnd so now we have those, and\nif we go searching for them,\n\n458\n00:22:03.466 --> 00:22:04.639\nwe actually will find them.\n\n459\n00:22:04.639 --> 00:22:06.277\nWe did what, defrag analysis, right?\n\n460\n00:22:06.277 --> 00:22:06.810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n461\n00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.713\n>> So, it would have to go down and.\n\n462\n00:22:14.356 --> 00:22:16.100\n>> Defrag and folder redirection.\n\n463\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.860\n>> Yeah, but they're gonna be Win32 and\nthey're gonna be listed, and I think,\n\n464\n00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.500\nif I'm not mistaken, they may wind up\nat the bottom, cuz we have it open and\n\n465\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.450\nnot be alphabetized.\n\n466\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.890\nRight, yeah,\ndown at the bottom there, lets see,\n\n467\n00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.450\nI don't remember if it\nshows up automatically.\n\n468\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.340\nI am out of order if they actually\nalphabetized and show up.\n\n469\n00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.090\nThey are in there, we just have to\ngo search for them and find them.\n\n470\n00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.320\nI just don't remember what\norder it puts them in.\n\n471\n00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.030\nAnd they may just, oh they're right up\nat the top, they showed up at the top,\n\n472\n00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.047\nthey haven't ordered yet.\n\n473\n00:22:43.047 --> 00:22:45.209\nSo you could see them right there,\nDefrag Analysis,\n\n474\n00:22:45.209 --> 00:22:47.190\nalways makes sense to start\nat the top by the way.\n\n475\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.145\nNot start at the bottom.\n\n476\n00:22:48.145 --> 00:22:49.350\n[LAUGH] That's why we didn't see them.\n\n477\n00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.580\nSo you could see Defrag Analysis is there.\n\n478\n00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.510\nDisk Quota, redirect is right\nthere at the top of locker stuff.\n\n479\n00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.550\nAnd then if we go ahead and\nclose that, bring it back up,\n\n480\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.900\nit will filter it out, sort it and\nactually put it in the right order.\n\n481\n00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.440\nSo we could see them there,\nso we added those in.\n\n482\n00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.600\nSo adding it in through\na WMI class extension,\n\n483\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.420\nreally just going in and\ntaking the already declared classes, but\n\n484\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.490\nones that have not been loaded yet,\nand effectively loading them in.\n\n485\n00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:14.520\nSo once we've done all that and we have\nall that set up, we can go ahead and\n\n486\n00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.680\neffectively decide that, hey,\nyou know what, it's probably time for\n\n487\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.600\nus to go ahead and\nto run the hardware inventory.\n\n488\n00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.730\nBut before we do that,\nlet's just talk about one other item here,\n\n489\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.140\nwhich is our export item.\n\n490\n00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:27.577\nThat button right there.\n\n491\n00:23:27.577 --> 00:23:32.503\nExport allows us to export our hardware\ninventory configuration to a MOF file,\n\n492\n00:23:32.503 --> 00:23:36.622\nright, so we can effectively save\nthat as a SNSM_def.mof file,\n\n493\n00:23:36.622 --> 00:23:41.350\ngive it to somebody else to let them\nimport all the stuff that we customized.\n\n494\n00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:46.081\nSo if we wanna create an sms_def.mof\nfile out of our configuration,\n\n495\n00:23:46.081 --> 00:23:51.050\nwe can do that then I could do through\ngive that to Mike, let him use that and\n\n496\n00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:55.856\nrun that on his system, and he would\nbe able to do that if he wanted to, so\n\n497\n00:23:55.856 --> 00:24:03.270\nI can go ahead in there and\nI can Just type ams.mof.\n\n498\n00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.680\nI'm just gonna put it on\nthe desktop just so we can see it.\n\n499\n00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.780\nI'm not too worried about what\nit's called right now, right?\n\n500\n00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.380\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\nhave that there.\n\n501\n00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.940\nAnd then we're gonna click\nOK here just to set that up.\n\n502\n00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.780\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nclick OK here for just a moment, so\n\n503\n00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.890\nthat way we can go out to the desktop real\nquick, just take a look at that file.\n\n504\n00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:25.550\nAnd we'll see we have our\nans.mof file right there.\n\n505\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:32.740\nAnd if we were to open that up,\nWindows being the good machine that it is,\n\n506\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.588\ndoesn't say hey, let me use the Swiss\narmy knife of network computing.\n\n507\n00:24:37.588 --> 00:24:40.600\nAnd automatically choose Notepad,\nbut it prompts us, and\n\n508\n00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:45.350\nthen we're able to then go in,\nas you can see, and get our SMS.\n\n509\n00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.250\nIt would be, obviously,\n\n510\n00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.240\nimportant for us to rename it SMS_dev.mof\nfor it to work the right way.\n\n511\n00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.060\nBut we can then use that exported and then\ntell Mike hey, rename the file this and\n\n512\n00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.530\nthen make sure you know how to use it.\n\n513\n00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.410\nAnd then he'd be able to import that and\n\n514\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.140\nget all the inventory configuration that\nwe've done and have it at his disposal.\n\n515\n00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.730\nSo he would be able to use that to\ncustomize his own inventory if he wanted\n\n516\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.020\nto after we've done all the hard work and\nthen make him look like the super star.\n\n517\n00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.610\nBut he's not kind enough to\ntell his boss that it was us.\n\n518\n00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.150\nHe claims credit for it, that bastard.\n\n519\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.470\n>> I learned how to shamelessly steal.\n\n520\n00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.005\n>> You did.\n\n521\n00:25:14.005 --> 00:25:15.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That you did.\n\n522\n00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.100\nAll right, so that can happen,\nand then what do we do?\n\n523\n00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.090\nNext stop on the road trip here,\nis we're gonna go and\n\n524\n00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.830\ntake a look at the Configuration Manager\nagent client, and see how it's set up.\n\n525\n00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.050\nTalk about that manual pull of\nthe policy that I said we could do,\n\n526\n00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.560\nwe're gonna take a look at how to do that.\n\n527\n00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.380\nSo when we zoom in to the Control Panel\nyou will see that right\n\n528\n00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.520\ndown there at the bottom we have\nthe Configuration Manager client.\n\n529\n00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.020\nWe've been talking about it but we haven't\nactually gone in and looked at it yet.\n\n530\n00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.080\nThat is by the way if\nyou're looking at the.\n\n531\n00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.156\nAm I the only one, by the way,\n\n532\n00:25:42.156 --> 00:25:46.241\nthat hates that category view\nthat Microsoft has gone to?\n\n533\n00:25:46.241 --> 00:25:48.889\nRight, so\nif you're doing the category view in here,\n\n534\n00:25:48.889 --> 00:25:51.193\nthen you should just go ahead and\nchange that and\n\n535\n00:25:51.193 --> 00:25:55.110\nput in large icons cuz this is the\nstupidest thing I think I've ever seen.\n\n536\n00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:59.480\nBut if you do like this and\nyou wanna keep it this way, that's okay.\n\n537\n00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.750\nBut I'm not gonna help you any more.\n\n538\n00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:01.575\nSo stop watching.\n\n539\n00:26:01.575 --> 00:26:03.298\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if you wanna keep it that way,\n\n540\n00:26:03.298 --> 00:26:07.040\nyou're gonna go to system and security cuz\nthat's where we gonna find the client.\n\n541\n00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.830\nIf you don't change it over\nto the large icon you will\n\n542\n00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.460\nsee it listed alphabetically,\njust go to System and Security,\n\n543\n00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.290\ncuz it'll be right in there and\nthat's where you're gonna find it.\n\n544\n00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.500\nOf course, you could spend ten minutes\nclicking around trying to find it,\n\n545\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.970\nthat would also be ever so much fun,\nbut you probably don't wanna do that.\n\n546\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.920\nSo we're gonna go into\nConfiguration Manager,\n\n547\n00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.630\nwe're gonna bring the client properties\nup, and we wanna spend a minute in here.\n\n548\n00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.500\nSo we haven't really poked\naround in here before,\n\n549\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.120\nit's probably good to take a look at this.\n\n550\n00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.150\nSo we have a General tab, and\n\n551\n00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:37.230\non the General tab we have,\nas you can see here, some information.\n\n552\n00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.900\nWe have our assigned management point so\nwe can see that.\n\n553\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.340\nWe have our client certificate,\nit is self-signed.\n\n554\n00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.585\nWe have our ability to see\nthe connection type, currently intranet,\n\n555\n00:26:45.585 --> 00:26:47.320\nmeaning managed internally.\n\n556\n00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.055\nWe have our site code,\nthere's our site code,\n\n557\n00:26:50.055 --> 00:26:54.890\nSMS: is not part of the site code that is\njust the designator for the site code.\n\n558\n00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.030\nPLB is the actual site code.\n\n559\n00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:59.490\nThen unique identifier,\nthat's effectively our GUID.\n\n560\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.110\nAnd then our version,\nthat's the client build number by the way.\n\n561\n00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.720\nSo that's the build number for\nthe client agent.\n\n562\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.220\n>> Okay.\n>> Right.\n\n563\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.280\nSo that's the build number for that.\n\n564\n00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.840\nSo just so we know what that is.\n\n565\n00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.890\nThen under Components, we have a listing\nfor all of the components, and\n\n566\n00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:19.010\nwe can see whether or not they\nare installed and/or enabled or disabled.\n\n567\n00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:22.150\nInstalled means it's there but\nit is not turned on.\n\n568\n00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.490\nEnabled means it is there and working.\n\n569\n00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.320\nDisabled means it is not functioning.\n\n570\n00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.530\nSo, for instance,\nwe have the Compliance and\n\n571\n00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:34.420\nSettings Management solution\nactually turned on and enabled.\n\n572\n00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.690\nWe have Hardware Inventory Agent turned\non and enabled, we can see that.\n\n573\n00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.030\nNow this list is going to\nbe directly controlled\n\n574\n00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.220\nby the default client settings and\nthe options for yes, no, turn on and\n\n575\n00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.030\nconfigure that we selected and\nset up in the console.\n\n576\n00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.420\nThat's what's gonna directly\ndrive the settings we see here.\n\n577\n00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.020\nActions are gonna be a derivative of\nwhat those clients' settings are, and\n\n578\n00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.850\nwhat's been turned on and enabled is\nthen gonna feed this list right here.\n\n579\n00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.970\nSo when I talked about not waiting that\n60 minutes for that policy refresh and\n\n580\n00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:08.250\nI say hey, we're gonna come in here\nmanually and highlight machine policy and\n\n581\n00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.980\nour user policy retrieval and\nevaluation cycle.\n\n582\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.420\nWe would do exactly that.\n\n583\n00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.390\nWe would highlight one of these like so.\n\n584\n00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.550\nWe would come right over here\nwhere it says Run Now, like so.\n\n585\n00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:27.220\nAnd we would go ahead and we would\nsimply click on the Run Now button and\n\n586\n00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.460\nthen it would go ahead and\nkick off a Policy Retrieval cycle.\n\n587\n00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.020\nWhether it's been 60 minutes,\nfive minutes, or whatever\n\n588\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.600\nwe can do it manually as often as we need\nto, so we're able to go in and do that.\n\n589\n00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.020\nSo we can do that and update it and\n\n590\n00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.540\nget that hardware inventory update\nthat we did to come on down.\n\n591\n00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.360\nSo we can do that, so we'll go ahead and\n\n592\n00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.280\nwe'll run a machine\npolicy retrieval cycle.\n\n593\n00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.600\nWe'll run a user policy retrieval cycle.\n\n594\n00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.400\nThose are gonna update\nthe client's agent settings and\n\n595\n00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.320\nthe actions associated with it.\n\n596\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.570\nThat's not gonna run hardware inventory.\n\n597\n00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.220\nThat's gonna simply bring\ndown the new policy settings.\n\n598\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:04.010\nIf we want to run hardware inventory\nourself manually, we can do that as well.\n\n599\n00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:09.320\nAll we have to do is come over here, and\n\n600\n00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.220\nwe just simply have to choose\nhardware inventory and run that.\n\n601\n00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.290\nAnd if we want to do software,\nwe do file collection cycle.\n\n602\n00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.490\nWhich is our ability to grab files,\nand/or software inventory,\n\n603\n00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.320\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n604\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.090\nJust remember, file collection is\na subset of software inventory.\n\n605\n00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.650\nWe could do one or both, right?\n\n606\n00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:25.260\nSo we can do that.\n\n607\n00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.987\nBut we're gonna give\nthat a couple minutes,\n\n608\n00:29:26.987 --> 00:29:29.989\nwe'll run that as soon as the policy\nretrieval finishes and the configuration\n\n609\n00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:32.870\non the MOF file is updated so\nwe're gonna get back to that in a minute.\n\n610\n00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.690\nJust want to finish our core here first.\n\n611\n00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.868\nWe have our site code area here,\nnow we can go in and\n\n612\n00:29:37.868 --> 00:29:40.833\nwe can see that our site\ncode is hard coded PLB.\n\n613\n00:29:40.833 --> 00:29:43.657\nWe can go into configure the settings and\nchange the site code and\n\n614\n00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:45.495\nactually do auto discovery if we need to.\n\n615\n00:29:45.495 --> 00:29:49.446\nWe can also put in a DNS suffix and\nuse that to locate the management point if\n\n616\n00:29:49.446 --> 00:29:52.633\nwe need to, if we're not having\nluck with auto discovery,\n\n617\n00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:56.350\nfor any reason something's\nnot working the right way.\n\n618\n00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.569\nWe also can specify what\nthe cache sittings are here that\n\n619\n00:30:00.569 --> 00:30:04.878\nthe client is gonna use in\norder to cache applications and\n\n620\n00:30:04.878 --> 00:30:09.668\nprograms that are being deployed for\nsoftware installation.\n\n621\n00:30:09.668 --> 00:30:13.781\nCuz every machine has a local cache\ncalled the ccmcache that is set up,\n\n622\n00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:17.560\nit's set at five gigs by default,\nbut we can modify that.\n\n623\n00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:22.440\nWe an also change the location that will\nallow us to cache the software packages so\n\n624\n00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.780\nwe can self heal.\n\n625\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.791\nAnd so all the systems do that.\n\n626\n00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:25.320\n>> Mm-hm, nice.\n\n627\n00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.890\n>> And that's gonna be available to us.\n\n628\n00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.780\nWe can go in and obviously modify that.\n\n629\n00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.950\nThose are gonna be locked out unless we\nhave administrative rights to the client.\n\n630\n00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:34.035\nI'm able to go in and click through,\n\n631\n00:30:34.035 --> 00:30:35.880\nI think cuz I'm using\nan administrative account.\n\n632\n00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.370\nBut a normal user does not\nhave rights to modify that,\n\n633\n00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.360\nunless they have admin privileges.\n\n634\n00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.180\nSo they'll see it, but they won't be able\nto get in and play around with anything.\n\n635\n00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.360\nThey also will not be able to get in and\nlaunch policy retrieval cycles and\n\n636\n00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:45.860\nstuff like that.\n\n637\n00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.060\nThat will all be locked out.\n\n638\n00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.550\nSo they won't be able to\nmake any changes in there.\n\n639\n00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:53.410\nWe can see any configuration baselines\nthat may have been provided.\n\n640\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.530\nWe haven't done baseline configuration\nmanagement, but if we do have baselines,\n\n641\n00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.610\nwe'll see them there.\n\n642\n00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.220\nSo we would see those.\n\n643\n00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.250\nAnd then on the network we can go in and\n\n644\n00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.030\nset up our proxy settings, if we have\na need to set up a proxy to be able to\n\n645\n00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.970\ncommunicate through the Internet for\nsome reason.\n\n646\n00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:14.000\nSo let's go back here to Actions, let's go\nahead and let's kick off a hardware cycle.\n\n647\n00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.990\nWe've probably had enough time there for\nus to do that.\n\n648\n00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.734\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click OK and\n\n649\n00:31:18.734 --> 00:31:21.578\nthat's gonna kick off a hardware\ninventory cycle on the box.\n\n650\n00:31:21.578 --> 00:31:23.423\nSo that's what the client\nagent looks like, and\n\n651\n00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:26.040\nthat's the things we've been\ntalking about and kinda doing.\n\n652\n00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.140\nNow we've done all that, it's gonna take\na few minutes to do the inventory and\n\n653\n00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:29.800\ngather that up.\n\n654\n00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.152\nSo in the meantime let's go ahead,\nand let's actually,\n\n655\n00:31:32.152 --> 00:31:33.788\nwait let's do one more thing by the way.\n\n656\n00:31:38.728 --> 00:31:42.480\nLet's also do a software inventory cycle.\n\n657\n00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.430\nSo that way we got some stuff to look at.\n\n658\n00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.660\n>> Right.\n>> So let's go back into our\n\n659\n00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.761\nConfiguration Manager console,\n\n660\n00:31:52.761 --> 00:31:58.427\nlet us go over here,\nTo assets and compliance.\n\n661\n00:31:58.427 --> 00:32:00.640\nLet's look at our machine.\n\n662\n00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.970\nSo we're in, and\nI'll show you where we are right now so\n\n663\n00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:06.360\nyou can see, we are in the assets and\ncompliance workspace.\n\n664\n00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.255\nWe're in the devices area, so\nwe've clicked on under overview devices.\n\n665\n00:32:10.255 --> 00:32:14.589\nOf to the right you'll see that\nwe have our machines listed, and\n\n666\n00:32:14.589 --> 00:32:18.857\nthe one at the bottom there,\nPLABSYS01, is set to a client.\n\n667\n00:32:18.857 --> 00:32:20.413\nIt has a Site Code, it's set to Active.\n\n668\n00:32:20.413 --> 00:32:22.830\nThat's the system center machine itself.\n\n669\n00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:27.490\nI'm using my own machine, my\nconfiguration manager system as a client.\n\n670\n00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.280\nI'm monitoring myself in other words.\n\n671\n00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.160\nSo we can do the demo,\n\n672\n00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.290\nI've installed the agent on myself and\nthat's what I was just demoing with.\n\n673\n00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.609\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna highlight that machine.\n\n674\n00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:44.330\nI'm gonna right click, and we're going to\nbe able to, let's just take a look here.\n\n675\n00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.250\nAnd just, there we go, all right.\n\n676\n00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.750\nThere we go, that's what we want.\n\n677\n00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.890\nAnd then we're gonna be able to come\nin and we're gonna be able to go\n\n678\n00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.950\nover here and we're gonna be able to start\nwhat's known as the Resource Explorer.\n\n679\n00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.430\nResource Explorer is\nlike Windows Explorer,\n\n680\n00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.530\nexcept it's gonna show us not just files,\nbut it's going to show us all\n\n681\n00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.060\nthe information we gathered through\nsoftware and hardware inventory.\n\n682\n00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.664\nSo it's actually going to be kind of cool.\n\n683\n00:33:05.664 --> 00:33:07.627\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n684\n00:33:07.627 --> 00:33:10.946\nAnd then we're gonna be able to,\nif the inventory is actually completed,\n\n685\n00:33:10.946 --> 00:33:13.540\nwe're gonna be able to see\nthe software that's running.\n\n686\n00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.430\nWe're gonna be able to\nget a list of the files.\n\n687\n00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.640\nWe're also gonna be able to, and\nsoftware inventory tends to take a little\n\n688\n00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.750\nlonger than hardware inventory does,\nso that many not be done yet.\n\n689\n00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.670\nBut the hardware inventory if it has\nfinished, will then show us the hardware\n\n690\n00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.380\nconfiguration on the system,\nwhich will actually be kinda cool.\n\n691\n00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:31.140\nSo let's go into Resource Explorer,\nwe'll open that up, and we'll go ahead and\n\n692\n00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.210\nwe'll just explode this out, and\nwe'll see that we do indeed, looks like,\n\n693\n00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:35.470\nhave some hardware data there.\n\n694\n00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.330\nJust gonna move this over\nbefore I show this to you.\n\n695\n00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:43.240\nAnd so, what you'll see is we have a\nlisting of all the hardware, and I'm gonna\n\n696\n00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.731\nclick on one or two of the settings to\nshow you, but look at all the stuff.\n\n697\n00:33:47.731 --> 00:33:49.157\nYour CDROM, right?\n\n698\n00:33:49.157 --> 00:33:51.038\nWe've got the Disk Drive, the Disk Quota.\n\n699\n00:33:51.038 --> 00:33:52.073\nRemember, we added that?\n\n700\n00:33:52.073 --> 00:33:54.830\nFolder redirection right there,\nwe've got that one.\n\n701\n00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.830\nWe've got NAP client, network adapter.\n\n702\n00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.460\nWe've got operating system.\n\n703\n00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.830\nWe've got a whole bunch\nof stuff down there.\n\n704\n00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.950\nSo let's just open some of this up and\nactually see what we got.\n\n705\n00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:09.760\nLet's go in and let's take a look at,\n\n706\n00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.240\nwe have a generic PNP,\nplug and play monitor.\n\n707\n00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.980\nWe have a generic CDROM device,\nbecause it's going to be,\n\n708\n00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.780\nwe'll give away the secret here\nof our hosting environment.\n\n709\n00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.330\nYou can see that we are using NEC VMWare,\nVMWare IDE.\n\n710\n00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.300\nWhat that tells us is that we're\nusing VMware on the back end to host,\n\n711\n00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:31.139\nwhich is roughly and just crazily ironic\nconsidering we're doing a Microsoft class.\n\n712\n00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:32.319\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you know what?\n\n713\n00:34:32.319 --> 00:34:34.735\nWe didn't build the lab platform,\nso it's not our call.\n\n714\n00:34:34.735 --> 00:34:38.102\nBut you can actually tell that we are\nusing VMware on the hosting platform on\n\n715\n00:34:38.102 --> 00:34:38.750\nthe back end.\n\n716\n00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:42.890\nSo let the cat out of the proverbial bag,\nas they say.\n\n717\n00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:48.130\nWe can see, as you can see here, physical\ndrives, so we can see what they are.\n\n718\n00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:52.780\nYou see VMware, Virtual disk\nSCSI Device Disk, so we can see those.\n\n719\n00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.880\nSo we can see that we\nhave that information.\n\n720\n00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.610\nWe can go in, take a look at memory,\nand see how much memory we\n\n721\n00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:04.760\nactually are using, can see the\nmotherboard, see what's going on there.\n\n722\n00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.460\nWe can see all sorts of stuff, right?\n\n723\n00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.010\nWe can see disk quotas,\nwe could drill down and see everything.\n\n724\n00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.310\nSo this is all the hardware.\n\n725\n00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.050\nThis is a direct result of\ndoing the hardware inventory.\n\n726\n00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:19.071\nNow if we did do software,\nlet me see, we don't have any, so\n\n727\n00:35:19.071 --> 00:35:23.910\nit did not do any file collections,\nit yet has not run yet.\n\n728\n00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:24.873\nYeah, has not run yet.\n\n729\n00:35:24.873 --> 00:35:28.060\nI'm just looking to get the data, and\nwe can see there's nothing there yet.\n\n730\n00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.760\nSoftware inventory tends to take\nlonger than hardware inventory does,\n\n731\n00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.420\ntends to take about 30 minutes to\nan hour the first time we kick it off.\n\n732\n00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.410\nSo it's probably not going to show\nup while we're doing the demo, but\n\n733\n00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:38.700\nit will be there eventually\nif we let it run long enough.\n\n734\n00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.240\nBut then ice thing is that, yeah,\nwe did get the hardware at least and so\n\n735\n00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:42.760\nthat's good.\n\n736\n00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.992\nAnd so we can tell that we've done at\nleast one pass on the hardware inventory\n\n737\n00:35:45.992 --> 00:35:47.369\nsince we installed the client.\n\n738\n00:35:47.369 --> 00:35:47.904\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which is nice.\n\n739\n00:35:47.904 --> 00:35:49.599\n>> And see those custom classes we added.\n\n740\n00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:53.100\n>> And we can see the custom classes that\nwere there as well that we added in, so\n\n741\n00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.380\nwe can do that using\nour resource explorer.\n\n742\n00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.110\nWhich is also gonna be very nice and\npretty cool for\n\n743\n00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:01.210\nus to be able to go in And\nplay around with as well, right?\n\n744\n00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:04.340\n>> Is that like other consoles,\nprobably not dynamic if I open that up.\n\n745\n00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.870\nSoftware hadn't run yet.\n\n746\n00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:06.770\n>> Not dynamic right, yeah.\n\n747\n00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.440\n>> So I'm gonna have to lose it and\nopen it up again.\n\n748\n00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.230\n>> Open it up again, and\nthe hardware is static in\n\n749\n00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.485\nthe sense that that's the captured state\nat the time that we did the inventory.\n\n750\n00:36:14.485 --> 00:36:17.245\nIt's reading off of\nthe inventory configuration\n\n751\n00:36:17.245 --> 00:36:19.245\nfiles that are stored in\nthe site system database.\n\n752\n00:36:19.245 --> 00:36:20.445\n>> Okay.\n>> So it's not dynamic.\n\n753\n00:36:20.445 --> 00:36:21.435\nIt's not reading in real time.\n\n754\n00:36:21.435 --> 00:36:24.355\n>> If I change hardware or something,\nI'm gonna have to re run that inventory.\n\n755\n00:36:24.355 --> 00:36:24.905\n>> Yeah in theory.\n\n756\n00:36:24.905 --> 00:36:28.300\nLet's say hypothetically you went into\nthat box, pulled out the, let's say\n\n757\n00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.060\nthe network card and put a new one in,\nor add another hard drive or something.\n\n758\n00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.280\nThat would not be recorded in that\ninventory unless we did an updated scan.\n\n759\n00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.110\nSo we may not see that, so\nit's somewhat, I mean for\n\n760\n00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:41.535\nthe most part we'd say it's 99%\naccurate in the sense that it's very\n\n761\n00:36:41.535 --> 00:36:45.195\nunlikely somebody switches out\nhardware you know within that cycle.\n\n762\n00:36:45.195 --> 00:36:46.855\nBut if somebody did and\nwe hadn't run an update,\n\n763\n00:36:46.855 --> 00:36:50.405\nwe would not capture that using that\nresource explorer, we wouldn't know that.\n\n764\n00:36:50.405 --> 00:36:52.175\nSo just wanna be aware of that as well.\n\n765\n00:36:52.175 --> 00:36:55.885\nNow when we are doing inventory\ncollection, something may go wrong, right?\n\n766\n00:36:55.885 --> 00:36:58.865\nAnd we may have to think about what\nthe issues and concerns may be.\n\n767\n00:36:58.865 --> 00:37:01.195\nSo we do have some log files\nthat we wanna take a look at and\n\n768\n00:37:01.195 --> 00:37:03.005\nwe put a list up on Mike's machine.\n\n769\n00:37:03.005 --> 00:37:06.100\nWe wanna go ahead, take a look at Mike's\nmachine here and bring that list up.\n\n770\n00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.350\nSo I'm gonna do that for you.\n\n771\n00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:11.230\nInventory collection troubleshooting\nlogs and things that we can look at.\n\n772\n00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.070\nIf we have to review the client log files,\nwe'll take a look and\n\n773\n00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.690\nsee that we have a list of them off\nto the right that may be valuable.\n\n774\n00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:21.343\nSo on the client, we will look at\nIinventoryAgent.log, CcmExec.log,\n\n775\n00:37:21.343 --> 00:37:27.710\nPolicyagent.log, FileSystemFile.log,\nMf or excuse me Mifprovider.log.\n\n776\n00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:34.550\nOn the site server logs,\nwe look at Dataldr.log, Sinvproc.log.\n\n777\n00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.870\nOn the management point solution,\n\n778\n00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.720\nwe look at MP_,\nthose are all the management point logs.\n\n779\n00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.560\nHinv for hardware inventory,\nSinv is software inventory.\n\n780\n00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.610\nRelay and Retry, and then in the other\ncomponents, we look at status message\n\n781\n00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.460\nqueries to make sure that we\nunderstood what was happening.\n\n782\n00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.980\nExcuse me, what was happening\nthere if we had any problems.\n\n783\n00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.670\nNow software and hardware inventory is\nonly two thirds of the overall picture,\n\n784\n00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.650\nbecause the other thing we can look at\nis what's called software metering.\n\n785\n00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:04.140\nAnd software metering is gonna\nallow us to be able to go in and\n\n786\n00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.080\ntake a look at software usage.\n\n787\n00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.950\nNot software files that are actually\ngoing to be on the system, but rather\n\n788\n00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:15.560\nsoftware usage or usage of the executable\nfiles that are being run on one or\n\n789\n00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.180\nmore end points that we're monitoring.\n\n790\n00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.310\nNow this is another one of the client\nagent settings, we had a setting for\n\n791\n00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:22.230\nsoftware metering to enable it.\n\n792\n00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.660\nI told you that although we monitor and\ndo a refresh every 7 days,\n\n793\n00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.260\nwe have to get 30 days worth\nof data to run the reports.\n\n794\n00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.540\nSo that's just something to consider,\n\n795\n00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.550\nbut what we did was put\ntogether a little picture for\n\n796\n00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.970\nyou that helps us to understand how\nsoftware metering actually works.\n\n797\n00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.220\nSo let's just quickly take a look,\n\n798\n00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.470\ncuz I just want to make sure\nyou understand this as well.\n\n799\n00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.990\nMike was kind enough to do a little\nnumbering for us to help us keep\n\n800\n00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.790\ntrack of things and made the steps\ndown below there match the numbers, so\n\n801\n00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.940\nthat way we can kinda keep\ntrack of what's happening.\n\n802\n00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.350\nSo you'll see in Step 1, and as we always\ndo, let's just break down the diagram,\n\n803\n00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.900\nmake sure everybody knows\nwhat we're looking at.\n\n804\n00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.080\nOn the left hand side, we have an\nendpoint, a client that's being managed.\n\n805\n00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.540\nWe have some monitor programs,\n\n806\n00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.260\nthis little rectangular boxes with\nthe arrows coming out of them.\n\n807\n00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.240\nRepresent Monitored Programs\nas he's labeled up above.\n\n808\n00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:08.360\nAnd so those are things like Microsoft\nWord or Notepad or Pinball or whatever.\n\n809\n00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.357\nI do miss Pinball by the way.\n\n810\n00:39:09.357 --> 00:39:09.902\n>> [LAUGH] That was a good one.\n\n811\n00:39:09.902 --> 00:39:10.599\n>> That was an awesome game.\n\n812\n00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:13.450\nPinball or something like\nthat that we may be running.\n\n813\n00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.220\nSo those of you that are into\nslacking off at work and\n\n814\n00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.870\nrunning programs you're not supposed to,\nbe forewarned and beware we can tell what\n\n815\n00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.830\nyou're doing cuz with software metering we\ncan look at all the executables that run.\n\n816\n00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.315\nSo big brother is watching you.\n\n817\n00:39:25.315 --> 00:39:26.898\n>> Amen.\n>> And we've known that for some time but\n\n818\n00:39:26.898 --> 00:39:28.080\nnow we can actually prove it.\n\n819\n00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.730\nSo we have monitor programs.\n\n820\n00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:30.960\nSo those are gonna run.\n\n821\n00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.870\nThen the software metering\nagent is running and\n\n822\n00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.190\ncapturing ever time an executable is used.\n\n823\n00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:38.753\nWhen that executable is fired off,\nwe make a note in our little notepad and\n\n824\n00:39:38.753 --> 00:39:42.087\nthen we actually upload that data\ninto the management point when we do\n\n825\n00:39:42.087 --> 00:39:43.360\na policy refresh.\n\n826\n00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.640\nOr rather a policy cycle, so every seven\ndays for software metering we take all\n\n827\n00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:52.110\nthat data of the client, upload it into\nthe site server and the management point.\n\n828\n00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.900\nThat then ultimately forwards\nthe data from the manage\n\n829\n00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.500\npoint over to the site server, over to\nthe site server database in step 4.\n\n830\n00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:04.270\nRecords that, and then we can use\nrecording to go in and to actually then\n\n831\n00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:07.540\ntake a look at that, or at least in\ntheory if we have reporting set up.\n\n832\n00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.600\nWe can certainly go in and\nwe can take a look at that.\n\n833\n00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.990\nAnd so the idea is that we can go in and\nwe actually then use one or more reports.\n\n834\n00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.530\nAnd there's over 400\nreports we can access.\n\n835\n00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.730\nThere's a whole bunch, not specific\njust to software metering and usage, but\n\n836\n00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.330\nthere's a bunch specific to that,\nwe can access those reports and\n\n837\n00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.740\nwe're gonna set up software,\nexcuse me, not software, metering.\n\n838\n00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.050\nWe're gonna set up reporting\nin an upcoming episode and\n\n839\n00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.120\nwe'll show you how to do that.\n\n840\n00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.300\nAnd once those reports are in, you can\nsee all the categories of reports and\n\n841\n00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.040\nsee what they are.\n\n842\n00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.260\nWe would then be able to pull a report or\nseveral that show us what kind of\n\n843\n00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.590\nexecutables are running,\nhow often, on what machines.\n\n844\n00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:45.640\nIt's also good for licensing true up and\nlicensing evaluation.\n\n845\n00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.070\nbecause one of the things we\ncan do is debunk that myth\n\n846\n00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.330\nthat we often hear about where people say,\noh I need this software or that software.\n\n847\n00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.320\nA lot of people will say, no,\nI have to have a copy of Access or\n\n848\n00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.660\nI have to have a copy of Project or Visio.\n\n849\n00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.730\nI love having these conversations with\ncustomers, because at $250.00 a copy\n\n850\n00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.060\nyou can have as many as you want\nas long as you write a check.\n\n851\n00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.350\nBut the reality is that most people\nthat request that software never use it,\n\n852\n00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.380\nit's the monkey see, monkey do phenomenon.\n\n853\n00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.925\nI'm being kind when I say that by the way.\n\n854\n00:41:11.925 --> 00:41:15.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I mean that in the most\n\n855\n00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.370\nkind way I possibly can,\nnot that you're a monkey but\n\n856\n00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.460\nthat you're parroting people around you.\n\n857\n00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.532\nBut the idea is that a lot of\npeople will say, well so so and so\n\n858\n00:41:22.532 --> 00:41:24.262\nhas that software so I want it to.\n\n859\n00:41:24.262 --> 00:41:27.047\nWell you may want it, but\nthe reality is, are you really using it?\n\n860\n00:41:27.047 --> 00:41:30.749\nAn you know, up until recently, it's been\nhard for us to equivocally say, well yeah,\n\n861\n00:41:30.749 --> 00:41:32.130\nyou're using it a lot.\n\n862\n00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:35.160\nBut now that we do software metering\nwe could look at executable launch,\n\n863\n00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.410\nwe actually can say, wow, you really are\nusing that software, like ten times a day.\n\n864\n00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.710\nNow you may be smart enough to realize\nall you have to do is go in there and\n\n865\n00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.785\nclick, open it up.\n\n866\n00:41:42.785 --> 00:41:44.770\n[LAUGH] And then we say,\noh yeah, you used it and\n\n867\n00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:47.180\njustify that even though you never use it.\n\n868\n00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.550\nBut the report will show that you launched\nthe product a certain number of times.\n\n869\n00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:54.270\nSo we don't actually look at usage from\na time perspective, just to be clear,\n\n870\n00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.900\nwe're simply looking at it and reporting\non it based on executable launches.\n\n871\n00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.700\nSo but we can tell if somebody's actually\nusing that software and if so how often.\n\n872\n00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.360\nSo that is just something\nelse to be aware of.\n\n873\n00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.960\n>> All right.\nAgain, as usual,\n\n874\n00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.770\nanother fantastic episode, Adam.\n\n875\n00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:12.370\nA great look at doing our hardware and our\nsoftware inventories, and a little bit of\n\n876\n00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.640\nsoftware metering there, talked about\nreporting, a lot of great stuff.\n\n877\n00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.530\nHope you guys enjoyed that one.\n\n878\n00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.010\nRemember, if you wanna attend\none of

00:00:17.241\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:20.990\nToday we are doing our SCCM 2012R2.\n\n5\n00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.290\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna focus on queries and reports, right?\n\n6\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.523\nWe've talked a little bit about\nthose in previous episodes,\n\n7\n00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:32.580\nnow we're gonna delve into the world of\nWMI queries and all of that fun stuff.\n\n8\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.820\nSo we're gonna start learning another\nlanguage in this episode, how about that?\n\n9\n00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.997\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon, how are you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.728\n>> [FOREIGN]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:45.388\n>> [FOREIGN] Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:49.030\n>> [LAUGH] Wait let me say that again,\n[FOREIGN], okay, good.\n\n13\n00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.900\n>> Did I get that right?\n\n14\n00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.480\n>> I think so.\n\n15\n00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.460\n>> I have to represent\nsome from South Florida.\n\n16\n00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.260\nIf I didn't get that right,\nI couldn't go back home.\n\n17\n00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we are going to learn how to speak\n\n18\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.130\nanother language,\nI actually like how Mike put that.\n\n19\n00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.860\nThat is a great way to start thinking\nabout reporting and more importantly,\n\n20\n00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.435\nabout querying.\n\n21\n00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:10.300\nCuz the two are related, but querying is\nreally the idea and ultimately the art and\n\n22\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.480\nscience of being able to use,\nin this case,\n\n23\n00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.195\nWQL, the WMI query language\nto be able to ask questions.\n\n24\n00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:21.530\nAnd queries on the surface actually\nsound fairly straightforward.\n\n25\n00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.720\nWhat time is it, right?\n\n26\n00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.530\nWhat status is the system?\n\n27\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.760\nIs the system on?\n\n28\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.730\nIs the system off?\n\n29\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.270\nDoes Mike know what the intro is?\n\n30\n00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.870\nDoes he not know what the intro is?\n\n31\n00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.240\nWe can ask these questions, we can query.\n\n32\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.010\nIn many cases, the answer is yes.\n\n33\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.520\nIn some cases, as in with the intro,\nthe answer may be no for Mike.\n\n34\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.135\nSo the reality is when we ask a query,\nwe are effectively asking or\n\n35\n00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:45.510\nwhen we pose a query, we create one and\nwe use it, we are posing a question.\n\n36\n00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.860\nAnd when we think about queries from the\nperspective of, if I ask a question and\n\n37\n00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.580\nI understand how to frame\nthe question in such a way\n\n38\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.020\nthat the answer has to either be yes,\nno, true, false, on, off.\n\n39\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.020\nKind of those kinds of queries,\nthose kinds of questions.\n\n40\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.730\nThat or what we would call black and\nwhite, right?\n\n41\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.310\nThere's no room for gray.\n\n42\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.430\nThere's either an established answer\nthat is of one or another type.\n\n43\n00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.330\nWe can begin to think about how to use\nqueries in such a way that we can use them\n\n44\n00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.760\nto accomplish several things.\n\n45\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.860\nWe can check status, we can understand the\ncurrent state, what the desired state is.\n\n46\n00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.510\nWhat the potential difference between the\ndesired state and the current state is.\n\n47\n00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.510\nAnd we also can look at what is actively\ngoing on and measure those values.\n\n48\n00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.360\nAnd understand whether they\nrepresent what we expect or\n\n49\n00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.910\nwhat we would hopefully not wanna see but\nmay have occurring.\n\n50\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.880\nSo we could be above or below a threshold,\nwe could ask queries about that.\n\n51\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.640\nWe can be of a certain type or\nbe doing a certain thing, so\n\n52\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.270\na system can be managed and\nmaybe unmanaged.\n\n53\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.210\nA system may have an agent in\na current state or similar state, but\n\n54\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.800\nnot one that we're looking for.\n\n55\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.559\nSo queries can do all sorts of things for\nus and\n\n56\n00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.840\nwe think about the logic of queries.\n\n57\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.520\nWhat we have to really think about\nis how do I wanna frame the question\n\n58\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.340\nin such a way that the answer\nthat comes back makes sense for\n\n59\n00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.460\nwhat I'm looking to accomplish.\n\n60\n00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.520\nThere's more than one way to\nask a question, for instance,\n\n61\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.320\nI can ask an open-ended question.\n\n62\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.560\nGood morning, how are you?\n\n63\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.200\nThere could be a lot of ways you\nmay choose to answer that question.\n\n64\n00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.560\nYou may say, oh good morning, I'm good.\n\n65\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.090\nYou may say,\n\n66\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.420\ngood morning and then I may get 20\nminutes of what's going on in your life.\n\n67\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.131\nI've stopped paying attention by the way\nright after good morning, typically.\n\n68\n00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:28.911\nSo you're talking, but I'm not\nreally capturing anything of value.\n\n69\n00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:33.160\nNot because I don't want to, but because\nit's just boring and I really don't care.\n\n70\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.110\nSo, the reality of the question\nbeing open-ended is\n\n71\n00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.420\nI'm probably gonna get back a lot more\ninformation than either I want, I need or\n\n72\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.840\nI can process and realistically use.\n\n73\n00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.810\nSo if I ask open-ended questions,\n\n74\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.040\nprobably not gonna get a lot of stuff\nthat's valuable and easily consumable.\n\n75\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.640\nBut if I ask targeted,\nspecific questions geared towards or\n\n76\n00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.060\nfocused on a very well-defined and\nquantifiable.\n\n77\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.710\nThis is an important thought\nprocess with queries.\n\n78\n00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.390\nQuantification or quantifiability,\nI'm making up words as I go here.\n\n79\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.860\nQuantification is the idea, the art,\nthe science in measuring something, right?\n\n80\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.610\nAnd if we ask a query and we focus it\nin such a way that it is measurable.\n\n81\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.180\nIt has the ability, the query,\nto produce an outcome that we can measure,\n\n82\n00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.260\nthat we can understand,\nthat we can create value with.\n\n83\n00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.550\nThen that query is gonna produce something\nthat's gonna be very important for us.\n\n84\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.490\nSo instead of saying or asking you,\ngood morning, how are you?\n\n85\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.640\nI may say on a scale of one to five,\nhow happy are you this morning?\n\n86\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.880\nOne being, I need Prozac, five being I\ncouldn't be happier if I tried, right?\n\n87\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.708\nAnd then somewhere on that scale, I need\nyou to quantify, I need you to assess and\n\n88\n00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:47.270\nmeasure your state of happiness, right?\n\n89\n00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.772\nGiven the smile on Mike's face,\n\n90\n00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:52.270\nI'm thinking he doesn't need any sort\nof medication this morning, right?\n\n91\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.040\n>> Or I've already had it.\n\n92\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.020\n>> Or he may have already taken it,\nin which case it's now kicking in and\n\n93\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.550\nhe's gonna have that smile for\nsome time to come.\n\n94\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.170\nEither way, the point is Mike looks\nlike he's on the upside of that scale.\n\n95\n00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.520\nHe looks like he's somewhere\nbetween four and five and\n\n96\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.060\nnot on the low end of that scale.\n\n97\n00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.050\nDown in the dumps so to speak or\nthe doldrums, down towards the ones and\n\n98\n00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.010\ntwos, right?\n\n99\n00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.690\nAnd so we can create a closed-ended\nquestion, kind of a focused question,\n\n100\n00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.660\na focused query, by planning.\n\n101\n00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.001\nAnd we keep coming back to that\nidea of planning over and over and\n\n102\n00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:20.820\nover again in our conversations.\n\n103\n00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.200\nThe art and\nscience of querying is really the art and\n\n104\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.990\nscience of figuring out what\nit is you want to know.\n\n105\n00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.810\nAnd then figuring out\nthe best way to ask the query\n\n106\n00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.740\nto achieve that end result with\nthe least amount of work possible, but\n\n107\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.150\nthe maximum opportunity\nto get that information.\n\n108\n00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.830\nAnd it sounds hard on the surface when\nwe talk about it in the abstract.\n\n109\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.410\nWhich is why we're actually just gonna\nditch the rest of this episode and\n\n110\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.030\nnot do anything else.\n\n111\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.315\nCuz it's impossible to do and\nI don't know what else to tell you.\n\n112\n00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:50.155\nWe're gonna scratch this one and\nmove on to something more exciting.\n\n113\n00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:53.535\nI'm only kidding, if you're listening,\ndon't go away, we are not gonna do that,\n\n114\n00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:54.525\nI'm only kidding.\n\n115\n00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:55.975\nMy point with this is that,\n\n116\n00:05:55.975 --> 00:05:59.309\nit sounds hard on the surface because\nwhen we talk about queries, right?\n\n117\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.310\nWe're talking in the abstract\nuntil we actually do it.\n\n118\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.043\nAnd when we do the queries,\nyou're gonna see and\n\n119\n00:06:05.043 --> 00:06:07.680\nwe are gonna show you how to write them,\nwe're gonna take them apart.\n\n120\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.809\nExplain to you how they work,\nput them back together again,\n\n121\n00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.920\nmake sure you're comfortable\nwith how to create queries.\n\n122\n00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.078\nWhen you see it done, you begin to\nsee that although there is definitely\n\n123\n00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:20.789\ninvestment of time and energy you need to\nput in to understand, not only WQL, but\n\n124\n00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.650\nthe object class model\nthat Windows is built on.\n\n125\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.730\nWe're gonna debunk that for\nyou a little bit here.\n\n126\n00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.950\nMike put together a nice little graphic\nfor us, we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n127\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.123\nAnd we've got a little website URL we're\ngonna show you in a minute that'll give\n\n128\n00:06:32.123 --> 00:06:34.780\nyou some background on WQL,\nlet you read up on it a little bit.\n\n129\n00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.820\nHelp you to better\nunderstand the language.\n\n130\n00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.340\nBut assuming you put the time and\neffort in to be able to do those things,\n\n131\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.530\nthe only way to get good at\nquerying really is by practicing.\n\n132\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.860\nAnd it's one of those\nunfortunate realities, but\n\n133\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.880\nit's much like PowerShell or any other\nlanguage that we've talked about or\n\n134\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.620\nwe do talk about and you have to learn.\n\n135\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.160\nThe more you do it,\nthe more fluent you become.\n\n136\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.770\nAnd so writing queries is really\nabout practicing to get good at it.\n\n137\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.620\nWhat most people actually\ndo is they will go out and\n\n138\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.080\nfind queries that have\nalready been written.\n\n139\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.270\nBecause a lot of these\nare available out on the web.\n\n140\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.620\nYou can query, literally for a query.\n\n141\n00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.430\nSo in other words,\nyou go out to Google and\n\n142\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.090\nit is kind of ironic that you\nwould Google for queries.\n\n143\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.321\nWe should say Google for Google, but\nthat would not make sense, right?\n\n144\n00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:18.563\nSo we would go out and Google for queries,\nand you actually can go out and go and\n\n145\n00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:21.251\ntype in something like query for\nSCCM 2012.\n\n146\n00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:25.012\nWe always wanna put the SCCM reference on\nthe end of our Google statements as I've\n\n147\n00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:28.680\ntalked about to make sure we get accurate\ninformation related to the product.\n\n148\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.020\nIf we go out and\nwe do something like that,\n\n149\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.690\nwe're gonna find that there are a bunch\nof queries that people have written.\n\n150\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.500\nA lot of them are out there and\npublished, and\n\n151\n00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.180\nyou can start taking them and manipulating\nthem to your specific environment.\n\n152\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.360\nChange the variables out and\nfigure out exactly what you wanna use or\n\n153\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.230\nwhat you need.\n\n154\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.830\nBut that's gonna be a great\nway to get started.\n\n155\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.920\nBecause somebody's already gone out and\nfigured out hey, if I want this,\n\n156\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.400\nI gotta do these things.\n\n157\n00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.230\nAnd if you take that and\nthen apply it to your environment.\n\n158\n00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.449\nYou'll get the benefit of the query,\n\n159\n00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:56.254\nbut you'll also not have to\nfigure it out from scratch.\n\n160\n00:07:56.254 --> 00:07:59.796\nThere is some value in borrowing\nas we have talked about before.\n\n161\n00:07:59.796 --> 00:08:03.346\nAnd as long as you're willing\nto do that and invest the time,\n\n162\n00:08:03.346 --> 00:08:06.211\nTo make sure,\nnumber one the syntax is correct.\n\n163\n00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:09.658\nNumber two, that you test it out, as we\nwould always want you to do, and always\n\n164\n00:08:09.658 --> 00:08:13.500\ntell you to do, with anything you download\nfrom the web, even from Microsoft.\n\n165\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.330\nAnd I've talked a lot about the fact you\nshould always go back to the direct source\n\n166\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.210\nas possible.\n\n167\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:22.230\nTry to get those queries, try to get any\nof the language statements we talked\n\n168\n00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.180\nabout, like the PowerShell commands,\nthings like that.\n\n169\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.342\nYou'll get them from Microsoft websites,\n\n170\n00:08:26.342 --> 00:08:29.280\nthey are much more likely to\nbe not only accurate, but\n\n171\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.518\nalso to make sure that they're not\ngonna do any harm to your system.\n\n172\n00:08:31.518 --> 00:08:33.520\nBut even then,\nyou still have to test them, right?\n\n173\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.980\nYou still have to make sure that whatever\nwas posted there was posted accurately,\n\n174\n00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.630\nand that somebody didn't make a mistake\nwhen they were transcribing it,\n\n175\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.280\nputting it in, and\n\n176\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.580\nthere may be a bad command in there\nsomewhere that you're just not aware of.\n\n177\n00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.950\nSo don't just blindly trust that stuff,\nis what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n178\n00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.770\nTake it, put it in a demo environment,\nand test it out.\n\n179\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.230\nAnd it's really important.\n\n180\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.570\nWe haven't really talked about this too\nmuch in any of our episodes to date.\n\n181\n00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.935\nIt's probably a good place to\nthrow this idea out for you here.\n\n182\n00:08:56.935 --> 00:08:59.365\nIt's really important\nto set up a test bed so\n\n183\n00:08:59.365 --> 00:09:03.535\nthat to use this product, you could scale\nit and figure out what you wanna do next.\n\n184\n00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:05.615\nIt's very hard to do this in production,\nright?\n\n185\n00:09:05.615 --> 00:09:07.595\nSo you know,\nI mean you could do it in production, but\n\n186\n00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:10.885\nthe reality is, you try to do this\nin production, and you get it wrong,\n\n187\n00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:12.385\nyou're gonna have a lot of clean up work.\n\n188\n00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.905\nAnd that's probably not\na very good idea for anybody.\n\n189\n00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:18.075\nWhat makes a lot more sense is to\nvirtualize an instance of this\n\n190\n00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:19.250\ninfrastructure.\n\n191\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.870\nRun it isolated, use some sample data,\nbring in some packages,\n\n192\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.540\nbring over some stuff that you can export\nout from the production environment and\n\n193\n00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.462\nthen reproduce, and\nthen use that as a test bed.\n\n194\n00:09:31.462 --> 00:09:35.045\nSnapshot it, make it available so that you\ncan iterate through it if you need to,\n\n195\n00:09:35.045 --> 00:09:38.330\nand/or use templates to\ndeploy the machines so\n\n196\n00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.270\nyou can configure them at a certain point.\n\n197\n00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.600\nHowever you wanna do it.\n\n198\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.590\nBut the reality is,\nyou could take the install media and\n\n199\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.820\ncreate another copy of this system, right?\n\n200\n00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.330\nAnd set it up in a demo environment,\nand use it for\n\n201\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.860\na period of time, to do testing.\n\n202\n00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.710\nYou know, with the advent of virtual\ninfrastructure, today, it's very easy for\n\n203\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.260\nyou to be able to do this kind of stuff,\nand then revert it when you're done.\n\n204\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.840\nSo you should really be thinking\nabout building a test bed, so\n\n205\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.910\nthat way you can experiment,\nyou can test your queries.\n\n206\n00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.980\nYou can do all the stuff you wanna do.\n\n207\n00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.340\nWhen you get them right you can then\nport them over to production, and\n\n208\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.230\nthen you have a finished\nproduct that you can rely on.\n\n209\n00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.940\nSo just some thoughts as we start, or\nthink about getting started with queries,\n\n210\n00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.182\njust to get kind of\nthe stage set if you will.\n\n211\n00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:19.240\nAll right, so let's take a look at the\nquerying with WQL information that Mike\n\n212\n00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.290\nhas up on the screen.\n\n213\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.310\nWhat we're gonna do\nquickly is just zoom in.\n\n214\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.810\nWe're not really gonna do this for effect.\n\n215\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.180\nYou can't read the whole thing.\n\n216\n00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.017\nI just want you to see, just very quickly,\nMike's gonna post the URL,\n\n217\n00:10:28.017 --> 00:10:29.549\nwe'll make the URL available to you.\n\n218\n00:10:29.549 --> 00:10:34.547\nThis is off the Microsoft Developer site,\nand this is gonna give you some general\n\n219\n00:10:34.547 --> 00:10:38.517\ninformation on querying with WQL,\nthe WMI query language, and\n\n220\n00:10:38.517 --> 00:10:41.898\ngive you a general resource\nthat will allow you to go and\n\n221\n00:10:41.898 --> 00:10:46.850\nthen start to understand how to use\nthe language to be able to write queries.\n\n222\n00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.270\nSo we're gonna give you that resource,\n\n223\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.270\nmake sure you can look\nit up if you need to.\n\n224\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.760\nAnd this is just the kind of\nthing that kick starts you,\n\n225\n00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.430\npushes you off in the right direction,\ngives you a general indication\n\n226\n00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.790\nof some of the stuff you're gonna\nhave to start thinking about.\n\n227\n00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.270\nLet's go in and let's take a look at\nthe diagram if we can, specific to that.\n\n228\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.500\nAll right, so, we're gonna wanna\nzoom in just a little bit on that,\n\n229\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.930\nbecause that's gonna allow us to be able\nto see, a little bit, yeah that's good.\n\n230\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.833\nWe can kinda see that from there,\nno problem.\n\n231\n00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:13.620\nSo what we want to do here is just\nreally kind of break down for\n\n232\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.880\nyou the thought process of the object\nmodel, and the attributes and\n\n233\n00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.440\nattribute classes that is underlying\nWindows from an architectural perspective\n\n234\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.740\nand programmatically, which is\nwhat we have to then work with and\n\n235\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.030\nrely on with regards to writing queries.\n\n236\n00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.830\nSo, at the top there, of the pyramid, or\nkinda the resource hierarchy on the right,\n\n237\n00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.350\nwe have a System Resource, right,\nand this is an object type.\n\n238\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.235\nSystem Resource is one of the object\ntypes we'll use when we go in and\n\n239\n00:11:40.235 --> 00:11:43.057\nwe start writing queries in the demo\nenvironment in a little bit.\n\n240\n00:11:43.057 --> 00:11:47.391\nYou're gonna see the default is\ngonna typically be System Resource,\n\n241\n00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:51.282\nwe're gonna use that to drive\nour query as an object type.\n\n242\n00:11:51.282 --> 00:11:52.862\nAnd then under System Resource,\n\n243\n00:11:52.862 --> 00:11:56.232\nwe're gonna be able to access\na bunch of attribute classes.\n\n244\n00:11:56.232 --> 00:12:00.022\nAnd we have Processor on the left,\nwe have Disk Drives on the right.\n\n245\n00:12:00.022 --> 00:12:01.142\nThere are numerous ones,\n\n246\n00:12:01.142 --> 00:12:03.462\nthis is just a sampling of some\nof the ones that would be there.\n\n247\n00:12:03.462 --> 00:12:05.052\nBut under System Resource,\n\n248\n00:12:05.052 --> 00:12:09.242\nthe attribute classes allow us\nto then organize logically,\n\n249\n00:12:09.242 --> 00:12:13.390\nif you think about it, different\nareas of focus underneath the system.\n\n250\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.490\nA system resource is, in theory,\na monitored endpoint.\n\n251\n00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.135\nSo it'd be a\nWindows-operating-system-based machine, or\n\n252\n00:12:20.135 --> 00:12:24.116\na Linux-based, or Unix-based,\nor Macintosh OS-based machine,\n\n253\n00:12:24.116 --> 00:12:26.370\nit doesn't really matter what OS.\n\n254\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.490\nBut since we're talking about the Windows\nobject model, these are all gonna be\n\n255\n00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.140\nWindows resources that we're focused\non from a query perspective.\n\n256\n00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:38.071\nSo in this case, System Resource is gonna\nbe a Windows-driven operating system,\n\n257\n00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:41.510\na Windows 7, a Server 10, whatever it is.\n\n258\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.280\nAnd then under that we're gonna have\nattribute classes, Processor, Disk Drive,\n\n259\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.500\nthere's memory in there, so\nyou would see RAM, you would see the BIOS,\n\n260\n00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:56.480\nyou would see CD ROM, you would see all\nsorts of different attribute classes and\n\n261\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.470\nthe attribute class is a silo.\n\n262\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.420\nThink of it as a area, or a container,\n\n263\n00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.305\nthat is gonna have information inside\nof it based on this class tag.\n\n264\n00:13:09.305 --> 00:13:12.945\nIn this case, we'll stick with Processor\njust for one second, just on the left,\n\n265\n00:13:12.945 --> 00:13:15.555\nto go down and then under,\nthere we go that's good.\n\n266\n00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:19.685\nAnd then under Attribute Class,\nwe have Attributes that are assigned or\n\n267\n00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:21.875\ndefined inside the class.\n\n268\n00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:26.075\nSo under Processor,\nagain we have more than this in the class,\n\n269\n00:13:26.075 --> 00:13:28.625\nwe're just looking at a small\nsample to give you an idea.\n\n270\n00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:30.215\nWe have Current Clock Speed,\n\n271\n00:13:30.215 --> 00:13:34.965\nwe have Manufacturer,\nwe would probably have an attribute about,\n\n272\n00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:39.290\nprobably, hyperthreading, so\nwe would probably have that in there.\n\n273\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.807\nWe would see logical versus\nphysical processor cores, so\n\n274\n00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:45.340\nwe'd be able to see\nthe differentiator there.\n\n275\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.570\nSo we would have a bunch of\nattributes that are defined, and\n\n276\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.410\nevery attribute is then\ngoing to have values.\n\n277\n00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.890\nWe don't show you the values, values\nwill be below attributes on the scales.\n\n278\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.320\nWe have another breakdown.\n\n279\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.670\nThere will be another arrow in effect,\nanother line there.\n\n280\n00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.840\nAnd when we would have multiple values,\n\n281\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.220\nthose values are typically gonna\nbe either alpha or numeric.\n\n282\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.970\nSo under Current Clock Speed,\nit would be something like, I don't know,\n\n283\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.060\n1 gigahertz or whatever it would be.\n\n284\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.230\nAnd then under Manufacturer it would\nbe something like Intel or AMD.\n\n285\n00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.040\nSo, it could be a text string,\ncould be an alpha-numeric input.\n\n286\n00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.230\nThe value fields are gonna have different\nparameters associated with them,\n\n287\n00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.720\nbased on the kinds of\nvalues that they are.\n\n288\n00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.980\nSome of those values may be a radio\nbutton selector, or a checkbox,\n\n289\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.490\nor things of that nature.\n\n290\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.370\nSo there's different values that are\nassigned based on the attribute class, and\n\n291\n00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.730\nthe attributes that are being defined.\n\n292\n00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.460\nThis comes to us generically as\na thought process from programming,\n\n293\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.860\nfrom writing software code.\n\n294\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.790\nAnd it's\nthe Object Property Attribute Value model,\n\n295\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.800\nwhat's called OPAV,\nthat we're really using in\n\n296\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.375\norder to be able to figure out how to\ndefine items that can then be queried.\n\n297\n00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:57.670\nCuz in effect what we're doing is laying\nout a roadmap, a path, if you will,\n\n298\n00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:02.470\nfrom object type to attribute class, to\nattributes, and down ultimately to values,\n\n299\n00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:08.590\nthat we then are able to use and\nto effectively draw, if you will,\n\n300\n00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.780\na roadmap, or create a path that allows\nus to say, I want to start here.\n\n301\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.480\nAnd by defining my choices\ndown this particular path,\n\n302\n00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.200\nI'm gonna be able to ask a question or\na series of questions.\n\n303\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.090\nCuz queries may look for\none specific thing, or\n\n304\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.350\nmay be geared or set up in such a way\nthat they pull in multiple things.\n\n305\n00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.600\nSo we can add multiple object,\n\n306\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.500\nnot multiple object types,\ngenerically we'll use one object type but\n\n307\n00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.820\nhave multiple attributes classes and/or\nattributes in that particular object type.\n\n308\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.060\nAnd then we can link multiple object\ntypes together in a query, and\n\n309\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.600\nquery across multiple areas.\n\n310\n00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.980\nSo, yeah, we can do different things\ndepending on what we're looking to do.\n\n311\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.383\nAnd as a result of that, we can create\nsome fairly complex queries that look at\n\n312\n00:15:48.383 --> 00:15:52.718\nsystem resource but deal with both\nprocessor, disk drive, and a variety of\n\n313\n00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:57.010\nother attribute classes to ask multiple\nquestions within a single query.\n\n314\n00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.337\nSo we're gonna go through and\ntake a look at how to do this live.\n\n315\n00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:01.546\nIn just a moment.\n\n316\n00:16:01.546 --> 00:16:04.569\nWhat we want to do is give you\nthe opportunity to figure out, or\n\n317\n00:16:04.569 --> 00:16:07.767\nat least begin to get acquainted\nwith the idea of the object type,\n\n318\n00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:09.940\nthe attribute class, and the attributes.\n\n319\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.360\nNow, where would you go?\n\n320\n00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.320\nAnd the answer, obviously, is going to be,\nI'm gonna go to Google and figure out.\n\n321\n00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.030\nBut where would you go to get a listing of\nall the object types that are available to\n\n322\n00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.540\nyou inside SCCM?\n\n323\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.720\nWhere would you go to see all the\nattribute classes associated with them,\n\n324\n00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.950\nand all the attributes?\n\n325\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.240\nYou could go into the product and\n\n326\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.570\nstart pulling all this down\nthrough the pull down menus,\n\n327\n00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.710\nand start to define it, but it's gonna\ntake a lot of time for you to do that.\n\n328\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.080\nYou could go out and you could Google,\nand again, if you are asking the right\n\n329\n00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.870\nquestion, you would be able\nto get back some information.\n\n330\n00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.340\nCan we bring the web back up for\njust a second?\n\n331\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.020\nAll right, so if we go to Google, and\nMike's gonna load up Google for us here.\n\n332\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.607\nThis is gonna take\na second to bring that up.\n\n333\n00:16:46.607 --> 00:16:51.534\nAnd we do object, let's do\n\n334\n00:16:51.534 --> 00:16:57.110\nobject type in SCCM 2012.\n\n335\n00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.850\nNow let's see what we get back with that.\n\n336\n00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.215\nI think the first one up there\nis from TechNet, is that right?\n\n337\n00:17:02.215 --> 00:17:04.245\nAttribute, about object types, perfect.\n\n338\n00:17:04.245 --> 00:17:06.263\nAll right, so if we go to that first link,\n\n339\n00:17:06.263 --> 00:17:09.810\nwe're going to see object types from\nthe Microsoft System Center area.\n\n340\n00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:13.520\nAnd you're gonna see that we have\na listing of object types on the left\n\n341\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.040\nthere, right?\n\n342\n00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.840\nAnd you're going to see there is,\nyou know, a table.\n\n343\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.330\nIt probably goes down for a little bit.\n\n344\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:21.420\nAnd you can see that we've\ngot the main object types,\n\n345\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:26.390\nuser group resource, user resource, system\nresource, site program package, etc.\n\n346\n00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.220\nAnd then from there, we can drill in and\n\n347\n00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.550\nstart to see the attribute classes and\nthe attributes as well.\n\n348\n00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.710\nAnd so if you Google and just start do\nthat, and and on the left in the nav bar,\n\n349\n00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.980\nit's probably got all the other\nlinks that I'm talking about.\n\n350\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.240\nYou'll be able to find all\nthe referenceable information, so\n\n351\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.660\nthat if you really wanted to drill in and\nbegin to see what these object types are.\n\n352\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.090\nAnd then ultimately the attribute\nclasses and the attributes.\n\n353\n00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.220\nYou can build up a fairly robust knowledge\n\n354\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.105\nbase here in terms of\nhaving this information.\n\n355\n00:17:56.105 --> 00:17:58.465\nThe trick is that you don't\nneed to know all this stuff.\n\n356\n00:17:58.465 --> 00:18:00.965\nLet's be honest, there's so\nmuch stuff out there,\n\n357\n00:18:00.965 --> 00:18:03.845\nthat unless you're gonna be writing\nqueries on that particular area\n\n358\n00:18:03.845 --> 00:18:06.925\nof the system on a regular basis,\nyou're probably not gonna remember it.\n\n359\n00:18:06.925 --> 00:18:09.440\nYou're gonna go out and look it up\nlike we're doing when we have a need.\n\n360\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.780\nSo you just wanna know where to go,\n\n361\n00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.860\nas opposed to copying this all down,\nputting it into a book,\n\n362\n00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.460\nand keeping it at your ready there\noff to the side by the keyboard.\n\n363\n00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.510\nBecause unless you're writing queries for\na living,\n\n364\n00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.090\nyou're just not gonna remember most of\nthe stuff until you have to use it.\n\n365\n00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.070\nSo just be aware of that and\nthink through the logic of that.\n\n366\n00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.000\nAll right, so what we'd like to do is\nswitch over to my machine if we could.\n\n367\n00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.050\nWe're gonna go ahead, gonna take a look\nat how to build some of these queries for\n\n368\n00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.620\nyou, and actually go in live and play\naround under the hood for a little bit.\n\n369\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.630\nWe're also gonna take a look at how to\nset up the reporting services point.\n\n370\n00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.910\nAnd once we've done queries and we then\nhave the ability to ask questions and\n\n371\n00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.670\nget back something of value, we're then\ngoing to go ahead and put some time and\n\n372\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.370\neffort into setting up the reporting\nservices configuration.\n\n373\n00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.305\nWe've done about half the work already.\n\n374\n00:18:51.305 --> 00:18:53.205\nI'm gonna walk you through\nwhat we did on the back end.\n\n375\n00:18:53.205 --> 00:18:56.583\nWe'll then configure the reporting\nservices point, and we'll take a look at\n\n376\n00:18:56.583 --> 00:18:59.718\nthose 400 odd reports I keep talking\nabout in some of these episodes.\n\n377\n00:18:59.718 --> 00:19:01.285\nI'll actually take a look\nat what they look like.\n\n378\n00:19:01.285 --> 00:19:05.325\nCuz reports are being driven by queries as\nwell, so queries really form the basis for\n\n379\n00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:06.625\nthe majority of things that we need to do.\n\n380\n00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:09.255\nAll right so let's go ahead and\ntake a look if we could, and\n\n381\n00:19:09.255 --> 00:19:11.655\njust get this back up there to 45 minutes.\n\n382\n00:19:11.655 --> 00:19:16.440\nAnd let's start by zooming in real quick\nas we always do, to see where we are.\n\n383\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.940\nWe're in the monitoring workspace,\nas you can see.\n\n384\n00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.250\nAnd what we've done is gone to, at the top\nthere, queries, we've highlighted that.\n\n385\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.870\nAnd then we have our built in queries.\n\n386\n00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.270\nWe can see a list of them there.\n\n387\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.940\nI just happen to be highlighting\nthe all user group one.\n\n388\n00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.200\nWe've got a total of 17 built in queries.\n\n389\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.430\nWe can see that right up at the top\nleft hand side of the screen there.\n\n390\n00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.820\nAnd these are the ones, again almost\nall of them start with the word all, so\n\n391\n00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.650\nwe have a good indicator of that.\n\n392\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.740\nBut these are the ones that\nthe system provides for us, and\n\n393\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.910\nyou can see that they are in\ndifferent resource classes.\n\n394\n00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.080\nA lot of them are system resource.\n\n395\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.700\nA few of them, something like all unknown\ncomputers is in the unknown computer area.\n\n396\n00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.040\nAll users and user groups are in\nthe user group or user resource area.\n\n397\n00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.910\nBut most of them are on system\nresource as you can see.\n\n398\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.750\nSo things like all jail broken or\nrooted devices,\n\n399\n00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.270\nthat's a relatively new one that\nstarts to show up in 12 and 12 ARC2.\n\n400\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.988\nMobile devices says a lot about the world\nand the honest people we live with today.\n\n401\n00:20:14.988 --> 00:20:17.333\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All non-client systems,\n\n402\n00:20:17.333 --> 00:20:19.463\nall personal devices, all systems.\n\n403\n00:20:19.463 --> 00:20:22.453\nThese are all coming from\nthe system resource class and\n\n404\n00:20:22.453 --> 00:20:25.054\nwe can see also,\nwhich is kind of interesting,\n\n405\n00:20:25.054 --> 00:20:29.100\nI just want to take a moment to point\noff to the right that we have query IDs.\n\n406\n00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.030\nAnd every query has a unique\nidentifier associated with it.\n\n407\n00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:37.010\nIt's an individual object that is given\nan object identifier within the system, so\n\n408\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.410\nwe can track it and\nwe can use it as a unique instance.\n\n409\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.300\nSo no two queries,\nin other words, are identical.\n\n410\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.570\nEven though we may ask\nvery similar things,\n\n411\n00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.070\nthey actually are instantiated as\nindividually identifiable objects.\n\n412\n00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.700\nJust like users are with GUIDs and\nall that kind of stuff, same idea.\n\n413\n00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.370\nWe'll see this with packages as well.\n\n414\n00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.560\nWe start to create packages and\napplications, where those are gonna\n\n415\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.010\nbe given unique identifiers and\npackage IDs so we can track them as well.\n\n416\n00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.040\nAnd we'll see that in an upcoming episode,\nwhere we start getting in and\n\n417\n00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.960\ntalking about how to configure and\ndeploy software.\n\n418\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.382\nWe're gonna take a look at that,\nobviously, coming up shortly.\n\n419\n00:21:09.382 --> 00:21:13.430\nAll right, so now that we see where our\nqueries are, let's take a look at a query,\n\n420\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.170\njust get a sense of\nwhat's going on with it.\n\n421\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.420\nThen we're gonna go create our own.\n\n422\n00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.920\nIt's probably good to take a look\nat one that's already preformed,\n\n423\n00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.770\njust to get a sense of the moving parts.\n\n424\n00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:21.510\nSo I'm gonna go in.\n\n425\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.650\nI know Mike got all excited when I said\nall jail broken or rooted devices.\n\n426\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.320\nSo we're going to go ahead and\ngrab that one.\n\n427\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.050\nWhat I'm going to do is just right click\non it, and I'm just gonna zoom in for\n\n428\n00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.370\njust half a second so\nyou could see the options there.\n\n429\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.000\nYou'll see we can run the query.\n\n430\n00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.510\nRunning it implies, hey, let's go out,\nlet's execute that against the site server\n\n431\n00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:42.910\ndatabase, let's get back information that\nmay be sitting there, that populates.\n\n432\n00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.340\nAnd then as the result of that,\nwe can see what the outcome is.\n\n433\n00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.170\nNotice we have the option to\ninstall the client from the query.\n\n434\n00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:50.510\nWe can run the query.\n\n435\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:55.860\nSo if we do a system query that says hey,\nshow me all Windows Server 12 machines.\n\n436\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.490\nGet that back.\n\n437\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.130\nThose machines may or\nmay not have the agent on them already,\n\n438\n00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:03.020\ncuz they may have been discovered, but\nwe may not have installed the agent yet.\n\n439\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.950\nWe have the option to be\nable to install the client,\n\n440\n00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.720\nbased on the output of a query.\n\n441\n00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.340\nSo if we run against all unknown systems,\n\n442\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.030\nwe then can install the client,\nfor instance.\n\n443\n00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:11.910\nSo we could do that.\n\n444\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.435\nWe could export our query,\ngive it to somebody else.\n\n445\n00:22:14.435 --> 00:22:16.155\nSo obviously there's value there.\n\n446\n00:22:16.155 --> 00:22:17.535\nWe can delete the query.\n\n447\n00:22:17.535 --> 00:22:19.325\nObviously we know what that does.\n\n448\n00:22:19.325 --> 00:22:21.835\nWe can go ahead and\nwe can look at properties, and\n\n449\n00:22:21.835 --> 00:22:24.085\nproperties are then going to let us go\nin and see what the query looks like.\n\n450\n00:22:24.085 --> 00:22:26.085\nSo, we're going to go ahead,\nwe're going to take a look at that.\n\n451\n00:22:26.085 --> 00:22:28.015\nSo we're gonna click on properties.\n\n452\n00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:29.415\nJust give us a second to bring that up.\n\n453\n00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.810\nAnd when we do that, what we get is, and\n\n454\n00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.780\nI'll just point to the button\nbefore we actually do anything.\n\n455\n00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.030\nIs if we just get the general tab,\nwe can see the name of the query.\n\n456\n00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.010\nWe already knew that.\n\n457\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.970\nWe can object type system resource.\n\n458\n00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.640\nWe knew that by looking at\nthe summary screen we were just on.\n\n459\n00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.890\nSo, that's all there.\n\n460\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.020\nWe do see that we could\nedit the query statement.\n\n461\n00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.680\nI'm going to go in and\nshow you what it looks like in a minute.\n\n462\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.040\nSo, we'll click edit.\n\n463\n00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.080\nWe'll get the WQL editor up.\n\n464\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.900\nAnd then we have collection\nlimiting at the bottom.\n\n465\n00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.230\nIf you remember, we talked about\ncollection limiting as the starting point.\n\n466\n00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:06.090\nHey, let's take that collection, use that\nas the basis, and then we'll form our own.\n\n467\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.770\nWe're not doing collection\nlimiting on this particular query,\n\n468\n00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.460\nmeaning that it will run against any and\nall queries.\n\n469\n00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:16.770\nOr excuse me, the query will run against\nany or all collections in the system.\n\n470\n00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.990\nIf we do collection limiting,\nthen we're saying run this query,\n\n471\n00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.920\nbut only against this\nparticular collection.\n\n472\n00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.060\nSo it's up to us,\nwe can narrow the focus or make it wide.\n\n473\n00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:26.990\nIt's really up to us.\n\n474\n00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:31.210\nOr third option down there towards\nthe bottom by the way, just so\n\n475\n00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.100\nyou can see, is prompt for collection.\n\n476\n00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.170\n>> That's nice.\n>> We can actually say, hey,\n\n477\n00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.260\non the pop up screen,\nas we run the query, by the way,\n\n478\n00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.440\nMike, what collection out of this list do\nyou want us to run this query against?\n\n479\n00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.980\nCuz we may wanna target that query, but\n\n480\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.180\nwe may not feel comfortable making\nthe choice on behalf of our users.\n\n481\n00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.700\n>> I can see where that'd be really\nhandy if you're running a query that\n\n482\n00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.180\nwhen I run it I can choose\nwhich collection to hit.\n\n483\n00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.410\nSo this time I wanna run\nit against this collection.\n\n484\n00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.620\nThe next time I run it, I wanna run\nit against a different collection.\n\n485\n00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.212\nSo that's not hard coded.\n\n486\n00:23:59.212 --> 00:24:02.463\n>> Exactly, now that's a new\n2012 R2 feature by the way,\n\n487\n00:24:02.463 --> 00:24:06.735\nbecause we didn't have the prompt for\na collection In the earlier versions, so\n\n488\n00:24:06.735 --> 00:24:08.922\nthat's actually new and that's nice.\n\n489\n00:24:08.922 --> 00:24:11.323\nAll right, so Edit Query or\nEdit Query Statement rather,\n\n490\n00:24:11.323 --> 00:24:14.508\nlet me just click that bottom and we'll\nsee what comes up here in the second and\n\n491\n00:24:14.508 --> 00:24:16.700\nthen I'll drill in again and\nlet you see that.\n\n492\n00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.180\nSo when we do Edit Query what\nwe're gonna get is three tabs.\n\n493\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.850\nWere going to get the General,\n\n494\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.820\nCriteria and Joins tabs, we'll break these\ndown and go through each one for you.\n\n495\n00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.800\nOn the General tab you'll\nsee that we have the class,\n\n496\n00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.110\nwe have the attribute, and\nwe have whether it is sorted and\n\n497\n00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:42.870\nwe have the ability up here to be able to\ngo in and add new, to be able to delete,\n\n498\n00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.260\nmodify, re-order those up and\ndown arrows on the left and\n\n499\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.380\nright there, off to the right hand\nside are allowing us to reorder.\n\n500\n00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.510\nSo we're gonna be able to go in and\nsee those.\n\n501\n00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:59.470\nNow we also have the option down below\nhere, To Show Query Language, right there.\n\n502\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:04.600\nWhat we're looking at right now is\nthe human readable, user friendly version.\n\n503\n00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.990\nIf we wanna see the WQL language,\nwe can flip over to Show Query Language.\n\n504\n00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:13.010\nNow here's the issue with this, and\nI'll flip over just so you can see it, and\n\n505\n00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:20.640\nI'll zoom back in so that you can see what\nthat looks like in the query designer.\n\n506\n00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.120\nAnd so you can see here that\nthis is the WQL language.\n\n507\n00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.140\nAnd this is the actual underlying\nlanguage that creates the query force.\n\n508\n00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.950\nIt's probably a little\nbit of a better view.\n\n509\n00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.700\nNow here's the thing to\nunderstand about this.\n\n510\n00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.060\nSo good and bad again some stuff that\nthey don't really talk a lot about but\n\n511\n00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.600\nyou do need to be aware of when you\nstart to mess around with this stuff.\n\n512\n00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.370\nThis is one of those points\nthat's not well documented.\n\n513\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.690\nWe could use the Query designer\nas it's called here and\n\n514\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:51.710\nor the ability to show the Query language\na few, let me just zoom back in.\n\n515\n00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.280\nI'll just point what you'll see here.\n\n516\n00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.240\nThe Query designer is gonna be what we are\nlooking with a human friendly information.\n\n517\n00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.180\nThe Show Query language which was\nwhat we're looking at right now\n\n518\n00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.430\nis the Query editor, right?\n\n519\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.820\nNow, we can directly edit\nthe statement in WQL here,\n\n520\n00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.660\nbut if we don't understand the language,\nand we get it wrong, this is not like\n\n521\n00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.190\noffice where we have the oops, I didn't\nmean to do that arrow, the undo button.\n\n522\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.090\nThis is we put on our big person pants and\n\n523\n00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.410\nwe're gonna do this and\nget it right the first time.\n\n524\n00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.380\nSo there's no safety net, right?\n\n525\n00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.240\nWhich means if you edit in here, and you\nmake a mistake, we don't tell you you made\n\n526\n00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.640\na mistake, and you run the query,\nand it produces an error,\n\n527\n00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.870\nyou may not be able to get out of this\nscreen, because it locks the code.\n\n528\n00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.550\nAnd it locks it because the error, and\nyou may not be able to get back out\n\n529\n00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.800\nto fix it unless you blow out\nthe query and start over again.\n\n530\n00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:49.290\nSo a couple of things for you to be aware\nof, number one, always make a reference to\n\n531\n00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:55.230\nyour query statement, in other words,\ncopy it all and put it offline somewhere.\n\n532\n00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.610\nAnd I tend to use Notepad++,\n\n533\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.210\njust because it gives me the nice\nnumber lines and all that.\n\n534\n00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.300\nSo when I do my power shell scripts and\n\n535\n00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.900\nall that stuff, I'll put it into\nan editor I'll write it offline.\n\n536\n00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.260\nI'll make sure I have a copy of it,\nso that way if anything goes wrong,\n\n537\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.130\nI'll go back to it, number one.\n\n538\n00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.600\nSo you don't want to write your\nquery natively in here and\n\n539\n00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.450\nhave this be the only place you write\nyour code is what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n540\n00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.170\nWrite it somewhere else,\nbring it in, test it,\n\n541\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.640\nif it's bad blow it out go back,\nfix it and then bring it back in.\n\n542\n00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.590\nThe other this is that unless\nyou understand WQL natively,\n\n543\n00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.460\nmeaning unless you've spent the time and\n\n544\n00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.790\ninvested the energy to learn the language,\nyou should not be writing native code.\n\n545\n00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.926\nYou should be using the query builder,\nand the query designer and\n\n546\n00:27:34.926 --> 00:27:37.662\nwe're gonna show you how that works but\nthat's point and\n\n547\n00:27:37.662 --> 00:27:40.417\nclick graphical selection\ninterface user-friendly.\n\n548\n00:27:40.417 --> 00:27:44.360\nOh, here is the attribute what actually\nto be do I want, here's the class.\n\n549\n00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.610\nWhat class do I want.\n\n550\n00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:48.270\nWe make it easy for\nyou in other words, right?\n\n551\n00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.490\nWhat that does, is that builds\nthe interactive language here for you and\n\n552\n00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.070\nstitches it together automatically,\nbut it puts in the right joins, and\n\n553\n00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.350\nit puts the spacing in, and\nsets up the classes, does all that, so\n\n554\n00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.290\nyou don't need to worry about it.\n\n555\n00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.590\nI do this on a fairly regular basis.\n\n556\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.830\nAnd I don't write natively\nNWQL if I can avoid it.\n\n557\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.920\nBecause all though I do a lot of this,\nI don't do it enough to be good enough\n\n558\n00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.330\nat it that I can do it without getting it\nwrong on a regular basis the first time.\n\n559\n00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.290\nYou know the basic a queries\nthat I do all the time.\n\n560\n00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.290\nHey give me the system name,\nI can write that with no trouble but\n\n561\n00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:25.120\nwhen I get into complex stuff,\nI just don't do it often enough and\n\n562\n00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.380\nI'm not familiar enough with the language,\nthat I feel comfortable doing and\n\n563\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.890\ngetting it right right out of the gate.\n\n564\n00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:34.580\nSo I use the query builder myself, and I\nuse the design rather I should say myself.\n\n565\n00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.320\nI don't write natively in WQL.\n\n566\n00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.020\nSo just keep that in mind,\nI'm not suggesting for\n\n567\n00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.160\na minute you shouldn't rise to\nthe challenge, I'm just trying to show you\n\n568\n00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.120\nthat in the real world there are dos and\ndon'ts about products like this.\n\n569\n00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.810\nAnd while we give you both options,\nthis option is, while it's available and\n\n570\n00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.780\nexposed, you should definitely try to use\nit as a more advanced option if you're\n\n571\n00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.660\ngonna write the code natively.\n\n572\n00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.260\nSo just be aware of that and\nunderstand the logic of that.\n\n573\n00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.960\nOkay, all right so\nthat's what a query looks like.\n\n574\n00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.790\nAll right, now,\njust get out of here real quick.\n\n575\n00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:07.110\nLets go back over, I'm just gonna\nedit again, just give me a sec.\n\n576\n00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.940\nI'm gonna go back into the other two\ntabs and show you what they look like.\n\n577\n00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.030\nI just wanted to get out of that so\n\n578\n00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.185\nif we inadvertently made a mistake,\nby changing something, right?\n\n579\n00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:15.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We don't have to worry about it.\n\n580\n00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:18.690\nSo I'm gonna go to the Criteria tab and\nI'm gonna zoom in just so\n\n581\n00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.770\nyou can see that.\n\n582\n00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:24.820\nSo on Criteria tab there, you'll see\nthe Criteria Mobile Device Computer System\n\n583\n00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.020\nas Jailbroken or\nrooted devices equal, right?\n\n584\n00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:33.020\nSo, the idea there is that we are saying\nhey if the status is jailbroken or\n\n585\n00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.700\nrooted, that's what we want,\nso this is the criteria.\n\n586\n00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.860\nNotice we can add, we can modify,\nwe can delete, we can put in joiners,\n\n587\n00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.845\nall sorts of stuff in there and\nexpressions.\n\n588\n00:29:41.845 --> 00:29:45.720\nSo,we have the capabilities there,\nso, if we want to add a criteria\n\n589\n00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.580\nwe can click New right up there and\nwe would be able to go in.\n\n590\n00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.390\nAnd we will be able to add the criteria,\nand you can see we have criterion type,\n\n591\n00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.770\nwe have the ability to specify where,\nand the operators, and the values.\n\n592\n00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:01.760\nAgain if you're writing the code natively,\nyou gotta know how to do all this,\n\n593\n00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.890\nyou gotta understand what these are,\n\n594\n00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.590\nand you gotta understand\nthe right values for this.\n\n595\n00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:09.420\nIn this case it would be a type string,\nbut certain operators love different value\n\n596\n00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.100\ntypes, they won't use strings, they'll use\nsomething else, so we'd have to know that,\n\n597\n00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:19.250\nso here for instance under value\nlook at all the options we have.\n\n598\n00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:23.160\nNull, simple, prompted, attribute\nreference, SubSelected value, list.\n\n599\n00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.840\nAgain, writing the native WQL code,\nyou'd have to declare right,\n\n600\n00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.070\nthis particular criteria type and\nthen understand that all these other\n\n601\n00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.060\noptions below change\nbased on your selection.\n\n602\n00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.780\nKnow what they are and\nknow how to program them.\n\n603\n00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:40.120\nRight, so if I haven't dissuaded you\nfrom doing this yet good for you.\n\n604\n00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:40.860\nRight?\n\n605\n00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.210\n>> I do think you it might be a way to use\nthe user friendly point and click one and\n\n606\n00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:49.580\nthen flip over and view the statement\nthat it generates that's error free.\n\n607\n00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.280\n>> Absolutely.\n\n608\n00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.890\n>> Kind of as a way to start\nlearning a language or\n\n609\n00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.340\nget a little more familiar with it.\n\n610\n00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:58.490\n>> Absolutely so what I've done here,\nis I've gone ahead and\n\n611\n00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.280\nI have clicked on the select button.\n\n612\n00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:07.220\nRight there with wear and then as a result\nof that what you see is when I click\n\n613\n00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.410\non that select attribute I have\nattribute class, alias as and attribute.\n\n614\n00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.800\nThat also have to be defined.\n\n615\n00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.720\nAgain, you would have to understand how to\nwrite all this natively in the WQL code,\n\n616\n00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.390\nor as Mike pointed out,\nit's a great thought process.\n\n617\n00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:24.440\nYou come in here and you do it this way,\nwhere we've got the safety net set up and\n\n618\n00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.420\nwe've got the, the structure that\nallows you to make logical and\n\n619\n00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.090\naccessible choices that will work.\n\n620\n00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:35.520\nAnd then, once that's all compiled,\ngo take a look at the code and\n\n621\n00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.390\ntry to read through it and\nunderstand what you did.\n\n622\n00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.180\nAnd that's a good way to practice but\n\n623\n00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.620\nit may not be the best way to get started\nis what we're suggesting to you, right?\n\n624\n00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.840\nAnd so we can come in here and\nwe can do attribute class and,\n\n625\n00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.650\nlet me poke that up over here so it's\naway from that annoying little blue area.\n\n626\n00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.480\nAnd you can see here under\nthe attribute class, right?\n\n627\n00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.820\nLook at all these attributes, so\n\n628\n00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.990\nthis should start to look familiar to you,\nby the way.\n\n629\n00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.220\nRemember aren't those the hardware?\n\n630\n00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.359\n>> I remember those, yeah.\n\n631\n00:32:01.359 --> 00:32:04.881\n>> Inventory attributes that we took\na look at that we played around with and\n\n632\n00:32:04.881 --> 00:32:05.755\nactually added.\n\n633\n00:32:05.755 --> 00:32:10.748\nRight, doing the SMS_def.mof and\nthe attribute from the WMI Name\n\n634\n00:32:10.748 --> 00:32:14.970\nclass discussion we had in one\nthe episodes yesterday, right?\n\n635\n00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.488\nSo you can see that all\nof those are there.\n\n636\n00:32:17.488 --> 00:32:20.175\nNow the ones we added are not there\nbecause of course we've reset\n\n637\n00:32:20.175 --> 00:32:21.670\nthe environment since then.\n\n638\n00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.890\nBut they would be if I'd added them in and\nactually saved them,\n\n639\n00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.810\nthey'd be alphabetically on the list.\n\n640\n00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:30.300\nBut we have all of those,\nso, we make a choice there.\n\n641\n00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.703\nAnd so\nbased on let's just say that choice,\n\n642\n00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:39.820\nyou'll notice as we go\nthrough that the alias as and\n\n643\n00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:44.716\nthen the attributes\nare gonna be driven by that.\n\n644\n00:32:44.716 --> 00:32:48.409\nSo I made a choice for\n1394 fire wire controller and\n\n645\n00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:52.997\nthen my attribute pick list is\nprovided and then I can go and choose.\n\n646\n00:32:52.997 --> 00:32:57.071\nNow again I would have to know if\nI'm doing this natively in WQL,\n\n647\n00:32:57.071 --> 00:32:59.718\nnot only what my attribute class name is.\n\n648\n00:32:59.718 --> 00:33:00.253\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n649\n00:33:00.253 --> 00:33:03.539\n>> But then I'd have to know what\nattributes are declared for the class and\n\n650\n00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:07.043\nknow how to reference the attribute with\nthe proper name in order to be able to\n\n651\n00:33:07.043 --> 00:33:08.270\nmake it work.\n\n652\n00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.570\nSo if I didn't know that, I got it wrong,\n\n653\n00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.550\nI didn't reference it properly,\nthe query will not work.\n\n654\n00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.140\n>> Right.\n\n655\n00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.030\n>> But if I do it here,\nall of that is provided for me and\n\n656\n00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.520\nall I have to do is choose\nthe appropriate one.\n\n657\n00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.430\nSo we do just wanna make sure\nwe are aware of that and\n\n658\n00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.960\nwe have a sense of that, right?\n\n659\n00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.740\nSo, this is everything that's\ngoing on in the general area and\n\n660\n00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:32.828\nthen in the joins area, this is where we\nare able to see whatever joins we have.\n\n661\n00:33:32.828 --> 00:33:36.760\nThis attribute class System Resource\nas sys has the mobile computer or\n\n662\n00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.380\nmobile device computer system.\n\n663\n00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.990\nAs whatever, and it has the join there to\nallow us to effectively work through this\n\n664\n00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.690\nto be able to link to the data.\n\n665\n00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.680\nRemember we're going back and we're\nquerying against the site server database,\n\n666\n00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.420\nthe SQL database.\n\n667\n00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.530\nThis is all data structured in tables.\n\n668\n00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.850\nI mean, we could go into the SQL\nManagement Studio, go right to the tables,\n\n669\n00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.390\nfigure out what tables we want.\n\n670\n00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.890\nWe could pull the rows and\ntry to figure that out,\n\n671\n00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:04.580\nbut you think writing native\ncode in WQL is exciting, right?\n\n672\n00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.380\nTry doing that and\n\n673\n00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.400\ntell me how long it takes you to figure\nout what the system name is, right?\n\n674\n00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.320\nThat would take a while for\nyou to figure out and\n\n675\n00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.200\nif you can even do it all it would be\nvery, very complicated to do and you run\n\n676\n00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.750\nthe risk of damaging the data set in the\ntables of potentially corrupting the data.\n\n677\n00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.070\nSo, it's definitely not something\nwe recommend you to do,\n\n678\n00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.150\nat least not that way.\n\n679\n00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.410\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n680\n00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:24.920\nThis is the general structure\nof what a query looks like.\n\n681\n00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.140\nWhat we're gonna do know is actually\ngo in and write a query from scratch.\n\n682\n00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.858\nA simple one,\njust use a system resource and\n\n683\n00:34:29.858 --> 00:34:32.980\nkinda walk you through the steps involved\nwith getting it, one up and running.\n\n684\n00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.220\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n685\n00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.860\nSo the next thing we're\ngoing to do is go in and\n\n686\n00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.930\nwe're going actually get rid of what we\nhave there and create a brand new query.\n\n687\n00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.189\nSo, I'm gonna cancel out of this.\n\n688\n00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:44.800\nCancel out of this, and\nI'm gonna come over here to Queries.\n\n689\n00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.590\nI'm gonna right-click and\nI'll just show you before I do it,\n\n690\n00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.310\njust zoom in there real quick for you.\n\n691\n00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:52.020\nYou can see we right-click and\nwe're gonna create a query.\n\n692\n00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.320\nAnd we will then be able to go ahead and\nhave our query editor come up.\n\n693\n00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.730\nSo we'll give that a second.\n\n694\n00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:59.990\nCreate query wizard is there.\n\n695\n00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.740\nAnd we're gonna give our query a name,\ncall this\n\n696\n00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:09.340\nTest Query 1, just to keep track of it.\n\n697\n00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.200\nWe have the ability to\ndo some comments there.\n\n698\n00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.870\nI'm not really concerned about comments.\n\n699\n00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:14.920\nThat's descriptive, if you wanna say hey,\n\n700\n00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.876\nthis query should be able to return\nall server 12 machines or something.\n\n701\n00:35:18.876 --> 00:35:20.800\nIt's good from a documentation\nperspective, but\n\n702\n00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.120\nirrelevant to us in the sense, we don't\nneed to use that unless we choose to.\n\n703\n00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.500\nNow we do have two options here.\n\n704\n00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.840\nI'll kinda stick the mouse pointer\nbetween them and just zero in on them for\n\n705\n00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.750\nyou for a minute.\n\n706\n00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.020\nWe can go ahead and do either\nthe Import Query Statement option,\n\n707\n00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.060\nmeaning somebody's already written\na query, we wanna import that.\n\n708\n00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.320\nThat could also be one of the 17\ndefault queries that are there.\n\n709\n00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.340\nWe wanna use that as a starting point and\nthen edit that so\n\n710\n00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.070\nwe can do that if we'd like and\nor we can edit a query statement.\n\n711\n00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.850\nMeaning we can effectively write our own,\nedit is let's go write one,\n\n712\n00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.685\nimport is let me use an existing\none from somewhere and\n\n713\n00:35:53.685 --> 00:35:56.340\nlet me start with that\neffectively as a template.\n\n714\n00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.544\nAnd then when I save it, I'm leaving the\noriginal intact but I'm gonna modify it.\n\n715\n00:35:59.544 --> 00:36:01.170\nSo we have some options there.\n\n716\n00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.660\nIt's gonna really be up to us.\n\n717\n00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.450\nA lot of times you'll start with one of\nthe basic queries like all systems or\n\n718\n00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:09.000\nsomething and narrow that, because\nthe basic structure's already there.\n\n719\n00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.180\nSo it's up to you to decide\nhow you wanna do that.\n\n720\n00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.890\nWe're gonna go ahead and edit a query\nstatement in effect we'd create our own\n\n721\n00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.360\nfrom scratch, but\nthat will be up to you to decide.\n\n722\n00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.610\nSo we are going to,\n\n723\n00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.820\nI'm just going to pull down the object\ntype listing there for you.\n\n724\n00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:23.990\nLet me just scroll down so\n\n725\n00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:29.150\nwe can see the bottom of that particular\nlist and show that to you real quickly.\n\n726\n00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:34.660\nYou'll see under object type here that\nalthough we are gonna use system resource,\n\n727\n00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.370\nyou'll see that we do have\na fair number of those there.\n\n728\n00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.130\nAnd we would again have to\nmake the appropriate choice.\n\n729\n00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:46.270\nWe have a whole bunch that relate to\napplication, conflicts data, dependency,\n\n730\n00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.780\ndeployment, et cetera.\n\n731\n00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.765\nThose are gonna be related to\nsoftware packaging and deployment.\n\n732\n00:36:50.765 --> 00:36:54.975\nWe have collection data points,\nwe have deployment related stuff,\n\n733\n00:36:54.975 --> 00:36:58.635\nendpoint protection, so for doing\npoint protection will have some system\n\n734\n00:36:58.635 --> 00:37:03.552\nresource object types for\nthat, we have IP network.\n\n735\n00:37:03.552 --> 00:37:07.982\nWe can get networking information, we have\npackage and program specific information.\n\n736\n00:37:07.982 --> 00:37:11.392\nWe have security object types\nfrom a security standpoint.\n\n737\n00:37:11.392 --> 00:37:14.987\nWe have software metering in there,\nwe also have user resource and\n\n738\n00:37:14.987 --> 00:37:16.936\nuser group resource as we saw.\n\n739\n00:37:16.936 --> 00:37:20.136\nSo all of this any one or\nall of these are fair game for us.\n\n740\n00:37:20.136 --> 00:37:22.776\nProbably about 25 or so\non that list that we can use.\n\n741\n00:37:22.776 --> 00:37:25.938\nThe most common one more often than\nnot is gonna be system resource.\n\n742\n00:37:25.938 --> 00:37:27.666\nThat gets you all the stuff\non the computers right?\n\n743\n00:37:27.666 --> 00:37:28.826\nSo just so you know.\n\n744\n00:37:29.996 --> 00:37:31.276\nSo we'll choose system resource.\n\n745\n00:37:31.276 --> 00:37:35.543\nWe're gonna click Next there so\nthat we can get into this.\n\n746\n00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:42.242\nNow what we're gonna do,\noh you know what, hold on one second.\n\n747\n00:37:42.242 --> 00:37:43.000\nI am stupid.\n\n748\n00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.640\nClick Edit Query Statement before we\nclick Next, I was about to go query for\n\n749\n00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.000\nevery system with every\npossible combination.\n\n750\n00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.400\nI forgot, I zoomed in and I forgot I\ndid not click Edit Query to zoom in so\n\n751\n00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.800\nI was about to launch the query.\n\n752\n00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.720\nSo let's click Edit Query Statement and\nbring up the editor.\n\n753\n00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.000\nAnd, so what I'm gonna do is on the\nGeneral tab I'm gonna start by setting up,\n\n754\n00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.640\nor at least going in and starting to\nthink about setting up my information.\n\n755\n00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.720\nI'm gonna type in a couple of things and\nnarrate as I go.\n\n756\n00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.350\nAnd then I'll zoom in at certain\npoints to show you what's there.\n\n757\n00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.330\nWe've already shown you\nall the interfaces,\n\n758\n00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.120\ngiven you a sense of what they look like.\n\n759\n00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.690\nIn the demo as we broke\ndown an existing query, so\n\n760\n00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:22.310\nI'm not as concerned about showing you\nevery step so you can see it all again.\n\n761\n00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.850\nI just wanna get some basic\nstuff in there for you, and\n\n762\n00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:28.630\nthen from there we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to\n\n763\n00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:32.370\ngive you some of the specificity you need\nin order to understand what's going on.\n\n764\n00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.960\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click on the General tab.\n\n765\n00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.200\nThe asterisk or yellow star here,\nI will just zoom in quickly so\n\n766\n00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.180\nyou could see that.\n\n767\n00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.610\nThat's gonna allow me to\ncreate a new statement there.\n\n768\n00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.080\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna do that.\n\n769\n00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.490\nAnd when I do that,\n\n770\n00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.680\nwe're gonna have the ability to specify\nour attributes through a select statement.\n\n771\n00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.380\nAnd then depending on what we do,\nwe'll have a sort option there.\n\n772\n00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.710\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nSelect, and when we click Select,\n\n773\n00:38:55.710 --> 00:39:00.060\nyou have already seen this window, this\nis Attribute class, Alias, and Attribute.\n\n774\n00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.250\nWe saw this in the other ones.\n\n775\n00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.740\nSo we're gonna go in,\nwe're gonna make a selection here.\n\n776\n00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.740\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n777\n00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.710\nI'm gonna make sure system\nresources selected and it's there.\n\n778\n00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:13.420\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to\nselect NetBIOS Name in the attribute area.\n\n779\n00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.626\nBecause we want to pull the NetBIOS Name\nin on the machine and use that as the item\n\n780\n00:39:17.626 --> 00:39:22.280\nwe're gonna query for, so let's go\nscroll down in our list alphabetically.\n\n781\n00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.650\nAnd we're gonna go to NetBIOS Name.\n\n782\n00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.310\nNow I am gonna zoom in real quick and\njust show you something here.\n\n783\n00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.780\nOr at least give you the opportunity\nto see something right there.\n\n784\n00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.440\nYou see we have Name and NetBIOS Name.\n\n785\n00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.010\nWe have two names, right?\n\n786\n00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.820\nThe NetBIOS Name remember the user\nfriendly name we were used to in the old\n\n787\n00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.340\nway of doing things old school.\n\n788\n00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.220\nWe'd call that the WINS name,\nblast from the past.\n\n789\n00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.960\nWhen it was an Internet name service,\nright?\n\n790\n00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.509\nSo the NetBIOS name is\na user friendly name.\n\n791\n00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.770\nWill we want a prompt for a machine name?\n\n792\n00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:51.040\nWe usually wanna choose\nNetBIOS Name as opposed to Name,\n\n793\n00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.330\ncuz that's gonna return\nthe result we're expecting.\n\n794\n00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:54.250\nSo just be aware of that, all right?\n\n795\n00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.337\nSo we're gonna choose NetBIOS Name,\nso we're gonna put that in there.\n\n796\n00:39:58.337 --> 00:40:00.337\nAnd then we're gonna click OK.\n\n797\n00:40:00.337 --> 00:40:05.310\nThat's gonna come back and then what\nwe have there again we I talked about\n\n798\n00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:09.954\nknowing how to write this in WQL you\nsee what came up you could even see\n\n799\n00:40:09.954 --> 00:40:14.601\nthe whole thing the system\nresource as SMS_R_System- NetBIOS,\n\n800\n00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:17.230\nit trails off and says NetBIOS Naive.\n\n801\n00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.070\nYou don't have to write\nthat whole string in WQL,\n\n802\n00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.880\nin order to get what I just did to work.\n\n803\n00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.880\n>> Nice.\n>> A little bit easier for me and\n\n804\n00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.800\nprobably for most of us, right?\n\n805\n00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.352\nNot Mike cuz he's a super star,\nhe could do this with his eyes closed.\n\n806\n00:40:28.352 --> 00:40:31.659\nHe actually does it like Jimmy Hendrix\nused to do, he does it behind his\n\n807\n00:40:31.659 --> 00:40:34.780\nshoulders, blind folded backwards and\nit can type it all in.\n\n808\n00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.330\nIt's like this, he's just doing this.\n\n809\n00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:40.290\nRight.\nAmazing, absolutely amazing.\n\n810\n00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:43.380\nThe man is an SMS legend\nin his own mind all right.\n\n811\n00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.520\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're going\nto be able to put that in there and\n\n812\n00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.890\nthen go ahead and go to see me\ndo this now where to click OK.\n\n813\n00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:54.750\nAnd we are gonna have that I have that\ncome back and then what you'll see\n\n814\n00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.930\non the screen there is that we have\nsystem resource NetBIOS name unsorted.\n\n815\n00:40:58.930 --> 00:40:59.940\nSo that's fine.\n\n816\n00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:00.590\nRight.\n\n817\n00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:03.750\nNow if we take a look at the query\nlanguage for just a second.\n\n818\n00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:07.870\nIt's not too complicated at this\npoint What you see is we have\n\n819\n00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.360\nall of that right there.\n\n820\n00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.890\nThat's the entire string that you saw\npart of on that particular field but\n\n821\n00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.560\ncouldn't see cuz it trailed off.\n\n822\n00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.160\nThat's the whole select statement\nthat we just created by pointing and\n\n823\n00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.670\nclicking that you would\nhave to write in WQL.\n\n824\n00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.730\nNow that's not a long, but it's not\nreal hard, it's probably not a big deal.\n\n825\n00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.040\nBut here is something that you\ndo need to be aware of for\n\n826\n00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.530\ninstance I know it's hard to see\nbecause of the highlighting, but\n\n827\n00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:33.900\nthere are underscores between SMS and\nR and R and System.\n\n828\n00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.820\nIf you don't get those underscores there,\nyou're done,\n\n829\n00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.080\nthere's a period between System and\nNetbios.\n\n830\n00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.750\nI know it's hard to see, it's almost\ninvisible, you need to know that and\n\n831\n00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:42.880\nput it in there.\n\n832\n00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.790\nThere are again those\nunderscores at the end, and\n\n833\n00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:50.010\nnotice the NetbiosName is all together\nin one string with no spaces.\n\n834\n00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:54.510\nIf you don't write that out the right way\nyou're not gonna get this to work, right?\n\n835\n00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.710\nSo I know we keep harping on it,\n\n836\n00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.340\nI'm sure you probably have\na general sense of that by now.\n\n837\n00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.560\nBut just because I'm\nlike a dog with a bone,\n\n838\n00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.010\nI'm gonna keep beating on that\nmessage until we finish up here.\n\n839\n00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.770\nAll right, but\nyou get the general idea right?\n\n840\n00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.850\nSo you can see that although it's\nrelatively straightforward to do,\n\n841\n00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.260\nit is easier to do in a point and click\nenvironment with regards to creating that.\n\n842\n00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:12.760\nRight?\n\n843\n00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.750\nSo we have our Net BIOS name.\n\n844\n00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:20.420\nThen we're gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to go in and\n\n845\n00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.320\nwe are going to select another one.\n\n846\n00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:27.520\nSo we're gonna put one more in, so\nlet me just go ahead and do this.\n\n847\n00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.640\nAnd we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna go to attribute and\n\n848\n00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.720\ngonna make sure system resource is there.\n\n849\n00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.320\nAnd this time I'm gonna put an IP address,\nso\n\n850\n00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.200\nwe're going to want to have a query\nfrom machine and an IP address.\n\n851\n00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.030\nAnd I'll just zero in there just so\nyou can see the options,\n\n852\n00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.940\nlet me just highlight IP and\nthen show you what is there.\n\n853\n00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.830\nNotice, that we have IP address,\nbut we have IP subnets,\n\n854\n00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.820\nIPv6 addresses and IPv6 Prefixes.\n\n855\n00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:59.000\nSo, we need to make sure we're\nthinking about what IP address or\n\n856\n00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.050\nhow we want IP addresses to be used.\n\n857\n00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.690\nCause we could do a subnet versus\nan IP address or a range, right?\n\n858\n00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:09.210\nSo we have to know that and also IPv6,\nso just keep that in mind, right?\n\n859\n00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:13.530\nAnd remember subnets in IPv4\nare prefixes in IPv6, right?\n\n860\n00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:15.780\nSo the reason we don't see,\nbecause I get that a lot,\n\n861\n00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.430\nhey why don't we have subnets on one and\nnot on the other?\n\n862\n00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.630\nBecause subnets are not\ncalled prefixes in IPv6,\n\n863\n00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.650\nso you just make sure\nyou know that as well.\n\n864\n00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.060\nAll right.\nSo, IP addresses,\n\n865\n00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:30.190\nwe're gonna put that in there,\nclick OK, I'll get that back there,\n\n866\n00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:33.440\nwe'll see that and\nif we take a look at query language now,\n\n867\n00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.975\nwe'll see really add a lot of\ncomplexity in there by adding that in.\n\n868\n00:43:38.975 --> 00:43:41.365\nWe still have the NetBiosName but\nnow system data,\n\n869\n00:43:41.365 --> 00:43:45.495\nIP addresses from SMS_R_System\nis what we've added in.\n\n870\n00:43:45.495 --> 00:43:49.585\nSo that's what the query language looks\nlike at this point and that's set up.\n\n871\n00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:53.870\nSo now that we've done that,\nwe're then gonna go ahead and\n\n872\n00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:59.160\nwe are going to click OK and\nwe're gonna close this out.\n\n873\n00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:05.390\nLe's just take a look quickly at one\nthing here, go there, okay, yeah.\n\n874\n00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:07.880\nLet me just get in to\nthe joints area to show you\n\n875\n00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.090\nthat the only thing we have on the joints\narea is the reference to the system class.\n\n876\n00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.560\nIn this case System Resource, right?\n\n877\n00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.745\nCuz we're not doing a very complex query,\nwe're just doing one thing.\n\n878\n00:44:16.745 --> 00:44:18.990\n>> Yes, it's nice when all\nthe things you're looking for\n\n879\n00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.880\nare from a single class, then I don't\nhave to worry about those joins.\n\n880\n00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.168\nWe start pulling attributes\nfrom different classes,\n\n881\n00:44:24.168 --> 00:44:26.285\nthat's when it starts\nreally getting complex.\n\n882\n00:44:26.285 --> 00:44:27.615\n>> Yeah,\nbecause then you gotta create joins,\n\n883\n00:44:27.615 --> 00:44:30.505\njoins effectively are connections\nbetween the tables, right?\n\n884\n00:44:30.505 --> 00:44:33.395\nAnd the idea here is that we're really\njust going into one area, and we're\n\n885\n00:44:33.395 --> 00:44:37.335\npulling data from one, think of it as one\nsilo, we're not connecting out to other\n\n886\n00:44:37.335 --> 00:44:41.270\nareas, so as Mike pointed out this makes\nit very simple for us in that respect.\n\n887\n00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.050\nSo we're gonna click OK and\n\n888\n00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:46.850\nthen what we now have is we have our\nquery in effect back in there and so\n\n889\n00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.240\nnow what we can do is now if I click Next\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n890\n00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.540\n>> We won't get that stupid pop-up\n\n891\n00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.300\nthat says hey do you wanna run\nthis against the entire database?\n\n892\n00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.870\nSo now we have our summary screen,\n\n893\n00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.840\nno big deal we're just gonna click Next\nthere because we're gonna finish that up.\n\n894\n00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.660\nGonna let that finish,\nit comes out when we are done,\n\n895\n00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.060\nthis is what you do want to see.\n\n896\n00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:07.227\nYou want to see that it came back and\nwas successful, created the query for us,\n\n897\n00:45:07.227 --> 00:45:15.186\nso we can see that there, and then, We\nhave our query, it's gonna be down here.\n\n898\n00:45:15.186 --> 00:45:18.170\nLet me just scroll down so\nwe can see that and we'll highlight it.\n\n899\n00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:24.583\nAnd, Right there,\n\n900\n00:45:24.583 --> 00:45:30.000\nis our query, it's just sitting\nthere alphabetically, right.\n\n901\n00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.680\nNow, we created it, but\nwe didn't run it yet, right.\n\n902\n00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.460\nSo now if we want to actually see\nwhat that potential query may do for\n\n903\n00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:41.430\nus, what we're then going to do is,\nwe would have to right-click on it and\n\n904\n00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.460\nremember we talked about\nusing the run option.\n\n905\n00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.717\nSo we would come up there and do run,\n\n906\n00:45:45.717 --> 00:45:51.492\n[COUGH] we'll give that a second,\n>> Those are words and\n\n907\n00:45:51.492 --> 00:45:52.630\ngrinds in the background.\n\n908\n00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:57.335\nGotta get the hamsters\nup on the wheel and-\n\n909\n00:45:57.335 --> 00:45:59.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n910\n00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:00.098\n>> Get them going.\n\n911\n00:46:02.316 --> 00:46:06.500\nAnd of course, I guess this would depend\ntoo on how large your data set was.\n\n912\n00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.590\nLarge organizations, these queries\nmight take even longer to run.\n\n913\n00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.010\n>> They could, yes, absolutely.\n\n914\n00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:17.415\nAnd so, what I'm wanting to make sure is\nthat it actually registered the click.\n\n915\n00:46:17.415 --> 00:46:21.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it is not letting me click.\n\n916\n00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:24.860\nLet's just change focus real quick and\ncome back, cuz it may have actually\n\n917\n00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.900\nrun to the background, but\nit may not be displaying yet.\n\n918\n00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.600\nLet's just see here,\nyou'll just see me popping back and\n\n919\n00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.750\nforth real quick, there we go, okay.\n\n920\n00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:39.340\nWhy is that, now it's Randomly sorting,\nall right so let's give it a second.\n\n921\n00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.939\nIt looks like it is doing something,\nI believe it is trying to think and\n\n922\n00:46:42.939 --> 00:46:43.856\nultimately run.\n\n923\n00:46:43.856 --> 00:46:46.937\nBut we have a little lag sometimes\nin the lab environment and\n\n924\n00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:50.480\nso when it goes to do something\nit doesn't display right away.\n\n925\n00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.520\nNow we just do this by the way,\n\n926\n00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.660\nMike pointed this out, in the real\nworld depending on the data set and\n\n927\n00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:59.770\nof course how big that is, it could take\na moment or two, for that to come back.\n\n928\n00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:03.718\nLet's try that again cuz it didn't,\nit does not look like it actually ran and\n\n929\n00:47:03.718 --> 00:47:04.949\nregistered anything.\n\n930\n00:47:04.949 --> 00:47:06.581\nSo let's just try that one more time,\n\n931\n00:47:06.581 --> 00:47:09.400\nand if that one doesn't work we'll\ndo one of the all system ones.\n\n932\n00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.720\nThat should bring back some results for\nus, but what we should see happening is\n\n933\n00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.570\nwe should then get the results\nto come back up in display.\n\n934\n00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:17.320\nAnd so we'll give that a second,\n\n935\n00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:21.040\nwhat we're gonna take a look at as soon\nas that runs, is how to export a query.\n\n936\n00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.030\nCuz you may wanna take a query and\nexport that out to a MOF file, and\n\n937\n00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.860\nthen be able to use that.\n\n938\n00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.560\nRemember, we talked about the sms_dev.mof?\n\n939\n00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.250\nYou may wanna write that query,\nand then export that out and\n\n940\n00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:32.280\nbring that in as a SMS.\n\n941\n00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.350\nThere we go.\nAs an sms_def.mof file, or\n\n942\n00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:39.340\nthe building blocks for that, and\nthen use that to be able to drive\n\n943\n00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.510\nyour ability to add classes or\nadd components in.\n\n944\n00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:45.135\nSo, we'll take a look at how to\nexport the query, the query did run,\n\n945\n00:47:45.135 --> 00:47:46.421\nit just took a minute to refresh.\n\n946\n00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:49.461\nSo, if we take a look, and\nwe'll zoom in so you could see it,\n\n947\n00:47:49.461 --> 00:47:53.518\nif you take a look here, what you'll see\nis we have the results for Test Query 1,\n\n948\n00:47:53.518 --> 00:47:55.087\nthat's what we expect to see.\n\n949\n00:47:55.087 --> 00:47:58.419\nUnder the Query area there,\nwe get a little folder that says hey,\n\n950\n00:47:58.419 --> 00:47:59.580\nhere's the results.\n\n951\n00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.837\nAnd then off to the right here.\n\n952\n00:48:01.837 --> 00:48:04.221\nBecause remember we only didn't\nhave bios statement IP address so,\n\n953\n00:48:04.221 --> 00:48:05.890\nthose are the two we would expect to see.\n\n954\n00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:09.680\nWe actually get a query back,\nthat shows us those items.\n\n955\n00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.220\nSo we see all of the machines and\nwe see the IP addresses.\n\n956\n00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.270\nThat exist for those machines and\nit's interesting that we do have\n\n957\n00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:21.190\ntwo machines and\nhave the actually group of machines but,\n\n958\n00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:23.325\nyou'll see that we have a couple\nof the same IP address.\n\n959\n00:48:23.325 --> 00:48:24.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, that yeah,\n\n960\n00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:28.330\nas I told you these are virtual instances,\nsome of them don't exist, right?\n\n961\n00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:32.600\nSo, they're only turned on for certain\nportions, to certain demos that we do so,\n\n962\n00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.310\nas a result we connect them to multiple\nmachines that actually do have\n\n963\n00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:38.080\nthe same IP address cuz they're\nnever on at the same time.\n\n964\n00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.250\nBut they all are in the site database,\nright?\n\n965\n00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.800\nSo as a result we do get that back\neven though it's kinda strange,\n\n966\n00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.680\nwouldn't normally see\nthat in the real world.\n\n967\n00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.135\nThis is a quirk of our demo environment.\n\n968\n00:48:47.135 --> 00:48:48.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, the reality is still\n\n969\n00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.180\nthe same, right?\n\n970\n00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.790\nWe're getting back a bunch of\nNetBIOS names from machines.\n\n971\n00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:53.120\nAnd a bunch of IP strings,\n\n972\n00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.060\nwhatever's registered in the site\ndatabase as a result of that.\n\n973\n00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.810\nSo we can see the result there.\n\n974\n00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:00.720\nThen when we're done with that and we say,\nhey that's good, but I want to go back to\n\n975\n00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.040\nsee my list of queries, just click on that\nand our queries are back there again.\n\n976\n00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.100\nAnd then if we want to go back in and at\nsome point, take a look at those results,\n\n977\n00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:14.210\nwe can click back on the results folder\nand the results folder will have that\n\n978\n00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:17.640\ninformation there just takes some moments\nto run and it brings a back up for us.\n\n979\n00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.750\n>> Nice.\n>> So that it will just\n\n980\n00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.920\nbring back the information and\nshowing to us again.\n\n981\n00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.204\nAnd so we have gone ahead, we've created\na query what we're going to do as I said,\n\n982\n00:49:25.204 --> 00:49:27.030\nis take a look at how to export that out.\n\n983\n00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:29.360\nSo I'm gonna just bring\nback up my query list.\n\n984\n00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.850\nAnd then we'll go ahead and we'll take\na look at how to export out that query.\n\n985\n00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:36.410\nAnd then once we've done that, we'll have\nthat in a file that we can then use as I\n\n986\n00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:41.300\nsaid to drive something like\nan sms_dev.mof if we wanna do that.\n\n987\n00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.880\nOr we could just give that\nquery to somebody else.\n\n988\n00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.460\nWe don't have to necessarily export it\nout and use it as a mof file for us.\n\n989\n00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:51.400\nBut we could export the query and hand it\nto somebody, let them use it in their SMS,\n\n990\n00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.390\nor excuse me, in their SCCM system.\n\n991\n00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.010\n>> I would think, very useful too, like\nyou were talking about setting up a test\n\n992\n00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:59.670\nenvironment, maybe a virtual environment,\nwriting our queries there.\n\n993\n00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:03.420\nI can then export it, bring it over to\nmy production environment, import it in?\n\n994\n00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.640\n>> You definitely could, absolutely, yeah.\n\n995\n00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.020\nIf you get them done there\nthat would be the way to go.\n\n996\n00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.460\nThat would definitely be the way to go.\n\n997\n00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.390\nSo you can see we've highlighted,\nI've highlighted the test query.\n\n998\n00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:15.010\nI'm just zooming in real quick so you can\nsee we've got that export menu there.\n\n999\n00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:18.520\nSo we're gonna click on that at the export\npop out option on the menu I should say.\n\n1000\n00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.940\nSo we're gonna be able to do that.\n\n1001\n00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.140\nSo let's just click on export.\n\n1002\n00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:24.520\nWe'll see that we get a little wizard\nthat pops up here, take just a moment for\n\n1003\n00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.010\nit to do that, our export objects wizard.\n\n1004\n00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:28.680\nI'm gonna click through\nthe welcome screen,\n\n1005\n00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.100\nreally nothing to worry about there.\n\n1006\n00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:34.300\nWhat we're then gonna see, and\nI'll just center this before we zoom in,\n\n1007\n00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.780\nis the Select Objects to Export here.\n\n1008\n00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:43.340\nUse the wizard it says up top and we get\nin there a little more you can see that.\n\n1009\n00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.720\nTo export one or more objects\nfrom the Config Manager console\n\n1010\n00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:51.750\nsave those exported objects as MOF or\nManaged Object Format files.\n\n1011\n00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:54.650\nWe can them import them to\nanother Config Manager database.\n\n1012\n00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.760\nAnd add those objects in, so\nwe actually can do that if we choose to.\n\n1013\n00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.260\nSo you'll see that we will have our query,\nthis is the one that we selected.\n\n1014\n00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.960\nNow, what you'll notice right above it,\nand we'll zoom in just a little so you can\n\n1015\n00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.300\nsee that, you'll need read permission for\neach object you wanna export.\n\n1016\n00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.110\nSo we obviously would have to have\nread permission to able to go down and\n\n1017\n00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:15.560\nmake a selection here.\n\n1018\n00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.710\nRight so just be aware of that.\n\n1019\n00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.910\nSo we will go in,\nwe will choose that one right there.\n\n1020\n00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:27.400\nWe'll click next, we have to give\nthe MOF file a name and a path.\n\n1021\n00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:30.560\nI like to throw things out on my\ndesktop so I know where to find them.\n\n1022\n00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.130\nThat way when I go to look for\nthem I'm not wondering where they are, so\n\n1023\n00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:35.900\nI'm going to go ahead and just do that.\n\n1024\n00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.860\nAnd I'm going to call this\ntest one because that will\n\n1025\n00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.650\nbe the name of the query, so it makes\nsense we would typically want to name\n\n1026\n00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:44.010\nthat export file the same so\nwe know what it is.\n\n1027\n00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:46.149\nClick save.\n\n1028\n00:51:48.645 --> 00:51:52.545\nPath statement in there for us and\nthen just gonna click next,\n\n1029\n00:51:52.545 --> 00:51:55.660\nget to our summary screen,\nclick next again.\n\n1030\n00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.910\nThat exports pretty quickly\ndoes not take very long at all.\n\n1031\n00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:03.790\nAnd then, when we do that and we go\nout to our desktop what we can see and\n\n1032\n00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.920\nI'll just highlight it so you can see it.\n\n1033\n00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.780\nAnd we'll zoom in, is right there.\n\n1034\n00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:12.780\nThere's our Test1.MOF file\nsitting on the desktop, right.\n\n1035\n00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.980\nSo it's easy enough to be able to do that.\n\n1036\n00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:17.640\nAnd then we would take that,\nwe would give that to somebody.\n\n1037\n00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.660\nProbably email it to them or whatever.\n\n1038\n00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:23.910\nAnd then they would just simply run Import\nas opposed to Export to bring it in.\n\n1039\n00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.990\nThen give them the opportunity to do\nwhatever they need to do with it.\n\n1040\n00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.460\nSo be very straightforward\nin that respect for\n\n1041\n00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.560\nus to be able to import\nthat if we needed to.\n\n1042\n00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.070\nRight?\n\n1043\n00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:33.270\n>> Very nice.\n\n1044\n00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:35.600\n>> And by the way when we\ntalk about import, just so\n\n1045\n00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.480\nyou can see it up here, what we're talking\nabout there is that import objects item\n\n1046\n00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.100\nthat's sitting up on the, the ribbon.\n\n1047\n00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.890\nThat's what we would do to bring\nthat in after we export, so,\n\n1048\n00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:47.250\nif we are sitting there and\nI give that to Mike and Mike says,\n\n1049\n00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:51.200\nhey let me load up that query, give me\nthat MOF file, he;s gonna get that file,\n\n1050\n00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.230\nput it somewhere, then run that import\nobjects item, and in effect we just path\n\n1051\n00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:59.100\nout to the file, and then it'll load and\nparse into the database and set itself up.\n\n1052\n00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.330\nSo that's what we're gonna be able to\ndo there, if we choose to do that.\n\n1053\n00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:03.590\nThat's obviously gonna be up to you.\n\n1054\n00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:06.570\nAll right, so\nif we were to import a query, right,\n\n1055\n00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:10.150\nlet's just quickly take a look at that\nsince we have the ability to do that.\n\n1056\n00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:13.800\nWhat we'd want to do is we'd obviously\nwant to get rid of the query that we\n\n1057\n00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:14.710\nalready have there.\n\n1058\n00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.380\nSo let's go ahead and\nget rid of that real quick.\n\n1059\n00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:20.400\nWe'll delete that out, so that way if\nwe import it we're not gonna import and\n\n1060\n00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.610\nsay oh we already have one of those,\nright?\n\n1061\n00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.080\nSo we'll just do that real quick.\n\n1062\n00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.539\nWe'll then go ahead and do an import.\n\n1063\n00:53:29.312 --> 00:53:31.884\nAnd that first screen on\nthe Import Wizard was just,\n\n1064\n00:53:31.884 --> 00:53:34.540\nhey, the welcome screen,\nno big deal there.\n\n1065\n00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:38.890\nThis one is where we really make the magic\nhappen, give us the MOF path and\n\n1066\n00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:39.530\nfile name.\n\n1067\n00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:41.260\nSo we're gonna go out and grab that.\n\n1068\n00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.360\nSo that's gonna be the file that\nwe exported and given to somebody.\n\n1069\n00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:48.220\nSo I'll just go out and browse and\nI will go grab that off the desktop.\n\n1070\n00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:50.850\nIt's amazing what happens when\nthe file is named the right way, and\n\n1071\n00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:54.370\nyou can see it there without having to\ngo through three different attempts.\n\n1072\n00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:56.600\nNot that I would ever do that,\nof course, but, you know.\n\n1073\n00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:00.500\nFor people that don't realize that they\nsaved the MOF file as a MOF.txt file,\n\n1074\n00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.160\nthat would be something that would happen.\n\n1075\n00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.500\nAt least that's what I've heard anyway.\n\n1076\n00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.460\nAll right, so we're gonna highlight that.\n\n1077\n00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.360\nWe're going to go ahead and\nwe're going to click Open.\n\n1078\n00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.050\nWe're going to click Next here.\n\n1079\n00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:14.790\nWe then have the option to review the name\nof the objects that we will import.\n\n1080\n00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.700\nIt's called the Test Query 1, so you can\nsee that there, it's got the name right\n\n1081\n00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:21.570\nthere, it's just effectively saying hey,\nis this really what you want?\n\n1082\n00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:23.260\nYeah, it is.\nYou know we don't really have an option to\n\n1083\n00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.940\nchange it there as you can see.\n\n1084\n00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.440\nIt's just showing it to us.\n\n1085\n00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.500\nWe may add a comment in there.\n\n1086\n00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.810\nRight?\n\n1087\n00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:32.770\nSo we could add a comment in if we chose.\n\n1088\n00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:35.520\nType something, it's up to us to\ndecide whether or not we want to.\n\n1089\n00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.720\nIf there was a comment that was\nalready in the file we would see it.\n\n1090\n00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:42.450\nClick next and give that just a second.\n\n1091\n00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:47.580\nHit Close and\nthen you can see right there that\n\n1092\n00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:52.500\nthe query is now back, even though I had\ndeleted it out, it is now back in there.\n\n1093\n00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:57.460\nSo that's all we would need to do to be\nable to use the MOF export to then import.\n\n1094\n00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.160\n>> Could we use this export as a way\nto back up our queries as well,\n\n1095\n00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.120\nlike to keep a safe copy of them?\n\n1096\n00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.320\n>> We could because they\nare in a MOF file format and\n\n1097\n00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:07.310\nwe could then in theory if something\nwere to go wrong re-import them.\n\n1098\n00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:10.020\nBut keep in mind we would\nneed a lot of additional data\n\n1099\n00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.760\nthat's not backed up through this export\nto reconstitute this entire environment.\n\n1100\n00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.760\n>> Yeah.\n>> I know you're saying,\n\n1101\n00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:15.942\nhey just the query piece, right?\n\n1102\n00:55:15.942 --> 00:55:17.360\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Language you have.\n\n1103\n00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.634\n>> Just as safeguard, absolutely.\n\n1104\n00:55:18.634 --> 00:55:22.295\nBut this is not enough to be able to\nreconstitute the entire SCCS environment\n\n1105\n00:55:22.295 --> 00:55:23.425\nif something were to go wrong.\n\n1106\n00:55:23.425 --> 00:55:27.755\nWe have to back up the site database and\nback up all the configuration information\n\n1107\n00:55:27.755 --> 00:55:32.840\nusing our back up tasks and all the things\nwe do for disaster recovery over all.\n\n1108\n00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.620\nNow the good news is, we get all those\nqueries as part of that backup anyway.\n\n1109\n00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.370\n>> Oh, okay.\n>> So assuming that we have done that, and\n\n1110\n00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:38.570\nwe should be doing that.\n\n1111\n00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:40.640\nAssuming that we do all that,\nwe'll have them.\n\n1112\n00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.990\nBut it's never a bad idea to have\na secondary copy just in case.\n\n1113\n00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:46.180\nSo it's not a bad idea at all,\nwouldn't be a bad idea to do that.\n\n1114\n00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:49.369\nAll right, so the other part of our\ndiscussion here that we said we wanna\n\n1115\n00:55:49.369 --> 00:55:52.040\nfocus on is how do we set up and\ninstall Reporting Services?\n\n1116\n00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:57.212\nWe've gone through Done hopefully a fairly\ngood job of dealing with queries for you.\n\n1117\n00:55:57.212 --> 00:56:00.460\nAt least I hope you have a better sense\nof what queries are for the moment.\n\n1118\n00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.540\nWhat we're gonna do is spend a couple\nof minutes talking about what we do now\n\n1119\n00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:06.130\nthe queries are up and running,\nwhich is to take them and\n\n1120\n00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:09.500\ntransport those outputs if you will.\n\n1121\n00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.680\nBecause we can run the queries and\njust see them in the console, but\n\n1122\n00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.410\nthat's probably not the best way\nto consume that information.\n\n1123\n00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:17.880\nAt least not for the user anyway,\nfor the administrator, no big deal.\n\n1124\n00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.830\nBut, for let's say a high level\nC executive of some kind,\n\n1125\n00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:26.700\nmaybe a mid-level manager who you're not\ngonna give rights to the console and\n\n1126\n00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.680\nhave them go in to start running queries,\nbut\n\n1127\n00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.700\nyou want them to be able to\nsee inventory status updates.\n\n1128\n00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.110\nYou want them to be able to see\nasset management information,\n\n1129\n00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:38.140\nyou want them to be able to see software\nusage, you're gonna want reports.\n\n1130\n00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.210\nAnd so what we're gonna wanna do\nultimately is create a reporting services\n\n1131\n00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:44.530\npoint, configure that, and then show\nyou how to set that up and run reports.\n\n1132\n00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:47.420\nSo that's what we're gonna do next,\nwe're gonna go back into the environment,\n\n1133\n00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:50.890\ngonna take a look at SQL Reporting\nServices, what used to be called SRS,\n\n1134\n00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:53.860\njust now SQL Reporting Services,\nand we're gonna configure that.\n\n1135\n00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.570\nNow this is a multi-step process.\n\n1136\n00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:59.440\nThe first thing we're gonna do is actually\ntalk about the back end work I've already\n\n1137\n00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:03.080\ndone, which is to configure and\nset up SQL Reporting Services\n\n1138\n00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.720\nin the system where SQL lives,\nso on the SQL database.\n\n1139\n00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.450\nThen, we have a web interface where\nwe can go in and configure that.\n\n1140\n00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:12.620\nSo we'll take a look at that and kinda see\nthe behind the scenes stuff that's done\n\n1141\n00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:17.200\nprior to actually installing the SQL\nReporting Point site role, which is where\n\n1142\n00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.760\nwe are gonna pick up and actually do\nwork and show you live what goes on.\n\n1143\n00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:24.170\nSo we'll configure that role,\nwhich is actually fairly straight forward.\n\n1144\n00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:26.680\nAnd then from there\nwe'll let that cook for\n\n1145\n00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.760\na few minutes because it takes a few\nminutes to actually just instantiate\n\n1146\n00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:33.010\nthe reporting site role and\nmake sure that all the reports are loaded.\n\n1147\n00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.600\nAnd then once that's all up and running,\n\n1148\n00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.490\nwe go into the monitoring workspace\nwhere we are in your queries in there.\n\n1149\n00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:38.360\nAnd we go to reporting,\n\n1150\n00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.400\nwe actually see all the reports show up,\nand then we can start to run reports.\n\n1151\n00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.780\nSo we're gonna take a look at that step by\nstep process, kinda walk you through that.\n\n1152\n00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:49.790\nSo what we're gonna do first is\ngonna minimize our console here.\n\n1153\n00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:57.578\nAnd what we're gonna do is bring up our\nReporting Services Configuration Manager.\n\n1154\n00:57:57.578 --> 00:58:02.800\nAnd you could see here SQL Server 12,\nReporting Services Configuration Manager.\n\n1155\n00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:08.430\nNow we've run the Reporting Service\nConfiguration routine outside and\n\n1156\n00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:09.690\ndone that ahead of time.\n\n1157\n00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:12.890\nThis is not an SCCM thing,\nthis is a SQL thing.\n\n1158\n00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:17.640\nSo we can Reporting Services on SQL\nto drive a variety of activities.\n\n1159\n00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.960\nWe happen to leverage with SCCM,\nso we're gonna wanna use it.\n\n1160\n00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.220\nBut you need to either know\nhow to set this up and SQL or\n\n1161\n00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.160\nget a DBA, a database administrator,\ninvolved that understands SQL so\n\n1162\n00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.790\nthat they can actually do\nthis back end piece for you.\n\n1163\n00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:35.570\nSo this will be done typically more\noften than not certainly prior to\n\n1164\n00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:39.890\nconfiguring the reporting site role, but\nthis will be done, more often than not in\n\n1165\n00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:44.750\nthe organization, probably at some point\nway before SCCM is installed, because\n\n1166\n00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:47.580\nchances you're gonna be using Reporting\nServices for other things most likely.\n\n1167\n00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.090\nIf you have SharePoint up and running,\nif you have Project Server up and\n\n1168\n00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:54.960\nrunning linked to SharePoint, you're\nprobably using Reporting Services already\n\n1169\n00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.440\non the BI side to drive\na variety of things.\n\n1170\n00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:59.830\nSo chances are good this\nmay already exist, but\n\n1171\n00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:03.480\nthis will be done through the SQL Server\nmedia, and the installation of one of\n\n1172\n00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:08.190\nthe SQL Server supporting services,\nseparate from SCCM, okay?\n\n1173\n00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:09.070\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1174\n00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:12.020\nSo we're gonna go in there and\nwe're gonna open this up.\n\n1175\n00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:18.264\nNow all I did to get to this, by the way,\nwas simply go to the workspace,\n\n1176\n00:59:18.264 --> 00:59:23.158\nthe start up page in the server,\nand I just went ahead and\n\n1177\n00:59:23.158 --> 00:59:28.991\nI used the Search feature and\nI started typing in, sql reporting,\n\n1178\n00:59:28.991 --> 00:59:33.821\nand I start to do that,\nwe should actually type in SQL.\n\n1179\n00:59:37.508 --> 00:59:40.864\nOr actually just type in reporting,\njust type in reporting.\n\n1180\n00:59:40.864 --> 00:59:45.686\nNow when I do that you'll see Reporting\nServices Configuration Manager is\n\n1181\n00:59:45.686 --> 00:59:46.842\ngoing to show up.\n\n1182\n00:59:46.842 --> 00:59:50.584\nAnd so that's what I did, I just basically\nwhen there and searched for it, so\n\n1183\n00:59:50.584 --> 00:59:53.640\nI could find that little link to\nthe interface and bring it up.\n\n1184\n00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.710\nThat's all I did, right?\n\n1185\n00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:59.000\nThis is in Server 12 by the way, so we\nget that Windows 8 look and feel, right?\n\n1186\n00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.350\nBut we could just go in and do that\nvery simply, so just be aware of that.\n\n1187\n01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.310\nThere we go.\nAnd so then I opened it up,\n\n1188\n01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:06.850\nI just basically fired it off, and\n\n1189\n01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:09.860\nthere's a couple of things that I would\nwanna come in and take a look at in here.\n\n1190\n01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.140\nFirst thing is, I'd wanna be able\nto go through the service account.\n\n1191\n01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.190\nSo you could see on the screen here,\nwe have the server itself,\n\n1192\n01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:19.730\nService Account,\nWeb Service URL, and Database.\n\n1193\n01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.630\nThose three we're gonna take a look at.\n\n1194\n01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:25.640\nBut we also have the Report Manager URL,\nwhich is the website that we're gonna be\n\n1195\n01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.900\nable to go to that's gonna show us\nthe reporting interface for configuration,\n\n1196\n01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:29.880\nso we'll see that.\n\n1197\n01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.384\nWe have the E-mail Settings, we have\nExecution Account, Encryption Keys, and\n\n1198\n01:00:33.384 --> 01:00:34.770\nScale-out Deployment areas.\n\n1199\n01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:38.460\nWe're not gonna be as concerned with some\nof these as we are with the first ones.\n\n1200\n01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:42.230\nSo with regards to Service Account,\nwhat we're gonna see is,\n\n1201\n01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:45.158\nwe do have a service\naccount that is configured.\n\n1202\n01:00:47.804 --> 01:00:54.180\nAnd we are gonna use a specific account,\nin this case the Administrator account.\n\n1203\n01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:57.110\nProvide that password for the domain,\nso we're gonna set that up.\n\n1204\n01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:00.100\nNow, let's talk about best\npractices here for just a minute,\n\n1205\n01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.725\nversus what we do in lab environments for\nease of use purposes, [LAUGH] right?\n\n1206\n01:01:04.725 --> 01:01:08.590\nBecause when you spend four or five hours\nbuilding up this infrastructure and\n\n1207\n01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.670\ngetting it all up and running,\nwe typically don't create all the service\n\n1208\n01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:14.920\naccounts that we would use in\nthe real world to differentiate and\n\n1209\n01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.360\nto segment out function and follow\nthe best practice principles of least\n\n1210\n01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.155\nprivilege, and delegate a responsibility,\nseparation of duties, all that.\n\n1211\n01:01:23.155 --> 01:01:26.610\nWe tend to use the admin account\nbecause it works for everything.\n\n1212\n01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:30.100\nWe do one install, we use use one account,\nwe build everything out one time.\n\n1213\n01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:34.880\nIn the real world, you would not, would\nnot, let me be clear, want to use your\n\n1214\n01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.390\ndomain admin account as the account\nthat drives the back end on all this.\n\n1215\n01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:42.170\nNumber one, from security\nliability that's a bad thing, if\n\n1216\n01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:45.960\nthat account is compromised then in affect\nsomebody gets the rights to everything.\n\n1217\n01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.690\nNumber two, if you ever change\nthat password or go in and\n\n1218\n01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:55.020\nhave to modify for some reason, you then\nhave to go back and find every instance of\n\n1219\n01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:59.950\nit on every configuration screen and\nchange it or everything stops working.\n\n1220\n01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.310\nSo that's gonna also be an issue for\nyou, [LAUGH] right?\n\n1221\n01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:05.440\nThe good news is that account cannot be\nlocked out, but the bad news is you may\n\n1222\n01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.760\nhave to change your password if it's\ncompromised, so just be aware of that.\n\n1223\n01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.540\nWe recommend that you create service\naccounts that have delegated\n\n1224\n01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.350\nrights to do these things, and\nuse those service accounts.\n\n1225\n01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:17.730\nThat guidance is in the best\npractice documentation,\n\n1226\n01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:21.080\nthe deployment how-to guides we've\ntalked about on the TechNet sites that\n\n1227\n01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.370\nwe've taken you out to in\nprior episodes and showed you.\n\n1228\n01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:27.640\nYou wanna go reference those and use\nthose best practices and those guidance\n\n1229\n01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.640\npointers about how many accounts we need,\nwhat rights they should have, etc.\n\n1230\n01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.135\nAnd there's a laundry list of accounts,\nso you should be creative.\n\n1231\n01:02:33.135 --> 01:02:37.260\nSQL should be installed using certain\naccounts with certain rights,\n\n1232\n01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:40.080\nthen you have to configure a SCCM,\nand you have to do all the stuff.\n\n1233\n01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.480\nThat should be done according to\nthe guidance that is provided out there,\n\n1234\n01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.810\nso make sure you follow that, understand\nin other words as we're pointing out here,\n\n1235\n01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:51.070\nthat while you may see us do it here for\nsake of ease of use, we make it clear that\n\n1236\n01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:55.330\nthis is not the recommended best practice,\nand the reason why is primarily security.\n\n1237\n01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:56.732\nJust so you understand, okay?\n\n1238\n01:02:56.732 --> 01:02:58.860\nAll right, so having said that\nwe have our account there.\n\n1239\n01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:04.025\nThis customer service announcement brought\nto you by the better computing and\n\n1240\n01:03:04.025 --> 01:03:04.975\nsecurity bureau.\n\n1241\n01:03:04.975 --> 01:03:09.805\nAll right, so what we see here\non the Web Service URL screen\n\n1242\n01:03:09.805 --> 01:03:13.947\nis we see the IP Address settings,\nthe TCP The Port settings,\n\n1243\n01:03:13.947 --> 01:03:18.727\nSSL settings if we are using them, we\ncould add out certificates in if need be,\n\n1244\n01:03:18.727 --> 01:03:22.037\nwe also have our, oh whoops,\none more second, let me scroll in there.\n\n1245\n01:03:22.037 --> 01:03:26.967\nWe also have our Report Server Web Service\nURL, that's gonna be that one right there.\n\n1246\n01:03:26.967 --> 01:03:30.777\nIt's always gonna be the name\nof the machine:80/ReportServer.\n\n1247\n01:03:30.777 --> 01:03:35.799\nNow if you are preparing for the exam and\nyou would want to be successful\n\n1248\n01:03:35.799 --> 01:03:41.180\nI would assume, cuz most of us prefer\nto do things one time and get it right.\n\n1249\n01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:45.468\nI'm wilting again or I'm listing again,\nI think we have a ten degree left or\n\n1250\n01:03:45.468 --> 01:03:48.421\nstarboard list going on in\nthe studio this morning.\n\n1251\n01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:52.747\nSo, what you'll see there is the report\nservice or report webservice URL,\n\n1252\n01:03:52.747 --> 01:03:54.790\nyou see the URL is listed there.\n\n1253\n01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:58.800\nYou want to make sure that you understand\ngenerically what that URL will be,\n\n1254\n01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.260\nbe important for you to know that\nif you're ever asked about it.\n\n1255\n01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.490\nSo it's always going to be\nwhatever the machine name is,\n\n1256\n01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:05.320\nyou don't necessarily know\nwhat the machine name is.\n\n1257\n01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.770\nIf you're asked about it, either they\nprovide it to you or you're told,\n\n1258\n01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:12.100\nwell, that's what it is, so\nyou assume, okay, that's what it is.\n\n1259\n01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:16.160\nBut what you really need to focus\non is :port80/report Server\n\n1260\n01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.540\nto make sure you know that's\nthe format that it takes.\n\n1261\n01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:19.520\nSo, make sure you're aware of that.\n\n1262\n01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.790\nYou can see that there.\n\n1263\n01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:25.370\nSo, if we were to click on that for\njust a second to take a look at it.\n\n1264\n01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:27.960\nWe would see that we get a list of\n\n1265\n01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.010\njust all the files that are sitting\nin the report directory and\n\n1266\n01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:34.330\nthat's what wee would expect\nto see on this particular URL.\n\n1267\n01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:34.880\nRight?\n\n1268\n01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.920\nSo we can see that there.\n\n1269\n01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.180\nAnd then so we know it's working\nin other words so that's good and\n\n1270\n01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.690\nthen if we go the data base,\n\n1271\n01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:47.100\nwe will see some information about\nthe data base we can see that.\n\n1272\n01:04:49.715 --> 01:04:50.875\nThat database is set up.\n\n1273\n01:04:50.875 --> 01:04:51.945\nWe have the name there.\n\n1274\n01:04:51.945 --> 01:04:53.835\nIt should say Report Server Mode Native.\n\n1275\n01:04:53.835 --> 01:04:55.715\nSo we do see Native, which is fine.\n\n1276\n01:04:55.715 --> 01:04:58.045\nWe can change the database if we need to.\n\n1277\n01:04:58.045 --> 01:05:01.825\nWe also have the credentials that are\nused, again, the domain admin account is\n\n1278\n01:05:01.825 --> 01:05:04.925\nthere, to be able to get in and\naccess the report server database.\n\n1279\n01:05:04.925 --> 01:05:07.235\nWe're not gonna mess with those,\nbut we could obviously go in and\n\n1280\n01:05:07.235 --> 01:05:09.080\nchange those if we needed to.\n\n1281\n01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.560\nWe do have a report manager URL.\n\n1282\n01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.920\nThis report manager URL is different\nthan the one we just looked at.\n\n1283\n01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.950\nThis is another one.\n\n1284\n01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:18.687\nThis one is machine name\ncolon port 80 reports, so\n\n1285\n01:05:18.687 --> 01:05:22.105\nwe want to make sure we know that,\nand then obviously if we go in and\n\n1286\n01:05:22.105 --> 01:05:30.240\nwe take a look at this one,\nGive that a second, we will see and\n\n1287\n01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:35.520\nwe'll take a minute the first time we go\nto it does take a moment or so to load up.\n\n1288\n01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.800\nWe'll be able to get the interface here\nand be able to see some information.\n\n1289\n01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.500\nThere we go.\n\n1290\n01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:44.120\nWe'll be able to get the SQL reporting\nserver interface and we will see\n\n1291\n01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:48.430\ncategorical listings by folder,\nof all the different report categories.\n\n1292\n01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:51.130\nWe then can go in and\nwe could see what they are and so\n\n1293\n01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:55.110\nwe can see all of them here and you know\nwe just have all these different ones.\n\n1294\n01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:58.830\nAnd you'll see\nSystem Network Management Reports,\n\n1295\n01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:02.060\nMicrosoft Windows Internet\nInformation Server, etc.\n\n1296\n01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:05.440\nSo we could delve in and\nsee one or more of these.\n\n1297\n01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.150\nWe could go in and\ncreate new data sources.\n\n1298\n01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:13.050\nWe can go in and do report builder,\nfolder settings, upload, etc.\n\n1299\n01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:15.440\nThis is the back end on\nthe reporting interface.\n\n1300\n01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.470\nThis is not where we manage and\ninteract with the SECM reports.\n\n1301\n01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:22.360\nThis is just where they're\nstored in the SQL database.\n\n1302\n01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.910\nAnd then the interface we have to interact\nwith them if we go behind the scenes.\n\n1303\n01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:27.520\nWhat we're gonna do is build out\n\n1304\n01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.820\nthe SSCM Site Server Reporting\nService Point Site role.\n\n1305\n01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.640\nWe're gonna put that in.\n\n1306\n01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.350\nThen we're gonna have\naccess in the console\n\n1307\n01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:39.340\nto the reports through the SSCM console\nand that's how we're gonna manage it.\n\n1308\n01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.600\nWe're gonna take a look at\nthat as our next step here.\n\n1309\n01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.810\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna just close this out.\n\n1310\n01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:46.120\nAnd just go down here and get rid of that.\n\n1311\n01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.230\nSo all of the background\nstuff that we actually need\n\n1312\n01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:51.230\nis sitting in here ready to go.\n\n1313\n01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:54.798\nSo that's the piece we just configured for\nyou ahead of time and\n\n1314\n01:06:54.798 --> 01:06:59.254\nwhen it did that we gonna spend 20\nminutes waiting on installation to occur.\n\n1315\n01:06:59.254 --> 01:07:04.156\nSo what we're gonna do now is coming to\nthe SCCM console were to come down to\n\n1316\n01:07:04.156 --> 01:07:06.386\nthe administration workspace.\n\n1317\n01:07:06.386 --> 01:07:09.867\nAnd I'll actually you know what let\nme just go in here real quick and\n\n1318\n01:07:09.867 --> 01:07:13.050\nshow you that although we have\na reporting folder right now.\n\n1319\n01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:15.780\nAnd so let's just zoom in real\nquick you'll see we do have\n\n1320\n01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.740\nreporting right there and reports.\n\n1321\n01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:21.950\nWhen we click on that right\nnow what you will see is that\n\n1322\n01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:26.810\nthere are no items found in that\nreporting directory right now.\n\n1323\n01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:29.810\nYou can see I'm on reports there and\nthere are no items.\n\n1324\n01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:30.640\nSo right now,\n\n1325\n01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:34.460\nalthough we have the structure there,\nwe don't actually have it set up yet.\n\n1326\n01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.840\nSo we're gonna now go ahead and\nset that up.\n\n1327\n01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.180\nSo we're gonna go to administration.\n\n1328\n01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:42.980\nWe're gonna come into the Servers and\n\n1329\n01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.560\nSite System Roles,\nright there up under Site Configuration.\n\n1330\n01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.940\nWe've got our Site Server there, we've got\nour existing Site System Roles right there\n\n1331\n01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:55.640\nand you could see that on our\nexisting Site System Roles that\n\n1332\n01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:00.470\nwhat we have the Component server, the\nDistribution point, the Management point.\n\n1333\n01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:02.640\nThe host side database server etc.\n\n1334\n01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.570\nYou'll notice that we do not see\na reporting point role there.\n\n1335\n01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:10.470\nAnd so, what we're going to do\nis we're going to install it.\n\n1336\n01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:13.930\nLet me be forceful and\nspeak without a high falsetto there.\n\n1337\n01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:14.840\nSo we're going to install it.\n\n1338\n01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:21.860\nSo what we're going to do is right-click\nup on the site server right there.\n\n1339\n01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.470\nAnd we're gonna add site system roles.\n\n1340\n01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:26.530\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nlaunch this Wizard.\n\n1341\n01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:27.490\nGive that just a second.\n\n1342\n01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:34.400\nAnd it will take a moment to come up.\n\n1343\n01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.940\nIt will load, it just takes a moment\nto go out and to get itself organized.\n\n1344\n01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.200\nIt's coming up right now.\n\n1345\n01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.460\nIt's on the general screen,\n\n1346\n01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:45.680\nwe just have the name of our site server,\nwe have our site code, we have whether or\n\n1347\n01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.650\nnot we want to use the computer\naccount to do the install.\n\n1348\n01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:50.560\nSo we're going to just\nleave all that in place.\n\n1349\n01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.620\nI'll just give you a quick glance\nat that so you can see that,\n\n1350\n01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.855\nbut there's really not a lot\nof exciting stuff there.\n\n1351\n01:08:56.855 --> 01:08:58.565\nNo changes need to be made in other words.\n\n1352\n01:08:58.565 --> 01:09:03.205\nWe're gonna click Next and what we're\ngonna do is go past the proxy screen.\n\n1353\n01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:06.695\nSo we're gonna give that a second to\nload up and go through the proxy.\n\n1354\n01:09:06.695 --> 01:09:09.555\nWe don't really care about the proxy\nscreen either because we're not using\n\n1355\n01:09:09.555 --> 01:09:11.755\na proxy so it's really irrelevant to us.\n\n1356\n01:09:11.755 --> 01:09:13.935\nWhat we're gonna do is go\nto System Role Selection.\n\n1357\n01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.440\nAnd the System Roll selection is where\nwe're gonna make a choice about what\n\n1358\n01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.100\nSystem Roll we wanna install, in this case\nwe'll be installing the reporting points.\n\n1359\n01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:27.420\nSo we're gonna give that a moment just to\nget to the System Roll selection screen\n\n1360\n01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.980\nand as soon as that comes up,\nthere it is, we're gonna go ahead.\n\n1361\n01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:35.770\nAnd I will just go ahead and select it And\nkinda point to it and zoom in so\n\n1362\n01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:36.760\nyou can see it.\n\n1363\n01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.980\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nchoose reporting services point.\n\n1364\n01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.540\nSo we're gonna go ahead and install that.\n\n1365\n01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:49.400\nNow, we do have a configuration screen\nthat comes up next so we'll click next.\n\n1366\n01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.850\nAnd we'll see what we have a couple of\nthings that we're gonna be asked about,\n\n1367\n01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:53.800\nreally minimal.\n\n1368\n01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.380\nWe just wanna know what's there.\n\n1369\n01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:59.280\nSo we'll see that we do have\nthe site database server names.\n\n1370\n01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.230\nWe have to know what that is.\n\n1371\n01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:02.090\nWe do have that already.\n\n1372\n01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:07.500\nWe do have the site database server name\nalong with the database name itself.\n\n1373\n01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.040\nWe can verify that.\n\n1374\n01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.980\nAnd then you'll se we have\nthe folder that we're gonna create\n\n1375\n01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:16.720\nto actually store all that information,\nReporting Services server instance,\n\n1376\n01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.710\nthe name there,\na username if we have to provide that.\n\n1377\n01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:22.760\nSo we're gonna have all that, and\nwe're gonna set up the username.\n\n1378\n01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:28.020\nSo we're gonna verify that first,\nclick on Verify, and it does come back,\n\n1379\n01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.880\nand it does say successfully verified\nthere, grayed out so that's good.\n\n1380\n01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.000\nThat means that we do have\nthe right system information,\n\n1381\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.450\nvery important to know that.\n\n1382\n01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:40.500\nAnd then, we have to set a user name here,\nand so what we're going to do\n\n1383\n01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:45.780\nis pull that down and provide a user name,\nthat we are going to set for the access.\n\n1384\n01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.820\nAnd we're going to set here a new account.\n\n1385\n01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.720\nSo let me just grab that and select that.\n\n1386\n01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.270\nWe'll get a little Wizard\nthat pops up there.\n\n1387\n01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:54.650\nWe have provided a user name.\n\n1388\n01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:56.570\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ntype in the administrative or\n\n1389\n01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:59.540\nthe domain admin name like we\ndid on one of the prior demos.\n\n1390\n01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.910\nWe're just gonna go browse for\nthat instead of typing it in.\n\n1391\n01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:04.655\nWe're just gonna type in admin and\na straighter.\n\n1392\n01:11:07.675 --> 01:11:10.075\nAnd we're gonna do a check\nname real quick there.\n\n1393\n01:11:10.075 --> 01:11:11.895\nGet that up, hit Okay.\n\n1394\n01:11:11.895 --> 01:11:12.595\nHave that command.\n\n1395\n01:11:12.595 --> 01:11:16.915\nWe have to type in the password,\nthat is the word password, lower case.\n\n1396\n01:11:16.915 --> 01:11:21.095\nOkay, I'm swearing all of you out there\nforevermore and through eternity,\n\n1397\n01:11:21.095 --> 01:11:22.120\nsecrecy on that one.\n\n1398\n01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.815\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so we're gonna click Okay.\n\n1399\n01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:26.390\nType that in.\n\n1400\n01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:27.090\nYou actually know what?\n\n1401\n01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:29.170\nShoot.\nI put in the wrong password.\n\n1402\n01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:32.339\nOne second, let me go fix that.\n\n1403\n01:11:36.551 --> 01:11:40.004\nAnd by the way, this brings up\nan excellent point, which let me show you.\n\n1404\n01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:42.462\nThrough my mistake you\nwill learn something.\n\n1405\n01:11:42.462 --> 01:11:43.462\nSo, since I entered,\n\n1406\n01:11:43.462 --> 01:11:47.060\nI just realized now based on my note that\nI put in the wrong password cuz I didn't.\n\n1407\n01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:53.650\nPut a O instead of a 0 because we're\nusing a different password for this one.\n\n1408\n01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:56.050\nSo if you have to edit the password and\n\n1409\n01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:58.020\nyou may have to if you\nrealize you made a mistake.\n\n1410\n01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.190\nYou'll see that I bring\nback up that screen\n\n1411\n01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:04.540\nsimply by going back to the set arrow,\nchoosing new account.\n\n1412\n01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.820\nPeople often get mistaken and so\n\n1413\n01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:08.377\nlet me choose an existing\none cuz I just created it.\n\n1414\n01:12:08.377 --> 01:12:11.920\nNo, [LAUGH] choose the new option because\nit's the account that you're editing and\n\n1415\n01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.990\nadding in, that's gonna come back up\nbecause it has not been created yet.\n\n1416\n01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:16.400\nYou're still in the wizard.\n\n1417\n01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.310\nSo if you need to bring\nthat back up in this screen\n\n1418\n01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:22.270\nyou'll have to do Set > New and\nthen it brings back up the account\n\n1419\n01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:24.280\nthat we're working with which\nyou can see right here.\n\n1420\n01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.480\nAnd I'm gonna go in and\njust change that password out real quick.\n\n1421\n01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.460\nSo just so you know, a little trivia there\nfor you, but obviously important to know.\n\n1422\n01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:33.012\nIt would be nice if they just\nkept the same password for both.\n\n1423\n01:12:33.012 --> 01:12:34.264\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n1424\n01:12:34.264 --> 01:12:35.310\n>> That would be too easy.\n\n1425\n01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:36.273\n>> That would be too easy.\n\n1426\n01:12:36.273 --> 01:12:37.921\nAll right, so let's go here.\n\n1427\n01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:40.880\n>> Another thing is,\nit doesn't check the account and\n\n1428\n01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.180\npassword at this point in the And\nthe wizard either.\n\n1429\n01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.860\n>> No you'll find out you have an error\nwhen you go to actually configure it and\n\n1430\n01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.850\nit says oh by the way, guess what?\n\n1431\n01:12:48.850 --> 01:12:49.780\nStart over.\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n1432\n01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.180\n>> So no it doesn't check that.\n\n1433\n01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:51.720\nThat would be nice.\n\n1434\n01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.370\nAll right so let me just make\nsure I typed it in the right way.\n\n1435\n01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:57.740\nLooks like we got the right one there and\nclick OK.\n\n1436\n01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.130\nAll right, so now we do have that.\n\n1437\n01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.000\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do that,\ngive that a second.\n\n1438\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.990\nAll right and then we're gonna go ahead\nand we're gonna click Next there.\n\n1439\n01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:06.500\nAnd we'll just get\na little summary screen.\n\n1440\n01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.010\nWe don't, again, have anything to\ndo there other than just read and\n\n1441\n01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:10.660\nmake sure we know that that's going on.\n\n1442\n01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.900\nWe'll click Next, we got progress.\n\n1443\n01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.610\nGive that a second or two to configure.\n\n1444\n01:13:15.610 --> 01:13:18.460\nDoesn't take very long to do\nthe initial setup there, but\n\n1445\n01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:21.160\nthen of course it takes a little bit for\nthe reports to populate.\n\n1446\n01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.160\nSo we are gonna wait for\nthat and see that happening.\n\n1447\n01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.410\nAnd then we're gonna\ntake a look at reports.\n\n1448\n01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:28.125\nWe're gonna take a look\nat that in just a second.\n\n1449\n01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:32.470\nBut what we're gonna do in the meantime\njust while that's cooking,\n\n1450\n01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:34.490\nis we're gonna go back\nover to Mike's machine.\n\n1451\n01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:37.450\nI have a couple of lists,\nwe put together some handy or\n\n1452\n01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:41.130\na handy list I should say, of just\nthe steps involved that we just took here\n\n1453\n01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:43.110\nto configure the reporting services point.\n\n1454\n01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:44.460\nSo we just go ahead and\ntake a look at that,\n\n1455\n01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:46.260\nthat we have a sense of what we just did.\n\n1456\n01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:49.350\nWe have a little summary there while we're\nwaiting on this thing to finish working.\n\n1457\n01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:52.840\nAnd then we'll go back in,\nwe'll take a look at the finished product.\n\n1458\n01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.640\nSo what we did is we install SQL server\nwith the reporting services components.\n\n1459\n01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.800\nAs I said,\nwe went through that ahead of time.\n\n1460\n01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.460\nThat's going to be done,\ntypically, by a DBA and or\n\n1461\n01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.160\nsomebody who has a little bit of\nknowledge of how to configure SQL.\n\n1462\n01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.870\nNow if you are a person,\nwho, unfortunately,\n\n1463\n01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:09.990\nin your organization may not have\naccess to those additional resources.\n\n1464\n01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:12.020\nIn other words,\nif it's really just you and or\n\n1465\n01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:16.960\nyou and a few other IT professionals but\nmaybe nobody really is up on SQL and\n\n1466\n01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.520\nknows it well enough to do this.\n\n1467\n01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.450\nAre you stuck?\n\n1468\n01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:23.100\nWell maybe, but the reality is probably\nnot, because it's not that hard\n\n1469\n01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.330\nto go out and find out about how to\nset up and install reporting services.\n\n1470\n01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:28.790\nYou're just going to have to go out and\nGoogle for it and see whether or\n\n1471\n01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:30.570\nnot you can find a little how-to.\n\n1472\n01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:33.650\nCan we go to Google real quick and\njust see what that'll look like?\n\n1473\n01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:39.710\nSQL reporting services 2012 so,\nSQL reporting services 2012.\n\n1474\n01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:43.671\nNow, remember before you hit Enter or\nhit Enter, no big deal.\n\n1475\n01:14:43.671 --> 01:14:46.260\nJust remember that we're not querying for\n\n1476\n01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:50.430\nhow to set it up in SCCM, we're querying\nsimply how to install it, right.\n\n1477\n01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:53.860\nSo, we put SQL 2012 out\nthere because again,\n\n1478\n01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.130\nwe want the right focus\non the right product.\n\n1479\n01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:59.110\nBut it's not SCCM in this case so\njust be aware of that.\n\n1480\n01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:02.365\nSo what do we see there if you can\nzoom in or tell me what you got there.\n\n1481\n01:15:02.365 --> 01:15:05.400\nReporting services, tutorial for\nMicrosoft, so great,\n\n1482\n01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.270\nprobably want to click on that and\nmaybe see what that one looks like.\n\n1483\n01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:12.312\nAnd chances are good that will\nprobably give us a nice little how-to,\n\n1484\n01:15:12.312 --> 01:15:13.282\nI'm guessing.\n\n1485\n01:15:13.282 --> 01:15:17.743\nAnd it may even walk us through the little\nlinks that are probably, hey do this,\n\n1486\n01:15:17.743 --> 01:15:20.980\ndo that, this is what you set up,\nthis is how it works.\n\n1487\n01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:23.830\nSo it's probably a great one to start\nthinking about and to be able to use.\n\n1488\n01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:27.530\nBecause what that will do is to give\nus the ability to drive through and\n\n1489\n01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:31.230\nto be able to figure out exactly what it\nis step by step that we would need to do.\n\n1490\n01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:32.750\nSo if that's us, and\n\n1491\n01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:36.430\nwe're not real comfortable with it, just\na simple query out at Google like that\n\n1492\n01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:39.540\nwould then be able to probably get you the\ninformation you need more often than not.\n\n1493\n01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:44.800\nSo we have that, we install the default\ninstance or a named instance to SQL.\n\n1494\n01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.970\nYou saw, as we went through,\nthat we had already set that up.\n\n1495\n01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:50.050\nWe had our SQL server,\nwe configured what it was.\n\n1496\n01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:52.600\nWe would have to know that of course and\nunderstand what that is.\n\n1497\n01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.890\nBut we would set all that up ahead\nof time or work with the DBA and\n\n1498\n01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:56.880\nget that from them.\n\n1499\n01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.080\nWe then connect to SQL Reporting Services\nusing the server name,\n\n1500\n01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.740\nthe reports server instance.\n\n1501\n01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:03.950\nWe configure that information.\n\n1502\n01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:07.890\nYou saw me on the configuration\npage before we went into SCCM\n\n1503\n01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:10.450\nto install the site reporting point.\n\n1504\n01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:11.850\nThat we have the service account,\n\n1505\n01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:14.960\nthe web service URL, the database,\nthe report managed URL.\n\n1506\n01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.726\nAll that was there,\nyou would configure all those.\n\n1507\n01:16:16.726 --> 01:16:21.848\nAnd I think that the step by step tutorial\nyou brought up in MSDN probably had links,\n\n1508\n01:16:21.848 --> 01:16:23.105\nI didn't see them.\n\n1509\n01:16:23.105 --> 01:16:26.414\nBut I'm sure probably some of those\nhow to links one by one would give you\n\n1510\n01:16:26.414 --> 01:16:29.220\nthe instance information for\neach one of those areas.\n\n1511\n01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:30.310\nYou'd want to take a look at that.\n\n1512\n01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:31.490\nAll right, very good.\n\n1513\n01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:32.580\nSo, we have all that.\n\n1514\n01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:36.870\nIf we come back into my machine and\nwe take a look at my screen.\n\n1515\n01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:41.700\nWhat we're gonna see is that we now have\nour, I'm just gonna highlight it just so\n\n1516\n01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.650\nwe could see it.\n\n1517\n01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:45.650\nWe're gonna now have our\nreporting point set up.\n\n1518\n01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:50.279\nOr at least the beginning of\nit anyway is gonna be there.\n\n1519\n01:16:50.279 --> 01:16:56.710\nAnd so what we're gonna do\nis come back over here and\n\n1520\n01:16:56.710 --> 01:17:03.456\nlet's just go in and\ntake a quick look at monitoring.\n\n1521\n01:17:03.456 --> 01:17:05.700\nNow we'll wait for it to turn up.\n\n1522\n01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:09.110\nNow what you're gonna see, and\nwe very well may not see reports here for\n\n1523\n01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:11.390\na minute or two,\nit's still gonna come up empty.\n\n1524\n01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:14.570\nThe reporting services point is still\nbeing configured behind the scenes.\n\n1525\n01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:15.310\nSo in other words,\n\n1526\n01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:19.300\nwhat we're doing now is writing to that\nwebsite we saw where all the folders were.\n\n1527\n01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.350\nAnd we're actually now gonna be able to,\nprobably within about three or\n\n1528\n01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:25.870\nfour minutes, usually takes about that\nlong to start seeing reports show up.\n\n1529\n01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:27.730\nWe're gonna start seeing stuff, but\n\n1530\n01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:31.700\nthere still is a time lag here while\nthe system is actually still configuring.\n\n1531\n01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:36.140\nWhat we basically just accomplished was\nsetting up the actual site role, but\n\n1532\n01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.580\nthe reports themselves do take\na little bit of time to populate.\n\n1533\n01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:41.960\nSo I just want you to be aware of that and\nunderstand that as we're looking here.\n\n1534\n01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.090\nBut we'll see the site system role and\nI'm just gonna scroll that and\n\n1535\n01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:46.270\nwait for that to populate.\n\n1536\n01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:50.407\nWe'll see the site system role is now here\nand I'll highlight it so you can see it.\n\n1537\n01:17:50.407 --> 01:17:54.076\nAnd we'll zoom in just so you could\nsee that down there on the bottom.\n\n1538\n01:17:57.537 --> 01:18:01.370\nThat we now see a reporting services\npoint has been installed, right?\n\n1539\n01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:04.560\n>> All right.\n>> So we do have our site role there and\n\n1540\n01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.430\nwe can go to it depending on what it is.\n\n1541\n01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:09.320\nAnd we can look at properties of it so\n\n1542\n01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.790\nwe do have the ability to see properties\non anyone of these by right-clicking.\n\n1543\n01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:17.170\nAnd we can go into properties and\ndepending on the site role,\n\n1544\n01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:20.450\nthere may be configurable items,\nthere may not be, it really just depends.\n\n1545\n01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:24.421\nWhat we really see here, and there\nisn't really much we're gonna get here,\n\n1546\n01:18:24.421 --> 01:18:27.550\nis just the same screen we saw\nwhen we were doing the install.\n\n1547\n01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:29.255\nWhat's the site database server name?\n\n1548\n01:18:29.255 --> 01:18:30.845\nWhat's the database name?\n\n1549\n01:18:30.845 --> 01:18:32.825\nWhat's the folder information?\n\n1550\n01:18:32.825 --> 01:18:34.775\nWhat is the user credential\nthat we are using?\n\n1551\n01:18:34.775 --> 01:18:37.985\nThat's we are see here right and if we\nwant to make a change to it in some point\n\n1552\n01:18:37.985 --> 01:18:41.517\nfor some reason terms of the credential,\nwe'd have to come in here and find that\n\n1553\n01:18:41.517 --> 01:18:47.157\ncredential and then reset it using the Set\nbutton which is gonna be right down here.\n\n1554\n01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.477\nRight, we can see that right there.\n\n1555\n01:18:48.477 --> 01:18:51.847\nNow we would go in be able to modify that\nif we had to change a password again or\n\n1556\n01:18:51.847 --> 01:18:53.597\nsomething like that\nonce it's been created.\n\n1557\n01:18:53.597 --> 01:18:55.627\nSo, just wanna make sure\nwe're familiar with that.\n\n1558\n01:18:55.627 --> 01:19:00.430\nAnd then,\nwhen we do get over the monitoring again,\n\n1559\n01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:04.270\nit may take a few minutes, we're not\nseeing anything yet in the reporting area.\n\n1560\n01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:07.218\nIt may take a few minutes for\nreports to actually show up.\n\n1561\n01:19:07.218 --> 01:19:08.680\nBut what we'll do in the meantime,\n\n1562\n01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.650\nis go in and\njust take a look at creating a report.\n\n1563\n01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:15.610\nYou can see we can create custom reports\nthere as well as opening up existing\n\n1564\n01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:16.440\nreports.\n\n1565\n01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.710\nAnd so if we wanna create a report,\njust to show you what this looks like.\n\n1566\n01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:21.510\nWe have a little wizard here.\n\n1567\n01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:28.840\nAnd we can go in and\nwe can do either a Model-based Report,\n\n1568\n01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:32.960\na report based on a reporting services\nmodel, and or SQL-based Report.\n\n1569\n01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.680\nCreate a traditional SQL report based\ndirectly off the database information and\n\n1570\n01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.830\nusing stored procedures.\n\n1571\n01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:42.860\nSo we have a couple options, again,\nyour reporting is kinda like querying.\n\n1572\n01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:45.280\nYou need to specialize it,\nit's really understanded.\n\n1573\n01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.800\nIt involves knowledge of\na SQL reporting services.\n\n1574\n01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:52.604\nAnd SQL and transact SQL, right,\nwhich is the query language which, for\n\n1575\n01:19:52.604 --> 01:19:53.620\nSQR to trend v.\n\n1576\n01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:58.593\nQuery language specific to Microsoft's SQL\ndatabase, what's called T-SQL or\n\n1577\n01:19:58.593 --> 01:19:59.690\nTransact-SQL.\n\n1578\n01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:02.980\nAnd if you're not familiar with it,\nyou probably don't wanna go in here and\n\n1579\n01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.100\nstart tinkering around trying\nto build reports on your own.\n\n1580\n01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.560\nYou're probably gonna wanna\nget some help from a DBA or\n\n1581\n01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.590\na business analyst who knows how to do\nreporting and querying in Microsoft SQL.\n\n1582\n01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:15.660\nSo just be aware of that because\nthis is a whole other language.\n\n1583\n01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.458\nThis is not WQL.\n\n1584\n01:20:17.458 --> 01:20:20.090\nThis is T-SQL, all right, so\nthere will be a separate language for\n\n1585\n01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:21.290\nusing so, be aware of that.\n\n1586\n01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:25.680\nBut if we do a model base report\nand/or a SQL base report,\n\n1587\n01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.730\nwe can chose here and\nmake a choice just to which one we want.\n\n1588\n01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:31.407\nWe have to specify a type,\nand based on that,\n\n1589\n01:20:31.407 --> 01:20:36.203\nwe then are gonna be able to be offered\nsome options in terms of what we're doing.\n\n1590\n01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.578\nOkay, yeah.\nIt still has now,\n\n1591\n01:20:41.578 --> 01:20:42.520\nlet me just show you here.\n\n1592\n01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.290\nI was hoping we would be far enough\nalong in the install that it would\n\n1593\n01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:48.160\nnot give me the error yet, but\nwhat we're seeing is, it says hey,\n\n1594\n01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.250\nat least one report category must\nexist before a report can be created.\n\n1595\n01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:53.440\nWhich means it's still\nbuilding out the listing and\n\n1596\n01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.090\nthe categories on the back end.\n\n1597\n01:20:55.090 --> 01:20:56.840\nHasn't finished populating yet.\n\n1598\n01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.940\nI was just hoping we would have at\nleast one in there that we could\n\n1599\n01:20:58.940 --> 01:20:59.770\nmaybe play with.\n\n1600\n01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:00.840\nBut it'll take a few minutes.\n\n1601\n01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.080\nSo that's not a big deal.\n\n1602\n01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:07.032\nWe'll let that just go ahead and do its\njob uninterrupted here if you will, for\n\n1603\n01:21:07.032 --> 01:21:10.798\na few minutes and\nthen at some point we'll get our reports.\n\n1604\n01:21:10.798 --> 01:21:13.430\nAnd when we do,\nwe'll bring them back up and\n\n1605\n01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:16.430\njust quickly show them to\nyou in a future episode.\n\n1606\n01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:19.520\nWe'll just save that and kinda preview\nthat, and say, hey, by the way,\n\n1607\n01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.790\nlook at all the reports that are there,\n\n1608\n01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:23.740\nand you'll be able to just at least\nsee what they look like, okay?\n\n1609\n01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.640\n>> All right, Adam,\nanother great episode there.\n\n1610\n01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.960\nA really good hands-on\nlook at building queries,\n\n1611\n01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.300\nthe language that's used to\nwrite those queries, that WQL.\n\n1612\n01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:38.030\nWe took a look at understanding what were\nworking with those queries that the system\n\n1613\n01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:40.960\nresources, your object, your attributes,\n\n1614\n01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.340\nyou attribute classes and\nthen your attributes.\n\n1615\n01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:46.460\nSo, a great look there cuz really,\nqueries, that's when we start pulling,\n\n1616\n01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:48.510\nwe're gathering all these\ninformation up right?\n\n1617\n01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:51.990\nWe've set up SCCM, we've got our\ncollections, it's going out and\n\n1618\n01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:55.100\ndoing our hardware inventories,\nthe software inventories.\n\n1619\n01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:55.880\nWhy are we doing all that?\n\n1620\n01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:56.840\nSo we can report all right?\n\n1621\n01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.470\nSo we can get information back,\nmake decisions, or\n\n1622\n01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:01.850\nwhatever it is we need to\ndo within our business.\n\n1623\n01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:05.400\nSo good look there and then we got to see\nhow to set up that reporting point so\n\n1624\n01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.060\nwe can start getting that information\nback in a format that we might use\n\n1625\n01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.490\noutside of the console right?\n\n1626\n01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:11.910\nIf we've got to go a meeting or\n\n1627\n01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:17.670\npresent this information to a higher level\nC officer or whatever the case may be, so.\n\n1628\n01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:18.270\nGood look there.\n\n1629\n01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:19.060\nWe're gonna go back and\n\n1630\n01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.420\ntake a look at reporting again once\nthings kinda finish setting up.\n\n1631\n01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.950\nSo, thank you for\nthat Adam, appreciate

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:17.561\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:22.600\nToday, we're doing our SCCM 2012R2\ncontent and specifically in this one,\n\n5\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.493\nwe're gonna be looking at Endpoint\nProtection, just another thing that we can\n\n6\n00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:30.870\nintegrate and\nuse SCCM to control in our environment.\n\n7\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.750\nNow here to help us figure out how\nto do all that, is Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.160\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.710\n>> I'm good, I'm good.\n\n10\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.350\nSo Endpoint Protection, what we often\nthink about when we're thinking about\n\n11\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.050\nEndpoint Protection generically is\nthe idea of safe computing, right?\n\n12\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.240\nWe're thinking about the idea of how we\ncan go through and ultimately scan and\n\n13\n00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.460\nthen remediate our endpoints if\nthere's a problem with them.\n\n14\n00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.000\nWe have this capability of locally\nper desktop, per server now,\n\n15\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.540\nthis is not that this is\ngonna be anything new.\n\n16\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.600\nSo we've had the ability to\nuse either Windows Defender or\n\n17\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.462\nMicrosoft Security Essentials,\nnow we're back to Windows Defender\n\n18\n00:01:04.462 --> 00:01:05.510\nagain in\n>> Yeah.\n\n19\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.320\n>> Windows 10.\nBut whatever that may be and\n\n20\n00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.270\nI guess it's an oldie but a goody and\nit was so good they brought it back.\n\n21\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.710\n>> Right.\n>> So we have that.\n\n22\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.620\nWe also have the ability to be able to use\nthe local version of the Windows firewall.\n\n23\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.830\nThe advanced Windows firewall per machine,\nso it's not as if we don't have\n\n24\n00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.620\nthese capabilities and\nthese protection mechanisms already.\n\n25\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.610\nThe difference is,\nthat we are going to centrally manage and\n\n26\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.850\ncontrol the configuration of them,\nusing the SCCM client and\n\n27\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.660\nthe addition of\nthe Endpoint Protection feature set,\n\n28\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.720\nnow Endpoint Protection requires\na separate license with SCCM 2012.\n\n29\n00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.980\nThis is the old forefront technology\nincase you harken back to those day\n\n30\n00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.970\nwhere Microsoft have this\nentire product line in Market.\n\n31\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.380\nThey've kind of move slowly but\nsurely away from that,\n\n32\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.180\nthey've integrated it into these\nkinds of products within the suite.\n\n33\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.280\nAnd so you're still paying\nto use this feature, so\n\n34\n00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.490\nhere's the interesting thing\nlet's just talk, can we talk?\n\n35\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.420\nLet's talk.\nCan we talk for a minute?\n\n36\n00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.590\nSo let's talk about what you do and\ndon't get here?\n\n37\n00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.450\nWhat you're paying for with a license is\neffectively the idea of being able to\n\n38\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.390\ncentrally manage this\nconfiguration through SCCM.\n\n39\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.690\nSo you have to understand that this is\ngoing to cost you additional money,\n\n40\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.480\ndinero, moolah, as they say generically,\nanywhere you go.\n\n41\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.560\nScratch I believe is also\n\n42\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.410\na technical term-\n>> I think so.\n\n43\n00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.430\n>> You can use for that, right?\n\n44\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.500\nSo whatever that is, a couple of zeros\non the end of that check that we write.\n\n45\n00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.550\nWe're gonna have to licence this.\n\n46\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.480\nNow what we're really\ngetting in return for\n\n47\n00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.240\nthat is just that, the ability to be\nable to effectively centrally manage but\n\n48\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.220\nspecifically through SCCM because\nwe could centrally configure and\n\n49\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.520\nmanage these exact groups of\nsettings by using group policy.\n\n50\n00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.630\nSo we do wanna understand\nthat we can actually control\n\n51\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.070\nthe environmental factors, specifically\nthe configuration of the firewall,\n\n52\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.360\nwhich is one of the things that\nthe Endpoint Protection feature does.\n\n53\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.830\nWe could specify automatic downloading for\nthe anti-malware definitions and\n\n54\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.830\nengine updates.\n\n55\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.240\nThat can be done and can be taken\ncare of as part of Windows update\n\n56\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.210\nwhich can be controlled and scripted and\ncontrolled with group policy.\n\n57\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.990\nSo the idea is that really, we're not\ngetting anything that we don't already\n\n58\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.220\nhave the capability to do somewhere else\nand I just wanna be clear about that.\n\n59\n00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.540\nSo having been asked about this,\nwell is there a lot of value?\n\n60\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.430\nWell there's value in the sense that\nyou can integrate it into the existing\n\n61\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.050\nproduct, you can centrally manage\nwhere everything else already is,\n\n62\n00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.090\nthere's definitely value in that.\n\n63\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.350\nThere's value in the sense that we can\nreport on that, and we can then derive\n\n64\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.440\nsome additional information gathering and\ncentrally coordinate that.\n\n65\n00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.345\nSo there's value there because\nwe do it from one place, but\n\n66\n00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:36.296\nwhat you really have to ask yourself is is\nthat value worth the money you're gonna\n\n67\n00:03:36.296 --> 00:03:37.870\nspend to do the licensing?\n\n68\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.140\nBecause you do have these capabilities\nalready in effect built in\n\n69\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.350\nto your Windows licenses that you've\nalready purchased and bought and\n\n70\n00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.720\nhave consumed to deploy\nyour operating systems.\n\n71\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.120\nYou just have to get smart about\nmanaging with group policy.\n\n72\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.980\nNow if you remember in one of our prior\nepisodes we actually talk to you about\n\n73\n00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.740\ngroup policy I've mentioned this\nwhen we were talking about different\n\n74\n00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.900\ndeployment methods.\n\n75\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.290\nAnd I said hey have you guys seen and\ndo you know or are you\n\n76\n00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.890\naware of the fact that we have group\npolicy reference setting spread sheets.\n\n77\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.430\nAnd Mike and\n\n78\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.100\nI agreed it would be a good idea to\nshow you those, we did put up the url.\n\n79\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.130\nI believe we'll make that available to\nyou and it's probably already available\n\n80\n00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.090\nby the time you're hearing me and\nwatching me do this it will be available.\n\n81\n00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.190\nWithin the notes, or the liner notes or\n\n82\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.530\nthe show notes, as part of one of the URL\nreferences for that particular episode.\n\n83\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.330\nBut in general we gave you\nthe ability to go out and find that.\n\n84\n00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330\nAnd so, if you want to go out and\ngo down the road of\n\n85\n00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.750\nusing group policy, you've got the basic\nbuilding blocks there, because you can\n\n86\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.410\nlook at the settings in that spreadsheet,\nor spreadsheets that I referenced.\n\n87\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.500\nYou can then go ahead and follow\nthe information there to set this up,\n\n88\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.650\nit's really gonna be\na question of how you choose,\n\n89\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.505\nultimately, to figure\nout what you wanna do.\n\n90\n00:04:44.505 --> 00:04:48.351\nBut we're going to assume, having\nsaid all that, we're gonna assume and\n\n91\n00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:50.890\nwe know what happens when we do that, but\n\n92\n00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.490\nwe're gonna do it anyway,\ncuz here at ITProTV we live on the edge.\n\n93\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.750\n>> We do.\n>> So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n94\n00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.190\nwe're gonna assume that you are gonna\nwant to incorporate this into SCCM.\n\n95\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.140\nSo we're gonna go through\nthe process with you,\n\n96\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.610\nit's not very complicated\ndoesn't take very long.\n\n97\n00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.490\nBut we are gonna walk\nthrough the highlights for\n\n98\n00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.380\nyou following kind of our\nstandard methodology.\n\n99\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.060\nWe're gonna go through,\n\n100\n00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.170\nintroduce the concepts a little bit just\ntalk about some of the do's and don'ts.\n\n101\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.710\nWe're then gonna go into the live demo in\nour traditional demo environment which I'm\n\n102\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.440\njust gonna reset here real quickly and\n\n103\n00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.910\nmake sure it does not time out\non us while we're talking.\n\n104\n00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.290\nBecause you know, that is ever so\nmuch fun to have to then go and redo.\n\n105\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.510\nSo, the idea within to,\nthe concept of Endpoint Protection,\n\n106\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.520\nis really the concept of incorporating and\n\n107\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.970\nwhenever we incorporate we typically\nare looking at adding a site system server\n\n108\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.090\nrole, so we're going to incorporate the\nEndpoint Protection solution by going in.\n\n109\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.660\nAnd actually using or installing the\nEndpoint Protection site system role and\n\n110\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.370\nthen using that, configuring it, and then\nsetting it up so that we can then control\n\n111\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.910\nthe firewall and or the malware updates or\nboth depending on what we're doing.\n\n112\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.525\nSo we're gonna go through,\nwe're gonna take a look at how to do this,\n\n113\n00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:57.335\nwe do have a couple of pre-reqs, some\nthings that we just wanna be aware of or\n\n114\n00:05:57.335 --> 00:06:00.645\nat least just some thought processes to\nkeep in mind and we'll summarize this for\n\n115\n00:06:00.645 --> 00:06:02.925\nyou again at the end as\nwe traditionally do,\n\n116\n00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:05.617\nMike's got all that stuff already\ntee'd up and ready for us.\n\n117\n00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:07.557\nBut we need\nthe Endpoint Protection points but\n\n118\n00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:09.967\nwe're gonna install that,\nwe'll see how to configure that.\n\n119\n00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:11.987\nWe need either default or\ncustom client settings,\n\n120\n00:06:11.987 --> 00:06:14.977\nwe've got those and we've spent\nsome significant time on those.\n\n121\n00:06:14.977 --> 00:06:18.297\nWe do need a software update point if\nwe're gonna be doing software updates, and\n\n122\n00:06:18.297 --> 00:06:21.677\ndelivering them for definition updates and\nengine updates that means that we're gonna\n\n123\n00:06:21.677 --> 00:06:24.347\ndo the malware piece as opposed\nto just the firewall piece.\n\n124\n00:06:24.347 --> 00:06:28.157\nSo we need a software update site for\nthat or a software update point and\n\n125\n00:06:28.157 --> 00:06:29.110\nsite for that.\n\n126\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.083\nReporting services we're going\nto keep track of that, and then,\n\n127\n00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:34.440\nwe do have to have the license\nas I mentioned as well.\n\n128\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.603\nSo, we are go ahead and take a look at\nthat, but first, we could go over to my\n\n129\n00:06:37.603 --> 00:06:40.949\nmachine, we're go ahead, we're going\nto get started with our demo for you.\n\n130\n00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.388\nI wanted you all wanna switch up\non this so you wanna do the demo?\n\n131\n00:06:43.388 --> 00:06:43.992\n>> No, no.\n\n132\n00:06:43.992 --> 00:06:45.014\n>> Just a little change of pace.\n\n133\n00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:46.430\n>> Okay let's try it, you wanna do that?\n\n134\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.581\n>> We could just unhook and\nrun back around,\n\n135\n00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:51.350\nwe can just be really crazy\nhere on Friday afternoon.\n\n136\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.173\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> You pull up to the red light-\n\n137\n00:06:53.173 --> 00:06:54.589\n>> Fire drill, Chinese fire drill.\n\n138\n00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:55.300\n>> Yeah.\n\n139\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.010\nYep that's cool.\n\n140\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.470\nWe could do that but we need doors,\nwe could go running out the door and\n\n141\n00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.200\ncome back in the other door.\n\n142\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.390\nWe wouldn't see on\nthe wide site though but\n\n143\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.040\nwe could make\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.380\n>> some really cool sound effects\n\n145\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.420\nif you would like.\n\n146\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.280\nSo we're probably not gonna do that\nbecause we'll get yelled at for\n\n147\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.990\ndoing that if we do.\n\n148\n00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.510\n>> Two kids.\n\n149\n00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.830\n>> So we're gonna think better of that.\n\n150\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.291\nBut it is fun and exciting on a Friday\nafternoon to joke around about things,\n\n151\n00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:15.061\nbecause you never know what can\nhappen here at wacky Friday.\n\n152\n00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:17.741\nNo that would be wacky Wednesday,\nat freaky Friday here at\n\n153\n00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:18.542\n>> Freaky Friday there we go.\n\n154\n00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:19.482\n>> At ITProTv.\n\n155\n00:07:19.482 --> 00:07:23.166\n>> All right, so, we're going to go ahead\nand we're going to get the process started\n\n156\n00:07:23.166 --> 00:07:25.930\nto install the Endpoint Protection,\nsite server role.\n\n157\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.630\nNow, role, right, I keep saying row, role,\nI'm thinking sushi, on the brain, roe.\n\n158\n00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.640\nSo what we're going to, and\nwe've talked about this before,\n\n159\n00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.460\nwhenever we go to install,\na site server role.\n\n160\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.170\nWe're gonna always start\nout by looking and\n\n161\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.170\nseeing what's there to make sure we\ndon't already have it configured.\n\n162\n00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.810\nWe've gotten in the habit of doing that,\nand I'll remind you that.\n\n163\n00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.223\nThen we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna run that wizard,\n\n164\n00:07:46.223 --> 00:07:49.462\nwe're gonna choose out of our checklist\njust highlighting the steps involved.\n\n165\n00:07:49.462 --> 00:07:52.112\nThe role, in this case, or roles,\nwe may have more than one but\n\n166\n00:07:52.112 --> 00:07:55.712\nwe'll only need one in this case, that\nwe're gonna use, we'll go through whatever\n\n167\n00:07:55.712 --> 00:07:58.612\nconfiguration screen or screens\nthere may be Once we get that setup,\n\n168\n00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:01.562\nthen we'll be able to go ahead and\ndo whatever else we may need to do, so\n\n169\n00:08:01.562 --> 00:08:04.684\nif we can go to widescreen on that,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll take a look.\n\n170\n00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.000\nSo let me just zoom in here real quick,\nand\n\n171\n00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.650\nshow you where we are, we are in our\nAdministration workspace as you can see.\n\n172\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.410\nWe do have our Servers and\n\n173\n00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.690\nSite System Roles selected,\nwe have our Site System Role there\n\n174\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.290\nwith our site system rather with\nall of our roles available to us.\n\n175\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.780\nYou'll notice that the Endpoint Protection\nrole has not been currently configured so\n\n176\n00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.280\nthat means we are gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to install it.\n\n177\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.271\nSo what we're gonna do is right-click,\nwe're gonna\n\n178\n00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:37.570\nadd the Site System Role as we have done\nmany a time, go ahead and click on that.\n\n179\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:42.050\nWe'll get that with wizard fired up here,\nwe're just gonna skip through the first\n\n180\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.146\ncouple of screens, the general one that\ntells us where we are and what we're\n\n181\n00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:50.070\ndoing, the one that is now my new\nfavorite one which is the proxy screen.\n\n182\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.522\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I love proxies and so\n\n183\n00:08:52.522 --> 00:08:56.742\nnow what we're gonna do is come over here,\nwe'll just highlight this so\n\n184\n00:08:56.742 --> 00:08:58.070\nyou guys can see that.\n\n185\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:03.256\nWe will choose Endpoint Protection and\nyou could see that when we have done that,\n\n186\n00:09:03.256 --> 00:09:07.380\n[COUGH] see if I can scroll over and\nget that to scale properly.\n\n187\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.980\nWhen I have selected Endpoint Protection I\nhave this little pop up that comes up,\n\n188\n00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.120\nby default Endpoint Protection uses the\nConfiguration Manager software updates to\n\n189\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.830\ndeploy antimalware updates.\n\n190\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.780\nBefore you deploy Endpoint Protection,\n\n191\n00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.845\nensure you have configured software\nupdates in your hierarchy or\n\n192\n00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:27.986\nconfigure your antimalware policies to use\nan alternative definition update method.\n\n193\n00:09:27.986 --> 00:09:30.103\nSo they are reminding us\nof the fact that in effect,\n\n194\n00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:32.530\nalthough we don't really\ncreate this linkage directly.\n\n195\n00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:38.732\nIn our minds we know, by practice and\nobviously by warning, that in order to\n\n196\n00:09:38.732 --> 00:09:44.444\ndistribute antimalware updates, we have\nto use the software update feature set.\n\n197\n00:09:44.444 --> 00:09:47.881\nSo we would have to have a WSUS\nserver installed and configured,\n\n198\n00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:50.693\nwe would have to install\nthe software update point.\n\n199\n00:09:50.693 --> 00:09:54.096\nWe would then have to go through that\nentire process that we've already been\n\n200\n00:09:54.096 --> 00:09:57.510\nthrough and have demoed for you in\na prior episode, actually two episodes.\n\n201\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.850\nCuz we did go through and do that I\nthink over two cuz we had to wait for\n\n202\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.260\nour catalogue to sync, cuz that\ndoes take a little bit of time, so\n\n203\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.970\nwe wouldd have to go through that entire\nprocess, but let me be clear here.\n\n204\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.350\nWe only have to do that if we wanna\nuse the antimalware update features\n\n205\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.460\nthrough Windows and have it delivered\nthrough the WSUS integration and\n\n206\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.640\nthe functionality here.\n\n207\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.268\nIf we're only gonna use Endpoint\nProtection to manage the firewalls on\n\n208\n00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:24.047\nthe local endpoints and\nnot worry about antimalware,\n\n209\n00:10:24.047 --> 00:10:26.777\nthen we don't have to worry\nabout that integration.\n\n210\n00:10:26.777 --> 00:10:31.596\nIt's really up to us, and remember,\nthis particular feature is really\n\n211\n00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:35.240\na dual home feature,\nit's got two specific avenues.\n\n212\n00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:41.190\nWe can do firewall protection and\nor we can do antimalware support.\n\n213\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.200\nNow a lot of us may have a third\nparty antimalware client,\n\n214\n00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.660\nwe may not be using necessarily\nthe Microsoft client, right?\n\n215\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.930\nYou may have, I don't know, Symantec,\nmay have Norton, you may have\n\n216\n00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:58.130\nAvast set, you may have Eset, whoever,\nwhatever, doesn't really matter, right?\n\n217\n00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.731\nThe point is you may have another\nproduct that is not a Microsoft product,\n\n218\n00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:04.340\ndoing anti-virus or anti-malware or both.\n\n219\n00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.340\nAnd so as a result, you may not wanna\nmanage antimalware through this, right,\n\n220\n00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.120\nbecause you're just not\ngonna have that capability.\n\n221\n00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.110\nSo they're reminding us of that.\n\n222\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.120\nAnd we're obviously gonna have to\nthink about the implications of that\n\n223\n00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.640\nas we deploy here, so\nwe're being asked to do that.\n\n224\n00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.920\nJust want to point that out, make sure\nyou're comfortable with that whole thing,\n\n225\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.030\nplus it's cool to talk about and zoom\nin on the dialogue box because it's so\n\n226\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.020\nbig when we do that that\nit's just obnoxiously large.\n\n227\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.090\nAnd it's really fun to be able to do that,\nso\n\n228\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.480\nwe're gonna select our Endpoint\nProtection, we're gonna click Next.\n\n229\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.438\nWe do have a End User License Agreement\nthat we have to select and accept, so\n\n230\n00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:45.538\nI'm just gonna go ahead and do that for\nus, really no reason to worry about this.\n\n231\n00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.820\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nobviously know that it's there and\n\n232\n00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.550\nyou can read through that on your own.\n\n233\n00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.238\nWhen you find yourself not being\nable to fall asleep at some point,\n\n234\n00:11:52.238 --> 00:11:54.696\nit's usually good to go and\nread those license agreements.\n\n235\n00:11:54.696 --> 00:11:55.199\nSo, feel free to do that.\n\n236\n00:11:55.199 --> 00:11:57.764\nIt's a lot cheaper than\nactually using sleep aids and\n\n237\n00:11:57.764 --> 00:12:01.526\nnot as habit forming as well either, by\nthe way, so you do that once or twice and\n\n238\n00:12:01.526 --> 00:12:03.875\nyou break the habit of\nhaving to do it ever again.\n\n239\n00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:13.361\nSo what we also have here is the Microsoft\nAnti-virus Protection Research service.\n\n240\n00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:19.860\nThis is almost like the CIE of\nthe Customer Experience Program or CEP.\n\n241\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.985\nSo, we can go in and we can decide with\neither basic or advanced memberships,\n\n242\n00:12:23.985 --> 00:12:26.400\nthere's a little link you can go out to.\n\n243\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.040\nAnd take a look to read up on this,\nwhether we're basically gonna give\n\n244\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.410\nMicrosoft information on viruses and\nmalware that infects our systems.\n\n245\n00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.520\nWe're doing this for free,\nthis isn't costing us anything,\n\n246\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.680\njust giving them the benefit\nof us getting infected.\n\n247\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.930\nAnd them learning from that infection,\nwhatever may be going on, to try to then,\n\n248\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.000\nobviously, research and\npotentially figure out how to prevent it.\n\n249\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.130\nSo we're just giving them the ability, in\nother words, to pull data off the systems,\n\n250\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:49.650\nin other words.\n\n251\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.777\nAnd you'll get, potentially, files, and\ndo some investigation and forensics behind\n\n252\n00:12:54.777 --> 00:12:59.444\nthe scenes, that's all this is, so you\nguys can decide what you wanna do there.\n\n253\n00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:02.497\nWe're not gonna join the program\nright now for demo purposes,\n\n254\n00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:06.183\nwe're gonna gonna set that to do not\njoin and then we're gonna click Next and\n\n255\n00:13:06.183 --> 00:13:08.157\nwe're just gonna basically finish up.\n\n256\n00:13:08.157 --> 00:13:12.230\nYou can see that actually is\npretty straightforward, right?\n\n257\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.313\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n258\n00:13:13.313 --> 00:13:14.069\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n259\n00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:18.380\nWe'll just gonna give that a second to\nget setup and install, hit Close there.\n\n260\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.490\nAll right, so once we've done that,\nwe've setup and\n\n261\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.320\nwe have deployed our site server role.\n\n262\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.190\nNow what we're gonna do is go ahead and\n\n263\n00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:32.285\nwe're gonna take a look at how to\nconfigure alerts for Endpoint Protection.\n\n264\n00:13:32.285 --> 00:13:36.552\nSo we'll create a set of alerts, we'll go\nahead and go to Device Collections and\n\n265\n00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:40.630\nwe will go ahead and go to the Alerts tab\non the All Systems Device Collection to\n\n266\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.995\nkinda setup some alerts that we may wanna\nbe able to work with with regards to this.\n\n267\n00:13:44.995 --> 00:13:50.548\nSo we'll go in to our Assets and\nCompliance area, the workspace there,\n\n268\n00:13:50.548 --> 00:13:55.111\nwe'll you just zoom down,\ngo over to Device Collections.\n\n269\n00:13:55.111 --> 00:13:58.378\nAnd just bring up our device\ncollections and then we'll go ahead and\n\n270\n00:13:58.378 --> 00:14:01.985\nwe'll go to All Systems, we'll\nright-click and we will be able to go in,\n\n271\n00:14:01.985 --> 00:14:05.220\nI just have to scroll down to be able\nto get to it at the bottom there.\n\n272\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.155\nAnd we'll go to Properties,\njust zoom in quickly so\n\n273\n00:14:08.155 --> 00:14:11.570\nyou could see where we are there,\nsee, I'm on All Systems?\n\n274\n00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.412\nAnd you can see right here,\nI'm on Device Collections, and\n\n275\n00:14:14.412 --> 00:14:16.819\nI'm gonna go down to Properties and\nbring that up.\n\n276\n00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:20.692\nSo, we're gonna go to Properties in there\nas soon as we get our focus back and\n\n277\n00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:22.152\nget our mouse to cooperate.\n\n278\n00:14:22.152 --> 00:14:26.230\nSo, we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna do\nthat, and then, one of the many tabs that\n\n279\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.986\nwe have here, and I'll just zoom in and\npoint to it for you, is the Alerts tab.\n\n280\n00:14:29.986 --> 00:14:33.835\nWe haven't really spent any time in there\nbefore, but we're gonna go in, take a look\n\n281\n00:14:33.835 --> 00:14:37.505\nat the Alerts tab, all those things going\non in there, we didn't know existed.\n\n282\n00:14:37.505 --> 00:14:39.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're gonna go in, you can see,\n\n283\n00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.983\nwe can configure alert thresholds,\n\n284\n00:14:40.983 --> 00:14:43.694\nwe'll add in the conditions that\nwe wanna be able to create.\n\n285\n00:14:43.694 --> 00:14:46.370\nThis is gonna be collection wide.\n\n286\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.230\nSo since this is the all system's\ncollection, this is effectively going to\n\n287\n00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:55.080\ncreate an alert threshold for any system\nthat is in the SCCM inventory body.\n\n288\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.880\nBecause all systems wind up in\nthe All Systems collection, and\n\n289\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.730\nremember, a system.\n\n290\n00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:00.901\nWe haven't really stressed this before.\n\n291\n00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.351\nIt's probably good to mention this,\n\n292\n00:15:02.351 --> 00:15:04.445\njust while we're waiting on\nthe Add Wizard to come up.\n\n293\n00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:07.635\nThat All Systems collection is one\nof many collections, as you saw,\n\n294\n00:15:07.635 --> 00:15:11.210\nof the device collections, that we may\nbe able to, as a system and, indeed,\n\n295\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.180\nwe will be as a system, be able to be\na member of more than one collection.\n\n296\n00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.282\nSo it's not that we're just in one,\nwe will potentially finding ourselves in\n\n297\n00:15:18.282 --> 00:15:21.250\nmultiple collections, so do be aware\nof that, and just keep that in mind.\n\n298\n00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:26.569\nAll right, I think that we are waiting,\nand we have gotten, there we go.\n\n299\n00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:30.122\nAll right, so\nwe have our Add New Collection Alerts, so\n\n300\n00:15:30.122 --> 00:15:34.070\nlet's just move that over there so\nwe can see what is going on.\n\n301\n00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.861\nThat's probably a little too.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:38.565\n>> All right, so\n\n303\n00:15:38.565 --> 00:15:42.264\nyou have client status, we can,\nas you can see there, client check pass or\n\n304\n00:15:42.264 --> 00:15:45.394\nno results for active clients\nfalls below certain threshold.\n\n305\n00:15:45.394 --> 00:15:48.871\nRemediation success falls below,\nclient activity falls below and\n\n306\n00:15:48.871 --> 00:15:51.319\nthen we have a group for\nEndpoint protections.\n\n307\n00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:54.736\nSpecifically, those are the ones we\ncame To actually look at because these\n\n308\n00:15:54.736 --> 00:15:57.502\nare the ones we're interested in,\nif malware is detected,\n\n309\n00:15:57.502 --> 00:15:58.763\nwe should send up an alert.\n\n310\n00:15:58.763 --> 00:16:00.665\nWell, that's obviously, probably gonna\nbe pretty valuable for us, right.\n\n311\n00:16:00.665 --> 00:16:01.375\n>> Yeah.\n\n312\n00:16:01.375 --> 00:16:04.291\n>> The same type of malware is\ndetected on a number of computers,\n\n313\n00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:07.541\nnot just one instance, one place,\none time, but, hey, you know,\n\n314\n00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:09.637\nwe've got all sorts of stuff breaking out.\n\n315\n00:16:09.637 --> 00:16:12.981\nAnd, we've got a whole bunch of\nmalware infecting a lot of systems and\n\n316\n00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:16.340\nit looks to be the same, same type\nof malware is repeatedly detected.\n\n317\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.975\nThat's when you know that someone is\nnot just stupid, but really stupid.\n\n318\n00:16:19.975 --> 00:16:20.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n319\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.400\nI didn't just click on that link one time,\nI liked it so much, I went back and\n\n320\n00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.210\nclicked on it multiple times, and then,\n\n321\n00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.150\nmultiple types of malware\ndetected on the same computer.\n\n322\n00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.890\nSo, we have different options, so,\nobviously we have a choice here.\n\n323\n00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.990\nWe have to decide which alert or\n\n324\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.560\nalert thresholds we may want to actually\nspecify with regards to malware detection.\n\n325\n00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.260\nNow again keep in mind all of this\nis predicated on all of this assumes\n\n326\n00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.990\nthat you are gonna use\nthe malware detection piece.\n\n327\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:52.060\nIf all we're gonna do is focus\non firewall configuration\n\n328\n00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.940\nthen none of this matters because\nthis is part of this is half\n\n329\n00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.750\nof the overall thought process\nassociated with Endpoint protection.\n\n330\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.194\nSo we just want to keep this in mind\nbecause while sound is really cool,\n\n331\n00:17:03.385 --> 00:17:06.925\nit may work real well for us if we're\nusing the malware protection or\n\n332\n00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.845\nwe're using a Microsoft centric product.\n\n333\n00:17:08.845 --> 00:17:12.045\nWe have this capability with other\nprograms, but we're gonna manage it\n\n334\n00:17:12.045 --> 00:17:15.595\nsomewhere else using the capabilities\nthat that vendor has given us.\n\n335\n00:17:15.595 --> 00:17:17.875\nWe may not be able to\nintegrate those alerts and\n\n336\n00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:21.390\ntherefor that thought process and\nthat reporting here.\n\n337\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.340\nAnd this is that underlying value\nproposition I was talking about which is\n\n338\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.260\nare we gonna invest and\n\n339\n00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.120\nare we gonna spend the money to be able\nto do this centrally within one product?\n\n340\n00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.990\nOr are we gonna and\npart of this over to another vendor and\n\n341\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.590\nnot necessarily integrate it here?\n\n342\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.230\nThat's really what we have to decide, so\n\n343\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.250\nwe're gonna check off all of this cuz\nwe'll go ahead and activate them all cuz\n\n344\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.280\nwhy not we already paid for it so\nhell we might as well right?\n\n345\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.870\nSo we'll click OK there, we'll put those\nin, and then we have a little alert\n\n346\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.440\nseverity issue that we have to address\ndown here in terms of the settings.\n\n347\n00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.930\nWe have our alerts and so\nwe specify, we highlight,\n\n348\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.480\nI think I have Multiple malware\ndetection highlighted there.\n\n349\n00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.380\nSo we have the alert name,\nwe specify what the severity is,\n\n350\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.845\nnumber of malware types detected,\nhow often is the detection,\n\n351\n00:18:06.845 --> 00:18:10.335\nwe have to just go in and\nconfigure as you can see there.\n\n352\n00:18:10.335 --> 00:18:14.095\nNumber of malware, types, and\ninterval for detection, so by alert,\n\n353\n00:18:14.095 --> 00:18:17.395\nwe can specify certain threshold\nparameters, so we go and we edit these,\n\n354\n00:18:17.395 --> 00:18:19.185\nwe modify them if necessary.\n\n355\n00:18:19.185 --> 00:18:20.535\nFigure out what it is we want to do,\n\n356\n00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:23.435\nnow that we've done that,\nwe'll click OK there.\n\n357\n00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.010\nNot applying OK but OK you know why?\n\n358\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.360\nBecause I just don't care that's why.\n\n359\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.260\nAnd so we're gonna do that and\n\n360\n00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.730\nthen once we've done that our alerts\nare set up, it's really that simple.\n\n361\n00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.900\nNow obviously we have to start actively\nmonitoring, make sure we know what's going\n\n362\n00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.930\non with that to get that up and running\nand actually leverage those alerts.\n\n363\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.560\nBut to just set it up basically\nthat's all we need to do.\n\n364\n00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.420\nNow the other thing we're gonna do since\nwe're in here we'll go in here and we'll\n\n365\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.790\ntake a quick look at this and just go to\nadministration to the workspace here.\n\n366\n00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:56.300\nLet's go to client settings real quick,\nlet's go into our default client settings\n\n367\n00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.060\nand we'll go ahead and we'll bring these\nup we'll bring up the properties and\n\n368\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.070\nwe'll take a look here for just a second.\n\n369\n00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:07.360\nAnd you just highlight Endpoint\nprotection and bring that over here and\n\n370\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.300\nwe do have a lot of\nsettings associated with.\n\n371\n00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.800\nYou can see Endpoint protection in\nour default settings there right?\n\n372\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.050\nSo you see that we've highlighted that and\nwe do have a bunch of settings that\n\n373\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.900\nare gonna have to be configured, starting\nwith hey are we actually gonna manage that\n\n374\n00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.240\nclient on the Endpoint computer, and\nthen from there, we're gonna install it or\n\n375\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.465\nwe can automatically remove\nany previously found versions?\n\n376\n00:19:31.465 --> 00:19:35.705\nAre we're gonna allow restarts once we do\npatching outside the maintenance window\n\n377\n00:19:35.705 --> 00:19:39.360\nare we're gonna suppress restarts for\ncertain amount of time?\n\n378\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.340\nWe got a whole bunch of stuff\nwe got to contend with here, so\n\n379\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.030\nwe're gonna have to set that up and\nbe aware of that.\n\n380\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.939\nSo if we do Yes, and set that up,\nall the other one's become active and\n\n381\n00:19:47.939 --> 00:19:51.383\nwere then able to go in,\nthey're no longer greyed out and so,\n\n382\n00:19:51.383 --> 00:19:55.325\nwe can see that now we can go through and\nconfigure those as necessary.\n\n383\n00:19:55.325 --> 00:19:59.814\nSo, we're gonna set all that up, click\nOK there that's gonna turn on Endpoint\n\n384\n00:19:59.814 --> 00:20:04.102\nprotection on the h and now remember\nonce we've done that do you remember how\n\n385\n00:20:04.102 --> 00:20:07.124\noften the policy re fare\ncycle is on the client agent?\n\n386\n00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:07.912\n>> 60 minutes.\n\n387\n00:20:07.912 --> 00:20:09.805\n>> 60 minutes by default right?\n\n388\n00:20:09.805 --> 00:20:11.223\n>> By default yes.\n>> Can we modify that though?\n\n389\n00:20:11.223 --> 00:20:12.448\n>> We can.\n>> We can right so\n\n390\n00:20:12.448 --> 00:20:14.423\nwe may actually see a change in that but\n\n391\n00:20:14.423 --> 00:20:18.437\nat a minimum if we have not messed around\nin there and modified it anywhere from\n\n392\n00:20:18.437 --> 00:20:22.730\nseveral minutes cuz we may be at the very\nend of that cycle so we don't really know.\n\n393\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.370\nIt would be great if there was like a\nclock that was ticking down that would be\n\n394\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.000\nkind of cool but we don't have that.\n\n395\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.870\nSo we don't really know for sure but\nanywhere from a few minutes to maybe\n\n396\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.280\nas much as 60 minutes to wait for that\nto show up if we don't do that manually.\n\n397\n00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.510\nNow we could go into the agent and\n\n398\n00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.860\nwe've seen this in one of the prior\nepisodes where we have the agent up and\n\n399\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.635\nwhen I showed you,\nyou can manually kick that off.\n\n400\n00:20:40.635 --> 00:20:42.310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you could go highlight that do\n\n401\n00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.480\na user and machine policy retrieval.\n\n402\n00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.090\nWe have one of each, and that will then\nbring back down those settings quickly, or\n\n403\n00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.170\nmore quickly right?\n\n404\n00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:53.470\nOr [COUGH] we could go in and\njust do one or the other.\n\n405\n00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.410\nBut either way,\nwhat we're doing is forcing the client to\n\n406\n00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.350\ngo out to the management point,\ncheck for a status update,\n\n407\n00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.700\nfind out that there is a pending change,\nand bring that down sooner.\n\n408\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.360\nSo we have that capability if we choose\nto, let's configure definition updates for\n\n409\n00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.380\nEndpoint protection, we can go in here and\nwe can at least talk about how to do this.\n\n410\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.430\nWe'll just take a look, if you will,\n\n411\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:17.850\nwe'll go into the software library,\nwe'll go into our software updates.\n\n412\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.600\nIf you remember,\nwe spent a fair bit of time in here, and\n\n413\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.000\nyou'll just notice that we do not have and\n\n414\n00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.040\nsoftware updates in here right now,\nwe're not creating the catalog again.\n\n415\n00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.090\nWhat we're doing is just simply gonna\ncreate an automatic deployment rule\n\n416\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.580\nthat will be used to do the updates.\n\n417\n00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.950\nWe can do that whether we already have\nall the updates in or not, cuz what we're\n\n418\n00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.130\ngonna do is leverage the auto deployment\nor the automatic deployment rule.\n\n419\n00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.140\nAnd if you can remember when we did\nthis in the demo, as we went through and\n\n420\n00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.730\nset up the software update functionality.\n\n421\n00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.600\nTowards the end of the second\npart of the demo or\n\n422\n00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.710\nthe second episode rather in the demo.\n\n423\n00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.500\nTowards the end of that we set up the\nautomatic deployment rules, we went in and\n\n424\n00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.760\nwe set up a template using\nthe patch Tuesday template.\n\n425\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.300\nThere was another one that said deployment\nupdates and I said oh we're gonna come\n\n426\n00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.580\nback to that when we do Endpoint\nprotection, we're going to use that one.\n\n427\n00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.320\nAnd that's the one we're going to\ncome into and use right now, so,\n\n428\n00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.720\nwe can actually set these rules up,\nwhether we've actually installed and\n\n429\n00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.490\nconfigured the software\nupdate solution first.\n\n430\n00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.530\nWe come back and can figure that out\nafterwards and obviously in this case,\n\n431\n00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.460\nwe'd have to do that,\nbecause it's not installed.\n\n432\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.560\nSo, we're going to go in and we're going\nto the automatic deployment rules,\n\n433\n00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.090\nhighlight that,\nwe don't have any rules there,\n\n434\n00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.820\nwe'll create an automatic deployment rule.\n\n435\n00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.041\nWe get our wizard,\ngo ahead and give this a name.\n\n436\n00:22:35.345 --> 00:22:42.547\nWe will choose, Our definition update\ntemplateas opposed to patch Tuesday.\n\n437\n00:22:42.547 --> 00:22:43.817\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So what we're gonna use so\n\n438\n00:22:43.817 --> 00:22:45.424\nwe'll go ahead and we'll grab that one.\n\n439\n00:22:47.548 --> 00:22:51.279\nWe do have to put in the collection\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n440\n00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:54.265\nchoose all systems we've\ntalked about this.\n\n441\n00:22:54.265 --> 00:22:58.240\nObviously in production not a good idea\nbut, we do know that just in terms\n\n442\n00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.213\nof testing that is obviously gonna allow\nus to do the things we need to do,\n\n443\n00:23:02.213 --> 00:23:03.581\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n444\n00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:07.191\ncreate a new software update group\nwhenever we do a update there.\n\n445\n00:23:07.191 --> 00:23:10.100\nSo, we’ll go ahead and will set that up,\n\n446\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.839\nwe did that the last time by the way\nas well, then what we're going to\n\n447\n00:23:14.839 --> 00:23:18.930\ndo is we are going to go ahead and\nwe are going to click Next.\n\n448\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.730\nLet me just get down here to\nthe bottom where we see that,\n\n449\n00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.450\nall right let me just click next there,\nthere we go.\n\n450\n00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.890\nSo we're going to move down through\ndeployment settings, and we're just going\n\n451\n00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.890\nto keep the defaults here, we're not gonna\nreally go in and change a lot of stuff.\n\n452\n00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.950\nAnd we've been through this already so\nmentally stop and\n\n453\n00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.450\nhighlight on the screens that are going\nto be of interest to us here.\n\n454\n00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.628\nWe're not really going to spend\na lot of time on the other ones,\n\n455\n00:23:38.628 --> 00:23:40.530\nbecause we've done this in\none of the prior episodes.\n\n456\n00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.503\nSo, on the software updates page,\nwe're going to ensure the product and\n\n457\n00:23:44.503 --> 00:23:48.349\nupdate classification is selected,\nnow you'll see product there And\n\n458\n00:23:48.349 --> 00:23:51.760\nyou will see down below we have\nupdate classification as well.\n\n459\n00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.420\nLet me just scroll down so you can see\nI think I got them both in there yeah.\n\n460\n00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.800\nSo we didn't really\nlook at this last time.\n\n461\n00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.330\nWe just had the screen on one and\nwe did see that but we didn't see both.\n\n462\n00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.720\nBut you'll see I have both product and\nupdate classification check marked.\n\n463\n00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.180\nThose are there by default and\n\n464\n00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.620\nyou'll see that for product it says\nForefront Endpoint Protection 2010 and\n\n465\n00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.240\nit says Update Classification\nDefiniton Updates, now the reason for\n\n466\n00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.370\nthat is because I chose\nthe deployment updates template.\n\n467\n00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.240\nIf I had chosen patch\ntuesday as the template,\n\n468\n00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.550\nit would only have had product and\n\n469\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.200\nit would have had the other Information\nwe saw on there where we went in and\n\n470\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.120\nwe set updates that are older then and\nremember we changed it from one day to 30.\n\n471\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.900\nWe did a scan and we actually\nthen got an update to show up and\n\n472\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.300\nwe created our group from that.\n\n473\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.880\nSo those two templates are pre-built.\n\n474\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.850\nMicrosoft puts them in there for\nyou to be able to have this pre-built\n\n475\n00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:41.760\nlogic already in and\nwe can obviously modify this if necessary.\n\n476\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.880\nIt's up to us but\n\n477\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.670\nbecause we're using the deployment updates\ntemplate that's pretty configured,\n\n478\n00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.650\nwe're getting this settings just to\nbe clear that's where they came from.\n\n479\n00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.610\nWe did not preload that,\nwe didn't make that up.\n\n480\n00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.968\nThat just comes with the product,\nit is there.\n\n481\n00:24:55.968 --> 00:24:59.440\nWe just wanna make sure that we see\nthat it's there, we understand that and\n\n482\n00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.750\nthen we're gonna go ahead and continue.\n\n483\n00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.770\nSo, just wanted to point that out to you.\n\n484\n00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:06.920\nNow, obviously we do\nhave that preview button.\n\n485\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.170\nWe talked about the value of preview.\n\n486\n00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.490\nNow in this case when we click,\nPreview, and\n\n487\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.760\nwe wait, and we wait some more,\nand we wait some more.\n\n488\n00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.037\nYou know what I like to do when I wait?\n\n489\n00:25:19.037 --> 00:25:19.617\n>> What?\n\n490\n00:25:19.617 --> 00:25:20.363\n>> I like to wait.\n\n491\n00:25:20.363 --> 00:25:25.201\n>> [LAUGH] Hum, sing.\n\n492\n00:25:25.201 --> 00:25:27.230\n>> No you know I can't carry a tune,\n\n493\n00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.438\nI'm about as tone deaf as\nthey come unfortunately.\n\n494\n00:25:30.438 --> 00:25:33.200\nYou don't wanna be around me when\nI decide to sing in the shower it\n\n495\n00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.280\nmakes animals cry.\n\n496\n00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.280\nSo what you can see here is that we're\nnot seeing anything coming back.\n\n497\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.200\nNow this is not surprising if you\nthink about what I told you as\n\n498\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.350\nwe were setting this up.\n\n499\n00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.750\nWe have not loaded the software update\nfeature in yet, and have not synced and\n\n500\n00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:47.780\nbuilt a catalog.\n\n501\n00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.400\nSo we should not actually\nsee any updates here,\n\n502\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.420\nbecause there's nothing to see, right?\n\n503\n00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.240\nThat was a trick question by the way,\nright?\n\n504\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.510\nWe should have know that\nthat would come up as zero.\n\n505\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:01.000\nBut my point is, when you do preview this\nin production, you would actually see\n\n506\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.920\nupdates that would match that criteria,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n507\n00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.290\nAll right,\nwe're going to close out of there.\n\n508\n00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.010\nThere we go.\n\n509\n00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.840\nAll right, and\nthen we're gonna come down here.\n\n510\n00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.090\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n511\n00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.480\nWe have our synchronization schedule.\n\n512\n00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.960\nWe're gonna make sure\nthat we set this up and\n\n513\n00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.600\nrun the rule after any software\nupdate point synchronization.\n\n514\n00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.850\nSo we've got that set up.\n\n515\n00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.500\nJust make sure that's chosen.\n\n516\n00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.310\nWe'll click Next.\n\n517\n00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:30.170\nWe're gonna leave the defaults here,\n\n518\n00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:34.060\nand let's do as soon as possible it\ndoesn't really matters for that actually,\n\n519\n00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.300\nhave anything to deploys we have no\nupdates were not gonna create them but,\n\n520\n00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.930\nwe just go ahead and will step that up and\nthen on software installation\n\n521\n00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:46.440\nwe have our software installation or\nuser experience items there.\n\n522\n00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.630\nSo we'll do that cuz we all know\nhow I feel about user experience.\n\n523\n00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.670\nI and then we don't any alerts here.\n\n524\n00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:59.270\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nscroll down on that one,\n\n525\n00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:04.405\nthere go and\nwhen we are doing our installation or\n\n526\n00:27:04.405 --> 00:27:06.985\na download areas specifying\nwhere we gonna go.\n\n527\n00:27:06.985 --> 00:27:11.355\nWe gonna make sure that we just click all\nthe defaults or keep the defaults on here.\n\n528\n00:27:11.355 --> 00:27:13.205\nWe begin then through\nthis screen is ready.\n\n529\n00:27:13.205 --> 00:27:17.885\nThis is how to use the, you know\nthe preferential distribution point and\n\n530\n00:27:17.885 --> 00:27:21.635\nthen also make sure that if you are within\na slow site bound read that we may,\n\n531\n00:27:21.635 --> 00:27:24.850\nyou know may or may not choose to download\ndepending on what we're doing so,\n\n532\n00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.020\nI just wanna be able to think about that.\n\n533\n00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:27.710\nSo, we'll do that.\n\n534\n00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.920\nWe then have a deployment package.\n\n535\n00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.970\nWe're now gonna go ahead and we\nare going to create a brand new package.\n\n536\n00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:36.380\nCuz like we did the last time,\n\n537\n00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.700\nwe have to do that because we don't\nhave an existing package for this.\n\n538\n00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.230\nSo, we'll go ahead, we'll give it a name.\n\n539\n00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.810\nJust type in there.\n\n540\n00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.260\nCall this Pack E1.\n\n541\n00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.170\nAnd we are going to go ahead and\ntype in our path.\n\n542\n00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.330\nSo let me just type in our path.\n\n543\n00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.950\nPLABDCO1, I believe.\n\n544\n00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.397\nAnd then, SW, for software and\n\n545\n00:27:57.397 --> 00:28:00.867\nEP definition updates.\n\n546\n00:28:05.074 --> 00:28:12.282\nGot that and then we will click Next.\n\n547\n00:28:12.282 --> 00:28:17.706\nAnd we'll go out to our distribution\npoint, specify that, select that and\n\n548\n00:28:17.706 --> 00:28:23.214\nget that teed up there, add that in\nthen we'll put in our download location,\n\n549\n00:28:23.214 --> 00:28:28.303\nwe're gonna download software from\nthe internet, from Microsoft but\n\n550\n00:28:28.303 --> 00:28:33.020\nobviously in this case we are not\nreally gonna do that, right?\n\n551\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.080\nWe're just saying that we would but in the\nreal world obviously we will be getting\n\n552\n00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.722\nthat from the Windows Update site, there's\nmy favorite thing with the language.\n\n553\n00:28:40.722 --> 00:28:43.480\nYet again, screw it,\nwe're going to leave it all in there.\n\n554\n00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.170\n>> Let's do them all.\n\n555\n00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.580\n>> We're just gonna download them all,\nbecause we don't really care.\n\n556\n00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.310\nAll right, so we're basically get\ndone here, we're going to hit next.\n\n557\n00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.330\nAnd we're going to let that go and\nwork it's magic.\n\n558\n00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.280\nBecause that download for language is\nnot going to effect the timing on this.\n\n559\n00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.040\nWe're not actually going to go out and\ndo that for real.\n\n560\n00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.060\nAll right, so we have all that out there,\nwe're going to hit close, and so\n\n561\n00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.630\nnow what you'll see.\n\n562\n00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:09.550\nIs that, we have created\nan automatic deployment rule\n\n563\n00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.770\ncalled malware so now we able to automate\nthe process of going out looking for\n\n564\n00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.610\nthose updates bringing them in and\nsetting it all up.\n\n565\n00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:20.000\nNow what we're gonna do is create and\ndeploy some anti malware policy.\n\n566\n00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.670\nSo we're actually gonna go in and\nwe're gonna go and we're going to\n\n567\n00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.530\ngo into assets and compliance and\ntake a look at the anti malware policy.\n\n568\n00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.340\nSo we're gonna come in here to assets and\ncompliance.\n\n569\n00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:35.380\nWe're gonna come over here to end point\nprotection, and we'll come down here and\n\n570\n00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.159\nI'll zoom in here so you can see this.\n\n571\n00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.540\nRight so we're in assets and compliance.\n\n572\n00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.030\nAnd you'll notice right there under N\npoint protection we have both anti malware\n\n573\n00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.760\npolicies and Windows firewall policies.\n\n574\n00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.210\nAnd we've been talking about the fact\nthat there's this split between the two.\n\n575\n00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.495\nThat we can do one or the other above.\n\n576\n00:29:51.495 --> 00:29:54.365\nAll of this is predicated on the idea\nthat we're just gonna build policies that\n\n577\n00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:56.855\nare gonna be used to configure\nhow endpoints will behave.\n\n578\n00:29:56.855 --> 00:30:00.035\nThis is basically group policy\njust being applied through SCCM.\n\n579\n00:30:00.035 --> 00:30:02.703\nThat's why I said we could do\nthis directly with group policy.\n\n580\n00:30:02.703 --> 00:30:06.653\nSave ourselves some money, but we may not\nget the advanced capabilities of doing\n\n581\n00:30:06.653 --> 00:30:10.212\nthe reporting and some of the other\nstuff that may actually show up here.\n\n582\n00:30:10.212 --> 00:30:12.902\nSo, it's really just a question\nof how we choose to manage this.\n\n583\n00:30:12.902 --> 00:30:15.472\nSo we're gonna go into\nAntimalware Policies.\n\n584\n00:30:16.872 --> 00:30:19.152\nWe will see, as we scroll in,\n\n585\n00:30:19.152 --> 00:30:23.370\nthat we do have, we're highlighting\nhere Antimalware Policies.\n\n586\n00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:28.140\nWe do have a default client antimalware\npolicy already in place, so\n\n587\n00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.620\nwe can go in and we can modify that,\nor we can go in and we can actually\n\n588\n00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.560\nmodify or edit that, or we can go in\nGo ahead and we can create our own.\n\n589\n00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.520\nLet's just take a look on what\nthe default settings are and\n\n590\n00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.110\nthen we'll talk about creating\nour own just so we can see that.\n\n591\n00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.900\nSo let's go in, let's go to properties.\n\n592\n00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.537\nIt always good to look at what's there\nby default before we actually go in and\n\n593\n00:30:47.537 --> 00:30:48.327\nmodify anything.\n\n594\n00:30:48.327 --> 00:30:50.316\nSo what we'll see is that.\n\n595\n00:30:53.576 --> 00:30:57.912\nWe have policies that deal with,\nsee if we get that all in there.\n\n596\n00:30:57.912 --> 00:31:02.523\nScheduled scans, scan settings, default\naction, real-time protection, exclusion\n\n597\n00:31:02.523 --> 00:31:07.028\nsettings, threat overrides, the Active\nProtection Service, definition updates.\n\n598\n00:31:07.028 --> 00:31:09.492\nAll the stuff we would\nwant to do is all there.\n\n599\n00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:13.240\nWe just have to configure it all kind\nof one setting or one area at a time.\n\n600\n00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.570\nAnd then we obviously have a group of\nsettings by area that we can go in.\n\n601\n00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.945\nAnd, I have a two by two space on\nthe desk to move my mouse around in.\n\n602\n00:31:22.945 --> 00:31:25.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> But actually as long as it's enough to\n\n603\n00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.751\nmove about a third of\nan inch in every direction.\n\n604\n00:31:27.751 --> 00:31:29.043\n>> [LAUGH] Falls off the edge.\n\n605\n00:31:29.043 --> 00:31:32.130\n>> Otherwise we get incremental\nupdates as we move back and forth.\n\n606\n00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.850\nBut you can see we have all sorts\nof stuff that we can set up.\n\n607\n00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.400\nNow what we're not gonna do is spend the\nnext twenty minutes drilling in to every\n\n608\n00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.690\none of these settings,\ncuz that's gonna be a little bit much.\n\n609\n00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.624\nYou guys can do that on your own\nif you actually wanna go in and\n\n610\n00:31:41.624 --> 00:31:42.600\nfigure out all of this stuff.\n\n611\n00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.156\nThese look like pretty common antivirus,\n\n612\n00:31:45.156 --> 00:31:48.004\nany malware programme\nhas these ame settings.\n\n613\n00:31:48.004 --> 00:31:52.065\nIn fact The same settings we see if we\nmanage this on a endpoint individually,\n\n614\n00:31:52.065 --> 00:31:54.750\nwe're just doing it here centrally.\n\n615\n00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.580\n>> Absolutely, now one of the nice\nthings though that we can see here,\n\n616\n00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.950\nwe'll just come over here to scan\nsettings and if I zoom in a little bit.\n\n617\n00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.050\nNotice that we have the ability to\nscan email and email attachments.\n\n618\n00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:09.600\nScan removable storage devices, scan\nnetwork drives when running a full scan,\n\n619\n00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.090\nScan archive files, and\nactually allow us to\n\n620\n00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.820\neffectively decide whether users\nhave control of the scans or not.\n\n621\n00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.460\n>> That's nice.\n\n622\n00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.680\n>> So that is kinda nice, right?\n\n623\n00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.880\nSo we do have some integrated\ncapabilities there, so take that, Mr.\n\n624\n00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.655\nI don't wanna write a cheque for\nendpoint protection.\n\n625\n00:32:23.655 --> 00:32:25.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And stick that in your pipe and\n\n626\n00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.440\nsmoke it, right?\n\n627\n00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.060\nSo we can set that up,\nthat's obviously gonna be fairly cool,\n\n628\n00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.990\nwe also have the real-time\nprotection capabilities here.\n\n629\n00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.370\nWe'll just zoom in on that so\nyou guys can see that, for just a second.\n\n630\n00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.650\nSo we have real-time protection,\nmonitor file and program activity,\n\n631\n00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:45.350\nscan incoming and outgoing files,\nscan all download files and attachments.\n\n632\n00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.760\nWe do behavior monitoring, so\n\n633\n00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.710\nwe have Heuristic based\nmonitoring solution in there.\n\n634\n00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:54.120\nWe can enable protection against\nnetwork based exploits, that's DOS,\n\n635\n00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.590\nDDOS attacks coming in against bandwidth.\n\n636\n00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:01.600\nAnd we can also allow the user to specify\nagain whether the user gets the right and\n\n637\n00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.410\nability to be able to turn this on or off.\n\n638\n00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:07.310\nSo we control whether the users get in\nthe way of us actually protecting things,\n\n639\n00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:10.120\nwhich is obviously gonna be\nsomewhat important as well.\n\n640\n00:33:11.426 --> 00:33:14.720\nAnd then, under Advanced,\n\n641\n00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:20.340\nwe do also have just couple of things that\nI wanna show you, that are kinda cool.\n\n642\n00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.110\nWe do have the ability to create\nsystem restore points and fore step,\n\n643\n00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:26.170\nbefore we clean, we could disable\nthe client user interface,\n\n644\n00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.650\nwhich means that the user cannot go in and\nmuck around, which is good.\n\n645\n00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.720\nWe can delete quarantined files after so\nmany days,\n\n646\n00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:37.110\nwe can go ahead and\nallow users to exclude certain files or\n\n647\n00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.940\nfolders from scanning, so in all the\nthings that you would normally expect and\n\n648\n00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.490\nsee in the end point client are all here.\n\n649\n00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.250\nSo we do have all that capability,\nso that's actually kinda nice, so\n\n650\n00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.710\nwhat we could do if we\nwanna create a custom one\n\n651\n00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.170\nis effectively come over here\nto anti-malware policies.\n\n652\n00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.225\nAnd we can just go in and\nwe can create our antimalware policy,\n\n653\n00:33:56.225 --> 00:34:00.100\neffectively programming in and answering\nall those questions using a wizard.\n\n654\n00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.930\nI'm not gonna bother to run through\nthe entire wizard when you've seen\n\n655\n00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.380\nbasically what happens.\n\n656\n00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:09.111\nI just wanna show you that we effectively\ncan decide what area or what setting or\n\n657\n00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:13.841\nsettings we wanna check off, just like\nwe do with the client agent settings for\n\n658\n00:34:13.841 --> 00:34:15.722\nSCCM when we customize those.\n\n659\n00:34:15.722 --> 00:34:18.856\nCheck off the boxes,\nmove them over to the left to the navbar,\n\n660\n00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:22.290\nwe then are able to go through\nhighlight them and configure them, so\n\n661\n00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.244\nif we just wanted to do schedule scans and\nscan settings and\n\n662\n00:34:25.244 --> 00:34:29.016\nnothing else on a customized solution\nwe could do that, that's up to us.\n\n663\n00:34:29.016 --> 00:34:30.060\n>> Nice.\n\n664\n00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.640\n>> So we have that capability we're\nnot gonna actually do that but\n\n665\n00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.750\nI just wanted to show\nyou how that will work.\n\n666\n00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.960\nI want to drill in and spend a couple\nminutes on the firewall policies cuz\n\n667\n00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.580\nthose are also gonna be important so\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n668\n00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.830\nNow on the firewall policies we do not\nactually have any default policies,\n\n669\n00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.410\nyou can see there there's nothing there.\n\n670\n00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:49.980\nSo we're gonna have to create our own\nfirewall policy if we wanna control that.\n\n671\n00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:57.143\nSo we're gonna right-click, and we're\ngoing to Create a Windows Firewall Policy.\n\n672\n00:34:57.143 --> 00:34:59.140\nI think your firewall looked better\nby the way, in your diagram.\n\n673\n00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.010\n>> Oh, thank you [LAUGH].\n\n674\n00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.005\n>> I do think that your's\nwas a nicer shade of red.\n\n675\n00:35:03.005 --> 00:35:04.808\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n676\n00:35:04.808 --> 00:35:08.720\nwe're gonna call this Mike's Fw policy.\n\n677\n00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.220\n>> I like it.\n\n678\n00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.853\n>> All right so when we get in here just\nscroll down so we take a look at this.\n\n679\n00:35:22.809 --> 00:35:28.150\nWhat we're gonna see is that we have our\nEnable Windows firewall for domain private\n\n680\n00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:33.340\nand public profiles, so the free\nfirewall settings you'd normally have.\n\n681\n00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.120\nNot configured I just pulled\ndown the drop down menu on one,\n\n682\n00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.760\nwe could do yes to\nfigure any one of those.\n\n683\n00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.860\nBlock all incoming connections including\nthose in the list of allowed programs.\n\n684\n00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.840\nWe could do that again for\nthe domain private and\n\n685\n00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.110\npublic, notify a user when Windows\nfirewall blocks a program.\n\n686\n00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.530\nSo we have to go and configure what\nwe want to have happen there right?\n\n687\n00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:58.045\nSo let's go ahead, let's turn that on,\nor as my youngin says, turn it up.\n\n688\n00:35:58.045 --> 00:36:01.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz you know it's easy to be cool\n\n689\n00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.750\nwhen people have gone before you and\nbeen cool,\n\n690\n00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.180\nit's a lot harder to be cool when you're\ndoing it on your own, to start out.\n\n691\n00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.040\nI keep telling her that,\nshe doesn't believe me, but-\n\n692\n00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.900\n>> She didn't get it yet?\n\n693\n00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.490\n>> No, she doesn't.\n\n694\n00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:16.480\nSo I'm gonna click Yes across all three\njust configuring it in the public profile.\n\n695\n00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.760\nSo that way we can see that, but\nwe obviously have the ability to do it in\n\n696\n00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.740\nthe domain, the public or\nthe private profile.\n\n697\n00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.730\nSo these are the standard three\nthat we have in a Windows firewall,\n\n698\n00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:28.430\nwe are going to go ahead and click Next.\n\n699\n00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:31.310\nWe are going to come over here and\nwe are gonna click Next and\n\n700\n00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:36.690\nwe are going to just wait for\nthat to get created here.\n\n701\n00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.360\nWon't take very long, take but\na minute as they say.\n\n702\n00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:47.040\nAnd as soon as we get that we will\ngo ahead and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n703\n00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.850\nclick Continue there or\nrather click Finish, so\n\n704\n00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.610\nlet's just do that click Close\nthat's the one I was looking for.\n\n705\n00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.500\nSomewhere between Configuration and\nFinish, so\n\n706\n00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.590\nnow we have our policy there and\nso our policy has been set up.\n\n707\n00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:07.110\nPretty straightforward we can go in and\nlook at properties of it if we need to.\n\n708\n00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:11.990\nBring that up and we can just go in and\nwe can change the settings real simply\n\n709\n00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:15.370\njust by going back in there\nto the Profile Settings tab.\n\n710\n00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.556\nAnd if we have to we can go in and\n\n711\n00:37:16.556 --> 00:37:18.790\njust modify any of those if we\nneed to once we set that up.\n\n712\n00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:23.910\nSo we have all that and then once\nwe've done that, we now have to think\n\n713\n00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:28.810\nabout setting up and configuring\nthe endpoint protection client, right?\n\n714\n00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:32.290\nAnd so what we would have to do is\ninstall the client as the next step, so\n\n715\n00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.780\nwhat we'll do it,\nwe can do this from the command line, so\n\n716\n00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:36.960\nwe'll just take a look at how to do that.\n\n717\n00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.020\nWe'll just do that on the machine we're\non right here, no reason to go out and\n\n718\n00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.560\nchange that, we're gonna go run, or\ngo to the run line rather I should say.\n\n719\n00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:52.630\nAnd we'll open up a command prompt\nwith administrative privilege,\n\n720\n00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.840\nlet me just zoom in real quick see\nif you guys can see that okay.\n\n721\n00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.619\nShould we change the background\ncolor on that or\n\n722\n00:37:57.619 --> 00:37:59.136\nyou think that's gonna stand out okay?\n\n723\n00:37:59.136 --> 00:37:59.681\n>> I think it's okay.\n\n724\n00:37:59.681 --> 00:38:02.302\n>> Think black on or\nwhite on black rather would be alright?\n\n725\n00:38:02.302 --> 00:38:05.380\nAll right, so we'll do that no problem, so\nwhat we're gonna do is the following we're\n\n726\n00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.565\ngonna change directories in there so\nwe're gonna do a little cd.\n\n727\n00:38:08.565 --> 00:38:12.848\nC:/ and oh yes of course we have a lovely.\n\n728\n00:38:12.848 --> 00:38:17.757\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Path our program files Microsoft\n\n729\n00:38:17.757 --> 00:38:19.884\nconfiguration manager.\n\n730\n00:38:26.269 --> 00:38:32.829\nAnd then our client and should be able to\nthat, and inside the client area there,\n\n731\n00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:38.050\nlet's just do a quick DIR to\nlist what we got going on there.\n\n732\n00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.950\nSo we could show you what's in there and\n\n733\n00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.190\nthen I'll tell you what we\nare going to do with it.\n\n734\n00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:47.350\nSo, yeah, that actually works out real\nnice, so we do have a ccmsetup.exe,\n\n735\n00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:52.560\nwe also have a sc, actually right there.\n\n736\n00:38:52.560 --> 00:39:00.430\nThe scepinstall.exe, which is the system\ncenter endpoint install.exe executable.\n\n737\n00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.910\n>> Yeah.\n>> So we're gonna pull that one,\n\n738\n00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:04.630\nthat's the one we're gonna type\nthe command in for now and run that.\n\n739\n00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:08.030\nThat's the specific file we are going\nafter inside of that path, so\n\n740\n00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.910\nwe're gonna get that.\n\n741\n00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:13.190\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna just\ntype that in or do and select that one.\n\n742\n00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.014\nWhat you mean, what are you doing there?\n\n743\n00:39:14.014 --> 00:39:15.720\nOkay, that's, yeah, okay, there we go.\n\n744\n00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.960\nAll right, so SCEPinstall.exe.\n\n745\n00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.730\nNow if we do a forward slash f switch for\nsilent it'll install silently but\n\n746\n00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.630\nthen that's no fun cuz you guys\nwon't be able to see that and\n\n747\n00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:32.620\nof course when we do that then nobody\ngets to see the cool stuff that happens.\n\n748\n00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.508\nSo we're not gonna do that, we're gonna\nactually do this and we're gonna make sure\n\n749\n00:39:36.508 --> 00:39:40.040\nthat we're loud and proud and put it\nup on the screen, let everybody see it.\n\n750\n00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.814\nNow what you may notice, if you are\nfamiliar, aside from the fact that it says\n\n751\n00:39:44.814 --> 00:39:49.082\nit's already installed, which is\nnot what we want to take a look at.\n\n752\n00:39:49.082 --> 00:39:52.816\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I love it when live demos work the way\n\n753\n00:39:52.816 --> 00:39:54.587\nthey're supposed to.\n\n754\n00:39:54.587 --> 00:39:57.117\nWe'll run this on the other\nmachine where it's not already\n\n755\n00:39:57.117 --> 00:40:00.457\ninstalled in a minute because the notes\nin the lab guide obviously, clearly,\n\n756\n00:40:00.457 --> 00:40:03.485\nwere written by somebody who just\ndoesn't know how to pay attention.\n\n757\n00:40:03.485 --> 00:40:04.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But aside from that,\n\n758\n00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.895\nwhat I was gonna point out to you was that\nif you run on this, we run it like this,\n\n759\n00:40:08.895 --> 00:40:13.175\nand if you're familiar with\nthe install for either defender or if\n\n760\n00:40:13.175 --> 00:40:16.035\nyou remember old school, Windows Defender,\nor now Security Central's Defender,\n\n761\n00:40:16.035 --> 00:40:20.515\nif you ever had to actually install that\nproduct from scratch or do an update.\n\n762\n00:40:20.515 --> 00:40:23.345\nAnd it looks just like this,\nbecause essentially, it is this,\n\n763\n00:40:23.345 --> 00:40:26.863\nit's just this with the overlay for\nthe End Point Protection Client.\n\n764\n00:40:26.863 --> 00:40:29.565\nSo it's gonna look very similar,\nso we're gonna get out of this,\n\n765\n00:40:29.565 --> 00:40:32.560\nbecause obviously this has\nalready been installed.\n\n766\n00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.990\n>> Now I know we're doing this\nto show them how to do this,\n\n767\n00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.540\nbut if I was creative could we\n\n768\n00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.900\nuse system center configuration manager in\nour software portion to deploy this out?\n\n769\n00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.690\nDo we have to run this manually,\nlocally on each machine?\n\n770\n00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:45.600\n>> No we do not but we could.\n\n771\n00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.670\nThat's a very good point.\n\n772\n00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.410\nIt is an application client or\n\n773\n00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.410\nan application that we could\npackage up rather I should say.\n\n774\n00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.600\nAnd so\nwe actually could do that if we chose to.\n\n775\n00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.080\n>> Okay.\n\n776\n00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:54.630\nAbsolutely.\nSo\n\n777\n00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:58.590\nlet's go ahead let's\ntry that one more time.\n\n778\n00:40:58.590 --> 00:40:59.100\nShall we?\n\n779\n00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:03.820\nAlthough you know what actually what we\nneed to do, hold on just half a second.\n\n780\n00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.080\nAs they say.\n\n781\n00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.300\nPlus we need to connect.\n\n782\n00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.810\nThat is on plab sys right?\n\n783\n00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:17.187\nSo pl ab sys 01\n\n784\n00:41:17.187 --> 00:41:21.606\nand then.\n\n785\n00:41:21.606 --> 00:41:24.003\nAll right that is in program files and\n\n786\n00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:27.097\nthat was in\nMicrosoft Configuration Manager so\n\n787\n00:41:27.097 --> 00:41:32.470\nI'm gonna get smart about this I'm gonna\nclick the whole entire path again.\n\n788\n00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:36.560\nThat is just not happening cuz now,\nit was that, not a lot of fun but,\n\n789\n00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.010\nit just was not a lot of fun.\n\n790\n00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:43.030\nSo, we're gonna go to client and we're\ngoing to grab that, where is that the CP\n\n791\n00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:48.380\ninstaller right there so, we just run\nthat as administrator from there.\n\n792\n00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.720\nAnd there we go.\n\n793\n00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.370\nSo we're just gonna run that on the domain\ncontroller and show you that but\n\n794\n00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.920\ninstead of doing it from the command\nline having to type that whole path out.\n\n795\n00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.600\nWe'll just do it cuz fool\nme once shame on you.\n\n796\n00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.385\nFool me twice and I kill you.\n\n797\n00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:04.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As a you ever see who's that comedian\n\n798\n00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.050\nthat does the hand puppets?\n\n799\n00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.950\n>> Josh.\n\n800\n00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.130\n>> Ham?\n\n801\n00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.390\nJon Ham something him.\n\n802\n00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.350\n>> I know who you're talking about.\n\n803\n00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:11.810\n>> You with the.\n>> He's got the yes.\n\n804\n00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.798\n>> With the crazy the Mexican pepper.\n\n805\n00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:15.820\n>> Gosh I can't remember his name.\n\n806\n00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:17.580\n>> On the stick and he's got the old guy\n>> Yes.\n\n807\n00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.880\n>> who's really bitter.\n\n808\n00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.880\nAnd he's got Ahmed the terrorist.\n\n809\n00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.660\nThe terrorist right?\n\n810\n00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.882\n>> Yes I kill you.\n\n811\n00:42:21.882 --> 00:42:22.825\n>> He always goes around and kill you.\n\n812\n00:42:22.825 --> 00:42:23.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n813\n00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:26.200\none of the nights that I was here\nafter we got done working I went back\n\n814\n00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:29.315\nto the hotel cuz you\nknow I do that sometimes.\n\n815\n00:42:29.315 --> 00:42:32.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I actually for some reason,\n\n816\n00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.370\nI had the TV on,\nI was working in the back,\n\n817\n00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.400\nwas probably working on setting up\nsome of the demos we're doing, and\n\n818\n00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.620\nthey were running on Comedy Central or\nwhatever it was.\n\n819\n00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.540\nThey had him doing all of his shows,\n\n820\n00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.375\nbut they literally had about seven\nshows that were all different.\n\n821\n00:42:45.375 --> 00:42:46.380\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Running one back to\n\n822\n00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.310\nback to back to back.\n\n823\n00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.276\nSo I listened to about five hours-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n824\n00:42:49.276 --> 00:42:50.598\n>> Of him doing vignettes with Ahmed\n\n825\n00:42:50.598 --> 00:42:51.490\nthe terrorist.\n\n826\n00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:54.380\nAnd that they had one where he was\ntraveling all over the world doing shows\n\n827\n00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.610\nin all these different countries.\n\n828\n00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:59.110\nHe was in Israel, he was in the UAE,\nhe was in South Africa.\n\n829\n00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:03.130\nAnd it was just hilarious cuz he pulls\nout Ahmed the terrorist in the UAE and\n\n830\n00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.450\nin Saudi Arabia, and in Israel.\n\n831\n00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.760\nThis is actually a politically\nsensitive issue.\n\n832\n00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.060\nAnd so he was also in Malaysia and in\nMalaysia in particular cuz it was really\n\n833\n00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:17.130\nfunny in Malaysia they actually do this as\nan aside in the documentary on the show,\n\n834\n00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:21.040\nthe culture ministry came and said to\nhim before he does the show hey listen.\n\n835\n00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.350\nWe've got a very large Muslim population,\n\n836\n00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:26.620\nwanna be sensitive to that,\nyou can't pull Ahmed out, and\n\n837\n00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.760\nyou can't use him in the show because\nwe're worried you'll offend people.\n\n838\n00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.620\nSo he says okay whatever fine.\n\n839\n00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:36.110\nSo he pulls out Ahmed with a french\nbarret on and a mustache, and\n\n840\n00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.510\nhe's Ahmed's brother Pierre or\nsomething right.\n\n841\n00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:44.600\nAnd so they do the whole routine with\nthis like nasty French accent and\n\n842\n00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.290\nhe pretends to be this guy and\nI do the whole thing.\n\n843\n00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.970\nAnd then at the end he takes\nquestions from the audience.\n\n844\n00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.290\nSo you know he's always got questions.\n\n845\n00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:54.040\nSo somebody he reads these questions and\nhe's doing one of them and\n\n846\n00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.930\nthey said to him not only can you\nnot pull Achmed out and use him, but\n\n847\n00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.520\nyou can't even mention his name.\n\n848\n00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.960\nLike you can't use Achmed the terrorist\nspecifically you can't say that.\n\n849\n00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.890\nSo at one point one of the questions\nwas something like whatever, whatever,\n\n850\n00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.350\nwhatever, and\nAchmed the terrorist like at the end.\n\n851\n00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.310\nSo he reads it without thinking and\nhe says Achmed the terrorist.\n\n852\n00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:13.540\nAnd so then he does this whole five\nminute routine with his brother,\n\n853\n00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:17.570\nthe Parisian Ahmed, about whether or not\nhe was really there and where did he go.\n\n854\n00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.932\nIt was just hilarious.\n\n855\n00:44:18.932 --> 00:44:20.030\nIt was absolutely hilarious.\n\n856\n00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.810\n>> Jeff Dunham.\n\n857\n00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.110\n>> Yeah, there you go,\nthank you very much.\n\n858\n00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:22.770\nJeff Dunham.\n\n859\n00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:27.160\nSo if you've never seen his act,\nhe is an amazing ventriloquist, and\n\n860\n00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.270\nhe's got some amazing,\namazing characters that he does.\n\n861\n00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.730\nBut Achmed the Dead Terrorist,\n\n862\n00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:35.740\nwhich is basically a holiday\ndecoration of a skeleton, right?\n\n863\n00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.250\nIt's hilarious,\nit is absolutely hilarious.\n\n864\n00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.590\nSo anyway, I digress.\n\n865\n00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.470\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna run this.\n\n866\n00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.320\nBut we're gonna just click and\nlet you see what it looks like.\n\n867\n00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.410\nSo we're gonna click Next on this screen.\n\n868\n00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:50.350\nWe have EULA,\nan End-user License Agreement there, so\n\n869\n00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:53.360\nI'm just gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna accept that and.\n\n870\n00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.510\nI always wonder why they\nput the I decline there,\n\n871\n00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.750\nbecause like you've gone this far but\nyou're actually gonna say like no.\n\n872\n00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:04.440\nI wonder if like got usage data, just how\nmany people actually declined and opt out.\n\n873\n00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.800\nAnyway, so we have the Customer\nExperience Improvement Program\n\n874\n00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.180\nthe CIEP we're gonna opt out of that one.\n\n875\n00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.310\nCuz I do actually not wanna join that.\n\n876\n00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:15.460\nSo we're gonna go ahead we're\ngonna click next there then.\n\n877\n00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.960\nIt says in order to optimize our\ncomputer we probably need to scroll in\n\n878\n00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.030\njust a wee bit so you can see that.\n\n879\n00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.170\nIn order to optimize computer\nwe should use a firewall.\n\n880\n00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:28.506\nIf you do not have a firewall one\nwill be provided to you at no cost.\n\n881\n00:45:28.506 --> 00:45:31.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Our System Center Endpoint Protection\n\n882\n00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.360\ncould turn it on for you.\n\n883\n00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.590\nSo not only do we install the client, but\n\n884\n00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.830\nif the firewall's been turned off,\nwe will then go in and turn it on.\n\n885\n00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:39.830\n>> Right.\n>> So that is kind of cool as well, and\n\n886\n00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:43.610\nwe do recommend that we turn it on,\nso we'll follow instructions,\n\n887\n00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:46.070\ncuz we're good little system admins here\n>> We're gonna go ahead,\n\n888\n00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:47.110\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n889\n00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.520\nIt's gonna go ahead and\nit is ready to go ahead and\n\n890\n00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.290\ninstall just a quick check and\nthen it says okay, are you ready?\n\n891\n00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:55.960\nAnd it says hey, let's get going.\n\n892\n00:45:57.070 --> 00:45:58.860\nNow what it does tell us there.\n\n893\n00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:02.770\nThat is,\nwe may have other Anti-Malware Anti-virus\n\n894\n00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.780\nprogrammes that may conflict with,\nand prevent us from working.\n\n895\n00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.800\nHaving multiple antivirus search\nspiral programs may also cause\n\n896\n00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.236\nsevere performance issues.\n\n897\n00:46:10.236 --> 00:46:13.215\nWe recommend that you remove them,\nbut we're not gonna remove them for\n\n898\n00:46:13.215 --> 00:46:17.365\nyou because that would be in\nviolation of anti trust laws and\n\n899\n00:46:17.365 --> 00:46:19.835\nwe would get sued, so\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n900\n00:46:19.835 --> 00:46:25.265\nBut we do tell you that you should\nprobably get rid of them because\n\n901\n00:46:25.265 --> 00:46:28.215\nthere can be negative\nperformance consequences.\n\n902\n00:46:28.215 --> 00:46:31.920\nSo we start the install there\ndoesn't take very long right?\n\n903\n00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:37.650\nAnd then at the end of that you can see\nit says hey let me scan your computer for\n\n904\n00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.900\npotential threats.\n\n905\n00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.920\nSo let's click finish\nlet's let it do that.\n\n906\n00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.620\nThe reason I wanted to do that is that\nI wanted to show you the following.\n\n907\n00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.720\nThat should look familiar\nto you that interface,\n\n908\n00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.100\nbut what does it actually say right there?\n\n909\n00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.480\nRight as opposed to windows defender and\nor\n\n910\n00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.470\nWindows essentials,\nIt says System Center Endpoint Protection.\n\n911\n00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:58.830\n>> That's a great business model.\n\n912\n00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.640\nI can take one product,\nname it three different things, and-\n\n913\n00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.560\n>> And charge twice for it, right?\n\n914\n00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.680\nThat's the American way, by God.\n\n915\n00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.180\nAll right.\n\n916\n00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:07.918\nSo that's how we get that up and running.\n\n917\n00:47:07.918 --> 00:47:11.280\nThen it's gonna do a download,\ndo a scan, do the whole nine yards.\n\n918\n00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.490\nWhen we finish all that up,\nthen we'll be good.\n\n919\n00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.800\nNow, interesting and\nyou may wanna just take note of this.\n\n920\n00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.195\nI don't believe We\nactually wrote these down.\n\n921\n00:47:20.195 --> 00:47:20.720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n922\n00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.652\nI'm gonna give Michael a little to do,\nwe're not gonna do it now because these\n\n923\n00:47:23.652 --> 00:47:25.620\nare [INAUDIBLE] keys, and you're not\ngonna be able to type them all out.\n\n924\n00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.360\n>> Okay.\n>> But what I am gonna do is give the list\n\n925\n00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.100\nto Mike, and Mike is gonna promise,\nand he's gonna do this on camera so\n\n926\n00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.430\nhe has to actually do it-\n>> Scouts honor.\n\n927\n00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:34.465\n>> Yeah, scouts honor, right?\n\n928\n00:47:34.465 --> 00:47:36.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So Mike's gonna actually take\n\n929\n00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:40.090\nthe notes I have on the register keys and\nhe's gonna probably just put them up and\n\n930\n00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.050\nI don't know how you make him available,\nwe're gonna.\n\n931\n00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:44.058\n>> [CROSSTALK] The notes online\n>> Put on the notes online so,\n\n932\n00:47:44.058 --> 00:47:44.879\nyou can know what they are.\n\n933\n00:47:44.879 --> 00:47:48.119\nThe reason I'm saying that is that,\nsurprise,\n\n934\n00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:53.412\nyou may wanna know what the reds keys are\nat some point if you ever ask about them,\n\n935\n00:47:53.412 --> 00:47:55.879\nif you have to validate the install.\n\n936\n00:47:55.879 --> 00:47:58.427\nSo maybe good for you to know those,\nand I it was my fault and\n\n937\n00:47:58.427 --> 00:48:01.808\nI apologize cuz, normally I'm very good\nabout catching all that and Mike and\n\n938\n00:48:01.808 --> 00:48:04.550\nI coordinate a head of a time,\nwe have all written down.\n\n939\n00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:07.551\nI did not do that within this time so,\nyou can blame me for this one but\n\n940\n00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:10.447\nI'm gonna fix it cuz Mike's gonna\nmake sure he gives them to you so\n\n941\n00:48:10.447 --> 00:48:14.347\nwe'll tell you just, highlight generically\nwhere to look from them and what they are,\n\n942\n00:48:14.347 --> 00:48:16.322\nbut Mike will actually capture them for\nus.\n\n943\n00:48:16.322 --> 00:48:19.060\nSo I'm gonna go back in my machine\nhere while we're working and\n\n944\n00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.953\nwe're just going to the registry\nreal quick and I'll at least show\n\n945\n00:48:21.953 --> 00:48:25.489\nyou the general idea so let's just\nright-click on this while that's running.\n\n946\n00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:30.240\nCuz I love going into the registry\nlive while things are happening, and\n\n947\n00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.600\nreally seeing if we can\nscrew things up royally.\n\n948\n00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.862\nSo we'll do regedt32.\n\n949\n00:48:36.862 --> 00:48:39.779\nWhat's regedt, not regedit.\n\n950\n00:48:39.779 --> 00:48:41.360\nSee the reg editor regedit32.\n\n951\n00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:47.630\nSo we'll do R-E-G-E-D-T Perfect.\n\n952\n00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:49.430\nIf I could type that would\nbe helpful wouldn't it?\n\n953\n00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.930\nAll right.\n\n954\n00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:53.113\nThere we go, that's the one, all right.\n\n955\n00:48:53.113 --> 00:48:56.710\nSo we need regedt we'll open up the reg\neditor and then we're gonna go in and\n\n956\n00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:59.720\nlook at Hkey_local_machine software and\n\n957\n00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.760\nthat's the whole bunch of keys we're\ngonna look for are gonna be in there.\n\n958\n00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.860\nSo let me just scroll up, and\nget this to where we need to be.\n\n959\n00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:12.830\nHkey_local_machine software, Microsoft,\nand then Microsoft anti-malware.\n\n960\n00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:18.737\nSo let me see where we are right now,\nand perfect.\n\n961\n00:49:23.361 --> 00:49:25.250\nShould have that there, all right, yeah.\n\n962\n00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:30.055\nSo we've got those, so\nlet's just scroll down just a wee bit,\n\n963\n00:49:30.055 --> 00:49:32.696\nand we'll scroll back down here.\n\n964\n00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:40.860\nM, M, M, M, H, I, J, K, L.\n\n965\n00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:42.870\nMicrosoft Antimalware.\n\n966\n00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:47.030\nSo under Antimalware,\nlet me just open this up,\n\n967\n00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:51.250\nwe will have several different ones\nthat we will wanna take a look at.\n\n968\n00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:55.768\nWe will have, let me just highlight that,\n\n969\n00:49:55.768 --> 00:50:01.340\nthere, we will have There.\n\n970\n00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:05.270\nWe will have install time, and\nI'll zoom in so you can see these.\n\n971\n00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:09.650\nSo we're up under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,\nSoftware, Microsoft,\n\n972\n00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:11.860\nMicrosoft Antimalware.\n\n973\n00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:16.790\nAnd then we have InstallTime,\nwe have Scan which is\n\n974\n00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.650\nnot there right now cuz we're still\ndoing the scan, it hasn't finished yet.\n\n975\n00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:25.390\nSo that's why we don't see scan but\nwe would see it there for last scan run,\n\n976\n00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:30.710\nwe would be able to go in and look at\nlast scan type, last quick scan ID.\n\n977\n00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:34.420\nThose would all be over here up under scan\n\n978\n00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:38.400\non the left-hand side in that\nfolder right there under scan.\n\n979\n00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.160\nSo we can go on and\nwe can look at those and\n\n980\n00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.320\nwe can see that those keys being there and\nthat information being there\n\n981\n00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:48.540\nwill then allow us to know for sure that\neverything has been installed properly.\n\n982\n00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:52.500\nSo we've got about five or six keys that\nwe'll just make sure Mike has the ability\n\n983\n00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.230\nto be able to capture,\nso that way he knows\n\n984\n00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:59.240\nwhat it is that he needs to do just\nto put it into the notes for you.\n\n985\n00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.410\n>> Okay.\n>> All right, so with that,\n\n986\n00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:02.110\nlet me just get out of the registry,\nactually,\n\n987\n00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:03.720\nlet's just go back to the other machine.\n\n988\n00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.900\nMore importantly, get out of there and\n\n989\n00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:13.900\nwe will just get back to our console,\nthere we go, so we got all that.\n\n990\n00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.730\nSo, that's how we set all that up, what we\nwant to do is just quickly run through and\n\n991\n00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:19.270\njust summarize what we did for you.\n\n992\n00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.030\nI have a couple of those notes\nthat we always like to make, so\n\n993\n00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.560\nif we can go to Mike's machine for\njust a minute\n\n994\n00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.372\nwe'll just take a look at a couple of\nthose and make sure we got everything up.\n\n995\n00:51:26.372 --> 00:51:29.760\nSo Endpoint protection enables security\nand anti malware management for\n\n996\n00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.660\nthe configuration management clients\nas we know, so we have and use,\n\n997\n00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.810\nand support the following features.\n\n998\n00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:39.540\nThere we are able to, as you saw,\ndetect and remediate malware, rootkit,\n\n999\n00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.720\nspyware, network vulnerabilities,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n1000\n00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:47.270\nWe can manage the firewall settings,\nas I told you, we can download antimalware\n\n1001\n00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.630\ndefinitions and engine updates\nautomatically if we need to.\n\n1002\n00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.910\nWe created an automatic download\nrule to deal with that,\n\n1003\n00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:54.580\nso you guys saw how to see that.\n\n1004\n00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.610\nWe have extensive monitoring and\nreporting capabilities,\n\n1005\n00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:01.450\nwe have some feature prereqs I\nthink we have a list on that.\n\n1006\n00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:03.100\nSo we put that together,\n\n1007\n00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.960\nwe talked about these already\njust before we did the install.\n\n1008\n00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.968\nEndpoint protection point so\nyou saw me install and configure that,\n\n1009\n00:52:08.968 --> 00:52:12.700\nthe default or custom client settings,\nI showed you how to set those up.\n\n1010\n00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.990\nWe talked about the need for integrating\nthe software update point if you want to\n\n1011\n00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:18.000\ndo malware and anti malware support.\n\n1012\n00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.045\nSo we talked about that,\n\n1013\n00:52:19.045 --> 00:52:22.310\nmay have a reporting services\npoint if you want to do reports.\n\n1014\n00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:26.116\nAnd then you are going to need the\nlicense, and we talked about that as well,\n\n1015\n00:52:26.116 --> 00:52:30.120\nthe Endpoint protection workflow\nimplementing, pretty straightforward.\n\n1016\n00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:34.550\nYou saw me walk through this, we installed\nthe endpoint protection site roles,\n\n1017\n00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.910\nwhen we wanna have, we did that.\n\n1018\n00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:38.804\nWe created the collections if\nnecessary to be able to drive that,\n\n1019\n00:52:38.804 --> 00:52:40.446\nwe didn't really bother with that.\n\n1020\n00:52:40.446 --> 00:52:43.121\nWe just set it up and did it for\nAll Systems, but in the real world,\n\n1021\n00:52:43.121 --> 00:52:45.130\nyou wanna have your collections and\nset that up.\n\n1022\n00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:48.590\nWe did our alerts by collection,\nso, obviously, per collection,\n\n1023\n00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:50.780\nwhere we wanna do monitoring,\nwhich set those alerts up.\n\n1024\n00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:54.840\nWe cheated a little bit and just did\nit on All Systems just to get away\n\n1025\n00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.975\nfrom the fact that we don't really have a\nlot of collections already preconfigured.\n\n1026\n00:52:57.975 --> 00:53:01.300\nWe'll determine the source for\nobtaining updates from our definitions,\n\n1027\n00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.710\nthat's in the generic setup\ngonna come from Microsoft.\n\n1028\n00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:09.140\nWe will configure the policies, we took\na look at both anti-malware policies and\n\n1029\n00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.320\nfirewall policies, we do both.\n\n1030\n00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:16.220\nWe then went ahead and took a look\nat how to install the agent, and\n\n1031\n00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.320\nthen, we would set that up and\njust start the monitoring.\n\n1032\n00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.738\n>> So we went through and\ntalked about all that [COUGH] Pardon me.\n\n1033\n00:53:22.738 --> 00:53:26.797\nThe Endpoint protection site system role\nwhen we go ahead and we install that and\n\n1034\n00:53:26.797 --> 00:53:30.550\nwe did take a look at how to install that\nwe have to have that if we wanted to be\n\n1035\n00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:32.447\nable to manage the Endpoint client.\n\n1036\n00:53:32.447 --> 00:53:35.911\nSo without that role those center\nmanagement when we talked about that we\n\n1037\n00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:38.803\ninstalled it on the top of the hierarchy,\nso, in this case,\n\n1038\n00:53:38.803 --> 00:53:41.070\nwe installed that on the primary site.\n\n1039\n00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:43.790\nIf we are doing this in\na multisite hierarchy,\n\n1040\n00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:47.520\nit has to be installed at the very\ntop site of the hierarchy.\n\n1041\n00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:51.130\nSo that would be the central admin\nsite as opposed to the primary site\n\n1042\n00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:52.470\nif we're on a multi site hierarchy.\n\n1043\n00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:55.200\nSo do wanna make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n1044\n00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:00.451\nAnd then we can use the\nSMS_ENDPOINT_PROTECTION_MANAGER component,\n\n1045\n00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:03.710\nand the EPSetup.log\nfile to verify install.\n\n1046\n00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:07.610\nWe took a look at verifying install on the\nclient side by looking at the reg keys on\n\n1047\n00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:13.060\nthe client, this would be for the role on\nthe server side, just to be aware of that.\n\n1048\n00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.680\nWe obviously can monitor Endpoint\nprotection by looking at Endpoint\n\n1049\n00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.460\nprotection status, we can look at\nmalware detections through reporting.\n\n1050\n00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.020\nThere's also its different stuff\nwe could take a look at but\n\n1051\n00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.510\nwe just wanna be aware that\nwe did look at the policies.\n\n1052\n00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:29.770\nSo we took a look at those and\nthen we did go in and setup alerts.\n\n1053\n00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:33.170\nWe talked about how to do that, the\ndifferent kinds of alerts, your Malware is\n\n1054\n00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:37.950\ndetected, same type of Malware detected on\nthe number of computers, multiple types of\n\n1055\n00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:41.020\nMalware across multiple computers,\nyou have different options, right?\n\n1056\n00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.670\nSo we set all that up and that we could\nalso configure email notifications for\n\n1057\n00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.680\nalerts if we chose to,\nwe didn't do that part but\n\n1058\n00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.030\nthat will be up to us if we chose to.\n\n1059\n00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:51.212\nBe something we could do if we wanted\nto be able to send them off of\n\n1060\n00:54:51.212 --> 00:54:54.215\nthe system center console and\nhave it show up in our inbox and\n\n1061\n00:54:54.215 --> 00:54:57.118\nthen be able to know that they\nare happening in real time.\n\n1062\n00:54:57.118 --> 00:54:58.200\nIt's up to us.\n\n1063\n00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.696\n>> Okay, all right, Adam,\nanother great episode there.\n\n1064\n00:55:00.696 --> 00:55:04.988\nTaking a look at how we can Incorporate,\nI guess is a good word to say,\n\n1065\n00:55:04.988 --> 00:55:10.200\nEndpoint protection into our System\nCenter Configuration Manager 2012R2.\n\n1066\n00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.550\nAnd remember it's a kind of\na two pronged attack there,\n\n1067\n00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:17.510\nit lets us manage our anti malware\nas well as our firewall policies.\n\n1068\n00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:20.420\nAll right, very good, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed this episode.\n\n1069\n00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:25.016\nRemember, if you want to see one of\nAdam's classes live, give us a shout at,\n\n1070\n00:55:25.016 --> 00:55:26.447\nSeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n1071\n00:55:26.447 --> 00:55:28.862\nSigning off for this one,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n1072\n00:55:28.862 --> 00:55:30.696\n>> I am thoroughly protected.\n\n1073\n00:55:30.696 --> 00:55:31.987\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n1074\n00:55:31.987 --> 00:55:32.862\n>> Take care.\n\n1075\n00:55:32.862 --> 00:55:37.362\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.200\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.770\nToday, we're doing our\nSCCM 2012 R2 content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.040\nAnd, specifically, we're gonna be looking\nat a couple of odds and ends, some things\n\n6\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.150\nthat we kinda wanna combine up, or\ndon't really warrant their own episode.\n\n7\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.850\nAnd here to help us go over those odds and\nends is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.100\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.059\n>> Good, good, it's not quite spring yet,\nbut it's almost like spring cleaning when\n\n10\n00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.378\nwe talk about odds and ends,\nat least that's how I think about it.\n\n11\n00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:42.929\nThings, that as Mike indicated,\nare important but not important enough.\n\n12\n00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:44.703\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It kinda sucks when you tell somebody,\n\n13\n00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:46.970\nhey you're important, but\nnot important enough, right.\n\n14\n00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.470\nSo what we're really talking about is\nsimply things that we wanna spend a few\n\n15\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.990\nminutes making sure you're aware of, but\nin of themselves, on their own, probably\n\n16\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.180\ndon't rise to the level of, hey, let's do\na whole episode on how to do deployment.\n\n17\n00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.705\nLet's do a whole episode on\noperating system management.\n\n18\n00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:05.100\nBecause those are really important,\nvery deep, very, very important\n\n19\n00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.060\ntopics that from a real world perspective,\nyou're going to spend a lot of time on.\n\n20\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.620\nSome of the stuff we're\ngonna talk about here\n\n21\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.400\nare also potentially very important\nthings if you're doing them, but\n\n22\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.795\nthe majority of us probably don't really\nuse these features all that often.\n\n23\n00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:21.360\nAnd/or if we do, we're using them, and\nwe're pretty familiar with them already.\n\n24\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.200\nFor instance, one of the things that will\nbe in the category of I use them and\n\n25\n00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.560\nI'm probably familiar with\nthem is the remote tool set,\n\n26\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.680\nbeing able to remotely control\nthe machine through the agent.\n\n27\n00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.230\nSomething that's in the hey, I don't\nprobably use it very often if at all\n\n28\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.570\ncategory is Windows Intune, and\nusing that for mobile device management.\n\n29\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.590\nSo we'll take a look at it,\ntalk a bit about both,\n\n30\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.150\ngive you a sense of that,\ncombine some information that we have.\n\n31\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.765\nWe've created some charts, some diagrams\nfor you along with a trip out to the Web,\n\n32\n00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:51.330\nspecifically the Microsoft Intune site and\nto TechNet,\n\n33\n00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.000\nto give you some information just about\nthings that from a reference perspective\n\n34\n00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.480\nwould probably be valuable for\nyou to know.\n\n35\n00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.770\nAnd then when we're done with all that,\n\n36\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.140\nwe'll wrap that all up in\na nice little tidy bow.\n\n37\n00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.630\nAnd we will finish up our odds and ends\nconversation, get ready for some new and\n\n38\n00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.280\nexciting additional\nepisodes that will come up.\n\n39\n00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.240\nWe're gonna call them bonus episodes\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.310\n>> Because you're gonna then want to\n\n41\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.240\nreally consume them.\n\n42\n00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.105\nEven though we would of given them to you\nregardless, it doesn't really matter.\n\n43\n00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:16.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're going to make them seem\n\n44\n00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.280\nmore exciting than they are.\n\n45\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.100\nBut we do have in upcoming episodes,\n\n46\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.810\nwant to make sure you're aware of this,\noperating system deployment,\n\n47\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.150\none of those biggies,\nthat everyone wants to know about.\n\n48\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.090\nReally important to understand, we're\ngoing to spend some pretty significant\n\n49\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.078\ntime in there, doing a walk-through\nof how to do all that.\n\n50\n00:02:30.078 --> 00:02:33.431\nWe're also gonna talk about\nthe WSUS feature integration, so\n\n51\n00:02:33.431 --> 00:02:37.020\ndoing patch management through SSCM, and\nhow to go through and deal with that.\n\n52\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.150\nSo that's gonna be upcoming.\n\n53\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.760\nWe're also gonna take a look\nat endpoint management and\n\n54\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.380\nendpoint integration so that we're gonna\ntake a look at how to do the firewall and\n\n55\n00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.580\nthe anti-virus, anti-malware control\nthrough the endpoint solution,\n\n56\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.460\nif you're choosing a license and do that.\n\n57\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.870\nSo we've still got some really\ncool things to talk about.\n\n58\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.110\nWe just thought we'd fill in the gap\nhere with some of the odds and\n\n59\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.640\nends to just break up that\ndiscussion a little bit, if we\n\n60\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.685\ngive you all the exciting stuff up front,\nyou've got nothing to come back for later.\n\n61\n00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:03.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then we put the odds and\n\n62\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.890\nends at the end, and they are odd\nbecause nobody wants to see them, and\n\n63\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.810\nso they wind up being all on their own.\n\n64\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.090\nAnd so we didn't want that to happen,\nso being sensitive to their needs and\n\n65\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.810\nfeelings is what this is all about.\n\n66\n00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.293\nSo let's go ahead, let's jump in,\nlet's have our discussion.\n\n67\n00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:17.233\nA little bit about Windows Intune.\n\n68\n00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:21.875\nWhat I wanna do is I wanna go to\nthe website first, if we could, Mike.\n\n69\n00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:25.635\nLet's go to Mike's machine, and let's just\ntake a look at that Microsoft website.\n\n70\n00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:28.013\nSo, of the two websites\nwe're gonna show you,\n\n71\n00:03:28.013 --> 00:03:31.639\nthe first one here is the actual\nMicrosoft Windows Intune landing site,\n\n72\n00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.041\nwhere you go if you wanna find out\nabout the Windows Intune service.\n\n73\n00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:37.325\nI've referred to Windows Intune or\n\n74\n00:03:37.325 --> 00:03:41.300\nMicrosoft Intune a few times\nas being like SCCM light.\n\n75\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.440\nI've talked about it that way and\nsaid it's what you do if you want to get\n\n76\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.930\nthe software as a service\nsubscription model.\n\n77\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.455\nThe thought process being for x numbers\nof dollars a month, whatever it is per\n\n78\n00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:55.165\nendpoint, we give Microsoft the ability\nto manage our endpoints for us.\n\n79\n00:03:55.165 --> 00:04:00.415\nWe're not gonna deploy a full SCCM\ninstall and configuration solution.\n\n80\n00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:03.815\nBut, rather, we're simply gonna pay\nMicrosoft to do that on our behalf.\n\n81\n00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:08.002\nSo that's what Intune is when it\nstands on its own, as its own product.\n\n82\n00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:09.132\nAnd when you go to the website,\n\n83\n00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:12.752\nthere's an overview of how you can do\nmanagement of apps and devices there.\n\n84\n00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:17.592\nIt talks about all the features,\nthe capabilities, the business cases.\n\n85\n00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:19.766\nYou can read up in-depth on there.\n\n86\n00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:21.076\nFigure it all out, take a look.\n\n87\n00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:23.376\nIt's a great opportunity,\ngreat resource for\n\n88\n00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:27.416\nyou to understand a little bit more about\nwhat Microsoft offers there in market.\n\n89\n00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:30.956\nOn the top you got the Overview,\nyou got the Features area there.\n\n90\n00:04:30.956 --> 00:04:32.036\nYou got Purchasing,\n\n91\n00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:36.386\nif you want to see what it's costing,\nwhatever the current price is, etc.\n\n92\n00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:41.380\nBut, remember, this is separate from SCCM,\nthis is not part of SCCM directly.\n\n93\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.320\nWhen you buy direct from Microsoft\nin the SAS model you're effectively\n\n94\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.940\nasking Microsoft to take on\nthe management on your behalf.\n\n95\n00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.570\nWhen we wanna integrate the two,\nwe've talked about this\n\n96\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.780\na couple of times as well, where we\ncan go in and we can take the existing\n\n97\n00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.040\nWindows Intune subscription, which is\nwhat we refer to it as if you have one.\n\n98\n00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.790\nAnd let's just be clear before we\nbring that other site cuz I know\n\n99\n00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.980\nyou gonna get ready to bring\nthat up in just a second.\n\n100\n00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.300\nBut before we move to the other site that\ntalks about integrating this into SCCM,\n\n101\n00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.820\nlet me just make sure\nyou're clear on this.\n\n102\n00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.770\nIf you already have Windows Intune, and\nyou want to bring it under, or bring those\n\n103\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.490\ndevices that are managed in Windows Intune\nunder, management through SCCM,\n\n104\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.550\nthen what we're about to talk about\nmakes a lot of sense for you.\n\n105\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.870\nIf you don't have Windows Intune, and all\nyou're doing is deploying SCCM directly,\n\n106\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.245\nthen you can safely skip all\nthe stuff I'm about to say.\n\n107\n00:05:30.245 --> 00:05:32.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz none of it's gonna matter to you\n\n108\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.050\nbecause you're not gonna go out and\nbuy a Windows Intune subscription\n\n109\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.440\nto then manage a bunch of devices,\nto then integrate them into SCCM.\n\n110\n00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.780\nYou're just gonna simply integrate\nthem into SCCM directly, one time.\n\n111\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.810\nSo this conversation is really only\nabout people or organizations or\n\n112\n00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.450\nentities that have started out with\nWindows Intune, did not realize, or for\n\n113\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.130\nwhatever reason did not decide,\nthat they could invest directly in SCCM.\n\n114\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.770\nMaybe the timing was not right,\n\n115\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.690\nmaybe it was too expensive, maybe there\njust wasn't a perceived need at that time,\n\n116\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.820\nnumber of devices relatively small,\nbut that need has grown over time.\n\n117\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.579\nAnd we've done the cost-benefit\nanalysis and realized that for\n\n118\n00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:13.090\nx number of dollars per month,\nper device, we could go ahead and\n\n119\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.580\npurchase a small country as well\nas probably that software and\n\n120\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.060\nso, we've decided that we're gonna make\nthe leap in investing SCCM directly.\n\n121\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.230\nAs a result of that,\nwe now have a split thought process,\n\n122\n00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.334\nwe gotta bunch of,\nperhaps even all or the majority of,\n\n123\n00:06:27.334 --> 00:06:31.247\nour infrastructure managed through\nthe SAS model of Windows Intune.\n\n124\n00:06:31.247 --> 00:06:35.979\nWe wanna migrate, or somehow bring, that\ninfrastructure under management within\n\n125\n00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.109\nSCCM, and then probably add new\ninfrastructure as well, cuz we got smart\n\n126\n00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:44.630\nand said, hey, we're not gonna keep\npaying a monthly fee for everything.\n\n127\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.560\nLet's invest, buy the software,\nbring all that new stuff up in SCCM,\n\n128\n00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.250\nlet's get all that other stuff over.\n\n129\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.950\nNow you could do this a couple of ways.\n\n130\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.330\nYou could simply kill the Microsoft\nWindows Intune subscription off.\n\n131\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.630\nYou could effectively\nremove all those devices.\n\n132\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.950\nYou could then reintegrate\nthem into SECM directly,\n\n133\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.380\nand that would be one way to do it.\n\n134\n00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.970\nAnd that makes a lot of sense for\na lot of reasons.\n\n135\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.805\nBut you can also grab those\ndevices out of Windows Intune, and\n\n136\n00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:11.124\nyou can essentially migrate\nthem into SCCM one time,\n\n137\n00:07:11.124 --> 00:07:15.780\none way without having to disassociate\nthem and then re-add them.\n\n138\n00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.410\nIt's a question of what you wanna do.\n\n139\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.830\nIf you fall into this category,\n\n140\n00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.320\nif this is you,\nthen please continue paying attention.\n\n141\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.045\nIf it's not, you're gonna go and\nhave a coffee break.\n\n142\n00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:26.542\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're gonna find something to do,\n\n143\n00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:30.051\nmaybe color, take a little you time,\ndo you as they say, right.\n\n144\n00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:34.930\nAnd then when you come back after you've\nreally relaxed, perhaps a facial, right,\n\n145\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.089\nsomething of that nature, when you\nare relaxed and calm, come on back.\n\n146\n00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:41.808\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna talk about how to do\n\n147\n00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:44.641\nremote desktop management because\nthat will be of interest to you.\n\n148\n00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:45.934\nBut the next five minutes or so\n\n149\n00:07:45.934 --> 00:07:49.300\nof the conversation is actually just not\ngoing to really matter to you because\n\n150\n00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.379\nyou just don't have the reason to\nactually do this particular thing.\n\n151\n00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:55.768\nBut we do wanna show you where you\ncan find information, if you need to,\n\n152\n00:07:55.768 --> 00:07:57.021\njust to understand that.\n\n153\n00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:01.940\nSo the next website we're going to throw\nup here for you Is from the system center,\n\n154\n00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.719\nMicrosoft System Center, a tech center\non TechNet and this one is specifically\n\n155\n00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:11.010\nmanaging mobile devices with\nConfig Manager and Windows Intune.\n\n156\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.530\nThis is gonna give you a step by step,\n\n157\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.030\nblow by blow guide of how to go\nthrough and do the immigration.\n\n158\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.780\nYou actually will have to go out, take\nthe Windows Intune subscription you have,\n\n159\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.550\nuse the cloud connector in SCCM to connect\nout to that, gain ownership of it,\n\n160\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.070\ntransfer it into SCCM so\nthat you now manage a controller's devices\n\n161\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.510\nthat they're no longer manager\ncontrolled by Microsoft.\n\n162\n00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.280\nNo we talked about this in the very\nfirst episode that we did,\n\n163\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.810\nwhere I mentioned this and said okay,\nhey by the way, you can do this.\n\n164\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:37.570\nWe'll come to it later.\n\n165\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.240\nWe'll come back to it and just so\n\n166\n00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.730\nyou know that if you did this\nit's a one time one way trip.\n\n167\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.860\nBecause if you decide to migrate from\nWindows Intune into SCCM you can do that,\n\n168\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.160\nbut then Microsoft no\nlonger has the control and\n\n169\n00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.270\nthe capability to manage\nthose devices in Intune.\n\n170\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.100\nAnd then if you decided you wanted\nto go back the other way for\n\n171\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.070\nsome odd reason, you would have to\nreestablish a new subscription and\n\n172\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.760\nthen associate all those devices because\nthey're no longer managed by Microsoft.\n\n173\n00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.450\nSo there's just a couple odds and\n\n174\n00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.770\nends that are uniquely quirky to\nthis particular migration path.\n\n175\n00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.680\nYou want to read up on\nthem if this is you and\n\n176\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.490\nthis is something you're\ngoing to consider.\n\n177\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.100\nAll the details you need are going to\nbe on that website in front of you.\n\n178\n00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.160\nMake sure you know about this because\nyou are planning on doing it.\n\n179\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.960\nDefinitely do your due diligence,\ntake a look and\n\n180\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.380\nif you're going to be doing this,\nstudying up on it for the exam, and\n\n181\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.485\nI would suggest that you at least read up\non the general concept of integration.\n\n182\n00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:32.290\nW're not going to ask about\nWindows Intune separately, but\n\n183\n00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.675\nwe may may very well ask about how\nyou integrate it into SSCM, so\n\n184\n00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:37.405\nyou may want to take a look\nat this website either way.\n\n185\n00:09:37.405 --> 00:09:41.425\nJust get the updates and the general idea\nand the overview of what's involved, and\n\n186\n00:09:41.425 --> 00:09:42.465\nthen you should be good.\n\n187\n00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:46.245\nRemember, this is a very small piece\nof an incredibly large puzzle.\n\n188\n00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:49.015\nIn terms of the amount of time and\neffort that I would invest and spend,\n\n189\n00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:53.800\nin preparing to answer questions on this,\nit would be on the low end of the scale.\n\n190\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.470\nVersus things like application deployment,\noperating system deployment,\n\n191\n00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.170\nWSUS integration,\nkey core competencies of this product.\n\n192\n00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.740\nI would spend a lot more time on them than\nI would about something like this, but\n\n193\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.310\nI would at least wanna have a passing\nfamiliarity with it and know it.\n\n194\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.540\nSo just make sure you're\nfamiliar with that.\n\n195\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.880\nIn addition, we do have some list items,\nsome do's and don'ts, some bulleted items.\n\n196\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.370\nWe wanna go through with you here\njust with regards to various\n\n197\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:21.000\nthings that will be helpful for\nyou in the Windows Intune conversation.\n\n198\n00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.460\nAgain, if you are going to be thinking\nabout being able to just master this\n\n199\n00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.060\nknowledge of general awareness of it, then\nthese additional points we're throwing up\n\n200\n00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.490\non this screen over the next few\nminutes for you, are gonna be helpful.\n\n201\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.380\nSo what we see on the first one is just\nthe idea of the general thought process\n\n202\n00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.440\naround what config manager can\nhelp us to do from a mobile device\n\n203\n00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.870\nmanagement perspective.\n\n204\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.570\nWe can do enrollment through\nthe windows intune connector for\n\n205\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.930\nconfiguration manager, you'll see we can\nenroll and manage windows phones so,\n\n206\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.570\nwindows based mobile devices,\nwindows are key, android and iOS.\n\n207\n00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.920\nSo, as we talk about that\nwe have broad platform,\n\n208\n00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.900\na support multi-platform support,\nnotice Blackberry is not there.\n\n209\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.680\nBlackberry comes in through the BES server\nstill and are integrated directly, but\n\n210\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.340\ncan be managed there as well.\n\n211\n00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.718\nEnrollment by configuration manager.\n\n212\n00:11:06.718 --> 00:11:10.930\nWindows Phone 6.x the older version and\nthe Nokia Symbian\n\n213\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.420\nwe enroll those directly through config\nmanager, not through Windows Intune.\n\n214\n00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.580\nIntune does not manage those older ones it\nmanages only the newest ones at the top.\n\n215\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.000\nIf we have mobile device\nlegacy clients enroll rather\n\n216\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.180\nthey have an older device running\nWindows CE is what I meant to say.\n\n217\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.170\nI'm reading the left hand\n\n218\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.990\nside of the column when I should\nbe referencing the right.\n\n219\n00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.350\nIf we're using Windows CE we're gonna\nbe dealing with those under the older\n\n220\n00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.970\nlegacy client and devices that\nconnect through exchange active sync.\n\n221\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.630\nExchange service connectors, so Blackberry\nfor instance, could come in under that\n\n222\n00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.970\nbecause we can use the exchange\nactive sync connector to manage that.\n\n223\n00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.430\nSo this is how we would be\nintegrating those mobile devices,\n\n224\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.190\njust want to make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n225\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.670\nAnd David, yes, I did see that report\nactually and heard about that.\n\n226\n00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.500\nThe coloring books for\nadults can be very calming and\n\n227\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.245\nsoothing, so\nI think that is certainly something.\n\n228\n00:11:59.245 --> 00:11:59.975\n>> It's a new fad.\n\n229\n00:11:59.975 --> 00:12:02.602\nYou go into Books a Million and\nthey're everywhere.\n\n230\n00:12:02.602 --> 00:12:04.955\n>> There's a huge rack of\ncoloring books for adults.\n\n231\n00:12:04.955 --> 00:12:06.085\n>> It is.\nI think a fad\n\n232\n00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:07.965\nis a great way of thinking about that.\n\n233\n00:12:07.965 --> 00:12:08.865\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:12:08.865 --> 00:12:10.145\n>> Somebody got tired of trying to say\n\n235\n00:12:10.145 --> 00:12:12.495\nthat cloud computing is important so\nthey came up with a new.\n\n236\n00:12:12.495 --> 00:12:13.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or more innovative way.\n\n237\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.000\nThis is to just separate\nyou from your money.\n\n238\n00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.630\nSo our coloring books for adults is\ngonna be the theme there, I suppose.\n\n239\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.530\nAll right, so\nMobile Device Management requirements,\n\n240\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.230\nwhat are the requirements on your end\nthat you should be aware off here?\n\n241\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.862\nSo you'll see, supported mobile\ndevice OSs and methods on the left.\n\n242\n00:12:28.862 --> 00:12:32.110\nYou will see on the right supportive\nconfig manager versions importing,\n\n243\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.260\nthis the kind of thing we\nmay a drop a question on or\n\n244\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.400\nat least pull some detail out of, so we\nalways wanted just have this kind of stuff\n\n245\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.620\nfloating around in the back of your\nhead there's just be aware of that.\n\n246\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:47.095\nWe have Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows\nRT, we'll see system centered 12 R2,\n\n247\n00:12:47.095 --> 00:12:50.970\ngot Windows phone 8, Android 4,\nIOS 6 and 7, Android 7.\n\n248\n00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:55.390\nNotice we have System Center 12 R2,\nbut also 2012 with SP1,\n\n249\n00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:00.160\nso we can go reach a little further back\nthere, and then the exchange connector for\n\n250\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:07.090\nserver 13 and or the exchange connector\nfor server 2010 SP1 and notice that we\n\n251\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.410\nsupport both 12R2, 12SP1, and\nserver 12, SSCM server 12 there.\n\n252\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.470\nSo, depending on the device\nrequirements we have,\n\n253\n00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.545\nwe may be going further and\nfurther back in the timeline.\n\n254\n00:13:19.545 --> 00:13:21.105\nJust wanna make sure where were that.\n\n255\n00:13:21.105 --> 00:13:23.135\nSpeaking of connectors and\nhow things work,\n\n256\n00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:26.395\nI think we have a little designed graphic\nyou put together if I'm not mistaken\n\n257\n00:13:26.395 --> 00:13:29.475\nspecific to the exchange connector and\nhow it works.\n\n258\n00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.635\nIf you have not seen or\ninteract with the exchange,\n\n259\n00:13:31.635 --> 00:13:35.175\nI have to sync connector, it's actually\nwrote so, we straight forward, we have.\n\n260\n00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.300\nWe may want to zoom in just a touch to see\nthe detail on the middle servers there.\n\n261\n00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.800\nI'll narrate what they are but\njust so you can see what they are.\n\n262\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.270\nWe do have an exchange client access\nserver what's known as the cass server\n\n263\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.480\nwhich is effectively the front end for\n\n264\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.730\nExchange servers that\nare exposed to the web.\n\n265\n00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.590\nWe used to call these web front ends,\nthey've just changed names over iterations\n\n266\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.690\nof Microsoft architecture for Exchange,\nbut basically they are the front end\n\n267\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.300\nservers that you knock on the door from\nas a client to access the Exchange\n\n268\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.210\nservices on the back end on\nthe secure side of the network.\n\n269\n00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.250\nSo you're gonna get to\nyour mailbox server and\n\n270\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.680\nall the other stuff that\ngoes on behind that.\n\n271\n00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.420\nBut the client access server,\n\n272\n00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.200\nthe cast server is where all\nthe mobile devices come in, so there's\n\n273\n00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.410\ndevices on the bottom are simply streaming\ntheir connection requests up there.\n\n274\n00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.540\nAnd you'll see that off to the right\nfrom Exchange client access server,\n\n275\n00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.515\nwe have Exchange mailbox server cuz that's\nwhere we go to gain access to mail.\n\n276\n00:14:29.515 --> 00:14:32.885\nIf you go up above that there should\nbe an active directory domain server\n\n277\n00:14:32.885 --> 00:14:34.825\nto validate domain membership and\n\n278\n00:14:34.825 --> 00:14:39.545\noff to the left we have the configuration\nmanager site system server.\n\n279\n00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:44.680\nAnd so the idea is that\nthe Exchange box in the DMZ or\n\n280\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.010\nwherever you publish it and make it\navailable on the web is the entry point,\n\n281\n00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.560\nis the gateway for\nmultiple technology points for access.\n\n282\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.970\nIt allows us to get into Exchange, allows\nus to authentic through the use or for\n\n283\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:02.010\nthe use of Exchange through AD by proxy\nindirectly and it also allows us to\n\n284\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:07.210\nbe able to interact through the Exchange\nconnector up into SCCM to then\n\n285\n00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:12.060\nmanage those mobile devices that are not\nenrolled directly, but are enrolled\n\n286\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.560\nindirectly through access because they\nare alternate platform devices, with SSCM.\n\n287\n00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.680\nSo that gateway, that exchange\nclient access server becomes the key\n\n288\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.940\nto making sure that that\nintegration works correctly.\n\n289\n00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.420\nSo, we want to make sure that we're\ngoing to be aware of that, and\n\n290\n00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.320\njust be thinking about that.\n\n291\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.150\nWhat do we actually get to do if we\nare using The Windows Intune integration.\n\n292\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.890\nWhat are the management\ncapabilities we have there?\n\n293\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.771\nYou'll see via platform and by device,\nnow keep in mind, you may be watching this\n\n294\n00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:41.668\nseveral months down the road from the time\nthat we actually did this episode live.\n\n295\n00:15:41.668 --> 00:15:44.035\nThose versions on iOS and Android and\n\n296\n00:15:44.035 --> 00:15:48.690\nWindows will certainly update over\ntime and the longer stays in market,\n\n297\n00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:53.898\nthe more likely it is that those versions\nmay actually appear a little bit out of.\n\n298\n00:15:53.898 --> 00:15:55.932\nSync with what is currently available for\n\n299\n00:15:55.932 --> 00:15:58.498\ninstance Windows 10 is not\non that list right now.\n\n300\n00:15:58.498 --> 00:15:59.116\nSupport for\n\n301\n00:15:59.116 --> 00:16:03.530\nthat is just now starting to emerge but\nobviously will be added there over time.\n\n302\n00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.490\nSo just keep that in mind that obviously\nwhen you see this, this is a snapshot of\n\n303\n00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.990\na moment in time but it is important to\nat least put a stake in the ground and\n\n304\n00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.840\nsay you know at this point this is what we\ndid support with the caveat that says hey\n\n305\n00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.850\nif you need more accurate information for\nthe current modern day,\n\n306\n00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:22.770\n12 months after filming or whatever, go\nlook it up on the website we gave you and\n\n307\n00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.140\nyou will then be able to see what the most\nrecent version for support is right?\n\n308\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.595\nOr you obviously can contact your vendor\nand figure out if whether they offer\n\n309\n00:16:30.595 --> 00:16:33.955\nsupport if you got you some sort\nof a man of solution directly.\n\n310\n00:16:33.955 --> 00:16:36.985\nFor instance if you have subscribed\nto Windows Intune with Microsoft\n\n311\n00:16:36.985 --> 00:16:40.365\nyou check with them and see your current\nsupport levels are or Mike's graciously\n\n312\n00:16:40.365 --> 00:16:44.010\nvolunteered that if you email him\ndirectly, he will answer that question for\n\n313\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.970\nyou in 24 minutes or less,\nregardless of the time of day or night.\n\n314\n00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.635\n>> It's a see Adam at IT, no.\n\n315\n00:16:49.635 --> 00:16:50.140\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n316\n00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.010\nWe care at ITPro.TV.\n\n317\n00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:53.820\nAll right,\n\n318\n00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.370\nso on that Windows RT and/or Windows RT\n8.1, you'll see we have a column there.\n\n319\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.760\nWe can kinda see yes or no what is\nsupported and what is not by platform.\n\n320\n00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.590\nI'll leave that up to you guys to kind of\nreason through, I'm not going to bother to\n\n321\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:07.460\ndo the crosswalk for you, but\nyou get the general idea.\n\n322\n00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.170\nWe can do a bunch of different things for\ninstance hardware inventory support,\n\n323\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.770\nyou'll notice on every one except for\nthe Android platform currently.\n\n324\n00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.900\nAlthough that is changing with\nthe newer version of the tie in\n\n325\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.500\nof the most recent\nversion of the platform.\n\n326\n00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.250\nWe will be able to do hardware\ninventory as well, as some compliant\n\n327\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.790\nsettings ultimately, that integration\nis coming although it is not here yet.\n\n328\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.730\n>> Yes.\n>> But that is coming over time, so\n\n329\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.700\nhere's just something to consider, you can\nsee you've got Yes's is all aboard for\n\n330\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.350\nWindows as well as iOS\n>> So\n\n331\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.030\non the Apple side, we're fully integrated,\nAndroid is moving slowly but surely there.\n\n332\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:39.870\nSo just be aware of that,\n\n333\n00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.890\nwhat are the prerequisites to integrate\nwith the Windows Intune connector?\n\n334\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.980\nGotta sign up for the Windows Intune\norganizational account, in other words,\n\n335\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.840\nyou already gotta have a Windows Intune\nsubscription is what I'm suggesting,\n\n336\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.500\nas we've talked about.\n\n337\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.480\nIf you don't have that,\n\n338\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.230\nyou don't need this,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n339\n00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.670\n>> Just bring all the things in,\n\n340\n00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.100\nmanage them directly.\n\n341\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.700\nRemember, we're stating the obvious,\nand I'm violating my own rule,\n\n342\n00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.982\nabout hating stupidly obvious content, but\nI am just pointing it out to you because\n\n343\n00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:07.320\nit is important for you to know that the\nonly reason we are talking through this,\n\n344\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.270\nis the assumption that you already have\nthe Windows Intune solution setup.\n\n345\n00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.950\nAnd you're now gonna make sure\nyou integrate the two, so,\n\n346\n00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.970\nit would make sense that you would\nalready have a Windows Intune account.\n\n347\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:16.750\nSo just be aware of that,\n\n348\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.210\nyou obviously have to have the public\ncompany domain name in for Windows Intune.\n\n349\n00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.580\nConfigure that all, in other words,\n\n350\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.770\nthis is all the stuff that you would\ndo to sign up for Windows Intune.\n\n351\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.130\nAnd then as a result of that, you would\nhave to have all that and then you would\n\n352\n00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.400\nbring that information in, and configure\nthe Windows Intune connector from within\n\n353\n00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.180\nSCCM to then connect to your subscription\nand pull that information across.\n\n354\n00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.260\nAll right, so,\njust wanna make sure we're aware of that,\n\n355\n00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.940\nconfiguring the Windows Intune\nsubscription and Windows Intune connector.\n\n356\n00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.062\nSite system roles, when you're creating\nthat Windows Intune subscription,\n\n357\n00:18:46.062 --> 00:18:46.630\nwhat do we do?\n\n358\n00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.755\nSpecify the Windows Intune Administrator\naccount credentials.\n\n359\n00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:52.990\nAgain, assuming you have all this\nalready documented and set up,\n\n360\n00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.250\nallow config manager to manage\nthe Windows Intune subscription.\n\n361\n00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.830\nThis check box you have to specify that,\n\n362\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.740\nspecify the collection that\ncontains the mobile device users.\n\n363\n00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.410\nSo where are we gonna go to get that?\n\n364\n00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:06.160\nSpecify the mobile device operating\nsystems, you'll check that off or\n\n365\n00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.740\nselect that.\n\n366\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.150\nAnd then make sure the Windows Intune\nconnector site system role is deployed\n\n367\n00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.720\nbecause you have to deploy a site\nroll to take over and manage that.\n\n368\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.390\nSo want to make sure we're aware of that,\nhow do we enroll mobile devices?\n\n369\n00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.330\nSo again varying by platform\nthere are instructions there.\n\n370\n00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.360\nThat website we gave you for\nthe integration the technet website has\n\n371\n00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.580\ndetailed instructions on and probably the\nmost accurate and most current by the way\n\n372\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.880\ndetailed instructions on doing\nenrollment for all the device platforms.\n\n373\n00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.170\nSo I would refer you there overall,\n\n374\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.730\nwe've just summarized here to\ngive you a high level sense.\n\n375\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.430\nBut you can see that we will, for\n\n376\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.440\ninstance if you go down towards\nthe bottom there with Android\n\n377\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.420\nwhen you enroll after installing company\nportal app in Google Play store.\n\n378\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.550\nSo it depends on the nature of what\nplatform we're using cuz for iOS right\n\n379\n00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:58.870\nabove it, you'll see we have to navigate\nto m.manage.Microsoft.com In a device\n\n380\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.530\nbrowser we then have to use or rather the\nuser has to authenticate and has access.\n\n381\n00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.720\nWe'll try that again,\nuser authenticates and\n\n382\n00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.580\nhas access to the company portal or right\n\n383\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.670\nwe enroll after installing the company\nportal app from the Apple app store.\n\n384\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.990\nSo there's a couple of ways to do this it\ndepends, now if I was a betting man and\n\n385\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:22.450\nI was going to wager that on\nthis slide there was something\n\n386\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:27.520\nthat I would want to know, which one of\nthese things is not like all the others?\n\n387\n00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.120\nWhich one of these things does not belong?\n\n388\n00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.090\nRemember playing that game?\n\n389\n00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.310\n>> Yes, I do.\n>> When you were a kid?\n\n390\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.690\nIf I was betting, and\nI was wagering on, for\n\n391\n00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.650\ninstance, what I may want to\nfocus on if I was ever asked.\n\n392\n00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:45.480\nThere's an urban myth and legend that we\ntend to like to ask about URLs a great\n\n393\n00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.350\ndeal, and that we tend to like for\nyou to know what those special URLs are.\n\n394\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:56.820\nLike, I don't know, M.Manage.microsoft.com\nhypothetically for instance.\n\n395\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:02.050\nSo if I was a betting person I might\nwant to actually go through and\n\n396\n00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:07.875\npay attention to the difference there\nbetween the Windows RT and the iOS and\n\n397\n00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:13.405\nthe Android ones because they do all\ninvolve some sort of App Store relation.\n\n398\n00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:17.525\nBut one of them in particular involves a\nURL that may be unique to that particular\n\n399\n00:21:17.525 --> 00:21:20.284\napproach and we may wanna know that,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:21:20.284 --> 00:21:21.325\n>> In theory.\n\n401\n00:21:21.325 --> 00:21:25.325\nIndeed, indeed, so\njust wanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n402\n00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:29.730\nOptions for mobile device ownership on\ndevices that are not domain-joined.\n\n403\n00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.260\nWanna make sure we understand that if it's\na company owned device we can only do\n\n404\n00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.540\nsoftware inventory.\n\n405\n00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.090\nWe get software inventory collected.\n\n406\n00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.060\nIf we are a personal ownership category\ndevice, meaning it's personal device,\n\n407\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.050\nnot company owned, then we are only\ngonna be able to do inventory collection\n\n408\n00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.250\non the company content.\n\n409\n00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.660\nWe'll relieve personal content out of\nfiltering, we have done a great or\n\n410\n00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.330\nwe moved a great deal, or it's probably\nnot the best way of putting that.\n\n411\n00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:55.660\nWe have done a lot and\n\n412\n00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.200\nmove towards recently over the last let's\nsay maybe 24 months in this space towards\n\n413\n00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.810\nbeing able to segment between company\nowned and private data on a device.\n\n414\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.090\nYou may have heard the acronym cope,\nC-O-P-E, company owned personally\n\n415\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.440\nmanage a personally deployed device,\nmeaning that the company gives you\n\n416\n00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.390\na device but you have personal information\non it as well company information.\n\n417\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.160\nWe have done a great deal on most of these\nplatforms to be able to segment that\n\n418\n00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.310\ndifferentiator and split that down and\nonly pay attention to the company device\n\n419\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.720\nside of it and the personal information\nis left alone, we don't inventory that.\n\n420\n00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.140\nSo just wanna make sure we're aware\nof that and we can deal with that, so\n\n421\n00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.200\nwe do know or\ndo at least have knowledge of that.\n\n422\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.340\nWe can go in and through life cycle\nmanagement we have options to retiring,\n\n423\n00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.840\nwiping, do what's called selective wipe,\nwhich is the wipe of only certain data and\n\n424\n00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.610\nnot others.\n\n425\n00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.560\nWe can remove the device from\nconfiguration manager and/or\n\n426\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.540\nblock the device.\n\n427\n00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.070\nSo we have the ability to do any or\nall of these things as necessary.\n\n428\n00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.620\nAnd a little explanation of what means\non the right-hand side of that column.\n\n429\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.790\nI think you may be coming off the top one,\n\n430\n00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.510\nit may be hard to get all\nof them in there at once.\n\n431\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.610\nSo, maybe just making sure that everybody\ncan see at least enough screen time.\n\n432\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.640\nYeah, I was going to say,\njust enough screen time so\n\n433\n00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.960\nthey can see everything, right,\njust so we don't lose one.\n\n434\n00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.060\nBut obviously just making sure we\nknow what's going on there, and\n\n435\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:14.450\nthen if we have any legacy clients,\nmay wanna zoom back in for that one.\n\n436\n00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.120\nIf we have any legacy clients,\n\n437\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.259\nwe just wanna know that if we\nhave a Windows Mobile 6.x,\n\n438\n00:23:19.259 --> 00:23:24.980\nand/or a Nokia Symbian system, that we do\nhave a URL, or two URLs actually, that\n\n439\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.370\nwe would have to use to go to, and then\nbe able to do the enrollment from there.\n\n440\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.860\nYou'd have to bring that up on the device,\nand then follow the onscreen instructions,\n\n441\n00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.870\nbe able to effectively enroll.\n\n442\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.690\nSo, you just wanna make sure\nyou are aware of that, and\n\n443\n00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.760\nso that is something to be aware\nof unenrollment on those devices.\n\n444\n00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.870\nWe talked about that down at the bottom,\nis done by wiping the device.\n\n445\n00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.537\n>> Hm.\n>> So, enrollment is done through\n\n446\n00:23:45.537 --> 00:23:48.298\nthe website, unenrollment is\ndone by wiping on these devices.\n\n447\n00:23:48.298 --> 00:23:51.069\nAgain, little off in the corner\nkind of crazy stuff, but\n\n448\n00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:54.498\nthat's the kind of stuff that\nseparates the winners from the losers.\n\n449\n00:23:54.498 --> 00:23:57.108\nWith regards to passing\nexams more often than not.\n\n450\n00:23:57.108 --> 00:24:00.146\nSo I'm spending few minutes for\nyou on this particular topic,\n\n451\n00:24:00.146 --> 00:24:02.730\njust making sure that\nyou're familiar with it.\n\n452\n00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.530\nWe're also gonna wanna go ahead and wanna\nspend just a couple of minutes talking\n\n453\n00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.290\nabout remote control, power management,\nsome of those capabilities.\n\n454\n00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.560\nI know we put some additional\nstuff together on Mike's machine,\n\n455\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.110\nif we go back to Mike's machine, we're not\nquite done with that conversation yet.\n\n456\n00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.964\nWe're gonna go ahead and just quickly\ndeal with the ends portion of our odds.\n\n457\n00:24:19.964 --> 00:24:22.645\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> Now that we've done the odds,\n\n458\n00:24:22.645 --> 00:24:23.990\nwe're gonna do the ends.\n\n459\n00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.290\nSo a couple other things that we can so\nwith SCCM as well.\n\n460\n00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.160\nWe did talk about the fact that we\nhave a wake on LAN capability a few\n\n461\n00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.020\ntimes already.\n\n462\n00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.500\nSo we can do power management and do wake\non LAN here so we can do a wake up process\n\n463\n00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:41.710\nif necessary and the value of this\nis that in modern data centers,\n\n464\n00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:45.740\nthat we really are more and more today\nfocusing on greening initiatives and\n\n465\n00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.380\nfocusing on power management.\n\n466\n00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.820\nEspecially with the advent\nof virtualization and\n\n467\n00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.750\nCloud where we maybe spinning up large\nvolumes of instances using very high\n\n468\n00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:59.760\nlevels of resources for a very short\nperiods of time to do workloads.\n\n469\n00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.420\nAnd then bring those back down,\nso we can scale up, scale out or\n\n470\n00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.900\nscale down which is one of\nthe hallmarks of the cloud.\n\n471\n00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.950\nIt's elasticity that we often\nhear about and talk about.\n\n472\n00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:11.160\nAnd, so when we're doing that,\nwe're consuming huge volumes of power and\n\n473\n00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.980\nthen bringing them,\nbringing the system potentially down\n\n474\n00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.970\nagain is going to then save a tremendous\namount of resourcesand power.\n\n475\n00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.970\nSo power management has\nbecome a very big focus.\n\n476\n00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.030\nAll the major vendors do it in\nvirtualization cloud space, Amazon does,\n\n477\n00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.550\nGoogle does, Microsoft does,\nVMware does, Citrix does.\n\n478\n00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.700\nSo it's important for us to have\nthese capabilities here as well.\n\n479\n00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.820\nSo we can use this power on LAN, or\n\n480\n00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.800\nwake on LAN,\nwake up proxy function inside SCCM.\n\n481\n00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.530\nSo we can go ahead and\nbasically wake up the computer.\n\n482\n00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.970\nWe will go ahead and\njust ping that computer and say,\n\n483\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.620\nhey are you alive out there.\n\n484\n00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.700\nComputers that don't respond\nare assumed to be asleep.\n\n485\n00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.210\nAnd then we can go ahead and we can say\nthe ones that are awake become what's\n\n486\n00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:56.630\ncalled the awake or the up or alive or\nthe awake computers become managers.\n\n487\n00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.580\nAnd so we say those that are online,\nmanage all the others that are sleeping.\n\n488\n00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.880\nAnd then when we need to wake them up, the\nmanagers can go out and kinda rouse them,\n\n489\n00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.730\nget them online, and so the managers\nare gonna effectively become guardians or\n\n490\n00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.920\nkeepers, and they're gonna watch\nover the machines that are asleep.\n\n491\n00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.330\nWhen the guardian computer sends out a\nwake up packet to the sleeping computers,\n\n492\n00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.040\nthe sleeping computers wake up.\n\n493\n00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.600\nSo effectively what we're doing\nis we're just designating\n\n494\n00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.320\nmachines that are already online, doing\ntheir job and awake, as being sentinels\n\n495\n00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.260\nthat are gonna then issue wake up\ncommands to those that are sleeping.\n\n496\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.660\nCuz if we chose a machine that was\na asleep, and said, hey, wake up.\n\n497\n00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.430\nOkay, what you want?\n\n498\n00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.180\nI want you to stay awake,\nwell I'm sleeping.\n\n499\n00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.110\nYeah, well you can't go to sleep,\nstay awake.\n\n500\n00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.620\nWhy?\nCuz you have to make sure that everybody\n\n501\n00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.860\nelse that is asleep,\nwakes up when we tell you we want them to.\n\n502\n00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.845\nYeah, okay, right, cuz.\n\n503\n00:26:40.845 --> 00:26:42.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You woke me for that,\n\n504\n00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.010\nis what we're gonna hear.\n\n505\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.870\nSo instead we use machines\nthat are already awake.\n\n506\n00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.570\nAnd we just simply say hey by the way,\nin addition to all the other stuff you're\n\n507\n00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.550\ndoing, when we wanna wake up all\nthese other guys that were asleep,\n\n508\n00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.640\njust make sure you send out this special\npack that we're gonna send to you, and\n\n509\n00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.755\njust propagate it and\nthen it'll wake everybody up.\n\n510\n00:26:57.755 --> 00:26:58.940\n>> Nice.\n>> So that's what we're doing with\n\n511\n00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.050\nthe wake up proxy.\n\n512\n00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.980\nAnd in fact how do we monitor Wake-on-LAN?\n\n513\n00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.960\nSo we've got a bunch of information here.\n\n514\n00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.390\nWe actually wanna go probably\nto wide screen on this one.\n\n515\n00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.690\nTake me out for a minute so we can see.\n\n516\n00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:09.430\nYeah, thank you.\n\n517\n00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:10.580\nWe can see that a little bit easier.\n\n518\n00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.600\n>> Yeah [INAUDIBLE]\n>> No zoom out and\n\n519\n00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.620\nzoom in real quick, make the people\nout there, yeah make them dizzy.\n\n520\n00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.260\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n521\n00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.460\n>> No it's not you at all.\n\n522\n00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.370\nIt's not it must be you,\nit must be the eyes.\n\n523\n00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:20.080\n>> No, it's not me.\n\n524\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.940\n>> It looks perfectly fine to me.\n\n525\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.345\nI've had that happen once or twice.\n\n526\n00:27:23.345 --> 00:27:26.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when we are tinking or\n\n527\n00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.060\nthinking about tinking\nabout when we are thinking.\n\n528\n00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.157\nReally gotta stop talking, here.\n\n529\n00:27:30.157 --> 00:27:31.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's the end of the day.\n\n530\n00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:35.150\nMaybe I can draw some stick figures and\ntake people's minds off the fact that I\n\n531\n00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.360\ncan't pronounce the English\nwords properly.\n\n532\n00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.440\nSo when we are thinking about\nmonitoring this idea of Wake-on-LAN,\n\n533\n00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.900\nwhat do we have to be focused on?\n\n534\n00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.450\nYou can see here,\nwe have some report capabilities.\n\n535\n00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.460\nWe have some performance counters\nwe've put up there for you.\n\n536\n00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.070\nWe've got Configuration Manager\nsite server logs that are there.\n\n537\n00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.780\nWe've got Configuration Manager\nclient site logs that are there.\n\n538\n00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.920\nWe are gonna want to take notice of this.\n\n539\n00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.050\nAgain, something like,\n\n540\n00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:02.370\nhey is there a difference between\nthe logs on clients and servers?\n\n541\n00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.570\nThe answer is yes.\n\n542\n00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.070\nWhat kind of log is it and in what area?\n\n543\n00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.610\nMaybe good to know that.\n\n544\n00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.410\nWould I worry as much about\nthe fact that there are reports?\n\n545\n00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.720\nEh, we got reports, we got reports for\neverything, by the way.\n\n546\n00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.080\nWhat you had for breakfast this morning,\nSCCM can tell you that.\n\n547\n00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.575\nWe have a report for that, right?\n\n548\n00:28:18.575 --> 00:28:19.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we don't have to worry about\n\n549\n00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.570\nreports as much, but\nit's the odder kinda things.\n\n550\n00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.940\nLike, hey, by the way,\ndo we have performance counters for that?\n\n551\n00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.380\nThe fact that we do,\nthat's kind of unusual.\n\n552\n00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.010\nI may wanna make a note of that, because\nI may get asked about that unusual case.\n\n553\n00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.250\nAs suppose the common one will say well,\neverything has a report.\n\n554\n00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.860\nSo, performance counters,\nconfig manager site server logs,\n\n555\n00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.950\nconfig manager client logs,\nthose are probably important notes.\n\n556\n00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.290\nAs a matter of fact, I would zoom in for\na minute if I was you.\n\n557\n00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.590\nJust highlighting those three areas,\n\n558\n00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.800\nmake it a little bigger so,\neverybody can see what those are.\n\n559\n00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.380\nLet's not worry so much about the reports\nand let's just make sure that people know\n\n560\n00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.952\nthat those three things,\nthose three categories in particular,\n\n561\n00:28:53.952 --> 00:28:58.450\nmay be of importance here\nwith regards to Wake-on-LAN.\n\n562\n00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.566\nJust so that that way whoever's going\nthrough this, when you do review and\n\n563\n00:29:01.566 --> 00:29:04.680\nyour paused and your trying to make some\nnotes on what do I need to know to study,\n\n564\n00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.240\nmake sure I know this for the exam.\n\n565\n00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.020\nThose three things in particular\nwould probably be valuable for\n\n566\n00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.220\nyou to take a look at, right?\n\n567\n00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.255\nNow of course,\nI could be totally off my rocker here.\n\n568\n00:29:14.255 --> 00:29:15.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And out in left field,\n\n569\n00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.100\nI'm just saying that just because.\n\n570\n00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.730\nThat's not the case, by the way.\n\n571\n00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.430\nBut I was just saying that if it was.\n\n572\n00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.695\nYou would have no way of knowing.\n\n573\n00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so, prerequisites for\n\n574\n00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.180\nout of band management.\n\n575\n00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.795\nLet's just think about what goes\non with out of band management.\n\n576\n00:29:30.795 --> 00:29:32.195\nWhen we are thinking about this,\n\n577\n00:29:32.195 --> 00:29:36.025\nwe are thinking about dependencies that\nare external to the Configuration Manager.\n\n578\n00:29:36.025 --> 00:29:40.960\nWe obviously have to, if we're gonna do\nWake-on-LAN, have to have support for\n\n579\n00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.900\nthat on the hardware platform.\n\n580\n00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.271\nSo we need Intel vPro and/or AMT,\nthat actually should be AMD technology,\n\n581\n00:29:47.271 --> 00:29:49.745\nnot AMT tech, let me try it again.\n\n582\n00:29:49.745 --> 00:29:52.565\nClient support for\nIntel vPro and AMD technology.\n\n583\n00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.010\nAMD being the other chip manufacturer.\n\n584\n00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.740\nIt's just a typo on my part probably.\n\n585\n00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.630\nBut we always wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n586\n00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.630\nSo we do need to know that we have\nsupport for, by chip manufacturer and\n\n587\n00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:11.372\nby hardware platform support for the\nWake-on-LAN, whether it's with a DRAC or\n\n588\n00:30:11.372 --> 00:30:14.690\nan iLO, or you know,\na Wake-on-LAN solution, whatever it is.\n\n589\n00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.650\nThere's different technology implemented\nby different vendors that gets you to\n\n590\n00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.460\nthe same place, but you would have to\nsupport that, however that is set up.\n\n591\n00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.100\nAnd there is a compatibility list you\ncan look at on Microsoft website for\n\n592\n00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.772\nSCCM with these vendors that tells\nyou the latest support we have.\n\n593\n00:30:29.772 --> 00:30:31.090\nYou know, we're integrated with HP,\n\n594\n00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.840\nwe're integrated with a lot\nof the major vendors.\n\n595\n00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.300\nBut it varies by the level and the patch\nlevel that you're running for SCCM.\n\n596\n00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:44.070\nSo if you're on 2012 verses\n2012 SP1 verses 12 R2,\n\n597\n00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.861\nthere's updated support at every rev for\nadditional capabilities, and\n\n598\n00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:50.740\nso you'd have to make sure,\ndepending on the version you run,\n\n599\n00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.160\nthat you're up to date and you have\na sense of what that support looks like.\n\n600\n00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.800\nSo just be aware, in may vary\na little bit, but you go out and\n\n601\n00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.330\nyou figure that out,\nthat's relatively straight forward.\n\n602\n00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:59.700\nWe need AD DS and\n\n603\n00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:04.368\nPKI, we have to have certificate support\ncapabilities here, we need .NET Framework,\n\n604\n00:31:04.368 --> 00:31:07.540\nWindows Remote Management,\nthere's a bunch of stuff listed there.\n\n605\n00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.960\nIPv4 and appropriate router\nconfigurations, important as well.\n\n606\n00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.922\nWe have to have an enrollment point\nthat's installed and configured.\n\n607\n00:31:15.922 --> 00:31:18.480\nOut of ban service point that's\ninstalled and configured.\n\n608\n00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.480\nConfiguration manager client's installed.\n\n609\n00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.490\nThe out of ban management point\nis gonna allow us to manage.\n\n610\n00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:28.169\nNot just to be able to do the power on\npower off, but also be able to go out and\n\n611\n00:31:28.169 --> 00:31:32.240\nmanage these systems that are not\npart of our system normally.\n\n612\n00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.660\nThey're not gonna be managed directly but\nare managed through an alternate channel\n\n613\n00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.630\nand are trusted with certificates and\npresent themselves remotely.\n\n614\n00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.500\nThat's what out of band\nmanagement's gonna be all about.\n\n615\n00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.660\nSo just make sure you're aware of that so\nwe do have that capability.\n\n616\n00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.788\nSo wanna keep that in mind.\n\n617\n00:31:45.788 --> 00:31:49.938\nWe have different power plan options for\nmanaging power consumption.\n\n618\n00:31:49.938 --> 00:31:52.658\nThese are the four that exist,\njust so you know what they are.\n\n619\n00:31:52.658 --> 00:31:56.338\nBalanced, high performance,\npower saver, and/or customized.\n\n620\n00:31:56.338 --> 00:32:01.170\nSo when we set up the power plans or\nthe options, we program these in.\n\n621\n00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.910\nThese are pretty similar to\nwhat we would have on a local\n\n622\n00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.650\nmachine under power management.\n\n623\n00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.050\nWe're just effectively transporting\nit up one level to SSCM and\n\n624\n00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.570\nthen applying that in effect, if you think\nabout it, across the board to all systems.\n\n625\n00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:13.910\nThat's really what we're doing.\n\n626\n00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.610\nWhen we think about remote administration,\n\n627\n00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.090\nwe're thinking about the fact that we\nthree options for remote administration.\n\n628\n00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.620\nWe have remote control,\nremote desktop, and remote assistance.\n\n629\n00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.120\nWe're probably familiar\nwith two of these already.\n\n630\n00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.340\nRemote desktop, most of us have probably\nused at some point and/or seen.\n\n631\n00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.350\nMFTSC from the run line for\nthe terminal services client,\n\n632\n00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:36.080\nand we get the remote desktop using RDP.\n\n633\n00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.320\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n634\n00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.409\nThat's what that is, we're just\nusing that or have that capability.\n\n635\n00:32:40.409 --> 00:32:45.256\nRemote Assistance has been around probably\nsince Windows Vista, I wanna say,\n\n636\n00:32:45.256 --> 00:32:47.486\nat least, maybe even in-\n>> Yeah, XP-\n\n637\n00:32:47.486 --> 00:32:49.760\n>> Windows XP perhaps, I'm not sure.\n\n638\n00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.430\nBut it certainly has been around for\nsome time.\n\n639\n00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:57.430\nThat is gonna allow us to be able\nto do one of a couple of things,\n\n640\n00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:01.190\nwe can either invite somebody to come\nout and give us assistance by and\n\n641\n00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.470\nI love the thought process, you're right.\n\n642\n00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:07.100\nSo, my system's not working,\nI'm probably not be able to connect to\n\n643\n00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.460\nsomething like the web because I'm having\na bandwidth and/or configuration problem,\n\n644\n00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.870\nbut I should use Outlook to send\nyou an invitation to come and\n\n645\n00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:20.050\nhelp me, which is what Remote Assistance\nis basically predicated around.\n\n646\n00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.698\nI'm not gonna get in to\nthe fact that just, wow,\n\n647\n00:33:25.698 --> 00:33:29.670\nas both my daughters, but\nmy older one especially and\n\n648\n00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:33.810\nmy wife as well who's adopted this,\nwould say to me on occasion, wow.\n\n649\n00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.590\n>> Do they do the-\n>> No they don't do that.\n\n650\n00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.920\nThat's kind of scary, I haven't done that.\n\n651\n00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.530\nPlease don't show Mike doing that because\nI will start seeing that at home.\n\n652\n00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:44.149\nIf you see what he,\nthat is even scarier than what they do.\n\n653\n00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:48.813\nNo but I get the 15 year old\ncondescending wow with the daddy,\n\n654\n00:33:48.813 --> 00:33:52.069\nwhat are you thinking\ntwist to it on the end.\n\n655\n00:33:52.069 --> 00:33:56.083\nAnd then when it comes for\nmy wife, who is not quite fifteen,\n\n656\n00:33:56.083 --> 00:34:00.962\nI will not tell you how young or old she\nis but she is older than fifteen, but\n\n657\n00:34:00.962 --> 00:34:04.625\na lot younger than she would\nlet on to believe,right?\n\n658\n00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:07.930\nSo I get that from her but I get that from\nher with a condescension that only comes\n\n659\n00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:12.030\nfrom being with somebody for so many years\nthat you can look down your nose at them\n\n660\n00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.090\nand say, what an idiot you are,\nwithout having to say that.\n\n661\n00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:18.840\nSo I just think about this sometimes and\nI say well, remote assistance,\n\n662\n00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.740\nwhile it's there and it's still there,\nwhy on Earth do we still have this?\n\n663\n00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.510\nWe think about today,\nall the remote capabilities we have.\n\n664\n00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.825\nRemote desktop does make a lot of sense,\nbut\n\n665\n00:34:29.825 --> 00:34:32.274\nthe downside with a desktop\nis it kicks us out.\n\n666\n00:34:32.274 --> 00:34:36.170\nIn other words, right, if we get in, the\nperson that is connected is pushed out of\n\n667\n00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:40.010\nthe session and the help professional can\nsee what's going on and interact, but\n\n668\n00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.560\nthe user that's in there is blocked\nfrom able to interact in real-time.\n\n669\n00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.230\nSo I mean, I get the idea that Remote\nAssistance was designed to effectively\n\n670\n00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.980\nlet you do that simultaneously, so\nI see why it was done early on.\n\n671\n00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.170\nBut we got better solutions\ntoday that don't involve you\n\n672\n00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.420\nemailing me an invitation in\norder to be able to work, right?\n\n673\n00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:02.000\nSo we have Remote Control which allows\nthe help desk professional using the SCCM\n\n674\n00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.220\nagent to be able to, assuming we turn it\non in the default settings, allows us,\n\n675\n00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.510\ncuz it is turned off by default,\nallows us to go in and\n\n676\n00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.450\nhave a two way dialogue with the user,\nso the user can stay connected, and\n\n677\n00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.100\nwe effectively can shadow them and\nthey can see what's going on.\n\n678\n00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.120\nAnd we also have the additional compliance\nand safety solutions involved there,\n\n679\n00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.760\nwhere we have to opt in and ask for\npermission, so the user has to accept\n\n680\n00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.560\nthe inbound connection and say, yes, I\nwant to allow you to connect and help me.\n\n681\n00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.840\nAnd so we have all that.\n\n682\n00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.080\nSo that's what remote control is all\nabout, and that's the preferred method.\n\n683\n00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.190\nI don't think I can\nremember any of my clients\n\n684\n00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.890\nthat are actually using remote assistance.\n\n685\n00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.540\nIt's one of those things that's still\nthere, I get it, but the reality is it's\n\n686\n00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.970\none of those features that we just\nprobably don't really need anymore.\n\n687\n00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.390\nSo you just want to know it's there, but\nwe probably don't really have a need for\n\n688\n00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.360\nit, so just be aware of that.\n\n689\n00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.460\nSo we do have that.\n\n690\n00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.270\nI know, I think,\nwe put together a little graphic that just\n\n691\n00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:55.240\nshows us the Config Manager and\nkind of drops down on each one.\n\n692\n00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.300\nCan we zoom in just a wee bit there?\n\n693\n00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.620\nSo the Config Manager console,\n\n694\n00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.820\nRemote Desktop versus Remote Assistance,\nI already hit the highlights on this.\n\n695\n00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.850\nRemote Desktop clients don't have to\ninitiate a remote assistance request,\n\n696\n00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.860\nas we know, the level of access\ncan be centrally controlled.\n\n697\n00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.410\nWe just allow you to go in\nas the professional, but\n\n698\n00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:15.260\nas I said the downside is it kicks us out,\nmeaning the user,\n\n699\n00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.830\nyou can only have one session\ngoing on simultaneously.\n\n700\n00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:22.990\nWhereas remote assistance allows\nus to be able to go in and\n\n701\n00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.840\nis gonna allow us to invite\nsomebody to come in and help us.\n\n702\n00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.800\nSo that's good, but as I said,\n\n703\n00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.070\nthe downside there is we\nhave to invite somebody in.\n\n704\n00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.685\nWe may not have the communication and\nthe connectivity capabilities to do that.\n\n705\n00:36:33.685 --> 00:36:36.400\nWhereas the remote control agent,\nallows us to effectively\n\n706\n00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.620\njust take control in the system\neven if the users in trouble.\n\n707\n00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.077\nAs long as the agents able to communicate\nas the support professional from\n\n708\n00:36:43.077 --> 00:36:46.198\nthe console, we can actually go in and\ngain control of the system,\n\n709\n00:36:46.198 --> 00:36:47.559\nand interact and help them.\n\n710\n00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:52.437\nSo a lot of help desks, a lot of service\ndesks are actually starting to deploy SSCM\n\n711\n00:36:52.437 --> 00:36:57.175\nand systems center overall to get the full\nadvantage of monitoring with SCOM,\n\n712\n00:36:57.175 --> 00:37:01.020\nto get configuration manager,\nto get service level manager.\n\n713\n00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.096\nTo replace systems like Heat or Remedy, or\n\n714\n00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:06.729\nwhatever you may be using on the ticketing\nside, and their using the remote\n\n715\n00:37:06.729 --> 00:37:09.747\ncontrol feature to be able to go out and\nmanage those systems.\n\n716\n00:37:09.747 --> 00:37:13.509\nThat's one of the things we're seeing\na great increase in over the last 24,\n\n717\n00:37:13.509 --> 00:37:15.450\n36 months or so across the platforms.\n\n718\n00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.720\nJust be aware of that.\n\n719\n00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.620\nIf we are gonna remotely administer\na client, we're gonna go in,\n\n720\n00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.900\nI think we have a list for\nthis one, right?\n\n721\n00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.330\nThe next one down,\nremotely administering our methods, right?\n\n722\n00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.370\nSo we see we have\na config manager console,\n\n723\n00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:29.470\nas I said, we have the remote control\nviewer, I was just mentioning that.\n\n724\n00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:33.670\nWe also have a CmRcViewer.exe,\nwhich is gonna let us go in and\n\n725\n00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.932\nlaunch that directly and\nuse that if the agent is not available.\n\n726\n00:37:36.932 --> 00:37:42.470\nSo CmRcViewer can be used in place of\nan agent based management solution,\n\n727\n00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:43.430\nif we want to do that as well.\n\n728\n00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.008\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n729\n00:37:45.008 --> 00:37:47.962\nAnd then, I think we have one more for\nauditing remote access,\n\n730\n00:37:47.962 --> 00:37:49.599\nif I remember correctly, right?\n\n731\n00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:52.004\nSo we have a couple of reports\nthat are available there,\n\n732\n00:37:52.004 --> 00:37:55.350\njust to give you a general sense of\nwhat we can do and how we can use those.\n\n733\n00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.520\nAgain, we have reports for\nalmost everything, and\n\n734\n00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.280\nso we want to call your attention to the\nfact that there are reports that allow us\n\n735\n00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.750\nto see remote control and the computers\nthat are being remote controlled\n\n736\n00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:09.050\nby a specific user,\nand/or remote control information for\n\n737\n00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.739\nall the status messages around\nremote control and its use.\n\n738\n00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.490\nAll right, Adam, another great episode\nthere you know look at a couple of\n\n739\n00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:19.720\nthe things that maybe we don't use as\noften when we're doing our System Center\n\n740\n00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.900\nConfiguration Manager, but are important\nnonetheless, especially if we happen to be\n\n741\n00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.510\none of those few companies use them or\nif we're preparing for that exam, right?\n\n742\n00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.800\nThere definitely could be a few\nquestions on so it's important we,\n\n743\n00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.810\nat least of the high-level, have a good\nunderstanding and you're gracious enough\n\n744\n00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.790\nto point out a couple those things that we\nreally need to pay attention to as we're\n\n745\n00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.230\nstudying, getting ready for\nthat exam, so thank you for that.\n\n746\n00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.040\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n747\n00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.590\nRemember if you want to attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n748\n00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:47.000\nshoot us an email here\nat

00:00:18.492\nin today's episode we're gonna be\ncontinuing along the journey that is SCCM,\n\n4\n00:00:18.492 --> 00:00:21.990\nthat's right,\nsystem center configuration manager 2012.\n\n5\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.890\nAnd joining me in the studio today\nis none other than Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n6\n00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.145\nAdam, how are you doing and welcome.\n\n7\n00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.340\n>> [LAUGH] I'm good, Wes.\n\n8\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.130\nThat was a lot of excitement for\nso early in the morning.\n\n9\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.350\nBut I'm doing well, I'm doing well.\n\n10\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.360\nHopefully everybody out there is also.\n\n11\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.910\nWe're going to, as Wes said,\ncontinue discussing SCCM.\n\n12\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.300\nWe've been discussing all the different\nways in which we could deploy\n\n13\n00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.410\nthe SCCM infrastructure.\n\n14\n00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.130\nDeploy the clients on the Windows side and\n\n15\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.760\ntalk about reporting and\nall the various things that we need to do.\n\n16\n00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.630\nThought we'd take a little bit\nof a different tactic on this,\n\n17\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.320\nshow you a little extra added bonus if you\nwill, a little extra special information.\n\n18\n00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.860\nWe're to go into the world of Linux Unix.\n\n19\n00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.920\nWe're actually going to go ahead and\n\n20\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.030\nWes has been kind enough to offer\nto help me act as tour guide here.\n\n21\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.190\nWe're going to go ahead and we're going to\ntalk to you about how to actually deploy\n\n22\n00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.370\nthe Linux Unix client to,\nin the case, a Linux Unix machine.\n\n23\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.290\nAnd then set that for\nSCCM so we can manage it and\n\n24\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.310\ndo inventory another\nstuff that we wanna do.\n\n25\n00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.300\nDefault process is gonna\nbe essentially the same.\n\n26\n00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.250\nSame process we've used to do\nthe Windows-based client deployment.\n\n27\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.230\nSome minor differences,\n\n28\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.140\nwe're gonna use an install script,\nwe've gotta specify certain things.\n\n29\n00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.920\nWe're gonna make sure that once we've\ndone that, we go through and connect and\n\n30\n00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.950\nmake sure that the client\nis actually talking.\n\n31\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.960\nThat part's going to be fairly standard,\nbut\n\n32\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.180\nwe're going to walk you\nthrough the process.\n\n33\n00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.070\nWe're actually going to start by taking a\nlook out on the web in just a second, and\n\n34\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.550\ntalk to you about some of the do's and\ndon'ts.\n\n35\n00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.660\nGive you a reference point from\nMicrosoft on TechNet to show you steps,\n\n36\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.860\nsince this is the information\nthat may change overtime, right?\n\n37\n00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.230\nAs you do this based on the build and\nthe version of Linux,\n\n38\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.970\nthere are some little differences\nyou want to be aware of.\n\n39\n00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.060\nWhen we first came out with System Center\nConfig Manager 2012, this was done\n\n40\n00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.910\nusing an individual installation\npackage per build of Linux or Unix.\n\n41\n00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.050\nWhen we went to Cumulative Update 1, and\nthen into 2012 R2, we have a universal\n\n42\n00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.770\ninstaller that deals with the majority of\nthe Linux/UNIX installations out there.\n\n43\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.350\nThere are still some minor ones off in\nthe corner that we have to get a specified\n\n44\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.580\npackage for, so\nthere's been some changes over time.\n\n45\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.650\nWe want to note those,\nwant to be aware of those.\n\n46\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.070\nSo it's always good to go out to the Web,\n\n47\n00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.710\nalways good to check that\nauthoritative resource.\n\n48\n00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.610\nIn this case, it will be Microsoft,\nit'll be Technet.\n\n49\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.110\nWes, I know we talked about bringing that\nup, if we can go to Wes' desktop for\n\n50\n00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.960\njust a moment,\nwe're gonna show you where to go.\n\n51\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.190\nAnd remember as always we're gonna have\nthis url out in the show notes for you.\n\n52\n00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.770\nSo we're not gonna worry about hey,\n\n53\n00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.680\nsquinting into the camera trying to\nsee that right now, where is that.\n\n54\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.100\nBut we're gonna take a look at how\nto install clients on Linux and\n\n55\n00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.110\nUnix computers.\n\n56\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.910\nSo if we want to, and\nI know we can, scroll down, but\n\n57\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.610\ncan we zoom in as well a little\nbit while were talking?\n\n58\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.120\n>> We can, absolutely.\n\n59\n00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.700\n>> So let me just pont out a couple\nof things for all of you out there.\n\n60\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.340\nIn the first couple of paragraphs right\nup above where all those blue links are,\n\n61\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.130\nwe talk about the fact that\nwe're going to need and\n\n62\n00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.970\ninstall script as I just mentioned.\n\n63\n00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.160\nAnd the install script is downloaded\nas part of the client package.\n\n64\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.140\nSo when you download the client installer,\nthe universal installer at this point,\n\n65\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.440\nthe tar package or tar ball from\nMicrosoft, from the download center,\n\n66\n00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.730\nit comes with the install script and\nall the things that you're going to need.\n\n67\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.580\nThe install script,\nin the logical thought process and\n\n68\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.910\nease of use fashion we often see,\nis called nothing other than install.\n\n69\n00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.400\nSo it actually works very well,\nit's a script called install and\n\n70\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.920\nthey talk about that in\nthe couple of paragraphs here.\n\n71\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.010\nI think you can kinda see highlighted\nin bold the word install,\n\n72\n00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.660\nup to the upper left, right around there.\n\n73\n00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.970\nI think you're hovering right around it.\n\n74\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.040\nSo it talks about that script and\ntalks about what it is.\n\n75\n00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.890\nIt does tell us, and\nthere's a link right below that in blue.\n\n76\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.650\nNope, one more up off to the right there,\n\n77\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.230\nwhere we can get some of\nthe command line properties.\n\n78\n00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.700\nSo, if we need to go in and\nsee what the scripting support looks like\n\n79\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.610\nWhat the specific properties may be,\nwe want to call or use.\n\n80\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.340\nWe can click through.\n\n81\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.380\nWe're not going to do that now but\nwe could.\n\n82\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.950\nAnd we can get a listing\nof those parameters.\n\n83\n00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.000\nWe can also see the client\nsettings link right below that and\n\n84\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.240\nhow to manage clients\nusing the config manager.\n\n85\n00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.930\nSo there's a lot of links for various\nthings, things that will be important for\n\n86\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.150\nus to be aware of.\n\n87\n00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.270\nThere are links right below there for\nupgrading the client.\n\n88\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.880\nSo if we have an existing older\nversion of the Linux Unix client,\n\n89\n00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.380\nwanna upgrade to the newer one,\nwe could do that as well.\n\n90\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.730\nWe can also go ahead.\n\n91\n00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.796\nThat's okay,\nthe web is always updating constantly.\n\n92\n00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:22.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there's\n\n93\n00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.020\nalways refreshed information there.\n\n94\n00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.040\nSo we can go, we can look at upgrading.\n\n95\n00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.350\nWe can go ahead and we can see how\nto configure the required ports\n\n96\n00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.020\nwhich will be important for\nfirewall based communication.\n\n97\n00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.020\nThere's a link for that as we go down.\n\n98\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.090\nSo we just wanna be aware of some\nof the things that are going to\n\n99\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.220\nbe present in this documentation.\n\n100\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.850\nIf we have a need to do this,\n\n101\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.070\nit's always gonna be important\nto read up on as I said.\n\n102\n00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.430\nThe latest facts, the latest information,\n\n103\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.760\nthe latest little specified details\nbecause those the things typically\n\n104\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.840\nas we've talked about in prior episodes\nwith a tool like CCM as complex as it is.\n\n105\n00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.800\nAs full featured and as rich in terms of\nit's information management as it is.\n\n106\n00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.310\nThat may get us into trouble.\n\n107\n00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.410\nI have to do this for many many clients\nand you typically once we do it,\n\n108\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.850\nit doesn't take very long and\nit works very well.\n\n109\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.360\nBut the first time out if you're\nnot paying attention to it or\n\n110\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.940\nif your Windows-centric and\n\n111\n00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.480\nthis is something you don't do very\noften,it may take one or two times.\n\n112\n00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.990\nI'm going to show you when we get into\nthe lab environment in a couple of minutes\n\n113\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.320\none of the places you go off the rails\nif you're not paying attention.\n\n114\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.860\nLittle known but\nimportant fact the scripting setup and\n\n115\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.820\nthe script parameters are case sensitive\nin Linux [INAUDIBLE], for instance.\n\n116\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.270\nSo, we've gotta know that.\n\n117\n00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.730\nOtherwise, we're typing stuff in, and it's\nUniversal capital U, and you're typing\n\n118\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.140\nuniversal small u, and it doesn't find\nthe install package, which will happen.\n\n119\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.420\nAnd I can show you how that\nworks when we get in there.\n\n120\n00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.650\nSo, just be aware of the fact that\nreading up on this, as well as,\n\n121\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.120\nalthough we're gonna\ndo it in this episode.\n\n122\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.750\nBut we do have the client for the Mac,\nas well, we have Mac support.\n\n123\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.200\nSo we could go in and take a look at that\nand obviously follow the steps, there.\n\n124\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.500\nEssentially, it would be\nthe same thought process,\n\n125\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.200\neven though the install package\nwould be a little different.\n\n126\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.300\nAs we scroll down towards the bottom and\nwe just wanna think about,\n\n127\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.850\nwe've got that nice little box there,\na little bit further down.\n\n128\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:06.370\nThere we go.\n\n129\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.260\nWe've actually got the script and\nthe command line install parameters for\n\n130\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.580\nwhat the script will look like,\nthe ./install- and\n\n131\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.780\nthen we go off and we run through that.\n\n132\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.640\nWe're going to take a look at\nthat in the lab environment and\n\n133\n00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.350\nwe're actually going to do a demo for\nyou and\n\n134\n00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.180\ndo this installation\nlive in just a minute.\n\n135\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.250\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nshow you how this works.\n\n136\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.000\nBut the nice thing that I like about this,\n\n137\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.295\ncommand line on the left,\nactions on the right.\n\n138\n00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:30.795\nBreaks down the command line for us.\n\n139\n00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:33.485\nTells us exactly what\neach step is gonna be\n\n140\n00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:35.805\nwhat install does it's\nthe name of the script.\n\n141\n00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:39.215\nWhat the mp designation is which is\ncalling the management point and\n\n142\n00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:40.275\nconfiguring.\n\n143\n00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:43.020\nThe side code which tells us\nwhat side code we're gonna hit.\n\n144\n00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.760\nAnd then also,\nthe CCM universal installer script line,\n\n145\n00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.300\nwhich is gonna essentially give\nus the right application package.\n\n146\n00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.670\nAnd it gives us some information about\nhow to modify that if necessary.\n\n147\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.175\nIf we go down below that, and\ndown below all those nice little links.\n\n148\n00:06:58.175 --> 00:07:01.295\nWe're gonna see configuring required or\nrequested ports for\n\n149\n00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:02.880\nclients in the Linux units.\n\n150\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.365\nWe'll see that we, by default,\njust like on the Windows client,\n\n151\n00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:07.785\nwe'll be using Port 80 and Port 443.\n\n152\n00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:12.350\nSo https but we're also gonna see\nthat we can actually go in and\n\n153\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.480\nmodify those ports if necessary.\n\n154\n00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.610\nWe could specify the -httpport -httpsport\n\n155\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.600\ndesignation on the script,\nspecify numerical equivalent for the port.\n\n156\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.060\nAnd say we wanna do port 5719 or\nwhatever that may be, right?\n\n157\n00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.820\nWe can map that if we need to.\n\n158\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.170\nSo that's nice to know.\n\n159\n00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.810\nAnd then configuring the location or\n\n160\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.995\nconfiguring the location of the points at\nthe very bottom there We're able to go in\n\n161\n00:07:37.995 --> 00:07:41.055\nand we are able to see\nspecify the amount of report.\n\n162\n00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:43.745\nTells us as we saw up in\nthe action column on the script\n\n163\n00:07:43.745 --> 00:07:46.765\nthat we have to find that\nmanagement port by specifying it.\n\n164\n00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:50.072\nSo we want to know all of this\ninformation prior to getting it started.\n\n165\n00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:52.935\nBecause that's going to help us\nto understand how to actually do\n\n166\n00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:54.906\nthe things we need to do,\nto be successful.\n\n167\n00:07:54.906 --> 00:07:59.392\nSo why don't we go ahead and look ahead\nat the environment we've set up for it.\n\n168\n00:07:59.392 --> 00:08:00.909\nAs we've done in several of our episodes,\n\n169\n00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:03.154\nwe've got a nice little demo\nenvironment we're going to use.\n\n170\n00:08:03.154 --> 00:08:05.347\nWe're gonna take a look at\nhow to do the install, so\n\n171\n00:08:05.347 --> 00:08:08.500\nwe're gonna go to our lab machine,\nif we could, and throw that up.\n\n172\n00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.840\nYou're gonna see, and take a look with me,\nand we'll kinda go through and\n\n173\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.190\ndo a little test drive here.\n\n174\n00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.320\nWes, do you wanna actually do this?\n\n175\n00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.920\nYou wanna switch spots, so we can really\nscrew around with the people out there\n\n176\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.135\nwhen we come back and I'll be short,\nyou'll be tall but they won't see me.\n\n177\n00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:25.369\n>> Well, with the whole capitalization\nthing it might get me in trouble here\n\n178\n00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:26.736\ncoming from the Windows farm.\n\n179\n00:08:26.736 --> 00:08:27.835\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then,\n\n180\n00:08:27.835 --> 00:08:29.453\non top of it my typing abilities.\n\n181\n00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:30.555\nI think I'll let you drive for this one.\n\n182\n00:08:30.555 --> 00:08:31.163\n>> All right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n183\n00:08:31.163 --> 00:08:32.824\n>> Well, don't say I didn't offer, though.\n\n184\n00:08:32.824 --> 00:08:34.010\nThat's the most important thing.\n\n185\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.430\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to the machine.\n\n186\n00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.400\nAll right, so we're going to start taking\na look at the config manager server.\n\n187\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.530\nWe do have the config manager server,\nas you can see, the Windows desktop.\n\n188\n00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.860\nWe're in the SSCM console,\nwe'll go through there in just a minute.\n\n189\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.750\nWe've also got our Linux client,\nas you can see,\n\n190\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.930\nwe'll just switch over there,\nrunning a Sousa Enterprise Linux server,\n\n191\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.760\nand we'll log in there in a few minutes\nto actually get the install kicked off.\n\n192\n00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.140\nAnd we'll go through and\nsee that process run.\n\n193\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.740\nSo let's start over here.\n\n194\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.210\nWe're inside the SCCN console.\n\n195\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.320\nWe're in the administration workspace,\nand we're looking at,\n\n196\n00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.800\nunder hierarchy configuration,\nat boundaries.\n\n197\n00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.480\nAnd we'll see that we have our\ntwo boundaries already set up.\n\n198\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.990\nWe have our configuration manager site\nboundary, Active Directory base, and\n\n199\n00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.310\nwe have our default first site name\nboundary, Active Directory base.\n\n200\n00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.000\nAnd what we're gonna do now is go in and\ncreate a brand new boundary.\n\n201\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.890\nSo we'll just come up\nhere to our Admin tab and\n\n202\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.420\nwe're just gonna come over here,\ndo a Create Boundary.\n\n203\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.060\nWe're going to give our boundary a name,\nso let me just scroll down just a wee bit\n\n204\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.580\nthere, and we'll go ahead and\nwe will call this a Linux client.\n\n205\n00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.430\nYou can call this anything you like, as\nwe know, except let me scroll back up so\n\n206\n00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.120\nyou can actually see me typing.\n\n207\n00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.660\nThere we go.\n\n208\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.440\nThat will be better.\n\n209\n00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.810\nSo we can call this anything we'd\nlike in the Descriptive tag.\n\n210\n00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.440\nWe can call it Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck\nor anything that we would like.\n\n211\n00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.680\nThis is really just so we can keep track\nfor when we see it show up in the list.\n\n212\n00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.250\nSo it makes sense to name\nit something intuitively\n\n213\n00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.610\nthat tells people what it's for.\n\n214\n00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.800\nSo Linux Client's probably a good idea.\n\n215\n00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.850\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll just take a quick look and\n\n216\n00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.860\nremind ourselves of the different options\nhere on the pull down for the boundary.\n\n217\n00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.280\nWe've talked about these in\nthe episode where we went through and\n\n218\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.190\ntalked about how to install\nthe Windows client.\n\n219\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.380\nIt's going to be the same,\nIP subnet, Active Directory site,\n\n220\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.780\nIPv6 prefix and or/IP address range.\n\n221\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.430\nWe're gonna use an IP address range,\n\n222\n00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.040\nchange the settings in the console,\ndialog box and put an IP address in.\n\n223\n00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.472\nSpecifically in this case, a specifier to\ndesignate that we are going to use just\n\n224\n00:10:32.472 --> 00:10:37.033\na single IP cuz we're only installing one\nclimb; we're not going to actually make\n\n225\n00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:40.375\na range, but we're just simply\ngo ahead and use this one IP.\n\n226\n00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:44.840\nSo, 192.1683.40, we'll bracket that for\nthe start on the end,\n\n227\n00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.970\nessentially saying we only want\nthis one machine, nothing more.\n\n228\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.844\nWe're gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n229\n00:10:50.844 --> 00:10:53.680\nAre you an apply OK person or\njust an OK person.\n\n230\n00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.720\n>> I'm an OK person cuz\n\n231\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.860\nonce the dialogue box is done-\n>> It's done.\n\n232\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.700\n>> It's done, right.\n\n233\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.430\n>> People don't often realize that or\ndon't get the fact that it's essentially\n\n234\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.470\na two-step versus a one-step process\nto get to the same place, right?\n\n235\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.480\nSo we're going to go ahead and click OK.\n\n236\n00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.622\nCuz here at ITProTV,\nwe're all about saving you time.\n\n237\n00:11:09.622 --> 00:11:12.290\nAll right, and then we take that time and\nchew it up when we're talking\n\n238\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.200\nabout all the silly stuff we\ndo to go off on tangents.\n\n239\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.060\nSo it works out well.\n\n240\n00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.040\n[LAUGH] So, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n241\n00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.920\nwe are going to see that our\nboundary has now been created.\n\n242\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.530\nSo now that we have our boundary there,\n\n243\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:27.945\nwhat we're actually gonna do is we have to\ngo in and specify that we want to create,\n\n244\n00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:32.245\nor rather add, in a selected item\nto the existing boundary group.\n\n245\n00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:34.435\nSo what we're gonna do,\njust gonna scroll up a little bit so\n\n246\n00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:36.585\nwe can kind of see this all at once.\n\n247\n00:11:36.585 --> 00:11:39.305\nWe're gonna highlight our boundary and\nwe can right-click and\n\n248\n00:11:39.305 --> 00:11:41.570\nyou'll see we can add selected items, and\n\n249\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.780\nadd selected items to an existing boundary\ngroup or add to a new boundary group.\n\n250\n00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.290\nWe're gonna do existing boundary\ngroup cuz we're essentially gonna\n\n251\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.020\nput an item into this boundary group,\nright, so we wanna program that.\n\n252\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.840\nSo, we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click there.\n\n253\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.530\nWe'll give that just a second and\nyou'll see that\n\n254\n00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.780\nwe already have an existing item that\nhas been specified, local clients.\n\n255\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.840\nAnd we're gonna check that off,\nadd that into the boundary group, or\n\n256\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.030\nrather add the boundary group\ninto the boundary, I should say.\n\n257\n00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.940\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click OK on that, put that in.\n\n258\n00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.360\nThat doesn't take very long.\n\n259\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.460\nAs you've seen before,\nthat happens right away.\n\n260\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.120\nThen what we're gonna do is create\nan assign a network access account because\n\n261\n00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.900\nwe have to think through the logic\nof the fact that if we're doing\n\n262\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.960\nthis the first time we may not have\nan access account that's been set up and\n\n263\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.990\nit's been purposed for\nthis particular installation.\n\n264\n00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.590\nSo we're gonna walk through that process.\n\n265\n00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.090\nNow that's gonna involve us\ngoing into the Active Directory.\n\n266\n00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.103\nSo we're gonna go down here,\n\n267\n00:12:33.103 --> 00:12:36.140\nas soon as I can figure out how\nto navigate without selecting.\n\n268\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.090\nThere we go.\n\n269\n00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.820\nSo I hate those little pop out windows.\n\n270\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.442\nWe're gonna go to the Start menu.\n\n271\n00:12:41.442 --> 00:12:43.350\nWe're gonna go to Administrative Tools.\n\n272\n00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.890\nAnd we're gonna go to\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n273\n00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.010\nNow you can use ADAC as well,\n\n274\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.510\nif you have ADAC installed, the Active\nDirectory Administrative Center.\n\n275\n00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.820\nThere's different ways to do this.\n\n276\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.130\nAt the end of the day, you just need\nto get to your user manager for\n\n277\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.660\nAD and then create an account.\n\n278\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.702\nBut a lot of you, if you're using\nADAC on your newer systems,\n\n279\n00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:03.170\nare gonna be used to going in there and\ndoing that.\n\n280\n00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.987\nYou can do that right from ADAC.\n\n281\n00:13:04.987 --> 00:13:08.450\nIt doesn't need to be done from\nthe AD user computer tool.\n\n282\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.830\nWe just happen to have that tool set up,\nit's ready to go so\n\n283\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.880\nwe're going to use that.\n\n284\n00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.060\nWe're gonna see our domain here,\nConfigMgrDom.local, so\n\n285\n00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.450\nwe'd open up our domain.\n\n286\n00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.660\nIn this case, go down to the Users folder.\n\n287\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.410\nWe can create the user in any OU,\n\n288\n00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.380\nit's just that we're gonna put\nit into the general users OU\n\n289\n00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.210\nsince it's not gonna be an install,\nan admin account for install.\n\n290\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.070\nSo that way we can keep track of it.\n\n291\n00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.828\nSometimes we'll create a separate\nOU specific to SCCM, and\n\n292\n00:13:31.828 --> 00:13:33.680\nwe may put accounts in there.\n\n293\n00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.585\nIt really just depends on\nhow we wanna administer,\n\n294\n00:13:35.585 --> 00:13:37.190\nhow we wanna keep track of things, right?\n\n295\n00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.350\nBut keep it simple.\n\n296\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.660\nGenerically is usually\na good rule of thumb.\n\n297\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.800\nThat way,\nwe're not worrying about going around and\n\n298\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.990\nhaving to deal with all sorts of things\nthat may come up to get in the way.\n\n299\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.330\nDo keep in mind that if you create\na separate OU, you may have to worry about\n\n300\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:54.425\ngroup policies being applied there by\naccident, and/or just without realizing\n\n301\n00:13:54.425 --> 00:13:58.533\nat all the configuration that goes on when\nsomebody applies a default domain policy.\n\n302\n00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:01.295\nAnd that's gonna hit all\nusers regardless of OU, but\n\n303\n00:14:01.295 --> 00:14:03.195\nyou may not have to worry\nabout creating an exception.\n\n304\n00:14:03.195 --> 00:14:05.365\nSo you just want to keep in\nmind that that mixing and\n\n305\n00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:08.705\nmatching on the policies can\nsometimes get a little crazy, right?\n\n306\n00:14:08.705 --> 00:14:11.525\nSo we just wanna try to make\nsure we account for that, and\n\n307\n00:14:11.525 --> 00:14:14.225\nit would be easier to keep them\nin the generic OU for users.\n\n308\n00:14:14.225 --> 00:14:18.550\nAll right, so I'm going to call this,\nif I can spell correctly, Network,\n\n309\n00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:23.110\nwe'll call it Network Access account\ncuz that's what we're doing.\n\n310\n00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.689\nSo let's just go ahead and\nput that in there.\n\n311\n00:14:26.689 --> 00:14:30.731\nI'm the world's worst typer, right,\nand we'll use an abbreviation, naa for\n\n312\n00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:32.320\nnetwork access account.\n\n313\n00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.027\nAgain, call it anything you want, right.\n\n314\n00:14:34.027 --> 00:14:36.550\nI just like to try to keep\nthings streamlined and simple.\n\n315\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.313\nThat way I can keep track of it,\nI can search for it, I know what it is,\n\n316\n00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:41.345\nI don't have to worry about going and\nfinding it.\n\n317\n00:14:41.345 --> 00:14:42.950\nAll right, so we're gonna click next here.\n\n318\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.570\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nput in our password.\n\n319\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.263\nOur password's gonna be\nincredibly complex and important.\n\n320\n00:14:50.263 --> 00:14:54.000\nThe word password, lowercase,\nright, very, very simplistic.\n\n321\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.610\nBut for our purposes, easy to remember and\nmost importantly, easy for\n\n322\n00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.247\nme to type without screwing up.\n\n323\n00:14:59.247 --> 00:15:02.922\nWe're gonna uncheck, as we always do, the\nUser must change password on next logon.\n\n324\n00:15:02.922 --> 00:15:06.609\nWe're gonna go ahead and say, user cannot\nchange and password never expires,\n\n325\n00:15:06.609 --> 00:15:09.580\npretty standard configuration for\na service account.\n\n326\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.178\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click Next, we'll\nget that finished up, click Finish there.\n\n327\n00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:15.450\nWe'll get that created,\nthat'll pop in there,\n\n328\n00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.770\nand we'll trust in\nthe fact that it's there.\n\n329\n00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.332\nWe're not going to bother go verify that,\nwe'll know it is.\n\n330\n00:15:20.332 --> 00:15:23.060\nAll right, so now that we've done that,\nwe essentially are done with\n\n331\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.448\nthe Active Directory user computer tool,\nwe're not gonna worry too much about that.\n\n332\n00:15:26.448 --> 00:15:30.155\nWhat we're now gonna do is go in and\nwe're gonna configure the site components,\n\n333\n00:15:30.155 --> 00:15:32.020\nspecifically software distribution.\n\n334\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.660\nAnd we've got to go in and we've got to\nset up the use of that account and connect\n\n335\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.160\nto the share to make sure we can use the\naccount we just created, the MMAA account,\n\n336\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.880\nto actually drive the installation of\nthe software on the target client.\n\n337\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.450\nSo we're gonna set that piece up now.\n\n338\n00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.930\nSo now what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ncome down here to Site Configuration.\n\n339\n00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.889\nLet me just scroll down\nhere just a moment.\n\n340\n00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:55.839\nRight over here, Site Configuration, still\nin the Admin Workspace, by the way, right?\n\n341\n00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:57.125\nWe have not moved, as you know.\n\n342\n00:15:57.125 --> 00:15:58.766\nWe're gonna come over here to Sites.\n\n343\n00:15:58.766 --> 00:16:01.483\nClick on Sites, we'll see our site here.\n\n344\n00:16:01.483 --> 00:16:04.850\nI'm gonna right-click on,\ntry that one more time actually,\n\n345\n00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.655\npressing the mouse button,\nright-click on that.\n\n346\n00:16:07.655 --> 00:16:11.277\nAnd we're gonna come down here to\nConfigure Site Components, and we'll see,\n\n347\n00:16:11.277 --> 00:16:14.110\nlet me just scroll down just\na little bit so you could see that.\n\n348\n00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.860\nYou'll see that we have our site\ncomponents already installed here.\n\n349\n00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.940\nNow just remember as a quick aside,\nwe could have easily gone down below here,\n\n350\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.110\ntook a look at the site, and\nlooked at the roles already installed,\n\n351\n00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.240\nvalidated that we had a software\ndistribution point installed.\n\n352\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.780\nIn case we don't have one,\nwe may have to go ahead and\n\n353\n00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.340\nactually do a Add Site System Role up at\nthe top of the menu to get that set up.\n\n354\n00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.280\nWe've kinda done that already,\nassumed that that would be good,\n\n355\n00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.970\nshould have that built-in, so\nwe don't spend the time doing that.\n\n356\n00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.020\nSo we're gonna go ahead and just\nobviously set that up and configure it.\n\n357\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.180\nBut just reminding you that we may be\nat different points in the hierarchy,\n\n358\n00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.690\ndifferent points in the build.\n\n359\n00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.950\nWe may not have all these roles set\nup that we've talked about in some of\n\n360\n00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:55.810\nthe other set episodes or shows that we've\ndone that we would build all this out,\n\n361\n00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.200\nhave it configured ahead of time, and\nthen just simply add in what we need.\n\n362\n00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.790\nRight, so it may be a question\nof adding versus configuring,\n\n363\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.532\nand we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n364\n00:17:04.532 --> 00:17:05.540\nAll right, so we're going to go in and\n\n365\n00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.770\ndo the software distribution point here,\nclick on that.\n\n366\n00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.400\nWe'll scroll back up to get\nto the setting that we need,\n\n367\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.940\nand what we're going to be able to\ndo here is go to network access.\n\n368\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.230\nOkay, we're not gonna mess with\nany of these default settings.\n\n369\n00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.960\nThose are gonna be fine.\n\n370\n00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.920\nConcur distribution settings and\nmulticast retry,\n\n371\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.480\nthings like that,\nwe're not worried about that.\n\n372\n00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.220\nThose don't change cuz we\ngo from Linux to Windows.\n\n373\n00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.500\nBut instead, what we're gonna do is\nspecify the account that the network\n\n374\n00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.300\naccess will be driven under.\n\n375\n00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.220\nWe're gonna add new.\n\n376\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.810\nDo New Account here.\n\n377\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.370\nAnd we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna grab this account or\n\n378\n00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.290\nat least, put in the information\nwe need for this account.\n\n379\n00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.230\nSo, I like to, if I know the domain name,\n\n380\n00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.320\nI could type it all in, if I don't,\nI can go out and browse.\n\n381\n00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.480\nSo we just come in here, do NAA,\nwhich, remember, is the alias we used.\n\n382\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.635\nDo a quick check name,\nwe'll get that to set up, click here, and\n\n383\n00:17:57.635 --> 00:17:58.770\nthen it takes just a second.\n\n384\n00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.718\nWe'll see that pop in, there we go.\n\n385\n00:18:00.718 --> 00:18:06.225\nWe'll put in our password, the word\npassword, and we'll put that in twice.\n\n386\n00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:10.043\nNow, a lot of times, everybody'll\njust be tempted to hit OK here, and\n\n387\n00:18:10.043 --> 00:18:11.325\nwe don't go to Verify.\n\n388\n00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:14.914\nAnd Verify, as we've talked about in\nthe other installation show we did for\n\n389\n00:18:14.914 --> 00:18:16.785\nWindows, is also very important.\n\n390\n00:18:16.785 --> 00:18:19.935\nWe have to verify the network\naccess to the share,\n\n391\n00:18:19.935 --> 00:18:22.505\nwhere we actually wanna\nbe able to go ahead and\n\n392\n00:18:22.505 --> 00:18:26.390\nconnect to get the installation media,\nthe agent package, right?\n\n393\n00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.870\nSo we wanna make sure we have that.\n\n394\n00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.510\nSo we're gonna come in here,\nwe're gonna do a network share.\n\n395\n00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.320\nKeep in mind, as you can see here,\nthat although we have a pull down,\n\n396\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.310\nwe have no other options\nto verify against.\n\n397\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.360\nSo, it is gonna be a network share.\n\n398\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.160\nNow we could go out and browse, or if we\nknow the UNC, we could just type it in.\n\n399\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.098\nWe know what it is, so we'll start typing.\n\n400\n00:18:44.098 --> 00:18:48.120\nIt'll be primary1, and\nthen when we do that, we'll see a list.\n\n401\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.730\nBut we're gonna go to Lab Files,\n\n402\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.460\nthat's where we set our\ninstallation information up.\n\n403\n00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.510\nBut remember, in your world,\n\n404\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.860\nthat will be whatever UNC you've\nset up for your install packages.\n\n405\n00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.460\nSo, you'll have to know what that is,\nor be told what that is if you're not\n\n406\n00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.490\nthe one who's setting it up,\nyou're just simply configuring the client.\n\n407\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.682\nWe'll then hit Test Connection,\nwe'll wait for that.\n\n408\n00:19:06.682 --> 00:19:09.230\nWe wanna see the yes,\ngood, we did connect.\n\n409\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:15.279\nConnection was successful, click OK,\nthen click OK again, then click OK again.\n\n410\n00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:18.640\nSo that way we are able to put that\naccount in, have that set up, and\n\n411\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.852\nhave that configured.\n\n412\n00:19:19.852 --> 00:19:21.077\nNow that we've done that,\n\n413\n00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:24.330\nwe're gonna actually get into\nthe deployment part of our program.\n\n414\n00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.820\nWe've done all the background legwork,\n\n415\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.790\nessentially the plumbing has\nbeen set up and configured.\n\n416\n00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.500\nAnd what we can do now is switch\nover to our Linux client, and\n\n417\n00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.338\nget ready to actually pull\ndown the install and run that.\n\n418\n00:19:34.338 --> 00:19:37.980\nSo we're gonna come over here,\nand we're going to, this time,\n\n419\n00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.070\nmeaning to hit the pop out window,\nso we can actually see that.\n\n420\n00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.960\nSo, we're gonna go and do the following.\n\n421\n00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.930\nWe're gonna log in as root.\n\n422\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.760\nWe're going to put in our super secure\npassword of password as you can see, and\n\n423\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.240\nwe're gonna use the root account\nto get into the desktop.\n\n424\n00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.020\nAnd now what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n425\n00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.980\nwe're gonna change directories, right,\ncuz we have to get in essentially and\n\n426\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.450\nget to where we have our\ninstall information.\n\n427\n00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:08.077\nSo we're gonna do a cd, and\nthen we're gonna do our ConfigMgrAgent.\n\n428\n00:20:08.077 --> 00:20:14.328\nNow remember, things are case sensitive,\nright, so ConfigMGR, oops.\n\n429\n00:20:14.328 --> 00:20:19.760\nLet's make sure we spell that, Mgr,\nthere we go, cuz I can't type to save my\n\n430\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.750\nlife, Mgr, there we go,\nAgent with a capital A.\n\n431\n00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.990\nSo let's change into that, and then\n\n432\n00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.580\nlet's make sure that\nwe type the following.\n\n433\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.550\nActually, I didn't, no,\nthat didn't work, hold on one second,\n\n434\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.838\nI left a space in there, did I?\n\n435\n00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:41.276\nI think so, yes, I did.\n\n436\n00:20:41.276 --> 00:20:42.980\nSo let's fix that real quick.\n\n437\n00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.310\nThere we go.\n\n438\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.000\nThe spaces get you every time,\nright, [LAUGH] so\n\n439\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.550\nmake sure you pay attention to that.\n\n440\n00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.890\nLike I said,\nI cannot type to save my life.\n\n441\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.060\nOn a good day, I can perhaps type my\nname if I'm really paying attention\n\n442\n00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.810\nto what I'm doing.\n\n443\n00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.393\nAll right, so\n\n444\n00:20:55.393 --> 00:20:58.420\nthis is the part that we talked about\nwhere we have also case sensitivity.\n\n445\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.170\nIt's very important,\n\n446\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.630\nbut we gotta pay attention to\nthe actual parameters for the script.\n\n447\n00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.640\nWe're gonna call that install script,\nremember?\n\n448\n00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.870\nIt's called install.\n\n449\n00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.689\nSo we're gonna start by typing in ./,\nand then we're gonna go ahead and\n\n450\n00:21:09.689 --> 00:21:11.510\nwe're gonna type in install.\n\n451\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.350\nSo we're gonna do that,\nthat's gonna call our script.\n\n452\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.290\nWe're then going to specify mp for\nour management point.\n\n453\n00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.650\nWhat's our management point going to be?\n\n454\n00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.810\nWe're gonna put in our management point.\n\n455\n00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:22.900\nWe'll call that.\n\n456\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.554\nThat is\n\n457\n00:21:24.554 --> 00:21:33.419\nprimary1.configmgrdom.local.\n\n458\n00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:37.870\nAnd that should be configmgrdom.local,\ngood, we got that.\n\n459\n00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.546\nThen our site code, so\nwe'll put in our -sitecode.\n\n460\n00:21:42.546 --> 00:21:47.166\nOur site code will be MCM,\nall upper case, three letters.\n\n461\n00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:51.280\nThen we will do CCM for\nthe client package dash, and\n\n462\n00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.560\nthen we're gonna do our\nuniversal installer.\n\n463\n00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:01.738\nAnd so we're gonna call the Universalx,\n\n464\n00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:09.153\nand then our designation, 64.1.0.0 and\n\n465\n00:22:09.153 --> 00:22:13.214\n1.0.04580, and\n\n466\n00:22:13.214 --> 00:22:19.922\nthen .tar cuz this is a UNIX/Linux system,\n\n467\n00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:23.980\nand we are using a tar file,\n\n468\n00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.710\nas opposed to a zip file.\n\n469\n00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:31.360\nIt's essentially the same thing, but\non Linux units, we call them tarbalts.\n\n470\n00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.205\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n471\n00:22:32.205 --> 00:22:35.390\ngonna hit Enter on that,\nrun the click in there, rather.\n\n472\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.020\nGet our focus back in, hit Enter.\n\n473\n00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.310\nWhoops, hold on one second.\n\n474\n00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.530\nYep, just one second.\n\n475\n00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.470\nWe've got to do that, and\nI forgot to put a space there at the end.\n\n476\n00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:56.013\nAnd let's go all the way over, go back.\n\n477\n00:22:56.013 --> 00:23:02.307\nAnd then let's just do, well, oops,\nhold on a second, there we go,\n\n478\n00:23:02.307 --> 00:23:07.771\nand then let's just go back there,\nand let's just do that.\n\n479\n00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:13.610\nThere we go, that hopefully will kick off.\n\n480\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:14.513\nNo, what did I do?\n\n481\n00:23:14.513 --> 00:23:15.990\nArchive, file not found, all right.\n\n482\n00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.970\nSo I just have a wrong path somewhere.\n\n483\n00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.890\nSo let's make sure our\nstatement is correct.\n\n484\n00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.812\nInstall MP, and let's see, primary1,\n\n485\n00:23:25.812 --> 00:23:31.968\nconfigure manager config,\nconfigmgrdom.local,\n\n486\n00:23:31.968 --> 00:23:37.160\nwe got all that, so\nwe code MCM, that is MCM,\n\n487\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:43.885\nand then CCM-universal,\ndid I spell this incorrectly?\n\n488\n00:23:43.885 --> 00:23:47.461\nLet's see cuz there is a possibility\nthat that is the case.\n\n489\n00:23:47.461 --> 00:23:57.324\nUniversalx6410, that's why.\n\n490\n00:23:57.324 --> 00:24:00.389\nOkay, I forgot the period\nafter the last 0.\n\n491\n00:24:00.389 --> 00:24:02.339\nOkay, let's go there.\n\n492\n00:24:02.339 --> 00:24:04.429\nAnd let's do that.\n\n493\n00:24:04.429 --> 00:24:07.293\nThat's why you gotta pay\nattention to all the details.\n\n494\n00:24:07.293 --> 00:24:11.955\nThat should be there.\n\n495\n00:24:11.955 --> 00:24:13.300\n1.0.0.4580 tar.\n\n496\n00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:18.900\nAll right that looks\nlike it should be good.\n\n497\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.532\nOkay.\n\n498\n00:24:19.532 --> 00:24:22.090\nAnd then we just need\nour space to be fixed.\n\n499\n00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:27.950\nAnd we should be good to go.\n\n500\n00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.510\nLet's do that and that and\nwe are off and running.\n\n501\n00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.190\nThere we go.\n\n502\n00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.980\nOkay, so it's always,\n\n503\n00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.300\nas I said, the devil in the details trying\nto get those path statements correct.\n\n504\n00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.245\n[COUGH] Pardon me.\n\n505\n00:24:38.245 --> 00:24:40.145\nBecause I can see about oo hoo,\n\n506\n00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:43.465\njust a little little smidge of that screen\nwhile I'm typing it out for you guys.\n\n507\n00:24:43.465 --> 00:24:44.685\nIt's very small on my machine,\n\n508\n00:24:44.685 --> 00:24:47.972\neven though you guys are able to see\nit nicely up on the screen there.\n\n509\n00:24:47.972 --> 00:24:50.862\nSo now that we have all that set\nup it's all good and running.\n\n510\n00:24:50.862 --> 00:24:54.442\nWhat you'll see is we essentially\nvery quickly go through the script,\n\n511\n00:24:54.442 --> 00:24:57.722\ncheck the pre req,\nrun the pre install validator.\n\n512\n00:24:57.722 --> 00:25:01.102\nHey congratulations all good softwares\nthere we're off and running.\n\n513\n00:25:01.102 --> 00:25:02.342\nWe begin the install.\n\n514\n00:25:02.342 --> 00:25:03.592\nIt starts running the script.\n\n515\n00:25:03.592 --> 00:25:04.532\nIt executes it out.\n\n516\n00:25:04.532 --> 00:25:05.712\nDoes what it needs.\n\n517\n00:25:05.712 --> 00:25:07.972\nIt goes ahead and\nconfigures a couple of things.\n\n518\n00:25:07.972 --> 00:25:11.212\nAnd down at the bottom there you saw\nby the time I said hey we're off and\n\n519\n00:25:11.212 --> 00:25:12.920\nrunning it's almost already done.\n\n520\n00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.680\nYou could see their install\ncomplete down at the bottom.\n\n521\n00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.400\nThat's what we wanna see,\ninstallation complete is gonna\n\n522\n00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.510\nshow us that the agent has actually\nbeen installed and configured.\n\n523\n00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:26.618\nAnd now that we've done that we can\nactually go back in to our site server and\n\n524\n00:25:26.618 --> 00:25:27.280\nin theory.\n\n525\n00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.050\nAnd we're gonna give it a minute or two,\njust because we obviously have to wait for\n\n526\n00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.250\nit to report in.\n\n527\n00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:35.450\nBut essentially what will happen is in the\nreal world takes maybe five, 10 minutes.\n\n528\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.930\nEventually shows up in inventory, we're\ngonna start to see the client is there.\n\n529\n00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.320\nSo, let's go over to our site server.\n\n530\n00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.340\nCome back over here.\n\n531\n00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.930\nAnd on our site server,\nwe're gonna go into the Assets and\n\n532\n00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.780\nCompliance work space this time.\n\n533\n00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.910\nBecause in order to find a client,\nwe have to go in to a collection.\n\n534\n00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.560\nAnd we have to then essentially\nbe able to go in and\n\n535\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.630\ntake a look, and see whether it's there.\n\n536\n00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.970\nOr, in this case, a devices item because\nit's going to essentially first show up in\n\n537\n00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:05.270\nthe devices area, and then get added to\na collection if we decide to put it there.\n\n538\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.570\nSo, lets go to devices and\nwe'll wait for that.\n\n539\n00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.210\nAnd then when we come in here,\n\n540\n00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.590\nwhat we are going to look for\nIs we're going to look for Linux clients.\n\n541\n00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.370\nLet's just scroll down see if we see\nanything there and right in the middle\n\n542\n00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:22.100\nright sure enough I'll just highlight\nit for you is the Linux client, so\n\n543\n00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.965\nwe've been successful in putting\nthe Linux client into the system.\n\n544\n00:26:24.965 --> 00:26:28.465\nAnd we've been successful getting\nto recognize the sight code,\n\n545\n00:26:28.465 --> 00:26:31.625\nassociate with the database so\nwe can at least begin to see it.\n\n546\n00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:35.955\nNow we may decide that we want to\nnow go in and manage a client,\n\n547\n00:26:35.955 --> 00:26:38.325\ndeploy software to it,\nwhatever we're going to do.\n\n548\n00:26:38.325 --> 00:26:41.145\nBut let's just quickly\ntake a look at two things.\n\n549\n00:26:41.145 --> 00:26:43.515\nOne, let's look at the properties here.\n\n550\n00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:49.660\nAs we can with the client or\nthe agent on any system.\n\n551\n00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.900\nWe can see properties.\n\n552\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.660\nAnd we can see, you know,\nwhere the agent is installed.\n\n553\n00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.140\nWhat sites associated with\nthe localized time, right?\n\n554\n00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.560\nIn this case, the agent addition,\nUnix and Linux in the client version.\n\n555\n00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.900\nSo we can see, unlike a Windows edition,\nit's going to register there.\n\n556\n00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.420\nThe Mac would show the Mac.\n\n557\n00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.480\nFor that so\nwe would see those differences and\n\n558\n00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.650\nthen if we get out of here and\nwe right click and\n\n559\n00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:18.680\nclick cancel what we can also do\nhere is we can approve this client.\n\n560\n00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.060\nSo we can come in here and you'll see\nwe can click right here to approve or\n\n561\n00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.700\nblock right if we're feeling like we don't\nreally want that client in there after\n\n562\n00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.310\nall that work.\n\n563\n00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.030\nCuz you know, four times in on the script,\nit pissed me off,\n\n564\n00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.580\nI'm not interested in having it in\nthere anymore, I can get rid of it.\n\n565\n00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.230\nBut we're not gonna be that way.\n\n566\n00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.500\nSo we can actually approve it when\nwe click approve it says here, hey,\n\n567\n00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.670\nyou're about to approve this computer for\nmanagement by CCM in the hierarchy.\n\n568\n00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:47.030\nApproval means that you essentially trust\nthe computer, are you ready to do that?\n\n569\n00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.950\nNotice they have no okay reply,\nbut yes or no.\n\n570\n00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.430\nThey've streamlined this process as well.\n\n571\n00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.640\nSo we'll click yes.\n\n572\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.450\nAnd now that we've done that, we're going\nto allow this machine, this Linux based\n\n573\n00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:00.870\nclient, to actually become a client\nthat we can go out and do inventory on.\n\n574\n00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.600\nYou'll do all sorts of\nstuff on if we choose to.\n\n575\n00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.840\nSo being able to go out and\ninstall the agent,\n\n576\n00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.150\nwould now give us the launching pad\nto manage this client the same way.\n\n577\n00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.080\nWe could go back to the Linux client.\n\n578\n00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.720\nWe could go ahead and\nwe could ask it to do a policy update.\n\n579\n00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.700\nWe could go ahead and essentially,\nonce we do the initial policy retrieval,\n\n580\n00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.230\njust like we would do in Windows.\n\n581\n00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.260\nThis will be the equivalent, by the way,\nin the Windows client, right of right\n\n582\n00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.520\nclicking, going in or, not right clicking,\nbut going into the control panel,\n\n583\n00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.690\nrather, and then going in and\ndoing a client policy retrieval.\n\n584\n00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.398\nAnd once we've done that.\n\n585\n00:28:31.398 --> 00:28:35.780\nWe would then be able to ultimately come\nin and get a software, hardware inventory\n\n586\n00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.510\nover time, use the Explorer to\nsee all the resources in there.\n\n587\n00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.790\nAnything we've done with a Windows client\nwould essentially work the same way.\n\n588\n00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.160\nSo, we have the complete capabilities,\nonce we actually kick off and\n\n589\n00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.550\ndo the client install.\n\n590\n00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.850\n>> Great information there, Adam.\n\n591\n00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.140\nYou know,\nit's amazing how powerful this is,\n\n592\n00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.790\nthat it's not just restricted\nto just Windows clients, and\n\n593\n00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:57.690\nlike Adam's already mentioned here,\nwe can even manage IOS devices.\n\n594\n00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.590\nAdam, I do see, it looks like we're\ncoming to the end of another episode.\n\n595\n00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.480\nBut before we do leave,\nif we've got anybody out there\n\n596\n00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.390\nwatching now that decides that they\ndo want to support a Linux client,\n\n597\n00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.190\nyou got any parting words of wisdom for\nthem?\n\n598\n00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.200\nGo windows.\n\n599\n00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.290\nI'm only kidding,\nyou don't want to do that.\n\n600\n00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.520\nNo, if you are going to be\nsupporting Linux, Unix, clients.\n\n601\n00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.860\nBy the way I think it's great that\nwe have the cross-platform support.\n\n602\n00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.010\nAs Les was just pointing out.\n\n603\n00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.680\nI think it's great that as we see\nthe maturity of the product over time\n\n604\n00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.420\nfrom earlier versions of SSCM, what we\nwould think of as the 2007 version.\n\n605\n00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:33.280\nWhat we'd think of as being SMS and\nway way back in the old days\n\n606\n00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.460\nbefore it became apart of the official\nthought process around system center.\n\n607\n00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.150\nWe didn't always have\ncross platform support.\n\n608\n00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:42.610\nThis was essentially a Windows\nonly infrastructure and\n\n609\n00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:46.740\ninventory management or\nasset program until relatively recently.\n\n610\n00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.160\nAnd the fact that we see the growing and\ncontinued growth and\n\n611\n00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.530\nthe continued importance of Linux\nunits and alternative platforms.\n\n612\n00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.010\nPrimarily the Mac let's say for\ninstance, right?\n\n613\n00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.490\nThe fact that we can do that.\n\n614\n00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.290\nThe fact that on the mobile,\nand device side platform area,\n\n615\n00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:06.170\nwhere we can reach out and we can,\nthrough active sync, bring in information\n\n616\n00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.710\non your Windows devices as we've\ntalked about in prior episodes.\n\n617\n00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.979\nWe can bring in mobile devices\non the Android platform.\n\n618\n00:30:12.979 --> 00:30:17.970\nWe can bring in the MacIntosh or the Apple\nbased devices, the iOS based devices.\n\n619\n00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.400\nWe can see all of that at some degree.\n\n620\n00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.640\nSome varying degree of\nmanagement capability.\n\n621\n00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.310\nWe may not have full,complete\nmanagement capabilities.\n\n622\n00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.400\nThe way we do with Windows on\nevery device platform yet, but\n\n623\n00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.590\nwe're moving in that direction over time.\n\n624\n00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:33.860\nAnd as a result of that, it really\nopens up a world of possibilities for\n\n625\n00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:39.100\nus as administrators on the system center\nplatform over all, beyond just SECM.\n\n626\n00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.960\nOut beyond the Config Manager\nis just one piece of the puzzle.\n\n627\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.770\nYeah, we've talked about the fact that\nSystem center is a broad suite of\n\n628\n00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:46.490\napplications.\n\n629\n00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:50.170\nWe have what's called SCOM these days,\nSystem Center Ops Manager.\n\n630\n00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:54.010\nUsed to be called MOM, Microsoft Ops\nManager, prior to the advent of the full\n\n631\n00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.895\nSystem center sweet thought process\nthat does continuous monitoring.\n\n632\n00:30:57.895 --> 00:31:01.220\nWe've got the orchestrator that\ndoes work flow automation,\n\n633\n00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.000\nwe have got the system center\nvirtual machine manager\n\n634\n00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.370\nSCVMM that is the equivalent of\nthe vCenter a component on VMware.\n\n635\n00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:13.770\nSo it does essentially all up management\nof all virtualized infrastructure\n\n636\n00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:15.880\nusing Hyper -V as the hypervisor.\n\n637\n00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.050\nWe've got the system center\nservice level manager,\n\n638\n00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.200\nthe SLM product that does our\nhelp desk our ticketing and\n\n639\n00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.690\nour coordination, so\nyeah we've got all these different pieces.\n\n640\n00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.000\nAll of them are being\nintegrated number one and\n\n641\n00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.800\nall of them now are going to have\ncross-platform support number two.\n\n642\n00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.820\nWhich means that if we manage those Linux\nand Unix clients the way we just showed\n\n643\n00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.850\nyou here we can continuously\nmonitor them using SCOM.\n\n644\n00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.290\nWe could set up ticketing, and\n\n645\n00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.920\ntrack our incident and\nresponse management throughout SLM.\n\n646\n00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.910\nAnd we could virtualize\nthem using a CVM map,\n\n647\n00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.930\na complete resource management capability\nacross the entire infrastructure.\n\n648\n00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.770\nSo, my parting words of\nwisdom would really be,\n\n649\n00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:55.880\nlook to your infrastructure,\nlook to your cross-platform support, and\n\n650\n00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.460\nunderstand that this suite of\nproducts is really enterprise-ready.\n\n651\n00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.350\nAnd can do anything you need it to do.\n\n652\n00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.520\nAnd all you have to understand how\nto do is enable the support and\n\n653\n00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.860\nthen take advantage of it.\n\n654\n00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.210\n>> Great information as always.\n\n655\n00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.500\n>> Adam, thank you for being here and\n\n656\n00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.010\nmaking the complex a little\nbit more simplistic but\n\n657\n00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:14.960\nit does look like we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out here for ITProTV.\n\n658\n00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.530\nSo I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n659\n00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.490\n>> I actually like to think of it\nas making the simple complex but\n\n660\n00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.140\nthat's just me, that's how I\n>> prefer to view life, right?\n\n661\n00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.580\nGives me more things to talk about and\nkeeps me busy.\n\n662\n00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.420\nI'm your host, Mr.\nComplexity, Adam Gordon.\n\n663\n00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.440\n>> And, we'll see you next time.\n\n664\n00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.869\n>> Take care everybody.\n\n665\n00:32:29.869 -->

Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.690\nAnd in today's episode, we're gonna be\ncontinuing our journey through SCCM.\n\n5\n00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.150\nAnd joining me in the studio today\nis none other than Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n6\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.135\nHow are you doing today, Adam?\n\n7\n00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:25.230\n>> [LAUGH] I'm doing well.\n\n8\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.220\nThank you, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.990\nGood to see everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.620\nHopefully everybody's\ndoing well out there.\n\n11\n00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.360\nAnd hopefully you have a comfortable\nchair that you're sitting in.\n\n12\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.742\nThis is gonna be a bit\nof a long discussion.\n\n13\n00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:38.503\nWe're gonna walk you through what\nthe migration path looks like from SCCM\n\n14\n00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:40.433\n2007 into 2012 R2.\n\n15\n00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:44.370\nWe're gonna spend some time and Wes and\nI are gonna chat a little bit first.\n\n16\n00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.779\nHe's been kind enough to go out and\nfind all sorts of great documentation for\n\n17\n00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:51.451\nyou and we're gonna show you as well, how\nto do this, the right way to get it done,\n\n18\n00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.538\nthings you wanna know.\n\n19\n00:00:52.538 --> 00:00:56.152\nAnd then once we've done that and we've\ntaken a look at some pretty pictures,\n\n20\n00:00:56.152 --> 00:00:59.599\ntype out some do's and don'ts,\nwe're gonna go in as we usually try to do,\n\n21\n00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:03.078\nespecially with something like this,\nspin up a demo environment for you.\n\n22\n00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:06.703\nAnd we're gonna spend a nice amount\nof time walking through slowly but\n\n23\n00:01:06.703 --> 00:01:10.392\nsurely, talking about everything we\nneed to accomplish to ensure that\n\n24\n00:01:10.392 --> 00:01:14.410\nwe get successfully out of 2007\ninto our 2012 R2 environment.\n\n25\n00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.050\nAnd how we're gonna make that work.\n\n26\n00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.150\nSo that way, as we're done, and\n\n27\n00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.960\nwe finish that migration path, we've got\nall our infrastructure accounted for.\n\n28\n00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.510\nOur clients are migrated over,\nour distribution points are available.\n\n29\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.030\nWe've cleaned up all the backend\ndata after migration.\n\n30\n00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.868\nDisconnected, that connector that\npulls the data in from 2007.\n\n31\n00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:34.839\nOne of the most important things\nwe can do, ultimately, and\n\n32\n00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:36.380\nthen we'll be set to go.\n\n33\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.730\nSo let's kick this off by starting\nto talk about what a migration path\n\n34\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.930\nactually looks like.\n\n35\n00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.510\nAnd to that end, I believe we\nhave a nice little picture for\n\n36\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.890\nour friendly neighborhood folk\nout there in ITProTV land.\n\n37\n00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.371\nSo what we're gonna be able to see is,\nand actually I think we need to go,\n\n38\n00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.556\nget me out of that picture and\ngo full screen.\n\n39\n00:01:52.556 --> 00:01:53.425\nThere we go.\n\n40\n00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:57.280\nCuz you don't wanna look at me, you wanna\nlook at the diagram that we have for you.\n\n41\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.424\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna talk\nabout talk about the migration process.\n\n42\n00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:01.863\nNow on the left, as you can see labelled,\n\n43\n00:02:01.863 --> 00:02:06.490\njust to make sure we're all on the same\npage, we have our source hierarchy.\n\n44\n00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.778\nThat's our config manager\n2007 infrastructure.\n\n45\n00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:12.140\nWe're not gonna worry about those\ncolored lines for just a minute,\n\n46\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.750\nwe'll talk about those and\nhow they happen and why in just a second.\n\n47\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.350\nOn the right are new hierarchy\nis essentially our targets.\n\n48\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.020\nNow it does say config manager 2012.\n\n49\n00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.991\nIt could be 2012, 2012 SP1, 2012 R2.\n\n50\n00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:31.342\nWe just left it generic because\nthe migration path from any 2007 instance\n\n51\n00:02:31.342 --> 00:02:37.614\ninto the 12 X platform, 12, 12 SP1,12\nbar 2, is gonna look and feel the same.\n\n52\n00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:39.797\nSo as a result we're not\ntoo worried about that,\n\n53\n00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:42.580\nwe just wanna know it's moving\nto the 12 platform, right?\n\n54\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.850\nSo we're going to see that.\n\n55\n00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.682\nNow, let's also talk about some of the\ninfrastructure that we see there, and just\n\n56\n00:02:48.682 --> 00:02:53.307\nmake sure that we understand the names,\nand understand how we refer to things,\n\n57\n00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:57.060\nbecause in 2007 we would call\na primary site a central site.\n\n58\n00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.640\nAnd maybe we could zoom in real quick.\n\n59\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.680\nUpper left hand corner there, Wes.\n\n60\n00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.570\nOutstanding, right there.\n\n61\n00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.610\nYeah.\nAnd so we'll see that the central site,\n\n62\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.130\nwhich is the top of the hierarchy in 2007,\nis referred to as our primary site.\n\n63\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.910\nNow if we just simply\nmove right directly over.\n\n64\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.900\nRight, horizontally there.\n\n65\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.930\nPerfect, to the right.\n\n66\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.280\nWe'll see the central admin site in 2012,\nwhat we call the CAS.\n\n67\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.990\nNot to be confused with\nthe CAS we have for\n\n68\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.020\nthe client access points in\nthe exchange infrastructure,\n\n69\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.980\nactually we have a CAS there as well,\nwe're not gonna worry about that.\n\n70\n00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.340\nBut the idea is the same,\nwe have our central admin site there and\n\n71\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.230\nthen notice primary sites are below\nthe central admin site In 2012.\n\n72\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.780\nNow we've talked a lot in our overview\nepisode in our architecture episodes.\n\n73\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.150\nWe have two of them that we put together\nfor you on this particular solution.\n\n74\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.440\nThat the primary site is going to\nbe usually the top of the hierarchy\n\n75\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.340\nin a small environment.\n\n76\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.820\nBut if we do in 2012 setup\na scaled enterprise environment,\n\n77\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.070\nwe put the central admin site in place,\n\n78\n00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.080\nto have essentially aggregation\nof all the primary sites, plural,\n\n79\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.170\ninformation and their associated secondary\nsites that we happen to have any.\n\n80\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.990\nWe'll see one at the lower\nright hand corner down there,\n\n81\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.650\nacross from the distribution point,\nto see a secondary site.\n\n82\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.270\nWe will have all of that rolled up\nto the CAS, that's gonna be for\n\n83\n00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.340\nreporting purposes primarily, it's really\njust a Way in which we can aggregate and\n\n84\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.750\nmanage centrally and see all the data.\n\n85\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.240\nAnd that's what we're looking at there.\n\n86\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.220\nAnd that's what we just\nwant to understand.\n\n87\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.865\nAs we scroll back over towards the left\nwe will see we do have our central site,\n\n88\n00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:33.935\nprimary sites.\n\n89\n00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:36.865\nWe then do have our\nprimary sites down below,\n\n90\n00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:40.905\nroughly following the same kind\nof architecture, as you can see.\n\n91\n00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:45.070\nAnd we may then have one or more\nsecondary sites on the left hand side.\n\n92\n00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.490\nAt the bottom as well, you'll see that.\n\n93\n00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.270\nAnd so we see central site linking\nover to central admin site.\n\n94\n00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.490\nConcept is the same.\n\n95\n00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.360\nNaming is just a little bit different.\n\n96\n00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.490\nWe have our primary site or sites.\n\n97\n00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.230\nWe'll see those linking over as well.\n\n98\n00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.330\nAnd our secondary sites,\nwe have more than one.\n\n99\n00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.690\nSo let's talk about some of those\ncolored arrows for just a minute and\n\n100\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.890\nwhat they will represent.\n\n101\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.170\nThe first step we take at\nthe upper middle there, first one,\n\n102\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.900\nthe red arrow, says configure\nsource hierarchy, we're going to\n\n103\n00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.625\nmap the source hierarchy from the central\nsite primary on the left, over\n\n104\n00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:24.295\nto our central admin site on the right,\nor our main primary site on the right.\n\n105\n00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:28.105\nWhich is gonna be how we're gonna create\nthe connection using the migration wizard\n\n106\n00:05:28.105 --> 00:05:29.985\nto start pulling information in and\n\n107\n00:05:29.985 --> 00:05:33.817\nunderstand what it is we're gonna\nsee from the hierarchy perspective.\n\n108\n00:05:33.817 --> 00:05:37.817\nWe're then gonna, in step two, go through\nand configure the additional source sites.\n\n109\n00:05:37.817 --> 00:05:41.267\nSo if we have additional primary sites,\nwe're gonna be pulling those in,\n\n110\n00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:44.697\nwe can see the main primary site\nthere is linked over as well.\n\n111\n00:05:44.697 --> 00:05:46.917\nSo we're gonna have those\nsteps accounted for and\n\n112\n00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:50.490\nthen in yellow, or our two yellow arrows.\n\n113\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.250\nWe're gonna be migrating collections and\nobjects out of the primary site or\n\n114\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.420\nsites that are gonna contain them.\n\n115\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.280\nSo we will be pulling over\nour various collections,\n\n116\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.080\nour machines that are being managed.\n\n117\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.800\nApplication packages that we may have.\n\n118\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.280\nWe'll talk about that and\nsee how that goes.\n\n119\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.500\nAnd then we'll be migrating\nour clients over in green.\n\n120\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.510\nSo we'll be moving our clients over,\n\n121\n00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.370\nmeaning associating\nthem with the new site.\n\n122\n00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.900\nNew site codes have to be put in.\n\n123\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.100\nWe have to move them over into\nprobably new boundaries as well.\n\n124\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.860\nSo we'll talk about all that.\n\n125\n00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.470\nAnd then down there in blue, or\n\n126\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.470\nwhatever color you would call that,\nconverting distribution points, pulling\n\n127\n00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.950\nthose distribution points over from our\nsecondary sites where ever they may be,\n\n128\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.500\ninto our distribution points\non the 2012 R2 infrastructure.\n\n129\n00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.120\nBecause we have to bring our packages\nover, update our distribution,\n\n130\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.190\nmake sure we redistribute the packages,\nhave those available.\n\n131\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.400\nSo we're gonna be going\nthrough these steps.\n\n132\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.985\nAnd it's critical to understand\nthe migration is going to be performed\n\n133\n00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:51.080\nside-by-side.\n\n134\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.560\nIn other words,\nwe have this infrastructure up and\n\n135\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.320\nrunning in parallel, right?\n\n136\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.615\nAnd we have to have both sets of\ninfrastructure available, so we have to\n\n137\n00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:04.485\nbuilt out the 12 R2 environment,\nwe have to access to the 2007 platform,\n\n138\n00:07:04.485 --> 00:07:08.734\nand we have to then be able to create\nconnections from one to the other.\n\n139\n00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:12.062\nThings that we can migrate,\ntypes of objects that we'll come across,\n\n140\n00:07:12.062 --> 00:07:14.564\nthese various colored lines\nas we're doing things.\n\n141\n00:07:14.564 --> 00:07:17.610\nSo in particular thinking about\nwhat's in the yellow area there.\n\n142\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.840\nWhat we may see so to speak.\n\n143\n00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.220\nWe will migrate collections\nas you can see.\n\n144\n00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.820\nAdvertisements we'll come across,\nif we have any.\n\n145\n00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.100\nRemember advertisements are used\nto essentially tell a client\n\n146\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.791\nin a group somewhere hey there's\nsoftware out there, right.\n\n147\n00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:34.500\nWanna pull that software in and\nyou may wanna use it.\n\n148\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.785\nSo it's almost like taking\nan ad out on the paper,\n\n149\n00:07:36.785 --> 00:07:38.970\nthatt's probably why we call\nit advertisements, right?\n\n150\n00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.972\nAnd we're gonna have those, we can pull\nthose across, boundaries as I mentioned,\n\n151\n00:07:42.972 --> 00:07:45.560\nmay be pulled across they\nalso It may be reset.\n\n152\n00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.050\nWe may use new boundaries.\n\n153\n00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.226\nSoftware distribution packages will\ncome across to the distribution points.\n\n154\n00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:55.375\nVirtual application packages, if we're\ndoing AbV will come across as well.\n\n155\n00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:57.057\nWe'll talk about how we deal with those.\n\n156\n00:07:57.057 --> 00:07:59.471\nAsset intelligence customizations.\n\n157\n00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:03.924\nIf we've done any of that customization\nwork, we can pull that catalog across.\n\n158\n00:08:03.924 --> 00:08:06.807\nSoftware metering rules can be migrated.\n\n159\n00:08:06.807 --> 00:08:12.269\nIn the operating system deployment area,\nwe'll be able to pull over boot images,\n\n160\n00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:17.040\ndriver packages, drivers, images,\npackages, and task sequences.\n\n161\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.417\nAll the things that are near and\ndear to our hearts.\n\n162\n00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:23.595\nAnd for instance with MDOP, I know that\nyou Wes have an interest with that and\n\n163\n00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:24.652\nspend time there.\n\n164\n00:08:24.652 --> 00:08:26.573\nWe'd be able to pull in,\nall of the imaging,\n\n165\n00:08:26.573 --> 00:08:28.554\nall of the task sequencing\nthat we're doing.\n\n166\n00:08:28.554 --> 00:08:32.144\nWe're able to build on that commitment\nwe've already made to the infrastructure\n\n167\n00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:34.340\nand the configuration,\nso we don't lose it all.\n\n168\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.296\nCuz as you know having done it right, it's\na lot of time invested in the platform\n\n169\n00:08:38.296 --> 00:08:42.387\nto rebuild those images and those task\nsequences in particular to do automation.\n\n170\n00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:46.329\nDesired configuration management, we'll\nbe able to pull over the configuration\n\n171\n00:08:46.329 --> 00:08:48.310\nbaselines and the configuration items.\n\n172\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.799\nThose will all come across.\n\n173\n00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:53.343\nWe'll also see under software updates,\nthe WSUS functionality.\n\n174\n00:08:53.343 --> 00:08:57.289\nAs we configure and build in patch\nmanagement will be able to bring our\n\n175\n00:08:57.289 --> 00:09:02.403\ndeployments, our deployment packages,\nour templates, our software updates lists.\n\n176\n00:09:02.403 --> 00:09:06.516\nAll of these things will be migrating or\npotentially targets for migration, but\n\n177\n00:09:06.516 --> 00:09:09.792\nthere are also things that\nare excluded that we cannot migrate.\n\n178\n00:09:09.792 --> 00:09:11.400\nWe wanna know about these, as well.\n\n179\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.133\nQueries cannot be migrated over, which\nis one of the big bummers, so to speak,\n\n180\n00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:16.595\nbecause we can't bring that.\n\n181\n00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:17.705\nCan we go back to the picture?\n\n182\n00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:20.262\nI wanna be able to reference this and\ntalk about why.\n\n183\n00:09:20.262 --> 00:09:22.168\nWhen we cannot bring over queries,\n\n184\n00:09:22.168 --> 00:09:26.115\nthe reason we're not able to do this\nis that the databases are different.\n\n185\n00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:30.786\nAnd if you think about the logic of this,\nthose blue kinda cylindrical objects\n\n186\n00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:35.126\nsitting to the right of all of the server\nicons, any one of those things.\n\n187\n00:09:35.126 --> 00:09:38.049\nThey almost look like little erasers or\nsomething like that.\n\n188\n00:09:38.049 --> 00:09:42.812\nThose are meant to represent our databases\nin the diagram and those databases as you\n\n189\n00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:47.438\ncan see are gonna be linked to the site\narchitecture by deployment platform, and\n\n190\n00:09:47.438 --> 00:09:51.742\nthey contain different information,\nand they are different instances.\n\n191\n00:09:51.742 --> 00:09:57.070\nThose queries in 2007 are run against\nthe databases in the 2007 side.\n\n192\n00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:00.184\nThat information is not gonna\nbe represented accurately and\n\n193\n00:10:00.184 --> 00:10:03.908\nfully on the 2012 R2 side,\nbecause we're changing, modifying,\n\n194\n00:10:03.908 --> 00:10:07.157\nmigrating some thing's do come over,\nsome thing's don't.\n\n195\n00:10:07.157 --> 00:10:08.892\nThe queries have to be rewritten.\n\n196\n00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:13.188\nThis is one of the big gotchas, because\nespecially if we've done a lot of custom\n\n197\n00:10:13.188 --> 00:10:16.781\nquery work to bring over and\nto setup reports and things like that,\n\n198\n00:10:16.781 --> 00:10:20.844\nwe're gonna have to reproduce all that and\nthat can be a bit of a challenge.\n\n199\n00:10:20.844 --> 00:10:22.779\nWe don't have a choice, it is what it is.\n\n200\n00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:24.498\nYou're gonna have to know that, but\n\n201\n00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:27.276\nwe're gonna have to then\nreproduce all that information.\n\n202\n00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:28.799\nSo, you wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n203\n00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:32.272\nSecurity rights and instances for the\nsites, and objects do not migrate over.\n\n204\n00:10:32.272 --> 00:10:34.599\nThis is again,\ntied to the database concept,\n\n205\n00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:36.516\nbecause the databases are separate.\n\n206\n00:10:36.516 --> 00:10:41.162\nThat information stored in the site\ndatabases, those references that the roles\n\n207\n00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:45.602\nhave in terms of the permissions are\nunique to object instances identified in\n\n208\n00:10:45.602 --> 00:10:49.562\neach of those databases as unique\nobjects and we to reset all that, so\n\n209\n00:10:49.562 --> 00:10:53.284\nwe're also gonna have to recreate\nour security architecture.\n\n210\n00:10:53.284 --> 00:10:57.159\nAnd we have to know this, because we're\ngonna want to capture that in some way.\n\n211\n00:10:57.159 --> 00:11:01.120\nWhether it's through an export, whether\nit's through some sort of screen scraping\n\n212\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.003\nwhere we put up the security interface.\n\n213\n00:11:03.003 --> 00:11:04.122\nWe see the roles.\n\n214\n00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:05.693\nWe have a sense of what they are.\n\n215\n00:11:05.693 --> 00:11:10.142\nRemember, good documentation is critical\nto the success of anything we do.\n\n216\n00:11:10.142 --> 00:11:13.632\nAnd we don't wanna find out after the fact\nthat we haven't documented this, so\n\n217\n00:11:13.632 --> 00:11:15.207\nwe got to have a way to capture this.\n\n218\n00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:18.185\nConfig Manager 2007 reports in general,\n\n219\n00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:22.627\ndo not come over whether they're\nweb based reports or SSRS reports.\n\n220\n00:11:22.627 --> 00:11:25.575\nWe can manually migrate the SSRS reports,\nbut\n\n221\n00:11:25.575 --> 00:11:29.590\nwe have to export them manually and\nthen import them manually.\n\n222\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.506\nThere's no automatic migration coming\nout of the migration wizard, but\n\n223\n00:11:33.506 --> 00:11:35.250\nwe do have an opt in for that.\n\n224\n00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.399\nWe can do it manually, which is good.\n\n225\n00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.511\nWe can breathe a sigh of relief there.\n\n226\n00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:42.178\nWe are not gonna lose our customizations,\nbut we do have to do that manually.\n\n227\n00:11:42.178 --> 00:11:46.501\nClient inventory and history data from\nthe main site databases do not migrate.\n\n228\n00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:50.131\nSo, again, database specific,\nimplementation specific.\n\n229\n00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:53.770\nWe're gonna have to move all that,\nrather move all the clients, but\n\n230\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.483\nreproduce all that inventory.\n\n231\n00:11:55.483 --> 00:11:57.716\nSo, we're gonna lose that\nhistorical information.\n\n232\n00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:58.991\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n233\n00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:02.414\nI have files in the client cache,\ndo not migrate over either.\n\n234\n00:12:02.414 --> 00:12:06.255\nAn AMT client provisioning information\nwill not come over either.\n\n235\n00:12:06.255 --> 00:12:09.331\nSo we do wanna understand that\nwhile we're gonna get a lot,\n\n236\n00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:11.557\nwe may also actually miss certain things.\n\n237\n00:12:11.557 --> 00:12:13.629\nAnd before we move off the diagram,\n\n238\n00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:18.550\nwe do also need to understand that we have\na restriction with regard to collections.\n\n239\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.866\nThe Configuration Manager 2012 side\ndoes not support subcollections and\n\n240\n00:12:22.866 --> 00:12:25.162\nmid collections like we did in 2007.\n\n241\n00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:28.636\nA subcollections and nested collection.\n\n242\n00:12:28.636 --> 00:12:30.410\nSo it's not the hierarchy, but\n\n243\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:34.367\nit's the collection hierarchy\nspecifically that we are focusing on.\n\n244\n00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:37.883\nSubcollections ultimately get migrated\nto individual collections that\n\n245\n00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:39.191\ncontain inclusion rules.\n\n246\n00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.987\nSo we build them out and\nbreak the hierarchy and raise them up,\n\n247\n00:12:42.987 --> 00:12:45.106\nif you will to a stand alone level.\n\n248\n00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:47.824\nMix collections cannot be migrated\nthey have to be recreated,\n\n249\n00:12:47.824 --> 00:12:49.426\nthat is an issue we wanna be aware of.\n\n250\n00:12:49.426 --> 00:12:50.769\nWe will then be aware or\n\n251\n00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:55.388\nshould be aware of the fact that that\ncan change the hierarchy change manage.\n\n252\n00:12:55.388 --> 00:12:57.741\nChange the thought process of what we see.\n\n253\n00:12:57.741 --> 00:12:59.523\nSo, we have to be aware of that.\n\n254\n00:12:59.523 --> 00:13:02.461\nCollections are evaluated at all\nprimary sites in the hierarchy, so\n\n255\n00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:05.054\nwe're looking at them and\nbringing them over accordingly.\n\n256\n00:13:05.054 --> 00:13:07.691\nAnd in 2012,\na collection cannot be dependent.\n\n257\n00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:09.914\nAs I said, on another collection.\n\n258\n00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:13.895\nSo, those subcollections are not going\nto essentially be available to us.\n\n259\n00:13:13.895 --> 00:13:15.848\nSo, we wanna know that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n260\n00:13:15.848 --> 00:13:18.541\nNot a big deal, but\njust something we have to adjust for.\n\n261\n00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:20.620\nWe have to account for,\nso be aware of that.\n\n262\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.421\nAlso in 2012, you'll notice that\nprimary sites off to the right\n\n263\n00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:29.239\nare going to be essentially\nunique instance objects.\n\n264\n00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:32.582\nThey sit at a certain level in\nthe hierarchy, but notice that we\n\n265\n00:13:32.582 --> 00:13:36.571\ndon't have primary sites becoming\nchild objects of other primary sites.\n\n266\n00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:38.341\nWe essentially have secondary sites.\n\n267\n00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:40.539\nIf we scroll down just\na little bit off to the right,\n\n268\n00:13:40.539 --> 00:13:44.192\nI know it's kinda hard to keep up with me,\ncuz I'm throwing all these terms around.\n\n269\n00:13:44.192 --> 00:13:47.850\nBut we have the primary sites in\n2012 off to the right here setup and\n\n270\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.640\nthen a secondary site is\na child object directly, and\n\n271\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.484\nnotice the distribution point, and\nit's kinda confusing a little bit in\n\n272\n00:13:54.484 --> 00:13:57.779\nthe diagram if you don't\nunderstand what you're looking at.\n\n273\n00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:00.209\nThe distribution point is\nactually in the primary site.\n\n274\n00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:02.397\nSo it's not an object\nthat is a child object,\n\n275\n00:14:02.397 --> 00:14:06.268\nit's just a way they show it on the left\nthere is that it's actually connected.\n\n276\n00:14:06.268 --> 00:14:08.756\nBut it's really inside the primary site,\nso\n\n277\n00:14:08.756 --> 00:14:11.776\nit's an object of the site\nnot a child object below it.\n\n278\n00:14:11.776 --> 00:14:16.898\nBut as we move to the left, what you will\nfind is that we have primary sites and\n\n279\n00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:21.644\nnotice that those primary sites\nare children of other primary sites.\n\n280\n00:14:21.644 --> 00:14:25.341\nIn other words, the primary site there\nthat you were just hovering over, no,\n\n281\n00:14:25.341 --> 00:14:26.023\nup, up, up.\n\n282\n00:14:26.023 --> 00:14:29.403\nThat, right there and then off to the\nright and then notice that right above it\n\n283\n00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:31.952\nin the triangle at the head\nthere is another primary site.\n\n284\n00:14:31.952 --> 00:14:36.415\nIn 2007, we could've had primary sites\nbeing essentially nested objects or\n\n285\n00:14:36.415 --> 00:14:38.560\nchild objects of other primary sites.\n\n286\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.820\nWe have to plan for consolidation here\nin 2012, because we can't do that.\n\n287\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.343\nThat's not gonna work.\n\n288\n00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:51.165\nSo when we migrate over, essentially what\nhappens is that the central site and\n\n289\n00:14:51.165 --> 00:14:55.574\nthose nested primary sites\nare gonna be now brought over and\n\n290\n00:14:55.574 --> 00:15:01.235\nwe're gonna have to see them setup as\ntheir own independent primary sites.\n\n291\n00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:04.479\nSo, they are gonna essentially be listed\nall together at the same level and\n\n292\n00:15:04.479 --> 00:15:06.137\nthey are not gonna be nested anymore.\n\n293\n00:15:06.137 --> 00:15:08.278\nSo, we have to be aware of that and\nunderstand that.\n\n294\n00:15:08.278 --> 00:15:09.480\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n295\n00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.761\nIf we had secondary sites that were\nlinked to those primary sites,\n\n296\n00:15:12.761 --> 00:15:16.630\nwe may have to actually uninstall those\nsecondary sites if they're nested and\n\n297\n00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.696\nbring the primary site over separately.\n\n298\n00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:22.956\nSo, there's some additional architecture\nthat we're gonna have to be aware of and\n\n299\n00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:24.039\nto think about here.\n\n300\n00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:26.812\nWe're really gonna have to\ndo a lot of planning and\n\n301\n00:15:26.812 --> 00:15:29.264\na lot of preparing in\norder to get this done.\n\n302\n00:15:29.264 --> 00:15:33.485\nBefore we move off the diagram, let's\ntalk about some of the things we have\n\n303\n00:15:33.485 --> 00:15:37.312\nto make sure are installed of\nthe 2007 side here off to the left.\n\n304\n00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:42.112\nWe wanna make sure that we're thinking\nabout the fact that we have to be at 2007\n\n305\n00:15:42.112 --> 00:15:43.518\nService Pack 2 or R3.\n\n306\n00:15:43.518 --> 00:15:47.160\nSo typically these days, if you've\nbeen running that infrastructure for\n\n307\n00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.315\na long time, you'd be at release 3 by now.\n\n308\n00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.219\nThat's what R3 is.\n\n309\n00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:53.976\nSo you should be at the latest\navailable version of 2007 before we\n\n310\n00:15:53.976 --> 00:15:57.875\nstop putting out patches,\nputting out updates, that would be R3.\n\n311\n00:15:57.875 --> 00:16:00.520\nWanna make sure we flatten that hierarchy.\n\n312\n00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.610\nGet rid of those nested primary sites.\n\n313\n00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.690\nGet rid of those nested collections.\n\n314\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.130\nAll the stuff we talked about.\n\n315\n00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.940\nMake sure we have Server 12,\n12 R2 running on the far side, so\n\n316\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.158\nyou set up the 12 infrastructure,\nSQL 12, right?\n\n317\n00:16:13.158 --> 00:16:13.890\n64-bit.\n\n318\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.590\nEverything all the way across\nthe board there, very important.\n\n319\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.850\nGotta make sure we\nare thinking about whether or\n\n320\n00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.010\nnot we want to use distribution points or\nbranch caching.\n\n321\n00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.620\nSo, branch cache may be an option for\n\n322\n00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.480\nus in local areas that are not\ngonna have great connectivity.\n\n323\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.350\nWe may wanna use branch cache to\nessentially create a localized\n\n324\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.195\ndistribution option for us.\n\n325\n00:16:32.195 --> 00:16:35.980\nSo similar to DFS in some respects but\nreally just used to distribute software.\n\n326\n00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.230\nSo you wanna be aware of that.\n\n327\n00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.474\nWe may virtualize the Configuration\nManager infrastructure coming out of '07\n\n328\n00:16:41.474 --> 00:16:44.990\ninto 12 R2 because in '07 it\nwould not have been virtualized.\n\n329\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:50.550\nWe did not support it although people may\nhave chosen to run it rather its very end\n\n330\n00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.950\nof that lifecycle, but the reality\nis it was probably not virtualized.\n\n331\n00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.880\nWe could virtualize it if\nwe choose to going into 12.\n\n332\n00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.508\nWe wanna stay away from those mixed\ncollections, sub-collections,\n\n333\n00:16:59.508 --> 00:17:00.770\nthings like that.\n\n334\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:05.700\nMake sure that we're using UNC paths for\nour package source, very important.\n\n335\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.060\nMake sure that our site codes are unique,\nbetween both infrastructure installations.\n\n336\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.680\nSo we cannot reproduce the site code from\n'07 into '12 and use the same site code.\n\n337\n00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.180\nThat would be a big no no.\n\n338\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.040\nit will fail, right,\n\n339\n00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.170\nbecause we cannot migrate between site\ncodes essentially if they're the same.\n\n340\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.830\nSo understand that.\n\n341\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.450\nWe wanna make sure that in addition.\n\n342\n00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.212\nWe are using or\nhaving the right ports opened up.\n\n343\n00:17:29.212 --> 00:17:32.460\nWe're gonna show you on the web where\na list of all these ports will be\n\n344\n00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.150\nat Technetzel.\n\n345\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.610\nWe'll take a look at that in\njust a couple of minutes.\n\n346\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.980\nMaking sure that once we're setting up\nthe connection to gather the data with\n\n347\n00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.980\nthe initial steps.\n\n348\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.510\nOf the Migration Wizard that\nwe're gonna have NET BIOS or\n\n349\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:48.220\nSMB on port 4445 using TCP as\nthe carrier protocol available.\n\n350\n00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.842\nRPC and or\nWMI running on port 135 using TCP and\n\n351\n00:17:52.842 --> 00:17:57.370\nSQL server running on port 1433 using TCP.\n\n352\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.390\nWe have to have all of these available.\n\n353\n00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.860\nIt's very very important.\n\n354\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.380\nWe also need to make sure that\nwe set up two accounts for\n\n355\n00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.870\nConfiguration Manager 12 on\nthe far side with permissions.\n\n356\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.340\nFor every source site,\n\n357\n00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.430\nwe have to make sure we have\na source site SMS provider account.\n\n358\n00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.160\nThis site is going to have to have read\npermission to all source site objects.\n\n359\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.750\nSo in the Server 2007 hierarchy\noff to the left there.\n\n360\n00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.570\nWe're going to need to have this account.\n\n361\n00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:26.690\nSource site SMS provider and source\nsite SQL, SQL Server account as well.\n\n362\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.060\nThis has read and execute permissions\nto the source site database.\n\n363\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.310\nSo we're gonna need\nthese two accounts also.\n\n364\n00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.970\nGonna be very, very important for\nus to think about that.\n\n365\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.350\nWe're gonna also need an account that\nis full admin security role rights\n\n366\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.890\non the 2012 side so that we can\ndo all the things we need to do.\n\n367\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.990\nWe'll need to make sure that we set up a\nsoftware update point on the twelfth side.\n\n368\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.400\nThat's gonna replace the software\nupdate point on the 2007 side for\n\n369\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.740\nthe WSUSS functionality,\nwe have to make sure that we have that.\n\n370\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.140\nHave at least one 12 primary sites set\nup to use shared distribution points.\n\n371\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.640\nSo that way our support is\nshared distribution point, so\n\n372\n00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.960\nwe can bring over that information,\nall the packages that we want to have.\n\n373\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.227\nSo we wanna be aware of that.\n\n374\n00:19:08.227 --> 00:19:11.108\nAnd we need to assign site\ndelete permissions to\n\n375\n00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:16.093\nthe source site access account on the\nsource site side, meaning on the 07 side.\n\n376\n00:19:16.093 --> 00:19:19.580\nTo remove the distribution points\nautomatically from the 07 side so\n\n377\n00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.900\nthen we can ultimately have\nthem show up on the 12 side.\n\n378\n00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.960\nSo we need to just think through the logic\nof all this, understand these concerns,\n\n379\n00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.190\nthese things that we're gonna have to\naddress, and make sure we're aware of.\n\n380\n00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.620\nIt's gonna be very important for\n\n381\n00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.180\nus to have all of our dots kind of dotted,\nor all our dots dotted.\n\n382\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.310\nThat's a good way to say that.\n\n383\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.750\nAll our I's dotted is what I meant to say.\n\n384\n00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.090\nAll our T's crossed.\n\n385\n00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.870\nAnd we need a checklist essentially.\n\n386\n00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.280\nAnd we're gonna take a look at how to\nfind one of those out on the web as well.\n\n387\n00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.940\nTo make sure you're as prepared as\npossible to take on all of the little\n\n388\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.755\ndetails.\n\n389\n00:19:51.755 --> 00:19:53.145\nThat have to be mastered here.\n\n390\n00:19:53.145 --> 00:19:56.195\nThe picture looks relatively serene and\nsimple.\n\n391\n00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.875\nWe've got some infrastructure.\n\n392\n00:19:57.875 --> 00:20:00.915\nWe're going to make a couple of trips\nback and forth, write some things down,\n\n393\n00:20:00.915 --> 00:20:02.565\nand when we're done everything works.\n\n394\n00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:04.745\nAnd it will be essentially\nnot much more than that,\n\n395\n00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:06.630\nas you'll see In the demonstration.\n\n396\n00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.120\nBut getting to that point,\nhaving it all set so\n\n397\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.448\nit runs smoothly,\ncan actually take a lot of time.\n\n398\n00:20:11.448 --> 00:20:14.380\nAnd we wanna make sure that\nwe think about that and\n\n399\n00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.830\nwe understand that as we go through here.\n\n400\n00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.370\nSo maybe we could switch\nto the web real quick and\n\n401\n00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:23.195\ntake a look at some of those nice\ndocuments that we found for everybody.\n\n402\n00:20:23.195 --> 00:20:25.560\nSo this first download site right here,\n\n403\n00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.633\nwhich is off\nthe Microsoft Download Architecture.\n\n404\n00:20:28.633 --> 00:20:33.491\nIs simply going to be to get all of\nthe latest technical documentation for\n\n405\n00:20:33.491 --> 00:20:39.040\nthe overall System Center 2012,\n2012 R2 Config Manager platform.\n\n406\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.220\nSo, we wanna be able to go in there,\n\n407\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.270\nand we wanna be able to\nhit that download button.\n\n408\n00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.590\nWe're not gonna do that live,\nbut you'll get the general idea,\n\n409\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.470\nand you'll get all the latest\ntechnical documentation.\n\n410\n00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.680\nRemember, we encourage you to go\nout at any point when you watch\n\n411\n00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.850\nan episode like this.\n\n412\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.180\nThis may be something you're\nwatching with us now.\n\n413\n00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.590\nThis may be something you\nwatch two years from now.\n\n414\n00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.340\nWho knows when?\n\n415\n00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.820\nWhenever you're actually gonna get to it,\nand that link is gonna be there, but\n\n416\n00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.220\nit's gonna be updated with information.\n\n417\n00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.330\nSo, you always wanna go get\nthe latest information,\n\n418\n00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.870\nso you're gonna wanna go out and do that.\n\n419\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.440\nAnd then we have a series of\nTechNet pages that we came to.\n\n420\n00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.700\nI don't know what order they're gonna come\nup in, so maybe you could throw them, and\n\n421\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.160\nwe'll talk about what they are.\n\n422\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.660\nSo this one is gonna be\nthe Ports Used by Config Manager.\n\n423\n00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.408\nThis is gonna be a listing of all the\nports on 2007 that are gonna be in play\n\n424\n00:21:22.408 --> 00:21:23.697\nand need to be available,\n\n425\n00:21:23.697 --> 00:21:27.173\naside from the ones we already\nmentioned just now in the walk through.\n\n426\n00:21:27.173 --> 00:21:31.346\nThis is gonna give you a complete list of\nall the ports that are available in 2007.\n\n427\n00:21:31.346 --> 00:21:34.438\nAnd as a result of that,\nthe ports you need to watch out for and\n\n428\n00:21:34.438 --> 00:21:38.590\nmake sure you are aware of with regards\nto not just migration, but operations.\n\n429\n00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.440\nSo it's just a good general\ntechnical reference for you.\n\n430\n00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.670\nIt's got some good detail in there.\n\n431\n00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.540\nIt's got some pretty pictures\nabout how everything works,\n\n432\n00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.875\na little origami going on there\nto configure all that out.\n\n433\n00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:52.210\nAnd we've got it by section,\nby area, by functionality.\n\n434\n00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.220\nAs you can see, something like side\nservice, side server communication,\n\n435\n00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.920\nlists out all the ports,\ntells you what's going on there.\n\n436\n00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.950\nPrimary side server domain control,\netc, as you go down.\n\n437\n00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.240\nSo we've got it all broken out for\nyou really nicely so\n\n438\n00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.250\nthat's gonna be valuable as\na reference point for you.\n\n439\n00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.520\nSo, want to take a look at that one.\n\n440\n00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.130\nWhat else do we have up there?\n\n441\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.040\nWe've got the mapping.\n\n442\n00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.030\nOkay, so\nthis is gonna be important pending c here.\n\n443\n00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.510\nOnce we get the migration done this\nis gonna help us to understand\n\n444\n00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:21.330\nwhat all the system center manager\nproperties are in the 12 database.\n\n445\n00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:26.080\nSo that we can essentially see how\nthe 07 to 12 mapping took place and\n\n446\n00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.560\nsee what all those are.\n\n447\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.060\nSo that's gonna be helpful for us as well.\n\n448\n00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.730\nSo we're gonna be able to see this and\nthis'll be a great link for\n\n449\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.120\nyou to have after migration takes place.\n\n450\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.240\nWe'll see all the individual components,\nthe WMI objects,\n\n451\n00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.110\nthat are gonna be detailed out from a\nmanagement perspective, for reporting and\n\n452\n00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.080\nthings like that.\n\n453\n00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.870\nAnd this will tell you\nhow they all map over.\n\n454\n00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.030\nSo as Wes is scrolling down\nyou're gonna see row after row,\n\n455\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.740\nline after line of just object references.\n\n456\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.450\nThis'll be the authoritative document,\nright, that helps you to see that map.\n\n457\n00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:57.250\nSo then we have the migrating hierarchies.\n\n458\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.620\nOkay, so this is gonna allow\nus to essentially go through.\n\n459\n00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.530\nAnd this is an overview of all the steps\nyou're gonna see me engage in here,\n\n460\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.220\nin the demo in a few minutes.\n\n461\n00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.598\nIt's got links to all the different\nmigration topics that you have to be\n\n462\n00:23:09.598 --> 00:23:10.113\naware of.\n\n463\n00:23:10.113 --> 00:23:13.878\nWhat is migration overall, how are we\ngonna prepare for that by planning,\n\n464\n00:23:13.878 --> 00:23:17.247\nhow are we gonna configure the source\nhierarchy and source sites?\n\n465\n00:23:17.247 --> 00:23:20.440\nHow are we going to operate, what are we\ngoing to do from a security stand point?\n\n466\n00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.820\nThese are all the kinds of things we\njust talked about at a high level.\n\n467\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.600\nThis is all the technical detail, all the\ndocumentation, you need to take a look at,\n\n468\n00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.820\nyou need to read through.\n\n469\n00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.497\nNumber one cuz you want to prepare for\n\n470\n00:23:30.497 --> 00:23:32.710\nthis particular area to\ndo it the right way.\n\n471\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.730\nRemember this is the kind of thing you\ndo once, if at all, and you're done.\n\n472\n00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.700\nIf you do it the right way, that's it,\nyou don't tend to do this very often,\n\n473\n00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.580\nunless you're somebody\nthat's consulting and\n\n474\n00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.440\ndoing this work in the field\non a regular basis.\n\n475\n00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.420\nBut for the exam as well,\nif you're gonna prepare for\n\n476\n00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.280\nthe exam, you're definitely gonna wanna\nunderstand how to migrate because\n\n477\n00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.007\nyou're gonna be asked\nquestions about this.\n\n478\n00:23:49.007 --> 00:23:53.390\nSo this information will help you to\nunderstand the technical specificity.\n\n479\n00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.533\nThat we may ask about.\n\n480\n00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:56.010\nAnd then we have one more there,\n\n481\n00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.660\nwhich I believe is going to be\nthe Administrator Checklist area, right?\n\n482\n00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.780\nSo I mentioned that you'd want to have\na checklist, a set of documents, a guide,\n\n483\n00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:08.390\na set of guidelines that essentially keep\nyou on track, make sure you are focused.\n\n484\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.520\nThis site right here will\nhelp provide that for you.\n\n485\n00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.220\nYou'll see checklist for\nmigration planning, checklist for\n\n486\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.120\nmigration, checklist for\nhierarchy migration.\n\n487\n00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.340\nWe've got areas that we can go to and\nit's got information action and\n\n488\n00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.710\nthen links off to the right\nif the link is appropriate.\n\n489\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.950\nIt is essentially just going to be\na map of all all the infrastructure\n\n490\n00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.670\ndocumentation that Microsoft has,\nand all the guidance they have for\n\n491\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.470\nevery one of these areas and\nevery one of these steps.\n\n492\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.946\nIt's going to be a very valuable\nset of resources for you.\n\n493\n00:24:35.946 --> 00:24:38.330\nAnd we want to make sure that you\nhave access to them, obviously,\n\n494\n00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.660\npoint them out to you, and make sure\nyou're comfortable with using them.\n\n495\n00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.890\nSo now that we've taken a look at all of\nthat, we want to think about in our minds\n\n496\n00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.330\nwhat it is that we're going to\nactually look to accomplish.\n\n497\n00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:52.030\nAnd what it is we're going to actually\nlook to do with regards to this.\n\n498\n00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.770\nSo, when we think about how we're going\nto migrate, the very first thing we want\n\n499\n00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:59.470\nto be able to do is make sure that\nwe've done our due diligence.\n\n500\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.210\nDue diligence is really the idea of\nunderstanding what it is that we need to\n\n501\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.985\nhave available and all the resources\nwe need to make sure we have.\n\n502\n00:25:06.985 --> 00:25:07.760\nYou're going to want to go out and\n\n503\n00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.660\ntake a look at all this information\nwe've provided to you out on the web.\n\n504\n00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.406\nAnd then once you have a good\nidea of what has to happen,\n\n505\n00:25:14.406 --> 00:25:17.533\nyou're going to want to go out and\ncheck your documentation.\n\n506\n00:25:17.533 --> 00:25:19.762\nMake sure that all\nthe documentation is valid,\n\n507\n00:25:19.762 --> 00:25:22.000\nmake sure that we have all\nof the things we need.\n\n508\n00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.936\nAnd then once you've done all that and\nyou're able to bring up both the '07 site\n\n509\n00:25:25.936 --> 00:25:29.875\nand the 12 Architecture and you've got\nall that built out, we're then going to\n\n510\n00:25:29.875 --> 00:25:33.300\nbe able to go in and start playing\naround with all the background work and\n\n511\n00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.950\nsetting up all the things\nthat we need to do.\n\n512\n00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.840\nSo to that end,\nwhat we're going to do is go in,\n\n513\n00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.890\nand we're going to actually take\na look at a migration environment.\n\n514\n00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.080\nI'm actually just looking off\nto the side here of my shoulder,\n\n515\n00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.330\njust to make sure the config\nmanager consoles come up.\n\n516\n00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.030\nI'm just getting that started for us,\n\n517\n00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.470\nso that we can actually go in and\nbegin the process of doing a migration.\n\n518\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.450\nIt's going to be a very exciting demo\nwe're going to walk through here.\n\n519\n00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.220\nWe're going to take it step by step.\n\n520\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.810\nStart with preparing\nthe config manager clients, or\n\n521\n00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.965\nexcuse me, the config manager\n12 R2 Site for migration.\n\n522\n00:26:01.965 --> 00:26:04.670\nIn other words,\nwhat do we need to do in the new\n\n523\n00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.360\ninfrastructure to make sure we're ready to\nreach backwards and pull that data across.\n\n524\n00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.780\nSo we're going to start with that and\n\n525\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.960\nthen once we've gone through that we'll\nactually begin the migration process.\n\n526\n00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.340\nIf we can go ahead and\nswitch over to our demo environment,\n\n527\n00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.440\nwe're going to start taking a look\nat how to do that right now.\n\n528\n00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.050\nAll right so we're going go ahead and\nget started with our demonstration.\n\n529\n00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.420\nYou can see we've already got\nthe SCCM console opened up, we're in\n\n530\n00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.280\nthe administration work space here,\njust thought we'd preflight that for you.\n\n531\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.010\nAnd you'll see we're\nin the migration area,\n\n532\n00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.266\nbut we've got source hierarchy selected.\n\n533\n00:26:32.266 --> 00:26:35.775\nWe're just going to scroll up a little bit\nso you can see the ribbon up top there.\n\n534\n00:26:35.775 --> 00:26:37.190\nWhat we're going to do is go in and\n\n535\n00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.890\nspecify our source hierarchy,\nas we were talking about.\n\n536\n00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:45.260\nWe're going to come in here and\nwe're going to program in the name\n\n537\n00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.990\nof our top level config manager at\nthe site where we want to pull from.\n\n538\n00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:53.440\nSo this is going to be our SMS server.\n\n539\n00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.710\nSo we will do, we've got our caps\nlock behavior going on again.\n\n540\n00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:58.580\nThere we go.\n\n541\n00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.726\nSMS server,\nlet me just type that in correctly.\n\n542\n00:27:01.726 --> 00:27:05.450\nAnd we'll do SMS server there,\nand that's going to be the name,\n\n543\n00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:09.060\nremember, of our source site hierarchy.\n\n544\n00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.260\nSo we are going to essentially\nbe connecting out to our\n\n545\n00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.792\nprovider from the source site.\n\n546\n00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:18.620\nThen we're going to specify our source\nsite account that is read privileges, so\n\n547\n00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.450\nwe are going to set this, we are going to\npull this down to new account over here.\n\n548\n00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.080\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nput this in.\n\n549\n00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.370\nWe're going to type in our domain.\n\n550\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.060\nThis'll be the SMS Domain.\n\n551\n00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.090\nSo SMS Domain spelled like Domain,\nthat's always important.\n\n552\n00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:37.350\nAnd we'll do administrator for\nour username.\n\n553\n00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.048\nWe are using the admin account\nessentially, right, of the source domain.\n\n554\n00:27:41.048 --> 00:27:45.790\nWe're going to go ahead, and on the\npassword side here, type in password, and\n\n555\n00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.130\nverify our password.\n\n556\n00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.590\nWe're going to go ahead and\nthen verify our connection.\n\n557\n00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.048\nWe're going to change this out to WMI.\n\n558\n00:27:53.048 --> 00:27:57.460\nWe're going to make sure we see\nour source site server listed,\n\n559\n00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:03.260\nour name space designation for WMI, root\nSMS, do a little test connection here.\n\n560\n00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.830\nWe're waiting on it to\ncome back successfully.\n\n561\n00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.980\nIt's what we always like to see.\n\n562\n00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.310\nThe connection was successfully\nverified is important.\n\n563\n00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.170\nWe would get an error for instance,\n\n564\n00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.380\nright, if we were not able to\nconnect out to the site hierarchy.\n\n565\n00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.120\nIf there was a problem\nwith RPC connectivity,\n\n566\n00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.090\nthings like that, we'd see an error here.\n\n567\n00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.690\nSo we're going to click OK.\n\n568\n00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.530\nThat's going to be good, as we always do.\n\n569\n00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:29.210\nWe'll now click OK to put that credential\nin, make sure that that is all set up.\n\n570\n00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.690\nAnd now we've done that.\n\n571\n00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:35.710\nWe're going go ahead and we're going to go\ndown to our data source area over here for\n\n572\n00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:39.745\nour Specify Source Database Account\nto the SQL database.\n\n573\n00:28:39.745 --> 00:28:41.755\nWe're going to set this up as well,\n\n574\n00:28:41.755 --> 00:28:45.275\nmaking sure here that we are able\nto provide this credential.\n\n575\n00:28:45.275 --> 00:28:47.695\nI'll just scroll down\njust a little bit here.\n\n576\n00:28:47.695 --> 00:28:51.440\nNow you'll see we can either use\nthe same account as a source site\n\n577\n00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.480\nSMS provider account, and/or we can go\nahead and specify our user account.\n\n578\n00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.240\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n579\n00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.176\nSo really just from our perspective,\n\n580\n00:29:00.176 --> 00:29:02.840\nwe have to decide how we\nwant to be able to do this.\n\n581\n00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.920\nWhat it is that we may want to do.\n\n582\n00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.530\nSo we're going to go ahead and\n\n583\n00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.980\nwe are going to make sure\nthat we put in user account.\n\n584\n00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.142\nLet's set this as well.\n\n585\n00:29:16.288 --> 00:29:18.042\nLet's do New Account.\n\n586\n00:29:18.042 --> 00:29:19.785\nI'm going to scroll back up here,\none second.\n\n587\n00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:29.612\nLet's put in our username and\nlet's put in,\n\n588\n00:29:29.612 --> 00:29:34.420\nactually you know what we can do.\n\n589\n00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.950\nGive me one second here, we can do\nthis and actually what we can do,\n\n590\n00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.530\nwe can do the following.\n\n591\n00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:47.420\nWe've done our test connection and I'm\njust thinking we can actually go ahead and\n\n592\n00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:52.060\nwe can do our test, and\n\n593\n00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:57.240\nwe can use the same account for\nthe provider.\n\n594\n00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.690\nLet's enable distribution point sharing\nfor the source site account here.\n\n595\n00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.650\nWe're going to go ahead and specify that.\n\n596\n00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.860\nWe'll go ahead and we will set this up.\n\n597\n00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.600\nEnable distribution point sharing for\nthe source site server account in order to\n\n598\n00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.300\nmake sure that we are able to\nshare the distribution points.\n\n599\n00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:21.910\nWe talked about this, if you remember,\nas one of the things as we looked\n\n600\n00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.980\nat our dialog around the whole picture,\nthe migration picture.\n\n601\n00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.780\nAll the things we had to do that\nWes would put up on his screen.\n\n602\n00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.360\n>> Yea.\n>> We were\n\n603\n00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.300\ndoing the thought process just diagramming\nout the fact that that distribution point\n\n604\n00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.690\nwill have to be shared to\ninitially bring over our packages.\n\n605\n00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.080\nSo we just want to make sure\nwe're thinking about that and\n\n606\n00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.240\nwe have that all set up as well.\n\n607\n00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:47.310\nWe're going to go ahead and\nwe are going to click OK.\n\n608\n00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.100\nLet's just get that in there.\n\n609\n00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.520\nWait for that to do its thing.\n\n610\n00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.050\nInitiate the data gathering process,\nlet that go through.\n\n611\n00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:02.970\nWhat we'll see here is that we're going to\ngo out, we're going to start bringing in\n\n612\n00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.180\nthe information from the SMS site,\nfrom the source site.\n\n613\n00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.340\nMake sure that we have all of\nthat information that we need.\n\n614\n00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.820\nWe're going to connect out.\n\n615\n00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.960\nWhen we do finally get\na gathering successful message,\n\n616\n00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.750\nthat'll get everything back.\n\n617\n00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.650\nWe're going to go ahead and\nwe'll click Close.\n\n618\n00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:20.930\nJust wait for that to finish.\n\n619\n00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.400\nThere we go, we got all that in.\n\n620\n00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.060\nSo completed gathering data\nis what we want to see.\n\n621\n00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.130\nThat means we were able to\nsuccessfully connect out.\n\n622\n00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:30.950\nWe were able to then make sure we\nbrought all that information over.\n\n623\n00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.410\nSo let's just go ahead and hit Close here.\n\n624\n00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.770\nAnd then we have our information\nthat populates here.\n\n625\n00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.632\nYou'll see we have, scroll up so you\ncan just get a look at this real quick.\n\n626\n00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:45.238\nWe've got our source site code\nfrom the SMS site provider that we\n\n627\n00:31:45.238 --> 00:31:49.247\nbrought over from 2007 hierarchy,\nTST, ready for\n\n628\n00:31:49.247 --> 00:31:53.018\nnext data gathering As you\ncould see their process.\n\n629\n00:31:53.018 --> 00:31:56.525\nIt gives us a date and time,\ntells us what's going on and\n\n630\n00:31:56.525 --> 00:31:59.690\nwe can see credential configured yes.\n\n631\n00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:02.450\nSo we've got an active connection\nthat allows us to be able to bring\n\n632\n00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:03.010\nthis over now.\n\n633\n00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:06.920\nThe other interesting thing down here is\nto scroll down so you could see this.\n\n634\n00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.900\nWe're gonna see our properties\non the SMS source site so\n\n635\n00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.630\nwe're gonna be able to see that\nwe have our source site code.\n\n636\n00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.040\nWe've already established that up top,\nthat's TST.\n\n637\n00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.480\nWe have our site server,\nSMS server we know that.\n\n638\n00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.610\nWe see all that but\n\n639\n00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.660\nthe nice thing here that we didn't see\nup top was the objects at source number.\n\n640\n00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.760\nI notice the migrated objects count.\n\n641\n00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.750\nSo we have 91 objects that potentially\nare available to bring over.\n\n642\n00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.960\nWe have not brought any over yet.\n\n643\n00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.530\nSo we essentially created the bridge,\nwe've walked across it.\n\n644\n00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.290\nKinda shook hands said hey I'm here.\n\n645\n00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:37.730\nThis is what I'm gonna do.\n\n646\n00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.380\nI'm ready, you're ready, we've diagrammed\nall that out, detailed all that out and\n\n647\n00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.260\nset it up.\n\n648\n00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.310\nBut we haven't actually done anything yet.\n\n649\n00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.820\nSo we're just, take you to look at\nthat to make sure that's all good and\n\n650\n00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.570\nwhen we take a look at our\nshared distribution points tab\n\n651\n00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.020\nwe will see that we do have\ntwo distribution points.\n\n652\n00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.610\nLet's just see if we can,\n\n653\n00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.650\nit's always hard to catch like the right\narea there to just grab that over.\n\n654\n00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:58.463\nThere we go.\n\n655\n00:32:58.463 --> 00:33:02.154\nBecause unlike in the other consoles, they\ndon't actually give you the double sided\n\n656\n00:33:02.154 --> 00:33:05.483\narrow, to indicate that you're pull into\nframe so you have to hover there and\n\n657\n00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:08.402\nthink am I moving it or am I moving\nit over and drop it somewhere else,\n\n658\n00:33:08.402 --> 00:33:11.160\nthat's a little bit more of\na complex operation here.\n\n659\n00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.530\nBut you can see that we have\ntwo distribution points,\n\n660\n00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:20.440\nthey are Window servers, a member SMS\ndomain and SMS server SMS domain.\n\n661\n00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.170\nSo we can see all this we\ncan see distribution types,\n\n662\n00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:27.540\nstandard, right, eligible for reassignment\nyes to no this is interesting.\n\n663\n00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.320\nSo the one that's up at the top,\nit says yes.\n\n664\n00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.330\nThis one right here is going to be\na stand alone distribution point.\n\n665\n00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:38.640\nThe one below is a primary sites\nover distribution point as well.\n\n666\n00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.760\nWe can't re-assign that because it's got\nother site rolls associated with it.\n\n667\n00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.370\nSo, we can only do the distribution\npoints in the migration\n\n668\n00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.080\nthat are not already assigned.\n\n669\n00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.050\nIn other words, co-locate and\nco-hosting roles.\n\n670\n00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.470\nSo, we just wanna be aware of that cuz\nthese are the little things, right,\n\n671\n00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:56.430\nthat kinda bubble up and show up that\nwe'd have to think about and plan for.\n\n672\n00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.030\nNow, we also can see here,\nyeah we have if there are packages.\n\n673\n00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.780\nThat's the other thing I love about\nthe demo environment, you don't click and\n\n674\n00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.480\nlet go.\n\n675\n00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.910\nYour mouse goes all over with you,\nand you wind up scrolling everywhere.\n\n676\n00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.940\nSo we do have available disk space here,\nif we had packages.\n\n677\n00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.580\nYeah, that were hosted for migration.\n\n678\n00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.370\nWe'd see the list of packages,\nthings like that.\n\n679\n00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:18.260\nSo it's kind of interesting,\nwe're just gonna get this information.\n\n680\n00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.920\nBut what we do wanna be thinking about is,\n\n681\n00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.585\nhey, where would I go to find out, right,\nthat I have this issue with distribution\n\n682\n00:34:25.585 --> 00:34:29.425\npoints if they have other roles hosted\non them may not be able to migrate them.\n\n683\n00:34:29.425 --> 00:34:32.025\nThat set of checklists,\nthat Wes drew up for us,\n\n684\n00:34:32.025 --> 00:34:36.315\nif we take a look at the technical\ndocumentation these would all be places\n\n685\n00:34:36.315 --> 00:34:39.060\nwhere we actually can go in and\nwe can take a look for this.\n\n686\n00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.230\nSo, this would be something just to\nconsider, right, and to think about.\n\n687\n00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.676\nSo this will be helpful for us.\n\n688\n00:34:44.676 --> 00:34:46.660\nAll right, so\nnow that we've set up the basics.\n\n689\n00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:49.870\nWe've kind of created the initial\nconnection, configured the source\n\n690\n00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:53.400\nhierarchy, what we're gonna do\nnow is create a migration job.\n\n691\n00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:58.320\nAnd so we're gonna come down here,\ngonna go to migration jobs highlight that,\n\n692\n00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.700\nwe'll come up here.\n\n693\n00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.120\nWe have our create migration job item.\n\n694\n00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.150\nThis is going to detail out for us,\nour ability to be able to go in and\n\n695\n00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.590\nto start to connect and pull things over.\n\n696\n00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.065\nSo we're going to click on that.\n\n697\n00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:13.535\nWe get our wizard here and you will\nnotice we have quite a bit of stuff\n\n698\n00:35:13.535 --> 00:35:17.295\nthat we have specified here in the wizard\nso we are going to walk through this and\n\n699\n00:35:17.295 --> 00:35:18.675\nget this set up here.\n\n700\n00:35:18.675 --> 00:35:20.155\nGoing to scroll down.\n\n701\n00:35:20.155 --> 00:35:23.265\nFirst thing we are going\nto do is give it a name.\n\n702\n00:35:23.265 --> 00:35:30.650\nAgain, we can call this anything we like,\nI am going to call this objects.\n\n703\n00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:35.994\nWe'll do objects used by config mgr\n\n704\n00:35:35.994 --> 00:35:40.990\nclients, something like that.\n\n705\n00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:42.940\nSo we have a sense of what they are,\nright.\n\n706\n00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.850\nAnd then you may want to\nput a description in.\n\n707\n00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:49.130\nI'm not big on descriptions but\nyou can put them in if you'd like.\n\n708\n00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:54.670\nOur description will be Happy Friday or\nsomething like that.\n\n709\n00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:59.070\nBut you would put something a little bit\nmore meaningful in the real world, right?\n\n710\n00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.940\nNow, under Job type down here,\nlet's scroll down and scroll over so\n\n711\n00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.870\nwe can actually catch this.\n\n712\n00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:08.500\nRight, it says type of migration\njob determines what you can do or\n\n713\n00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.650\nwhat you can select.\n\n714\n00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.540\nEssentially, where I collect migrates and\njob migration or collection migration\n\n715\n00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:18.040\njobs, migrate collections, object\nmigration jobs, migrate only the objects\n\n716\n00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.540\nyou specify, so we have to specify what\nwe're going to do here, as you can see, or\n\n717\n00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.790\nobjects modified after migration,\nwhich will allow us to migrate objects\n\n718\n00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.340\nthat have changed since they were\nmigrated during a previous migration job.\n\n719\n00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.910\nMeaning, we may have deltas or\n\n720\n00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.160\nupdates over a certain period of\ntime as we're moving through this.\n\n721\n00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.170\nSo we're going to go ahead and\n\n722\n00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.370\nwe're going to specify collection\nmigration which is the default,\n\n723\n00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.210\ncuz we're going to start with our\ncollections, we're going to click there.\n\n724\n00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.630\nWe're going to click Next.\n\n725\n00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:46.290\nWe're going to have this come up.\n\n726\n00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.800\nWe didn't actually see it for very long.\n\n727\n00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.670\nIt just popped up there for a second,\nand we're not going to go through and\n\n728\n00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.950\ncount all these up.\n\n729\n00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:56.758\nBut it had actually a little pop-up\nbox that said, hey, 21 collections or\n\n730\n00:36:56.758 --> 00:36:58.570\n50 collections or whatever.\n\n731\n00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.300\nThat would be available, and so,\nyou actually are given the number, but\n\n732\n00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.800\nyou gotta be quick to see it,\nbecause literally, it pops in.\n\n733\n00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.120\nIt just disappears almost immediately.\n\n734\n00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.960\nSo, we can see here that we're gonna\nspecify what it is we would like.\n\n735\n00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.890\nPretty straightforward.\n\n736\n00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:15.660\nPut a check mark in the box or\nboxes for ones we way or may not want.\n\n737\n00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:20.020\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're going to go to main building here.\n\n738\n00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.040\nLet's just open up main building so\nwe can see that,\n\n739\n00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.040\nthere's a little hierarchy there.\n\n740\n00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.280\nAnd under main building, it's going to,\n\n741\n00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:31.010\nwhen we select, see that we do select\neverything if we click up at the top.\n\n742\n00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.976\nSo we're gonna choose that.\n\n743\n00:37:31.976 --> 00:37:34.137\nAnd what that does, essentially, for\n\n744\n00:37:34.137 --> 00:37:38.981\nthat is it'll bring over the main building\ncollection along with Floor 1 and Floor 2,\n\n745\n00:37:38.981 --> 00:37:41.549\nwhich are going to be\nnested sub collections.\n\n746\n00:37:41.549 --> 00:37:45.392\nRemember, we talk about the fact that we\nhave to deal with those in a certain way,\n\n747\n00:37:45.392 --> 00:37:48.895\nbut also notice or point out here,\njust randomly choose any one of these,\n\n748\n00:37:48.895 --> 00:37:52.679\neveryone of them at the end of the line of\nthe description and the parenthesis has\n\n749\n00:37:52.679 --> 00:37:56.352\nthe not migrated stamp, which right now\nmeans all of these are in the source,\n\n750\n00:37:56.352 --> 00:37:59.010\nit would have not come\nover to the destination.\n\n751\n00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.050\nAs we run this wizard, for\ninstance we came back and run this again\n\n752\n00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.540\nafter we just do main building now,\nwe're gonna see the main building and\n\n753\n00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.910\nits two sub-collections will read migrated\nand then the rest will say not migrated.\n\n754\n00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.800\nSo, we can do this in phases,\ncuz you may not want to bring over\n\n755\n00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.950\na 100 collections with\n50,000 clients all at once.\n\n756\n00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:19.840\nYou may want to do this in phases and\n\n757\n00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.240\nas a result,\nwe can run the wizard several times.\n\n758\n00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.360\nWe just want to be aware of that and\nobviously understand how that will work.\n\n759\n00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.660\nAll right so we've done that.\n\n760\n00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.350\nWe're then going to go ahead and\n\n761\n00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:33.530\nwe are going to also note, migrate objects\nassociated with specified collections,\n\n762\n00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:36.130\nbring over the objects as well\nas the collections themselves.\n\n763\n00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.055\nWe can actually just bring\nover the collection hierarchy.\n\n764\n00:38:39.055 --> 00:38:42.985\nLeave the objects behind and migrate them\nseparately using an object migration\n\n765\n00:38:42.985 --> 00:38:46.915\noption, second or third option down\non the prior screen selector or\n\n766\n00:38:46.915 --> 00:38:49.385\nwe can do them together,\nit's really up to us.\n\n767\n00:38:49.385 --> 00:38:51.365\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nwe're going to click Next,\n\n768\n00:38:51.365 --> 00:38:56.255\nwe'll associate that, no objects dependent\non the selected collections clear\n\n769\n00:38:56.255 --> 00:38:59.365\nthe migrate objects that are associated\nwith specified collection check box.\n\n770\n00:38:59.365 --> 00:39:02.135\nDid I check something that was\nnot supposed to be checked off?\n\n771\n00:39:02.135 --> 00:39:03.790\nLet me just make sure.\n\n772\n00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.590\nWe've got main building there and\nclick OK there.\n\n773\n00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:11.230\nLet me just check and\nmake sure we didn't do anything crazy.\n\n774\n00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:15.830\nAnd, all right, so wow, look at that.\n\n775\n00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.270\nWe had a bit of a problem.\n\n776\n00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.040\nLet me explain what\nthe error is real quick and\n\n777\n00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.670\ntell you how you're gonna fix this cuz\nthis can happen in the real world and\n\n778\n00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:25.020\nwe wanna understand why it's happening.\n\n779\n00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.700\nI made a boo boo.\n\n780\n00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.620\nThat is a technical term,\nby the way, for that.\n\n781\n00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.270\nSo, we are gonna tell you\nhow to fix it real quick.\n\n782\n00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.660\nWhat I did is and if we go back,\ntake a look at the screen and\n\n783\n00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.020\nI'll show you what's going on with it.\n\n784\n00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.008\nI actually selected an empty\ncollection without realizing it and\n\n785\n00:39:36.008 --> 00:39:38.352\nas a result of that,\nwe are getting an error there.\n\n786\n00:39:38.352 --> 00:39:41.535\nWhich essentially says, hey,\npay attention, there's not objects.\n\n787\n00:39:41.535 --> 00:39:43.575\nYou tell them you want to\nimport the objects but\n\n788\n00:39:43.575 --> 00:39:45.888\nyou got to have objects to\nimport in order to do that.\n\n789\n00:39:45.888 --> 00:39:48.758\nSo, I went ahead and\nI just left the error up for so\n\n790\n00:39:48.758 --> 00:39:52.612\nwe can see and what we're going to\ndo is just go ahead and click OK.\n\n791\n00:39:52.612 --> 00:39:53.467\nClear the error.\n\n792\n00:39:53.467 --> 00:39:56.993\nWe're going to select the main\nbuilding one as we were talking about,\n\n793\n00:39:56.993 --> 00:39:58.366\nin describing that to you,\n\n794\n00:39:58.366 --> 00:40:01.730\ntalking about the configuration\nof the hierarchy of the nesting.\n\n795\n00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:04.300\nI totally forgot that I\nhave to actually select\n\n796\n00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.710\nthe one that also had objects in it above\nthat, which is config manager clients.\n\n797\n00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.380\nSo that will do that as well.\n\n798\n00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.420\nAnd now that we've done that,\nwhen we click Next.\n\n799\n00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.220\nWhat we actually see is\nit does take a second.\n\n800\n00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.550\nAnd we actually get all of\nthe objects that we potentially have\n\n801\n00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:20.670\nthe ability to be able to go through and\nconfigure.\n\n802\n00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.850\nSo, now we'll see we'll be able to select\nthe objects that we want to actually\n\n803\n00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.700\nmigrate, or potentially the ones\nthat we do wanna migrate.\n\n804\n00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:31.010\nSo we're gonna go in and\nwe are going to select or\n\n805\n00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.320\nchoose here, once we've set this up,\nthe object types.\n\n806\n00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.410\nAnd we'll see Software Distribution\nDeployments, you'll see that right here.\n\n807\n00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.480\nWe have Software Distribution Packages.\n\n808\n00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.700\nI can't really extend that out, but\n\n809\n00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.090\nyou can read kind of what's\nthere configuration items.\n\n810\n00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:45.390\nWe got all sorts of stuff.\n\n811\n00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:48.180\nAnd under software distribution,\ndeployments,\n\n812\n00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.530\nyou'll see we have three items here.\n\n813\n00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:52.510\nWe have config manager 07 toolkit, so\n\n814\n00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.900\na package that was setup\nto deploy the tools.\n\n815\n00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:59.365\nWe have our DCM toolkit and\nwe've got a KB security patch or\n\n816\n00:40:59.365 --> 00:41:01.695\nsome sort of available update or\nwhatever it may be.\n\n817\n00:41:01.695 --> 00:41:03.865\nSome sort of reference to a package there.\n\n818\n00:41:03.865 --> 00:41:07.025\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna uncheck the KB1.\n\n819\n00:41:07.025 --> 00:41:11.280\nWe're not gonna bring that one over so\nessentially deselect that.\n\n820\n00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.510\nAnd we're then gonna go ahead and\n\n821\n00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:17.210\nwe are going to click\nSoftware Distribution Packages,\n\n822\n00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.570\nkind of just take a look at\nwhat's sitting here as well.\n\n823\n00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:23.910\nAnd since we have the deployment and we've\ndeselected the KB item on the deployment,\n\n824\n00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.620\nwe also have to come in here and\n\n825\n00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:30.980\nwe have to deselect the KB item which is\nthe linked item right for the package.\n\n826\n00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.310\nCuz we don't wanna not bring over\nthe deployment but bring over the package.\n\n827\n00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.420\nThere would be no way to reconcile that,\nwe'd get an error, right?\n\n828\n00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.292\nAnd since we've been so\ngood at getting errors so far.\n\n829\n00:41:39.292 --> 00:41:41.700\n[LAUGH] We want to avoid\nthem when at all possible.\n\n830\n00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.640\nSo we're actually going to go ahead and\ndeselect this one as well.\n\n831\n00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.800\nSo we just make sure we uncheck\nessentially both sides of that\n\n832\n00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.660\nparticular solution.\n\n833\n00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.410\nSo we are going to take care of that,\nmake sure we have done that.\n\n834\n00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:56.610\nWe are going to go down to configuration\nitems down here towards the bottom.\n\n835\n00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:59.630\nWe'll see that we'll have the SCCM Client.\n\n836\n00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:05.690\nNotice we also have 2003 SP2,\nServer image, the Vista SP1 image.\n\n837\n00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.790\nWe've got Windows XP SP3.\n\n838\n00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:12.010\nYou've got different items, different\nconfigurations that we're managing.\n\n839\n00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:16.220\nThat we probably had for operative system\ndeployments sitting on this source server.\n\n840\n00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.800\nSo we want to be aware of that as well.\n\n841\n00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.578\nWe're gonna go ahead and get rid of\nthe SCCM client because we're not\n\n842\n00:42:21.578 --> 00:42:25.292\ngonna bring over the old SCCM client\npackage, no reason for that for\n\n843\n00:42:25.292 --> 00:42:30.212\na baseline, we've got a new client,\nremember on the 12, 12 R2, 12 SP1 world.\n\n844\n00:42:30.212 --> 00:42:32.598\nAnd we're going to use that baseline and\nthat package, so\n\n845\n00:42:32.598 --> 00:42:34.845\nwe don't need this anymore essentially.\n\n846\n00:42:34.845 --> 00:42:37.875\nThe idea here is that we wanna be able\nto do a little house cleaning, right?\n\n847\n00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:42.795\nWanna get rid of as much garbage as\npossible that's no longer required\n\n848\n00:42:42.795 --> 00:42:45.995\ncuz it's gonna streamline the process,\nbut also make sure that what we\n\n849\n00:42:45.995 --> 00:42:50.495\nwind up with on the far side is actually\ngoing to be stuff that we need.\n\n850\n00:42:50.495 --> 00:42:54.705\nAnd so, we see that we have an Excluded\nObjects dialogue box that pops up.\n\n851\n00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:58.830\nWarns us, says hey, we're about to exclude\nthis particular item from the migration.\n\n852\n00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.365\nSo we just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n853\n00:43:00.365 --> 00:43:02.920\nIt' not asking us to do anything\nother than acknowledge it,\n\n854\n00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.580\nnotice we're not making a choice,\nwe're not checking or\n\n855\n00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.920\nunchecking, we're just\nsimply hitting Continue.\n\n856\n00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.310\nNo problem, we're just acknowledging\nthat we're going to do that,\n\n857\n00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:11.200\nno big deal at all.\n\n858\n00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.890\nSo we've done all that,\nwe're just going to come down here\n\n859\n00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:18.150\nJust get down towards the bottom here so\nwe can see.\n\n860\n00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.480\nNext we're gonna leave everything else\nalone and then we're gonna go ahead,\n\n861\n00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.410\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n862\n00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:26.210\nWe'll give that just a second and come\nback up here because I love scrolling up\n\n863\n00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:28.660\nand down and\nsideways as we go through here.\n\n864\n00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.640\nThe create migration job\nwas your content ownership\n\n865\n00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.080\nbox essentially is going to show up here.\n\n866\n00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.877\nYou'll see that we have the source server,\n\n867\n00:43:36.877 --> 00:43:40.515\nwe see we have the designation for\nthe destination site.\n\n868\n00:43:40.515 --> 00:43:43.606\nSo see we're going from TST SMS\nserver essentially over\n\n869\n00:43:43.606 --> 00:43:48.000\nto MCM Config Manager 12 R2 Primary site,\nthat's what we want to see.\n\n870\n00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.520\nSo content ownership.\n\n871\n00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.610\nWe're essentially doing the mapping here.\n\n872\n00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:55.040\nLet's scroll down, let's click Next.\n\n873\n00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.390\nWe're going to now be able to see\nthe security scope part of the wizard.\n\n874\n00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:03.290\nWe're going to be able to assign\nthe security scope to apply to\n\n875\n00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:04.700\nthe migrated objects.\n\n876\n00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.464\nNotice that by design here we only\nhave the default security scope,\n\n877\n00:44:08.464 --> 00:44:12.704\nwe haven't made any others on the 12\nR2 side, if we did we would see them.\n\n878\n00:44:12.704 --> 00:44:16.720\nWe talked about security scopes in another\nepisode, encourage you to go back and\n\n879\n00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.494\ntake a look at that if you\ndon't remember what they are,\n\n880\n00:44:19.494 --> 00:44:23.155\nhad a pretty good thorough conversation\nabout role based designation and\n\n881\n00:44:23.155 --> 00:44:26.725\ndelegation of the management rights and\nthen scopes and how they work.\n\n882\n00:44:26.725 --> 00:44:28.980\nSo, you just wanna go back,\ntake a look at that at some point.\n\n883\n00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.280\nWe're gonna choose Default here, so\nlet me just check that off real quick.\n\n884\n00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.540\nWe're gonna come down here.\n\n885\n00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:38.210\nAnd you'll notice though, that you can\neither choose that, or notice that we also\n\n886\n00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:43.220\nhave the option here to actually create\nanother Scope if we choose to, or need to.\n\n887\n00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.380\nSo, we create one on the fly,\nwe're not gonna do that right now.\n\n888\n00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.050\nBut we could if we needed to, so\nwe have the option either way.\n\n889\n00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:52.570\nWe're just going to with that\ndefault one that is setting there.\n\n890\n00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:54.460\nWe're going to click Next.\n\n891\n00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.850\nWe're then going to come in,\nand we are, scroll back up, so\n\n892\n00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:02.635\nyou can see a collection limiting, so if\nwe're going to do any collection limiting,\n\n893\n00:45:02.635 --> 00:45:04.635\nwe would be able to set that up here.\n\n894\n00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:07.748\nWe're not going to do that by\ndefault decide to do that, but\n\n895\n00:45:07.748 --> 00:45:09.945\nwe would have an option\nto if we wanted to.\n\n896\n00:45:09.945 --> 00:45:15.319\nSo we'll be able to come in here,\nclick Next, we will then go in and we will\n\n897\n00:45:15.319 --> 00:45:21.416\nhave our site code replacements item or\nopportunity here we'll just come up here.\n\n898\n00:45:21.416 --> 00:45:24.735\nSo choose destination site codes to\nreplace site codes from the source\n\n899\n00:45:24.735 --> 00:45:28.443\nhierarchy, so we would be able to go in if\nwe needed to and would be able to modify\n\n900\n00:45:28.443 --> 00:45:32.493\nsite codes, we're not gonna deal with that\nright now, but we'll deal with that when\n\n901\n00:45:32.493 --> 00:45:35.475\nwe do the clients,\nwhen we deal with the clients, all right?\n\n902\n00:45:35.475 --> 00:45:37.505\nSo, we're not gonna worry about that for\nthe moment, but\n\n903\n00:45:37.505 --> 00:45:39.715\nwe would have that option here as well.\n\n904\n00:45:39.715 --> 00:45:42.275\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll click Next and\n\n905\n00:45:42.275 --> 00:45:47.700\nthen we've essentially got our summary or\nreview information item.\n\n906\n00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.640\nSo couple of things just want to\npoint out to you here quickly.\n\n907\n00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.480\nWe are going to have right here\nobjects that might be modified.\n\n908\n00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.050\nWe see a listing of those objects.\n\n909\n00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:00.680\nScroll over here,\nnotice we have the option to Save To File.\n\n910\n00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.850\nI often tell my customers that\nthey're gonna do this themselves.\n\n911\n00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:06.660\nI do this when I do this\non behalf of customers.\n\n912\n00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.420\nSave these files off.\n\n913\n00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:12.870\nFor documentation purposes, make sure you\nhave them, they're good to refer back to.\n\n914\n00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.710\nSo if we wanted to save this, right?\n\n915\n00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.690\nLet's just hit save to file.\n\n916\n00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:20.210\nWe just get a little dialog box,\nno big deal.\n\n917\n00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:23.020\nOpens up here,\nlet's just move this over, and\n\n918\n00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:27.300\nI will usually put this out somewhere\nwhere I can find it, right?\n\n919\n00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:31.480\nJust so I'm not going to lose it Document\nlibrary is good, Desktop is good.\n\n920\n00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.980\nWherever you could remember [LAUGH]\nobviously and know where it is.\n\n921\n00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.290\nNotice it is could be\nsaved as a Text file.\n\n922\n00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:39.400\nSo it's just gonna be\na notepad friendly file.\n\n923\n00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:44.200\nSo we may go ahead and call this,\n\n924\n00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.630\nSCCM, Mig for Migration,\n\n925\n00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:52.960\nP1 for part one or whatever, come up with\na name or something that makes sense.\n\n926\n00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.020\nWe will go ahead and save that off just so\n\n927\n00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.810\nwe have a copy of it and then when\nwe're done we'll click next here,\n\n928\n00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:05.050\nwe're then going to come in and\nwe're gonna schedule this migration job.\n\n929\n00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:09.030\nSo we're gonna specify essentially\nwhen we want this to occur, so\n\n930\n00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:13.750\nwe're gonna be able to go in, and we can\neither set up and run a schedule here,\n\n931\n00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.990\nand essentially create\na time to deployment.\n\n932\n00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.970\nWe can decide not to run\nthe migration job right now.\n\n933\n00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:22.620\nPark it, essentially run it for later.\n\n934\n00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.740\nRun it right now.\n\n935\n00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.390\nSchedule it for later.\n\n936\n00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:29.310\nDo not migrate updated objects or\ndo migrate them.\n\n937\n00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:32.060\nHow do we want to deal\nwith conflict resolution?\n\n938\n00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.990\nIf we already have objects\nthat are existing,\n\n939\n00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:35.690\nwe're gonna migrate over the top of them.\n\n940\n00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:37.900\nMaybe we don't want to do that,\nso no replace.\n\n941\n00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.720\nEssentially just migrate clean objects so\nwe have to specify how we want to do that.\n\n942\n00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.280\nWe have some choices here, right?\n\n943\n00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.910\nWe'll be able to decide\nwhat it is we want to do.\n\n944\n00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:49.658\nWe'll just go ahead and\nleave the defaults in place.\n\n945\n00:47:49.658 --> 00:47:56.621\nLet me just scroll down right here,\nand then we will click Next.\n\n946\n00:47:56.621 --> 00:48:01.220\nIt will give us an all up summary,\nessentially of everything right?\n\n947\n00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.100\nClick Next.\n\n948\n00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.580\nCreate the job wizard\ncompleted successfully.\n\n949\n00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.900\nThat's what we wanna see so\n\n950\n00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:13.110\nlet's go over here, we'll hit Close,\nlet that do it' thing.\n\n951\n00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:18.440\nAll right so we're gonna come over\nhere and we have this, right?\n\n952\n00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:22.110\nWe have our job, it's now essentially\nsitting here, as you can see.\n\n953\n00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:29.450\nAnd we are going to come over here.\n\n954\n00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:33.980\nWe see our objects in the job, so\nwe can see them all listed here,\n\n955\n00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.880\nwhat's happening, all the things\nthat we're gonna bring over, and\n\n956\n00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.520\nall the stuff that may be involved.\n\n957\n00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.840\nAnd now we're gonna be able to see\nall that list of migration items.\n\n958\n00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.540\nAnd we're gonna obviously go in and\n\n959\n00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.080\nwe're now going to want to\nmonitor the migration job.\n\n960\n00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.090\nSo we're gonna click on it or\nat least take a look at it.\n\n961\n00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:50.960\nSee what's happening here.\n\n962\n00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.125\nRight, and we'll come in.\n\n963\n00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:56.259\nLet's go over to migration.\n\n964\n00:48:59.057 --> 00:49:02.648\nYou'll see that down here under summary,\nlet me just kinda scroll over and\n\n965\n00:49:02.648 --> 00:49:03.340\nscroll down.\n\n966\n00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.860\nIt's a little bit hard to see.\n\n967\n00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.510\nWe could see that we have a job that,\nwhoops,\n\n968\n00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:11.520\nthat's why it's hard to see cuz [LAUGH] it\ndoesn't let go when I click you'll see,\n\n969\n00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.250\nlet me just see if I could,\nyeah there we go.\n\n970\n00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.960\nSo you'll see we have a migration\njob status, it is in progress, so\n\n971\n00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.470\nit's running.\n\n972\n00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:18.650\nWe're gonna have to wait obviously.\n\n973\n00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.710\nThose take sometimes a bit of time.\n\n974\n00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:25.000\nIt does depend on how big the job is,\nhow much stuff you're asking it to do.\n\n975\n00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.792\nIt can take many minutes,\nit can take an hour, a few minutes.\n\n976\n00:49:29.792 --> 00:49:35.981\nIt's hard to say for sure, but notice of\nthe possible total objects that we have,\n\n977\n00:49:35.981 --> 00:49:40.376\n91, and of course all\nthe opportunities we have there,\n\n978\n00:49:40.376 --> 00:49:44.610\nwe are waiting and\nwe are trying to get an update on this.\n\n979\n00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:48.500\nLet me scroll back up here, so\nlet's go in and view migration jobs, so\n\n980\n00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.760\nlet's just click there and\nlet's just come back over here.\n\n981\n00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.170\nSo you'll see it does\nsay status completed.\n\n982\n00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.570\nSo it has actually updated in the minute\nor two we've been clicking around.\n\n983\n00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.440\nDoesn't take very long on\nthe demo because we're really not\n\n984\n00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.790\nmigrating a lot of stuff, right?\n\n985\n00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:02.630\nLet's try to keep it\nrelatively straight forward.\n\n986\n00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.180\nSo that's actually completed.\n\n987\n00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:09.250\nSo the fact that that's been done means\nthat now we actually can go ahead and\n\n988\n00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:12.040\nwe can begin to see some\nof those migrated objects,\n\n989\n00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.330\nin theory,\nthat may have been brought over, right?\n\n990\n00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:17.480\nSo we'd be able to go out,\nwe'd be able to start looking at for\n\n991\n00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:21.600\ninstance the collections and be able to\nsee that hopefully those have shown up.\n\n992\n00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.270\nBut before we go there, let's go in and\nlets go take a look and\n\n993\n00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:31.295\nlets create another migration job and\nlets actually bring over objects.\n\n994\n00:50:31.295 --> 00:50:35.215\nWe brought over just the collections.\n\n995\n00:50:35.215 --> 00:50:37.345\nNow we want to actually\ngo do another migration.\n\n996\n00:50:37.345 --> 00:50:40.865\nWe're breaking it down for you right and\ndoing it piece by piece but\n\n997\n00:50:40.865 --> 00:50:43.802\nin the real world you'd have to do\ncollections separate from objects.\n\n998\n00:50:43.802 --> 00:50:45.602\nSo you're gonna follow these steps,\n\n999\n00:50:45.602 --> 00:50:49.012\nmaking sure you understand this\nis a multi phase solution.\n\n1000\n00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:51.472\nWe're gonna engage in\ndifferent migrations.\n\n1001\n00:50:51.472 --> 00:50:52.452\nSo we're gonna go in now and\n\n1002\n00:50:52.452 --> 00:50:55.352\nwe're gonna run another\nmigration job essentially right?\n\n1003\n00:50:55.352 --> 00:50:59.312\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and we can just\nright click to create a migration job.\n\n1004\n00:50:59.312 --> 00:51:00.732\nWe can go up and create one.\n\n1005\n00:51:00.732 --> 00:51:02.602\nYou've seen me do either one here.\n\n1006\n00:51:02.602 --> 00:51:04.482\nLet's create a brand new migration job.\n\n1007\n00:51:04.482 --> 00:51:13.480\nThis time we'll call this\nmigration job Objects for SCCM.\n\n1008\n00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.310\nThe name itself doesn't really matter.\n\n1009\n00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:19.910\nAgain, it's really just to keep track of\nwhat we're doing more than anything else.\n\n1010\n00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:25.320\nWe'll do Hello World as\nopposed to Happy Friday.\n\n1011\n00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.460\nAnd let's scroll down here.\n\n1012\n00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:28.630\nAnd this time,\n\n1013\n00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:33.430\ninstead of collection migration, we're\ngonna choose object migration, right?\n\n1014\n00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:37.090\nCuz now we wanna bring over\nobjects that are going to be\n\n1015\n00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.550\npart of the list of\nthings we can bring over.\n\n1016\n00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:43.160\nNow, you're gonna remember, hopefully,\nfor some of the objects we can migrate.\n\n1017\n00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.550\nThings like boundaries,\nvirtual application packages,\n\n1018\n00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:50.380\noperating system OSD-related\nitems like boot images,\n\n1019\n00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:55.590\ndriver packages drivers, images, the boot\nimages as well as the images themselves.\n\n1020\n00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:58.700\nThe WIM images right as\nwell as the boot images.\n\n1021\n00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:03.230\nTask sequencing,\nasset intelligence catalogues,\n\n1022\n00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:06.960\nhardware requirements, all the user\ndefined categorizations there.\n\n1023\n00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.780\nSo all the customizations along\nwith software metering rules.\n\n1024\n00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.210\nThese will be the things that potentially\nare gonna be available to us.\n\n1025\n00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.810\nSo got quite a bit of options here, so\n\n1026\n00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:17.330\nwe'll see we have quite\na few to choose from.\n\n1027\n00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.970\nAnd we're just gonna scroll up here so we\ncan see that we have to make some choices,\n\n1028\n00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:21.740\nof course.\n\n1029\n00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.870\nWe're gonna go into Boundaries here.\n\n1030\n00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.990\nAnd we'll see we have one boundary\nthat is potentially available, so\n\n1031\n00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.800\nlet's highlight that.\n\n1032\n00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.330\nYou'll see it's right here.\n\n1033\n00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:31.330\nSo we can check that off and select that.\n\n1034\n00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:32.770\nAnd we'll obviously bring that over.\n\n1035\n00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:34.010\nNotice, not migrated yet.\n\n1036\n00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.700\nSo, we can do that.\n\n1037\n00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:40.160\nWe can go in and\nselect Virtual Application Packages.\n\n1038\n00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.640\nYou'll see that we have two\nApp-V packages that can be used.\n\n1039\n00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.110\nSo we can bring those over.\n\n1040\n00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:48.630\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe will select those.\n\n1041\n00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:49.700\nHave those come in.\n\n1042\n00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.830\nWe can go in and\ndo a Asset Intelligence Catalog.\n\n1043\n00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:55.040\nSo let's just come down here.\n\n1044\n00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.890\nWe have three objects available.\n\n1045\n00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:59.860\nThe reason I'm saying three before\nI click, you may be able to see\n\n1046\n00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.490\nthere's a 0/ Fashion a number at the end\nof every one of these in parentheses.\n\n1047\n00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:06.550\nThe number on the far side of\nthat slash sign is the number\n\n1048\n00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.110\nof objects that are listed\nthat we will actually see\n\n1049\n00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:11.630\nas objects that we\nare potentially able to grab.\n\n1050\n00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:13.970\nSo when I look quickly,\nI go, there's a three.\n\n1051\n00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:17.647\nI know there's three objects and that's\nwhy I'm telling you before you see them,\n\n1052\n00:53:17.647 --> 00:53:19.800\nthere's three or five or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n1053\n00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.860\nSo we're doing\nan Asset Intelligence Catalog,\n\n1054\n00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:25.870\nso we're gonna select those,\nbring those items in as well.\n\n1055\n00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:28.960\nAnd then we could obviously go through and\ndo the rest of these.\n\n1056\n00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.300\nWe're not gonna bother with all of them\nbut you get the general idea here.\n\n1057\n00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.940\nWe could select a whole bunch\nof these depending on what it is\n\n1058\n00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:35.910\nwe would like to do.\n\n1059\n00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:38.500\nSo now that we've got a sampling\nlet me just scroll down here.\n\n1060\n00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:42.530\nLet me click Next.\n\n1061\n00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:46.920\nBring that over here, we get back to\nour ownership where we are assigning\n\n1062\n00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.590\nownership from source to destination,\nwe've seen this already.\n\n1063\n00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:53.429\nI didn't show you last time, but let me\njust show you quickly just at the end of\n\n1064\n00:53:53.429 --> 00:53:55.584\nthis line, although we don't\nhave another option here.\n\n1065\n00:53:55.584 --> 00:53:59.738\nThere is a pull down, if we add primary\nsites and we were choosing between them,\n\n1066\n00:53:59.738 --> 00:54:01.102\nwe may have more than one,\n\n1067\n00:54:01.102 --> 00:54:05.600\nwe'd have to choose which primary site\nwe would wanna actually migrate into.\n\n1068\n00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.850\nOur hierarchy in the lab and\nthem demo's very straightforward, very,\n\n1069\n00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:10.110\nvery slim lined.\n\n1070\n00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.600\nOr streamline, but in the real world\nyou may have multiple primary sites.\n\n1071\n00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.050\nRemember that, so\nyeah we may actually have an option here.\n\n1072\n00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.090\nWe just want to make sure\nwe're calling that out,\n\n1073\n00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:19.640\nthat you guys are at least aware of that.\n\n1074\n00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.740\nAll right, so\nwe've made our determination there,\n\n1075\n00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:25.240\nwe're going to click Next here,\nwe have to specify our scope.\n\n1076\n00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.190\nWe did this the last time.\n\n1077\n00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:30.710\nRemember the wizard essentially\nlooks the same in the further areas\n\n1078\n00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:35.630\nout here as we're doing all\nthe standardized choices for ownership for\n\n1079\n00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:38.860\na scope for scheduling,\nthat's gonna look the same.\n\n1080\n00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.850\nThat part that's different\nis the part upfront where\n\n1081\n00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:42.230\nwe're making the object choices.\n\n1082\n00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:43.830\nThat's really the only\ndifference here as we go.\n\n1083\n00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:48.360\nWe're here to go ahead and we're gonna\naccept our default, so we'll hit that.\n\n1084\n00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.030\nWe'll hit Next here.\n\n1085\n00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:55.830\nYou'll see here we are getting our\nsummary of what's gonna happen.\n\n1086\n00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:58.560\nWe could save that out to file,\nagain, if we choose to.\n\n1087\n00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.440\nI've done it once,\nI'm not gonna bother doing it again.\n\n1088\n00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.390\nBut you got the general idea there.\n\n1089\n00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:03.370\nWe could do that.\n\n1090\n00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:04.800\nWe get our schedule, right?\n\n1091\n00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.790\nAnd we can specify here.\n\n1092\n00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:11.900\nRun now, where I don't migrate\nupdated objects means don't overwrite\n\n1093\n00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.010\nany new objects on top of older ones.\n\n1094\n00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:16.690\nOnly bring over new objects that\nhave not been migrated already.\n\n1095\n00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:18.450\nIt'll be up to us to decide, but\n\n1096\n00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:21.830\nessentially we can specify\nwhat we want here as you know.\n\n1097\n00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:23.500\nWe'll just go ahead and click Next.\n\n1098\n00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.810\nWe'll click Next.\n\n1099\n00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:27.470\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Close.\n\n1100\n00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:28.320\nWe'll come back here.\n\n1101\n00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:33.070\nWe'll see that job is not started yet\neven though it actually is started.\n\n1102\n00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:40.030\nLet's come back out over here and let's\ngo back up to our score card/dashboard.\n\n1103\n00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:45.116\nWe could see one in progress, one that\nis completed, so it is actually working.\n\n1104\n00:55:45.116 --> 00:55:49.726\nAnd as we scroll down we'll wait for\nthat to happen.\n\n1105\n00:55:49.726 --> 00:55:51.431\nLet's come back over here.\n\n1106\n00:55:51.431 --> 00:55:55.165\nWe can wait for an update on that.\n\n1107\n00:55:55.165 --> 00:55:56.296\nYou'll see that's running.\n\n1108\n00:55:56.296 --> 00:55:57.301\nEventually it will finish.\n\n1109\n00:55:57.301 --> 00:56:00.440\nIt just takes a minute or two to run.\n\n1110\n00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.860\nThis takes a little bit longer,\nbut not by much.\n\n1111\n00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.100\nBut we'll see that it will\neventually finish up.\n\n1112\n00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.430\nWhen it does finish up, we'll be able to\ngo in, and we'll be able to take a look.\n\n1113\n00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:11.210\nAnd we will go verify that\nthings are there, right?\n\n1114\n00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:13.340\nTrust but verify is always important.\n\n1115\n00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:18.150\nSo we'll click away here for a second,\nclick to come back forcing a refresh.\n\n1116\n00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:21.050\nSee it is completed, again,\nit doesn't take very long.\n\n1117\n00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:24.480\nRemember in the real world, if you were\nbringing over operating systems images\n\n1118\n00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.650\nthat could be,\nthe Whim images that you capture,\n\n1119\n00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:30.560\ncould be, I don't know several gigabytes\nin size, right, depending on what\n\n1120\n00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.670\nyou're working on, what OS you're\nworking on, that could take a while.\n\n1121\n00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:37.110\nI mean, those images when we capture them\nup initially as you will have seen if\n\n1122\n00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:40.540\nyou've watched the operating system\ndeployment episodes that we've shot for\n\n1123\n00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.600\nyou will potentially take a while.\n\n1124\n00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.360\nSo this is a relatively short migration\nbecause we're really just doing\n\n1125\n00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.700\nsome small apps packages.\n\n1126\n00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.880\nI mean, PowerPoint Paint and Word Viewer.\n\n1127\n00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.930\nVery, very small.\n\n1128\n00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:54.200\nBut if you had a package for\nOffice 2016 or something like that.\n\n1129\n00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.050\nA couple of gigs in size.\n\n1130\n00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:57.790\nSeveral operating system images.\n\n1131\n00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:01.207\nThis migration path could 30 minutes,\n40 minutes, an hour.\n\n1132\n00:57:01.207 --> 00:57:03.660\nDepends on the speed of\nthe underlying network and\n\n1133\n00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:04.550\nthe kind of bandwidth you have.\n\n1134\n00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:07.180\nSo you wanna just keep that in mind,\nmake you aware of that.\n\n1135\n00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.790\nLet's go in and\nlet's actually verify what we did now.\n\n1136\n00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:12.140\nSo we're gonna go back and\ntake a look full screen here.\n\n1137\n00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.120\nSo we can actually see what we're doing.\n\n1138\n00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:19.710\nAnd let's go in, let's come in here to\nassets and compliance to that workspace.\n\n1139\n00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:22.180\nLet's go into our device collections.\n\n1140\n00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:26.780\nSo we'll bring this up here for a second\nand we'll go in and what we want to\n\n1141\n00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:31.200\nlook for is we want to go ahead and make\nsure that we ultimately see main building.\n\n1142\n00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.460\nNow it's interesting, it's not there yet,\nI'm going to refresh this for you and\n\n1143\n00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.820\nshow you why it's not there but\nlet's just take a look,\n\n1144\n00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:42.360\nthese are the collections that are there\nin 2012 before we do the migration, right?\n\n1145\n00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.420\nNow what we have to keep in mind, I've\ntalked about this in other episodes is,\n\n1146\n00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.640\nthis list the collections comes\nout of the site systems, or\n\n1147\n00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.620\nexcuse me, the SCCM database.\n\n1148\n00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.520\nThe site database.\n\n1149\n00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.190\nThat database has the updated\ninformation in it.\n\n1150\n00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:59.850\nBut it's not necessarily pulled into\nthe console unless we force an update on\n\n1151\n00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:01.650\ncollections and on membership.\n\n1152\n00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:05.530\nSo we have to come in and we have to do\nthis in order to see it represented here.\n\n1153\n00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:08.200\nBecause the collection Device Collection,\n\n1154\n00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.890\nUser Collection update,\ndoesn't happen automatically all the time.\n\n1155\n00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:13.980\nAnd unless we close out the console and\n\n1156\n00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:18.300\nreopen it, forcing it to pull new data\nfrom the database, it may not show up.\n\n1157\n00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.600\nNow we could do that, but\nthat's a little drastic.\n\n1158\n00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:25.120\nInstead, what we are going to do here is,\nwe're going to come over here.\n\n1159\n00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.110\nAnd lets actually, let's do it this way.\n\n1160\n00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:31.440\nLet's do a refresh, let's come up here.\n\n1161\n00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.570\nLet's do a refresh right here.\n\n1162\n00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:34.390\nAnd that's going to refresh.\n\n1163\n00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:36.582\nLet's see if we can get that to show up.\n\n1164\n00:58:36.582 --> 00:58:42.400\nIf we are not going to get that.\n\n1165\n00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.840\nLet's do one other thing here real quick.\n\n1166\n00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:49.398\nActually that's not what I\nwanted to do but let's go back.\n\n1167\n00:58:49.398 --> 00:58:51.490\nThat may very we'll force it.\n\n1168\n00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:52.407\nThere we go, that will force it.\n\n1169\n00:58:52.407 --> 00:58:54.825\nAnyway, more than one way\nto get to the same place.\n\n1170\n00:58:54.825 --> 00:58:57.968\nI was just going to actually come out and\ngo directly back in but\n\n1171\n00:58:57.968 --> 00:59:00.749\ndoing a show membership forces\na collection update and\n\n1172\n00:59:00.749 --> 00:59:03.902\nit shows you all the collections so\nthat works out either way.\n\n1173\n00:59:03.902 --> 00:59:07.624\nSo you can see that we've\nbrought a bunch in here, and\n\n1174\n00:59:07.624 --> 00:59:11.450\nyou will see where we are at,\nMember primary unknown.\n\n1175\n00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:12.220\nActually wait, no.\n\n1176\n00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.790\nWhat we want is not that.\n\n1177\n00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:14.720\nThat was not the right one.\n\n1178\n00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.810\nWant to go back there\nto Device Collections.\n\n1179\n00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:18.520\nAll right, so that still did not update.\n\n1180\n00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.930\nSo let's do the following cuz\nwhat we want ultimately is this.\n\n1181\n00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:27.235\nLet me just scroll over here and\nlet me do this.\n\n1182\n00:59:27.235 --> 00:59:29.760\nLet;s just close out real quick and\nopen this back up.\n\n1183\n00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:34.910\nAnd this is why we wanna create\nshortcuts on the desktop, so\n\n1184\n00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:36.860\nwe can get into them\na little more quickly.\n\n1185\n00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.700\nAll right, so we'll wait for\nthis to come up.\n\n1186\n00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.600\nNow, we may not see the collection\nupdate for some time.\n\n1187\n00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:48.360\nRemember, it does depend on the database\nactually registering the update,\n\n1188\n00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.820\nand actually showing it to us.\n\n1189\n00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:53.130\nWe know the migration completed\nsuccessfully, so we know it's there.\n\n1190\n00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:56.620\nBut, we also may not see it right away,\ncuz we have to wait for\n\n1191\n00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:58.240\nthe database actually to reference it.\n\n1192\n00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.170\nBut, if we open up here,\nwe will see Main Buildings, and\n\n1193\n01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:02.950\nwe can see that it is there.\n\n1194\n01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:06.820\nAnd we can see that it is gonna have,\nwhat, Floor 1 and Floor 2, right?\n\n1195\n01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.890\nSo, we can see all that.\n\n1196\n01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.310\nSo, we'll see Main Building is there.\n\n1197\n01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:12.250\nIf we go in and we take a look,\nwhat else do we do,\n\n1198\n01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.970\nasset intelligence I think, right?\n\n1199\n01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:19.210\nWe did asset intelligence so if we go in\nand we go to our asset intelligence space\n\n1200\n01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:23.070\nas we did migrate those objects over\nduring the second round with objects.\n\n1201\n01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:25.770\nAnd we go on here and we go to catalog.\n\n1202\n01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:30.580\nWe can come in here we'll wait for that\nto come up and what we can see is we will\n\n1203\n01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:36.010\nhave a, let me see if we can go\ndown here and just scroll over.\n\n1204\n01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:39.400\nWe will have a validated state here for\n\n1205\n01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.430\nall the items that are either\ngoing to be brought over.\n\n1206\n01:00:44.815 --> 01:00:46.875\nAnd the ones that\nare user defined as well.\n\n1207\n01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:50.335\nSo we'll see that the ones that\nhave validated and user defined.\n\n1208\n01:00:50.335 --> 01:00:52.705\nAnd we can differentiate between the two.\n\n1209\n01:00:52.705 --> 01:00:56.375\nThe user defined items and\nthe validated state items.\n\n1210\n01:00:56.375 --> 01:00:59.655\nThese are the ones that\nwe have brought over.\n\n1211\n01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:05.410\nAs we can see, almost all of these,\nare coming over the 07 area.\n\n1212\n01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:08.350\nSo we can see, whoopsies,\nI hate that scroll up and down thing.\n\n1213\n01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:09.560\nI cannot stand that.\n\n1214\n01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:14.060\nSo we have all this brought over, we also\ncan take a look at compliance settings in\n\n1215\n01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.820\nhere, in theory, if we wanted to.\n\n1216\n01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:20.410\nAnd we can go in and open this up, take\na look at our configuration items cuz we\n\n1217\n01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:24.630\nbrought some of those over, and we can\nobviously randomly sample where we are,\n\n1218\n01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:29.160\nbut remember we brought over Server 2003,\nVista, XP, so\n\n1219\n01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.030\nthese are all obviously objects that have\nbeen brought over and we can see this.\n\n1220\n01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:35.700\nWe also will have the ability to go in and\n\n1221\n01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:42.080\nwe can take a look at\nConfiguration baselines.\n\n1222\n01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.210\nThe client operating system is there,\nright?\n\n1223\n01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:46.240\nWe were able to see this one.\n\n1224\n01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.030\nThis was the one that was migrated over so\nwe have that one.\n\n1225\n01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:53.120\nWe also, under reporting,\nwill have, so let's come in here.\n\n1226\n01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.980\nLet's go here real quick.\n\n1227\n01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.920\nAn interesting report that we can look at.\n\n1228\n01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.340\nLet me just go in here, go here.\n\n1229\n01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:01.650\nJust open this up real quick.\n\n1230\n01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:02.760\nGive this a second.\n\n1231\n01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.800\nSo we're actually also gonna be able\nto go in and see a set of reports\n\n1232\n01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.830\nspecific to migration, which will allow us\nto get some information on what we did.\n\n1233\n01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:13.290\nSo let's just scroll down right here.\n\n1234\n01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:14.920\nWe've got our migration reports.\n\n1235\n01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.140\nAnd notice that we have I believe six\nreports that are available, five reports\n\n1236\n01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:23.190\nthat are available for us specifically\nto show us the migration path and\n\n1237\n01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:26.900\nthings we've done, some objects that may\nhave failed, the migration jobs we ran and\n\n1238\n01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:31.480\nthe properties of them, clients and\nexclusion lists, if we excluded something\n\n1239\n01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.170\nlike the SSCM client, the old client,\nwould show up under that.\n\n1240\n01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:36.580\nSo if we wanna run, for instance,\n\n1241\n01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.700\nmigration jobs, we wanna take a look\nat that one and we do a run here,\n\n1242\n01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.390\nwhat we would find is we would be\nable to take a look at this report.\n\n1243\n01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:47.590\nWe just have to wait for\nthe information to populate.\n\n1244\n01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:49.230\nIt takes a minute to come up.\n\n1245\n01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.610\nAnd eventually we'll be able\nto make a decision here and\n\n1246\n01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:55.080\nyou would be able to view the report.\n\n1247\n01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.640\nOnce the definition is read and\n\n1248\n01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.250\nwe contact the database and do all\nthe backend stuff we got to do to run it.\n\n1249\n01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:02.000\nBut we are actually going\nto be able to run this and\n\n1250\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.860\nsee a list of migration\njobs if we choose to.\n\n1251\n01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.287\nWe could go in and do a report like this.\n\n1252\n01:03:07.287 --> 01:03:11.020\nThere we go, we just have to wait for\nit to populate and read all the values.\n\n1253\n01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.920\nFigure out what we need, right?\n\n1254\n01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.120\nAnd so, once it catches up,\nthere we go, it's got to wait for\n\n1255\n01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.850\nit to realize that we actually\nwant to use the report and\n\n1256\n01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:22.080\nthat we're not really thinking about\njust taking a look without running it.\n\n1257\n01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.250\nSo you can see that we can do a job type\nhere, we can specify value date range,\n\n1258\n01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:29.030\nyou know, if we have more than one job,\nwhat range we want to do.\n\n1259\n01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:32.025\nSo we could go and drill through and\nbe a little bit more specific.\n\n1260\n01:03:32.025 --> 01:03:34.423\nOnce we get all that, we do View Report.\n\n1261\n01:03:34.423 --> 01:03:37.708\nTakes a minute, it'll go out,\ngrab the data for us and in this case,\n\n1262\n01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:41.221\nbecause we only have two, it's easy\njust to run it, and you could see that\n\n1263\n01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:44.865\nwe actually have our two reports, or\nour two items that come back, rather.\n\n1264\n01:03:44.865 --> 01:03:49.031\nWe can see when they ran,\nwe can see the source.\n\n1265\n01:03:49.031 --> 01:03:53.033\nDrill through on any one of those, and we\ncan see all of the object types that may\n\n1266\n01:03:53.033 --> 01:03:56.030\nhave been migrated,\ntheir object IDs, their status.\n\n1267\n01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:57.860\nThere's a lot of good information here,\nright?\n\n1268\n01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.130\nSo we actually can tell what's going on,\nsee all the objects.\n\n1269\n01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:03.150\nSo from a reporting perspective,\n\n1270\n01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:07.410\nreally important to make sure that we're\nable to validate all this information.\n\n1271\n01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:11.196\nWe want to make sure that we have it all,\nwant to make sure we have a record of it\n\n1272\n01:04:11.196 --> 01:04:14.761\nbecause this is gonna be how we keep\ntrack of what we actually have done.\n\n1273\n01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:16.954\nNow that we've done this,\nand we could go through and\n\n1274\n01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:19.410\nverify all sorts of other stuff,\nyou get the general idea.\n\n1275\n01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.360\nWe're going to assume since everything\nwas successful it's all there.\n\n1276\n01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:26.670\nWhat we want to do now is focus on how\nto migrate the config manager 07 client\n\n1277\n01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:28.980\ninto the 12 R2 architecture, right?\n\n1278\n01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:32.853\nSo how are we going to get those clients\nrunning in 07 over those agents that\n\n1279\n01:04:32.853 --> 01:04:34.255\nare running on endpoints?\n\n1280\n01:04:34.255 --> 01:04:36.756\nHow are we going to bring\nthem over into 2012?\n\n1281\n01:04:36.756 --> 01:04:38.252\nSo that's what we're gonna do next, so\n\n1282\n01:04:38.252 --> 01:04:40.840\nlet's just quickly take a look\nbefore we actually go in there.\n\n1283\n01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.230\nLet me jump to the SMS client box that\nwe're running just to show you this.\n\n1284\n01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:50.711\nCome over here,\ngot a Windows XP box sitting here.\n\n1285\n01:04:50.711 --> 01:04:52.610\nRight, there's an oldie but a goodie.\n\n1286\n01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:57.464\nWe'll go into our Control Panel here for\njust a minute and if we come in here and\n\n1287\n01:04:57.464 --> 01:05:02.020\nwe take a look we'll see the Config\nManager client right there if we bring\n\n1288\n01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:02.635\nthis up.\n\n1289\n01:05:07.706 --> 01:05:10.439\nAnd we wait.\n\n1290\n01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:11.843\nCome on, I double-clicked.\n\n1291\n01:05:15.771 --> 01:05:16.928\nLet's try it that way.\n\n1292\n01:05:16.928 --> 01:05:19.520\nWe're gonna get four instances\nof that thing all at once.\n\n1293\n01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.426\nThere we go, we've just gotta wait for\nXP to catch up with us and\n\n1294\n01:05:23.426 --> 01:05:25.370\ndecide it wants to open up.\n\n1295\n01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:30.709\nSo you can see this is the older SMS or\nSCCM 2007 client.\n\n1296\n01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:32.699\nThis is not the new 12 client.\n\n1297\n01:05:32.699 --> 01:05:35.780\nWe can tell that lots of ways,\njust by looking I can tell.\n\n1298\n01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:40.650\nBut if we wanted to be specific, the\nconfig manager version client, the AD site\n\n1299\n01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:45.820\nname, the site code TST, all of these\nindicate that this is the older client.\n\n1300\n01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.490\nRight, so we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna migrate that.\n\n1301\n01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:50.070\nWe're gonna actually move that over to 12.\n\n1302\n01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:54.120\nSo we're just gonna cancel out of this,\nright, just to get rid of that.\n\n1303\n01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.300\nWe'll just minimize that for the moment,\nand then let's go back over to our\n\n1304\n01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.230\nprimary server so\nyou could see where we're operating from.\n\n1305\n01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:05.272\nWe're gonna come in here, let me scroll\nback over this way and scroll down so\n\n1306\n01:06:05.272 --> 01:06:07.302\nthat I can get to our admin workspace.\n\n1307\n01:06:07.302 --> 01:06:09.497\nSo let's go to the administration\nworkspace here.\n\n1308\n01:06:09.497 --> 01:06:12.510\nWe're gonna go into\nSite Configuration right up here.\n\n1309\n01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:13.400\nJust open this up.\n\n1310\n01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:19.650\nLet's go into our sites cuz we\nhave to take a look at the site\n\n1311\n01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:21.280\nconfiguration here.\n\n1312\n01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.294\nWe've got our primary site on the 12\nside that we're gonna work with.\n\n1313\n01:06:25.294 --> 01:06:28.570\nSo we're gonna go in and\nwe're gonna go to settings here.\n\n1314\n01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:33.305\nSo let's go in and let's take a look.\n\n1315\n01:06:33.305 --> 01:06:37.303\nActually, let me just do it this way,\nhighlight this up here.\n\n1316\n01:06:37.303 --> 01:06:41.200\nAnd let's go in and let's go to Settings.\n\n1317\n01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.270\nAnd under Settings here,\nlet's just scroll over so\n\n1318\n01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:47.140\nyou can see that we've got\nall these different settings.\n\n1319\n01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:50.520\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna go\ninto Client Install Settings right here.\n\n1320\n01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.630\nAnd we're gonna pull this down, and\nwe're gonna see Client Push Install.\n\n1321\n01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:58.470\nIf you remember from the episode we did\nwhere we went through the configuration of\n\n1322\n01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:02.660\nthe client, how to push the client out,\nwe're gonna configure that solution, but\n\n1323\n01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.090\nwe have to modify some\nof the settings here.\n\n1324\n01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:07.470\nSo we're gonna essentially come in and\ndo this.\n\n1325\n01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:08.421\nWe're gonna come over here.\n\n1326\n01:07:08.421 --> 01:07:11.810\nI'm gonna just move down so\nwe can see the push settings.\n\n1327\n01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:14.910\nAnd so what we're gonna do here is\nwe're gonna go out to the Accounts tab.\n\n1328\n01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:19.500\nWe're going to make sure here\nthat we add in an account\n\n1329\n01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.060\nthat actually can be used to be able\nto operate in the other domain.\n\n1330\n01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:26.290\nBecause if you remember,\nthe client that we're gonna target is in\n\n1331\n01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:30.280\nthe 2007 site in a separate domain, and\nwe have to actually bring that over.\n\n1332\n01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.180\nAnd so as a result we have to have\nrights to be able to operate there.\n\n1333\n01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:37.380\nThe account that we use by default here is\nthe account that works for the 12 system.\n\n1334\n01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.730\nBut it may not have rights in the other\nplace, so we need to have that account.\n\n1335\n01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:42.830\nWe talked about having several\ndifferent accounts, and\n\n1336\n01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:45.038\nthis will be one of the ones\nwe may need to specify.\n\n1337\n01:07:45.038 --> 01:07:47.252\nSo we're gonna come over here,\nwe're gonna do New, right,\n\n1338\n01:07:47.252 --> 01:07:48.366\nwe're gonna do a new account.\n\n1339\n01:07:48.366 --> 01:07:53.360\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to program in this account.\n\n1340\n01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.450\nWe're going to go ahead and\n\n1341\n01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:58.820\nput in the account from the SMS domain\nthat we're gonna use, the Administrator\n\n1342\n01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:02.860\naccount, the one we used to drive\nthe bridge, the connection in the wizard.\n\n1343\n01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:07.280\nSo administration, or administrator,\nexcuse me, administrator.\n\n1344\n01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.430\nWe'll do that.\n\n1345\n01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:11.150\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ndo our password here.\n\n1346\n01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:14.260\nPassword, password.\n\n1347\n01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:16.562\nWe're gonna do our Verify,\njust like we always do.\n\n1348\n01:08:16.562 --> 01:08:20.095\nAnd we have to verify our Network Share,\nright?\n\n1349\n01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:23.370\nWhat are we going to be able to connect\nto to pull down the client package?\n\n1350\n01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:24.630\nSo we're gonna put that in.\n\n1351\n01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.690\nThat's gonna be our SMS client.\n\n1352\n01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.344\nSo we're gonna do smsclient, and\n\n1353\n01:08:30.344 --> 01:08:34.458\nthen we're gonna do our admin$\nif I spelled that correctly.\n\n1354\n01:08:34.458 --> 01:08:36.148\nOf course, I can never tell.\n\n1355\n01:08:36.148 --> 01:08:38.895\nC-L-I-E-N-T, there we go.\n\n1356\n01:08:38.895 --> 01:08:41.610\nWanna always make sure\nwe spell that correctly.\n\n1357\n01:08:41.610 --> 01:08:45.824\nSo admin$, this is the hidden share\non that, so we're gonna do that.\n\n1358\n01:08:45.824 --> 01:08:49.753\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nTest connection.\n\n1359\n01:08:49.753 --> 01:08:52.080\nNetwork path not found.\n\n1360\n01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.104\nLet's make sure.\n\n1361\n01:08:55.104 --> 01:08:58.666\nsmsclient, let's make sure\nI spelled that correctly,\n\n1362\n01:08:58.666 --> 01:09:01.270\ncuz it's always possible that I did not.\n\n1363\n01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.260\nWe've got that, we've got our account.\n\n1364\n01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:07.215\nWe did smsdomain and\nthat is spelled correctly.\n\n1365\n01:09:07.215 --> 01:09:08.621\nAdministrator.\n\n1366\n01:09:08.621 --> 01:09:10.120\nAnd we've got network share.\n\n1367\n01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.990\nWe're doing our smsclient and\nwe're doing admin$.\n\n1368\n01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:17.188\nLet's just make sure.\n\n1369\n01:09:29.744 --> 01:09:34.770\nSMSClient, and let's make sure\n\n1370\n01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:39.084\nwe're doing that and that.\n\n1371\n01:09:39.084 --> 01:09:42.610\nAnd let's go ahead and\nlet's test real quick.\n\n1372\n01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:45.998\nWe still do not find the network path.\n\n1373\n01:09:45.998 --> 01:09:48.606\nWhy are we not finding the network path?\n\n1374\n01:09:48.606 --> 01:09:52.474\nLet's take a quick look, just one second.\n\n1375\n01:09:52.474 --> 01:09:59.472\nSMSCLIENT, let's make sure administrator,\npassword, password, that's all good.\n\n1376\n01:09:59.472 --> 01:10:02.970\nLet's make sure that we don't have\nanything funny going on with our machine.\n\n1377\n01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:07.770\nIf I named it incorrectly by mistake,\nwhich you know can happen and every so\n\n1378\n01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:08.650\noften does.\n\n1379\n01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:11.030\nNope, SMSClient, I-E, not E-I.\n\n1380\n01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:14.808\nWe just wanna make sure cuz you never\nknow, on occasion that could happen.\n\n1381\n01:10:14.808 --> 01:10:19.342\nLet's do the following real quickly here.\n\n1382\n01:10:19.342 --> 01:10:22.383\nAnd 192.168.3.40.\n\n1383\n01:10:22.383 --> 01:10:26.119\nAnd a little bit quick troubleshooting\nhere in real time just to find out why\n\n1384\n01:10:26.119 --> 01:10:28.920\nwe're not resolving that network path.\n\n1385\n01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.061\nSo what did I say, 3.40, right?\n\n1386\n01:10:33.061 --> 01:10:34.796\n>> Yep, 3.40.\n\n1387\n01:10:34.796 --> 01:10:41.301\n>> All right, so let's do that and\nlet's do 192.168.3.40,\n\n1388\n01:10:41.301 --> 01:10:44.400\nand let's see if we can find that.\n\n1389\n01:10:48.946 --> 01:10:52.415\nAnd we're thinking, and we're thinking.\n\n1390\n01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:55.469\nAnd there's more than one way\nto get to where we need to be.\n\n1391\n01:10:55.469 --> 01:10:59.740\nAnd we're still thinking and\nwe're still thinking.\n\n1392\n01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.360\nGive that a minute,\nlet's see if it comes back.\n\n1393\n01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.490\nUsually it may take longer with the IP so\nit can very well take longer and\n\n1394\n01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:12.840\nstill fail, but let's just see\nif we're able to resolve here.\n\n1395\n01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.860\nNext step will be we'll have to actually\ndo a little ping from our side.\n\n1396\n01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:20.672\nOkay, so it's still not finding it,\nso it is possible that we may just\n\n1397\n01:11:20.672 --> 01:11:24.436\nhave a firewall issue or\nsomething along those lines.\n\n1398\n01:11:24.436 --> 01:11:30.470\nLet's go out and let's just do\nthe obvious first and foremost here.\n\n1399\n01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:32.660\nLet's just drop the firewall.\n\n1400\n01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:33.710\nSo it is already off.\n\n1401\n01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:37.211\nSo eliminate the obvious things\nthat could get in the way.\n\n1402\n01:11:37.211 --> 01:11:41.607\nLet's make sure that we have an IP address\nthat is on the right subnet, although we\n\n1403\n01:11:41.607 --> 01:11:46.086\nalready connected to that domain, so\nI'm pretty sure that we're gonna be there.\n\n1404\n01:11:46.086 --> 01:11:48.335\nBut let's just make sure.\n\n1405\n01:11:48.335 --> 01:11:50.650\nWe'll check that real quick as well.\n\n1406\n01:11:53.782 --> 01:11:57.095\nWait, it would help if i actually\nclicked in there to type as opposed to\n\n1407\n01:11:57.095 --> 01:11:58.565\njust typing and not clicking.\n\n1408\n01:11:58.565 --> 01:12:04.901\nAll right, ipconfig,\nwe're on that subnet, so 3.40 right,\n\n1409\n01:12:04.901 --> 01:12:10.420\nping 192.168.3.40 and let's see.\n\n1410\n01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:12.634\nThat does not look like it is coming back.\n\n1411\n01:12:12.634 --> 01:12:19.560\nThere we go, look at that, all right,\nso that may be the issue right there.\n\n1412\n01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.510\nWe may just have a bit of\na problem on this one.\n\n1413\n01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:24.410\nSo let's just quickly double check.\n\n1414\n01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:26.080\nWe may just want to restart this client.\n\n1415\n01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.520\nWe may have to do that.\n\n1416\n01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.890\nThat could happen.\n\n1417\n01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:32.730\nLet's just make sure that it's not\nthe firewall cuz that sometimes can get in\n\n1418\n01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:38.210\nthe way and do some crazy things and\nlead us to all sorts of complications.\n\n1419\n01:12:38.210 --> 01:12:47.830\nLet's do ping 192.168.3.10 and let's see.\n\n1420\n01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:51.447\nThat doesn't look like that's\ngonna be too happy, either.\n\n1421\n01:12:51.447 --> 01:12:54.573\nAll right so, we're not getting there so\n\n1422\n01:12:54.573 --> 01:12:57.888\nthat is a a network problem,\nit looks like.\n\n1423\n01:12:57.888 --> 01:13:00.710\nSo, let's see if we can\ndo that real quick.\n\n1424\n01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:01.860\nStill no getting there.\n\n1425\n01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:05.270\nAll right, so, let's do the following.\n\n1426\n01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:08.410\nLet's restart the machine real\nquick how to see if maybe there's\n\n1427\n01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:10.370\njust a problem what the network card.\n\n1428\n01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:11.510\nIt could happen.\n\n1429\n01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:14.150\nThere are virtual machines after all.\n\n1430\n01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:17.620\nAll good virtual machines sometimes\ndecide to have a mind of their own.\n\n1431\n01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:21.030\nEven though we try to prevent\nthat as much as possible.\n\n1432\n01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.970\nGood news is it's a Windows XP machine.\n\n1433\n01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:25.100\nIt's not gonna take very long to restart.\n\n1434\n01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.320\nSo we'll just have that\ncome right back up.\n\n1435\n01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.060\nBrought to you by Hyper-V for Microsoft.\n\n1436\n01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.400\nSo we'll let that restart here.\n\n1437\n01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.050\nWe'll give that just a second.\n\n1438\n01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:37.510\nWhile we're doing that assuming that we\nare able to get that connected of course\n\n1439\n01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:40.760\nwhat we're gonna try to do\nIs reach out there you go.\n\n1440\n01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.450\nAs I said doesn't take very long at all.\n\n1441\n01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:47.380\nWe're gonna reach out there and\nwe are going to get that to a log or\n\n1442\n01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:52.015\nexcuse me get that to allow us\nto connect with that account.\n\n1443\n01:13:52.015 --> 01:13:54.995\nAnd once we have done that,\nlet me just log back in.\n\n1444\n01:13:54.995 --> 01:13:59.745\nOnce we have done that,\nthen allow us to be able to\n\n1445\n01:13:59.745 --> 01:14:04.715\nessentially remove the current installed\nclient and replace it with a new client.\n\n1446\n01:14:04.715 --> 01:14:07.875\nAdding the new client along with\nthe new site code association,\n\n1447\n01:14:07.875 --> 01:14:09.345\nis what we're ultimately trying to do.\n\n1448\n01:14:09.345 --> 01:14:12.865\nAnd so we wanna just make sure that\nwe have the ability to do that,\n\n1449\n01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:17.290\nwe're gonna let this log in and\nmake sure that we can connect, and\n\n1450\n01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:21.010\nthen as soon as we're able to get to\nthe desktop we'll take a look here, and\n\n1451\n01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:22.670\nhopefully we will be back up and running.\n\n1452\n01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:24.950\nSo give that just a second.\n\n1453\n01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:28.190\nAs always,\nmachines have to think before they act,\n\n1454\n01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:31.520\nwhich is why humans will always be\nsuperior cuz we act before we think.\n\n1455\n01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.320\nSo it works out well.\n\n1456\n01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.040\nAll right, so\nlet us click over here real quick.\n\n1457\n01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:39.550\nLet's just up arrow there.\n\n1458\n01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:42.730\nLet's see if we've got anything\nmore exciting happening.\n\n1459\n01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:47.950\nAnd we are still able to unreach,\nIt's still able to unreach,\n\n1460\n01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:50.220\nlisten to me,\ncuz that's the proper way to say that.\n\n1461\n01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:53.000\nWe are still not able\nto reach that client,\n\n1462\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.058\nso you know what we're gonnado instead?\n\n1463\n01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:58.317\nWe are gonna take a slightly\ndifferent approach here.\n\n1464\n01:14:58.317 --> 01:15:02.113\nLet's see, let me just take a look,\n\n1465\n01:15:02.113 --> 01:15:06.768\nI don't remember what this one is,\nI think,\n\n1466\n01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:12.036\nI'm not sure,\nlets make sure that this is actually\n\n1467\n01:15:12.036 --> 01:15:21.690\nrunning the Do we even\nhave a client on this one?\n\n1468\n01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:22.690\nYeah, you build these things and\n\n1469\n01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:26.810\nthen over time, you don't remember what\nyou do with them and how they're setup.\n\n1470\n01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:29.390\nAll right, so\nthis one actually doesn't have anything.\n\n1471\n01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:30.980\nSo this would be easy to install into.\n\n1472\n01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:33.140\nBut that's not the same\nthing as pulling it across.\n\n1473\n01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:36.120\nI was hoping that we actually had\n\n1474\n01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:40.810\na client that was already installed on\nthat machine that we could work with.\n\n1475\n01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:42.930\nAll right, so let me just walk\nyou through the process verbally,\n\n1476\n01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:44.410\nkind of tell you what we're gonna do.\n\n1477\n01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:46.960\nWe're not gonna spend any more\ntime trying to troubleshoot this.\n\n1478\n01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.860\nWe're having a network\nconnectivity problem.\n\n1479\n01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:52.440\nThere's something going on behind\nthe scenes on the stack here.\n\n1480\n01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.130\nNot quite sure what,\nno big deal, we can adjust.\n\n1481\n01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:57.040\nLet me just now read through what\nwe're going to do, basically.\n\n1482\n01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.620\nI'll explain to you as we go.\n\n1483\n01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:59.460\nWe set this up.\n\n1484\n01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.950\nYou know we would verify this, you know,\n\n1485\n01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:04.240\nin theory as long as this worked\nwe would be able to connect in.\n\n1486\n01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.430\nLet's just give it one more shot let's\njust see real quick if maybe by some\n\n1487\n01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:11.250\nodd coincidence we're able to\nconnect out but I doubt we will be.\n\n1488\n01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:15.300\nSo when this errors out what we will then\nessentially do is we'll be able to go in\n\n1489\n01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:20.920\nand we'll specify that we're gonna go in\nand essentially connect to this client.\n\n1490\n01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:25.185\nSo we're gonna go in and we're gonna\ngo to the installation parameters for\n\n1491\n01:16:25.185 --> 01:16:29.317\nthis particular client configuration\npackage where I've set this up,\n\n1492\n01:16:29.317 --> 01:16:33.058\nset up our admin account, or\naccount that has rights to install.\n\n1493\n01:16:33.058 --> 01:16:36.604\nAnd then what we're gonna do is to\ncentrally deploy the package, and\n\n1494\n01:16:36.604 --> 01:16:38.522\nthat part you've seen me do before.\n\n1495\n01:16:38.522 --> 01:16:42.575\nWe would deploy the client package and\nthen once we have done that we would\n\n1496\n01:16:42.575 --> 01:16:47.165\ntarget that machine, the uninstallation,\nre-installation process would happen.\n\n1497\n01:16:47.165 --> 01:16:51.025\nTakes maybe about five to ten minutes\ndepending on network connectivity and\n\n1498\n01:16:51.025 --> 01:16:54.460\nthings of that nature,\nit could take longer.\n\n1499\n01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:58.340\nTo do the actual configuration of the\nclient once the client is reinstalled on\n\n1500\n01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.030\nthe 12 side.\n\n1501\n01:16:59.030 --> 01:17:03.550\nThe thing to be aware of here\nis that unlike the 07 client,\n\n1502\n01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:07.470\nin the 12 client we need updated\nversions of the .NET Framework.\n\n1503\n01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:11.850\nWe're going to need the,\nnot only .NET Framework 4, but\n\n1504\n01:17:11.850 --> 01:17:14.280\nwe're going to need a bunch other stuff.\n\n1505\n01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.380\nSo it could actually be, maybe as long as\n20 minutes depending on hardware, before\n\n1506\n01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:22.890\nall that unconfiguration, uninstall,\nreconfiguration, reinstall takes place.\n\n1507\n01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:26.680\nThe majority of that time is actually\nthe new client substantiating itself,\n\n1508\n01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:27.860\nnot the old client coming out.\n\n1509\n01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.290\nThe old client being removed is\nlike a three minute procedure.\n\n1510\n01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:31.480\nIt's very, very quick.\n\n1511\n01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.560\nSo you just want to make sure you're aware\nof that, you're kinda budgeting for that.\n\n1512\n01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.610\nBut no big deal, right.\n\n1513\n01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:38.890\nWe'll be able to do that with no trouble,\nhave all of that stuff done.\n\n1514\n01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:43.570\nOnce we do that a course we will then see\nthat the client has been reconfigured.\n\n1515\n01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:45.610\nAnd once the client has\nbeen reconfigured and\n\n1516\n01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:48.960\nit's attached,\nwe should be all set and ready to go.\n\n1517\n01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:54.050\nWhat we're gonna do is take a look\nat how to do an upgrade on a shared\n\n1518\n01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:58.520\ndistribution point into 12 R2, something\nelse we want to make sure we're aware of.\n\n1519\n01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.610\nAnd then when we're done with that,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n1520\n01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:04.160\nwe'll remove all the migration data\nfrom the config manager in 12 R2,\n\n1521\n01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.110\nand we'll take a look at\nhow to do that as well.\n\n1522\n01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:09.540\nSo let's go back in, we're going to go\nahead and go back to our Migration tab, so\n\n1523\n01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.030\nlet me just take us back there,\nand we're gonna go in here, so\n\n1524\n01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:15.110\nlet me just open this up again so\nwe can see this, and\n\n1525\n01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:17.930\nwe're gonna come down here to the bottom,\nlet me scroll down.\n\n1526\n01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:20.608\nAnd we're going to come over here\nto Distribution Point Migration.\n\n1527\n01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:25.350\nAnd we're gonna see down here that we\n\n1528\n01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:28.920\ncurrently have no distribution points that\nwe've migrated over, nothing we've done.\n\n1529\n01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:33.230\nIf we come over here to the Source\nHierarchy I will take a look here and\n\n1530\n01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:39.740\nunder the Source Hierarchy can see\nthat we will be able to go down here.\n\n1531\n01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:40.560\nJust come down here.\n\n1532\n01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.910\nWe showed you earlier to the shared\nDistribution Points tab.\n\n1533\n01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:47.639\nYou see we have two as I've showed you,\none I showed you will for migration,\n\n1534\n01:18:47.639 --> 01:18:48.790\none that is not.\n\n1535\n01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:49.978\nRight, so remember that.\n\n1536\n01:18:49.978 --> 01:18:54.650\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ncom to the member one, which we'll just\n\n1537\n01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:58.990\nscroll over so you can see that,\nis available for reassignment, right?\n\n1538\n01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:00.030\nWe talked about that.\n\n1539\n01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:02.840\nYou never want to assume,\nyou always want to check.\n\n1540\n01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.020\nMake sure you know.\n\n1541\n01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.670\nSo we're gonna come over here and\n\n1542\n01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:09.590\nwe're gonna right click and we're gonna\nreassign that distribution point.\n\n1543\n01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:12.371\nReassigning it allows us\nto essentially specify,\n\n1544\n01:19:12.371 --> 01:19:16.641\nhey we want to put this into our site code\nor new site code for the primary site for\n\n1545\n01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:18.855\n12 R2 and remove it from where it was.\n\n1546\n01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:21.322\nSo we are gonna come over here,\ngonna to click on that,\n\n1547\n01:19:21.322 --> 01:19:24.350\nit will take just a second we\nwe'll get a little wizard here.\n\n1548\n01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:28.730\nLet's center that so we can see what\nwe are doing, we'll scroll up here, so\n\n1549\n01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:31.500\nwe are gonna have to come in here,\ngrab our site code.\n\n1550\n01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.715\nThis is our new 12 R2 site code.\n\n1551\n01:19:33.715 --> 01:19:37.533\nGonna check that off, and\nthen once we have done that and\n\n1552\n01:19:37.533 --> 01:19:41.106\nwe have our side code selected,\nwe are gonna go in and\n\n1553\n01:19:41.106 --> 01:19:45.265\nwe are gonna use a site system account for\nthe installation.\n\n1554\n01:19:45.265 --> 01:19:48.717\nWe are gonna use a different account\nthan the one that has been used to setup\n\n1555\n01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:49.952\nthe initial site system.\n\n1556\n01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:53.237\nWe want to specify that account in\nother words So we're gonna go in and\n\n1557\n01:19:53.237 --> 01:19:54.892\nwe're going to set this account.\n\n1558\n01:19:54.892 --> 01:19:56.902\nWe'll do a new account\nlike we've been doing.\n\n1559\n01:19:56.902 --> 01:19:58.910\nLet's come over here, we'll do that.\n\n1560\n01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:59.992\nJust pull that up.\n\n1561\n01:19:59.992 --> 01:20:04.023\nWe're gonna go in and\ndo the SMS domain administrator account.\n\n1562\n01:20:04.023 --> 01:20:07.319\nSo SMS, whoops.\n\n1563\n01:20:07.319 --> 01:20:08.280\nThat's no good.\n\n1564\n01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.450\nCan we make sure that we are plugged in?\n\n1565\n01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:11.830\nThank you.\n\n1566\n01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:13.880\nWe're just gonna fix that real quick.\n\n1567\n01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:18.190\nWe probably unplugged something\nby accident without realizing it.\n\n1568\n01:20:18.190 --> 01:20:20.455\nIt does not look like it is charging, so\n\n1569\n01:20:20.455 --> 01:20:22.740\nlet's just make sure\nthat is coming back up.\n\n1570\n01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.500\nStill no juice.\n\n1571\n01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.450\nAre we actually getting?\n\n1572\n01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:29.036\nLet's make sure that we're actually\ngetting that we're plugged in somewhere on\n\n1573\n01:20:29.036 --> 01:20:30.017\nsomething that's turned on.\n\n1574\n01:20:30.017 --> 01:20:32.135\nAll right, so\nWes is gonna troubleshoot that for\n\n1575\n01:20:32.135 --> 01:20:34.340\nus real quick while\nwe're dealing with that.\n\n1576\n01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:37.690\nSo I was gonna go ahead and\nI was gonna put in the user account.\n\n1577\n01:20:37.690 --> 01:20:39.270\nThere we go, outstanding, thank you.\n\n1578\n01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:42.863\nI think we probably by accident had\nunplugged that without realizing it.\n\n1579\n01:20:42.863 --> 01:20:43.525\nAll right, very good.\n\n1580\n01:20:43.525 --> 01:20:46.439\nThank you, Microsoft Windows for\nnotifying us.\n\n1581\n01:20:46.439 --> 01:20:50.597\nIt would've been cool if Cortana had\ncome up and actually spoken and said,\n\n1582\n01:20:50.597 --> 01:20:52.058\nI'm about to go to sleep.\n\n1583\n01:20:52.058 --> 01:20:54.700\nI'm out of battery or something-\n>> If she would actually do her job.\n\n1584\n01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.000\n>> If she would do her job\ncorrectly essentially is right,\n\n1585\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:57.678\nis what we're saying.\n\n1586\n01:20:57.678 --> 01:20:59.700\nAll right, [LAUGH] so\nlet's put our new account in here.\n\n1587\n01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:03.395\nI was wondering why it was getting so\ndim too, cuz it was just so hard to see.\n\n1588\n01:21:03.395 --> 01:21:05.965\nSo all right, smsdomain.\n\n1589\n01:21:05.965 --> 01:21:07.965\nIf it's not one thing it's another,\nI'll tell you what.\n\n1590\n01:21:07.965 --> 01:21:11.545\nAll right, administrator,\nlet's put this in here.\n\n1591\n01:21:11.545 --> 01:21:16.595\nsmsdomain, now it's incredible,\nI can actually see what I'm typing now, so\n\n1592\n01:21:16.595 --> 01:21:19.445\nI can actually see that\nI'm spelling incorrectly.\n\n1593\n01:21:19.445 --> 01:21:22.983\nSo running on power as opposed to\nbattery is always a good thing.\n\n1594\n01:21:22.983 --> 01:21:26.840\nAll right, [LAUGH] so password,\nlet's do that, do that.\n\n1595\n01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.520\nLet's verify here.\n\n1596\n01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.400\nLet's go in, let's get our network share.\n\n1597\n01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.270\nLet's go in there, let's do this.\n\n1598\n01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:38.994\nLet's do member, and\n\n1599\n01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:43.110\nlet's do under member,\n\n1600\n01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:49.320\nsmspkgc$ for our packet share.\n\n1601\n01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.327\nLet's do our Test connection there.\n\n1602\n01:21:54.998 --> 01:21:57.737\nLet's just wait on that to come back.\n\n1603\n01:21:57.737 --> 01:22:03.218\nAnd then once we are done with that,\nwe'll wait for it to verify.\n\n1604\n01:22:08.022 --> 01:22:08.976\nPassword is not correct.\n\n1605\n01:22:08.976 --> 01:22:10.974\nOkay, we can fix that, that's easy.\n\n1606\n01:22:10.974 --> 01:22:13.214\nThat was just me probably\nnot typing it in correctly.\n\n1607\n01:22:13.214 --> 01:22:17.092\nLet me just make sure that I am typing\nin the right password password.\n\n1608\n01:22:17.092 --> 01:22:19.084\nSo let me just make sure.\n\n1609\n01:22:19.084 --> 01:22:21.756\nI might have hit that O\nby mistake cuz I'm so\n\n1610\n01:22:21.756 --> 01:22:25.850\nused to that normal Microsoft\npassword that uses O instead of 0.\n\n1611\n01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:29.680\nOkay, let's try that one more time,\nmake sure that's correct.\n\n1612\n01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:38.420\nAnd once we have this configured and once\nwe are in, we'll then be able to go ahead,\n\n1613\n01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:42.200\ncontinue on with the wizard and\nspecify the distribution point settings.\n\n1614\n01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.222\nSo we'll wait for this to connect up.\n\n1615\n01:22:44.222 --> 01:22:46.210\nSpecified network password is not correct.\n\n1616\n01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:48.649\nBut I specified the password.\n\n1617\n01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:51.039\nAll right so, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n1618\n01:22:51.039 --> 01:22:54.454\ntell you how we fix this error\nthat we just encountered.\n\n1619\n01:22:54.454 --> 01:22:58.854\nSo the good news is as we are working\nthrough this demonstration, you're getting\n\n1620\n01:22:58.854 --> 01:23:03.319\na shot at what real world trouble shooting\nlooks like with regards to installing and\n\n1621\n01:23:03.319 --> 01:23:07.108\nmigrating for SMS or from the Server\n2007 site into the 12 site.\n\n1622\n01:23:07.108 --> 01:23:09.732\nRemember, we're talking about configuring\ndistribution point sharing here.\n\n1623\n01:23:09.732 --> 01:23:13.555\nAnd what we've been doing is trying\nto get the wizard started to take\n\n1624\n01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:17.379\nthe distribution point that is\neligible for sharing or migration,\n\n1625\n01:23:17.379 --> 01:23:21.741\nour member distribution point that we\nidentified on the shared distribution\n\n1626\n01:23:21.741 --> 01:23:25.458\ntab underneath the site hierarchy,\nright at the migration job.\n\n1627\n01:23:25.458 --> 01:23:27.253\nAnd we've right-clicked,\nwe're running the wizard.\n\n1628\n01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:30.217\nWe specified hey, we want to\nassociate that with the 12R2 site,\n\n1629\n01:23:30.217 --> 01:23:32.973\nwe went in to provide our network\ncredentials, and then boom,\n\n1630\n01:23:32.973 --> 01:23:36.120\nwe have another one of those\nwonderful Microsoft error screens.\n\n1631\n01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.620\nHey, your password's not right.\n\n1632\n01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:38.630\nWell, we know it's right.\n\n1633\n01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:39.170\nNo, it's not.\n\n1634\n01:23:39.170 --> 01:23:39.700\nYes, it is.\n\n1635\n01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.590\nWell, we're not gonna win that argument,\nright?\n\n1636\n01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:45.830\nSo what we did is we simply restarted\nboth site servers behind the scenes,\n\n1637\n01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:47.020\ngot them up and running.\n\n1638\n01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.345\nThis can happen in the real\nworld from time to time.\n\n1639\n01:23:49.345 --> 01:23:54.155\nCommunication between the two domains\ncan sometimes stop or can be corrupted.\n\n1640\n01:23:54.155 --> 01:23:57.595\nAnd we may get a cached credential\nthat's sitting somewhere, and\n\n1641\n01:23:57.595 --> 01:23:59.525\nthat credential may not be accurate.\n\n1642\n01:23:59.525 --> 01:24:04.012\nSo restarting clears all that out, as it\nalways does, almost without exception.\n\n1643\n01:24:04.012 --> 01:24:06.442\nWe've restarted, we're gonna go\nback into the environment here.\n\n1644\n01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:09.712\nNow you're gonna see we're able to\nsuccessfully verify that credential\n\n1645\n01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:13.352\nusing the identical username and\npassword that we were using before.\n\n1646\n01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:14.607\nWes can verify this for me.\n\n1647\n01:24:14.607 --> 01:24:17.082\nDid nothing different, but\nit actually is working now.\n\n1648\n01:24:17.082 --> 01:24:21.410\nSo if you take a look here, you will find\nthat we were able to deal with the error.\n\n1649\n01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:24.146\nWe are successful now, so\nthat's what we want to see.\n\n1650\n01:24:24.146 --> 01:24:25.585\nWe want to see that box.\n\n1651\n01:24:25.585 --> 01:24:27.780\nAnd what we'll now be able to do,\nclick through there.\n\n1652\n01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:29.690\nWe've got our credential aligned.\n\n1653\n01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:30.317\nWe're gonna click OK.\n\n1654\n01:24:30.317 --> 01:24:31.861\nWe're gonna set that up.\n\n1655\n01:24:31.861 --> 01:24:35.413\nWe're now gonna be able to scroll\ndown here and just continue on,\n\n1656\n01:24:35.413 --> 01:24:38.200\nmoving though the rest\nof the configuration.\n\n1657\n01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.650\nSo we're gonna click Next here,\nand then we're gonna get our,\n\n1658\n01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:45.490\nI'll just scroll up so you can see this,\nour Specify distribution point settings.\n\n1659\n01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:50.000\nNow the rest of this wizard should look\nrelatively familiar to you from our\n\n1660\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.020\ndiscussions in the episodes around\ndistribution point configuration and\n\n1661\n01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:53.810\nmanagement.\n\n1662\n01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:56.020\nThis is gonna look very similar, indeed,\n\n1663\n01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:58.950\nalmost identical,\nto what we're already used to seeing.\n\n1664\n01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:01.560\nSo we do wanna understand that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n1665\n01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.150\nWe're gonna have the general properties\nhere, right, for distribution points.\n\n1666\n01:25:05.150 --> 01:25:08.137\nRight, we can go ahead and\nset up HTTP, HTTPS,\n\n1667\n01:25:08.137 --> 01:25:12.784\ncreate self-signed certificates,\nall the standard stuff we would do.\n\n1668\n01:25:12.784 --> 01:25:18.990\nWe'll just go ahead and\naccept the general thought process here.\n\n1669\n01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:22.542\nWe are going to install configure\nIAS if required though, so\n\n1670\n01:25:22.542 --> 01:25:26.050\nwe're gonna make sure we do this cuz\nwe may need IAS to be up and running.\n\n1671\n01:25:26.050 --> 01:25:27.940\nAnd if it's not, we have to have it there,\n\n1672\n01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.600\nso we are gonna make\nsure that we select that.\n\n1673\n01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.240\nBut everything else will\nessentially remain the same.\n\n1674\n01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:38.290\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna choose to click Next here.\n\n1675\n01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:40.900\nGive that a second to just think,\ndo its job.\n\n1676\n01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.310\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\n\n1677\n01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:45.950\nwe're gonna see that we could accept\nthe default configuration options here.\n\n1678\n01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:50.438\nRight, for drive settings we're not\nreally gonna change anything here, but\n\n1679\n01:25:50.438 --> 01:25:54.110\nwe just want to make sure that we\ndo understand that if we need to,\n\n1680\n01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:56.100\nwe could specify drive space.\n\n1681\n01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.350\nWe could set aside different\namounts of space and\n\n1682\n01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:01.230\ndeal with whatever we would need to.\n\n1683\n01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:02.470\nWe'll click Next.\n\n1684\n01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:07.560\nWe have Source distribution points, here,\non the Pull Distribution Point setting.\n\n1685\n01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.630\nWhat we're going to do here is\nwe'll see that we can go ahead and\n\n1686\n01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:15.780\nwe can set this up as a distribution\npoint to pull content\n\n1687\n01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:18.160\nfrom other distribution points,\nif we'd like to.\n\n1688\n01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.240\nSo we can decide on that hierarchy,\nif we would like to.\n\n1689\n01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:25.260\nWe're not going to configure this as\na pull distribution point during our demo,\n\n1690\n01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.530\nbut in the real world you may choose to.\n\n1691\n01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:28.030\nIt'll be up to you, right?\n\n1692\n01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:32.090\nSo we'll specify, or rather,\nleave that unchecked, not specify that.\n\n1693\n01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:33.110\nWe'll click Next.\n\n1694\n01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:37.820\nWe can enable PXE support for\nclients if we need to.\n\n1695\n01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:42.260\nWe're not gonna set that up, but again we\nwould if we wanted to have PXE client boot\n\n1696\n01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:45.830\nsupport be available here for\nassociation we could set that up.\n\n1697\n01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:49.600\nIf we're gonna be using Windows deployment\nservices and deploying out operating\n\n1698\n01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.720\nsystem deployment images, OSD support,\nwe would need the PXE boot support.\n\n1699\n01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.390\nWe deal with that in one of our\nother episodes with regards to how\n\n1700\n01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:57.680\nto set all that up.\n\n1701\n01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:03.335\nWe may decide, as you can see here, to\nspecify how we'll do content validation.\n\n1702\n01:27:03.335 --> 01:27:08.065\nWe may decide to go in and specify\na certain schedule for content validation.\n\n1703\n01:27:08.065 --> 01:27:09.535\nIt's up to us.\n\n1704\n01:27:09.535 --> 01:27:12.945\nFirst Saturday, or\nevery Saturday of the month,\n\n1705\n01:27:12.945 --> 01:27:16.185\nrather, throughout the effective\ntime is the default.\n\n1706\n01:27:16.185 --> 01:27:16.845\nWe'll go with that.\n\n1707\n01:27:16.845 --> 01:27:21.785\nIf we wanna change that, we can easily\ngo in and simply set up our calendar and\n\n1708\n01:27:21.785 --> 01:27:25.310\nour configuration for how often and\nwhen, and no issues there.\n\n1709\n01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:27.890\nBut we'll just accept the default, right.\n\n1710\n01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:29.080\nSo we'll just leave that alone.\n\n1711\n01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:32.270\nClick Next.\n\n1712\n01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:34.090\nWe have our Boundary groups area.\n\n1713\n01:27:34.090 --> 01:27:36.510\nNow we are gonna specify\na boundary group here.\n\n1714\n01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:40.396\nSo we're gonna go in and we're gonna\nspecify Add, and we'll notice we have two\n\n1715\n01:27:40.396 --> 01:27:43.482\nboundary groups that are already set up or\nare available to us.\n\n1716\n01:27:43.482 --> 01:27:48.797\nWe're gonna do the local clients in\nthe MCM in the new 2012 R2 site,\n\n1717\n01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:50.728\nso we're gonna use that.\n\n1718\n01:27:50.728 --> 01:27:54.482\nSo that way this distribution point Is\ngonna be associating with those clients,\n\n1719\n01:27:54.482 --> 01:27:56.533\nso it's gonna be able\nto pull content down.\n\n1720\n01:27:56.533 --> 01:27:58.340\nSo we'll click OK there.\n\n1721\n01:27:58.340 --> 01:27:59.740\nSpecify that.\n\n1722\n01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:02.420\nWe'll then go ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n1723\n01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.530\nWe then have content conversion.\n\n1724\n01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:08.690\nSo on the content conversion area here,\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n1725\n01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:12.350\nwe're gonna take a look at the fact that,\n\n1726\n01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:15.600\nalthough we don't have any packages,\nwe just want to note this.\n\n1727\n01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:20.420\nWhen we reassign the distribution point,\nany migrated packages that are listed here\n\n1728\n01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:22.510\nthat are hosted on the distribution\npoint will be copied and\n\n1729\n01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:27.470\nconverted into the system 12 R2\nconfig manager content library.\n\n1730\n01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:28.200\nWe don't have any.\n\n1731\n01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:31.160\nBut if we did,\nwe would have to know that will happen and\n\n1732\n01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.580\nwe would have to be aware of that,\nand make sure that we adjust for that.\n\n1733\n01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:37.400\nSo we're not gonna worry about that\nright now, but ultimately in the real\n\n1734\n01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.790\nworld as you do this, you may see content\npackages that are gonna get converted.\n\n1735\n01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:42.770\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1736\n01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:44.240\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n1737\n01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.790\nWe are gonna get our,\nbasically, summary page.\n\n1738\n01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:50.770\nWe will click next on that.\n\n1739\n01:28:50.770 --> 01:28:54.060\nYou'll see it going through.\n\n1740\n01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.630\nWizard completes successfully.\n\n1741\n01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:59.995\nA close there, got a lot of\nthat nice flickering going on.\n\n1742\n01:28:59.995 --> 01:29:01.440\n[LAUGH] Not too excited about that.\n\n1743\n01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.810\nHopefully, that means we\nare not gonna lose that.\n\n1744\n01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:07.900\nNotice now, eligible free assignment, no,\nbecause it's already been reassigned so\n\n1745\n01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.320\nit now cannot be reassigned.\n\n1746\n01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:12.450\nIt's already been reassigned and\nso we see it that way.\n\n1747\n01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:18.120\nBut now we actually are able to go in and\nwe can go and\n\n1748\n01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:23.940\nview the status and so\nwhat we'll do, let's go over here,\n\n1749\n01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:30.400\nlet's go into here let\nme do the following.\n\n1750\n01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.700\nWhere is our refresh?\n\n1751\n01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.200\nUp here.\n\n1752\n01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:38.780\nLets just come up here real quick and\nchange our view.\n\n1753\n01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:40.476\nAnd just get that to\n\n1754\n01:29:50.331 --> 01:29:52.747\nAnd we could take a look\nat any recent alerts or\n\n1755\n01:29:52.747 --> 01:29:56.250\nactivities that may have happened,\nanything like that.\n\n1756\n01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:58.820\nWe can see our migration status,\nas we know.\n\n1757\n01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:02.600\nWe come back in here and\nthen we take a look.\n\n1758\n01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.100\nYou'll see now we have our distribution\npoint migration identifier.\n\n1759\n01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:09.490\nRight we usually give it a minute to\nupdate and make sure the database\n\n1760\n01:30:09.490 --> 01:30:13.120\ngets all that information in there but\nwe can see it is then reassigned.\n\n1761\n01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.090\nIt's updating the binaries right now so\nit's still working but essentially,\n\n1762\n01:30:16.090 --> 01:30:17.190\nit's been re-assigned.\n\n1763\n01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:18.910\nWe could see the new site code is there.\n\n1764\n01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:20.170\nSo we see it's in process.\n\n1765\n01:30:20.170 --> 01:30:23.520\nBut over time, if we wait another few\nminutes, it will actually update and\n\n1766\n01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.000\ntell us that it is gonna be good and\neverything should be ready to go there.\n\n1767\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.720\nSo we've done the distribution\nDistribution point, re-assignment and or\n\n1768\n01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.510\nsharing.\n\n1769\n01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.220\nWe've gone through,\n\n1770\n01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:36.450\nwe've talked about how to create\nthe bridge to pull information over.\n\n1771\n01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:37.920\nWe've talked about how to actually and\n\n1772\n01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.454\nindeed did immigration on\nthe collection objects.\n\n1773\n01:30:41.454 --> 01:30:46.525\nDid a the migration on the object objects,\nthe boundaries, the asset catalog,\n\n1774\n01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:51.015\nthe packages, all sort of stuff\nthat we went through and pulled in.\n\n1775\n01:30:51.015 --> 01:30:54.095\nWhat were gonna do now is take a look\nhow we essentially clean up after\n\n1776\n01:30:54.095 --> 01:30:55.175\nthe migration.\n\n1777\n01:30:55.175 --> 01:30:58.025\nGet rid of all that migration data and\ntake down the site\n\n1778\n01:30:58.025 --> 01:31:02.445\nhierarchy connector that's allowing\nus to query the old 2007 site and\n\n1779\n01:31:02.445 --> 01:31:05.470\nbring all that information over\nbecause at a certain point in time\n\n1780\n01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:09.020\nonce we are done with all that we want\nto actually get rid of that connection.\n\n1781\n01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:12.250\nWe don't want it active over a long period\nof time because at some point we are going\n\n1782\n01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:13.660\nto SunDown that environment.\n\n1783\n01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.380\nWe're going to essentially shut it off.\n\n1784\n01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.730\nSo we want to make sure we\nbreak the connection and\n\n1785\n01:31:17.730 --> 01:31:20.640\nclean up all the resonant data\nthat's left over before we do that.\n\n1786\n01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.640\nSo we are going to go back in and\ntake a look at how to do that right now.\n\n1787\n01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.110\nSo what we'll do is go back\ninto our area here, we\n\n1788\n01:31:26.110 --> 01:31:29.750\nare going to go into our source hierarchy,\nagain, staying in the migration area.\n\n1789\n01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:32.470\nEverything is in this tight little\ncompact space, it's real nice for\n\n1790\n01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:36.600\njust navigating between two or three items\nbut we could see everything right in here.\n\n1791\n01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:40.410\nWe'll go into source hierarchy, we could\nsee we have our hierarchy selected here.\n\n1792\n01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:43.290\nYou'll see that we.\n\n1793\n01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:46.330\nAnd if you had to guess,\nit would probably be a stretch for\n\n1794\n01:31:46.330 --> 01:31:50.190\nmost of us but I'm guessing I can't\nzoom in but you'll take my word for it.\n\n1795\n01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:52.050\nAnd you may be able to figure out that,\n\n1796\n01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:54.620\nI don't know, we may be coming\nover here and doing something with\n\n1797\n01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:58.270\nthis big old red button over here that\nsays something like stop gathering data.\n\n1798\n01:31:58.270 --> 01:32:01.150\nSo we're gonna come in here and we're\ngonna see that we have the ability to\n\n1799\n01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:03.730\nessentially stop gathering and\nbreak the connection.\n\n1800\n01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:05.250\nSo, we're gonna come up here.\n\n1801\n01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:07.320\nWe're going to click stop gathering data.\n\n1802\n01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.990\nLet's do that.\n\n1803\n01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.820\nWe get this warning right here.\n\n1804\n01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:15.120\nIt says hey do you want to stop gathering\ndata from the selected source site?\n\n1805\n01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.800\nWhen you stop gathering data,\n\n1806\n01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.120\nnewer changed objects\nare not gonna be available.\n\n1807\n01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.550\nSo in other words,\nhey we're not talking anymore.\n\n1808\n01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:23.160\nYou may or\nmay not know what's going on over there.\n\n1809\n01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.620\nAre you really sure you want to do that?\n\n1810\n01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:27.390\nAbsolutely, so we're gonna click Yes.\n\n1811\n01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:28.830\nGive that just a second.\n\n1812\n01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:29.440\nWe're going to go ahead.\n\n1813\n01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.810\nAnd we're going to be able to do that.\n\n1814\n01:32:30.810 --> 01:32:32.280\nNow, stopping it, no big deal.\n\n1815\n01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.240\nRight, all that is,\nis literally just breaking the connection.\n\n1816\n01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:38.270\nSo now,\nwhat we have to do is part two, right?\n\n1817\n01:32:39.630 --> 01:32:43.180\nAnd notice by the way the status now\nchanges from has not gathered data,\n\n1818\n01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:44.100\nwhen we stopped it.\n\n1819\n01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.840\nIt said gathering data before.\n\n1820\n01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.470\nIt's changed now to has not gathered data.\n\n1821\n01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:49.870\nSo, it tells us that that has now stopped.\n\n1822\n01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:53.570\nNow the second part, again if we have to\nguess and I don't know we weren't sure,\n\n1823\n01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:57.510\ngot that little broom clean\nup like icon there and\n\n1824\n01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:59.890\nit says hey let's clean\nup the migration data.\n\n1825\n01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:02.150\nSo now we're going to come over here and\nclean up the migration data.\n\n1826\n01:33:02.150 --> 01:33:04.180\nRight so, we're going to click this.\n\n1827\n01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:05.570\nWe're going to give this a second here.\n\n1828\n01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:07.370\nLet's just come down here so\nwe can see this.\n\n1829\n01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:10.180\nDelete migration history for\nsource hierarchy.\n\n1830\n01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.080\nSo select a source hierarchy to delete.\n\n1831\n01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:12.660\nWe've got that.\n\n1832\n01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:15.210\nYou'll notice there really\nis only one option here.\n\n1833\n01:33:15.210 --> 01:33:18.410\nBefore you can delete the migration data,\nyou have to stop gathering data.\n\n1834\n01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:21.180\nSo it's saying, hey,\nif you haven't done that first,\n\n1835\n01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:23.410\nmake sure you do that because you\ncan't delete it until you stop it.\n\n1836\n01:33:23.410 --> 01:33:23.920\nWell, we know that.\n\n1837\n01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.440\nWe are smart.\n\n1838\n01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.650\nWe've done that already.\n\n1839\n01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:28.800\nSo we're going to go ahead\nwe're going to click okay.\n\n1840\n01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.430\nNow it says the following hiarchary\nis eligible for history deletion.\n\n1841\n01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:34.200\nThat's the one we've already selected.\n\n1842\n01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.170\nAre we sure?\n\n1843\n01:33:35.170 --> 01:33:36.650\nYes.\nSo let's click that.\n\n1844\n01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:38.040\nLet's give that a second.\n\n1845\n01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.500\nNotice that's gone, right?\n\n1846\n01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.100\nNotice no migrations jobs.\n\n1847\n01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:46.070\nNotice nothing referencing\ndistribution points.\n\n1848\n01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:47.520\nSo all that has been removed.\n\n1849\n01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.450\nAll of that essentially is now gone.\n\n1850\n01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:51.790\nWe've cleaned up all of that data.\n\n1851\n01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:54.160\nWe've successfully\nremoved all the objects.\n\n1852\n01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.330\nNow let's be clear though\nbefore we disappear and or\n\n1853\n01:33:57.330 --> 01:33:58.950\nthink my god we deleted everything.\n\n1854\n01:33:58.950 --> 01:34:01.350\nAnd does that mean that we deleted all\nthe stuff that we brought over, right,\n\n1855\n01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:03.610\nwhich obviously would be a bad outcome.\n\n1856\n01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:07.120\nNow given the way the demo's been going so\nfar I'm not gonna put anything past\n\n1857\n01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.950\nthe virtual machine that\nhas a mind of it's own.\n\n1858\n01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:09.860\nSo if we go, we look, and\n\n1859\n01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:14.380\nthey're gone, I'm throwing down\nthe mouse and I'm leaving.\n\n1860\n01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:17.540\nBut what we should see, and all kidding\naside, we will see, when we go and\n\n1861\n01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:21.900\nwe take a look is that our\ncollections are still there, so for\n\n1862\n01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:25.110\ninstance, main building is\nstill there as you saw.\n\n1863\n01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:29.960\nIf we go in, and\nwe go into our compliance settings,\n\n1864\n01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.940\nwe go to our configuration items.\n\n1865\n01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:35.120\nWe will see that our configuration\nitems are still there if\n\n1866\n01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.690\nwe go to our base lines,\nwe'll see our base lines are still there,\n\n1867\n01:34:38.690 --> 01:34:40.850\nwrites all of that information is there.\n\n1868\n01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:42.190\nNow something else that's interesting.\n\n1869\n01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:44.510\nLet's just go take a look at this as well.\n\n1870\n01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:46.860\nLet's go back here to monitoring.\n\n1871\n01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:48.750\nLet's go back into reporting.\n\n1872\n01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:51.730\nRemember we took a look at\nthe migration reports, right?\n\n1873\n01:34:51.730 --> 01:34:54.500\nWe ran those to show you that we have\n\n1874\n01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.910\nfive different ways at\nlooking at migration data.\n\n1875\n01:34:56.910 --> 01:35:00.670\nWe have the migration job report, we could\nsee a listing of everything we'd done.\n\n1876\n01:35:00.670 --> 01:35:02.920\nSo let's go back in here real quick.\n\n1877\n01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.020\nScroll down here.\n\n1878\n01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.550\nLet's go back over to, there we are.\n\n1879\n01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:10.910\nA little alphabetically\nchallenged on this fine day.\n\n1880\n01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:13.880\nAnd so let's see, migration jobs right?\n\n1881\n01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:17.790\nSo let's run migration jobs again.\n\n1882\n01:35:19.670 --> 01:35:25.220\nAnd let's take a look at what we see in\nthe report now that we've cleaned up.\n\n1883\n01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:28.100\nBecause remember, we've cleaned\nup the data from the migration.\n\n1884\n01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:31.810\nSo, the trick here is to understand\nwhether that also removes all references\n\n1885\n01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:33.530\nto it from the reporting side,\n\n1886\n01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:36.840\nwhich we would want to make sure we\nare aware of and that we understand.\n\n1887\n01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:39.001\nCuz that may or\nmay not [LAUGH] be good for us.\n\n1888\n01:35:39.001 --> 01:35:42.417\nWe may want to know that, and we may want\nto make sure that we are aware of that.\n\n1889\n01:35:42.417 --> 01:35:43.425\nSo do keep this in mind.\n\n1890\n01:35:43.425 --> 01:35:44.266\nWe'll take a look.\n\n1891\n01:35:44.266 --> 01:35:46.961\nAgain, we gotta wait for\nthe report to kind of generate, go out,\n\n1892\n01:35:46.961 --> 01:35:49.809\ntalk to the database, say, hey,\nI'm here, here's the options.\n\n1893\n01:35:49.809 --> 01:35:52.991\nSo we'll give that just a minute,\nbut we do just wanna\n\n1894\n01:35:52.991 --> 01:35:57.119\nmake sure we are taking a look and\ndoing all of our Due diligence here.\n\n1895\n01:35:57.119 --> 01:36:00.381\nAnd then we want to wrap up talking\nabout the prereqs that we need to do\n\n1896\n01:36:00.381 --> 01:36:01.270\nthe upgrade.\n\n1897\n01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:05.190\nWhat software do we need installed,\nin what locations, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1898\n01:36:05.190 --> 01:36:08.105\nSo I want to run through that with\nyou while we're in here as well,\n\n1899\n01:36:08.105 --> 01:36:10.287\njust by way of wrapping\nup this discussion here.\n\n1900\n01:36:10.287 --> 01:36:15.349\nSo wait for this to generate,\nit's almost done loading.\n\n1901\n01:36:15.349 --> 01:36:16.538\nWe put a man on the moon but\n\n1902\n01:36:16.538 --> 01:36:20.050\nwe can't figure out how to get our\nreport to load quicker than this.\n\n1903\n01:36:20.050 --> 01:36:20.770\nAll right, so.\n\n1904\n01:36:20.770 --> 01:36:22.150\nHere we are.\nBack to the same place.\n\n1905\n01:36:22.150 --> 01:36:23.240\nWe got all our values.\n\n1906\n01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:29.195\nLet's do a view report, and\nlet's see that we remove all the data,\n\n1907\n01:36:29.195 --> 01:36:34.135\nincluding the migration job data once we\nactually have finished the migrations.\n\n1908\n01:36:34.135 --> 01:36:37.885\nSo, the trick to understand here is\nthat if you're gonna do all this and\n\n1909\n01:36:37.885 --> 01:36:42.027\nyou wanna capture the report elements and\nunderstand what was migrated.\n\n1910\n01:36:42.027 --> 01:36:45.897\nYou got to document all that and\nsave it off before you do the removal\n\n1911\n01:36:45.897 --> 01:36:49.582\nbecause once you do the, hey,\nstop gathering and remove migration data.\n\n1912\n01:36:49.582 --> 01:36:53.337\nAnd, it was pretty clear\nto us in the dialog box,\n\n1913\n01:36:53.337 --> 01:36:55.217\nhey, we're removing all the history.\n\n1914\n01:36:55.217 --> 01:36:58.877\nAll the history means, all the history\nincluding any of the reporting data\n\n1915\n01:36:58.877 --> 01:37:00.347\nthat was sitting in the Reports Database.\n\n1916\n01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:02.940\nSo you want to make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n1917\n01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:06.080\nBecause otherwise you may wind up\nfinding yourself in a position\n\n1918\n01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.400\nunfortunately right, where you go\nthinking, yeah it's still there,\n\n1919\n01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.260\nI can document I have a list later.\n\n1920\n01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:12.620\nAnd sure enough it's not there.\n\n1921\n01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.580\nRight all that data's gone.\n\n1922\n01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:16.590\nSo we don't want to get caught short\nabout that, that could be an issue.\n\n1923\n01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:18.900\nAll right I mentioned we were gonna\ntalk about prerequisites to upgrade,\n\n1924\n01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.660\nmeaning what software\nneeds to be available.\n\n1925\n01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:25.660\nSo, when we think about this,\nwhen we're gonna upgrade into 2012 SP1.\n\n1926\n01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:29.790\nBecause you remember, we may be\nupgrading into 2012 SP1 and/or 2012 R2.\n\n1927\n01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:32.180\nSo it's important to know.\n\n1928\n01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.060\nNow all the stuff that's required for\n\n1929\n01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:37.750\n2012 SP1 will be there for\nR2 plus some additional stuff.\n\n1930\n01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:40.020\nSo let's just run down\na list here real quick.\n\n1931\n01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:43.170\nWe need to make sure we\nupgrade on the 2007 side.\n\n1932\n01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:46.160\nNo, I just want to stay in the demo\nenvironment if we could please.\n\n1933\n01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.360\nI wanna make sure we talk this I wanna\nshow you a couple of quick things.\n\n1934\n01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:54.148\nSo, we wanna make sure we know that we\nneed to upgrade from the Windows AIK which\n\n1935\n01:37:54.148 --> 01:37:56.181\nwould be in the SMS environment,\n\n1936\n01:37:56.181 --> 01:38:01.700\nthe old 2007 environment into Windows 80k\nversion 8 and then ultimately 8.1 and\n\n1937\n01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:06.590\nbeyond that, maybe into 10 eventually\nover time but we need to upgrade that.\n\n1938\n01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:09.040\nSo we got to think about the fact, right?\n\n1939\n01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:15.440\nThat on the SMS server which is\ngoing to be the older 2007 server.\n\n1940\n01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:18.870\nWe may have been running,\ndepending on what we were doing.\n\n1941\n01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:25.430\nWe may have been running an older version\nof the automated installation kit.\n\n1942\n01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:28.320\nWe have to upgrade that to make\nsure that we have all of that.\n\n1943\n01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.630\nWe need to fix any and\n\n1944\n01:38:29.630 --> 01:38:33.800\nall configuration manager issues, have all\ncritical updates, standard stuff, right?\n\n1945\n01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:37.870\nBack up the site database,\nmake sure we run the prereq checker so\n\n1946\n01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:40.910\nthat we make sure that we have\nall of that stuff available.\n\n1947\n01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:46.033\nWe have to make sure that we are going\nto have 2012 with SP1 installed and\n\n1948\n01:38:46.033 --> 01:38:46.925\nready to go.\n\n1949\n01:38:46.925 --> 01:38:50.112\nNow it's not going to be installed on this\nbox, we're going to install wherever we're\n\n1950\n01:38:50.112 --> 01:38:52.368\ngoing to build it, but\nwe need to make sure we're doing that.\n\n1951\n01:38:52.368 --> 01:38:57.790\nWhen we are doing from 12 SP1 or\n12 RTM, 12, 12 SP1.\n\n1952\n01:38:57.790 --> 01:39:03.409\nNow 12 R2, we have to upgrade that\nWindows 80k 8 to 80k.1 or eventually 10.\n\n1953\n01:39:03.409 --> 01:39:07.620\nAgain aside from that we may need make\nsure we have the right patch levels.\n\n1954\n01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.470\nThe right kind of language\nsupport needs to be included.\n\n1955\n01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:13.110\nWe got to think about all that\nbecause that stuff that may or\n\n1956\n01:39:13.110 --> 01:39:15.900\nmay not, in our mind,\nmay not be an issue for us.\n\n1957\n01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:20.190\nNow, he may or may not be running you're\nolder versions of certain things.\n\n1958\n01:39:20.190 --> 01:39:24.090\nBy the way, if you've never seen 2007\nthis is actually what it looks like.\n\n1959\n01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:27.830\nSo this is what the 2007\nSCCM console looks like.\n\n1960\n01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:29.670\nA little bit different\nthan the 12R2 version.\n\n1961\n01:39:29.670 --> 01:39:33.000\nNot web enabled, but\nthe general ideas are still there.\n\n1962\n01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.670\nSo you'll see we have our\nsoftware updates for instance.\n\n1963\n01:39:35.670 --> 01:39:37.730\nWe have our software distribution.\n\n1964\n01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:41.450\nWe have our operating system deployment.\n\n1965\n01:39:41.450 --> 01:39:42.520\nAny of that kind of stuff.\n\n1966\n01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.860\nSo we want to make sure that\nwe know what's in here.\n\n1967\n01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:48.830\nWe want to go in and we want to document\nall the stuff that we have sitting here\n\n1968\n01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:51.040\nprior to starting this migration as well.\n\n1969\n01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.200\nSo we know for a fact that we've\ngotten the right information,\n\n1970\n01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.320\nwe've upgraded it and\ndone the right things.\n\n1971\n01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:00.440\nEspecially with things like our boot\nimages, our drivers, our task sequences.\n\n1972\n01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.760\nRemember certain things\ndon't migrate like queries.\n\n1973\n01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.080\nIf we have to pull those queries out,\nright, we're gonna have to come in and\n\n1974\n01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.200\nthink through that and\nwe're gonna have to pull this data and\n\n1975\n01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:11.700\nhave a way to actually capture all this,\nright.\n\n1976\n01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:15.880\nSo this is important, so, for instance\nin our query area here with all of our\n\n1977\n01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:19.300\nqueries, we're gonna have to figure\nout how to grab those queries and\n\n1978\n01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:23.830\nwe may want to actually export those\nqueries, right, and makes sure that we\n\n1979\n01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:28.200\nare able to take them because remember,\nwe have to reproduce them in some way.\n\n1980\n01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.450\nNow we can export them, look at them,\nand essentially recreate them.\n\n1981\n01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:33.530\nWe have to do the same thing with reports.\n\n1982\n01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:36.330\nIf we've customized those reports\nwe're gonna have to export those.\n\n1983\n01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:39.980\nSo yeah we don't always go through and\ntalk about all this stuff and\n\n1984\n01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:43.020\nafter we show you we say yeah, you're\nnot gonna get that, do this or that.\n\n1985\n01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.930\nBut it's important to know that\nwe can grab this stuff and\n\n1986\n01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:46.290\nhow to bring it out, right?\n\n1987\n01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:49.760\nSo we may go ahead and\nwe may decide we want to export out.\n\n1988\n01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:52.530\nSo select which objects,\nwell we want all of them.\n\n1989\n01:40:54.005 --> 01:40:58.615\nSpecify where we are going to put this,\nso we can actually save it.\n\n1990\n01:40:58.615 --> 01:41:02.385\nSo I'm just going to go out and\nput it on the desktop so I can find it.\n\n1991\n01:41:02.385 --> 01:41:03.635\nIt's going to be a MOV file.\n\n1992\n01:41:03.635 --> 01:41:04.605\nThis is just a quick and\n\n1993\n01:41:04.605 --> 01:41:08.135\ndirty demo just to really give you\nthe idea that we need to do that.\n\n1994\n01:41:08.135 --> 01:41:12.555\nI usually will call this query backup,\nright?\n\n1995\n01:41:12.555 --> 01:41:14.025\nSo I know that it's my export.\n\n1996\n01:41:14.025 --> 01:41:17.250\nI want to save that off, all right?\n\n1997\n01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:18.330\nHit Next.\n\n1998\n01:41:18.330 --> 01:41:19.340\nMake sure we do that.\n\n1999\n01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:20.730\nLet's just finish that out.\n\n2000\n01:41:20.730 --> 01:41:25.398\nLet's go in here, and\nlet's get over to the desktop.\n\n2001\n01:41:25.398 --> 01:41:28.301\nAnd there it is right up there.\n\n2002\n01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:29.910\nThere's our MOV file.\n\n2003\n01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:34.030\nAnd so then, what we can do,\nright, is we can go ahead and\n\n2004\n01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:38.880\nwe can import that into 12 R2 and\n\n2005\n01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.580\nwe can then have those queries if we want\nto use them or we can simply open this up.\n\n2006\n01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:46.460\nIt is just essentially\na text file afterall.\n\n2007\n01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:49.350\nThe Swiss army knife of networking\nprofessionals, note that.\n\n2008\n01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:52.170\nWhat a different world it would\nbe if we didn't have notepad.\n\n2009\n01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:53.930\nThings would just be radically different.\n\n2010\n01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:57.050\nWe would all have to use Notepad++.\n\n2011\n01:41:57.050 --> 01:42:00.460\nWe could see here that as we\nscroll down and we get in here and\n\n2012\n01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:05.480\nwe start to take a look,\nwe're gonna have every one of out queries,\n\n2013\n01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:08.710\ngonna tell us what they are,\ngive us information about them so\n\n2014\n01:42:08.710 --> 01:42:14.420\nwe would begin to see what these do and\nultimately have a record of them, right?\n\n2015\n01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:17.570\nSo we could say, yeah, this query,\nright, was doing this.\n\n2016\n01:42:17.570 --> 01:42:19.860\nThis query was targeting this class.\n\n2017\n01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:23.230\nSo we'd have to think through the logic\nthat we would need to understand,\n\n2018\n01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:25.175\nthat we'd want to have a record of these,\nright?\n\n2019\n01:42:25.175 --> 01:42:29.310\nCuz it would be helpful for us to\nwork with so that would be important.\n\n2020\n01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:33.100\nAnd then with reports,\nwe may want to go in,\n\n2021\n01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:36.930\nremember we can export and\nthen manually import reports as well, so\n\n2022\n01:42:36.930 --> 01:42:41.960\nwe may want to come in here, and\nwe may want to come over here to reports.\n\n2023\n01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.580\nAnd come in here to our reports,\nwe'll give this a second, and\n\n2024\n01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:50.970\nyou'll see that again,\nwe can take an overall export out,\n\n2025\n01:42:50.970 --> 01:42:55.890\nwe can export those objects and\nor [COUGH] we can come in\n\n2026\n01:42:55.890 --> 01:42:59.970\nto specific ones, and\nwe could export a specific object, right?\n\n2027\n01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:03.000\nSo we may just wanna choose one or\nmore, and report out, or\n\n2028\n01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.350\nexcuse me export out,\nthe reports that we want that we're\n\n2029\n01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:08.490\nultimately gonna be able\nto manually import.\n\n2030\n01:43:08.490 --> 01:43:12.700\nCuz we did specify, I was clear with you,\nthat we lose the ability to bring those\n\n2031\n01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:16.080\nover automatically, but we do have\nan option to manually bring them in\n\n2032\n01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.700\nafter the fact and\nwe can reimport them if we want to.\n\n2033\n01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:20.880\nSo want to make sure we're\nthinking about that and\n\n2034\n01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.455\nthat we have a sense of that as well.\n\n2035\n01:43:22.455 --> 01:43:27.385\nA lot of great information and a lot of\nintricate pieces inside of migrations.\n\n2036\n01:43:27.385 --> 01:43:30.515\nRemember what Adam pointed out in\nthe beginning of the episode churn and\n\n2037\n01:43:30.515 --> 01:43:31.925\nburn through that documentation.\n\n2038\n01:43:31.925 --> 01:43:34.702\nTechNet's out there,\nMicrosoft's got the documentation.\n\n2039\n01:43:34.702 --> 01:43:38.222\nIf you're watching this video, pause it,\nrewind it, do it a few times so that if\n\n2040\n01:43:38.222 --> 01:43:42.452\nyou are in a certification endeavor you\nwill get those answers right on the exam.\n\n2041\n01:43:42.452 --> 01:43:45.562\nAdam, got any parting words of wisdom for\nanybody that's thinking for\n\n2042\n01:43:45.562 --> 01:43:48.890\nmigration to SCCM 2012?\n\n2043\n01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:49.640\n>> Absolutely, and\n\n2044\n01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.620\nwe've actually already hit on the key\npoint which is the documentation and\n\n2045\n01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:56.340\nreally knowing, as we've talked about,\nwhere you're coming from, the as is,\n\n2046\n01:43:56.340 --> 01:44:01.140\nthe current state, know where you want\nto wind up, the to be and then you made\n\n2047\n01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:07.140\nan excellent point when you said, dry\nrun a few times and review back through.\n\n2048\n01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:10.210\nI know it's hard because you may not be\nable to actually set up a demo environment\n\n2049\n01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:12.110\nto do a migration lab in and\n\n2050\n01:44:12.110 --> 01:44:14.740\nyou're gonna essentially get\none shot at it in production.\n\n2051\n01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:16.420\nSo it's hard to figure it out.\n\n2052\n01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:20.550\nDon't underestimate the value of a hosted\nvirtualized environment that you can use,\n\n2053\n01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:22.250\nthat may not mirror production, but\n\n2054\n01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:24.790\nit's at least going to give you\nthe ability to see the steps involved.\n\n2055\n01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:28.200\nNow we've demonstrated one for you here,\nwe've walked you through it, but\n\n2056\n01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.570\nyou may want to put your hands on it.\n\n2057\n01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:34.670\nTo Wes' point, go out and use the hosted\nonline labs at TechNet that are free.\n\n2058\n01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:38.430\nGo out and build an environment yourself,\nif you have the capability to do so.\n\n2059\n01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:40.320\nWhatever you do, practice, and\n\n2060\n01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:43.100\nthen that way you'll feel a lot more\ncomfortable while you're doing it.\n\n2061\n01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.320\nYou saw that errors do occur.\n\n2062\n01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.880\nYou see things will happen.\n\n2063\n01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.620\nThey happen in a controlled environment,\nlike the environment we build for\n\n2064\n01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:49.710\nyou to do labs in.\n\n2065\n01:44:49.710 --> 01:44:52.630\nImagine what can happen in the chaos\nof the production environment.\n\n2066\n01:44:52.630 --> 01:44:53.900\nYou're gonna have issues.\n\n2067\n01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:55.220\nBe prepared to deal with them.\n\n2068\n01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:57.290\nTake a deep breath,\nnothing is catastrophic.\n\n2069\n01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:59.587\nNothing is gonna be so\nbad that you can't fix it.\n\n2070\n01:44:59.587 --> 01:45:02.010\nYou saw me have at least two or\nthree, right.\n\n2071\n01:45:02.010 --> 01:45:04.540\nWe couldn't migrate the client, right,\nbecause we couldn't connect to.\n\n2072\n01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.300\nWe're still not sure\nwhat happened with that.\n\n2073\n01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:09.840\nWe had some password issues,\nsome RPC issues, but we worked through and\n\n2074\n01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:10.980\nfixed the majority of them.\n\n2075\n01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:14.720\nWe just applied common sense\ntroubleshooting thought processes.\n\n2076\n01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:16.170\nMade sure we took our time.\n\n2077\n01:45:16.170 --> 01:45:18.250\nWent through the logic\nof what may be wrong.\n\n2078\n01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:20.590\nWhat were the error codes telling us and\nhow to fix them.\n\n2079\n01:45:20.590 --> 01:45:23.070\nAnd sure enough, we were successful\nat the end of the process.\n\n2080\n01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:27.150\nSo, just persevere is probably\nthe best advice I can give you
