episodes,\n\n4\n00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:14.533\nwe're gonna be covering system\ncenter configuration manager 2012R2.\n\n5\n00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.839\nAnd here to talk to us a little bit\nmore about what we can expect is Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:18.550\nAdam Gordan.\n\n7\n00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.420\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.640\n>> Going well, going well.\n\n9\n00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.530\nThank you so much.\n\n10\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.550\nPleasure to be with all of you.\n\n11\n00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.723\nSo we're gonna be talking\nabout system center 2012 R2.\n\n12\n00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:31.503\nThe exam associated with this\nset of episodes is 70-243.\n\n13\n00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:35.015\nMaybe we could quickly just throw up a,\nthe machine that we have that we're gonna\n\n14\n00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.805\njust demo, a little bit of\nthe information, maybe relevant for\n\n15\n00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.594\nyou with regards to what to expect,\nyou could see on the screen in\n\n16\n00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:43.670\nfront of you there,\nthat we do have the exam information.\n\n17\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.470\nThe current price of the exam, at least\nat the time we're talking to you anyway.\n\n18\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.870\nKeep in mind when you view this\nperhaps 6 to 9 months from now, and\n\n19\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.560\nthat price has hopefully gone down.\n\n20\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.100\nAnd then you'll thank us, and\n\n21\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.240\nif it has gone up well you\nshould have viewed it sooner.\n\n22\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.496\nWhat can I tell you?\n\n23\n00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:58.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But currently $150,\n\n24\n00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.330\nthat is the standard going rate by the way\nfor Microsoft exams in the United States.\n\n25\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.210\nThat is in USD, United States Dollars.\n\n26\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.170\nSo, if you're viewing this from outside\nthe United States, you obviously will get\n\n27\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.520\na different localized price for\nexams internationally, by country or by\n\n28\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.920\ngeography when you go to the appropriate\nMicrosoft website for your region.\n\n29\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.800\nAnd, do understand that.\n\n30\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.510\nAnd that is an important,\nsubtle but important point for\n\n31\n00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.540\nthose of you from outside the U.S.\n\n32\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.540\nExam pricing may very well be different\nacross the globe, and indeed it is.\n\n33\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd it is localized, so\njust make sure you're aware of that.\n\n34\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.920\nHowever, having said that,\nthe exam objectives are not gonna change.\n\n35\n00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.480\nWhenever you take the exam anywhere, they\nare gonna be the same, luckily for you.\n\n36\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.270\nWhich means that going through\nall these episodes with us,\n\n37\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.070\nyou will learn what you need to learn.\n\n38\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.100\nAnd, regardless of where you are,\nyou will be well prepared.\n\n39\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.298\nBut let me warn you know, and please heed\nmy warning, study hard and study long.\n\n40\n00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:52.800\nThis is an exam that requires\na great deal of attention to detail.\n\n41\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.868\nAnd when I talk about detail, if we could\nzoom down just a little bit down there to\n\n42\n00:01:56.868 --> 00:02:00.452\nwhere all those very, very small\nplus signs and blue writing are, and\n\n43\n00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:03.410\nwe're going to zoom in just\na little bit as I'm talking.\n\n44\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.682\nAnd what we will see Is that we\ncan see the exam objectives and\n\n45\n00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:11.536\nthe percentage of coverage\non the exam by objective.\n\n46\n00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:15.717\nAnd so you can see we have design and\nplan System Center Config Manager\n\n47\n00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:19.046\ninfrastructure, roughly\n10 to 15% of the exam.\n\n48\n00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:23.032\nThis is gonna be focusing on things\nlike how do we, from a best practice\n\n49\n00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:28.580\nperspective, understand how to plan for a\nsingle site versus a multi-site hierarchy?\n\n50\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.660\nWe talk a lot about this in our\nepisodes on design and implementation.\n\n51\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.100\nWhat is a single-site hierarchy,\nyou may ask.\n\n52\n00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.095\nWell, come and join me for all the class\nepisodes, and we'll be happy to show you!\n\n53\n00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:41.783\nIf we wanna talk about\nmulti-site hierarchies,\n\n54\n00:02:41.783 --> 00:02:44.983\nwe're talking about central admin sites,\nprimary site or\n\n55\n00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:49.140\nsites and/or secondary sites or\nchild sites that are linked to them.\n\n56\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.968\nBut to find out more, and to see\nthe fabulous drawings that we have for\n\n57\n00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:55.813\nyou that would represent\nall of this information.\n\n58\n00:02:55.813 --> 00:02:58.890\nYou have to actually come and\nparticipate in all of these episodes, so\n\n59\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.980\nwe encourage you to certainly do that.\n\n60\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.473\nYou´ll see managing operating system\ndeployments, what´s known as the OSD,\n\n61\n00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:05.097\nfeature set.\n\n62\n00:03:05.097 --> 00:03:09.725\nAgain roughly 10 to 15%, we walk\nthrough and do a live demonstration of\n\n63\n00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:14.066\nmultiple technology areas in every\none of these exam objective areas,\n\n64\n00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:19.090\nto make sure that you are gonna be able\nto understand what is expected of you.\n\n65\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.930\nHow to use the technology\nin the real world.\n\n66\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.270\nMake sure you understand\nthe best practices.\n\n67\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.090\nAnd the do's and don'ts from the\nperspective of, hey we've done this a lot.\n\n68\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.643\nLet us share our knowledge with you.\n\n69\n00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:33.739\nMake sure you know what to do, but also\nwhat to avoid, and as well as all that\n\n70\n00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.254\nhelp you to then understand how to\npractice the skills hands on so\n\n71\n00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:40.400\nthat you understand how to prepare for\nthis exam.\n\n72\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.539\nSo managing the operating\nsystem deployment feature set,\n\n73\n00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:48.058\nwe're gonna take a look at how to do at\nWindows 8.1 enterprise endpoint deployment\n\n74\n00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.392\nto a bare metal install.\n\n75\n00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:53.600\nGonna actually use a set of hosted labs\ndirectly from Microsoft for that one.\n\n76\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.480\nWe demo on the hands-on lab\ntechnology platform on Technet\n\n77\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.510\nusing Microsoft's own technology.\n\n78\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.348\nAnd their own hosted labs that\nare freely available to you.\n\n79\n00:04:02.348 --> 00:04:05.180\nAnd we will tell you where to find these,\nif you're not familiar with them.\n\n80\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.490\nAnd we walk you through step-by-step how\nto do that entire deployment sequence and\n\n81\n00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.790\nshow it to you live.\n\n82\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.450\nInside that episode.\n\n83\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.190\nDeploying applications and software\nupdates, roughly 10 to 15% of the exam.\n\n84\n00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.870\nWe spend a great deal of time walking\nyou through how to do application and\n\n85\n00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.280\npackage based deployments.\n\n86\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.190\nWe show you how to do both of those live.\n\n87\n00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.107\nAnd we actually walk through,\nand explain to you how and\n\n88\n00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:31.079\nwhat the best practices are behind the\nscenes in terms of how to configure and\n\n89\n00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.953\nset up and\nthen ultimately manage these deployments.\n\n90\n00:04:33.953 --> 00:04:38.020\nManaging compliance settings, we'll\ntake a look at baseline compliance and\n\n91\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.780\ntalk about configuration items and\nhow to set up and manage compliance,\n\n92\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.725\nwe'll actually also import an external\nconfiguration management pack and\n\n93\n00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:49.916\nbring in external configuration items and\nconfiguration baselines from a third\n\n94\n00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:53.583\nparty vendor and show you how to\nimplement those and use those as well.\n\n95\n00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:56.424\nManaging sites,\nwe'll be talking about as we did and\n\n96\n00:04:56.424 --> 00:04:59.391\nwe talked a little bit about\nup top with design and plan,\n\n97\n00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:03.938\nwhat the individual specifics are of site\nmanagement, whether it is a primary site,\n\n98\n00:05:03.938 --> 00:05:07.158\nwhether it is a child site that\nis linked to the primary site,\n\n99\n00:05:07.158 --> 00:05:11.115\nwhether it is a central admin site\nthat the primary site is linked to.\n\n100\n00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:15.108\nWe'll talk about those different sites\nas well as the individual site roles.\n\n101\n00:05:15.108 --> 00:05:19.023\nWhether it is the software update point,\nwhether it is going to be the ability\n\n102\n00:05:19.023 --> 00:05:23.330\nto have a distribution point, a management\npoint, a fall back status point.\n\n103\n00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.470\nA certificate enrollment point,\nwhatever it may be,\n\n104\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.720\nwe'll talk about the majority of these\ncertainly can configure many of them,\n\n105\n00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.380\nand show you how to get in under\nthe hood and work with them.\n\n106\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.480\nHave the nuts and\nbolts at the granular level.\n\n107\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.381\nAnd you'll be joining for those episodes\nhopefully along with all these others, and\n\n108\n00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:39.367\nsee how that is done.\n\n109\n00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:43.600\nWe'll focus on managing clients,\nwe'll focus on managing inventory.\n\n110\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.136\nAnd managing reports and queries, we'll do\na whole episode on how to set up queries,\n\n111\n00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:51.917\nand use them to populate not only\ncollections, but also how to set up and\n\n112\n00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:54.958\ninstall a sequel services,\nrecording services point.\n\n113\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.753\nAnd then we will then actually generate\nand show you how to set up those reports.\n\n114\n00:05:58.753 --> 00:06:02.100\nWe'll also take a look at how\nto use queries generically.\n\n115\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.300\nThe WQL, the W my query language.\n\n116\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.290\nTo be able to go in and\nactually drive queries.\n\n117\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.109\nAnd queries are so valuable,\nso important to what we do in\n\n118\n00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:13.872\nSystem Center Config Manager because\nthey underlie our ability to be able to\n\n119\n00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:17.931\nunderstand how to identify, manage, and\nultimately manipulate information to\n\n120\n00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:21.140\ncreate collections to populate\nthem with dynamic membership.\n\n121\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.048\nAnd to then be able to use that in\naddition to be able to then create and\n\n122\n00:06:25.048 --> 00:06:29.919\ndrive reporting, so we'll be examine these\nand a lot of other little hidden nooks,\n\n123\n00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.200\ncranny's, gems, and valuable insights that\nboth myself and our co host mister Mike.\n\n124\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.110\nWho was the one just introduced\nthis whole episode to you.\n\n125\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.670\nIs gonna go ahead.\n\n126\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.660\nOr are gonna go ahead and share with you.\n\n127\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.178\nAs you join us for this and for\n\n128\n00:06:43.178 --> 00:06:47.619\nall episodes associated with system\ncenter configuration manager 2012 R2.\n\n129\n00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.260\nLook forward to seeing you there.\n\n130\n00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.378\nHopefully you'll be able to come in and\nspend some time with us,\n\n131\n00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:55.612\nlearn about all the really cool and\nvaluable things you can do, and\n\n132\n00:06:55.612 --> 00:06:58.699\nbecome successful at taking and\npassing the 7-243 exam.\n\n133\n00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:05.039\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
