          "transcript": "1\n00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:10,078\n[SOUND] Welcome back to ITProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:11,053\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n3\n00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,190\nToday, our guest speaker\nwith us is Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n4\n00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,987\nHow are you doing this morning Adam?\n\n5\n00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:16,484\n>> Good.\nGood morning everybody.\n\n6\n00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,007\nVery good.\n\n7\n00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,402\n>> And what we wanna do is\nwe want to take a minute to\n\n8\n00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:25,104\nbasically christen our new show\nthat we're launching on SSCP,\n\n9\n00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:30,262\nthe latest in the entry of many\nsecurity certifications that we have.\n\n10\n00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:34,835\nAnd we wanna take a few minutes just\nto kind of describe what the SSCP is.\n\n11\n00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,965\nWho it's a good fit for, and\nhow you go about obtaining it\n\n12\n00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:42,405\nbefore we dive into all of our shows that\ngive you the information that we need.\n\n13\n00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:43,185\n>> Very good.\n\n14\n00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,895\n>> So Adam, why don't you get us started,\n\n15\n00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:49,100\njust kind of give us a little overview of\nthe SSCP, and what the certification is.\n\n16\n00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,350\n>> Absolutely, so the ideas behind\nthe SSCP, the system security certified\n\n17\n00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,350\npractitioner by the way, that's what SSCP\nstands for, an (ISC)2 certification.\n\n18\n00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,050\nA certification for\na hands on practitioner, so\n\n19\n00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,540\nmuch more so than somebody who is\ngoing to be a more senior manager.\n\n20\n00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,729\nThis is a person who is gonna have hands\non day to day responsibility for making\n\n21\n00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:14,314\nsure that IT, specifically IT security\nconcerns in the enterprise are addressed.\n\n22\n00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:18,337\nSo, they'll be the people that will be\nin the trenches dealing with firewalls,\n\n23\n00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:22,954\ndealing with networks, setting up wireless\nsecurity, setting up virtualized security,\n\n24\n00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:24,687\nand doing that on a regular basis.\n\n25\n00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:28,221\nAnd so, we typically see somebody\nwith a year of experience going\n\n26\n00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,460\nthrough certification like this.\n\n27\n00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,560\nSome hands on real world experience along\nwith some theory behind some of the areas\n\n28\n00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,940\nthat are gonna be covered in the common\nbody of knowledge, what we call the CBK.\n\n29\n00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,129\nWhich is the reference point for this.\n\n30\n00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:44,350\nAnd you really got to be, if you're out\nthere thinking about becoming an SSCP,\n\n31\n00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,690\nbe looking to market your skills\nto your potential employers.\n\n32\n00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:52,185\nBy saying this is a credential that\nvalidates me being able to do these things\n\n33\n00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:54,990\nreal-time as I go into the environment.\n\n34\n00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,198\nAnd I'm gonna be able to\nhelp you setup your network,\n\n35\n00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:00,740\nwill be able to help you secure it,\nhelp you monitor it, but\n\n36\n00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,930\nalso help you to understand\nwhat goes on in a day to day.\n\n37\n00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,410\n>> Yeah, and that's a really good point.\n\n38\n00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,700\nThe SSCP, you'll hear it described a lot\nof times in conjunction with this CISSP,\n\n39\n00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,960\nwhich is another\ncertification from (ISC)2.\n\n40\n00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,050\nThe CISSP very highly\nregarded certification, but\n\n41\n00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,002\nit is focused more around\nthat security manager.\n\n42\n00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:23,300\nThat high-level knowledge, that\na person who's been in the trenches for\n\n43\n00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,960\na long time.\n\n44\n00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,410\nThe SSCP, that's more of the doer,\n\n45\n00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,830\nthe person who's actually\ngetting their hands dirty.\n\n46\n00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,640\nGetting these systems put in place,\nprotecting the network, so\n\n47\n00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,470\nit's really cool.\n\n48\n00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,650\nIt covers a lot of neat technologies.\n\n49\n00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,370\nAdam, what are some of the things\nthat we cover in SSCP?\n\n50\n00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,891\n>> So, the criteria that we're gonna look\nat are what we call the common body of\n\n51\n00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:42,782\nknowledge areas.\n\n52\n00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:45,448\nThere are seven of them,\nare gonna be access control.\n\n53\n00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,720\nSo we're gonna be talking about all\nthe things associated with how we control\n\n54\n00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,560\naccess.\n\n55\n00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,030\nThe policies, the standards, the\nimplementation models, things like that.\n\n56\n00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,990\nWe'll take a look at security operations,\nand administration.\n\n57\n00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,828\nSo we'll be talking about what\na security administrator does,\n\n58\n00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,506\nwhat are the kind of things that\nadd to management policies,\n\n59\n00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:03,780\nthings of that nature that\nyou might be looking at.\n\n60\n00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,195\nWe'll take a look at monitoring,\nand analysis.\n\n61\n00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:11,670\nAnd talk about continuous monitoring,\nhow we monitor, how we look at results.\n\n62\n00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,460\nThings such as firewall logs,\nintrusion protection, and defense systems,\n\n63\n00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,610\nthings of that nature.\n\n64\n00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,690\nWe'll be taking a look at risk response,\nand recovery.\n\n65\n00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,280\nSo, what is risk management?\n\n66\n00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,310\nHow important is risk,\nthreat, vulnerability?\n\n67\n00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,340\nHow do we address those?\n\n68\n00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,580\nHow do we define them?\n\n69\n00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,800\nWhat is business continuity?\n\n70\n00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,290\nWhat is disaster recovery?\n\n71\n00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,080\nHow do we plan for those events that may,\nor may not be on the horizon for\n\n72\n00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,340\nus initially as we open\nup our minds to security.\n\n73\n00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,290\nBut ultimately as we know, when we\nare security management professionals, and\n\n74\n00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,240\nsecurity practitioners,\nwe have to address risk every day.\n\n75\n00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,610\nAnd so, how do we do that?\n\n76\n00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,069\nCryptography, and the use of cryptography\nin networks to provide security.\n\n77\n00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,530\n[INAUDIBLE] Have been a lot of talk\nover the last couple of years about what\n\n78\n00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,565\nsecurity is, and is not, based on being\nable to look at people's email, or listen\n\n79\n00:03:56,565 --> 00:04:00,339\nto their phone calls, all sorts of things\nthat we may, or may not be aware of.\n\n80\n00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:01,064\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n81\n00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:03,691\nthe security practitioner\ntakes a look at that, and\n\n82\n00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:06,737\nfrom the practitioner perspective\nwould say to a business,\n\n83\n00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:10,310\nthis is what we need to do in order\nto implement a secure solution.\n\n84\n00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,210\nThese are the kind of\nalgorithms we may use, and\n\n85\n00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,900\nthese are the kind of cryptographic\nsolutions we may wanna put in place.\n\n86\n00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,950\nThese are the secure protocols\nthat we want to use.\n\n87\n00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,990\nFor networks, and communication,\nwe take a look at the bread, and\n\n88\n00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,660\nbutter of what a security\npractitioner does everyday.\n\n89\n00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,260\nWe think about the networks,\nthe telecommunications solutions that they\n\n90\n00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,720\ndeploy, whether they're wireless,\nor wired.\n\n91\n00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,297\nWhether they are looking at remote access,\nor people that work in an office,\n\n92\n00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:39,041\nthey're going to look at firewalls,\nwireless technology, all the things that\n\n93\n00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,804\nare associated with network access,\nreally top to bottom, across that stack.\n\n94\n00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:47,499\nAnd then we finish up with malicious code,\nand activity, one of my most\n\n95\n00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:52,290\nfavorite sections in the sense that I\ndo a lot of work around these areas.\n\n96\n00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,975\nIs to spend time talking about the things\nthat can go wrong in a system, And\n\n97\n00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,870\nunderstand how to identify them,\nand be aware of them.\n\n98\n00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,260\nSo that way we are able to zero in on the\nissues we have, and as a result hopefully,\n\n99\n00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,210\nidentify the problems with malware,\ntrojans, worms, anything that could go\n\n100\n00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,690\non with, not only transmissions of those,\nbut countermeasures associated with them.\n\n101\n00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,250\n>> So, those are our seven domains.\n\n102\n00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,500\nThese are the knowledge areas\nthat we need to focus in,\n\n103\n00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,028\nif we plan on getting\nthe SSCP certification.\n\n104\n00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,090\nSo Adam, and let's say that I look at\nthat list, and I say, you know what,\n\n105\n00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,320\nI'm an expert on all of that stuff.\n\n106\n00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,760\nI'm ready to take the exam today.\n\n107\n00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,030\nSo, what do I need to know about the exam?\n\n108\n00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,940\n>> So\nthe exam is gonna be computer-based today.\n\n109\n00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,631\nYears ago, if you were sitting for an exam\nfrom (ISC)2, they were paper-based exams.\n\n110\n00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:38,760\nThey were going to use a scantron bubble,\nand answer sheet, and\n\n111\n00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,190\nyou would sit for four hours for this,\nor three hours for this exam rather.\n\n112\n00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,850\nAnd it would have been 125 questions, and\nyou would have had to go through, and\n\n113\n00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,310\nwrite out all the answers by hand.\n\n114\n00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,850\nToday, they're computerized.\n\n115\n00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,085\nYou can go into a secure testing center,\nand you can take the exam.\n\n116\n00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:56,612\nIt is still 125 questions, you need to\nscore 700, or better in order to pass.\n\n117\n00:05:56,612 --> 00:06:00,737\nAnd you will need to make sure you have\nat least one year of proven experience in\n\n118\n00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:04,555\nthe field in one, or more of the seven\nareas we just identified for you.\n\n119\n00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:08,813\nThat you can document on your application,\nand then you're able to validate that\n\n120\n00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:13,005\nexperience through the application\nprocess after you take the exam.\n\n121\n00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,975\nAnd so, what happens is,\nyou go, and sit for the exam.\n\n122\n00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,185\nPass the exam.\n\n123\n00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:20,115\nThen you go through an application\nprocess through (ISC)2,\n\n124\n00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:21,607\nwhere you submit an application.\n\n125\n00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:26,200\nValidate your three-year resume, and your\ncredentials that you have the experience.\n\n126\n00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,350\nAnd then you're able to,\n\n127\n00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,070\nalong with the fee that you pay to apply,\nsend all that paperwork into (ISC)2.\n\n128\n00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,470\nThere's a small delay,\nwhile they go through the application.\n\n129\n00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,350\nYou may randomly,\nbe chosen to have an application audited.\n\n130\n00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,470\nIf you are, you may be asked some\nfollow up questions about 10%\n\n131\n00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,040\nof people on average get audited randomly.\n\n132\n00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,320\nBut more often than not, you simply\ngo through the application process.\n\n133\n00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,260\nWithin about a week, give, or\ntake depending on the time of the year,\n\n134\n00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,280\nyou hear back that you've been accepted\nas long as your credentials hold up, and\n\n135\n00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,170\neverything is validated on your resume.\n\n136\n00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,310\nAnd your granted in this\ncase the SSCP credential.\n\n137\n00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,030\nOnce your granted that credential,\n\n138\n00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,530\nyou will have a three-year cycle where\nyou are expected as a professional\n\n139\n00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,890\nin the field practicing your\ncraft to accrue CPE credits.\n\n140\n00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,720\nYou must do 40 credits a year in order to\nbe able to maintain your certification,\n\n141\n00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,430\n120 credits over a three-year cycle.\n\n142\n00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,970\nYou are then able to provide\ndocumentation about those credits through\n\n143\n00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,890\nan online portal, through the web.\n\n144\n00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,610\nYou submit them, and\nthen you pay your membership fees, and\n\n145\n00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,720\nrenew your certification on\na three-year cycle based on those fees.\n\n146\n00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,340\nAssuming you stay active, and you get\nyour CPEs, there is no re-certification\n\n147\n00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,390\nprocess at this point,\nmeaning you don't have to re-sir the exam.\n\n148\n00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,160\nHowever, if you let your certification\nlapse, if you don't stay active, you will\n\n149\n00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,570\nneed to re-sit the exam, so it's really\na question of what you choose to do.\n\n150\n00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,950\nBut there are professionals out there that\njust simply want to re-certify every three\n\n151\n00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,605\nyears, because they wanna prove they're\nstaying current on the technology,\n\n152\n00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:50,015\nand up to date with the knowledge.\n\n153\n00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,275\nSo, truly up to you at the end of the day.\n\n154\n00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,284\n>> Yeah, one thing I like to\nhighlight about this, (ISC)2,\n\n155\n00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:57,135\nthat they really stress having experience.\n\n156\n00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:59,415\nAnd Adam said it for the SSCP,\n\n157\n00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:05,145\nyou're really supposed to have the either\none-year of actual in field experience.\n\n158\n00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:07,900\nOr sometimes you hear\npeople say the equivalency.\n\n159\n00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,510\nWell, when you submit your\npaperwork to the (ISC)2,\n\n160\n00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,300\nyou show that you have to have\ndocumented one-year of experience.\n\n161\n00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,210\nIts not like CompTIA, or\nwhere it can be equivalent.\n\n162\n00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,580\nYou actually need to have that experience.\n\n163\n00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,140\nSo, this is a certification\nthat is designed for\n\n164\n00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,240\npeople that are already working\nin the security field, or\n\n165\n00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,200\nat least working with security\nrelated infrastructure, and equipment.\n\n166\n00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,930\nWhat if you don't?\n\n167\n00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,590\nIf you're one of those\npeople that doesn't?\n\n168\n00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,520\nIf you're just getting started, and you've\ndecided that security is the way to go,\n\n169\n00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,020\nthen SSCP is probably not\nthe certification for you right now.\n\n170\n00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,170\nInstead you should be looking to\nthings like CompTIA Security Plus.\n\n171\n00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,480\nWith Security Plus you get the base\nknowledge, it's actually a very similar,\n\n172\n00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,540\nnot as in depth, but\nvery similar to what we see here in SSCP.\n\n173\n00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,550\nBut it is designed for\npeople who maybe just starting out,\n\n174\n00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,520\nwho may not have any field experience.\n\n175\n00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,800\nBut if you're already working the field,\nand you're looking for\n\n176\n00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,910\na way to validate that knowledge\nSSCP is the certification to use.\n\n177\n00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,000\nThat's one thing I've\nalways like about (ISC)2,\n\n178\n00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,370\nlet's pull up these requirements again.\n\n179\n00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,280\nIt is you'll notice how they say,\nobtain the required experience, and\n\n180\n00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,990\nthen in your study for exam used\nthese optional educational tools.\n\n181\n00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,770\nIn other words, if you have all the field\nexperience, you don't need study tools.\n\n182\n00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,080\nYou can just go, and take the exam.\n\n183\n00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,680\nGo ahead, and have it.\n\n184\n00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,640\nBut if you work in it, but\nnot in all the areas, and you wanna\n\n185\n00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,215\nround off that information, that's where\nthings like our show come in handy.\n\n186\n00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:32,395\nThe official training, the textbooks,\nthe self-paced stuff that's out there.\n\n187\n00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:35,605\nAll those different things help to make\nsure you've got that base of knowledge to\n\n188\n00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:38,275\nbe ready, for what's on the exam.\n\n189\n00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,025\n>> One other thing we wanna\nmake sure you're aware of,\n\n190\n00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:42,900\nas well when you go through\nthe endorsement process,\n\n191\n00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,300\nthis idea of after you actually pass\nthe exam, the application process.\n\n192\n00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,520\nWe call it formally,\nthe endorsement process.\n\n193\n00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,150\nYou have a nine-month window,\n(ISC)2 gives you time,\n\n194\n00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,330\nin other words, after you pass the exam,\nin order to apply.\n\n195\n00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,458\nSo, while you wanna do\nit as soon as possible,\n\n196\n00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,680\nwe understand that there are needs\nto be a window where things happen,\n\n197\n00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,940\nyou're busy with work, or whatever.\n\n198\n00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,638\nAnd so, you're given a window where\nyou then, those scores are good.\n\n199\n00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,895\nBut they're good for\nup to nine months for you to apply.\n\n200\n00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,383\nYou don't wanna wait too long,\nbut you can go out, and\n\n201\n00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:13,525\nget your paperwork in order to get\nsomebody to formally endorse you,\n\n202\n00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,420\nmake sure you have the credential\ninformation in your resume.\n\n203\n00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,480\nYou need to validate your experience,\nthings of that nature.\n\n204\n00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,630\nSo, there is a window.\n\n205\n00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,050\nIt's not an immediate requirement,\nbut it is one you wanna be aware of.\n\n206\n00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,630\nAnd you do have the ability,\ntry get somebody in your business, or\n\n207\n00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,560\na peer, or colleague that you know,\nto do an endorsement for you.\n\n208\n00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,190\nIf they can speak to your experience,\nor if there's a sitting SSCP in good\n\n209\n00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,690\nstanding, meaning somebody who's already\ncertified, they can vouch for you,\n\n210\n00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,530\non your application.\n\n211\n00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,509\nIn effect, they do what's called an\nendorsement, and they can simply sign off\n\n212\n00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,543\non the application saying they've known\nyou, they know the kind of work you do.\n\n213\n00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:48,665\nAnd they are familiar with you,\nand are willing to stand up for\n\n214\n00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:52,100\nyou if asked, to validate that you\nshould be able to become an SSCP.\n\n215\n00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,439\nAnd by doing that, you then are able to\nvalidate the requirements we have listed\n\n216\n00:10:56,439 --> 00:11:01,100\nfor you rather, in terms of making sure\nthat you can validate your experience.\n\n217\n00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,510\nYou also will be required to subscribe\nto the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics.\n\n218\n00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,096\nMeaning, during your application process,\nyou have to agree to follow the Code\n\n219\n00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,693\nof Ethics that (ISC)2 has\npublished on their website.\n\n220\n00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:13,398\nYou may wanna go look at that website,\nat some point.\n\n221\n00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:16,278\nIt's, www.isc2.org,\n\n222\n00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:22,090\nI think Don's gonna bring\nit up while we're talking.\n\n223\n00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,675\nAnd so, making sure you're familiar\nwith what's on the website at all\n\n224\n00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:29,135\ntimes to get the most up to date\ncertification, information,\n\n225\n00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:31,965\nas well as understanding what's there for\nthe code of ethics,\n\n226\n00:11:31,965 --> 00:11:36,147\nis part of the requirement for being\nan SSCP, or any certified professional.\n\n227\n00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:39,187\nYou as a certified professional\nin any area, wanna\n\n228\n00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:42,447\ndo your due diligence generically, and\nunderstand the requirements of your field,\n\n229\n00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:45,097\nand make sure you're up to date\non the most recent information.\n\n230\n00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:47,963\nSo, do take a look at the website, you can\nsee it up on the screen as we're talking.\n\n231\n00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:49,637\nIt is gonna be important for you, and\n\n232\n00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:51,585\nthere is a link there\nto the code of ethics.\n\n233\n00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,420\nAnd you'll be able to follow it in order\nto be able to find out what is there,\n\n234\n00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,033\nand to make sure you understand\nthe requirements of being a certified\n\n235\n00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:57,676\nprofessional.\n\n236\n00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:01,209\n>> Yeah, and in fact, the little document\nthat I've brought up on the screen a few\n\n237\n00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,798\ntimes, this guy right here with\nthe overview, and all that information.\n\n238\n00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:06,947\nThat's right from (ISC)2's website,\n\n239\n00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:10,170\nif you goto credentials you'll\nsee the SSCP right there.\n\n240\n00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,120\nAnd if you go to about the SSCP, that\nit's right here, that you can come in,\n\n241\n00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,270\nand pull up the brochure.\n\n242\n00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,025\nWhere is it?\n\n243\n00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,224\n>> Right there- [CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh right there, scroll down.\n\n244\n00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,980\nSo you can find the SSCP\nbrochure right there.\n\n245\n00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,440\nYou can also get more\ndetailed information,\n\n246\n00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,920\nwhich we're gonna see as we go\nthrough the shows on the website.\n\n247\n00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,540\nTons of good information\nto be found there.\n\n248\n00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,240\nSo Adam, I think that pretty much\ncovers all the general stuff.\n\n249\n00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,567\nDo you have any other little bits that\nwe wantna throw out, before we wrap up?\n\n250\n00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:39,144\n>> Probably just to think about the fact,\nthat because this is\n\n251\n00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:42,560\na credential that is designed from\npractitioners, people that are hands on.\n\n252\n00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,032\nIf you're not comfortable with some of\nthe things we may be speaking about,\n\n253\n00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,420\nin terms of experience, and\nsome of the technology we've talked about.\n\n254\n00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,200\nThere are other course programs\nthat you can take a look at, so\n\n255\n00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,500\nyou wanna make sure you're thinking\nabout things like Security Plus.\n\n256\n00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,850\nYou've heard Don mention that.\n\n257\n00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,940\nMaybe some of the other A+, or\nNetwork Plus CompTIA content that will\n\n258\n00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,830\nhelp you with some of the background\ninformation, just to make sure you go\n\n259\n00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,550\nthrough a refresher, take a look at\nthat content, be familiar with it.\n\n260\n00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,830\nYeah, we all do a lot of this stuff\neveryday in our security practices,\n\n261\n00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,910\nif this is what you do for a living,\nbut it may have been a while since you\n\n262\n00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,620\ntouched the firewall,\nif that's not what you do everyday.\n\n263\n00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,752\nAnd so, just going back, and reviewing\nsome of the content to make sure you're\n\n264\n00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:21,157\ncomfortable with it,\nis really gonna be the key to success.\n\n265\n00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,970\nAnd we look forward to having\nthose conversations with you.\n\n266\n00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,537\n>> Yep.\n\n267\n00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:28,245\nAnd remember as an ITProTV subscriber,\nyou're not charged per class.\n\n268\n00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:29,005\nYou get it all.\n\n269\n00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:32,795\nSo, for the hands on experience, if you\nneed to brush up on that definitely,\n\n270\n00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:37,480\ncheck out some of the other shows like\nthe CCNA Security show for Cisco Security.\n\n271\n00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,360\nWe also have the Microsoft\n70-410 show that covers\n\n272\n00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,100\na little bit of security\nfunctions inside of Windows.\n\n273\n00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,480\nAnd there's a few other ones like Security\nPlus, that are security related too.\n\n274\n00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,250\nLot's of good information to\nbe found in all of those, and\n\n275\n00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,120\nyou can always just browse through, and\n\n276\n00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,920\nwatch individual episodes to find specific\ntopics that you're looking to brush up on.\n\n277\n00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,800\nWell, also keep in mind if you\never have any questions on this,\n\n278\n00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,732\nif you have a questions about\nthe SSCP certification in general.\n\n279\n00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:04,792\nYou're always welcome to use our Q&A\nsystem at the top of every ITProTV\n\n280\n00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:07,374\nwebpage, you'll see a link that says Q&A.\n\n281\n00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:08,280\nYou can click there.\n\n282\n00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,830\nGo, and post your questions.\n\n283\n00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,350\nWe monitor, and answer, we'll make\nsure you get the information you need.\n\n284\n00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,300\nWell, we're really looking forward\nto kicking off the SSCP, and\n\n285\n00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,680\nin fact we're gonna start shooting\nthose right after this one wraps.\n\n286\n00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,500\nSo, we'll stop here.\n\n287\n00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,304\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n288\n00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:22,419\n>> Im Adam Gordon.\n\n289\n00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:23,801\n>> And we'll see you
