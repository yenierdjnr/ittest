          "transcript": "1\n00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:10,078\n[SOUND] Welcome back to ITProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:11,053\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n3\n00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,190\nToday, our guest speaker\nwith us is Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n4\n00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,987\nHow are you doing this morning Adam?\n\n5\n00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:16,484\n>> Good.\nGood morning everybody.\n\n6\n00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,007\nVery good.\n\n7\n00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,402\n>> And what we wanna do is\nwe want to take a minute to\n\n8\n00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:25,104\nbasically christen our new show\nthat we're launching on SSCP,\n\n9\n00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:30,262\nthe latest in the entry of many\nsecurity certifications that we have.\n\n10\n00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:34,835\nAnd we wanna take a few minutes just\nto kind of describe what the SSCP is.\n\n11\n00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,965\nWho it's a good fit for, and\nhow you go about obtaining it\n\n12\n00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:42,405\nbefore we dive into all of our shows that\ngive you the information that we need.\n\n13\n00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:43,185\n>> Very good.\n\n14\n00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,895\n>> So Adam, why don't you get us started,\n\n15\n00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:49,100\njust kind of give us a little overview of\nthe SSCP, and what the certification is.\n\n16\n00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,350\n>> Absolutely, so the ideas behind\nthe SSCP, the system security certified\n\n17\n00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,350\npractitioner by the way, that's what SSCP\nstands for, an (ISC)2 certification.\n\n18\n00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,050\nA certification for\na hands on practitioner, so\n\n19\n00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,540\nmuch more so than somebody who is\ngoing to be a more senior manager.\n\n20\n00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,729\nThis is a person who is gonna have hands\non day to day responsibility for making\n\n21\n00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:14,314\nsure that IT, specifically IT security\nconcerns in the enterprise are addressed.\n\n22\n00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:18,337\nSo, they'll be the people that will be\nin the trenches dealing with firewalls,\n\n23\n00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:22,954\ndealing with networks, setting up wireless\nsecurity, setting up virtualized security,\n\n24\n00:01:22,954 --> 00:01:24,687\nand doing that on a regular basis.\n\n25\n00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:28,221\nAnd so, we typically see somebody\nwith a year of experience going\n\n26\n00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,460\nthrough certification like this.\n\n27\n00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,560\nSome hands on real world experience along\nwith some theory behind some of the areas\n\n28\n00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,940\nthat are gonna be covered in the common\nbody of knowledge, what we call the CBK.\n\n29\n00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,129\nWhich is the reference point for this.\n\n30\n00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:44,350\nAnd you really got to be, if you're out\nthere thinking about becoming an SSCP,\n\n31\n00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,690\nbe looking to market your skills\nto your potential employers.\n\n32\n00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:52,185\nBy saying this is a credential that\nvalidates me being able to do these things\n\n33\n00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:54,990\nreal-time as I go into the environment.\n\n34\n00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,198\nAnd I'm gonna be able to\nhelp you setup your network,\n\n35\n00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:00,740\nwill be able to help you secure it,\nhelp you monitor it, but\n\n36\n00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,930\nalso help you to understand\nwhat goes on in a day to day.\n\n37\n00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,410\n>> Yeah, and that's a really good point.\n\n38\n00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,700\nThe SSCP, you'll hear it described a lot\nof times in conjunction with this CISSP,\n\n39\n00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,960\nwhich is another\ncertification from (ISC)2.\n\n40\n00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,050\nThe CISSP very highly\nregarded certification, but\n\n41\n00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,002\nit is focused more around\nthat security manager.\n\n42\n00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:23,300\nThat high-level knowledge, that\na person who's been in the trenches for\n\n43\n00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,960\na long time.\n\n44\n00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,410\nThe SSCP, that's more of the doer,\n\n45\n00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,830\nthe person who's actually\ngetting their hands dirty.\n\n46\n00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,640\nGetting these systems put in place,\nprotecting the network, so\n\n47\n00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,470\nit's really cool.\n\n48\n00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,650\nIt covers a lot of neat technologies.\n\n49\n00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,370\nAdam, what are some of the things\nthat we cover in SSCP?\n\n50\n00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,891\n>> So, the criteria that we're gonna look\nat are what we call the common body of\n\n51\n00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:42,782\nknowledge areas.\n\n52\n00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:45,448\nThere are seven of them,\nare gonna be access control.\n\n53\n00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,720\nSo we're gonna be talking about all\nthe things associated with how we control\n\n54\n00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,560\naccess.\n\n55\n00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,030\nThe policies, the standards, the\nimplementation models, things like that.\n\n56\n00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,990\nWe'll take a look at security operations,\nand administration.\n\n57\n00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,828\nSo we'll be talking about what\na security administrator does,\n\n58\n00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,506\nwhat are the kind of things that\nadd to management policies,\n\n59\n00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:03,780\nthings of that nature that\nyou might be looking at.\n\n60\n00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,195\nWe'll take a look at monitoring,\nand analysis.\n\n61\n00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:11,670\nAnd talk about continuous monitoring,\nhow we monitor, how we look at results.\n\n62\n00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,460\nThings such as firewall logs,\nintrusion protection, and defense systems,\n\n63\n00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,610\nthings of that nature.\n\n64\n00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,690\nWe'll be taking a look at risk response,\nand recovery.\n\n65\n00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,280\nSo, what is risk management?\n\n66\n00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,310\nHow important is risk,\nthreat, vulnerability?\n\n67\n00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,340\nHow do we address those?\n\n68\n00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,580\nHow do we define them?\n\n69\n00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,800\nWhat is business continuity?\n\n70\n00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,290\nWhat is disaster recovery?\n\n71\n00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,080\nHow do we plan for those events that may,\nor may not be on the horizon for\n\n72\n00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,340\nus initially as we open\nup our minds to security.\n\n73\n00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,290\nBut ultimately as we know, when we\nare security management professionals, and\n\n74\n00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,240\nsecurity practitioners,\nwe have to address risk every day.\n\n75\n00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,610\nAnd so, how do we do that?\n\n76\n00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,069\nCryptography, and the use of cryptography\nin networks to provide security.\n\n77\n00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,530\n[INAUDIBLE] Have been a lot of talk\nover the last couple of years about what\n\n78\n00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,565\nsecurity is, and is not, based on being\nable to look at people's email, or listen\n\n79\n00:03:56,565 --> 00:04:00,339\nto their phone calls, all sorts of things\nthat we may, or may not be aware of.\n\n80\n00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:01,064\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n81\n00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:03,691\nthe security practitioner\ntakes a look at that, and\n\n82\n00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:06,737\nfrom the practitioner perspective\nwould say to a business,\n\n83\n00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:10,310\nthis is what we need to do in order\nto implement a secure solution.\n\n84\n00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,210\nThese are the kind of\nalgorithms we may use, and\n\n85\n00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,900\nthese are the kind of cryptographic\nsolutions we may wanna put in place.\n\n86\n00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,950\nThese are the secure protocols\nthat we want to use.\n\n87\n00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,990\nFor networks, and communication,\nwe take a look at the bread, and\n\n88\n00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,660\nbutter of what a security\npractitioner does everyday.\n\n89\n00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,260\nWe think about the networks,\nthe telecommunications solutions that they\n\n90\n00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,720\ndeploy, whether they're wireless,\nor wired.\n\n91\n00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,297\nWhether they are looking at remote access,\nor people that work in an office,\n\n92\n00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:39,041\nthey're going to look at firewalls,\nwireless technology, all the things that\n\n93\n00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,804\nare associated with network access,\nreally top to bottom, across that stack.\n\n94\n00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:47,499\nAnd then we finish up with malicious code,\nand activity, one of my most\n\n95\n00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:52,290\nfavorite sections in the sense that I\ndo a lot of work around these areas.\n\n96\n00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,975\nIs to spend time talking about the things\nthat can go wrong in a system, And\n\n97\n00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,870\nunderstand how to identify them,\nand be aware of them.\n\n98\n00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,260\nSo that way we are able to zero in on the\nissues we have, and as a result hopefully,\n\n99\n00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,210\nidentify the problems with malware,\ntrojans, worms, anything that could go\n\n100\n00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,690\non with, not only transmissions of those,\nbut countermeasures associated with them.\n\n101\n00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,250\n>> So, those are our seven domains.\n\n102\n00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,500\nThese are the knowledge areas\nthat we need to focus in,\n\n103\n00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,028\nif we plan on getting\nthe SSCP certification.\n\n104\n00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,090\nSo Adam, and let's say that I look at\nthat list, and I say, you know what,\n\n105\n00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,320\nI'm an expert on all of that stuff.\n\n106\n00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,760\nI'm ready to take the exam today.\n\n107\n00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,030\nSo, what do I need to know about the exam?\n\n108\n00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,940\n>> So\nthe exam is gonna be computer-based today.\n\n109\n00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,631\nYears ago, if you were sitting for an exam\nfrom (ISC)2, they were paper-based exams.\n\n110\n00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:38,760\nThey were going to use a scantron bubble,\nand answer sheet, and\n\n111\n00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,190\nyou would sit for four hours for this,\nor three hours for this exam rather.\n\n112\n00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,850\nAnd it would have been 125 questions, and\nyou would have had to go through, and\n\n113\n00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,310\nwrite out all the answers by hand.\n\n114\n00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,850\nToday, they're computerized.\n\n115\n00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,085\nYou can go into a secure testing center,\nand you can take the exam.\n\n116\n00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:56,612\nIt is still 125 questions, you need to\nscore 700, or better in order to pass.\n\n117\n00:05:56,612 --> 00:06:00,737\nAnd you will need to make sure you have\nat least one year of proven experience in\n\n118\n00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:04,555\nthe field in one, or more of the seven\nareas we just identified for you.\n\n119\n00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:08,813\nThat you can document on your application,\nand then you're able to validate that\n\n120\n00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:13,005\nexperience through the application\nprocess after you take the exam.\n\n121\n00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,975\nAnd so, what happens is,\nyou go, and sit for the exam.\n\n122\n00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,185\nPass the exam.\n\n123\n00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:20,115\nThen you go through an application\nprocess through (ISC)2,\n\n124\n00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:21,607\nwhere you submit an application.\n\n125\n00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:26,200\nValidate your three-year resume, and your\ncredentials that you have the experience.\n\n126\n00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,350\nAnd then you're able to,\n\n127\n00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,070\nalong with the fee that you pay to apply,\nsend all that paperwork into (ISC)2.\n\n128\n00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,470\nThere's a small delay,\nwhile they go through the application.\n\n129\n00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,350\nYou may randomly,\nbe chosen to have an application audited.\n\n130\n00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,470\nIf you are, you may be asked some\nfollow up questions about 10%\n\n131\n00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,040\nof people on average get audited randomly.\n\n132\n00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,320\nBut more often than not, you simply\ngo through the application process.\n\n133\n00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,260\nWithin about a week, give, or\ntake depending on the time of the year,\n\n134\n00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,280\nyou hear back that you've been accepted\nas long as your credentials hold up, and\n\n135\n00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,170\neverything is validated on your resume.\n\n136\n00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,310\nAnd your granted in this\ncase the SSCP credential.\n\n137\n00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,030\nOnce your granted that credential,\n\n138\n00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,530\nyou will have a three-year cycle where\nyou are expected as a professional\n\n139\n00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,890\nin the field practicing your\ncraft to accrue CPE credits.\n\n140\n00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,720\nYou must do 40 credits a year in order to\nbe able to maintain your certification,\n\n141\n00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,430\n120 credits over a three-year cycle.\n\n142\n00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,970\nYou are then able to provide\ndocumentation about those credits through\n\n143\n00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,890\nan online portal, through the web.\n\n144\n00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,610\nYou submit them, and\nthen you pay your membership fees, and\n\n145\n00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,720\nrenew your certification on\na three-year cycle based on those fees.\n\n146\n00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,340\nAssuming you stay active, and you get\nyour CPEs, there is no re-certification\n\n147\n00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,390\nprocess at this point,\nmeaning you don't have to re-sir the exam.\n\n148\n00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,160\nHowever, if you let your certification\nlapse, if you don't stay active, you will\n\n149\n00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,570\nneed to re-sit the exam, so it's really\na question of what you choose to do.\n\n150\n00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,950\nBut there are professionals out there that\njust simply want to re-certify every three\n\n151\n00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,605\nyears, because they wanna prove they're\nstaying current on the technology,\n\n152\n00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:50,015\nand up to date with the knowledge.\n\n153\n00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,275\nSo, truly up to you at the end of the day.\n\n154\n00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,284\n>> Yeah, one thing I like to\nhighlight about this, (ISC)2,\n\n155\n00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:57,135\nthat they really stress having experience.\n\n156\n00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:59,415\nAnd Adam said it for the SSCP,\n\n157\n00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:05,145\nyou're really supposed to have the either\none-year of actual in field experience.\n\n158\n00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:07,900\nOr sometimes you hear\npeople say the equivalency.\n\n159\n00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,510\nWell, when you submit your\npaperwork to the (ISC)2,\n\n160\n00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,300\nyou show that you have to have\ndocumented one-year of experience.\n\n161\n00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,210\nIts not like CompTIA, or\nwhere it can be equivalent.\n\n162\n00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,580\nYou actually need to have that experience.\n\n163\n00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,140\nSo, this is a certification\nthat is designed for\n\n164\n00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,240\npeople that are already working\nin the security field, or\n\n165\n00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,200\nat least working with security\nrelated infrastructure, and equipment.\n\n166\n00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,930\nWhat if you don't?\n\n167\n00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,590\nIf you're one of those\npeople that doesn't?\n\n168\n00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,520\nIf you're just getting started, and you've\ndecided that security is the way to go,\n\n169\n00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,020\nthen SSCP is probably not\nthe certification for you right now.\n\n170\n00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,170\nInstead you should be looking to\nthings like CompTIA Security Plus.\n\n171\n00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,480\nWith Security Plus you get the base\nknowledge, it's actually a very similar,\n\n172\n00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,540\nnot as in depth, but\nvery similar to what we see here in SSCP.\n\n173\n00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,550\nBut it is designed for\npeople who maybe just starting out,\n\n174\n00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,520\nwho may not have any field experience.\n\n175\n00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,800\nBut if you're already working the field,\nand you're looking for\n\n176\n00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,910\na way to validate that knowledge\nSSCP is the certification to use.\n\n177\n00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,000\nThat's one thing I've\nalways like about (ISC)2,\n\n178\n00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,370\nlet's pull up these requirements again.\n\n179\n00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,280\nIt is you'll notice how they say,\nobtain the required experience, and\n\n180\n00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,990\nthen in your study for exam used\nthese optional educational tools.\n\n181\n00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,770\nIn other words, if you have all the field\nexperience, you don't need study tools.\n\n182\n00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,080\nYou can just go, and take the exam.\n\n183\n00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,680\nGo ahead, and have it.\n\n184\n00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,640\nBut if you work in it, but\nnot in all the areas, and you wanna\n\n185\n00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,215\nround off that information, that's where\nthings like our show come in handy.\n\n186\n00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:32,395\nThe official training, the textbooks,\nthe self-paced stuff that's out there.\n\n187\n00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:35,605\nAll those different things help to make\nsure you've got that base of knowledge to\n\n188\n00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:38,275\nbe ready, for what's on the exam.\n\n189\n00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,025\n>> One other thing we wanna\nmake sure you're aware of,\n\n190\n00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:42,900\nas well when you go through\nthe endorsement process,\n\n191\n00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,300\nthis idea of after you actually pass\nthe exam, the application process.\n\n192\n00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,520\nWe call it formally,\nthe endorsement process.\n\n193\n00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,150\nYou have a nine-month window,\n(ISC)2 gives you time,\n\n194\n00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,330\nin other words, after you pass the exam,\nin order to apply.\n\n195\n00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,458\nSo, while you wanna do\nit as soon as possible,\n\n196\n00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,680\nwe understand that there are needs\nto be a window where things happen,\n\n197\n00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,940\nyou're busy with work, or whatever.\n\n198\n00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,638\nAnd so, you're given a window where\nyou then, those scores are good.\n\n199\n00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,895\nBut they're good for\nup to nine months for you to apply.\n\n200\n00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,383\nYou don't wanna wait too long,\nbut you can go out, and\n\n201\n00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:13,525\nget your paperwork in order to get\nsomebody to formally endorse you,\n\n202\n00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,420\nmake sure you have the credential\ninformation in your resume.\n\n203\n00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,480\nYou need to validate your experience,\nthings of that nature.\n\n204\n00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,630\nSo, there is a window.\n\n205\n00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,050\nIt's not an immediate requirement,\nbut it is one you wanna be aware of.\n\n206\n00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,630\nAnd you do have the ability,\ntry get somebody in your business, or\n\n207\n00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,560\na peer, or colleague that you know,\nto do an endorsement for you.\n\n208\n00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,190\nIf they can speak to your experience,\nor if there's a sitting SSCP in good\n\n209\n00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,690\nstanding, meaning somebody who's already\ncertified, they can vouch for you,\n\n210\n00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,530\non your application.\n\n211\n00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,509\nIn effect, they do what's called an\nendorsement, and they can simply sign off\n\n212\n00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,543\non the application saying they've known\nyou, they know the kind of work you do.\n\n213\n00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:48,665\nAnd they are familiar with you,\nand are willing to stand up for\n\n214\n00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:52,100\nyou if asked, to validate that you\nshould be able to become an SSCP.\n\n215\n00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,439\nAnd by doing that, you then are able to\nvalidate the requirements we have listed\n\n216\n00:10:56,439 --> 00:11:01,100\nfor you rather, in terms of making sure\nthat you can validate your experience.\n\n217\n00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,510\nYou also will be required to subscribe\nto the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics.\n\n218\n00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,096\nMeaning, during your application process,\nyou have to agree to follow the Code\n\n219\n00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,693\nof Ethics that (ISC)2 has\npublished on their website.\n\n220\n00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:13,398\nYou may wanna go look at that website,\nat some point.\n\n221\n00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:16,278\nIt's, www.isc2.org,\n\n222\n00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:22,090\nI think Don's gonna bring\nit up while we're talking.\n\n223\n00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,675\nAnd so, making sure you're familiar\nwith what's on the website at all\n\n224\n00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:29,135\ntimes to get the most up to date\ncertification, information,\n\n225\n00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:31,965\nas well as understanding what's there for\nthe code of ethics,\n\n226\n00:11:31,965 --> 00:11:36,147\nis part of the requirement for being\nan SSCP, or any certified professional.\n\n227\n00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:39,187\nYou as a certified professional\nin any area, wanna\n\n228\n00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:42,447\ndo your due diligence generically, and\nunderstand the requirements of your field,\n\n229\n00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:45,097\nand make sure you're up to date\non the most recent information.\n\n230\n00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:47,963\nSo, do take a look at the website, you can\nsee it up on the screen as we're talking.\n\n231\n00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:49,637\nIt is gonna be important for you, and\n\n232\n00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:51,585\nthere is a link there\nto the code of ethics.\n\n233\n00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,420\nAnd you'll be able to follow it in order\nto be able to find out what is there,\n\n234\n00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,033\nand to make sure you understand\nthe requirements of being a certified\n\n235\n00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:57,676\nprofessional.\n\n236\n00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:01,209\n>> Yeah, and in fact, the little document\nthat I've brought up on the screen a few\n\n237\n00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,798\ntimes, this guy right here with\nthe overview, and all that information.\n\n238\n00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:06,947\nThat's right from (ISC)2's website,\n\n239\n00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:10,170\nif you goto credentials you'll\nsee the SSCP right there.\n\n240\n00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,120\nAnd if you go to about the SSCP, that\nit's right here, that you can come in,\n\n241\n00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,270\nand pull up the brochure.\n\n242\n00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,025\nWhere is it?\n\n243\n00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,224\n>> Right there- [CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh right there, scroll down.\n\n244\n00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,980\nSo you can find the SSCP\nbrochure right there.\n\n245\n00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,440\nYou can also get more\ndetailed information,\n\n246\n00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,920\nwhich we're gonna see as we go\nthrough the shows on the website.\n\n247\n00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,540\nTons of good information\nto be found there.\n\n248\n00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,240\nSo Adam, I think that pretty much\ncovers all the general stuff.\n\n249\n00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,567\nDo you have any other little bits that\nwe wantna throw out, before we wrap up?\n\n250\n00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:39,144\n>> Probably just to think about the fact,\nthat because this is\n\n251\n00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:42,560\na credential that is designed from\npractitioners, people that are hands on.\n\n252\n00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,032\nIf you're not comfortable with some of\nthe things we may be speaking about,\n\n253\n00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,420\nin terms of experience, and\nsome of the technology we've talked about.\n\n254\n00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,200\nThere are other course programs\nthat you can take a look at, so\n\n255\n00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,500\nyou wanna make sure you're thinking\nabout things like Security Plus.\n\n256\n00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,850\nYou've heard Don mention that.\n\n257\n00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,940\nMaybe some of the other A+, or\nNetwork Plus CompTIA content that will\n\n258\n00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,830\nhelp you with some of the background\ninformation, just to make sure you go\n\n259\n00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,550\nthrough a refresher, take a look at\nthat content, be familiar with it.\n\n260\n00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,830\nYeah, we all do a lot of this stuff\neveryday in our security practices,\n\n261\n00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,910\nif this is what you do for a living,\nbut it may have been a while since you\n\n262\n00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,620\ntouched the firewall,\nif that's not what you do everyday.\n\n263\n00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,752\nAnd so, just going back, and reviewing\nsome of the content to make sure you're\n\n264\n00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:21,157\ncomfortable with it,\nis really gonna be the key to success.\n\n265\n00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,970\nAnd we look forward to having\nthose conversations with you.\n\n266\n00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,537\n>> Yep.\n\n267\n00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:28,245\nAnd remember as an ITProTV subscriber,\nyou're not charged per class.\n\n268\n00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:29,005\nYou get it all.\n\n269\n00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:32,795\nSo, for the hands on experience, if you\nneed to brush up on that definitely,\n\n270\n00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:37,480\ncheck out some of the other shows like\nthe CCNA Security show for Cisco Security.\n\n271\n00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,360\nWe also have the Microsoft\n70-410 show that covers\n\n272\n00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,100\na little bit of security\nfunctions inside of Windows.\n\n273\n00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,480\nAnd there's a few other ones like Security\nPlus, that are security related too.\n\n274\n00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,250\nLot's of good information to\nbe found in all of those, and\n\n275\n00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,120\nyou can always just browse through, and\n\n276\n00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,920\nwatch individual episodes to find specific\ntopics that you're looking to brush up on.\n\n277\n00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,800\nWell, also keep in mind if you\never have any questions on this,\n\n278\n00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,732\nif you have a questions about\nthe SSCP certification in general.\n\n279\n00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:04,792\nYou're always welcome to use our Q&A\nsystem at the top of every ITProTV\n\n280\n00:14:04,792 -->

here.\n\n13\n00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,470\n[LAUGH]\nIt's funny,\n\n14\n00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,600\nwe've done several security shows,\nbut this one's really special.\n\n15\n00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,460\nWe're moving up to that next\ntier of certifications.\n\n16\n00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,420\nWe're moving beyond things\nlike security plus and\n\n17\n00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,920\ngetting into some of\nthe more challenging stuff.\n\n18\n00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,460\nWhere you really need somebody who has\nbeen out there in the field doing this\n\n19\n00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,540\nstuff, and doing it for a long time,\nand Adam, you are that man.\n\n20\n00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,390\nWe're gonna be jumping in here, taking\na look at all our various objectives as we\n\n21\n00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,120\nmove through, and\nget you guys ready for that exam.\n\n22\n00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,341\n>> How are we gonna do that?\n\n23\n00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,465\n>> Well, we might as well just\ndive right into it, right?\n\n24\n00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:33,800\n>> All right.\n\n25\n00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,620\n>> I'm frantically clicking\nin the background here,\n\n26\n00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,040\ntrying to find my objective list.\n\n27\n00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,140\nBut our first objective is\ngoing to be access controls and\n\n28\n00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,258\nis not what I'm displaying on the screen.\n\n29\n00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:48,300\n[LAUGH] It's gonna be access controls and\nso we need to take a look at those,\n\n30\n00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,830\nwhat they are, what they do and\nwhat we really need to know that.\n\n31\n00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,480\n>> Absolutely.\n\n32\n00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,590\nLet's talk a bit about that.\n\n33\n00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,490\nAnd let's start by defining\nwhat access controls are.\n\n34\n00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,660\nThe idea in the section that we're\ngonna go through with you is how do we,\n\n35\n00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,870\nas security practitioners, how do you,\nas security practitioners,\n\n36\n00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,960\nunderstand how to look at information,and\nunderstand who is accessing it,\n\n37\n00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,760\nwho has the rights to access, but\nalso who doesn't belong accessing it.\n\n38\n00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,350\nAnd the idea of access control\nis much like having a door\n\n39\n00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,230\nas you walk into a room right?\n\n40\n00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,290\nIf the door is open, you could potentially\nwalk through the door, see what's inside.\n\n41\n00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,620\nYou may walk by the door, and look in\neven though the door is not necessarily\n\n42\n00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,400\nblocking you from being able to enter the\nroom but you may be able to see inside.\n\n43\n00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,000\nBut you may not be able to see everything\ninside because maybe there are areas of\n\n44\n00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,660\nthe room that are not available\nto you just by walking by.\n\n45\n00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,150\nYou have to fully walk\ninto the room to see them.\n\n46\n00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,430\nSo the idea access control is how\nfar do we get with information,\n\n47\n00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,200\nwhat kind of requirements do we have for\nauthentication, authorization?\n\n48\n00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,140\nWho is the subject?\n\n49\n00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,960\nWhat is an object?\n\n50\n00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,150\nWe will talk, or what is the subject,\nwhat is an object?\n\n51\n00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,950\nWe will talk about these things\nas well and define these terms.\n\n52\n00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,873\nBut the goal is really to understand\nhow to allow only authorized users,\n\n53\n00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:59,923\nprograms or processes, whatever they are,\nwhatever we think of them as,\n\n54\n00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:03,845\nto access information in ways that\nwe can control, we can document, and\n\n55\n00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:07,960\nwe monitor and understand, both in real\ntime, and over time archivally and\n\n56\n00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,095\nrealistically, going back and\nlooking historically.\n\n57\n00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:13,757\nAnd what are those operations,\nwhat are those management procedures, and\n\n58\n00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:16,730\nwhat are those policies, those\nare the things we want to talk about.\n\n59\n00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,130\n>> Yeah, and access controls they're one\nof those things we use, all the time and\n\n60\n00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,740\nthe analogy I know I've used in other\nshows is like the locks on the front\n\n61\n00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,310\nof your house.\n\n62\n00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,000\nWhen I leave the house in the morning,\nI lock the door.\n\n63\n00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,830\nThat's an access control to my home.\n\n64\n00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,410\nNow that's a physical access control and\n\n65\n00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,970\nwe need to focus a little\nmore on logical because.\n\n66\n00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,480\nIn IT, there's only so\nmuch physical equipment we deal with.\n\n67\n00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,670\nMost of the things are logical services\nwe're providing to our customers and\n\n68\n00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,560\nso that's where we end\nup narrowing our focus.\n\n69\n00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,270\nWe don't wanna ignore\nthe physical access controls but\n\n70\n00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,940\nthe logical ones become more important.\n\n71\n00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,330\n>> Absolutely, and as Don pointed out,\nwe wanna have a balance of both,\n\n72\n00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,780\nwe wanna make sure we have a good\nrepresentation of both elements there.\n\n73\n00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,380\nSo, let's talk about some\nof the building blocks.\n\n74\n00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,760\nWhat are those things?\n\n75\n00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,430\nI mentioned subjects and\nobjects just a moment ago.\n\n76\n00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,830\nA subject is any entity,\nany thing that requires or\n\n77\n00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,540\nneeds a permission in\norder to access an object.\n\n78\n00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,890\nAnd an object is defined as the goal of\nthat access but ultimately it is data.\n\n79\n00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,050\nAnd if we think about, just very generic\nuser terms that we're very familiar with.\n\n80\n00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,910\nA subject is referred to\ntypically as a user, or\n\n81\n00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,310\na process, something that is\nlooking to access information.\n\n82\n00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,830\nAnd an object is that information,\n\n83\n00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,420\ntypically data in this case more often\nthan not that we're looking to access.\n\n84\n00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,780\nAnd then we talk about\nthings like authentication,\n\n85\n00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,910\nthe idea of being able to claim who\nyou are and really show, who you\n\n86\n00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,690\nare through the process of providing or\nproving your identity in some way.\n\n87\n00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,960\nSo verification, validation,\nproof of identity.\n\n88\n00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,130\nThis could be something like a username\nbeing provided when you log on,\n\n89\n00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,170\nit could be a pin, or\nsome sort of an access code typed\n\n90\n00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,560\ninto a system to enable you to\nbe able to access information.\n\n91\n00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,630\nIdentity, specifically identification,\n\n92\n00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,340\nis the idea of being able to claim your\nidentity to gain access to that resource.\n\n93\n00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:04,660\nAnd we talk about this idea of subjects\nbeing able to authorize and then access.\n\n94\n00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,760\nAnd so the idea is that a subject, a user,\n\n95\n00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,590\nauthorizes who they are by putting their\ninformation into a system, and then\n\n96\n00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,750\naccesses that information provided they\nhave the right credential after the fact.\n\n97\n00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,890\n>> Yeah and that username and\npassword model,\n\n98\n00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,900\nI know it's been breaking\ndown in recent years.\n\n99\n00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,790\nIt really should have broken\ndown a long time ago.\n\n100\n00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,960\nWe are seeing all sorts from tokens and\ncertificates and so\n\n101\n00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,780\nown, but there use is all the same.\n\n102\n00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,000\nWe're using them so that we verify\nsomebody is who they say they are, and\n\n103\n00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,570\nthen providing them the access\nthat's accorded to them.\n\n104\n00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:42,580\nAnd that all kind of falls under,\nwhat do we call it, the security triad.\n\n105\n00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,570\nRight the triple A.\n\n106\n00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,880\n>> The iron triangle,\nthe security triad or anything like that.\n\n107\n00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,690\nThere's all different ways\nof thinking about that.\n\n108\n00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,990\nBut authorization is\npart of that certainly.\n\n109\n00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,870\nBut the idea is really confidentiality,\nintegrity, and ultimately availability.\n\n110\n00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,740\nWhen we thing of EA, we think about\navailability not authorization.\n\n111\n00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,770\nBut when we think about confidentiality,\nkeeping information secure from prying\n\n112\n00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,440\neyes, protecting it, not letting people\nsee it unless they have the ability to.\n\n113\n00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,820\nThis is where authorization comes in,\n\n114\n00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,550\nthis is where access control\nstarts to become important.\n\n115\n00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,450\nWe have integrity.\n\n116\n00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,750\nIntegrity is the ability to be\nable to validate who you are,\n\n117\n00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,940\nto make sure that you really\nare the person that sent information or\n\n118\n00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,320\ncreated information in a system, and there\nis no question about the authenticity of\n\n119\n00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,440\nthat information on the origination\nof that information.\n\n120\n00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,570\nAnd then we have availability.\n\n121\n00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,820\nAvailability's all about making sure\ninformation is there when people need it,\n\n122\n00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,250\nbut only referencing confidentiality\nwhen they have the requirements in\n\n123\n00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,000\nplace to be able to prove who they are,\njust be aware of that and\n\n124\n00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,140\nmake sure you're thinking of that.\n\n125\n00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,650\nBut we talked about the CIA,\nConfidentiality, Integrity and\n\n126\n00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,780\nAvailability triangle\nthat we are looking at.\n\n127\n00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,000\nSome of the access control challenges\nthat we want to be able to think about.\n\n128\n00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,280\nAre going to be things, and\nwe talked about a couple of these already,\n\n129\n00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,240\nwe talked about things like a door lock,\nand having a front door, and\n\n130\n00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,840\nbeing able to get into a building.\n\n131\n00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,280\nPhysical access, right?\n\n132\n00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,400\nHow do people get in,\ndo we monitor them coming in,\n\n133\n00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,730\nare there cameras available to you?\n\n134\n00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,900\nThings like that.\n\n135\n00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,390\nI think accounting is spelled with a u,\nbut you're close.\n\n136\n00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,070\n>> Accointing.\n\n137\n00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,085\n>> Accointing, as opposed to accounting.\n\n138\n00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:14,140\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> There you go.\n\n139\n00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,790\nAre we going through and are we keeping\nan eye on people as they walk around and\n\n140\n00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,510\ndoing things like that, and\nthere's a variety of ways to do that.\n\n141\n00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,180\nWhat about things like loss of laptops or\ntablets.\n\n142\n00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,810\nWe're using computers, to talk to you and\nwe have all sorts of infrastructure,\n\n143\n00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,690\nmobile phones, things of that nature.\n\n144\n00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,970\nWhat happens if that\ninformation disappears?\n\n145\n00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,170\nIf somebody grabs that while you're\ngoing through a security check point.\n\n146\n00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,240\nIs your hard drive secure?\n\n147\n00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,685\nIs it gonna be encrypted?\n\n148\n00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,985\nAnd if so,\nwhat kind of an encryption do you use.\n\n149\n00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:41,535\nWhat kind of hardware and\nsoftware is being used by you and\n\n150\n00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,685\nby others as they access your information?\n\n151\n00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:44,530\nIs there malware?\n\n152\n00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,330\nSoftware that may inadvertently or\n\n153\n00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,215\non purpose access information\nwithout authorization.\n\n154\n00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:50,411\nAnd is that available?\n\n155\n00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:53,371\nDevice encryption, as you see up\non the list there is important.\n\n156\n00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:55,432\nWhat about object reuse,\nmedia reuse, right?\n\n157\n00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:59,128\nSo if we use a thumb drive, or\nif we use some sort of a solution that\n\n158\n00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:04,150\nstores information, wipe it clean,\ngive it to somebody else, let them use it.\n\n159\n00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,430\nIs there information left on the device?\n\n160\n00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,450\nIs there software there,\nas we just talked about,\n\n161\n00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,830\nthat could potentially prove\nto be a security challenge?\n\n162\n00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,440\nHow do we deal with those things?\n\n163\n00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,360\nEmanation, information and\n\n164\n00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,220\nthe electronic sources that come out of\na computer can exit in a variety of ways.\n\n165\n00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,430\nSo we could email information but\nwe also electronically bleed information\n\n166\n00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,320\nout of our systems even though we\nmay not be thinking about it and\n\n167\n00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,210\nas a result of that, if somebody gets to\nclose to a computer, they potentially\n\n168\n00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,840\ncould see that information even\nthough we may not want them to.\n\n169\n00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,450\nAnd so things like blue jacking,\nblue scarfing,\n\n170\n00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,110\nall these attacks we think about\nthat are prevalent today, and\n\n171\n00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,720\nwe'll talk about what some of these\nare as we go through things but\n\n172\n00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,150\nbeing able to get close to somebody and\nread information from credit cards,\n\n173\n00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,460\nfrom bluetooth enabled devices,\neven just from a computer monitor are very\n\n174\n00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,520\nbig things we have to worry about with\naccess control communication, on the wire.\n\n175\n00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,000\nCan we sniff that information?\n\n176\n00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,570\nCan we grab it out of the air?\n\n177\n00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,110\nOr through a signal, and unencrypted,\nor if it's in the clear, can we read it?\n\n178\n00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,330\nWe've heard a lot about the things that\nhave gone on in the last several years\n\n179\n00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,870\nwith these kind of security issues, right?\n\n180\n00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,280\nAll the rage to be talking about\nall the information that may or\n\n181\n00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,780\nmay not be encrypted, and who may or\nmay not be able to read it and see it.\n\n182\n00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,330\nSo the general rule of thumb is to\nunderstand how to deal with those\n\n183\n00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,330\nkind of things.\n\n184\n00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,800\nNetworks, are networks protected?\n\n185\n00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,660\nPhysically when we cable into a connection\nsomewhere is that switch, that router,\n\n186\n00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,550\nwhatever we may be connecting to.\n\n187\n00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,370\nThat access plate on the wall.\n\n188\n00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,700\nIs there physical protection as well\nas logical protection involved there?\n\n189\n00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,920\nThese are all the challenges we have\nto think about and the software we run.\n\n190\n00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,830\nWhat about applications\nrunning on our desktops?\n\n191\n00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,640\nWe often download software, and\nrun software that we may or\n\n192\n00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,550\nmay not be thinking about in terms\nof being a security issue for us but\n\n193\n00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,070\nthat new downloads you get, that new game\nyou may be taking on, that new video.\n\n194\n00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:50,610\nWhatever it is right from YouTube or\nfrom the icloud or wherever you\n\n195\n00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,540\nmight go get that stuff from or one\ndrive or whoever gives you access today.\n\n196\n00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,670\nYou know I'm always being asked\nhey can you throw something out in\n\n197\n00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,190\nthe cloud for me.\n\n198\n00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,429\nCan I go get it and share it?\n\n199\n00:09:58,429 --> 00:09:59,901\nSo maybe it's too big to email.\n\n200\n00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:01,780\nYou really have to be careful\nabout these kind of things.\n\n201\n00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,800\nYou have to know where it's coming from,\nwho it's going to, and\n\n202\n00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,970\nmake sure you're providing access control\naround that whole pathway, right.\n\n203\n00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,350\nSo these are some of the challenges\nwe wanna think about.\n\n204\n00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,010\n>> Absolutely.\n\n205\n00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,980\nAnd that becomes even more of a big deal,\nlike you said,\n\n206\n00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,900\nwhen you bring the crowd into the picture.\n\n207\n00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,880\nIf you are, in the old days, if you were\ntransmitting something directly from you\n\n208\n00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,350\nto that other person, then you could\ncontrol a lot of that access, but\n\n209\n00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,960\nnow we're more and\nmore starting to use intermediaries.\n\n210\n00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,090\nThings like Dropbox, and Google Drive,\n\n211\n00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,600\nand iCloud, and whatever,\nand you're putting your\n\n212\n00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,650\ntrust in these other services that they're\ntaking the steps to protect your data.\n\n213\n00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,960\nSometimes they are,\nsometimes they aren't, right?\n\n214\n00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,080\nSo if you're dealing with extremely\nsensitive data, you may not be able to\n\n215\n00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,030\nguarantee access control across the entire\npath that that data is going to flow, and\n\n216\n00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,860\nso that may not be a viable solution for\nyou.\n\n217\n00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,550\nPublic services, like Google Drive,\n\n218\n00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,540\nmay not be acceptable in your environment,\nyou need to create your own.\n\n219\n00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,540\nAnd it is important to\nthink about the standards.\n\n220\n00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,220\nAnd that's really what Don's addressing\nis what are the business standards,\n\n221\n00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,620\nwhat are the requirements that\nthe business may put in place or you,\n\n222\n00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,490\nas a security professional,\nhave to educate the business about and\n\n223\n00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,950\nhelp them to realize they need to put\nin place around information security.\n\n224\n00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,930\nAnd we get into things like policies,\nstandards, guidelines and\n\n225\n00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,130\nprocedures to really address these kinds\nof concerns and wanna make sure we\n\n226\n00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,490\nunderstand where those things fall on the\ninformation security management continuum.\n\n227\n00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,490\nBut dealing with this idea that\na business will just automatically know\n\n228\n00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,410\nthat they should secure certain things Is\nreally an urban myth and urban legend.\n\n229\n00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,120\nRight?\nIt's this misnomer we often have\n\n230\n00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,760\nin security, where we just assume\nthat because it's important,\n\n231\n00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,970\neverybody gets that it's important and\nas a result everybody understands, right,\n\n232\n00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,490\nthat they should take it as seriously\nas perhaps we do or other people do.\n\n233\n00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,330\nBut we see time and again, just through\nanecdotal evidence and hard fact,\n\n234\n00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,950\nas we look at breaches and we look at\nsecurity issues that pop up in the media\n\n235\n00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,760\nThat retailers big and small,\nbusinesses big and small,\n\n236\n00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,770\ngovernments that should know\nbetter all have security lapses.\n\n237\n00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,570\nAnd it starts with what we as individuals,\njust normal, average,\n\n238\n00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,160\neveryday people think about security and\nit really starts with awareness and\n\n239\n00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,960\nthis idea of being aware\nof your surroundings.\n\n240\n00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,350\nIn the military,\nwe call it situational awareness.\n\n241\n00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,470\nThe general idea that if something's going\non around you, you have to be aware of\n\n242\n00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,220\nwhat that impact is and potentially\nunderstand what that represents to you,\n\n243\n00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,460\nand then all those that come into\nthat circle of interaction with you.\n\n244\n00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,570\nAnd if they don't know that,\nthey have to be educated.\n\n245\n00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,890\nAnd so everything good in security starts\nwith security awareness training, or\n\n246\n00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,610\nmore broadly just training and awareness\nof what you have to do as a good corporate\n\n247\n00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,170\ncitizen to access information and from\nthere we're then able to really go out and\n\n248\n00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,900\ntalk about all the things that\nget layered on top right.\n\n249\n00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,440\n>> Now when I think of\naccess controls right,\n\n250\n00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,020\nI immediately jump right here to B which\nis implement logical access controls in\n\n251\n00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,580\nterms of objects right that we\nare controlling access to, files, folders,\n\n252\n00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,840\nprinters, data, databases, you know, that\nkind of information that's on our system.\n\n253\n00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,070\nThen it's easy to kinda get\nthat tunnel vision, right?\n\n254\n00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,660\nBut ISC Squared, they're calling out\naccess control in terms of subject.\n\n255\n00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,040\nNow how does that differ\nfrom that of objects?\n\n256\n00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,180\n>> Sure.\nSo when we define\n\n257\n00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,760\nthe ideas of subjects and\nobjects a few minutes ago,\n\n258\n00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,770\nwe talked about the idea that\na subject is basically a user, right?\n\n259\n00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,220\nSo, it's either a user or a process.\n\n260\n00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,340\nIn our world we can think of\nusers as being you and I,\n\n261\n00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,990\nwe're users but there may be\na process that we engage in or\n\n262\n00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,970\nthat we ask a computer to engage on\nour behalf to access information.\n\n263\n00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,030\nAnd so, for instance, Don was mentioning\nSkyDrive or now OneDrive or Google Drive,\n\n264\n00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,821\nright, a few minutes ago.\n\n265\n00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:31,630\n>> [LAUGH] They renamed it.\n\n266\n00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,660\n>> Because now it's been rebranded,\nso it's now OneDrive.\n\n267\n00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,990\nBut the idea is if we go out and we try\nto access the cloud to get information,\n\n268\n00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,530\nwe have to authenticate, but then there is\na computer driven process that reaches out\n\n269\n00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,450\nto the cloud, passes our credential along,\nand then effectively proxies or\n\n270\n00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,920\ninterprets our access requests and\nacts on our behalf.\n\n271\n00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,170\nAnd so we talk about subjects being\nboth objects and or processes.\n\n272\n00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,430\nExcuse me, subjects being users and\nor processes, and\n\n273\n00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,020\nobjects being the data that we\nare focused on trying to get a hold of.\n\n274\n00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,330\nSo when we talk about logical access\ncontrols in relation to subjects,\n\n275\n00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,850\nwe're looking at controls that\nare focused on the user and\n\n276\n00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,250\nthe process acting on behalf of the user.\n\n277\n00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,160\nWhereas when we talk about subjects\ninteracting and then we talk about what we\n\n278\n00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,000\ninteract with the object, we look at\naccess controls on the data itself,\n\n279\n00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,580\nthe point of interaction,\nwhatever that particular item may be.\n\n280\n00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,400\n>> And, so these are typical tools of\nthe trade that we're going to be using.\n\n281\n00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,110\nAnd they do vary depending on your\nenvironment, depending on your systems,\n\n282\n00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,121\nthe requirements of your organization.\n\n283\n00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,320\nSo, for example, here in\nthe United States, for our US viewers,\n\n284\n00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,923\nif you work for a medical institution,\nthen you will have HIPAA compliance\n\n285\n00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:42,950\nthat you will have to adhere to because\nyou're dealing with medical information.\n\n286\n00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,190\nIf you're in the financial industry,\nyou'll have things like Sarbanes-Oxley and\n\n287\n00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,120\nthat's where the government\nis specifically\n\n288\n00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,428\ntelling you some of the access controls\nthat you have to have in place.\n\n289\n00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:54,350\nIt's a double-edged sword, right?\n\n290\n00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,340\nOn one hand, it's tough to make\nsure you meet those standards.\n\n291\n00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,840\nOn the other hand,\nit's kinda nice to have somebody say,\n\n292\n00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,760\nhere's exactly what you need.\n\n293\n00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,100\nRight, you don't have to kind\nof invent this yourself.\n\n294\n00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,650\nThey are giving you those requirements or\nguidelines or standards or policies or\n\n295\n00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,780\nwhatever it is that they give you.\n\n296\n00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,570\nAll right.\n\n297\n00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,680\nBut what if you're not in\none of those industries.\n\n298\n00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,250\nIf you are, let's say you are us,\nITProTV, right.\n\n299\n00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,230\nThere's no government regulation on how\nwe have to preserve and protect our data.\n\n300\n00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,670\nSo what do we do?\n\n301\n00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,920\nWell, you need to evaluate your\norganization and find out what.\n\n302\n00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,540\nWhat you view as certain\nlevel of protection, or\n\n303\n00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,170\nrequirements that you have for\nthat access control, right?\n\n304\n00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,330\nAnd I say that, you know,\nwe don't necessarily fall under any\n\n305\n00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,980\ngovernment standards, but\nwe do have our access controls.\n\n306\n00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,970\nYou know, that we want our viewers,\nviewers like you, now I sound like PBS.\n\n307\n00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,595\nBrought to you by viewers like you.\n\n308\n00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:43,462\nWe want viewers like you to be\nable to watch our episodes, but\n\n309\n00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:46,329\nwe don't want just anybody on\nthe internet to be able to go and\n\n310\n00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:49,758\ngrab those episodes so we have access\ncontrols in place that make it where\n\n311\n00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:53,500\nour subscribers get access to all\nthe episodes, our non subscribers don't.\n\n312\n00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,806\nEverybody gets the live feed.\n\n313\n00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:58,866\nThat's an example of an access control\nwhere we're securing our video data and\n\n314\n00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:02,980\ncontrolling the subjects,\nthe users who able to access it, right?\n\n315\n00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,160\n>> Absolutely, and since to that end,\n\n316\n00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,960\nlet's talk about the types of access\ncontrols that actually exist.\n\n317\n00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,430\nBecause we have categories and\n\n318\n00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,380\nunderstanding the categories helps us to\nbetter understand the way in which we\n\n319\n00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,520\nfocus the control and\nthe point of reference being.\n\n320\n00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,370\nIs it the object, is it the subject,\nwhere do we go, what are we focus on?\n\n321\n00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,040\nSo have preventative controls,\nthese are categories.\n\n322\n00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,880\nAnd preventative controls protect\nvulnerabilities from being exploited.\n\n323\n00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,787\nSo, they will for instance be something\nlike doing Windows Update on a Windows\n\n324\n00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:34,130\nbased, or Intel based PC where\nyou download security patches and\n\n325\n00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,080\napply them some sort of order based on\nthe vendor telling you this patch for\n\n326\n00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,150\nthis particular software if you run it,\nthat is a preventative control.\n\n327\n00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,360\nA door lock could be a preventative\ncontrol, because a door lock,\n\n328\n00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,040\nif used properly, will keep people\nout of areas that need to be secured,\n\n329\n00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,070\nmaybe there's dangerous chemicals,\nor electrical conduits, or\n\n330\n00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,180\nthings that you may not wanna go near.\n\n331\n00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,830\nThat kinda stuff is\na preventative control.\n\n332\n00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,460\nA deterrent control will discourage\nunauthorized activities with warnings.\n\n333\n00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,370\nSo it could be something like\na log on a message that comes up\n\n334\n00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,820\non the screen right before you\nactually enter your credentials, and\n\n335\n00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,140\nit says, hey this particular area\nthat you're going into has these\n\n336\n00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,580\nrequirements associated with it if you're\nnot gonna abide by these requirements,\n\n337\n00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,020\nyou shouldn't be accessing\nthis information.\n\n338\n00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,950\nCould be a sign on a gate before\nyou drive through that says,\n\n339\n00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,210\nunder 24-hour video surveillance or\ngovernment property.\n\n340\n00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,700\nYou have to follow these rules,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n341\n00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,980\nA detective control provides\ninformation about a past or\n\n342\n00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,860\npresent attack of some kind.\n\n343\n00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,630\nSo these would be things like\nlooking at logs for instance,\n\n344\n00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,800\nand maybe going in and writing stuff\ndown or having a log file that tracks\n\n345\n00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,110\ninformation that we can historically\nrefer to ,but also real time monitoring.\n\n346\n00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,350\nSo things like IPS's or IDS's intrusion\nprevention or intrusion detection system,\n\n347\n00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,590\nbut real time monitoring would\nalso fall into this category.\n\n348\n00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,570\nAnd then corrective and\nrecovery, controls, excuse me,\n\n349\n00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,640\nthese are gonna be the kind of controls\ntogether as a category corrective and\n\n350\n00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,230\nrecovery that are going to have\ncountermeasures associated with them.\n\n351\n00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,140\nWe actively go out and take\ncountermeasures to reduce the risk of some\n\n352\n00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,410\nsort of an access being violated or some\nsort of an access control being broken,\n\n353\n00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,020\nand object access being granted to\nsubjects that don't belong there, so\n\n354\n00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,680\nI mention intrusion protection and\nintrusion prevention just a minute ago.\n\n355\n00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,550\nIntrusion prevention systems, IPSs which\nare actively able to go out and reorient\n\n356\n00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,530\nthemselves and take corrective action\nwould also fall under this category.\n\n357\n00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,100\nIf they're reacting to a breach as\nopposed to just monitoring passively,\n\n358\n00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,640\nthe way an IDS might.\n\n359\n00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,150\nSo when they are reacting,\nwe would consider them a corrective and\n\n360\n00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,920\nrecovery control.\n\n361\n00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,470\nBut any of those kinds of things,\nmaybe the ability for\n\n362\n00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,395\na first responder to get an alert and\nbe told in a knock in\n\n363\n00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:49,935\nan operational environment where they're\nmonitoring that, there's been a breech and\n\n364\n00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:53,755\nthen they can pull up information and\nunderstand what's happening and reorient\n\n365\n00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:57,310\nthe network would be an example of\na corrective and recovery control as well.\n\n366\n00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,630\nSo these are the main types of access\ncontrols that we deal with and\n\n367\n00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,392\nwe think about in terms\nof those categories.\n\n368\n00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:07,400\n>> All right, so understanding\nthe access controls that's a big deal,\n\n369\n00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,620\nunderstanding the concepts around them,\nthere is a bit of a practical side to\n\n370\n00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,110\nthis too right actually implementing\nthose security controls.\n\n371\n00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,600\nAnd that's where like with the SSCP,\nthey want you to have that one year of\n\n372\n00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,920\nexperience out in the field, not just\nunderstanding the concept of what these\n\n373\n00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:29,400\ncontrols are but actually how to implement\nthem, and for us in the SSCP show here\n\n374\n00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,730\nwe're not going to dive too deep into that\nbut we'll show some examples as we go.\n\n375\n00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,320\nBut for the most part if you\nwant to get some really good,\n\n376\n00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,540\nin depth like actual practical how to\nimplement this access control or whatever.\n\n377\n00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,000\nI encourage you guys to jump over and\n\n378\n00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,170\ncheck out some of the other shows like\nthe, I know the CCNA security show for\n\n379\n00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,790\nexample, has some great stuff in there on\naccess control lists, and even IPS and\n\n380\n00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,690\nIDS is covered in depth over there as\nwell as the 7410, Windows Server 2012,\n\n381\n00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,470\nthe show does access control list,\nas far as file and folder access.\n\n382\n00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,780\nSo, you'll see a lot of these same themes,\n\n383\n00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,180\nthese concepts implemented in\npractical measures in the other show.\n\n384\n00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,850\nSo, definitely make sure you use\nthat resource, cuz it's there and\n\n385\n00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,300\nit's available for you.\n\n386\n00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,630\n>> Very good point, and\nwhen we talked about the types or\n\n387\n00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,560\nthe categories of controls\nwe were just talking about.\n\n388\n00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,850\nI want to also talk about one other thing,\nwhich is the way in which we implement and\n\n389\n00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,790\nwe think about implementing.\n\n390\n00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,410\nWe gave you some examples of these and\njust talked a little bit about them, but\n\n391\n00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,950\nthe idea is that we want to think of\nthe ability to be able to have different\n\n392\n00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,440\nways of approaching implementation.\n\n393\n00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,840\nAnd so we talk about\nadministrative implementation.\n\n394\n00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,020\nWe talk about logical or\n\n395\n00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,200\ntechnical areas where we can focus on\nhardware versus software, for instance.\n\n396\n00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,870\nSo in an administrative area, we would be\nthinking about policies, procedures, and\n\n397\n00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,380\nprobably those kinds of things\nthat we were just talking about\n\n398\n00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,050\nwould fall under administrative.\n\n399\n00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,860\nWhen we think about logical,\nand or logical technical,\n\n400\n00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,660\nbecause we tend to group them together,\nwe think about control areas or\n\n401\n00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,750\nimplementation areas around controls\nthat deal with hardware and software.\n\n402\n00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,780\nAnd so we think about things as Don was\njust mentioning like operating system\n\n403\n00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,890\nsecurity, right?\n\n404\n00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,630\nAnd Windows, for instance, had me set up\na permissions structure on a folder or\n\n405\n00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,820\na directory to allow or\nnot allow access based on inheritance.\n\n406\n00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,220\nThings like that would be\nsoftware based controls, or\n\n407\n00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,159\nlogical integrity [INAUDIBLE] software.\n\n408\n00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,782\nAnd then physical, we talked about things\nlike door locks and video monitoring,\n\n409\n00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:23,601\nall sorts of things like that,\naccess control gates and card keys,\n\n410\n00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:26,683\nall of those things fall\nunder physical policy areas,\n\n411\n00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:30,910\nor physical implementation areas\nthat we wanna be thinking about.\n\n412\n00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,050\nAnd so, this idea leads to this concept of\ndefense and depth, of really layering in.\n\n413\n00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,890\nThese different solutions, these different\nmenu items in effect if you want to think\n\n414\n00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,340\nof them that way that we can pull up and\nput together in some sort of a way\n\n415\n00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,710\nas a security practitioner, this will be\none of the things you have to focus on\n\n416\n00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,490\nwhen you go out and do this you know\nin production right in the enterprise.\n\n417\n00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,000\nSomewhere in the real world.\n\n418\n00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,160\nWhen you're doing these things,\nyou want to build the layered defense or\n\n419\n00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,310\ndefense in depth model for your enterprise\nthat helps you as the practitioner,\n\n420\n00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,940\nthe person in charge of security,\nto understand that somebody may be able\n\n421\n00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,100\nto get in and break through one or\nmore of these controls, right?\n\n422\n00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,030\nSomebody may find a key and\nbe able to make a copy of it, and\n\n423\n00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,880\nopen that first lock on the door.\n\n424\n00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,700\nThey may be able to get past that\nguard by faking an ID, right?\n\n425\n00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,960\nProbably have all done that when we\nwere younger and shouldn't have,\n\n426\n00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,410\nbut we're able to get in and\ndo those things, right?\n\n427\n00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,170\nWe're also maybe able to get a username or\na password.\n\n428\n00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,640\nBut if we can have structure that allows\nus to see that these things overlap,\n\n429\n00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,870\nand they shouldn't just be\nisolated in themselves, but\n\n430\n00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:35,300\nrather part of a more holistic solution,\na system of access control,\n\n431\n00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,110\nwe may be able to break through one, but\nthe likelihood of us breaking through\n\n432\n00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,820\nthree or four of those controls\nsimultaneously is usually very low.\n\n433\n00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,550\nAnd so a well designed system is\none that overlaps, or overlays,\n\n434\n00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,310\nmultiple controls together\nin these categories.\n\n435\n00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,300\n>> The other thing is that you don't\nnecessarily know where your attacker is\n\n436\n00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,180\ngoing to be coming from.\n\n437\n00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,440\nSo take for example, firewalls,\nthere's many organizations where they have\n\n438\n00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,350\na firewall between their local area\nnetwork and the internet, right?\n\n439\n00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,350\nAnd then they may decide to go ahead and\n\n440\n00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,760\nturn off the firewalls\non internal systems,\n\n441\n00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,160\nbecause they've already got a physical\nfirewall in between them and the internet.\n\n442\n00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,600\nWell, that's fine for\nthe outside attacker.\n\n443\n00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480\nThe outside attacker's got to pass\nthrough that outside firewall.\n\n444\n00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,070\nBut what if the attacker is a malicious\nemployee inside of your organization?\n\n445\n00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,840\nThey're already behind the firewall,\n\n446\n00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,130\nthey're already past that\nfirst layer of defense.\n\n447\n00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,870\nSo having additional firewalls,\nlike software firewalls running on your\n\n448\n00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,430\nindividual machines,\nthat gives a second layer of firewalls.\n\n449\n00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,059\nThat means somebody from the outside, and\n\n450\n00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:31,511\nthe outside would have to break\nthrough two layers now to get in.\n\n451\n00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:35,799\nBut somebody on the inside has already\npassed one is still being isolated by that\n\n452\n00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,127\nsecond layer so multi-tiered defense and\ndefense in depth,\n\n453\n00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,136\nit's a term that's been around for\na long, long time.\n\n454\n00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:46,223\nBut it goes back to that old adage of\na chain is only as strong as the weakest\n\n455\n00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:50,981\nlink, so when you build up your security\nmodel, if you've got areas in your network\n\n456\n00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:54,666\nthat you have not secured at all,\nthat's your weakest link, and\n\n457\n00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,115\nit could invalidate the security\nEven from in other places.\n\n458\n00:23:58,115 --> 00:23:59,797\n>> Absolutely, so remember,\nyou don't wanna be the weakest link.\n\n459\n00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:00,697\nRight, that's important.\n\n460\n00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:01,560\nDon't be that guy.\n\n461\n00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,240\nAll right?\n\n462\n00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,610\nDon't be that guy.\n\n463\n00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,880\nWhen we talk about access control,\nright, we also talk about concepts,\n\n464\n00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,980\nand we're gonna get a little bit into,\njust at a high level, right, what access\n\n465\n00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,270\ncontrol models look like, discretionary\nversus mandatory, for instance.\n\n466\n00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,280\nWe're not gonna spend too much time\nreally educating you on the nuts and\n\n467\n00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,550\nbolts of this in this\nparticular discussion.\n\n468\n00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,640\nAs Don referenced, you can find that\nmaterial in some of the other programs\n\n469\n00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,940\nthat are probably better suited to\ndeal with the actual deep dive because\n\n470\n00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,170\nthat's really appropriate for\nthat level of material.\n\n471\n00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,030\nBut we wanna make you aware of it here.\n\n472\n00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,460\nAnd so the idea of discretionary access\ncontrol as a model, what we call DAC,\n\n473\n00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,848\nis this idea that we're probably\nvery familiar with in Windows.\n\n474\n00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:40,850\nOr any wintel-based system where we\nhave a user, we have a group, and\n\n475\n00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,450\nwe have a model that allows users to be\ngiven permission through inheritance.\n\n476\n00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,660\nThat's a discretionary\naccess control model,\n\n477\n00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,110\nwe also have mandatory access control,\nwhat we call MAC, M-A-C D.\n\n478\n00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:56,060\nThe mandatory control access model\nimplies that the owner of the data,\n\n479\n00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:02,050\nwill mandate who has access and then that\nsystem will enforce that access control.\n\n480\n00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,640\nWe wanna make sure that\nbasically we classify data, and\n\n481\n00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,840\nthat classification is done by the object\nowner, the data owner as I just mentioned.\n\n482\n00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,120\nData may be classified\nas secret top secret,\n\n483\n00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,340\neyes only, whatever you may be\nthinking about, in that model.\n\n484\n00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,250\nAnd that the key criteria,\nthe key to finding criteria for\n\n485\n00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,270\nMAC is that data classification\nimposed on the model by the owner,\n\n486\n00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,730\nright, by the object owner.\n\n487\n00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,350\nThe owner of the data itself,\njust be aware of that.\n\n488\n00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,100\nThat's important.\n\n489\n00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,186\nAnd then we have what's\ncalled non-discretionary.\n\n490\n00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:39,600\nNon-discretionary is sometimes referred\nto as role or task based access control.\n\n491\n00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,310\nThis is the idea where basically\naccess control is closely monitored,\n\n492\n00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,450\nby a security administrator or\nby the system admin, whoever does that.\n\n493\n00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,960\nBut you're given the job,\nyou're the back up administrator.\n\n494\n00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,580\nYou are the person who does file access\nand controls access to certain files.\n\n495\n00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,210\nThat's a non-discretionary and\ntask or role based model.\n\n496\n00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,710\nAnd then we have other models that we\nwant to talk about a little bit as well.\n\n497\n00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,460\nThings like BIBA, Clark-Wilson,\nand Bell La Pagella,\n\n498\n00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,950\nthese are access control models that\nwere created by one or more people.\n\n499\n00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,900\nTypically they're named after\nthe people that they were created by.\n\n500\n00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,180\nA lot of them are mathematicians,\nbecause a lot of this has to do with\n\n501\n00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,960\nthe complicated math of access control,\nin terms of using algorithms and\n\n502\n00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,430\nfiguring out how to come up\nwith ways to secure data.\n\n503\n00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,840\nBut these traditional models\ndescribe access control, and\n\n504\n00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,220\nreally focus on the preservation of\nconfidentiality and/or integrity.\n\n505\n00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,070\nAnd so we focus on those key\nterms that we spoke about.\n\n506\n00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,660\nAnd their important for\nthe CCSP to be aware of but for an CCSP,\n\n507\n00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,330\nyou're not gonna be asked to know the nuts\nand bolts and the very, very detailed\n\n508\n00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,640\nspecifics of some of these models,\nthe way for instance maybe a CISSP would.\n\n509\n00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,429\nWhere it's a little bit higher level and\n\n510\n00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:53,699\nyou have to understand more of the\nbackground as well as the actual how to.\n\n511\n00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:56,130\nJust to think about that.\n\n512\n00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,090\n>> I'm not familiar with those\nones that you just read.\n\n513\n00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,030\nWhat were those again?\n\n514\n00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,010\nLet me write them on the notes, here.\n\n515\n00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:00,760\n>> Sure, absolutely.\n\n516\n00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,010\nWe have BIBA, which is B-I-B-A,\nit's the name of one of the models.\n\n517\n00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,410\nWe have Clark Wilson,\n\n518\n00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,850\nwhich is just the last names of\nthe two people that were involved.\n\n519\n00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,053\nClark Wilson, and\nthen you have Bell LaPadula, and\n\n520\n00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:21,976\nBell LaPadula,\nL-A-P-A-D-U-L-A, there you go.\n\n521\n00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:24,280\nSo Bell LaPadula is the name\nof another one of the models.\n\n522\n00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,130\nAnd again these are the name of the people\nthat actually came up with them, and\n\n523\n00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,890\nin the case of Biba and\nBell LaPadula and also Clark Wilson.\n\n524\n00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,840\nWe're talking about axis control models,\nthat are going to be focused on\n\n525\n00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,470\neither confidentiality and/or integrity,\nreally focusing on one or\n\n526\n00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,670\nboth of those depending on the nature\nof the model and what it is, and\n\n527\n00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,280\nso, wanna make sure we just have\na thought process around that as well.\n\n528\n00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,920\nOne other thing I just\nwanted to point out for\n\n529\n00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,440\nthe SSEP potential candidates out\nthere that are listening to us and\n\n530\n00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,550\nare, that'd be interested\nin going through this.\n\n531\n00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,060\nThe idea behind getting ready for\n\n532\n00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,860\nthe exam is really about making\nsure you're studying the material,\n\n533\n00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,060\nunderstanding the concepts clearly,\nlike you would with any exam.\n\n534\n00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,890\nBut the idea is really about understanding\nthe depth at which you have to go\n\n535\n00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,880\nto prepare.\n\n536\n00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,400\nAnd so making sure as we get ready to\nkinda wrap up this particular discussion\n\n537\n00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,580\nand just, finish talking about this\nlittle aspect of access control,\n\n538\n00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,020\nreally thinking about\nthe appropriate level of detail.\n\n539\n00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,400\nYou may want to go out and\nresearch Bell–LaPadula,\n\n540\n00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,260\nfind out all the interesting little nooks\nand crannies about a model like that.\n\n541\n00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,680\nBut you're not gonna need to bring\nall of that information with you\n\n542\n00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,300\nnecessarily to the exam.\n\n543\n00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,400\nBut you may want to have that\n\n544\n00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,990\npoint of reference as you go\nthrough your professional practice.\n\n545\n00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,860\nAnd use a model like that in\nyour professional practice.\n\n546\n00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,170\nGetting that balance,\nreally understanding it.\n\n547\n00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,860\nI often talk to my students about the idea\nthat it's very much like driving a.\n\n548\n00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,286\nManual car, right?\n\n549\n00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,551\nThe idea that you have to\nbalance on the clutch, and\n\n550\n00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:50,657\nthe gas to really understand how to\nmove forward at a proper speed, but\n\n551\n00:28:50,657 --> 00:28:54,050\nknow when to pull back and\nmost importantly know when to stop.\n\n552\n00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,210\nThat's really the important thing to think\nabout as we just go through this material\n\n553\n00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,090\nand help you to understand it.\n\n554\n00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:01,840\n>> All right well looking at the clock\nwe're right at our first break, so\n\n555\n00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,390\nwhy don't we stop here and take a break.\n\n556\n00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,220\nWhen we get back, we've got more\non access controls to get through.\n\n557\n00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,000\nWe got a couple of neat little\ntopics that are coming up there.\n\n558\n00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,510\nAnd I just wanna remind everybody,\n\n559\n00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,480\nduring the segment,\nI've been jotting down my little notes.\n\n560\n00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,940\nYou guys have seen them on screen.\n\n561\n00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,570\nAnd we'll post those at the end of the day\nwhen this episode goes onto the website,\n\n562\n00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,450\nthe notes will be posted right beneath\nit and you'll be able to see those.\n\n563\n00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,680\nIf you're jotting your own notes down,\ngreat.\n\n564\n00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,560\nIf you're not, and you wish you had,\nwell, I'll give you mine.\n\n565\n00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,770\nAnd maybe that helps, so, or maybe not,\nbecause I apparently don't know\n\n566\n00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,206\nhow to spell and have chosen\na program without a spellchecker.\n\n567\n00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:33,364\nSo.\n[LAUGH] So anyhow,\n\n568\n00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:35,108\nwe'll go ahead and stop here.\n\n569\n00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,555\nWe'll be back in a few minutes,\nsee you after this.\n\n570\n00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:41,296\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n571\n00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:47,320\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n572\n00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,630\nWe left off talking about\naccess control lists.\n\n573\n00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,278\nWe did a little bit of a teaser into our\nsorry, not access control lists, but\n\n574\n00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:54,190\naccess controls.\n\n575\n00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,777\n[LAUGH]\n>> Access controls,\n\n576\n00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:58,000\naccess control list is a kind of control.\n\n577\n00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,150\nJumping too far.\n\n578\n00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,830\nWe did a little bit of\na tease on a couple of\n\n579\n00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,650\ndifferent types of access control models,\nbecause that's what we're gonna pick back\n\n580\n00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,520\nup as we take a deeper\nlook into some of them.\n\n581\n00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,610\n>> Absolutely.\n\n582\n00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,540\nLet's talk a bit about some of the models,\nand\n\n583\n00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,840\nthe ways in which we can\ndeal with access control.\n\n584\n00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,810\nThey're gonna be important for you to be\naware of, but we wanna make sure that\n\n585\n00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,680\nyou're focused on them, at least at a high\nlevel, to understand the knowledge, right?\n\n586\n00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,350\nWe'll start off with temporal, [COUGH]\nexcuse me, temporal access control models.\n\n587\n00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,340\nAnd the idea with temporal access\ncontrol is we're talking about\n\n588\n00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,900\na time based isolation solution.\n\n589\n00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,480\nThink of maybe going in and being in a\nroom where there is a door at the far end\n\n590\n00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,170\nand you have to be buzzed through,\nthe door by a security office or\n\n591\n00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,460\nsomebody monitoring you from outside, they\nmay ask you to stand still for three or\n\n592\n00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,880\nfour seconds while a scan takes place.\n\n593\n00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,490\nThen they'll go ahead and they'll buzz\nthe door, there's a slight delay and\n\n594\n00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,960\nthen the door pops open.\n\n595\n00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,370\nSo that's something like\na time-based isolation solution.\n\n596\n00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,830\nMan traps are good examples of this as\nwell, where people walk into a room\n\n597\n00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:01,270\nthat is basically a two-door cage, and\nyou're able to buzz through one door.\n\n598\n00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,920\nYou're then in the middle of the cage or\nthe crucible, while\n\n599\n00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,460\nsomething is taking place, typically,\nagain, some sort of a look up and down,\n\n600\n00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,570\na scan, the security officers\nchecking your credentials.\n\n601\n00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,410\nIntegrating you into the system.\n\n602\n00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,060\nAllowing you through, to the other side.\n\n603\n00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,860\nBuzzing you in after a delay\nbased on some sort of time event.\n\n604\n00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,670\nJust be aware of that.\n\n605\n00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,960\nAnd we call them time-based isolation or\ntemporal access control solutions.\n\n606\n00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,360\nContent dependent access control.\n\n607\n00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,980\nIs where we're thinking about this idea\nof being able to look at the content,\n\n608\n00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,390\nwhatever the content may be,\n\n609\n00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,800\nwhat's in the data as it says on\nthe screen up there in front of you.\n\n610\n00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,309\nAnd then use the data to really drive\nthe idea of access control, and so\n\n611\n00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,535\nif you're a manager of a group, let's say\nmaybe hypothetically you've got five or\n\n612\n00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:45,462\nten people in your group, and your group\nis the sales and marketing group, and\n\n613\n00:31:45,462 --> 00:31:49,724\nthere's another group that has another\nmanager, maybe HR or something like that.\n\n614\n00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:53,993\nContent dependent access control would\ngive you access to the employee files for\n\n615\n00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:56,828\nyour team but\nnot let you see the other team's files.\n\n616\n00:31:56,828 --> 00:32:00,358\nThat are marked with the HR designation,\nhypothetically, for instance.\n\n617\n00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:03,949\nAnd so thinking about that and what's\nin the data is really the driver there,\n\n618\n00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:05,120\nis also very important.\n\n619\n00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,080\nWhen we talk about\nConstrained User Interfaces,\n\n620\n00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,590\nwhat we're talking about is what we\nthink of traditionally as menus,\n\n621\n00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,520\nit's probably the easiest\nway to think about it.\n\n622\n00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,000\nBut something like an ATM,\nwhere you might go and get some cash and\n\n623\n00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,340\ndepending on the choices you make on\nthe screen when you push your card in,\n\n624\n00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,130\nyou punch in your identity code PIN then\nyou have options to check your balance,\n\n625\n00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,330\nwant to make a withdrawal,\nwant to make a deposit.\n\n626\n00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,640\nYou are presented with different screens\nand different menus as a result, and\n\n627\n00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,680\nconstrained user interfaces are just that.\n\n628\n00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,710\nThey're solutions that allow us\nto make choices and narrow or\n\n629\n00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,120\nopen our menu options as a result of that.\n\n630\n00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,120\nWe often think of database use.\n\n631\n00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,290\nAs being another\nconstrained user interface,\n\n632\n00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,940\nwhere depending on the access\nwe are provided and\n\n633\n00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,850\nthe level of detail we're interacting\nwith the database surround.\n\n634\n00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,820\nWe see different data exposed in different\nways, so think about that as well.\n\n635\n00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,440\nSo just understand that maybe\na physically constrained\n\n636\n00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,010\nmenu is what we were actually\nphysically preventing.\n\n637\n00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,450\nFrom seeing certain kinds\nof data based on that.\n\n638\n00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,710\n>> And those are really common.\n\n639\n00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,590\nIt's in the news a lot\nright now because so\n\n640\n00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,680\nmany ATMs are still running Windows XP and\nyou don't know that.\n\n641\n00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,250\nA lot of people never actually\n\n642\n00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,202\nsee that underlying\n\n643\n00:33:09,202 --> 00:33:10,167\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Right.\n\n644\n00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,250\n>> And there's a lot of power there.\n\n645\n00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,960\nIf someone could get access to that,\nimagine the damage they could do, right.\n\n646\n00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,450\nSo just providing that limited access,\nthat's really important.\n\n647\n00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,290\nAnd there actually was an attack about\na year ago that actually involved\n\n648\n00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:26,360\npeople being able to get in in Europe,\nget in and take over an ATM.\n\n649\n00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,780\nAnd as a result, access the underlying\nbank's software and make withdrawals.\n\n650\n00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,110\nAnd they pulled several million dollars,\nin Euros out of ATMs out of a period of\n\n651\n00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,740\nseveral months because they were able to\nbasically load an unconstrained interface\n\n652\n00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,240\nand get full access, full control\nto the underlying banking software.\n\n653\n00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,400\nSo it happens more often\nthan you would think.\n\n654\n00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,200\nSo just be aware of that\nwhen you're going and\n\n655\n00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,762\nchecking your balance and\nmaking those check deposits.\n\n656\n00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:52,860\nAll right, so let's move on and\n\n657\n00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,400\ntalk about some of the other\nmodels that are on our list here.\n\n658\n00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,230\nWe talked about Bell LaPadula, we talked\nabout BIBA, we talked about Clark and\n\n659\n00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:03,230\nWilson in the last segment just\nreally teasing you as Don said and\n\n660\n00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,490\npreviewing them for you.\n\n661\n00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,250\nRight, but we want to go a little bit\ndeeper, give you some background knowledge\n\n662\n00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,200\non these and just help you to understand a\nlittle bit more of the way in which these\n\n663\n00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,540\nmodels are going to be implemented and how\nwe're going to deal with them as a result.\n\n664\n00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,310\nSo, the first thing to be aware of is that\nBell LaPadula focuses on Confidentially.\n\n665\n00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,960\nIt is considered a confidentiality model,\n\n666\n00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,440\na model that is focused on confidentially\nas opposed to ones focused on integrity.\n\n667\n00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,780\nWe'll see Biba focuses on integrity,\nas does Clark Wilson.\n\n668\n00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,790\nWe'll get to those in\njust a couple of minutes.\n\n669\n00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,510\nSo, understanding that, and having said\nthat, how do we use Bell LaPadula.\n\n670\n00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,370\nWhat are the properties, in other words,\nthat are associated with Bell LaPadula?\n\n671\n00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,800\nAnd what you'll see is\nwe have them listed for\n\n672\n00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,760\nyou on the screen Don was kind enough to\ntype up the notes for us so we have them.\n\n673\n00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,810\nSo you'll see we have three\nproperties identified there.\n\n674\n00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,350\nWe have the first one that says\nthat a simple security property, or\n\n675\n00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:56,915\na simple security concept, we call it\na property, is that you effectively as we\n\n676\n00:34:56,915 --> 00:34:59,945\nput in brackets at the bottom,\nare not allowed to read up, and\n\n677\n00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:04,985\nwhat that means is that a user at level\nA in the model, if the model has level A,\n\n678\n00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:08,825\nB, and C going up, A at the bottom,\nB in the middle, C at the top,\n\n679\n00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:12,820\nthat a user at level A cannot\nread data at levels B or C, but\n\n680\n00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,710\na user at level B can see data at level B,\ncan see data at level A as well, because\n\n681\n00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,430\nthey can see data below them, but they're\nnot allowed to see data above them.\n\n682\n00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,720\nSo we have this idea of no reading up.\n\n683\n00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,880\nIt's a great way of summarizing\nthat thought process.\n\n684\n00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,210\n>> And this is one of\nthe more like logical models,\n\n685\n00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,080\nthe ones that kind of make sense to us.\n\n686\n00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080\nIf you think about the U.S.\n\n687\n00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,120\ngovernment where you have Secret and\nTop Secret clearance.\n\n688\n00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,510\nIf you've got Secret clearance\nyou cannot read Top Secret, but\n\n689\n00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,480\nif you have Top Secret\nclearance you can read Secret.\n\n690\n00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,760\nYou know that's kind of\nthe normally implemented model.\n\n691\n00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,390\n>> Absolutely correct.\n\n692\n00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,090\nAnd if you're Edward Snowden\nyou can read everything.\n\n693\n00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:45,810\nSo works out for him.\n\n694\n00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,960\n>> Well, yeah.\n>> So with the star security property,\n\n695\n00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,320\nwhich is the second property down\non the list that you can see there,\n\n696\n00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,090\nwe summarize this as saying no write down.\n\n697\n00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,190\nAnd the idea with no write down is,\nif we go back to that model of ABC, right,\n\n698\n00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,300\nA being at the bottom, B in the middle,\nC at the top of our layers.\n\n699\n00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,560\nSomebody that is at level\nB in the model can see,\n\n700\n00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,720\nas we already said, can read data at\nlevel B and read data down at level A.\n\n701\n00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,990\nBut they cannot take data from level B and\nmove it down through a write process,\n\n702\n00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,410\nexposing it down to level A.\n\n703\n00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,390\nBecause that would take secure data and\n\n704\n00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,260\nexpose it at level that it's\nnot supposed to be seen at.\n\n705\n00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,960\nAnd so\nwe say you're not allowed to write down,\n\n706\n00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,430\nmeaning moving data from a more\nsecure to a less secure area, or\n\n707\n00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,110\nfrom top secret to secret,\nas we were just talking about.\n\n708\n00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,075\n>> Our like Edward Snowden,\ngoing from top secret to public.\n\n709\n00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:34,710\n[LAUGH]\n>> One fell swoop, right, so\n\n710\n00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,090\nwe want to make sure we're aware of that,\nand we understand that as a well.\n\n711\n00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,810\nSo, when we talk about Bell LaPadula,\nwe're talking about no read up, and\n\n712\n00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,760\nno write down, these are the ways we\nsummarize the activities, the model.\n\n713\n00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,890\nAnd the third one,\nthe strong star property.\n\n714\n00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,860\nAnd by the way, the little asterisk\nthat you see there is considered to be\n\n715\n00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,800\nwhen we talk about it is a star, so\nwe simply refer to the asterisk as a star.\n\n716\n00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,555\nSo when I say strong star\nI'm referring to that.\n\n717\n00:36:58,555 --> 00:36:59,985\nThe strong store property,\n\n718\n00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:03,595\nsubjects can only access basically\nobjects at the same level or below.\n\n719\n00:37:03,595 --> 00:37:07,585\nWe already summarized this by implying\nthat there's the ability to be able to\n\n720\n00:37:07,585 --> 00:37:09,935\nnot read up, but\nrather see data at your level and\n\n721\n00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:12,320\nbelow .This is called\nthe Strong * Property.\n\n722\n00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,750\nSo, again, at level B I can data at B and\ndata below me but I would not be able\n\n723\n00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,730\nto see what's going on above me, no read\nup to level C, if you will, in that model.\n\n724\n00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,850\nSo this is the Bell–LaPadula\nconfidentiality model, the take away for\n\n725\n00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,700\nyou is you want to know it\nfocuses on confidentiality,\n\n726\n00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,540\nyou want to understand the no read up and\nthe no write down concepts and\n\n727\n00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,060\nbe able to have a mental picture in\nyour head as you're thinking about these\n\n728\n00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,800\nas to what that would mean if you're\nasked about them in some form.\n\n729\n00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:45,420\nWhen we talk about Biba, our next model\ndown, we're talking about an integrity\n\n730\n00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,140\nmodel, the first of two that we focus on\nby the way, because Biba and Clark and\n\n731\n00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,570\nWilson are both going\nto be integrity models.\n\n732\n00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,060\nThe difference is, Biba,\nas you'll come to understand in a minute,\n\n733\n00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,720\nfocuses on only one of the three\ndriving requirements around integrity,\n\n734\n00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,340\nwhereas Clark Wilson\nwill focus on all three.\n\n735\n00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:03,920\nSo, Biba,\n\n736\n00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,630\nas you can see on the screen there,\nis going to be focused on integrity.\n\n737\n00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:11,080\nIt has three properties, or\nthree axioms associated with it.\n\n738\n00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,750\nWe call the simple integrity axiom,\nthe first item on the list for Biba.\n\n739\n00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:20,650\nThe ability to be able to look at\ninformation and see it at your level, but\n\n740\n00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,630\nyou can't read down below your level.\n\n741\n00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,630\nAnd so the thing to think about with Biba\nand what I often tell people when I talk\n\n742\n00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,390\nabout these models with them is that Biba\nis the exact opposite of Bell–LaPadula.\n\n743\n00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,720\nIt's the invert or\ninverted model if you will.\n\n744\n00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,180\nBecause, well Bell–LaPadula says\nbasically you cannot read up.\n\n745\n00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,990\nBiba says you cannot read down.\n\n746\n00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,420\nAnd so just think about one,\n\n747\n00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,390\nif you learn either of the two,\nyou automatically know the other.\n\n748\n00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,260\nJust by simply turning it around,\nso no read down for\n\n749\n00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,280\nBiba, meaning you're not\nallowed to see data below you.\n\n750\n00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,420\nBut you are allowed to\nsee data at your level.\n\n751\n00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,390\nRemember we're focused on integrity here.\n\n752\n00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,340\nAnd I want to make this distinction\nvery clearly for everybody.\n\n753\n00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,410\nConfidentiality is about\nsafeguarding information by\n\n754\n00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,760\nhiding it in effect from prying eyes.\n\n755\n00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,380\nIntegrity is about the idea of ensuring\nthe quality of that information and\n\n756\n00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,270\nknowing that the people that are using\nit are the people that are supposed\n\n757\n00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,190\nto, right.\n\n758\n00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,560\nThat's important, but knowing that\nthe person that put the information into\n\n759\n00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,220\nthe model is indeed the owner is more\nimportant than keeping the Information\n\n760\n00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,990\naway from people that aren't suppose to\nsee it, if we're focused on integrity.\n\n761\n00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,480\nAnd so when we say we don't\nwant you to read down,\n\n762\n00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,810\nis because we don't want you to\nscrew up the integrity of the data,\n\n763\n00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,780\nnot because we are worried\nabout you seeing the data.\n\n764\n00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,280\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n765\n00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,250\nAnd then the star integrity axiom,\nthe second one.\n\n766\n00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,830\nDown on our list is going\nto deal with no riding up.\n\n767\n00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,370\nBecause the idea is, that if you\nwrite data up to a higher level,\n\n768\n00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,890\nyou could modify\nthe integrity of that data.\n\n769\n00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,109\nWe again want to be\nfocused on the integrity.\n\n770\n00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:50,001\nWe'll come to talk about integrity,\nlater on in one of our\n\n771\n00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:53,662\nfuture discussions around the ideas\nof things like digitally hashing and\n\n772\n00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:57,756\nsignatures around that, digital signatures\nand creating checks on integrity.\n\n773\n00:39:57,756 --> 00:40:00,063\nBut for now we want to focus on\nthe model that implements it and\n\n774\n00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:00,931\njust be aware of that.\n\n775\n00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:04,220\nSo We have no read down and\nno write up for Biba.\n\n776\n00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,462\nAnd then we have our third axiom,\nwhich has no cool name associated with it,\n\n777\n00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:09,710\nas you can see there.\n\n778\n00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,350\nWe don't really give it a name,\nwe just kinda talk about it but\n\n779\n00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,340\nwe say subjects at an integrity\nlevel there as you can see\n\n780\n00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,160\ncan only basically work with a subject\nat that same integrity level or\n\n781\n00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,560\nlower, meaning you can interact with\npeople at your level and below.\n\n782\n00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,180\nYou can't interact with people above you\nand that's just something else to keep in\n\n783\n00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,720\nmind, again,\nthe exact inverse of Bella Patchell.\n\n784\n00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,010\n>> Yeah and notice that change.\n\n785\n00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,520\nThat the first two properties are talking\nabout how we access objects, but that\n\n786\n00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,840\nthird property is how we access a subject,\nso these typically can be other users.\n\n787\n00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,660\n>> And very important to point that out.\n\n788\n00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,820\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n789\n00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,300\nAnd then we have Clark Wilson.\n\n790\n00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,090\nThe Clark-Wilson integrity model,\nanother integrity model, also well known,\n\n791\n00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,760\nalso important to be aware of.\n\n792\n00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,470\nThis one focuses on and\nI've listed them, or\n\n793\n00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,350\nactually Don has been kind enough to list\nthem there for you, but I'll discuss them,\n\n794\n00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,950\nall three levels of integrity for us and\nspecifically, all three integrity goals.\n\n795\n00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,370\nWhen we say levels,\nwe really mean the goals of integrity.\n\n796\n00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,760\nand so you can see the three goals\nare prevent unauthorized users from\n\n797\n00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,140\nmodifying data.\n\n798\n00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,890\nThis is the first goal well defined and\nstated and\n\n799\n00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,500\nthis goal is covered by both models,\nClark Wilson and Biba.\n\n800\n00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,270\nThe difference here is\nthat Biba only addresses\n\n801\n00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:18,080\nthis first goal of preventing unauthorized\nusers from being able to modify data.\n\n802\n00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,160\nClark Wilson goes on to cover\nan additional two goals of integrity.\n\n803\n00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,720\nBiba does not address them.\n\n804\n00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,250\nIt is narrowly focused\nonly on this first one.\n\n805\n00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,510\nSo the second goal is to prevent\nauthorized users from making improper\n\n806\n00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,760\nmodifications.\n\n807\n00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,460\nWanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n808\n00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,950\nWe think about that in\nrelation to Clark and Wilson.\n\n809\n00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,960\nAnd then maintaining internal and external\nconsistency is also very important.\n\n810\n00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,640\nSo again,\nClark Wilson focuses on all three.\n\n811\n00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,510\nBiba only focuses on the first\nof the three integrity goals.\n\n812\n00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,910\nAnd then we have Brewer and Nash,\n\n813\n00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:50,415\nwhich is often commonly referred\nto as The Chinese Wall model.\n\n814\n00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:54,885\nThis idea is to create a logical\nfirewall inside of a company\n\n815\n00:41:54,885 --> 00:41:58,395\nbetween different competitive\ninterests for competitive groups\n\n816\n00:41:58,395 --> 00:42:02,475\nto prevent access to information without\naccess controls being put in place.\n\n817\n00:42:02,475 --> 00:42:07,410\nSo you think about a model like this,\nyou might think about a law firm that may\n\n818\n00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,050\nin some cases represent\nclients on both sides or\n\n819\n00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:15,840\ndifferent sides rather of a case, and that\ncan be done but it can only be done with\n\n820\n00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,930\nvery strict information\nmanagement requirements in place.\n\n821\n00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,550\nImagine if you were a law firm that had\nboth Coke and Pepsi, hypothetically,\n\n822\n00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,740\nas your clients, right.\n\n823\n00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,420\nThe Pepsi team would be dying to find out\nwhat the Coke team is up to, right, but\n\n824\n00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,760\nobviously they can't because that would\nviolate the integrity of the information,\n\n825\n00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,890\nthe client attorney privilege\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n826\n00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,830\nSo we put this model in place to prevent\nthose teams from being able to see\n\n827\n00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,170\neach other's resources.\n\n828\n00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,690\nThis gets down to something that's\nas basic but as important as\n\n829\n00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,480\nliterally different people working on\nthese teams not being able to crossover.\n\n830\n00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,190\nSo all the people that manage information\non one team are isolated from another.\n\n831\n00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,730\nTheir files are kept separate.\n\n832\n00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,700\nThey use separate computer systems.\n\n833\n00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,350\nReally all the way down the wire as we\nthink about what policies would need to be\n\n834\n00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,780\nin place for that.\n\n835\n00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,680\nSo these are the most important\nmodels that we often think about.\n\n836\n00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,350\nWe wanna make sure we're aware of this\nwhen we talk about information security\n\n837\n00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,870\naccess controls.\n\n838\n00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:10,710\n>> Yeah, it's really easy to focus too\nmuch in on the practical applications.\n\n839\n00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:15,170\nYou know, things like you know a file\naccess control list or whatever and\n\n840\n00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,440\nnot get that general concept of what\nit is you're trying to achieve and\n\n841\n00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,660\nthat's what these guys are all stating\nyou know is what that overall goal is.\n\n842\n00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,930\nNow how you achieve it well\nthat's up to you right.\n\n843\n00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,930\nThere's still a number of different\ntechnologies you can use to achieve it but\n\n844\n00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,320\nthat overall purpose and goal,\nthat's what we're seeing here and\n\n845\n00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,360\nthat's really what we need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n846\n00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,460\n>> Very important to be aware\nof that stuff, absolutely.\n\n847\n00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,790\nAnd one of the things to think about when\nwe talk about, not just the exam but\n\n848\n00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,757\nin general, when we're talking\nabout information security,\n\n849\n00:43:39,757 --> 00:43:42,930\nwe're talking about being\na practitioner being in the field,\n\n850\n00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:47,540\nbeing a professional, and the thing we\noften forget, and we often miss, and\n\n851\n00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,050\nit's so central to what we do every day,\nand I talked about this\n\n852\n00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,660\nin one of the earlier segments, where I\ntalked about security awareness training.\n\n853\n00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,510\nBut more importantly,\nwe often leave out common sense.\n\n854\n00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,150\nWe often overlook the obvious.\n\n855\n00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:04,290\nWe often forget to understand that just\nbecause something looks a certain way,\n\n856\n00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:07,540\nfeels a certain way, may or may not\nact a certain way, that that doesn't\n\n857\n00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,240\nmean that it's necessarily\nthe thing that we have in mind.\n\n858\n00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,150\nSo what I often try to tell the people\nthat I spend time with when\n\n859\n00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,960\nI talk about information security is\nnever obviously take anything for\n\n860\n00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,260\ngranted although it's pat to say that and\nwe often hear it.\n\n861\n00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,040\nWe often do overlook that advice but\nbe skeptical, right.\n\n862\n00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,750\nTrust, but verify as Gorbachev said\nto President Reagan many many years\n\n863\n00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,490\nago, right.\n\n864\n00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,160\nI won't do it for you in Russian,\nI won't bore you with that but\n\n865\n00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,330\nthe idea is if you trust but\nverify, right, understand and\n\n866\n00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,600\nknow what the information\nis you're looking up but\n\n867\n00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,260\nmake sure you have a really good complete\npicture of that operational environment.\n\n868\n00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,790\nThat's going to be the difference between\nsuccess and failure more often then not,\n\n869\n00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:49,020\nvery, very important so\njust be aware of that as well.\n\n870\n00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,370\nAlright, so let's talk a bit about\nauthentication types and what they are.\n\n871\n00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,740\nIt's probably a good idea for us to spend\na couple minutes talking about those.\n\n872\n00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,770\nIf we give you all these models and\ndon't tell you how you can implement and\n\n873\n00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,480\nbring them to bear then obviously\nwe're not doing you a good service.\n\n874\n00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,030\nSo what are authentication types?\n\n875\n00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,560\nYou know we tend to talk about three\ndifferent things when we talk about\n\n876\n00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,790\nauthentication types.\n\n877\n00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:09,150\nWe talk about something you know.\n\n878\n00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,640\nSomething you, excuse me,\n\n879\n00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,990\nsomething you know, something you have,\nand something you are.\n\n880\n00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,300\nIn no particular order, by the way.\n\n881\n00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,060\nYou often hear people refer\nto them as have, know, are.\n\n882\n00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,120\nWe can reorder them,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n883\n00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,400\nThe point is we talked about these three\nspecific areas or focal points for\n\n884\n00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,600\nus in terms of managing access and\n\n885\n00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,660\nmanaging information that's used to\ncontrol access, as being ways in which we\n\n886\n00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,430\nthen can really understand how\nsomebody is gonna get into a system.\n\n887\n00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,390\nWhen we think about something you know,\nwe may be thinking about a password.\n\n888\n00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:43,450\nWe may be thinking about something\nthat is knowledge that you have.\n\n889\n00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,740\nMaybe it's a pass phrase or\nan answer to a security question, but\n\n890\n00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,710\nsomething that traditionally nobody else\nwill have, at least they shouldn't anyway.\n\n891\n00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:54,480\nWhen we think about something you have,\nthat would be something like, perhaps,\n\n892\n00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,060\na dongle, one of the RSA key for\ninstance, right, a security dongle.\n\n893\n00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,160\nThat will generate a code,\nsome sort of a PIN.\n\n894\n00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,240\nSo that device is something you have.\n\n895\n00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,920\nYour ATM card,\n\n896\n00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,190\nif you have to use an ATM card along with\na PIN, would be something like that.\n\n897\n00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,198\nAn tag would be good.\n\n898\n00:46:12,198 --> 00:46:16,550\nA smart card, right, just a for instance\nin the military or the government but\n\n899\n00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:20,850\na smart card generically which is gonna\nbe able to be used with a reader and\n\n900\n00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,030\nusually has an embedded\nchip with identity,\n\n901\n00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,800\ndigital identity stored on\nit is something you have.\n\n902\n00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,920\nSomething you are is you,\nright, you individually.\n\n903\n00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,060\nWhether it is going to be something\nthat is uniquely identifying you such as\n\n904\n00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:39,420\na fingerprint or perhaps a voice print or\na retina scan or an iris scan.\n\n905\n00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,359\nAnd we'll talk about what these things are\nand why they're important in a while but\n\n906\n00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,470\nhow we understand those things as being\na part of you uniquely identifying you.\n\n907\n00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,360\nWe generically call these biometrics more\noften than not and that's how we refer to\n\n908\n00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,620\nthe art and science around them as\nyou see on the top of the list there.\n\n909\n00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,200\nThat represents something you are and so\nunderstanding that these identity types\n\n910\n00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,730\nand authentication types are important are\ngoing to be critical to you because you're\n\n911\n00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:06,220\nprobably using one or more of them in\ncombination with things you do everyday.\n\n912\n00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,790\nCertainly to go get money out of the bank\nwe use our ATM card along with a pin and\n\n913\n00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,550\nso we do something we know\nwith something we have there.\n\n914\n00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,060\nAnd when we combine these factors\nof authentication together\n\n915\n00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,650\nwe talk about single factor authentication\nbeing just one of the three.\n\n916\n00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,930\nDual factor authentication being two and\nthen multi-factor being two or\n\n917\n00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,610\nmore but typically referring to all three.\n\n918\n00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,900\nWe talk about obviously securing or\n\n919\n00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,740\ncreating levels of security\naround this access control.\n\n920\n00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,940\nAnd authentication types, and so\na single-factor authentication\n\n921\n00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,940\nis considered typically very\nweak by today's standards.\n\n922\n00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,160\nIf all you need is a password,\nyou walk up to the proverbial door,\n\n923\n00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,130\nyou knock on the door, the guy\nslides it open, gives a password and\n\n924\n00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:50,230\nlets you in, its not a very strong\nsystem but if we combine that with\n\n925\n00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,390\nsomething else it's usually gonna\nbe considered more effective.\n\n926\n00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,504\nWe want minimally dual factor,\na two factor, but\n\n927\n00:47:56,504 --> 00:48:00,599\nusually multi-factor systems\nare gonna be considered strong.\n\n928\n00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,490\nSo just a thought for\nour audience out there.\n\n929\n00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:06,868\n>> And you're really seeing\npeople wise up to that lately.\n\n930\n00:48:06,868 --> 00:48:09,695\nThe Things like the RSA secure ID tokens.\n\n931\n00:48:09,695 --> 00:48:13,624\nThose have been around a while and I think\nthe first one that I used would have been\n\n932\n00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:17,730\nwell over 10 years ago, but I know they've\nbeen around a lot longer than that.\n\n933\n00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,250\nSo those have been around a while but you\njust didn't see general acceptance of it,\n\n934\n00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,520\nyou saw it in certain environments but\n\n935\n00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,340\nnow a lot of organizations like Google\nis doing dual factor authentication.\n\n936\n00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,190\nThey've got the auto generating codes and\n\n937\n00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,640\nsomebody else that was high visibility\nwas talking about rolling it out.\n\n938\n00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,420\nI think it was Twitter or somebody.\n\n939\n00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,760\nSo, you're seeing a lot of common, just\nnormal, run of the mill companies starting\n\n940\n00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,350\nto recognize how important\nit is to have that.\n\n941\n00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:47,140\nThe idea of passwords is\nreally becoming coming passe.\n\n942\n00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,480\nIt's just not enough anymore.\n\n943\n00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,170\n>> It is.\nAnd\n\n944\n00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,620\nthere's an interesting phenomenon on\nthe mobile side when we talk about\n\n945\n00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:56,440\nwhether it's a tablet, for instance,\nsimply we see it on tablets although it's\n\n946\n00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,700\nstarting to emerge on smartphones\nas well in certain markets, well,\n\n947\n00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,320\nwe have this idea of a picture password,\nright?\n\n948\n00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,990\nWhere you can put basically an image\non the screen and through some sort\n\n949\n00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,420\nof combination of touch points,\nright along an axis, wherever they are.\n\n950\n00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,430\nYou're swooping through the picture\nin some predetermined pattern,\n\n951\n00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,160\nyou're able to log in.\n\n952\n00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,710\nYou know, it sounds cool,\nyou think it's cool,\n\n953\n00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,940\nit's just about as cool as having\na fingerprint scanner on your iPhone, but\n\n954\n00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,520\nwhen you think about the logic\nof these devices, right?\n\n955\n00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,430\nIt sounds like it makes a lot of sense.\n\n956\n00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,040\nAnd you buy it and go wow, this is cool.\n\n957\n00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,060\nFingerprint scanner.\n\n958\n00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,050\nI'm gonna use that,\nnobody can get into my phone.\n\n959\n00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:27,910\nWell, that's great.\n\n960\n00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,980\nBut there's a couple of\nissues associated with that.\n\n961\n00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,270\nFirstly, you have to think about the fact\nthat fingerprints are relatively easy\n\n962\n00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:33,790\nto duplicate.\n\n963\n00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:37,510\nAnd so as a result, it's really not as\nsecure as we often think it is, and\n\n964\n00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:40,380\nwhen you touch a screen like\nthat on a regular basis,\n\n965\n00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:44,710\nyou leave behind a contrail, in effect,\na trail of oil and dirt on your finger.\n\n966\n00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,330\nAnd although we're using\nscreen protectors, and\n\n967\n00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,200\nwe're not touching the glass directly.\n\n968\n00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,670\nThe reality is,\nif I want to get that touch point\n\n969\n00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:56,230\nkeystroke that you're using to open your\npicture password, it's not hard to do.\n\n970\n00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,810\nI'm not going to go into how you\ndo it now and educate you on that.\n\n971\n00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,680\nThat's more for maybe a hacking class and\nmaybe that'll be a topic for\n\n972\n00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,910\nanother time, but the idea behind\nit is not very complicated and\n\n973\n00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:08,290\nas a result, we often get tricked into\n\n974\n00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:12,900\nusing what is marketed to us as being\npotentially new and secure environments or\n\n975\n00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,560\ncontrols, when in fact, I come back\nto the idea of common sense, right?\n\n976\n00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,470\nIf all you do is a picture password,\nyou're probably not any more secure\n\n977\n00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:23,480\nthan just leaving your phone\nwith a normal four digit pin or\n\n978\n00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,510\na password or maybe even wide open.\n\n979\n00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,980\nWhich after we think about is are you\nencrypting that data on that device on\n\n980\n00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,010\nthe hard drive, or however you're storing\ndata if it's in the cloud or whatever.\n\n981\n00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:36,040\nAre you putting credentials on there\nthat could be replicated if somebody\n\n982\n00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,630\nforensically examines the phone?\n\n983\n00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:40,390\nThese are the kinds of things that you\nwant to be thinking about when we talk\n\n984\n00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:44,230\nabout multi factor authentication, not\njust the application of the technology,\n\n985\n00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,950\nbut what happens when\nthe technology doesn't work?\n\n986\n00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,890\nWhat's that next layer of defense?\n\n987\n00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,850\nHow do we bring the next level\nin to safeguard our data\n\n988\n00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,920\nout beyond the obvious of,\nwell, I had a password.\n\n989\n00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,060\nIt should have been enough.\n\n990\n00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,290\nNow what do I do, right?\n\n991\n00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,750\nSo just be aware of that and\nthink about that.\n\n992\n00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,570\nAnd speaking about passwords, we can\nalso authenticate by knowledge, right?\n\n993\n00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:03,730\nThis is yet another way.\n\n994\n00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:07,750\nTo do this, I talked about passwords and\npass phrases but think about that because\n\n995\n00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,980\ntoday while passwords are not really\nseen as being all that strong anymore,\n\n996\n00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,780\npass phrases are still typically something\nthat we see in secure organizations and\n\n997\n00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,920\na pass phrase is different.\n\n998\n00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,660\nIt's not a randomly generated set of\ncharacters, letters, and numbers.\n\n999\n00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,080\nBut rather a statement, a sentence, some\nsort of a combination of words that may or\n\n1000\n00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,360\nmay not have meaning, but ultimately is\nthen spoken or put into a system in that\n\n1001\n00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:35,330\npredetermined order to lengthen the key in\neffect that's required for authentication.\n\n1002\n00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,340\nSo, just be aware of that as well.\n\n1003\n00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,910\n>> Yeah, and again, technologies that\nare not new, that have been around for\n\n1004\n00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,835\nlong periods of times, but\nare just being recognized as being.\n\n1005\n00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:48,815\nFar more important now with the amount\nof data breaches that we've had and\n\n1006\n00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:50,275\njust how rampant the problem is,\n\n1007\n00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:54,005\nespecially with social engineering\nbeing as easy to pull of as it is.\n\n1008\n00:51:54,005 --> 00:51:55,835\nWe are seeing that quite a bit.\n\n1009\n00:51:55,835 --> 00:52:00,050\n>> Absolutely and I recently got\na new call is a smart phone but\n\n1010\n00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,050\na smartphone because I think I have\n\n1011\n00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:06,480\ntrouble labeling those devices as\nbeing smart for a variety of reasons.\n\n1012\n00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,950\nI think they're only as smart\nas the users that use them.\n\n1013\n00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:12,130\nBut the reality is,\nI switched from an old BlackBerry.\n\n1014\n00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:16,380\nI was one of the last holdouts in the\nworld that had the original BlackBerrys\n\n1015\n00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,610\nwith the thumb dial on them, right?\n\n1016\n00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,740\nYou've see mine and\nyou know what it used to look like.\n\n1017\n00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,000\nFinally had to give it up cuz\nthe third dial that I put and\n\n1018\n00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,260\nthe thing finally broke.\n\n1019\n00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,320\nAnd so I recently got a newer BlackBerry,\na Q10, one of the new keyboard-based ones,\n\n1020\n00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,000\nbut one of the new ones.\n\n1021\n00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,820\nIt's a touchphone.\n\n1022\n00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,370\nAnd I'm a ardent BlackBerry fan.\n\n1023\n00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:33,290\nI have been since the time\nthe company started and\n\n1024\n00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,550\nhope they continue to go on for many,\nmany years because it's a great product.\n\n1025\n00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,812\nBut having said that, a little marketing\ncampaign slogan from our advertiser.\n\n1026\n00:52:39,812 --> 00:52:41,360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So having said that,\n\n1027\n00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,870\nmy point about it is this, you know I had\nto put a storage card, a little micro\n\n1028\n00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:49,520\nSD card into the phone to keep track of a\nbunch of stuff, videos and things that I'm\n\n1029\n00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,250\nworking with while I'm travelling and\nI'm out and doing stuff like this.\n\n1030\n00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,190\nAnd so I have it in there but\n\n1031\n00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,910\nthe interesting thing with the OS which is\none of the reasons it's considered to be\n\n1032\n00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,620\nsuch a secure device is it gives me\nthe option automatically, when I\n\n1033\n00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,890\ninitialize the card, to encrypt the data\nif I wanna choose to store it encrypted,\n\n1034\n00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,820\nseparate from the phone.\n\n1035\n00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,340\nSo, if you remove that card,\n\n1036\n00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,900\nyou have to have the encryption\nkey in order to read the data.\n\n1037\n00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,540\nOr it is basically useless to you.\n\n1038\n00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:15,890\nSo if I store sensitive information on\nthe phone, you still can't get to it.\n\n1039\n00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,650\n>> And you'd be surprised how companies\ndon't take that into account.\n\n1040\n00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:20,620\nI'm an Android guy myself.\n\n1041\n00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,270\nI used to have Blackberries, but-\n>> My sympathies.\n\n1042\n00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,410\n>> So with Android in the early days,\n\n1043\n00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:30,800\nif you had a pin number or\nkey locks, whatever, on your screen,\n\n1044\n00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,540\nsomebody could turn the phone off,\npop your memory card out, and access it.\n\n1045\n00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:39,180\nAnd when they first released encryption\nfor the Android devices, it would just\n\n1046\n00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,940\nencrypt the internal storage, and not the-\n>> Not the external, right?\n\n1047\n00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,085\n>> SD card.\nAnd if you did a remote wipe on the phone,\n\n1048\n00:53:44,085 --> 00:53:46,425\nit would wipe just the internal\nstorage not the external,\n\n1049\n00:53:46,425 --> 00:53:48,145\nit was like they completely overlooked it.\n\n1050\n00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:50,685\nAnd it wasn't until a later\nupdate that they fixed that and\n\n1051\n00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,315\nnow you can encrypt the SD\ncard in a remote way.\n\n1052\n00:53:52,315 --> 00:53:53,435\n>> Absolutely you can.\n\n1053\n00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:55,615\nAnd all the vendors get that or\nthey're starting to, I should say.\n\n1054\n00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:58,040\nYou're absolutely right, but you know,\nit's these common sense things.\n\n1055\n00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,330\nThese are the kind of things we're talking\nabout and bringing to your attention\n\n1056\n00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,600\nbecause you know if a vendor\noverlooks it that's not an excuse for\n\n1057\n00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,120\nyou to just sit back and\naccept the fact that you're insecure.\n\n1058\n00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,690\nYou know laptops, and\nyou see I'm using a laptop, and\n\n1059\n00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:14,020\nsome of the screen shots you're\nseeing of us, Don has a tablet here,\n\n1060\n00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,270\na laptop tablet kind of device that flips.\n\n1061\n00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,990\nWe all have devices that may or\nmay not take it to the next level, right?\n\n1062\n00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,470\nBut you being the smart person really\nunderstanding what that means,\n\n1063\n00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,750\nand taking that next step,\nand figuring out what to do\n\n1064\n00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:30,940\nis the difference between success and\nfailure at the end of the day, all right.\n\n1065\n00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,280\n>> All right.\nWell, Adam, I'm looking at the clock.\n\n1066\n00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,920\nWe're right at our next break, so why\ndon't we see stop here and take a break?\n\n1067\n00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,590\nWhen we get back,\nwhat are we moving into next?\n\n1068\n00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,370\n>> So when we get back,\nwe'll talk a little bit more.\n\n1069\n00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,500\nWe're gonna continue to\nfinish talking about these.\n\n1070\n00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,370\nWe're gonna talk about authentication\na little bit more by characteristic and\n\n1071\n00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:48,610\nwe'll talk about some of the different\nbiometric solutions that we mention\n\n1072\n00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,410\nquickly.\n\n1073\n00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,060\nIris scans, things like that, make sure\nyou guys are comfortable with them and\n\n1074\n00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,700\nthen we'll continue working\nthrough access controls.\n\n1075\n00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:00,860\n>> All right, so stay tuned, we'll be back\nwith more access controls after this.\n\n1076\n00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,730\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1077\n00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,450\nSo we've been talking so\nfar about access control and\n\n1078\n00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:13,940\nwe're going to kind of wrap that up.\n\n1079\n00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,120\nI guess we've got a little bit more,\n\n1080\n00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,450\nsome of the neater, more diverse topics\nto get through here before the end of it.\n\n1081\n00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,260\nSo let's continue on.\n\n1082\n00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,520\nI don't think we were mid\nthought when we ended.\n\n1083\n00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,540\n>> No, we'd wrapped up\ntalking about passwords and\n\n1084\n00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,120\njust kind of the pass phrase and\nthat whole idea.\n\n1085\n00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,170\nWe want to talk a little bit more\nabout some of the other aspects,\n\n1086\n00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,860\nspecifically authentication.\n\n1087\n00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,330\nWe'll talk about smart cards\nauthentication by ownership.\n\n1088\n00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,880\nHow we do some of those things.\n\n1089\n00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,250\nTokens, memory cards.\n\n1090\n00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,300\nSome of those differences.\n\n1091\n00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,010\nMake sure we're comfortable with them and\nwhat they mean.\n\n1092\n00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,720\nSo, when we talk about authentication by\nownership, we're talking about being able\n\n1093\n00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,060\nto authenticate with something\nthat you actually have, right?\n\n1094\n00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,960\nThis is the something you have, something\nyou know, something you are concept.\n\n1095\n00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,330\nSo, something you have,\na token which is typically a one time,\n\n1096\n00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,150\nwhat we call a dynamic password.\n\n1097\n00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,961\nWe had talked about RSA tokens,\nauto generating, things of that nature.\n\n1098\n00:55:57,961 --> 00:55:59,323\nWhen we talk about smart cards,\n\n1099\n00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:02,906\nwe're talking about cards that typically\nhave some sort of embedded logic in them,\n\n1100\n00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:06,042\nand we'll differentiate between\ncontact and contactless smart cards.\n\n1101\n00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:10,414\nWhat those are, and so when we talk about\ntokens, we talk about two different types,\n\n1102\n00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:12,844\nwhat we call synchronous or\nasynchronous, and\n\n1103\n00:56:12,844 --> 00:56:16,932\nthese are vocabulary terms we often hear\na lot about when we deal with security.\n\n1104\n00:56:16,932 --> 00:56:20,606\nBecause we're talking about something\nbeing done kind of in parallel with other\n\n1105\n00:56:20,606 --> 00:56:24,131\nthings, or perhaps something being\ndone after something else is finished.\n\n1106\n00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,234\nSo this idea of whether\nwe're following on, or\n\n1107\n00:56:26,234 --> 00:56:28,713\nwe're doing in parallel is\nwhat we're talking about?\n\n1108\n00:56:28,713 --> 00:56:32,615\nAnd so when we talk about a synchronous\ntoken, excuse me, we're talking about\n\n1109\n00:56:32,615 --> 00:56:36,129\nan algorithm that calculates numbers\nat both authentication server.\n\n1110\n00:56:36,129 --> 00:56:39,885\nAt the far side really at the far end\nof this process, and the device and\n\n1111\n00:56:39,885 --> 00:56:43,180\ndisplay some sort of a number\non your screen for you.\n\n1112\n00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,550\nAnd then basically we enter the number,\nthe user or\n\n1113\n00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,890\nwhat we would call the subject,\nright to use our subject object language.\n\n1114\n00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:53,840\nThe subject will enter the number,\nwhatever that is, as a login password or\n\n1115\n00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,390\nauthenticator.\n\n1116\n00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:58,860\nIt's basically the idea that we ran and we\ngenerated, some sort of a number that has\n\n1117\n00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,830\nto then be put into the system\nin order to validate us and.\n\n1118\n00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,470\nThe idea would be that\nif you own the token,\n\n1119\n00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:06,580\nand you're holding it,\nthat number shows up on your screen.\n\n1120\n00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,000\nThat number in theory\nis only known to you,\n\n1121\n00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,550\nbecause the only other party that knows\nthe token is the authentication server,\n\n1122\n00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:16,110\nthat generates the number that\nyou're being given on the token.\n\n1123\n00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,860\nSo as a result,\nwe call that a synchronous solution,\n\n1124\n00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:23,040\nwhere it's running kind of in\nsynchronization against the server, and\n\n1125\n00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,210\nallowing you to then\nenter that as a result.\n\n1126\n00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,485\n>> And just to look real quick,\nif you've never seen one of these,\n\n1127\n00:57:28,485 --> 00:57:32,622\nthey're pretty cool, I' mentioned them\nearlier in the show, the [CROSSTALK].\n\n1128\n00:57:32,622 --> 00:57:36,802\nAnd these are some of the most common ones\nyou'll see out there, and it is just a,\n\n1129\n00:57:36,802 --> 00:57:39,280\nthese are the old ones,\nthese are the new ones.\n\n1130\n00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,120\nBut, it is just a little thing\nyou put on your key chain, and\n\n1131\n00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,930\nthese dots over here that's a timer that\nticks down 60 seconds, so that every 60\n\n1132\n00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:50,210\nseconds a different code, and\nyou're having to calculate out the code.\n\n1133\n00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,810\nThe server is doing the same thing, so it\nknows which code is valid and which time.\n\n1134\n00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:56,700\nSo, both are kind of\nparticipating in that action.\n\n1135\n00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,600\nBut it doesn't have to be\na hardware token like that,\n\n1136\n00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,870\nit can be things like\nthe Google Authenticator.\n\n1137\n00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,440\n>> So, software based in other words,\nright?\n\n1138\n00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,550\nWe have both hardware and\nsoftware solutions you'll see.\n\n1139\n00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,370\nI think we're gonna bring one\nup here in just a minute,\n\n1140\n00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:12,030\nthat'll show you a software console or\na software version of this.\n\n1141\n00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,320\nAnd so absolutely, we could do either one.\n\n1142\n00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,698\nSo, we have an image [CROSSTALK].\n\n1143\n00:58:15,698 --> 00:58:16,540\nYeah.\n\n1144\n00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,490\n>> And so yeah, in software, it's nice,\ncuz you can use your cell phone or\n\n1145\n00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,540\nsome device that you've already got\nwith you, and it's just automatically\n\n1146\n00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,580\ngenerating these numbers,\njust like the secure ID tokens have.\n\n1147\n00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,650\n>> Now, contrary to urban myth and\nlegend and rumor,\n\n1148\n00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,990\nGoogle will let you generate\ndevices on Windows phones.\n\n1149\n00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,407\nI just thought I'd mention it,\nfor example.\n\n1150\n00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:32,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm only kidding, by the way.\n\n1151\n00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,230\nI'm only kidding, right?\n\n1152\n00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,190\nSo but, the idea is that when we talk\nabout these synchronous solutions like Don\n\n1153\n00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,940\nwas showing you, these are the kinds\nof things that you're gonna to see and\n\n1154\n00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,130\na lot of times these are being used for\nremote access solutions, right?\n\n1155\n00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:46,270\nSo, people that are coming in\nremotely accessing content from\n\n1156\n00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,510\neither outside the network or even inside\nthe network, but may be remotely accessing\n\n1157\n00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:54,910\ninto the network and then jumping to\na file server or being inside the network.\n\n1158\n00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:58,740\nBut then, getting to very secure content,\nwe're gonna use those tokens and\n\n1159\n00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,990\nthose generated IDs to do so.\n\n1160\n00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:02,750\nSo, that's a synchronous solution.\n\n1161\n00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,190\nWe talked about asynchronous,\n\n1162\n00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:06,660\nwe're talking about a slightly\ndifferent approach.\n\n1163\n00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,210\nWe still have an authentication server.\n\n1164\n00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:12,520\nThere's still some sort of a token, or\na generation device that's being used, but\n\n1165\n00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,210\nbasically what happens is\na challenge response solution.\n\n1166\n00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,930\nSo instead of a,\nlet me generate the code and enter it and\n\n1167\n00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,440\nwe both know what the code is and\nwe validate the code.\n\n1168\n00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,690\nWhat's happening is,\n\n1169\n00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,650\nwe are going to issue a challenge\nfrom the authentication server.\n\n1170\n00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:26,790\nWho are you?\n\n1171\n00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:30,000\nDon might say, well, my name is Don,\nand my information is this.\n\n1172\n00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,800\nThis is what I'm supposed to provide.\n\n1173\n00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,755\nDon sends that back as to\nthe answer to the challenge.\n\n1174\n00:59:34,755 --> 00:59:36,435\nAnd then the authentication server,\n\n1175\n00:59:36,435 --> 00:59:39,205\ntypically with a tie back\ninto the directory service.\n\n1176\n00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:41,245\nWhatever that may be,\nwhether it's active directory,\n\n1177\n00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:45,450\nor some sort of NIS solution, or\njust a generic LDAP directory.\n\n1178\n00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,430\nIs gonna let you then authenticate,\n\n1179\n00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:50,430\nwhatever that may mean in that\nsystem to validate the challenge.\n\n1180\n00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:53,160\nAnd so, the a synchronize solution\nis a challenge response solution,\n\n1181\n00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,400\nand that's really the key difference\nthat we wanna make sure we're aware of,\n\n1182\n00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,140\nthe challenge will be issued.\n\n1183\n00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,900\nThe response is issued on\nbehalf of the subject,\n\n1184\n01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,720\nthat is trying to authenticate\nin assuming you are successful.\n\n1185\n01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,010\nYou will get in and be able to then\naccess, whatever information you need.\n\n1186\n01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,180\nAnd if you think about this,\nwhile you may or may not use,\n\n1187\n01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,480\nthis in your enterprise environments and\nbusiness every day,\n\n1188\n01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,100\nwe probably have all been exposed\nto this in one form or another.\n\n1189\n01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:20,340\nIf you've paid bills online or\ncalled up because of a support issue,\n\n1190\n01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:23,900\nor call the credit card company to be\nable to get to talk to a human being,\n\n1191\n01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,835\nas challenging as that may be sometimes,\nright?\n\n1192\n01:00:25,835 --> 01:00:27,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you're typically asked one or\n\n1193\n01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,340\nmore security questions.\n\n1194\n01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,810\nAnd asked to respond, what's your\nmother's maiden name, your favorite pet,\n\n1195\n01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:35,150\nwhere did you go to first grade or\nsomething like that?\n\n1196\n01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,150\nThose are effectively\nasynchronous solutions,\n\n1197\n01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,780\nthey're challenge\nauthentication solutions so.\n\n1198\n01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,910\nJust keep that in mind and\nmaybe think through that,\n\n1199\n01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,998\nas a way to remember\nthe difference between the two.\n\n1200\n01:00:44,998 --> 01:00:49,980\n>> And with asychronist because of\nthe design, it is difficult for\n\n1201\n01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,400\nus as a client to verify that\nthe server is who they say they are, so\n\n1202\n01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,420\nit's normally coupled with something else.\n\n1203\n01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,650\nWhen you call that credit card company and\nthey say.\n\n1204\n01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,280\nAll right, what's the last four\ndigits of your credit card, or\n\n1205\n01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,590\nthe last four of your\nSocial Security number, right?\n\n1206\n01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,620\nYou've got some value\nthat you can give them,\n\n1207\n01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,430\nto prove that you are who you say you are.\n\n1208\n01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:09,710\nBut, how do you know the credit card\ncompany is, who they say they are?\n\n1209\n01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,110\nWell, you don't necessarily,\n\n1210\n01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,720\nright, unless you're the one who\ndialed the number, or whatever.\n\n1211\n01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,510\nBut there's not,\nsomething kinda build into to that.\n\n1212\n01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:19,800\nSo that's that kinda one way\ndirection of asynchronous.\n\n1213\n01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,610\n>> Very true.\nAnd\n\n1214\n01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,760\na lot of times we call these\nman-in-the-middle attacks,\n\n1215\n01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,810\nor redirect attacks where,\nbecause of that nature, if you're not\n\n1216\n01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,090\nable to authenticate, we talk about\nintegrity, we've spoken about it before.\n\n1217\n01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,010\nIf you can't establish the integrity\nof the party on the other end.\n\n1218\n01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:35,940\nYou may actually be talking to\nsomebody who represents themselves\n\n1219\n01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,310\nas the service provider, but, in fact,\nmay actually be a third party.\n\n1220\n01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:42,110\nAnd that could be a very big challenge,\nin some of these solutions as well, so\n\n1221\n01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:42,850\nit's good to point that out.\n\n1222\n01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:45,020\nSo, lets talk a bit about smart cards.\n\n1223\n01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,130\nWe talked about this idea of asynchronous\nand synchronous with tokens, and\n\n1224\n01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:51,770\nwith smart cards, another way of\nbasically representing the same concept,\n\n1225\n01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:55,110\nwe can take typically what looks like and\nacts like a credit card.\n\n1226\n01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:58,770\nI'm sure those of you that are listening\nto us, may have seen smart cards,\n\n1227\n01:01:58,770 --> 01:01:59,940\nmay even have one.\n\n1228\n01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,810\nIf you work in the military, work in\nthe government, you have whats known\n\n1229\n01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:05,780\nas a CAT card, which is a smart\ncard with an imbedded chip in it.\n\n1230\n01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:09,840\nThat will have a digital identity stored\nin it, typically with certificates\n\n1231\n01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,380\nthat are used, but today most modern\ncredit cards are CAT cards, or\n\n1232\n01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,940\nrather excuse me, are smart cards as well.\n\n1233\n01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,420\nAnd they have some sort of embedded chip,\nand you can see on the screen there\n\n1234\n01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,250\nwe've got some different graphics\nthat might represent this.\n\n1235\n01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,330\nSo there's one with\na little chip right there.\n\n1236\n01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:26,140\nAnd the idea is,\nthat we store information inside of there.\n\n1237\n01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,980\nAnd so, we have two main categories.\n\n1238\n01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,358\nWe talk about contact, and\ncontactless smart cards.\n\n1239\n01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:34,790\nWith a contact smart card, much like\nthe one we were just seeing for instance,\n\n1240\n01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,150\nthat was up there a minute ago.\n\n1241\n01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:40,400\nThis is gonna be used for\nauthentication obviously typically.\n\n1242\n01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,640\nAnd we have to have some sort of a reader,\nthat you're gonna put the card into.\n\n1243\n01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,760\nSo typically, we slide our credit\ncard through some sort of a reader at\n\n1244\n01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,520\na merchant that we're buying from.\n\n1245\n01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,520\nAnd we put it into the ATM\nreader at the bank.\n\n1246\n01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,460\nOr we get gas,\nwhatever that might be, right?\n\n1247\n01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,600\nWe slide it in there, and\n\n1248\n01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,570\nas a result of that, we then are enabling\nthe machine to power up the card, and\n\n1249\n01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:02,520\npull information out of that chip\nthat's embedded in the card.\n\n1250\n01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,900\nAnd so the chip itself doesn't\nhave any onboard power.\n\n1251\n01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,840\nIt's only powered up when\nthe reader actually, and\n\n1252\n01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,090\nyou can see on the screen, there we\nhave some pictures of different readers.\n\n1253\n01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:15,130\nIt powers up the card long enough to\nbasically access the digital content,\n\n1254\n01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:18,930\nand then when you pull the card out of the\nreader, it effectively powers back down.\n\n1255\n01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:23,030\nThe downside with cards like this, is\nthat you have to be very wary these days,\n\n1256\n01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:25,455\nof the fact that somebody\nthat walks by you.\n\n1257\n01:03:25,455 --> 01:03:29,205\nWith a effectively a power device,\na reader that can power up these\n\n1258\n01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:32,505\ncards within,\nmaybe three to five feet these days.\n\n1259\n01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:35,040\nIf your card is not shield,\nit can actually pull data off your card.\n\n1260\n01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,305\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So one of the big problems with\n\n1261\n01:03:36,305 --> 01:03:37,475\npassports today.\n\n1262\n01:03:37,475 --> 01:03:41,110\nBecause US government among many other\ncountry has recently, in the last several\n\n1263\n01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:45,910\nyears, gone to newer passports that\nhave embedded smart information in them.\n\n1264\n01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:50,610\nAnd these, one of the big security\nconcerns was, could somebody effectively\n\n1265\n01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:54,640\nwave a magic wand, or reader of some kind\nwithin about five to ten feet of you.\n\n1266\n01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,420\nAnd maybe read the information\nthat's embedded in the passport, or\n\n1267\n01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,870\nembedded in the smart card.\n\n1268\n01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,030\nResearch has shown that depending\non the kind of device it is,\n\n1269\n01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:05,900\nand how the information is stored that\nthey can, so this is definitely an issue.\n\n1270\n01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,755\nYou can see on the screen there,\nthat this is a contact with smart card,\n\n1271\n01:04:08,755 --> 01:04:10,960\nwe gonna get to this one in a minute,\nand that's fine.\n\n1272\n01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,460\nLeave the image up,\nbecause it's actually good to have that.\n\n1273\n01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,824\nWe'll talk about the difference.\n\n1274\n01:04:14,824 --> 01:04:18,460\nBut, the key difference here\nwith the contactless smart card,\n\n1275\n01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,965\nas you can see is that\nwe have this embedded.\n\n1276\n01:04:20,965 --> 01:04:23,468\nIC chip right there, but\nthere's this antenna,\n\n1277\n01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:26,880\nkinda this copper wire that's\nframing the edges of the card.\n\n1278\n01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,780\nImagine the image you're\nseeing on the screen.\n\n1279\n01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,630\nThe card is literally a sandwich, right?\n\n1280\n01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:34,050\nIn the middle, we're looking at\nthe contents that sandwich between the two\n\n1281\n01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,270\nplastic edges of the card.\n\n1282\n01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,470\nYou would have to split\nthe card open to see this, but\n\n1283\n01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:42,148\nthat antenna allows us to draw power\ndown from a reader of some kind within.\n\n1284\n01:04:42,148 --> 01:04:43,770\nProbably about two feet, give or\n\n1285\n01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:47,170\ntake maybe three feet on the outside\ndepending on the nature cart.\n\n1286\n01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:48,510\nWe tend to call these,\n\n1287\n01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:52,840\nin generic, IT slang, prox, or proximity\ncards because you get within a foot or\n\n1288\n01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,770\ntwo of the reader,you wave the card,\nand it typically will open the door.\n\n1289\n01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:57,380\nAnd so a lot of times at work,\n\n1290\n01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:00,940\nyou may see somebody holding\ntheir wallet up to the air, or\n\n1291\n01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,130\nwithin about a foot of the badge reader,\nor something just waving their wallet.\n\n1292\n01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:07,040\nAnd as a result,\nthe proximity is powering up the cart.\n\n1293\n01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,320\nSo contact with smart cards don't\nhave to come into direct contact,\n\n1294\n01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,070\nwith the strike plate of the reader,\nbut they do have to be within several\n\n1295\n01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:16,590\nfeet of the reader in order to power up,\nand that antenna allows them to do that.\n\n1296\n01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:17,610\n>> Yeah, but it's like you said,\n\n1297\n01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:21,745\nthe convenience of not having to insert\nyour card into a reader, you have that\n\n1298\n01:05:21,745 --> 01:05:27,060\ntrade-off of now having a card that can be\nread remotely and so that is a problem.\n\n1299\n01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,790\nThere was a whole article.\n\n1300\n01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:33,610\nI remember when the US passport started\ngetting the RFID chips in them and stuff.\n\n1301\n01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:36,830\nThat there are websites dedicated to\nthis where they would show how to take\n\n1302\n01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:38,330\nyour passport, and\n\n1303\n01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:41,590\nput a towel over it, and smash it with\na hammer to break the chip inside of it.\n\n1304\n01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:44,530\nAnd they were saying the passport\nis valid even without that chip,\n\n1305\n01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:46,020\npeople were really paranoid about it.\n\n1306\n01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,890\nAnd, you should I guess\nshouldn't say paranoid but\n\n1307\n01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:52,290\nthere's a valid reason for\nbeing concerned about that data leaking\n\n1308\n01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,980\nespecially when it's\nsomething like your passport.\n\n1309\n01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,280\nThe primary source of identity\nin the United States.\n\n1310\n01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:57,980\n>> Absolutely correct.\n\n1311\n01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:58,740\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n1312\n01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,550\nSo it is.\nIt is something to consider.\n\n1313\n01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:02,640\nAgain remember that theme we've\nbeen hitting on all throughout\n\n1314\n01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,190\nour conversations which is\nthat awareness concept, but\n\n1315\n01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:08,110\nalso the common sense concept and\npairing the two together.\n\n1316\n01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,790\nJust because somebody says to you,\noh, it's okay to worry about it.\n\n1317\n01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:12,090\nWe've got it covered.\n\n1318\n01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,290\nWe all know that trust, but verify,\n\n1319\n01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:17,190\nI think I mentioned before as well\nis a general rule of thumb that we\n\n1320\n01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:20,030\nuse in security to make sure we're\nnot being caught unawares, right.\n\n1321\n01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:22,800\nWe don't want to have that risk\nbecome more than we can actually.\n\n1322\n01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,010\nProperly take on and manage.\n\n1323\n01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:27,250\nAnd so when we deal with these tokens,\nwhether they're asynchronous or\n\n1324\n01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:30,120\nsynchronous, we're dealing with this\nidea of challenge and response or\n\n1325\n01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,780\nsomehow providing a credential.\n\n1326\n01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,250\nThis is generically sometimes\nreferred to as digital identity,\n\n1327\n01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:38,360\nand this is just how we're providing this\ninformation and authenticating back.\n\n1328\n01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,170\nYou're with the advent of modern\nremote access technologies and\n\n1329\n01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:45,350\nreally taking the edge of the network,\nthe border more and\n\n1330\n01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:49,100\nmore down to the device level,\nso really changing this idea\n\n1331\n01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:53,160\nof where we see the device in relation\nto the information being managed.\n\n1332\n01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,990\nSome of these technologies are falling\nout of favor, we still use RSI tokens for\n\n1333\n01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:01,100\ninstance but we don't worry about\nVPN access as much as we used to.\n\n1334\n01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,780\nAs a result, we may or may not be seeing\nsome of these things being implemented as\n\n1335\n01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:07,090\ntraditional systems would\nhave been years ago.\n\n1336\n01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:10,420\nThat's not to say they're not important\nfor you as a security practitioner to be\n\n1337\n01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:14,430\naware of because they change, but that\ndoesn't mean the underlying concept of\n\n1338\n01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:17,870\nproviding secure access is no longer valid\n>> And\n\n1339\n01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:21,670\nthe smart cards themselves,\nthe chip that's on a smart card,\n\n1340\n01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:25,710\nit can only hold a small amount of data\nand I don't remember the specific sizes,\n\n1341\n01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,850\nsomething like between one and\ntwo megabytes.\n\n1342\n01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:30,460\nIt's kind of like the equivalent\nof an old floppy disk.\n\n1343\n01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:34,105\nIt is the perfect place to store\na certificate if you're doing\n\n1344\n01:07:34,105 --> 01:07:38,150\ncertificate-based authentication,\nor EAP, or anything like that.\n\n1345\n01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,550\nAs technology changes and we come up with\nnew ways to authenticate, or stronger\n\n1346\n01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:46,300\ncertificates, or whatever, the smart\ncards are very easy to retrofit for that.\n\n1347\n01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,560\nThe only real negative we have on\nsmart cards is that most Computers,\n\n1348\n01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:53,770\nmost laptops desktops and so on don't\nhave smart card readers built in to them,\n\n1349\n01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:57,100\nright there was a brief period where\nyou started seeing it in laptops and\n\n1350\n01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,500\nthen they kind of discontinued it.\n\n1351\n01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,530\n>> Right.\n>> If your gonna leverage these in your\n\n1352\n01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:02,760\nbuilding, in your workplace or\n\n1353\n01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,430\nwhatever you will normally see them\nimplemented as keypads next to a door.\n\n1354\n01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:10,150\nOr if you're doing it on laptops and\ndesktops, they'll have to add it on,\n\n1355\n01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:14,490\neither USB readers or ones that\nreplace a 3.5 inch bay in your PC or\n\n1356\n01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,370\nsomething like that.\n\n1357\n01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:18,530\n>> Very good.\nIts good to remind us of that.\n\n1358\n01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:22,010\nLet's talk about authentication by\ncharacteristic instead of ownership.\n\n1359\n01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,240\nWe kind of just went through that,\ntalked about that.\n\n1360\n01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,035\nBut authentication by characteristic\nwe had spoken about in relation to\n\n1361\n01:08:27,035 --> 01:08:28,060\nbio-metrics.\n\n1362\n01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:32,120\nThis'll be the something you are in\nour conversation from have, no, are.\n\n1363\n01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,100\nThis is something you are.\n\n1364\n01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,500\nAuthentication through\ncharacteristic really talks about,\n\n1365\n01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,250\nfirst of all at a kind of\nhigh level starting off,\n\n1366\n01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:41,580\nthe difference between physical and\ndynamic characteristics.\n\n1367\n01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,790\nAnd physical characteristics would be and\nwe listed some of these already.\n\n1368\n01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:50,380\nThings like fingerprint scans,\nfacial recognition,\n\n1369\n01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:53,610\nscanning a fingerprint,\npick your finger whichever one it may be.\n\n1370\n01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:58,780\nFacial recognition, things of that nature,\niris versus retina scans in the eye right,\n\n1371\n01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:01,300\nbeing able to scan different\nareas of the body.\n\n1372\n01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,100\nThere's voice recognition,\n\n1373\n01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,760\nthat is very popular today in\na lot of the smart phones but.\n\n1374\n01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,990\nDoing voice scanning, for instance,\nwould be falling into that.\n\n1375\n01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:13,340\nAnd although it's not used a lot outside\nof the military and the government, DNA.\n\n1376\n01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,420\nAnd using DNA fingerprinting,\nwhich is prevalent among the armed forces,\n\n1377\n01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,610\nin particular, for identification of\nindividuals in highly secure environments\n\n1378\n01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:23,060\nis a unique physical identifier as well,\n\n1379\n01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:28,160\nclearly gonna be very hard to in any\nway replicate that with any meaning\n\n1380\n01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,530\nbecause the DNA pattern of an individual\nis as unique as their fingerprint.\n\n1381\n01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:36,610\nThen we talk about dynamic,\nwhere we talk about things like doing\n\n1382\n01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:40,550\nbehavioral solutions where we scan for\ninstance for keyboard strokes or\n\n1383\n01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:43,240\nhow quickly you type and\nwhat you're typing pattern is.\n\n1384\n01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:47,850\nDon is a wiz here on the keyboard as\nwe're talking and, his typing pattern,\n\n1385\n01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,680\nhis keystroke analysis would be\ndifferent from mine because I hunt and\n\n1386\n01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,930\npeck, so I'm the kind of person\nwho never learned how to type.\n\n1387\n01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:55,110\nBut those kind of things, right.\n\n1388\n01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:59,770\nAnd signature motions where you will\nwrite down or sign a piece of paper.\n\n1389\n01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:03,290\nIn this case, sign an electronic pad and\nwe look at the way you sign and\n\n1390\n01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:06,410\nthe inflection and the pressure points and\nthen we can measure that and\n\n1391\n01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,100\nreplicate that over time.\n\n1392\n01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,270\nThings like that would also\nfall into that category.\n\n1393\n01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:15,000\nThose are dynamic, right, and we talk\nabout the difference between the two,\n\n1394\n01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,530\nthe static versus the dynamic solution.\n\n1395\n01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:19,780\nAnd then, or excuse me,\nthe physical characteristics, rather,\n\n1396\n01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,560\nversus the dynamic characteristics.\n\n1397\n01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,610\nAnd then, when we talk about that,\n\n1398\n01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:25,690\nwe also wanna talk about some of\nthe concerns that are involved with this.\n\n1399\n01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:29,950\nWe talk about the idea that validating a\nfingerprint, where you go through a finger\n\n1400\n01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:33,500\nscanner, and I have one on the edge of my\nlaptop that I'm referencing, when I just.\n\n1401\n01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,110\nSwipe my finger down here.\n\n1402\n01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,280\nThat is relatively straightforward.\n\n1403\n01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,610\nAnd as long as you have a good clean\nsurface, meaning the finger doesn't have\n\n1404\n01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:44,500\na lot of dirt on it, or oil, or things\nlike that, the reader surface is clean.\n\n1405\n01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,470\nUsually get a relatively good scan\nas long as you run your finger.\n\n1406\n01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,530\nFairly evenly across the scanner,\nyou're not jumping around or moving,\n\n1407\n01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:51,820\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1408\n01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,260\nBut we want to talk about accuracy.\n\n1409\n01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,020\nAccuracy is very important.\n\n1410\n01:10:55,020 --> 01:11:00,210\nAnd this idea of false reject and\nfalse accept rates becomes very important.\n\n1411\n01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:04,590\nNot just necessarily the fingerprints, but\nin general with any bio-metric solution.\n\n1412\n01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:10,780\nAnd so false reject rates, where we will\neffectively reject somebody that doesn't\n\n1413\n01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:14,340\nbelong getting in even though, right,\nin theory they're supposed to be there.\n\n1414\n01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,600\nWe say, nope sorry.\n\n1415\n01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,410\nYou're not supposed to get in.\n\n1416\n01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:17,240\nYou're not really Don,\n\n1417\n01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,020\nI can't let you into the system even\nthough Don may be authorized as a user.\n\n1418\n01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,190\nNow, that's bad, right?\n\n1419\n01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:25,520\nBut the reality is that's better\nthan a false accept rate, right?\n\n1420\n01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,870\nBecause a false accept rate, or\n\n1421\n01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:31,355\nfalse accept issue is where we allow\nsomeone in under false pretenses.\n\n1422\n01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:34,235\nMeaning they're not really Don,\nor not really Adam, but\n\n1423\n01:11:34,235 --> 01:11:38,315\nthey do enough to be able to trick us into\nthinking they are that we let them in.\n\n1424\n01:11:38,315 --> 01:11:39,655\nAnd this could be a variety of things.\n\n1425\n01:11:39,655 --> 01:11:43,140\nIt could be that they were able to get\nsomeone's fingerprint and reproduce it It\n\n1426\n01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:49,040\ncould be that they were able to get a,you\nmay have seen movies like Minority Report\n\n1427\n01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,175\nright, and things like that where\nyou hold an eyeball up to a scanner.\n\n1428\n01:11:52,175 --> 01:11:53,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not really like that in\n\n1429\n01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,600\nthe real world by the way.\n\n1430\n01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,550\nThey're a little more sensitive than that.\n\n1431\n01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:59,230\nThe scan doesn't work on an eye\nthat's been removed from the body,\n\n1432\n01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:02,130\nbecause the blood vessel patterns\nchange almost immediately and\n\n1433\n01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,910\nas a result you can't really do that.\n\n1434\n01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:07,320\nBut the ideas that false reject and\nfalse accept becomes really important.\n\n1435\n01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,976\nAnd so what where the two meet in effect.\n\n1436\n01:12:08,976 --> 01:12:13,014\nIf you think of false reject as being,\nlet's say, my hand here, and\n\n1437\n01:12:13,014 --> 01:12:17,471\nfalse accept being this hand here, we see\nthem as being laid out on a matrix or\n\n1438\n01:12:17,471 --> 01:12:20,002\na plot like an XY axis, in effect, right?\n\n1439\n01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,371\nAnd so we look at the two and\n\n1440\n01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:25,058\nthey form Some sort of a parabola or\ncurve as we go through and monitor.\n\n1441\n01:12:25,058 --> 01:12:26,354\nAnd, where the two cross over,\n\n1442\n01:12:26,354 --> 01:12:28,475\nat some point they are gonna\nbe something like this.\n\n1443\n01:12:28,475 --> 01:12:32,370\nAnd, where the junction between the two\nis, is gonna be this area right in here in\n\n1444\n01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:36,153\neffect where I'm circling perhaps you\ncan help me Don, and circle from you for\n\n1445\n01:12:36,153 --> 01:12:36,925\njust a moment.\n\n1446\n01:12:36,925 --> 01:12:38,795\nPoint to the two spots.\n\n1447\n01:12:38,795 --> 01:12:40,735\nRight so it's that.\n\n1448\n01:12:40,735 --> 01:12:42,355\nWhere the two are, right where we do that,\n\n1449\n01:12:42,355 --> 01:12:45,715\nwe need a third hand to be able to do\nsome of these complicated graphics.\n\n1450\n01:12:45,715 --> 01:12:48,655\nWe talked about what's known\nas a crossover error rate or\n\n1451\n01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:51,175\na CER, this is very important as well.\n\n1452\n01:12:51,175 --> 01:12:54,465\nThe crossover error rate,\nis the place where the false accept and\n\n1453\n01:12:54,465 --> 01:12:56,595\nthe false reject line up and\n\n1454\n01:12:56,595 --> 01:13:00,330\nthat's where the two x y coordinates\nintersect in effect and as a result,\n\n1455\n01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:05,160\nwe look to measure that as a measured\naccuracy and efficacy of these systems.\n\n1456\n01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,220\nBecause if the crossover\nerror rate is too high,\n\n1457\n01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,780\nwe have too many false accepts to many\nfalse rejects, that's a bad thing.\n\n1458\n01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:13,880\nWe want that number to go down or\ntrend down, as low as possible.\n\n1459\n01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,200\nEspecially, on the false accepts.\n\n1460\n01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,350\nWe got to get those down\nas low as possible.\n\n1461\n01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:21,410\n>> You know I think to really\ndrive home this point.\n\n1462\n01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:26,070\nWe should grab one of the cast, and\nactually try the eyeball thing.\n\n1463\n01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:27,099\n>> You think so?\n>> I think we really should.\n\n1464\n01:13:27,099 --> 01:13:29,515\n>> Do we have a volunteer?\n\n1465\n01:13:29,515 --> 01:13:32,980\n>> [LAUGH] Grab our producer, and, anyhow.\n\n1466\n01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,130\n>> But you get the general idea, right?\n\n1467\n01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:36,190\nAll kidding aside.\n\n1468\n01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:39,940\nRight we don't want people clearly\nthinking, that just because they can go up\n\n1469\n01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:43,540\nand perhaps get a scan done that that's\ngonna mean they automatically get it.\n\n1470\n01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:46,520\nWe tend to come back to this\nidea of defense in depth.\n\n1471\n01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,010\nWe may put the scan in place, right,\nwe may use the bio-metrics but\n\n1472\n01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,780\nthen we want to have\nsomething else besides that.\n\n1473\n01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,870\nWant to have common sense.\n\n1474\n01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:55,820\nMaybe have a guard monitoring a door,\nthrough a video feed and\n\n1475\n01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:59,890\nif somebody walks up and looks like they\nare being forced to put their face up\n\n1476\n01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:03,730\nagainst the plate to do a scan, right,\nwe want to then use common sense and\n\n1477\n01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,480\nsay maybe we should lock out the system\nand investigate why that's going on.\n\n1478\n01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,270\nThose kind of things.\n\n1479\n01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:09,580\n>> I have a great example\nwhich was right here.\n\n1480\n01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:12,190\nWe use a fingerprint scanner for\nfor out time-clock.\n\n1481\n01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:15,690\nWhen you come into the IT Pro TV studios,\nif you're a paid employee, at least.\n\n1482\n01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:17,720\nYou scan your finger on the way in.\n\n1483\n01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,550\nAnd, it's on the other\nside of the hall here.\n\n1484\n01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:24,160\nAnd in the morning, we'd have the studio\ndoor open, and I would hear, just over and\n\n1485\n01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,310\nover again, access reject.\n\n1486\n01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:27,410\nAccess rejected.\n\n1487\n01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:30,860\nAnd the finger scanner just\nwasn't doing a great job of\n\n1488\n01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,260\nrecognizing our people\nthe way it was supposed to.\n\n1489\n01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,320\nAnd so it was a lot of false rejects.\n\n1490\n01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,090\nNow like you said,\nbetter than a false accept.\n\n1491\n01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:41,550\nIt wasn't clocking in other people but\nI could hear it, it was annoying as heck.\n\n1492\n01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,910\nAnd we replaced the time-clock and\n\n1493\n01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:47,570\nwe replaced with with a new one that\nhad a finer fingerprint scanner on it.\n\n1494\n01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:51,110\nAnd now, I don't know that I've heard an\naccess rejection since we've replaced it.\n\n1495\n01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:51,740\nYou monitor it,\n\n1496\n01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:55,200\nyou keep an eye on it, and for that, it\nwas just a matter of convenience, right?\n\n1497\n01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:59,220\nIt wasn't so much that it weakened\nsecurity or something but\n\n1498\n01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,930\nthese are still concerns that\nwe need to take into account.\n\n1499\n01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,842\n>> Absolutely, you wanna have it.\n\n1500\n01:15:02,842 --> 01:15:06,280\nLet's just quickly talk about\nthe different mechanisms, or, excuse me,\n\n1501\n01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,850\nthe types of scans in effect, is what I\nmean to say, that we wanna go through.\n\n1502\n01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,970\nCuz it's important for\nyou to know what's out there.\n\n1503\n01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:14,100\nAgain, you probably\ndon't use all of these.\n\n1504\n01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,842\nI find it very rare that I go to a company\nor I work with a customer, that's gonna\n\n1505\n01:15:17,842 --> 01:15:21,585\nhave more than two or three of these and\nplay it any one time, and there's a pool\n\n1506\n01:15:21,585 --> 01:15:24,966\nof a bunch of them that could be used,\nbut as a practitioner out there.\n\n1507\n01:15:24,966 --> 01:15:28,088\nCertainly somebody whose\ninterested in becoming an SSCP you\n\n1508\n01:15:28,088 --> 01:15:32,310\nwanna know the laundry list of the kinds\nof bio-metric solutions that may be found\n\n1509\n01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:35,665\nin one or more of these companies\nthat you go to do work.\n\n1510\n01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,145\nWe know the fingerprint scan, right?\n\n1511\n01:15:37,145 --> 01:15:40,645\nFingerprints are unique, they're seen as\nbeing a unique identifier, have been for\n\n1512\n01:15:40,645 --> 01:15:44,285\nmany years, you use some sort of a reader\nto scan one or more of the fingers\n\n1513\n01:15:44,285 --> 01:15:48,960\nacross it, and then we go to a database\nthat stores predetermined images of those.\n\n1514\n01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,300\nDoes a quick comparison,\nlooks at the ridges on the fingerprint,\n\n1515\n01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,120\ngets identity points,\nand then matches you up.\n\n1516\n01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,930\nThe scan takes typically five,\nmaybe seven seconds,\n\n1517\n01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:59,900\ndepending on the sensitivity\nof the system.\n\n1518\n01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,640\nBut it's a very straightforward solution.\n\n1519\n01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,330\nAs I mentioned so straight forward now\nthat you're finding them on iPhone right\n\n1520\n01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:07,950\nup on many other devices and so\nhand geometry a little bit different.\n\n1521\n01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:12,060\nHand geometry is gonna focus\non the entire hand, right.\n\n1522\n01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,530\nAs opposed to just the individual finger,\nwhichever finger it may be.\n\n1523\n01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:18,500\nWe have a camera typically embedded\nin the reader that's gonna take\n\n1524\n01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,050\na picture of the palm side.\n\n1525\n01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:23,440\nThe downside of your hand here, right,\nthis area that I'm focusing on right here,\n\n1526\n01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,930\nand then we're gonna try to\nsee one as we're talking.\n\n1527\n01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:29,670\nAnd typically, as a result we're then\ngonna be able to measure the length,\n\n1528\n01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:33,890\nthe width, the thickness of the [COUGH]\ncontour of the fingers, right, so\n\n1529\n01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,300\nall the different areas.\n\n1530\n01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:40,180\nHow these lines are set up, how much space\nthere is, what's the trough and the valley\n\n1531\n01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:43,930\nbetween the fingers, that kind of thing,\nand as a result you can see one there.\n\n1532\n01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:47,810\nThen what we're able to do is be able\nto go in and measure for that, and\n\n1533\n01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:51,690\nagain this is unique by person, and\nrelatively good acceptance rate.\n\n1534\n01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,770\nIt takes about one to three seconds\non average to do a scan like this.\n\n1535\n01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,620\nYou see there's a guide there,\nwhat you're missing,\n\n1536\n01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,670\nit's not very clear in the picture, but\n\n1537\n01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:01,680\nthere are some posts there that\nyou put your fingers down around.\n\n1538\n01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,680\nDon was just pointing to one of them.\n\n1539\n01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,560\nThem, where you actually are gonna have\nto put your fingers down in a splayed\n\n1540\n01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,340\nfashion, so that they're spread out enough\nthat the reader can actually understand\n\n1541\n01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,150\nwhat's going on there.\n\n1542\n01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:11,310\nBut you get the general idea, right?\n\n1543\n01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:13,080\nYou probably have a general idea of that.\n\n1544\n01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,040\nYou could see there's a plate you\ncould scan up against as well.\n\n1545\n01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,030\nDepending on the kind\nof reader that you get.\n\n1546\n01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,150\nSo that's hand geometry.\n\n1547\n01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:25,380\nRetina scanning, will be this\nidea of analyzing blood vessel\n\n1548\n01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,630\npatterns that are on the inside\nrear portion, right,\n\n1549\n01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:30,890\nthe eyeball; the inside rear portion\nof your eyeball is called the retina.\n\n1550\n01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,920\nWe use a little low level light source\nto shoot a beam of light from a camera.\n\n1551\n01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,827\nThrough your eyes, so you typically put\nyour face up into some sort of a reader.\n\n1552\n01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:41,653\nThere's typically a little chin guard\nyou rest on, and it kind of scans.\n\n1553\n01:17:41,653 --> 01:17:44,721\nI don't know if you guys\nout there watch NCIS.\n\n1554\n01:17:44,721 --> 01:17:45,398\nIt's a program.\n\n1555\n01:17:45,398 --> 01:17:46,439\nIf you ever watch NCIS,\n\n1556\n01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:49,616\na lot of the times, when they're going\ninto the secure command area, or\n\n1557\n01:17:49,616 --> 01:17:53,440\ngoing down into the basement there, where\nthey do all of the analysis for stuff.\n\n1558\n01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,170\nThey have the retina scan reader.\n\n1559\n01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,570\nYou actually see them doing\na retina scan on the show.\n\n1560\n01:17:57,570 --> 01:18:01,100\nAnd one of the agents puts their face up\nagainst the scan, the light comes out, and\n\n1561\n01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,210\nscans the eye.\n\n1562\n01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,680\nAnd then allows them in, assuming that\nit's actually gonna prove who you are.\n\n1563\n01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,900\nIt's considered very accurate, it's very\ndifficult, almost impossible by today's\n\n1564\n01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:14,180\nstandards, regardless of what you see in\nthe movies to trick a retina scanner, so\n\n1565\n01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:18,360\nbasically we're gonna consider that to be\nan infallible solution at least for today.\n\n1566\n01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,140\nThe one thing that can\nreally get complicated here,\n\n1567\n01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:24,700\nis if you have something that impacts\nthe integrity of the eye, so for instance,\n\n1568\n01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:28,050\nif you have glaucoma, or you have\na disease that may change the blood vessel\n\n1569\n01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:30,560\npattern you then tend to skew the scan.\n\n1570\n01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,380\nAnd we then have to re-scan you in\norder to be able to understand that and\n\n1571\n01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,500\nbe aware of that.\n\n1572\n01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,690\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n1573\n01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:38,710\nThe difference between that about four to\nseven seconds on average by the way for\n\n1574\n01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:43,620\nthat, the iris scan is gonna record\nthe unique color pattern in the eye so.\n\n1575\n01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:44,320\nJust be aware of that.\n\n1576\n01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,360\nThat will be the coloring of\nthe eye that typically you have.\n\n1577\n01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,160\nMine are a pretty brown hazel.\n\n1578\n01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,360\nDon, what do we have there for you,\n\n1579\n01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,671\nyou've got like a greyish\n>> Yeah.\n\n1580\n01:18:51,671 --> 01:18:53,077\n[LAUGH]\n>> Kind of a grayish bluish\n\n1581\n01:18:53,077 --> 01:18:53,748\nthing going on.\n\n1582\n01:18:53,748 --> 01:18:57,148\nWe would scan out differently just\nbecause the color pattern in our eye, and\n\n1583\n01:18:57,148 --> 01:19:00,071\nthe pattern of the associated dots\nthat make it up are different so\n\n1584\n01:19:00,071 --> 01:19:02,860\nyou'd be able to tell between\nus in effect what that is.\n\n1585\n01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:04,870\nAlso considered very accurate, and\n\n1586\n01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:08,830\nused a lot depending on the kind of\ntechnology that is gonna be deployed.\n\n1587\n01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:12,500\nFacial recognition,\nthis is where we scan the entire face, and\n\n1588\n01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,770\nas a result we build a composite model\nof what the face looks like, and\n\n1589\n01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:18,360\nthen we max out against\nknown scans in a database.\n\n1590\n01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:22,000\nThis is being used today for\nidentity management in airports and\n\n1591\n01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,440\nlarge public venues.\n\n1592\n01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,690\nThere's a lot of this going on for\nthings like the Superbowl and\n\n1593\n01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:29,170\nstuff like that where they're constantly\nlooking in the crowd to see who's there.\n\n1594\n01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:29,910\nThose kind of things.\n\n1595\n01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:30,930\nThat's being done.\n\n1596\n01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:33,240\nIt's also done sometimes in data centers.\n\n1597\n01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:37,600\nVery highly secured data centers\nare using facial scan recognition for\n\n1598\n01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,820\nmaking sure that only certain\npeople are allowed in.\n\n1599\n01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,790\nWe talked about voice pattern recognition.\n\n1600\n01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:44,210\nScanning a voice pattern of some kind.\n\n1601\n01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:46,530\nYou're typically given a paragraph or\n\n1602\n01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:49,180\nseveral lines of text to read to\nset up the scan on the system.\n\n1603\n01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:53,290\nAnd then you're gonna have to repeat that\nor talk through that over a five to maybe\n\n1604\n01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:56,820\n15 second sample so\nthen generate that voice pattern.\n\n1605\n01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:59,920\nThis also can vary because if you're sick,\nif you're voice gets raspy.\n\n1606\n01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,690\nThere are certain parameters we can\nadjust for, but if you've had problems,\n\n1607\n01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:06,880\nhealth problems or injuries that affect\nthe voice box, then obviously you may\n\n1608\n01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,890\nnot be able to scan in as a result so\nyou want to be aware of that.\n\n1609\n01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:13,440\nWe talked about keystroke dynamics and\nbeing to do the whole typing thing.\n\n1610\n01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,530\nYou're typically given\na paragraph of text.\n\n1611\n01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:16,317\nYou'd have to type it in.\n\n1612\n01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:19,230\nWe measure the time,\nas well as the pressure on the keys and\n\n1613\n01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,665\na bunch of other variables.\n\n1614\n01:20:20,665 --> 01:20:24,471\nAnd then as a result of that, we're\nable to build a composite for you and\n\n1615\n01:20:24,471 --> 01:20:25,745\nfigure out who you are.\n\n1616\n01:20:25,745 --> 01:20:28,351\nAgain if you injure your hands,\nthings like that, right?\n\n1617\n01:20:28,351 --> 01:20:31,483\nThose could obviously lead to\nproblems where you're going to be\n\n1618\n01:20:31,483 --> 01:20:34,270\nable to reference your scan and\ntry to get back in.\n\n1619\n01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:36,026\nSo think about that and be aware of that.\n\n1620\n01:20:36,026 --> 01:20:39,780\nSignature dynamics we mentioned as well,\nthis is where you go and you sign,\n\n1621\n01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,710\ntypically, on a pad of some kind.\n\n1622\n01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:44,150\nWe look at the pressure and\nthe signature points.\n\n1623\n01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:46,520\nThere's four or five different\ndata points we'll measure there.\n\n1624\n01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:50,150\nSpeed direction, stroke force,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1625\n01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,930\nWe do that a lot as well.\n\n1626\n01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:55,680\nObviously, understand advantages are that\nclearly unique to the individual.\n\n1627\n01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,990\nDisadvantages are environmental and\nor injury and\n\n1628\n01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:02,430\nhealth concerns could get in the way of\nsomebody's scans in highly secure areas,\n\n1629\n01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:04,520\nso we have to be aware\nof those things also.\n\n1630\n01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,840\n>> And there's some privacy issues that\nhave been brought up recently like if\n\n1631\n01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,970\nyou're gonna do finger print scanning then\nyour finger print needs to be stored in\n\n1632\n01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:13,630\nthe systems somewhere and so\nnow you have to worry about\n\n1633\n01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:17,165\nhaving that fingerprint stored somewhere\nthat may or may not, be secure and\n\n1634\n01:21:17,165 --> 01:21:19,455\nthat's why a lot of these systems try and\nfind a way around that.\n\n1635\n01:21:19,455 --> 01:21:21,555\nFor example, you'll see systems.\n\n1636\n01:21:21,555 --> 01:21:22,835\nI think the iPhone does it.\n\n1637\n01:21:22,835 --> 01:21:26,165\nI know our time clock does it where\ninstead of storing the entire fingerprint,\n\n1638\n01:21:26,165 --> 01:21:28,455\nit just stores five or ten points or\n\n1639\n01:21:28,455 --> 01:21:33,095\n20 points whatever it is to identify that\nprint instead of the whole print itself.\n\n1640\n01:21:33,095 --> 01:21:35,305\nAnd again just to help protect for\nprivacy concern.\n\n1641\n01:21:35,305 --> 01:21:38,795\nAnd so a number of different things we\nhave to think about when we select which\n\n1642\n01:21:38,795 --> 01:21:39,835\none of these is gonna be right for\n\n1643\n01:21:39,835 --> 01:21:41,920\nour organization\n>> Absolutely, and so\n\n1644\n01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,090\nlet's add one more thing onto the list\nthere before we maybe take a break and\n\n1645\n01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:47,220\ncome back and\ndo another discussion on this.\n\n1646\n01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:50,820\nThe idea of single sign on is also\nsomething that we want to focus on and\n\n1647\n01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:51,640\nbe aware of.\n\n1648\n01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,646\nGenerically a term we hear a lot\nwhen we talk about security today,\n\n1649\n01:21:54,646 --> 01:21:57,190\nthis idea of sign-in once,\naccess menu, right?\n\n1650\n01:21:57,190 --> 01:21:59,270\nAs we think about that and\nwhat that means.\n\n1651\n01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:03,190\nAnd so we log in or authenticate through\nwhatever mechanisms we use to a central\n\n1652\n01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:06,340\nsystem, a directory system\nis sitting on the back-end.\n\n1653\n01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:09,670\nAgain, any LDAP directory,\nit doesn't have to be a Windows one.\n\n1654\n01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:12,390\nAnd once we authenticate,\nwe then are given rights and\n\n1655\n01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:15,640\npermissions through typically\na token associated with our user ID.\n\n1656\n01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,690\nAnd that token travels with us,\n\n1657\n01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:20,850\ntypically in a static fashion,\nwe knew that token has to be regenerated.\n\n1658\n01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:23,960\nIf we want to update our permissions\nin real time, we log off, log back in.\n\n1659\n01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:28,120\nAnd that single sign on solution\nallows us to access that information,\n\n1660\n01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,040\nacross the entire enterprise,\nnot just in one area, but\n\n1661\n01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,350\nin any of the areas that\nwe may need to go into.\n\n1662\n01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:37,270\nIn Windows we typically hear it referred\nto by being used with the Kerberos\n\n1663\n01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:39,610\nsolution and\nKerberos is not a Windows thing.\n\n1664\n01:22:39,610 --> 01:22:41,090\nMicrosoft didn't invent Kerberos.\n\n1665\n01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,110\nThey borrowed it.\n\n1666\n01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:46,664\nIt's actually an open source solution\noriginally developed at MIT under the code\n\n1667\n01:22:46,664 --> 01:22:47,924\nname Project Athena.\n\n1668\n01:22:47,924 --> 01:22:50,160\nAnd that's what it was\noriginally referred to as.\n\n1669\n01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:54,440\nBut the ideas that it represents,\nthis idea of authentication with a central\n\n1670\n01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:58,500\ndirectory service, and then time-stamped\ntickets that are used to be able to grant\n\n1671\n01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:03,080\naccess to you typically over a several\nhour or several day session.\n\n1672\n01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,410\nDepending on how often\nyou log in an log out.\n\n1673\n01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:06,985\nWe just want to make sure\nwe're aware of that but\n\n1674\n01:23:06,985 --> 01:23:12,380\nKerberos does use time stamp tickets for\nbasically judicating access control and\n\n1675\n01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:16,980\nthe single sign on solution, is very\nefficient if it set up the right way and\n\n1676\n01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,760\nscaled out for\nthe appropriate number of servers.\n\n1677\n01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,360\nThere can be bottle necks if you don't\nhave the right number of servers logging\n\n1678\n01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,890\nin things can so slow down.\n\n1679\n01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:26,570\nWe see, time and\ndown time being issues there.\n\n1680\n01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:30,880\nTypically, it's considered a stronger\nsolution than just passwords, so\n\n1681\n01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,700\nthat is a good thing when we use\na single sign-on solution, because then,\n\n1682\n01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:38,210\nwe're gonna authenticate across the entire\nenterprise, not have to remember ten,\n\n1683\n01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:40,920\n20 different passwords to get\nto different information.\n\n1684\n01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,556\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1685\n01:23:41,556 --> 01:23:45,195\n>> And if you find yourself in a situation\nwhere you need to terminate an employee,\n\n1686\n01:23:45,195 --> 01:23:48,564\n[CROSSTALK] ,you just go to one place,\nthat one directory versus all those\n\n1687\n01:23:48,564 --> 01:23:51,526\nindividual systems, so\ndefinitely a lot of advantages there.\n\n1688\n01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,980\n>> So a lot of times\ntypically managed through HR.\n\n1689\n01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:57,900\nHR will have the ERP systems in place,\nand typically be able to do that or\n\n1690\n01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,950\nmanage that for\nyou on behalf of the organization.\n\n1691\n01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,730\nJust some things for us to think about and\n\n1692\n01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:06,480\nreally wrap up that part of our\ndiscussion, around this idea of access,\n\n1693\n01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,320\naccess control, authentication through\nknowledge, authentication through\n\n1694\n01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,640\nthings that we are, we have and\nwe know are all very important solutions.\n\n1695\n01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,590\n>> All right well,\nwhy don't we stop and take a break here.\n\n1696\n01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:19,570\nWe got just a few more things to\nget to before we wrap this one up.\n\n1697\n01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:24,110\nJust a couple of odds and ends that ISC\nsquare likes to throw in on the end we'll\n\n1698\n01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:31,370\ntackle those stay tuned,\nwe will be right back after this.\n\n1699\n01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:37,735\nAll right welcome back everybody so\nwe left off.\n\n1700\n01:24:37,735 --> 01:24:39,987\nTalking a little bit about Kerberos.\n\n1701\n01:24:39,987 --> 01:24:43,465\nOr Kerberosor how we're willing\nto say it and [LAUGH] and\n\n1702\n01:24:43,465 --> 01:24:46,315\nwe've had this ongoing debate here on\nthis show on how to pronounce it and\n\n1703\n01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:48,595\nwe looked it up one day and\nwe didn't believe it.\n\n1704\n01:24:48,595 --> 01:24:49,870\nSo we still make up our own.\n\n1705\n01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:51,411\nSo [LAUGH]\n>> Fair\n\n1706\n01:24:51,411 --> 01:24:52,780\nenough\n>> But\n\n1707\n01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:53,818\nwe didn't go into all that-\n\n1708\n01:24:53,818 --> 01:24:54,750\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n1709\n01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,630\nWe didn't go into all that\nmuch depth on it, right?\n\n1710\n01:24:56,630 --> 01:25:00,040\nWe wanna take a deeper look\nat Kerberos and how it works.\n\n1711\n01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,030\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n1712\n01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:04,230\nIt's really important that we have\nan understanding of the process\n\n1713\n01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:08,100\ninvolved in what Kerberos is gonna\nmean to us in terms of authentication.\n\n1714\n01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,720\nAnd then the challenge response that\ngoes on but also the way in which we\n\n1715\n01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,940\ncreate the tickets and how those tickets\nare exchanged and what that means.\n\n1716\n01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:18,250\nSo the key components of Kerberos\nare gonna be what's know as a KDC,\n\n1717\n01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,730\na Key Distribution Center.\n\n1718\n01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:24,260\nThis is typically gonna be a server,\nnot typically is a server I should say.\n\n1719\n01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:28,400\nThat's gonna really play two roles, an\nauthentication server, so it's gonna have\n\n1720\n01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,780\nability to do authentication for us, and\nbe able to make sure that it does that.\n\n1721\n01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:35,200\nAnd it also has this ticket granting role.\n\n1722\n01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,220\nIt's gonna give tickets out to\npeople ultimately, subjects.\n\n1723\n01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:42,220\nUsers that are gonna be\nauthenticating through the system.\n\n1724\n01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:45,015\nWe're gonna delve in and talk about both\nof these, and I think we're gonna put\n\n1725\n01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:48,135\na little picture up that's just gonna help\nus look at the different steps involved,\n\n1726\n01:25:48,135 --> 01:25:50,935\nso that way you guys can see\nas I'm narrating through them,\n\n1727\n01:25:50,935 --> 01:25:53,565\nkinda keep track in your\nmind as to what's happening.\n\n1728\n01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,440\nAlice over there on the left,\nshe'll be our sample user,\n\n1729\n01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,180\nthat's authenticating, and so\na six step process, as you can see.\n\n1730\n01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:03,370\nAnd by the way,\nignore the fact that it says Server 2003.\n\n1731\n01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:06,370\nThis would be the same for\nServer 2008, or even Server 12,\n\n1732\n01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:10,310\nor the same if you're doing a Linux\nbased solution using Kerberos.\n\n1733\n01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:12,670\nCuz again, Kerberos is not a Microsoft.\n\n1734\n01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:16,070\nExclusive technology, it's just that\nthey've adopted it as the primary\n\n1735\n01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,900\nauthentication mechanism\ninside of windows.\n\n1736\n01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:22,920\nSo the idea here is that Alice,\nsends a request out\n\n1737\n01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,700\nto authenticate into the system and\nstep one as you could see there,\n\n1738\n01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:32,180\nrequesting what's known as a TGT, a Ticket\nGranting Ticket is what TGT stands for.\n\n1739\n01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:36,750\nAnd that request goes over to a server\nbased domain directory controller.\n\n1740\n01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:40,230\nIn our case, in Windows, it will be an\nactive directory based domain controller.\n\n1741\n01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:44,112\nAnd a generic solution will be\na directory server of any kind.\n\n1742\n01:26:44,112 --> 01:26:47,570\nThe KDC as you could see there is\nthe domain controller in Windows, so\n\n1743\n01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,850\nthey are one in the same.\n\n1744\n01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:51,310\nAnd that is the AS,\nthe authentication server,\n\n1745\n01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:55,430\nplus the TGS at the bottom there on the\nright, the ticket granting solution, or\n\n1746\n01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:59,450\nticket granting server,\nthat role is embodied in the KDC.\n\n1747\n01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:03,680\nAnd so as a result, that request for\na ticket Is issued to the domain.\n\n1748\n01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,220\nThe domain controller, looks at the user\ncredentials being put in as part of\n\n1749\n01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:11,890\nthe request, goes through checks and\nvalidates the user identity,\n\n1750\n01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:15,410\nchecks the user's information,\nin other words against the LDAP provider.\n\n1751\n01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:19,230\nAnd then in step two coming back the other\nway we see the Ticket-Granting Ticket\n\n1752\n01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:23,130\nbeing issued to Alice,\nand we also see a session\n\n1753\n01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:26,680\nkey which is added on the end ,being\nissued as part of the ticket.\n\n1754\n01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:31,300\nThe session key is a unique identifier\nthat allows that ticket to be used\n\n1755\n01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:34,660\nduring this exchange of information,\nbut uniquely identifies it so\n\n1756\n01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,230\nit can't be used for other stuff.\n\n1757\n01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:40,640\nSo in effect, it's like a GUID,\na global unique ID, or UUID.\n\n1758\n01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,910\nA universal ID,\ndepending on where you come from, or\n\n1759\n01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:48,120\nwhat you know that as In step three,\nAlice then is gonna send that request for\n\n1760\n01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:52,210\na ticket now that's she's gotten\nthe original concept of the ticket back\n\n1761\n01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:55,180\nmeaning Kerberos has effectively\nauthenticated her as a user and\n\n1762\n01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:58,950\nsaid okay, we're giving you the ability\nto be able to use the system.\n\n1763\n01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:02,100\nThat's what the TGT,\nthe Ticket Granting Ticket does.\n\n1764\n01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:06,026\nBut Alice is yet to access a resource,\nshe's just basically been given the right\n\n1765\n01:28:06,026 --> 01:28:09,392\nIn effect to request access that's\nwhat the first two steps are for.\n\n1766\n01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:13,873\nStep three request ticket and\nauthentication, she goes back to the KDC,\n\n1767\n01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:18,642\nback to the domain controller again,\nTGT, ticket granting ticket in hand and\n\n1768\n01:28:18,642 --> 01:28:21,768\nsays hey I need to access\nthis particular service.\n\n1769\n01:28:21,768 --> 01:28:24,485\nMaybe it's DNS, maybe it's DHCP.\n\n1770\n01:28:24,485 --> 01:28:27,289\nMaybe it is a file and print service.\n\n1771\n01:28:27,289 --> 01:28:32,050\nWhatever it is, she has a request to go do\nsomething inside the system that requires\n\n1772\n01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:35,880\na ticket in order to authenticate\nher to access that service.\n\n1773\n01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,875\nSo she makes that request in step 3.\n\n1774\n01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:42,755\nAgain, we go through the process on\nthe ticket granting side of doing\n\n1775\n01:28:42,755 --> 01:28:43,945\na challenge response.\n\n1776\n01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:47,115\nWe check to see who she is, check to\nmake sure her credentials in this,\n\n1777\n01:28:47,115 --> 01:28:48,255\nor ticket granting ticket,\n\n1778\n01:28:48,255 --> 01:28:51,807\nand her session key are valid during\nthe session we're establishing.\n\n1779\n01:28:51,807 --> 01:28:56,667\nWe then send back from the KBC side\na ticket, step number four, and\n\n1780\n01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:59,727\nanother session key that allows her to now\n\n1781\n01:28:59,727 --> 01:29:03,307\ntake the step of going in step\nfive down to a resource server,\n\n1782\n01:29:03,307 --> 01:29:06,497\nwhere ever that particular service\nis that Alice wants to access.\n\n1783\n01:29:06,497 --> 01:29:08,752\nIt could be a web server,\ncould be an email server,\n\n1784\n01:29:08,752 --> 01:29:11,017\ncould be a share point server,\ncould be anything.\n\n1785\n01:29:11,017 --> 01:29:12,400\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n1786\n01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,600\nAnd she's gonna send that\nticket that she has gotten\n\n1787\n01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,630\nfrom step four down to the resource\nserver and say, hey I have a ticket.\n\n1788\n01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:22,510\nI need access to resources.\n\n1789\n01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:26,720\nMy authentication, in other words,\nplus my request equals access.\n\n1790\n01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:29,770\nThe resource server is going\nto authenticate Alice,\n\n1791\n01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:33,450\nthat's what happens in the step\n5 transition into step 6.\n\n1792\n01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:37,330\nAuthentication comes back up the other\nway, and Alice, at that point, although\n\n1793\n01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:41,750\nit's not on the diagram but in step 7, in\ntheory, if we added one, would be granted\n\n1794\n01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:45,120\naccess to the resources, whatever those\nare and then be able to use them.\n\n1795\n01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:49,730\nAnd so this exchange of going through\nthe Kerberos solution allows Alice to\n\n1796\n01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:54,650\nauthenticate, provide identity credentials\nthat are validated, get the permission\n\n1797\n01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:59,490\nto access resources then go request\naccess to that specific resource,\n\n1798\n01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:01,560\nbe given that and\nthen go get the resource.\n\n1799\n01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,310\nSo a multistep process.\n\n1800\n01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:06,960\n>> And one of the big powerful\nthings about this process is,\n\n1801\n01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,990\nthat is basically a single sign on.\n\n1802\n01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:12,490\nShe's not having to re-log in every\ntime she accesses another server,\n\n1803\n01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,700\nshe's handing off that same token.\n\n1804\n01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,130\nAnd if someone were to\nintercept that token,\n\n1805\n01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:18,720\nthat sounds like it would\nbe a really bad thing,\n\n1806\n01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:23,490\nright, but Kerberos actually uses\nthe time stamp to modify that with each\n\n1807\n01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:27,770\nticket that it's sending out so\nthese tickets really can't be reused.\n\n1808\n01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,780\nIt's got that protection built in,\nvery intelligently designed and\n\n1809\n01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:32,990\nit's perfectly suited for\nthis type of use.\n\n1810\n01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:33,910\n>> Now one thing to be aware of,\n\n1811\n01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:36,650\nthere is definitely that fail safe\nmechanism around time stamping,\n\n1812\n01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:40,150\nvery important but there are a couple\nof dos and don'ts with Kerberos.\n\n1813\n01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:43,760\nSo when we talk about setting up the\ndefense and depth and it's an idea we've\n\n1814\n01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,990\nwe've put out there for you to consider\nin several different conversations.\n\n1815\n01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:49,035\nThe idea here would be,\n\n1816\n01:30:49,035 --> 01:30:53,060\nKerberos systems are very weak in\none respect, time synchronization.\n\n1817\n01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:56,510\nAnd so the key that we have to think about\nfrom a defense and depth perspective and\n\n1818\n01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:59,770\nfrom an attack and risk and\nvulnerability and threat perspective is\n\n1819\n01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:04,860\nif somebody can decouple, change the time\nsynchronization inside of our systems,\n\n1820\n01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,730\nthey can effectively derail\nthis authentication process.\n\n1821\n01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:10,460\nIt's not the end of the world because all\nwe have to do is resynchronize our domain\n\n1822\n01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:13,340\ncontrollers and\neverything starts working again but\n\n1823\n01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:16,380\none of the distributed denial of service,\nor denial of service attacks we see\n\n1824\n01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:21,300\nagainst Kerberos, is basically knocking\nout the NTP of the network time solution.\n\n1825\n01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:24,540\nWhether it's domain controller\nsynchronizing to an NTP server,\n\n1826\n01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,470\nor the domain synchronizing to the domain\ncontrollers, however you do that.\n\n1827\n01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:31,570\nIf we can decouple them by more\nthan five minutes by default, and\n\n1828\n01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:35,200\nthis is a variable time length with\nKerberos based on how we set it up but\n\n1829\n01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,890\nout of the box, it's five minutes.\n\n1830\n01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:40,032\nIf we could decouple those time\nsynchronizations by more than five\n\n1831\n01:31:40,032 --> 01:31:44,028\nminutes, in other words skew the timing,\nwe actually stop Kerberos from working.\n\n1832\n01:31:44,028 --> 01:31:47,689\nAnd it's not bad for people that are\nalready authenticated in because they can\n\n1833\n01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:51,519\naccess resources they've already touched,\nthey just can't access new ones but\n\n1834\n01:31:51,519 --> 01:31:55,015\nanybody that looks to authenticate in\nat that point will be denied access so\n\n1835\n01:31:55,015 --> 01:31:56,533\nwe can synchronize the domain.\n\n1836\n01:31:56,533 --> 01:32:00,041\nSo, just keep that in mind as an issue\nthere and kind an off on the side or\n\n1837\n01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:03,370\noff on the side business case that\nyou have to be aware of from a do and\n\n1838\n01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:04,970\ndon't perspective.\n\n1839\n01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:07,870\nThe other thing to think about with\nKerberos is the variable length of time\n\n1840\n01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:12,880\nthat the tickets live for, we call\nthe TTL because his is also important and\n\n1841\n01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,370\nthe TTL or time to live variable,\nwe see TTL's in many things, has to be\n\n1842\n01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:22,330\nconsidered because as Don was pointing\nout, we put a time bomb in that ticket and\n\n1843\n01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:25,810\nset it to go off at a certain point in\nthe and the tickets no longer valid.\n\n1844\n01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:29,570\nThat time could be up to seven\ndays depending on the length and\n\n1845\n01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:32,990\nduration of how we set this up\nplus a 12 hour increment for\n\n1846\n01:32:32,990 --> 01:32:34,450\nthe initial session we're in.\n\n1847\n01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:36,700\nSo that ticket could last for\nalmost a full or\n\n1848\n01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:41,070\nactually more than a full week if we don't\nlog off, meaning if a work station is left\n\n1849\n01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:45,350\nlogged on under the user account that\nhas that ticket, you theoretically could\n\n1850\n01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:49,650\nwalk up, log into the system if it's\nlogged out and get access to resources.\n\n1851\n01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:53,960\nSo we do have to consider this as well and\nthink about what our policy is.\n\n1852\n01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:58,620\nThat locks out desktops and mandates auto\nlog offs as part of a process of defensive\n\n1853\n01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:02,600\ndepth around these kind of technologies\nso, just be thinking about that as well.\n\n1854\n01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,740\nWe mentioned certificates earlier and\ndirectory based access which obvious just\n\n1855\n01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:08,820\nbeen talking about but understand\nthat although it's not a component\n\n1856\n01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:11,980\nnecessarily of Kerberos but\ndigital identity generically and\n\n1857\n01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:15,990\nspecifically certificate based access and\nauthentication is another way for\n\n1858\n01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:20,030\nyou to be able to engage in identifying\nwho you are as you look to log in.\n\n1859\n01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:22,950\nSo certificate based\nauthentication solutions will use\n\n1860\n01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:26,100\nthese digital identities we talked\nabout embedded in smart cards, but\n\n1861\n01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,840\nalso will be used to identify users for\n\n1862\n01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:33,880\na variety of things like email signatures,\nso signing email, digitally signing them.\n\n1863\n01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:38,130\nWe take a look at things such as\nidentifying websites and securely\n\n1864\n01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:42,260\nputting a certificate into the store to\nmake sure the website is authentic, right.\n\n1865\n01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:43,800\nSo, things like online banking and\n\n1866\n01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,330\nbill pay may be done with these\nkind of digital certificates.\n\n1867\n01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:49,990\nSo things like that are important to\nthink about as well, and with digital or\n\n1868\n01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:53,370\ndifferent kinds of certificates that\nare used for different kinds of jobs,\n\n1869\n01:33:53,370 --> 01:33:56,370\njust like any other tool that\nwe would seed deployed there.\n\n1870\n01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:58,730\nAny thoughts just about that that\nwe just want to throw up there?\n\n1871\n01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:01,370\nI see we've got some good notes\non certificate based access.\n\n1872\n01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:04,510\n>> We showed a diagram of\nthe Kerberos layout, and\n\n1873\n01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:06,370\nI know we don't want to go to\nfar into it right now, but\n\n1874\n01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:08,540\njust keep in mind with certificates\nyou have what's called a PKI,\n\n1875\n01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:11,730\na public key infrastructure, and there's\na number of components there, cuz you\n\n1876\n01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:15,540\nhave to have a certificate authority\nthat's actually issuing the certificates.\n\n1877\n01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:18,420\nAnd you've got to have a revocation\nlist to track when certificates get\n\n1878\n01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,820\nrevoked, and so on.\n\n1879\n01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:23,820\nSo there's a lot of other pieces that make\nup this solution that we'll see later on.\n\n1880\n01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,310\n>> Absolutely, we'll come back,\nwe'll circle back\n\n1881\n01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:26,790\n>> Matt can talk about those and\n\n1882\n01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:29,960\nDon will have an appropriate graphic,\nprettily designed and full of color for\n\n1883\n01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,890\nyou [LAUGH] when we get to\nthat one as well I'm sure.\n\n1884\n01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:35,875\nSo when we talk about certificates,\nwe talk about directory authentication,\n\n1885\n01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:38,400\nKerberos, any of these\ntechnologies that we use,\n\n1886\n01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,550\nthe one piece that we haven't mentioned\nup until now is this idea of logging and\n\n1887\n01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:44,970\nhow do we keep track of\nthe things that are going on.\n\n1888\n01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:47,900\nSo we want to talk about this\naccountability concept around logging\n\n1889\n01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:52,480\njust quickly to remind ourselves that when\nwe do use this kind of an access method,\n\n1890\n01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,310\nwhatever it is, it doesn't really matter.\n\n1891\n01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:58,130\nThere has to be what we call an audit\ntrail, some sort of way to keep track of\n\n1892\n01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:01,100\nthis stuff, right, and\nto understand that it's going on, both for\n\n1893\n01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:05,160\nhistorical look back if we have a question\nafter the fact, and in real time,\n\n1894\n01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,300\nif there is some sort of a.\n\n1895\n01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:09,960\nA solution interruption,\nwhere somehow, for\n\n1896\n01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,990\nsome reason somebody gets in, and\nas a result we have to go back and\n\n1897\n01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:16,370\nlook at that and find out why,\nwe can get an activity log on the system.\n\n1898\n01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:18,640\nAnd so\nwe see these in a lot of different ways.\n\n1899\n01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:24,110\nThis may be an event log, it could be\nan application log, it could be a security\n\n1900\n01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:27,750\nlog, these are all different logs you're\nprobably very familiar with in Windows or\n\n1901\n01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:31,000\nin Linux, cuz we have logging\ntaking place in both of them.\n\n1902\n01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,570\nAnd we see these all the time.\n\n1903\n01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:36,060\nThe ones we tend to focus on\nare the security logs, more so\n\n1904\n01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:40,030\nthan any of the others but they all can\nprovide a very large amount of information\n\n1905\n01:35:40,030 --> 01:35:44,460\ndepending on the solution that we're\nlooking to take on and to track over time.\n\n1906\n01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:46,200\nSo remember, you wanna review these.\n\n1907\n01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:50,060\nYeah we talk about reviewing them\nproactively as a best practice but\n\n1908\n01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:53,810\nthe reality is you know honestly\njust between myself, Don, you and\n\n1909\n01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:57,460\nthe camera, who has time to look at\neverything proactively on a regular basis.\n\n1910\n01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,190\nIf you did that you would do nothing but\nsit in a room and\n\n1911\n01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:00,580\nnever look at logs right.\n\n1912\n01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:04,350\nSo the reality is at the end of the day\nwe want to make sure we understand that\n\n1913\n01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:07,540\nas it is a recommended best practice\nright so we do want to do that.\n\n1914\n01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:11,050\nWe do also understand that a lot of the\ntimes in the real world this is looked at\n\n1915\n01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:13,140\nafter the fact, reactively but\n\n1916\n01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,590\nthat doesn't mean you shouldn't\nbe thinking about logging.\n\n1917\n01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:16,210\nSet it up.\n\n1918\n01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:17,330\nEnsure you test it.\n\n1919\n01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:19,116\nMake sure you know where\nthe logs are stored.\n\n1920\n01:36:19,116 --> 01:36:20,822\nMake sure you're protecting the logs.\n\n1921\n01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:23,505\nThese are all important\nthings to consider, right,\n\n1922\n01:36:23,505 --> 01:36:27,569\nbecause as a result of that We have that\nhistorical record to go back to over time.\n\n1923\n01:36:27,569 --> 01:36:31,001\nThis plays back into this idea of defense\nin depth that we have been talking about\n\n1924\n01:36:31,001 --> 01:36:34,750\nand really building those systems that\nwill help to protect information.\n\n1925\n01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:36,230\n>> There's a lot of solutions out there.\n\n1926\n01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:39,380\nYou're starting to see that that\nterm SIEM being marketed around.\n\n1927\n01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:40,440\n>> SIEM or SIEM, right.\n\n1928\n01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:44,290\n>> And so you'll see things like the\nsecurity information and event managers\n\n1929\n01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:48,180\nthat will collect these logs for you, and\nbe able to interpret and react on them.\n\n1930\n01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:51,990\nSo you may not be able to monitor these\nlogs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,\n\n1931\n01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:54,700\nbut you may have automated\nsystems that do.\n\n1932\n01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:57,620\nMany organizations though, like you said\nAdam, they just don't look at them at\n\n1933\n01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:00,570\nall until it's too late, right, so\nbeing reactive instead of proactive.\n\n1934\n01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:01,730\n>> Unfortunately not, absolutely.\n\n1935\n01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:06,380\nSo in regards to that and being proactive,\nanother thing we think about often\n\n1936\n01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:09,280\ntimes is how we do with media and\nmedia disposal.\n\n1937\n01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:14,350\nWe talked briefly early on about this idea\nof the fact there may data left on our\n\n1938\n01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:15,600\nUSB drive, or something, right?\n\n1939\n01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,990\nIf we give it to somebody, and\nthat's something to consider.\n\n1940\n01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:21,620\nAnd generically we talk about media\ndisposal as really being this area where\n\n1941\n01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:25,210\nwe have to focus on what's left in\nthe system before we get rid of it.\n\n1942\n01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:27,250\nSo we call that data remnants, and\n\n1943\n01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:31,380\nwe talk about data remaining in the system\nafter a hard drive has been formatted.\n\n1944\n01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:34,950\nThere are mechanisms that allow\nyou to do this in certain ways.\n\n1945\n01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:38,220\nI'd recommend that you think about\nlooking up the NIST standards\n\n1946\n01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,360\non data protection and data management.\n\n1947\n01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:45,090\nNIST is N I S T, the National Institute\nfor Standards and Technology.\n\n1948\n01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:50,830\nAnd so this is a U.S. government based\nsolution, nist.gov would be the website.\n\n1949\n01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:54,930\nAnd so the idea here would be, they have\nstandards published that are used by\n\n1950\n01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:59,330\nthe federal government obviously, and many\nother business that are considered to be\n\n1951\n01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:04,010\nbest practices around a variety of\nareas and data protection and data\n\n1952\n01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:07,810\nmanagement and this idea of media disposal\nis one of the areas that they speak to.\n\n1953\n01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:11,420\nSo things like degaussers,\nwhere you're going to go in and\n\n1954\n01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:14,840\nyou're going to have a very strong\nmagnetic field that is created and\n\n1955\n01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,930\nthen you put the media inside\nthe magnetic field and\n\n1956\n01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:21,230\nwipe, in effect, the Magnetic media\nmeaning wiping out the hard drive.\n\n1957\n01:38:21,230 --> 01:38:21,970\nZeroing it out.\n\n1958\n01:38:21,970 --> 01:38:25,850\nYou often hear it referred to as different\nthings, would be one mechanism or one area\n\n1959\n01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:30,050\nhere and you can see on the screen that\nDon was able to bring up NST website and\n\n1960\n01:38:30,050 --> 01:38:32,740\nyou can see that there\nare different draft documents.\n\n1961\n01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:33,840\nThey all have numbers by the way.\n\n1962\n01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,990\nIf you look there you'll SP 800\ndash something, whatever they are.\n\n1963\n01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:41,340\nThose are the standards that are used for\nthis and you could do a search.\n\n1964\n01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:44,640\nThere's actually a very good search engine\non the site that allows you to search for\n\n1965\n01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:45,430\nthe various standards.\n\n1966\n01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:49,810\nAnd these are recommended best\npractices and are seen time and again\n\n1967\n01:38:49,810 --> 01:38:53,250\nin whatever documentation you may look at\nand indeed may actually choose to follow.\n\n1968\n01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:56,620\nSo just be aware of that when\nwe talk about media disposal.\n\n1969\n01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:57,860\nThis maybe, there you go.\n\n1970\n01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:01,690\nGuidelines for media sanitation or\nsanitization rather right there.\n\n1971\n01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:02,860\nSo you'll see that the U.S.\n\n1972\n01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:06,150\ngovernment has put these things out and\nthey are recognized the world over as\n\n1973\n01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:08,780\none of the places where you\ncan get best practices from.\n\n1974\n01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:10,650\nSo you can obviously see\na lot of them there.\n\n1975\n01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:13,980\nIt's about a forty some odd page\ndocument if I remember correctly.\n\n1976\n01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:16,010\n>> It looks like an enthralling read too.\n\n1977\n01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:17,360\n>> It is definitely exciting.\n\n1978\n01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:21,310\nIf you're suffering from lack of sleep,\nan inability to fall asleep,\n\n1979\n01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:21,940\nget one of these.\n\n1980\n01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:23,080\nPut it on the bedside table.\n\n1981\n01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,020\nA couple of pages you'll\nbe out like a light.\n\n1982\n01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:26,390\nNever a problem.\n\n1983\n01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:30,460\nSo when we talk about media sanitization,\nand you can see they have document\n\n1984\n01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:33,670\ndiagrams in there, right,\nsome different ways of looking at this so\n\n1985\n01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:37,170\nthe idea would be very simple that as\na best practice, you have to come up with\n\n1986\n01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:40,720\na policy as an organization to figure out\nhow to do this stuff, whatever it may be.\n\n1987\n01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:45,260\nAnd this is the logic flow on what\nsanitization may look like used to\n\n1988\n01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:49,020\nachieve the end result, and documenting\nit and building the policy to support it,\n\n1989\n01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:53,010\nso definitely a good reference for you if\nyou're looking for additional information.\n\n1990\n01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:56,540\nSome of the things that we talk about\nthat are outside of media sanitization\n\n1991\n01:39:56,540 --> 01:40:00,870\ngenerically, but I spoke about also, which\nwas this idea of signals bleeding out\n\n1992\n01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:04,932\nof a system, another way of thinking about\ninformation and managing information.\n\n1993\n01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:08,600\nWant to make sure we talk about this\nidea that machines generically,\n\n1994\n01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,720\nany electronic device we use,\nare basically creating\n\n1995\n01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:14,820\nelectromagnetic fields that\nsupport the use of that device and\n\n1996\n01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:18,560\ninformation is transiting through\nthose fields in one form or another.\n\n1997\n01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,870\nAnd if the system is not designed\nthe right way to keep those fields within\n\n1998\n01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:25,770\nthe device itself, they can radiate out\nmaybe several inch or several feet around\n\n1999\n01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:29,200\nthe device depending on the nature of the\ndevice and as a result we have to worry\n\n2000\n01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:34,190\nabout data emanation and we specifically\ntalk about the one of the systems that was\n\n2001\n01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:37,860\nbuilt to try to deal with this which\nis something called Tempest shielding.\n\n2002\n01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:41,770\nTempest shielding is going to allow us to\nbasically control the electric magnetic\n\n2003\n01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:42,390\nradiation.\n\n2004\n01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:44,930\nThe fields that are generated by devices.\n\n2005\n01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:47,370\nIt is almost like stealth technology.\n\n2006\n01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:49,580\nIt absorbs the electromagnetic\nradiation and\n\n2007\n01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:52,630\nkeeps it inbound in the device,\ndoes not allow it out.\n\n2008\n01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:56,170\nWe talk about something called TEMPEST\nshielding, it's specifically a Faraday\n\n2009\n01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:59,730\ncage, which is named after the gentleman\nwho kind of discovered this phenomenon and\n\n2010\n01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:00,760\nbuilt this.\n\n2011\n01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:03,950\nFraming around the computer to figure\nout how to solve this problem and\n\n2012\n01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:08,730\nit's a wire mesh enclosure that fits\nsecurely around devices like monitors,\n\n2013\n01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:11,790\nanything that has electromagnetic\nradiation emanating out of it, so\n\n2014\n01:41:11,790 --> 01:41:16,380\nmaybe the actual box of a computer,\nthe actual just tower if you will.\n\n2015\n01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:19,160\nWe can wrap this in this\nprotective Faraday cage and\n\n2016\n01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:22,400\neffectively stealth the computer by\nabsorbing the electromagnetic symbols that\n\n2017\n01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:26,980\nare emanating so please be aware of that\njust know that as a point of reference.\n\n2018\n01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,620\nIt is something to consider and\n\n2019\n01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:32,290\nsomething you at least want to have\nsome passing familiarity with as well.\n\n2020\n01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:35,130\nSo when we think about all these\ntechnologies brought together\n\n2021\n01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:36,860\nwe think about how we\nbuild this defense and\n\n2022\n01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:39,760\ndepth phenomenon that I've been talking\nabout to you, this architecture.\n\n2023\n01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,510\nWe also have to consider how we defeat\naccess controls because it's very easy to\n\n2024\n01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:46,790\ntalk about building them but if we don't\nlook at what we can do on the flip side to\n\n2025\n01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:50,190\nbreak them and we mentioned a couple of\nthings already, things to look out for\n\n2026\n01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:53,178\nwith Kerberos, for instance,\nand some of those other areas.\n\n2027\n01:41:53,178 --> 01:41:56,430\nWe want to make sure we think about\nthe fact that any lock can be picked,\n\n2028\n01:41:56,430 --> 01:41:59,920\nany door can be forced, right,\na badge or a card can be copied, and\n\n2029\n01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:03,260\na credential can be mirrored in such\na way that somebody can use it.\n\n2030\n01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:06,070\nPasswords can be broken with\npassword cracking software.\n\n2031\n01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:09,990\nSo remember any technology we put\nin place has associated risks and\n\n2032\n01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,350\nvulnerabilities and threats with it.\n\n2033\n01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:15,050\nWe have to assess those and really\nunderstand how to measure the impact of\n\n2034\n01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:18,920\nwhat we're doing to make sure that we take\ninto account not just the obvious issues,\n\n2035\n01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,940\nthe things that can go wrong.\n\n2036\n01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:22,960\nI can spill water on my computer and\nshort it out and\n\n2037\n01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,540\nthat would be bad but the data on my\nhard drive is probably still safe\n\n2038\n01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:29,380\neven though the box itself that\nit came in effectively is gone.\n\n2039\n01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:35,140\nSo that's good but if I go ahead and I set\noff an electromagnetic pulse in the room,\n\n2040\n01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:38,580\nI could not only fry the computer but\nalso scramble the data on the drive.\n\n2041\n01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,770\nSo, that's the kind of thing\nwe have to think about.\n\n2042\n01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:45,140\nWhen you walk into very secure data\ncenters they have degaussers or\n\n2043\n01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:48,100\nelectromagnetic fields built into\nthe door frames in a lot of these\n\n2044\n01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:51,800\nsecure environments where if you walk\nthrough while the field is active, and\n\n2045\n01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,320\nit's typically active unless\nyou are transiting information,\n\n2046\n01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,220\nmeaning bringing hardware in and out.\n\n2047\n01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:58,880\nThey activate these fields to\nkeep the information secure\n\n2048\n01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:03,275\nbecause if you walk through the field with\nthe hard drive or with the device your\n\n2049\n01:43:03,275 --> 01:43:06,300\neffectively wiping the device before you\nstep to the other side of the field.\n\n2050\n01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:09,630\nDoesn't hurt you, although if you have\na pace maker you could have a problem but\n\n2051\n01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:13,390\ngenerally doesn't hurt you but it does\nwipe out the drive in real time and\n\n2052\n01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:16,860\nthese are very very strong devices\nthat are embedded in the frames but\n\n2053\n01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:19,700\nyou don't know they are there right and\nso as a result, you have to really\n\n2054\n01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:22,510\nthink about how you build these\narchitectures and what you can do and\n\n2055\n01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:26,140\nwhat can be done by somebody who's\nlooking to do harm to your network.\n\n2056\n01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:27,010\nThis is very important.\n\n2057\n01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:30,800\nThis idea of vulnerability assessment\nreally becomes very critical.\n\n2058\n01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:34,290\nWhat is the threat, what is the risk,\nwhat is the vulnerability we face?\n\n2059\n01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:36,240\nHow do we identify it?\n\n2060\n01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,420\nHow do we then take steps to plan for it?\n\n2061\n01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:42,000\nYou know some risks are going to\nbe such that we just can't really\n\n2062\n01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,130\nplan to deal with them.\n\n2063\n01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:44,740\nThat once in a hundred year cycle,\n\n2064\n01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:49,630\nwhatever that may be, may be so\nfar out there on the compatibility\n\n2065\n01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:52,050\ncurve in terms of what we look at what\nis happening every day, every week,\n\n2066\n01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:55,650\nevery month, every year that we may\ndecide it's not worth planning for.\n\n2067\n01:43:55,650 --> 01:43:59,440\nBut things like Hurricane Katrina a few\nyears back where we saw a once in\n\n2068\n01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:05,000\na hundred year that basically blew\nopen the levees and flooded part of\n\n2069\n01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:10,440\ndowntown New Orleans shows us that even\nonce in a hundred year events do happen.\n\n2070\n01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:15,550\nA storm a couple of years back now up\nthe east coast that took out New York and\n\n2071\n01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:17,620\nNew Jersey, and\nflooded great parts of that area, right?\n\n2072\n01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:19,380\nAnother once in a hundred year event.\n\n2073\n01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:22,193\nSo, we may not plan for\nthose from an info sec perspective.\n\n2074\n01:44:22,193 --> 01:44:25,214\nThat doesn't mean we're not\nsupposed to be aware of them, and\n\n2075\n01:44:25,214 --> 01:44:28,919\nthis is what a vulnerability assessment\nand a risk assessment helps us to do,\n\n2076\n01:44:28,919 --> 01:44:31,030\nunderstand the potential threats we face.\n\n2077\n01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:34,887\nFocus resources on the ones that\nwe think are most likely to occur.\n\n2078\n01:44:34,887 --> 01:44:37,652\nUse some sort of probability\nimpact exposure matrix, so\n\n2079\n01:44:37,652 --> 01:44:39,784\nwe talk about generically\ngoing through and\n\n2080\n01:44:39,784 --> 01:44:43,472\nfiguring out how to render a rating\naround each of these opportunities, and\n\n2081\n01:44:43,472 --> 01:44:46,780\nfiguring out which ones are likely and\nnot likely to happen.\n\n2082\n01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:50,620\nAnd then ascribing a value to them and\non a matrix a scale may be at one to nine.\n\n2083\n01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:53,570\nRight high probability,\nhigh impact we deal with those.\n\n2084\n01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:55,280\nLow probability, low impact,\n\n2085\n01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,230\nprobably leave those off to the side\nunless we have nothing better going on.\n\n2086\n01:44:58,230 --> 01:45:00,870\nMiddle of the road we make some\ndecisions about impact and\n\n2087\n01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:03,000\nyou know financial expense and exposure.\n\n2088\n01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,620\nSo understand what a vulnerability\nassessment may mean for the organization.\n\n2089\n01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:09,520\nYou would get a good resource if you're\nnot familiar with how to carry one,\n\n2090\n01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,230\nif you've never seen one done.\n\n2091\n01:45:11,230 --> 01:45:14,440\nGo to YouTube and just Google\nvulnerability assessments believe it or\n\n2092\n01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:16,760\nnot you'll find video content out there,\nGoogle for\n\n2093\n01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,960\nsome resources out there\nabout those things.\n\n2094\n01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:22,620\nYou'll find mechanisms that will allow you\nto understand how they're executed and\n\n2095\n01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,400\nreally then understand\nwhat you should be doing.\n\n2096\n01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,200\n>> And there's a lot of organizations out\nthere like KPMG, where you can come and\n\n2097\n01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,150\nget them to an audit.\n\n2098\n01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:33,900\nThey can do a, often times they'll call\nit a BIA, a business impact analysis,\n\n2099\n01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:37,320\nwhere they'll catalog your various risks,\nand determine what impact they'd have on\n\n2100\n01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:40,010\nyour organization if they actually\noccurred, and that's pretty important.\n\n2101\n01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:44,380\nIt is kind of a difficult thing because\nhow do you quantify some things?\n\n2102\n01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,740\nThe probability,\n\n2103\n01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:49,110\nthe statistics of something happening,\nthat doesn't mean you can't quantify, but\n\n2104\n01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:53,570\nthe impact, what negative reaction is\nthat gonna cause your organization?\n\n2105\n01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:55,320\nThat can be really hard to calculate, so.\n\n2106\n01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,990\n>> It can, and it can you know and this\njust brings up an interesting point about\n\n2107\n01:45:57,990 --> 01:46:01,080\nthis, we'll circle back to this\nconversation in more depth in a while.\n\n2108\n01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:04,690\nBut this idea of a business impact\nanalysis and how we quantify,\n\n2109\n01:46:04,690 --> 01:46:07,570\nyou wanna understand the idea of how\nwe measure right, and the idea of\n\n2110\n01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:11,710\nquantitative versus qualitative measuring\nis important as a distinction here.\n\n2111\n01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:15,980\nQuantitative metrics or measurements\nare dollar value, number value metrics.\n\n2112\n01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:18,940\nWe could ascribe value to them\nvery easily, we understand them.\n\n2113\n01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:22,680\nAnd I buy a cup of coffee,\nit cost me a dollar, I understand for\n\n2114\n01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:25,610\nan exchange of goods to happen, I got to\nhave a dollar and get a cup of coffee.\n\n2115\n01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:26,860\nI can measure that, right.\n\n2116\n01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,810\nThe qualitative matrix, qualitative\nmeasures are a little bit different.\n\n2117\n01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:34,720\nThey're a little softer, they're not\nhard numbers, not hard financial values.\n\n2118\n01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,180\nThey're more about opinion and\nfeeling, and\n\n2119\n01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:38,970\nthose things are hard\nto measure sometimes.\n\n2120\n01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:39,970\nHow happy are you?\n\n2121\n01:46:39,970 --> 01:46:40,500\nRight?\n\n2122\n01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:42,010\nHow good a day was it today?\n\n2123\n01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:43,820\nHow secure do we think we are?\n\n2124\n01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,920\nWhat's our reputation with our customers?\n\n2125\n01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,670\nThose are qualitative measures.\n\n2126\n01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:51,560\nStill very important, but much harder to\nput a dollar value and a number on and\n\n2127\n01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,300\nmeasure quantitatively.\n\n2128\n01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:55,630\nAnd we have to assess both when we\ndo a vulnerability assessment and\n\n2129\n01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:56,350\na business impact.\n\n2130\n01:46:56,350 --> 01:46:57,130\nVery important.\n\n2131\n01:46:57,130 --> 01:46:59,280\nSo, let's talk a little\nbit about the cloud.\n\n2132\n01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:00,270\nLet's talk about the cloud.\n\n2133\n01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:02,460\nLet's talk about some of the things\nthat go on in the cloud.\n\n2134\n01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:04,769\nYou know,\nthe cloud is a marketing concept [LAUGH],\n\n2135\n01:47:04,769 --> 01:47:07,520\nit's an ill defined term\nthat we've thrown around.\n\n2136\n01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,400\n>> It's a buzzword.\n\n2137\n01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:09,460\n>> It's a buzzword, right.\n\n2138\n01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:13,340\nIt's something that unfortunately\nis hard to put our hands around.\n\n2139\n01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:16,420\nAnd we're not gonna be able to define it\njust in the next couple of minutes of\n\n2140\n01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:19,460\ntalking about it, but we can at least\nhelp you to understand some of the key\n\n2141\n01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:21,360\nterminology and the ideas behind it.\n\n2142\n01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:24,550\nAnd so, when we talk about cloud and\ncloud computing, first of all,\n\n2143\n01:47:24,550 --> 01:47:28,150\nwe talk about the idea of using a\nvirtualized technology platform typically,\n\n2144\n01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:31,220\nto be able to support use\nof systems in the cloud.\n\n2145\n01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:36,340\nAnd so this idea of virtualizing systems,\nbeing able to use physical hardware\n\n2146\n01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:40,810\nto run multiple instances of,\nin effect, in memory solutions.\n\n2147\n01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:44,270\nTypically servers or\nmachines that are running as guest OS'.\n\n2148\n01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:46,840\nWhatever the Virtualization\nplatform doesn't really matter,\n\n2149\n01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:50,410\nthe point is you're using the physical\nresources of what we call a host.\n\n2150\n01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:53,830\nTo be able to provide the logical\noperating environment in memory and\n\n2151\n01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:57,020\nin the processors of the host,\nto be able to run those guest OS'.\n\n2152\n01:47:57,020 --> 01:48:00,050\nSo this is one of the underlying\ntechnologies within or\n\n2153\n01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:01,390\nunderneath the cloud.\n\n2154\n01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:05,340\nWe then talk about being able to create\nan architecture in the cloud, right?\n\n2155\n01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:09,270\nSo we have three different accepted\narchitectures today traditionally.\n\n2156\n01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:12,120\nWe have what is known as a private cloud.\n\n2157\n01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:14,340\nSo a cloud that is effectively set up for\n\n2158\n01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:17,390\nyour business' use,\nexclusive to your business.\n\n2159\n01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:21,260\nWe would have called this a intranet or\n\n2160\n01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:26,830\nan internal network in the older\nnetwork architecture speak.\n\n2161\n01:48:26,830 --> 01:48:29,410\nSo intra net is much like a private cloud.\n\n2162\n01:48:29,410 --> 01:48:30,700\nWe can compare the two.\n\n2163\n01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:34,350\nWe have a Public cloud as Don's\nalready beaten me to the punch and\n\n2164\n01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:35,310\ntyped out for me.\n\n2165\n01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:39,470\nSo a public cloud will be a available\ncloud that is going to be made available\n\n2166\n01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:42,790\nnot only to the internal people of\nthe organization but also external.\n\n2167\n01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:47,860\nYou can think of the internet as being\nthe largest public cloud available today.\n\n2168\n01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:50,820\nAnd so the internet is gonna\nbe one that we often use.\n\n2169\n01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:53,300\nAnd then a Hybrid club mixes\nthe two together, right,\n\n2170\n01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:54,880\nelements of Public and Private.\n\n2171\n01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,840\nSo we may have a forward facing,\npublic facing web interface but\n\n2172\n01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,250\nwe may let customers into\ncertain aspects of it and\n\n2173\n01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:04,960\nothers are gonna have additional logon to\nget into private information like email\n\n2174\n01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,490\nand things like that, right,\nthat typically will be available.\n\n2175\n01:49:07,490 --> 01:49:08,750\nSo those are the architectures.\n\n2176\n01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:13,550\nAnd then we have typically the accepted\nusage models and again there\n\n2177\n01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:17,110\nare many of them, it seems like everything\ntoday can be something as a service.\n\n2178\n01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:20,480\nYou can fill in the blank and\nput something in front of that AAS and\n\n2179\n01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,390\nhave anything be available right?\n\n2180\n01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:25,230\nDR as a service is very popular today.\n\n2181\n01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:29,050\nGovernment is a service and all sorts of,\nof in the corner things that may or\n\n2182\n01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:31,180\nmay not have been acceptable\na few years ago, but\n\n2183\n01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:34,710\nthe three traditional ones we\noften hear about are going to be\n\n2184\n01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:38,470\nthe software as a service, or\nwhat's called SAAS, so S-A-A-S.\n\n2185\n01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:40,230\nSoftware as a service.\n\n2186\n01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:44,500\nThis is where basically you rent\nsoftware from one or more vendors, so\n\n2187\n01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:48,690\nOffice 365 from Microsoft is a good\nexample of this, as is Google Apps, right.\n\n2188\n01:49:48,690 --> 01:49:50,900\nYou probably are familiar with one or\nboth of these models.\n\n2189\n01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:54,220\nYou're renting the software from them,\nyou don't own it, you basically are just\n\n2190\n01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:57,510\npaying a monthly licensing or\nusage fee in order to be able to do that.\n\n2191\n01:49:57,510 --> 01:49:59,880\nAnd as a result you're able\nto access the software.\n\n2192\n01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:01,950\nThe upside is you're getting\nconstant updates and\n\n2193\n01:50:01,950 --> 01:50:03,530\nkeeping up to date with the platform.\n\n2194\n01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:07,100\nThe downside is that you don't actually\nown the software so as a result,\n\n2195\n01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:09,090\nyou basically stop paying, you stop using.\n\n2196\n01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:11,590\nIf you want to think of it that way\nright it's a pay as you go model.\n\n2197\n01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:16,740\nSo we also have what is known as\ninfrastructure as a service, or\n\n2198\n01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:18,230\nIAAS, or IS.\n\n2199\n01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:24,980\nInfrastructure as a service is gonna\nallow us to get the underlying operating\n\n2200\n01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:28,773\nsystem and the hardware associated\nwith the we were renting the server,\n\n2201\n01:50:28,773 --> 01:50:31,100\nif you will In the underlying\noperating system.\n\n2202\n01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:34,390\nBut then on top of that we add\nour own application environment,\n\n2203\n01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:36,060\nour own built environment.\n\n2204\n01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:41,680\nSo we may then choose to run programs\nmaybe we're running Microsoft software or\n\n2205\n01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:45,140\nwe're running Visual Studio to do software\ndevelopment, or whatever it may be.\n\n2206\n01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:48,860\nBut we're just renting\nthe infrastructure core on the OS,\n\n2207\n01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:52,540\nwe're not renting the applications or\nthe platform which is all the way up and\n\n2208\n01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,970\nwe'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n2209\n01:50:53,970 --> 01:50:58,160\nSo again the idea of pay as you go,\nrenting virtual machine infrastructure.\n\n2210\n01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:01,890\nAlong with a dedicated operating system\nthat is part of the licensing fee, and\n\n2211\n01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:03,600\nthen you do with it what you will.\n\n2212\n01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:07,970\nThese machines typically are spun up in a\nvery easily consumed self-service fashion.\n\n2213\n01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:10,780\nYou have some sort of a web interface\nwhere you can program in the request for\n\n2214\n01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:12,670\na machine, and\nthen you go in and get that.\n\n2215\n01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:16,780\nAnd then PaaS platform,\nis this service, P-A-A-S.\n\n2216\n01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:19,480\nWill allow us to be able to rent\nthe entire stack all the way up and\n\n2217\n01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,470\ndown including the operating\nsystems as we said, but\n\n2218\n01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:25,580\nalso typically the application\nenvironment that we wanna run.\n\n2219\n01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:29,400\nSo we may be renting\nthe full stack solution\n\n2220\n01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:33,260\nthat allows us to be able to generate\nall of that information including maybe\n\n2221\n01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:36,380\nan application development environment or\nsomething like that.\n\n2222\n01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:40,020\nRight, and so that's really what we are\nthinking about when we talk about paths.\n\n2223\n01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:42,180\nAs I said, there are many,\nmany more models out there.\n\n2224\n01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:44,750\nThese are just the three acceptable ones,\nright?\n\n2225\n01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:48,680\nThe ones that are traditionally talked\nabout, but there are many others.\n\n2226\n01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:51,800\nYou could think of putting almost anything\nin front of as a service today, and\n\n2227\n01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:54,910\nyou would be probably able to offer\nthat and sell that to somebody.\n\n2228\n01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:58,350\nBut the most popular that we see, at least\nthe ones that are the consumer oriented\n\n2229\n01:51:58,350 --> 01:52:01,720\nones, are gonna be the software\nas a service solution really,\n\n2230\n01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:04,330\nbecause that's the one where\nmost individuals consume.\n\n2231\n01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:07,180\nInfrastructure and platform are ones where\n\n2232\n01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:09,780\ntypically businesses are consuming\nas opposed to individuals.\n\n2233\n01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:14,240\nThey're setting that up, and renting that\nfrom Amazon web services through a cloud,\n\n2234\n01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:15,870\nthat kind of thing Rack space.\n\n2235\n01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:17,760\nThose are providers in the IS and\n\n2236\n01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,420\nPASS environments that's really\nwhat we see them being able to do.\n\n2237\n01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:23,990\nSo, just an idea of what\nthat might look like there.\n\n2238\n01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:28,050\n>> And the big attraction with these\nis that you don't have to support\n\n2239\n01:52:28,050 --> 01:52:30,225\nthe underlying system\n>> System, the part that you're renting,\n\n2240\n01:52:30,225 --> 01:52:32,445\nso if you're renting the servers and\n\n2241\n01:52:32,445 --> 01:52:35,735\na hard drive fails,\nthey deal with it, not you.\n\n2242\n01:52:35,735 --> 01:52:39,699\nThey're providing the backup generators,\nthe redundant internet connections,\n\n2243\n01:52:39,699 --> 01:52:43,003\nthe data center, the knock [CROSSTALK]\nStorage is part of that as well.\n\n2244\n01:52:43,003 --> 01:52:43,618\n>> Absolutely.\n\n2245\n01:52:43,618 --> 01:52:47,265\n>> You don't have to worry about storage\nand provisioning that and, all that stuff,\n\n2246\n01:52:47,265 --> 01:52:50,286\nall the heavy lifting really is done\nby the people that are selling you\n\n2247\n01:52:50,286 --> 01:52:50,930\nthe service.\n\n2248\n01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:53,140\nYou just show up and\nconsume, that's the value.\n\n2249\n01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:54,150\n>> That's the good.\n\n2250\n01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:58,070\nThe bad is you're trusting that they're\ntaking the necessary precautions to\n\n2251\n01:52:58,070 --> 01:52:59,280\nprotect your data.\n\n2252\n01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:02,500\nAnd if these are virtualized systems,\nwhich usually they are,\n\n2253\n01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:07,820\nwell you're running on the same hardware\nas other customers who you don't know.\n\n2254\n01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:11,380\nYou have no idea who they are or\nwhat they are or what they're doing,\n\n2255\n01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:12,430\nthat's all invisible to you.\n\n2256\n01:53:12,430 --> 01:53:14,160\nSo that's one of the trade\noffs that we make and\n\n2257\n01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:17,690\nwe have to be really careful about how\nwe implement these cloud services and\n\n2258\n01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:21,740\nthat we take some extra precautions\nto ensure that our data is protected.\n\n2259\n01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:22,640\n>> Very, very important.\n\n2260\n01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,010\nAbsolutely.\n\n2261\n01:53:24,010 --> 01:53:25,080\nAnd very good, very good.\n\n2262\n01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:29,350\n>> All right, well, I think that pretty\nmuch wraps us up for access control, so.\n\n2263\n01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:30,260\n>> I believe it does.\n\n2264\n01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:31,430\nI believe it does.\n\n2265\n01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:31,990\n>> All right.\nSo,\n\n2266\n01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:36,960\nlet me just remind you guys, if you\nhave any questions on any of this, live,\n\n2267\n01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:40,070\nduring the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n2268\n01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:42,020\nYou'll see the chat

right, good morning, good afternoon,\ngood evening, and welcome back.\n\n5\n00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,810\nTo another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,100\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,010\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,760\n>> Awesome.\n\n9\n00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,720\nHow's everybody doing out there?\n\n10\n00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,940\n>> Everybody out in TV land?\n\n11\n00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,290\n>> So, we're back at you again\nwith another SSCP episode,\n\n13\n00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,650\nas we move through the certification.\n\n14\n00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,550\nWe spent our last episode talking about\naccess control and things like that.\n\n15\n00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,150\nNow we're gonna switch gears a bit and\ntake a look at security operations,\n\n16\n00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,740\nsome of the different things\nthat we need to do as far as\n\n17\n00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,350\noperating a IT security department,\nor just infosec in general.\n\n18\n00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,980\nSo let's start by talking about\na topic that gets overlooked, and\n\n19\n00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,960\nyou see this in a lot of different exams.\n\n20\n00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,315\nWith the SSCP certification, when you\napply to become certified, part of what\n\n21\n00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:28,863\nyou're doing is agreeing to abide by the\ncode of ethics as defined by ISC squared.\n\n22\n00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:32,655\nThat means, well first off,\nit's really important that you're\n\n23\n00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:35,277\ndoing the things that you're\nsocially responsible for doing.\n\n24\n00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:38,597\nBut also it's important that we know\nit because the code of ethics is\n\n25\n00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:39,637\ntestable material.\n\n26\n00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:41,507\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n27\n00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,747\nAnd you know before the show,\n\n28\n00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:47,357\nAdam had the excellent idea of\nbringing this up beforehand.\n\n29\n00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,217\nSo we've got that code of ethics\nto take a look at right here.\n\n30\n00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:51,557\n>> Virtual pat on the back for me.\n\n31\n00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:52,177\nSo thank you.\n\n32\n00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:53,920\nI appreciate you bringing that up.\n\n33\n00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,970\nSo you know one of the things\nas an aspiring SSCP and for\n\n34\n00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,128\nthat matter whether it is ISC squared or\nthis case,\n\n35\n00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:04,818\nwe're obviously focused on this credential\nbecause ISC squared does have in-market.\n\n36\n00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:08,170\nBut regardless of the vendor\nthat's driving the certification\n\n37\n00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,860\nas information security professionals\ngenerically, there is a code.\n\n38\n00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,830\nA standard of ethics in behavior that we\nreally have to think about subscribing to\n\n39\n00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,886\nin our community at large.\n\n40\n00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:22,420\nISC squared is really gone to the next\nlevel, formulated that, made it official,\n\n41\n00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,650\nasked all of their active members in\ngood standing to abide by that, and\n\n42\n00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,120\nI think it's a great idea.\n\n43\n00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,703\nAnd anybody that's in that community\nwill tell you that it's a very important\n\n44\n00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:33,091\ndocument that we reference\nin a very important way,\n\n45\n00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:35,937\nin a standardized way that we\nlook at doing our jobs every day.\n\n46\n00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:40,127\nBut the idea of having a set of guidelines\nthat help us to understand how to act,\n\n47\n00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,542\nhow to respond to requests for\ninformation,\n\n48\n00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,273\nhow to ultimately be a good\ncorporate citizen, and\n\n49\n00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:49,660\na good practitioner of security is\na very central and important concept.\n\n50\n00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,480\nAnd so the ISC code of ethics\nis found on the ISC website.\n\n51\n00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,990\nDon will put the URL in the notes for\nus, to make sure we capture it.\n\n52\n00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,400\nBut you'll see there as we talk about it,\nthat the code starts out with a preamble.\n\n53\n00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,560\nYou can see the preamble on the screen,\nand the idea is that the safety and\n\n54\n00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480\nwelfare of the common good.\n\n55\n00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480\nReally at the end of the day,\n\n56\n00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,000\nit's our duty to make that we are going\nto be able to abide by that, and\n\n57\n00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,070\nuphold the safety, and the common welfare,\nof everybody around us in our community.\n\n58\n00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,690\nIn other words, what the code of ethics\nreally asks us to do as a member of\n\n59\n00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,290\nthe information security community is to\nmake sure we do no harm, and when and\n\n60\n00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,530\nwhere possible, make sure, there we go,\nmake sure that we are focused on\n\n61\n00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,020\nlife safety and the safety of the people\nthat we are serving above all else.\n\n62\n00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,386\nYou know when it comes down to the choice\nbetween safety of information and\n\n63\n00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:39,005\nsafety of human beings,\nwe wanna make the right choice.\n\n64\n00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:40,595\nWe wanna make sure we safeguard life.\n\n65\n00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,825\nInformation is important,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n66\n00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:47,058\nBut there's never unequivocally a choice\nbetween safeguarding a human life, and\n\n67\n00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:48,588\nsafeguarding information.\n\n68\n00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:52,240\nWe always wanna make sure that whoever it\nis that we're in charge of making sure is\n\n69\n00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,300\nsafe, always is safe before\nwe worry about anything else.\n\n70\n00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,240\nAnd that's what the code\nof ethics is all about.\n\n71\n00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,140\nIt's acting, as you can see,\nto protect society.\n\n72\n00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,760\nAnd the code of ethics canons the bulleted\nlist items below the preamble,\n\n73\n00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,330\nacting to make sure the common good\nis setup at all times in our minds.\n\n74\n00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,330\nFirst and foremost, making sure that\nwe act honorably, honestly, justly.\n\n75\n00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,060\nSo making sure that we always give\npeople the right information,\n\n76\n00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,600\nto the best of our abilities.\n\n77\n00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,250\nGuide them in the proper ways.\n\n78\n00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,410\nMaking sure we're focused\non good outcomes.\n\n79\n00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,160\nAnd making sure everybody understands how\nto interact in a system in the proper way.\n\n80\n00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,040\nDiligent and competent service to our\nprinciples, meaning making sure we service\n\n81\n00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,670\nthe business as well as the ideals the\nbusiness upholds that we're a part of, and\n\n82\n00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,710\nadvancing and protecting the profession.\n\n83\n00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,485\nThere is nothing at the end of the day\nthat is worse than finding an information\n\n84\n00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:41,280\nsecurity professional that doesn't\nunderstand the code of ethics,\n\n85\n00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,520\nthat is not sure how to act\nin a certain situation, and\n\n86\n00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,280\nperhaps makes the wrong choice not because\nthey willfully set out to do so, but\n\n87\n00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,040\nbecause they just weren't able to take\nthe time to educate themselves and\n\n88\n00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040\nthose around them, to understand what\nthe proper path would have been.\n\n89\n00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,760\nAnd so we harp on this idea of awareness\nin several of our discussions;\n\n90\n00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,400\nthis idea of being sure that\nyou are focused on awareness.\n\n91\n00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,210\nFocused on making sure that\neverybody around you is aware, and\n\n92\n00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,570\nthat everybody understands what the proper\npath is, and the right decision point in\n\n93\n00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,880\na situation, is really what the code of\nethics speaks to and what it's all about.\n\n94\n00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,470\n>> Yeah, and that is a increasing concern.\n\n95\n00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,490\nWe've got a number of very high visibility\ndata leaks that have happened in the last\n\n96\n00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,870\nfew years and it's centered around\nsecurity professionals abusing\n\n97\n00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,120\nthe trust that was placed in them.\n\n98\n00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,720\nAnd it is a fine line, that in\nthe security profession, the way that\n\n99\n00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,440\nwe defend our network is by understanding\nthe ways that people attack our network.\n\n100\n00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,790\nAnd so the difference between defender and\nattacker becomes a small thing.\n\n101\n00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,670\nSo, adhering to that code of ethics\nis the way that we can ensure, or\n\n102\n00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,420\nthat we can at least pledge to say that\nwe're gonna operate within the socially\n\n103\n00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,280\nacceptable boundaries of our profession,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,980\nThat we're gonna make sure that\nwe're constantly striving to\n\n105\n00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,130\nimprove security in our environment.\n\n106\n00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,790\n>> Very important.\n\n107\n00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,600\nVery important.\n\n108\n00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,940\nSo do think about that and\nmake sure you're familiar with it.\n\n109\n00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,520\nAgain, I encourage you to go\nto the ISC squared website.\n\n110\n00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,970\nTake a look and\nmake sure you're familiar with it.\n\n111\n00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,640\nAs a matter of fact,\npart of the application process that we\n\n112\n00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,090\nhave to engage in to become\ncertified is after you take and\n\n113\n00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,350\npass the exam,\nyou do go through an application process.\n\n114\n00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,160\nPart of it is deciding that you\nwill uphold the code of ethics,\n\n115\n00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,440\nand confirming that you will as part\nof the application to ensure that\n\n116\n00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,670\nyou understand what is contained there.\n\n117\n00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,392\nSo please take that seriously and\nbe aware of that.\n\n118\n00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:22,110\nAll right.\n\n119\n00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,700\nSo having said that, let's talk a little\nbit about what the security operations and\n\n120\n00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,790\nadministration domain entails.\n\n121\n00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,770\nObviously the code of ethics,\nthe primary focus,\n\n122\n00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,460\none of the key points in areas of\ninformation we wanna communicate to you.\n\n123\n00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,260\nBut there are others.\n\n124\n00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,150\nManaging security infrastructure,\nmaking sure we understand how to do that\n\n125\n00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,780\nfrom a sec ops perspective and\nadministration perspective.\n\n126\n00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,820\nAnd we'll obviously have some conversation\naround the fine points there.\n\n127\n00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,830\nCreating and supporting policies, so we'll\ntalk a lot about policies, standards,\n\n128\n00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,070\nguidelines, baselines,\nwhat are they, how do they work?\n\n129\n00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,240\nWe'll have some information for\n\n130\n00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,410\nyou about how to go through\nthe exercise of defining a policy.\n\n131\n00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,350\nYou may or\nmay not have written one by the way.\n\n132\n00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,880\nAs a practitioner and\na lot of people just starting out,\n\n133\n00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,700\nthey have a lot of hands on experience\ndoing things like setting up firewalls,\n\n134\n00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,620\nmonitoring logs, setting up and\nmaintaining access controls.\n\n135\n00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,620\nBut we never have actually done or dealt\nwith the ideas behind writing a policy.\n\n136\n00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,300\nAnd so this is an area where sometimes\na lot of people have some questions.\n\n137\n00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,240\nMaybe a little skittish about dealing\nwith one because they haven't written on\n\n138\n00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,020\nbefore.\n\n139\n00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,850\nMay not be comfortable\nwith what goes in there.\n\n140\n00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,050\nSo we're gonna show you a place\nyou can find some templates,\n\n141\n00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,300\ngive you some guidance on that, make\nsure you guys are comfortable with that.\n\n142\n00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,160\nClassifying data, how do we classify data,\nwhat does that look like?\n\n143\n00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,320\nWhat is secret information\nversus top secret maybe versus\n\n144\n00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,780\npublicly accessible information.\n\n145\n00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,150\nThat's one way of classifying data.\n\n146\n00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,500\nAnother way may be based on risk or\nbased on analysis of threat and\n\n147\n00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,530\nvulnerability to that information.\n\n148\n00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,530\nWe have to look at different\nways to do that and\n\n149\n00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,430\nunderstand the impact of that\nas we build our architectures.\n\n150\n00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,315\nThe program development and\nmaintenance around these kind of things,\n\n151\n00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,632\nbuilding the infrastructure,\nbuilding the policies.\n\n152\n00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:55,068\nWhat are the systematic and\n\n153\n00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:58,138\nprogrammatic ideas we want to\nmake sure we touch on there.\n\n154\n00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:00,952\nManaging minor as well as\nmajor changes to a system, so,\n\n155\n00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:05,700\ngenerically change management as well as\nrisk management, very important concepts.\n\n156\n00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,150\nThose of you that may have\na background with project management.\n\n157\n00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,770\nFor instance, some of you may\nhave a background in that area.\n\n158\n00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,617\nA lot of times,\nwe deal with these ideas of change and\n\n159\n00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:17,451\nhow change impacts a system when we\ntalk about information security.\n\n160\n00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:20,991\nAnd having a little bit of a background\nwith project management can be incredibly\n\n161\n00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,727\nhelpful to you.\n\n162\n00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:24,669\nSo we'll reference some of that and\ngive you some information there and\n\n163\n00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:25,903\nhelp you to understand that.\n\n164\n00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:29,694\nBut frameworks like ITIL or\nITIL depending on where you come from and\n\n165\n00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:34,021\nyour pronunciation, certainly COBIT\nwhich is an IT governance framework,\n\n166\n00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:38,012\nvery important in this regard If\nyou are a Microsoft-centric person,\n\n167\n00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:42,136\nMicrosoft Solutions Framework and\nOperations Framework, MSF and MOF,\n\n168\n00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:46,433\nas well as many other frameworks that\nare out there today, DoDAF and TOGAF.\n\n169\n00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:50,798\nAnd many of the specific information\nsecurity frameworks that are unique to\n\n170\n00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:55,296\nthis practice, help you to understand\nhow to manage change, how to manage and\n\n171\n00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:58,990\naccess risk and\nunderstand how to do analysis around them.\n\n172\n00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,630\nSo want to make sure we're aware of those.\n\n173\n00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,690\nAnd this idea of promoting this awareness\nthrough security and security training.\n\n174\n00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,830\nAnd this idea of making sure that\npeople are aware to act ethically\n\n175\n00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,990\nis one component of that, but\nmaking sure the people are knowledgeable\n\n176\n00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,790\nabout the things they have to do\nto be good corporate citizens, and\n\n177\n00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,670\ninteraction systems is also part of\nour discussion in this area as well.\n\n178\n00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,370\nAnd like all good discussions\naround information security,\n\n179\n00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,390\nwe always begin with the thought process\naround the three pillars, right, the areas\n\n180\n00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,350\nthat really interconnect and help us\nto understand information security,\n\n181\n00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,950\nthese ideas of confidentiality,\nof integrity, and of availability.\n\n182\n00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,990\nAnd these are the three pillars that\nreally uphold all the aspects of\n\n183\n00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,990\ninformation security that we talk about.\n\n184\n00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,090\nSo CIA, to use the acronym, although\nnow it's more traditionally referred to\n\n185\n00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,550\nas the AIC Acronym because CIA has some\npotentially connotations that may or\n\n186\n00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,470\nmay not be appropriate in certain\nparts of our conversations.\n\n187\n00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,660\nSo generically, however you frame it,\nremembering these ideas of\n\n188\n00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,190\nconfidentiality, of integrity, and\nof availability are very important as\n\n189\n00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,790\nbuilding blocks and really places we\nstart out our conversation around.\n\n190\n00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,940\nAny of the areas that deal with\nthe SSCP and even more broadly,\n\n191\n00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,680\nwhether we're talking about\nan ISC focus credential or\n\n192\n00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,980\nperhaps more broadly, just generically\ninformation security as a practice.\n\n193\n00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,920\nWe want to remember the confidentiality,\nintegrity and\n\n194\n00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,870\navailability sit at the heart of\neverything we do as professionals.\n\n195\n00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,930\nJust reminding you of that and\n\n196\n00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,560\nmaking sure you're familiar with that\nis also an important thought process.\n\n197\n00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,308\nSo security frameworks, so lets talk\nabout those as a starting point and\n\n198\n00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:28,220\nwhat they are.\n\n199\n00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,750\nSo the idea of a framework is\nreally building a superstructure,\n\n200\n00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,570\nthe thing were going to hang\nall of the intermediate and\n\n201\n00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,610\nspecific details around the practice\nthat we wanna engage in on.\n\n202\n00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,490\nSo if you think about building a building,\n\n203\n00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,590\nthe idea of building the framework is\nbuilding the outer shell of the building.\n\n204\n00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,860\nIt's really the structure\nelements that provide support and\n\n205\n00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,100\nmake sure that we understand how to\nthen put all the other things on and\n\n206\n00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,130\naround them that are going\nto be helpful to us.\n\n207\n00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,130\nSo a security framework is really\ngoing to be that model that\n\n208\n00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,180\nhelps us to develop\nthe comprehensive security program.\n\n209\n00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,300\nAnd I mentioned a few frameworks\nthat exist out there.\n\n210\n00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,020\nThere are many others, by the way.\n\n211\n00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,760\nYou know, using a tool such\nas Google to go out and, for\n\n212\n00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,730\ninstance, Google security frameworks,\nyou will find references to many of them.\n\n213\n00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,060\nAnd you will find the most\ncommon ones out there and\n\n214\n00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,280\nones that are maybe more esoteric but\nthe idea at the end of the day is to\n\n215\n00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,210\nunderstand what approach your entity, the\nbusiness you work for the government, or\n\n216\n00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,320\nwhatever that public, private sector that\nyou find yourself employed in is using.\n\n217\n00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,630\nAsk the obvious questions.\n\n218\n00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,300\nWhat is the framework my\nentity is involved with?\n\n219\n00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,049\nIs there a standard,\nis there a guideline we have to follow?\n\n220\n00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,539\nAnd if you work for for small business and\nmaybe medium to small sized company\n\n221\n00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:40,893\nanywhere from maybe several, five, ten,\n15, 20 people up to maybe 50 to 100.\n\n222\n00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:43,200\nYou may not have a framework\nformerly in place,\n\n223\n00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,140\nyou just may not be thinking\nalong those lines as a business,\n\n224\n00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,021\nyou may be a little too small to do so\nbut if you're growing,\n\n225\n00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:52,771\nit's important to look at some of the\nstandards out there and understand that\n\n226\n00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:56,610\nyou can link to those without necessarily\nhaving to implement them directly.\n\n227\n00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,010\nAnd take the best practices from them and\n\n228\n00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,650\nget the things that are valuable there for\nyou.\n\n229\n00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,230\nWrite this idea of policies and\n\n230\n00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,390\nwriting things down that we'll get\ninto here in a couple of minutes.\n\n231\n00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,470\nDocumenting for users what expectations\nare, clearly communicating them, keeping\n\n232\n00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,890\nchanged management at the forefront of\nwhat we do, and thinking about risk.\n\n233\n00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,970\nThese are things that are important\nwhether you have two people or\n\n234\n00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,090\n2000 in a system and\nwhether you follow a formal framework or\n\n235\n00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,530\nnot that identifies those elements those\nbest practices I just mentioned to you\n\n236\n00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,200\nare critical to any success that you want\nto create with information security.\n\n237\n00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,790\n>> Yeah and\nthat's the cool part about any framework.\n\n238\n00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,530\nIs that like Adam said you\ndon't necessarily have to\n\n239\n00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,780\nimplement the entire framework.\n\n240\n00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,210\nYou can pick and\nchoose the pieces that you need.\n\n241\n00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,850\nAnd if you're a small or medium business\nthe full framework might be overkill for\n\n242\n00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,310\nwhat you've got and so,\ngrabbing just the pieces you want.\n\n243\n00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,398\nSo, for an example,\n\n244\n00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:51,640\nI know I worked in an organization where\nwe needed to implement change management.\n\n245\n00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,130\nWell, what we did is we decided to lift\nthe change management pieces out of ITIL,\n\n246\n00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,196\nand run with that.\n\n247\n00:12:57,196 --> 00:13:01,257\nSo we were running in the ITIL compliant\nmethod for change management, but\n\n248\n00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:05,394\nwe didn't implement the entire ITIL\nservice management piece, and that.\n\n249\n00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:08,541\nSo you can pick and choose what you want,\nand slowly evolve to meet your company's\n\n250\n00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,551\nneeds, or you can even mix and match from\nsome of the different frameworks that\n\n251\n00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,720\nare available, there's a bunch of them\nout of there, I know you listed several.\n\n252\n00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,550\n>> Absolutely, there are.\n\n253\n00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,610\nAnd there are new emerging ones\nthat come out every so often,\n\n254\n00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,110\nCOBIT as I mentioned is one One that is,\nfrom an IT governance perspective,\n\n255\n00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,509\none that ISACA, so I-S-A-C-A .org,\n\n256\n00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:31,310\nISACA.org has in market, they've been out\nin front for many years driving this.\n\n257\n00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,660\nThey have certifications associated\nwith their platform as well.\n\n258\n00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,660\nSo the CISA or the CISM certifications,\n\n259\n00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,850\nCISA is an auditor credential,\nCISM is more of a management credential,\n\n260\n00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,380\nmuch like the CISSP that IC Squared has\nin market would be valuable there but\n\n261\n00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,480\ntheir framework, their coded framework is\nrecognized worldwide as an IT governance\n\n262\n00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,390\nsolution that helps companies to\nat least focus on how to do and\n\n263\n00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,310\nreally engage in best practices from\na security management perspective.\n\n264\n00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,860\nAnd then there are many others that\nmaybe you need to certain silo, so\n\n265\n00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,910\nby functional or utilitarian area\nwhether it's military, government,\n\n266\n00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,260\nprivate sector, financial services,\nthings like that.\n\n267\n00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,800\nThere are many frameworks\nthat focus on these areas.\n\n268\n00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,460\nAs practitioners with an SSCP credential\nor looking to acquire one, you're not\n\n269\n00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,770\ngonna be as focused on specifically\nknowing every framework out there, and\n\n270\n00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,580\nwhat it does, and why it's important, but\nyou are gonna be expected to understand\n\n271\n00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,390\nhow to apply a best practice like\ncreating a policy, linking to a standard,\n\n272\n00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,540\nunderstand what a guideline is, and how\nto create a baseline to measure against.\n\n273\n00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,921\nThese are important skills that\nyou'll need to master regardless\n\n274\n00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:36,880\nof the framework.\n\n275\n00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,260\nSo think about that.\n\n276\n00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,140\nAnd that brings up this idea that\nyou may need some help in this area.\n\n277\n00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,070\nSo in other words,\nyou may need some guidance.\n\n278\n00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,230\nWell talk about some places you can\nfind resources here along the way.\n\n279\n00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,280\nBut, you know what, a trend that we're\nseeing emerge in security practices today,\n\n280\n00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,630\nespecially in smaller entities\nis outsourcing of security,\n\n281\n00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,740\neven in large entities.\n\n282\n00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,090\nThey're outsourcing security or elements\nof it because there are companies that\n\n283\n00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,950\nprofessionally focus on doing nothing but\ndoing this.\n\n284\n00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,900\nSo as a result, some companies will\nspecialize in taking on the management and\n\n285\n00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,710\napplication of that solution to your\ncompany effectively as Service, right?\n\n286\n00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,500\nSo really just coming in and\ndoing security as a service,\n\n287\n00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,115\nas opposed to software as a service.\n\n288\n00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Still doing the SAS model but\n\n289\n00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,980\nat the end of the day this is really\nwhat's gonna be important for you.\n\n290\n00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,615\nSo don't just walk away\nfrom the idea potentially.\n\n291\n00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:28,225\nThat there are external resources out\nthere that may be valuable for you.\n\n292\n00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:29,945\nYou may not choose to outsource but\n\n293\n00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,325\nthat doesn't mean it's not\navailable to you as an option.\n\n294\n00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:35,255\nI just wanna make sure you're thinking\nabout that and understanding that that is\n\n295\n00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:40,225\nsomething that could potentially play into\nyour plans here as we look at this model.\n\n296\n00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:42,395\nAll right, so thoughts or just questions?\n\n297\n00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:45,780\n>> Well, you know,\nit really can be useful to get an outside.\n\n298\n00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,400\nYou know, contractor or organization\nto come in because you know that second\n\n299\n00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,188\nset of eyes, someone with a different\nperspective on your organization can find\n\n300\n00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:55,989\npolicies or procedures that you\ncan implement that can help\n\n301\n00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,941\n>> Streamline or improve processes,\n\n302\n00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:02,240\ncould improve security in your environment\nand we get complacent sometimes.\n\n303\n00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,910\nWe get comfortable in our workplace and\nwith our procedures and\n\n304\n00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,810\ndon't necessarily recognize sometimes\nwhen something could be improved.\n\n305\n00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,650\nSo, definitely keep that in mind,\nand I know many organizations where\n\n306\n00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,650\nthey do their own internal security\naudits throughout the year but\n\n307\n00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,050\nthey still bring in an outside agency to\ndo an external audit at least once a year.\n\n308\n00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,530\nAgain, just getting that\nalternate perspective.\n\n309\n00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,200\n>> And, in many cases, it may be actually\nmandated by the government entity or\n\n310\n00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,460\nregulatory body depending on\nthe part of the world you're in,\n\n311\n00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,820\nit may not be specifically\njust the government.\n\n312\n00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,070\nThere may be bodies that are super- or\nextranational, that are regulating you.\n\n313\n00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,160\nBut at the end of the day,\nthere's requirements for this, right.\n\n314\n00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,060\nSo, in the US, you have HIPAA, for\ninstance, compliance Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\n315\n00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,380\nThere's Gramm Leach Bliley, the Bank\nSecurity Act or Bank Secrecy Act, rather.\n\n316\n00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,660\nSo there's a lot of different things\nhere in this country, in the US,\n\n317\n00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,290\nthat we have to abide by, but overseas\nin Europe, you have all sorts of privacy\n\n318\n00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,930\nregulatory requirements that are being put\nin place or are in place in the EU today.\n\n319\n00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,900\nThere's the safe harbor requirements,\nthat if you're doing business in the US or\n\n320\n00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,230\nrather as a US entity\ndoing business in Europe,\n\n321\n00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,480\nthat you have to abide by in some of\nthe more strict policy solutions.\n\n322\n00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,150\nAnd so there's a lot of legality that\ncomes into play here that you wanna\n\n323\n00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,790\nat least, do your due diligence around and\nbe aware of, let's put it that way.\n\n324\n00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,260\nSo having said that, let's talk a bit\nabout the building blocks, right.\n\n325\n00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,210\nSo what are our policies What\nare standards, procedures, baselines?\n\n326\n00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,100\nWhat are guidelines?\n\n327\n00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,450\nWhy are they important?\n\n328\n00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,740\nAnd so let's give some thought to this and\nlet's just document some of these.\n\n329\n00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,020\nSo we have policies.\n\n330\n00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,210\nWe have standards, procedures,\nbaselines and guidelines.\n\n331\n00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,480\nAll of these are considered\nsupporting mechanisms.\n\n332\n00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,220\nWe really see them as kind of being\nthe building blocks as I mentioned just\n\n333\n00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,980\na minute ago to being able to craft both\nsecurity policies for the organization\n\n334\n00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,890\nas well as security policies for\nindividual areas within the organization.\n\n335\n00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,600\nAnd so when we talk about these supporting\nelements that make up policies,\n\n336\n00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,640\nwe're talking about and\nlet's start with standards and\n\n337\n00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,390\nwe'll kind of go from there, right.\n\n338\n00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,350\nSo when we start with standards,\nwe're talking about defining\n\n339\n00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,220\nreally specific products and mechanisms\nthat are used to support policy.\n\n340\n00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,640\nSo a standard would be something that\nhelps us to understand for instance.\n\n341\n00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,810\nThat if we're gonna implement firewalls,\n\n342\n00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,980\nwe may only implement a 5th\ngeneration firewall, hypothetically,\n\n343\n00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,580\nor what would be called a next-gen\nfirewall generically today.\n\n344\n00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,030\nBut a 5th generation firewall and\n\n345\n00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,508\nwe may even go to the trouble of\ndeciding that we're only gonna implement\n\n346\n00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:24,380\nhardware-based versus software-based\nfirewalls as part of a standard.\n\n347\n00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,670\nWe wouldn't specify a vendor because\nthat would be something that we do\n\n348\n00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,050\na little bit later on down the road in\neither a guideline or perhaps a procedure\n\n349\n00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,350\nthat deals with implementing a certain\nkind of firewall from a vendor.\n\n350\n00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,280\nBut in a standard we would say we want\nfirewalls that are hardware as opposed to\n\n351\n00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,430\nsoftware based, we want a fifth gen or\nnext generation firewall, and we want this\n\n352\n00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,200\nfirewall to be able to do the following\nthings, whatever those things are.\n\n353\n00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,870\nAnd we would list out at a high level,\n\n354\n00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,960\nvery strategic,\nwhat those things will be, right.\n\n355\n00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280\nSo that's really what we're\nseeing as a standard.\n\n356\n00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,240\nHigher level, not the nuts and\nbolts of how we're gonna do it,\n\n357\n00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,610\nthat'll be a procedure.\n\n358\n00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,010\nNot the way in which we We do it,\n\n359\n00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,450\nthe guidelines that recommend\nhow to implement, but\n\n360\n00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,350\nrather the thought process around wrapping\nthat idea into a container that presents\n\n361\n00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,120\nit to the organization and gives us\nguidance about what we wanna go after.\n\n362\n00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,430\nWhat kind of architecture\ndo we wanna build?\n\n363\n00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,370\nStandards can come from\noutside the organization, so\n\n364\n00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,980\nthey may be generated\nby regulatory bodies.\n\n365\n00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,710\nthat could be offered by best practices or\nthrough best practices in industry.\n\n366\n00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,730\nSo, for\ninstance in the financial services sector,\n\n367\n00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,020\nthere are certain standards that\nare acceptable based on how you will\n\n368\n00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,010\ndo certain things to make\nsure you accomplish security.\n\n369\n00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,820\nIn the bio-pharma area, bio-pharmaceutical\narea and healthcare, there are standards.\n\n370\n00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,220\nA lot of these come from federal\nregulatory solutions within\n\n371\n00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,600\nthe United States or externally outside\nthe country from external bodies that\n\n372\n00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,810\nare helping to understand how to do\nthis in a more external level or\n\n373\n00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,720\njust a broader level than just in the US.\n\n374\n00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,680\nSo think about that.\n\n375\n00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,710\nRight bodies like the United Nations and\n\n376\n00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,950\nsome of those entities may offer\nstandards and guidance there as well.\n\n377\n00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,060\nThe World Intellectual\nProperty Organization,\n\n378\n00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,520\nWIPO, is a good example about how\nwe deal with intellectual property\n\n379\n00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,550\nout beyond the borders\nof a single country.\n\n380\n00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,660\nSo you have copyright, and patents and\n\n381\n00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,950\nthings of that nature\nis external to the US.\n\n382\n00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,590\nIt's not just a US concept in other words.\n\n383\n00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,480\nAnd there are standards that\nare international as a result.\n\n384\n00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,060\nSo, standards become very important.\n\n385\n00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,840\nAnd from standards, we go to procedures,\nand this idea of procedures is defining\n\n386\n00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,520\nactions that implement the policy,\nthe standards, and the baselines.\n\n387\n00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,590\nWe'll just kinda talk through what that\nis, and fill in the gaps with baselines\n\n388\n00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,690\nand guidelines in a minute, but\nthe idea of a procedure is very detailed,\n\n389\n00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,760\nthe exact mirror opposite of a standard,\nwhich is very high level.\n\n390\n00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,240\nA procedure is very detailed,\nstep by step, almost like a cookbook.\n\n391\n00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,120\nHere is what we're gonna do on\nthis particular step to implement.\n\n392\n00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,390\nAnd then this next step\ntakes us to this screen.\n\n393\n00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,280\nWe click this button,\nfill in this form, that kind of thing.\n\n394\n00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,990\nSo procedure's a very detailed step by\nstep guide to what we're gonna build, and\n\n395\n00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,660\nwe often see these, again,\nspecific to vendor.\n\n396\n00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,530\nThe vendor will put out a procedure\ndocument on how to implement\n\n397\n00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,520\ntheir solution and\nwhatever that may look like,\n\n398\n00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,660\nso Cisco may do that with their\nswitches or their routers or\n\n399\n00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,290\nthings of that nature, their NSA firewalls\nand all the other vendors do as well.\n\n400\n00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,890\nBaselines help us to\nfind minimum requirements\n\n401\n00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,340\nthat are going to basically achieve\na consistent level for security.\n\n402\n00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,040\nSo when we think about base lining a\nsystem, we're talking about setting up and\n\n403\n00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,490\nmaintaining the understanding of what\nminimum acceptable performance thresholds\n\n404\n00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,080\nare and maybe maximums depending\nthe the kind of system we're setting up.\n\n405\n00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,920\nBut these base lines are used to make sure\nthat we are monitoring the system and\n\n406\n00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,980\nunderstanding it's behavior over time.\n\n407\n00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,300\nSo base lines become important for\nexpected performance.\n\n408\n00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,133\nWhat is normal vs what is perhaps\noutside of the boundary of normal?\n\n409\n00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,800\nAnd then guidelines,\nwhich is our last item up there, right.\n\n410\n00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,450\nThey define the recommended, and this is\nimportant, recommended, not required,\n\n411\n00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,380\nbut recommended actions or\nthings we are going to do.\n\n412\n00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,250\nSo they are guidance as the name implies.\n\n413\n00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,290\nThey are not mandating\nthat we do something, but\n\n414\n00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,520\nthey are guiding us to\npotentially do things.\n\n415\n00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,350\nSo we often see best practices\ncreeping into our organization and\n\n416\n00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,270\nthe guys with guidelines as an example.\n\n417\n00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,020\nSo industry trade groups,\nentities like NIST, for\n\n418\n00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,120\ninstance, will offer guidelines about how\nwe may choose to approach something, and\n\n419\n00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,300\nthen those may become accepted\nstandards over time or norms.\n\n420\n00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,750\nBut they're not mandatory and\n\n421\n00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,700\nyou can't mandate a company do them,\nalthough you can strongly recommend that\n\n422\n00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,760\nyou perhaps follow them because of\nthe nature of what they represent.\n\n423\n00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,120\nSo just to understand\nthe difference there.\n\n424\n00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,440\nSo standards, procedures,\nbaselines and guidelines.\n\n425\n00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,280\nWhen we take all four of these,\nwe mix them together,\n\n426\n00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,230\nwe then ultimately are going to be able to\nbuild the policies that we need in order\n\n427\n00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,190\nto drive the organization forward and\ncreate a best practice solution.\n\n428\n00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,060\nThat is documented and this is a key\nconcept, documented and then shared widely\n\n429\n00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,180\nso that all members of the organization\nunderstand how to behave and interact.\n\n430\n00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,570\nAnd this is the part that\ncompanies often miss.\n\n431\n00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,850\nThey get really good at figuring\nout how to use the building blocks,\n\n432\n00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,990\nthe standards the guidelines,\ndo the measurements, create the baselines,\n\n433\n00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,090\ncreate the policies, and\ndocument everything.\n\n434\n00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,380\nBut then they often forget to communicate\nwidely what the expectation is by\n\n435\n00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,170\ndocumenting a policy and\nmaking sure everybody understands it, so\n\n436\n00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,710\nwe wanna make sure that we help you to\nunderstand what a policy looks like.\n\n437\n00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,470\nAnd where you can maybe find some\ntemplates that will be helpful for\n\n438\n00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,720\nyou to that end, and so\nwhen we think about writing policies,\n\n439\n00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,230\nI often get asked this, by the way.\n\n440\n00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,930\nStudents of mine, customers of mine,\npeople I will do business with,\n\n441\n00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,730\ncome in and say, hey,\nwe need to figure this or that out.\n\n442\n00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,460\nWe're not really comfortable\nwriting this policy.\n\n443\n00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,240\nWe may never have done one before.\n\n444\n00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,040\nDo you have a template?\n\n445\n00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,780\nI often get asked that.\n\n446\n00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,400\nDon, you may get asked that\nby people in class as well.\n\n447\n00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,660\nWhen you're talking to people,\nyou have a sample, right.\n\n448\n00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,100\nYou have something I can look at.\n\n449\n00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,590\nAnd the answer is absolutely, there\nare many places out there to find them.\n\n450\n00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,425\nSo Don has the NIST website up, and\n\n451\n00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:49,729\nthe NIST website is a great place to go to\nlook for standards that can helpful, and\n\n452\n00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:54,057\nguidelines that could be helpful for you\nto understand how to do certain things.\n\n453\n00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,914\nAnd NIST has a great little search engine\nup at the top there that will help you to\n\n454\n00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:02,065\njust go and type in a topic of some kind,\nwhatever it may be, change management, for\n\n455\n00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,850\nexample.\n\n456\n00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,270\nAnd you can search and find all sorts\nof things that may come up there as,\n\n457\n00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,940\ninsights on change management, and\nall sorts of different things.\n\n458\n00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,470\nMaybe typing in something like\nvirtualization, or memory management.\n\n459\n00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,390\nOr who knows what,\n\n460\n00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,220\nwould bring up all sorts of documentation\nthere that could be helpful.\n\n461\n00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,450\nAnd there are some missed standards\nout there for virtualization.\n\n462\n00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,370\nSecurity, for instance, the one that you\nhave at the top of the screen there would\n\n463\n00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,970\nbe a good one to take a look at.\n\n464\n00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,870\nSo, that's one thing that\nwe can take a look at.\n\n465\n00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,190\nThose are some guidelines right there, and\nyou'll see there depending on what it is.\n\n466\n00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,200\nThis is I think 800-125,\nthe special publication.\n\n467\n00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,340\nSo, this is the one on virtualization\nsecurity in the stack.\n\n468\n00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,890\nIt was written back in 2011, so\nonly a few years old at this point.\n\n469\n00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,320\nAnd these guidelines, by the way,\ntend to be updated on\n\n470\n00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,340\na three to six year cycle depending\non what we're talking about.\n\n471\n00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,390\nSo to see something written back in 11,\nis not unusual when you go back and\n\n472\n00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,610\nlook two or three years back,\nso just understand that.\n\n473\n00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,660\nBut this is what a guideline\nmay look like, right?\n\n474\n00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,386\nCorrect, so it's gonna be\na collection of best practices, and\n\n475\n00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:03,200\nunderstanding then what you can look at,\nand recommend that your entity may do.\n\n476\n00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,667\nWhen we look at policies and look for\npolicy templates, we might wanna go\n\n477\n00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:10,010\nthe SANs website that we had discussed and\ntake you look at the SANs,\n\n478\n00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,150\nreading room specifically the policy area,\nthey have a little policy library there.\n\n479\n00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,390\nIs gonna be great, because you can get all\nof these templates that SANs puts out for\n\n480\n00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,500\nyou, and they're free.\n\n481\n00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,180\nYou can download them.\n\n482\n00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,830\nWe're gonna bring this website up for\nyou in just a second.\n\n483\n00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,860\nAnd the SANs policy library is gonna have\nboth Word and PDF versions of these,\n\n484\n00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,910\ndocuments which you can download and\nyou can see it here on the screen.\n\n485\n00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,650\nSo, they walk through the conceptual\nidea of what an Info Sec Policy or\n\n486\n00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,740\na Template is.\n\n487\n00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,760\nAnd then as we scroll down, to the second\ntier there below some of those, you'll see\n\n488\n00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,910\nthings like Audit Security Policy, Mobile\nSecurity Policy, Wireless Security Policy.\n\n489\n00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,330\nAll of these are there, and\nwe can go through and download one and\n\n490\n00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,380\nmaybe we can just grab one.\n\n491\n00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,240\nMaybe, the mere Wireless Security Policy\nthat'll be great.\n\n492\n00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,990\nLet's just take a look at one, and\njust show you what it looks like.\n\n493\n00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,560\nSo, we can see down there when we\nclick in, we have both the PDF and\n\n494\n00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,150\na Word version of that.\n\n495\n00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,610\nAnd it's a template, literally, so\n\n496\n00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,960\nit's a document that has insert here\nright bracketed form right literally.\n\n497\n00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,480\nSomebody wrote this,\nthis is what a template looks like.\n\n498\n00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,380\nAnd you just take out the company name\nbracket, insert ABC Corp or whatever, and\n\n499\n00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,690\nas you go through and\ndo a find and replace.\n\n500\n00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,210\nYou literally have a boilerplate,\n\n501\n00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,330\nas we call it, template that can\nbe starting the process for you.\n\n502\n00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,520\nThis may not be what your policy\nultimately looks like two years from now,\n\n503\n00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,120\nbecause you're gonna add and\nmodify, obviously, and\n\n504\n00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,010\ncreate some additional capabilities\nthere based on what you put in.\n\n505\n00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,370\nBut, if you start out\nwith something like this,\n\n506\n00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,030\nthis is gonna help you get the training\nwheels on and really get down the road.\n\n507\n00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,230\nAnd then over time you\nmodify this as needed.\n\n508\n00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,950\nBut as you can see, it's several pages,\ndepending on the topic we're talking\n\n509\n00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,080\nabout, and has the ability for\nyou to very quickly customize as needed.\n\n510\n00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240\nWhen I come into a customer site,\n\n511\n00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,000\nand I'm asked to do some auditing work,\nand I'll come in and\n\n512\n00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,440\ntalk to a customer as an auditor to\nunderstand what documentation they have.\n\n513\n00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,020\nI ask for these kinds of things.\n\n514\n00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,710\nI ask to see your policies.\n\n515\n00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,070\nI ask to see the guidelines that you are\nreferencing to build your documentation,\n\n516\n00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,020\nI ask to see baselines.\n\n517\n00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,030\nAnd if you can't provide that\ndocumentation to me as an auditor,\n\n518\n00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,300\nthen you're gonna have a problem.\n\n519\n00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,270\nBecause I'm not gonna take that as a sign,\nthat you are really understanding\n\n520\n00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,260\nhow to manage security\neffectively in the organization.\n\n521\n00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,295\nBecause, what that tells me is that there\nprobably isn't very good documentation\n\n522\n00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:27,590\navailable, that's up to date and\n\n523\n00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,630\ncommunicated widely to\nall of the customers.\n\n524\n00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,350\nAll of the users in other words inside the\nsystem, that have to understand how to use\n\n525\n00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,720\nit effectively, and so\nthis is a red flag for an auditor.\n\n526\n00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,530\nAnd we will recommend to you, we may not\nrecommend you go to the SANs library and\n\n527\n00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,050\nget the documentation, but\nwe will recommend to you\n\n528\n00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:47,160\nthat it has to be written down, has to\nbe vetted, has to be kept up to date.\n\n529\n00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,260\nAnd that this is part of the ongoing\nmaintenance that goes on on a daily,\n\n530\n00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,860\nweekly, monthly, quarterly,\nsemi-annual, and\n\n531\n00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,210\nannual checklist that you have to build,\nin order to be able to really do\n\n532\n00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,970\ninformation security from a management\nperspective appropriately.\n\n533\n00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,680\n>> Yeah, and that's one of\nthe nicest things about these,\n\n534\n00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,535\nis you can download the policy\nas a starting point.\n\n535\n00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:08,105\n>> And then you can modify it to\nmeet the needs of your organization.\n\n536\n00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,965\nOnce you have it in black and\nwhite on paper, if you\n\n537\n00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:15,875\nhave 20 network admins on your team,\nyou can give them a copy of this policy.\n\n538\n00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,780\nAnd they know exactly what\nthey're responsible for covering.\n\n539\n00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,210\nIf you just say something\nin the middle of a room,\n\n540\n00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,270\nyou get ten people that\nhear it ten different ways.\n\n541\n00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,450\nIt's like that telephone game you played\nas a kid, and so things get distorted.\n\n542\n00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,880\nBut when it's in black and white, and\n\n543\n00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,900\nit's right there,\nyou can make sure that it's consistent.\n\n544\n00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,590\nThat's really what policies are all about.\n\n545\n00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,560\nIs creating consistency\nthrough your environment.\n\n546\n00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,090\n>> Absolutely.\n\n547\n00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,300\nAnd in addition, they also provide\nthe ability to make sure we are aligned.\n\n548\n00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,560\nAn alignment is critical,\n\n549\n00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,290\nbecause what the policy represents is\nbasically the intent of the business.\n\n550\n00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,630\nWhat are the business goals, the\nobjectives the business is looking for?\n\n551\n00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,780\nAnd we're documenting those in writing so\n\n552\n00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,270\nthey're unequivocal, everybody gets it,\nthey know what they are.\n\n553\n00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,270\nThere's really no he said she said,\nI meant this, I thought that.\n\n554\n00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,550\nIt's written in black and\nwhite, it's unequivocal,\n\n555\n00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,910\neverybody understands we're pulling\ntowards a common area where we wanna be,\n\n556\n00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,420\nand that is defined as\nwhat success equals.\n\n557\n00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,280\nSuccess is all mobile devices\nare secured at the border,\n\n558\n00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,790\nat the entry point to the network,\nand this is what security means.\n\n559\n00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,840\nThen if you follow the policy,\nif it's written down in black and white,\n\n560\n00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,670\nwe know whether or not you're compliant.\n\n561\n00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,950\nAnd either you are or\nare not following the policy, and we do or\n\n562\n00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,770\ndo not have success as a result.\n\n563\n00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,120\nSo, really establishing that\norganizational buy-in and that alignment,\n\n564\n00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,100\nis what the key operational criteria for\nthe policy isn't what it represents.\n\n565\n00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,650\nWe define that, we publish it,\nwe stand on it, we train on it, and\n\n566\n00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,740\nthen we remind you of it relentlessly.\n\n567\n00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,450\nIt seems like on a quarterly,\n\n568\n00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,870\nperhaps even semi-annual, certainly annual\nbasis during security awareness training.\n\n569\n00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,600\nAnd that review yearly is part of that\nprocess, so please be aware of that.\n\n570\n00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,630\nSo remember, you have things and\n\n571\n00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:52,290\nthere's a non-authoritative, non-full\nlist by any means on this website.\n\n572\n00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,930\nSANs has a small sampling.\n\n573\n00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,100\nThere are many policies depending\non the industry you're in.\n\n574\n00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,930\nBut the idea is, that you have to\nfigure out what is pertinent to you,\n\n575\n00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,850\nbased on what you do, and\nthen go out and look for some guidance.\n\n576\n00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,800\nAnd don't ever be afraid, to ask\nsomebody who is in a position perhaps\n\n577\n00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,130\nlateral to you, senior to you, a peer, a\ncolleague, what's your opinion about this,\n\n578\n00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,940\ndo you think we need a policy about this,\n\n579\n00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,900\ndo you guys have a policy about\nthis at your place of work?\n\n580\n00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,160\nNetwork with peers and\n\n581\n00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,250\nprofessionals in other words, to tap into\ntheir knowledge and share their knowledge.\n\n582\n00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,510\nI'm always getting asked wherever I go,\nwhenever I speak, whatever I do,\n\n583\n00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,820\nanything, do you know about a policy for\nthis particular area?\n\n584\n00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,120\nDo you do any work in\nextractive industries?\n\n585\n00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,820\nWhat kind of policies do we need,\nif we got a bunch of people running around\n\n586\n00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,560\na mine, with computers linked up to GPSes,\nand what do we do to secure information?\n\n587\n00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,710\nI may not know that, but\nI know that I can go out and\n\n588\n00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,880\nfind you somebody who does, and so\nif you ask me, I may not hand it to you.\n\n589\n00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,930\nBut, I'm gonna hand you a resource\nthat can find it for you, and\n\n590\n00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,540\nthat's really critical in this pursuit,\nright?\n\n591\n00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,050\nBeing able to figure out how to\nbecome a security professional,\n\n592\n00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,980\nit's not necessarily what you know.\n\n593\n00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,790\nIt's understanding what you dont know, and\n\n594\n00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,220\nnot being afraid to figure\nout how to find it?\n\n595\n00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,170\nAnd that's the mistake most of us make.\n\n596\n00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,610\nWe're not willing to admit we don't know\ncertain things, and we bluff our way\n\n597\n00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,960\nthrough and let me be perfectly,\n[LAUGH] brutally honest with you.\n\n598\n00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,470\nWe know when you're bluffing right?\n\n599\n00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,630\nSo, when you come to me and\ntalk to me about something, and\n\n600\n00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,040\nyou're trying to sound all cool and\nhip and use those terms you found on\n\n601\n00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,040\nGoogle when you did a quick five\nminute search, I know that.\n\n602\n00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,840\nAnd I know that you're probably\nnot comfortable with technology.\n\n603\n00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,280\nIt'd be a lot better for you to just\ntell me, I think I understand this, but\n\n604\n00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,170\nI'm not sure.\n\n605\n00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,270\nCan you help me?\n\n606\n00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,810\nAnd then that's the best approach\nin every situation, right?\n\n607\n00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,190\nHonesty is the best policy, as they say.\n\n608\n00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,920\n>> Yeah, I remember the first\ntime that I was responsible for\n\n609\n00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,310\nwriting a security policy.\n\n610\n00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,110\nI was working for an insurance company.\n\n611\n00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,860\nAnd I'm an IT guy.\n\n612\n00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,070\nI know about servers, and\nfirewalls, and stuff.\n\n613\n00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,626\nInsurance, I don't know all,\nI was learning as fast as I could,\n\n614\n00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:47,310\nbut I only knew so much.\n\n615\n00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,070\nAnd so when it came to\ndrafting that security policy,\n\n616\n00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:53,280\none of the things I didn't know was, what\nlegal obligations did our company have,\n\n617\n00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,830\nwhat did we have to adhere to?\n\n618\n00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,510\nAnd I spent the bulk of my\ntime not talking to IT people,\n\n619\n00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,598\nnot looking on Microsoft site,\nor Redhat side or wherever.\n\n620\n00:32:02,598 --> 00:32:06,512\nBut in our legal department,\ntalking to the attorneys and saying, hey,\n\n621\n00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:09,540\nunder federal law,\nwhat obligations do we have?\n\n622\n00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,430\nUnder state law,\nwhat obligations do we have?\n\n623\n00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:17,750\nUnder local and municipality,\nwhat other laws apply?\n\n624\n00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,270\nIn the United States, the insurance\nindustry is heavily regulated, and\n\n625\n00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,040\nso there's requirements at each\nlevel that have to be met.\n\n626\n00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,000\nThat was really the driving force\nbehind the majority of our IT policy.\n\n627\n00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,840\nNot so much what we needed internally.\n\n628\n00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,100\nOur internal needs were very, very simple.\n\n629\n00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:37,840\nBut the federal, state, local,\nthose laws really kind of govern\n\n630\n00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,450\nhow that information was to be gathered,\nmaintained, it really did dictate that.\n\n631\n00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,450\nI also worked in the financial industry,\nand you have the same thing there.\n\n632\n00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,610\nFederally regulated, so\nyou have a lot of requirements coming down\n\n633\n00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,765\nfrom the federal government, not so\nmuch on the state and local side.\n\n634\n00:32:51,765 --> 00:32:55,450\nSo you check with the attorneys,\ncuz they went to law school.\n\n635\n00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,750\nThey know,\nthey've got that information, and\n\n636\n00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,060\nyou use that to augment your\nsecurity policies as you build them.\n\n637\n00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,460\n>> Absolutely, saving the world one law\ncase at a time, very important right?\n\n638\n00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,936\n>> That's right, you can never\nhave too many attorneys, right?\n\n639\n00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:06,020\n[LAUGH]\n>> Never, absolutely not.\n\n640\n00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,660\nSo when you talk about best\npractices in the security area,\n\n641\n00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,170\nto kind of bring this back full circle,\nand wrap up this thought process, and\n\n642\n00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,648\nthis part of our conversation.\n\n643\n00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:17,810\nWe really wanna understand right that\nawareness is important, asking for\n\n644\n00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,750\nhelp when you need it important.\n\n645\n00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,850\nWe've talked about all those things.\n\n646\n00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,530\nBut let's talk about some of the nuts and\nbolts,\n\n647\n00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,090\nsome of the things that go into this\nspecifically, aside from just writing.\n\n648\n00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,700\nRight, which is defining job roles and\njob descriptions.\n\n649\n00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,540\nIt's very important to document that\nlateral to your security policies.\n\n650\n00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,730\nNothing worse than having a very\ndetailed set of policies, but\n\n651\n00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,910\nthen not having job descriptions that tell\nus who's supposed to be responsible for\n\n652\n00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,380\nmanaging those things and\nhow they get implemented.\n\n653\n00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,160\nSo again, when I come in and do auditing\nwork and I ask you and you sit down and\n\n654\n00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,869\nsay, hey I need some help,\nhow do we figure this out?\n\n655\n00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:49,765\nI'm gonna ask you to see your job\ndescriptions, and you're gonna tell me,\n\n656\n00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:52,270\nhopefully, this role is gonna\nbe responsible for these things.\n\n657\n00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,998\nAnd as a result,\n\n658\n00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:56,587\nI see that map very clearly over to what\npolicies they're gonna be involved with.\n\n659\n00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:59,261\nAnd if we don't see that,\nwe're gonna ask you to sit down and\n\n660\n00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:00,844\nreally think through what that is.\n\n661\n00:34:00,844 --> 00:34:04,564\nIf your best answer to do I have\na job description is I think so,\n\n662\n00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:07,010\nyou probably need to come back and look.\n\n663\n00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,151\nIf your best answer to when was the last\ntime your job description was updated\n\n664\n00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:14,200\nwas I don't know,\nthen we gotta go back and take a look.\n\n665\n00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,420\nAnd I don't make this stuff up,\nI hear this all the time.\n\n666\n00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,860\nAll the time.\n\n667\n00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,420\nPlease be aware of that, define roles and\n\n668\n00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,750\nresponsibilities, super critical, can't\nsay enough about how important that is.\n\n669\n00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,690\nThe ideas about lease privilege and\nneed to know, also super critical.\n\n670\n00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,360\nSo this idea of when write\ndown what a job role is,\n\n671\n00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,420\nthe idea of making sure we\nclearly define who does what.\n\n672\n00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,780\nBut also as a result who doesn't do what,\nis not just implied, but stated firmly.\n\n673\n00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,690\nSo let me give you a practical,\nreal-world example of this.\n\n674\n00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:50,570\nI have a customer that is in\nthe extractive and kind of\n\n675\n00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,910\nnatural resources area, they do a lot of\nwork in oil, natural gas things like that.\n\n676\n00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,040\nPrecious metals.\n\n677\n00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,720\nAnd so one of the things that's\nvery important in that industry,\n\n678\n00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,810\nespecially in the precious metal side,\nis who gets to handle precious metals,\n\n679\n00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,840\nand under what circumstances.\n\n680\n00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,760\nBecause that's the kind of that\nthing that you're not 100% clear on,\n\n681\n00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,710\nall of a sudden your profit walks\nout the door with whoever might or\n\n682\n00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,660\nmight not have put their hands on that\nstuff at any point in the process.\n\n683\n00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,590\nSo getting that understanding\nof least privilege.\n\n684\n00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,350\nWho has access?\n\n685\n00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,080\nWho has permission?\n\n686\n00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,230\nWho can do this?\n\n687\n00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,220\nAnd need to know.\n\n688\n00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,760\nWho has rights to know what the process\nis, where this information is stored, and\n\n689\n00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,810\nwhat they're supposed to do with it?\n\n690\n00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,910\nEqually important, separation of duties.\n\n691\n00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,370\nRight?\nMaking sure that the same\n\n692\n00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,440\nperson that backs up the tapes nightly,\nor does the tape backup nightly, is not\n\n693\n00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,050\nthe same person that has responsibilities\nfor restoring is important.\n\n694\n00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,770\nBecause if we don't separate those duties,\nthen they can basically go and\n\n695\n00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,170\nmodify information, right?\n\n696\n00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,460\nAnd then they can cover their tracks and\nhide the fact they did it.\n\n697\n00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:52,430\nAnd there's no record, no value there to\nthe logs, because the logs are modified by\n\n698\n00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,020\nthe same person that carried out the\nsurreptitious attack in the first place.\n\n699\n00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,330\nSo in small companies\nthis becomes a big issue.\n\n700\n00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:02,030\nI talked to a lot of practitioners\nthat are an army of one, or\n\n701\n00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,590\nmaybe an army of one and a half,\ncuz you have a junior, right?\n\n702\n00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,260\nOr several people that are involved but\nthey don't know as much as you.\n\n703\n00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,800\nAnd it seems like you're constantly\nrunning around and doing everything.\n\n704\n00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,240\nSeparation of duties may be\ntough in that area, right?\n\n705\n00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,280\nAs is job rotation, another very\nimportant concept where we rotate people\n\n706\n00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,610\nthrough jobs in order to make sure they\nunderstand that they are cross training,\n\n707\n00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,260\nso there is a value to the business there.\n\n708\n00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,660\nBut also so the business knows that\none person is not doing this and\n\n709\n00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,800\nnothing else for so long, that they could\npotentially obscure information, hide it,\n\n710\n00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,270\nand potentially manipulate it.\n\n711\n00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,888\nThere were a lot of cases back in\nthe 80s during the whole focus on.\n\n712\n00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:37,200\nYou have the drug boom\nin the United States and\n\n713\n00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,860\nthe drug wars where you had people that\nwere running mail rooms in these huge\n\n714\n00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,950\ncompanies embedded there for years.\n\n715\n00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,990\nNever moved out of those positions, right?\n\n716\n00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,620\nYou worked in financial and insurance\ncompanies and may not have worked at that\n\n717\n00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,755\ntime, but certainly saw these\nbig mail rooms, right Don?\n\n718\n00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:52,960\n>> Mm-hm, absolutely.\n>> And had these things going on, and so\n\n719\n00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,320\nthere were some very famous stories where\nthere were a lot of drugs being shipped\n\n720\n00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,990\nthrough some of these entities, and\n\n721\n00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,970\nthe people that ran the mail rooms were\ntypically at the head of these rigs.\n\n722\n00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,500\nUnless they left to go on vacation or\nsomething happened,\n\n723\n00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,250\nthey had a system in place, nobody knew\nthe drugs were coming in and going out.\n\n724\n00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,150\nBut there was one story where this guy\nwho was in charge of this mail room,\n\n725\n00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,410\nwent on vacation, I guess forgot to tell\nthe suppliers, hey I'm not gonna be there.\n\n726\n00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,000\nCouple of large shipments had come in,\nwere sitting on the dock.\n\n727\n00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,640\nAnd were just there and\nnobody knew what to do with them,\n\n728\n00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,520\nbecause this guy ruled with an iron\nfist and everything was done his way.\n\n729\n00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,540\nSat there for a while.\n\n730\n00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,070\nHe was away.\n\n731\n00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,580\nNothing.\n\n732\n00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,088\nNobody knew about it.\n\n733\n00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:29,260\nNothing happened.\n\n734\n00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,460\nSomehow one of the boxes got knocked over,\nsomething happened.\n\n735\n00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,315\nThey figured out there was something\nkind of subtly wrong with this, right?\n\n736\n00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:37,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Duct tape and plastic wasn't what\n\n737\n00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,530\nwe were expecting when we opened up the\noffice supplies box, that kind of thing.\n\n738\n00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,100\nAnd led to the fact that they uncovered\nthere was a major drug ring being run out\n\n739\n00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,490\nof one of these little entities.\n\n740\n00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:50,020\nSo job rotation is super, super important.\n\n741\n00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,330\nAs are mandatory vacations,\n\n742\n00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:56,000\nthese are all things that can enforce as\npart of documenting and creating controls.\n\n743\n00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,530\nAnd so all of these ideas\nbecome very important and\n\n744\n00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,770\nthings that you wanna make sure\nyou're aware of you're and\n\n745\n00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,660\nthinking about as part of this idea of\nhow we create policy and we document.\n\n746\n00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,940\nAll very important.\n\n747\n00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,470\n>> Absolutely.\n>> The last area that we probably\n\n748\n00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,100\nwanna talk about quickly as we\n\n749\n00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,960\nfinish our thoughts on this particular\ndiscussion is information classification.\n\n750\n00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,000\nSo what is information?\n\n751\n00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,400\nHow do we classify it?\n\n752\n00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,980\nWhy is it important to classify it?\n\n753\n00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,540\nWe talked about this idea of things like,\nis it secret?\n\n754\n00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,950\nIs it top secret?\n\n755\n00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,400\nThat's one way to think about it but\n\n756\n00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,230\nmost businesses don't really classify that\nway, that's a government military thing.\n\n757\n00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,330\nSo in the private sector you don't\ntend to see top secret information.\n\n758\n00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,620\nBut what you get is you get resources that\nhave permissions applied to them through\n\n759\n00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,060\neither a discretionary or\n\n760\n00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,790\nmaybe a mandatory access control model,\nif we are classifying data.\n\n761\n00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,070\nBut the idea of being able to mark and\nlabel and\n\n762\n00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:47,460\ncreate assurance around this idea of data\nclassification becomes very important.\n\n763\n00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,310\nSo financial data tends to get\ntreated differently in businesses than\n\n764\n00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,360\njust normal data that's being produced for\na report for instance.\n\n765\n00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,186\nSo understanding private sector ,where we\ntend to create the ownership of a document\n\n766\n00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:00,750\nDon as I think is writing down there.\n\n767\n00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,120\nWe create our own files and then we own\nit and then really from that stand point\n\n768\n00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,210\ndecide what is done with it,\nis one way of looking at classifying and\n\n769\n00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,530\nunderstanding how\nclassification can take place.\n\n770\n00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,210\nSo we look at value of information\nwhen we classify, very important.\n\n771\n00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,320\nAnd remember, classification\nultimately is the responsibility of\n\n772\n00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,830\nthe owner of the information,\nhowever we get there.\n\n773\n00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,570\nAnd so the value of the data,\nlike really as Don is pointing out and\n\n774\n00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:26,302\nabsolutely is typing as we're speaking, is\nit's almost like you're reading my mind.\n\n775\n00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:28,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where we have voice control.\n\n776\n00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,025\nLike I'm controlling your hands,\nthat's so incredible.\n\n777\n00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:30,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n778\n00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,440\nthe idea that the value of the data\ndetermines the sensitivity\n\n779\n00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,290\nis a very important concept.\n\n780\n00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,210\nBut also this idea that\nclassification is the responsibility\n\n781\n00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,473\nof the information owner\nis equally important.\n\n782\n00:39:40,473 --> 00:39:43,255\nBecause we wanna make sure that\nwe understand that the owner of\n\n783\n00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:47,025\nthe information, we actually refer\nto it as the creator owner, right?\n\n784\n00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:51,005\nSo the creator owner of the information\ngets to decide how to dispose of that\n\n785\n00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:52,815\ninformation over its life-cycle.\n\n786\n00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:53,565\nWho's gonna see it?\n\n787\n00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:54,570\nWho's gonna interact with it?\n\n788\n00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,636\nAnd in some cases,\nwho doesn't as a result.\n\n789\n00:39:56,636 --> 00:40:00,711\nSo these are all important concepts to,\nJust bear in mind it to be aware of.\n\n790\n00:40:00,711 --> 00:40:04,397\nAnd remember we typically give\npeople access to data, we grant them\n\n791\n00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:08,740\nclearance in order to see the data, and\nwe classify the data as a result of that.\n\n792\n00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,780\nSo the clearance associated\nwith the classification.\n\n793\n00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,240\nTends to become the building blocks\naround the formula to equal access, and\n\n794\n00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,938\none is to make sure we're\naware of that as well.\n\n795\n00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:22,970\n>> It is important the data itself\nplays a big part in this so,\n\n796\n00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:27,590\nthe vacation schedule of our CEO is a lot\nmore sensitive than the vacation schedule\n\n797\n00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,480\nof one of our mail room clerks.\n\n798\n00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,480\nEach one has different impacts on the\norganization should people find it out,\n\n799\n00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,970\nand so that definitely influences that.\n\n800\n00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,900\nSo, it's not something a computer can do.\n\n801\n00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,040\nA computer can't just automatically\nfigure out the classification of data.\n\n802\n00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,660\nWe typically need that human element.\n\n803\n00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,318\nAnd, the human element needs guidelines or\npolicies, or some kind of a structure to\n\n804\n00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:51,225\nbe able to know what security\nlevel gets applied to what data.\n\n805\n00:40:51,225 --> 00:40:52,715\n>> Absolutely correct.\n\n806\n00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:54,627\nGood.\nVery important.\n\n807\n00:40:54,627 --> 00:40:57,045\n>> All right well I think that does\na pretty good job of hitting all that.\n\n808\n00:40:57,045 --> 00:40:59,730\nYou got any other points that we\nneed to cover before we wrap up?\n\n809\n00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,790\n>> No, I think we're good there.\n\n810\n00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:05,040\nJust basically to remind you of some of\nthe resources we've thrown at you that\n\n811\n00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,260\nare in the notes and some of those\nwebsites, like Sam's, for instance.\n\n812\n00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,080\nAnd this again, would be helpful to you.\n\n813\n00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,070\nAnd don't be afraid, as I said,\nto network with peers and colleagues.\n\n814\n00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:18,100\nProbably the most valuable thing I've done\nand learned to do over the many years I've\n\n815\n00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,660\nbeen doing information security is to talk\nto people about what they do and find out\n\n816\n00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,720\nhow they approach doing things, because\nthere's always another way that I haven't\n\n817\n00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,510\nthought of, always another approach\nthat I may or may not be aware of.\n\n818\n00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,950\nYou know figure out if there's a user\ngroup in your community locally that you\n\n819\n00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,040\ncan become a member of, figure out if\nthere's an interest group, or some sort of\n\n820\n00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,200\nprofessional association, joining things\nlike IFC squared to become certified.\n\n821\n00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,670\nIt's important, but there's also local\noptions that you can engage in as well,\n\n822\n00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,450\nand we recommend you try to figure\nthose things out and perhaps take\n\n823\n00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:50,110\na look at them as another resource,\nanother way to get access to information.\n\n824\n00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,440\n>> Absolutely.\n\n825\n00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,520\nAll right, well let me just take\na minute to remind you guys,\n\n826\n00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,654\nif you ever have any\nquestions on all of this,\n\n827\n00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:59,000\nyou can always catch us live during\nthe show if you got to itpro.tv/live.\n\n828\n00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,960\nWhich is probably where\nsome of you are right now.\n\n829\n00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,760\nYou'll see the chat room\nright beneath the video.\n\n830\n00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,010\nYou can post your questions there.\n\n831\n00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,868\nWe monitor and answer.\n\n832\n00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:06,470\n>> We do.\n\n833\n00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,160\n>> And\neven if you have questions after the show,\n\n834\n00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,330\nif you're watching this recorded.\n\n835\n00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,080\nWhich I know a lot of you will,\nmake sure you make use of the Q&A section.\n\n836\n00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,160\nAt the top of every one of our\npages is a link that says Q&A.\n\n837\n00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,150\nTakes you into our question, answer forum.\n\n838\n00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,050\nPost your questions there.\n\n839\n00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,840\nAnd again, we monitor and\nanswer there too.\n\n840\n00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,020\n>> We do.\nWe look forward to getting\n\n841\n00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,780\nfrom you, by the way.\n\n842\n00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,120\nWe're kind of lonely, just me and\nDon talking to each other in the studio.\n\n843\n00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,710\nSo, it would be great if you did\nshare some feedback with us.\n\n844\n00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,980\nAnd all kidding aside,\nwhether you do it live or after the fact.\n\n845\n00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,040\nAnd obviously if you\ndon't see the show live,\n\n846\n00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,200\nyou get the opportunity,\nto look at it at some point later.\n\n847\n00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,050\nSo take that idea,\nrun with it, ask the questions.\n\n848\n00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,280\nIt's the questions you don't ask,\n\n849\n00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,780\nultimately that are the ones\nthat are most valuable to you.\n\n850\n00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,530\nBecause they are going to be\nthe ones you really want to know.\n\n851\n00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,560\nBut, if you don't ask them,\nwe can't give you the answers.\n\n852\n00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,740\nAnd, we'd love to help you\nfigure that stuff out.\n\n853\n00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,780\nSo, I'll challenge you to\nthink about doing that but\n\n854\n00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,680\nalso encourage you to\nconsider trying that.\n\n855\n00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,562\nI think we'll both find it's\nvery valuable if you do.\n\n856\n00:42:57,562 --> 00:43:00,290\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, let's wrap it up here.\n\n857\n00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,760\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n858\n00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,994\nSigning out for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n859\n00:43:03,994 --> 00:43:05,320\n>> And I\"m Adam Gordon.\n\n860\n00:43:05,320 -->

00:00:39,980\nwelcome back to another episode of\nIT Pro TV I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,640\nToday once again with Mr.\nAdam Gordon, how's it going Adam?\n\n5\n00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,320\n>> Howdy, good.\n\n6\n00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,500\nHow's everybody doing?\n\n7\n00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,860\n>> We are pumped up and\nexcited to continue our SSCP adventure.\n\n8\n00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,410\nI know our last episode was a little bit\nof a short one as we kind of introduced\n\n9\n00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,460\nsecurity operations and administration,\nand now we're gonna continue on with some\n\n10\n00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,480\nof the more significant, more tangible\nparts of what's required of us in just,\n\n11\n00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,460\nthe regular operation of our organization,\nhow we can maintain a proper level of\n\n12\n00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,512\nsecurity, and then just proper\nprocedures throughout our organization.\n\n13\n00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:11,950\n>> Absolutely.\n\n14\n00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,030\nAnd it's very important thought process\nas we get back into our conversations.\n\n15\n00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,520\nPreparedness in general,\nobviously something really important.\n\n16\n00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,330\nAnd we talk a lot about\nsecurity awareness, and\n\n17\n00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,240\nthis idea of making sure that\neverybody knows their responsibility.\n\n18\n00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,180\nWe talked about job roles and defining\nthem, and documenting things clearly, and\n\n19\n00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,520\nmaking sure all that stuff happens, right?\n\n20\n00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,910\nThinking about those kinda things\nas a theme, as we keep going,\n\n21\n00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,930\nis gonna be important.\n\n22\n00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,770\nAnd we're gonna talk more about that.\n\n23\n00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,610\nWe're gonna start by talking a little bit\nabout this idea of system life-cycles,\n\n24\n00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,810\nand, right, what they are,\nhow we deal with them.\n\n25\n00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,470\nWhy are they important?\n\n26\n00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,820\nThis idea of having an overall plan.\n\n27\n00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,790\nWhenever we do anything\nit's obviously important.\n\n28\n00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,060\nIf you go, and\n\n29\n00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,620\nyou think about the idea that maybe\nyou wanna go food shopping, right?\n\n30\n00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,290\nSo you're gonna typically make a list.\n\n31\n00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,270\nCome up with a plan, get your coupons\ntogether if you're one of those people\n\n32\n00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,040\nthat does coupons, and you're gonna\ngo execute your mission, come back\n\n33\n00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,230\nhopefully with not more stuff than you\nneed, but the right amount of stuff.\n\n34\n00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,350\nSpend the right amount of\nmoney based on your budget.\n\n35\n00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,530\nAnd if you do that consistently, you're\ngonna be able to execute successfully\n\n36\n00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,960\nthe idea of going food shopping,\n\n37\n00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,715\nstaying on budget, and/or using\ncoupons to maybe come in under budget.\n\n38\n00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:17,860\nThe same idea applies,\nwhen we think about security.\n\n39\n00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,620\nWe wanna have a plan, an overall strategy,\nwhich is our end goal.\n\n40\n00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,240\nTypically business goals\nare thought of as strategies.\n\n41\n00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,370\nWe wanna figure out how to support and\nalign those strategies,\n\n42\n00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,310\naround the things that the business\nfeels are gonna be vital.\n\n43\n00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,430\nBring security in and\n\n44\n00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,040\nmake sure we address the needs of security\nalong with the needs of the business.\n\n45\n00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,450\nAnd so this really becomes\nkind of the almost golden rule\n\n46\n00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,550\nof information security.\n\n47\n00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,810\nHow do we as practitioners, figure out how\nto bring security into the discussion with\n\n48\n00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,420\nthe business and integrate it\ninto every level of things we do?\n\n49\n00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,970\nBut at the same time make sure\nthat we're not either over or\n\n50\n00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,210\nunder performing in relation to adding\nsecurity to systems, making it more or\n\n51\n00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,340\nless, at the end of the day,\nsecure as a part of the process.\n\n52\n00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,640\nAnd so as a result, what we want to do is\ncome up with a plan that steps through or\n\n53\n00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,450\nliterally lays out steps for us around\nthe ways in which we can identify and then\n\n54\n00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,470\nclearly execute on security in each case\nof typically a roll-out or a system build.\n\n55\n00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,650\nAnd so let's talk about these phases and\nwhat they are.\n\n56\n00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,520\nThere are eight of them in a typical\nsystem development life-cycle.\n\n57\n00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,320\nAnd by the way, we refer to\nthe system development life-cycle or\n\n58\n00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,510\nperhaps just the system\nlife cycle interchangeably.\n\n59\n00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,610\nEither what's called an SLC or an SDLC,\nsystem development life-cycle.\n\n60\n00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,210\nAnd in relation to understanding acronyms\nwhich we hadn't really talked about\n\n61\n00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,050\nper se, but probably just a quick\nside note about acronyms in general,\n\n62\n00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,600\nunderstanding acronyms is\npart of understanding IT.\n\n63\n00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,195\nEverything we do in IT is an acronym or\nat least it seems that way anyway.\n\n64\n00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:48,065\nAnd I often thought my dream job would\nbe early on as I started a career in\n\n65\n00:03:48,065 --> 00:03:51,705\ninformation security, being in charge of\nthe acronym department in a business.\n\n66\n00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:54,955\nRight and so this idea would be that\nI would be the director the the TLA,\n\n67\n00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,755\nthe three letter acronym department, and\n\n68\n00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:59,185\nI would be able to come up\nwith these crazy acronyms.\n\n69\n00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:03,245\nAnd I never found that job, but I have\nalways wondered where acronyms come from.\n\n70\n00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:06,440\nAnd that's a discussion for another time,\nperhaps we could delve into that in\n\n71\n00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,620\na future episode, but for now-\n>> I think that you pigeon holed yourself\n\n72\n00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,674\nby only going three letters,\n>> I did.\n\n73\n00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:11,244\nI did.\n>> Cuz there are so\n\n74\n00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:12,410\nmany great four letter acronyms.\n\n75\n00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,060\n>> There are.\n[LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,850\nSTLC is a good example of that right?\n\n77\n00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,940\nAnd we can come up with others I'm sure,\nbut\n\n78\n00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,210\nthe idea is more specifically that what I\nwe wanna, what I want you to think about\n\n79\n00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,680\nI should say is, acronyms are important,\nand we often struggle to define them, and\n\n80\n00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,310\nwe often use them in today's world,\nespecially, right?\n\n81\n00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,000\nWe're used to speaking in short bursts,\nwhether it's Twittering things, or\n\n82\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,740\nperhaps just texting,\nor whatever it may be.\n\n83\n00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,180\nToday, we're very used to this idea\nof very short speak, as I call it.\n\n84\n00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,070\nBut the reality is, acronyms play an\nimportant role in everything we do in IT,\n\n85\n00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,040\nand specifically IT security.\n\n86\n00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,240\nI want you to be aware of them, we try\nto define them for you as we use them.\n\n87\n00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,670\nWherever and whenever possible.\n\n88\n00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,420\nBut at the same time, I don't want you to\nstruggle with having to remember every\n\n89\n00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,940\nacronym that we talk about.\n\n90\n00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,770\nWe give you the definition or\nthe spelled out name of them for a reason.\n\n91\n00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,970\nBut at the end day for you as you're\npreparing not only potentially to go\n\n92\n00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,790\nthrough this exam, but\nany exam you focus on.\n\n93\n00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,470\nYou'll come to understand that those\nacronyms tend to be spelled out when\n\n94\n00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,110\nyou're asked about them, and so I wouldn't\nspend a lot of time memorizing them, but\n\n95\n00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,800\nI would understand the concepts around\nthem just to be familiar with them and\n\n96\n00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,180\nunderstand what they mean.\n\n97\n00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,150\nHaving said that let's talk\nabout the eight areas or\n\n98\n00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,950\neight phases of the system\ndevelopment life cycle.\n\n99\n00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,780\nWe have project initiation and planning.\n\n100\n00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,850\nAnd you could see them on\nthe screen in front of you,\n\n101\n00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,010\nproject initiation and planning.\n\n102\n00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,970\nI'll run through all of them quickly and\nthen let's talk about each one and\n\n103\n00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,530\njust talk about what they are.\n\n104\n00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,980\nWe have functional requirements\ndefinitions, we have system design\n\n105\n00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,880\nspecification, just moving down our\nnumbered list there, build and document,\n\n106\n00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,790\nacceptance testing, Implementation,\noperation and maintenance support,\n\n107\n00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,860\nand of course, finally, no good system and\nno good system development life cycle\n\n108\n00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,390\nwould be good or ultimately considered\nsuccessful without disposal.\n\n109\n00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,090\nIf we give something life, at the end\nof the day we have to figure out how to\n\n110\n00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,220\ndeal with it when it's\nno longer useful to us.\n\n111\n00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,990\nAnd so, let's go back up to the top and\n\n112\n00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,260\ntalk about project initiation and\nplanning for just a minute.\n\n113\n00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,220\nThis idea of beginning at a starting point\nis critical to any project we engage in.\n\n114\n00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,820\nWhat most studies show when we\ntalk about project management and\n\n115\n00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,110\nproject life-cycle, and\nultimately project success or\n\n116\n00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,360\nfailure, is that we often fail\nbecause we don't know we're starting.\n\n117\n00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,840\nAnd as crazy as that is to say, what the\nstudies actually show us is that cuz we\n\n118\n00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,860\ndon't have a well-defined starting point,\nwe often struggle to figure out how to\n\n119\n00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,050\nexecute through the project but\nalso understand what success equals.\n\n120\n00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,850\nAnd so this is the most important place\nthat we focus on, because it's right here\n\n121\n00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,870\nin the beginning that will ultimately help\nus to understand whether we succeed or\n\n122\n00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,600\nfail, in the long term,\nthrough the entire project.\n\n123\n00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,270\nAnd so project initiation and\nplanning, involves skills and\n\n124\n00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,050\nexecuting on ideas such as getting\nour business objective defined.\n\n125\n00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,430\nUnderstanding what they are,\nlining up our stakeholders.\n\n126\n00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,200\nMaking sure we understand,\nwhat the end result is gonna be, and\n\n127\n00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,560\ndefining those metrics that will\ncreate success in those goals,\n\n128\n00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,480\nto understand how to measure\nourselves throughout the project.\n\n129\n00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,480\nAnd the key word here is planning,\nat the end of this life-cycle.\n\n130\n00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,450\nOr rather, excuse me, at the end of\nthis particular phase of the life-cycle.\n\n131\n00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,450\nIf we don't plan successfully, we will\nnever execute the project successfully.\n\n132\n00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,450\nAnd those same kind of studies\nthat I was referring to\n\n133\n00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,560\ntend to show that almost 80 to 90%\nof the work done in most projects,\n\n134\n00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,150\nis done up front in the initiation and\nplanning stages, believe it or not.\n\n135\n00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,200\nIn other words, most of the heavy lifting,\n\n136\n00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,400\nmost of the work that needs to be\ndone to successfully draw you out and\n\n137\n00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,040\nunderstand how to define success,\nis done in this phase.\n\n138\n00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,770\nThis is one of the most important\nphases that we ultimately fix.\n\n139\n00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,370\n>> I find this is one of the phases that\nis the most challenging for small and\n\n140\n00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,510\nmedium businesses.\n\n141\n00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,070\nIn large organizations, you usually\nhave a well-defined structure for\n\n142\n00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,070\ninitiating a new project and\nmoving forward.\n\n143\n00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,337\nBut in a small business, projects can kick\noff after just a quick brief meeting,\n\n144\n00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:56,925\na conversation in a hallway.\n\n145\n00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:01,133\nAnd it's like you said, you don't even\nnecessarily realize a project is starting,\n\n146\n00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:04,296\nbut you've just been tasked with\na change to the organization.\n\n147\n00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:08,128\nIt is a project, and if you don't have\nthat stuff well-defined in the beginning,\n\n148\n00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:10,044\nyou end up with things\nlike scope creep and\n\n149\n00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:14,430\nall those other terms that we absolutely\nhate in the project management world.\n\n150\n00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,210\n>> Absolutely correct.\n\n151\n00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,860\nAnd so it is really good of\nus to think about that and\n\n152\n00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,410\nhelp you to understand that.\n\n153\n00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,510\nAnd maybe a good resource in this area\nwould be that we wanna think about\n\n154\n00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,510\na traditional project management model.\n\n155\n00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,670\nAnd so PMP comes to mind,\nProject Management Professional.\n\n156\n00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,276\nAnd specifically the PMI organization\nthat internationally drives project\n\n157\n00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:35,215\nmanagement as the standard\nthrough what's called the PMBOK,\n\n158\n00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,740\nor the Project Management\nBody Of Knowledge.\n\n159\n00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,790\nAnd so looking at their website would be\na good resource for you, in general for\n\n160\n00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,030\nthis entire discussion, but\n\n161\n00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,580\nspecifically around things like\nproject initiation and planning.\n\n162\n00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,040\nSo the project management institute\nis what we're talking about here, and\n\n163\n00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,060\nI believe the URL is www.pmi.org,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n164\n00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,720\nSo going out and taking a look at that,\nunderstanding a little bit more about\n\n165\n00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,685\nthe phases of project management, and\npotentially maybe even ultimately deciding\n\n166\n00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:05,420\nthat PMP may be a certification that\nyou may be interested in at some point.\n\n167\n00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,440\nAs an add-on to your\ninformation security career,\n\n168\n00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,960\nwould be a very good lateral move for\nyou from a career perspective.\n\n169\n00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,700\nA lot of various succesful\nsecurity practitioners\n\n170\n00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,160\nare certified in things\nlike project management.\n\n171\n00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,600\nWe mentioned ITIL or\nITIL in previous episodes and\n\n172\n00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,820\ngetting succesful in terms of\nunderstanding frameworks, like ITIL and\n\n173\n00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,300\nCOBIT and some of these others, is also\na good next step for you in your career.\n\n174\n00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,830\nSo, information or information\ntechnology infrastructure library, or\n\n175\n00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,210\nwhat we just generically call IT,\ninfrastructure library.\n\n176\n00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,220\nI believe infrastructure is with an n.\n\n177\n00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I'm not mistaken.\n\n178\n00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,530\nIfrastructure library is close enough.\n\n179\n00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,650\nBut ITIL is also a place where you might\nwanna spend some time as a follow on here,\n\n180\n00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:51,960\nand both of these areas are gonna be very,\nvery complimentary, and you could see\n\n181\n00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,850\nthe URLs for both PMI and ITIL down on the\nbottom of our list here as we're talking.\n\n182\n00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,640\nThey're both very complimentary\nto this discussion,\n\n183\n00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,420\nbecause they both focus on areas of not\njust project management overall, but\n\n184\n00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,610\nthings like change management as\na result of project management\n\n185\n00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,240\nthat become very important to\nthe overall success of the project.\n\n186\n00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,110\nSo, just some thoughts there.\n\n187\n00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,900\nSo now that we've gone through and\ntalked about project initiation, and\n\n188\n00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,400\nplanning a little bit, let's move\nto our next phase of the LifeCycle,\n\n189\n00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,225\nphase number two, where we're talking\nabout functional requirements definition,\n\n190\n00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:25,250\nor what we call functional recs,\ngenerically.\n\n191\n00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,550\nThis idea of gathering requirements\nis gonna be very important,\n\n192\n00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,070\nbecause the requirements are the things\nthat basically detail for\n\n193\n00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,750\nus what our accomplishments need to\nbe in order to build the system.\n\n194\n00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,030\nIn this case, we're talking about building\na system to spec, as we refer to it.\n\n195\n00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,730\nAnd building to spec means we have to\ncapture the needs or the requirements,\n\n196\n00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,370\nyou can use those terms interchangeably,\nof the stakeholders in our system.\n\n197\n00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,460\nWhat is it that they want us to do,\nand as a result of that,\n\n198\n00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,880\nwe then have a better understanding of how\nultimately to be able to create success.\n\n199\n00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,290\nSo if I gave you a list of five things\nthat I wanted to accomplish, and\n\n200\n00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,510\nwe then created a plan to\nexecute on those five things,\n\n201\n00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,570\nthe functional requirements would be\nthe things that specifically I said this\n\n202\n00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,050\nparticular project must enable me to do,\nwhen we're successful or when we're done.\n\n203\n00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,780\nSo defining those can be\na challenge sometimes,\n\n204\n00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,740\nbecause there are different\ncompetitive interests and\n\n205\n00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,510\nconcerns, different audiences in\nother words, that we often speak to.\n\n206\n00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,680\nAnd getting those straight and\n\n207\n00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,320\nunderstanding who ultimately sets the tone\nand the agenda, the goals in other words\n\n208\n00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,150\nthat we are striving for,\ncan be challenging sometimes.\n\n209\n00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,149\nIn competitive groups where we\nhave different interests speaking,\n\n210\n00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,195\nwe may not always realize who it is\nwe have to address, and as a result,\n\n211\n00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:35,918\nwhose requirements are prioritized.\n\n212\n00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:38,213\nSo these just some of\nthe challenges to consider here.\n\n213\n00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:39,800\n>> Yeah, and this, in my opinion,\n\n214\n00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,605\nis probably the most important of all\nthe phases because when you define exactly\n\n215\n00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:47,190\nwhat work needs to be done for a project,\nit gives you two things, right?\n\n216\n00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,290\nFirst off, it gives you control\nover the scope of the project,\n\n217\n00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,930\nthat projects have a tendency to grow,\nif you let them.\n\n218\n00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,780\nYou start tacking on more and more\nactivities, and it changes the project and\n\n219\n00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,780\nit increases your odds of failure.\n\n220\n00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,760\nSo, being able to lock that down and say,\nhere's what I'm setting out to achieve,\n\n221\n00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,950\nI'm not gonna add to this.\n\n222\n00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,740\nAnything additional will need to\nbe either a separate project or\n\n223\n00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,900\ngo through a stringent approval process.\n\n224\n00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,220\nIt gives you that control.\n\n225\n00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,760\nThe second thing is,\nit gives you a check list for success.\n\n226\n00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,250\nHey, how do you know when you're done?\n\n227\n00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,440\nWell, you've got a check list, right?\n\n228\n00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,170\nHere's your requirements.\n\n229\n00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,400\nWhen you meet all these requirements,\nyou're done,\n\n230\n00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,160\nand it was a successful project.\n\n231\n00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,030\nIf you missed any one of those\nrequirements, you've failed and\n\n232\n00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,190\nit's not a successful project.\n\n233\n00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,400\nSo it's a very black and\nwhite litmus test of whether or\n\n234\n00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,650\nnot your project is successful.\n\n235\n00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,260\n>> Very true.\n\n236\n00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,064\nVery true.\nAnd most projects stand or\n\n237\n00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:37,152\nfail at the end of the day, based on not\nonly the planning phases we talked about,\n\n238\n00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:41,082\nbut that really directly leads to this\nfunctional requirement definition.\n\n239\n00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:44,788\nAnd if you don't get this part successful\nas a block, you're going to wind up with\n\n240\n00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:48,656\na project that's ill-defined, and really\nno way to understand whether you have hit\n\n241\n00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:51,206\nthe mark, whether you actually\nare successful or not.\n\n242\n00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:54,490\nOr at least, it's gonna be very difficult\nto discern what success equals,\n\n243\n00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,040\nlet's put it that way.\n\n244\n00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,120\nMoving to our next phase,\nwe talk about system design specification.\n\n245\n00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,090\nThis is where we distill down\nthe functional requirements, and\n\n246\n00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,020\nthen begin to understand how to\nactually create the design, not build.\n\n247\n00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,590\nWe're gonna get to build in the next\nphase, but draft the design.\n\n248\n00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,460\nThink of this as almost like\nthe architectural blueprinting,\n\n249\n00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,600\nwhere we create the design documentation\nthat ultimately leads us to be able to\n\n250\n00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,740\nbuild whatever the system is that we will\ntake on and ultimately try to create.\n\n251\n00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,310\nSo this is an important phase because\nthis takes the strategic thought\n\n252\n00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,550\nprocess that we engage in in planning and\nthe tactical definition of that strategic\n\n253\n00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,500\nprocess in functional\nrequirement definition, and\n\n254\n00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,400\nstarts to distill it down to\nsomething more tangible for us.\n\n255\n00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,160\nWe will typically come out with a logical,\nas well as a physical design document,\n\n256\n00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,330\nor set of documents here,\nmaybe even a technical design, so\n\n257\n00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,390\nwe may have three different\ndesign documents based on phase.\n\n258\n00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,990\nAnd those design documents then represent\nthe specifications of the project\n\n259\n00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,400\nthat will be given to one or more of\nthe areas that we'll execute on build, and\n\n260\n00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,690\nultimately, the documentation\naround build in the next phase.\n\n261\n00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,970\nAnd so when we talk about logical,\npotentially technical, and\n\n262\n00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,660\ncertainly physical design documentation,\nwe're talking about designing\n\n263\n00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,290\naspects of the system that will\nrepresent different functional elements.\n\n264\n00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,293\nOverlaying those together,\ngives us a complete picture.\n\n265\n00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:19,042\nA logical design solution\nwould be very high-level,\n\n266\n00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:23,044\nalmost like the 50,000\nfoot cloud-based vision.\n\n267\n00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:24,036\nThere's that marketing term again, right?\n\n268\n00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:24,874\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n269\n00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:28,290\na very high-level vision of\nwhat the system would be.\n\n270\n00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,670\nSo if we're talking, let's say\njust theoretically as an example,\n\n271\n00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,700\nabout perhaps building a messaging system.\n\n272\n00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,190\nAnd regardless of vendor, we wanna have\nthe ability to send and receive email, and\n\n273\n00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,250\nwe want the ability to be able to\nperhaps do some video conferencing.\n\n274\n00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,490\nInteractive collaboration.\n\n275\n00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,670\nIn the system, the logical design\nsolution would really just show us very,\n\n276\n00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,390\nvery basic concepts of, we need at least\ntwo or three computers, we need some\n\n277\n00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,320\nnetwork connectivity between them, and\neach of these systems will be a Wintel\n\n278\n00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,850\nsystem, let's just say hypothetically, or\na Linux, it doesn't really matter which.\n\n279\n00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,230\nBut we're not gonna specify\nout beyond that, anything.\n\n280\n00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,960\nAnd just that design, literally,\nwould be a couple of boxes,\n\n281\n00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,080\nthree of them let's just say each\nrectangle representing a computer\n\n282\n00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,300\nthat may be labeled with a function.\n\n283\n00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,440\nMail server, perhaps firewall,\nand then [COUGH] on the far side,\n\n284\n00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,530\nwe would have a client machine that\nis gonna be able to send and receive.\n\n285\n00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,205\nWe'd have a pipe of some kind\nlinking the three together and\n\n286\n00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:30,735\nshowing some sort of bandwidth, and we\nwould have a cloud representing typically\n\n287\n00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:35,405\nnetwork connectivity, meaning from WAN\nto LAN, LAN to WAN, that kinda thing.\n\n288\n00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:38,886\nThat would roughly, at a high-level,\nbe what a logical design solution may look\n\n289\n00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:41,669\nlike, and there may be a definition\nof bandwidth there, right?\n\n290\n00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:44,778\nWe have a T1 or something like that or\nwhatever that may be.\n\n291\n00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:50,357\nA technical design document would actually\nlook at the details associated with\n\n292\n00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:56,101\nwhat the overlay, the application layer\nand the overlay of that would look like,\n\n293\n00:15:56,101 --> 00:16:00,513\nand it would detail out for\nus the fact that maybe we are choosing\n\n294\n00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:04,925\na software platform and a vendor And\nwhat that would look like,\n\n295\n00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:09,670\nit will lay out for us,\nthe specifics of that particular solution,\n\n296\n00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,663\nwhat service pack level, what software\nbuild level are we looking at,\n\n297\n00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:19,906\nthose kinds of things would be defined\nthere, as well as the specification\n\n298\n00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:25,620\naround being able to send and receive\nemail using this kind of client interface.\n\n299\n00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,827\nOver this kind of distance for this\nkind of time, things of that nature, and\n\n300\n00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:34,140\nthen a physical design would look at\nthe actual layout of that network.\n\n301\n00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,120\nIt would detail out the switches,\nthe routers, things of that nature.\n\n302\n00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,650\nWe could see that all rolled up\nunder a technical design document.\n\n303\n00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,120\nIt really just depends on who's\ndriving that design solution and\n\n304\n00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,710\nhow detailed they wanna be\naround each of these areas.\n\n305\n00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,010\nBut at a minimum we need\na logical design and\n\n306\n00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,250\nsome sort of technical design solution\nthat differentiates for us, right, and\n\n307\n00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,460\ngets more detail,\nbasically is what we're looking at there.\n\n308\n00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,492\nSo, these are typically the kinds\nof documents we would see coming\n\n309\n00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:04,447\ntogether under system design specification\nas a phase, and being offered to the build\n\n310\n00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:08,230\nteam that will take them on as\nthe next phase of the design solution.\n\n311\n00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,710\n>> Yeah, and these are rarely documents\nthat we just sit down and write and\n\n312\n00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,220\nwe're done.\n\n313\n00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,760\nThey usually have to go through a couple\nof iterations, and they're kind of living\n\n314\n00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,810\ndocuments for a little while as we craft\nexactly what we need, because you might,\n\n315\n00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:24,175\nyou start off with that logical design\nbecause that's the logical place to start.\n\n316\n00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:28,435\nAnd then, from there, you come up with\nyour technical and your physical design,\n\n317\n00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:33,235\nand as you start designing those, you\nfind additional quirks or considerations,\n\n318\n00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:36,725\nand you have to go back and revisit the\nothers, so it may take several iterations\n\n319\n00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:41,205\nbefore you get that final design that\nsuits all the needs of your project.\n\n320\n00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:44,660\n>> Absolutely, and we referenced project\nmanagement a little bit earlier,\n\n321\n00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,580\nin project management speak\nwe call these artifacts,\n\n322\n00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,918\nthese are elements of the project overall.\n\n323\n00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:52,950\nThey're just referred to as artifacts\nmeaning things that are included in\n\n324\n00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,140\nthe overall project plan\ndocumentation container,\n\n325\n00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,170\nwhatever that is, wherever you store that.\n\n326\n00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,320\nAnd ultimately over time\nare archived with the project.\n\n327\n00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,450\nSo that we could go back and\nlook at it and say,\n\n328\n00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,520\nwe built it this way, we may be rolling\nthis project out, doing a revision on it.\n\n329\n00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,790\nMaybe it's part two, or\na feature update, or whatever it may be.\n\n330\n00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,510\nAnd we wanna capture these designs\nonce we, more or less, stabilize them,\n\n331\n00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,390\nas Don was indicating,\ncuz they are dynamic for a period of time,\n\n332\n00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,520\nbut some point we have to lock them\ndown and create a static vision\n\n333\n00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,050\nof what that design will look like,\nat least for this phase of the build.\n\n334\n00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,250\nAnd then we can come back and\niterate through it again, open that up for\n\n335\n00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,330\ndiscussion, maybe add features, right.\n\n336\n00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,790\nThis is how software companies will\niterate through their projects so\n\n337\n00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,870\nthey will release version one and\nthen ultimately version two and\n\n338\n00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,210\nversion three and so on.\n\n339\n00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,920\nAnd every time they go back to\nthe basic concepts of design,\n\n340\n00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,600\nand walk through the same exact steps\n\n341\n00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,390\nusing the documentation from the prior\nbuilds as a starting point, and\n\n342\n00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,690\nthen they build on those templates\nliterally, to update them over time.\n\n343\n00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,720\nSo, wanna just get your familiar with the\nlanguage as well as the thought process\n\n344\n00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,560\naround managing through this.\n\n345\n00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,550\nWe move into build and\ndocument as our phase.\n\n346\n00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,370\nThis is gonna be phase four.\n\n347\n00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,120\nRoughly half way through, the thought\nprocess around how we design a system, and\n\n348\n00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,450\nthen building document,\n\n349\n00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,600\nwe are actually taking those design\nelements that we've created and\n\n350\n00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,980\ndrafted in the prior step, and we\nare now going to put something together.\n\n351\n00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,880\nPhysically create a proof\nof concept certainly, so\n\n352\n00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,620\nwe have something we can look at and\ndo some testing with.\n\n353\n00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,980\nWe're also going to do ultimately a build\nthat will help us to put something into\n\n354\n00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,110\nproduction here.\n\n355\n00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,500\nWe may build some prototypes along\nthe way, revise some things,\n\n356\n00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,840\nmake sure that we actually have them.\n\n357\n00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,750\nYou hear these terms often, so\neither a proof of concept, a prototype.\n\n358\n00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,650\nAnd at some point we would use some,\nprobably,\n\n359\n00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,180\nbeta testing which will\ncome up in the next phase.\n\n360\n00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,000\nAcceptance testing, we'll look at making\nsure things run the right way, but\n\n361\n00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,470\nwe may do some beta testing and\nsome preliminary field testing\n\n362\n00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,350\nprior to going into acceptance testing or\nmay just roll that into that phase.\n\n363\n00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,460\nIt really depends on how we manage that.\n\n364\n00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,080\nBut in building document,\n\n365\n00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,850\nwe are going to come out the far end of\nthis particular part of the life cycle and\n\n366\n00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,210\nthis phase, with something tangible,\nsomething physical.\n\n367\n00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,380\nOr if it's a system,\nthe component parts, whatever that is.\n\n368\n00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,270\nThat we can then hand off\nto acceptance testing,\n\n369\n00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,070\nthat will then be able to ultimately be\nused to drive something into production,\n\n370\n00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,110\nas we go into implementation,\nfew phases down.\n\n371\n00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,910\nThat's where we put something out,\nand actually turn it on, if you will,\n\n372\n00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,270\nand create a live solution.\n\n373\n00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,370\nAs we move into acceptance testing,\nwe're going to, as we just discussed,\n\n374\n00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,250\nsee things here where we put out\na workable product that will be given to\n\n375\n00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,835\ntypically a smaller group of people,\nso we may have power users.\n\n376\n00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:35,515\nOr we may have a beta test of some kind,\n\n377\n00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:38,735\nthat will go on with an initial\ngroup that are gonna kind of work\n\n378\n00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:42,885\nthrough that with us before we put it\ninto implementation and turn it on.\n\n379\n00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,862\nSo this is initial sampling,\ninitial testing.\n\n380\n00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:48,322\nAnd once we get the feedback from this,\n\n381\n00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:50,932\ntypically if we've done our\njob in the prior steps,\n\n382\n00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:54,792\nthere may be minor adjustments, but\ntypically nothing too substantial.\n\n383\n00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:57,382\nIf we get it wrong up front,\nthis is typically where we find out,\n\n384\n00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:00,592\nmore often than not that we may be\noff track and we have to go back and\n\n385\n00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,312\nobviously then rework that.\n\n386\n00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:06,470\nSo acceptance testing is where we're\ngonna finalize the build, in effect.\n\n387\n00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,570\nAnd as a result of that,\nagree, the businesses agreeing\n\n388\n00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,500\nto accept the liability of running this\nsolution, whatever it is, and they\n\n389\n00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,120\nare then going to ultimately vote to turn\nit on, hopefully, if it is built properly.\n\n390\n00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,280\nWe do have situations where we decide not\nto turn it on, and we go through this\n\n391\n00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,490\nwhole process only to stop at that\npoint and say we no longer want it.\n\n392\n00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,720\nRare though that may be, it does happen.\n\n393\n00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,240\nThings change, and some of these\ncycles can take several years, and\n\n394\n00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,850\nas a result by the time\nthe product comes to fruition, or\n\n395\n00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,920\nthe system is built to the point\nwhere we can do acceptance testing,\n\n396\n00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,480\nthe needs of the business may\nhave shift and moved past that.\n\n397\n00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,900\nAnd as a result we may actually no longer\nhave a system that strategically aligns to\n\n398\n00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,100\nwhere we want to be, and so\nthis is important right.\n\n399\n00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,400\nAnd so this speaks to, I don't know if you\nwere just gonna throw something out there\n\n400\n00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,310\nbut let me quickly-\n>> Sure.\n\n401\n00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,100\n>> Finish this thought which is,\nthis speaks to the idea of different\n\n402\n00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,460\ndevelopment models around how\nwe go through life-cycles.\n\n403\n00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,985\nWe're not gonna get into all of\nthe nuts and bolts of that, but\n\n404\n00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:01,950\nyou're throwing out some ideas around that\nquickly just as a point of reference.\n\n405\n00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,560\nWe have things like JIT which is\njust-in-time as a methodology.\n\n406\n00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:12,110\nWe have CMMI, which is the capability\nmaturity model, we have Waterfall, we\n\n407\n00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,285\nhave Agile Scrum, these are all different\ncape, these are all different models.\n\n408\n00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:21,050\n[LAUGH] I was watching capability go\nup on the screen while I was talking.\n\n409\n00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,030\nAgile and Agile Scrum, it's usually\na reference that goes together.\n\n410\n00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,651\nAnd so this idea of just\nthese capability models, or\n\n411\n00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:32,823\nthese different models that allow us to\nunderstand how to do development work, and\n\n412\n00:22:32,823 --> 00:22:36,280\nto do life-cycle management work,\nare important as references for\n\n413\n00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,580\nyou because they're just another\nway to approach this process.\n\n414\n00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,040\nAnd there's no right or\nwrong way, by the way to do this.\n\n415\n00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,457\nThese are just accepted models\nin the industry today, and\n\n416\n00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:49,874\nin many cases,\ninformation security can work with any and\n\n417\n00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:52,734\nall of these models by\ninjecting common sense and\n\n418\n00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:57,687\npreparedness into that life-cycle at each\nphase, to really then help the business\n\n419\n00:22:57,687 --> 00:23:02,041\nrealize its goals in the most equivalent\nor most equitable way possible.\n\n420\n00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,337\nWhich is to make sure that\nwe are developing, but\n\n421\n00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:06,900\ndeveloping securely as we build systems.\n\n422\n00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,710\nSo this is very important.\n\n423\n00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,490\nSo we have the acceptance testing.\n\n424\n00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,380\nIf we move down into implementation,\nour fifth, excuse me our sixth phase,\n\n425\n00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,070\nimplementation is gonna be where\nbasically we turn things on.\n\n426\n00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,040\nWe put it out into production,\nthat's what we often call it.\n\n427\n00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,750\nJust going live or turning it on or\ngoing into production.\n\n428\n00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,120\nAnd the idea of implementation is where we\nactually will then take this system and\n\n429\n00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,470\neffectively give it to users to use.\n\n430\n00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,010\nAnd so\nthis is an exciting time in the business.\n\n431\n00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,870\nThings are happening, people are getting\nexcited about the implementation of\n\n432\n00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,210\nthe system, at least if we've done our\njob the right way, hopefully they will.\n\n433\n00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,380\nAnd then we move into operation and\nmaintenance support,\n\n434\n00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,176\nthis is where a system is\nnow managed day-to-day.\n\n435\n00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,946\nSo the day-to-day running of that system,\nthe day-to-day support of users working\n\n436\n00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:57,207\nwith that system is taken on, and is then\ngoing to be executed by the business.\n\n437\n00:23:57,207 --> 00:24:01,677\nAnd, then ultimately disposal is\nthe last stop on our phase here, or\n\n438\n00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:03,616\nthe last of our eight phases.\n\n439\n00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:07,539\nAnd when we talk about disposal,\nwe're talking about end of life in effect.\n\n440\n00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:11,624\nAnd so, disposal is really where we look\nat a system that whether it's because we\n\n441\n00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:14,760\nhave a new release coming up,\na new iteration of that system.\n\n442\n00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,830\nOr just the system's been in\nproduction for so long, that for\n\n443\n00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,310\nwhatever reason we no longer\nsee it as being lined, and\n\n444\n00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,500\ntherefore able for\nus to be able to use effectively.\n\n445\n00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,960\nWe are planning for the disposal or\ndestruction of that system, but\n\n446\n00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,500\nnot just to rip and replace,\nas we often sometimes hear in IT.\n\n447\n00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,520\nBut rather to have a plan that is executed\nto bring that system down at a controlled\n\n448\n00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,450\nway, that allows us to, in effect, sundown\nit, which is the term we often use.\n\n449\n00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,430\nAnd bring something in in it's place that\nwill then take over that functionality and\n\n450\n00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,710\nadd to it typically, or\nretire that functionality in favor of\n\n451\n00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,470\nsomething different, but\ndo so in a controlled way.\n\n452\n00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,920\nAnd the key there is communication,\nboth with the end users and\n\n453\n00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,400\nwith the overall support\nimplementation team at large.\n\n454\n00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,590\nThat understands what the plan is\nas we go out of this system and\n\n455\n00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,030\nperhaps bring on a new one in some\nrespect, whatever that may be.\n\n456\n00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,730\nSo, taken as a block, the basic phases\nof the system design lifecycle,\n\n457\n00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,610\nthe eight phases that we've talked about.\n\n458\n00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,530\nVery important for\nyou as a security practitioner and\n\n459\n00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,980\ninformation security professional\nto be able to understand,\n\n460\n00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,510\nyou want to have a working\nknowledge of each of these phases.\n\n461\n00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,150\nYou don't need to have the ability\nto execute on every one of them.\n\n462\n00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,240\nThis is a team effort, so in other words,\n\n463\n00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,830\nby yourself you are not expected to go\nout and build a system start to finish.\n\n464\n00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,940\nThis is often done with teams of\nindividuals that specialize in one or\n\n465\n00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,300\nmore of these areas.\n\n466\n00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,380\nAnd so, this really is a mission\nthat everybody has to pull together\n\n467\n00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,900\nin order to be able to execute.\n\n468\n00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,340\nBut the idea here is that we wanna\nunderstand that we have to insert and\n\n469\n00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,700\ninject the security thought\nprocess into each of these phases.\n\n470\n00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,770\nThis is where it really becomes very\nimportant to make sure that we understand\n\n471\n00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,170\nsecurity has a voice and a seat at\nthe table around this entire project plan.\n\n472\n00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,750\nAnd should be integrated at\nevery level of the design,\n\n473\n00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,624\nthat's really the most\nimportant thought process.\n\n474\n00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,310\n>> And one of the most important\nplaces that we can get\n\n475\n00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,680\ninvolved successfully with security\nis early on in the project, right?\n\n476\n00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,580\nBecause there are, I've had this and\nI'm sure you've encountered it Adam, where\n\n477\n00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,210\nan organization that I work for decided\nto purchase some software products.\n\n478\n00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,480\nSo they wanted to roll\nout this new solution,\n\n479\n00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,900\nwithout actually researching\nthe software product itself.\n\n480\n00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,980\nTo see whether it had been\nthrough any security testing,\n\n481\n00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,820\nhad there been any code review,\nanything like that.\n\n482\n00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,780\nAnd if they purchased an inherently\nnon-secure software package,\n\n483\n00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,090\nyou can't roll that out in production.\n\n484\n00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:41,000\nAnd that can easily be detected in\nthe very early stages when you're doing\n\n485\n00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,210\nthe design specifications.\n\n486\n00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,660\nWhen you're doing that build document,\n\n487\n00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,670\nwhen you're looking at\nthat initial software.\n\n488\n00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,820\nAnd if you can stop it then,\nyou can save your company a lot of time,\n\n489\n00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,070\nand a lot of money, and\nget them moving in the right direction.\n\n490\n00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,810\nIf you don't do your\nsecurity audits until later,\n\n491\n00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,110\nwhen you're in the acceptance testing,\nwhen they're already rolling out the data.\n\n492\n00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,840\nThey've already purchased the software,\nor already coded and deployed, and\n\n493\n00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,638\nyou look at it and you go.\n\n494\n00:27:04,638 --> 00:27:09,580\nThis is closed-source software\nthat hasn't gone through\n\n495\n00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,350\ncode review, by that point you've got\na significant time and money investment.\n\n496\n00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:19,740\nSo, by getting involved early and staying\ninvolved throughout the entire project,\n\n497\n00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,840\nyou can ensure that that doesn't happen.\n\n498\n00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,250\nThat the deployment is secure from\nthe beginning, and that it stays secure\n\n499\n00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,530\nall through operation and maintenance,\nwhich is also very important.\n\n500\n00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,550\nAnd then finally when we get rid of that\ndata, making sure that any of the remnants\n\n501\n00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:39,150\nof our own corporate private information\ndoesn't get dispersed accidentally.\n\n502\n00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,990\n>> Very, very true and\n\n503\n00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,550\nit is often the things we overlook,\nbecause we take them for granted.\n\n504\n00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,500\nThat mean the difference\nbetween success and failure.\n\n505\n00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,530\nAnd not bringing in the voice of\nthe security thought process, and\n\n506\n00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,380\nthe mindset to the table\nearly on in a project.\n\n507\n00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,400\nCan really mean that success\nmay still be acceptable,\n\n508\n00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,670\nwe can still perhaps reach that goal.\n\n509\n00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,930\nBut it becomes a lot more expensive,\nbecause we have to go back often times and\n\n510\n00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,790\nundo a lot of time and effort.\n\n511\n00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:10,060\nIn order to then recreate a security\nsolution that has to be integrated much\n\n512\n00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,620\nfurther along,\nas Don was pointing out on the project.\n\n513\n00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,920\nThen is economically viable typically and\n\n514\n00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,850\nas a result,\noften times we blow our budget.\n\n515\n00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,110\nWhen we really talk about\nproject management,\n\n516\n00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,354\nwe talk about this idea of manipulating\nthree different variables.\n\n517\n00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:26,730\nWe talk about, generically you hear to\nit often referred to as good, fast,\n\n518\n00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,620\ncheap, right?\n\n519\n00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,270\nAnd this idea of being\nable to deliver a solution\n\n520\n00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:37,220\nunder this triangle of variables is really\nthis idea of being able to manipulate.\n\n521\n00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,790\nAnd we'll just refer to it as good, fast,\ncheap for a minute, but the reality is,\n\n522\n00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,880\nwe're talking about resources, right?\n\n523\n00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,800\nAnd so we're talking about,\n\n524\n00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,320\nwhen we say good, we're talking\nabout requirements for features.\n\n525\n00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,820\nWhen we say [COUGH] fast,\nwe're talking about time, and\n\n526\n00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,520\nwhen we say [COUGH] cheap, obviously\nwe're talking about money, right?\n\n527\n00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,380\nAnd so, this idea of good, fast and cheap\nis this idea of how do we manipulate these\n\n528\n00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,080\nvariables that represent the building\nblocks and the components of a project.\n\n529\n00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,850\nIn order to make sure that\nwe deliver on target, and\n\n530\n00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:11,440\nas a result create success based on the\ndefined criteria the requirements that we\n\n531\n00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,960\nhave captured in the first\ncouple of phases.\n\n532\n00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,010\nSo, the old saying,\n\n533\n00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,370\nthe adage in project management goes,\nyou can get two out of three, right?\n\n534\n00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,640\nSo you can have something that's good and\ncheap, but\n\n535\n00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,260\nwe know it's not going to be fast.\n\n536\n00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,680\nAnd if you get something that's fast and\n\n537\n00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,150\ncheap, well, we know that's probably\nnot gonna be real good, right?\n\n538\n00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,700\nAnd so, this idea of being able\nto figure out which of those two\n\n539\n00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,010\nwe're gonna focus on.\n\n540\n00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,785\nAnd as a result, which one we are going\nto effectively negotiate away,\n\n541\n00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:39,930\ncuz we can lock two in place but\nwe then have to negotiate a way.\n\n542\n00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,240\nOne of them in order to do that, we can\nlock one in place and play with two.\n\n543\n00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,940\nBut if we say, no matter what it's gonna\nbe good, meaning the requirements,\n\n544\n00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,560\nthe features are gonna be achieved.\n\n545\n00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,380\nWhat that often means is that it's\nprobably gonna cost us more money, and\n\n546\n00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,180\nit is probably gonna take longer\nthan we initially had budgeted for.\n\n547\n00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,130\nAs we think through that, and so\nif we lock one of those requirements, or\n\n548\n00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,800\nexcuse me,\none of those three areas into place.\n\n549\n00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,980\nAnd say, no matter what it's gonna\nbe this, those other two flex.\n\n550\n00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,720\nAnd as we negotiate our way through that,\n\n551\n00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,500\nthis is the role basically of the project\nmanager is to manage these variables.\n\n552\n00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,920\nAnd figure out how to bring\nthe project in, on time, on budget,\n\n553\n00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,360\nand hopefully on spec as a result\nof being able to manipulate those.\n\n554\n00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,910\n>> And with any project, you'll typically\nhave at least one of these defined for\n\n555\n00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,590\nyou as part of the initial\nproject definition.\n\n556\n00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,150\nWhen they say, we've really got to\nget this product rolled out and\n\n557\n00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,236\nwe really need it by our grand opening,\nAugust 1st.\n\n558\n00:30:34,236 --> 00:30:38,988\nOr we've got $50,000,\nthis is what we need to achieve, so\n\n559\n00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:42,810\nthey set that for at least one\nof these in the very beginning.\n\n560\n00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,510\nThere's very few projects\nthat don't have the set,\n\n561\n00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,620\nI like to refer to them\nas government projects.\n\n562\n00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,130\nAnd so, they usually have less,\nless boundaries around them.\n\n563\n00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:57,330\nBut in the private sector, normally these\nare defined outside of our control,\n\n564\n00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,580\nand then we just have\nto operate within them.\n\n565\n00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,710\n>> Very true, and so think about as\nwe kinda wrap up this discussion and\n\n566\n00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,110\nthis thought process.\n\n567\n00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,490\nThink about it in your\norganizations wherever you are,\n\n568\n00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,864\nwhatever you engage in\nin terms of activities.\n\n569\n00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:12,870\nThink about where this life cycle model,\nthis development model may apply to you.\n\n570\n00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,620\nYou may not be executing on it everyday,\ncertainly,\n\n571\n00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,600\nyou may not even be involved in it today.\n\n572\n00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,090\nBut going out and figuring out where\nit lives in your organizations,\n\n573\n00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,820\ntypically by the way you\nwill find this methodology,\n\n574\n00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,010\nthis thought process, this group or\nthese teams in a PMO.\n\n575\n00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:32,360\nSo if you have a project management\noffice, another project management term\n\n576\n00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,820\nthat we find from project management,\nfrom the PM bar.\n\n577\n00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,580\nIf you find a PMO in your organization\nthat's typically where change\n\n578\n00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,440\nas well as risk is often identified and\nmanaged.\n\n579\n00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,960\nAnd as a result, typically where at least\nthe beginning thought processes around\n\n580\n00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,070\nbuilding this model, and\nthese teams are often managed.\n\n581\n00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,690\nSo it's a good place for you to spend\nsome time and get to know people, and\n\n582\n00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,890\nas a result become more integrated.\n\n583\n00:31:54,890 --> 00:32:00,099\nYou also tend to see this happening\naround software development especially.\n\n584\n00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:02,896\nSo we're talking generally about a system,\nand a system can be anything.\n\n585\n00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:06,635\nBut if you have an in house development\ngroup, a group that does application work.\n\n586\n00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:09,415\nThat builds applications\nin your businesses,\n\n587\n00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:11,850\nthey are using methodologies like this.\n\n588\n00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,130\nThey may not be using that is\njust generic and may have a name,\n\n589\n00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,260\nlike we mentioned,\nsomething like Waterfall, or Scrum, or\n\n590\n00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,410\nAgile Scrum, whatever that\nmethodology is as we mentioned.\n\n591\n00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,090\nAnd if you hear those terms,\n\n592\n00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,120\nthose are key indicators that those\nare the people that are working.\n\n593\n00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,770\nWith these kinds of methodologies.\n\n594\n00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:32,690\nRight, so look for them in your\norganization, look for the software\n\n595\n00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,970\ndevelopment projects, look to the PMO to\nunderstand how these things are done.\n\n596\n00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:42,060\nAnd you know often times if you're willing\nto invest a little time to be an observer,\n\n597\n00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,360\nwhat you often will find is that\npeople are willing to open up\n\n598\n00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,030\ntheir meetings to you and\nallow you to participate.\n\n599\n00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,570\nSo that you can learn more about that,\n\n600\n00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,930\nbecause you become a more valuable\nprofessional to the organization.\n\n601\n00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,570\nIf you take the time to educate yourself,\nand\n\n602\n00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,090\nas a result become a better practitioner.\n\n603\n00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,880\nSo don't be afraid to observe, and\nthen ultimately learn by doing, right and\n\n604\n00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,430\nreally volunteer to become a part\nof one or more of these teams, and\n\n605\n00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,500\nsee what happens and go through a scrum.\n\n606\n00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,200\nIf you will, or go through a cycle\nin waterfall, a development cycle,\n\n607\n00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,700\nwith the team, and ask them to help\nyou to understand what they do.\n\n608\n00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,580\nThat can really be a very valuable set\nof skills that you develop as a result.\n\n609\n00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,750\n>> Absolutely.\n\n610\n00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,580\nAll right, well Adam,\nwe are right up on our break.\n\n611\n00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,500\nSo why don't we stop here for\na minute, and when we get back,\n\n612\n00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,740\nwe've got a lot more to talk about.\n\n613\n00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,860\nWe still have plenty of other stuff in\nour security operations module here.\n\n614\n00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:39,515\nSo stay tuned, and\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n615\n00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:42,681\n[SOUND] All right welcome back everybody.\n\n616\n00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:47,758\nSo in the last segment we got to take\na look at the life cycle of really\n\n617\n00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:52,820\na project or any of a number of\nundertakings in our organization.\n\n618\n00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,320\nAnd what we're going to do now is\nwe're going to build on that and\n\n619\n00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,740\nI think we're ready to start making\nthe jump into change management and\n\n620\n00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,010\na couple other topics, right?\n\n621\n00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,368\n>> Absolutely.\n\n622\n00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:04,640\nWe're going to talk just a little more\nabout bringing security into the security\n\n623\n00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,890\nthought process rather I should say\ninto the development Lifecycle and\n\n624\n00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,020\nthe development thought process, but\nquickly move through that into change, and\n\n625\n00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,680\nhow change management is\ngoing to create success.\n\n626\n00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,360\nAnd what the variables around\nchange are going to be.\n\n627\n00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,420\nSo when we think about security\nduring software development,\n\n628\n00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,260\nwe want to make sure we're\nthinking about this idea of how\n\n629\n00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,850\nwe bring security into\nevery area of the project.\n\n630\n00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,830\nThis really becomes very critical.\n\n631\n00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,910\nAnd looking at the applications that\nare produced if we are doing, let's say,\n\n632\n00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,330\nsoftware development as our project.\n\n633\n00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,580\nThis is typically where users\nare going to run into problems.\n\n634\n00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,440\nThis is where attacks can happen.\n\n635\n00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,410\nSo failure and checking our code,\ndoing QA, looking for\n\n636\n00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,320\nknown issues, testing for\nweaknesses, bad coding practices.\n\n637\n00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,160\nThings like that are all going to lead,\npotentially, to failure.\n\n638\n00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,030\nSo it's a security practitioner's job,\n\n639\n00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,900\nultimately, to bring that voice of reason\nto the table in the middle of the project,\n\n640\n00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,740\nand say, are we doing the right amount of\ntesting, are we looking for these kinds of\n\n641\n00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,030\nweaknesses, and how are we identifying\nthat we have a good versus a bad process?\n\n642\n00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,260\nWhat does that look like?\n\n643\n00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,960\nAre we checking users' authentication\nas users authenticate through\n\n644\n00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,050\nthe application?\n\n645\n00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:15,030\nAre we checking application\nservices that are running,\n\n646\n00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,630\nand calls they're making to\nthe underlying operating system.\n\n647\n00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,700\nAre we looking at things like\nports that are being used?\n\n648\n00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,780\nAre ports being used that are documented,\nare they undocumented ports,\n\n649\n00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,200\nmeaning not well known?\n\n650\n00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,700\nAnd if they're not well known,\nwhy are we using them?\n\n651\n00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,890\nWhat's the value to the organization?\n\n652\n00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,730\nThose kinds of things with\nthings we want to discuss.\n\n653\n00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:39,410\nSo checking and making sure we have buffer\noverflow validation and logic in place.\n\n654\n00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,700\nMaking sure that we understand how to\nstructure data input in such a way\n\n655\n00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,500\nthat we're not able to\ncreate a buffer overflow,\n\n656\n00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,970\nor injection opportunities for somebody\nto come in and mess around with our code.\n\n657\n00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,370\nAre all things that we would think about\nwhen we talk about bringing security to\n\n658\n00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,490\nthe table during software development.\n\n659\n00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,120\nSo want to have that\nthought process in mind,\n\n660\n00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,330\nreally making sure we're\nthinking about that.\n\n661\n00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:04,170\nAlso the integrity of the code\nlibraries themselves.\n\n662\n00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,400\nAre we managing and protecting those DLLs,\n\n663\n00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,410\nthose libraries that are being used and,\nif so, great.\n\n664\n00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,410\nIf not, if we're not using a product.\n\n665\n00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,140\nThat helps us to manage that code, lock\nit down digitally sign it for instance.\n\n666\n00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,740\nUsing certificates to validate the code so\nin the mind of the user,\n\n667\n00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,570\nthey're getting authorized software that\nis legitimate, signed by the vendor.\n\n668\n00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:29,610\nAnd if they're not getting digitally\nsigned software then why not, and\n\n669\n00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,010\nwhy don't we have that\ncapability in place?\n\n670\n00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,590\nWant to ask those questions.\n\n671\n00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:38,680\nIt's often the job of the security\npractitioner of an SSCP and\n\n672\n00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,420\neven a CISP in a more senior role.\n\n673\n00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,970\nPerhaps even somebody who may\nbe a CASP if we're talking about\n\n674\n00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,270\ndifferent kinds of security\ncertifications, whatever they may be.\n\n675\n00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,700\nEven security plus is a beginning\nstarting point for your career.\n\n676\n00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,610\nIt's your opportunity and\n\n677\n00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:57,370\nyour responsibility to raise\nawareness in the organization.\n\n678\n00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:00,590\nNot just around security, but\naround best practices and\n\n679\n00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,720\naround most importantly common sense.\n\n680\n00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,040\nThe only bad question are the ones\nthat don't get asked, and\n\n681\n00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,180\nthat's really the important\nthing to think about.\n\n682\n00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,560\nIf you're looking at something and\nit's not clear in your mind,\n\n683\n00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,990\nsitting at the table proverbially or\nliterally during a conversation, why\n\n684\n00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:21,210\nsomething's being done, it's most likely\nimportant to stop and ask about why.\n\n685\n00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:25,360\nAnd if we can understand the why, we are\nunderstanding what's called root cause.\n\n686\n00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,950\nAnd at the end of the day if\nwe can get to root cause,\n\n687\n00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,090\nwe begin to really get a very quick\npicture of what's going on in the system.\n\n688\n00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,300\nAnd if we can do that we're going to be\nmuch more successful at understanding\n\n689\n00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,220\nwhere the potential liabilities,\nthe security problems may exist.\n\n690\n00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,490\nNow we may identify them and\n\n691\n00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,580\ndecide that ultimately we're not\ngoing to take them on, right?\n\n692\n00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,560\nSo sometimes we flag these things and say\n'you know, fundamentally this is an issue,\n\n693\n00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,360\nbut we can't stop at this point and\nre-architect the entire solution.\n\n694\n00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,550\nWe have a deadline, we have a budget.\n\n695\n00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,110\nWe have a need that we have to fulfill for\n\n696\n00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,470\nthe organization.' whatever\nthose drivers are.\n\n697\n00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,660\nBut we can at least identify that\nwe know this, identify the risk,\n\n698\n00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,630\nin other words, inherent in this\nparticular issue, flag it if you will,\n\n699\n00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,800\nbroadly communicate it,\nand then manage it,\n\n700\n00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,760\nas opposed to simply sticking our head\nin the sand and ignoring it totally.\n\n701\n00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,050\nAnd so this idea of risk management\nas well as change management,\n\n702\n00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,040\nwe'll come back and we'll talk more\nabout this in a few minutes, but\n\n703\n00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,670\nthese ideas of risk and change management\nreally come to the table here,\n\n704\n00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,610\nas we begin to think about how we\nidentify the things that we have as\n\n705\n00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,420\nsecurity practitioners to be aware of and\nto then focus on in a project.\n\n706\n00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,140\nSo asking the right questions, but\n\n707\n00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,750\nmost importantly asking why helps us\nto understand risk and identify change.\n\n708\n00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,430\n>> And you can't necessarily rely on\nother employees to take care of this\n\n709\n00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,000\nfor you, right?\n\n710\n00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,940\nEspecially when it comes to developers.\n\n711\n00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,400\nWhen you have a developer,\n\n712\n00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,230\nthey're usually given a list of features\nthey need to develop and a time frame.\n\n713\n00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,370\nWe need these features by this day and\n\n714\n00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,070\nso that's what their focus is, creating\nthat functionality in the software.\n\n715\n00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,940\nThey're not necessarily thinking\nsecurity first, features second.\n\n716\n00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,230\nThey're thinking features first.\n\n717\n00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,810\nMaybe security second,\nsometimes not security at all.\n\n718\n00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,480\n>> I think it's more like\nMountain Dew second and\n\n719\n00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,660\nmaybe pizza third on that list for\ndevelopers, right?\n\n720\n00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,710\nBut they are, obviously to be serious and\nnot just to kid around, but they\n\n721\n00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:16,350\nare thinking as DOM points our rightly\nabout their product and their building.\n\n722\n00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:20,420\nWhat developers do is build really\ngreat stuff more often than not.\n\n723\n00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,760\nBut they're focused on that.\n\n724\n00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,550\nThey're not focused on security.\n\n725\n00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,290\nNot because they don't want to be, and not\nbecause they don't understand the need for\n\n726\n00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,640\nit, but it's not their specialty.\n\n727\n00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,860\nThat's what you do, right?\n\n728\n00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,695\nYou're focused on security, and\nso you got to have that mindset,\n\n729\n00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:38,825\nthat you have to help that team understand\nthe importance of security, and\n\n730\n00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:42,305\npoint out the things that are going to\nbe critical to your group's success,\n\n731\n00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:45,445\nthe success of the team,\nin building this project.\n\n732\n00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:46,405\nVery important.\n\n733\n00:39:46,405 --> 00:39:47,195\n>> Absolutely.\n\n734\n00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:50,015\n>> So as we talk about that,\nthinking about those things leads us to\n\n735\n00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:52,485\nreally understanding testing and\ndevelopment of systems.\n\n736\n00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:54,015\nJust a quick thought here.\n\n737\n00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:57,464\nWe never want to expose sensitive data or\nsensitive information.\n\n738\n00:39:57,464 --> 00:40:02,364\nAs we're testing so when we load user data\nor test sets in to validate our use cases,\n\n739\n00:40:02,364 --> 00:40:06,635\nwe don't want to take production\ninformation, put it into a non secured\n\n740\n00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:11,132\nsystem and run it through its paces to\nvalidate and kick the tire so to speak.\n\n741\n00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:14,359\nWanna use sample data, test data,\nvery important as a thought process.\n\n742\n00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:18,042\nThe security practitioner should be\nthinking about that, bringing that up in\n\n743\n00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:22,240\nthe planning meetings, and making sure\nsomebody's got that on their to-do list.\n\n744\n00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,920\nSe we don't just go grab\ndata that's lying around and\n\n745\n00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,230\nas a result, you obviously potentially\nexpose things that should not be exposed.\n\n746\n00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,350\nWanna run through this idea of\nerror handling and load test.\n\n747\n00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,950\nHow do we scale up and stress\nthe system in such a way to break it?\n\n748\n00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,330\nIn effect, the goal of a good test is\nto figure out where the boundaries of\n\n749\n00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,500\nthe system lie, and if we can stress\nthe system to the point of failure,\n\n750\n00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,760\nit's not because we wanna break\nthe system, and that's the goal, but\n\n751\n00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,900\nwe wanna understand what will\nhappen if the system breaks.\n\n752\n00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,640\nThe better engineer\nsuccessful dealing with and\n\n753\n00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,350\nsuccessful outcomes around\nthose break points.\n\n754\n00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,440\nAnd so we wanna make sure we're\nbuilding our tests in such a way\n\n755\n00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,220\nthat we understand how to create success\n\n756\n00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,210\nout of failure as opposed to failure\ndespite what else we're doing.\n\n757\n00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:10,970\nSo think about maximum load testing, error\nhandling, what are those error codes?\n\n758\n00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,700\nHow does all that stuff kicked out?\n\n759\n00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,280\nHow do we manage through that?\n\n760\n00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,168\nAnd if we're not getting good documented\nfeedback in the system as we're testing,\n\n761\n00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:21,067\nthis is the place where we stop and\nsay to the developers, hey,\n\n762\n00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:22,785\nwhat are we doing about this or that?\n\n763\n00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:26,780\nAnd you may not be that expert that\nclearly understands how to do that, and\n\n764\n00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,850\nsay to somebody, hey, I don't get\nwhat this garbled code is over here.\n\n765\n00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,650\nWhat is its output?\n\n766\n00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,590\nWhat does it mean?\n\n767\n00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,480\nBut again this is a team effort.\n\n768\n00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,647\nYou may not be the guy or the girl that\nunderstands how to do the stress test and\n\n769\n00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:42,361\ndo the error handling checks but\nthat doesn't mean you don't go and\n\n770\n00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:45,910\nfind somebody and get them on\nthe team that specializes in that.\n\n771\n00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,820\nAnd that's really what's important,\nis make sure the team is validated and\n\n772\n00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,655\nthat we have the right skills.\n\n773\n00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:53,835\nI often think about Mission Impossible.\n\n774\n00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:56,525\nI don't know if you were\na fan of the old TV show, but\n\n775\n00:41:56,525 --> 00:42:00,360\nI grew up watching the original TV show,\nwith Peter Graves, right.\n\n776\n00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,480\n>> You had me worried cuz I thought\nyou were going the Tom Cruise route.\n\n777\n00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,683\n>> No. No, no. I'm old school.\n\n778\n00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:06,498\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So just like with Star Trek,\n\n779\n00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:07,770\n[LAUGH] I'm an original.\n\n780\n00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,200\nI'm not the new school person.\n\n781\n00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,670\nSo I grew up watching the original\nMission Impossible on TV,\n\n782\n00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,270\nprobably gives you a general\nidea of how old I may be, right?\n\n783\n00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,930\nSo, the idea there was that I always loved\nthe way they opened the show because\n\n784\n00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,340\nyou saw Mr.\nPhelps get his message somewhere.\n\n785\n00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,520\nSo, he was off in the desert, walked in to\na phone booth in the middle of nowhere.\n\n786\n00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,170\nListen to this recording and\n\n787\n00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,390\nthen all of a sudden decided that you\nknow the recording was going to explode.\n\n788\n00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:35,220\nHe drives away shows up in this\nreally cool 60s bachelor pad right.\n\n789\n00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,500\nAnd you know sitting in his mod\nfurniture chair at the table and\n\n790\n00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,300\nhe pulls out the portfolio of\nthe mission specialist, right,\n\n791\n00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,680\nyou know the mission impossible mission\nspecialist and as a result of that\n\n792\n00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,660\nhe's then flipping through those\npages finding those pictures,\n\n793\n00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,440\nthrows the team members photos on\nthe desk that he wants for that episode.\n\n794\n00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,020\nSo he'd throw down Martin Landow, and\nhe would throw down whoever it was, and\n\n795\n00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,635\nhe would build this team, you know Peter\nLupus, the big guy with the muscles so\n\n796\n00:43:01,635 --> 00:43:04,305\nthey would build this team, and\nthen the next thing you see,\n\n797\n00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:07,465\nthey jump to the shot where everybody's in\nthe room together, discussing the project.\n\n798\n00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:10,015\nOkay, what's the mission for\nthis particular week?\n\n799\n00:43:10,015 --> 00:43:11,395\nHow are we gonna approach it?\n\n800\n00:43:11,395 --> 00:43:12,745\nWhose job is gonna be this?\n\n801\n00:43:12,745 --> 00:43:13,745\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n802\n00:43:13,745 --> 00:43:15,673\nAnd everybody had a specialty, right?\n\n803\n00:43:15,673 --> 00:43:20,305\nSo you know, Martin Landau was the guy\nthat did the masks and the voices, right?\n\n804\n00:43:20,305 --> 00:43:22,775\nAnd Peter Lucas, the guy I just mentioned,\nwas the guy with the muscles,\n\n805\n00:43:22,775 --> 00:43:27,050\nthe big guy who did all the heavy lifting,\nand so that kind of thing is what we\n\n806\n00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,830\nthink about when we talk about a project\nthat's well structured and a project team.\n\n807\n00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,420\nEverybody has their job, everybody\nhas their role, everybody gets it and\n\n808\n00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,510\nthen you've got this project manager,\nin this case Mr. Phelps,\n\n809\n00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,970\nPeter Graves, who is the coordinator,\nwho orchestrates everything and\n\n810\n00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,250\nwill ultimately make sure\nthat the team stays on task.\n\n811\n00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,200\nHe may or may not, she may or may not,\nhave skills specific to one of those jobs,\n\n812\n00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,420\nbut has a much more\nimportant set of skills.\n\n813\n00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,000\nThe ability to communicate and\nmanage across the team.\n\n814\n00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,780\nAnd this is really very critical, because\nthis is where we create success, and this\n\n815\n00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,040\nis where the security practitioner can\nadd tremendous value to the organization.\n\n816\n00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,100\nIt's figuring out how to\norganize the security aspects\n\n817\n00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,260\nof that communication around that team.\n\n818\n00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,330\nSo just be aware of that and think\nabout that as we talk about testing and\n\n819\n00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,200\ndevelopment of systems.\n\n820\n00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,560\nAnd remember, old school is\nalways better than new school.\n\n821\n00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,630\nRemember that as well.\n\n822\n00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,730\nAll right so when we talk about system\nprocurement as we get through testing and\n\n823\n00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,260\nget through the life cycle, we build\nsomething, we've got to go out and\n\n824\n00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,320\nactually get something,\nbuy it as opposed to just building it and\n\n825\n00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,470\nor take the output of the build and\nofficially turn it on and accept it.\n\n826\n00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,290\nSo we want to talk about procurement, and\nthis idea is getting new equipment in and\n\n827\n00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:42,120\nor building new equipment to spec, and\nbringing it into the organization but\n\n828\n00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,080\nwe have to make sure that we\nevaluate different solutions.\n\n829\n00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,220\nYou heard Don mention earlier that if\nwe don't think about the impact that\n\n830\n00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,620\nthe purchase or the acceptance of this\nparticular will have to the company,\n\n831\n00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,020\nwe may be running into a situation\nwhere we get things we don't need.\n\n832\n00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,940\nWe pay more for things that may or\nmay not be appropriate for us.\n\n833\n00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,780\nSo we wanna make sure we\nfollow the procurement cycle,\n\n834\n00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,250\nwhatever that is in our company.\n\n835\n00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,670\nThere should be some sort\nof documented system,\n\n836\n00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,620\na procedure that lays out what that\nprocurement cycle should look like.\n\n837\n00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,210\nSo typically that involves going through\n\n838\n00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,730\ntypically the financial arm\nof the organization and\n\n839\n00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:19,600\nlegal typically has a seat at that\ntable to understand contracts.\n\n840\n00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,530\nIT typically is a entity, should have\na seat at the table to understand\n\n841\n00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:27,520\nthe implications of bringing a system\nonline, again this is one of those areas\n\n842\n00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,150\nwhere unfortunately we tend to see\ndisconnect because if IT is not consulted,\n\n843\n00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:35,800\nand somebody goes out and acquires\na piece of hardware or software and\n\n844\n00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,080\nbrings it in as an afterthought and\nsays by the way, happy birthday,\n\n845\n00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,280\n[LAUGH] right here you go,\nhere's the thing, we hope you enjoy it.\n\n846\n00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,540\nThat's where we start to\nkinda have issues, and\n\n847\n00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,270\nso, this happens in small companies a lot.\n\n848\n00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,440\nIt doesn't happen as much\nin big companies, but\n\n849\n00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,540\nI can remember starting out\nmy days in IT early on,\n\n850\n00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,340\nwhere my boss would come in having\ngone away somewhere for the weekend,\n\n851\n00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,970\nreading an article or looking at something\nor talking to a buddy of his or hers and\n\n852\n00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:05,140\nthey would say, oh, and by the way,\nI found this new thing and here it is and\n\n853\n00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,700\nliterally throw the the newspaper or\nthe magazine or\n\n854\n00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,180\nthe device it being, say hey by the way,\nwe need you to figure out how to do this.\n\n855\n00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,260\nSo it's almost like an after thought.\n\n856\n00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,480\nBy the way, now that we own it we\nprobably should figure out how to use it.\n\n857\n00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,540\nAnd that's not the best way to build and\nevaluate and ultimately acquire systems,\n\n858\n00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:25,890\nbecause it's very difficult to create\nthe opportunity to integrate successfully.\n\n859\n00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,920\nAnd it's not about sameness,\nwe don't wanna have all the same thing.\n\n860\n00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,790\nQuite the opposite,\nwe wanna have different systems to create\n\n861\n00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,580\nthe opportunity to more secure\nbecause now can add layers, but\n\n862\n00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,720\nwe want to do that in an integrated and\n\n863\n00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,770\noverall fashion that has a plan\nassociated with it as opposed randomness.\n\n864\n00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,220\nRandomness is often the enemy, right,\nas opposed to the ally of security.\n\n865\n00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,050\nSo think about that, that butterfly effect\nwe often hear about sometimes in change\n\n866\n00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,410\nmanagement, is this idea of\nunintended consequences and\n\n867\n00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:57,600\nthose kind of random events can lead\nto ripples in the pond down the road.\n\n868\n00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,680\nSo think about that,\nthis idea of procurement and\n\n869\n00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,310\nsystem procurement really leads us to one\nof the most important central elements\n\n870\n00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:07,640\nthat a security practitioner needs\nto be aware of in this topic,\n\n871\n00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,510\nsystem procurement and development life\ncycles, which is this idea of a framework,\n\n872\n00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,930\nspecifically the framework\nof the common criteria.\n\n873\n00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,530\nSo let's talk about\nthe common criteria for\n\n874\n00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:18,850\na minute in relation to system\nprocurement, system testing,\n\n875\n00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,730\nwhich is really what the common\ncriteria is all about.\n\n876\n00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:27,090\nAnd this idea of being able to go through\na standardized model that everybody\n\n877\n00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:31,940\nhas agreed is gonna be the way to go to\ntext and ultimately evaluate systems, and\n\n878\n00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,480\nas a result of that, come out the far\nside with an understanding and\n\n879\n00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,510\nan expectation that the system\nthat is evaluated at this level,\n\n880\n00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,860\nwhatever that level is,\nshould be able to do these things.\n\n881\n00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,420\nThis is what the common\ncriteria stands for.\n\n882\n00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,405\nThe common criteria is more commonly,\nquote unquote,\n\n883\n00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:53,910\nno pun intended,\nreferred to as the ISO standard, ISO/IEC.\n\n884\n00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,596\nISO stands for\nInternational Standards Organization.\n\n885\n00:47:56,596 --> 00:48:00,756\nSo you could see on the screen there,\nthe ISO/IEC standard,\n\n886\n00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:06,356\nnumber 15408 which is the official\nstandard number for the common criteria,\n\n887\n00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:11,156\nand you could see we've thrown\nthe website URL up on the screen for you,\n\n888\n00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:14,516\nwhere you can go and\nfind if the ISO organization,\n\n889\n00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:19,095\niso.org The actual landing page\nin the library for this standard.\n\n890\n00:48:19,095 --> 00:48:24,080\nMost ISO standards unless they're in draft\nat the time that you're looking at them.\n\n891\n00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,130\nWhich means you may not be able to\nget a copy of it while it's in draft,\n\n892\n00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,400\nusually for free.\n\n893\n00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,410\nBut most of the standards,\n\n894\n00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,700\nespecially the ones that have been\nofficially agreed to and are now\n\n895\n00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,470\nput out as official standards, you do\nhave to spend a little money to acquire.\n\n896\n00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,560\nThey're not free.\n\n897\n00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,480\nBut if you Google and look around for\nthem, you often can find them posted, or\n\n898\n00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,250\nat least references to them posted.\n\n899\n00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,370\nA lot of times, believe it or\n\n900\n00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:48,050\nnot, places like Wikipedia\nwill have very good summaries.\n\n901\n00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,050\nI can't believe I just recommended\nWikipedia as a standard,\n\n902\n00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,660\nbut you can go out and look at Wikipedia.\n\n903\n00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,920\nIt is, all kidding aside, a good point\nof reference as a landing page and\n\n904\n00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,740\na starting point for\nyou to do some fact finding, right?\n\n905\n00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,040\nIt may not be the only source, and\nhopefully not the only one you look to,\n\n906\n00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,610\nbut it is a very valuable\nsource as a starting point.\n\n907\n00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,070\nAnd they often summarize these documents\nand make them available to you in a high\n\n908\n00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,890\nlevel fashion so you get the jest, the\ngeneral idea of what's in the standards.\n\n909\n00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,320\nSo having said that,\nthe common criteria becomes very important\n\n910\n00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,650\nbecause we want to make sure\nwe understand that the.\n\n911\n00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,580\nThe common criteria is really gonna be how\nwe should be, as security practitioners,\n\n912\n00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,930\ndoing our evaluation.\n\n913\n00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,860\nAnd so the common criteria\nhas an interesting history.\n\n914\n00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,210\nNow let's quickly just run\nthrough that for you so\n\n915\n00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,700\nyou have a better sense of\nwhere this is coming from.\n\n916\n00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,450\nBecause as an international, agreed upon\nstandard that multiple countries and\n\n917\n00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,710\nultimately, multiple businesses are using,\n\n918\n00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,920\nwe wanna make sure we\nunderstand where it came from.\n\n919\n00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,840\nAnd so the US, as a government entity, as\na state, went out early on we're talking\n\n920\n00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,550\nabout in the 70's and created a set of\nstandards known as the Rainbow Series.\n\n921\n00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:54,410\nAnd the Rainbow Series was a group\nof books that were put together\n\n922\n00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,170\nin partnership with the US government,\nDepartment of Defense,\n\n923\n00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:02,140\nIBM played a role in them as well, and\nwere drafted based on defining standards\n\n924\n00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,270\nto create secure networks, secure systems\nIt was called the Rainbow Series because\n\n925\n00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,010\nevery book in the series\nhad a color-coded cover.\n\n926\n00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,520\nSo you had a red book,\n\n927\n00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,690\nyou had an orange book,\nyou had a green book, yellow book, etc.\n\n928\n00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:17,330\nYou can actually Google for them and\nstill find copies of them online today.\n\n929\n00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:22,200\nThe original source documentation is\nreally not used per se anymore as\n\n930\n00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,280\na direct related standard\nin it of itself but\n\n931\n00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,110\nthe ideas behind it are underlying\nthings like the common criteria.\n\n932\n00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,640\nAnd so what you need to know\nis that the Rainbow Series had\n\n933\n00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,110\ntwo books in particular.\n\n934\n00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,800\nThat were very critical and\n\n935\n00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,810\nwere really seen as historical\ndocuments that are worthy of note.\n\n936\n00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:42,480\nThe red book which was known as the TNI or\nthe Trusted Network Infrastructure\n\n937\n00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,190\nsolution, this is where we laid out the\narchitecture of networks and understood\n\n938\n00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:50,130\nhow to build them, and the orange book\nwhich dealt with classification and\n\n939\n00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,420\nsecurity levels and maintaining access\ncontrol, confidentiality, systems,\n\n940\n00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,380\nthings like that.\n\n941\n00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,990\nAnd so these are the two that\nare referenceable items.\n\n942\n00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:01,830\nAnd that you as an SSCP candidate or\nsomebody who wants to be knowledgeable\n\n943\n00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,560\nabout security should understand and\nbe able to identify.\n\n944\n00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,660\nThe red book, known as the TNI,\nand the orange book.\n\n945\n00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:12,090\nAnd both books together deal with\nhow we evaluate a system, but\n\n946\n00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,630\nin particular the orange book deals\nwith an evaluation criteria set,\n\n947\n00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:19,810\na level of criteria's that we use,\nthat were alphanumeric in nature.\n\n948\n00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,470\nAnd so we had an A, B, C, D.\n\n949\n00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,800\nRanking and rating system we\nstarted from D at the ground level.\n\n950\n00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,110\nSo D was the lowest level system,\nreally no protection at all.\n\n951\n00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:33,420\nAnd we then worked our way up\nfrom D to C to B to A, and\n\n952\n00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,850\nwithin each level we would have,\ndepending on the level, different numbers.\n\n953\n00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:43,750\nSo a C3 system, a C2 and a C1 system,\nthen a B2, a B1, an A1, things like that.\n\n954\n00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:48,003\nAnd C3 was going to be moving up the\nchain, if you will in terms of security\n\n955\n00:51:48,003 --> 00:51:52,597\nand going through that, so the idea would\nbe there that we understand that we had\n\n956\n00:51:52,597 --> 00:51:56,871\nan alpha numeric designation and\nan A1 system at the very top of the food.\n\n957\n00:51:56,871 --> 00:52:00,708\nChain was gonna be the most secure, and\nin this case was the system we dealt with\n\n958\n00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:04,783\ntypically and thought about as being\npotentially artificially intelligent, and\n\n959\n00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:08,620\nso that idea would be very highly\nadvanced highly developed solutions.\n\n960\n00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,610\nWould exist there.\n\n961\n00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:14,060\nThis criteria that I just mentioned,\nthe alpha-numeric scale, the D to A with\n\n962\n00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,620\nthe rankings of one, two, three associated\nwith it, was known as the TCSEC.\n\n963\n00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,250\nThe TCSEC.\n\n964\n00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,410\nAnd this comes out of the orange book,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n965\n00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:26,740\nEventually, we take the TCSEC, US\ngovernment does, we get together with some\n\n966\n00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:32,470\nother countries, the UK, Canada Germany,\nFrance, Netherlands in particular.\n\n967\n00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:36,470\nAnd another grouping is created called\nthe IT SEC and this is just another set of\n\n968\n00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,460\ncriteria that ultimately is gonna\nbe a starting point for evaluation.\n\n969\n00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:45,250\nAnd the IT SEC is going to create what is\nknown as devaluation assurance levels.\n\n970\n00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,210\nWhat are known as EALs.\n\n971\n00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,250\nAnd they are ranked\nfrom one through seven,\n\n972\n00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,940\nso there's a numerical listing as\nopposed to an alphanumeric designation.\n\n973\n00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,250\nWith TCSEC.\n\n974\n00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:58,430\nAnd the EAL's going from one, which is the\nlowest, to seven, which is the highest,\n\n975\n00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,440\nhelps us to step through what a secure\nsystem architecture looks like.\n\n976\n00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,180\nAnd rank and\nevaluate based on that, as well.\n\n977\n00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,800\nAnd so these evaluations are done\nin labs that are certified\n\n978\n00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,990\nto do EAL evaluations today.\n\n979\n00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,630\nThey're scattered all over the world,\nso you can go and have a product or\n\n980\n00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:17,320\na solution tested, and you send it\nto one or more of these labs and\n\n981\n00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,390\nget it certified.\n\n982\n00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:19,680\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n983\n00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,540\nAnd as a result in EAL level ranking,\nreally assures that the vendor's\n\n984\n00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,940\nclaims around security,\nsecure architectures are being validated.\n\n985\n00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,530\nSo when a company says oh,\nour system is ranked as an EAL level five.\n\n986\n00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,630\nLet's just say hypothetically.\n\n987\n00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,300\nThen somebody who buys that,\nshould understand, and as a result, it has\n\n988\n00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:41,360\na guarantee, that the system performs at\na certain level, has certain features and\n\n989\n00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,870\ncapabilities that are available, and as\na result, has an overall security profile\n\n990\n00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:49,890\nof a certain type, whatever that type\nis based on the AL ranking as a result.\n\n991\n00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,340\nSo be aware of that, make sure that\nyou are familiar with the concept.\n\n992\n00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:57,410\nYou may wanna go out, and\ndo a little checking on your\n\n993\n00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:01,850\nown on what EAL levels are, and just\nhow to understand the rankings of them.\n\n994\n00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:05,940\nThis may be a good opportunity for\nyou to use Google as a tool, to go out and\n\n995\n00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,300\njust find that.\n\n996\n00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,140\nYou can find a list of labs\nthat are engaged in this\n\n997\n00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,960\nparticular kind of testing.\n\n998\n00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,770\nSo those are things to consider.\n\n999\n00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,840\nAnd so as we drop some notes here, just to\nkind of recap what we were talking about.\n\n1000\n00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,740\nWe had the Rainbow Series,\nyou can see that Don is busy\n\n1001\n00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,960\ntyping away there on the screen as we're\ntalking and putting some notes up for you.\n\n1002\n00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,810\nHe's got a list for the Rainbow Series,\na URL you can check out on Wikipedia.\n\n1003\n00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:31,510\nAnd he's gonna put up some information\nthere as well, just about EAL criteria and\n\n1004\n00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,660\ncertifications, just be aware of that.\n\n1005\n00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:38,070\nThe common criteria really is gonna be\nhelpful for you to understand the rankings\n\n1006\n00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:41,710\nand understand the EAL levels and\nall the things that we are talking about.\n\n1007\n00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:47,600\nRemember, the ISO standard is how we\ncommonly, officially, will refer to that.\n\n1008\n00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,800\nBut in just average everyday IT speak,\nwe often refer to the common criteria.\n\n1009\n00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,945\nSo having said that,\ncommon criteria, right?\n\n1010\n00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:58,315\nEAL levels, things of that nature,\nall very important.\n\n1011\n00:54:58,315 --> 00:55:01,525\nWe wanna make sure we're aware of those\nthings, and as security practitioners that\n\n1012\n00:55:01,525 --> 00:55:03,735\nyou're bringing that thought\nprocess to the table.\n\n1013\n00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:06,832\nAgain, you may not be the one that\nultimately drives acquisition,\n\n1014\n00:55:06,832 --> 00:55:10,692\nyou may not be the one certainly who\ndoes testing, in an organization or\n\n1015\n00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:12,362\nvalidates testing output.\n\n1016\n00:55:12,362 --> 00:55:16,382\nYou may go out to third party labs,\nas we mentioned, for EAL testing for\n\n1017\n00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:20,742\ninstance and you may get external help to\nunderstand how to implement a standard\n\n1018\n00:55:20,742 --> 00:55:25,822\nlike an ISO standard to a line because ISO\ncertification is a multi year process for\n\n1019\n00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,380\na business and can often times\nbe very expensive to take on.\n\n1020\n00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,010\nBut that doesn't mean\nthat you don't go out and\n\n1021\n00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:34,500\nbring awareness of these particular\nitems back to the business.\n\n1022\n00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,890\nAnd this is really the important message\nwe wanna make sure you're aware of.\n\n1023\n00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:39,372\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n1024\n00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:41,985\nAll right well looks like we're getting\npretty close to our break spot so\n\n1025\n00:55:41,985 --> 00:55:43,445\nwhy don't we stop here and take a break.\n\n1026\n00:55:43,445 --> 00:55:45,915\nWhen we get back we still have\na lot more to get through.\n\n1027\n00:55:45,915 --> 00:55:51,815\nThis objective is actually\n>> Quite a lot of content absolutely.\n\n1028\n00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:52,675\n>> So let's stop here.\n\n1029\n00:55:52,675 --> 00:55:55,130\nStay tuned, we'll be back in just a few.\n\n1030\n00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:59,467\n[MUSIC]\n\n1031\n00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:04,530\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1032\n00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:08,047\nWe just talked a bit about common\ncriteria, and I know we got through a good\n\n1033\n00:56:08,047 --> 00:56:11,422\nbit there on the history of it, and\nEAL levels and all that good stuff.\n\n1034\n00:56:11,422 --> 00:56:15,927\nBut we got plenty more to go through,\nso let's go ahead and jump back into it.\n\n1035\n00:56:15,927 --> 00:56:16,495\n>> All right wonderful.\n\n1036\n00:56:16,495 --> 00:56:20,880\nWe were talking about where some of these\nstandards come from, how we actually go\n\n1037\n00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,460\nThrough and deal with evaluating systems,\nthe EAL conversation we were just having.\n\n1038\n00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,270\nWe now need to really talk about\nquickly just this idea of how we'd\n\n1039\n00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,900\ncome to an end of life and\nwhat we'd do with disposal of assets.\n\n1040\n00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,080\nAnd so this idea is really about making\nsure the security professional knows\n\n1041\n00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,310\nthat it's not okay to just take a piece of\nequipment and toss it on the recycling bin\n\n1042\n00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,960\nor toss it in the trash, walk away, and\nobviously at that point not have a care or\n\n1043\n00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,220\nconcern about the information that\nmay still be sitting in that device.\n\n1044\n00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,900\nSo data remnants is what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n1045\n00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,310\nWe wanna make sure we understand that\nthere are procedures that have to\n\n1046\n00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:54,270\nbe followed.\n\n1047\n00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:59,690\nSafely disposing of the information\ntoday will typically involve the ideas\n\n1048\n00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:03,800\nof degaussing, we talked about degaussing\nin one of our prior conversations.\n\n1049\n00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,780\nThis idea of using\na magnetic field to remove\n\n1050\n00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:10,640\nany information that may be contained\nin magnetic media, scattering it and\n\n1051\n00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,170\neffectively formatting the drive and\nwiping it such a way through zeroing out,\n\n1052\n00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:19,880\nor zeroization, which is another term\nwe often use to help us make sure\n\n1053\n00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,610\nthat the data has been overwritten is\nsuch a way that it's not recoverable.\n\n1054\n00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,220\nAnd so there's multiple processes,\nprocedures, and\n\n1055\n00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,520\nultimately products that the security\nprofessional can look to and\n\n1056\n00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,820\ncan use in order to make sure\nthat we drive through this.\n\n1057\n00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:36,020\nPhysical destruction, whether we\nare shredding media, shredding drives,\n\n1058\n00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,520\nperhaps melting them and\ngetting rid of them.\n\n1059\n00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,120\nNothing like a little termite\nbeing brought to the party to\n\n1060\n00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,070\ninsure proper destruction, and by the way\nif you've actually seen termite being\n\n1061\n00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:50,080\nused to do destruction it may be\nworth a YouTube visit on your part.\n\n1062\n00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,890\n[LAUGH] But Googling or doing\na YouTube quick search for termite and\n\n1063\n00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:59,850\nmedia destruction will render some very\ninteresting looks at the world of high\n\n1064\n00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:03,510\nexplosive pyrotechnics, which you\nmay very well be interested in that.\n\n1065\n00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,460\n>> I was thinking that line\nfrom the movie Aliens,\n\n1066\n00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,110\nwhere they say take off, nuke the site\nfrom orbit, it's the only way to be sure.\n\n1067\n00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,330\nThat's how we can guarantee\nour data destruction.\n\n1068\n00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:12,600\n>> That is absolutely correct.\n\n1069\n00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,040\nSo you know, gas furnaces are used\nto obviously to destroy paper and\n\n1070\n00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,100\nthat kind of documentation but\nyou can melt drives, physical drives,\n\n1071\n00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,550\nmelt media in these kind\nof furnaces as well.\n\n1072\n00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,640\nSo you just think about that they\nhave industrial string shredders\n\n1073\n00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,020\nthat can be used, to basically\ndestroy this kind of media as well.\n\n1074\n00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:36,140\nRemoving content from inventory,\nrendering it marked in an asset management\n\n1075\n00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:40,900\nsolution to render it not usable is not\nthe same thing as properly destroying it.\n\n1076\n00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,160\nIt's simply you are preparing the\norganization to know that that media or\n\n1077\n00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,830\nthose resources are no longer gonna\nbe considered part of the active\n\n1078\n00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,920\nuse of cycle.\n\n1079\n00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,500\nSo data recovery is well in making sure\nwe understand what can be recovered and\n\n1080\n00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,830\nwhat cannot be recovered, are areas of\nthe physical, a security person, right,\n\n1081\n00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,650\nthe security practitioner,\nthe physical security\n\n1082\n00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:03,590\nthat is also dealing with asset\nmanagement needs to be aware of.\n\n1083\n00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:05,730\nAnd really taking time,\nit's things that are obvious,\n\n1084\n00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:09,510\nlike photocopiers that may have\nhard drives inside of them today.\n\n1085\n00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,560\nNetwork devices, any kind of a devices,\na printer for instance,\n\n1086\n00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,080\nall these things have\nmemory buffers in them, but\n\n1087\n00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,360\nalso are gonna have storage media and\nstorage capacity.\n\n1088\n00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,210\nYour phone,\n\n1089\n00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:22,780\nwe talked about smartphones earlier on in\nsome of our beginning conversations and\n\n1090\n00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,820\nthis idea of the media cards that\ncan be encrypted inside of them.\n\n1091\n00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,110\nAll these things today we take for\ngranted.\n\n1092\n00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:31,550\nAnd most people are walking around\nwith that corporate information\n\n1093\n00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:34,000\non those devices in their hands.\n\n1094\n00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,420\nYou know, today the boundary of your\nnetwork is the endpoint device.\n\n1095\n00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,710\nIt is no longer a well demarcated,\n\n1096\n00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:45,060\nwell established defense line that\nsits in a logical design at your DMZ.\n\n1097\n00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:48,680\nThe DMZ is traveling with\nyour users in real time and\n\n1098\n00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,150\nit's in a Starbucks Coffee shop,\nit's in a restaurant, it's in a bar,\n\n1099\n00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:57,200\nit's at home, it's on a plane,\nbecause we have wifi in the air today.\n\n1100\n00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,020\nSo as a result,\n\n1101\n00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:03,730\nanywhere users are that access information\nis where your information lives.\n\n1102\n01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,340\nAnd if you're not prepared as a security\nprofessional to safeguard and\n\n1103\n01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,770\nsecure that data during active use,\nduring the life cycle of the data, but\n\n1104\n01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:16,310\nalso upon rendering the data no\nlonger usable through destruction.\n\n1105\n01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:21,660\nMaybe that means reaching out and\nwiping the personal side of a device,\n\n1106\n01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:26,160\nhopefully not if it's avoidable, but\nyou may have to wipe that device if that\n\n1107\n01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,600\ndevice doesn't have a way of\ndistinguishing between the business and\n\n1108\n01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,930\nthe professional side,\nas well as the personal side of data.\n\n1109\n01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,330\nSo some smartphones can, some cannot.\n\n1110\n01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,130\nBlackberry has been well-known\nin the industry for many years.\n\n1111\n01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:39,800\nThey have that ability, for instance,\n\n1112\n01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,300\nto be able to differentiate with their\nprofessional and personal work spaces.\n\n1113\n01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,150\nAnd so that kind of a device being\nremotely wiped allows you to manage\n\n1114\n01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:52,640\nthe corporate data separate from\nthe personal data, not all phones,\n\n1115\n01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,140\nnot all devices can but however security\npractitioner gets there, having the plan\n\n1116\n01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:01,170\nin place ahead of time to understand how\nto it is critical to success, right?\n\n1117\n01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:03,820\nWe can't, after the fact,\ngo chasing after the device and\n\n1118\n01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,782\nhopefully be able to render it inoperable.\n\n1119\n01:01:05,782 --> 01:01:07,004\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1120\n01:01:07,004 --> 01:01:10,106\n>> Yeah and you know, a lot of people\nimmediately think of hard drives,\n\n1121\n01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:11,390\nanything that has storage,\n\n1122\n01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:15,100\nhard drives, flash memories, so\nphones, PCs, laptops, whatever.\n\n1123\n01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,130\nThere are a lot of devices\nthat get overlooked though.\n\n1124\n01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:22,400\nAnd I know I was shocked once when I\npurchased a refurbished firewall and\n\n1125\n01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,150\nit was a Cisco ASA and\n\n1126\n01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:27,460\nit still had the configuration on\nthere from a previous customer.\n\n1127\n01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:31,410\nAnd when you look at that, just thinking\nabout it, I was like all right well\n\n1128\n01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:35,780\nI've got this company's public IP, and\ntheir access control list right here.\n\n1129\n01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:38,940\nI know specifically what's allowed for\ntheir system.\n\n1130\n01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:43,380\nThe VPN keys which likely were unchanged,\nthat information is in there.\n\n1131\n01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:48,580\nA device like a firewall,\na SSL VPN, those kind of appliances,\n\n1132\n01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,750\nthey get overlooked because we don't\nthink of them as having a hard drive, but\n\n1133\n01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,417\nthey've got a configuration, and that's\nsensitive, really sensitive data on it.\n\n1134\n01:01:55,417 --> 01:02:00,085\n>> It is and you raise an excellent point,\nwhich is what often happens is,\n\n1135\n01:02:00,085 --> 01:02:03,155\nthat configuration simply gets\ntransferred to a new device,\n\n1136\n01:02:03,155 --> 01:02:06,775\nmost likely was not updated or changed,\nat least not in any significant way.\n\n1137\n01:02:06,775 --> 01:02:11,155\nYou may have added some lines to the\naccess control list, or the allow list,\n\n1138\n01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:13,825\nto allow new services to be spun up, but\n\n1139\n01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:18,765\nthe password most likely, the IP address\nmost certainly, the general config and\n\n1140\n01:02:18,765 --> 01:02:22,850\nsecurity stance of that device, has\nprobably not changed, and the fact that\n\n1141\n01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:28,180\nit's available is a really big concern for\nus as security practitioners, right?\n\n1142\n01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:31,840\nWe call that an RGE in\nthe business by the way, right?\n\n1143\n01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,540\nThe RGE,\nanother acronym you need to know, right?\n\n1144\n01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,270\nThe RGE stands for\nResume Generation Event, right?\n\n1145\n01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:42,050\nSo if you let those kind of configs escape\nthe boundary of your network because you\n\n1146\n01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:46,620\nare cycling devices into a some\nsort of a managed recycling\n\n1147\n01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,030\nprogram of whatever it may be where we\nget these vendors that will come by and\n\n1148\n01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:53,360\nbulk purchase all your old gear,\nrecycle it, whatever it is.\n\n1149\n01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,207\nIf you give them that ability,\n\n1150\n01:02:55,207 --> 01:02:59,269\nboy are we going to potentially have\na lot of problems down the road.\n\n1151\n01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:02,953\n>> And the way we protect from that,\nis when the equipment was deployed,\n\n1152\n01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:06,271\nwhen we created that original\nlifecycle and deployment plan.\n\n1153\n01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:10,247\nAs part of the deployment at that time\nwhen the device is brand new, you plan for\n\n1154\n01:03:10,247 --> 01:03:13,380\nhow it's disposed and you say,\nwhen this device is removed,\n\n1155\n01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,340\nhere is how you wipe its memory.\n\n1156\n01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:18,810\nSo when it does finally reach that point,\nwhich might be seven years later.\n\n1157\n01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,900\nNetwork equipment can run a long time.\n\n1158\n01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,880\nSo it might be seven\nyears down the road and\n\n1159\n01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,840\nyou say all right what's the disposal\nprocedure for this piece of equipment?\n\n1160\n01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,920\nDo you ensure that memory gets wiped, or\nif you can't ensure it, I've had this,\n\n1161\n01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,320\nwhere there was a particular appliance\nwhere you couldn't guarantee it was wiped,\n\n1162\n01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,810\nand so you don't resell it, you do destroy\nit but warranty returns are another\n\n1163\n01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,520\nspot where people don't treat\nit as disposal but they should.\n\n1164\n01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,300\nIf that device is leaving\nyour organization,\n\n1165\n01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,080\neven if it's being replaced with an\nidentical one, it needs to be disposed of,\n\n1166\n01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,540\nit needs to go through that process.\n\n1167\n01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,063\n>> An on-site service,\nthis is another big issue,\n\n1168\n01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:56,746\nespecially with these network-capable\nall-in-one devices today.\n\n1169\n01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:57,710\nPrinter, scanner,\n\n1170\n01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:01,741\nnetwork-capable devices without mentioning\nvendors because they're all very good.\n\n1171\n01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:06,451\nIt's not about the quality of the device\nbut when the technician comes on site and\n\n1172\n01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:10,398\nservices that device and\nremoves a hard drive and then replaces it,\n\n1173\n01:04:10,398 --> 01:04:15,038\nyou have to make sure in your service\ncontracts up front that you've negotiated\n\n1174\n01:04:15,038 --> 01:04:16,790\nthat you own that hard drive.\n\n1175\n01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,890\nThere's probably an additional\nfee to the company.\n\n1176\n01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,902\nYou're paying a couple hundred\ndollars to keep that drive, but\n\n1177\n01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:25,435\nthat drive has to stay on site with you,\nand not leave with the technician.\n\n1178\n01:04:25,435 --> 01:04:29,831\nCuz there's no way to guarantee what the\nprocess is that the technician's company\n\n1179\n01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:33,390\nwill go through to remove,\nand safely discard that data.\n\n1180\n01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,090\nYou as the practitioner,\nthe security professional,\n\n1181\n01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:39,660\nneed to maintain ownership insight\nof that data at all times.\n\n1182\n01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:42,160\nAnd so, it is important, and\nyou raised a very good point,\n\n1183\n01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,830\nthe vocabulary that we use in one\nof our prior sessions, when we were\n\n1184\n01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:49,560\ntalking about standards, guidelines,\nbaselines, procedures, and policies.\n\n1185\n01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,450\nAnd you mentioned the idea\nof having a dedicated, and\n\n1186\n01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:56,630\ndocumented procedure for\ndata removal, or data destruction.\n\n1187\n01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:01,420\nBut there also has to be a policy that\nguides that at the security level,\n\n1188\n01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,430\nthat's broader than just\nthis one device in this way.\n\n1189\n01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:08,350\nBut a general thought process that says\nto everybody in the organization, hey,\n\n1190\n01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:11,120\nthis is the way we manage information.\n\n1191\n01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,140\nAnd that's whats important, and\nas the security professional,\n\n1192\n01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,840\nthat's what you ultimately are being\ntrained, to understand how to do.\n\n1193\n01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:20,830\nAmong the many things that we're helping\nyou to better understand how to do,\n\n1194\n01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:24,780\nis to bring that common sense approach,\nand that thought process to the business.\n\n1195\n01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:28,597\nSo when we talk about these things,\nwe also talk about certification, and\n\n1196\n01:05:28,597 --> 01:05:29,518\naccreditation.\n\n1197\n01:05:29,518 --> 01:05:33,056\nThis idea of who is gonna be responsible,\nand ultimately who is gonna\n\n1198\n01:05:33,056 --> 01:05:37,600\naccept ownership, and risk for managing\nthese systems as we bring them online.\n\n1199\n01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,467\nAnd so, the idea of certifying,\nand authorizing, and\n\n1200\n01:05:40,467 --> 01:05:44,560\naccrediting is really an idea that doesn't\nexist per se in the private sector.\n\n1201\n01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,861\nIt's not something we often really see\nin a business that does business in\n\n1202\n01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:51,601\nthe private sector, but rather is much\nmore of a government, and military thing.\n\n1203\n01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:56,103\nAnd in particular, not even the military\nespecially, but government broadly, and\n\n1204\n01:05:56,103 --> 01:05:59,730\ngovernments in general will have\nthis kind of procurement process,\n\n1205\n01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:04,190\nthat goes through this iterative cycle\nwhere they appoint certain professionals.\n\n1206\n01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:07,688\nTypically, called the authorizing\nofficers, or authorizing officials\n\n1207\n01:06:07,688 --> 01:06:11,643\ndepending on what they do, and they are\nthe spearhead of this procurement process.\n\n1208\n01:06:11,643 --> 01:06:14,564\nWhere they deal with the vendors,\nand they will basically come in,\n\n1209\n01:06:14,564 --> 01:06:18,290\nthey're basically senior managers,\nyou can think of them as project manager.\n\n1210\n01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:20,750\nLots of different ways of\nreferring to them, but\n\n1211\n01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:24,590\nultimately they are going to be the\napproving authority that will come out,\n\n1212\n01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,643\nand specify what the system needs to do.\n\n1213\n01:06:26,643 --> 01:06:30,317\nAnd then ultimately will go through\nthe process with the vendor to understand\n\n1214\n01:06:30,317 --> 01:06:32,930\nthe build of the system, look at it.\n\n1215\n01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:35,610\nAnd then ultimately the certifier\nis the individual, or\n\n1216\n01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:38,560\nthe team that will be responsible for\nvetting that system.\n\n1217\n01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,240\nThey do the evaluation that we spoke about\nearlier on that particular build, on that\n\n1218\n01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:47,520\nsystem, so the certifier is that group\nof individuals, or team that does that.\n\n1219\n01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,310\nAnd the system owner is going to be\nultimately the person responsible for\n\n1220\n01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:53,510\ndaily operations of that system.\n\n1221\n01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:57,460\nWhoever is gonna turn it on, and manage\nit, and ultimately day to day own it, and\n\n1222\n01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:00,340\ncare for it during its life\ncycle is the system owner.\n\n1223\n01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,330\nSo, three vocabulary\nterms that are important.\n\n1224\n01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:05,980\nThe authorizing official,\nthe certifier, and the system owners,\n\n1225\n01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,600\nwe think about certification,\nand accreditation.\n\n1226\n01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,760\nAnd having said that, let's define\nthe processes of certification,\n\n1227\n01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,800\nand accreditation specifically.\n\n1228\n01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,010\nSo, certification is this idea of a value,\nexcuse me,\n\n1229\n01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:21,030\nevaluation of a project\nthat basically assures, or\n\n1230\n01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:25,330\nprovides the assurance, that this\nsolution will be implemented correctly,\n\n1231\n01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:29,700\neffectively on target, and\non built to spec, if you will.\n\n1232\n01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,360\nOn target, and on task.\n\n1233\n01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,170\nSo we certify, to basically make sure\nthat the system meets the technical\n\n1234\n01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:37,520\nrequirements, that it meets\nthe functional requirements.\n\n1235\n01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,000\nRemember, we identified these in our\nprocess life cycle that we went through to\n\n1236\n01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,400\nunderstand, how to build the system\nduring the system development life cycle.\n\n1237\n01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,230\nWe laid out the eight processes,\nor basic areas, the basic flow.\n\n1238\n01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:51,320\nAnd building, and\nunderstanding the technical, and\n\n1239\n01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,080\nfunctional specs are part of that.\n\n1240\n01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,370\nIt also provide assurance of\nproper operation when we certify.\n\n1241\n01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:59,330\nSo, we must always certify a system.\n\n1242\n01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:01,310\nIt's very important to think about that.\n\n1243\n01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:04,050\nBecause that tells us that\nthe system has been built\n\n1244\n01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:06,550\naccording to the standards\nthat we have laid down.\n\n1245\n01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,810\nAnd we are meeting the business\nobjectives, or goals that that system has\n\n1246\n01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:13,380\nbeen designed effectively to speak to,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n1247\n01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:17,580\nOnce the system has been certified,\nwe can then accredit the system.\n\n1248\n01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:22,040\nAnd a system can never be accredited,\nunless it has been certified first.\n\n1249\n01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,780\nThis is a very important thought\nprocess for you, to go through as well.\n\n1250\n01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:29,690\nThe accreditation process basically\nprovides the official oversight, and\n\n1251\n01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,340\nmanagement of the system.\n\n1252\n01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:35,890\nThe agreement to accept the liability,\nthe risk, and the value of\n\n1253\n01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:39,918\nrunning that system in production\nis what accreditation signifies.\n\n1254\n01:08:39,918 --> 01:08:42,260\nAnd I wanna be clear with you,\nit is about understanding,\n\n1255\n01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:47,530\nand accepting the risk of turning that\nsystem on, that accreditation speaks to.\n\n1256\n01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:48,750\nRisk is very important.\n\n1257\n01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:53,590\nIt is seen as the benchmark for\nformally accepting the risk of using, and\n\n1258\n01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:54,930\nmanaging the system.\n\n1259\n01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,980\nThat is what accreditation represents.\n\n1260\n01:08:56,980 --> 01:09:00,870\nAnd accreditation is management's\nstamp of approval to implement, and\n\n1261\n01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:01,890\nturn on the system.\n\n1262\n01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:05,230\nThis is really how we define it,\nand what we speak to it as being.\n\n1263\n01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:10,200\nAgain, in the private sector, may not\nsee this as being a specific approach.\n\n1264\n01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,080\nYou may not call it these things.\n\n1265\n01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,820\nIt may just be a process that is\ninvolved in procurement overall, and\n\n1266\n01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:19,050\ngenerically wrap it up under\nprocurement in the private sector.\n\n1267\n01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:23,750\nBut in the military, quasi-military\ngovernment areas that we speak to, and\n\n1268\n01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:26,850\ncertainly think about as part\nof our security practice,\n\n1269\n01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,770\nat least in the public sector anyway.\n\n1270\n01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:32,780\nThis is a very well-defined, and\nvery well-understood set of rules, and\n\n1271\n01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:37,030\na very well-defined, and understood\nprocess that has been gone through.\n\n1272\n01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:42,220\nNow, that may change over time,\nwe see evaluation, and standards changing.\n\n1273\n01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,420\nLevels changing, requirements changing.\n\n1274\n01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:48,700\nSo it may not always be that you certify,\nand accredit, per se, in name, but\n\n1275\n01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,570\nthe thought process,\nthe underlying concepts of what those\n\n1276\n01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:55,870\nrepresent to a system, in terms of\nunderstanding the life cycle and\n\n1277\n01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:57,960\nmanagement, and risk, and ownership of it.\n\n1278\n01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,210\nIs always inherent in everything we do.\n\n1279\n01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:02,160\nIt's very important to\nbe thinking about that.\n\n1280\n01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,960\nSo probably good place just for you to\npause for a second, and think in your mind\n\n1281\n01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,050\nabout whether you've ever been involved\nin this particular kind of a process.\n\n1282\n01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:11,615\nHave you gone through certification\npatient, or accreditation.\n\n1283\n01:10:11,615 --> 01:10:12,555\nAnd if not,\n\n1284\n01:10:12,555 --> 01:10:16,405\ndo you know people inside of the business\nthat may be engaging in these activities.\n\n1285\n01:10:16,405 --> 01:10:19,515\nGo speak to them, talk to them,\nask them what they do, and\n\n1286\n01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:22,425\nfind out why it is they do the things\nthey do the way they do them.\n\n1287\n01:10:22,425 --> 01:10:26,615\nAgain, I would refer you back to a PMO,\na project management office, or\n\n1288\n01:10:26,615 --> 01:10:29,085\na change management\nfunction in your business.\n\n1289\n01:10:29,085 --> 01:10:31,425\nThat's often where you see\nthese things occurring, and\n\n1290\n01:10:31,425 --> 01:10:34,730\nalso may be under procurements,\nor contract management.\n\n1291\n01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,510\nMay also be another area where you can go,\nand\n\n1292\n01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:38,810\nfind these kind of\nactivities in a business.\n\n1293\n01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,890\nSo, just some thoughts for you there.\n\n1294\n01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:44,670\nSo having said that, we've talked\na lot about change already, and\n\n1295\n01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:48,420\nthe role that change has, just mentioned\nthe idea of change management scenario\n\n1296\n01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:52,030\nwhere we can often see accreditation,\nand certification taking place, or\n\n1297\n01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,350\nat least being managed through.\n\n1298\n01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:57,130\nAnd this idea of understanding change\nholistically is critical to the success of\n\n1299\n01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:01,160\nthe security practitioner's mindset,\nand also their day to day activities.\n\n1300\n01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,370\nSo, whether we understand\nchange in relation to\n\n1301\n01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:07,330\nmanaging it specifically\nthrough a called our role.\n\n1302\n01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:11,732\nFrameworks such as ITIL for instance call\nout change management as a specific role,\n\n1303\n01:11:11,732 --> 01:11:13,470\nand really think about that way.\n\n1304\n01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:16,825\nOr whether we see change management\nbeing done under the guise of project\n\n1305\n01:11:16,825 --> 01:11:17,660\nmanagement.\n\n1306\n01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:20,440\nAnd it is often rolled up in the PMO,\nand found there.\n\n1307\n01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:25,160\nWe wanna understand that change\ngenerically is something that we see\n\n1308\n01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:29,560\nnot as an opportunity to create failure,\nwhich is often how it is spoken about, or\n\n1309\n01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,150\nperhaps implemented, and\nseen in the business as being negative.\n\n1310\n01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:34,660\nBut change is an opportunity.\n\n1311\n01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:38,360\nWhether it's negative, or positive is\nup to the individual that executes on\n\n1312\n01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,470\nthe change documents, and manages it.\n\n1313\n01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,820\nAnd the approach you bring to change\nmanagement is the difference between\n\n1314\n01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:48,200\nthe success, the change being\nimplemented in a successful way, or\n\n1315\n01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,400\nthe change being implemented negatively,\nand impacting the organization.\n\n1316\n01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,020\nSo as security practitioners,\nyou need to understand change.\n\n1317\n01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:59,178\nYou need to understand how to identify\nchange, how to document change,\n\n1318\n01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:03,881\nhow to manage change, and how to work the\norganization through a change lifecycle\n\n1319\n01:12:03,881 --> 01:12:07,246\nthat helps the organization\nto come to grips with change.\n\n1320\n01:12:07,246 --> 01:12:11,232\nIf you're not able to do those things,\nyou're not effectively executing on your\n\n1321\n01:12:11,232 --> 01:12:14,656\nresponsibilities And there's training for\nthis out there, right.\n\n1322\n01:12:14,656 --> 01:12:16,013\nYou can understand these frameworks.\n\n1323\n01:12:16,013 --> 01:12:19,966\nYou can be better trained and better\narmed, given better tools to manage them,\n\n1324\n01:12:19,966 --> 01:12:22,800\nbut at the end of the day,\nit's like anything else.\n\n1325\n01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,260\nIf you don't practice it regularly it\nbecomes something that's an afterthought\n\n1326\n01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,630\nand you can't do change\nmanagement after the fact.\n\n1327\n01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:33,890\nThat's where we fail because\nif we try to manage change\n\n1328\n01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:36,540\nafter we implement the system,\nit's too late.\n\n1329\n01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,450\nRight?\nWe're\n\n1330\n01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:39,940\neffectively doing\nsomething in reverse order.\n\n1331\n01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:43,340\nI often think of this, and\nI did this when I was in college,\n\n1332\n01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:44,436\nI admit I am guilty, right?\n\n1333\n01:12:44,436 --> 01:12:48,730\n[LAUGH] So we've probably all done this,\nbut I remember one time in particular,\n\n1334\n01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:49,390\nwhen I had gone,\n\n1335\n01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:52,140\nstarted going to college, I was living\non my own at that point, right?\n\n1336\n01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,350\nSo had all the freedom\nto do whatever I wanted.\n\n1337\n01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:57,020\nAnd I got really hungry one night, and\n\n1338\n01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:58,706\nI said you know it's a great\ntime to go food shopping.\n\n1339\n01:12:58,706 --> 01:13:02,700\nI'm hungry, want to go out, get some food,\nso I went and did my grocery shopping,\n\n1340\n01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:06,390\nblew my budget for the month, bought all\nthis stuff that I didn't need didn't want.\n\n1341\n01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,480\nI would normally never have acquired, but\n\n1342\n01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,820\nbecause I didn't have a good change\nmanagement process in place, right?\n\n1343\n01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,550\nI didn't have a good understanding of the\nfact that the change in status from not\n\n1344\n01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:19,300\nbeing hungry to being hungry would\nindicate an overrun in my budget.\n\n1345\n01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,050\nThat I went ahead and did it anyway.\n\n1346\n01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:25,130\nNow it's kind of a silly and half in a way\nof thinking about change management.\n\n1347\n01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:27,730\nWhat I'm trying to illustrate for\nyou is the following.\n\n1348\n01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:30,641\nAnything you think of that\nyou do to touch a system,\n\n1349\n01:13:30,641 --> 01:13:35,314\nto change it's status in any way, shape or\nform is an indicative of something that\n\n1350\n01:13:35,314 --> 01:13:38,545\nhas to be managed with a change\nmanagement philosophy.\n\n1351\n01:13:38,545 --> 01:13:41,165\n>> I've worked in both environments.\n\n1352\n01:13:41,165 --> 01:13:43,765\nEnvironments that had change management\nand environments that didn't.\n\n1353\n01:13:43,765 --> 01:13:47,945\nAnd let me tell you in the world where you\ndo not have change management it's tough.\n\n1354\n01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:49,305\n>> It is.\n>> The story I tell,\n\n1355\n01:13:49,305 --> 01:13:51,145\nI know I've told it in\nsome other episode but\n\n1356\n01:13:51,145 --> 01:13:54,855\nI used to work with a guy who was\nbrilliant, and whenever he went on\n\n1357\n01:13:54,855 --> 01:13:59,365\nvacation, the week before he would always\ndouble up the amount of work that he did.\n\n1358\n01:13:59,365 --> 01:14:02,550\nAnd he would implement all\nsorts of things in the system.\n\n1359\n01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:04,140\nAnd then leave on vacation.\n\n1360\n01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,070\nAnd so you'd come in on Monday and\nall hell would break loose.\n\n1361\n01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:09,510\nAnd you were just running around\ntrying to figure out what went wrong,\n\n1362\n01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:12,280\nwhat changed, and how to put it back.\n\n1363\n01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,960\nVersus an environment where\nyou have change management.\n\n1364\n01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,170\nIf something goes wrong you just pull\nthe change tickets from the previous day.\n\n1365\n01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:22,540\nAnd you say Art, what changed\nyesterday that's not working today?\n\n1366\n01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:26,570\nAnd a good change management process will\ndictate a number of different things.\n\n1367\n01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:29,050\nYou'll have a change request\nthat you fill out, and\n\n1368\n01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:33,580\nthen you submit that to a change advisory\nboard, or whatever it is that you call it,\n\n1369\n01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,240\nthere's different names\nthat are out there.\n\n1370\n01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,430\nBut it'll usually have\na couple of components in it\n\n1371\n01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,950\nthat are really important.\n\n1372\n01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:47,120\nSo what is the change, the business\ncase or justification for the change.\n\n1373\n01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,360\nYou know why are doing it?\n\n1374\n01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,650\nAre you doing it just for the heck of it?\n\n1375\n01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:53,470\nOr let's see if I can spell justification.\n\n1376\n01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:54,130\nThere we go.\n\n1377\n01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,860\nSo what is the purpose for this change?\n\n1378\n01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,630\nWhat does it solve?\n\n1379\n01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,481\nSo exactly what change are you making?\n\n1380\n01:15:01,906 --> 01:15:04,170\nWhat security review it has had.\n\n1381\n01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:10,310\nWhat is the back out plan, right?\n\n1382\n01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:11,740\nThis is probably the most important part,\n\n1383\n01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:15,880\nwhich is if things go wrong how do you\nundo the change that you're making, right.\n\n1384\n01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:19,440\nAnd it's up to you and your organization\nwhat elements you incorporate into your\n\n1385\n01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,050\nchange ticket system but\nby having a good system like this,\n\n1386\n01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:26,240\nprior to making a change, you insure\nthe people have really thought it out.\n\n1387\n01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,880\nThey thought out what they're about to do,\nwhy they're doing it, and\n\n1388\n01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,770\nthey're ready to explain\nit in this ticket.\n\n1389\n01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:34,465\nYour change advisory board can review and\neither approve or decline a ticket.\n\n1390\n01:15:34,465 --> 01:15:37,895\nAnd if it's approved, the change gets\nimplemented and then if there is\n\n1391\n01:15:37,895 --> 01:15:41,775\na problem, we can roll back pretty easily,\nwe get that protection in place.\n\n1392\n01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:45,875\nBut we ensure the changes aren't made to\nthe system without going through a review.\n\n1393\n01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,825\nAnd that's really important because\nyou might have an excellent\n\n1394\n01:15:48,825 --> 01:15:50,615\nsecurity policy in place.\n\n1395\n01:15:50,615 --> 01:15:53,175\nAnd you might have\ndeployed a new web server.\n\n1396\n01:15:53,175 --> 01:15:56,390\nAnd it was hardened and\nsecured properly on day one.\n\n1397\n01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:00,120\nBut somebody changes it on day 273 and\nnow it's not secure anymore but\n\n1398\n01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:05,090\nit would have failed a review if there was\na change ticket performed so that's how\n\n1399\n01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:08,505\nwe kind of ensure that we live up to\nthe standards and policies that we choose.\n\n1400\n01:16:08,505 --> 01:16:09,735\nChoose to follow.\n\n1401\n01:16:09,735 --> 01:16:12,985\n>> And to build on that thought\nprocess in that business case, right?\n\n1402\n01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:18,665\nSo what happens if on day 274,\nbecause you had it on 273, make a change.\n\n1403\n01:16:18,665 --> 01:16:21,305\nThat the person that made\nthe change leaves the company,\n\n1404\n01:16:21,305 --> 01:16:24,395\nand we don't document and\ncapture that change.\n\n1405\n01:16:24,395 --> 01:16:26,940\nSo then on day 512, right?\n\n1406\n01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:30,350\nWhen we have a zero-day exploit or\nsome sort of security breach that occurs\n\n1407\n01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:35,440\nagainst that web interface,\nwe are lost and we don't really understand\n\n1408\n01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,260\nhow we went from a system that in theory\nwas not going to be compromised to one\n\n1409\n01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:44,090\nthat was because that missing piece\nin the middle which was the change,\n\n1410\n01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:48,080\nthe slight of hand that that magician\ncrafted in our system and then walked away\n\n1411\n01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:53,280\nfrom with no clear understanding and\ndocumentation left us open to attack.\n\n1412\n01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,630\nAnd this is what I see time and\nagain when I deal with companies and\n\n1413\n01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:58,860\nI deal with customers in these areas.\n\n1414\n01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:03,370\nWhich is, we're called in after the fact\neither to do a forensic analysis of\n\n1415\n01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:09,430\nan attack vector and or we're called in\nto help them understand what went wrong.\n\n1416\n01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:11,000\nAnd how they can benefit from this.\n\n1417\n01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,600\nWe call this a lessons learned or\n\n1418\n01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,630\na post mortem event after the fact where\nyou go back at post implementation review,\n\n1419\n01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:19,870\na PIR, it's got different names\nin Project Management and\n\n1420\n01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:22,080\ndifferent frameworks will\nrefer to it differently but\n\n1421\n01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,720\nat the end of the day it's about root\ncause analysis, it's about asking the why.\n\n1422\n01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:30,640\nIf you go back and look what you often\nfind is that the lack of documentation,\n\n1423\n01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,470\nthe lack of awareness of change and\n\n1424\n01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:36,190\nmore broadly the lack of awareness\naround security best practices.\n\n1425\n01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:39,350\nWe often keep talking\nabout I in particular as\n\n1426\n01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:42,900\nin our conversations with you keep\ntalking about security awareness and\n\n1427\n01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:46,000\nusing commonsense and\nbringing that to the masses.\n\n1428\n01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,110\nIt's about training, it's about awareness,\n\n1429\n01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:51,980\nit's about documentation of events\nthat can't just live in your head.\n\n1430\n01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,780\nYou know what you did, we get that.\n\n1431\n01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:57,580\nBut the problem is, if you're not\naround when it comes back around and\n\n1432\n01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,060\nit comes home to roost,\n\n1433\n01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,000\nthe people that are managing it at\nthat point are going to be unaware.\n\n1434\n01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,460\nAnd that's what ultimately\ngets us in trouble.\n\n1435\n01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,330\nSo you've heard us preach to the choir.\n\n1436\n01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,530\nWe don't have to beat\nthe dead horse anymore.\n\n1437\n01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:12,990\nManage change, manage it effectively,\nmanage it efficiently but most\n\n1438\n01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:18,390\nimportantly, sing the praises of change\nfrom the rooftops in your organization.\n\n1439\n01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:21,710\nMake sure the organization\nhas a methodology and\n\n1440\n01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,960\nan awareness that acknowledges change.\n\n1441\n01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,110\nEmbraces the documentation of it and\n\n1442\n01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:30,720\nallows you to then proactively manage\norganizational change in a way that\n\n1443\n01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:35,580\ncreates security as opposed to devalues\nsecurity in the mind of the organization.\n\n1444\n01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:36,760\nVery important.\n\n1445\n01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,480\nHaving said that let's talk about what\na formal change control procedure\n\n1446\n01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,410\nmay look like.\n\n1447\n01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:42,770\nA lot of us struggle with this, right?\n\n1448\n01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:46,120\nWe know the value of change,\nwe understand the ideas behind it.\n\n1449\n01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,750\nBut we may not really be aware of\nthe steps involved in making sure we\n\n1450\n01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,610\ndocument it.\n\n1451\n01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,890\nSo, let's make sure we get what those are.\n\n1452\n01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:52,970\nLet's write them down.\n\n1453\n01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:56,010\nLet's make sure we know what they are,\nand let's make sure that you,\n\n1454\n01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:58,280\nas practitioners,\nare comfortable with this, right?\n\n1455\n01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,378\nSo the change control procedures\nlook something like this.\n\n1456\n01:19:01,378 --> 01:19:06,250\nWe're going to start with a change\nrequest, and Don was kind enough to detail\n\n1457\n01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:10,260\nout just prior on the list, this idea of\nchange tickets and what they are, and\n\n1458\n01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:11,480\nmaking sure we know what they are.\n\n1459\n01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,690\nSo change request, very important.\n\n1460\n01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:18,450\nBy the way, we call this an RFC, a request\nfor change in change management speak,\n\n1461\n01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:22,270\nnot the same as the RFC that\nsignifies the standards for\n\n1462\n01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:24,100\nan engineered solution in networking.\n\n1463\n01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,060\nI want to differentiate that.\n\n1464\n01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,450\nBut the idea is that the acronym\nis called the request for\n\n1465\n01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:30,230\nchange in change management.\n\n1466\n01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:31,520\nImpact assessment right?\n\n1467\n01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,880\nSo when we talk about impact assessment,\n\n1468\n01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,310\nwe're talking about this\nidea of understanding.\n\n1469\n01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:41,060\nAs Don walked through when\nthe ticket process up above,\n\n1470\n01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,790\nexactly what the change and\nthe impact will be.\n\n1471\n01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:45,110\nImpact assessment.\n\n1472\n01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:47,940\nWe talk about approval of change.\n\n1473\n01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:52,240\nSomebody, whether it is a CAB, as you\npointed out, Don, a Change Advisory Board,\n\n1474\n01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:56,410\nor whatever that formal or informal,\nsometimes called an IT Steering Committee,\n\n1475\n01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:58,900\nright, there's different names we find for\nit.\n\n1476\n01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,830\nITIL happens to call it,\nidentify it, as a CAB.\n\n1477\n01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:04,455\nBut an IT Steering Committee,\nthings like that.\n\n1478\n01:20:04,455 --> 01:20:06,293\n[LAUGH] Steering Committee, right?\n\n1479\n01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:07,860\nThird times a charm there, right?\n\n1480\n01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:10,033\nIT Steering Committee,\nwhatever it is, right?\n\n1481\n01:20:10,033 --> 01:20:14,677\nThe idea is that It is gonna be\nthe body that accepts the change and\n\n1482\n01:20:14,677 --> 01:20:19,330\nit is going to allow it to take\nplace inside of the organization.\n\n1483\n01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:20,330\nThat's close enough, right?\n\n1484\n01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:21,110\n>> That'll work.\n\n1485\n01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:22,170\n>> So approval of change.\n\n1486\n01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:23,830\nWe then have build and test, right?\n\n1487\n01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:27,960\nWe go out and we actually implement\nthe change, do a test cycle on it,\n\n1488\n01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,480\nmake sure we understand what it is and\nhow to evaluate it.\n\n1489\n01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,870\nAnd out of build and change,\nwe're gonna have this idea of monitoring.\n\n1490\n01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:37,050\nIt's almost a sub-point under build and\nchange.\n\n1491\n01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:42,150\nBecause monitoring, during the build and\nchange cycle allows us to go back and look\n\n1492\n01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:46,680\nat all of the things that are taking place\nprior to and as part of that process.\n\n1493\n01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,710\nAnd if we see that there is perhaps\na misalignment we're gonna feed back into\n\n1494\n01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:55,920\nour change request at the top, re-evaluate\nthat change, and somehow make that.\n\n1495\n01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,980\nAdjustment in the cycle to then\ngo back through and cycle back.\n\n1496\n01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:02,870\nBefore we get to the final stage,\nwhich is implement the change.\n\n1497\n01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:06,050\nAnd so implementing the change involves\nactually putting it into production.\n\n1498\n01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:08,690\nCall it going live, right,\nturning the change on, and\n\n1499\n01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:11,930\nthen as Don rightly pointed out, and\nvery, very important, to say this,\n\n1500\n01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:16,650\nwe have our backup plan, what we call\na rollback plan in the changed management\n\n1501\n01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:19,490\nnomenclature, specifically\na rollback plan or\n\n1502\n01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:23,390\na roll-out plan is gonna be the plan\nthat allows us to effectively.\n\n1503\n01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:27,470\nMove that change through a process\nof restoring back to normal if for\n\n1504\n01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:31,620\nsome reason that change were not to take\neffect properly, whatever that may be.\n\n1505\n01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,800\nWanna make sure we understand that and\nare aware of that.\n\n1506\n01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,930\nReally, peer review of change and\nthe change advisory board, very important.\n\n1507\n01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:41,840\nHaving our backup plans,\nhaving our documentation.\n\n1508\n01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,980\nAll these things are gonna be very\nimportant to us as we think about change.\n\n1509\n01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:49,430\nAnd change really rolls into this\nidea of configuration management.\n\n1510\n01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:54,035\nAnd this idea of understanding that it's\nvery important to document change, but\n\n1511\n01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:58,839\nwhere we go to document that is typically\nwhat's known as a configuration management\n\n1512\n01:21:58,839 --> 01:22:02,396\ndatabase or some sort of\nconfiguration management solution.\n\n1513\n01:22:02,396 --> 01:22:07,167\nMeaning wherever we have documented the\nactual build information around the system\n\n1514\n01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:11,870\nthat are monitoring and changing we\nhave to update that documentation.\n\n1515\n01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:14,580\nTypically it's in our\nConfiguration Management Database.\n\n1516\n01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:18,560\nWe talk about updating what are know\nas CIs or Configuration Items.\n\n1517\n01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,360\nAgain, this is language you often\nhere refer to in the IT framework or\n\n1518\n01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:25,240\nin generic project management discussions,\n\n1519\n01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,670\nwhere we update items that are part\nof the configuration of a system.\n\n1520\n01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:31,490\nBut we want to update those things\nto make sure we understand.\n\n1521\n01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:35,020\nThat where we go from Windows XP\non our desktop hypothetically.\n\n1522\n01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,120\nRight?\nIt's that time of the year right.\n\n1523\n01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,290\nFrom Windows XP over to perhaps\nWindows 7 or Windows 8 or\n\n1524\n01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:42,270\nwhatever comes later down the road.\n\n1525\n01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:46,590\nIf we don't update our build book or run\nbooks and all of our system documentation.\n\n1526\n01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:50,230\nTo reflect that that is now our new\nstandard, then we're gonna be looking back\n\n1527\n01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:52,960\nin a couple of years thinking wow,\nwe're still running Windows XP.\n\n1528\n01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,990\nAnd we'll get into disaster recovery and\nbusiness continuity planning at some point\n\n1529\n01:22:56,990 --> 01:23:00,330\nin our discussions in a while, but\nthis idea of then impacting that and\n\n1530\n01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:04,010\nseeing that effect roll through the\norganization, can be catastrophic if we go\n\n1531\n01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:06,570\nto restore systems and\nuse the wrong operating system and\n\n1532\n01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:09,660\nas a result wipe out our ability\nto manage in the process.\n\n1533\n01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,120\nSo making sure we understand that,\n\n1534\n01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,940\nand we have to control at all\nlevels of the organization, right.\n\n1535\n01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,750\nIt's not just about the strategic,\nnot just about the tactical,\n\n1536\n01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,000\nit's also about the operational.\n\n1537\n01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,910\nThese are the three key levels\nthat we think of in the business\n\n1538\n01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,060\nas we look at change.\n\n1539\n01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,270\nStrategic, tactical, and operational.\n\n1540\n01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:29,400\nAnd down at the operational level,\nwe take a look at systems, and\n\n1541\n01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:33,070\nwe take a look at hardware,\nsoftware certainly, but firmware,\n\n1542\n01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:36,650\nyou mentioned when we talked about\nfirewalls and getting rid of firewalls,\n\n1543\n01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:40,160\nand evaluating whether we can\nmove the information in them.\n\n1544\n01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,540\nThat billed information,\nthat running config,\n\n1545\n01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,600\ncould be stored in a ROM chip somewhere.\n\n1546\n01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,900\nIt could be in the firmware, and\nwe don't know what that is, and\n\n1547\n01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,360\nwe have to make sure we're aware of that.\n\n1548\n01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,740\nOur documentation and\n\n1549\n01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:54,860\nour test plans, all those things have to\nevaluated and put under changed control.\n\n1550\n01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:58,660\nAnd so throughout the entire life-cycle\nwe talk about a system life-cycle,\n\n1551\n01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,430\na system development life-cycle.\n\n1552\n01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:02,450\nWe also talk about a change life-cycle.\n\n1553\n01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:05,430\nAnd managing change\nthrough the organization\n\n1554\n01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:07,200\nbecomes very important as well.\n\n1555\n01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,900\nAcross your hardware as well\nas your software inventory,\n\n1556\n01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,250\nif you wanna think of it that way.\n\n1557\n01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,890\nJust to make sure that we understand.\n\n1558\n01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:15,810\nWhat that is we also probably want\nto talk about patch management\n\n1559\n01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:18,290\nbriefly in relation to configuration and\nchange.\n\n1560\n01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:22,050\nHow do you deal with updating the software\nin a system, to make sure the patch\n\n1561\n01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:26,640\nmanagement is gonna allow us to update\na system, implement the necessary\n\n1562\n01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:31,400\nsecurity changes but as a result document\nwhat those changes are in our baselines.\n\n1563\n01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,690\nAnd our bill doc imitation for\nour systems, and if you don't have a good\n\n1564\n01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:39,330\nprocess for that in hand, then that's\nsomething that needs to be addressed.\n\n1565\n01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:42,030\nAgain there's documentation out\nthere to help you with that.\n\n1566\n01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:44,330\nYou need policies as well as procedures.\n\n1567\n01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:46,260\nYou need to understand\nhow to build baselines.\n\n1568\n01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,920\nThis may impact desktop imaging,\nfor instance, right?\n\n1569\n01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,740\nVirtualization.\n\n1570\n01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:53,670\nAll sorts of areas can be\nimpacted by this concept.\n\n1571\n01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:55,000\nWe wanna make sure that\nwe're aware of that and\n\n1572\n01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,690\nwe understand those things,\nand really think about\n\n1573\n01:24:57,690 --> 01:25:01,140\ndistributing that information out to\nthe organization in a timely fashion.\n\n1574\n01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,460\n>> I know I've been burned on this one,\n\n1575\n01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:05,600\nwhere we had disaster recovery\ndocumentation specifically for\n\n1576\n01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,800\nhow to rebuild a,\nthis one was an SSL VPN appliance.\n\n1577\n01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,280\nBut in the meantime,\n\n1578\n01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,950\na firmware update had been applied\nthat changed a lot of the menus.\n\n1579\n01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:17,020\nThe menus were now different and\n\n1580\n01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:19,770\nthe disaster recovery\ndocumentation wasn't updated.\n\n1581\n01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:22,710\nWhen we did DR test,\nfortunately it was during a test,\n\n1582\n01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:25,730\nwe couldn't follow the original\nsteps in the documentation so\n\n1583\n01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:29,060\nthey had done a change ticket that\napproved this new firmware update,\n\n1584\n01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:32,240\nthat showed that it worked with the\nsystems and everything would be fine, but\n\n1585\n01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,970\nthey didn't do the follow up which\nwas to update the DR documentation.\n\n1586\n01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:37,760\nAnd so\nthat's got to be a part of that, and\n\n1587\n01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,390\nthat's what patch management lets us do.\n\n1588\n01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:42,620\nIs ensure that all of these other\npieces are taken into account when\n\n1589\n01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,050\nan update is pushed in.\n\n1590\n01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:47,470\n>> Absolutely, so we wanna make\nsure as we wrap up this segment and\n\n1591\n01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:49,380\nwe really wrap up this conversation,\n\n1592\n01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:52,650\nthat we understand the value that\nchange brings to the organization.\n\n1593\n01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:55,190\nIt's an opportunity,\nto make sure we get it right.\n\n1594\n01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:58,180\nAnd we have to look at it in that light\nand really then manage it accordingly.\n\n1595\n01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,490\nRight?\nIt's very important.\n\n1596\n01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,880\nI want to leave you with that thought.\n\n1597\n01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,830\nMake sure we're thinking about change\nthat way, we're gonna come back and\n\n1598\n01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:06,280\ntalk about a few other areas and\na few other items here\n\n1599\n01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:10,600\njust to wrap up this entire section and\nreally put it to bed the proper way.\n\n1600\n01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,760\nTalk about awareness a little more and\nmake sure you guys are feeling comfortable\n\n1601\n01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,560\nwith how to disseminate that information\nbroadly in the organization.\n\n1602\n01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,870\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nlet's stop here and take a break.\n\n1603\n01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:23,030\nWhen we get back, we've got some little\nnuts and bolts, just some last little bits\n\n1604\n01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:25,340\nto get through on this one\nbefore we wrap up for the show.\n\n1605\n01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,770\nI hope you guys are enjoying it so far.\n\n1606\n01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:28,620\nStay tuned and we'll be back after this.\n\n1607\n01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:29,697\n>> See you soon.\n\n1608\n01:26:29,697 --> 01:26:38,589\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1609\n01:26:38,589 --> 01:26:42,506\nSo now we're gonna jump into our final\nsegment of this episode as we start to\n\n1610\n01:26:42,506 --> 01:26:46,051\nwrap up some of the general concepts\naround security operations and\n\n1611\n01:26:46,051 --> 01:26:47,700\nadministration.\n\n1612\n01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,500\nAdam, let's see,\nwhat are we jumping into next?\n\n1613\n01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:53,010\n>> We just wanna circle back to the idea\nof security awareness quickly, right?\n\n1614\n01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:56,970\nAnd make sure that everybody is,\npun intended definitely on this one,\n\n1615\n01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:59,810\naware of how important security is, right?\n\n1616\n01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:03,200\nWe talked about this in some of our\nprior discussions, the idea of security\n\n1617\n01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:07,140\nawareness training, the idea that\na security professional really needs to be\n\n1618\n01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:11,930\nfocused on spreading the good word, right,\nspreading the gospel of security among-st\n\n1619\n01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:16,280\nall of the employees, all of the people\nthat work in the organization.\n\n1620\n01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,970\nAnd that operates at different levels,\nright?\n\n1621\n01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:20,150\nWhen you're dealing with\nmore senior managers,\n\n1622\n01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:24,500\nthis idea of awareness is couched more in\nterms of strategic business objectives.\n\n1623\n01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:28,050\nWhen you're dealing with\nfront-line information workers,\n\n1624\n01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:32,940\nin the trenches every day on PCs, plowing\nthrough spreadsheets, things like that.\n\n1625\n01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,750\nIt's really couched more\nin terms of dos and\n\n1626\n01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,610\ndon'ts around specific\nthings they're encountering.\n\n1627\n01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:40,430\nSomebody that's gonna be\nworking on financial data,\n\n1628\n01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:42,350\nhas to be given awareness\nof the importance and\n\n1629\n01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:46,080\nthe context of that, in relation\nto security for the organization.\n\n1630\n01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:50,210\nBut somebody in charge needs a very\nbroad understanding of privacy and\n\n1631\n01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:52,890\nthe impact of security and\nmanagement of information.\n\n1632\n01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:54,612\nIn relation to multiple roles,\n\n1633\n01:27:54,612 --> 01:27:57,874\nin the organization because of\nthe information they touch.\n\n1634\n01:27:57,874 --> 01:28:01,132\nAnd so role awareness,\nsecurity awareness in relation to that,\n\n1635\n01:28:01,132 --> 01:28:04,986\nthis idea of just understanding the\nsensitivity of information is something\n\n1636\n01:28:04,986 --> 01:28:07,788\nwe wanna stress and\nmake sure you're aware of, right?\n\n1637\n01:28:07,788 --> 01:28:09,507\nAnd this happens in many different ways.\n\n1638\n01:28:09,507 --> 01:28:13,441\nIt could be something as simple as\nsomebody bringing in a mobile device, and\n\n1639\n01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:16,890\nwanted to be able to connect it\nup to the corporate network.\n\n1640\n01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:19,860\nHow do we do that, what is the policy,\nwhat is the procedure, and\n\n1641\n01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,805\nas a result, a result,\nwhat is the end game?\n\n1642\n01:28:21,805 --> 01:28:23,535\nHow do we measure success,\n\n1643\n01:28:23,535 --> 01:28:27,155\nof that organizational objective\nof enabling that remote worker.\n\n1644\n01:28:27,155 --> 01:28:30,085\nAll these things are part of what\ngoes into an awareness campaign.\n\n1645\n01:28:30,085 --> 01:28:30,595\nRight?\nSo\n\n1646\n01:28:30,595 --> 01:28:33,362\nbe aware of that promote\nsecurity monitor compliance, but\n\n1647\n01:28:33,362 --> 01:28:37,192\nalso think about the ways in which you\ncommunicate to disseminate information.\n\n1648\n01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:41,052\nIs it approachable to the individual\naudience, is it contextually relevant?\n\n1649\n01:28:41,052 --> 01:28:44,742\nAnd if it's not, what can you do\ndifferently to get that information out\n\n1650\n01:28:44,742 --> 01:28:47,112\nthere in a way that they can consume it?\n\n1651\n01:28:47,112 --> 01:28:50,400\nAnd check for relevancy and\nunderstanding along the way.\n\n1652\n01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,525\n>> And\njust remember that at the end of the day,\n\n1653\n01:28:52,525 --> 01:28:56,697\nit's typically your end users that are the\nweakest link in your security structure.\n\n1654\n01:28:56,697 --> 01:28:58,780\nEven if you are doing 100% of your job,\n\n1655\n01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:03,550\nyou're not necessarily able to guaranteed\nthat your employees are doing the same.\n\n1656\n01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:07,080\nMaking sure that everyone understands\nwhat part it is they play in\n\n1657\n01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,900\ncreating security for the organization.\n\n1658\n01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,240\n>> Very, very important and\n\n1659\n01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:14,100\nthe next topic on our, little hit\nlist in terms of just items there.\n\n1660\n01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,910\nSocial engineering really\nplays into this idea because\n\n1661\n01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:19,270\na good security awareness\ntraining program.\n\n1662\n01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:20,650\nDissemination of information.\n\n1663\n01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:22,930\nMaking people aware of their surroundings.\n\n1664\n01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:26,680\nThis idea of situational awareness we\noften hear about in the military and\n\n1665\n01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:27,960\nthings of that nature.\n\n1666\n01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:32,320\nIs really a focal point when we talk about\nsomething like social engineering because\n\n1667\n01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,510\nif somebody as an end user\nis gonna be approached by\n\n1668\n01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:39,530\na would be hacker somebody\nwho's looking to do harm.\n\n1669\n01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:42,890\nThey're gonna be approached\ntypically in some sort of a social\n\n1670\n01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:44,680\nengineering construct.\n\n1671\n01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,560\nSomebody's maybe not\ngonna walk right up and\n\n1672\n01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,580\ntry to steal the information\noff their machine physically.\n\n1673\n01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:53,600\nThey're gonna do it through manipulation\nof information gathering techniques and\n\n1674\n01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,990\nmanipulation of information that's\navailable in the environment, we'll call\n\n1675\n01:29:56,990 --> 01:30:02,400\nin the wild, and as result of that,\nthat person, that target, as we refer\n\n1676\n01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:07,440\nto them in social engineering construct\nis going to be potentially vulnerable.\n\n1677\n01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,180\nAnd if they're not aware of the fact that\nthese attacks could potentially exist,\n\n1678\n01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:15,150\nif they're not aware of the fact that\nas a result of this particular kind of\n\n1679\n01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:20,060\ninformation being available to them, that\nthey may be a targeted person of interest.\n\n1680\n01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:23,190\nThey may actually put\nthemselves at more risk\n\n1681\n01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:25,790\nbecause of the lack of\nknowledge that they have.\n\n1682\n01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:29,200\nAround what's going on,\nvis-a-vis the information they manage,\n\n1683\n01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,960\nthe role they have in the organization.\n\n1684\n01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:36,100\nYet we think and hear about these\nterms like vishing which is voip or\n\n1685\n01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,960\nVoice Over or\nV-O-I-P technology related phishing.\n\n1686\n01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:39,560\nPhishing.\n\n1687\n01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:45,130\nPhishing generically is this idea of going\nafter information, so phishing with a ph.\n\n1688\n01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:49,230\nVishing is the V for voit, so\nthat's voice over IP phishing.\n\n1689\n01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:50,910\nBut the idea is there's vishing out there,\n\n1690\n01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:54,600\nthere is just generically phishing,\nwe hear about that more often than not.\n\n1691\n01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:58,180\nThere is whaling,\nwhich is this idea of going after really\n\n1692\n01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:01,600\nhigh profile sea level\ntargets in an organization.\n\n1693\n01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,320\nThere are all\n\n1694\n01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,820\nsorts of attack vectors that can be used\nwhen it comes to social engineering.\n\n1695\n01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,690\nThings like shoulder surfing,\n\n1696\n01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:14,120\nwhich is just this idea of\nthe old school way of doing it,\n\n1697\n01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:17,390\nwhere you just looked over somebody's\nshoulder while they were typing something.\n\n1698\n01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:20,530\nImagine I'm standing over\nhere watching Don type, and\n\n1699\n01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:24,840\ninstead of being able to talk to you, and\nlook at what's coming up as he's typing,\n\n1700\n01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,750\nI was standing off to the side and\nmaybe trying to see what's going on on his\n\n1701\n01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:30,800\nscreen without his knowledge,\nthat'd be shoulder surfing.\n\n1702\n01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,400\nWe might try to steal or\nreverse engineer passwords\n\n1703\n01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:38,240\nthrough a social engineering experiment,\nthat involved impersonating somebody.\n\n1704\n01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:42,330\nSo we would call up and potentially\npretend to be somebody from a help desk,\n\n1705\n01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:47,490\nor send some sort of an email to somebody\nwith some sort of a scam involved in it.\n\n1706\n01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:51,960\nWhere we ask them to validate an account\ninformation, ID of some kind,\n\n1707\n01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:52,480\nor something.\n\n1708\n01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,260\nA banking scam or whatever that may be.\n\n1709\n01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:00,210\nAll of these are episodic ideas that occur\naround social engineering, depending on\n\n1710\n01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:04,490\nthe time of the year, what's going on,\nwhat we're looking to accomplish.\n\n1711\n01:32:04,490 --> 01:32:08,430\nBut awareness of these kinds\nof activities is crucial, for\n\n1712\n01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:11,370\nyour end users to be successful\nprotecting themselves, right?\n\n1713\n01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:13,050\nThey don't wanna get that email,\n\n1714\n01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:17,380\nclick on that embedded link that says\noh go here to validate your password or\n\n1715\n01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:20,650\nreset it, because if they're aware of the\nfact that we don't typically do password\n\n1716\n01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:23,940\nresets by email, they're more\nlike to report that as fraud, and\n\n1717\n01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:27,880\nas a result potentially stop somebody\nfrom gaining access to that information.\n\n1718\n01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:28,590\nRight.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1719\n01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:29,960\nAnd these attacks are very powerful,\n\n1720\n01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,790\nthey're very prevalent,\nthey're very easy for people to fall to.\n\n1721\n01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:37,570\nEven ones that are really well known,\nlike what's the Nigerian email scam?\n\n1722\n01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,290\nThe 508's or whatever they call them?\n\n1723\n01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:40,230\n>> The banking scam, sure.\n\n1724\n01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:41,239\n>> Where, yep.\n>> Where they've got that account\n\n1725\n01:32:41,239 --> 01:32:42,069\ninformation they want to get from you.\n\n1726\n01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:44,104\n>> Yeah, the Nigerian princess died and\n\n1727\n01:32:44,104 --> 01:32:48,310\nthey've got 16 million in an account\nif they can just transfer through you.\n\n1728\n01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:51,390\nAnd they build this story,\nthis background.\n\n1729\n01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:56,350\nAnd we hear about it as IT guys, as people\nin security field, and we laugh about it.\n\n1730\n01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:59,900\nBut people fall for it every day, because\nthey're just not educated about it.\n\n1731\n01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,208\nThey don't know that people\nare out there preying on.\n\n1732\n01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:03,535\nIgnorance or something.\n\n1733\n01:33:03,535 --> 01:33:07,420\n>> And what I often tell my students and\nI tell my customers to think about\n\n1734\n01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:12,100\nin relation to this, come up with\nan average profile in your mind, right?\n\n1735\n01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:16,810\nCreate that prototypical user, and then\nput yourself in the mind of that user and\n\n1736\n01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:19,820\nunderstand the level they approach\nthis kind of a scenario as.\n\n1737\n01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:24,290\nDo I often think of it as saying,\nwould my parent, would my grandmother,\n\n1738\n01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:28,690\nmy grandfather, somebody who is\nnot probably very well versed and\n\n1739\n01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:32,270\nvery well educated in\nthe technology of the day.\n\n1740\n01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:36,330\nAnd perhaps not very good with the\ncontext, with the use of that technology.\n\n1741\n01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:38,360\nWould they understand\nthis as being a scam,\n\n1742\n01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,700\nsomething that is potentially problematic?\n\n1743\n01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:42,270\nAnd if the answer is probably not,\n\n1744\n01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:47,270\nI haven't done my job in terms of crafting\nan education program that speaks to my\n\n1745\n01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:50,810\nmedian or\nmy average user inside of my organization.\n\n1746\n01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:55,330\nIf I can assure myself that somebody\nlike that would get the message,\n\n1747\n01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:58,160\nI probably have done a good job\nas a security practitioner.\n\n1748\n01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:02,520\nI may have overcompensated, I may have\ngiven them a very low threshold of entry\n\n1749\n01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,390\nin terms of assuming almost no knowledge.\n\n1750\n01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:07,730\nBut it's better to assume almost\nno knowledge in context, and\n\n1751\n01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:11,760\ntrain to that level, as a result to bring\neverybody up to that standard that you\n\n1752\n01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,500\nwant, then to assume a high entry point\nfor knowledge and then maybe leave things\n\n1753\n01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,690\nout of the training that\nultimately would be important.\n\n1754\n01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:20,460\nBut may be so obvious to you,\nbut as we said,\n\n1755\n01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,090\nnot obvious to the average individual.\n\n1756\n01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:25,630\nAnd that's the challenge we really have to\nmanage through when we deal with things\n\n1757\n01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:29,490\nlike security awareness and\nlink it to social engineering.\n\n1758\n01:34:29,490 --> 01:34:33,710\nAnd try to build a construct that educates\nbut also informs at the same time and\n\n1759\n01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:36,510\ncreates that context that we really need,\nright.\n\n1760\n01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:39,800\nIt's that responsibility and\npart of that responsibility we have,\n\n1761\n01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:43,180\nif you remember our conversations\nas we started this particular\n\n1762\n01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:46,530\nsession talking about operational\nsecurity and awareness and\n\n1763\n01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:49,890\nadministration of it, is this idea of\nthe code of ethics that we spoke about.\n\n1764\n01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:53,970\nAnd circling back to that and\nreally understanding that do no harm, and\n\n1765\n01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:58,305\nmaking sure we act honorably and protect\nthe integrity of the profession and\n\n1766\n01:34:58,305 --> 01:35:01,405\nreally try to do good and\nspread that awareness.\n\n1767\n01:35:01,405 --> 01:35:04,715\nIt's all part of the code of ethics that\nwe uphold as security practitioners,\n\n1768\n01:35:04,715 --> 01:35:07,305\nand this is a very central and\nimportant point of that.\n\n1769\n01:35:09,065 --> 01:35:12,565\nAll right, so as we continue talking,\nthen, let's talk a little bit about\n\n1770\n01:35:13,725 --> 01:35:17,840\nsecurity testing, this idea of, we take\nthis knowledge, spread it out there,\n\n1771\n01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,890\naddress things like social engineering.\n\n1772\n01:35:19,890 --> 01:35:24,080\nBut it's a much broader conversation\nthan just, hey, be aware of this email,\n\n1773\n01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:27,480\nbe aware of this particular link\nin this particular context.\n\n1774\n01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,230\nThe broad conversation there\nis around security testing,\n\n1775\n01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:32,650\nvulnerability assessments,\nwhat do they mean.\n\n1776\n01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:36,700\nHow do we understand the technology\nthat's in play in an organization, and\n\n1777\n01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:39,260\nmost importantly,\nhow does that technology,\n\n1778\n01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:42,170\nwhen combined with that unknown quantity,\nthe end user, right?\n\n1779\n01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:44,330\nThe randomness in our system.\n\n1780\n01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:47,780\nHow does that then bring us to the idea\nthat there could be exposure and\n\n1781\n01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:51,470\nthis probability impact exposure\nconversation that we have around\n\n1782\n01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:54,040\nmanaging risks becomes very important.\n\n1783\n01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,490\nWe're gonna develop the slide about\nmanaging risks a little bit more.\n\n1784\n01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:58,716\nI wanna.\nOf our other conversations separately\n\n1785\n01:35:58,716 --> 01:36:02,509\nin a separate area, but I want to at\nleast introduce the concept to you around\n\n1786\n01:36:02,509 --> 01:36:06,721\nsecurity testing, around vulnerability\nassessments, and help you to understand\n\n1787\n01:36:06,721 --> 01:36:10,538\njust the sheer importance and the focus\nwe have On these particular topics.\n\n1788\n01:36:10,538 --> 01:36:13,963\nWhen we look at a system holistically,\nthe overarching system,\n\n1789\n01:36:13,963 --> 01:36:17,884\nwe have to break it into its component\nparts and then test and probe for those\n\n1790\n01:36:17,884 --> 01:36:21,992\nvulnerabilities to make sure that whatever\nwe do with that system is going to be\n\n1791\n01:36:21,992 --> 01:36:26,350\ndone is such a way that it is as secure\nas possible from a design perspective.\n\n1792\n01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:30,640\nWe spent time early on in this particular\nsection talking through the design\n\n1793\n01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:35,370\nphases and understanding how to build a\nsecure system by using a design life cycle\n\n1794\n01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:38,890\nthat has very well delineated,\nvery well demarcated phases.\n\n1795\n01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:39,440\nRight?\n\n1796\n01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,940\nAnd it's probably a good little\nknowledge point for you to stop for\n\n1797\n01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:45,230\na moment and think about, do you\nremember what those eight phases were,\n\n1798\n01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:49,370\nthat we developed in the software, excuse\nme, in the system development life cycle.\n\n1799\n01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:51,610\nAnd if you don't remember what they were,\nprobably good opportunity for\n\n1800\n01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,770\nyou to go back and review those, right,\n\n1801\n01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:56,190\nbecause you wanna make sure you know what\nthey are, but in that design life cycle,\n\n1802\n01:36:56,190 --> 01:37:01,090\nwe talked about functional requirements\nand specifications, and then testing, and\n\n1803\n01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:05,310\nbuilding and assessing and the managing\nand ultimately end of life, right?\n\n1804\n01:37:05,310 --> 01:37:09,060\nAnd so all along the scale there we have\nto be probing constantly to understand\n\n1805\n01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,920\nwhat the potential liabilities are.\n\n1806\n01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:14,505\nAnd a good example of this would be\nthe end of life of a system, right?\n\n1807\n01:37:14,505 --> 01:37:18,766\nWhether we talk about Windows XP,\nwe talk about any desktop environment that\n\n1808\n01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:23,302\nyou're using as an in user office, for\ninstance, or any of those applications.\n\n1809\n01:37:23,302 --> 01:37:25,667\nThey all reach a natural life\ncycle where at some point,\n\n1810\n01:37:25,667 --> 01:37:29,570\nthey're gonna become obsolete and we'll\nhave to replace them with other things.\n\n1811\n01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:33,728\nThat's well-defined, as a beginning point,\nwe install the software, as an endpoint,\n\n1812\n01:37:33,728 --> 01:37:34,808\nwe reach an end of life.\n\n1813\n01:37:34,808 --> 01:37:38,619\nIt's what happens in between those\ntwo well-defined points, what we call\n\n1814\n01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:42,610\nthe usage cycle of that application or\nthat software that we focus on in security\n\n1815\n01:37:42,610 --> 01:37:47,020\ntesting and vulnerability assessments,\nbecause once we put the product in play.\n\n1816\n01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:50,780\nWe then have to constantly be looking\nat the implications of using it\n\n1817\n01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:53,120\nat a certain patch level\nto understand whether or\n\n1818\n01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,030\nnot we're exposing our systems to\nvulnerabilities, our users and\n\n1819\n01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:59,400\nour systems to vulnerabilities,\nas a result of what's known, but\n\n1820\n01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,690\nmore importantly what's not known\nabout that software at any given time.\n\n1821\n01:38:02,690 --> 01:38:06,790\nAnd we can only be as good as what we\nknow about that particular system.\n\n1822\n01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:10,490\nThe zero day exploit we often hear about,\nand that we hear so much about that\n\n1823\n01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:13,660\nhappens, and has happened many many\ntimes in the last number of years.\n\n1824\n01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:18,000\nSome very well documented, others not so\nmuch so but on every platform, major or\n\n1825\n01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,920\nminor that you touch today, whether it's\na Wintel platform in a Microsoft centric\n\n1826\n01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:27,970\none, whether it's a Linux platform,\nan Android platform, the Apple platform.\n\n1827\n01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:30,080\nEvery one of these suffers\nfrom vulnerabilities.\n\n1828\n01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,990\nEvery one of them, without exception,\n\n1829\n01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,980\nsuffers from zero day exploits at\nsome point in the arc of that usage.\n\n1830\n01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:38,620\nAnd we need to understand those,\nand be aware of those.\n\n1831\n01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:40,530\nVery, very important is\nthe thought process.\n\n1832\n01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:43,270\nSo I'm gonna challenge you with\nsomething as you're listening to us,\n\n1833\n01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:46,480\nwhich is, how do you go about dealing\nwith security vulnerabilities, and\n\n1834\n01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,070\nmore importantly,\nhow do you deal with testing today?\n\n1835\n01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:52,100\nDo you have a process in place\nif you work for a company today?\n\n1836\n01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:52,970\nIs it well documented?\n\n1837\n01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:54,540\nDo you have procedures?\n\n1838\n01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:56,640\nDo you have policies,\nas we've talked about?\n\n1839\n01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,370\nAnd do you have guidelines and baselines\nthat you use to do this assessment?\n\n1840\n01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:03,580\nIf you don't,\nmy question to you would be why not?\n\n1841\n01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:04,790\nAnd you know there's always time and\n\n1842\n01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:06,890\nalways opportunity to make a change,\nright?\n\n1843\n01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:09,950\nI often challenge my students and\nmy customers when I speak with them\n\n1844\n01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:14,030\nin various venues about what are you\ngonna do differently on Monday.\n\n1845\n01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:15,660\nYou know the proverbial\nMonday when you go back,\n\n1846\n01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:17,360\nyou leave the engagement, we're done.\n\n1847\n01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:20,670\nAnd you go back and start to do different\nthings, what are you gonna do differently?\n\n1848\n01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:23,680\nThat's what I would like to think about\nand really have you think about as we\n\n1849\n01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,560\ntalk through some of this content is\nyou're hearing a lot of information.\n\n1850\n01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:30,530\nYou're getting a lot of opportunity\nto digest and understand and\n\n1851\n01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:33,330\nthink through things that may or\nmay not happen in your world today.\n\n1852\n01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:36,580\nYou're gonna take some things that\nare valuable, some that may not be so\n\n1853\n01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:40,390\nvaluable today but, down the road after\nyou certify, will become more valuable.\n\n1854\n01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:43,670\nAll of this together creates\nthe opportunity to be successful.\n\n1855\n01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:44,700\nThe difference is,\n\n1856\n01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:47,660\nwhat do you do differently in\norder to achieve that success?\n\n1857\n01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:49,830\nAnd this is one of those areas\nwhere you might have an impact and\n\n1858\n01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:51,110\ncreate some opportunity there.\n\n1859\n01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:53,950\nSo just something to think about,\nand just be aware of the fact that\n\n1860\n01:39:53,950 --> 01:39:57,180\nthere's opportunity out there for\nyou to figure out how to do this stuff.\n\n1861\n01:39:57,180 --> 01:40:01,030\nWe've shared with you some resources\nalong the way in this discussion.\n\n1862\n01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:03,200\nWe've shown you some of the websites\nthat may be valuable for\n\n1863\n01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,010\nthings like policy templates.\n\n1864\n01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:07,480\nDoing an assessment can mean many things.\n\n1865\n01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:08,700\nIt could mean a dry run and\n\n1866\n01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:11,530\na walk-through,\nin a logical design document.\n\n1867\n01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:15,940\nIt could be physically sitting down and\nrunning a software tool of some kind that\n\n1868\n01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:20,000\nassess and probes the system to\nfigure out where your weaknesses are.\n\n1869\n01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,250\nIt could be a variety of things.\n\n1870\n01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:24,256\nIt can mean something different in virtual\nenvironments than it does in physical\n\n1871\n01:40:24,256 --> 01:40:24,883\nenvironments.\n\n1872\n01:40:24,883 --> 01:40:27,926\nHowever we do that,\nit's the combination of those techniques,\n\n1873\n01:40:27,926 --> 01:40:31,800\nknowing what tools are in the toolbox that\nare available to you as a practitioner but\n\n1874\n01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,621\nthen ultimately bringing\nthe right tool to the job, right,\n\n1875\n01:40:34,621 --> 01:40:37,054\nbecause you could show up\nwith a big box of tools, but\n\n1876\n01:40:37,054 --> 01:40:40,467\nnot all of them are gonna be appropriate\ngiven what you're trying to do.\n\n1877\n01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:44,153\nAnd if you don't bring the right tool out\nof the box at the right time in order to\n\n1878\n01:40:44,153 --> 01:40:47,640\nachieve the end result you want to\nachieve, whatever that is, right?\n\n1879\n01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,840\nTighten the nut, right?\n\n1880\n01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:49,680\nTighten the bolt.\n\n1881\n01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,000\nPut the nail to there, or\nput the hammer to the nail, right?\n\n1882\n01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,900\nAnd hang the picture on the wall\nproverbially whatever that is,\n\n1883\n01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:58,850\nyou're going to suffer from an inability\nto create success consecutively and\n\n1884\n01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:01,870\nconsistently as you apply\nthese methodologies.\n\n1885\n01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:04,560\nAnd it's not hard to\nget lucky in security.\n\n1886\n01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:08,640\nThis is one thing we often understand when\nwe do for a while but we forget early on.\n\n1887\n01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:12,260\nWe think we have to be perfect at\neverything all the time, and you do.\n\n1888\n01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:14,060\nLet me be honest with you,\nright, that's the goal.\n\n1889\n01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:19,190\nThat's what you get paid to do but it's\nthe consistent application of process,\n\n1890\n01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:24,910\nprocedure, and documented best practices\nthat makes the difference between luck and\n\n1891\n01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:26,770\nreplicated success over time.\n\n1892\n01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:30,340\nAnd this is the message, one of the key\ntakeaways, the key messages you need to\n\n1893\n01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:33,940\nwalk away with from this particular\npart of our conversations overall for\n\n1894\n01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:38,240\nthe entire SSEP solution\nas we work through it.\n\n1895\n01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:41,790\nSo just some thoughts to think about\nthere as we talk about those things.\n\n1896\n01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:45,870\nAnd I think the final area that we wanted\nto spend some time on, as we went through,\n\n1897\n01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:47,670\nwas really taking this idea, or\n\n1898\n01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:51,030\nthe holistic set of ideas we've just\ndeveloped through our awareness.\n\n1899\n01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:54,720\nAround this idea of understanding\nvulnerability assessments and\n\n1900\n01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:57,720\nchange management, all of this kind\nof stuff we've been talking about.\n\n1901\n01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:01,650\nAnd really bring it all together as we\nfinalize or we think about our discussion\n\n1902\n01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:04,650\nwith some of the key technology\nareas that we see today.\n\n1903\n01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:06,430\nRight either emerging or\nhaving emerged and\n\n1904\n01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:08,842\nwe as security professionals\nare being asked to work with.\n\n1905\n01:42:08,842 --> 01:42:11,300\nSo I'm thinking again about\nthings like cloud computing.\n\n1906\n01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,110\nI'm thinking about things like mobile\ndevices, mobile device management.\n\n1907\n01:42:15,110 --> 01:42:16,740\nI'm thinking about things like, for\n\n1908\n01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:21,660\ninstance, the virtualization solutions\nthat we may bring to bear, right,\n\n1909\n01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:25,560\naround endpoint device security, and it's\ninteresting, because we don't often think\n\n1910\n01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:29,700\nof virtualization when we think about\nendpoint device security per say.\n\n1911\n01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:33,450\nIt tends to be a little bit more focused\non mobile devices, and mobile device\n\n1912\n01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:37,270\nmanagement but as we brought in that\ncategory out, we see that virtualized\n\n1913\n01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:41,160\nsolutions are becoming more the norm\nacross the environments that we work in.\n\n1914\n01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:43,890\nA lot of desktops are running\nwhat's called a VDI solution,\n\n1915\n01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:46,210\nright, a virtual desktop solution today.\n\n1916\n01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:49,190\nAnd so as a result of that we\nreally have to be prepared\n\n1917\n01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:53,820\nas security practitioners to understand\nthese emerging trends in technology.\n\n1918\n01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:57,840\nBecome familiar enough with them, that\nwe're comfortable having the discussions\n\n1919\n01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,840\nusing the language, thinking about\nthe implications of the architectures.\n\n1920\n01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,230\nYou may not be that certified\nvirtualization professional, right?\n\n1921\n01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:08,040\nYou may not be that VCP,\nthat VMware Certified Professional, or\n\n1922\n01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:11,120\nthat Microsoft VMware\nCertified Professional today.\n\n1923\n01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:16,648\nDid I just say\nMicrosoft Certified VMware Professional?\n\n1924\n01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:17,661\n[LAUGH]\n>> Microsoft [CROSSTALK].\n\n1925\n01:43:17,661 --> 01:43:18,280\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n1926\n01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:18,960\nI just thought of it.\n\n1927\n01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:19,850\nThey made up a new certification.\n\n1928\n01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:23,165\nSo, you may not be either a Microsoft\ncertified, or a VM ware certified\n\n1929\n01:43:23,165 --> 01:43:26,867\nprofessional, probably a better way of\nputting that right but the reality is,\n\n1930\n01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:30,789\nyou have to at least be comfortable enough\nto talk about these technologies with your\n\n1931\n01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:33,828\naudience, meaning the more senior\nmanagement in your company,\n\n1932\n01:43:33,828 --> 01:43:37,255\nthe end user audiences, all around\nthis idea of awareness and training so\n\n1933\n01:43:37,255 --> 01:43:40,107\nthat you can begin to understand\nwhat the requirements are.\n\n1934\n01:43:40,107 --> 01:43:41,817\nAnd as a result you can then go out and\n\n1935\n01:43:41,817 --> 01:43:44,450\ncraft solutions that\nare appropriate to these areas.\n\n1936\n01:43:44,450 --> 01:43:46,870\nAnd we often hear about\nmobile device management.\n\n1937\n01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:50,850\nThe BYOD phenomenon has been all\nthe rage over the last few years,\n\n1938\n01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:53,080\nthe bring your own device solution, right?\n\n1939\n01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:55,450\nI like to think of this as\ncombining the mobile device and\n\n1940\n01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:57,650\ncloud computing phenomenon together.\n\n1941\n01:43:57,650 --> 01:44:00,323\nReally virtualization is\nbring your own cloud,\n\n1942\n01:44:00,323 --> 01:44:02,417\nBYOC is becoming the new phenomenon.\n\n1943\n01:44:02,417 --> 01:44:05,085\nAnd when we talk about bringing\nyour own cloud to work,\n\n1944\n01:44:05,085 --> 01:44:08,797\nwhat we're talking about is end users\nthat are using these devices to access\n\n1945\n01:44:08,797 --> 01:44:10,834\ncloud-based storage solutions today.\n\n1946\n01:44:10,834 --> 01:44:13,414\nAnd, again, we've talked about this\nidea of putting data out there in\n\n1947\n01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:14,712\nthe cloud several different ways.\n\n1948\n01:44:14,712 --> 01:44:17,763\nBut if you have corporate data\nsitting out on a private Cloud,\n\n1949\n01:44:17,763 --> 01:44:20,790\nhow do you know what's there,\nand how do you manage that?\n\n1950\n01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:25,570\nThings like, as you're seeing on the\nscreen, right, Google Docs, Office 365,\n\n1951\n01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:29,870\nOneDrive, which used to be SkyDrive,\nright, been rebranded as OneDrive.\n\n1952\n01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:34,673\nAll of these solutions, Box, DropBox, any\nof those ones that are corporate and/or\n\n1953\n01:44:34,673 --> 01:44:37,100\nconsumer-oriented that are out there.\n\n1954\n01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:42,010\nAll of them are going to be issues and\nconcerns and points of contention for\n\n1955\n01:44:42,010 --> 01:44:43,380\na security practitioner.\n\n1956\n01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:48,080\nEspecially the consumer oriented ones that\nare not managed by the enterprise but\n\n1957\n01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,820\nare managed by the end user.\n\n1958\n01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:53,420\nThis really becomes a challenge because\nthey can put content that may or\n\n1959\n01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:54,880\nmay not be appropriate.\n\n1960\n01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:58,350\nUp into those devices, or\nthrough those devices up into a Cloud.\n\n1961\n01:44:58,350 --> 01:45:00,400\nAnd you may or\nmay not have a way of understanding and\n\n1962\n01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,250\nhaving visibility into what's there.\n\n1963\n01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:06,070\nSo do your usage policies adjust\nto these particular solutions,\n\n1964\n01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:09,275\nand have we really oriented\nour expectation and\n\n1965\n01:45:09,275 --> 01:45:12,995\nour baseline of what security\nmeans in a cloud-enabled world.\n\n1966\n01:45:12,995 --> 01:45:16,825\nThese are the challenges, along with\nbig data, which is another huge one.\n\n1967\n01:45:16,825 --> 01:45:18,475\nAgain, no pun intended there, right?\n\n1968\n01:45:18,475 --> 01:45:23,805\nBut big data's a very, very interesting\nphenomenon in the security world today.\n\n1969\n01:45:23,805 --> 01:45:28,475\nBecause we don't really understand yet,\nI think, fully, what the overall\n\n1970\n01:45:28,475 --> 01:45:33,310\nimpact of large data sets are not only\nfrom a just hardware perspective,\n\n1971\n01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:37,700\nsheer processing power and the scalability\nof systems, performance, availability,\n\n1972\n01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,520\nall those things we have to think about.\n\n1973\n01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:43,690\nBut the volume of information we bring to\nthe table in an analytic solution through\n\n1974\n01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:47,310\nBI with big data today is going\nto challenge the boundary and\n\n1975\n01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:51,290\nthe definition of what we think of\nas the ability to bring security\n\n1976\n01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:54,870\nto that analytics box and\nreally apply it in meaningful ways.\n\n1977\n01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:59,370\nWhen your data set is a million\nby a million row column solution,\n\n1978\n01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:02,570\nsecurity takes on a different dimension\nthan when it's a small spreadsheet sitting\n\n1979\n01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:05,240\non your desktop with a couple\nof thousand rows of data in it.\n\n1980\n01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,100\nBecause the opportunity\nto expose that data\n\n1981\n01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:12,420\nbecomes exponentially much greater as\nwe grow our data sets, and we grow\n\n1982\n01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:16,000\nthe complexity of the systems designed\nto manage and create the opportunity for\n\n1983\n01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,650\nend users to consume that data\nthrough self-service reporting.\n\n1984\n01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:22,840\nSo these are trends that over time\nare going to become very important.\n\n1985\n01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:24,546\nThey're becoming more\nimportant by the day.\n\n1986\n01:46:24,546 --> 01:46:27,320\nBut you're going to be challenged by these\nas you continue your drive to not only\n\n1987\n01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:31,550\ncertify, but ultimately to manage these\nsystems in production in real time\n\n1988\n01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:33,280\nover your professional career.\n\n1989\n01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:36,030\nAnd whatever else may be out\nthere on the horizon, obviously.\n\n1990\n01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:41,190\nVirtualization could leave to real third\nparty implementation of techniques and\n\n1991\n01:46:41,190 --> 01:46:43,810\ntools and\ntechnologies that we will bring into\n\n1992\n01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:46,950\nthe environment that we may not\nhave developed internally, but\n\n1993\n01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:49,890\nare still going to become very valuable\nas lines of business applications,\n\n1994\n01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:54,280\nas well as virtualization solutions that\nallow us to create virtual environments\n\n1995\n01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:57,210\nthat we may interact with, things like\nGoogle Glasses, for instance, right?\n\n1996\n01:46:57,210 --> 01:47:01,090\nAnd, not that we're necessarily focused\non a consumer-end device as being\n\n1997\n01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:04,440\nan enterprise solution, but imagine what\nthat means in the enterprise in five or\n\n1998\n01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,630\nten years down the road potentially.\n\n1999\n01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:10,720\nWhen that kind of software,\nhardware, human interaction point,\n\n2000\n01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,920\nbecomes the nexus for how we share and\nreceive and send information.\n\n2001\n01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,010\nAll of these are things that we\nhave to think about as security\n\n2002\n01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:17,370\nprofessionals today.\n\n2003\n01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:20,470\n>> And in a way, it makes our job\na lot harder than it used to be.\n\n2004\n01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:22,820\n>> Absolutely.\n>> It used to be if you worked for\n\n2005\n01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:26,700\nmy company, you got a company issued\nlaptop and a company issued cell phone.\n\n2006\n01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:29,430\nAnd I had total control\nover those systems.\n\n2007\n01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:31,420\nI set up that laptop,\nI set up that cell phone,\n\n2008\n01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:34,200\nand I controlled them as\ncorporate resources, all right?\n\n2009\n01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,350\nBut in today's world,\nif you bring your own iPad,\n\n2010\n01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:42,480\nif you bring your own cell phone,\nthere's a reasonable, just an expectation,\n\n2011\n01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,850\nthat you have control of your own device.\n\n2012\n01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:45,370\n>> Ebb and demand,\nmore importantly, right?\n\n2013\n01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:48,360\nI mean, usually it's not even\nthat users are thinking.\n\n2014\n01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:51,910\nWell, okay, if I bring it, maybe if I ask,\nand I'm nice, maybe they'll let me.\n\n2015\n01:47:51,910 --> 01:47:55,390\nUsers are beating down the door of\nIT today and demanding that we,\n\n2016\n01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:58,700\nas professionals,\nsupport their choice of systems.\n\n2017\n01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:00,970\nYou know, to Don's point,\nit's not the other way around.\n\n2018\n01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:03,730\nUp until three or four years ago,\nhistorically, for\n\n2019\n01:48:03,730 --> 01:48:07,870\nthe 40 some odd year arc of computing\ntechnology that we see in the enterprise,\n\n2020\n01:48:07,870 --> 01:48:09,600\nin the modern day, anyway, right?\n\n2021\n01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,670\nIt's been, you get your corporate issued\nkit, quote unquote, to go to work with.\n\n2022\n01:48:13,670 --> 01:48:16,680\nYou get your desk, you get your phone, all\nright, you get your cube, whatever it is.\n\n2023\n01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:20,840\nYou may have a technology item like\na laptop or a desktop or a word processor.\n\n2024\n01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:22,790\nMay or may not have a phone and that's it.\n\n2025\n01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:24,650\nYou run what we tell you to run,\n\n2026\n01:48:24,650 --> 01:48:27,590\nyou access information the ways\nthat we tell you to access it.\n\n2027\n01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:29,820\nAnd at the end of the day,\nthat's it, right.\n\n2028\n01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:32,660\nToday it's the end user that's telling\n\n2029\n01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:36,310\nultimately the company how they want to\nconsume and interact with information.\n\n2030\n01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:38,030\nAnd that's a very different mindset.\n\n2031\n01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:41,510\nA very different shift in\nthe information management paradigm.\n\n2032\n01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:45,740\nWe're putting the hands of the user\non the control throttles, right,\n\n2033\n01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:49,550\nof our information security management\nsolution, but we're not educating them.\n\n2034\n01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:53,370\nAnd not explaining to them what the down\nside and the dark side is of that power.\n\n2035\n01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:55,730\nAnd just like everything\nelse we hear about, right.\n\n2036\n01:48:55,730 --> 01:48:59,640\nWith ultimate power comes ultimate\nresponsibility and authority.\n\n2037\n01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,560\nAnd as a result of that,\nthis idea of accountability and\n\n2038\n01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,540\nresponsibility really has to be addressed,\nand addressed in a meaningful way with end\n\n2039\n01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:09,250\nusers around,\nthe ability to chose their technology.\n\n2040\n01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:12,630\nAnd I think it's a big gap we have right\nnow, inside of information security from\n\n2041\n01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:15,380\na framework perspective and\na management perspective.\n\n2042\n01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:16,812\n>> Absolutely.\n\n2043\n01:49:16,812 --> 01:49:19,250\n>> All right probably some good\nthoughts for you to think about but\n\n2044\n01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:22,010\nultimately a good place for\nus to probably wrap up our conversations.\n\n2045\n01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:22,890\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n2046\n01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:27,050\nSo we've definitely got all the rest of\nthe objectives in, the SSCP to cover but\n\n2047\n01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:30,535\nthis pretty much wraps up security\noperations and administration.\n\n2048\n01:49:30,535 --> 01:49:32,535\nA lot of good stuff to be had there.\n\n2049\n01:49:32,535 --> 01:49:37,925\nYou know keep in mind guys if you have any\nquestions at all live during the show you\n\n2050\n01:49:37,925 --> 01:49:41,825\ncan jump over to itpro.tv/live and you'll\nsee the chat room right beneath the video.\n\n2051\n01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:44,490\nYou can post your questions there and\nwe monitor and answer.\n\n2052\n01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:47,390\nBut if you're watching this recorded,\nwhich I know a lot of you will,\n\n2053\n01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:52,290\nyou can post your questions anytime of the\nday using our Q&A section on the website,\n\n2054\n01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:56,690\non every IT Pro TV webpage, you'll see\na link up at the top that says Q&A.\n\n2055\n01:49:56,690 --> 01:49:58,330\nHit that, post your questions in there.\n\n2056\n01:49:58,330 --> 01:49:59,200\nAgain, we monitor and\n\n2057\n01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:02,090\nanswer, we want to make sure that you\nguys get that stuff taken care of.\n\n2058\n01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:04,850\nWhen you go and sit down in that testing\nbooth, we want you guys going in there\n\n2059\n01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:09,360\nwith answers, not with questions, so make\nsure you ask anything that you've got.\n\n2060\n01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,190\nMost of the questions we answer\nright there in the forum, but\n\n2061\n01:50:11,190 --> 01:50:14,320\nif it's a really good question we may\nturn out another episode to go ahead and\n\n2062\n01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,640\nrecord the answer and\naddress it in a thorough manner, right?\n\n2063\n01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:20,640\nMaking sure we cover it\nthe way it needs to be.\n\n2064\n01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:21,730\n>> Absolutely.\n\n2065\n01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:23,790\n>> All right well I hope\nyou guys enjoyed the show.\n\n2066\n01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:26,480\nSigning

00:00:50,150\nYou did.\nWe did some cool stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,240\n>> On the risky business, right?\n\n13\n00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,450\n>> Yes.\nThe risky business.\n\n14\n00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,475\n>> I was like,\nI'm gonna step away from that.\n\n15\n00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:58,240\n[LAUGH] So today we've got a good episode\nlined up because we're gonna be jumping\n\n16\n00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,100\ninto risk analysis.\n\n17\n00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,750\nNo, that's what I just said I missed on.\n\n18\n00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,020\nBut we're doing monitoring.\n\n19\n00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,290\n>> Monitoring and analysis.\n\n20\n00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,041\n>> See, it's so important that we be\naware of what we're supposed to be doing.\n\n21\n00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,880\n[LAUGH]\n>> This is why you manage risk folks.\n\n22\n00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,290\nThis is why you mitigate risk.\n\n23\n00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,725\n>> See, and\nif you have proper documentation,\n\n24\n00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,860\nthen you know what show you're\nsupposed to do and it all works out.\n\n25\n00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,335\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n26\n00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:20,330\n>> All right, so monitoring and analysis,\nthat's a big topic because it's\n\n27\n00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,300\nprobably what we spend\nthe bulk of our career doing.\n\n28\n00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,150\nWhen you're not responding or planning,\nmonitoring and analysis is pretty much it.\n\n29\n00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,610\nSo we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n30\n00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,090\nSome of the concepts that\nwe need to be aware of,\n\n31\n00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,630\nand some of the things that we really\nshould be doing as a responsible\n\n32\n00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,470\nsecurity professional.\n\n33\n00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,440\n>> Responsible security professional\nis probably a good way to start out.\n\n34\n00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,460\nSo obviously, all kidding aside,\n\n35\n00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,580\nwe wanna talk about some of the things\nthat are focusing you as a professional,\n\n36\n00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,920\na security practitioner, in the field,\non those day-to-day activities.\n\n37\n00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,490\nDon was absolutely correct\nwhen he pointed out that\n\n38\n00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,670\nprobably the bulk of the activities you\nengage in on a let's say weekly basis,\n\n39\n00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,840\nbecause on a daily basis\nyou do a variety of things.\n\n40\n00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,270\nBut if we aggregate that time up over a\nweek, what most people tend to spend a lot\n\n41\n00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,560\nof time doing is activities that\nfall into this kind of a bucket,\n\n42\n00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,410\nthese kinds of activities\nthat we'll be discussing.\n\n43\n00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,120\nThings like security auditing and\nanalysis may or\n\n44\n00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,090\nmay not be done on a ongoing basis by you,\nright?\n\n45\n00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,890\nThere may be a team of people\nthat are called in to do audits\n\n46\n00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,910\nbased on the kind of activity that may be\nsuspected that we're looking for, and or\n\n47\n00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,390\nto validate and verify things on a\nquarterly, maybe semiannual, annual basis.\n\n48\n00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,890\nSo those people tend to be specialists,\nthat's what they do.\n\n49\n00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,570\nBut you also, as a professional,\n\n50\n00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,590\na practitioner in the field, engage in\na lot of those kinds of activities.\n\n51\n00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,030\nBut maybe not as formally as they do,\nwith the same results on a regular basis.\n\n52\n00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,060\nAnd so you will go through, you will\nbe hopefully looking at log files.\n\n53\n00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,380\nYou hopefully will be\nscanning machines every so\n\n54\n00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,400\noften to find out what's on there to make\nsure you're not either configuring or\n\n55\n00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,670\nwithout your knowledge sending a machine\nout into the wild that may have\n\n56\n00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,000\nports open that are not\nsupposed to be available.\n\n57\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,347\nYou will hopefully be looking at\nbaselines, creating baselines,\n\n58\n00:03:05,347 --> 00:03:09,574\nmonitoring for compliance, looking at some\nsort of a solution where we can be alerted\n\n59\n00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:12,593\nto the fact that things may or\nmay not be the way that they are.\n\n60\n00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,801\nSo we would call these things\ntripwire solutions generically and\n\n61\n00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:18,552\nthen we'll look at what those\nkind of solutions may be.\n\n62\n00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:21,070\nSo we'll be looking at log collection and\nanalysis.\n\n63\n00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,929\nAnd you'll be doing those things, again,\nhopefully at least on a weekly basis.\n\n64\n00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:28,567\nBut it probably depends on the kind of\ntraffic you see in your network, and\n\n65\n00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:31,923\nwhat the goal of that particular\nnetwork that you're managing is.\n\n66\n00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:35,782\nIf it's a production network you're gonna\nhave a lot more focus on these kind of\n\n67\n00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,700\nactivities than if it's a test network\nsomewhere where you're just spinning up\n\n68\n00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,530\na bunch of machines, maybe to do some\ntesting before you do patch management.\n\n69\n00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,671\nIn which case, you may not be as\nfocused on things like log analysis and\n\n70\n00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:49,960\nsecurity auditing, you're much more\nfocused on regression testing.\n\n71\n00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,060\nAnd so, it will depend on the objectives.\n\n72\n00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,180\nBut verifying security controls,\nthese are areas where we will spend time,\n\n73\n00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,360\nyou will spend time going in and looking\nat the things that are put in place.\n\n74\n00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,310\nWhether they are policy based controls,\nphysical controls where we actually lock\n\n75\n00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,180\na piece of software with\na password to get into it,\n\n76\n00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,670\nor perhaps we encrypt data,\nor things of that nature.\n\n77\n00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,300\nThose kind of controls,\nas well as the policy based controls,\n\n78\n00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,390\nthe documentation we create,\nthe architecture of our networks.\n\n79\n00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,445\nWhether we have a DMZ,\nif we do have a DMZ,\n\n80\n00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:25,050\nwhat's in the DMZ, what is on the outside,\nwhat is on the inside.\n\n81\n00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,320\nWhere do we place architecture\nmonitoring capabilities?\n\n82\n00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,900\nAre they in the DMZ?\n\n83\n00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,820\nAre they behind the DMZ in the lamp,\nor perhaps both straddling that DMZ?\n\n84\n00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,810\nSo these kinds of things will be\nthings that we'll have to think about.\n\n85\n00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,240\nAnd there's monitoring and testing that\ngoes on with these systems, to make sure\n\n86\n00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,350\nthey're up to date, to make sure we\nknow what's going on in our network.\n\n87\n00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,660\nBut also to get a holistic view\nof things that potentially, and\n\n88\n00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,250\nwe talked about this in our threat and\nvulnerability and risk conversations in\n\n89\n00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,470\nthe earlier episodes, when we talked\nabout risk and risk analysis, right?\n\n90\n00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,630\nThe idea of being able to understand\nnot just what is happening, but\n\n91\n00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,930\nthe potentiality of what could happen,\nand as a result of that how\n\n92\n00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,800\nquickly it can happen, and what is\nthe impact to my network if it does.\n\n93\n00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,300\nAnd so this is the kind of\nthing that we can focus on\n\n94\n00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,020\nwhen we look at overall this entire area.\n\n95\n00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,200\nBut specifically focus in on\nmonitoring and testing of our systems\n\n96\n00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,890\nto ensure we're ready for any of these\nunusual activities that may pop up.\n\n97\n00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,940\nSo these are gonna be the areas\nwe're gonna start focusing on,\n\n98\n00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,180\nour discussions will\ndelve into these areas.\n\n99\n00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,150\nBut we as always want to think about not\njust these specific items but how they\n\n100\n00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,100\nlink to the other areas of knowledge\nwe've been talking about in other shows.\n\n101\n00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,020\nI just mention the tie in to risk,\nrisk analysis,\n\n102\n00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,080\nbusiness impact analysis takes place\nin that general discussion as well.\n\n103\n00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,280\nAnd bringing all that information\ntogether is gonna be crucial as you build\n\n104\n00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320\nnot just this particular piece of\nthe puzzle into other pieces, but\n\n105\n00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,460\nbuild the puzzle overall.\n\n106\n00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,640\nThe puzzle of information\nsecurity management and\n\n107\n00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,430\nthe puzzle of being\na security practitioner.\n\n108\n00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,940\nWhat does that picture look like,\nif you will, right?\n\n109\n00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,440\nSo we're gonna take a look at some of the\nprinciples of auditing, we'll talk about\n\n110\n00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,700\nthose, we're also gonna talk about system\nmonitoring from a log management, IDS, and\n\n111\n00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,690\nIPS perspective.\n\n112\n00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,550\nI know Don's got a little surprise for\nus that he put together around IDS and\n\n113\n00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,010\nIPS, so we've got actually a really nice\nlittle diagram we'll take a look at and\n\n114\n00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,190\nuse as a talking point.\n\n115\n00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,300\nAnd we're gonna also talk about security\ncompliance from an evaluation perspective.\n\n116\n00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,980\nYou know,\nwhat does it mean to go through an audit?\n\n117\n00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,360\nWhat will the auditor look for?\n\n118\n00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,360\nAnd what are those things you as the\npractitioner are gonna have to make sure\n\n119\n00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,940\nyou're ready to talk about or perhaps\nprovide if we go through an audit and\n\n120\n00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,780\nyou're not doing the audit but\nrather providing content to the auditor.\n\n121\n00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,960\nSo let's just make sure we're thinking\nabout those things as we get started.\n\n122\n00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,340\nAs always,\nwhen we're talking about this information,\n\n123\n00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,040\nwhatever we are focused on is gonna be\nmade up of three constituent parts.\n\n124\n00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,210\nAnd let me start out by talking about\nconfidentiality, integrity, and\n\n125\n00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,000\navailability of information.\n\n126\n00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,890\nAnd if you remember,\nas we've talked about confidentiality,\n\n127\n00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,130\nwe're talking about the idea\nof keeping that a secret,\n\n128\n00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,730\nkeeping it away from people\nthat aren't supposed to see it.\n\n129\n00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,450\nBut making sure that we secure it\nin such a way that the people that\n\n130\n00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,100\nare authorized to see\nit have access to it.\n\n131\n00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,110\nAnd availability comes in when we talk\nabout getting access pretty much whenever,\n\n132\n00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,860\nright on demand,\n\n133\n00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,430\nwhatever that may be based on\nthe needs of the population we serve.\n\n134\n00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,300\nAnd then integrity is about\nsafeguarding that data to make sure,\n\n135\n00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,230\nnot to keep it away from prying eyes, but\nto make sure that the data itself doesn't\n\n136\n00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,440\nget modified, unless we actually know\nthe person that's doing the modification\n\n137\n00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,300\nis the authorized party, perhaps the data\nowner or the delegated representative\n\n138\n00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,090\nof the owner that's been given rights\nto be able to work with that data.\n\n139\n00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,990\nSo, we wanna focus on integrity,\nconfidentiality and availability but\n\n140\n00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,300\nespecially in this area we wanna\nmake sure we're focusing on\n\n141\n00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,770\nnot just the availability of information,\nbut what is that availability really mean?\n\n142\n00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,200\nWhat are people seeing?\n\n143\n00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,050\nHow are they seeing it?\n\n144\n00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,900\nWhat are the mechanisms they use?\n\n145\n00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,120\nAnd is confidentiality in place?\n\n146\n00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,250\nAnd if so, what are the boundaries\nof that confidentiality?\n\n147\n00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,050\nWhat kind of systems do we have\nthat'll help us to understand that?\n\n148\n00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,406\nSo, let's start by talking about\nsecurity auditing and analysis.\n\n149\n00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:53,772\nThis is gonna be one of the very important\nareas that we need to spend some time on.\n\n150\n00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:59,229\nWhen we talk about security auditing, I do\nauditing work for a lot of my customers.\n\n151\n00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,387\nI spend time in the field helping them to\nunderstand how to go through an audit,\n\n152\n00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:06,240\nprepare for one,\nwhat an audit may look like.\n\n153\n00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,160\nAnd when we talk to customers or\nyou as a professional in the security area\n\n154\n00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,190\ntalk to your business or the people in\nyour business about being prepared.\n\n155\n00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,000\nThe Boy Scout motto, always be prepared.\n\n156\n00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,150\nThis is a general thought process that\napplies to almost anything we do.\n\n157\n00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,490\nIf you don't show up to work on Monday\nmorning ready to work on a Monday,\n\n158\n00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,200\nas opposed to thinking about Friday,\nyou're not gonna really be prepared to go\n\n159\n00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,740\nthrough the week and\nbe as productive as you can be.\n\n160\n00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,550\nAnd when we talk about auditing,\n\n161\n00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,850\nwe're talking about this idea of gathering\ninformation in some sort of systemic way.\n\n162\n00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,730\nWe'll lay out what that\nsystem looks like and\n\n163\n00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,830\nwhat that process flow is\nin a couple of minutes.\n\n164\n00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,750\nBut gathering this information in\nsuch a way that we have the ability\n\n165\n00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,640\nto paint a picture of what's going on\nin the network, based on our findings.\n\n166\n00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,290\nAnd if we're not looking for\nthe right stuff,\n\n167\n00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,690\nthen we're not going to have the right\nfocus or the right context or\n\n168\n00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,270\npicture that helps us to understand\nwhat's going on in the network.\n\n169\n00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,300\nAnd so\nthis is really as much about context and\n\n170\n00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,050\nas much about understanding\nwhat we need to find\n\n171\n00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,850\nas it is about having an expectation\nof what will or will not be there.\n\n172\n00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,300\nBecause what I often find when I\ndo audits or I'm asked to engage\n\n173\n00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,390\nin the audit process or walk a client\nthrough an audit finding, is, that it's\n\n174\n00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,850\nthe things that we don't often think about\nthat are the most interesting in an audit.\n\n175\n00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,390\nSo it's the things that we may\nnot realize are happening,\n\n176\n00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,300\nthe things that we may not understand, are\npart of our daily routine on our networks,\n\n177\n00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,970\nbecause we're just not looking for them,\n\n178\n00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,070\nwe're not aware that they're there,\nthat the audit brings to light.\n\n179\n00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,350\nIt's really that ultimate reality\ncheck if you think of it that way.\n\n180\n00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,030\nIt's the ultimate QA of your network.\n\n181\n00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,310\nIf your network is sound and\nthe architecture is good and\n\n182\n00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,010\nyou've done your job properly, the audit\nshould simply reinforce that for you.\n\n183\n00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,870\nAnd you really shouldn't find anything for\nthe most part that's unusual.\n\n184\n00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,100\nBut if you really haven't\ndone your due diligence,\n\n185\n00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,030\na term that we use a lot when we talk\nabout making sure you're focused on\n\n186\n00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,080\nthe right things and doing\nthe background work to ensure success.\n\n187\n00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,950\nYou're not planning, in other words.\n\n188\n00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,290\nYou're gonna be in for\nsome nasty surprises, right?\n\n189\n00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,610\nThis is the same we have pretty\nmuch anywhere in life, right?\n\n190\n00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,260\nIf you go through.\n\n191\n00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,990\nI like to cook a little bit.\n\n192\n00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,440\nI don't know if you're a baker or perhaps\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,000\n>> Somebody who likes to bake or cook.\n\n194\n00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,240\nBut occasionally I like to cook, right?.\n\n195\n00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,820\nWhen I do have the opportunity.\n\n196\n00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,010\nI don't get to do it very often.\n\n197\n00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,140\nBut you know, when I do have\nthe opportunity, it is the kind of thing\n\n198\n00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,530\nthat if you don't plan for, you can tell\none thing about a meal going into it,\n\n199\n00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,930\nif you don't plan for it up front,\nit's never going to be as a good\n\n200\n00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,140\nas if you take the time to figure it out,\nhave the right ingredients,\n\n201\n00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,120\nmaybe try a couple of different\nways of approaching the recipe.\n\n202\n00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,700\nAnd make sure you get it right before\nyou actually go into production.\n\n203\n00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,385\nQuote unquote, or I have to do my\nair quotes, quote unquote, right?\n\n204\n00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:46,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when we do that,\n\n205\n00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,900\nwe're thinking about this idea of making\nsure that we are as prepared as we can be,\n\n206\n00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,840\nand this is the secret to\nsuccessful audits, by the way.\n\n207\n00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,710\nIt's the secret to everything in life,\nit's not just audits, but\n\n208\n00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,210\nespecially this area.\n\n209\n00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,340\nNo nasty surprises,\nknow what's going on in your networks.\n\n210\n00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,380\nAnd so, let me ask all of you that\nare listening to us either live or\n\n211\n00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,200\nthose of you that are watching us\nafter we get done with this episode.\n\n212\n00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,000\nHow many of you in your professional\ncapacity in your networks today,\n\n213\n00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,985\nare confident enough to sit and say to\nyourself to answer the following question.\n\n214\n00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:20,365\nI'm pretty sure that if I\ndid an audit right now,\n\n215\n00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:22,095\nI wouldn't have any nasty surprises.\n\n216\n00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:26,005\nI wouldn't be told there are things going\non in my network that I'm not aware of.\n\n217\n00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:29,782\nAnd most of us can't answer that question\nauthoritatively and confidently.\n\n218\n00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:32,802\nAnd say oh no absolutely I'm good,\nI know for a fact.\n\n219\n00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:35,972\nI've got this and this and\nthere's nothing else going on.\n\n220\n00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:40,082\nWhen we talk about auditing, we're talking\nabout looking for things that are there.\n\n221\n00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:41,572\nThey're hiding in plain sight and\n\n222\n00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:44,656\nthis is what term you often\nhear auditors use, right?\n\n223\n00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:46,186\nThey're hiding in plain sight.\n\n224\n00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:49,186\nThey're there, we're just not aware\nof them cuz we're not looking for\n\n225\n00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,786\nthe right things and\nlooking in the right places.\n\n226\n00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:54,778\nAnd we're gonna show you\nlater what a tool could be\n\n227\n00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:56,528\nthat will help you to\nuncover some of this.\n\n228\n00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:59,668\nBut can we throw the end map\nsolution up for just a second.\n\n229\n00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:01,398\n>> Sure.\n>> I just wanna give you an idea of what\n\n230\n00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:03,318\nI'm talking about when I talk\nabout hiding in plain sight.\n\n231\n00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:08,489\nAnd so on the screen in front\nof you what we're looking at is,\n\n232\n00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:12,259\nwe just went through and did a quick scan\nof the network here just to give you\n\n233\n00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,629\nan idea using Nmap as a tool,\nsome of the things we may find.\n\n234\n00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,919\nAnd so for instance on this\nparticular solution right here.\n\n235\n00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,749\nThis particular machine that\nwe're looking at, we're seeing\n\n236\n00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:24,469\nwell as soon as we get zoomed in\n>> I want to\n\n237\n00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:25,409\nmake sure that I get the header.\n\n238\n00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,450\n>> No problem\n>> What we're zooming in, or\n\n239\n00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,010\nwhat we're ultimately gonna show you is\nthat we have a bunch of ports running and\n\n240\n00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,230\nso we can see that there is some\nstandard Windows ports there for RPC.\n\n241\n00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,990\nWe've got NetBIOS running there,\nthat in and\n\n242\n00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,400\nof itself tells us that it's\na Windows-based machine.\n\n243\n00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,010\nWe have an HTTP proxy, we have some\nsort of web server, on a dedicated\n\n244\n00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,980\nport there it looks like 3389,\nthat's actually probably gonna be a remote\n\n245\n00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,830\naccess solution, that's not actually a web\nserver, that's probably an RDP solution.\n\n246\n00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,590\nAnd then as we continue down we got\na bunch of other stuff happening there.\n\n247\n00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,220\nSo what this tells us,\njust at a quick glance, and\n\n248\n00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,800\nwe see VNC is running, as well.\n\n249\n00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,770\nRight?\nSo we've got remote access into\n\n250\n00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,800\nthis machine, we've got some services\nthat may or may not be problematic for\n\n251\n00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,170\nus because net BIOS bleeds\ninformation everywhere.\n\n252\n00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,080\nAnd it's just gonna be one of those\nthings that when we see it we shudder\n\n253\n00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,580\na little bit.\n\n254\n00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,120\nRight?\n\n255\n00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,500\nWe also down below have a MAC address,\n\n256\n00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,130\nright underneath that port scan that\ntells us this is a Dell machine.\n\n257\n00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,310\nMay or\nmay not be important in it of itself but\n\n258\n00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,160\ngiving out that kind of information,\nmay lead us to then find\n\n259\n00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,660\nsome sort of an exploit in the hardware\non this particular machine if we can\n\n260\n00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,620\nnarrow it down what the build is that\npotentially could be problematic.\n\n261\n00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,200\nWe do see an operating system\nidentified their as Microsoft based,\n\n262\n00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,470\nwhether it's a desktop or a server\nwe're not 100% sure, but this does\n\n263\n00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,970\nindicate to us that we definitely have\nsome interesting things to think about.\n\n264\n00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,410\nThe other thing that's really interesting\nis the uptime information there.\n\n265\n00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,900\nIt says it's guessing that we've probably\nbeen up for somewhere around 50 days,\n\n266\n00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,520\n54 days.\n\n267\n00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,820\nWhat that tells me is that\nthis machine probably\n\n268\n00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,200\nhas not been security patched\nin the last two months, and so\n\n269\n00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,450\njust looking at that little piece of\ninformation alone tells me as a potential\n\n270\n00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,070\nperson who made be looking to do things\nin your network that you don't want done.\n\n271\n00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,250\nSo putting on my hacker hat for\na minute or\n\n272\n00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,930\nmy social engineering hat about\nhow am I going to get access.\n\n273\n00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,250\nWhen I look at a solution like that\non the Microsoft side I say to myself\n\n274\n00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,700\nyou know just doing the quick mental\nchecklist, if I'm running, and\n\n275\n00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,180\nI make an educated guess that I'm running\na Windows 7 and or Server 12 OS, and\n\n276\n00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,790\nI'm gonna gamble and say Server 12,\nright, cuz we're probably not\n\n277\n00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,110\ngoing to run some of the things\nwe just saw on a Windows 7 box.\n\n278\n00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,110\nSo if I see Server 12, and I say, you know\nit hasn't been patched in, let's say,\n\n279\n00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,200\nclose to 60 days.\n\n280\n00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000\nProbably missed two patch cycles.\n\n281\n00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,420\nWhat are the most recent security\npatches out there for this OS?\n\n282\n00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,480\nAnd as a result of that if I\nknow they haven't been applied\n\n283\n00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,220\nare there exploits that I\ncan now take advantage of.\n\n284\n00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,690\nAnd so this is the exact kind of thing\nthat I'm talking about when we talk about\n\n285\n00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,920\nwhat are the nasty surprises\nlaying out there in your network.\n\n286\n00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,430\nAnd this is just one machine by the way.\n\n287\n00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,950\nWe've got a whole list of them.\n\n288\n00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,800\nWe're not gonna go through them now we'll\ntake a look at some others later but\n\n289\n00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,350\nthe thing here is to really understand\nwhat is in a tool, like a map.\n\n290\n00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,370\nThere are many, many tools we can use but\n\n291\n00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,570\na quick scan brings back\na wealth of information for\n\n292\n00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,240\nthe security professional but also for the\nperson who's gonna take that information\n\n293\n00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,140\nand live on the dark side of the network\nand really try to get in and do harm.\n\n294\n00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,210\nAnd so we wanna make sure we're paying\nattention to these kinda things and so\n\n295\n00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,920\nsecurity auditing really\nhelps us to do that.\n\n296\n00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,000\nIt's gonna a very very\nvital part of what we do.\n\n297\n00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,960\nLet's talk about how we\ndo a security audit.\n\n298\n00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,630\nWe've seen potentially what\ncan be the problem here.\n\n299\n00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,290\nLet's go back and talk about what we\nactually are thinking an audit can help us\n\n300\n00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,170\nto do by talking about the things that\nan audit would be set up to accomplish.\n\n301\n00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,598\nSo let's talk at the high level first\nabout business objectives, right.\n\n302\n00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:50,973\nSecurity auditing typically is\ngonna make sure we're looking for\n\n303\n00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:54,407\nsound security policy, so\nYeah one of the things we just pointed out\n\n304\n00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:57,256\nto you is that we may have\na lapse in our patching policy.\n\n305\n00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,870\nRight, we may have patch\nmanagement in place but\n\n306\n00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,271\nthe patch management policy clearly is not\nbeing applied across the board to all of\n\n307\n00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:07,320\nour machines in this network\nwe just took a look at.\n\n308\n00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,510\nCuz it's gone for\nover 50 days without being rebooted.\n\n309\n00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,710\nWhich means on the Microsoft side,\n\n310\n00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,795\nyou probably have not\napplied patches most likely.\n\n311\n00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:18,040\nCuz a lot of these patches, especially\nsecurity patches will require a restart.\n\n312\n00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,010\n>> Yeah you know\n>> Good old Microsoft, right?\n\n313\n00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,470\n>> One of the areas where other OSs can\nget a little leg up is that on a Linux\n\n314\n00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,480\nbox or a Solaris box,\nit might have been up for two years,\n\n315\n00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,164\nbut it's been doing its updates.\n\n316\n00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:32,110\nAnd the only thing you can't really update\nwithout a reboot is a kernel on those.\n\n317\n00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,040\nBut Windows, there's a number of\nservices you've got to reboot for.\n\n318\n00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,810\n>> When you have millions and\n\n319\n00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,820\nmillions of lines of code\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,460\n>> This is what you get, boys and girls!\n\n321\n00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,632\n>> Well, we could isolate what it was,\nbut, lets just reboot the system,\n\n322\n00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:44,206\nit's fine.\n\n323\n00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:44,857\n>> Yeah, what the heck.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n324\n00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:46,577\n>> It seems to work better when we do that\n\n325\n00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:47,413\nanyway, right?\n\n326\n00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,109\n>> What's a little downtime\nbetween friends, right?\n\n327\n00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,750\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly, exactly.\n\n328\n00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,660\nSo verifying our security policies,\n\n329\n00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,040\nspecific things like patch\nmanagement are being addressed.\n\n330\n00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,760\nAlso baseline compliance, right?\n\n331\n00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,010\nThis is another important one.\n\n332\n00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:06,000\nIf we have a baseline build and we have\nsome sort of a solution around that\n\n333\n00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,530\nthat we are measuring against,\nare we taking a look at those things?\n\n334\n00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,680\nAnd this is one of many areas that we\nwant to make sure we are thinking about.\n\n335\n00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,280\nAre we supporting and do we have controls\nin the organization that support\n\n336\n00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,160\nall of the policies that\nneed to be in place?\n\n337\n00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,680\nIt's one thing to have a policy and\nto say okay, we should patch manage,\n\n338\n00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,910\nwe should restart that machine\nafter a patch every 30 days,\n\n339\n00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,340\nwhether it needs it or not,\ndepending on what it is.\n\n340\n00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,870\nMaybe a little bit longer.\n\n341\n00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,330\nBut if we don't have the controls\nin place, the checklists.\n\n342\n00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,430\nIn one of the earlier episodes,\n\n343\n00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,400\nI made a reference to this idea of\nwhat is your daily, your weekly,\n\n344\n00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,280\nyour monthly, your quarterly, your\nsemiannual, and your annual checklist?\n\n345\n00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,020\nThe six checklists that,\nas a security professional,\n\n346\n00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,680\nyou should have at your disposal and you\nshould be thinking about using to manage.\n\n347\n00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,560\nAnd if you don't have controls embedded\nin these checklists that say to you,\n\n348\n00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,090\ndid somebody actually patch the machine,\nwhere's the evidence of that?\n\n349\n00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,275\nWhere is my change log?\n\n350\n00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,965\nHow do we know, how do we verify,\nright, that this has been done?\n\n351\n00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:12,925\nSo this idea of trusting but\nverifying to make sure\n\n352\n00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,795\nis very critical when we talk about\nwhat a security audit can do for us.\n\n353\n00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,555\nThe effective implementation of\nthese controls is really what we're\n\n354\n00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:21,210\ntalking about at the end of the day.\n\n355\n00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,900\nAnd measuring to make sure that they\nare doing what they are supposed to do.\n\n356\n00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,290\nNothing worse than patching a machine and\n\n357\n00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,080\nfinding out that the patches you applied\nare not pertinent to production.\n\n358\n00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,205\nBecause they may have opened up other\nvulnerabilities that that machine\n\n359\n00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:35,980\nshould not have.\n\n360\n00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,539\nBecause you have now patched a service or\n\n361\n00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:41,560\na system in such a way\nthat it's not being used.\n\n362\n00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,820\nAnd as a result of that, or the way\nyou're using the machine rather, is\n\n363\n00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,630\nnot appropriate for the kind of patching\nyou're doing, is what I should say.\n\n364\n00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,540\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n365\n00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,820\nyou may have opened up more security\nvulnerabilities than you're addressing.\n\n366\n00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,050\n>> And that's frustrating thing cuz\nit changes between vendors, right?\n\n367\n00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,900\nJust using Microsoft as an example.\n\n368\n00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,740\nWhen you get updates from them,\nthere's hot fixes, there's service packs,\n\n369\n00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,700\nthere's patches, there's updates.\n\n370\n00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,100\nAnd each term means something different.\n\n371\n00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,900\nAnd some of them just include bug fixes,\ncritical fixes,\n\n372\n00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,470\nthings that you really need.\n\n373\n00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,790\nOthers actually include feature updates.\n\n374\n00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,320\nAnd that's a problem cuz you might\nbe adding features to your system,\n\n375\n00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,780\nlike Adam said,\nthat you don't need or that may\n\n376\n00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,400\noverall weaken the security of your\nsystem or violate your security policy.\n\n377\n00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,700\nThis is why it's so\nimportant to test these things.\n\n378\n00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,610\n>> Everything you add turns on a service\nsomehow, exchanges information with other\n\n379\n00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,970\nsystems in your network, outside,\nbeyond the boundary of your network.\n\n380\n00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,610\nAnd every time you add something,\n\n381\n00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,330\nyou're inviting people in to\ntake a look at what's there.\n\n382\n00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,210\nYou may not realize it.\n\n383\n00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,900\nYou may not know that's what you're doing,\nbut\n\n384\n00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,420\nyou're opening a door that somebody at\nsome point is gonna try to walk through.\n\n385\n00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,810\nAnd so the question is how good are your\nlocks at the end of the day, right?\n\n386\n00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,500\nAll right so\nwhen we talk about security controls then,\n\n387\n00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,590\nlet's talk about this idea of\njust what the security cycle is.\n\n388\n00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,860\nAnd so we talk about this idea of\nmonitoring first, right, because\n\n389\n00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,810\nwe have to monitor what's there in order\nto really understand what's going on.\n\n390\n00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,560\nAnd then we audit in order\nto validate monitoring.\n\n391\n00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,880\nAre we really seeing the results\nof what we're monitoring?\n\n392\n00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,230\nAre we writing them down?\n\n393\n00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,290\nLet's randomly sample.\n\n394\n00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,210\nThat's what an audit is.\n\n395\n00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,170\nLet's reach in to the pool, pull out\na sample of what's going on with traffic,\n\n396\n00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,730\nwith profiles, with system builds.\n\n397\n00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,944\nAnd then let's make sure that what\nyou're telling us is there is\n\n398\n00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:16,767\nreally there, right?\n\n399\n00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,218\nNo nasty surprises.\n\n400\n00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,396\nLet's take a look at\nthe output of that audit and\n\n401\n00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:23,186\nlet's try to figure out how to\nimprove what we're finding.\n\n402\n00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:25,709\nBecause I promise you,\nwherever you do an audit,\n\n403\n00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,300\nthere's gonna be something\nthat you can improve.\n\n404\n00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,530\nNot because you're not doing a great job,\nbut because the reality is there's so much\n\n405\n00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,110\nto focus on, that just as an individual\neffort you're never gonna get everything.\n\n406\n00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,080\nAnd even as a team you're\ngonna miss things.\n\n407\n00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,498\nBecause everybody's\nspecializes in certain things.\n\n408\n00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:44,470\nAnd some things those things just\nare those things that fly under the radar.\n\n409\n00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,040\nWhatever they are.\n\n410\n00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,300\nSo we want to improve.\n\n411\n00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,110\nAlmost like a continual service thought\nprocess, continual service improvement.\n\n412\n00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,110\nAnd then we wanna apply that improvement\nin such a way that we are securing systems\n\n413\n00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,520\nas opposed to rendering them less secure.\n\n414\n00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,130\nSo our base line measurement is\nalways is are we more secure today\n\n415\n00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,820\nthan we were yesterday?\n\n416\n00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,210\nOr at a minimum, and I hate to say at\na minimum when we talk about security\n\n417\n00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,310\nbecause that implies it's okay to do\nthis and nothing more and you get by.\n\n418\n00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,830\nBut if you're gonna go skating for\nawhile and really not do much.\n\n419\n00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,820\nAre we at least as secure\ntoday as we were yesterday?\n\n420\n00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,210\nSo we wanna maintain at\na minimum our security posture,\n\n421\n00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,440\nif not improve it on an ongoing basis.\n\n422\n00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,510\nIt's when we fall backwards,\nright, we become less secure,\n\n423\n00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,090\nthat we really start to worry about\nwhat that ultimate activity is and\n\n424\n00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,070\nwhat we're doing in order to fix that.\n\n425\n00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,440\nWe have to roll back and\ndo different things.\n\n426\n00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,880\n>> And you know, at the end of the day,\nif we take a break,\n\n427\n00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,590\nwell we stop improving our network,\nbut the outside forces, the attackers.\n\n428\n00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,950\n>> Oh the dark forces,\nthe forces of no good.\n\n429\n00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,348\n>> That does sound kind of ominous,\nwhen I put it that way.\n\n430\n00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:51,190\nBut anyhow,\nthey don't take a break, right!\n\n431\n00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,420\nThey dont take a break cuz there's\nmore than one of them and so\n\n432\n00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,710\nwhen one of them is not doing something,\nsomeone else is.\n\n433\n00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,410\nAnd there's perpetually\nnew exploits coming out so\n\n434\n00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,150\neven when you do take a break\nthere need to be automated\n\n435\n00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,580\nsystems that are continuing\nto protect your network.\n\n436\n00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,480\nSo if you have antivirus,\n\n437\n00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,300\nit needs to continue to update\neven when you're not there.\n\n438\n00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,690\nYou don't want something manual\nthat's dependent on you.\n\n439\n00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,250\nThese are all things that we just\nhave to consider as part of our\n\n440\n00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,554\nnormal security operations.\n\n441\n00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,120\n>> Absolutely, so just to be clear\nI wanna make sure I understood.\n\n442\n00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,510\nSo you're telling me that it's number one\n\n443\n00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,580\nvery important for\nsecurity professionals to pay attention.\n\n444\n00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,214\nI wanna make sure I got this.\n\n445\n00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:33,140\nAnd then number two that there are dark\nforces out there looking to do us harm.\n\n446\n00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,380\nWe need some ominous music\nwhen we say that, by the way.\n\n447\n00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,087\nSo dark forces looking to do us harm and\nthat they're never going to rest and stop.\n\n448\n00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:43,340\nEven though we take a break,\nthey're gonna keep coming.\n\n449\n00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,400\nThat's shocking.\n\n450\n00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,380\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n451\n00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,817\n>> You know what I think I have to\nchange careers, that's just horrible.\n\n452\n00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:48,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I want a career where\n\n453\n00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,920\nthere are unicorns and\nhappy smiley things right?\n\n454\n00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,160\n>> Rainbows and sunshine.\n\n455\n00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,770\n>> Rainbows and sunshine.\n\n456\n00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,000\nSo think about this, all kidding aside,\nright, we're joking around about this and\n\n457\n00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,190\nyou know obviously that we're joking.\n\n458\n00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,170\nBut there's a serious point to all this.\n\n459\n00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,680\nIf at the end of the day,\nyou can't be there 24 hours a day,\n\n460\n00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,240\nseven days a week doing what you do.\n\n461\n00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,440\nAnd you don't have a good robust,\nas Don pointed out, automated system or\n\n462\n00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,360\narchitecture of automated solutions,\nthis defense and depth concept\n\n463\n00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,955\nthat we've referred to as we've been\ndiscussing some of these things.\n\n464\n00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:24,180\nLayered defenses that will take on the job\nand the responsibility of watching\n\n465\n00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,960\non those entry points for you,\nwhen you're not there to do that.\n\n466\n00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,490\nHow are you possibly going to make\nsure that you have a secure solution?\n\n467\n00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,770\nHow are you gonna keep the information\nyou're charged with securing confidential?\n\n468\n00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,890\nEnsure integrity and ensure availability.\n\n469\n00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,874\nThere's no way to do that.\n\n470\n00:23:40,874 --> 00:23:45,617\nAnd so we have to really start to think\nabout what happens holistically in\n\n471\n00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:50,281\nour networks as a almost like a system\nthat we have to constantly groom,\n\n472\n00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:52,870\nmonitor, and maintain to your point.\n\n473\n00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,109\nAnd not something that's\njust under our control.\n\n474\n00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:59,462\nBut it's something that we share control\nwith the other systems, the monitoring,\n\n475\n00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:02,050\nthe various things we put in place and do.\n\n476\n00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,250\nAnd that we have to make\nsure we monitor and\n\n477\n00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,690\npay attention to that in order to\nmake sure it's being done correctly.\n\n478\n00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,800\nIt's like your car, right?\n\n479\n00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,110\nI mean you drive you're car.\n\n480\n00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,760\nYou're physically present there, but\n\n481\n00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,100\nwhen your car is sitting parked somewhere\nyou don't know what's going on with it.\n\n482\n00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,510\nYou may have an alarm,\nyou keep people from stealing it.\n\n483\n00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,140\nI'm not talking about that but you don't\nknow what's going on in the engine.\n\n484\n00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,180\nYou're not sure if you have a leak.\n\n485\n00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,620\nYou could park the car up.\n\n486\n00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,370\nA hose could suddenly decide it\nwants to separate from the binding,\n\n487\n00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,570\nwherever the clip is that's\nholding it onto the engine.\n\n488\n00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,810\nAnd you want to be aware of that if you\ndon't have a monitoring system in place.\n\n489\n00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,420\nSo when you turn the car on\nthe dashboard lights up and\n\n490\n00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,080\nthe systems verify that\nthey have integrity.\n\n491\n00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,590\nAnd if there's a leak, a loss of pressure,\na loss of fluid, you get a warning light.\n\n492\n00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,760\nIf you don't have those automated systems.\n\n493\n00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,040\nYou obviously could do yourself and\nthe car a tremendous amount of damage by\n\n494\n00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,990\ntrying to drive it when you don't have\nfluid or whatever it may be in there.\n\n495\n00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,560\nI know this cuz I got my oil\nchanged a few weeks ago,\n\n496\n00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,180\nthe [COUGH] oil change professional,\nI'll use that term loosely by the way.\n\n497\n00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,500\nThe oil change professional, did not.\n\n498\n00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,800\nI actually had a very interesting car,\nI had two oil filters that I had,\n\n499\n00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,790\nwe actually share a brand and so, we have\ntwo oil filters in the engine that we use.\n\n500\n00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,350\nOne on the top and one on the bottom.\n\n501\n00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,980\nThe one on the top was not\nreset properly in the o-ring.\n\n502\n00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,860\nAnd as a result, oil comes shooting out of\nthe engine block when I start the engine!\n\n503\n00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,190\nI didn't realize this because I\nhad enough oil to make it home.\n\n504\n00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,250\nAnd I parked the car up overnight.\n\n505\n00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,170\nAnd I have a slight\nincline on my driveway.\n\n506\n00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,560\nAnd so, when I get out in the morning,\ncuz I'm getting ready to take a trip.\n\n507\n00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,480\nI think I was actually ready to\ncome up here to see you guys.\n\n508\n00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,760\nWhen I got ready, I started the car up and\n\n509\n00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,520\nlet it warm up for\na minute, and I pulled out.\n\n510\n00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,640\nAnd I see this just ocean of oil\ncoming down my driveway at me.\n\n511\n00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,770\nAnd I said, oh this can't be good.\n\n512\n00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,010\nAnd so I stopped the car and I had to wind\nup getting it towed back to the dealer.\n\n513\n00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,870\nBut I found out that they didn't set\nthe top cap properly cuz the o-ring got\n\n514\n00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,300\nfolded over as they were going\nto put the filter back on.\n\n515\n00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,830\nSo yeah, this is the kind of thing that\nmonitoring can help you understand\n\n516\n00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,760\nbecause this is the kind\nof thing you can avoid.\n\n517\n00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,460\nSo when you get your oil changed,\nalways make sure you have two oil filters.\n\n518\n00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,300\n>> Yeah, and for a trained professional,\nsomebody who has obviously been through\n\n519\n00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,410\nminutes of oil change training\nlike that to make a mistake.\n\n520\n00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,220\n>> Shocking.\n\n521\n00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,530\nShocking.\n>> It just shows that\n\n522\n00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,640\nanybody can make a mistake.\n\n523\n00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,150\n>> Absolutely.\n\n524\n00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:12,850\nAbsolutely.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n525\n00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,620\n>> Highly trained,\n\n526\n00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,610\nhighly skilled professionals boys and\ngirls.\n\n527\n00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,170\nAll right so\ndetermining what is acceptable.\n\n528\n00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,870\nThis is kinda what we've been hinting at.\n\n529\n00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,840\nThis is important.\n\n530\n00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,720\nSo, what is the acceptable activity?\n\n531\n00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,790\nClearly, making sure that we have network\ntraffic that is flowing, if it is supposed\n\n532\n00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,890\nto be hidden from view in encrypted\nprotocols.That's gonna be acceptable.\n\n533\n00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,565\nIf we have open traffic that is\nflowing in a non-encrypted channel,\n\n534\n00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:34,585\nthat's unacceptable.\n\n535\n00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:38,175\nIf we're focused on confidentiality and\nthat information needs to be secured.\n\n536\n00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:39,195\nHow do we know that?\n\n537\n00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:41,035\nWe have to define through policy.\n\n538\n00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:43,515\nWe have to make sure that if\nwe have standards in place,\n\n539\n00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:45,620\nwe're using those to\nmanage the governance.\n\n540\n00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,160\nAnd to manage the control\nelements in our networks.\n\n541\n00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,240\nWhat is acceptable system activity?\n\n542\n00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,590\nAre we using the system to be able\nto go out and browse the web and\n\n543\n00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,410\nmaybe do some eBay or\nAmazon shopping during our lunch break.\n\n544\n00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,850\nAnd that's probably not\nacceptable in most companies.\n\n545\n00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,720\nAre we watching sportscasts,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n546\n00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,620\nIf our team is playing during working\nhours probably again not acceptable.\n\n547\n00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,580\nSo we have to have acceptable policies and\nmanagement by policy.\n\n548\n00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,620\nUnacceptable versus\nacceptable very big thing for\n\n549\n00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,190\nus to think about when we're auditing.\n\n550\n00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,370\nThe auditor should be clearly able to\ndiscern what you feel the baseline for\n\n551\n00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,750\nnormal is in your network.\n\n552\n00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,690\nAnd acceptability is one of those\nkey criteria that we look at.\n\n553\n00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,910\nHave to make sure we have a way\nof understanding that and\n\n554\n00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,090\nvery clearly delineating\nthat in documented form.\n\n555\n00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,400\nCuz we have to validate that those\ncontrols are being followed appropriately.\n\n556\n00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,160\nAnd when we think about\nwhat we're gonna look at,\n\n557\n00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,330\nwe talk about areas of security audits.\n\n558\n00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,270\nWe wanna talk about different areas,\n\n559\n00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,540\ndifferent technology areas\nwe may be focused on.\n\n560\n00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,010\nYou can think of almost anything.\n\n561\n00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,170\nWe want to audit policies.\n\n562\n00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,110\nI've been talking about policies and\ntheir application.\n\n563\n00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,590\nYou want to make sure that the policies\nthemselves are being applied.\n\n564\n00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,780\nThat we understand them, that they're\nbeing documented, they're up to date.\n\n565\n00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,190\nThere's general awareness\nof these policies,\n\n566\n00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,040\nspread out through the organization.\n\n567\n00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,360\nThese are things to consider.\n\n568\n00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,490\nWant to make sure our standards that we're\nusing to govern are also up to date.\n\n569\n00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,820\nAnd that they're effective.\n\n570\n00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,220\nNothing worse than referencing\na standard that may be two or\n\n571\n00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,210\nthree years out of date as your\nguideline for doing things.\n\n572\n00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,820\nThen the auditor comes in and\nsays oh well, don't you know that PCI\n\n573\n00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,780\nis now 2.0 DSS instead of PCI 1,\nor 1.4 or whatever it was?\n\n574\n00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,470\nOr now 3?\n\n575\n00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,930\nAnd so you know you're using old standards\nand those standards are not appropriate.\n\n576\n00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,540\nYou're not doing all the new\nthing you have to do.\n\n577\n00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,320\nThat's a big issue.\n\n578\n00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,670\nAnd that's going to show a disconnect\nto an auditor that really fundamentally\n\n579\n00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,420\ngoes to the heart of our question.\n\n580\n00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,520\nOf whether or not you're managing\nyour network effectively.\n\n581\n00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,840\nIf you don't really understand\nsomething like a standard and\n\n582\n00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,450\nthe fact that it's not up to date.\n\n583\n00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,980\nWe're gonna question everything else\nyou are telling us you're doing.\n\n584\n00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,960\nNot because we don't think you are,\n\n585\n00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,890\nhonestly it is because we don't think you\nare, but we're not gonna tell you that.\n\n586\n00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,400\nBut because you've just basically set off,\na nuclear bomb\n\n587\n00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,350\ninside of your network by telling us that\nas far as you know, you're up to date.\n\n588\n00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,500\nAnd we're looking at the fact that you may\nbe two to three years out of compliance.\n\n589\n00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,670\nEverything else in other\nwords is now suspect.\n\n590\n00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,130\nBecause of the fact that this fundamental\nthing you're supposed to be doing\n\n591\n00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,630\nis being done to a different standard.\n\n592\n00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,916\nThan what is now considered\nto be acceptable.\n\n593\n00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,573\nYou're application security.\n\n594\n00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:14,340\nAre we're going to be looking at\nwhat applications you're running,\n\n595\n00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,240\nwhat version of applications,\nwhy are you running them.\n\n596\n00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,730\nI love walking into\nsomeones network seeing\n\n597\n00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,980\na whole bunch of people running\naccess running project running VIZEO.\n\n598\n00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,920\nNot because I have a great love or\naffinity for Microsoft do or don't.\n\n599\n00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,030\nBut because I wondered\nto myself how much money\n\n600\n00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,570\nis in the licensing budget at\nthis company first of all.\n\n601\n00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:37,890\nBecause they're clearly spending a lot\nof money to give people software.\n\n602\n00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:42,870\nAnd then the second thing I often wonder\nis how much of that is really being used.\n\n603\n00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,060\nHow may people really need access?\n\n604\n00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,110\nHow many people need VISIO?\n\n605\n00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,450\nAnd what you often find is,\neverybody says they want it.\n\n606\n00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,080\nIt's that nice to have, need to have,\ngotta have kind of thing.\n\n607\n00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,430\nAnd everybody wants the new pretty,\n\n608\n00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,660\nshiny thing that you chase, whatever that\npurple squirrel is off in the corner.\n\n609\n00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,830\nSo I want that but\nthen I don't ever use it for anything.\n\n610\n00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,610\nAnd so what we now have is a situation.\n\n611\n00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,160\nWhere we've got a lot of excess\ninventory weighing that system down,\n\n612\n00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,130\nrunning, potentially opening\na security liability for us.\n\n613\n00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,260\nAnd we now have an issue because our\nbaseline Includes software that's not\n\n614\n00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:12,865\nbeing utilized.\n\n615\n00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:15,700\nSo now we're having to manage\nthe liability of that software.\n\n616\n00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,710\nNot just the financial impact, but\nthe liability from a security perspective.\n\n617\n00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,290\n>> Yeah and there are several well known\nexploits that affect like Microsoft Word,\n\n618\n00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:23,820\nand so on.\n\n619\n00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,250\nAnd so if people are running\nsoftware they don't need.\n\n620\n00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,470\nYou're unnecessarily increasing\nyour attack surface.\n\n621\n00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,700\nAnd anything we can do to minimize that\nis something we should absolutely do.\n\n622\n00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,080\n>> Absolutely, and you know,\nthings like firewalls, right.\n\n623\n00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,560\nAre we looking at\nthe configuration of firewalls?\n\n624\n00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,770\nI remember from the prior episode we\nwere talking about where we talked about\n\n625\n00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,250\ngetting rid of safe removal of\nhardware and hardware disposal.\n\n626\n00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,040\nAnd you shared with us the idea that you\nknow at one point you'd worked somewhere\n\n627\n00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,240\nwhere you picked up a device on the cheap.\n\n628\n00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,990\nAnd it actually still had the config\nin it from the prior owner.\n\n629\n00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,290\nAnd I hear that a lot and\nI see that a lot.\n\n630\n00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,540\nAnd this kind of thing is important\nbecause when we audit firewalls or\n\n631\n00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,830\nrouters by the way, because routers\nfall into this category as well.\n\n632\n00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,040\nThey both store configurations, and\n\n633\n00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,920\nyou have to make sure those\nconfiguration files are stored securely.\n\n634\n00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,260\nSo are you encrypting\nthe passwords in those files, for\n\n635\n00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,720\ninstance, or are they not encrypted?\n\n636\n00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,430\nAnd it's very simple, literally, one line\nin a Cisco IOS to turn on encryption\n\n637\n00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,050\non the firewall or on the router.\n\n638\n00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,420\nBut you may or may not have that\nenabled and we're gonna look at that.\n\n639\n00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,280\nIf you're using newer gateway devices,\nmaybe Meraki devicesfor instance,\n\n640\n00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,010\na lot of these things\nare cloud managed today.\n\n641\n00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,410\nSo if you're doing these things,\nare you going in and\n\n642\n00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,660\nwalking through that config to\nunderstand what's in there?\n\n643\n00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,420\nAnd turning off the services\nthat are not needed?\n\n644\n00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,350\nA lot of these are turned on\nby default and not necessary.\n\n645\n00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,130\nAnd are you then enabling those next three\nor four layers down on the defense model.\n\n646\n00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,280\nThat are really gonna bring together\nthis idea of securing information?\n\n647\n00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,730\nBut most importantly are you\ndocumenting that you've done that?\n\n648\n00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,421\nWhen we walk into a network and\nwanna see your documentation,\n\n649\n00:31:50,421 --> 00:31:52,968\nyou have to be able to prove\nto us that you're doing stuff.\n\n650\n00:31:52,968 --> 00:31:56,963\nNot by going to the box and turning it on\nand showing it to me But showing it to me\n\n651\n00:31:56,963 --> 00:32:00,223\nin a book and then letting me\nrandomly sample what I wanna see.\n\n652\n00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:03,527\nAnd that's the thing a lot of security\nprofessionals don't understand\n\n653\n00:32:03,527 --> 00:32:04,500\nabout audits.\n\n654\n00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,770\nIt's not show and\ntell in the traditional way.\n\n655\n00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,840\nWe're not gonna sit down and walk into\nyour network and look at everything.\n\n656\n00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,640\nWe're gonna randomly choose\nto look at things that\n\n657\n00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,950\nshould behave the same way you're\ntelling us they do in your run books.\n\n658\n00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,550\nAnd if we validate that, we're going to\nassume that the normal average is that\n\n659\n00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,240\nthose things all work the same way and\nso we're gonna randomly sample.\n\n660\n00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,740\nI've given you all the secrets\nof how we do auditing,\n\n661\n00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,860\nwhich means now all of\nyou can never leave.\n\n662\n00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,205\nYou're all stuck here with us forever.\n\n663\n00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:34,370\nBut let's wrap up this part\nof our conversation just by.\n\n664\n00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,220\nI kind of gave you the highlight of\nwhat the purpose of the audit is but\n\n665\n00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,900\nlet's quickly talk about what the purpose\nis just to make sure we validate that and\n\n666\n00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,680\nwe capture that.\n\n667\n00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,560\nSo we definitely want to verify all\nthe settings, the things we see.\n\n668\n00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,600\nBut, at a higher level.\n\n669\n00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,650\nWe wanna verify risk management and\n\n670\n00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,020\nreally understand that risk\nmanagement is happening.\n\n671\n00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,810\nThis is very, very important.\n\n672\n00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,960\nWe spend a lot of time\ntalking about risk and\n\n673\n00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,720\nchange in information security and\nthe impact it can have on our network.\n\n674\n00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,570\nAnd making sure we verify risk\nmanagement is taking place.\n\n675\n00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,530\nVery important.\n\n676\n00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,760\nWe also want to make sure,\nas we said, that all these controls,\n\n677\n00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,650\nwe've listed a lot of these items already.\n\n678\n00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,660\nAll these controls are in place and\nbeing followed and being used.\n\n679\n00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,750\nWant to make sure that we recommend\nthe improvements that we spoke about\n\n680\n00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,590\nwhen we talked about our\nlife cycle of monitor.\n\n681\n00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,110\nAnd then go through and analyze.\n\n682\n00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,810\nAnd then go through and apply remediation.\n\n683\n00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,450\nSo, create new security models,\nand then go through and\n\n684\n00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,340\nmake sure that we kinda start that\ncycle again through the improvement by\n\n685\n00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,980\ncontinuing to look at what we can do, and\ncontinuing to focus on monitoring and\n\n686\n00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,600\nanalysis, and creating new areas\nof opportunity to secure systems.\n\n687\n00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,380\nThese are all very important things.\n\n688\n00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,130\nSo, you need audits because\nyou have to address liability.\n\n689\n00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,630\nYou have to address negligence,\n\n690\n00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:47,450\nregulatory compliance, making sure that\nwherever there is an opportunity for\n\n691\n00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,620\nyou to do good you're focused on\nawareness and trying to do that.\n\n692\n00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,780\nAnd where there's an opportunity to\naddress threat risk vulnerability,\n\n693\n00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,910\nyou're looking to mitigate or\n\n694\n00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,480\nto use the language we use when\nwe talked about risk management.\n\n695\n00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,120\nMitigate or minimize, right?\n\n696\n00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,540\nRemember, we're never\ngonna zero out every risk.\n\n697\n00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,650\nWe're never gonna eliminate every\nopportunity to fail in a network when we\n\n698\n00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,090\ntalk about configurations, but\nwe are gonna minimize them if we're smart.\n\n699\n00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,890\nAnd we're gonna probably try to\nminimize the most impactful ones,\n\n700\n00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,540\nthe ones that are the highest impact.\n\n701\n00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,250\nBecause the ones that are little, kind of\ndown at the bottom, they're low impact,\n\n702\n00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,500\nlow urgency.\n\n703\n00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,580\nWe may not really be focused as much on\nbecause we're willing to take a small\n\n704\n00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,540\nhit on that in favor of focusing on\nthe bigger things that are really\n\n705\n00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,030\ngoing to ruin our day if we\nhave them come home to roost.\n\n706\n00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,734\nSo these are the overview things that\nwe wanna be thinking about as we start\n\n707\n00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:37,740\ntalking about security auditing and\nreally just thinking about what that is.\n\n708\n00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,150\nWe're going to continue our conversation\nand talk a little bit more about\n\n709\n00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,510\nthe function of the audit, how we set it\nup, and when we do it as we move into\n\n710\n00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,980\nanother episode but I just wanna make sure\nwe lay down the ground work here for you.\n\n711\n00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,030\nGive you an overview of auditing so\nyou understand the context and\n\n712\n00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,550\nthe perspective of how\nthe audit is achieved.\n\n713\n00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,840\nBut also, your role in it\nas a security professional.\n\n714\n00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,640\n>> Alright, well Adam this is\nprobably a pretty good spot for\n\n715\n00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,860\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n716\n00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,915\nSo what we'll do is\nwe'll take a pause here.\n\n717\n00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:03,675\nWhen we get back,\n\n718\n00:35:03,675 --> 00:35:06,555\nwe've kind of done our overview at this\npoint, so we're gonna do our drilldown and\n\n719\n00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:10,535\nstart targeting some individual topics,\nso definitely stay tuned for that.\n\n720\n00:35:10,535 --> 00:35:12,196\nAnd we'll be back after this.\n\n721\n00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:18,672\n[SOUND]\nAll right.\n\n722\n00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:19,290\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n723\n00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,950\nSo, in the last segment we kind of talked\nabout the general ideas of an audit\n\n724\n00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,020\npolicy, or\nwhat we perform during an audit.\n\n725\n00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,310\nNow, we are gonna take a look\nat some of the specifics.\n\n726\n00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,190\nAdam's gonna give us the kinda run-through\nof all the different things we need to\n\n727\n00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,485\ndeal with as we are performing that audit.\n\n728\n00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:33,040\n>> Okay.\n\n729\n00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,560\nLet's talk a bit about defining\nthe audit plan and what that looks like.\n\n730\n00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,080\nWe have a list that we\nwanna go through and\n\n731\n00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,900\nmake sure we're comfortable with\nin terms of the sequencing and so\n\n732\n00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,510\nwhen we start thinking about defining\nwhat an audit plan will look like,\n\n733\n00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,340\nwe're gonna go through approximately\nten steps as you can see on the screen.\n\n734\n00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,430\nWe're gonna define\nthe objectives of the audit.\n\n735\n00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,130\nWhat is the audit meant to accomplish?\n\n736\n00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,240\nIs it an audit that will be focused on,\nexcuse me,\n\n737\n00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,170\non compliance with a specific standard for\n\n738\n00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:05,180\ninstance maybe in the case of HIPPA or\nSarbanes-Oxley in the US?\n\n739\n00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,870\nPerhaps overseas if you're auditing and\nyou're doing a financial services audit.\n\n740\n00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,580\nAre you looking at a SAS,\nan S, A, S audit of some kind.\n\n741\n00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,630\nWhether it's a 70 or\none of those audits that may be done to\n\n742\n00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,880\nunderstand the financial dealings that\nare going on inside the company and\n\n743\n00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,970\nhow we're complying.\n\n744\n00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,430\nSo we wanna know what\nthe focus of the audit is.\n\n745\n00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,818\nIt may be just the systems audit.\n\n746\n00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:31,290\nWe may be going in and looking at some of\nthe systems and their configuration for\n\n747\n00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,720\na specific either project\nthat's being taken on and\n\n748\n00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,770\nportfolio management within the network or\nwithin the organization rather.\n\n749\n00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,320\nOr we may be doing an audit to be able to\nshow investors or potential investors in\n\n750\n00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,210\nthe company that we meet certain\nrequirements and certain standards they\n\n751\n00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,240\nhave around information security\nbefore they'll do business with us.\n\n752\n00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,120\nThere's a lot of different reasons\nwhy audits may take place.\n\n753\n00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,420\nSo define the objective.\n\n754\n00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,960\nUnderstand roles and responsibilities.\n\n755\n00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,610\nWho is going to be in charge of the audit?\n\n756\n00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,290\nWho's gonna be on the audit team?\n\n757\n00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,120\nWho's gonna be asked to\nsupport the audit and\n\n758\n00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,880\nthe requirements that are gonna be fed\nfrom the auditors to those support teams?\n\n759\n00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,880\nHow are we gonna communicate those things?\n\n760\n00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,480\nSo really what does the team\nlook like around the audit,\n\n761\n00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,870\nand what are they gonna do?\n\n762\n00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,970\nWhat are their responsibilities and roles?\n\n763\n00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,950\nThis is very important because we don't\nwant, in the middle of the audit process,\n\n764\n00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,650\nto have to go out and\nfind somebody to do something that\n\n765\n00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,980\nwe didn't really clearly understand would\nbe appropriate or needed before hand.\n\n766\n00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,960\nAudits take time, I should say.\n\n767\n00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,710\nBut auditors are paid by the hour, and\nso you hire a company to come in and\n\n768\n00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,190\nto do this and\nyou're engaging them to come in and\n\n769\n00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,880\nspend a certain amount of time to give\nyou an overview of your network and\n\n770\n00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,920\ngive you ultimately a report\nat the end of this process.\n\n771\n00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,950\nIf you delay that activity because you're\nnot prepared with the proper resources,\n\n772\n00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,862\nit's gonna cost you more\nmoney at the end of the day.\n\n773\n00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:54,480\nAuditors won't like sitting\naround doing nothing, but\n\n774\n00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,820\nthey will still bill you\nwhether they're working or not.\n\n775\n00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,790\nSo just be aware of that and\nunderstand that, right?\n\n776\n00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,240\nUnderstand resources, so specifically when\nwe talk about resources you can see here.\n\n777\n00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,950\nWe have this idea laid out\nof two kinds of resources.\n\n778\n00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,130\nHuman capital, human resources,\nso the people involved.\n\n779\n00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,460\nAs well as the focus, the machines and\nthe systems that are going to be part of\n\n780\n00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,170\nthat overall drive towards\nwhat it is we need to do.\n\n781\n00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,980\nWe really do focus on the personnel or\nhuman resources when we talk about\n\n782\n00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,680\nan audit because we may have to pull\npeople in, we may have to get them to talk\n\n783\n00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,540\nabout certain things, and produce reports,\nand do the things they need to do.\n\n784\n00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,110\nAnd they have to be members of the team in\norder to be responsible for doing that.\n\n785\n00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,140\nWe don't want to forget there\nare systems involved as well.\n\n786\n00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,180\nJust want to look at all those resources.\n\n787\n00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,940\nWe want to review previous audits if\nwe've had audits done on a rolling basis.\n\n788\n00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,580\nMost companies are doing\naudits at least once a year,\n\n789\n00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,380\nespecially if they're publicly traded\ncompanies they are definitely doing audits\n\n790\n00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,480\nat least once a year.\n\n791\n00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,100\nPerhaps more than once a year\ndepending on vertical or\n\n792\n00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,900\nsilo that you are in in\nterms of your industry.\n\n793\n00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,720\nAnd as a result of that we're gonna\nhave typically a historical wealth of\n\n794\n00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,570\ninformation that we can go back to and\nlook at prior years findings.\n\n795\n00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:04,060\nFindings are the red X's you get on your\naudits that tell you that you have things\n\n796\n00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,300\nto improve on and as a result of that, we\ncan then look at whether we have improved.\n\n797\n00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,826\nWhether we have made\nprogress in those areas.\n\n798\n00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:13,760\nOr perhaps we still have this rolling or\nrecurring issue\n\n799\n00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,340\nthat we have to address and\nbe aware of that as auditors come back in.\n\n800\n00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,890\nDefining the scope of the audit.\n\n801\n00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,090\nWhat will the audit be focused on.\n\n802\n00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,830\nWe talked about the objectives and the\nobjectives are important as a high level\n\n803\n00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,130\nstatement of what we're going\nto accomplish in the audit.\n\n804\n00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,280\nBut then the scope is really the focus, so\n\n805\n00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,080\nwe're narrowing the audit when we\ntalk about defining the scope, and\n\n806\n00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,240\ndefining the scope is really what\nare we going to be looking at.\n\n807\n00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,860\nAre we gonna be looking at\njust the web services, and\n\n808\n00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,980\nif so,\nare those web servers all in one area?\n\n809\n00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,623\nAre we gonna be looking at them in the DMZ\nas well as behind the DMZ and the LAN?\n\n810\n00:39:48,623 --> 00:39:51,917\nAre we looking at them from the outside\nperspective, from the customer's\n\n811\n00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:55,588\nperspective, only from the inside,\nfrom the service provider's perspective?\n\n812\n00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:58,918\nThese are scope related items that we\nwould address when we talk about scoping\n\n813\n00:39:58,918 --> 00:39:59,442\nand audit.\n\n814\n00:39:59,442 --> 00:40:01,533\nConducting a site survey.\n\n815\n00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:05,412\nWhere we're gonna come in and look at\nwhat's going on in your network, so\n\n816\n00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:09,543\nto speak, look at the physical as well\nas the logical layout and understand and\n\n817\n00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:11,840\ndocument what we're finding there.\n\n818\n00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,530\nSo we're gonna wanna understand how to\nmake sure that we know where things are.\n\n819\n00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,710\nStupid and silly things like where\nthe bathrooms are because auditors do need\n\n820\n00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,700\nto use the restroom on occasion, right?\n\n821\n00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,950\nBut also more important things like\nwhere is the network operations center,\n\n822\n00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:28,210\nwhere is the NOC so we know where\nto go and find that information.\n\n823\n00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,040\nIs there a working area that we're\ngonna be set up in all the time, and\n\n824\n00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,310\nif so, do we have the appropriate\naccess we need to other buildings,\n\n825\n00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,920\nother areas of the campus if we\nhave more than one building.\n\n826\n00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,080\nAll these things are going\nto be part of a site survey.\n\n827\n00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,900\nWe're going to want to know about all\nthat and actually if we go back up to\n\n828\n00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,710\nstep number five I want to make one point\nthere on defining the scope of an audit.\n\n829\n00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,950\nIn project management terminology,\nwhen we talk about being a project manager\n\n830\n00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:56,460\nwe have our own language there, we've\nreferred to the PM in previous episodes.\n\n831\n00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,440\nThe idea of defining a scope of an audit\nwould be considered a statement of work,\n\n832\n00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,230\nwhat we call a SOW inside of\nthe project management world,\n\n833\n00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,580\nin the project management language so\nto speak.\n\n834\n00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,290\nThis is really what's gonna guide us and\n\n835\n00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,380\ntell us what it is we're\nexpected to accomplish.\n\n836\n00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,260\nWhen we go through and\na statement fo work, fo as opposed to of.\n\n837\n00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,130\nLike foo, right?\n\n838\n00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:17,730\nStatement of work.\n\n839\n00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:21,080\n>> Yeah, I'm trying to keep\nwith the modern lexicon, slang.\n\n840\n00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,420\n>> Okay, so statement of work.\n\n841\n00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,320\nSo the SoW is what we're\ngonna be focused on.\n\n842\n00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,750\nAnd I'm not suggesting that the scope of\nthe auditors call the Statement of Work\n\n843\n00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,600\nnecessarily.\n\n844\n00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,160\nBut just making a connection for you,\nto understand that in project management\n\n845\n00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,940\nterminology, this is\nroughly what we're doing.\n\n846\n00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,090\nAnd when we go back up, [INAUDIBLE] I'll\ngive you the reference for one other area.\n\n847\n00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,450\nWhen we are understanding roles and\nresponsibilities and\n\n848\n00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:46,380\nunderstanding resources, items two and\nthree, what we're doing there effectively\n\n849\n00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,800\nin project management speak is basically\nlooking at a work breakdown structure.\n\n850\n00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,980\nA WBS is what we would be really\nthinking about defining or\n\n851\n00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,600\nat least starting to understand how to\ndraft in this area, kinda combing two and\n\n852\n00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,440\nthree together because\nthat is what we're doing.\n\n853\n00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,950\nAnd then when we look at item number one,\ndefining the objectives.\n\n854\n00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,200\nThat would be like setting\nup a project charter, and\n\n855\n00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,500\nwe use the language of\nproject management here.\n\n856\n00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,410\nSo, this would be almost like\nsetting up a charter, and\n\n857\n00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:18,520\na charter is our overall statement\nof intent for the project.\n\n858\n00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,620\nAnd we use that to,\n\n859\n00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,410\nat a high level communicate what\nthe project will accomplish.\n\n860\n00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:25,640\nAll of the stakeholders and people that\nmay be interested in what we're doing.\n\n861\n00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,470\nSo giving you some parallels\nthere just to make sure you're\n\n862\n00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,320\ncomfortable with the langauge, but giving\nyou some different ways of looking at\n\n863\n00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,810\nthis to have a better understanding\nof what we're accomplishing.\n\n864\n00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:36,330\nAll right, so\nwe are down to conducting a site survey.\n\n865\n00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,250\nWe just talked about that so,\nreviewing documentation.\n\n866\n00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,750\nWe're gonna go through and look at all\nthe documentation that we have there and\n\n867\n00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,130\nso this may be a variety\nof things by the way.\n\n868\n00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,240\nWe have some specific items in number\neight called out for logs, but\n\n869\n00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,020\nunder review documentation maybe\nwe wanna make a couple sub points.\n\n870\n00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,710\nSo for instance run books would be\na good idea to talk about here.\n\n871\n00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,800\nSo your run books will be the day to\nday operational manuals that you keep\n\n872\n00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,660\ntypically.\n\n873\n00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,990\nOn various procedures and processes.\n\n874\n00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,150\nAnd that would be part of\nthe documentation that we may review.\n\n875\n00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,700\nWe may also want to see your logical and\ntechnical diagrams.\n\n876\n00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:16,060\nLogical, physical, technical diagrams\nof all of the networking architectures.\n\n877\n00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,050\nWe may wanna look at those\nunder documentation.\n\n878\n00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,290\nWe may wanna see your policies and\nyour procedures.\n\n879\n00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:25,690\nThese typically are the things that we\nwill ask you for as we look at review or\n\n880\n00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,400\nengage as auditors do in\nreviewing documentation.\n\n881\n00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,830\nWhen we talk about reviewing logs,\n\n882\n00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,855\nyou'll see here we have two logs called\nthat way of host logs, host-based logs.\n\n883\n00:43:35,855 --> 00:43:38,305\nWe have incident-based logs,\nor incident logs, as well.\n\n884\n00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:41,475\nWe'll wanna take a look at these, not\ncuz we're looking for anything specific,\n\n885\n00:43:41,475 --> 00:43:45,045\nalthough there may be reasons why, at this\npoint, we're looking at those logs so\n\n886\n00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:46,545\nwe'll drill in on something.\n\n887\n00:43:46,545 --> 00:43:48,895\nBut we probably are just looking for\nevidence overall,\n\n888\n00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:50,895\nthe fact that AU have logs.\n\n889\n00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:51,715\nRight?\n\n890\n00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:53,800\nHow far back historically do they go?\n\n891\n00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,650\nAre they being reviewed on\na somewhat regular basis?\n\n892\n00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,390\nAnd how are you storing them securely for\nlong-term review and\n\n893\n00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,840\nfor long-term archival processing so\n\n894\n00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,170\nthat we have a historical record of\ntrend we can look back at over time?\n\n895\n00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,510\nWe review risk analysis, so we go back and\n\n896\n00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,960\nlook at what the risk analysis has been\non this particular area, whatever it is.\n\n897\n00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,900\nAnd we will review it to make sure we\nare up to date with what's going on.\n\n898\n00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,350\nAnd then review penetration testing.\n\n899\n00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,480\nWanna make sure we look at whatever\nthe outcomes of the penetration tests that\n\n900\n00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,590\nhave been running against\nthe network maintenance may be.\n\n901\n00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:28,910\nWanna have a report of that hopefully\nfrom whoever the pen testing company was.\n\n902\n00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:33,080\nAnd the auditors will want to look at that\nto validate that you have done physical\n\n903\n00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,980\nas well as logical testing to make sure\nthat your security controls are in place,\n\n904\n00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,910\nthey're working properly, and if any holes\nwere identified and realistically there\n\n905\n00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,830\nmight be some that you have a remediation\nplan in place in place to deal with them.\n\n906\n00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,450\nYou've clearly logged and\nidentified the risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n907\n00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,070\nAnd you now are planning\nto manage them actively.\n\n908\n00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,010\nSo, as we work through the logic of this,\n\n909\n00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,620\nthis is really how an audit\nplan comes together.\n\n910\n00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,150\nStart to finish if you will.\n\n911\n00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,250\nThis is, if we look at the ten step\nprocess we've just laid out for\n\n912\n00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:03,400\nyou, how you would plan out and\nlay out an audit.\n\n913\n00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,050\nReally from beginning to end in terms\nof the logical high level steps\n\n914\n00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,540\nthat have to be engaged in.\n\n915\n00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,410\nYour auditors, whoever they\nare will come through with their\n\n916\n00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,670\nspecific plan you know\ntheir take on things.\n\n917\n00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:17,280\nHow they will in effect\nlook to execute an audit.\n\n918\n00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,830\nAnd it will look similar to this.\n\n919\n00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,840\nIt may not use this exact language.\n\n920\n00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,140\nIt may not have all the steps clearly\nidentified laid out this way,\n\n921\n00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,230\nthey may combine some things together.\n\n922\n00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,750\nFor instance,\nreview documentation, review logs.\n\n923\n00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,810\nYou just may push all that\nup into one point and\n\n924\n00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:35,340\njust simply say review pertinent\ndocumentation on network structure.\n\n925\n00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,950\nBut the reality is that these are the\nsteps that are gonna be engaged in for\n\n926\n00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,076\nyou to walk through an audit.\n\n927\n00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:43,820\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n928\n00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,390\nNow, where do these steps come from?\n\n929\n00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,650\nWhat is the methodology\nthat we're defining here?\n\n930\n00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,950\nThere are some standards\nto look at externally.\n\n931\n00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,020\nThings to at least be aware of,\nthat again, as security practitioners,\n\n932\n00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,530\nyou may wanna go out and\ndrill down on a little bit and\n\n933\n00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,610\nget a little better understanding\nof these processes.\n\n934\n00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:03,020\nThere is an ISO set of ISO standards,\nI should say, that deal with this.\n\n935\n00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,540\nThe ISO 27000 series, Which deals\nwith information security management\n\n936\n00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,120\noverall holistically,\ndoes have things to say.\n\n937\n00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,290\nThe 27,000 not 20,000.\n\n938\n00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,390\nTwo seven.\n\n939\n00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,000\nThe 27,000 series deals with these.\n\n940\n00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,760\nSo you want to take a look at those.\n\n941\n00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,035\nThere's a lot of emerging\nstandards in the ISOS 27,000 area.\n\n942\n00:46:23,035 --> 00:46:28,210\nNIST as we've talked about in some prior\nepisodes has a special publication around\n\n943\n00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,710\nthe guidelines for security certification\nand accreditation as well as auditing.\n\n944\n00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,580\nThis is really focused on\nthe US federal government,\n\n945\n00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,620\nand those standards are focused on there,\nbut\n\n946\n00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,670\nit's a good representation of\nthe kinds of methodologies.\n\n947\n00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:49,180\nThe NIST standard or the NIST, excuse me,\nspecial publication number is SP800-37.\n\n948\n00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,740\nAnd remember SP stands for\n\n949\n00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,420\nSpecial Publication when we\ntalked on this documentation.\n\n950\n00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,390\nAnd there's also ITIL.\n\n951\n00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,820\nWe've talked a little bit\nabout frameworks before, and\n\n952\n00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:02,020\nITIL is going to offer us guidance on a\nvariety of things like change management.\n\n953\n00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:06,630\nIncident management, problem management,\nrisk analysis, business impact\n\n954\n00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,130\nanalysis and all the things that go\ninto making sure we're prepared for\n\n955\n00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,120\nstandardization, and as a result,\nwe're prepared to go through an audit.\n\n956\n00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,690\nSo these are some good starting points for\nyou.\n\n957\n00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,910\nThere are many other places for\nyou to look for information by the way.\n\n958\n00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,870\nThis is really just a starting point.\n\n959\n00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:24,080\nYou could look at another framework that\nwe've talked about in the past which\n\n960\n00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,140\nis Cobit.\n\n961\n00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,840\nCobit is going to be a framework regarding\nor focused on IT security governance.\n\n962\n00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,650\nAnd so really making sure that we\nunderstand how to control information\n\n963\n00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,390\nin relation to security is\ngonna be the focus there.\n\n964\n00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:40,790\nThe IIA yellow and red books would be\nanother good example of this as well.\n\n965\n00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,610\nAnd so you want to make sure you're\nthinking about those things.\n\n966\n00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,030\nYou may be able to go out and develop\nyour own processes internally by the way.\n\n967\n00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,647\nThis may just be some internal mind\nshare that you've come up with, but\n\n968\n00:47:50,647 --> 00:47:54,831\nthese internal processes may prove to be\nvery valuable for you as a business also.\n\n969\n00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,608\nSo, Just be aware of that.\n\n970\n00:47:56,608 --> 00:47:59,615\nSo now that we've laid out kind of\nthe high level thought process,\n\n971\n00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:01,720\nthe structure of what\nan audit will look like.\n\n972\n00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,660\nWe talked a little bit about where\nsome of the standards may come from.\n\n973\n00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,710\nLet's talk about the different\nways we collect data.\n\n974\n00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:10,370\nBecause really an audit is about show and\ntell.\n\n975\n00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:11,210\nAnd I don't know about you, but\n\n976\n00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:14,580\nwhen I was a little kid in school, I used\nto really look forward to show and tell.\n\n977\n00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,300\nBecause I'd bring in my toys I'd be\nable to play with the other kids\n\n978\n00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,800\nexplain to them or\nshow them you know what I was doing.\n\n979\n00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,100\nLearn a little bit from them\nabout what they did and\n\n980\n00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,530\nthey usually had cooler toys than I did so\nit was a lot of fun.\n\n981\n00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:29,342\nRight, so when we talk about show and tell\nwe're talking about collecting data that\n\n982\n00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:34,355\nwe're then going to wrap up and present to\nan auditor if they have a need to see it.\n\n983\n00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:36,295\nNow again,\nthere are a variety of mechanism and\n\n984\n00:48:36,295 --> 00:48:39,385\nwe'll throw them out at you in\njust a minute and go through them.\n\n985\n00:48:39,385 --> 00:48:43,807\nThere is also a reason, a methodology\nbehind information collection or\n\n986\n00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:44,997\ncollecting of data.\n\n987\n00:48:44,997 --> 00:48:49,737\nWe want to have a repository,\nkind of a pristine place we can go to,\n\n988\n00:48:49,737 --> 00:48:53,457\nsee the historical record of the data, and\nmake sure that we have the ability to look\n\n989\n00:48:53,457 --> 00:48:57,297\nback and be able to understand what was\ngoing on at a certain point in time.\n\n990\n00:48:57,297 --> 00:49:00,437\nSo things like log files obviously\nfalling in this category, but\n\n991\n00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,540\nit's going to be more than just that,\nright?\n\n992\n00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,810\nWe're just batting 1000 on that\nspelling thing today, aren't we?\n\n993\n00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:05,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n994\n00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,070\n>> That's why I switched to this program\n\n995\n00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,841\nthat's got a spell checker,\nso I know when I'm wrong.\n\n996\n00:49:08,841 --> 00:49:09,516\n[LAUGH]\n\n997\n00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:10,266\n>> Absolutely.\n\n998\n00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:11,016\nAll right, so\n\n999\n00:49:11,016 --> 00:49:15,141\nthings like questionnaires, right?\nWe may go out and ask end users or\n\n1000\n00:49:15,141 --> 00:49:18,520\ncustomers of our solution\nquestions about things.\n\n1001\n00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,900\nSo we may ask them questions, we may\nsend those questions electronically,\n\n1002\n00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,920\nmay interview them.\n\n1003\n00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,912\nThough interviewing is\nmore of a personalized,\n\n1004\n00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:28,680\nface-to-face thing as opposed to just\ngenerically filling out a questionnaire.\n\n1005\n00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,590\nWe may observe.\n\n1006\n00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,550\nWe may just go in and\nmonitor and observe for\n\n1007\n00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,820\na period of time to see what's going on.\n\n1008\n00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,690\nWe usually will have checklists to tell\nus we have to go do certain things at\n\n1009\n00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,440\na certain point in time.\n\n1010\n00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,610\nWe'll take a look at documentation,\nas I mentioned.\n\n1011\n00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,730\nWe'll take a look at policies.\n\n1012\n00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,050\nWe'll take a look at logs.\n\n1013\n00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,720\nSo anything under existing\ndocumentation generically.\n\n1014\n00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,210\nWould fall into that category.\n\n1015\n00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,310\nAnd we will perform, and\nwe can write them down.\n\n1016\n00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:58,000\nSo policies, logs, configurations would\nbe another good one to put there.\n\n1017\n00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,520\nAnd then we will go through and\nperform security testing.\n\n1018\n00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,170\nSecurity testing is also\ngonna be very important.\n\n1019\n00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,880\nBecause we wanna make sure\nthat we are validating\n\n1020\n00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,970\nall the things that we think may again or\nmay not be happening.\n\n1021\n00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:15,255\nIn the IT world if you work in a company\nthat does either developmental process,\n\n1022\n00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:16,300\ndevelopment of projects.\n\n1023\n00:50:17,345 --> 00:50:21,355\nWe call security testing\nwhen we are looking at\n\n1024\n00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:24,485\nthe structure of our network and\nlooking at what's going on.\n\n1025\n00:50:24,485 --> 00:50:28,065\nAnd we call that eating our own dog food,\nright, generically in IT.\n\n1026\n00:50:28,065 --> 00:50:31,195\nBecause the idea is that basically\nyou're actually doing the things and\n\n1027\n00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,975\nconsuming the things that your customers\ndo in the same way to validate whether or\n\n1028\n00:50:34,975 --> 00:50:36,360\nnot it's actually working.\n\n1029\n00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,110\nAnd so when I worked internally for\n\n1030\n00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:43,020\ninstance at Microsoft as what's\ncalled a vdash a vendor.\n\n1031\n00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:48,010\nWhen I spent some time out there for about\na year working in the enterprise group.\n\n1032\n00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,350\nAnd I spent some time managing training\nand doing a bunch of stuff for them yet we\n\n1033\n00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:56,600\nhad to use Microsoft Zone products in our\nnetwork and on our laptops and whatever.\n\n1034\n00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,320\nAt that time they were getting ready\nto roll out, this was prior to\n\n1035\n00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,950\nWindows 7 launching, or actually prior\nto Vista launching and a bunch of stuff.\n\n1036\n00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,070\nAnd so we were using some of that\ntechnology way before it came out on\n\n1037\n00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:12,390\nthe market because we would actually\nbe told hey, IT's putting this out.\n\n1038\n00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,640\nYou gotta go out and\ngotta use this and try this.\n\n1039\n00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,990\nSo it's interesting, cuz this is\nthe kinda thing we talk about and\n\n1040\n00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,420\nwanna make sure you're doing.\n\n1041\n00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,660\nSo when we talk about areas\nthat we want to focus on,\n\n1042\n00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,610\nright almost anything is open to us.\n\n1043\n00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:26,090\nAny area potentially can be\nan area of focus for an audit.\n\n1044\n00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,180\nThings like anti virus software,\nfor instance, right.\n\n1045\n00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,600\nYou may be going in and\nfocusing on the desktop and\n\n1046\n00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,690\nsaying what kind of virus software what\nkind of remediation solution do I have.\n\n1047\n00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,230\nAm I using the built in vendor zone,\n\n1048\n00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,270\nyou know Microsoft malware detection\nsoftware or do I have a third party?\n\n1049\n00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,550\nAnd if I have a third\nparty why am I using ESET\n\n1050\n00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:47,030\nmaybe instead of Microsoft's\nanti virus solution\n\n1051\n00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,680\nwhat is the driving reason behind it we\nwanna understand that want to know that.\n\n1052\n00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,470\nAnd then auditors may ask questions about,\nwhen did you acquire it?\n\n1053\n00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,700\nHow many licenses do you have rolled out?\n\n1054\n00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,240\nHow widely spread is it?\n\n1055\n00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,600\nAre you centrally managing it?\n\n1056\n00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,230\nIs it an end user model so everyone is\nresponsible for their own updating?\n\n1057\n00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,140\nWhere's the policy for this, by the way?\n\n1058\n00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,590\nWe're always going to ask\nshow me the policy, right.\n\n1059\n00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,490\nShow me how people are supposed to do it.\n\n1060\n00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,280\nThen let me go validate that they are.\n\n1061\n00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,530\nAnd so we are going to look at\nthe potential, what you should be doing so\n\n1062\n00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,490\nthe perfect state.\n\n1063\n00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,120\nAnd then we're going to\nlook at the actual state.\n\n1064\n00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,970\nAnd that's what the auditors want to do,\nis do that comparison.\n\n1065\n00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,520\nThings like system access policy.\n\n1066\n00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,360\nHow are we getting into a system?\n\n1067\n00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,690\nAre we logging on with a user name and\na password.\n\n1068\n00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,370\nWe had that whole great conversation in\none of our earlier episodes about bio\n\n1069\n00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:31,850\nmetrics, smart cards things like that.\n\n1070\n00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,100\nSo how are you doing that?\n\n1071\n00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,820\nYou know I often remember I'm a big, not a\nhuge Simpsons fan but I'm a Simpsons fan,\n\n1072\n00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,040\nyou may or may not watch the Simpsons.\n\n1073\n00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,400\nBut there was an episode,\ncouple of episodes, but\n\n1074\n00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,340\none in particular that is related\nto what we're talking about here.\n\n1075\n00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,230\nYou now at one point in one of\nthe episodes Bart winds up being\n\n1076\n00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,428\nforced to write greeting cards, right?\n\n1077\n00:52:52,428 --> 00:52:56,790\nSo he's kept in this mole like\nenvironment underneath the earth, and\n\n1078\n00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,910\nHomer has to go rescue him because he\ngets sucked into this whole thing.\n\n1079\n00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,920\nAnd the mole people are making him\nwrite greeting cards of all things, and\n\n1080\n00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,660\nhe's locked in this huge vault.\n\n1081\n00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,630\nAnd the only way to get in to the vault\nis they have all these different\n\n1082\n00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:08,520\nsecurity measures.\n\n1083\n00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,100\nThis defense and\ndepth concept we've been talking about.\n\n1084\n00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,610\nAnd so they have the guard and they have\nthe gate and the dogs and the moat and\n\n1085\n00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:15,900\nall this crazy stuff.\n\n1086\n00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,410\nAnd at the end they walk up and the last\nsecurity measure is the biometric device\n\n1087\n00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:26,260\nthat's on the lock or on the wall to open\nup the [COUGH] the big door of the vault.\n\n1088\n00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,226\nAnd it's the butt scan 3000 and so that's\nthe ultimate biometric device, right?\n\n1089\n00:53:30,226 --> 00:53:32,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so this idea of biometrics and\n\n1090\n00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,980\nreally focusing on how you log\ninto things is gonna be important.\n\n1091\n00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,350\nAnd we look at these things, right?\n\n1092\n00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,150\nAre we able to fool the scanner?\n\n1093\n00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,990\nHow good is the logging?\n\n1094\n00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:44,040\nWhat is the crossover error rate that\nwe spoke about on these devices?\n\n1095\n00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,940\nAuditors will ask for this information.\n\n1096\n00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,620\nAnd ask you to document it.\n\n1097\n00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,160\nOn things like intrusion detection and\n\n1098\n00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,390\nevent monitoring, we'll be talking\nabout this a little bit later on.\n\n1099\n00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:55,160\nBut we'll wanna look at those areas,\nwe wanna focus on them.\n\n1100\n00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,740\nSystem hardening, what are you hardening?\n\n1101\n00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,910\nWhat are your baselines?\n\n1102\n00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:01,200\nThese are all the areas that\nauditors may want information on.\n\n1103\n00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,520\nI may wanna see the documentation,\nthings like cryptographic controls,\n\n1104\n00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,200\nmaybe your contingency plans,\nBCP, DRP, things of that nature.\n\n1105\n00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,780\nHow well documented are they?\n\n1106\n00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,790\nHow well supported are they?\n\n1107\n00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,660\nHow often are they tested?\n\n1108\n00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,630\nIf you pull out the dusty binder and it\nmakes the ominous noise as you pull it off\n\n1109\n00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:25,300\nthe shelf because it hasn't been seeing\nthe light of day in probably 15 years and\n\n1110\n00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,110\nit isn't updated, the edges are frayed,\npaper's yellow, you know\n\n1111\n00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:31,610\nthat kind of thing might have been\nwritten in Sanskrit because it's so old.\n\n1112\n00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,350\nYou know, if it looks like that,\nthat's going to be a problem.\n\n1113\n00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,630\nAuditors are going to\ntake one look at that and\n\n1114\n00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:38,580\nsay that you obviously,\nclearly are just not really\n\n1115\n00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,260\nkeeping up with the things that you\nare supposed to be focused on right.\n\n1116\n00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,270\nSo just be aware of that kind of stuff.\n\n1117\n00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,540\nThese are all the different areas\nthat we may want to be looking at.\n\n1118\n00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,775\nEverything from major to minor,\nthink of it that way.\n\n1119\n00:54:48,775 --> 00:54:54,100\nAnything as small as why are we\nnot locking our cabinets at night?\n\n1120\n00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,810\nI'm looking around the studio\nthat we're shooting in and\n\n1121\n00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:59,460\noff to the side we have some cubicles.\n\n1122\n00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,570\nAnd on top of one of the cubicles\nyou have a corral, and\n\n1123\n00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,330\nthere's a drawer that comes down and\nyou can potentially lock.\n\n1124\n00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:08,430\nAnd, in banking for instance, or financial\nservices areas, or just in general any\n\n1125\n00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,680\narea where you have intellectual property,\nbut specifically secure information.\n\n1126\n00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,530\nIf you work in a solution like that or\n\n1127\n00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,510\na cube like that, you have a mandate\nthat you have to clear your desk,\n\n1128\n00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,760\nand everything has to be locked\nat the end of the workday.\n\n1129\n00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,740\nAnd if it's not put away,\nin some cases it's a fireable offense.\n\n1130\n00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,280\nAnd I have customers that have policies\nspecifically that mandate this and\n\n1131\n00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,610\nI have customers that have fired people\nas a first offense for not doing that.\n\n1132\n00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:31,940\nFor not clearing their desk.\n\n1133\n00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,890\nSo we will walk through and\ncheck all these things and look for\n\n1134\n00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:35,980\nall these things.\n\n1135\n00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,900\nVery important, all right.\n\n1136\n00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,150\n>> I've had to do all of that personally.\n\n1137\n00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:41,420\nI worked for a bank and\n\n1138\n00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:45,270\nwe were in a sky scraper which meant\nwe didn't own the entire building.\n\n1139\n00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,690\nWe just had certain floors within\nthe facility, we always used laptops.\n\n1140\n00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:50,684\nWe never bought desktops.\n\n1141\n00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:54,050\nSo even if somebody just worked at\nthe office, we still got them a laptop.\n\n1142\n00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,883\nSo on those occasions when they\ndid travel They were ready for it.\n\n1143\n00:55:56,883 --> 00:56:01,950\nWell we had a problem with people leaving\ntheir laptops on their desk at night.\n\n1144\n00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:05,690\nBecause other people have access\nthe building, the building supers and\n\n1145\n00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,430\npeople that are outside.\n\n1146\n00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,180\n>> Cleaning crews.\n\n1147\n00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,610\n>> Yeah.\nCleaning crews especially.\n\n1148\n00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,130\nThat it would be very easy for somebody\nto grab a laptop and walk with it.\n\n1149\n00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:15,130\nSo it was our policy that at the end of\nthe day you either took your laptop with\n\n1150\n00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,820\nyou or you placed it in your drawer and\nlocked your desk.\n\n1151\n00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,840\nAnd once a month we would\ndo surprise audits.\n\n1152\n00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,780\nYou'd just walk the floor and\nlook for laptops.\n\n1153\n00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,700\nAnd what we did is we grabbed the laptop.\n\n1154\n00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,620\nThat if we saw a laptop left out we\ngrabbed it so that when that employee came\n\n1155\n00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,990\nin in the morning they would have\nto come to the IT department,\n\n1156\n00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:37,460\nwe called it re-education, they had to get\nre-educated on the policy of what you do,\n\n1157\n00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,930\nor how you're supposed to do that.\n\n1158\n00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,110\nAnd if they did it three times\nit was a terminable offense.\n\n1159\n00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:42,460\n>> Did you spray them\nwith a water bottle and\n\n1160\n00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,630\nsmack them on the nose with\na rolled up newspaper?\n\n1161\n00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:45,380\n>> Bad, bad.\n\n1162\n00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,860\n>> Bad IT employee, right?\n\n1163\n00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,650\nBut these are important\nthings to consider.\n\n1164\n00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:51,780\nBecause what often happens is we take, and\n\n1165\n00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,940\nwe've had this theme running\nthroughout all of our discussions and\n\n1166\n00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,220\nall the episodes around this\nparticular focus that we have on SSCP.\n\n1167\n00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,790\nWe've been talking about common sense and\n\n1168\n00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,610\nI've been harping on the idea that\nit's the things that we take for\n\n1169\n00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,060\ngranted that can really do us\nharm if we don't pay attention.\n\n1170\n00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,610\nAnd as simple as it is you\ndon't think about the fact that\n\n1171\n00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,190\nhey just because you're in a secure area.\n\n1172\n00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:12,210\nYou're in an office.\n\n1173\n00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:13,250\nI'll leave my laptop out.\n\n1174\n00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,570\nI mean, at home you leave\nstuff out all the time right?\n\n1175\n00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:18,740\nYou don't really think about it unless\nobviously something bad happens.\n\n1176\n00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,900\nSomebody breaks in, you start to\nbe a little bit more cautious.\n\n1177\n00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,570\nBut in general,\nyou think well it's behind a locked door.\n\n1178\n00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,820\nIt's probably secure.\n\n1179\n00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,000\nNot necessarily.\n\n1180\n00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,650\nYou talked about walking the floor.\n\n1181\n00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:32,660\nAuditors may come in at night\nwhen nobody's there and\n\n1182\n00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,620\nspend a few hours poking around.\n\n1183\n00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,690\nI promise you the cleaning crew is\nspending a few hours poking around at\n\n1184\n00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:38,990\nnight when nobody's there.\n\n1185\n00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,380\nSo we will do that, right?\n\n1186\n00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,900\nAnd we will look to see what we can find.\n\n1187\n00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,000\nSo we look at the pictures\nof your kids and\n\n1188\n00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,280\nyour third grade art hanging in your cube.\n\n1189\n00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,760\nAnd we look at all that stuff and\ngo oh, that's so cool.\n\n1190\n00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,920\nAnd I bet you if I try that password,\nI bet you I can get in.\n\n1191\n00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,380\nAnd sure enough it's Little Suzie's\nname or Little Suzie's birthday, or\n\n1192\n00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,940\nwhatever it may be.\n\n1193\n00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,550\nThat then we find and we make a note and\n\n1194\n00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:04,600\nsay this user's password is not\nfollowing the proper policy.\n\n1195\n00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,890\nSo how many others are not?\n\n1196\n00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,910\nAnd if we randomly sample and do that and\n\n1197\n00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:11,060\nwe find that the password policy is not\nbeing implemented across the board.\n\n1198\n00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:11,860\nThat's a finding.\n\n1199\n00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:15,740\nThat's how we figure out these things\nare or in some cases are not happening.\n\n1200\n00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,320\nSo be aware of that.\n\n1201\n00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,510\nDon't just lock up the laptop,\nlock up the art so\n\n1202\n00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,510\nwe have nothing to find\nat the end of the day.\n\n1203\n00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:24,350\n>> You know, here at the studio we have\na very simple policy which is if we find\n\n1204\n00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:27,540\na computer that somebody walked away\nfrom without locking the screen,\n\n1205\n00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,760\nwe change their wallpaper\nto My Little Pony.\n\n1206\n00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,700\n>> Awesome.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1207\n00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,680\n>> That is a running gag that we have, but\n\n1208\n00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,460\nit really is kind of built around\na security policy is the idea\n\n1209\n00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,200\nthat you shouldn't walk away\nfrom your computer unlocked,\n\n1210\n00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,660\nif it's still on, software-wise,\nbut even physically locked.\n\n1211\n00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,660\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1212\n00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,670\n>> Absolutely.\nSo I do have laser beams by the way.\n\n1213\n00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:47,985\nJust thought I'd mention that.\n\n1214\n00:58:47,985 --> 00:58:49,990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A generic forcefield that surrounds my\n\n1215\n00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,030\nmachine at all times.\n\n1216\n00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,270\nSo just in case you were wondering.\n\n1217\n00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,630\nAll right, so let's talk about\nidentity management a little bit.\n\n1218\n00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:58,510\nWe've talked about the general idea and\nhow we're gonna look at systems,\n\n1219\n00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,750\nwhere we're gonna find stuff.\n\n1220\n00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,730\nWe talked just now about passwords for\ninstance and\n\n1221\n00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,480\nmaybe not applying that policy.\n\n1222\n00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,890\nSo we really want to make sure we\nhave effective identification and\n\n1223\n00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,990\neffective authorization systems in\nother areas that we're really gonna\n\n1224\n00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:12,175\nfocus on when we do an audit.\n\n1225\n00:59:12,175 --> 00:59:13,885\nHow are people getting in?\n\n1226\n00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:16,325\nDon just mentioned locking your\nmachine when you walk away.\n\n1227\n00:59:16,325 --> 00:59:19,155\nDo you have a screen saver\nthat locks out automatically?\n\n1228\n00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,785\nDo you have a password policy\nin place that mandates\n\n1229\n00:59:22,785 --> 00:59:24,815\na certain strength on the password?\n\n1230\n00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:29,875\nDo you lock out machines using a policy\nafter so many minutes of inactivity?\n\n1231\n00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:31,935\nThese are the things we\nwant to be thinking about.\n\n1232\n00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,495\nThese are the things we will look for.\n\n1233\n00:59:33,495 --> 00:59:36,130\nDo you monitor for unauthorized activity?\n\n1234\n00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,710\nSo, if all of a sudden somebody does get\na hold of a machine and does things that\n\n1235\n00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:43,440\nnormally are not emanating from that kind\nof machine, are you looking for that?\n\n1236\n00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,910\nDo you have some sort of a SEM solution in\nplace, and we'll talk about these later,\n\n1237\n00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:52,130\nwhere we're capturing and\nmonitoring logging information, and\n\n1238\n00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,040\nare we then flagging those traffic\npatterns to understand what may or\n\n1239\n00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,290\nmay not be happening.\n\n1240\n00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,770\nSo, do we have remote access and\n\n1241\n00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:01,140\nif so, are we monitoring the use\nof remote access on that system?\n\n1242\n01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,550\nIs it being done securely?\n\n1243\n01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:06,030\nThese are all the kind of things that\nwe would wanna be thinking about there.\n\n1244\n01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:07,940\nWhen we talk about audits, we then.\n\n1245\n01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,050\nThankfully, right?\n\n1246\n01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:11,510\nThe end of it.\nHave to say glad it's over.\n\n1247\n01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,270\nWe're done.\n\n1248\n01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:13,820\nSo what are the post-audit activities?\n\n1249\n01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,850\nWhat are the things that\nhappen after the fact?\n\n1250\n01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:17,610\nWe have exit interviews typically.\n\n1251\n01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:22,070\nWhen we do post-audit activities we\nwanna interview the people or do an exit\n\n1252\n01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:27,290\ninterview for this and after an audit is\nperformed typically we have findings.\n\n1253\n01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,050\nAnd we have things that\nwe have to address and\n\n1254\n01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,070\nthey're going to be listed\nin the audit report.\n\n1255\n01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:36,370\nSo we're gonna wanna do an exit interview\nto make sure that here we basically\n\n1256\n01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:40,070\nare able to meet with the auditors,\nmanagement can explain what's going on,\n\n1257\n01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,440\ntalk about some of the findings,\nthose kind of things.\n\n1258\n01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,980\nSo we want to make sure we're doing that,\nor\n\n1259\n01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,550\nat least we have\nthe opportunity to do that.\n\n1260\n01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:49,040\nAnd we analyze the data, very important\nwe get this wealth of information\n\n1261\n01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,500\nfrom our auditors, and\nwe want to be able to analyze it.\n\n1262\n01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,300\nAnd that takes time, by the way,\nthat's not gonna be a quick thing.\n\n1263\n01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,240\nWe're gonna then produce the findings,\n\n1264\n01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,980\nthe auditors will produce\nthe audit findings, right?\n\n1265\n01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,770\nAnd so we wanna find, or go out and\nlook for these findings and\n\n1266\n01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:05,180\ngo through them,\nmake sure we document them properly.\n\n1267\n01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,470\nSo we're gonna reference\nyour policy typically and\n\n1268\n01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,510\nthen reference what the best\npractice should be.\n\n1269\n01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:13,910\nSo, we'll look at the state currently and\nthen, in effect, the state we want you to\n\n1270\n01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:18,010\ntransform into when we talk about these\nfindings and present them to you.\n\n1271\n01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:22,990\nSo we may say, for instance, that you\nhave a current policy, a password policy.\n\n1272\n01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:27,840\nThat allows simple passwords, and\nthen we would say on the remediation\n\n1273\n01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,050\nmatrix that the standard best\npractice in the industry is\n\n1274\n01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,500\ncomplex passwords with three of\nthe four following criteria, right?\n\n1275\n01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:44,355\nAlphanumeric, special character,\nand/or, I'm having a stupid moment.\n\n1276\n01:01:44,355 --> 01:01:47,790\nAlpha-numeric special character and\nor I don't know-\n\n1277\n01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,530\n>> Minimum length.\n\n1278\n01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:50,110\n>> Minimum length, or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n1279\n01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,730\nYeah, I said complex password, so\nminimum length, so many characters.\n\n1280\n01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,510\nI haven't had my coffee yet\nthis morning yet, so I appreciate that.\n\n1281\n01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,990\nI'm running only on half\nthe cylinders that normally fire.\n\n1282\n01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:01,140\nSo we would list that best practice for\n\n1283\n01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:04,590\nyou, and the audit would basically\ntake you through the as is and\n\n1284\n01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,840\nmove you to the 2B right,\nin order to show you what you're gonna do.\n\n1285\n01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,820\nAnd then we would also have a criticality\nrating typically associated with that.\n\n1286\n01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,130\nWhy?\nBecause we would say,\n\n1287\n01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:17,690\nthis simple password policy, maybe on\na scale of one to five, one being low,\n\n1288\n01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,730\nfive being oh my God you\ngotta do this right away.\n\n1289\n01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:22,540\nYou know maybe this is a two, right?\n\n1290\n01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,620\nBut at the end of the day we want\nyou to understand the impact and\n\n1291\n01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,900\nthe urgency associated with these things.\n\n1292\n01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,100\nAnd we typically will also provide\nsome sort of follow up for you.\n\n1293\n01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:36,340\nThere may be a link to resources,\nthere may be a remediation plan.\n\n1294\n01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:36,940\nWhatever it is, but\n\n1295\n01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:41,770\nthere'll be some follow up information\ntypically provided there as well.\n\n1296\n01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:45,540\nWe will format the audit\nfindings typically in two forms.\n\n1297\n01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,990\nThere'll be an executive summary.\n\n1298\n01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:50,770\nKinda like a, maybe, five to ten\npage overview of the high level.\n\n1299\n01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:55,720\nAnd then there'll be a detailed report\nthat could be hundreds of pages in length,\n\n1300\n01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,390\nit really depends on\nthe size of the audit and\n\n1301\n01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,670\nwhat we're doing,\nthat will be presented, right?\n\n1302\n01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,750\nSo this is how we then will typically\npresent the information and\n\n1303\n01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:06,620\nwe will then also have an overview\nof the level of risk found.\n\n1304\n01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:10,110\nAnd really detail out the timeline for\nimplementation.\n\n1305\n01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:15,210\nWe will typically recommend to you that\nthere has to be some sort of a pathway\n\n1306\n01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:19,510\nto get these things dealt with and so\nwe'll give you X number of weeks and then\n\n1307\n01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,900\nwe may have to come back and do a follow\nup check to understand what's going on.\n\n1308\n01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,200\nThat kind of thing.\n\n1309\n01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,620\nSo, that's the typical overview.\n\n1310\n01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:30,020\nOf the audit activities and\nhow we're going through and\n\n1311\n01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,320\ndealing with the auditing.\n\n1312\n01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:35,337\nWhen we wrap up and we provide the audit\nto the customer, right, as the auditor,\n\n1313\n01:03:35,337 --> 01:03:39,236\nwhen I wrap up and in effect finish the\naudit provided to you, obviously we want\n\n1314\n01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:43,489\nto make sure that you're going to sit down\nand spend the time as the customer, right,\n\n1315\n01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:47,245\nto go through the findings, and\nto make sure you really internalize that.\n\n1316\n01:03:47,245 --> 01:03:49,434\nAnd one of the big\nchallenges with an auditor,\n\n1317\n01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:53,155\nespecially a big audit is that that\ndetailed report is going to be voluminous.\n\n1318\n01:03:53,155 --> 01:03:58,917\nI mean it could be very big And so it\nsometimes requires you, as the customer,\n\n1319\n01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:04,330\nto sit down and really split up\nby subject matter expert area.\n\n1320\n01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,610\nThe people that do the logs,\npeople that do the firewalls,\n\n1321\n01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:10,660\npeople that do the IDSes,\nshare the report with them to really help\n\n1322\n01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:14,650\nthose departments to understand what\nthose particular outcomes are, and\n\n1323\n01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:19,360\nthen come up with your remediation plans\nby area, by department, or whatever it is.\n\n1324\n01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,300\nBy subject matter in order to\nthen be able to go out and\n\n1325\n01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,970\nexecute on the remediations\nthat may be required.\n\n1326\n01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:28,450\nAnd this is gonna be very important for\nyou to be thinking about as well.\n\n1327\n01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:32,820\nIf you have not had the chance to engage\nin an audit, be part of an audit, it is,\n\n1328\n01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,608\nall kidding aside about auditing and\nauditors and\n\n1329\n01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:40,053\nall those things that we've talked about,\nit's a great opportunity for you as\n\n1330\n01:04:40,053 --> 01:04:44,466\na security professional to really get to\nknow the business in a different way.\n\n1331\n01:04:44,466 --> 01:04:49,203\nTo see it from the strategic, as well as\nthe operational, and the tactical areas,\n\n1332\n01:04:49,203 --> 01:04:51,368\nkind of an all up view of the business,\n\n1333\n01:04:51,368 --> 01:04:54,500\nan all over view of the business\nboth height and depth.\n\n1334\n01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,734\nAnd to really poke under the covers\na little bit to understand the kinds of\n\n1335\n01:04:57,734 --> 01:04:59,378\nthings that the business is doing but\n\n1336\n01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:02,210\nalso to understand the areas\nwhere they can improve.\n\n1337\n01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:04,940\nAnd then as a result, you can\npotentially add value by helping to\n\n1338\n01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:08,030\nimprove those areas that you\nfeel most capable of taking on.\n\n1339\n01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,330\nIt's also a great opportunity for\n\n1340\n01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:14,000\nyou to figure out the areas that you may\nwant to become more familiar with, right?\n\n1341\n01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,370\nBecause you may not know\na lot about firewalls but\n\n1342\n01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:19,250\nyou may want to learn more about them\nbased on the findings in the audit and\n\n1343\n01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,920\nthat's a great way for you to then zero in\non the next project you're gonna take on,\n\n1344\n01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,620\nwhatever that may be,\nright, areas of interest.\n\n1345\n01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:29,080\nJust some parting thoughts as we begin to\nthink about wrapping up our discussion\n\n1346\n01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,460\nhere around auditing.\n\n1347\n01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,170\nAnything else you think you may\nwant to throw on the table for us?\n\n1348\n01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:35,140\n>> No, I think that's about it.\n\n1349\n01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,403\nYou know, obviously we've\ngot more to get through, but\n\n1350\n01:05:37,403 --> 01:05:39,160\nI know we've run right\nup on our break time.\n\n1351\n01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,100\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n1352\n01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,870\nWhy don't we stop and take a break,\nand when we get back we're gonna\n\n1353\n01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:46,300\ncontinue on with some of the remaining\npoints on monitoring and analysis.\n\n1354\n01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,180\nAnd then-\n>> Specifically log collection.\n\n1355\n01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,543\n>> Oh, yeah. [CROSSTALK] >> That's what\nwe'll talk about next, log collection and\n\n1356\n01:05:50,543 --> 01:05:52,484\nanalysis, we're actually\ngonna get into that next and\n\n1357\n01:05:52,484 --> 01:05:54,355\ntalk to you all about how you\ncan do that kind of stuff.\n\n1358\n01:05:54,355 --> 01:05:57,141\n>> All right, so stay tuned,\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n1359\n01:05:57,141 --> 01:06:00,797\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1360\n01:06:00,797 --> 01:06:06,652\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n1361\n01:06:06,652 --> 01:06:09,870\nSo we just wrapped up talking\nabout security auditing and\n\n1362\n01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:14,295\ndoing the general monitoring of our system\nas far as ensuring that our policies\n\n1363\n01:06:14,295 --> 01:06:18,170\nare in place and being used the way\nthey're supposed to be used.\n\n1364\n01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:19,754\nPeople are adhering to them and all that.\n\n1365\n01:06:19,754 --> 01:06:22,889\nNow what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna switch gears a little bit and\n\n1366\n01:06:22,889 --> 01:06:26,467\ntalk about some of the ways that we can\nfacilitate actually monitoring that on\n\n1367\n01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:29,386\na regular basis, because it can\nbe information overload and so\n\n1368\n01:06:29,386 --> 01:06:32,331\na lot of times we're gonna rely\non additional tools to help us.\n\n1369\n01:06:32,331 --> 01:06:35,054\n>> Absolutely, you know, and\ntools are really important and\n\n1370\n01:06:35,054 --> 01:06:38,756\nwhen we start thinking about what we're\ngonna do, I wanna just make the point for\n\n1371\n01:06:38,756 --> 01:06:42,100\nyou now so as we get into this,\nwe really have the right mindset.\n\n1372\n01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,738\nIt's about doing the right\nthings clearly and\n\n1373\n01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:45,990\nhaving the right tools helps\nyou to do the right things.\n\n1374\n01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:49,680\nBut most importantly at the end of the\nday, it's about making sure that you're\n\n1375\n01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,340\ndoing the things that are going to\naddress the concerns the business has,\n\n1376\n01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,280\nto make sure that you have a holistic\nmodel for security, and making sure you're\n\n1377\n01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,840\nfocused when we talk about monitoring on\ngathering information that actually gives\n\n1378\n01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,480\nyou something of value,\ntells you what's going on in your network.\n\n1379\n01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,930\nAnd then you can look at that over time\nto figure out all the hidden gems,\n\n1380\n01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:09,830\nif you will, that are available to you.\n\n1381\n01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:12,590\nWe arranged a little live demo for\nyou that we wanna share with you quickly\n\n1382\n01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:16,180\njust to make sure that you have a sense\nof what tools like this may look like.\n\n1383\n01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:19,580\nSo this is the SolarWinds log and\nevent manager and\n\n1384\n01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,995\nthis is a demo environment that\nSolarWinds has up on their site.\n\n1385\n01:07:22,995 --> 01:07:24,470\nWe've captured the URL for you.\n\n1386\n01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:25,300\nIt'll be in the notes so\n\n1387\n01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,460\nyou can log in and take a look\nat this environment on your own.\n\n1388\n01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,930\nYou may be using a tool like this.\n\n1389\n01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:31,340\nYou may even be using this tool.\n\n1390\n01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:34,210\nYou may never have seen a tool\nthat looks just like this before,\n\n1391\n01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:37,200\nmaybe not quite as complex,\nand as feature-rich.\n\n1392\n01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,870\nBut whatever you're using, as long as it\nfits the pattern for what you need to\n\n1393\n01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:45,200\naccomplish in your business today,\nthat is the right tool for you.\n\n1394\n01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,040\nAnd so we have a dashboard\narea here in the ops center,\n\n1395\n01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:51,260\nlot of different graphics that we can see,\ntop ten events,\n\n1396\n01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:55,660\nhealth of the various nodes that\nare being monitored, little diagram or\n\n1397\n01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:00,290\nchart there that lays out events permitted\nfor us, tells us what's going on.\n\n1398\n01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:03,040\nGot a whole bunch of\nlittle top ten indicators.\n\n1399\n01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:07,290\nAnd then out beyond this general view\nas we see all the different areas.\n\n1400\n01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:10,770\nWe switch to monitoring here and\nwe've got real time data streaming in.\n\n1401\n01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:15,930\nSo this is data that's coming in and we're\nmonitoring, this is literally an event log\n\n1402\n01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:19,440\nthat's just showing us all the different\nactivities that are taking place.\n\n1403\n01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,069\nAnd we're aggregating this from one or\nmore data sources,\n\n1404\n01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:24,575\nthere's several monitors\nthat feed a model like this.\n\n1405\n01:08:24,575 --> 01:08:27,710\nAnd then we're able to drill into any\none of these particular items and\n\n1406\n01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:29,550\nsee the detail at the lower right.\n\n1407\n01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:31,320\nWhen Don highlights something\nat the lower right,\n\n1408\n01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,210\nas he zooms in here,\nwe can see the detail on this.\n\n1409\n01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:37,218\nRight so this is going to tell\nus where this is coming from,\n\n1410\n01:08:37,218 --> 01:08:41,900\nthe detection IP, what the event info is,\nwhatever that particular item is.\n\n1411\n01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,130\nIt looks like it has something\nto do with the domain.\n\n1412\n01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,140\nI'll call configuration.corp, right?\n\n1413\n01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,744\nAnd so we can go in and\nwe can see what's going on there and\n\n1414\n01:08:48,744 --> 01:08:52,980\nwe can also chart what is happening with\nthe events permitted information, so.\n\n1415\n01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,530\nThinking about a tool like this for\n\n1416\n01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:57,720\nlogin event management helps\nyou to put in to perspective\n\n1417\n01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,980\nthe kind of resources that you may be able\nto deploy in real time in your network.\n\n1418\n01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,310\nWe're gonna talk about\nthe methodologies to manage this.\n\n1419\n01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:08,500\nBut as an SSCP, these are the kinds of\nenvironments you're gonna be asked to work\n\n1420\n01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,740\nwith, and in many cases, manage over time\nas you become a certified professional.\n\n1421\n01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:16,570\nSo you want to get used to tools, whether\nit's a tool like this or another tool.\n\n1422\n01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,280\nPick the tools that work for you.\n\n1423\n01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,040\nUse the tools you're provided.\n\n1424\n01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,520\nAsk the obvious questions and\n\n1425\n01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,730\nspend the time to get to know how\nthese tools work the right way.\n\n1426\n01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,430\nBecomes very important.\n\n1427\n01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:28,560\nSo when we talk about security\nmonitoring we're really talking\n\n1428\n01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,690\nabout an art and a science.\n\n1429\n01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:32,440\nYou can see tools like this\ncould be incredibly complicated.\n\n1430\n01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,550\nAnd so we wanna make sure we\nfind the obvious things, but\n\n1431\n01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:38,430\nalso find the things that are not so\nobvious in our data streams.\n\n1432\n01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:41,970\nAnd this is gonna be a question\nof blending different data nodes,\n\n1433\n01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:44,520\ninformation coming in from\ndifferent places to do that.\n\n1434\n01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,810\nWe may monitor using baselines and\nconfiguration management.\n\n1435\n01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:48,840\nIt's very important.\n\n1436\n01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,620\nWe may use alarms and alerts and\n\n1437\n01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:53,250\nevents that are gonna indicate\ncertain things that are happening.\n\n1438\n01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:55,780\nWe may have video,\nclosed circuit TV, for instance,\n\n1439\n01:09:55,780 --> 01:10:00,390\nis used typically in offices to monitor\nworkspaces and things like that to make\n\n1440\n01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:04,210\nsure people aren't stealing and\nnot up to no good when nobody's around.\n\n1441\n01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:06,290\nWe don't want them watering\ndown the coffee, for instance,\n\n1442\n01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:07,140\nwhen nobody's looking.\n\n1443\n01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,550\nThat would be a very bad thing.\n\n1444\n01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,330\nSo as a result of that,\n\n1445\n01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:14,360\nwe wanna make sure that we are keeping\nan eye on all these data sources.\n\n1446\n01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:18,310\nYou may not be looking at video unless\nyou actually have a reported theft or\n\n1447\n01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:21,462\nan incident potentially of some\nsort of untoward behavior.\n\n1448\n01:10:21,462 --> 01:10:22,390\nBut then you may go back and\n\n1449\n01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:26,130\nreview that video to find out what's going\non from the closed circuit feeds, right?\n\n1450\n01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:30,650\nSo most of these systems simply record for\nmaybe 30 days on average on a running\n\n1451\n01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:35,140\nbasis on some sort of DVR today,\nmultiple camera feeds.\n\n1452\n01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,390\nYou get systems like this for\na few hundred dollars for\n\n1453\n01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:40,750\nyour home, up to several thousands or\ntens of thousands of dollars.\n\n1454\n01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:44,280\nEven more expensive with\nmotion detection and IR and\n\n1455\n01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,133\nall that kind of stuff in companies.\n\n1456\n01:10:46,133 --> 01:10:47,095\nAnd you will then go back and\n\n1457\n01:10:47,095 --> 01:10:50,585\nlook at this information over time\nto kinda see what's happening.\n\n1458\n01:10:50,585 --> 01:10:53,757\nAnd we've probably all seen the TV\nshows where this stuff shows up and\n\n1459\n01:10:53,757 --> 01:10:57,405\nthey wanna see the closed circuit\nTV footage of whatever's happened.\n\n1460\n01:10:57,405 --> 01:10:58,500\nSo be aware of that.\n\n1461\n01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:02,560\nWe don't tend to aggregate that data into\nan event monitoring logging system like\n\n1462\n01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,210\nyou just saw the demo of, the closed\ncircuit video, but we do have it available\n\n1463\n01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:09,260\nin a separate system that we can\ngo search for it typically, right?\n\n1464\n01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:13,910\n>> Pretty common example\ntoday is DHCP server logs.\n\n1465\n01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:17,130\nIf you get a take down\nnotice that says someone in\n\n1466\n01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:20,110\nyour organization is using\nBitTorrent to exchange\n\n1467\n01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,120\ncopyrighted material on the internet-\n>> Shame on them.\n\n1468\n01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,359\n>> They'll normally reference an IP and\nyou'll need to say,\n\n1469\n01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:27,576\nall right, who had that IP at that time?\n\n1470\n01:11:27,576 --> 01:11:29,909\nWell, if you're using DHCP, it's dynamic?\n\n1471\n01:11:29,909 --> 01:11:31,453\nWho knows who had that IP, right?\n\n1472\n01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:36,064\nBut if you've got a log that shows this\nMAC address had this IP address at this\n\n1473\n01:11:36,064 --> 01:11:41,050\ntime, you can coordinate it and figure\nout exactly which machine was being used.\n\n1474\n01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,154\nThat's very useful information.\n\n1475\n01:11:42,154 --> 01:11:44,916\nI don't come into work on a given day and\nsay, boy,\n\n1476\n01:11:44,916 --> 01:11:47,240\nI'm gonna look at some DHCP logs, right?\n\n1477\n01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,702\nCuz they're boring and pointless.\n\n1478\n01:11:48,702 --> 01:11:51,926\nUntil you get one of those take down\nnotices and then I'm like, man,\n\n1479\n01:11:51,926 --> 01:11:54,970\nI wish I had some DHCP logs so\nI could figure out who this was.\n\n1480\n01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:56,080\nYou know, that's how these are.\n\n1481\n01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,820\n>> Now having said that, one of the little\nhacker things we'll pull in here for\n\n1482\n01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:02,040\njust a second, even though we're not\ngonna talk about hacking per se.\n\n1483\n01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,630\nBut there are tools out there.\n\n1484\n01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:05,070\nIn the old school days,\n\n1485\n01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,490\nyou used to get these tools as\npart of buying your network cards.\n\n1486\n01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:11,050\nThe diagnostic utilities that came on\nthe floppies will let you you manipulate\n\n1487\n01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,950\nthe MAC address of the card.\n\n1488\n01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:17,120\nWe got smart about that several years in\nwhen some young enterprising souls decided\n\n1489\n01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,560\nthat's what they would do, and\n\n1490\n01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,370\nrealized that we could then obfuscate in\neffect the collection of these logs, and\n\n1491\n01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:25,590\nobfuscate and\nhide the identity of the actual endpoint.\n\n1492\n01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:29,415\nAnd so we stopped making those available\nas utilities to reconfigure cards, but\n\n1493\n01:12:29,415 --> 01:12:31,564\nthere are tools out there\nthat still do this.\n\n1494\n01:12:31,564 --> 01:12:34,282\nAnd so, a tool like SMAC, for instance,\n\n1495\n01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:38,165\nS-M-A-C, will let you modify\nthe MAC address of a card or\n\n1496\n01:12:38,165 --> 01:12:42,900\nany endpoint device that has an IP\ninterface associated with it.\n\n1497\n01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:47,290\nAnd so you could in theory, even though\nwe look at those logs and say yes,\n\n1498\n01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:50,350\nyou know, DHCP endpoint Mac address.\n\n1499\n01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:52,970\nI could actually pretend to be\nDon when Don's not at work, and\n\n1500\n01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:56,048\nthen Don would be the one that ultimately\nfinds out that he has a problem.\n\n1501\n01:12:56,048 --> 01:13:00,630\nSo you wanna understand that just because\nit looks like something in a log, and\n\n1502\n01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,570\nthis is actually a very important point\nin the area we're talking about here with\n\n1503\n01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:06,930\nmonitoring, we never want\nto assume the obvious, but\n\n1504\n01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:09,610\nwe also never want to take anything for\ngranted, right?\n\n1505\n01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:13,240\nAnd so when it looks like a fish,\nsmells like a fish,\n\n1506\n01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,262\nswims like a fish, it's usually a fish,\nbut every so often it's not.\n\n1507\n01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:20,090\nAnd so, when it's not a fish,\nit proves to be a lot more interesting.\n\n1508\n01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:25,490\nAnd that's the end game in this whole\nprocess of monitoring, alerting,\n\n1509\n01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:32,130\nanalyzing, is that 99.9% of the time, it's\ngonna be exactly what it appears to be.\n\n1510\n01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:35,390\nIt's gonna be that MAC address,\nthat machine, that endpoint that did this.\n\n1511\n01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:37,800\nBut every so often, you get somebody\nwho's smart enough to know better,\n\n1512\n01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,150\nand smart enough to manipulate a system.\n\n1513\n01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,080\nAnd so as a security practitioner,\n\n1514\n01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:46,510\nwhat you have to figure out how to do\nis be just this much smarter, right?\n\n1515\n01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,950\nThis much smarter than those people.\n\n1516\n01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:50,210\nBut here's the challenge.\n\n1517\n01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:52,913\nBeing this much smarter than\nthose people is not hard,\n\n1518\n01:13:52,913 --> 01:13:55,220\nas long as you don't have\nto do it all the time.\n\n1519\n01:13:55,220 --> 01:14:00,092\nBut being this much smarter than everybody\naround you all the time is tough, and so\n\n1520\n01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:01,870\nit's a question of degrees.\n\n1521\n01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:04,450\nAnd I'm not suggesting for\na minute that you have to go out and\n\n1522\n01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:07,600\nfigure out how to be better\nthan everybody all the time.\n\n1523\n01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,003\nWhat I am suggesting is that when push\ncomes to shove and you have a threat you\n\n1524\n01:14:11,003 --> 01:14:14,634\nhave to assess, you have a stop, cease,\nand desist order you have to address.\n\n1525\n01:14:14,634 --> 01:14:18,928\nWhatever it is, when that particular event\nhappens that requires your expertise,\n\n1526\n01:14:18,928 --> 01:14:22,917\nthat's when you need to reach deep into\nthe tool bag and figure out how to be this\n\n1527\n01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:26,303\nmuch better to understand what's\nhappening, and as a result give\n\n1528\n01:14:26,303 --> 01:14:30,140\nthe business the right information\nthey need to make the right choices.\n\n1529\n01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:33,190\nAnd that's really what we're talking\nabout here, is becoming educated,\n\n1530\n01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:38,510\nbecoming that person who understands how\nto manipulate the systems well enough\n\n1531\n01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:41,140\nthat you understand the mindset of\nthe people that you're monitoring.\n\n1532\n01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,770\nIn other words, so that you can then\n\n1533\n01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,560\ntake the proper steps to avoid those\nissues from happening in the first place.\n\n1534\n01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,770\nSo just something to think about.\n\n1535\n01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:50,050\nJust something to consider.\n\n1536\n01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:53,200\nI know that for instance, when we\ntalk about a lot of these activities,\n\n1537\n01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,160\nI've mentioned here and there in some\nof these episodes, some of the hacking\n\n1538\n01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,700\ntechniques and things we may have used\nback in the day or even use today.\n\n1539\n01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,730\nThere are other programs you can look at,\nand other areas that you can\n\n1540\n01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:04,920\nfocus on where you might see\nsome of this information, right?\n\n1541\n01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,120\nSo you could look at some of these other\nprograms that we do on security in\n\n1542\n01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:12,615\ngeneral, and you may actually even be able\nto delve into other areas just by Googling\n\n1543\n01:15:12,615 --> 01:15:16,405\nand finding information on the tools and\nthe techniques we are talking about\n\n1544\n01:15:16,405 --> 01:15:19,275\nin order to better understand\nwhat those things may be.\n\n1545\n01:15:19,275 --> 01:15:21,095\nSo, real time monitoring.\n\n1546\n01:15:21,095 --> 01:15:24,610\nWe're talking about the idea of being able\nto gather information as you just saw.\n\n1547\n01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,710\nAnd then record that, keep it live,\n\n1548\n01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:30,140\nbut also have the recorded item\nthat we can look at over time.\n\n1549\n01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:34,740\nSo real time monitoring is gonna be taking\nplace with things like network IDS,\n\n1550\n01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:38,180\nNetwork Intrusion Detection Systems,\nwhere we set these things up and\n\n1551\n01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:41,180\nwe lay them out there for\nus to be able to capture and\n\n1552\n01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:44,380\nlook at information as it flows\nthrough our system in real time.\n\n1553\n01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,530\nWe're gonna set up what\nare called logging levels,\n\n1554\n01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:49,170\nor commonly referred to\nas logging thresholds.\n\n1555\n01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:52,150\nAnd we're gonna look at something or talk\nabout something called a clipping level.\n\n1556\n01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:56,510\nWhich is a fancy term for just a baseline,\na threshold, that we monitor against.\n\n1557\n01:15:56,510 --> 01:16:00,630\nSo we may say, for instance, with\nnetwork traffic through a network IDS,\n\n1558\n01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:05,220\nthat we want to see bandwidth on average\noccurring at some sort of a feed rate of\n\n1559\n01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:09,730\nmaybe 100 megabits per\nsecond on a network feed.\n\n1560\n01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,340\nAnd if we spike above 100\nmegabits per second for\n\n1561\n01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:16,260\nmore than five or ten seconds as a burst,\nthat's a clipping level.\n\n1562\n01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:19,220\nAt that point, we want to start alerting,\nor perhaps logging events.\n\n1563\n01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:22,090\nTaking some remediative action,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n1564\n01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:25,670\nAnd so, that clipping level is\nbasically a response point.\n\n1565\n01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:29,260\nIt's a baseline that when we cross\nwe are then gonna take some sort of\n\n1566\n01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,100\naction around or do something.\n\n1567\n01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,170\nSo that is a clipping level, and just\na term that you wanna be familiar with.\n\n1568\n01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,658\nWe refer to it generically\nas a logging threshold.\n\n1569\n01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:41,094\nSo non-real time monitoring will take\nplace with what are known as host IDSs.\n\n1570\n01:16:41,094 --> 01:16:45,953\nAnd so non-real time monitoring\nwill be what we call, or\n\n1571\n01:16:45,953 --> 01:16:51,534\nrather we'll refer to as having\na host IDS more often than not do.\n\n1572\n01:16:51,534 --> 01:16:54,936\nThis is where we're gonna have an agent\nrunning on a specific machine,\n\n1573\n01:16:54,936 --> 01:16:59,230\nwhatever that endpoint is, whatever\nthat host is, we call it a HID or a HID.\n\n1574\n01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:02,192\nHIDs by default are HIPs, HIPS, huh?\n\n1575\n01:17:02,192 --> 01:17:05,720\n>> [LAUGH]\nThat's what Cisco likes.\n\n1576\n01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,120\n>> I know, that's what Cisco does.\n\n1577\n01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,150\nCisco has all these great\nnaming conventions, right?\n\n1578\n01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:13,040\nSo, when we do non-real time monitoring,\nwe put an agent,\n\n1579\n01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,460\nsome sort of software solution, on\nan individual endpoint, whatever that is.\n\n1580\n01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:20,500\nAnd as a result of that, we're then\nable to do things like monitor and\n\n1581\n01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:26,890\nlog applications, monitor log system\ninformation, monitor and log integrity.\n\n1582\n01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:28,260\nThese things are captured, but\n\n1583\n01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:31,830\nwe're not streaming that data in\nreal time off the system typically.\n\n1584\n01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:34,580\nWe're looking at it in recorded format,\nand then we're\n\n1585\n01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:38,850\nsending that up to some sort of central\ncapture and a central repository for\n\n1586\n01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:43,640\nanalysis, like you saw in the log and\nevent demo that we did just a few minutes\n\n1587\n01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,610\nago as we were beginning the segment,\nand beginning the episode for you.\n\n1588\n01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:49,580\nSo think about non-real time\nmonitoring as being host-based,\n\n1589\n01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:52,070\nreal time event monitoring\nas being network-based.\n\n1590\n01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:56,060\nAnd this is an important distinction that\nyou want to make sure you are aware of as\n\n1591\n01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,080\na security practitioner.\n\n1592\n01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:00,110\nYou definitely wanna understand\nthe distinction between the two\n\n1593\n01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,230\nand how they work.\n\n1594\n01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:03,510\nSo when we do host-based activity,\nas we said,\n\n1595\n01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:05,510\nwe're looking at all\nthe things we just identified.\n\n1596\n01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:08,110\nThings like start up and shut down could\nbe another good example of something we\n\n1597\n01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:12,170\nmay want to log on a host, whereas\nnetwork based real time activity would be\n\n1598\n01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,920\nthings like traffic patterns,\nwe talked about this, the flow of traffic.\n\n1599\n01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:24,110\nMalware executing inside the network, and\nas a result getting root level access,\n\n1600\n01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:27,610\nroot kits, things of that nature,\ngenerally just looking at performance and\n\n1601\n01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:28,770\nnetwork traffic.\n\n1602\n01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:32,650\nAll of this would be examples of things\nthat we could look for when we're dealing\n\n1603\n01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:37,140\nwith real time monitoring,\nnetwork-based real time monitoring.\n\n1604\n01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,499\nAnd so,\nsome issues we addressed with monitoring.\n\n1605\n01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,440\nWe've identified a lot of the things\nthat we may wanna look for,\n\n1606\n01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,200\nand this kind of leads us\nto a thought process of\n\n1607\n01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,580\nmaybe some overarching themes we want\nto address with monitoring, right?\n\n1608\n01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:50,700\nWe wanna understand the data,\n\n1609\n01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,960\nthe quality of the data that\nflows through our networks.\n\n1610\n01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,290\nAlways very important.\n\n1611\n01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:58,080\nWanna look at the volume of traffic\nthat's flowing there, how much traffic,\n\n1612\n01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,750\nwhere's it coming from,\nwhere's it going to, things like that.\n\n1613\n01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:04,860\nWhat is the geographic\ndistribution of our network?\n\n1614\n01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:08,180\nHow much traffic in which nodes,\nand what are we doing there?\n\n1615\n01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,750\nWhat kind of attack vectors are we seeing,\nhow sophisticated are they?\n\n1616\n01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:15,410\nAre they the guy using the smack\ntool to reset a MAC address, or\n\n1617\n01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:19,440\nis it somebody executing a very\ndifficult denial of service attack,\n\n1618\n01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,198\nwith some sort of\nman-in-the-middle example?\n\n1619\n01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:25,930\nWhere there are spoofing sessions and\ndoing all sorts of crazy things, or\n\n1620\n01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,990\nhave they stolen logon information?\n\n1621\n01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:31,100\nOr perhaps,\nare they generating session packets and\n\n1622\n01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,530\nrenumbering them and\nre-sequencing them to take down a system?\n\n1623\n01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:35,960\nAll sorts of things can be going on.\n\n1624\n01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:40,970\nPacket manipulation, manipulation of the\nactual data packet itself, can be very,\n\n1625\n01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:43,284\nvery problematic if we're\nnot monitoring for that.\n\n1626\n01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:46,602\nWe don't actually have a picture of a data\npacket, or a data frame that we can throw\n\n1627\n01:19:46,602 --> 01:19:49,361\nup, but maybe we can find something\nquickly while we're talking.\n\n1628\n01:19:49,361 --> 01:19:50,336\n>> I'm sure I can find one.\n\n1629\n01:19:50,336 --> 01:19:52,334\n>> Just to show\nthe The header specifically,\n\n1630\n01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:55,177\nmaybe just talk a little bit\nabout things that go on in there.\n\n1631\n01:19:55,177 --> 01:19:58,210\nSo we'll let Don find that real\nquick while we're talking.\n\n1632\n01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,790\nBut just some things that we\nwanna just take a look at there.\n\n1633\n01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:03,750\nComplexity of the network is another\nthing we want to be thinking about as we\n\n1634\n01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:04,980\nlook in monitoring, right?\n\n1635\n01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,210\nHow big is our,\nyeah that might be a good one.\n\n1636\n01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:10,090\nHow big is our network, how complex is it?\n\n1637\n01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:11,210\nThings like that.\n\n1638\n01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:12,830\nWhat kind of encryption are we using?\n\n1639\n01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:15,260\nAre we using encryption?\n\n1640\n01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,760\nAre we using ipsec,\n\n1641\n01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:21,080\nare we using encrypting file system\nin the Microsoft world for instance.\n\n1642\n01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:25,760\nAre we using some sort of encryption\nsolution that is going to be\n\n1643\n01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,040\napplied to all data or\nselective to only certain data?\n\n1644\n01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,660\nData at rest as well as data on the move.\n\n1645\n01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,510\nIt's very important.\n\n1646\n01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,050\nWe call it data on the wire.\n\n1647\n01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,310\nSo could encrypt data during storage but\n\n1648\n01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:38,440\nwhile it's transiting we may\nchoose to not encrypt it.\n\n1649\n01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,720\nAnd this is something we\nhave to think about as well.\n\n1650\n01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,255\nAre we switching our networks?\n\n1651\n01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:43,510\nRight, do we have switch networks?\n\n1652\n01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:46,120\nAnd if so,\nwhat kind of switching is taking place?\n\n1653\n01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,985\nIs Is it a layer two,\nis it a layer three switch?\n\n1654\n01:20:48,985 --> 01:20:49,915\nHow does that work?\n\n1655\n01:20:49,915 --> 01:20:50,815\nWhat is that?\n\n1656\n01:20:50,815 --> 01:20:53,365\nThose are the kind of things\nwe want to think about, right?\n\n1657\n01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:55,315\nI think actually the other one we had,\nthe first one.\n\n1658\n01:20:55,315 --> 01:20:55,855\n>> That would be better?\n\n1659\n01:20:55,855 --> 01:20:57,485\n>> I think that would be good for\nwhat we want to talk about.\n\n1660\n01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,405\nYou know that's gonna be good.\n\n1661\n01:20:58,405 --> 01:20:59,618\n>> I was trying to give you options.\n\n1662\n01:20:59,618 --> 01:21:01,250\n[LAUGH]\n>> Options are good, we like options.\n\n1663\n01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:01,750\nRight?\nAnd so\n\n1664\n01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:04,130\nthe reason I asked Don to throw up this\n\n1665\n01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:07,180\npicture of the header of a data\npacket is the following.\n\n1666\n01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:11,200\nWhen we talk about manipulating\ndata inside of a data stream,\n\n1667\n01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,900\nwe talk about focusing on the header.\n\n1668\n01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,770\nAnd we talk about different areas within\nthe header that could be manipulated.\n\n1669\n01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:20,720\nThis area I'm thinking of specifically, or\none of the many ways, the IP flags area,\n\n1670\n01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,300\nI think it's in green there,\nright around the second error.\n\n1671\n01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,820\nWhoops, there we go.\n\n1672\n01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:26,380\nBump right into the camera and pull back.\n\n1673\n01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,500\nRight.\nSo, IP\n\n1674\n01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,290\nflag's right there as we're circling it,\nright.\n\n1675\n01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:33,250\nSo that area's gonna effectively\nbe a little series of check boxes,\n\n1676\n01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,400\nif you want to think of them this way,\nthat would turn on and\n\n1677\n01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:40,130\noff by activating or deactivating\nthese flags that signify function and\n\n1678\n01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:43,980\nstructure within the data stream in terms\nof the data packet and what it does.\n\n1679\n01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:48,420\nAnd when we turn these flags on we're\nenabling certain things to occur and\n\n1680\n01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:52,400\nwhen we turn them off we're disabling or\nnot allowing certain things to occur.\n\n1681\n01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,400\nAnd so focusing on this is one\nof the areas that we spend some\n\n1682\n01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,460\ntime on when we talk about attack vectors.\n\n1683\n01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:01,680\nCertain kinds of attack scans are gonna\nlook for these flags being turned on in\n\n1684\n01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:05,860\ncertain patterns to tell us whether or not\ncertain kinds of traffic is available, and\n\n1685\n01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:08,690\nas a result whether we can\nattack a machine a certain way.\n\n1686\n01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:12,260\nSo things like Xmas scans and\n\n1687\n01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,120\nthings of that nature will be\nthings we think about here.\n\n1688\n01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,930\nFragment offsets are also an area where we\nmay go in and try to spend some time and\n\n1689\n01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:24,380\nperhaps even look at manipulation\nbecause fragment offsets are gonna be\n\n1690\n01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:29,010\nthe coded sequencing of the packet in\nrelation to other packets around it.\n\n1691\n01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:32,970\nSo this may be packet 25 of 212, right?\n\n1692\n01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:36,800\nAnd so as a result of that,\nif we manipulate the fragment\n\n1693\n01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,540\noffsets in the sequencing we may be able\nto slip packets in out of sequence or\n\n1694\n01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,530\nperhaps stream them in\nto a data stream and\n\n1695\n01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:47,520\ncombine them with other\npackets to carry out attacks.\n\n1696\n01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,780\nSo this is important.\n\n1697\n01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:52,630\nWe could manipulate the time to\nlive variable which is in the third\n\n1698\n01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:53,900\nrow over there.\n\n1699\n01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,350\nRight, we may be able to do that and\n\n1700\n01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:59,810\nto do then be able to manipulate the kind\nof packet this is and trick IDS or\n\n1701\n01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:03,850\nIPS solutions into either passing or\nperhaps not passing this traffic\n\n1702\n01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:07,270\nbased on the profile, because different\noperating systems have different\n\n1703\n01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:11,940\nTTL Defaults that they assign to packets\nand we could spoof this traffic and make\n\n1704\n01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:15,940\nit look like it came from Linux as opposed\nto Windows box, things of that nature.\n\n1705\n01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,420\nSo there's lots of\ndifferent ways in here and\n\n1706\n01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,170\nthis is just scratching\nthe surface by the way.\n\n1707\n01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:22,765\nRight.\nWe could spend an entire day tearing apart\n\n1708\n01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:28,215\njust this area, delving into the structure\nthe architecture of IP and really nuts and\n\n1709\n01:23:28,215 --> 01:23:32,955\nbolts down at the very, very base level\nof this process explain to you how to\n\n1710\n01:23:32,955 --> 01:23:37,435\ntear apart these areas and use them to\nmanipulate information and to hack.\n\n1711\n01:23:37,435 --> 01:23:41,445\nAnd or to obfuscate or\nhide the access you're trying to achieve.\n\n1712\n01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:43,970\nBut what we're gonna do is just\nleave it at this point for now.\n\n1713\n01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:47,630\nGiving you some information about the\nkinds of things you may do, and encourage\n\n1714\n01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:53,270\nyou as an IP professional, listen to me,\nas an IP certified professional.\n\n1715\n01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:57,590\nAs as security professional, I would\nencourage you to think about going in and\n\n1716\n01:23:57,590 --> 01:24:00,790\nlooking more into\nthe structure of the IP stack.\n\n1717\n01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:03,040\nGet a better understanding\nof the networking.\n\n1718\n01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:07,860\nIn the upcoming episodes that we're gonna\nhave on network and network topology and\n\n1719\n01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:10,230\nthings of that nature in the SSCP area,\n\n1720\n01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:12,630\nwe're gonna delve a little bit\ndeeper into some of this stuff.\n\n1721\n01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:15,280\nBut there's so much to learn here and\nso much opportunity for\n\n1722\n01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,160\nyou to become more knowledgeable,\nmore focused on things that make you\n\n1723\n01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,250\na better professional in\nterms of executing security.\n\n1724\n01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:24,670\nSo take that to heart and think about it\nat the level that's appropriate for you.\n\n1725\n01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:27,380\nBut spend some time in here to\nbetter understand what's going on.\n\n1726\n01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:30,180\nSo these are the kinds of areas that\nwe would look at and we would monitor.\n\n1727\n01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,410\nThese are some of the things that\nwe would want to take a look at.\n\n1728\n01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:35,070\nThis really helps us focus on what\nI mentioned a minute ago which is\n\n1729\n01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,190\nanomalies, right.\n\n1730\n01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:41,490\nIf we have an anomalous TTL, a TTL that's\na Microsoft TTL, but it's a Linux packet,\n\n1731\n01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,830\nan IBS or a PS might be able to pick\nthat up because there may be other areas\n\n1732\n01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:49,200\ninside the header here that flag this\nas being a different Microsoft or\n\n1733\n01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:52,000\na different Linux version and\nthat may tell us something.\n\n1734\n01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,390\nThe IP flags being set in a different\nway from all those packets around them\n\n1735\n01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,550\ncould be an anomaly that\nwe may want to focus on.\n\n1736\n01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,370\nFragment offsets being\nmanipulated could be anomalies\n\n1737\n01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:04,040\nthat we want to focus on as well.\n\n1738\n01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,870\nSo we wanna look for those changes,\nthose different areas,\n\n1739\n01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:08,030\nthose things that stand out.\n\n1740\n01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:09,050\nWanna correlate them.\n\n1741\n01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:10,340\nThat's the term we often use.\n\n1742\n01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:14,470\nCorrelation is this idea of looking\nat all the things going on and\n\n1743\n01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:16,990\nfiguring which one of these\nthings is not like the others.\n\n1744\n01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:18,630\nWhich one of these things does not belong.\n\n1745\n01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:19,430\nRight?\n>> And you know,\n\n1746\n01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:21,860\na lot of the stuff is\nreally pretty simple.\n\n1747\n01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,770\nLet me jump back to the TTL for\na second, right?\n\n1748\n01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:24,380\nSo, oops.\n\n1749\n01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:26,027\nI'm gonna see what I can screw up here.\n\n1750\n01:25:26,027 --> 01:25:30,490\nWith a TTL if you know your traffic is\ncrossing a path that's 20 hops then as\n\n1751\n01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:34,004\nthe traffic flows,\nthe TTL should be decremented by 20.\n\n1752\n01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:36,824\nWell what if you see that it's\nactually been decremented by 21?\n\n1753\n01:25:36,824 --> 01:25:39,695\nThat can indicate there's a man\nin the middle attack happening\n\n1754\n01:25:39,695 --> 01:25:43,329\nsomewhere in between and that they're\nintercepting that traffic causing that\n\n1755\n01:25:43,329 --> 01:25:45,230\nextra point to get knocked off.\n\n1756\n01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:47,150\nIt's very simple to spot that, but\n\n1757\n01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:49,110\ncould you imagine trying\nto do that in real-time?\n\n1758\n01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:52,890\nWhen you have millions of frames\ncrossing your network per minute,\n\n1759\n01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:54,430\nit's not realistic, right?\n\n1760\n01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:57,580\nBut when we have equipment,\nwhen we have IPS and IDS devices,\n\n1761\n01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,580\nthey can do this very easily, right?\n\n1762\n01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:00,900\nThat's how they earn their keep.\n\n1763\n01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:04,000\nAnd they do it 24/7, 365 days a year.\n\n1764\n01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,330\nLike cheap labor.\n\n1765\n01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:06,338\n>> They never take a coffee break.\n\n1766\n01:26:06,338 --> 01:26:07,020\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n1767\n01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:07,650\n>> Very important.\n\n1768\n01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:09,110\n>> Their Starbucks bill is much smaller.\n\n1769\n01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,510\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1770\n01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:13,600\nSo correlating this information,\ndoing it in real time, very important.\n\n1771\n01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,290\nAnd using these systems, very important.\n\n1772\n01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:17,240\nWe talking about clipping levels already.\n\n1773\n01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,930\nThese are important around anomalies,\nbecause we want to have the baseline,\n\n1774\n01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:20,810\nthe threshold.\n\n1775\n01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:24,360\nAnd then the anomaly exists above or below\nit, depending on what we're looking for.\n\n1776\n01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,230\nSo we also wanna remember that we have\npotentially the idea here of false\n\n1777\n01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:28,840\npositives and false negatives.\n\n1778\n01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:33,650\nDon just brought up a great example of\ndecrementing a TTL based on hop count and\n\n1779\n01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:36,790\ndisplaying or knowing that that\nnumber should be x and it's y.\n\n1780\n01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:39,390\nAnd that may lead us to understand\nthat there's a man in the middle or\n\n1781\n01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:40,460\npotentially other things.\n\n1782\n01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:44,080\nWe could actually be rerouting traffic\nIn to a capture point and then back out\n\n1783\n01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,560\nagain, there is different ways we could\nbe looking at what that TTL means.\n\n1784\n01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,750\nBut at the end of the day\nthat is an anomaly.\n\n1785\n01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:52,490\nIt should be x, it is now y.\n\n1786\n01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:54,780\nYou can argue about what y means but\n\n1787\n01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:57,420\nyou can't argue about\nthe fact that it's not x.\n\n1788\n01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:01,480\nAs a result we have to look at false\npositives and false negatives.\n\n1789\n01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,200\nWe talked about this in one of\nthe earlier episodes when we talked about\n\n1790\n01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,990\nthe biometric discussion.\n\n1791\n01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:08,900\nThe false accept, false reject,\nand the cross-over error rates.\n\n1792\n01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,440\nIt's the same concept, right?\n\n1793\n01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:14,620\nIt's always better, right,\nto make sure that we are not\n\n1794\n01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:18,130\nallowing people in that don't belong\nthere, then denying people that\n\n1795\n01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:21,210\ndo belong the right to use the system,\nthe right to use it, right?\n\n1796\n01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:24,940\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nfalse positives and false negatives.\n\n1797\n01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:25,570\nVery important.\n\n1798\n01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:28,490\nThese can happen and they do happen\na great deal when we are monitoring,\n\n1799\n01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,960\nand we just wanna take that into\naccount and be aware of that, right?\n\n1800\n01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,750\nSo understand that, and\nDon's gonna just document that out for us.\n\n1801\n01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,560\nKinda write it up in\nthe notes as we're talking.\n\n1802\n01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,660\nSo that helps us a little bit,\nthat's great.\n\n1803\n01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:42,760\nSo log management, right, we typically as\nwe've shown you have a central repository.\n\n1804\n01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,500\nSo you're going to have\nsome sort of log in server.\n\n1805\n01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:47,602\nWe showed you a live demo of one,\nsomething as simple as Kiwi,\n\n1806\n01:27:47,602 --> 01:27:49,644\nwhich is just a free live sys log server.\n\n1807\n01:27:49,644 --> 01:27:50,200\nRight?\n\n1808\n01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,449\nBeen around forever, I think Solar Winds\nowns it now, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n1809\n01:27:53,449 --> 01:27:55,040\nThey own everything.\n\n1810\n01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,920\nSo you can use the real expensive one,\nor just get the generic one,\n\n1811\n01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:02,310\nbut Kiwi is one of those old school\ntools that's been around forever.\n\n1812\n01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:05,410\nWhen you used to mention CIS log server,\nsomebody would go do you have one?\n\n1813\n01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:07,370\nNo.\nHere, and they would just give you a copy.\n\n1814\n01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:12,370\nSo, you look for something like that but\nwhatever it is, send the logs out there,\n\n1815\n01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,880\naggregate them there,\nmake sure you have sufficient storage.\n\n1816\n01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,711\nNothing worse than having logs\nstreaming into the logging server and\n\n1817\n01:28:17,711 --> 01:28:19,431\nfinding out you ran out of space, right?\n\n1818\n01:28:19,431 --> 01:28:21,718\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that could be a bit of a challenge.\n\n1819\n01:28:21,718 --> 01:28:24,810\nRight, so just make sure you're aware\nof that, please be aware of that.\n\n1820\n01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:28,791\nAlso make sure you're not overwriting\nyour logs if you run out of space, right?\n\n1821\n01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:30,810\nThat's another thing, so cyclical logging,\n\n1822\n01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:34,250\nwhat we call circular logging\nis important to consider.\n\n1823\n01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:35,660\nTime synchronization, right?\n\n1824\n01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:38,010\nWe want to time stamp our logs and\nvalidate them,\n\n1825\n01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:41,490\nand we need to make sure\nwe're using NTP to do that.\n\n1826\n01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,560\nNTP is the network time protocol.\n\n1827\n01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,920\nLittle quick knowledge point for\nyou before you type in what I'm\n\n1828\n01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,780\nabout to ask everybody, do you know,\nand we'll stop here for\n\n1829\n01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:53,840\na second before we give you the answer,\ndo you know what port NTP runs on?\n\n1830\n01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,780\nAnd if you don't know, you need to know.\n\n1831\n01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:56,320\nRight?\n\n1832\n01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,310\nSo this is a great way to check\nsome knowledge really quickly.\n\n1833\n01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:02,220\nSo if you know what port NTB runs on,\ngood for you.\n\n1834\n01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,720\nIf you don't, take a second and\nfigure it out.\n\n1835\n01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,099\nAnd if you're not familiar with it,\nmake sure you make a note.\n\n1836\n01:29:07,099 --> 01:29:10,811\nIt's gonna be important to know the ports\nthe protocols run on, not just for\n\n1837\n01:29:10,811 --> 01:29:13,890\nan exam like this, but\nin general as a practitioner right?\n\n1838\n01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,064\nBecause if we don't know the port, how can\nwe possibly know what to monitor for and\n\n1839\n01:29:17,064 --> 01:29:20,152\nwhat to look for in logs when we look at\ncapture and traffic and things like that.\n\n1840\n01:29:20,152 --> 01:29:22,950\nSo having said that,\nlet's talk about what the port is.\n\n1841\n01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:26,590\nI gave you enough time to kind of figure\nit, out so any hands up there anybody?\n\n1842\n01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:28,030\nI don't see anything, no?\n\n1843\n01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:31,830\nSo port number 123 is what NTP runs on,\n\n1844\n01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:35,340\nwanna make sure we know that, again, it's\none of those things just to be aware of.\n\n1845\n01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,470\nAnd I'm gonna give you another knowledge\npoint you're gonna have to go out and\n\n1846\n01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:38,700\nfigure out for yourself.\n\n1847\n01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,200\nIs it a TCP or a UDP based protocol?\n\n1848\n01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,792\nRight, so in other words,\nis it run with TCP or UDP?\n\n1849\n01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:46,010\nConnection oriented, connection less.\n\n1850\n01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:48,890\nJust because we say it's a protocol\ndoesn't mean it automatically is\n\n1851\n01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:49,750\none or the other.\n\n1852\n01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:50,980\nIt can be either or.\n\n1853\n01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:54,300\nIt is not both, by the way,\nat the same time, just so you know.\n\n1854\n01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:56,200\nI'm not saying NTP is either or.\n\n1855\n01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,780\nJust wanna be clear,\na protocol is either or, but\n\n1856\n01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:01,690\nit is never both, just to be clear.\n\n1857\n01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:04,990\nSo you should make sure you are aware\nof that, by the way, as well.\n\n1858\n01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:06,660\nI'll leave that one up\nto you as homework for\n\n1859\n01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:10,020\nyou guys to figure out as you go\nback through and watch the episode.\n\n1860\n01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,430\nWe also wanna make sure we do\nprotection of our log files.\n\n1861\n01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:13,520\nHow do we retain them?\n\n1862\n01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,570\nHow do we secure them?\n\n1863\n01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:15,490\nWho has access to them?\n\n1864\n01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:18,880\nThese are all things to consider as we\nlook at components of a monitoring system.\n\n1865\n01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,740\nAll very important things to take on and\nunderstand.\n\n1866\n01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:24,940\nSo we've talked about different\nkinds of logs, where they come from,\n\n1867\n01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:28,920\nhow to get them, aggregating them\ninto a system, maybe firewall logs,\n\n1868\n01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,900\nmaybe some web servers,\nthings like that, right?\n\n1869\n01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:36,330\nSo let's talk a little bit and in just\nthe last few minutes we have left in this\n\n1870\n01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:39,720\nparticular episode,\nlet's talk a little bit about this idea of\n\n1871\n01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,190\nevent monitoring and information\nmonitoring from a security standpoint.\n\n1872\n01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:46,940\nWe hear about SEM, or SIM,\nor SIEM systems today,\n\n1873\n01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:50,480\nagain depends on your pronunciation,\nthe part of the country you come from, and\n\n1874\n01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,830\nwho you read and who you believe.\n\n1875\n01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:54,743\nRight, but at the end of the day,\nwhat we can argue about is perhaps\n\n1876\n01:30:54,743 --> 01:30:57,960\nthe pronunciation, but not the definition\nof what the acronyms mean.\n\n1877\n01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:01,920\nSo you'll see on the screen in front of\nyou, from a log management perspective,\n\n1878\n01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,423\nSEM, security event management,\nSEIM, right,\n\n1879\n01:31:04,423 --> 01:31:08,580\nmost people will refer to it that way,\nsecurity event and information management.\n\n1880\n01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:12,410\nWe add the information,\nthe I Into SEM in order to\n\n1881\n01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:17,200\nmake it more focused on a broader array\nof information that we want to capture.\n\n1882\n01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:21,770\nLarge number of devices and supported\napplications coming in with the systems.\n\n1883\n01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:25,450\nYou have some pretty high end\ntechnology that you deploy to do this.\n\n1884\n01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:28,510\nWe talked about this real time\nanalytic idea that Don brought\n\n1885\n01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:31,110\nup with millions of data\npackets streaming through and\n\n1886\n01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:33,930\nhaving to do the analytics\non that kind of data stream.\n\n1887\n01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:38,320\nSo we collect complex information,\nwe analyze the dashboard, and\n\n1888\n01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:44,342\nKPI it in real time, we then store it over\nthe longer term for analysis historically.\n\n1889\n01:31:44,342 --> 01:31:47,910\nWe're gonna be scalable here,\nthese systems can grow and be global.\n\n1890\n01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:49,430\nVery, very big potentially.\n\n1891\n01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:52,580\nWe have enterprise support for that,\nso you're typically dealing with large\n\n1892\n01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:57,050\nvendors, right, companies that are at\nthe top of their game in their areas.\n\n1893\n01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:01,100\nAnd you're gonna be dealing with\na system that you typically\n\n1894\n01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,950\nneed some hand holding on to get set up.\n\n1895\n01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:06,249\nRight, systems that typically are gonna\nrequire a little bit of training and\n\n1896\n01:32:06,249 --> 01:32:08,480\na little bit of understanding\nin order to run.\n\n1897\n01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,560\nBut they also will have\nembedded security knowledge.\n\n1898\n01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,540\nThey will have basically what we call\nknowledge basis built into them to\n\n1899\n01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,490\nhelp you to understand\nthe information that you are seeing.\n\n1900\n01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:19,884\nSo we have typically, the data repository,\nright, I think we've captured that,\n\n1901\n01:32:19,884 --> 01:32:22,200\ntalked a bit about that,\nwhere we put the data in.\n\n1902\n01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,480\nWe're gonna have the analysis of\nthe historical data, as we talked about.\n\n1903\n01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:29,190\nWe're gonna have reporting, which is very\nimportant, cuz we can extract the data and\n\n1904\n01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:30,310\ndo reporting.\n\n1905\n01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:34,130\nWe're gonna have multiple collection\npoints coming in from different places.\n\n1906\n01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:37,490\nWe can do almost near real\ntime correlation of data.\n\n1907\n01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:40,570\nWanna be clear about this, there is\na small delay with these devices, right?\n\n1908\n01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:43,870\nYou're not talking about a real time\nstream that literally comes in and\n\n1909\n01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:47,210\nthe second you see the packet hit\nthe wire, we know what it is.\n\n1910\n01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:50,080\nThere's gonna be an engine that\nhas to churn behind the scenes,\n\n1911\n01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,240\nrun through some complicated algorithms,\nand\n\n1912\n01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,930\nthen understand the data in\nrelation to other data points.\n\n1913\n01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:57,772\nSo we call them near real time\nas opposed to real time, and\n\n1914\n01:32:57,772 --> 01:33:00,320\nwe obviously as you saw\nhave things like consoles,\n\n1915\n01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,180\nright, that allow us to be\nable to manage these devices.\n\n1916\n01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:07,121\nWhen we talk about a SEM system,\nor a SEIM system,\n\n1917\n01:33:07,121 --> 01:33:11,291\nwe're typically talking about systems\nput in place, fairly expensive to do\n\n1918\n01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:14,836\nbecause we have regulatory\ncompliance issues we wanna address.\n\n1919\n01:33:14,836 --> 01:33:18,723\nRight, so the idea here is that these\ncomplicated systems help us to be on\n\n1920\n01:33:18,723 --> 01:33:23,010\nthe right side of our audits, as we've\ntalked about on our prior episodes.\n\n1921\n01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:28,050\nBut also making sure that we can validate\nthat we are applying our procedures,\n\n1922\n01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:32,260\nour policies, and our standards to\nthe level that the business is expecting.\n\n1923\n01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:33,890\nThis is typically what we are doing.\n\n1924\n01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:37,328\nWe have to show compliance on\nsometimes a per user basis for\n\n1925\n01:33:37,328 --> 01:33:39,864\ntransactional data using these systems.\n\n1926\n01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:42,840\nAny experience with them\nin the corporate world?\n\n1927\n01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:46,940\n>> Yeah, I've used several different ones,\nsome that were incredibly expensive,\n\n1928\n01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:48,850\nsome that were moderately expensive.\n\n1929\n01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,818\nI don't think I've ever used\none that wasn't expensive.\n\n1930\n01:33:50,818 --> 01:33:55,112\nThat's like the common element between\nthem all, and some of them, like\n\n1931\n01:33:55,112 --> 01:34:00,050\nthe Solar Winds one, it usually runs, it\ndepends on the size of your organization.\n\n1932\n01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:03,760\nFor small or medium business,\nit's normally in the four to $5,000 range.\n\n1933\n01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,090\nI've used CA Unicenter.\n\n1934\n01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,460\nI don't know if you've ever\nworked with Unicenter.\n\n1935\n01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:08,587\n>> Oh, sure.\n>> And there you're talking about millions\n\n1936\n01:34:08,587 --> 01:34:09,170\nof dollars.\n\n1937\n01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:11,980\nOur budget on that project was ridiculous.\n\n1938\n01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:15,090\nBut they're very, very powerful because\nyou have too much information to\n\n1939\n01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:17,560\ninterpret, and\nthat's what these systems are doing.\n\n1940\n01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:22,910\nAnd if you have a business that has,\nfor our Unicenter deployment\n\n1941\n01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:27,500\nwe had 110 branches across the state,\nfirewalls at every one of them.\n\n1942\n01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,480\nWe had our corporate office,\nwe had thousands of employees.\n\n1943\n01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,960\nThat is a lot of systems to monitor.\n\n1944\n01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,490\n>> It is.\n\n1945\n01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:34,720\n>> Just even standard health.\n\n1946\n01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,820\nIs the computer on or off?\n\n1947\n01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:36,490\n>> Right, right.\n\n1948\n01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:38,470\n>> That's still a lot of information.\n\n1949\n01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:39,060\n>> Absolutely.\n>> But\n\n1950\n01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:40,690\nthen to add security on\ntop of that is a big deal.\n\n1951\n01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:46,050\nSo having these systems is, it's worth\nthe money, even as expensive as they are.\n\n1952\n01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:48,500\n>> We often talk about that rule\nof every time you add a feature,\n\n1953\n01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,546\nyou add a zero, right?\n\n1954\n01:34:49,546 --> 01:34:54,030\nThat's just a generic rule within IT,\nand it applies to these systems as well\n\n1955\n01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:57,030\nbecause we really are talking about\nsystems that even at the low end,\n\n1956\n01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,980\nat the entry level, right?\n\n1957\n01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,190\nSomething that is several\nthousand dollars.\n\n1958\n01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:03,559\nWe don't wanna make light of the fact that\nwhile that might not be a lot of money to\n\n1959\n01:35:03,559 --> 01:35:05,835\nsome businesses,\nthat is a tremendous investment.\n\n1960\n01:35:05,835 --> 01:35:10,124\nRight, a small business, maybe 20,\n30, 40 users, still has needs, and\n\n1961\n01:35:10,124 --> 01:35:14,601\nstill has these security needs, but they\nclearly are not gonna be able $1 million,\n\n1962\n01:35:14,601 --> 01:35:16,965\nright, nor should they, by the way\n>> Right,\n\n1963\n01:35:16,965 --> 01:35:18,560\n>> To be able to deploy that system.\n\n1964\n01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,248\nBut that doesn't mean that\nthe investment that they make\n\n1965\n01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:24,216\nin security Is any less important\nthan the multimillion dollar\n\n1966\n01:35:24,216 --> 01:35:28,110\ninvestment that a global entity may\nmake to achieve the same end result.\n\n1967\n01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:31,480\nIt's not about the size, in other words,\nof the investment, right?\n\n1968\n01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,570\nBut what it is about is\nthe appropriateness,\n\n1969\n01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:37,580\nthe context of that investment to\nmake sure it achieves the end result,\n\n1970\n01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:39,530\nthe goal that we've been talking about.\n\n1971\n01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:40,730\nAnd as a a result of that you,\n\n1972\n01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:45,320\nas a security professional, have to help\nthe business to broker this conversation.\n\n1973\n01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:48,845\nMake the common sense\ndata available to people.\n\n1974\n01:35:48,845 --> 01:35:53,200\nHelp the business to understand\nthat you can do just as well with\n\n1975\n01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:57,790\nthat tool at that level of investment,\nprovided you're using it smartly.\n\n1976\n01:35:57,790 --> 01:36:01,730\nAs you can with the,\ngot to have everything in the shop tool,\n\n1977\n01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:05,390\nthat may sit under utilized for\nyears and never really realized\n\n1978\n01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:08,880\nthe return on investment that we obviously\nhave to have for something like that.\n\n1979\n01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,000\nSo, just a good way of maybe\nwrapping up that conversation and\n\n1980\n01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,238\nputting that into an appropriate context.\n\n1981\n01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:16,260\n>> Yeah, all right,\nwell ladies and gentlemen,\n\n1982\n01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:20,110\nlet me just remind you guys if you\never have any questions on any of\n\n1983\n01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:24,090\nthe topics that we talk about during the\nshow, well, you know live during the show.\n\n1984\n01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:28,590\nYou can go to itpro.tv/live, you'll see\nthe chat box right beneath the video.\n\n1985\n01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:33,120\nYou can post your questions,\nask away we like to monitor that and\n\n1986\n01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:34,120\nanswer that during the show.\n\n1987\n01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,710\nIt's always kind of fun to have\nsomething different to talk about.\n\n1988\n01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:36,288\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1989\n01:36:36,288 --> 01:36:40,013\n>> The other thing is, if you're watching\nthis show recorded later on down the road,\n\n1990\n01:36:40,013 --> 01:36:41,775\nyou can always use our Q and A system.\n\n1991\n01:36:41,775

and welcome everybody to\nanother episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,830\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nhere with Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n6\n00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,170\nAnd we're gonna

and some-\n\n9\n00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,450\n>> IPS, and firewalls.\n\n10\n00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,260\n>> Firewalls.\n>> Talk\n\n11\n00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,880\nabout all that cool stuff that\ngets between you and the bad guys.\n\n12\n00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,880\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you're not careful, between you and\n\n13\n00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,490\nthe good guys.\n\n14\n00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,877\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it could also backfire on\n\n15\n00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:58,229\nyou if you don't know what you're doing,\nbut we'll talk about that.\n\n16\n00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:59,195\n>> It can very easily, can't it?\n\n17\n00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:00,430\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n18\n00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,160\nSo certainly welcome back.\n\n19\n00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,880\nAlways good to see everybody back again.\n\n20\n00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,870\nWe'll continue our conversations.\n\n21\n00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,530\nAnd what we want to do, is really flesh\nout a little bit around this idea.\n\n22\n00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,840\nAs we're looking at monitoring and\nanalysis, we've already spent some time\n\n23\n00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,670\nin prior episodes talking\nabout how to go through and\n\n24\n00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,870\nat a high level understand and examine\nthe idea of creating an audit plan.\n\n25\n00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,160\nWhat is entailed in that,\nwhat are we looking at,\n\n26\n00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,620\nwhy do we want to monitor certain things.\n\n27\n00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,260\nWe talked at a high level\nabout what a NID and a HID is,\n\n28\n00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,860\na network versus a host based IDS.\n\n29\n00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,140\nAnd how one is in real time or\nalmost real time.\n\n30\n00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,870\nThe other is gonna be based on the host\nwith some sort of agent monitoring, but\n\n31\n00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,410\nnot really capturing data for\nreal time analysis.\n\n32\n00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,680\nAnd so we're gonna go back through some of\nthat stuff, but also add some layers of\n\n33\n00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,930\ncomplexity and richness to the mix here\nby delving down into some of the detail.\n\n34\n00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,350\nWe're gonna take a quick look at, and\n\n35\n00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,210\nI think we're actually gonna\nput that up right now.\n\n36\n00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,861\nTake a quick look at this little\npicture that we put together for you.\n\n37\n00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:55,882\nJust so that we, number one,\nhad something to do,\n\n38\n00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,622\ncuz we were a little\nbored during the break.\n\n39\n00:01:57,622 --> 00:02:00,924\nWe thought we'd draw something, but\nmore importantly and more correctly,\n\n40\n00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:04,045\nwe wanted to have a way of visualizing\nsome of these discussions for you.\n\n41\n00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:05,532\nAt least as a starting point, right.\n\n42\n00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:06,982\nTo get out of the gate a little bit,\n\n43\n00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:09,782\ngive you a graphic that may be able\nto put some of this into context.\n\n44\n00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:13,096\nBecause you hear us talk about\na lot of these technologies.\n\n45\n00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,584\nAnd if you're not using\nthem on a regular basis,\n\n46\n00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:18,512\nyou may not be the firewall\nperson in your organization.\n\n47\n00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:21,710\nYou may not have access to the IDS or\nIPS or your network,\n\n48\n00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,540\nif it's small enough,\nmay not actually run one of these, right?\n\n49\n00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,400\n>> Right, right absolutely.\n\n50\n00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,850\n>> And so as a result,\n\n51\n00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,190\nif the only thing you've really got access\nto is perhaps a router and a switch.\n\n52\n00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,770\nAnd you've seen those and\nwe see those on the diagram.\n\n53\n00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,070\nYou may not be familiar with where to\nplace some of these other solutions.\n\n54\n00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,760\n>> Kind of gives us a big picture of\nwhere this stuff is fitting in and\n\n55\n00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,720\nwhere it's going in my network.\n\n56\n00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,510\n>> Absolutely.\n\n57\n00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,375\nAnd so you know, we just wanted\nto help you to visualize that.\n\n58\n00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,440\nAnd you know, Mike's going to be available\nafter the show for signed copies.\n\n59\n00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,265\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He'll be doing those out in the lobby.\n\n60\n00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:52,145\nYou guys can stop by,\nwe'll have a little coffee.\n\n61\n00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:53,395\nIt'll be great.\n\n62\n00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:56,905\nSo the reality of this is what we're\ntrying to illustrate for you here,\n\n63\n00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:59,905\njust at a high level is\ngoing to be where we see\n\n64\n00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:02,665\nthe flow of information coming in and\ngoing out of the network.\n\n65\n00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:05,295\nAnd as a result, we want to then\nbe able to understand how to\n\n66\n00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:08,150\nplace some of these technologies\ninto the conversation.\n\n67\n00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,610\nAlso into the architecture, and as we\nmove them around, talk about their role.\n\n68\n00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,660\nMaybe understand some scenarios about\nwhere they may or may not live,\n\n69\n00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,870\nbased on what they're doing.\n\n70\n00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,680\nSo if we start at the upper\nright hand side of the diagram,\n\n71\n00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440\nwhere we see internet cloud.\n\n72\n00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,650\nAnd we think about the internet\ncloud off to the right there,\n\n73\n00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,230\nI think Mike's going to highlight it or\nat least just point to it there.\n\n74\n00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,500\nGot a little red underscore for\nthe Internet.\n\n75\n00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,280\nWe talked about that\ntraditionally is the cloud.\n\n76\n00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,940\nAnd the idea there is that information's\ngonna come in from outside of our network.\n\n77\n00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,910\nWe talked about that being an ingress\npathway coming through a router.\n\n78\n00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,710\nAnd that ingress or inbound traffic flow\nIs gonna come through the router and\n\n79\n00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,930\nthen hit the firewall.\n\n80\n00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,100\nAnd that brick wall, traditionally, in our\ndiagrams always represents the firewall.\n\n81\n00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,550\nWe chose to go with the one without\nthe fire burning on the top for\n\n82\n00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,200\nthe firewall today, right?\n\n83\n00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,590\nA little slow today, we didn't put the\nfire on, but typically you see that as,\n\n84\n00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,110\nusually it does have\na little line of fire on it.\n\n85\n00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,090\nWe didn't have the feature pack,\nVisio, I guess, for the fire.\n\n86\n00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,420\nYou can see we do have the brick\nwall to represent a firewall.\n\n87\n00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,810\nThere we go,\ngot the little fire happening up there.\n\n88\n00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,350\nAnd so we got our little fire\ngoing on on the firewall.\n\n89\n00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,830\nAnd in this particular diagram, we chose\nto create our DMZ, as you can see,\n\n90\n00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,500\noff to the left out beyond\nthe first switch there.\n\n91\n00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,830\nIn another area, we've got a couple of non\ndescript servers hanging out in the DMZ.\n\n92\n00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,670\nYou know they could be database servers,\nthey could be web servers.\n\n93\n00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:34,030\nThey could be a DHCP or\na DNS network service kind of solution.\n\n94\n00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,130\nSitting there to maybe\nservice other machines.\n\n95\n00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,040\n>> Things we need to\ngive public access to.\n\n96\n00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,220\n>> Public access to that could be a nack\nsolution that maybe sitting in there.\n\n97\n00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,100\nWe're doing some network\naccess control and\n\n98\n00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,080\nquarantining in the DMZ, some remediation.\n\n99\n00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,690\nThere could be some sort of maybe\na download server that's sitting there.\n\n100\n00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,180\nThat is going to download\na bunch of content,\n\n101\n00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,960\nthen move it securely back with some sort\nof port map beyond the DMZ into the LAN.\n\n102\n00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,330\nThere's a lot of potential things\nthat could be going on there.\n\n103\n00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,170\nSo we're not as concerned about what those\nboxes represent as we are just about\n\n104\n00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,990\nknowing that there's a lot of things\nthat might find homes in the DMZ.\n\n105\n00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,900\nBut we've chosen to go with\na firewall that's just simply gonna\n\n106\n00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,870\nrepresent a single firewall as\nopposed to a two DMZ firewall.\n\n107\n00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,240\n>> Screen subnet.\n\n108\n00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,122\n>> So a screen subnet basically,\nright exactly.\n\n109\n00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:17,202\nSo this could be one physical firewall or\n\n110\n00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:21,554\na software based firewall that's running\non a machine that has multiple adapters.\n\n111\n00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,110\nBased for a multi-home and\nwe're simply creating logical extensions.\n\n112\n00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,740\nAlmost like V lamps in\na screen subnet scenario.\n\n113\n00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,620\n>> Right.\n>> Where we're gonna add those networks in\n\n114\n00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,180\nand then create the opportunity to do\nisolation with the DNZ, the LAN, and\n\n115\n00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,130\nmaybe even a test dev environment.\n\n116\n00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,720\nThat may be off on a separate network,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n117\n00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,790\nGuest network access could be given\nhere as well, things like that.\n\n118\n00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,380\nRight?\n\n119\n00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,060\nAnd so we have a switch over there, and\n\n120\n00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,540\nthen coming down straight\ndown towards six o'cllock.\n\n121\n00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,830\nIf we think about a clock motif here for\na minute.\n\n122\n00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,370\nGot another switch that'll be\nable to give us the ability\n\n123\n00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,250\nto see the LAN going on there.\n\n124\n00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,560\nAgain, we got some machines\njust sitting out there.\n\n125\n00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,940\nWe got a laptop representing\nsome sort of a workstation.\n\n126\n00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,035\nWe're getting rid of our\nlogging server looks like, so\n\n127\n00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:03,425\nMike's decided he doesn't\nwant a logging server there.\n\n128\n00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:04,665\nWe're gonna cross that out.\n\n129\n00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,034\nSo we've got a logging server there.\n\n130\n00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:09,240\nAnd the reason we labeled that\nactually as a logging server is a very\n\n131\n00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,221\nimportant reason.\n\n132\n00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:12,520\nBecause off to the right that's\nfree floating right now.\n\n133\n00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,855\nWhat we're seeing, is we're seeing\na IDSIPS device of some kind.\n\n134\n00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,130\nDoesn't really matter what.\n\n135\n00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,510\nAnd we didn't connect it directly to\nthe network in this diagram just to\n\n136\n00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,180\nhave it out there.\n\n137\n00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,000\nTo number one, make it very easy to see.\n\n138\n00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,520\nBut number two,\n\n139\n00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,120\nto show you that logically there\nare a few places we could plug this in.\n\n140\n00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,090\nBut wherever we plug it in,\nwe'll draw some lines.\n\n141\n00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,160\nMike will help me just put some lines\nout here to connect it in just a second.\n\n142\n00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,060\nBut wherever we ultimately put it in, we\nwanna understand that that log in server\n\n143\n00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,790\nsitting on the LAN is gonna provide us\nthe opportunity to gather all the data.\n\n144\n00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,310\nAll the information that's\nbeing logged at that IDSIPS.\n\n145\n00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,240\nSafely secured and stored for analysis,\nreporting, archival retrieval, over\n\n146\n00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,380\ntime if we need it, compliance, and all\nthe things that we've been talking about.\n\n147\n00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,840\nSo we wouldn't put it in the DMZ,\n\n148\n00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,140\nbecause we would be exposing\nit unnecessarily there.\n\n149\n00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,720\n>> Right, right.\n>> It would not be secure so\n\n150\n00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,780\nclearly not on the left-hand side of the\ndiagram, but rather down below in the LAN.\n\n151\n00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,290\nWhere it's behind additional\nsecurity layers and\n\n152\n00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,830\nwe can then keep an eye on it and\nsafeguard it.\n\n153\n00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,920\nIt's a good thought process for\nus engage in and just think about.\n\n154\n00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,010\nAnd before we connect up the IDSIPS and\ntalk about where it lives and\n\n155\n00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,040\nthen I want to talk about\nthe types of firewalls we have.\n\n156\n00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,600\nMake sure we understand those and\nthe types of IDSIPS solutions we may see.\n\n157\n00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,900\nWe wanna also take a moment and\n\n158\n00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,120\njust help you to understand\nthat doing something like this.\n\n159\n00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,210\nWalking through a diagram, laying\nout some shapes on a page literally.\n\n160\n00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,560\nBut logically laying out\nyour network to Apology and\n\n161\n00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,870\nhelping to get it straight in your head,\nright, as an exercise.\n\n162\n00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,840\nCould be so incredibly valuable as you're\nlooking, not only to plan out a network.\n\n163\n00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,920\nThis may be one of the first times you're\nbeing asked to do a design document by\n\n164\n00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,890\nyour boss.\n\n165\n00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,680\nSo there are obviously tools out there.\n\n166\n00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,159\nVisio, which is what we used to create\nthis little diagram, pretty quickly.\n\n167\n00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,090\nCould be a very valuable tool,\nyou could use any kind of\n\n168\n00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,556\ntool that has shapes that allows\nyou to do usage case scenarios.\n\n169\n00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:02,708\nAnd UML, universal modeling language,\n\n170\n00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,961\nIs gonna be the language that's used by\nbusiness analysts to do this kind of work.\n\n171\n00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:09,320\nSo any of those tools that\nare out there to let you do it.\n\n172\n00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,160\nYou could simply get a tablet and\njust do some free form drawing.\n\n173\n00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,580\nAs we have seen, you know Mike's been\ndoodling a little bit on the screen there.\n\n174\n00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,394\nWe're probably not going to let\nhim do any freestyle drawing for\n\n175\n00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:20,445\nour network diagrams.\n\n176\n00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:22,538\nWe're going to make him stick\nto the predefined shapes, but.\n\n177\n00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:23,494\n>> We might lose all our servers.\n\n178\n00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:25,406\n>> Right, we might not be able\ntell what's what there, right?\n\n179\n00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:27,350\nIt looks like a server,\nwe're not quite sure.\n\n180\n00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,960\nBut the reality is that you\ncan use almost any tool.\n\n181\n00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,207\nAnd what I want you to understand,\n\n182\n00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:33,235\nI don't want this to be\na complicated exercise for you.\n\n183\n00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:35,070\nAnd I don't think we have\nto belabor the point.\n\n184\n00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,980\nBut there's so much value in you\ntaking the time to sit down and\n\n185\n00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,360\nwalk this through in your head,\nget it on paper, see what's there so\n\n186\n00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,110\nthat you don't leave anything\nout number one, real important.\n\n187\n00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,275\nAnd number two that if you put something\nin the wrong place, in your mind,\n\n188\n00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,355\nyou might be going over it saying yeah,\nand it's over there.\n\n189\n00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:54,115\nIt doesn't really, you don't catch it, but\nwhen you have to lay it out on paper and\n\n190\n00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:55,015\nlook at it and label,\n\n191\n00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:58,575\nit then it really becomes apparent to you\nif something is not where it should be.\n\n192\n00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:02,355\nIf the logging server inadvertently\nwound up in the DMZ we would wanna\n\n193\n00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,360\ncorrect that as we're going through here.\n\n194\n00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,118\nSo think about the value\nof doing this exercise.\n\n195\n00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:09,484\nIt may be good for you,\nas you prepare for your SSCP exam,\n\n196\n00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:13,700\nto go through and think through\nsomething like this, to be clear.\n\n197\n00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,580\nRight?\nYou're not going to be\n\n198\n00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,430\nasked to lay out a network\ndiagram on an exam like this.\n\n199\n00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,920\nThese exams are not interactive\nthe way maybe a Cisco exam would be,\n\n200\n00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,510\nright, where you may have\na simulated environment.\n\n201\n00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,920\nYou may have to write some commands\ninto an IOS shell and do some things,\n\n202\n00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120\nprogram a router.\n\n203\n00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,300\nThere obviously it's gonna be important\nin the VMware exams, at the VCAP level,\n\n204\n00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,510\nyou have to go in and actually use live\nlab environments to produce topologies and\n\n205\n00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,430\nbe able to reconfigure networks and\ndo things on the fly.\n\n206\n00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,334\nWe're not gonna be asked to do that\nkind of stuff in an exam like this.\n\n207\n00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:47,230\nYou are gonna be asked a series of\nquestions, some may be scenario based,\n\n208\n00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,260\nsome may be multiple choice,\nthings like that.\n\n209\n00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,720\nYou may see a network diagram and\n\n210\n00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,640\nbe asked something about it, but\nyou're not gonna have to create one, so\n\n211\n00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,173\nit's not so much about that for the exam,\nbut it really is about real-world skills.\n\n212\n00:09:58,173 --> 00:09:59,605\nAnd gathering that knowledge and\n\n213\n00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:02,365\nobviously becoming more\nconfident at the end of the day.\n\n214\n00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:04,125\nSo, the IDS/IPS,\nwhere are we gonna put that?\n\n215\n00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,825\nSo, we have a few options, right?\n\n216\n00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:10,736\nWe could, theoretically if we chose to,\nwe could integrate that IDS/IPS between\n\n217\n00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,110\nthe LAN and the switch that's coming\noff the firewall there, right?\n\n218\n00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,560\nSo literally,\nalmost like right over there, right?\n\n219\n00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,270\nWe could connect it there,\nthat would be one way.\n\n220\n00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,320\nAnd what that would let us do is\nto focus on the inbound, right,\n\n221\n00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,136\nthe inbound traffic and\nor outbound, right?\n\n222\n00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:26,650\nEgress and ingress traffic coming in and\nout of the LAN.\n\n223\n00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,520\nAnd that's going to be\na very important place for\n\n224\n00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,360\nus to create a choke point\nto be able to monitor.\n\n225\n00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,370\nBut we may also want to\nput one into the DMZ.\n\n226\n00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,380\nSo we may actually see\na connection going in.\n\n227\n00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,990\nAgain, typically,\non either side of the switch in reality,\n\n228\n00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,490\nand it won't necessarily\nmatter where we put it as much\n\n229\n00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,990\nas knowing we want to\nmonitor what's in the DMZ.\n\n230\n00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,720\nMonitor traffic flow in and out of there.\n\n231\n00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,150\nAnd we could also decide\nto put it actually\n\n232\n00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,470\nIn front of the firewall\nbehind the router.\n\n233\n00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,250\nSo in other words,\ncoming in right there, right?\n\n234\n00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,190\nWe could put it behind the router,\ncoming in on the external spur.\n\n235\n00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,880\nBut logically in front of the firewall,\nbecause these systems tend to have\n\n236\n00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,710\nfirewall capabilities integrated in today,\nright?\n\n237\n00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,850\nSo we could actually see it\nsitting literally as the firewall,\n\n238\n00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,380\nkind of an all-in-one, if you will.\n\n239\n00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,520\nAnd we may see it sitting there, and\n\n240\n00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,130\nthen run all the traffic through\nit as our first chokepoint.\n\n241\n00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,860\nNow the reason I chose to have you\nput it outside of the firewall,\n\n242\n00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,120\nalmost in the cloud, and we could actually\ndraw another line where we put it\n\n243\n00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,960\nright up into the could, and\nI'm gonna explain why, into the internet.\n\n244\n00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,453\nIs that we may choose to contract with\na third party source provider, right?\n\n245\n00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,758\nWe may have a cloud provider.\n\n246\n00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:32,760\nSomething like Postini, for instance, or\nany of the vendors out there that do cloud\n\n247\n00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,130\nbased services today, that are gonna\noffer these kind of capabilities\n\n248\n00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,380\non a front end prior to any\ntraffic coming into our router.\n\n249\n00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,840\nSo we could actually see it positioned\nthere as well, and we may decide that\n\n250\n00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,930\nthat's gonna be our first round and\naffect our first filtering solution.\n\n251\n00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,720\nWe're then gonna take what\nwe think is relatively safe,\n\n252\n00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,140\nmore often than not\nrelatively good traffic in.\n\n253\n00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,850\nWe're not going to get tricked into\nnot running another IDS/IPS without\n\n254\n00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,850\njust letting traffic in, but\nwe are going to do that first pass,\n\n255\n00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,000\noffload it at the vendor,\nlet them go through it and filter.\n\n256\n00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,560\nWe tend to do this for\nthings like spam for e-mail, for instance,\n\n257\n00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,610\nthings like that.\n\n258\n00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,780\nAnd then coming in, we're then gonna\nrun different filtering solutions\n\n259\n00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,390\nto capture different kinds of traffic and\n\n260\n00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,200\nlook at different kinds of\nbehavior inside the network.\n\n261\n00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,700\nSo we could see three or four of these\nsolutions deployed in different areas of\n\n262\n00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,490\nour network depending on the goal and\n\n263\n00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,260\nwhat we're looking to do as\npart of our architecture.\n\n264\n00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,160\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n265\n00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,220\nBut however we see them,\nwherever we're deployed,\n\n266\n00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,970\nwe always want to remember that IDS/IPS\nfeeds back to the logging server.\n\n267\n00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,471\nAnd so we always see a tie back somehow,\nas Mike's putting in there for us,\n\n268\n00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:32,880\nwhere it comes back.\n\n269\n00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,839\nAnd all that information gets\nfed into the logging server,\n\n270\n00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,930\nwhich then is used by users,\nadministrative users, right?\n\n271\n00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,296\nWith rights, to do a variety of\nthings that we've already discussed.\n\n272\n00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:43,110\nSo.\n>> And it'd still be connected somewhere,\n\n273\n00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,300\nwherever you've chosen to put it.\n\n274\n00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,954\n>> Absolutely, so yeah,\n\n275\n00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:46,961\nwe're definitely gonna see multiple\nconnections coming out of there.\n\n276\n00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:49,422\nAnd remember,\nthis is typically hardware, but\n\n277\n00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:51,650\nthese could be software solutions as well.\n\n278\n00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,840\nWe have a combination.\n\n279\n00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,990\nAnd a lot of times these could be\nvirtualized solutions, where we do have,\n\n280\n00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,790\ntypically the high end stuff's all\nrack mounted, hardware based devices.\n\n281\n00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,910\nBut some of the software\nstuff could be virtualized,\n\n282\n00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,860\nrunning inside virtual machines today,\nor running in the cloud.\n\n283\n00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,080\nAnd so\nwe have a variety of opportunities here,\n\n284\n00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,780\nand a variety of options to engage in\nterms of our design methodologies.\n\n285\n00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,790\nSo hopefully, that little review at\nleast gets you on the right track,\n\n286\n00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,285\nputs you in the right frame of mind to\nthink about some of these solutions.\n\n287\n00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:19,562\nNow we wanna go in and\ndefine this terminology a little bit more.\n\n288\n00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:23,192\nRefine what a IDS is specifically,\nthe difference between a network and\n\n289\n00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,094\na host based one.\n\n290\n00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,363\nThe difference between those and IPSs.\n\n291\n00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:29,880\nSo reactive versus proactive, right?\n\n292\n00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,760\nAnd we also wanna talk about firewalls\nwhat those different firewall apologies or\n\n293\n00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,060\ndesigns are like.\n\n294\n00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,910\nThat may be a good place for us to talk\na bit about firewall generations, right?\n\n295\n00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,458\nAnd talk about what those are.\n\n296\n00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,494\nSo, I think we have some notes on that\nthat we're going to put up for you.\n\n297\n00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:45,159\nAnd so, what we wanna do is quickly go\nthrough the different generations of\n\n298\n00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,150\nfirewalls.\n\n299\n00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,330\nMake sure we're comfortable with them,\nthat we understand what they are.\n\n300\n00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,660\nMike's been kind enough to type all of\nthat out for us and lay us out here.\n\n301\n00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,880\nAnd it's actually nice and\n\n302\n00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,640\nthis time we've got the nice font there so\nyou can see everything.\n\n303\n00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,875\nSo you don't need the magnifying glasses\nthe way you did in the other episode,\n\n304\n00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,520\nbefore we figured out how to do that.\n\n305\n00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,570\nSo we got all the kinks\nworked out on this one.\n\n306\n00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,560\n>> We think so.\n\n307\n00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,280\nLet's hope so, yeah.\n\n308\n00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,200\n>> Yeah, well we hope right?\n\n309\n00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,050\nWe hope so.\n\n310\n00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,120\nFirewall generation.\n\n311\n00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,666\nSo let's talk about these.\n\n312\n00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,838\nWe have typically what are referred\nto as five generations of\n\n313\n00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:15,210\nfirewalls that are available or\nhave been available over time.\n\n314\n00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,580\nWe don't tend to see all of\nthese running all the time and\n\n315\n00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,200\nsome of these are much older, right?\n\n316\n00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,390\nFirst gen and second gen firewalls\nhave been around for a long time.\n\n317\n00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,150\nFifth gen are what are called\nnext gen firewalls are newer.\n\n318\n00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,900\nAnd as a result,\n\n319\n00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,190\nare maybe not as prevalent depending\non the kind of solutions you have.\n\n320\n00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,070\nAgain, some of these,\n\n321\n00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,790\nremember, are gonna be software, some\ncould be hardware, combination of these.\n\n322\n00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,066\nToday a lot of these are integrated\ninto the NID and or the HID solution.\n\n323\n00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:42,306\nWe have local firewalls running on a host,\nbut typically network-based firewalls, or\n\n324\n00:14:42,306 --> 00:14:45,076\nNIDs, rather,\nnetwork-based intrusion detection and\n\n325\n00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:48,600\nprevention systems, will tend to\nhave firewall capabilities built in.\n\n326\n00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,080\nI mean, our home devices,\nour home wireless gateways,\n\n327\n00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,940\ntend to have firewalls built in today.\n\n328\n00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,960\nYou can get a firewall pretty\nmuch anywhere today, right?\n\n329\n00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,850\nSo just be thinking about that.\n\n330\n00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,990\nSo let's talk about gen one or\nwhat we call first gen firewalls.\n\n331\n00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,740\nThese are packet filters,\ntraditionally that's how we refer to them.\n\n332\n00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,420\nAnd these will be things like\nmaybe screening routers, right?\n\n333\n00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,240\nSo a router that does some basic\nfiltering and screening for\n\n334\n00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,010\nus, will access control lists\nsomething like that may be on there.\n\n335\n00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,200\nThings that are operating at\nthe network and transport level.\n\n336\n00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,080\nOr excuse me, network and transport layer,\n\n337\n00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,780\nI should say, of the OSI model\nare going to be packet filters.\n\n338\n00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,570\nSo we're talking about basically\nbeing up at layer three and\n\n339\n00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,630\nlayer four of the OSI model,\nif we're going up from the bottom, right?\n\n340\n00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,240\nWe'll be talking about the OSI model\nin one of our other episodes in\n\n341\n00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,340\nthe networking area, so you'll have\nfun with the OSI model refresh there.\n\n342\n00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,140\nBut for now, just talking about the\nnetwork and the transport layer, right?\n\n343\n00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,280\nThese are gonna be things\nthat we see there.\n\n344\n00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,520\nWe're gonna basically be examining\nsource and destination IP addresses.\n\n345\n00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,490\nThat's what we're gonna be doing when\nwe take a look at packet filters.\n\n346\n00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,620\nSo inbound and outbound, we're gonna\nbe looking at the packet headers.\n\n347\n00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,960\nIf you remember in the last episodes that\nwe talked about we actuallye threw up\n\n348\n00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,912\na graphic of the IP header for you.\n\n349\n00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:02,968\nDelved into some of the things that\nwent on there with the TCP flags,\n\n350\n00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:06,950\nthe TTL values, and the source or\nthe fragmentation offset.\n\n351\n00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,430\nWe took a look at how we can\nmanipulate some of those things,\n\n352\n00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,860\npotentially rearrange traffic,\nspoof some things, and\n\n353\n00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,790\nmaybe get in there when\nwe're not supposed to.\n\n354\n00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,350\nSo we're gonna take a look at source and\ndestination ip addresses in the header.\n\n355\n00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,630\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n356\n00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,380\nWe basically are working on an access\ncontrol list, as I mentioned,\n\n357\n00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,540\na screen router.\n\n358\n00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,520\nA Screening router basically\nis gonna have ACLs,\n\n359\n00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,980\naccess control lists in it that say\nallow or deny based on this or that.\n\n360\n00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,840\nAnd that's what we're talking about here.\n\n361\n00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,040\nAnd we also can probably map to or\nspecify ports here, right?\n\n362\n00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,670\nSo I may be able to map to a certain\nport and specify a nature or\n\n363\n00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,419\nbehavior of that client with a first\ngen packet filtering firewall.\n\n364\n00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,970\nA layer two firewall, or excuse me\na second gen firewall, not layer two.\n\n365\n00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,660\nI wanna say a layer two but\nsecond gen firewall.\n\n366\n00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,890\nSlip of the tongue there, I apologize.\n\n367\n00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,770\nSo an Application level firewall or\nan Application Layer firewall,\n\n368\n00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,580\nwhich is a Proxy firewall typically,\nis gonna be a second gen right,\n\n369\n00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,290\nor second generation firewall.\n\n370\n00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,970\nSo a Proxy server,\nthis is typically what we would see here.\n\n371\n00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,700\nProxying Firewalls are that.\n\n372\n00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700\nSo if you use proxying devices,\n\n373\n00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,200\nthese are going to be typically\nsecond gen firewall solutions.\n\n374\n00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,990\nThey basically copy packets from networks\nand then you're able to examine them and\n\n375\n00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,100\ntake a look at them.\n\n376\n00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,360\nWe mask the origin of the data,\nso in effect, we're NATing.\n\n377\n00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,190\nIf you want to think about that\nterminology we sometimes use for\n\n378\n00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,670\naddress translation,\nwe're masking the origin of the packet.\n\n379\n00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,320\nAnd we are in effect going out and holding\nthat request sitting somewhere over here,\n\n380\n00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,220\nand sending in on and\n\n381\n00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,140\nbringing the information back\nby masking what the origin is.\n\n382\n00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,270\nSo we don't see the internal\nprivate ip addresses,\n\n383\n00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,575\nwe see the external ip address on the LAN,\nor excuse me, the WAN side of the device.\n\n384\n00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,450\nAnd all the data domes back.\n\n385\n00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,010\n>> Kind of hides our\ninternal infrastructure.\n\n386\n00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,700\n>> Stealths it right.\n\n387\n00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,990\nSo we don't really expose it, right.\n\n388\n00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,130\nSo that's going to be very important for\n\n389\n00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,800\nus to be thinking about and that's\na good point to make actually, right.\n\n390\n00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,730\nBecause we want to make sure that you\nare aware of the fact that these devices\n\n391\n00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,130\nare going to mirror, or\nexcuse me not mirror, but\n\n392\n00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,610\nrather mask the internal origin into the\narchitecture of our network, very true.\n\n393\n00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,960\nSo these will operate at the layer seven\nof the application layer of the OSI model.\n\n394\n00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,280\nThey are usually specific to\nan application functions so\n\n395\n00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,210\nwe may have a Windsock\nproxy a Socks proxy.\n\n396\n00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,540\nThat's where we start to hear\nsome of these terminology items\n\n397\n00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,110\nthat we talk about.\n\n398\n00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,480\nThese sometimes are referred to as\napplication layered gateways by the way as\n\n399\n00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,370\nwell, so a gen two firewall sometimes\nreferred to as an application\n\n400\n00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,270\nlevel gateway or\nan application layer gateway.\n\n401\n00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,930\nBecause it is referring to\nlayer seven of the OSI model.\n\n402\n00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,690\nThey do a lot of things for us,\nand they are really good devices,\n\n403\n00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,730\nbut they are crafted specifically, as we\nsaid, to really approach that specific\n\n404\n00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,430\napplication in the layer\nthat we're operating at.\n\n405\n00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,260\nAnd so, they are unique,\n\n406\n00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,305\nand we tend to see a lot of these\nnon-deployed then deployed.\n\n407\n00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:49,355\nSo you may have as I said,\na Socks one, a Winsock one.\n\n408\n00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:53,315\nYou may have different ones for services\nthat you're running at that layer, and so\n\n409\n00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:57,315\ncould see two three four of these deployed\nin an architectural solution instead of\n\n410\n00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:00,245\njust one that is gonna handle\na lot of different traffic.\n\n411\n00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:02,385\nSo we do wanna just be aware of that, and\n\n412\n00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:04,495\nobviously make sure we're\nthinking about that.\n\n413\n00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,120\nSo then we have third gen, gen three,\nStateful Packet Filtering.\n\n414\n00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,550\nThird generation firewalls\nare going to packet analyze at\n\n415\n00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,270\nall layers of the OSI model so\nthey're gonna work up and down the stack.\n\n416\n00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,630\nThey are capable of looking at and\nexamining data across all layers.\n\n417\n00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,130\nThey typically will be focused on and\n\n418\n00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,780\nqueued up information at\nthe network layer, right?\n\n419\n00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,470\nBut they can work up and down the stack.\n\n420\n00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,345\nWe just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n421\n00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:35,925\nThey are looking at this idea of state and\nstateful creation of session.\n\n422\n00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:41,025\nSo a stateless firewall, the early gen\nfirewalls were stateless, were going\n\n423\n00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:45,740\nto basically take a packet outside of the\ncontext of the connection we were making,\n\n424\n00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,980\nand not really see it as\nbeing part of a longer\n\n425\n00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,540\n>> Conversation.\n\n426\n00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,950\n>> Conversation, but just literally,\nan individual solution.\n\n427\n00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,340\nExamine that packet, but really have no\ncontext around it, no understanding of\n\n428\n00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,870\nstate, no idea of session,\nthe fact that this is one of 20, right?\n\n429\n00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,800\nOr something like that.\n\n430\n00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,577\n>> [CROSSTALK] Or\nspread out across multiple packets,\n\n431\n00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:02,493\nit might not detect that.\n\n432\n00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,850\n>> Would more often\nthan not not detect it.\n\n433\n00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,590\nAbsolutely, correct.\n\n434\n00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,290\nThat was one of the weaknesses of\nthese early firewalls is we could\n\n435\n00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,780\nstream our traffic for our attack vector\n\n436\n00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,435\nin by chopping it up into individual tool\npackets, sprinkling them over the session.\n\n437\n00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:19,635\nYou know, we may be a five second or five\nmillisecond delay, ten millisecond delay.\n\n438\n00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,725\nWe would have tools that would kind of\nspew these things out with a timer.\n\n439\n00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:23,885\n>> Right.\n>> And as a result,\n\n440\n00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:27,445\nwhat would happen is we could stream\nthe traffic in such a way and offset\n\n441\n00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:31,595\nthe fragmentation IDs and recreate them\non the other side that the attack packets\n\n442\n00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:35,520\nwere broken up over here, right, on the\n>> Out in the cloud,\n\n443\n00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,680\nthrough the Internet,\nstreamed in through the device.\n\n444\n00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,050\nThey would not be recognized as\ncontextually being relevant to each other,\n\n445\n00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,240\nand then they would be put back\ntogether on the other side.\n\n446\n00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,530\nWhoops, I'm off the screen there.\n\n447\n00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,960\nPut back together over\nhere on the other side.\n\n448\n00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,690\nThey'll be put back together\nhere on the other side,\n\n449\n00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,910\nthat what would happen is we would then\nliterally be able to push a denial or\n\n450\n00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,730\ndistributed service attack\nthrough the firewall.\n\n451\n00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,120\nAnd the firewall never knew it was being\nattacked because it didn't understand that\n\n452\n00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,290\nthese packets were actually stateful,\nthey were related to the same session.\n\n453\n00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,370\nAnd so stateful firewalls\nreally make this advance,\n\n454\n00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,300\nwhere they say, you know what, pack it\none, pack it three, pack it five, and\n\n455\n00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,830\npack it twenty,\nare all from the same place.\n\n456\n00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,480\nAnd as a result,\n\n457\n00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,800\npart of the same session, we should treat\nthem as being part of the same solution.\n\n458\n00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,850\nAnd so we look at session or conversations\na great way of thinking about that.\n\n459\n00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,110\nWe wanna make sure that we're\nthinking about what the implication\n\n460\n00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,370\nof that conversation is over\nthe entire life cycle of these packets.\n\n461\n00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,690\nThis is what we see with\nstateful inspection.\n\n462\n00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,500\nWe drill in and third gen.\n\n463\n00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,600\nDynamic Packet Filtering and\nwhat's called fourth gen firewalls or 4G,\n\n464\n00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,902\nthey use the common vernacular of\ncellular connectivity and service today.\n\n465\n00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:38,765\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So in a 4G or\n\n466\n00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:42,800\nfourth generation solution we've got\ndynamic packet filtering going on.\n\n467\n00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:47,800\nWe allow modification of the security\nrules there that are on the firewall or\n\n468\n00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,970\nperhaps in real time as the result\nof looking at traffic flows.\n\n469\n00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,220\nWe may be able to then realign\nthe firewall to address\n\n470\n00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,000\na threat that is happening in real time.\n\n471\n00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,520\nSome of these devices as we said when we\nget them linked into an IPS can actually\n\n472\n00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,970\nbe setup in such a way that they are able\nto use very advanced, almost like\n\n473\n00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,140\nartificially intelligent analytic engines\nthat look at data flow in real time.\n\n474\n00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,000\nSee patterns, match it to business\nlogic that either we've created or\n\n475\n00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,770\nis a building block set of rules.\n\n476\n00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,240\nCraft rules that can dynamically change\n\n477\n00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,230\nthe capabilities of these devices to\nallow or block traffic in real time.\n\n478\n00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,850\nSo we see some very interesting\nbehavior here in fourth gen firewalls.\n\n479\n00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,150\nThey're mostly based for UDP solutions.\n\n480\n00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,470\nMeaning Datagram Protocol Solutions,\n\n481\n00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,980\nor Protocol Solutions that are being\npushed that are not going to be\n\n482\n00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,300\nsession based in terms of send and\nwait for acknowledgement the way TCP is.\n\n483\n00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300\nBut rather what we call send and forget.\n\n484\n00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,340\nJust kind of streaming, right, where we\naren't going to worry about the fact that\n\n485\n00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,960\nyou didn't acknowledge\nthe receipt of the packet.\n\n486\n00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,020\nWe're just gonna keep sending.\n\n487\n00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,163\nSo things that are gonna use UDP are\ntypically gonna be the kind of solutions\n\n488\n00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:58,266\nthat makes you going through these\ndynamic packet filtering firewalls.\n\n489\n00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:00,175\nBut keep in mind that as a result of that,\n\n490\n00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:04,300\nwe are going to see that if we\ndrop packets, we may not know that\n\n491\n00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,400\nthe packet session has not been complete\ncause UDP doesn't track that, and so\n\n492\n00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,740\nthere are some issues associated with\narchitecting things the right way.\n\n493\n00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,740\nTo make sure that we're\ngetting the traffic in and\n\n494\n00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,140\nunderstanding what's happening.\n\n495\n00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,960\nSo we just have to understand how to\nplay with those the right way and\n\n496\n00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,030\nmake sure we're setting them up properly.\n\n497\n00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,280\nAnd then in fifth gen fire walls right or\nwhat's sometimes called Next Gen as\n\n498\n00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,215\nwe said what are called\nKernel proxy firewalls.\n\n499\n00:23:26,215 --> 00:23:27,795\nI think we have Kernel Filtering there,\nbut\n\n500\n00:23:27,795 --> 00:23:30,295\nKernel proxy is just what\nwe normally would call it.\n\n501\n00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:35,195\nThese run inside the network stack,\nthe TCP stack that's created\n\n502\n00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:40,015\nis running inside the Kernel of the,\nit's own little bubble.\n\n503\n00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:42,925\nIt's own little isolated Kernel in effect,\nand what happens is,\n\n504\n00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:47,320\nwe create an entire TCP stack and\nthen we recreate that stack.\n\n505\n00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,010\nTear down, recreate it every time\nwe do an analysis on a packet.\n\n506\n00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,415\nUniquely craft it to the kind of\ntraffic we're seeing coming in.\n\n507\n00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:58,435\nSo these are very complex in terms of\nthe logic that goes on inside of them.\n\n508\n00:23:58,435 --> 00:23:59,839\nComplex devices.\n\n509\n00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,362\nWe dynamically create real-time\ntraffic flow monitoring by looking at\n\n510\n00:24:04,362 --> 00:24:06,730\ncreating dynamic stacks here.\n\n511\n00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,460\nAnd we are using these for, basically,\n\n512\n00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,090\ncustomized TCP/IP stack-based\nanalysis of traffic in real time.\n\n513\n00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,490\nSo, these are pretty interesting devices.\n\n514\n00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,850\nThey can enforce security policies\nlinking them to an IPS solution\n\n515\n00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,330\nallows us to dynamically\nreconfigure the network on the fly.\n\n516\n00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,970\nAnd allows us to analyze those\nattacks coming in in real time and\n\n517\n00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,980\nrespond to them.\n\n518\n00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,300\nSo these are pretty interesting devices.\n\n519\n00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,930\nThey run this data that's being analyzed\nthrough this virtual sandbox in effect.\n\n520\n00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,150\nSo all this is taking place\ninside of a virtualized sandbox.\n\n521\n00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,150\nAnd as a result of that we don't\nsee an impact on the actual\n\n522\n00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,360\nsystem that may be hosting this but\nrather it's all isolated in a bubble, so\n\n523\n00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,470\nthat way none of this traffic can get out\nunless we allow it to, at least in theory.\n\n524\n00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,980\nThat's how it's supposed to work,\nmore often than not.\n\n525\n00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,370\nDoesn't always work that way, but\nthat's how it's supposed to work.\n\n526\n00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,380\nSo I just want to keep you aware of\nthat and really be thinking about that.\n\n527\n00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,460\nThese are the generation's firewalls\nthat have existed or do exist today.\n\n528\n00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,930\nYou, as a potential SSCP candidate, or\n\n529\n00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,460\nsomebody that's looking to become\nmore knowledgeable about security as\n\n530\n00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,410\na practitioner, are definitely gonna\nwanna be able to understand these layers,\n\n531\n00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,320\nunderstand these different\ngenerations of these firewalls.\n\n532\n00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,350\nBe able to put them in context, answer\nquestions authoritatively about them,\n\n533\n00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,670\nreal important information for\n\n534\n00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,310\nyou to be aware of as you look to become\na little bit more focused on this area.\n\n535\n00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,900\n>> Really key in deciding what you wanna\ndo and where you wanna put it, cuz you\n\n536\n00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,640\nmight choose different ones, right,\ndepending on what you're trying to do.\n\n537\n00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,710\n>> Absolutely, if you go back to just\nthe thought process of the diagram.\n\n538\n00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,600\nYou may have a different need based\non whether you want to dynamically\n\n539\n00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080\ninterdict traffic in\na virtualized sandbox.\n\n540\n00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,063\nOr just use old school technology\nthat doesn't understand statefulness,\n\n541\n00:25:41,063 --> 00:25:43,354\nbut rather simply interdicts\neach packet individually.\n\n542\n00:25:43,354 --> 00:25:44,875\n>> Certain parts of a network,\nthat's all I need.\n\n543\n00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,578\n>> Right internally,\n\n544\n00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,860\nyou may just need that on your\ntest dev environment for instance.\n\n545\n00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,730\nYou may not want more than that.\n\n546\n00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,410\nSo it's a very good point\nthat you're raising and\n\n547\n00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,040\none that you definitely\nwant to be thinking about.\n\n548\n00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,290\nAll right, so very good.\n\n549\n00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,100\nLet's talk about NIDS and HIDS.\n\n550\n00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,709\nLet's talk about these IDS's.\n\n551\n00:25:56,709 --> 00:26:00,047\nSo up top there right above our\nfirewall types, we have this idea.\n\n552\n00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:03,710\nIn one of our prior episodes,\nwe talked about quickly, at a high level,\n\n553\n00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,554\nthis idea that a network IDS is gonna\ndo real-time traffic analysis for us so\n\n554\n00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:10,798\nwe're gonna be able to see real-time,\nor almost real-time,\n\n555\n00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,644\ntraffic coming in, be able to monitor\nthat through an upload to the device,\n\n556\n00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:18,762\nthrough the device ultimately to an\nreporting point and aggregating that data.\n\n557\n00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:22,910\nSo we wanna make sure we understand that\nthe IDS management console in other words\n\n558\n00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,900\ncan be looking at real time or\nalmost real time data feeds.\n\n559\n00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,156\nWhereas, with a host based IDS,\nwhat we call a HID or\n\n560\n00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:32,860\nas we have there a host based\nintrusion prevention system.\n\n561\n00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,030\nBut let's just focus on\nthe IDS portion for a minute.\n\n562\n00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,696\nWith a HID we're talking about a software\nbased agent that gets installed\n\n563\n00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:40,770\nright in a machine.\n\n564\n00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:45,083\nAnd so that's gonna monitor things like\nthe applications that are running,\n\n565\n00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,230\nservices, the configurations.\n\n566\n00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,470\nBut that's not gonna be\na real time data feed.\n\n567\n00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,550\nThat's gonna be aggregating data,\nlogging it into the agent locally and\n\n568\n00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,110\nthen during preconfigure times we'll\nbe grabbing that data up from the host.\n\n569\n00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,450\nAnd be able to aggregate it up,\n\n570\n00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,250\npull it up into a reporting\nserver somewhere and look at it.\n\n571\n00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,400\nBut it's not feeding back in real\ntime typically, and as a result,\n\n572\n00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,300\nwe don't see that as being\nnecessarily a real time analytic\n\n573\n00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,234\nsolution the way a network\nbased IDS would be.\n\n574\n00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:14,790\nSo having said that, let's talk about\nthe different analysis engine methods and\n\n575\n00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,350\nthe things that we can look at here.\n\n576\n00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:22,040\nIn other words, how do these devices,\nnetwork based or host based IDS's.\n\n577\n00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,187\nHow do they actually work?\n\n578\n00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:26,851\nRight, and so let's focus on the host\nbased solution because that's where\n\n579\n00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:29,654\nwe're gonna try to tend to see or\nwe, more often than not,\n\n580\n00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:33,147\ncome into contact with and see,\nthese kinds of things that are patterned\n\n581\n00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:36,330\nwith what we call signature\nbased on our analysis methods.\n\n582\n00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,870\nSo these pattern or signature based\nsolutions are going to be where we\n\n583\n00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:45,665\ndownload some sort of definition into\nthe machine where the agent is running.\n\n584\n00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:49,290\nUpdating the agent so\nthat it has a new pattern matrix.\n\n585\n00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,020\nAnd then we can look at traffic in\nrelation to that pattern matrix and\n\n586\n00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,810\nunderstand the flows that are coming in.\n\n587\n00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,730\nBut again only if the pattern has\nbeen updated with the traffic\n\n588\n00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,790\nwe're seeing doesn't match.\n\n589\n00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,450\nOtherwise, we may see a bunch of\ntraffic that is it in the buffer?\n\n590\n00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,660\nIs it in the filter?\n\n591\n00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,595\nAnd as a result we may or\nmay not understand what's happening there.\n\n592\n00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:08,910\nSo we have pattern based or\nsignature based mapping, and\n\n593\n00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,600\nwhat we have is we have pattern matching,\nwe just do that based on a pattern.\n\n594\n00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,676\nWe also could do it based\non stateful matching.\n\n595\n00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:20,380\nAnd stateful matching,\npattern matching traditionally is going to\n\n596\n00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,000\nbe what you think of as signatures\nI just mentioned downloading right?\n\n597\n00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,745\nA signature of some kind,\nthat's how you update your virus software,\n\n598\n00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:29,280\nanti-virus software for\ninstance, anti-malware.\n\n599\n00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,160\nIt's all done based on just\na pattern based match.\n\n600\n00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,010\nBut it's done based on the signature\nconcept that we talk about.\n\n601\n00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,110\nBut stateful matching,\na little bit different.\n\n602\n00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,540\nWe improve on that simple pattern\nrecognition of just the signature\n\n603\n00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,390\nby looking at this idea of sequences or\ncross-patterns.\n\n604\n00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,620\nSo this is where we get into this\nidea of the stateful concept,\n\n605\n00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,500\nlike we talked about with the firewall,\nwhere we're able to see\n\n606\n00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,720\ntraffic in relation to traffic around it,\nunderstand a pattern,\n\n607\n00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,520\nand as a result of that,\nmatch that pattern to an attack vector.\n\n608\n00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,980\nBut again, we have to have the updated\nsignature to understand that and\n\n609\n00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,300\nrecognize that or all it is,\nis just a random sequence of data.\n\n610\n00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,060\nWe don't really know\nthere's anything there.\n\n611\n00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,160\nSo these may or may not work for\nus, based on what we're doing and\n\n612\n00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,700\nthe kind of traffic we're seeing.\n\n613\n00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,280\nWe're really only as good as\nthe vendor that does the update for us,\n\n614\n00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,320\nin terms of the active, the active updates\nand the accuracy of those updates.\n\n615\n00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,130\n>> And that's one of the important things\nto look at when you're choosing which\n\n616\n00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,570\nmanufacturer, which vendor to go with is\nhow often do they put those updates out.\n\n617\n00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,200\n>> Absolutely, right, or how often are you\nasked to download them yourself, right?\n\n618\n00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,369\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cut it could be manual,\n\n619\n00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,429\nit could be automatic,\nthere's a combination of ways to go.\n\n620\n00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:36,736\nWe then also have what's called\nanomoly-based, anomoly-based.\n\n621\n00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:40,098\nSo we'll give Mike just a second to\ncapture that thought there about keeping\n\n622\n00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:42,157\nup to date,\nbecause that is an important one.\n\n623\n00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:46,450\nBut anomoly-based detection,\nright, anomoly based engines,\n\n624\n00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,670\nare gonna be ones that go in, and are\nbasically gonna look at expected activity.\n\n625\n00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,070\nSo you could think of this as almost like\ncreating a baseline and then as a result\n\n626\n00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,430\nof that, we look at aberrations,\nthings that are outside the norm of that\n\n627\n00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:02,400\nbaseline, in order to then be able to\nunderstand exactly what's happening.\n\n628\n00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,340\nAnd so, if we think about expected\nbehavior of a web session,\n\n629\n00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,460\na browsing session, as being able\nto set up two or three sessions,\n\n630\n00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,090\nan inbound, an outbound some traffic maybe\ndownload a piece of software, maybe not.\n\n631\n00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,770\nBut certainly not fragment our packets,\nand\n\n632\n00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,830\nthen reassociate them in a way that\nmay show that we have, for instance,\n\n633\n00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,600\na tear drop attack or a smurf attack or a\nfraggle attack that could be taking place,\n\n634\n00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,950\nwhere we have these inbound\nmalformed IP packets.\n\n635\n00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,570\nAnd the headers are malformed\nin some way or another.\n\n636\n00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,359\nAnd as a result, if we look for that\nanomoly now we see hey, you know what,\n\n637\n00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,212\nthe IP headers are malformed here.\n\n638\n00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:41,046\nWe're not supposed to see you know this\nkind of an addressing scheme going on or\n\n639\n00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:44,707\nit's an inbound packet, right, but\nit's coming from the outside but yet\n\n640\n00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:47,295\nit has internal addressing already.\n\n641\n00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:49,305\nClearly something going\non there not right.\n\n642\n00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:53,275\nSo we wanna have that kind of baseline\nset up so the anomoly could be detected.\n\n643\n00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:56,485\nAnd that's what these kinds of\nsolutions will do, so they look for\n\n644\n00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:59,685\nthose aberrations,\nthey can be statistical in nature, so\n\n645\n00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:02,735\nwe could be looking at basically\na baseline of normal traffic.\n\n646\n00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:06,995\nAnd then over time look at the deviation\nfrom norm, that's what statistical would\n\n647\n00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:11,340\nhelp us to do, and if we deviate too\nfar from norm, something may be wrong.\n\n648\n00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,710\nWe could look at traffic just going in and\n\n649\n00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,310\nbasically just looking\nat raw traffic data.\n\n650\n00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,260\nAnd looking at the feed to understand\nwhere there are anomolies and\n\n651\n00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,550\nbasically bumps and spikes.\n\n652\n00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,350\nWe could look at protocol based standards\nas well anomolies based on protocol.\n\n653\n00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,511\nWe mentioned manipulation of TCP headers,\nand\n\n654\n00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,192\nthat would be typically something that\ncould fall under the protocol category.\n\n655\n00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:35,344\nWhere when we now form any headers,\nthat's gonna violate the nature and\n\n656\n00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:38,200\nthe integrity of how the protocol\nis supposed to operate.\n\n657\n00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,810\nAnd that would be something\nto consider here as well.\n\n658\n00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,976\nAnd then the third area that we have for\nanalysis engines would be heuristic.\n\n659\n00:31:44,976 --> 00:31:45,755\nHeuristic.\n\n660\n00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:50,707\nSo we have our pattern-matching concept\nwhere we have pattern signature based.\n\n661\n00:31:50,707 --> 00:31:53,075\nWe then have anomoly based and\nnow we have heuristic.\n\n662\n00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:57,325\nAnd heuristic is basically gonna be this\nidea of being able to effectively create\n\n663\n00:31:57,325 --> 00:32:01,395\nthis virtual sandbox that we mentioned\nthat these next-gen firewalls use.\n\n664\n00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:05,180\nWhere we go in and we put all\nof the unknown traffic right, so\n\n665\n00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,531\nthings like the viruses,\nthe malware, whatever.\n\n666\n00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:13,246\nWe're gonna go in, we're gonna have all\nof the stuff running in a virtualized\n\n667\n00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:15,820\nmemory bubble, a sandbox somewhere.\n\n668\n00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,690\nWe're gonna examine the behavior of this\ncontent, we're gonna turn it upside down,\n\n669\n00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,480\nlook at it, kind of analyze it,\nthe engine will.\n\n670\n00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,990\nIf we see something\nthat looks different or\n\n671\n00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,960\naberrant in any way, we may not allow\nthat outside the bubble to then go on and\n\n672\n00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,250\nultimately interact with\nthe machine directly.\n\n673\n00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,850\nAnd so\nwe can learn from what comes in over time\n\n674\n00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,240\nby building patterns of what\nnormal behavior looks like.\n\n675\n00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,370\nAnd as a result of that, we then can\ndecide what may be outside that.\n\n676\n00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,010\nAnd if it isn't normal,\nit doesn't mean it's abnormal, but\n\n677\n00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,930\nit doesn't mean we should allow it\nthrough until we a deeper analysis on it.\n\n678\n00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:51,050\nAnd so, heuristic scanning can have\na great impact on our ability to\n\n679\n00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,700\ndetect anomalies that may or\n\n680\n00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,900\nmay not be something that a vendor\nalready knows exists, by the way.\n\n681\n00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,780\nRight, because we might find unusual\nbehavior that hasn't been identified yet,\n\n682\n00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,590\nbut our definition of normal allows us to\nsee that maybe it's not belonging here.\n\n683\n00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,670\nSo it's something to think about.\n\n684\n00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,720\n>> When we look at these different\nways of going through each.\n\n685\n00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,150\nOne is getting a little more complex,\n\n686\n00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,220\na little more in-depth\nlook into that packet.\n\n687\n00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,255\nHow is that affecting our performance,\nnetwork-wise?\n\n688\n00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:16,745\n>> So, it's going to affect\nperformance in several ways.\n\n689\n00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,755\nCertainly traffic backing\nup on the network is one.\n\n690\n00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:22,664\nBut also the actual horsepower it takes\nto drive these solutions down locally on\n\n691\n00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:24,078\nthe device itself, right?\n\n692\n00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:26,789\nSo in other words,\nif these are hardware-based devices,\n\n693\n00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:29,188\nwe tend to see the offload\nconcept coming into play.\n\n694\n00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:32,968\nWhere we stack up processing power and\nmemory on these devices so\n\n695\n00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:36,398\nwe can speed up, in effect,\nthrough a force multiplier,\n\n696\n00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,642\ntheir ability to crank\nthrough these patterns.\n\n697\n00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,253\nIf these are gonna run in line\nin maybe a machine of some kind,\n\n698\n00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:45,585\nif they're a virtual machine that's\nrunning a software-based solution,\n\n699\n00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:47,394\nwe wanna make sure we beef up the machine.\n\n700\n00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:51,155\nBecause again, it's gonna crank through\na lot of iterations and we wanna make sure\n\n701\n00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:54,338\nthat we are monitoring and coalescing\nour traffic as a result of that.\n\n702\n00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:57,408\nSo that we really optimize\nthis traffic flow to allow\n\n703\n00:33:57,408 --> 00:33:59,930\nas much traffic in as quickly as possible.\n\n704\n00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,580\nSo there's a great video out there.\n\n705\n00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,350\nI use it with my students a lot\nwhen I teach networking classes,\n\n706\n00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,040\nthings like that.\n\n707\n00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,980\nYou probably, I'm sure you might\nbring it up in some of your classes.\n\n708\n00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,270\nWe actually should have probably\njust thought to put the URL in but\n\n709\n00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,350\nwe'll throw it in the notes for\nyou for later.\n\n710\n00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,370\nBut it's called\nThe Good Warriors of the .NET.\n\n711\n00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,900\nAnd The Good Warriors of the .NET video,\nit's been around forever.\n\n712\n00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,140\nSiemens did this video probably 10 or\n15 years ago.\n\n713\n00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:26,640\nIt's an animated video that walks you\nthrough the OSI model, and just explains\n\n714\n00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,935\nto you how all the different layers of\nthe model work and the network flow works.\n\n715\n00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And maybe we'll throw\n\n716\n00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,220\na reference to it out there\nin that episode as well.\n\n717\n00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,410\nBut we'll definitely go in and\nmake sure we capture the URL for you.\n\n718\n00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,830\nBut the idea there is that we\nwant to make sure that you\n\n719\n00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,795\nlook in a way to see this\ntraffic coming through.\n\n720\n00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:44,312\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And understand in IC cuz you're\n\n721\n00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:46,064\npointing over there to\nus to the chat window.\n\n722\n00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:47,707\n>> We've got a question from\none of our guests there.\n\n723\n00:34:47,707 --> 00:34:51,910\nIt says Mr Nathan Copeland, is the IDS/IPS\ntypically a separate appliance?\n\n724\n00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,850\n>> So, Nathan, that's a great question.\n\n725\n00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:58,290\nSo what Nathan's asking is,\nfrom an architectural standpoint, right?\n\n726\n00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,250\nIs this a device that may be\nseen as a separate physical or\n\n727\n00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,490\nvirtual entity, or is this again,\nsomething that may be integrated?\n\n728\n00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,711\nSo, Nathan, the answer is yes.\n\n729\n00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:06,628\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n730\n00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:07,720\n>> It could be both and so\n\n731\n00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,730\nit really depends on the architecture and\nit depends on the amount of money that\n\n732\n00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,360\nyou're spending to set up your solution,\nright?\n\n733\n00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,990\nBecause if you remember, with just a local\nwork station, we have a firewall, a very\n\n734\n00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,295\nbasic firewall, but a firewall built\nright in to most operating systems today.\n\n735\n00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:25,815\nLinux has had firewall built in\nthrough IP chains and IP tables for\n\n736\n00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:27,405\nyears in one form or another.\n\n737\n00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,819\n>> Windows finally caught on [CROSSTALK]\n>> WIndows finally decided it might be\n\n738\n00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:30,703\na good idea to do that, right?\n\n739\n00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:31,795\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, somewhere along\n\n740\n00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:32,715\nthe way we did that.\n\n741\n00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:36,045\nNow firewalls are not necessarily\nthe same thing as IPSs and IDSs, Nathan,\n\n742\n00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:36,905\nto be clear.\n\n743\n00:35:36,905 --> 00:35:37,767\nBut my point is,\n\n744\n00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:43,522\nwe build this technology in at a very\nbasic level to do packet inspection.\n\n745\n00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:46,820\nAlmost at every device that we see today,\nyour home router,\n\n746\n00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,000\nyour home wireless access solution has\na firewall capability built in and\n\n747\n00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,830\nprobably some very basic filtering,\npacket filtering.\n\n748\n00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,190\nMaybe even application level, layer two or\nlayer three proxy and that kind of thing.\n\n749\n00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,620\nBut when we get into more complicated\ndevices, next gen solutions all the way up\n\n750\n00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,740\nthe stack, Nathan, these are definitely\ngonna be typically separate appliances.\n\n751\n00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,585\nThey may be, remember,\n\n752\n00:36:06,585 --> 00:36:09,460\ncloud-based services that you\ncould be buying from a vendor.\n\n753\n00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,691\nSo you may be consuming them as a SAAS,\na software as a service model,\n\n754\n00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:16,509\nwhere you're buying that service or buying\nthe entire stack in order to do that.\n\n755\n00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:19,039\nBut in more complex topologies,\nwe typically see them as\n\n756\n00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,149\nbeing separate appliances, so\nit's a very good question to ask, and\n\n757\n00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:24,377\none that we want to make\nsure you're focussed on.\n\n758\n00:36:24,377 --> 00:36:25,073\n>> Very good.\n\n759\n00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:26,753\n>> All right, so\ngood that we pointed that out,\n\n760\n00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:28,800\ncuz I wasn't catching that\nout of the corner of my eye.\n\n761\n00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,250\nAll right, so HIDS, then, right, the\nhost-based IDS, I just want to make sure\n\n762\n00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,252\nthat we just remind you again,\nmonitoring of applications, services,\n\n763\n00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:39,788\nthings like that as we put up on there,\nright?\n\n764\n00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:41,846\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They can stop and report information,\n\n765\n00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:44,820\nso in other words, they can see\nwhat's going on, report on it.\n\n766\n00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,910\nBut remember, an IDS generically,\n\n767\n00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,050\nan intrusion detection system,\nis seen as being passive by definition.\n\n768\n00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,207\n>> Right.\n>> So it is gonna record,\n\n769\n00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:56,232\nit's very good at taking pictures, but\nit doesn't do anything other than maybe\n\n770\n00:36:56,232 --> 00:37:00,330\nthrowing an alert as a result of that,\nit doesn't take any intradictive action.\n\n771\n00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,467\nIt does not in any way,\nshape, or form go out and\n\n772\n00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:08,640\nactively pursue a different approach\nto stop that attack or reconfigure.\n\n773\n00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,230\nThat's the nature and the design of the\nIPS, you know, the intrusion protection\n\n774\n00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,940\nsystem, which is again, host-based,\nnetwork-based, we have versions of both.\n\n775\n00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,100\nThose intrusion prevention systems\nare gonna go active as we say, right, and\n\n776\n00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,660\nthey're going to be able to\nactually look at monitoring.\n\n777\n00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,370\nThey do everything an IDS does, but\nthey add in the capability of them being\n\n778\n00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:33,200\nable to go in and reconfigure and or\nin effect, go out and attack on the fly.\n\n779\n00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,380\nWe don't ever recommend you try to mirror\nand turn an attack against an attacker,\n\n780\n00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,950\nto be able to turn it and\nexecute it against them.\n\n781\n00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:43,860\nBut these devices can reconfigure\nnetworks, reconfigure access points,\n\n782\n00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,580\ncut off attack vectors,\nstop inbound traffic flows.\n\n783\n00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,250\nThere's a variety of\nthings that they can do.\n\n784\n00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,370\nThey're very smart, by comparison.\n\n785\n00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,730\nThey form the majority at the heart\nof our layered defense model.\n\n786\n00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,210\nIn terms of our active, management, and\n\n787\n00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,426\nstrike capability against attacks\nthat are coming in in real time.\n\n788\n00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:06,180\nAnd so they are, be clear about this,\nthey are an offensive weapon that\n\n789\n00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,410\nyou deploy in your arsenal to be able\nto not only monitor in real time.\n\n790\n00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,140\nBut to then turn the tables on and\nattack in real time and\n\n791\n00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,520\nstop it if at all possible.\n\n792\n00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,500\nSo, I wanna make sure we have\nthat definitional mindset and\n\n793\n00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,870\nthat difference between the two,\nyou know, just clear in our minds.\n\n794\n00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,863\nRight.\nIt's very important to have that.\n\n795\n00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:25,260\nAs we think about these and\nwe just kind of extrapolate,\n\n796\n00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,310\ndraw out some information to finish\nup this particular episode and\n\n797\n00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,164\nfinish up this conversation\naround firewalls, IDSs, IPSs.\n\n798\n00:38:33,164 --> 00:38:36,768\nWant to talk about what happens behind\nthe scenes with these devices, which is,\n\n799\n00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:39,427\nwhat they represent from\na system hardening perspective.\n\n800\n00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:43,480\nSo, if they are hardware on their own,\nthe vendor will typically have patches,\n\n801\n00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,758\nmaybe firmware updates, things like that.\n\n802\n00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:49,960\nWe all have probably had the experience\nhopefully, where we've had to go in and\n\n803\n00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,970\nmaybe flash the BIOS,\ndo a firmware upgrade on a router,\n\n804\n00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,132\nperhaps something like that,\nmaybe one of these devices.\n\n805\n00:38:56,132 --> 00:39:00,040\nSo that's obviously gonna be pretty\nstandard for most of us, right?\n\n806\n00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,400\nBut there's also gonna be patch management\nthat goes on with these devices.\n\n807\n00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,390\nA lot of them are just gonna have a\ndownload feature where they can update or\n\n808\n00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,820\nbe updated in real time.\n\n809\n00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,100\nBut we also wanna understand that\nthe hardening takes place out beyond\n\n810\n00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,150\nthese devices.\n\n811\n00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,620\nYou have to harden the entire network, and\n\n812\n00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,800\nit's not just the idea\nof hardening the device.\n\n813\n00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,680\nWhat is your profile,\nwhat we call your protection profile.\n\n814\n00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,490\nWhat is your protection profile for\nyour desktops?\n\n815\n00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,820\nWhat is it for your servers?\n\n816\n00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,930\nRight.\nAnd we've talked in prior episodes about\n\n817\n00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,890\npolicy and making sure you're\nimplementing policy, and\n\n818\n00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,800\nfollowing procedure to do patch\nmanagement, things like that.\n\n819\n00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,346\nYou have things that are as standard and\nas kind of straightforward in our minds,\n\n820\n00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:36,320\nsome common sense best practice stuff.\n\n821\n00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,300\nLike, are you eliminating\nall unnecessary services.\n\n822\n00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,280\nIt kills me for instance,\nevery time I set up VM's I wonder why\n\n823\n00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,080\non earth do we have the ability\nto add a sound card to a VM?\n\n824\n00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,240\nWhat are you possibly gonna do on\na virtual machine that requires sound,\n\n825\n00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,120\nI don't get that.\n\n826\n00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,660\nRight?\n\n827\n00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,641\nSo if you're streaming media\ninto a virtual machine and\n\n828\n00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,821\nthen using it to play stuff,\nyou gotta get a hobby, right?\n\n829\n00:39:56,821 --> 00:40:00,252\nAnd it has to be something outside\nthe virtual world that you live in right\n\n830\n00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:00,877\nnow, okay?\n\n831\n00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:03,943\nSo, you know, the reality is that\nsometimes we get this technology, and\n\n832\n00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,679\nby the way there are legitimate reasons.\n\n833\n00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All kidding aside.\n\n834\n00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,810\nThere are legitimate reasons for\nhaving sound drivers in VM's, but\n\n835\n00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,120\nthey have to do with things\nlike VDI solutions, right?\n\n836\n00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,230\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> Desktop management.\n\n837\n00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,230\nThey don't have to do with server\nside virtualization, typically.\n\n838\n00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,550\nSo as result, we give you\nthe opportunity to set up sound drivers,\n\n839\n00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,940\nbut why on earth are we gonna\ncomplicate our life and\n\n840\n00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,280\nput something in there that\nwe're just never gonna use?\n\n841\n00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,900\n>> Yeah and\npotentially add more vulnerabilities.\n\n842\n00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,770\n>> And add more vulnerabilities.\n\n843\n00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,390\nExactly.\nSo as a result of that, we want to strip\n\n844\n00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,720\naway all that nonsense and this is really\nwhat we talk about with best practices.\n\n845\n00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,920\nSo think about that.\n\n846\n00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,080\nUnallowed and unneeded services,\npeer-to-peer messaging,\n\n847\n00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,870\nall that kind of stuff, get rid of it.\n\n848\n00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,850\nIt used to be back in the day\nyou would install Windows OS and\n\n849\n00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:49,100\ninstall some of the applications on it\nsuch as Office and things like that.\n\n850\n00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,750\nAnd you will get\nWindows Instant Messaging,\n\n851\n00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,620\nand then you'd be sitting\nthere saying to yourself,\n\n852\n00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,220\nwhy on earth and the enterprise\nam I running this kind of stuff?\n\n853\n00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,775\nWhy do I need AOL,\nwhy do I need Yahoo Messenger?\n\n854\n00:40:57,775 --> 00:40:59,715\nSo you know,\njust think about how you do that.\n\n855\n00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:01,275\nThat is going to be important.\n\n856\n00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,455\nSo getting rid of those\nunnecessary services,\n\n857\n00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:06,115\nreally important as a thought process.\n\n858\n00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:08,315\nUse dedicated hosting wherever possible.\n\n859\n00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:10,705\nIt would talk about this\nidea of virtual machines.\n\n860\n00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:14,515\nOr hardware based devices that\nare dedicated to doing this to an offload.\n\n861\n00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:16,575\nThat's really going to be\ncritical to securing and\n\n862\n00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:19,265\nsetting up a hardened infrastructure.\n\n863\n00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:21,115\nAnd making sure your patch\nmanagement is up to date.\n\n864\n00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:26,270\nCan't say that enough I hate to hear\nfrom my students and my clients.\n\n865\n00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,430\nThat they had a problem because they\nweren't keeping up to date with a patch.\n\n866\n00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,900\nThey got nailed with some\nsort of zero day exploit.\n\n867\n00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,640\nSomething that came out, there was a patch\nfor it, they didn't know about it.\n\n868\n00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,240\nAnd you know, somehow or someway rather,\nthat issue, that vulnerability found\n\n869\n00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,380\nits way into their network before they\nwere able to deal with it in real time.\n\n870\n00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,900\n>> It is a shame,\n\n871\n00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,310\nwhen there was something they could\nhave done about it a lot easier.\n\n872\n00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,191\n>> Absolutely.\n\n873\n00:41:48,191 --> 00:41:48,842\n>> [CROSSTALK] After the fact.\n\n874\n00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:52,120\n>> You know, instead of playing golf on\nFriday, go out and manage your servers.\n\n875\n00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,160\nWhatever you guys do.\n\n876\n00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,870\nAll right, so then we've wasted enough of\nyour time, right, talking about all this\n\n877\n00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,770\nstuff, I think that finds us at the end\nof another perfectly good episode,\n\n878\n00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,240\nas they say, right.\n\n879\n00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,330\nSo we're gonna wrap up here, and\nwhat we're gonna do is come back and\n\n880\n00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:08,410\nhave another episode to wrap up this\nentire topic on monitoring and analysis.\n\n881\n00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,690\nWe're gonna get into some of the,\njust leftover areas we want to cover.\n\n882\n00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,640\nWanna talk to you a little bit about\nsome of the vocabulary associated with\n\n883\n00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,620\nmonitoring and analysis, talk about\npen testing, penetration testing.\n\n884\n00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,130\nWe had that episode you and I did a little\nwhile back where we talked about grey box,\n\n885\n00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,040\nwhite box, black box.\n\n886\n00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,910\nWe're gonna recount that and\nmake sure we're good with that.\n\n887\n00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,695\nWalk through the logical ideas and the\nsteps behind how a pen test takes place.\n\n888\n00:42:29,695 --> 00:42:32,562\nSo, some exciting stuff to come back and\nsee in our next episode.\n\n889\n00:42:32,562 --> 00:42:33,513\nAll right.\n\n890\n00:42:33,513 --> 00:42:43,345\n[SOUND]\n>> All right welcome back everybody.\n\n891\n00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:48,030\nSo we got done talking about our ITS's and\nIPS's and firewalls and\n\n892\n00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:52,520\nI think we're going to head on over to\nthe world of penetration testing next.\n\n893\n00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,630\n>> World of penetration not quite\nlike Wayne's World, but close enough.\n\n894\n00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,290\n>> Close, close.\n\n895\n00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,580\nWe'll talk about that absolutely.\n\n896\n00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,410\nSo what we want to do is just really spend\na few minutes talking with you about\n\n897\n00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,210\nthe idea of bringing together some of the\nthemes we've been talking about in these\n\n898\n00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:08,110\nother episodes around monitoring and\nanalysis.\n\n899\n00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:12,210\nWe're going to get some themes defined for\nyou in terms of vocabulary,\n\n900\n00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:15,050\ntalk a lot as Mike said,\nabout pen testing.\n\n901\n00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,820\nLay out some of the structure\naround what a pen test looks like.\n\n902\n00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,600\nWe're also going to just show you\nsome examples of things, some tools.\n\n903\n00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,190\nAnd map, for instance,\nwe'll throw that back up.\n\n904\n00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,960\nWe've looked at some prior episodes.\n\n905\n00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,940\nWe'll take you out quickly and\nshow you what's going on with who is and\n\n906\n00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,760\nmake sure you know how to use that\nkind of information that's out there.\n\n907\n00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,470\nThen we'll just try to\npaint a pretty picture for\n\n908\n00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,085\nyou about how we kind of\nbring all this stuff home.\n\n909\n00:43:36,085 --> 00:43:38,125\nSo let's start talking about\nmonitoring and testing,\n\n910\n00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,875\nwhen we talk about something like WHOis.\n\n911\n00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:43,125\nI know we were taking a look just\na few minutes ago on the web,\n\n912\n00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:44,675\nand we went to WHOis.net.\n\n913\n00:43:44,675 --> 00:43:49,030\nYou could see the IP address, or\nexcuse me, the URL up there for you and\n\n914\n00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:53,380\nthe idea behind WHOis is this\nidea of being able to go in and\n\n915\n00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,980\ntake a look at DNS name\nregistration information.\n\n916\n00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,410\nAnd so, we want to be able to\nmake sure we can go out and\n\n917\n00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,330\nfind out who owns a name space.\n\n918\n00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:03,640\nBut also what the IP addresses are for\nthe DNS servers,\n\n919\n00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,220\nwho's authoritative, if there is\na question as to who owns that name space,\n\n920\n00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,240\nwant to be able to register that or\ntake a look at it.\n\n921\n00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,350\nSo maybe we could do a quick search for\na name.\n\n922\n00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,080\nLet's do something.\n\n923\n00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,320\nAre we gonna, no let's not do that one.\n\n924\n00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:23,260\nLet's do cnn.com and\nsee what's going on there.\n\n925\n00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,390\nSo let's do a WHOis lookup on that.\n\n926\n00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,210\nAnd what we're gonna see is cnn.com\nis already registered, that's fine.\n\n927\n00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,710\nWe could put a bid in to buy it from CNN,\n\n928\n00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,820\nbut they're probably not\ngonna sell it to us I think.\n\n929\n00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,340\n>> Probably not.\n>> So\n\n930\n00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,870\nthat's probably not gonna get us too far.\n\n931\n00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:38,620\nBut what I did wanna show you, and what\nMike's zooming in on which is important,\n\n932\n00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:42,360\nis we queried through who is,\nthrough Verisign in this case, right?\n\n933\n00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,620\nWe got redirected out up the stack, but\nyou'll see domain name cnn.com is there.\n\n934\n00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,240\nRegistry ID, that's nice.\n\n935\n00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,760\nWho is the authoritative server of record,\n\n936\n00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,390\nwho is is where it's registered\nURL registration update date.\n\n937\n00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,650\nAnd then if we work our way down,\nwe will see as we go all the way down and\n\n938\n00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,340\njust keep going, we should be able to\nfind all the registration information.\n\n939\n00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,940\nSo kind of stop right there and\ngo back up.\n\n940\n00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,580\nPerfect.\n\n941\n00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,248\nSo what we see is we see some\ninformation about the organization.\n\n942\n00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:12,950\nYou see the Tech Name there, TBS Server\nOperations, for Turner Broadcasting right?\n\n943\n00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,013\nProbably based in Atlanta.\n\n944\n00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:16,156\nSure enough, we look one CNN Center.\n\n945\n00:45:16,156 --> 00:45:19,510\nLovely tour, by the way,\nif you've never taken that opportunity.\n\n946\n00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,690\nThat out in the Coca Cola tour,\n\n947\n00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,850\nif you ever find yourself in Atlanta\nwith nothing to do for a day.\n\n948\n00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,620\nAwesome way to spend the day, really,\nreally cool tours by the way.\n\n949\n00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,670\nSo, we go to Atlanta, we see that, but\n\n950\n00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,840\nwhat information is valuable here to\nus and why do we want to know this?\n\n951\n00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,300\nIf I'm a hacker and I'm looking to, you\nknow, be on the outside trying to get into\n\n952\n00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,620\nthis organization,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n953\n00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,190\n>> I may wanna know a little\nbit about the company.\n\n954\n00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,370\n>> Right.\n>> Where they're located,\n\n955\n00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,955\nI may then wanna go scout them out.\n\n956\n00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:43,230\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Maybe go out and look for\n\n957\n00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,140\npeople that work for them.\n\n958\n00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,910\n>> Right.\n>> Do some social engineering.\n\n959\n00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,280\nWe talked about some of these things.\n\n960\n00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,140\nThe prior episodes.\n\n961\n00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,760\nWe'll talk about some more of them as\nwe go through some other areas of our\n\n962\n00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,590\ndiscussion.\n\n963\n00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,600\nBut that kind of stuff's\nhelpful because it gives us\n\n964\n00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,830\nthe ability to zero in on a target.\n\n965\n00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,640\nBut down below that,\nwhere we have the name servers listed,\n\n966\n00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,500\nwe can see four of them there,\nns1.timewarner.net.\n\n967\n00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,800\nDidn't use to see that until a few years\nago and they went out and got acquired.\n\n968\n00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,640\nBut now we have ns1,\np42 whatever it is, ns2, et cetera.\n\n969\n00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,470\nSo these are our four DNS names\nservers that are authoriated from\n\n970\n00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,500\nthe cnn.com Namespace.\n\n971\n00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,200\nWhat we could do with this and\nagain, this is kind of old school.\n\n972\n00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,840\nHacking 101 that we're bringing into\nthe discussion here for you, right.\n\n973\n00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,450\nBut we could go in and\nwe could go an NSlookup.\n\n974\n00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:31,330\nWe could do an NSlookup using the built in\nDNS management tools found on any machine,\n\n975\n00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,420\nanywhere in the world, right.\n\n976\n00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,930\nAnd if we do an NSlookup and we know how\nto structure the NSlookup by going and\n\n977\n00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,620\nattaching to this name server and telling\nit we're authoritative for the Namespace.\n\n978\n00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,160\nAnd if they have not\nsecured their domains,\n\n979\n00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,620\nthen we could do a DNS\ntransfer of the domain space.\n\n980\n00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,740\nAll of a sudden we can dump the entire\ncontents of that DNS Namespace.\n\n981\n00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,910\nAnd we now have every registration\nrecord for every machine on the inside.\n\n982\n00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,240\nAnd at that point it's party time, right?\n\n983\n00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,340\nWe go home and we start hacking away at\nmachines and doing all sorts of stuff.\n\n984\n00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,620\n>> It's one of those things that\nsome IT people don't realize\n\n985\n00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,000\nthe importance of protecting that data.\n\n986\n00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,900\nIt's a map to the entire network, right.\n\n987\n00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,830\n>> It is.\n>> Every machine and\n\n988\n00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,610\nIP address,\nwhich machine is running which services.\n\n989\n00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,320\nIf I'm going to get into your network,\nI want to hit your domain controllers,\n\n990\n00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,770\nI want to hit your DNS servers,\nyour mail servers.\n\n991\n00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,150\nI can find them now.\n\n992\n00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,520\n>> Absolutely correct, and you know so\n\n993\n00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,918\na lot of companies have gotten smart\nabout this in the last several years.\n\n994\n00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:27,300\nBut as P.T. Barnum said and\nstill good today, as many times\n\n995\n00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,450\nas it's been said over the years,\nthere's a sucker born every minute, right.\n\n996\n00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:30,990\n>> Right.\n>> And if you wait\n\n997\n00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,740\nlong enough yours will come along.\n\n998\n00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,650\nSo if we do this, and I do this in my\nhacking classes all the time time, and\n\n999\n00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,650\nI do this live for customers all the time.\n\n1000\n00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> When they sit down and say hey,\n\n1001\n00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,690\nwe're having these issues,\nwhat's going on?\n\n1002\n00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,260\nRemember, we're talking about pen testing,\nor\n\n1003\n00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,910\nat least we're gonna get\ninto pen testing here.\n\n1004\n00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,800\nThis is one of the things\na pen tester will do.\n\n1005\n00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,480\nThey will go dump your DNS registrations.\n\n1006\n00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,830\nThey will hit every one\nof those four servers and\n\n1007\n00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,740\ntry to dump the name registrations.\n\n1008\n00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,695\n>> Yeah.\n>> And if we find one of the four that's\n\n1009\n00:47:55,695 --> 00:47:59,120\nnot locked down, you get a big red\nX on that part of the pen test.\n\n1010\n00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,887\nAnd the audit.\n\n1011\n00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:03,428\nAnd we planted the proverbial flag\non top of your network there.\n\n1012\n00:48:03,428 --> 00:48:07,876\nAnd so I will sit in my office, or\nI'll sit and work for clients, and\n\n1013\n00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:08,900\nI will do this.\n\n1014\n00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,700\nAnd one of the very first\nthings we look at is how secure\n\n1015\n00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,890\nare you on the outside\nbefore we even get in.\n\n1016\n00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,740\nBecause if I can find out what's\non the inside from the outside.\n\n1017\n00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,420\nIn no time, I'm going to be in\nthe inside poking around and\n\n1018\n00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,235\nowning your networks right?\n\n1019\n00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:22,628\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So you don't want me or\n\n1020\n00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:24,048\nthe evil version of me.\n\n1021\n00:48:24,048 --> 00:48:26,180\nThis is the nice me, right?\n\n1022\n00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,675\nI'm smiling.\n\n1023\n00:48:27,675 --> 00:48:28,245\nI'm happy.\n\n1024\n00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:29,035\nI've had my coffee.\n\n1025\n00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:30,595\n>> You should see him at night.\n\n1026\n00:48:30,595 --> 00:48:31,165\n>> Right.\nExactly.\n\n1027\n00:48:31,165 --> 00:48:32,685\nYou don't want to see me after midnight.\n\n1028\n00:48:32,685 --> 00:48:37,095\nBut you know, if you find the evil me\nrunning around out there in the world wide\n\n1029\n00:48:37,095 --> 00:48:37,985\nweb somewhere, right?\n\n1030\n00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:39,342\nMake sure you say hi.\n\n1031\n00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:44,122\nBut if you find the evil me out there, I'm\ngonna be the guy or the girl as a hacker\n\n1032\n00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:47,882\nwho's gonna come along and is not gonna\nbe nice about what we find, right?\n\n1033\n00:48:47,882 --> 00:48:51,012\nAnd let me just lay it out there for\nyou, the pen tester\n\n1034\n00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:55,170\nwho does this ethically is the person that\nwill come and tell the company they'd been\n\n1035\n00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,310\nhired to do a pentest for,\nwhat the issues are and remediate them.\n\n1036\n00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:03,090\nThe pentester that's not ethical, is gonna\ndo this without being paid by a company or\n\n1037\n00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,150\nretained by them.\n\n1038\n00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,460\nAnd then is gonna go in and\ntry to steal that information.\n\n1039\n00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,390\nOr generate business by coming and saying\nhey, by the way, we did this proactively\n\n1040\n00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:13,000\nfor you, now hire me and\nI'll tell you where the problems are.\n\n1041\n00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,222\nNo, that's not gonna be acting\nethically right, so shame on you.\n\n1042\n00:49:16,222 --> 00:49:18,437\n>> It doesn't work all that often does it?\n\n1043\n00:49:18,437 --> 00:49:22,410\nI mean usually you find yourself-\n>> You would be surprised, and\n\n1044\n00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:25,810\nas much as I hate to say,\nyou would think better of it.\n\n1045\n00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:29,140\nYou'd think that people just get it today,\nand they understand it.\n\n1046\n00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:35,260\nThe reality is as [LAUGH] as much as just\nI hate to say Barnum was right again,\n\n1047\n00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,500\nbut you know there are suckers\nout there all the time.\n\n1048\n00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,580\nIt never ceases to amaze me how often I\nfind people that are under prepared and\n\n1049\n00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,090\novercached.\n\n1050\n00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,240\nYou have too much money to spend and\nnot enough knowledge.\n\n1051\n00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,730\n>> Here's this guy that broke into my\nnetwork and is handing me my own data, and\n\n1052\n00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:50,640\nnow I'm going to pay him.\n\n1053\n00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,470\n>> And I'm going to pay him because\nwho better to safeguard the hens.\n\n1054\n00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:55,070\n>> He must be trustworthy.\n>> Then\n\n1055\n00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,720\nthe fox who broke into the henhouse and\nnow has the key.\n\n1056\n00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,040\nSo it doesn't happen that often anymore.\n\n1057\n00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,610\nMichael's point is well taken,\nbut it does happen.\n\n1058\n00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:05,600\nBut more importantly than that,\nwhat we really have to get at is, not so\n\n1059\n00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,190\nmuch the unethical pen tester,\nbut the unethical hacker.\n\n1060\n00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,700\nThe hacker who's gonna take this\ninformation and not try to sell it back\n\n1061\n00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,780\nto you, but just come and take away your\ntoys and go play with them somewhere else.\n\n1062\n00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,110\nSo you really wanna be\nthinking about these things.\n\n1063\n00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:24,470\nIf you outsource DNS, the way for\ninstance CNN is, any major-\n\n1064\n00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:25,390\n>> Most of them do, yeah.\n\n1065\n00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,010\n>> Right, I was gonna say,\nany major business does today.\n\n1066\n00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,090\nDo the due diligence, right?\n\n1067\n00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:35,190\nIf you are the security practitioner, if\nyou are the SSCP managing network services\n\n1068\n00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:40,080\nfor this company, have you gone to your\nhosting company, who ever that is.\n\n1069\n00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,070\nAnd have you said to them hey,\n\n1070\n00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:44,000\ndo you allow zone transfers\nto unauthorized servers?\n\n1071\n00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,360\nI seem to have information here that\n\n1072\n00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,630\ncontradicts the fact that\nyou're telling me you don't.\n\n1073\n00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:52,280\nOr I've tested randomly and\nyou don't and I'm glad to hear that.\n\n1074\n00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,960\nBut hypothetically,\nif it was to happen what would change?\n\n1075\n00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,100\nAnd how do we know that, right?\n\n1076\n00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,180\nAnd you gotta work with those vendors\nto understand what they're doing.\n\n1077\n00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,920\nThe minute you give anyone else\nthe ability to manage your\n\n1078\n00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,310\ninformation for you.\n\n1079\n00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,170\nYou got to be twice as vigilant,\n\n1080\n00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:10,360\ntwice as focused on being up\nin their business as they say.\n\n1081\n00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,450\nTo making sure you\nunderstand what's happening,\n\n1082\n00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:13,950\nas you do when you manage it yourself.\n\n1083\n00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,130\nSo understand that.\n\n1084\n00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,640\nWe wanted to share that with you,\nmake sure you got a chance to see that.\n\n1085\n00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,310\nA little old school knowledge mixed\nwith some new school opportunity to\n\n1086\n00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,890\nbe successful and\nget certified here, along the way.\n\n1087\n00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:26,060\nSo, I know, speaking of that,\nthat we talked about who is.\n\n1088\n00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,990\nBut we also wanted to do\na quick look at Nmap again.\n\n1089\n00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,600\nWe'd done some prior episodes.\n\n1090\n00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,900\nCan we zoom in just a little bit?\n\n1091\n00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,378\nCuz my eyes are good, but\nthey're not that good.\n\n1092\n00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:34,271\nRight?\n\n1093\n00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,120\n>> Let's see if I can get this bad boy.\n\n1094\n00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,628\n>> Okay.\n\n1095\n00:51:36,628 --> 00:51:38,010\nThere we go.\nNow we just got to organize it.\n\n1096\n00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:38,945\nThere we go.\nVery good.\n\n1097\n00:51:38,945 --> 00:51:42,198\nWhat we did is Mike and I just ran\nan Nmap scan on the network we've\n\n1098\n00:51:42,198 --> 00:51:45,892\nbeen working on here as we're providing\nyou with all this information.\n\n1099\n00:51:45,892 --> 00:51:48,025\nAnd we thought it would be good just\nto show you some of the results.\n\n1100\n00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:51,784\nIn one of our prior episodes I did\nwalk through this with Don and\n\n1101\n00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:53,600\nwe took a look at some of this.\n\n1102\n00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,470\nAnd I just want to more remind you\nthan anything else what we see here\n\n1103\n00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:57,360\non this particular machine,\n\n1104\n00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,920\nthe first one is that we seem to\nhave a TCP port open there, right?\n\n1105\n00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,232\nSo it looks like 3260.\n\n1106\n00:52:03,232 --> 00:52:06,050\nAnd Nmap's saying,\nmaybe it's a nice SCSI solution.\n\n1107\n00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,110\nDon't know for sure, but\nit very well might be.\n\n1108\n00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:11,197\nA nice SCSI map out to an NFS server or\nsomething like that.\n\n1109\n00:52:11,197 --> 00:52:13,472\nI don't know.\nIt could be a NAS device we're looking at\n\n1110\n00:52:13,472 --> 00:52:17,680\nthat's running Linux and maybe\nrunning an iSCSI solution for storage.\n\n1111\n00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,390\nWe do seem to see a MAC address there that\nindicates the company's data robotics so\n\n1112\n00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:25,310\nI'm thinking this may be a device as\noppose to an operating system that\n\n1113\n00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,170\nwe're looking at.\n\n1114\n00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,070\nIt's running Linux, but\n\n1115\n00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:30,430\nit's probably a hardwired storage device,\nis what I mean to say.\n\n1116\n00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,780\nWe have a Linux kernel there.\n\n1117\n00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,856\nIt's a generic 2.6 kernel.\n\n1118\n00:52:32,856 --> 00:52:36,670\nSo we don't normally know what that is,\nbut we see it's embedded.\n\n1119\n00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,960\nSo again, we're probably looking at\na device as opposed to an actual machine.\n\n1120\n00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,018\nIt's been up for\nnine days approximately, right?\n\n1121\n00:52:42,018 --> 00:52:45,716\nAnd we're seeing a little\nbit information there.\n\n1122\n00:52:45,716 --> 00:52:48,905\nWe see a hop count, it's obviously\nlocal on our network, right?\n\n1123\n00:52:48,905 --> 00:52:52,300\n>> Right.\n>> And we're able to get to it.\n\n1124\n00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,310\nAnd if we then move down\nto the next machine down,\n\n1125\n00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,450\nwe see a Windows machine there.\n\n1126\n00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:00,040\nI think this may have been\nthe one that we looked at in our\n\n1127\n00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,170\nlast go around on this as well.\n\n1128\n00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:05,060\nIf we just, give us a second just\nto zoom back in and move it up, so\n\n1129\n00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,940\nwe can actually see it as we zoom in.\n\n1130\n00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,990\nThere we go.\n\n1131\n00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:10,390\nAnd so we had some open ports up top,\nand that's fine.\n\n1132\n00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,130\nWhat we see is we see\nWindows ports running.\n\n1133\n00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:16,350\nSo we know this is most likely\na Microsoft based machine.\n\n1134\n00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,770\nWe see a MAC address that has\nDell in brackets next to it,\n\n1135\n00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:23,070\ntelling us that it's most likely\na Dell server of some type, right?\n\n1136\n00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:27,920\nWe then see an OS guess on Windows 7,\nmost likely Vista, something like that, so\n\n1137\n00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,110\nwe know it's probably a workstation,\nnot a server.\n\n1138\n00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,350\nBeen up for about 15 days.\n\n1139\n00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:36,080\nSo we know this machine may have been\nrestarted due to patching recently.\n\n1140\n00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,350\nWe see this in the BIOS information there.\n\n1141\n00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,090\nKeep in mind we're on\nthe inside of the network, so\n\n1142\n00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,790\nwe're getting that BIOS information.\n\n1143\n00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,960\nObviously, if we were across\na routered interface,\n\n1144\n00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,965\nwe wouldn't be seeing\nthat BIOS information.\n\n1145\n00:53:45,965 --> 00:53:48,780\nBut just keep that aware or\nkeep that in our mind.\n\n1146\n00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:52,460\nWe're actually seeing some information\nthat indicates through SMD-OS discovery\n\n1147\n00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,370\nthat this is actually a Windows 8 machine,\nas opposed to a Windows 7 machine.\n\n1148\n00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,680\nDelving down the next layer inside the\nnetwork gives us a different take on this\n\n1149\n00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,240\nthan it does just looking at\nthe Nmap guess from outside.\n\n1150\n00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,090\nIf we were just able to knock\nat that BIOS information.\n\n1151\n00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,620\nAnd that could be the difference between\nsuccess or failure when we're coming and\n\n1152\n00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,410\ntrying to do a pen test.\n\n1153\n00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,323\n>> Cuz you got different vulnerabilities\nfor the different OSs, so-.\n\n1154\n00:54:12,323 --> 00:54:13,703\n>> Absolutely correct.\n>> Which one you're targeting.\n\n1155\n00:54:13,703 --> 00:54:16,193\n>> And different tools that may work,\nnot just that but\n\n1156\n00:54:16,193 --> 00:54:18,633\ndifferent tools that may\nnot work against that OS.\n\n1157\n00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:20,667\nBecause Windows 8 has a very\ndifferent security profile,\n\n1158\n00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,850\nas you were pointing out based\non vulnerabilities, right?\n\n1159\n00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:25,790\nOr at least that's what Microsoft tells\nus they want us to believe, anyway.\n\n1160\n00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,982\n>> It's the most secure\noperating system ever.\n\n1161\n00:54:27,982 --> 00:54:29,990\n>> Absolutely.\nDOS is still lurking in there somewhere\n\n1162\n00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,690\nthough, so\nwe can still get in there and do stuff.\n\n1163\n00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:32,910\nWe just gotta know how to do that.\n\n1164\n00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,630\nBut we do see all of this.\n\n1165\n00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,800\nWe see the work group in there,\n\n1166\n00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,730\nwe see the name,\nobviously you can tell if you're looking.\n\n1167\n00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:42,090\nStudio 01, that's one of the machines\nthat we're using here in the studio.\n\n1168\n00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:43,480\nSo you can just be aware of that.\n\n1169\n00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,830\nBut we do see that we have\nthe ability to drill in here.\n\n1170\n00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:50,405\nAnd so the idea is something like Nmap,\nwe're able to see a lot of information.\n\n1171\n00:54:50,405 --> 00:54:53,720\nNow again, Nmap, out beyond the routed\ninterface on the outside of the network\n\n1172\n00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,800\ncoming in, different information\nthan inside the network.\n\n1173\n00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,800\nWe're going to talk in a little awhile\nabout the different types of pen tests\n\n1174\n00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,630\nthat can occur.\n\n1175\n00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,930\nYou have different categories or\ngrades we can engage in.\n\n1176\n00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:07,222\nAnd so, this information would really\nbe something we get from a white hat or\n\n1177\n00:55:07,222 --> 00:55:08,002\na white box test.\n\n1178\n00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:12,580\nAs opposed to a black or a grey box test,\nwhere we're outside the network.\n\n1179\n00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,190\nWe'll recap those and\ntalk more about those.\n\n1180\n00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,680\nBut network mapping, very important.\n\n1181\n00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,980\nNmap does network mapping,\nForest does the ports and the typography.\n\n1182\n00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,220\nDoes also allow us to do the OS mapping,\nas you can see.\n\n1183\n00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,360\nWe see the typology there.\n\n1184\n00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,380\nMaybe we can blow up a little\nbubble map there and\n\n1185\n00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,860\njust take a look at oh there we go.\n\n1186\n00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,530\nWow, hope you don't have vertigo.\n\n1187\n00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,180\nYou probably fell out of your chair\nwhen Mike just zoomed in there.\n\n1188\n00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,790\nLook at that individual\npixel how cool that is.\n\n1189\n00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:40,510\nSo what we can see here is this is\nnot the best way to present this.\n\n1190\n00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,800\n>> Lets see if I can do it again.\n\n1191\n00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,405\n>> So you get generically the idea that we\ndo have, I think you have host view and\n\n1192\n00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:46,439\nyou have FireEye over there.\n\n1193\n00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:50,344\nProbably, yeah,\nFireEye spreads it out a little bit.\n\n1194\n00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:53,957\nSo you can see we have from the central\ncore that we're emanating from Mike's\n\n1195\n00:55:53,957 --> 00:55:56,079\nlaptop, which is what\nhe did the scan off of.\n\n1196\n00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,439\nYou could see we're radiating out and\nfinding some devices.\n\n1197\n00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:02,860\nSo this lays out the map for us,\nit lets us then validate where things are.\n\n1198\n00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,950\nWe can obviously then extrapolate\nthis out, get some more information.\n\n1199\n00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,276\nYou see we scan about 15 hosts and\napproximately and\n\n1200\n00:56:08,276 --> 00:56:10,714\ndevices [CROSSTALK] Right,\nwe got firewall over there.\n\n1201\n00:56:10,714 --> 00:56:13,668\nMaybe we should use this for our diagram\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] for the IDSIPS right?\n\n1202\n00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:16,809\nSo we have all that stuff and\nwe can obviously then go and\n\n1203\n00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:21,526\nexecute individual queries against these\nmachines is one option so Nmap's a very\n\n1204\n00:56:21,526 --> 00:56:25,405\npowerful tool we can use this as\nthe Windows port of Nmap by the way.\n\n1205\n00:56:25,405 --> 00:56:27,260\nNmap started out as a Linux based tool.\n\n1206\n00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,870\n>> Right.\n>> We're using the Windows port of it.\n\n1207\n00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,120\nWhich is Zenmap, the Zenmap GUI.\n\n1208\n00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,535\nWhich is the Windows\nport of Nmap these days.\n\n1209\n00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:38,535\nBut we could be using tools like\nUltra Port Scanner, WhatsUp Gold, right?\n\n1210\n00:56:38,535 --> 00:56:41,695\nWe could use,\nSolar Winds has a lot of tools out there.\n\n1211\n00:56:41,695 --> 00:56:43,545\n>> Foundstone has a couple.\n\n1212\n00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:46,115\n>> Foundstone's owned I think by Dell now,\neverybody's got boughten up ultimately.\n\n1213\n00:56:46,115 --> 00:56:48,655\nBut back in the day, right,\ntalk about old school stuff.\n\n1214\n00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,135\nSo Foundstone used to be that set of tools\n\n1215\n00:56:51,135 --> 00:56:52,880\nthat everybody had in their toolbox,\nright?\n\n1216\n00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,100\nSo you definitely could go out and\ndo those things, you know.\n\n1217\n00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:59,020\nAnd Microsoft has bought several\nsecurity companies over the years.\n\n1218\n00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,140\nOne of the ones they acquired\nwhich is specific to Windows\n\n1219\n00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:02,830\n>> Sysinternals.\n\n1220\n00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,560\n>> Sysinternals, right.\n\n1221\n00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,800\nThe Win32.\nNow it's called Winternals.\n\n1222\n00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,190\nBut the Sysinternals toolset that they\nbought had a phenomenal amount of tools.\n\n1223\n00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,140\nERD, the emergency repair disk commander,\nright?\n\n1224\n00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,500\nThe ERD commander is now no longer\noffered specifically anymore but\n\n1225\n00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,080\nthe technology's built in to\nyour tablet on Windows 8.\n\n1226\n00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,520\nAll that stuff, it's all there.\n\n1227\n00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,120\nBut a lot of those tools like what's\nrunning, so Process Explorer, and\n\n1228\n00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,690\nall those things are all tools that\ncan be used to really drill in, right?\n\n1229\n00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:29,455\n>> So Nathan's saying that must\nbe the Drobo down there, right?\n\n1230\n00:57:29,455 --> 00:57:30,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nathan,\n\n1231\n00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,970\nwe can't release that information.\n\n1232\n00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:35,360\nWe're not allowed to say that in public,\nbut it could be something like that.\n\n1233\n00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,610\nLet's put it that way.\n\n1234\n00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:39,260\nSo the idea is that security\nthrough obscurity, right?\n\n1235\n00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,940\nWe wanna make sure we\ndon't tell you too much.\n\n1236\n00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,710\nBut we do wanna go out, we do wanna\nunderstand the tools like this.\n\n1237\n00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,300\nAnd map, and tools of this nature.\n\n1238\n00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,340\nKismet, and Cain and Abel on the wireless\nside for instance, wireless scanners.\n\n1239\n00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,080\nI'm running wireless on my laptop here.\n\n1240\n00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,645\nNext Another good one.\n\n1241\n00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:58,255\nRight, Firesheep, which is the one that's\nmade all the rage last couple of years.\n\n1242\n00:57:58,255 --> 00:58:01,535\nIf you're working in a coffee shop and\nsomeone's trying to pick up your signals,\n\n1243\n00:58:01,535 --> 00:58:04,255\nright, they're gonna run that for\nyou or against you, rather.\n\n1244\n00:58:04,255 --> 00:58:07,110\nSo, you know,\nwe run all these different tools.\n\n1245\n00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,950\nThe idea here for the pen tester is,\n\n1246\n00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:12,090\ncome up with the list of tools in your\ntoolkit that are going to make sense for\n\n1247\n00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,440\nthe kind of environments you're\ngoing to be going up against.\n\n1248\n00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,590\nYou can see clearly,\na tool like Nmap straddles the fence and\n\n1249\n00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:21,920\nworks effectively inside the wire, but\nalso has some effect outside the wire.\n\n1250\n00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,170\nBut there are tools that are gonna\nbe specific to being internal and\n\n1251\n00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,740\ntools that are specific to being external\nand some that straddle both worlds\n\n1252\n00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:32,320\nwhere tools on the Linux platform\nwhere tools on the Windows platform.\n\n1253\n00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,070\nSome of the really hardcore badass tools\nare found on the Linux platform because\n\n1254\n00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,360\nthe reality is\nthe restrictions we have and\n\n1255\n00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,210\nthe Windows security kernel are not\ngoing to be in there in Linux.\n\n1256\n00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,140\nSo.\n>> Us Windows people,\n\n1257\n00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,291\nwe just end up dealing with the leftovers\nor whatever eventually gets ported over.\n\n1258\n00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:47,160\n[LAUGH]\n>> Whatever those Linux developers take\n\n1259\n00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:47,860\npity on us.\n\n1260\n00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,600\n>> Yeah,\nwe'll let the Windows guys use them.\n\n1261\n00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,700\n>> Keep the really good ones for us.\n\n1262\n00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,830\nSo, you know, what I'm waiting for is the\nsecurity build to Windows that boots off\n\n1263\n00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,660\nthe the flop off of the floppy disk.\n\n1264\n00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:01,720\nIt boots off the DVD or the USB stick\nthe way we have for Knoppix, right?\n\n1265\n00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,130\nOr or any of those distributions,\n\n1266\n00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,990\nbecause you know Secure a Linux,\nyou can go in and you can\n\n1267\n00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:12,390\nbuild your own toolkit as Mike is trying\nto kind of type stuff in there [LAUGH].\n\n1268\n00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,700\nYou can bully your way through\nbuilding your own toolkit.\n\n1269\n00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,780\nSo you could build your own toolkit,\nand you can use things like Knoppix or\n\n1270\n00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,800\nSecure Linux,\nit's another distro that's out there.\n\n1271\n00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,570\nAnd you can literally put these\nthings on to a USB stick,\n\n1272\n00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:27,260\npop them into a Windows machine, which is\nwhat I love because I do these demos live.\n\n1273\n00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,600\nAnd you can go ahead, and you can actually\nbring the Windows machine up, mount\n\n1274\n00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,825\nthe hard drive, take all the data off the\nWindows machine return it to its normal\n\n1275\n00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:37,995\nstate by restarting it and the Windows\nperson doesn't know you're even there.\n\n1276\n00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:38,495\n>> Never know.\n\n1277\n00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:42,285\n>> So if you give me physical\nproximity access to your data centers,\n\n1278\n00:59:42,285 --> 00:59:44,655\nI'm gonna take your data away\nfrom you in about ten minutes.\n\n1279\n00:59:44,655 --> 00:59:46,625\n>> That is one of my\nfavorite immutable laws.\n\n1280\n00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:47,610\nIs that if I can touch.\n\n1281\n00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:48,340\nIt's your computer.\n\n1282\n00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,150\n>> It belongs to me.\n\n1283\n00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,140\n>> It's no longer your computer.\n\n1284\n00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,750\n>> You ever see that commercial,\n\n1285\n00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:56,530\nI think VW has it.where they're talking\nabout you know come in and buy the cars.\n\n1286\n00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,920\nEverybody's walking around I want\nthis car and everybody wants it.\n\n1287\n00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,830\nSo the one guy comes over and\nlicks the door handle.\n\n1288\n01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,440\nIt's mine right?\n\n1289\n01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,980\nNobody else wants it at that point.\n\n1290\n01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,360\nIf I could get to your machines, right?\n\n1291\n01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,450\nLiterally, you're done.\n\n1292\n01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,120\nYou might as well just pack up and\ngo home.\n\n1293\n01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,020\nIt's just gonna get ugly, and\nit's gonna get ugly really quickly.\n\n1294\n01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,450\nAnd people don't get that, right?\n\n1295\n01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:18,060\nThey put the servers in the wiring\ncloset out among In the hallway,\n\n1296\n01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,620\nnext to the bathroom,big sign on the door\nthat says please come hack me here,\n\n1297\n01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,510\nbecause it's this wiring closet.\n\n1298\n01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:24,190\n>> No cameras.\n\n1299\n01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:27,080\n>> No, nothing and\nthey got the pop up ceiling tiles,\n\n1300\n01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,840\ngot the ladder in the maintenance\ncloset next door.\n\n1301\n01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,460\nAnd you know I get amazed all the time at\nwhat I find and when I do audits and I\n\n1302\n01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,470\ntalk to people and I see their networks or\neven better you know you see the file and\n\n1303\n01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:42,210\nprint server sitting under some\nbodies desk in a small office and\n\n1304\n01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:43,160\nyou ask what is that.\n\n1305\n01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,420\nOh you know it's our file server.\n\n1306\n01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,220\nReally!\n\n1307\n01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:50,440\nCan I just have a bow\nwe'll put that you know\n\n1308\n01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,450\ntake it right out to the car wrap\nit up and I'll walk away with it.\n\n1309\n01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,780\nSo the idea is that pen testing\nmay be something that's so\n\n1310\n01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:00,270\nsimple literally, as coming back to the\noffice at night after everybody's gone,\n\n1311\n01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:04,310\nunhooking that server, taking the hard\ndrive out, and walking out the door.\n\n1312\n01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,660\nI don't even have to bother\nwith loading up a tool.\n\n1313\n01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,960\n>> Right.\n>> I'm just loading up the truck right?\n\n1314\n01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,740\nInstead of loading up a tool.\n\n1315\n01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,540\n>> Exactly.\nIt may not be me by the way.\n\n1316\n01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,600\nIt may be your cleaning company.\n\n1317\n01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,140\n>> Yep.\n>> Because I'm in contract with them\n\n1318\n01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:19,390\nto become a member of that cleaning crew,\nand after a couple of days on the job of\n\n1319\n01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,730\ntaking out garbage and reading your\nemails, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n1320\n01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,240\njust take your stuff, and\nI'm gonna walk outdoor.\n\n1321\n01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,910\nYou're never gonna see me again.\n\n1322\n01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,450\nSo if you're not safeguarding\nthe people that are coming into your\n\n1323\n01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:32,330\nenvironments at night by\ndoing background checks.\n\n1324\n01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,050\nWho knows what you got\ngoing on in the network.\n\n1325\n01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:35,840\nI love when I drive by banks at night.\n\n1326\n01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,510\nTwo, three, four in the morning right?\n\n1327\n01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:40,000\nWhy I'm out at two, three, four in\nthe morning is really not important for\n\n1328\n01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,080\nthis conversation.\n\n1329\n01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,260\nBut the fact that I am, and\njust that I happen to drive by a bank or\n\n1330\n01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,840\nsomewhere, and you see typically\nthe blinds are open wide.\n\n1331\n01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,650\nYou see people moving around\nin there depending on\n\n1332\n01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:49,810\nthe time of the night that you go by.\n\n1333\n01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:50,840\nThey are the cleaning crew right?\n\n1334\n01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,630\nThey are in there cleaning up and\ndoing all sorts of stuff.\n\n1335\n01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,790\nYou know, I often stop and\nI wonder to myself, you know banks, right?\n\n1336\n01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,070\nYou got all the security clearly\nprobably not gonna steal much.\n\n1337\n01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,760\nThe money's locked up,\nwhat you're gonna get?\n\n1338\n01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,580\nBut the point, they have video cameras,\nthey have all this stuff around, but\n\n1339\n01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,670\nhow hard would it be to become\na member of that cleaning crew?\n\n1340\n01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:06,440\n>> Right.\n\n1341\n01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,040\n>> It's not very hard.\n\n1342\n01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,580\nIf you really wanna go,\nyou can walk and talk, and\n\n1343\n01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:13,420\nyou wanna take out garbage, you probably\ncan get a job doing this kind of stuff.\n\n1344\n01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:14,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n1345\n01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,220\nthis is typically how a lot of\nsocial engineering happens?\n\n1346\n01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,310\nThis is one of the things.\n\n1347\n01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,570\nThe pen testers are famous for\ndoing, right?\n\n1348\n01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:22,850\nIs going through and\ngathering all that information, right?\n\n1349\n01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:25,330\nWhat do you leave on your desk and\nis all that stuff put away?\n\n1350\n01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:30,230\nDo you have the passwords written down and\nstuck up under the keyboard?\n\n1351\n01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,630\nAll the great stuff we often hear about,\nall these urban myth and\n\n1352\n01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,390\nlegend that happen to be true, right.\n\n1353\n01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,590\n>> People really do think, you know,\nonce they throw it in the garbage,\n\n1354\n01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,830\nthat it's gone and\nnobody can get that information.\n\n1355\n01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,830\nSticky notes, the bane of security.\n\n1356\n01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:41,510\n>> Oh absolutely.\n\n1357\n01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:45,200\n>> I mean, they write things down on there\nand make a note of it because they're busy\n\n1358\n01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,910\ndoing something else and then they finally\nget around to putting that information in\n\n1359\n01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:51,330\nand they just throw that sticky\nnote away in the garbage.\n\n1360\n01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, don't think about\n\n1361\n01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,120\ntaking it to the shredder or anything.\n\n1362\n01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,440\n>> You might as well\nthrow the computer away.\n\n1363\n01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,770\nIt's a lot easier for everybody [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1364\n01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,250\n>> Cause we love finding computers in\n\n1365\n01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:58,750\nthe trash.\n\n1366\n01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,280\nWe get excited when we find them.\n\n1367\n01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,040\n>> Right?\nSo it's a present for the hacker.\n\n1368\n01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,750\nYou get a new computer, it's a present for\nyou and everybody's happy, right?\n\n1369\n01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,080\nInstead of useless sticky notes,\nit's a lot easier that way, right?\n\n1370\n01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,690\nMake it easier for everybody.\n\n1371\n01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,650\nAll right, so security testing,\nwe talked about the ideas behind this.\n\n1372\n01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,530\nWe'll get to pen testing\nformally in a minute.\n\n1373\n01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,620\nLet's talk about what the goals of\nsecurity testing are, right, this idea of\n\n1374\n01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,110\nbeing able to identify vulnerabilities and\njust understanding what they are.\n\n1375\n01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:24,000\nWe'll come down on the five phases\nof pen testing there in a minute.\n\n1376\n01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,220\nBut identifying vulnerabilities is one of\nthe key things we're talking about here\n\n1377\n01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,000\nwith the goals of security testing.\n\n1378\n01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,320\nWhy do we do all this stuff?\n\n1379\n01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,970\nWell we wanna know where\nthe vulnerabilities\n\n1380\n01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,570\nare as we've been saying all along.\n\n1381\n01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:37,489\nWe wanna make sure we understand that as\na result of that we can prioritize our\n\n1382\n01:03:37,489 --> 01:03:38,601\nresponses, right?\n\n1383\n01:03:38,601 --> 01:03:41,315\nSo we can go in and say,\nyou know this zero day exploit,\n\n1384\n01:03:41,315 --> 01:03:44,678\nwe gotta get on this thing,\nwe gotta figure out how to stop using this\n\n1385\n01:03:44,678 --> 01:03:47,689\nparticular software until we patch it or\nwhatever it may be.\n\n1386\n01:03:47,689 --> 01:03:49,883\nSo prioritizing responses\ncomes out of that.\n\n1387\n01:03:49,883 --> 01:03:52,147\nWe obviously can prepare for audits.\n\n1388\n01:03:52,147 --> 01:03:55,050\nWe can find gaps in our\nsecurity by doing this.\n\n1389\n01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:59,600\nWe can get to the bottom really quickly\nof what a false positive versus\n\n1390\n01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,130\na false negative may be.\n\n1391\n01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,900\nNothing worse than having the boss\nbreathing over your shoulder going,\n\n1392\n01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,280\nwhy can't I get email?\n\n1393\n01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,510\nWhy am I no longer authorized\nas a user in my own network?\n\n1394\n01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,390\nWell, boss, according to the tool,\nI don't care what the tool says, right,\n\n1395\n01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:12,450\nI am an authorized user.\n\n1396\n01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,270\nNo, you're not, boss, that's why\nyou're not getting email, right?\n\n1397\n01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:18,046\nSo we wanna make sure false positives,\nfalse negatives get sorted out, but\n\n1398\n01:04:18,046 --> 01:04:22,058\naside from the obvious, we know, and we\ntalked about this in the episode early on\n\n1399\n01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:25,952\nwhere we talked about biometrics and\nfalse positives, false negatives, and\n\n1400\n01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:29,669\ncrossover error rates, it's always better,\n[LAUGH] at the end of the day,\n\n1401\n01:04:29,669 --> 01:04:32,690\nto keep the bad people out than\nto allow the good people in.\n\n1402\n01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:34,350\nWe had to make a choice, right?\n\n1403\n01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:38,340\nI'd rather run the risk of alienating\nsome users that do belong in the network\n\n1404\n01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,390\nby not allowing them in than\nallowing in the strangers.\n\n1405\n01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:45,066\nWe don't want false accepts,\nif anything we want false rejects.\n\n1406\n01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:47,360\nSo false accepts,\n\n1407\n01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,873\nletting people in that don't belong there\ncan be very troubling, to say the least.\n\n1408\n01:04:50,873 --> 01:04:52,828\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just be aware of that.\n\n1409\n01:04:52,828 --> 01:04:56,320\nWe talked about picking the correct tools,\nbuilding your toolkit,\n\n1410\n01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,880\nwent through a list of six or\nseven different tools you can use.\n\n1411\n01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,780\nThere literally are hundreds out there.\n\n1412\n01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,740\nAnd you'll have to go out and\ndo a little due diligence and\n\n1413\n01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,120\nresearch to figure out the ones\nthat might make sense for you.\n\n1414\n01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,440\nBut don't be afraid to try them.\n\n1415\n01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,040\nWith the advent of virtualization\nover the last several years,\n\n1416\n01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:13,580\nthe ability to run virtual machines,\nforget about booting directly off media.\n\n1417\n01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,400\nBut the advent of virtual machines,\nit's so\n\n1418\n01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,560\neasy today to set up an environment\nwhere you can test these tools\n\n1419\n01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,280\nwith no liability and\ntear it down when you're done.\n\n1420\n01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,760\nRecreate it, build that perfect world,\nif you will.\n\n1421\n01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,680\nAnd then just have it there and\njust fire it up.\n\n1422\n01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,630\nWhen I do these kind of tests,\nI do the pentesting and the auditing and\n\n1423\n01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:32,670\nstuff, I do them from\nvirtual environments.\n\n1424\n01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:35,930\nI run them on a physical machine,\nbut I virtualize them so\n\n1425\n01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:39,080\nthat way I can make them per client,\nfirst of all.\n\n1426\n01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,850\nI can document everything I do.\n\n1427\n01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:44,790\nBut if I have a problem,\nif I hit a land mine that goes off,\n\n1428\n01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:47,910\nI don't have to worry about blowing\nup a machine while on site.\n\n1429\n01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:51,280\nI just take a snapshot image of\nthat VM and I just reconstitute it.\n\n1430\n01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,780\nI roll back and I'm ready to go.\n\n1431\n01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:56,810\nRight, or I may even set up several ghost\nmachines that are attacking and doing\n\n1432\n01:05:56,810 --> 01:06:00,700\ndifferent probing in different areas of\nthe network at the same time so I can run\n\n1433\n01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,720\nfive or six different scans simultaneously\nfrom different vantage points.\n\n1434\n01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,650\n>> Nice.\n>> So it really helps you to be able to\n\n1435\n01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:07,222\ndo these things.\n\n1436\n01:06:07,222 --> 01:06:11,172\nYou wanna think about that and obviously\nbe thinking about the value of that.\n\n1437\n01:06:11,172 --> 01:06:14,870\nSo obviously, thinking through those\nthings, hopefully helpful for you there.\n\n1438\n01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:18,392\nSo we talked about network mapping\na little bit, doing recon, going out, I\n\n1439\n01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:21,970\ntalked to you about the social engineering\naspects of something like whois,\n\n1440\n01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,040\npublic information.\n\n1441\n01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,990\nJust go out to LinkedIn and\ndo a search, right?\n\n1442\n01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:27,860\nSee who works at that company.\n\n1443\n01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,710\n>> It's amazing what employees\nwill share with the world.\n\n1444\n01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:33,333\n>> Well, that's a whole Facebook\nconversation, that's separate,\n\n1445\n01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:34,017\nbut absolutely.\n\n1446\n01:06:34,017 --> 01:06:36,180\nWhat's out there-\n>> I knew you were a big Facebook fan.\n\n1447\n01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,545\n>> I am not a big Facebook fan.\n\n1448\n01:06:37,545 --> 01:06:39,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely the opposite, actually.\n\n1449\n01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,210\nI'm the antithesis.\n\n1450\n01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:42,210\nI'm the anti-Facebook guy.\n\n1451\n01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:43,980\nI don't use those systems, personally.\n\n1452\n01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,579\nI do use LinkedIn, by the way and I'm\nhappy if any of you are listening live or\n\n1453\n01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:50,461\nperhaps not listening live,\nbut listening after the fact.\n\n1454\n01:06:50,461 --> 01:06:53,175\nIf you find me on LinkedIn,\nI'll be masquerading as Mike for\n\n1455\n01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,303\nthe next several weeks.\n\n1456\n01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:58,172\nSo feel free to connect to me and Mike and\nI will be happy to talk with you.\n\n1457\n01:06:58,172 --> 01:07:00,180\nBut all kidding aside,\nI am out on LinkedIn,\n\n1458\n01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,680\nit's one of the few sites\npublicly that I do subscribe to.\n\n1459\n01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,570\nI am involved with because\nof the work I do and\n\n1460\n01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,620\nthe nature of the groups that I'm involved\nwith, so I do spend time there publicly.\n\n1461\n01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:12,210\nAnd I'm happy to see any of you come\nout and try to connect with me,\n\n1462\n01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:16,170\nand say hey, could you connect with me and\nlet me become part of your circle?\n\n1463\n01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,670\nI would love to do that for anybody\nthat's watching the shows, by the way.\n\n1464\n01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,960\nNo problem at all and\nplease feel free to do that.\n\n1465\n01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,550\nBut having said that,\nthe other sites that I'm on or not on,\n\n1466\n01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:27,840\nfor the most part,\nI get asked all the time, do you Twitter?\n\n1467\n01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,810\nAre you on Facebook?\n\n1468\n01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,080\nDo you do Foursquare?\n\n1469\n01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:30,630\nDo you do this?\n\n1470\n01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:31,630\nDo you do that?\n\n1471\n01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,850\nAbsolutely not, right.\n\n1472\n01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:35,043\nAnd not because I don't\nthink they're valuable, but\n\n1473\n01:07:35,043 --> 01:07:38,342\nbecause they're not designed, number one,\nfor me as a business professional.\n\n1474\n01:07:38,342 --> 01:07:40,502\nLinkedIn, whether you like it or not, is.\n\n1475\n01:07:40,502 --> 01:07:44,400\nBut more importantly I don't need to give\nout that kind of information about myself.\n\n1476\n01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,067\nYou don't need to know where I am at\n2 in the morning, what I'm doing, and\n\n1477\n01:07:48,067 --> 01:07:48,840\nwho I'm with.\n\n1478\n01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,610\nAnd you don't need to know who's in\nthe picture standing next to me.\n\n1479\n01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:55,948\nThose just are not things from a security\nstandpoint that are good for you to share.\n\n1480\n01:07:55,948 --> 01:08:00,378\nAnd especially, we're not gonna get into\nthe whole conversation about safety and\n\n1481\n01:08:00,378 --> 01:08:04,551\nonline and that kind of stuff, other\nthan to say, today, as professionals,\n\n1482\n01:08:04,551 --> 01:08:06,280\nwe're not young kids anymore.\n\n1483\n01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,880\nAt least, I'm not a young kid anymore.\n\n1484\n01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,495\nI had a lot more hair when I was,\nand it wasn't all gray.\n\n1485\n01:08:11,495 --> 01:08:14,199\nBut I'm not certainly\nin my twenties anymore.\n\n1486\n01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:15,465\nI have children, right?\n\n1487\n01:08:15,465 --> 01:08:16,850\nI'm a parent.\n\n1488\n01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,780\nAnd you have to think about the fact that\nwhatever information you make publicly\n\n1489\n01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:24,670\navailable is information that\nstays out there about you, but\n\n1490\n01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:27,110\nalso gets linked to other\nareas of your life.\n\n1491\n01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:30,840\nAnd you know, as a professional,\nI'm fine with sharing that I do security.\n\n1492\n01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,130\nI'm fine with sharing I'm\na Microsoft certified professional,\n\n1493\n01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,060\nwhatever, whatever.\n\n1494\n01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:37,240\nBut that other stuff,\ntotally separate bucket.\n\n1495\n01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:40,540\nSo we really gotta think about\nthe profiles we create generically because\n\n1496\n01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:44,330\nsocial engineering happens because we put\ntoo much information out there, right?\n\n1497\n01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:48,002\nSo be thinking about that next time you're\non Facebook thinking about whether or\n\n1498\n01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:51,728\nnot you wanna put that post up there about\nthis cool new hacking thing you're doing\n\n1499\n01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:52,870\nor something like that.\n\n1500\n01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,414\nYou know, employers look at this stuff.\n\n1501\n01:08:54,414 --> 01:08:58,152\nAnd I hire and I vet a lot of people and\nhave professionally for\n\n1502\n01:08:58,152 --> 01:09:02,473\nmany years in my roles in the\norganizations that I am associated with,\n\n1503\n01:09:02,473 --> 01:09:06,860\nand I get asked a lot to interview\npeople for vetting and hiring.\n\n1504\n01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:10,110\nAnd one of the first things we will do\nis go out and run a check on you and\n\n1505\n01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:13,650\nfind out, not just a background check,\nbut we look at the social media sites.\n\n1506\n01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,060\nDo you have a LinkedIn profile?\n\n1507\n01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,140\nAre you on Facebook?\n\n1508\n01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,930\nWhat did you say you've been doing and\n\n1509\n01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:21,120\nwhat kind of professional versus\nnon-professional behavior do we see there?\n\n1510\n01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,530\nJust like we probe and map out a network,\nwe probe and map out individuals.\n\n1511\n01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:26,530\nAnd this is one of the ways\nwe get into networks.\n\n1512\n01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:29,010\nWe find your weaknesses and\nfigure out what they are.\n\n1513\n01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:30,955\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1514\n01:09:30,955 --> 01:09:33,720\nSo when we talk about these kinds\nof things, we also wanna look at\n\n1515\n01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,870\nwhat we discover, what services\nare running, our VPNs out there.\n\n1516\n01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:39,220\nAnd they're not as prevalent\nas they used to be.\n\n1517\n01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,352\nWe're really getting into\nthe modern age today,\n\n1518\n01:09:41,352 --> 01:09:44,560\nthis is almost like stone age technology,\nthe old school stuff with VPNs.\n\n1519\n01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,760\nBut they're still prevalent,\nwe still use them, and\n\n1520\n01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,200\ncertainly in certain parts of the world,\nthey're still very actively used.\n\n1521\n01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:54,290\nBut we do have a lot of VPN-less remote\naccess technologies today, where we don't\n\n1522\n01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:57,850\nneed them but we effectively get\nthe same kind of protection.\n\n1523\n01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:00,878\nHTTPS, RPC over HTTPS, for instance.\n\n1524\n01:10:00,878 --> 01:10:04,585\nSo tunneling, non-routable traffic\ninside a tunnel would allow us to be\n\n1525\n01:10:04,585 --> 01:10:06,454\nable to do certain things like that.\n\n1526\n01:10:06,454 --> 01:10:10,569\nAnd we'll talk some more about some of\nthose things in our network episodes,\n\n1527\n01:10:10,569 --> 01:10:15,200\nour network and technology episodes, but\nVPNs are a good source of information.\n\n1528\n01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,230\nIf we can find out you\nhave VPNs out there,\n\n1529\n01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:19,680\nwe know you have remote\nusers as a pen tester.\n\n1530\n01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,540\nWe want to then target those remote users,\nfind out who they are,\n\n1531\n01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:25,490\npotentially get in, so\nwe're gonna look for those kind of things.\n\n1532\n01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:29,240\nWe'll be doing scans to find out\nwhether or not those are there.\n\n1533\n01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,040\nWe can typically break those VPNs\nif we get the log-on credentials.\n\n1534\n01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,530\nSo we wanna make sure we're\nthinking about that as well.\n\n1535\n01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:39,163\nHow secure are those remote access points,\nin other words,\n\n1536\n01:10:39,163 --> 01:10:41,650\nis effectively what we're\nasking you to consider here.\n\n1537\n01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,800\nWe also wanna think about war dialing and\nwar driving.\n\n1538\n01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,070\nLet's get in the wireless side for\njust a minute.\n\n1539\n01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:48,308\nI wanna define these terms for you.\n\n1540\n01:10:48,308 --> 01:10:54,130\nI wanna define these terms for you.\n\n1541\n01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:56,053\nThese are also penetration\ntesting techniques.\n\n1542\n01:10:56,053 --> 01:11:00,754\nSo war dialing is this idea that,\nold school, again.\n\n1543\n01:11:00,754 --> 01:11:03,904\nThis is going back to the day where we\nused modems, and I can't remember the last\n\n1544\n01:11:03,904 --> 01:11:06,410\ntime somebody said to me, oh,\nlook there's a modem, right?\n\n1545\n01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,090\n>> I think you mentioned\nin our other segment-\n\n1546\n01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,030\n>> Mentioned WarGames, right?\n\n1547\n01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,820\nDidn't we talk about\nMatthew Broderick in WarGames?\n\n1548\n01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:12,150\nSo this is right out of WarGames.\n\n1549\n01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:16,290\nThe movie basically just about\nstarts out where you see\n\n1550\n01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:20,340\nhim in the bedroom with the old Hayes\n9600 baud modem, big suction cups, right.\n\n1551\n01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,440\nSo each one was probably,\n\n1552\n01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,940\nif you could see, the size of\none of these things right here.\n\n1553\n01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:28,133\nSo each of the baud areas you connect on,\nyou had the phone that plugged on.\n\n1554\n01:11:28,133 --> 01:11:31,041\nAnd by the way, the phone was\na rotary dial phone, right, so\n\n1555\n01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,135\njust be aware of that.\n\n1556\n01:11:32,135 --> 01:11:35,498\nBut you know, you have those phones,\nand we wold plug it into the modem and\n\n1557\n01:11:35,498 --> 01:11:37,234\nthen the modem would go out and dial and\n\n1558\n01:11:37,234 --> 01:11:40,724\nyou'd be giving it a list of telephone\nnumbers and it would go through them.\n\n1559\n01:11:40,724 --> 01:11:44,784\nWhat war dialing did was it basically\nwalked through pinging, in effect,\n\n1560\n01:11:44,784 --> 01:11:47,050\nbut pinging on the phone each interface.\n\n1561\n01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:48,560\nAnd if we got a hit,\nif we got a dial tone,\n\n1562\n01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,990\nright, we would then mark that number and\ncome back to it.\n\n1563\n01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:53,380\nAnd then we would try to connect and\nsee if we could hack our way in.\n\n1564\n01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:56,190\nAnd that's what he does,\nthat's how he gets into what he thinks is\n\n1565\n01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:59,270\nthe gaming company,\nwhich turns out to be the Pentagon.\n\n1566\n01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:01,631\nWhich leads you to a whole\nother source of angst and\n\n1567\n01:12:01,631 --> 01:12:05,325\nconversations about why they're\nmasquerading as a gaming gaming company.\n\n1568\n01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:08,360\nBut the idea there was\nthat he was war dialing.\n\n1569\n01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,570\nLooking to hack into phone\nsystems was war dialing.\n\n1570\n01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:15,350\nWar driving is this idea of taking that\nto the next level in the modern world.\n\n1571\n01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,970\nWhere we look for\nopen wireless access points.\n\n1572\n01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:20,192\nAnd so this happens in\nneighborhoods all the time.\n\n1573\n01:12:20,192 --> 01:12:24,680\nYou probably borrow wireless\nfrom your neighbor every so\n\n1574\n01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,460\noften and then they'd borrow it from you.\n\n1575\n01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,260\nBack in the day in college we used\nto borrow cable from each other.\n\n1576\n01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,610\nYou'd go out and\nfind out whoever was paying for cable.\n\n1577\n01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:33,200\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah, in the apartment complex.\n\n1578\n01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,535\nYou'd have 25 splitters\ncoming off that thing.\n\n1579\n01:12:35,535 --> 01:12:39,385\nEach of you got a was good enough\nto see something late at night.\n\n1580\n01:12:39,385 --> 01:12:40,675\nSo, yeah, same kind of thing.\n\n1581\n01:12:40,675 --> 01:12:44,435\nI've broken a few or fractured a few\nlaws in my day, I suppose you could say.\n\n1582\n01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:48,417\nBut the idea here is that war driving was\nsimply looking, and is, going out and\n\n1583\n01:12:48,417 --> 01:12:51,477\nlooking with a wireless antenna for\nopen wireless access points.\n\n1584\n01:12:51,477 --> 01:12:54,117\nAnd this is one of the things again,\nwe will do in pen testing.\n\n1585\n01:12:54,117 --> 01:12:57,677\nWe will not war drive through the hallways\nin the sense of driving the car.\n\n1586\n01:12:57,677 --> 01:12:59,947\nBut we'll walk around with\na wireless scanner looking for\n\n1587\n01:12:59,947 --> 01:13:01,650\nopen wireless access points.\n\n1588\n01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:03,800\nAre they broadcasting the SSIDs?\n\n1589\n01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,790\nDo they have some sort of security\nprotocol associated with them?\n\n1590\n01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,010\nWhether it is WPA, WPA v2.\n\n1591\n01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:11,311\nHeaven help us,\nshould I even say WEP [LAUGH]\n\n1592\n01:13:11,311 --> 01:13:11,812\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1593\n01:13:11,812 --> 01:13:12,758\n>> But what's on there-\n\n1594\n01:13:12,758 --> 01:13:13,704\n>> You'd be surprised.\n\n1595\n01:13:13,704 --> 01:13:16,930\n>> Depending on when it was set up and\nwho may or may not know it's running.\n\n1596\n01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So those kind of things,\n\n1597\n01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:20,790\nwe will then do enumeration of\nthem to figure out what's there.\n\n1598\n01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:22,940\nSo you wanna make sure you're\naware of that as well.\n\n1599\n01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,320\nSo, pen testing obviously very important.\n\n1600\n01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,980\nLet's go through the five phases here.\n\n1601\n01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:31,655\nWe have documented them and we'll talk\nabout penetration test types as well.\n\n1602\n01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:34,170\nLet's talk about penetration testing.\n\n1603\n01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:37,340\nObviously, things like attack\nsimulation is what we're talking here.\n\n1604\n01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:38,600\nSo I'm gonna scan right?\n\n1605\n01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,400\n>> Right.\n>> Figure out how we're gonna attack and\n\n1606\n01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,560\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n1607\n01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,110\nWe typically do this,\nmore often than not, a response to or\n\n1608\n01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:47,570\nin conjunction with an audit, although\nthis can be done separate from the audit.\n\n1609\n01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:50,100\nAnd we're gonna do this to\ndiscover vulnerabilities but\n\n1610\n01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,010\nthen also address them and\nthen go back, remediate them and\n\n1611\n01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:55,860\nthen test again to see whether or\nnot the patch is actually holding.\n\n1612\n01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:58,840\nSo these are considered\nto be the five phases\n\n1613\n01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,280\nof pen testing that you're looking at.\n\n1614\n01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,590\nThought we would just detail them out for\nyou.\n\n1615\n01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:07,160\nDiscovery here is where we're gonna\ndo things like we just showed you.\n\n1616\n01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,270\nGoing through the whois database for\ninstance right?\n\n1617\n01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,810\nCould be a discovery item here.\n\n1618\n01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:14,050\nWhere we do some social engineering,\nwe do some recon.\n\n1619\n01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:17,190\nWe probe around a little bit,\nfind out what's out there.\n\n1620\n01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:21,690\nMaybe check out LinkedIn, check in with\nFacebook, find out where people are.\n\n1621\n01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:27,200\nI love Check In, I think it's called Check\nIn, that app where you get to somewhere,\n\n1622\n01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:31,590\nyou get to a place, it tells you hey,\nI'm at this bar having beer or whatever.\n\n1623\n01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:32,970\nIf I'm tracking you, right?\n\n1624\n01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,230\nI mean, think about this.\n\n1625\n01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:35,855\nIf I am stalking somebody.\n\n1626\n01:14:35,855 --> 01:14:38,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or I am looking to break into a company\n\n1627\n01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:40,810\nand I wanna know where\nthat network admin is.\n\n1628\n01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,040\nSo I know whether I can go on-\n>> He's\n\n1629\n01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:42,570\nnot on the-\n>> The hunt.\n\n1630\n01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:43,640\n>> Network if he's at the bar.\n\n1631\n01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,690\n>> If he's down at the bar drinking,\nI know I got a pretty good shot at getting\n\n1632\n01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,080\ninto that network because he's\nprobably not gonna answer his phone.\n\n1633\n01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,270\nEspecially if my buddy who was tailing him\nis sitting down and buying him drinks.\n\n1634\n01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:55,130\n>> Right, yep.\n>> Which is what\n\n1635\n01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:57,100\nwould be happening if I'm\ngonna break into his network.\n\n1636\n01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,610\nYou know, there was a great movie\na few years ago called Sneakers.\n\n1637\n01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:01,080\nNot a few, more than a few now.\n\n1638\n01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,980\nRobert Redford,\nSidney Poitier, Dan Aykroyd.\n\n1639\n01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:07,640\nSo another great movie that talked\nabout a bunch of ex-CIA spooks\n\n1640\n01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,110\nthat go into the security business and\n\n1641\n01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:12,320\nbasically do network security, bank\nsecurity, things like that for a living.\n\n1642\n01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,580\nBut it's a great movie because\nit talks about this whole idea\n\n1643\n01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:19,410\nof the social engineering phenomenon,\nthe pen testing phenomenon, right?\n\n1644\n01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:24,180\nThey get kind of brought up into\nthis whole thing we they get duped,\n\n1645\n01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:27,083\nand they're basically forced to break\ninto a place and steal something.\n\n1646\n01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,980\nOn the behest of a customer\nthat lies to them.\n\n1647\n01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:32,420\nBut it's just this whole idea of\nhow they go through and do it.\n\n1648\n01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:35,950\nAnd it's fascinating,\nfascinating as an art form to go out and\n\n1649\n01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,120\nengage in this kind of stuff.\n\n1650\n01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,090\nSo, discovery,\nreally important, enumeration.\n\n1651\n01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:42,880\nEnumeration is where we're gonna go in and\nstart drilling in.\n\n1652\n01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,990\nWe're gonna take the information we\nfind inside of the discovery phase and\n\n1653\n01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:48,440\nwe're gonna start going through.\n\n1654\n01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,366\nYeah, I think you put\nenumeration [CROSSTALK]\n\n1655\n01:15:49,366 --> 01:15:50,282\n>> I already got in on here, didn't I?\n\n1656\n01:15:50,282 --> 01:15:53,195\n>> So\nwe're gonna just start going through.\n\n1657\n01:15:53,195 --> 01:15:56,045\nAnd we're going to drill in and\nstart seeing, okay,\n\n1658\n01:15:56,045 --> 01:15:58,115\nso is it a Windows 7 machine?\n\n1659\n01:15:58,115 --> 01:15:59,355\nIs it a server 12 machine?\n\n1660\n01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:01,285\nIs it a Linux fedora kernel?\n\n1661\n01:16:01,285 --> 01:16:02,505\nWhat are we running there?\n\n1662\n01:16:02,505 --> 01:16:03,115\nRight.\nSo\n\n1663\n01:16:03,115 --> 01:16:07,165\nwe're going to start identifying\noperating systems, identifying port maps,\n\n1664\n01:16:07,165 --> 01:16:10,285\nwhat ports are running,\nwhat protocols are running.\n\n1665\n01:16:10,285 --> 01:16:13,805\nSo we're going to do OS finger printing\nand identifying the ports, and\n\n1666\n01:16:13,805 --> 01:16:15,950\nall that kind of stuff\nhappens in enumeration.\n\n1667\n01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:18,970\nAnd map, as we showed this great tool for\ndoing this kind of stuff.\n\n1668\n01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:21,500\nThere are many others by the way,\nbut just as we set.\n\n1669\n01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,480\nThen we'll do vulnerability\nmapping where we're gonna go in,\n\n1670\n01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,920\nit's probably one of the most\nimportant phases of the pen test.\n\n1671\n01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,870\nWe're gonna have identify through\nnumeration all the stuff we see.\n\n1672\n01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:32,740\nWe're then gonna start trying\nknown vulnerabilities or\n\n1673\n01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,470\nindicators of know vulnerabilities.\n\n1674\n01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,750\nTo see what's there and\nwhat we can get away with.\n\n1675\n01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:41,930\nWe may try to inject scripts or\ncode against known SQL vulnerabilities.\n\n1676\n01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,390\nWe'll find SQL databases\nto do injection attacks.\n\n1677\n01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:47,990\nWe may try to send malform packets in\nthrough the routers in the firewall\n\n1678\n01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:51,530\nto see whether or not we're able to\npush those attacks like we talked about.\n\n1679\n01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:53,800\nThe sin fludge right?\n\n1680\n01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,940\nOr the teardrop attacks, the fraggle\nattacks, smurfs, all that stuff, right?\n\n1681\n01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,850\nSo we're going to go through and\ntry to push all that.\n\n1682\n01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:02,845\nWe may do an xmas scam and\ntry to see how many flags we light up and\n\n1683\n01:17:02,845 --> 01:17:06,085\nfind out what's going on in there and\nthen try those vulnerabilities.\n\n1684\n01:17:06,085 --> 01:17:10,665\nWe may try to get you to,\nuse or download a piece\n\n1685\n01:17:10,665 --> 01:17:15,197\nof software through a surreptitious\nmanipulation of URLs or redirects.\n\n1686\n01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,777\nThat will then launch rootkits and\n\n1687\n01:17:16,777 --> 01:17:19,659\ndecode them there that we\ncan use to take over things.\n\n1688\n01:17:19,659 --> 01:17:24,187\nWe may try to introduce that by\nintroducing media into a system, right?\n\n1689\n01:17:24,187 --> 01:17:27,530\nWe may leave thumb drives\nlying around to see who\n\n1690\n01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:29,040\nwho will pick them up and plug them in.\n\n1691\n01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,290\nI could share with you so many stories\nof things we have done over the years.\n\n1692\n01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:33,200\n>> I know, we've done all kinds of things.\n\n1693\n01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,989\nYeah.\n>> We've scattered them around in\n\n1694\n01:17:34,989 --> 01:17:39,080\nparking lots before and left them, people\npick them up and go and plug them in.\n\n1695\n01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,440\n>> Plug them into their work computers.\n\n1696\n01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,559\n>> And plug them in-\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n1697\n01:17:41,559 --> 01:17:43,130\n>> They want to see what's on it.\n\n1698\n01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:45,830\nAnd on that thumb drive\nwe have put root kits,\n\n1699\n01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:47,390\nnothing that would destroy a network.\n\n1700\n01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:51,940\nBut root kits or RATS, Remote Access\nTrojans that allow us, as pentesters\n\n1701\n01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:56,110\nto then get in and take over the system,\nbecause we're doing a black box test.\n\n1702\n01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:57,190\nWe're not inside the network.\n\n1703\n01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:59,270\nWe've got no knowledge of that network.\n\n1704\n01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:00,340\nI've gotta get in somehow.\n\n1705\n01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:02,285\nAnd if you're gonna open the door for me,\n\n1706\n01:18:02,285 --> 01:18:04,571\nI would be an idiot not to\nlet you do that, right?\n\n1707\n01:18:04,571 --> 01:18:06,059\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I will say thank you,\n\n1708\n01:18:06,059 --> 01:18:08,290\nall the way to the bank, right?\n\n1709\n01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:09,490\nWe've done these kinds of things and\n\n1710\n01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:12,830\nI promise you,\nas silly as it sounds, they work.\n\n1711\n01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:14,250\nThey work all the time.\n\n1712\n01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:18,080\nWhat about that cleaning company that I\nmentioned that may stick these thumbdrives\n\n1713\n01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,000\nonto the backs of computers and\nyou won't even know they're there, right?\n\n1714\n01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,830\n>> Yeah, when's the last time,\na lot of you people,\n\n1715\n01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:24,560\nwhen's the last time you looked\nat the back of your computer?\n\n1716\n01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,511\nWhat if a little keystroke logger.\n\n1717\n01:18:26,511 --> 01:18:28,110\n>> Right.\nCould be their hardware.\n\n1718\n01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:31,990\nRight, between the keyboard itself and\nthe interface or software based.\n\n1719\n01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:34,040\nLoaded off that same thumb\ndrive that loads that route and\n\n1720\n01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:34,960\nthat root kit for you.\n\n1721\n01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,560\nSo these are happening in\nvulnerability mapping.\n\n1722\n01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,238\nExploitations where we then go in and\n\n1723\n01:18:39,238 --> 01:18:41,260\nactually take advantage of\nthe vulnerabilities that we find, right?\n\n1724\n01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,190\nSo that's what we're gonna come and\n\n1725\n01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:46,210\nbasically take away your pretty\nlittle network from you.\n\n1726\n01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:46,960\nTake all your data.\n\n1727\n01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:52,040\nAnd then avoiding detection, is where we\nescape out the back door after the fact.\n\n1728\n01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,500\nYesterday we were talking about, in memory\nconfigurations and routers and, right?\n\n1729\n01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,030\nBeing able to wipe the router with\na firewall while running config on the way\n\n1730\n01:18:59,030 --> 01:18:59,840\nout the door.\n\n1731\n01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,390\nAs an old school hacking trick.\n\n1732\n01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:04,160\nAnd so, this is one of the things we would\ndo to avoid detection, exactly that.\n\n1733\n01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,080\nCover our tracks.\n\n1734\n01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,210\nRight?\nAnd I can share with you lots and\n\n1735\n01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:10,775\nlots of stories of things we've\ndone in that regard, as well.\n\n1736\n01:19:10,775 --> 01:19:14,320\nObviously some of them are more fit for\npublic consumption than others.\n\n1737\n01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But at the end of\n\n1738\n01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,360\nthe day what you have to\nunderstand is that you're\n\n1739\n01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:21,270\ndealing with people that are experts at\ndoing this when you're hiring pentesters.\n\n1740\n01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,270\nYou're hiring the good guys, by the way.\n\n1741\n01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:26,669\nBut there are lots of bad guys out\nthere that are just as clever,\n\n1742\n01:19:26,669 --> 01:19:31,096\njust as good as what we do, and ultimately\nmay be even more clever because they're\n\n1743\n01:19:31,096 --> 01:19:35,221\ncoming up with new exploits that the\npentesters may not even be aware of yet.\n\n1744\n01:19:35,221 --> 01:19:39,272\nSo there's a lot of opportunity out\nthere for somebody to come along and\n\n1745\n01:19:39,272 --> 01:19:43,119\nreally spend some time getting to\nknow you in a not comfortable way,\n\n1746\n01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:45,772\nif you're not very careful\nabout what you do.\n\n1747\n01:19:45,772 --> 01:19:46,712\nJust be aware of that.\n\n1748\n01:19:46,712 --> 01:19:49,679\nNow, having said that we do have one other\nthing we want to talk about with you are,\n\n1749\n01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:50,810\nthe type of pen tests, right?\n\n1750\n01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:51,940\nSo, what are they?\n\n1751\n01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:55,790\nSo we talked in one of our prior episodes\nabout black box, gray box, white box.\n\n1752\n01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:58,440\nI thought it was good to just throw this\nback up in case you haven't seen that\n\n1753\n01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,840\nepisode, you have a good way of linking\nthis to another knowledge point.\n\n1754\n01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,796\nLike this idea here, we mentioned this\nin the risk analysis section actually,\n\n1755\n01:20:04,796 --> 01:20:07,350\nin risk management is where we talked\nabout this in one of the other\n\n1756\n01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:09,060\ntopics of the shows.\n\n1757\n01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:12,800\nSo the idea here is that a black box test,\nor what's often commonly refered to\n\n1758\n01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,370\nas a zero knowledge test,\nis done from outside the network.\n\n1759\n01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:20,900\nYou're hired by the company, by\nthe entity, to come in and do this test.\n\n1760\n01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:24,010\nWe talk about your get out of jail free\ncard, that signed statement that gives you\n\n1761\n01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:28,940\npermission to do this, signed by\nthe proper authority inside the network.\n\n1762\n01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:31,760\nSo typically it's a more senior,\nupper level person.\n\n1763\n01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,920\nBut you do need permission,\nI want to be clear about this for\n\n1764\n01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,780\nany kind of pen testing to be done and\nto be done properly.\n\n1765\n01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:41,400\nYou must seek and get and be given\nunequivocally permission of the owner of\n\n1766\n01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,580\nthe network or from the owner of\nthe network to engage in these activities.\n\n1767\n01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:47,670\nWe joke around about a lot of stuff\naround here as you can see but\n\n1768\n01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:49,660\nwe don't joke around about\nsomething like this.\n\n1769\n01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,050\nIf you don't have permission,\nyou're hacking.\n\n1770\n01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:55,510\nIf you have permission then you\nmay be hacking ethically, but\n\n1771\n01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:58,870\nyou're hacking with permission that's very\ndifferent than hacking without permission.\n\n1772\n01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,780\n>> Yep.\n>> And that is not acceptable,\n\n1773\n01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,560\nit is not ethical behavior.\n\n1774\n01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,070\nIt is not appropriate for an SSCP, or for\nany security practitioner by the way,\n\n1775\n01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,460\ncertified as an ISC\nsquared practitioner or\n\n1776\n01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:11,620\nnot, to engage in that kind of behavior.\n\n1777\n01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,160\nI'm not saying it doesn't happen.\n\n1778\n01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:16,210\nBut I want to be clear about the facts,\nit's unethical and it should not be done.\n\n1779\n01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:19,870\nRight, so black box testing,\nzero knowledge,\n\n1780\n01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:21,320\nwe do it from outside the network.\n\n1781\n01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,450\nLiterally we're probably just\ngiven a package that says here's\n\n1782\n01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:26,710\nthe name of the company,\nyou have two weeks, tell us what you find.\n\n1783\n01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,160\nThat's the extent of what we get.\n\n1784\n01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,280\nRight, gray box testing,\npartial knowledge,\n\n1785\n01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:34,760\nagain typically done from outside the\nnetwork, normally not done from inside.\n\n1786\n01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,330\nGray box testing is where you're\ngoing to given some knowledge.\n\n1787\n01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:41,370\nYou'll be given the name of the company,\nmaybe given external IP addresses.\n\n1788\n01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:42,610\nSomewhere to start right?\n\n1789\n01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:45,840\nA little bit of knowledge, but really not\nenough to get in, you've really got to\n\n1790\n01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,850\nexercise your chops there and understand\nhow to do full pen test to get in.\n\n1791\n01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:50,950\nAnd then white box testing, or\n\n1792\n01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:54,020\nwhat we call full knowledge testing is\nwhere you're on the inside of the network.\n\n1793\n01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:56,820\nAnd we were talking right before we\nstarted during the break about this.\n\n1794\n01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,560\nAnd I said you may be\nsitting on the knock, right?\n\n1795\n01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,330\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> Watching the Christmas trees light up\n\n1796\n01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:01,160\non the boards.\n\n1797\n01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,210\nYou're actually sitting there\n\n1798\n01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:03,480\ninside the network-\n>> Right.\n\n1799\n01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:06,840\n>> With the full knowledge and\ninteraction of the teams that manage it,\n\n1800\n01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,680\ngoing through and doing the scans,\ndoing them from inside.\n\n1801\n01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,460\nThings like Nmap might be run inside.\n\n1802\n01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,200\n>> Right.\n>> And you're really\n\n1803\n01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,620\ngonna look at all that\ninformation aggregated all up, so\n\n1804\n01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:17,530\nyou do wanna be aware of that and\nunderstand that as well.\n\n1805\n01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:20,360\n>> I always though of the black box as\nbeing a good way to see what the bad\n\n1806\n01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,310\nguys really see.\n\n1807\n01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:24,590\nBecause they don't have any other\nknowledge than what's publicly available,\n\n1808\n01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:29,110\nso you get to see this is what\nI look like to the bad guys.\n\n1809\n01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:33,310\nThe weakness of that, I find,\nis that they might not see everything.\n\n1810\n01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:36,680\nYou might have some stuff secured well\nenough where it's not exposed during that\n\n1811\n01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,740\ntype of a test.\n\n1812\n01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,760\nYou go to the white box where\nthey've got full knowledge,\n\n1813\n01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,260\nnow you're basically\nout there in the wind.\n\n1814\n01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:45,105\nSo they can see everything and\nit's a more thorough,\n\n1815\n01:22:45,105 --> 01:22:47,890\nin-depth examination of what you've got.\n\n1816\n01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:48,800\n>> If it's done the right way.\n\n1817\n01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,070\nAnd obviously making sure that\nit's done the right way and\n\n1818\n01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:53,490\nyou have a knowledgeable practitioner,\nis the key, right?\n\n1819\n01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:55,920\nIt is the key.\nKnowledge is the key, as they say.\n\n1820\n01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:56,810\nAll right.\nSo very good.\n\n1821\n01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,420\nI think we've just about covered it.\n\n1822\n01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,280\n>> You got it covered?\n>> I think so.\n\n1823\n01:22:59,280 --> 01:22:59,940\n>> All right.\n\n1824\n01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:01,980\nWell, I hope you guys out\nthere enjoyed our show.\n\n1825\n01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,370\nThat's going to do it for this one.\n\n1826\n01:23:03,370 --> 01:23:06,200\nRemember, if you guys are watching\nthe show

TV, I'm Mike Roger and\n\n4\n00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,900\ntoday with me I've got Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n5\n00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,860\n>> Howdy everybody.\n\n6\n00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,046\n>> And we're going to be going over\nsome risk response and recovery.\n\n7\n00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:47,327\nAnother episode in our SSCP.\n\n8\n00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:51,879\nSo we're gonna be hitting some things\nlike understanding risk management,\n\n9\n00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,920\nperforming some security assessments,\nincident handling.\n\n10\n00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,084\nAnd then we'll probably wrap things\nup with a little BCP and DRP.\n\n11\n00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:00,789\n>> Absolutely.\n\n12\n00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:01,942\n>> Sound like a plan?\n\n13\n00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:03,479\n>> Good recipe for success.\n\n14\n00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,991\n>> Yes, I like it, I like it.\n\n15\n00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:06,620\n>> All right, so let's jump in.\n\n16\n00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,611\nLet's talk a bit about some of the\noverarching things, these key criterias,\n\n17\n00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:14,685\nor these key themes we keep coming\nback to, as we have these discussions.\n\n18\n00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:17,426\nWe always start out talking\nabout the three pillars, right,\n\n19\n00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:20,125\nthe three underlying architectural\nelements of security.\n\n20\n00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,606\nWe talk about confidentiality,\ntalk about [COUGH] integrity,\n\n21\n00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:25,445\ntalk about availability.\n\n22\n00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:28,484\nAnd so reminding you about the AIC triad,\nthe iron triangle,\n\n23\n00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:31,740\nwhatever you wanna refer to it as,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n24\n00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,970\nThe point is understand that information\nsecurity is composed of these three\n\n25\n00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,780\nelements.\n\n26\n00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,620\nAnd really keeping those in mind as\nwe go through each of the domains\n\n27\n00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,740\nbecomes very important.\n\n28\n00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,450\nBecause that way we see the connection,\ntime in and time out, area to area,\n\n29\n00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,500\nas we talk about things like risk,\nchange, threat, and vulnerability.\n\n30\n00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,510\nPolicy, procedure, baseline, guideline,\nsystem development life cycle,\n\n31\n00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,090\nany of the things we've mentioned, or will\nmention as we continue our conversations,\n\n32\n00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,750\nall of them some how in some way link\nback to one or more of these topics.\n\n33\n00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,330\nAnd so really understanding that\nthe intersection of confidentiality,\n\n34\n00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:09,550\nintegrity and availability gives us the\nframework to manage information security,\n\n35\n00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,580\nis one of the things that we want to make\nsure we start off our conversation with.\n\n36\n00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,980\nAnd really are just focused on a little\nbit in relation to how that impacts you.\n\n37\n00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,440\nAnd what I would suggest to you, listening\nto us as we go through this material,\n\n38\n00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,450\nis you'll be thinking about what\nhappens in your day to day practice as\n\n39\n00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,870\na security professional.\n\n40\n00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,390\nWhere do you encounter issues\npertaining to confidentiality?\n\n41\n00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,510\nIn our upcoming shows,\nwe'll be talking about cryptography and\n\n42\n00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,920\ntalk about the application\nof confidentiality,\n\n43\n00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,890\nhow we do that through software or\nin some cases hardware based solutions.\n\n44\n00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,990\nWhere do you see integrity popping up and\ninteracting?\n\n45\n00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,632\nAnd how do you deal with things like\na PKI, a public key infrastructure,\n\n46\n00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:49,280\ndigital certificates and hashing solutions\nthat bring integrity to the forefront.\n\n47\n00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,810\nIn all of the information security\nmanagement solutions that we see today,\n\n48\n00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,303\nas professionals we're asked to deal with,\nright?\n\n49\n00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,100\nAnd how do we then deal with availability?\n\n50\n00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,480\nI mean availability is all\naround us everywhere we go.\n\n51\n00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,980\nIt could be something as simple as\nmaking sure you have a power supply for\n\n52\n00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,210\nyour laptop, if your battery runs out, but\n\n53\n00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,180\nit could be something a lot\nmore complicated than that.\n\n54\n00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,490\nIt could be managing an entire\navailability system for\n\n55\n00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,020\nnot just one machine, but for\nan entire enterprise or global network.\n\n56\n00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,940\n>> Right.\n>> Where we have back up\n\n57\n00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,330\npower supplies,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n58\n00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,300\n>> We have a redundant data system.\n\n59\n00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,170\nWe have a redundant data center.\n\n60\n00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,890\nWe'll be talking about\nsome of these concepts,\n\n61\n00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,290\nand what some of those things mean.\n\n62\n00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,410\nAnd most importantly, as we've talked\nabout in prior discussions, a plan, and\n\n63\n00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,150\nreally documented plan that tells us\nhow to be safe, how to be secure,\n\n64\n00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,290\nbut in this case,\nhow to maintain availability.\n\n65\n00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,310\nAnd all those things are gonna be\nimportant, so think about how you\n\n66\n00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,270\nare seeing those things emerge today\nin your practice as a professional.\n\n67\n00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,350\nAnd if you're just starting out down the\nroad to becoming an information security\n\n68\n00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,280\nprofessional, maybe working in IT, but\nmay not have a focus on security today\n\n69\n00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,820\nper se\n>> Right.\n\n70\n00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,570\n>> And this is your entry point into that.\n\n71\n00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,070\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,630\n>> This is where you're\n\n73\n00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,790\ngoing to start thinking about becoming\nmore of a security professional by\n\n74\n00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,930\nobtaining a certification like this.\n\n75\n00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,020\nStart asking those peers,\nthose colleagues,\n\n76\n00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,470\nthose people you work with, how they do\nthe things that you're hearing about and\n\n77\n00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,160\nhow they do the things that\nyou want to learn more about.\n\n78\n00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,980\nUse those resources, in other words\nis what I'm suggesting to you,\n\n79\n00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,920\nthat you have at hand to learn first\nhand how these things are being done.\n\n80\n00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,760\nAnd then take that knowledge and\nmake it your own.\n\n81\n00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,600\nFigure out a way to customize and\nto personalize it at the end of the day.\n\n82\n00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,750\nRight?\nVery important.\n\n83\n00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,830\nAll right, so let's talk a bit about risk.\n\n84\n00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,100\nAnd let's talk about risk,\nrisk management one of the key areas,\n\n85\n00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,600\nfocuses of our conversations of this\nshow is gonna be about risk and\n\n86\n00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080\nrecovery and how we manage those elements.\n\n87\n00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,380\nAnd we see risk around us\nin everything we do today.\n\n88\n00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,550\nWhether it's getting out\nof the bed in the morning,\n\n89\n00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,720\ntrying to navigate to the bathroom when\nyou still haven't had your coffee.\n\n90\n00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,713\nAnd figuring out how to do that\nwithout hurting yourself, right?\n\n91\n00:04:37,713 --> 00:04:41,000\nOr whether it's something a little bit\nmore focused, a little bit more central.\n\n92\n00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,570\nSomething like driving to work every day.\n\n93\n00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,875\nYou know it seems like it's\nalmost become a video game,\n\n94\n00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,970\nright, where we have to\nnavigate through traffic.\n\n95\n00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,130\n>> Almost sleep right through it.\n\n96\n00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,060\n>> You could potentially, but it also\npotentially could be an issue where\n\n97\n00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,290\nyou may have this person next to\nyou trying to put on makeup and\n\n98\n00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,630\nanswer the cell phone and\ntext and read the paper.\n\n99\n00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,340\nI live in south Florida, I've seen some\nincredibly crazy things on the roads.\n\n100\n00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,970\nAnd I live and work, I have lived and\n\n101\n00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,205\nworked all over the country at\nvarious points, and even abroad.\n\n102\n00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:10,930\nAnd in some of these cities,\nwhere the standard commute may be\n\n103\n00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,130\nhours as opposed to minutes,\nor perhaps even longer,\n\n104\n00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,094\nthe reality is you see all sorts\nof strange things in traffic.\n\n105\n00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:21,140\n>> I lived up in D.C. for awhile, and\nI was on the Beltway for the first time.\n\n106\n00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,940\nI had just moved to a different office.\n\n107\n00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,210\nAnd I get on there and\nI look over at the guy next to me and\n\n108\n00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,910\nhe's got a full blown book, I mean\na hardcover book on his steering wheel.\n\n109\n00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,580\nI'm thinking, what is this guy doing?\n\n110\n00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,240\nThen I realize, well we've got about ten\nminutes between every five foot move, and\n\n111\n00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,175\nyou might as well, right?\n\n112\n00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:37,930\n>> [LAUGH] So\nthere it is if you think about it,\n\n113\n00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,880\ntaking advantage, being proactive and\nplanning out your day.\n\n114\n00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,580\nTime management is really critical to\nbeing as successful security professional.\n\n115\n00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,970\nDon't get me wrong,\nwe want to put that in context, right?\n\n116\n00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,790\nSo we joke about it, but\nit is a serious thing.\n\n117\n00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,390\nAnd when we take that and apply that\nto security, we're still talking about\n\n118\n00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,325\ntraffic, right, cuz we're talking about\nnetwork traffic and flows of information.\n\n119\n00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:58,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But we're talking about them\n\n120\n00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,640\nin the context of the management\nof that traffic inside of our\n\n121\n00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,290\nnetworks and-\n>> Right.\n\n122\n00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:02,910\n>> Across boundary,\n\n123\n00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,280\nacross maybe a land-wind connection-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n124\n00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,550\n>> Out beyond the border, right?\n\n125\n00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,130\nOf our network.\n\n126\n00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,690\nAs we talked about in some of our previous\ndiscussions and previous episodes.\n\n127\n00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,080\nThis idea of bring your own Cloud.\n\n128\n00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,810\nAnd how we now see the Cloud\ncoming into the workplace.\n\n129\n00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,070\nAnd the crossover of personal and\nprofessional spaces, and\n\n130\n00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,990\nhow that information is being managed.\n\n131\n00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,410\nSo we really want to\nunderstand the impact of risk.\n\n132\n00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,480\nAnd the best place to start is\nby understanding some principles\n\n133\n00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,460\nrelated to risk and risk management, and\n\n134\n00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,030\nreally the idea there would be to\nunderstand and define some vocabulary.\n\n135\n00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,380\nLike any good thing, we gotta start\nout by understanding what things are.\n\n136\n00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,870\nSo let's talk about some terms, just get\na good working understanding of them,\n\n137\n00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,078\nand then we can begin to link those things\ntogether in relation to building some\n\n138\n00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:41,720\nconcepts, all right?\n\n139\n00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,340\n>> I like that.\n\n140\n00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,960\n>> So let's talk about risk.\n\n141\n00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720\nBut before we define risk broadly,\n\n142\n00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,970\nlet's talk about some of the building\nblocks of risk, all right?\n\n143\n00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,760\nSo let's talk about a threat, and\nlet's talk about a vulnerability, and\n\n144\n00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,640\nwe'll talk about a risk, and\nwe'll kinda talk about all three.\n\n145\n00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,160\nAnd so let's discuss what these things\nare, let's make sure we understand them.\n\n146\n00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,130\nAnd let's put them in the context of what\nit means to really assess information, and\n\n147\n00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,030\nsecure it.\n\n148\n00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,240\nSo when we think about a threat, right,\n\n149\n00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,380\nwe often talk about threats in relation\nto things that are imminent, right?\n\n150\n00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,080\nAnd so a threat of something happening\n\n151\n00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,220\nis potentially something that\nmay be realized relatively soon.\n\n152\n00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,550\nThe timeline is relatively compressed,\nright?\n\n153\n00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,530\nSo if you think of the fact that somebody\nis threatening you with bodily harm,\n\n154\n00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,170\nthey're probably in front of you,\npotentially imminently about to do damage\n\n155\n00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,030\nto you, or to potentially hurt you or\ndo something.\n\n156\n00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,035\nWhen we talk about weather, we live in\nsouth Florida, we live in Florida, but\n\n157\n00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:37,162\nI live in south Florida, but generally in\nFlorida, half of the year we talk about\n\n158\n00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:41,130\nbeing aware of serious weather events\nlike hurricanes and tropical storms.\n\n159\n00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,795\nAnd when they're close and offshore,\nand within maybe a day or so or\n\n160\n00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:48,007\ntwo of striking, we go from this\nidea of there being a risk,\n\n161\n00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:50,773\nwhich we'll define here\nas a broader context, and\n\n162\n00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:54,693\na vulnerability that we share or\nhave as a result of the risk of the storm,\n\n163\n00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:58,145\nto a threat that's about to happen,\nthat storm's offshore.\n\n164\n00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,136\nIt's gonna come on shore,\nit's gonna cause damage.\n\n165\n00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:04,126\nSo it's an imminent sense of something\nabout to happen is what a threat\n\n166\n00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,090\nis, right?\n\n167\n00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,070\nAnd the timeline is the critical\ndefining component here.\n\n168\n00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,980\nThreats are imminent and\nwe have to deal with them as such.\n\n169\n00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,850\nVulnerabilities, on the other hand,\nright, are going to be something\n\n170\n00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,825\nthat when we think of them, they may or\nmay not be known to us, number one, right?\n\n171\n00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:23,860\nSo as we do assessments, for instance.\n\n172\n00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,810\nWe do vulnerability assessments, but\n\n173\n00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,770\nwe may not be aware of certain things\nbeing a vulnerability, until we look for\n\n174\n00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,250\nthem, or run a program, or some sort of a\nway of figuring out what those things are.\n\n175\n00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,920\nWe talk about zero-day exploits as\nan example of a vulnerability that are not\n\n176\n00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,340\nknown to us until they become exposed.\n\n177\n00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,040\nBut there may be well-known\nvulnerabilities.\n\n178\n00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,090\nWe may have the inability to apply\na security patch, on our behalf, that's\n\n179\n00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,550\nbeen documented by a vendor, may lead to\na vulnerability existing in our system.\n\n180\n00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,120\nThat is well known, is well documented,\nbut we may have overlooked it for\n\n181\n00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,140\nwhatever the reason is.\n\n182\n00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,730\nMaybe lack of policy, bad documentation,\nsomebody forgot to look at a checklist,\n\n183\n00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,620\nwho knows what.\n\n184\n00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,240\nAnd so that vulnerability may or\nmay not be known to us, but\n\n185\n00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,570\nit is a state of existence, right?\n\n186\n00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,310\nIt's something that is in\nthe system we're looking at, or\n\n187\n00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,350\npotentially there,\nthat has to be addressed once identified.\n\n188\n00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,120\nSo the key with vulnerabilities is to\nunderstand that we have to have knowledge\n\n189\n00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,480\nof them, we have to be aware\nof them in other words, right?\n\n190\n00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,630\nIn order to address them,\nto take them on and\n\n191\n00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,860\nreally make sure that\nwe are aware of that.\n\n192\n00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,580\nAnd Mike, what we might want to do\nquickly, just as I am looking at this, and\n\n193\n00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,790\nI'm looking at it across the screen, is\nmaybe increase the font size a little bit.\n\n194\n00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,980\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\n>> Just so everybody can see it.\n\n195\n00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,730\nI'm finding it a little\nhard to take a look.\n\n196\n00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,500\n>> Okay. [LAUGH] >> And\nget that from where I am sitting.\n\n197\n00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,840\nAnd I know if I am it may be hard for\nthe users to see as well.\n\n198\n00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,580\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n199\n00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,140\n>> So we'll give Mike just a second\nto do that while we're talking.\n\n200\n00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,130\nBut as we're talking through this, what I\nwant you guys to think about is, make sure\n\n201\n00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,280\nyou understand the construct, right,\nthe way we link these terms together,\n\n202\n00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,010\nthe puzzle, if you will, of how we\nlink vocabulary terms to actions.\n\n203\n00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,120\nAnd ultimately create vocabulary and\nunderstanding that leads to awareness.\n\n204\n00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,820\nAnd so when we think about risk,\nwhen we think about threat,\n\n205\n00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,910\nwe think about vulnerability, we're\nthinking about the ideas, the building\n\n206\n00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,830\nblocks that help us to understand how to\ncreate security and security environments.\n\n207\n00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,870\nSecure programs and environments and\narchitectures, that are based on this idea\n\n208\n00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,450\nof identification of time and\nidentification of impact.\n\n209\n00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,750\nWhat is the vulnerability?\n\n210\n00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,510\nWhat is the threat?\n\n211\n00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,530\nWhat is the risk?\n\n212\n00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,340\nIs this idea of time and impact.\n\n213\n00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,533\nAnd we'll come back to this\nidea a little bit more,\n\n214\n00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,980\nwe'll talk about it as we talk about\nprobability, impact, exposure.\n\n215\n00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,910\nThis idea of what we call PIE,\ngenerically, and how we raid and\n\n216\n00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,465\nrank vulnerabilities and\nimpact and assessment of them.\n\n217\n00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:34,175\nWe're gonna talk a lot about this\nidea of how to identify risk, and\n\n218\n00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,215\nhow to then take that identification,\nand ultimately manage through that\n\n219\n00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:42,415\nidentification to create awareness of\nvulnerabilities through identification and\n\n220\n00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:45,395\nthen remediation, action to address them.\n\n221\n00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,275\nAnd also to be aware of\nthreats that become imminent,\n\n222\n00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:52,110\nthat may move up the ladder on\nprioritized scales of some kind.\n\n223\n00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,830\nBecause all of a sudden they have come\nto the forefront because of a change in\n\n224\n00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,050\nthe awareness, a change in the situation,\na change in whatever that may be.\n\n225\n00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,780\nWe have to be aware of that timeliness\nas we talk about security at all times.\n\n226\n00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,140\nSo I'm seeing,\nit looks like we got a bigger font.\n\n227\n00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,091\n>> Tell you what,\nfirst time we've ever had a plus plus.\n\n228\n00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:08,964\n>> Good, okay, well that's good.\n\n229\n00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:11,513\nSo now we got it working, so it looks\nlike it might be a little easier for\n\n230\n00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:12,660\nyou guys to see as well.\n\n231\n00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,298\nSo hopefully that'll be better,\n\n232\n00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,081\ncuz I didn't bring my super\nzoom focal eyes with me today.\n\n233\n00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:17,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I was\n\n234\n00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,310\nhaving a little bit of trouble\nseeing that from where I was too.\n\n235\n00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,720\nAll right.\nSo as we were talking about,\n\n236\n00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,330\nwe're talking about vulnerabilities\nbeing something in the system\n\n237\n00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,570\nthat needs to be identified.\n\n238\n00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,230\nAnd remember,\nthe key here is that we may or may not,\n\n239\n00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,990\nas it says in the first hashtag there,\nmay or may not be known to us, right?\n\n240\n00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,070\nSo there's a sense of potentially we\nhave a catalog of known vulnerabilities,\n\n241\n00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,540\nbut we also have this qualified\narea off to the side,\n\n242\n00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,770\nthis column that has\na question mark in it, right?\n\n243\n00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,360\n>> Right.\n>> But we don't necessarily know what goes\n\n244\n00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,210\nin that column until we do some\ndue diligence, some research,\n\n245\n00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,010\nand maybe just some waiting and\nseeing, right?\n\n246\n00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,940\nYou have to develop over time.\n\n247\n00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,140\nSo just think about that.\n\n248\n00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,500\nAnd then the risk areas, we talk about\nrisk, the identification of risk.\n\n249\n00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,315\nReally, let's talk about\na definition first.\n\n250\n00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:59,170\n>> Okay.\n>> This idea of understanding,\n\n251\n00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,554\nrisk is really about this idea that\nit's not imminent per se, right?\n\n252\n00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:05,880\nSo risk may be something that will occur.\n\n253\n00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,110\nThere's a sense of urgency.\n\n254\n00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,690\nSo it is defiantly\nsomething to be aware of.\n\n255\n00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,720\nIt's something that may occur.\n\n256\n00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,610\nBut it is not gonna be linked to\na time line the way threat is,\n\n257\n00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,320\nin the sense that threat is imminent.\n\n258\n00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,900\nRisk is that undefined activity out there\nthat we know of, we are aware of, but\n\n259\n00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,510\ndoesn't have a time associated with it.\n\n260\n00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,560\n>> Okay.\n>> So there's a risk, right?\n\n261\n00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,520\nThat we may encounter in the future a\nvulnerability that's unknown to us today,\n\n262\n00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,480\nbut we don't know when.\n\n263\n00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,440\n>> Right.\n>> And so it's hard to say for\n\n264\n00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,040\nsure when that's gonna happen.\n\n265\n00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,210\nSo we call that a zero-day vulnerability,\nor a zero-day exploit, rather.\n\n266\n00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,880\nBut we don't know exactly\nwhen it will emerge.\n\n267\n00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,940\nWill it be tomorrow?\n\n268\n00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,430\nWill it be 200 days from now?\n\n269\n00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,290\nWill it be a year from now?\n\n270\n00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,330\nWill it be never?\n\n271\n00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,690\nBecause maybe nobody will ever\nuse the software in that way\n\n272\n00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,570\nto expose the behavior that could then\nbe classified as the vulnerability.\n\n273\n00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,620\nSo the risk exists as a potentiality.\n\n274\n00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,720\nA potentiality for\nsomething to be identified or\n\n275\n00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,440\nto go wrong, but\nwe don't know when it will happen, right?\n\n276\n00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,660\nA potentiality or the potential of\nthere being some sort of issue there\n\n277\n00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,330\nis how we would deal with risk.\n\n278\n00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,660\nAnd now risk is a very interesting\nconcept because what risk\n\n279\n00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,450\nallows us to understand and\nto measure at the end of the day,\n\n280\n00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,040\nis the likelihood of impact to our\nbusiness, whatever that business is.\n\n281\n00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,260\nSo it allows us with a scale, we will\ncreate a scale around measurement of\n\n282\n00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,280\nimpact and risk, it allows us\nto measure the potential impact,\n\n283\n00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,870\nor the potential downside if you will,\nto something being\n\n284\n00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,310\nengaged in as an activity or\nsomething happening, maybe external.\n\n285\n00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,926\nAnd so we talked a lot in some prior\nepisodes about this need to document,\n\n286\n00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:44,520\nthis need to have policy and procedure,\nand to understand how things are working.\n\n287\n00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,510\nThe risk associated with\nnot having documentation,\n\n288\n00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,210\ngood up to date documentation, for\n\n289\n00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,220\ninstance Mike, is that we may run into\na situation where new team members,\n\n290\n00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,645\nnew people that are joining our security\nteam, for instance, come on board,\n\n291\n00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:02,815\nmay not be handed the right documentation\nup to date about the state of our systems.\n\n292\n00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:05,735\nThey may then make choices\nabout what they wanna do,\n\n293\n00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:09,400\nhow they want to administer changes\nthat they may want to make.\n\n294\n00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,330\nAnd if those document items are not up\nto date, imagine the potential risk\n\n295\n00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,980\nassociated with those changes\nif we don't really understand.\n\n296\n00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,860\n>> Yeah, they're basing their decisions\non incorrect and invalid information.\n\n297\n00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,290\n>> Potentially could be, and as a result,\n\n298\n00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,850\nwhat would the impact to\nthe business be of that, right?\n\n299\n00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,190\nIf I made a change and i didn't truly\nunderstand what that impact was, or\n\n300\n00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,400\npotentially that impact, right?\n\n301\n00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,140\nThe potential exposure,\nas we talk about it being with risk.\n\n302\n00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,440\nI may actually go and make the one change\nthat opens the system to the exact\n\n303\n00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,115\nvulnerabilities I thought I was\navoided by not doing it another way,\n\n304\n00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:42,640\nright?Because I wasn't aware\nof the up to date information.\n\n305\n00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,340\nAnd so this is really very, very critical.\n\n306\n00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,770\nAnd this awareness, and we do really\nrefer to it as risk awareness,\n\n307\n00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,900\nof what the impact, what the potential\nliabilities are, is what understanding and\n\n308\n00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,020\nmanaging risk is about.\n\n309\n00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,010\nJust like understanding a managing change.\n\n310\n00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,210\nWe've been talking about change in\none of our prior discussions, and\n\n311\n00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,170\nreally the impact of change is\nabout this idea of understanding\n\n312\n00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,380\nhow to create opportunity, where we see\nthat availability to make a change.\n\n313\n00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,160\nWe see potentially, you know, a lot of\ntimes, people think of it as negative.\n\n314\n00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,240\nI talked about this when we\nwere talking about change.\n\n315\n00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,044\nBut I see it more as an opportunity, and\n\n316\n00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,830\nit's a question then of\nhow well you are educated.\n\n317\n00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,950\nHow well you are armed, and\n\n318\n00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,800\nwhat tools you bring to the table about\ninforming that change, and as a result,\n\n319\n00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,540\ntaking advantage of it, that creates the\nopportunity for success or failure there.\n\n320\n00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,250\nAnd I think of risk the same way.\n\n321\n00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,600\nIf we're well armed and well versed in\nidentifying risks in our environment, and\n\n322\n00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800\nlet's be clear, as security practitioners,\nthat is one of our jobs.\n\n323\n00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,085\nBut also be clear about the fact that\nthat environment is unique to you,\n\n324\n00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:39,691\nyour business, whatever you do.\n\n325\n00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:44,391\nAnd that if you step into somebody else's\nnetwork, the risks are going to be\n\n326\n00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:48,650\nsimilar in the same way that you can\nidentify high level systems, and\n\n327\n00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,785\nsay we all run Windows technology today or\nMicrosoft technology.\n\n328\n00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,637\nAnd as a result we have a known pool of\nrisks and vulnerabilities we address.\n\n329\n00:15:56,637 --> 00:16:00,558\nBut then the configuration of those\nsystems leads to differences and\n\n330\n00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:03,600\nsubtleties that we have to document and\nbe aware of.\n\n331\n00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so\n\n332\n00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,590\nwe want to make sure that we have that\nmindset the dualities we look at risk and\n\n333\n00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,380\nunderstand how to carry that forward.\n\n334\n00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,090\nOne of the place that's going to be very\nhelpful to us in order to solidify and\n\n335\n00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,810\nreally formalize that thought process\naround risk is referring to NIST and\n\n336\n00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,610\nsome of the NIST standards\nthat are out there.\n\n337\n00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,390\nIn prior episodes we shared\nwith you the NIST website.\n\n338\n00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,800\nI'll give it to you again so\nwe can have Mike capture it for\n\n339\n00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,240\nyou and make sure we put\nit out there on the notes.\n\n340\n00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,050\nThe website is NIST.gov.\n\n341\n00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,180\nSo when we go out,\nthis is a US government website.\n\n342\n00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,560\nThe National Institute For\nStandards in technology, it's at NIST.gov.\n\n343\n00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,796\nAnd when we take a look at NIST and we\nlook specifically at the NIST SP 800-30.\n\n344\n00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,100\nSo this is the special publication.\n\n345\n00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,460\nSP stand for special publication.\n\n346\n00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:56,080\nSP [COUGH] 800-30 which is gonna to\nbe the NIST publication on risk and\n\n347\n00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,892\nrisk management.\n\n348\n00:16:56,892 --> 00:17:00,780\n800-30, right, so that's the one you\nwant to go look up on the website\n\n349\n00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,950\nif you wanna look for\nthis and understand this.\n\n350\n00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,060\nWhen we talk about risk and\nwe talk about in this definition of risk,\n\n351\n00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,730\nthis is a fairly well accepted,\nfairly well standardized risk definition.\n\n352\n00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,550\nAnd this is where we see a lot of risk\nmanagement solutions being launched from\n\n353\n00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,930\nand the starting point for\nthose risk solutions.\n\n354\n00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,890\nAnd so, the definition there is that\nrisk is a function of the likelihood\n\n355\n00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,280\nof the given threat sources\nexercising a potential or\n\n356\n00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,610\na particular potential vulnerability.\n\n357\n00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,840\nAn then as a result of that, the resulting\nimpact of that adverse event,\n\n358\n00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,270\nif it is adverse, and we say that\nrisk is typically adverse, right?\n\n359\n00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,930\nWe don't say we have a risk of doing good.\n\n360\n00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,200\n>> Right.\n>> We think of it as a risk of having bad\n\n361\n00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,690\nthings happen, so the negative adverse\nimpact of that event of the organization.\n\n362\n00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,050\nNow this is a very formalized definition,\nbut\n\n363\n00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:48,200\nit linked together likelihood threats,\nvulnerabilities, and impact.\n\n364\n00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,360\nAll of the things we just discussed and\nwent through and defined for\n\n365\n00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,860\nus in relation to risk.\n\n366\n00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,970\nAnd so, we want to make sure we think\nabout the fact that it's really about\n\n367\n00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,270\nthe likelihood that a negative outcome is\ngoing to happen based on us addressing and\n\n368\n00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,600\nhaving to face some sort of\nsituation through a vulnerability\n\n369\n00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,520\nthat exists out there in the world today.\n\n370\n00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,830\nThis is how the definition of\nrisk from a NIST perspective\n\n371\n00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,400\nis brought into the organization.\n\n372\n00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,920\nThis is one that, as practitioners,\nyou wanna really be familiar with and\n\n373\n00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,350\nyou wanna understand.\n\n374\n00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,925\nAnd I would encourage you to\ngo download that document,\n\n375\n00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,685\nread through it, take a look at it,\n\n376\n00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:25,515\nhave a workable understanding of it to\nbetter incorporate the discussions around\n\n377\n00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:29,805\nrisk into your planning cycles\ninside of your organizations today.\n\n378\n00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:34,245\nSo we've talked about threat, we've talked\nabout incidents, the idea that one or\n\n379\n00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:35,725\nmore of these things can happen.\n\n380\n00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,125\nWe've talked about vulnerabilities,\nwe've talked about risk.\n\n381\n00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,980\nWe need to talk about control,\nsafeguards and measures.\n\n382\n00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,670\nThese are some of the things that help\nus to mitigate, to minimize risk and\n\n383\n00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,420\nto deal with the impact of\nrisk by boxing it up and\n\n384\n00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,580\nputting it in a corner and\nkeeping an eye on it.\n\n385\n00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,285\nAnd hopefully potentially not allowing\nit to become too impactful, right?\n\n386\n00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:54,591\nWe don't want it to be\nbad if we can avoid it.\n\n387\n00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,801\nWe know there may be some pain associated\nwith running a windows system.\n\n388\n00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,651\nWe do have to patch there\nare things out there that go wrong,\n\n389\n00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:03,559\nbut if we have a regime in place\nwe have a policy, a standard,\n\n390\n00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,268\na guideline that we use, we have\na checklist, a weekly a monthly checklist,\n\n391\n00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:11,300\naround security management maybe even\na daily checklist for certain things.\n\n392\n00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,350\nThen as a result of that we're\ngonna minimize the impact of risk.\n\n393\n00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,610\nAnd so control safeguards and\n\n394\n00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,960\ncountermeasures become very important\nas thought processes for you.\n\n395\n00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,980\nAlso events and incidents, this idea\nof defining things as they happen,\n\n396\n00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,390\nmonitoring for them, keeping an eye\non them, analyzing them, and\n\n397\n00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,790\nreporting on them,\nwhich is really what events and\n\n398\n00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,225\nincidents are all about is this idea of\nunderstanding the real time intelligence.\n\n399\n00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:37,655\nAnd the gathering of real time\nintelligence in an organization\n\n400\n00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:42,035\nthat help us to better understand how\nwe're going to address and manage and\n\n401\n00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:44,275\nmonitor these things as they occur.\n\n402\n00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:47,480\nAnd so when we think about event,\nwe think about incident, and\n\n403\n00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,020\nwe think about control safeguards and\ncounter measures.\n\n404\n00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,020\nAnd we link all these things together.\n\n405\n00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,150\nWe begin to have the tool kit\nthat we need to address risk.\n\n406\n00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,450\nAnd I often talk to my clients,\nmy customers and\n\n407\n00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:02,700\nmy students, about this idea that you need\nto build a risk tool kit to manage risk.\n\n408\n00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,640\nJust like you need to build\na change management tool kit\n\n409\n00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,590\nto manage change in the organization.\n\n410\n00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,460\nYou need a framework, you need\nthe methodologies, and the accepted tools,\n\n411\n00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,210\nwhether it's a piece of software or\nit is a tool, a larger tool, an enterprise\n\n412\n00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,490\nscale tool, like a helpdesk tool that\nhelps to document and manage change.\n\n413\n00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,830\nWhatever it may be, you need to\nhave all of those things together.\n\n414\n00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,540\nAnd then, you need to identify and agree\non what they're gonna be ahead of time, so\n\n415\n00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,985\nthat not only you, but the people that\nyou work with, work around and work for\n\n416\n00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:35,589\nare all gonna be educated about the tools\nthat you're going to bring to bear, and\n\n417\n00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:38,663\nthe expectations of what those tools\ncan create in terms of success or\n\n418\n00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:41,949\nfailure because let's be honest not\neverything works the right way, and\n\n419\n00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,203\nthe way it's supposed to the first time,\nright?\n\n420\n00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,064\nBut we want to try to get\nthat as good as possible.\n\n421\n00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:49,227\nSo we want to have that expectation\nbecause the only way to measure success\n\n422\n00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:50,790\nis to understand failure.\n\n423\n00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,050\nAnd as a result of that we then can\nunderstand where we are in that continuum.\n\n424\n00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,550\nSo these are some of the things\nthat are important, so\n\n425\n00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,630\nunderstand the elements of risk\nI guess is what I'm saying.\n\n426\n00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,820\nAnd you know to be clear the elements of\nrisk as we've just identified them and\n\n427\n00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,440\ntalked about them are going to be\nthis idea of the assets that we face.\n\n428\n00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,090\nWhat are the computers, the desktops,\nthe intellectual property,\n\n429\n00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,290\nall the stuff that think of that we\nhave to associate with and manage.\n\n430\n00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,940\nSo the assets are one of\nthe key elements of risk, or\n\n431\n00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,000\nthe elements that we put\nunder the risk category.\n\n432\n00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000\nSo the assets of the organization,\n\n433\n00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,610\nthe threats that those assets are facing,\nand the vulnerabilities.\n\n434\n00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,140\nRight, that they also are potentially\ngoing to have inherent in their design and\n\n435\n00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,580\nin their architecture.\n\n436\n00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,510\nAll of those things lead into risk and\nare the building blocks of risk.\n\n437\n00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,670\nAs a result of that,\nwe then can create counter measures,\n\n438\n00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,450\nwhich then help us to mitigate,\nto deal with risk as a result of that.\n\n439\n00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,140\nSo those are some of the things we\nwant to be thinking about as we start\n\n440\n00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,060\nour conversation around risk.\n\n441\n00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,450\nAnd risk management at the end of the day,\nis really this idea of reducing to\n\n442\n00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,950\nan acceptable level the risks that these\norganizations, your organizations, our\n\n443\n00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,720\norganizations, talk about them, face as\na result of dealing with risk every day.\n\n444\n00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,430\nAnd so we have to really think\nabout how we get that risk down to\n\n445\n00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,310\nan acceptable level.\n\n446\n00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,170\nThere is no such thing\nas a zero risk solution.\n\n447\n00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,760\nWe want to start by having that in mind,\nright?\n\n448\n00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,220\nAnd so think about the fact that\nwhen you manage through risk,\n\n449\n00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,960\nyou can't ever and I want to be\nclear about this, you can never,\n\n450\n00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,200\never, get risk down to a zero level\ninside of a production level environment\n\n451\n00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,870\nin an enterprise with users, with\nsystems in production that are running\n\n452\n00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,700\ndifferent levels of software for\ndifferent reasons at different times.\n\n453\n00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,210\nThere isn't a good way to do it.\n\n454\n00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,310\nI'm not suggesting you can't do it.\n\n455\n00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,510\nIn a perfect bubble,\n\n456\n00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,360\nwhere we isolate everything,\nwe cut it off from the internet of things,\n\n457\n00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,350\nwe simply put that machine in an isolated\nenvironment, we never let a human being\n\n458\n00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,470\ntouch it, we could probably achieve a zero\nrisk result at a zero risk solution there.\n\n459\n00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,270\nBut that's not viable let's be honest.\n\n460\n00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,650\nYou can't really use that machine.\n\n461\n00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,340\nYou can look at it through the glass,\nright?\n\n462\n00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,170\nYou can wave at it you can say hi, but\n\n463\n00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,470\nyou can't really make it\npractical it's not usable.\n\n464\n00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,030\nAnd the minute we introduce\nhuman beings into the mix\n\n465\n00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,690\nwe introduce this idea of the butterfly\neffect or this unknown quantity.\n\n466\n00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,090\nAnd as a result strange things happen.\n\n467\n00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,440\nPeople show up to work and decide all of\na sudden that clicking on that link to\n\n468\n00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,100\nopen up that website was just the thing\nthey had to do today when they showed up.\n\n469\n00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,062\n>> Could not do without it.\n\n470\n00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:22,575\n>> Right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n471\n00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:23,970\n>> And as a result,\n\n472\n00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,390\nthe malware that's out there waiting for\n\n473\n00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,512\nthem now has an entry\npoint into the system.\n\n474\n00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:29,202\n>> Yeah, right.\n>> So we want to make sure we understand\n\n475\n00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:31,830\nthat it's not about getting\nto a zero risk level.\n\n476\n00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,720\nOur goal is to try to do that, but we have\nto be realistic about the fact that we\n\n477\n00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,230\nknow that it's an unachievable goal,\na noble goal but an unachievable one.\n\n478\n00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,850\nAnd so, falling short of that,\n\n479\n00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,570\nwhat we really want to see is a measure\nof success Is minimization of risk.\n\n480\n00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,972\nWe call mitigation, the minimization\nof risk to an acceptable level.\n\n481\n00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:50,497\nYou may be asking yourself,\nwhat's an acceptable level?\n\n482\n00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:54,233\nYou know, that's hard for me to tell\nyou what the answer is, and hard for\n\n483\n00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:54,795\nme to say.\n\n484\n00:23:54,795 --> 00:23:58,062\nI can give you my personal\nopinion based on my systems and\n\n485\n00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,070\nthe things I find acceptable.\n\n486\n00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,780\nBut that's not necessarily\ngonna be good for Mike, and\n\n487\n00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,370\nit may not very well be good for you.\n\n488\n00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,880\nAnd so, what you have to understand is,\nyou have to work with the business and\n\n489\n00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,150\nidentify the key objectives and\nthe goals the business has, and\n\n490\n00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,290\nthen work backwards and define risk in\nrelation to strategic, or strategy,\n\n491\n00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,480\nstrategic objectives in strategy in the\nbusiness to find that acceptable level.\n\n492\n00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,320\nBecause you may be willing to\nstill run Windows XP in production\n\n493\n00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,420\nbecause of a line of business need after\nthe expiration date of that software and\n\n494\n00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,300\nthe ability not to patch it anymore.\n\n495\n00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,080\nAnd that may be an acceptable\nlevel of risk for you.\n\n496\n00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,600\nBecause you're gonna take mitigation or\n\n497\n00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,200\nminimizing steps, like not hooking\nthat machine up to the Internet.\n\n498\n00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,870\nKeeping it isolated on a VLAN somewhere,\nright?\n\n499\n00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,520\nWhere it cannot get out to the Internet,\nnobody can get to it as a result\n\n500\n00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,530\nwith malware and things that may come down\nthat are created after the last patch\n\n501\n00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,210\nhas been put into production\nis no longer available.\n\n502\n00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,520\nAnd so you may choose,\nyou may take on that risk and accept it.\n\n503\n00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,610\nBut as a result of that you're gonna\ntake mitigation steps in order to\n\n504\n00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,430\nminimize that risk.\n\n505\n00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,750\nAnd that's the acceptable level that\nwe're looking for, whatever that is.\n\n506\n00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,510\nSo risks must be identified\nbefore they occur.\n\n507\n00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,920\nHave to make sure we know\nwhat the risk is out there,\n\n508\n00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,340\nbefore we go out, try to do anything.\n\n509\n00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,710\nNothing worse than having unknown\nrisk suddenly come up and\n\n510\n00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,390\nrear its ugly head in front of us and\nsay, look, I'm here.\n\n511\n00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,920\nAnd we're off over here somewhere\ntrying to do something.\n\n512\n00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,820\nAnd the risk is over here\ntrying to get our attention.\n\n513\n00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,160\nRight.\nThat's not real good.\n\n514\n00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,030\nSo we obviously then have to have\nrisk handling activities, procedures,\n\n515\n00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,340\nprocesses in place in order to\nbe able to address these things.\n\n516\n00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,530\nAnd we have to on a continuous\nbasis across those systems,\n\n517\n00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,700\nacross the life cycle of those products,\n\n518\n00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,240\nacross the architectures that we put in\nplace, constantly be looking for risk.\n\n519\n00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,720\nFerret it out everywhere it lives.\n\n520\n00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,330\nLook under all the dark corners and\nnooks and crannies in our networks and\n\n521\n00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,780\ndon't allow risks to exist in the dark.\n\n522\n00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,260\nIt's better to bring it into\nthe light to understand and\n\n523\n00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:53,330\nidentify it and accept it and mitigate\nit than it is to allow it to exist\n\n524\n00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,625\nsomewhere where we're\nnot comfortable with it.\n\n525\n00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:58,825\nAnd if we put our proverbial head in\nthe sand like the ostrich, right?\n\n526\n00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:03,565\nAnd hope it goes by, we know from prior\nexperience, right, things like Code Red,\n\n527\n00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:06,505\nthings like Nimda, those of you that\nmay have been doing this a while and\n\n528\n00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:08,615\nhave gone through some of these worms or\n\n529\n00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:11,275\nmalware solutions that have\nbeen out there over the years.\n\n530\n00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:13,375\nThe Slammer worm, for instance, on SQL.\n\n531\n00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,690\nWhatever that thing was that bit your\nnetwork and took hold and ran rampant,\n\n532\n00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,830\nand there's thousands of examples of\nthem over the last thirty-some-odd years\n\n533\n00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:27,060\nof the history of these kinds\nof solutions being in the wild.\n\n534\n00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:32,450\nWhatever those things are, if you allowed\nthem to occur because you pretended that\n\n535\n00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,990\nyou were not gonna be vulnerable, then\nobviously you had a very negative outcome.\n\n536\n00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,150\nBecause we saw that those technologies\nthat were used to craft those worms or\n\n537\n00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,480\nthose bots or whatever they may\nbe have become so insidious.\n\n538\n00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,970\nSo difficult to control and to identify\nand understand as a security practitioner,\n\n539\n00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,400\nthat they spread so quickly that they\noften get out in front of us and\n\n540\n00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,520\nwe are left to simply run after them.\n\n541\n00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,830\nAnd proactively we no longer can manage,\nrather reactively we're firefighting and\n\n542\n00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,770\nwe may never actually get in front of it.\n\n543\n00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,340\n>> Right.\n>> There are wellsprings of these\n\n544\n00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,390\ninfections that stay in our networks\neven after we think they're clean and\n\n545\n00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,070\nreinvent themselves and\n\n546\n00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,130\npop back up again because of the way\nin which they are able to morph.\n\n547\n00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,180\n>> Right.\n>> So these\n\n548\n00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,210\npolymorphic viruses that are constantly\nchanging for instance, insidious things.\n\n549\n00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,850\nRoot kits that hide themselves inside\nthe boot sectors of your system.\n\n550\n00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,740\nAnd we think we get rid of them,\n\n551\n00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,185\nonly to find out they pop out\nlater again somewhere else.\n\n552\n00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:22,795\nRight.\nSo\n\n553\n00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:25,985\nthese are the kind of things to\nconsider and to be thinking about.\n\n554\n00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:30,775\nSo if you think about risk, right, think\nabout the fact that we really have to\n\n555\n00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,580\nunderstand all the building blocks,\nthe components that we've said,\n\n556\n00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,750\nthe analysis areas, we wanna understand\nwho the owner of the system is.\n\n557\n00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,800\nThese are just places to think about and\nplaces to plug in and identify.\n\n558\n00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,850\nWho are the owners of the system,\none or more, that we have to address?\n\n559\n00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,340\nBecause if an owner of a system says,\nwell I want it done this way, and\n\n560\n00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,900\nthat opens us up to risk that's a\ndifferent conversation with the business.\n\n561\n00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,810\n>> Right.\n>> Then I don't know anything about risks,\n\n562\n00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,910\nwell I'm so glad you sat me down, Mike,\nto talk to me about this as the owner,\n\n563\n00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,770\nor if you're coming to educate me.\n\n564\n00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,440\n>> Right.\n>> And you tell me,\n\n565\n00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,030\nlook there's this potential liability\nhere, we need to address it.\n\n566\n00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,480\nAs an owner I'm going to be very thankful\nfor that if I'm not aware of it.\n\n567\n00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,090\nBut if I've already made the conscious\ndecision, knowing the risk,\n\n568\n00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,330\nto go ahead and take the opportunity to\neither change or not change, Mike and\n\n569\n00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,150\nI are having a different conversation\nthan we are about him educating me\n\n570\n00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,400\nbecause I don't know about risk.\n\n571\n00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,850\nSo as a security professional, identifying\nyour audience is what I'm getting at,\n\n572\n00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,990\nis really important.\n\n573\n00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,980\nso knowing the owners,\nunderstanding what safeguards may or\n\n574\n00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,430\nmay not be in place as\na result of those discussions.\n\n575\n00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:34,140\nAs a result, safeguards remember could\npotentially minimize vulnerabilities,\n\n576\n00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,460\nwhich then leads to a reduced threat and\nultimately a reduced risk profile.\n\n577\n00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,220\nAnd these are things we wanna be aware of.\n\n578\n00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,340\nSo, understanding owners, right, who can\nmake decisions about implementing or\n\n579\n00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,390\nnot implementing safeguards is important.\n\n580\n00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,980\nThose safeguards can really help\nus to address vulnerabilities and\n\n581\n00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,050\nthreats by minimizing them.\n\n582\n00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:56,530\nThe threat agents, the actors that bring\nthreats into our network can be minimized.\n\n583\n00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,750\nAnd so we want to be aware of that and\nthen that can lead to a reduction in risk\n\n584\n00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,220\ndown to those acceptable\nlevels that we talk about.\n\n585\n00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,930\nAnd as a result, assets, which are\nbasically the things we look to protect,\n\n586\n00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,420\ncan be safeguarded,\ncan be better protected,\n\n587\n00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,350\nif we understand where those\ncontrols have to be put in place,\n\n588\n00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,765\nthose safeguards, and\nthen ultimately what the outcomes are.\n\n589\n00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:15,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n590\n00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,080\n>> And this is about measurement,\nat the end of the day.\n\n591\n00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,240\nAnd we talked a little bit in\none of our prior segments about\n\n592\n00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,840\nquantitative measures, things we\ncan measure that are hard values.\n\n593\n00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,945\nDollars, numbers,\nversus qualitative measures,\n\n594\n00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:31,070\nthings that are a little bit softer,\nharder to put a value on.\n\n595\n00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,884\nHow are you feeling today is a qualitative\nmeasure versus on a scale of\n\n596\n00:29:35,884 --> 00:29:40,370\none to five tell me how you feel\nthis particular solution ranks.\n\n597\n00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,520\nYou know maybe it's three, and\n\n598\n00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,420\nwe understand it's roughly a mean,\nit's kind of in the middle.\n\n599\n00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,715\nSo qualitative and quantitative measures\nare very important when we talk about risk\n\n600\n00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:50,870\ncuz we have to understand\nhow to measure risk.\n\n601\n00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:54,020\nAnd how to qualify the threats and\nthe vulnerabilities and the impact and\n\n602\n00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,430\nexposure we face and\n\n603\n00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,910\nwe tend to do this with quantitative\nassessments more often than not.\n\n604\n00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,700\nSo be thinking about all these things\nas we start thinking about risk, and\n\n605\n00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,290\nunderstand that risk is really\na continuous, risk management,\n\n606\n00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,330\nI should say, is a continuous process.\n\n607\n00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,110\nRight.\nIt's gonna\n\n608\n00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,390\nevolve over time as we understand\nmore about our systems.\n\n609\n00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,410\nBut our systems also become more\ncomplicated over time and so\n\n610\n00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:20,110\nwe're constantly engaging in this battle\nto assess, evaluate, and mitigate risk.\n\n611\n00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,020\nAnd we always have to be looking at it\nas a cyclical, what we call iterative\n\n612\n00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:29,140\nprocess, where literally it is cycling\nthrough one solution after another.\n\n613\n00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,790\nAnd as one iteration, one cycle,\nof the evaluation, the assessment,\n\n614\n00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:38,930\nand the mitigation occurs, we then have\nto take the outcome of that mitigation,\n\n615\n00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,370\nLook at it as applied into the system and\nthen start doing the evaluation and\n\n616\n00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,640\nthe assessment again.\n\n617\n00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,130\nTo see what that impact looks like.\n\n618\n00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,290\nAnd so\nwe're constantly doing one of these.\n\n619\n00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,120\nAnd so just think about that and\nunderstand that as well.\n\n620\n00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,720\nAnd make sure that as we think\nabout risk and risk management,\n\n621\n00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,620\nwe really understand that it's a process,\nand it's not a point in time.\n\n622\n00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,840\nAnd this is a really important idea for\n\n623\n00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,480\nyou as a security practitioner to\ntake away from this segment as we're\n\n624\n00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,340\nstarting to think about how risk comes\ninto play and what it means, right.\n\n625\n00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,710\nIs that it is timely, it is focused on\nthings that have to happen right away.\n\n626\n00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,630\nBut it is also this all\nencompassing thought process.\n\n627\n00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,630\nAnd just like in project management and\nchange management, where we deal with this\n\n628\n00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,990\nidea of a framework that has to apply\nacross the life cycle, risk management has\n\n629\n00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,590\nto be brought in and really be a part\nof all the aspects of security, and\n\n630\n00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,150\nall the aspects of awareness that we\ncreate inside of the organization.\n\n631\n00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,480\nIt's very important when\nwe think about it that way.\n\n632\n00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,160\nSo we want to just make sure\nyou have those thoughts in mind\n\n633\n00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,030\nas we begin to really think about risk.\n\n634\n00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,337\nWhat does risk mean?\nHow we identify it,\n\n635\n00:31:38,337 --> 00:31:42,129\nwhat are some of the standards, like\nthe special publication we talked about,\n\n636\n00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:43,270\nthat may be important.\n\n637\n00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,136\nThere are extra national standards,\nstandards outside the U.S.\n\n638\n00:31:47,136 --> 00:31:48,977\nThat may be of interest as well.\n\n639\n00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:52,992\nLots of countries have defined standards\naround risk management that may or\n\n640\n00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:56,942\nmay not be appropriate, depending on\nthe part of the world you live in, and\n\n641\n00:31:56,942 --> 00:32:00,010\nas a result where you consume and\nfind information.\n\n642\n00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,160\nSo you may want to go out and\ndo a search for some of these.\n\n643\n00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,670\nWe've talked about using Google as\na tool in some of our sessions before,\n\n644\n00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,960\nand that's always a good place to start.\n\n645\n00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,910\nBut there are also professional\nrisk management organizations that\n\n646\n00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,880\nexist out there.\n\n647\n00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,740\nThat can give you guidance.\n\n648\n00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,560\nAnd so you may wanna search out one or\nmore of these.\n\n649\n00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,000\nSee some of the documentation\nbeing produced.\n\n650\n00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,270\nRead up on it a little bit.\n\n651\n00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,780\nGet more familiar with it.\n\n652\n00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,610\nAnd then make sure you feel comfortable\nwith the operational aspects.\n\n653\n00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,420\nThe definition of criteria.\n\n654\n00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,570\nAnd the framework, the thought processes\naround risk and how we manage risk.\n\n655\n00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,130\n>> Very good.\nVery good.\n\n656\n00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,840\nAll right.\nWell Adam,\n\n657\n00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,100\nit looks like we're running out of time\nfor this one, so why don't we take a quick\n\n658\n00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,480\nbreak, let our viewers take a quick break,\nand we'll come back in a few.\n\n659\n00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,310\n>> Absolutely.\n\n660\n00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,965\nSee you guys in a few.\n\n661\n00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:49,180\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n662\n00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,960\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n663\n00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,990\nWe're gonna dive back into our\nRisk Response and Recovery.\n\n664\n00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,340\nAnd I think head back into a little\nmore risk management in particular.\n\n665\n00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:56,850\n>> Absolutely.\n\n666\n00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,490\nSo what we want to do is continue\nour discussions around risk.\n\n667\n00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,420\nIt's gonna be important to\nunderstand where we left off\n\n668\n00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,400\nwith you as we were coming\nout of our last segment.\n\n669\n00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,710\nOr ending our last segment.\n\n670\n00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,010\nWas just the overview of risk.\n\n671\n00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,710\nWe had identified threat vulnerability.\n\n672\n00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,740\nThreat actor.\n\n673\n00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,410\nWe identified the need to assess and\nto monitor.\n\n674\n00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,000\nBut we really wanna bring\nthat all together and\n\n675\n00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,710\ntalk about an overarching process.\n\n676\n00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,070\nAnd what does that risk\nmanagement process look like.\n\n677\n00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,960\nAnd so I know we've outlined a process.\n\n678\n00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,560\nYou know, we wanna make sure that we\ncould share that with all of you.\n\n679\n00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,300\nSo we'll give Mike a second\nto put that up and\n\n680\n00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,220\nmake sure we have that in the notes for\nyou.\n\n681\n00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,128\nBut the idea there on the screen is\nwalking through the logical steps.\n\n682\n00:33:31,128 --> 00:33:35,640\nOf what Risk management as a process\nwould look like in most organizations.\n\n683\n00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,680\nRemember, uniqueness and\nvariances notwithstanding,\n\n684\n00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,250\nyou may not call a certain\nprocess step this exact thing.\n\n685\n00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,280\nBut the nature of the process step is what\nwe're describing in the fact that there is\n\n686\n00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,840\na flow.\n\n687\n00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,240\nA logical cadence to the steps\nthat has to be followed.\n\n688\n00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,840\nThis comes before that.\n\n689\n00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,390\nYou only do this after that.\n\n690\n00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,730\n>> Right.\n>> Is what we wanna make sure that we\n\n691\n00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,030\nimpart here as we talk through this\n>> Okay.\n\n692\n00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,780\n>> Process.\nSo identifying of assets.\n\n693\n00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,630\nWhat are the assets that\nwe're gonna be measuring and\n\n694\n00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,470\nreally wanting to focus on\nwhen we talk about risk.\n\n695\n00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,240\nRemember assets could be anything.\n\n696\n00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,030\nThey could be intellectual property,\n\n697\n00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,800\nthey could be human capital,\nthey could be fixed assets like computers.\n\n698\n00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,370\nWe wanna make sure we're\nfamiliar with them,\n\n699\n00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,850\nand understand what those\nassets are gonna be.\n\n700\n00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,480\nAnd then we classify them.\n\n701\n00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,180\nKind of lumping one and two together\nin terms of identify and classify.\n\n702\n00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,790\nBut the idea is to make\nsure we are focused on\n\n703\n00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,220\nthe appropriate assets that we\nwanna make sure we assess for risk.\n\n704\n00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,970\nAnd by extension, leave the ones off to\nthe side that we don't have to assess.\n\n705\n00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,280\nBecause let's be honest, figuring out\nwhether there's a risk to the coffee maker\n\n706\n00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,880\nmay not be as important to\nthe health of the organization\n\n707\n00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,850\nas it is to understand that the boss's\nlaptop needs to be secure and backed up.\n\n708\n00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:43,930\nSo that when he travels, or\n\n709\n00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:47,570\nshe travels, we don't lose\nthe data that's on that system.\n\n710\n00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,640\nNow if the boss happens to love coffee,\n\n711\n00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,870\nmaybe the coffee maker is\na strategic asset of the company.\n\n712\n00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,030\nBut the reality is, the risk faced\nby that coffee maker is a lot\n\n713\n00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,930\nless than the risk faced by that laptop in\nthe wild, so you wanna prioritize, right?\n\n714\n00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,740\nJust make sure we understand where it is,\nwhat it is and\n\n715\n00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,350\nask the obvious questions around\nit to put it into context, right?\n\n716\n00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,790\nThat's a key operative word we talk\nabout when we talk about security,\n\n717\n00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,120\nis what is the context of\nthis operational information?\n\n718\n00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,380\nSo classify and identify assets,\nvery important.\n\n719\n00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,650\nIdentify rather, I should say,\nand then classify.\n\n720\n00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,890\nKeep that flow correct.\n\n721\n00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,420\nSo then we identify threats and\nvulnerabilities.\n\n722\n00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,920\nHaving understood what the assets\nare we wanna target and\n\n723\n00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,630\nmeasure, we have to then go in and\nlay out for ourselves, in our mind and\n\n724\n00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,320\nthe mind of the business, what\nthe threats and the vulnerabilities are.\n\n725\n00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,420\nThat potentially,\nwe'll underscore that word potentially,\n\n726\n00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,460\nexist to either address those systems.\n\n727\n00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,960\nMeaning that they could\npotentially become infected.\n\n728\n00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,600\nThey could potentially face some sort\nof a threat from a vulnerability.\n\n729\n00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,890\nBut we don't know for sure.\n\n730\n00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,600\nWe want to identify the hit list\nof what could be a problem.\n\n731\n00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,810\nAnd then as a result of\nthat in the next step.\n\n732\n00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,760\nThe next two steps actually determine\nlikelihood and determine impact.\n\n733\n00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,070\nBecause likelihood is important,\nso is impact.\n\n734\n00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,350\nLikelihood helps us to understand\nwhether or not this is something we have\n\n735\n00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,410\nto deal with today, and if so how likely\nis it that something will happen or\n\n736\n00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,430\nperhaps it will happen tomorrow or\nperhaps never, we don't really know.\n\n737\n00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,810\nSo the likelihood is an important\nmeasure of timeliness.\n\n738\n00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,380\nAnd that's what likelihood is about,\ntimeliness.\n\n739\n00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,840\nAnd then impact is about\nthe damage that it can do.\n\n740\n00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,910\nWhether it is financial, whether it is\nto our ability to maintain our business,\n\n741\n00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,420\nand conduct our business.\n\n742\n00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,095\nThere's usually a dollar\nvalue associated with that.\n\n743\n00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:37,425\nBut it could be a qualitative\nmeasure of impact,\n\n744\n00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:39,965\nmeaning it could damage our\nreputation as a business.\n\n745\n00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:43,835\nOur standing in the mind of our customer\nabout our ability to safeguard them and\n\n746\n00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,925\ntheir information and their resources.\n\n747\n00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:50,835\nSo there could be both hard and soft,\nquantitative and qualitative costs and\n\n748\n00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,385\nmeasures associated with impact.\n\n749\n00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:54,600\nWe want to make sure\nwe're familiar with that.\n\n750\n00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,900\nAnd then as a result of determining impact\nand measuring and determining likelihood.\n\n751\n00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,750\nWe want to then determine risk.\n\n752\n00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,790\nSo what is the risk associated\nfrom this likelihood and\n\n753\n00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,480\nthis impact of this threat or\nvulnerability.\n\n754\n00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,670\nHow likely is it in other words and\nhow much impact does it have to occur.\n\n755\n00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,730\nWe then calculate that down into a risk\nand we say the risk of this potential\n\n756\n00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,830\nthing happening whatever the risk is,\nis gonna be based on these assumptions.\n\n757\n00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,560\nAnd then based on determining\nthat risk [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n758\n00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,680\ndetermining that risk,\nas I do my Kermit the Frog impression.\n\n759\n00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,410\nBased on determining that risk,\nwe then wanna recommend controls.\n\n760\n00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,420\nAnd so controls are gonna be things\nthat we're gonna put in place.\n\n761\n00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,110\nThey're gonna help us to better\nunderstand how to deal with this risk.\n\n762\n00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,460\nWhatever those things will be.\n\n763\n00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,390\nAnd we'll talk about mechanisms that\nwe used to deal with risk here in just\n\n764\n00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,470\na couple of minutes.\n\n765\n00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,460\nSo we want to walk through this\nrisk management process and\n\n766\n00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,040\nidentify those key stages,\nthose key areas, that we looked at.\n\n767\n00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,880\nWe only talked about seven key areas as we\nnumber them from identification of assets\n\n768\n00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,340\nand classification of assets to\nidentifying threats and vulnerabilities,\n\n769\n00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,940\ndetermining likelihood impact and\nrisk, and then recommending control.\n\n770\n00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,860\nSo we have a total of seven\nthings we want to focus on here.\n\n771\n00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,580\nMaking sure we understand\nthe order in which they occur and\n\n772\n00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,430\nthe reasons why they\noccur in the way they do.\n\n773\n00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,561\nThis can be measured up against,\nor compared to,\n\n774\n00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:19,329\nthe ideas behind risk assessment that\nare shared with you in the NIST special\n\n775\n00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:24,170\npublication that we've talked about,\nthe 800-30 publication.\n\n776\n00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,940\nThere is a model there for\ndealing with risk and the outputs and\n\n777\n00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,590\ninputs of risk assessment there.\n\n778\n00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,520\nThere's a nine step risk\nassessment activity model or\n\n779\n00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,070\na matrix that NIST lays out.\n\n780\n00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,550\nIt's got a little bit more detail\nthan the seven steps at a high level\n\n781\n00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,815\nwe've laid out here for\nyou and talked about generally.\n\n782\n00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:39,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n783\n00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,750\n>> But\nhaving said that it aligns very well,\n\n784\n00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,810\nand the two are just about\nsimilar in every respect.\n\n785\n00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:48,940\nIt would be important for you to be aware\nof the concepts of risk management.\n\n786\n00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,720\nAs a process, to understand the order\nof priority in which we do things, and\n\n787\n00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,710\nto understand why we do\nthem in a certain way.\n\n788\n00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,360\nAs we look at exam preparations,\ncertainly on the one hand for you.\n\n789\n00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,110\nBut also equally important, in my mind\njust as important if not more so,\n\n790\n00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:07,650\nwhich is the day to day practicing of\nyour art as a security professional\n\n791\n00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,280\nin your enterprise,\nin your business, wherever it is.\n\n792\n00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,130\nYou want to be well armed and\nwell educated about risk and\n\n793\n00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,230\nhow important risk can be to the\nenterprise, in terms of creating success.\n\n794\n00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,650\nAnd really is that defining moment,\nthat dividing line between success and\n\n795\n00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,270\nfailure a lot of the time.\n\n796\n00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,520\nThat risk is going to measure or\nthat we can measure risk as being for us.\n\n797\n00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,470\nIt is that key determining factor,\nin terms of how well we deal with risk.\n\n798\n00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:35,410\nHow well we identify threat\ninvulnerability, impact and exposure.\n\n799\n00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,150\nMeasure and manage those things\nthat is typically the difference\n\n800\n00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,255\nbetween success and\nfailure more often than not.\n\n801\n00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:43,168\nNot only in projects but\njust in the day to day operational\n\n802\n00:39:43,168 --> 00:39:47,246\nmanagement of our networks and our\ninfrastructure whatever those things are.\n\n803\n00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:50,781\nAnd if you've been doing this long\nenough You probably have one or\n\n804\n00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:54,251\nmore of those stories on either\nthe success side

hair to you as well.\n\n820\n00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,110\nBut I have a lot of gray in my beard and\n\n821\n00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,670\non what's left on the hair on my head for\na reason.\n\n822\n00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,250\nAnd that's because I've been doing this\na while and I go back a long way, and\n\n823\n00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,760\nI can remember because I did this and\nI remember seeing it done.\n\n824\n00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,780\nI had a lot of customers that did\nthis that were, at that point,\n\n825\n00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,100\nworking with NT4, having applied or\n\n826\n00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,400\nabout to apply service pack 6\nwhen it was about to come out.\n\n827\n00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,670\n>> Right.\n>> And the problem was,\n\n828\n00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,950\nif you didn't really understand\nwhat service pack six did,\n\n829\n00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,370\nand Microsoft didn't when it was released.\n\n830\n00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,450\nIt blew up your servers and\nbasically rendered them useless.\n\n831\n00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:08,550\nAnd within a couple of days, they realized\nthat and put out a hey, stop, don't do it\n\n832\n00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,040\norder, and had to then retrench and\nultimately rerelease service pack 6 as 6A.\n\n833\n00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,430\n>> Wow.\n>> But this was a huge issue.\n\n834\n00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,590\n>> Lots and lots of people got to\ntest their disaster recovery plans\n\n835\n00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,650\nin real

that\n\n838\n00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,400\napplied that service pack without\ndoing regression testing and\n\n839\n00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,700\nproper testing to assess the risk and\nthe potential threat.\n\n840\n00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,500\nAssociated with a measure uplift,\na measure service pack upgrade,\n\n841\n00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,870\nwith that respect.\n\n842\n00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,280\nAnd blew their systems\nright out of the water.\n\n843\n00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,590\nAnd had to then remediate them.\n\n844\n00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:42,310\nAnd so we all, if we go back far\nenough in our professional careers,\n\n845\n00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,820\nhave examples of this.\n\n846\n00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,620\nAnd we really have to think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n847\n00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,790\nAnd look at it as a lesson\nlearned opportunity, right?\n\n848\n00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:53,250\nSo, what I learned from that event is that\nI don't ever put anything into production.\n\n849\n00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,070\nUnless I test it.\n\n850\n00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,664\n>> Yes.\n>> And I test it on my friend's machines.\n\n851\n00:41:55,664 -->

and\n\n853\n00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,740\nclean up the fact that it may or\nmay not work, right?\n\n854\n00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,180\nBut all kidding aside, you gotta test and\nyou gotta know what you're doing and\n\n855\n00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,500\njust blindly applying the patch is a great\nexample of how not to manage risk and\n\n856\n00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,640\nhow to open yourself up to threat and\nvulnerability.\n\n857\n00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,940\n>> And a lot of people do that right?\n\n858\n00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,520\nI mean they think they're doing the right\nthing by just, hey the update's out there\n\n859\n00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,410\nI gotta go and put it out right now, and\nthey don't think about the consequences,\n\n860\n00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,040\nthey assume it's gonna\nbe a good thing to do.\n\n861\n00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,220\n>> Yeah because we bought into this hype,\nright, that the vendors are so focused on.\n\n862\n00:42:27,220 -->

00:42:36,435\nRight?\nSo that's a whole other conversation.\n\n866\n00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:37,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n867\n00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,700\nthe reality is they're forcing\nus to play

their bad design.\n\n871\n00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,120\nAnd so they're patching stuff.\n\n872\n00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,790\nYou know what, I want to be fair to\nvendors, I'm not trying to harp on\n\n873\n00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,060\nthe fact that they don't do a good job,\nquite the opposite.\n\n874\n00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,310\nThese vendors do a great job.\n\n875\n00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,500\nIf it wasn't for them, let's be honest,\nyou wouldn't be watching this today.\n\n876\n00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,240\nBecause the technology to do this\nkind of stuff wouldn't exist.\n\n877\n00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,970\nSo we all love the fact that\nthe technology is there,\n\n878\n00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,880\nwe love the fact that it works and\nlet's you do great things.\n\n879\n00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,480\nBut the reality is because not every\nvulnerability, not every threat, not every\n\n880\n00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,570\nrisk, can be uncovered in real time or\nwe would never push product out the door.\n\n881\n00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,340\n>> Right.\n>> We'd always be in revision cycle trying\n\n882\n00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,110\nto fix something.\n\n883\n00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,750\n>> Huh.\n>> As a result of that we do have to be\n\n884\n00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,080\nreactive and follow the vendor's advice.\n\n885\n00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,080\nBut we wanna use that strongest of tools\n\n886\n00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,540\nthat most important of tools that\nI've stressed all through out.\n\n887\n00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,990\nAll of the parts of this program.\n\n888\n00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,450\nAnd all the other\nprograms we are doing for\n\n889\n00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,620\nyou on this set of topics, around SSCP.\n\n890\n00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,440\nWhich is the common sense that\nwe often bring to the table.\n\n891\n00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,555\nBut then somehow then forget to\ndeploy at the last possible second.\n\n892\n00:43:35,555 --> 00:43:38,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thomas Payne very famously said that\n\n893\n00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,060\nthe only common thing about common sense,\nis that it's uncommon.\n\n894\n00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,720\nIt doesn't exist in\nthe population at large.\n\n895\n00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,630\nAnd so as a result we've really\ngot to stop and think about it.\n\n896\n00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,070\nThe kind of things we're doing and\nallowing ourselves to be led to do and\n\n897\n00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:54,340\nbe told just because a vendor says hey,\nyou gotta do this to Mike;s point, it\n\n898\n00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,540\ndoesn't mean you go do it without thinking\nabout what it means in your world first.\n\n899\n00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,470\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n900\n00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,710\n>> A very important\npoint that he raises and\n\n901\n00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,570\none that you really need to be focused on\nand make sure that you think about, right?\n\n902\n00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,150\n>> Yeah.\n>> As we talk about risk and\n\n903\n00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,510\nhow to manage risk and change.\n\n904\n00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,990\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So we talked about risk,\n\n905\n00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,340\nwe talked about the idea\nof management of risk.\n\n906\n00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,020\nRight risk process how\ndo we go through that.\n\n907\n00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,710\nI talked to you about this idea of total\nrisk, this idea of measuring risk overall.\n\n908\n00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,040\nThe fact that we can never zero out\nrisk totally we have what's left over\n\n909\n00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,640\nof what we call a residual\nrisk phenomenon.\n\n910\n00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,310\nSo the idea of total risk is this idea of\nmeasuring all the threats, vulnerabilities\n\n911\n00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,770\nassets and the values associated\nwith them, getting it all together.\n\n912\n00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,950\nWeighing it as a system, understanding\nwhat the potential is for risk, and\n\n913\n00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,450\nthen we introduce controls.\n\n914\n00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,960\nSome sort of a control that\nhelps to address risk, and\n\n915\n00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,580\nas a result of that control and\nmaybe overlapping controls more than once\n\n916\n00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,750\nwould reduce risk further in certain areas\nas a cumulative effect, if you will.\n\n917\n00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,100\nWhat's left over at the end is\nwhat we call residual risk.\n\n918\n00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,040\nAnd so total risk minus controls, right?\n\n919\n00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,420\nAnd we'll let Mike finish his thoughts.\n\n920\n00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,900\n>> Okay let's.\n>> I think it was important to say\n\n921\n00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,450\ntotal risk\n>> Total risk.\n\n922\n00:44:59,450 --> 00:44:59,970\n>> Is all, right?\n\n923\n00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,430\nBut total risk minus\ncontrols will then equal,\n\n924\n00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:08,120\nkind of as a formula for you to think\nabout just in your mind, residual risk.\n\n925\n00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,920\nAnd that's what we call\nit at the end of the day.\n\n926\n00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,440\nI think it's E, residual, yeah.\n\n927\n00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,710\nWe both are challenged by spelling\nhere in so we'll do our best.\n\n928\n00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n929\n00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:20,360\nBut residual risk.\n\n930\n00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,810\nSo total risk minus controls\nis gonna equal residual risk.\n\n931\n00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:27,970\nAnd total risk is all of the threats,\nthe vulnerabilities, and\n\n932\n00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:31,870\nall of the assets that they\naddress combined together\n\n933\n00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,870\nas we look to understand and\nprioritize risk and manage risk.\n\n934\n00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,900\nSo all the threats, the vulnerabilities.\n\n935\n00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,300\nAgainst all the assets\nthat are under management.\n\n936\n00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:45,200\nYou know, so the desktops,\nthe laptops, the mobile devices,\n\n937\n00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,250\nthe users by the way, because we have\nhuman capital as well as physical.\n\n938\n00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,420\nMachines and things like that,\n\n939\n00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,190\nintellectual property falls\ninto that category as well.\n\n940\n00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,380\nSo all that stuff, so total risk minus\nthe controls equals the residual risk,\n\n941\n00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,950\nand we'll wanna talk about why that's\nimportant in regards to what is\n\n942\n00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,400\nthe purpose of risk analysis and\nthis helps us to identify risk right?\n\n943\n00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,380\nVery important to know that,\nwe can't really go out and\n\n944\n00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,620\nbe proactive if we don't know what we're\ndoing, we're striking out in the dark\n\n945\n00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,780\nat all these different areas and\nmay or may not be successful.\n\n946\n00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,290\nWe've talked in some of the prior\nprograms about the most important element\n\n947\n00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:21,650\nof being successful at security,\naside form the common sense thing we said,\n\n948\n00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,700\nwhich is that you have to learn\nhow to be consistently good.\n\n949\n00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,430\n>> Right.\n>> As opposed to randomly lucky,\n\n950\n00:46:26,430 -->

00:46:35,820\nthe reason I get a phone call to come\nin and help you figure out technology.\n\n953\n00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,300\nIs that you understand that you're not\ngonna be able to do it yourself, and\n\n954\n00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,360\nthat's great, but the reason I get called\nto fix problems is because you tried it\n\n955\n00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,390\non your own and found out the hard way\nyou didn't know what you were doing.\n\n956\n00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,910\nAnd if you learn from that mistake, then\ngood for you, right, and you'll be better\n\n957\n00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:52,575\nnext time, but job security for me is that\nyou don't learn from that mistake, right?\n\n958\n00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:54,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I continue to make\n\n959\n00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,530\na very good living doing\nthat if you don't.\n\n960\n00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:00,140\nBut I would rather be a little poorer and\nsee you be a little bit better.\n\n961\n00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,760\nAt being consistently knowledgeable,\nquite honestly.\n\n962\n00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,680\nAnd I think any good security\npractitioner will tell you this, right?\n\n963\n00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,390\nWe want to help you to get to the place\nwhere you understand how to manage your\n\n964\n00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,320\ninfrastructure.\n\n965\n00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,040\nManage your knowledge capital.\n\n966\n00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,760\nYour knowledge inventory, and\nthe tools associated with that.\n\n967\n00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,820\nBut you've got to do that by\ngetting smart and staying smart.\n\n968\n00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,740\nAnd that's about being consistent in\nthe application of good documentation,\n\n969\n00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,590\nbest practices, procedures, and policies.\n\n970\n00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,160\nIn your infrastructure.\n\n971\n00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,778\nIf you manage by exception, as opposed\nto managing by documentation, and\n\n972\n00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:35,765\nmanaging through standard and policy,\nyou are never ever gonna be consistent in\n\n973\n00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:40,705\nanything except constantly being reactive\nin your approach to firefighting.\n\n974\n00:47:40,705 --> 00:47:43,673\nThat's the only thing we can\npromise you is gonna work well for\n\n975\n00:47:43,673 --> 00:47:47,270\nyou is that you're always gonna be\nbehind the curve, and never ever get out\n\n976\n00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:50,603\nin front of or ahead of in terms of\nwhat we call proactive management.\n\n977\n00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:55,033\nSo defining your security posture in\nrelation to risk assessment Threat and\n\n978\n00:47:55,033 --> 00:47:56,833\nvulnerability management and\n\n979\n00:47:56,833 --> 00:48:00,860\nrisk identification is crucial to\nyour ability to be able to do this.\n\n980\n00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,920\nSo, we do this through risk analysis and\nrisk assessment.\n\n981\n00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,980\nWe understand that by conducting\nongoing risk assessments,\n\n982\n00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:12,100\nand we'll talk about that in relation\nto business impact analysis as well.\n\n983\n00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,030\nWe have to do both to\nunderstand the prioritized\n\n984\n00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:19,370\nimpact that a specific event can have on\nthe business, business impact analysis.\n\n985\n00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,870\nWe'll see that conversation emerge a\nlittle later in the program we're on BCP,\n\n986\n00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,460\nthis is continuity disaster\nrecovery planning.\n\n987\n00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,470\nBut we also engage in risk analysis and\nrisk assessment to understand the here and\n\n988\n00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,080\nnow, not just the what if\nwhich is what BIA does.\n\n989\n00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,880\nBut the here and now about what\nwe have to address to prevent\n\n990\n00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,920\nthose business impact analysis scenarios\npotentially from coming home to roost.\n\n991\n00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,590\nAnd so we do both,\nwe want to make sure we understand both.\n\n992\n00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:44,540\nBut we're focused on risk assessment\nright now, and understanding that.\n\n993\n00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,040\nSo please be aware of that.\n\n994\n00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,900\nObviously risk assessment has to\ninclude not just current issues, but\n\n995\n00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,040\nemerging threats, right?\n\n996\n00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,230\nWhat are those emerging threats\nthat we see on the horizon?\n\n997\n00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,760\nTalked in some of the other programs\nabout things like cloud technologies,\n\n998\n00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,110\nvirtualization, bring your own device\nto work, manage your own clouds,\n\n999\n00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,680\nthings like that, big data.\n\n1000\n00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,980\nThese are all themes\nthat we've talked about.\n\n1001\n00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,210\nSome or all of these things\npotentially can represent for you and\n\n1002\n00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,210\nyour business emerging threats and\nemerging trends.\n\n1003\n00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,820\nThey could be good, they could be bad,\nthey could be somewhere in the middle or\n\n1004\n00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,840\nwhat's called the continuity, or\n\n1005\n00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,990\nthe continuum rather,\nof the continuity of information security.\n\n1006\n00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,990\nThis timeline that moves kind of between\ntechnologies as we see them emerge.\n\n1007\n00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:27,590\nWe have to look at that timeline and\nthat trajectory of the technology and\n\n1008\n00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,920\ndo a risk assessment on it along the way\nto understand that right now, today,\n\n1009\n00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,820\nif this was five years ago, Apple as\nan enterprise solution, an Apple device,\n\n1010\n00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,900\nin the hand of an information worker,\nwould've been a non-starter.\n\n1011\n00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,870\nWe wouldn't have seen that five years ago.\n\n1012\n00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,810\nBut today,\nit's highly likely that we will not only\n\n1013\n00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,180\nsee Apple devices in the enterprise,\nbut Android devices.\n\n1014\n00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,100\nAnd as a result, what does that mean?\n\n1015\n00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,540\nWhen we have an open source development\nkernel on one side with Android.\n\n1016\n00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,390\nWe have a closed proprietary development\nsolution that nobody really understands in\n\n1017\n00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,973\nthe other, in Apple, probably including\nthe people at Apple in some respect.\n\n1018\n00:50:00,973 --> 00:50:01,615\n>> [LAUGH] I don't know if they do.\n\n1019\n00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:02,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> But the reality\n\n1020\n00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,900\nis it's a great product.\n\n1021\n00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,690\nBoth are.\n\n1022\n00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we know for\n\n1023\n00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,130\na fact there are security holes and\nliabilities and\n\n1024\n00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,740\nrisks in the Apple platform.\n\n1025\n00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,250\nThey're really beginning\nto start to emerge now.\n\n1026\n00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,570\nThey're becoming very popular\non the enterprise side.\n\n1027\n00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:16,310\nWe know for a fact they exist\nin Android because we're seeing\n\n1028\n00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:19,450\nevidence of it with the up tick and\nmalware everywhere we look, and\n\n1029\n00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,490\nattacks on the enterprise\nplatforms that are being exposed.\n\n1030\n00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,000\n>> So as an organization-\n>> So how do we manage those?\n\n1031\n00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,280\n>> As an organization, we got to decide.\n\n1032\n00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,780\nDo we just tell them they can't use them,\nor do we, cuz probably can't do that.\n\n1033\n00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,780\n>> Well, we could but it doesn't always\nwork, because even if we tell them that,\n\n1034\n00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,480\nyou know,\nthey're sneaking them in the back door.\n\n1035\n00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,760\nRight?\n>> Yeah. Yup. >> I mean, so even if now,\n\n1036\n00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,150\nwe talked about this in one of the prior\nepisodes, where we said basically we would\n\n1037\n00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:43,000\ngive them the control over the IT aspects\nof the business, in the sense of what\n\n1038\n00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,980\ntechnologies we will drive collaboration\nand communication through.\n\n1039\n00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,490\nUsed to be the business mandated that IT\nexecuted on that mandate and end users,\n\n1040\n00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,960\ninformation workers basically just\nsat around and used the tools, right?\n\n1041\n00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,250\nThey did great work, but\nthey used the tools we gave them.\n\n1042\n00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,370\nToday it's the exact opposite.\n\n1043\n00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:02,260\nThe information worker is telling\nthe business how we want to be productive.\n\n1044\n00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,070\n>> Right. Right. >> And\nwe've taken unfortunately,\n\n1045\n00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,710\nthe control element away from the company.\n\n1046\n00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,140\n>> Yeah. Yeah. So that makes it even\nmore important to reanalyze and\n\n1047\n00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,220\nconstantly looking at our risk-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1048\n00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,270\n>> And vulnerabilities that we're facing.\n\n1049\n00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,810\n>> Very, very important,\ncuz we're not aware of those, I mean,\n\n1050\n00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,350\nthink about the logic of this, right?\n\n1051\n00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:20,660\nSomebody brings that brand new fangled\ndevice in tomorrow and hooks it up.\n\n1052\n00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,880\nAnd you're not aware it's running on your\nnetwork as a security administrator.\n\n1053\n00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,110\nAnd then all of a sudden your\nvulnerability scanner goes off the charts.\n\n1054\n00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:31,350\nAnd goes wild, your IPS or\nidea starts tagging all these issues\n\n1055\n00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,640\non an unmanaged platform that you're\nnot supposed to have running.\n\n1056\n00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,580\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n1057\n00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:39,140\nHow much time and energy is spent\nin responding to that non event or\n\n1058\n00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,370\npotentially that event.\n\n1059\n00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:43,400\nBecause we don't know that's actually\nbeen brought into the system.\n\n1060\n00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,360\nThis is one of those things that\nemerging threat management and\n\n1061\n00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,460\nemerging threat risk assessment\ncan help us to identify.\n\n1062\n00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,990\nThere should be a policy sround\npeople bringing those devices in.\n\n1063\n00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:55,610\nYou should have user policies\naround onboarding new platforms.\n\n1064\n00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,500\nAnd there must be a process\nto update the management and\n\n1065\n00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,410\nthe infrastructure around\nthe management of those platforms to\n\n1066\n00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,630\nincorporate them into threat matrix and\nthis becomes very important.\n\n1067\n00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,365\nAnd I know we actually have\nan interesting threat matrix graphic\n\n1068\n00:52:06,365 --> 00:52:09,070\nwe're going to take a look at in a couple\nof minutes and we'll put that up.\n\n1069\n00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,205\nAnd I know we have something we're going\nto take a look at as soon as we talk about\n\n1070\n00:52:12,205 --> 00:52:15,655\nhow we actually approach measurement and\nmanagement analysis of risk.\n\n1071\n00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:18,255\nIt's probably a good place to talk\na little bit about quantitative versus\n\n1072\n00:52:18,255 --> 00:52:20,312\nqualitative and how we deal with that.\n\n1073\n00:52:20,312 --> 00:52:22,222\n>> Okay.\n>> And I know we kind of cheated a little\n\n1074\n00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:26,482\nbit and had you frontload our\nindicators for us in our formula.\n\n1075\n00:52:26,482 --> 00:52:28,117\n>> To supplement my mad typing skills.\n\n1076\n00:52:28,117 --> 00:52:29,722\n[LAUGH]\n>> To make sure we get them all down\n\n1077\n00:52:29,722 --> 00:52:31,262\ncorrectly and we spell them accurately.\n\n1078\n00:52:31,262 --> 00:52:32,332\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n1079\n00:52:32,332 --> 00:52:34,982\nSo you know, Mike was kind enough\nto just jot these down as we were\n\n1080\n00:52:34,982 --> 00:52:38,832\ntalking before the program began,\njust so we could define them for you and\n\n1081\n00:52:38,832 --> 00:52:40,032\nmake sure you could see them.\n\n1082\n00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,810\nBut let's walk through them and make\nsure we understand what's on the screen.\n\n1083\n00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:45,960\nSo as we take a look at\nquantitive risk analysis or\n\n1084\n00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,870\nquantitative risk measurement, right?\n\n1085\n00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:52,460\nThis idea of how we measure, put metrics\naround, in this case, risk, we want to\n\n1086\n00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,020\ntalk about risk analysis in both the\nquantitative and qualitative perspective.\n\n1087\n00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,030\nI've mentioned this\na couple of times already.\n\n1088\n00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:02,002\nQuantitive measurements of any kind\nare number based, financial measures,\n\n1089\n00:53:02,002 --> 00:53:02,976\nthings like that.\n\n1090\n00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:05,195\nSo they're what we call hard metrics or\n\n1091\n00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:07,770\nhard measures,\nthat's how we refer to them.\n\n1092\n00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,820\nAnd we use a little formula that has\nthree building blocks on the screen in\n\n1093\n00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,640\nfront of you,\nto represent the quantitative measure,\n\n1094\n00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,540\nthe quantitative measure of\nhow we can approach risk.\n\n1095\n00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,580\nWe have SLE what's\nreferred to as SLE S-L-E.\n\n1096\n00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,870\nWhich is single loss expectancy.\n\n1097\n00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:28,130\nWe have ARO, A-R-O is referred to as ARO,\nannualized rate of occurrence.\n\n1098\n00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,940\nAnd we have ALE,\nannualized loss expectancy.\n\n1099\n00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,720\nThose of you that are home brewers out\nthere will appreciate the ALE reference.\n\n1100\n00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,450\nAnd so, when we put this all together,\n\n1101\n00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:41,020\nwe come up with this formula that is\ngonna be representing the ability for\n\n1102\n00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:44,240\nus to understand quantitative\nrisk analysis in measurement,\n\n1103\n00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,670\nwhich is ALE equals or is made up of\nthe two components of SLE times ARO.\n\n1104\n00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,660\nSo let's take this into\na practical conversation.\n\n1105\n00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,290\nLet's create a what if scenario.\n\n1106\n00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:56,510\nHelp me walk through this in\njust a normal environment.\n\n1107\n00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:00,290\nSo when we think about how to look\nat annualized lost expectancy,\n\n1108\n00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:04,060\nsingle lost expectancy and annualized\nrate of occurrence, let's assume for\n\n1109\n00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,090\na minute that we are looking at having\nto buy some firewalls, you know.\n\n1110\n00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:08,220\n>> Okay.\n>> Typical thing\n\n1111\n00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,020\nat some point in your career as\na practitioner, you're gonna have to do.\n\n1112\n00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,860\nAnd so if we have to go out and\n\n1113\n00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:18,180\nperhaps recommend the purchase of some\nfirewalls to the enterprise, right?\n\n1114\n00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,610\nAnd we're being asked by our boss to\nrecommend which firewalls we may want to\n\n1115\n00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:22,270\ngo out and buy.\n\n1116\n00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,900\nSo you have a purchase of a firewall.\n\n1117\n00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,590\nWe have to first understand what it is\nthat firewall is gonna be asked to do.\n\n1118\n00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:33,280\nYou know, what specific issues is it going\nto address, is it gonna be a software or\n\n1119\n00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,300\nhardware based firewall?\n\n1120\n00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,220\nBecause there's different price points and\ndifferent capabilities in each.\n\n1121\n00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,000\nSo, what is it we want to address?\n\n1122\n00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,850\nAs a result of understand the business\nobjectives, we then can begin to\n\n1123\n00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,220\nidentify the kinds of issues that this\nfirewall will help us to address.\n\n1124\n00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,030\nSo, if we look at,\n\n1125\n00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:55,040\nlet's say this firewall being specifically\ndesigned to really address the fact that\n\n1126\n00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,835\nthree times a year on average as we\nlook over the last several years.\n\n1127\n00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:01,490\n>> Mm-hm\n>> We seem to have a breach in security\n\n1128\n00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:06,350\nthat leads to somebody being able to get\nin and as a result of that, being able to\n\n1129\n00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:11,790\ntake over a file and print server and wipe\nout data that is historical and archived.\n\n1130\n00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,530\nAnd wipe it out at a certain point\nduring the course of the year.\n\n1131\n00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,515\nAnd so roughly three times a year\nthis seems to be happening\n\n1132\n00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:20,430\ncuz we just don't seem to have\nthe right kind of remediation and\n\n1133\n00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,850\nfirewall solutions in place to prevent it.\n\n1134\n00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:27,070\nSo as a result of each of those breaches,\nwe then incur the liability and\n\n1135\n00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:28,880\nthe expense of having to do a restore.\n\n1136\n00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,980\nAnd that is done typically from tape.\n\n1137\n00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,290\nWe have to have the expense of bringing\nthe taped back ups in from off site.\n\n1138\n00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,370\nWe then have to have the added human\ncapital expense of having somebody\n\n1139\n00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,060\non call to do the restore.\n\n1140\n00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,848\nAnd the extra additive position and\nliability of not being able to get into\n\n1141\n00:55:43,848 --> 00:55:47,347\nthe information archive for\nlet's say 24 to 48 hours, right?\n\n1142\n00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,869\nAnd so we would look at\nwhat all of that together,\n\n1143\n00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:53,017\nall that single loss expectancy\naround that one event cost.\n\n1144\n00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:56,436\nAnd let's say we come up with a number and\nwe say it's gonna cost us.\n\n1145\n00:55:56,436 --> 00:56:02,600\nYou know, at the end of the day $5,000,\nwe'll just do some very simple math.\n\n1146\n00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,980\nBecause I don't have that many fingers and\n\n1147\n00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,940\ntoes so\nI'm not gonna be able to count too high.\n\n1148\n00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,890\nSo if we say $5,000,\nUS dollars just to keep it simple,\n\n1149\n00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:13,650\nin case you're watching and you may not\nbe watching it from the US whatever\n\n1150\n00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:18,870\nthe equivalent of a $5,000 investment\nwould be in your local currency.\n\n1151\n00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:22,410\nAnd so\nif $5,000 is a single loss expectancy,\n\n1152\n00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,130\nthen if we say that it is occurring\nthree times a year on average we\n\n1153\n00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,820\nsaid that we think the annualized\nrate of occurrence is three times.\n\n1154\n00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,740\nThen what we would see in this\nexample is that the annualized\n\n1155\n00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:40,190\nloss expectancy, the rate of occurrence,\nwould be three times in this case.\n\n1156\n00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:41,010\nThree times a year.\n\n1157\n00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,290\nSo the annual occurrence\nwould be three times.\n\n1158\n00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:46,880\nSo what we can then see is that if it\noccurs three times over the course\n\n1159\n00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,890\nof a 12 month period at a $5,000\nincremental hit every time,\n\n1160\n00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,322\nwe're looking at a $15,000 liability.\n\n1161\n00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:58,210\nA $15,000 risk that\nthe business faces over\n\n1162\n00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:03,100\nthe course of a year, a projected risk of\n$15,000 over the course of a single year.\n\n1163\n00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,720\nSo then if our boss comes to us and\nsays listen,\n\n1164\n00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,450\nthis is roughly what we're thinking,\nwe need a firewall to address this issue.\n\n1165\n00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,610\nWe would want to be able to\nlook at that firewall and\n\n1166\n00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:16,610\nsay, you know if we spend less than\n$15,000 we're already saving money, right?\n\n1167\n00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:20,890\nBecause if we spend $10,000 to get\nthe firewall, train on it, build it,\n\n1168\n00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:24,040\nput it in, implement it, whatever,\nall those hard and soft costs,\n\n1169\n00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,848\nwe've already saved $5,000.00 in the first\n12 months of the operation of that device.\n\n1170\n00:57:27,848 --> 00:57:34,150\nBecause the $10,000 hard cost against the\n$15,000 loss means we just netted $5,000.\n\n1171\n00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:37,090\nIn year 2 we've netted\n$15,000 additional for\n\n1172\n00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,930\nthe business cuz we've prevented\nfree losses from occurring.\n\n1173\n00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:45,300\nAnd in year three we also netted\n$15,000 we typically say that\n\n1174\n00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,690\na piece of hardware like this may\nhave a three to five year life cycle.\n\n1175\n00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,510\nWe think about that typically.\n\n1176\n00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:54,350\nMost hardware get amortized or\nexpensed out over three to five years.\n\n1177\n00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,500\nAnd so\nif we say this firewall will last for\n\n1178\n00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:02,060\nthree years.we look at the potential for\n$45,000 in\n\n1179\n00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:07,360\nloss over three years based on a $15,000\nper year ail measurement for this risk.\n\n1180\n00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,647\nOver three years $45,000 of\npotential lost business versus\n\n1181\n00:58:11,647 --> 00:58:16,090\na $10,000 up front investment\nto mitigate that risk, right.\n\n1182\n00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:19,970\nWe are effectively saving the business\n$35,000 over three years by\n\n1183\n00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,910\nimplementing this solution.\n\n1184\n00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:27,170\nHowever, if we chose a $20,000 firewall,\nright, we would not realize\n\n1185\n00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,240\nthe savings on that investment over\nthree years if you think about it.\n\n1186\n00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:35,750\nBecause it's $20,000,\nit's $15,000 lost per year, $45,000 total.\n\n1187\n00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:40,050\nSo it would take us two years, or a year\nand a half approximately, right into\n\n1188\n00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,300\nthe second year, to realize that risk\ninstead of prior to the first year.\n\n1189\n00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,560\nSo we can look at that sliding scale and\nsay, well, I'll spend ten to save 45.\n\n1190\n00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,320\nHow about if we have to spend 60?\n\n1191\n00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,110\nNow all of a sudden, we're spending more.\n\n1192\n00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,950\n>> Yeah.\n>> Than the risk is over three years and\n\n1193\n00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,080\nwe may say, you know what?\n\n1194\n00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,740\nIn three years, we want to accept that\n$45,000 risk because that's going\n\n1195\n00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,730\nto cost us 60,000 to fix it.\n\n1196\n00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,110\n>> Right.\n>> And we're not going to have that\n\n1197\n00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,450\ninformation for another four years.\n\n1198\n00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,650\nIn three years,\nwe don't have to keep it around anymore.\n\n1199\n00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,680\nIt's actually cheaper for us to let\nyou break in three times a year and\n\n1200\n00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,160\nhave to restore the darn thing,\n\n1201\n00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,140\nthen it is to fix it with $60,000\nupfront to buy the solution.\n\n1202\n00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,380\nSo this is why we got to measure it.\n\n1203\n00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,780\nBecause this is why we have to\nunderstand what the impact is.\n\n1204\n00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,250\nSo this value, right, is really\nimportant to us, we derive this value.\n\n1205\n00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:27,110\nAnd the ALE equals three times that our\nformula helps us to understand this and\n\n1206\n00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,090\nto really manage through this discussion.\n\n1207\n00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:33,845\nSo, quantitative measure of risk, risk\nanalysis, we need to know this formula.\n\n1208\n00:59:33,845 --> 00:59:37,725\nYou may have to apply this formula in\nyour practice in the real world, right,\n\n1209\n00:59:37,725 --> 00:59:41,435\nbe asked to do this analysis that we\njust walked through a scenario with you.\n\n1210\n00:59:41,435 --> 00:59:44,055\nYou may be asked about this\nwhen you're going through and\n\n1211\n00:59:44,055 --> 00:59:45,915\nanswering questions at\nsome point in the future.\n\n1212\n00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,405\n>> Yes.\n>> So want to make sure you understand\n\n1213\n00:59:47,405 --> 00:59:49,057\nthe formula and how it works.\n\n1214\n00:59:49,057 --> 00:59:52,547\nNow again, those of you out there that may\nnever have done this exercise, Mike and\n\n1215\n00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,377\nI just quickly documented\na quick scenario for you.\n\n1216\n00:59:55,377 --> 00:59:56,687\nYou know, come up with your own, right?\n\n1217\n00:59:56,687 --> 00:59:58,337\nIt doesn't have to be a firewall and\na breach.\n\n1218\n00:59:58,337 --> 00:59:59,687\nIt could be anything, right?\n\n1219\n00:59:59,687 --> 01:00:02,717\nBut the point is, understand how\nto apply the terminology and\n\n1220\n01:00:02,717 --> 01:00:04,747\nthe three variables to\ncome up with the solution.\n\n1221\n01:00:04,747 --> 01:00:06,477\nThat's really what's important.\n\n1222\n01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:10,130\nSo when we talk about qualitative\nmeasures, we talk about soft measures.\n\n1223\n01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:14,510\nReputation is a good example of a\nqualitative versus a quantitative measure.\n\n1224\n01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,290\nTypically these are scenario\nbased measurements.\n\n1225\n01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:21,710\nSo if we had this happen,\nwhat would the impact be?\n\n1226\n01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,500\nIt's very subjective.\n\n1227\n01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,490\nMore like how happy are you today?\n\n1228\n01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,150\nHow do you feel today?\n\n1229\n01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:31,985\nMore than it's $20,000 to fix the problem\nboss, do you want to write a check?\n\n1230\n01:00:31,985 --> 01:00:34,300\nThat's a quantitative measure.\nMake sure we use and understand both.\n\n1231\n01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,610\nAlso understand in the real world,\noutside of our discussions here but\n\n1232\n01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,680\nin your enterprises and\n\n1233\n01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,280\nyour businesses that there tends to be\na blend of both these solutions, a hybrid.\n\n1234\n01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,160\n>> Right.\n>> Where some things are measured,\n\n1235\n01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,080\ncustomer service and\n\n1236\n01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:50,200\ncustomer satisfaction metrics typically\ncan be more qualitative in measure.\n\n1237\n01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,060\nHow happy was that customer.\n\n1238\n01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,340\nVersus hard metrics around uptime.\n\n1239\n01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,880\nSo 4-9,\n5-9 uptime is a quantitative measure.\n\n1240\n01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,790\nAnd so we wanna make sure we see\nthat there's a blend in both.\n\n1241\n01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:05,350\nAnd just be familiar with and\nbe comfortable with that.\n\n1242\n01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,800\nHaving said that,\nwe've categorized our risks,\n\n1243\n01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,060\nlet's take a look at how we\nactually lay out in a matrix.\n\n1244\n01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:13,210\nThis is the thing I was just talking\nabout that we said we'd throw up for you.\n\n1245\n01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:17,250\nHow we lay out the concept of probability,\nimpact and exposure and risk, and\n\n1246\n01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,700\ndo what's called a threat level matrix,\nor a pie matrix here.\n\n1247\n01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,270\nAnd so we often see something like this.\n\n1248\n01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:26,970\nAnd again, this may not be the exact\nway you define it in your world today.\n\n1249\n01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:30,740\nBut typically this generic model,\nalmost like a Rubik's cube,\n\n1250\n01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,600\nis gonna be how we see risk.\n\n1251\n01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,570\nYou may see the medium area as yellow,\nby the way, as opposed to orange,\n\n1252\n01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:39,980\nwhen they see green, red, yellow,\ntypical KPI indicator colors.\n\n1253\n01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,470\nBut the idea is on the left hand side\nwe see probability going from low,\n\n1254\n01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,580\nmedium, to high.\n\n1255\n01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:49,070\nOn the lower right hand side trailing off,\nwe see low, medium, high for impact.\n\n1256\n01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:53,520\nAnd then as we measure the X-Y axis here\nand the intersection of these two data\n\n1257\n01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,650\npoints, we see a nine tier, or a nine\nsquare matrix, that is developed, right?\n\n1258\n01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,530\n>> Right\n>> Low, low at\n\n1259\n01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:03,120\nthe lower left hand side of the impact\nof or the intersection of impact and\n\n1260\n01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,690\nprobability, meaning a low\nprobability event with low impact.\n\n1261\n01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,420\nMay not be something we choose to take\non or really do much with, right?\n\n1262\n01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,670\n>> Right.\n>> The likelihood that somebody's gonna\n\n1263\n01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:14,400\neffect negatively our\nbusiness as a result of this\n\n1264\n01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,540\nmay not really be all\nthat important to us.\n\n1265\n01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:20,590\nBut as we move up and\nout towards medium and then high and\n\n1266\n01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,230\nover towards medium and high.\n\n1267\n01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:26,380\nWhat we see ultimately in the upper\nright hand area of the matrix is\n\n1268\n01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,960\nwhat's labeled as critical or high impact,\n\n1269\n01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,360\nhigh probability of happening\nat high impact, high exposure.\n\n1270\n01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,810\nThose are the events that\nwe have to categorize and\n\n1271\n01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:38,080\nreally prioritize the focus on first.\n\n1272\n01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,820\nAnd really take remediation and\n\n1273\n01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,860\nhopefully preventive action\naround if at all possible.\n\n1274\n01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:46,950\nAnd understand also when we deal with\nthreat level In threat level assessment\n\n1275\n01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:50,650\nhere, that this is not only a sliding\nscale, it's a dynamic measure.\n\n1276\n01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:52,550\nBecause something that is\nlow in probability and\n\n1277\n01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:56,500\nimpact today can quickly change\nto become critical tomorrow.\n\n1278\n01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,190\nIf we uncover the fact\nthat now all of a sudden\n\n1279\n01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,490\nthis is either the probability has\nchanged that it will impact us or\n\n1280\n01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:05,050\nthe impact has changed is\nto what the impact will be.\n\n1281\n01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:10,120\nBut things go from low, to medium,\nto high all the time on skills like this.\n\n1282\n01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,770\nSo, we have to be aware of that, right?\n\n1283\n01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:15,440\nAnd so,\nif you are that security professional\n\n1284\n01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,885\nthat is gonna be handling this\nkind of a threat level assessment.\n\n1285\n01:03:18,885 --> 01:03:21,805\nYou have to be really keeping up the date\non all the things that have been going on\n\n1286\n01:03:21,805 --> 01:03:24,645\nin technology, in sectors that effect you.\n\n1287\n01:03:24,645 --> 01:03:26,875\nAnd in events that are far flung\naround the world that may or\n\n1288\n01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:28,745\nmay not have anything to\ndo with your business.\n\n1289\n01:03:28,745 --> 01:03:30,367\n>> Right.\n>> What's going on, for instance,\n\n1290\n01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:34,777\nin areas like the Middle East with\nregards to unrest and political turmoil,\n\n1291\n01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,447\nmay impact your business months\ndown the road with regard for\n\n1292\n01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:39,227\nthe price of raw materials and energy.\n\n1293\n01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:39,867\n>> Right.\n>> But you may or\n\n1294\n01:03:39,867 --> 01:03:43,163\nmay not see that happening and\nunderstand that and make that connection.\n\n1295\n01:03:43,163 --> 01:03:44,401\nYou may not even be able to do\nanything about it by the way.\n\n1296\n01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:48,716\nSo it's not as if you're gonna change that\nbut positioning a business to understand\n\n1297\n01:03:48,716 --> 01:03:52,422\nthat the budget for energy, the budget for\nrunning the data center, for\n\n1298\n01:03:52,422 --> 01:03:55,608\nkeeping those machines on,\nwhatever, may now have to go up.\n\n1299\n01:03:55,608 --> 01:03:58,873\nIs something that at least as\nan educated professional, you can have\n\n1300\n01:03:58,873 --> 01:04:02,960\nthe conversation about to be proactive\nas opposed to being blindsided by it.\n\n1301\n01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,620\nAnd so that's what this threat level\nassessment really helps us to understand.\n\n1302\n01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:10,290\nAnd it's something that I would tell you\nand really challenge you to think about.\n\n1303\n01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:13,360\nIn regards to understanding\nhow to use this tool.\n\n1304\n01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,840\nIt's very, very important.\n\n1305\n01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,660\nAnd as we talk about that, the last\nthing I wanna bring up and really talk\n\n1306\n01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,900\nabout in this area as we get ready to\nclose out this part of our conversation.\n\n1307\n01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:25,730\nAnd this segment of the show is really how\nwe deal with risk mitigation strategies,\n\n1308\n01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:29,510\nwhich really effectively comes out of this\nconversation about low, medium, high, and\n\n1309\n01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,650\ncritical priority.\n\n1310\n01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:32,670\nAnd what we're gonna take on and\nhow we're gonna do it.\n\n1311\n01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,470\nSo when we talk about the risk\nmitigation strategies, there are four\n\n1312\n01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:40,360\nacceptable ways to deal with risk,\nand I wanna talk about what they are.\n\n1313\n01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,150\nThis is a project management,\nchange management philosophy thing.\n\n1314\n01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:46,850\nThis is not just\nan information security thing.\n\n1315\n01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,760\nYou talk to project managers.\n\n1316\n01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,485\nYou talk to change managers.\n\n1317\n01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:52,880\nThey're gonna have a very similar\ntalk track about risk and\n\n1318\n01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,120\nhow they deal with risk\nin their organizations.\n\n1319\n01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:58,470\nBut we wanna make sure you as\nprofessionals are educated about this and\n\n1320\n01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,160\nunderstand this.\n\n1321\n01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,675\nSo the risk management principles around\nrisk are really gonna be important for\n\n1322\n01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:03,570\nyou to understand.\n\n1323\n01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,140\nSo let's talk about what they are quickly.\n\n1324\n01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,030\nAnd we'll make sure we have\nthe opportunity to capture them for you.\n\n1325\n01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:08,960\nAnd make sure you know what they are.\n\n1326\n01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,393\nSo these are risk mitigation or\nRisk Management and\n\n1327\n01:05:11,393 --> 01:05:13,040\nmitigation strategies, right?\n\n1328\n01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,460\nOr Principles,\nyou can call them Principles, too.\n\n1329\n01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,553\nThat's fine.\nEither way.\n\n1330\n01:05:15,553 --> 01:05:18,090\n[COUGH] So let's talk about what they are.\n\n1331\n01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:20,090\nThe first one is Risk reduction.\n\n1332\n01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:23,520\nThis will be a mitigation of risk.\n\n1333\n01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,570\nYou want to think about, Risk reduction\nis also typically called risk mitigation.\n\n1334\n01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:30,180\nIt's the same exact concept, it's just\nthat often times people don't know\n\n1335\n01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:34,110\nnecessarily what the word mitigation is,\nso we refer to it as risk reduction.\n\n1336\n01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:39,720\nWe then can have transference of risk or\nrisk transference so transferring\n\n1337\n01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,350\nthe risk to somebody else is gonna be\nanother accepted way of managing risk.\n\n1338\n01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:47,810\nRisk acceptance, acceptance of risk.\n\n1339\n01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:51,250\nAnd then finally, risk avoidance.\n\n1340\n01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,320\nAnd we'll give you a practical\nexample of these four and\n\n1341\n01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,090\nhow they come together here as well.\n\n1342\n01:05:56,090 --> 01:06:00,980\nI'm going to use the Florida example,\nwhich is storms and storm seasons,\n\n1343\n01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,010\nsince we get a lot of those\nnot only on the east coast,\n\n1344\n01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:06,450\nbut especially here on the southern\neastern part of the United States.\n\n1345\n01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:07,810\n>> Yeah.\n>> Down here in Florida.\n\n1346\n01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:10,665\nAnd so when we get into hurricane season,\n\n1347\n01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:15,515\nroughly from June 1st out through, these\ndays probably late November, December.\n\n1348\n01:06:15,515 --> 01:06:16,635\n>> It seems to be getting longer and\nlonger.\n\n1349\n01:06:16,635 --> 01:06:18,045\n>> This year it seems to\nbe getting longer right?\n\n1350\n01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:21,795\nSo when we get into hurricane season and\ntropical weather season here in Florida,\n\n1351\n01:06:21,795 --> 01:06:25,345\nwe see these four things come into bear\nin the forefront very very formally and\n\n1352\n01:06:25,345 --> 01:06:26,925\nlet's talk about how they work.\n\n1353\n01:06:26,925 --> 01:06:31,790\nSo Risk reduction and risk mitigation\nis this idea of going out and reducing\n\n1354\n01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:35,310\nall the things that can lead to the risks\nin our environment, if at all possible.\n\n1355\n01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:38,750\nSo when we deal with things like storms,\nwe deal with taking in\n\n1356\n01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:42,170\nall the things in our yards that can blow\naround, right, that may cause damage.\n\n1357\n01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,400\nWe deal with putting up storm shutters.\n\n1358\n01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,290\nWe deal with making sure we have\nbottled water, we gas up the car,\n\n1359\n01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:49,980\nget the batteries, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1360\n01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,980\nBecause we want to make sure we're being\nas proactive as we can about minimizing\n\n1361\n01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,000\nthe factors that can impact us negatively,\n\n1362\n01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,790\nand that's what risk\nminimization is all about.\n\n1363\n01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,540\nWe'll begin with risk transference.\n\n1364\n01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:04,390\nThe classic example there\nis buying insurance.\n\n1365\n01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:08,230\nAnd so we give somebody else the risk or\nliability of managing\n\n1366\n01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:11,480\nthe damage to our house, or\nthe damage to our car, whatever it is.\n\n1367\n01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,820\nIn exchange for our money.\n\n1368\n01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,900\nAnd so that's usually a good\nway of dealing with it.\n\n1369\n01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,220\nSo we think about that.\n\n1370\n01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,220\nIn the IT world,\nwe have risk insurance, and\n\n1371\n01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,890\nwe have the ability to transfer\nliability and liability.\n\n1372\n01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:22,300\nWe have business insurance.\n\n1373\n01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,940\nWe have insurance interruption insurance.\n\n1374\n01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,390\nBusiness interruption insurance.\n\n1375\n01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:26,890\nSo we have these ideas as well.\n\n1376\n01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,940\nAnd we see them in IT all the time.\n\n1377\n01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:31,630\nWhere we deal with Risk acceptance\nin the hurricane example,\n\n1378\n01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,121\nthat would be getting drunk and\nhaving a hurricane party, right?\n\n1379\n01:07:34,121 --> 01:07:35,248\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You celebrate the fact it's coming,\n\n1380\n01:07:35,248 --> 01:07:35,970\nwe don't really have a choice.\n\n1381\n01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:36,635\n>> Nothing we can do it about it.\n\n1382\n01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,325\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Right,\n\n1383\n01:07:37,325 --> 01:07:40,530\nso you might as well just enjoy it,\nmaybe go surfing, something like that.\n\n1384\n01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,160\nDon't want to go surfing\nby the way in a hurricane.\n\n1385\n01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,010\nWanted to be clear about that.\n\n1386\n01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:43,812\n>> Not a good idea.\n\n1387\n01:07:43,812 --> 01:07:44,465\n[LAUGH]\n>> Bad idea.\n\n1388\n01:07:44,465 --> 01:07:48,860\nBut when we talk about IT and we talk\nabout acceptance, we were talking about\n\n1389\n01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:52,030\ndeciding that certain systems\nare going to be available to us and\n\n1390\n01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:52,610\nwe're going to run them,\n\n1391\n01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:56,050\neven though there's a risk associated with\nthem, because we know that we need them.\n\n1392\n01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:57,880\nAnd so, we're going to use mitigation and\n\n1393\n01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,720\ntransference of risk as much as possible,\nbut\n\n1394\n01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,850\nwe're still gonna ultimately accept the\nresidual risk and run the systems anyway.\n\n1395\n01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:07,080\nSo that's what we're talking about\nwhen we talk about Risk acceptance.\n\n1396\n01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,930\n>> We're gonna do that because\nit's gonna cost us too much money,\n\n1397\n01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:13,340\nbecause we looked at our formula back\nthere when we decided to accept a risk.\n\n1398\n01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:13,960\n>> Absolutely.\nSo\n\n1399\n01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,570\nthat's one of the key reasons we do it,\nand\n\n1400\n01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:20,640\nthere could be the inability to somehow\nminimize this risk to an acceptable level,\n\n1401\n01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,540\nbecause of dollar values,\nas Mike points out, very important.\n\n1402\n01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,280\nBut there could also be an overarching\nfactor here, which is the business may\n\n1403\n01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:31,800\nneed this system to run regardless of\nthe expense of having to maintain it.\n\n1404\n01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,290\nBecause it's just an old legacy system,\nwe see this a lot in IT.\n\n1405\n01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:39,250\nWhere the box in the corner,\nthe black box, nobody wants to get nearer.\n\n1406\n01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,880\nSo the magical force field around it.\n\n1407\n01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,250\nIf you don't violate the force field,\nthe box keeps running.\n\n1408\n01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,620\nSo as long as we don't touch it,\nwe're fine.\n\n1409\n01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,200\n>> Right.\n\n1410\n01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,540\n>> We have to just accept that risk.\n\n1411\n01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,640\nAnd we're going to have to\nunfortunately run it regardless.\n\n1412\n01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,300\nSo that's one of those issues.\n\n1413\n01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,420\nAnd then Risk avoidance, the last area.\n\n1414\n01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,760\nThis is where we get in the car\nin the storm example, and\n\n1415\n01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,030\ndrive out of the way of the storm.\n\n1416\n01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:57,590\nFly away, whatever it is.\n\n1417\n01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,250\nSo if the storm is coming in Miami,\nwe go up to Gainesville and\n\n1418\n01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,440\ntry to get out of the way.\n\n1419\n01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,700\nOr whatever that may be.\n\n1420\n01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,420\nBut if we're talking about IT,\nwe talk about Risk avoidance.\n\n1421\n01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,160\nIt may be deciding not to run\nthat system until we have\n\n1422\n01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,540\na full understanding of its impact.\n\n1423\n01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:12,750\nSo maybe we don't migrate to Windows 8 or\n8.1\n\n1424\n01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:16,250\nuntil we really understand the impact that\nit can have from a security perspective.\n\n1425\n01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,890\nMaybe we stay on Windows 7.\n\n1426\n01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:20,756\nSo that's Risk avoidance in the IT\nworld when we talk about that.\n\n1427\n01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:25,550\nAnd so understanding that, making sure\nthat we're comfortable with that and\n\n1428\n01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:28,260\nthat we really understand\nthose four methodologies,\n\n1429\n01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,750\nthose management principles,\nand how to deal with them,\n\n1430\n01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,550\nis also going to be very important\nwhen we talk about Risk management.\n\n1431\n01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:38,920\nWe talked about these four acceptable ways\nin order to frame the discussion of risk,\n\n1432\n01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,940\nand to then implement the various\ncoping strategies that help us to\n\n1433\n01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,980\nget through risk and\nreally kind of address it as a result.\n\n1434\n01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:49,580\nSo we wanna make sure we understand that\nthere are gonna be times when no matter\n\n1435\n01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,760\nwhat we do, we'll have risk associated\nwith the business at all times.\n\n1436\n01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,940\nBut we do wanna understand that that\nresidual risk, the term we use,\n\n1437\n01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:59,700\nis acceptable to us, provided we document\nit and we manage it accordingly.\n\n1438\n01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,800\n>> Very good.\n>> All right, very good.\n\n1439\n01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,480\nAll right, so I think we're just about\ndone with our risk conversation.\n\n1440\n01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,020\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n1441\n01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,330\nThis will be a good time to take a break.\n\n1442\n01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,770\nSo we'll stop for few,\nand we'll be back soon.\n\n1443\n01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:08,550\n>> See you all in a few.\n\n1444\n01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:17,240\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1445\n01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,140\nWe're going to dive back in to our Risk,\nResponse, and Recovery.\n\n1446\n01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,840\nAnd we're going to be\nheading into Countermeasures.\n\n1447\n01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,770\n>> We'll finish up, just kind of,\ntake that thread forward from risk that\n\n1448\n01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:28,500\nwe were just talking about\nin our last episode and\n\n1449\n01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,780\nmove over to just the icing on the cake,\nif you will, around risk.\n\n1450\n01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:34,110\nWhich is this idea of Countermeasures.\n\n1451\n01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:37,880\nWe spend a lot of time defining risk and\nhow we measure it, what it is,\n\n1452\n01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,560\nunderstanding threats and vulnerabilities.\n\n1453\n01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,710\nBut the idea of addressing risk, now that\nwe understand the four ways to do so,\n\n1454\n01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,190\nis really to talk about Countermeasures.\n\n1455\n01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:48,000\nThe practical application of how\nwe address a risk is through\n\n1456\n01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,010\na countermeasure to a threat or\nvulnerability.\n\n1457\n01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,140\nIt's also through a Countermeasure.\n\n1458\n01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:55,240\nSo any activity, any process,\nany procedure, technique whatever,\n\n1459\n01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:59,860\nthat we will engage in, excuse me,\nthat ultimately will allow us to basically\n\n1460\n01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:04,280\nminimize an asset risk, risk to an asset,\nis gonna be a Countermeasure.\n\n1461\n01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:08,560\nAnd so we typically see these\nassociated with policies, we implement\n\n1462\n01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,180\nthe Countermeasure in other words, through\na procedure, a process and or a policy.\n\n1463\n01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,650\nAnd we have some sort of\ntangible mechanism, right?\n\n1464\n01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:18,660\nA technology we bring to bear,\na patch we apply, something like that.\n\n1465\n01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:21,250\nAnd then there's typically some\nsort of physical security measures\n\n1466\n01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,300\nthat may also be associated with this.\n\n1467\n01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,885\nSo any or all of these areas are going\nto be part of what we talk about with\n\n1468\n01:11:25,885 --> 01:11:26,810\nCountermeasures.\n\n1469\n01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:29,890\nSo we have policies, we have mechanisms.\n\n1470\n01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,360\nMechanisms could just be technology,\nright?\n\n1471\n01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,090\nKeep it simple.\n\n1472\n01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,428\nAnd we have typically physical\nsecurity measures that may be part of\n\n1473\n01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:39,020\nCountermeasures as well.\n\n1474\n01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,930\nWe may tell people to change the way\nthey interact with the system,\n\n1475\n01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,580\nas a result of implementing\ncountermeasuring.\n\n1476\n01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,860\nThat could be a physical\nsecurity solution.\n\n1477\n01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,560\nAnd we may also have a procedure or\n\n1478\n01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,977\na process that has to change in\norder to do something differently.\n\n1479\n01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:54,504\nSo those are typically the kind of\nCountermeasures that we often see and\n\n1480\n01:11:54,504 --> 01:11:55,342\nwe think about.\n\n1481\n01:11:55,342 --> 01:11:58,729\nCountermeasures need to be Critical and\nit needs obviously to be,\n\n1482\n01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:01,994\nwe need to be sensitive to them and\nunderstand what they are, and\n\n1483\n01:12:01,994 --> 01:12:05,150\nwe need to make sure they match\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n1484\n01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,930\nBut they also have to be cost effective,\nright?\n\n1485\n01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:08,200\nAnd when I say critical,\n\n1486\n01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,750\nwhat I mean is that a lot of these\nare going to be necessary but\n\n1487\n01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,150\nthen we have to priority rank them and\nunderstand really what's needed and\n\n1488\n01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:20,030\nwhat is nice to have versus what is needed\nand would be a must have in that respect,\n\n1489\n01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:23,640\nand as a result, we then look at cost\neffectiveness, and we look at criticality.\n\n1490\n01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,030\nSo, just be aware of that and\nunderstand that.\n\n1491\n01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:30,310\nA lot of times countermeasures may come in\nthe form of software patches from vendors.\n\n1492\n01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:33,440\nAnd so we may be thinking about\napplying the software patch\n\n1493\n01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,010\nas applying the countermeasure.\n\n1494\n01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,250\nAs opposed to making a change or\nsomething like that.\n\n1495\n01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,400\nWe could disconnect or rewire networks,\ncreate VLANs, things like that,\n\n1496\n01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,690\nto modify and change infrastructure.\n\n1497\n01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:46,180\nWe could use encryption and\napply encryption as a countermeasure to\n\n1498\n01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:48,740\nprevent snooping on the wire,\nthings like that.\n\n1499\n01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:54,870\nWe may monitor for\nthe hooking up of unlicensed or\n\n1500\n01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,190\nunknown systems,\nmaybe MAC address monitoring.\n\n1501\n01:12:57,190 --> 01:12:59,760\nAcross our switches or\nour routers to understand, or\n\n1502\n01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,680\nrather our switches and our ports\non our strike plates to understand\n\n1503\n01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,670\nthat when we plug in a device that isn't\non an acceptable usage list on that VLAN,\n\n1504\n01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:10,352\nit pops up on our threat\nmanagement software dashboard.\n\n1505\n01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:13,750\nAnd it says, hey, you have an unknown\nnode that's operating on the system.\n\n1506\n01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:14,610\nSay we went wireless,\n\n1507\n01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:17,740\nso all these things can be countermeasures\nthat we may wanna choose to implement.\n\n1508\n01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,450\nJust think about that, right?\n\n1509\n01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:22,580\nAnd obviously countermeasures have\nto be measured against they're\n\n1510\n01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:25,670\ndesigned to deal with and\nif the risk is no longer a factor,\n\n1511\n01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:27,620\nthen maybe a countermeasure\nis no longer needed.\n\n1512\n01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:30,540\nAnd we have to make sure\nthe countermeasures are timely.\n\n1513\n01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,960\nAnd that they are appropriate to\nthe risks that are being involved and\n\n1514\n01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,910\nso, being evolving rather,\nI should say in our networks,\n\n1515\n01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:40,720\nand so we just wanna make sure we keep\nthe countermeasures as focused on\n\n1516\n01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:45,060\nthe risks as we are on the risks\nthemselves as we manage them.\n\n1517\n01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:48,780\nSo just being aware of that and\nunderstanding that also, very important.\n\n1518\n01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,140\nWe also want to spend a little\ntime as we talk about risk and\n\n1519\n01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:54,390\nwe talk about countermeasures and\nkinda wrap up that whole thought process\n\n1520\n01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,390\nof really thinking about\nsecurity assessments and\n\n1521\n01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,800\nunderstanding where we stand and how we\nidentify some of these risks is really\n\n1522\n01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,940\nvery much about security assessment and\nthe activities involved with them.\n\n1523\n01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,750\nWe're gonna detail some of the steps\nlater on in our discussion about\n\n1524\n01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:07,550\nincident handling.\n\n1525\n01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:11,030\nWe're gonna come to that in a few minutes,\nbut security assessments are important,\n\n1526\n01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:17,220\nbecause they often times are gonna give us\nthe indicators of the 50,000 foot level,\n\n1527\n01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,690\nthe strategic level of what's going on\nin our network, as well as the tactical,\n\n1528\n01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:25,792\nthe very specific operational details\nof what is happening in our networks.\n\n1529\n01:14:25,792 --> 01:14:29,260\nIf they're done the right way\nthey're going to be able to address\n\n1530\n01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,740\nall of the different components,\nthe building blocks,\n\n1531\n01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:35,500\nthe strategic, the operational, and\nthe tactical elements of our networks.\n\n1532\n01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:39,190\nThese are the three areas that we tend\nto focus on when we do assessments.\n\n1533\n01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:42,490\nThe strategic vision is\nthe business objectives, the goals,\n\n1534\n01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:46,350\nthe things that we're trying to\naccomplish by deploying technologies and\n\n1535\n01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:49,080\nmaybe choosing certain\ntechnologies leads us open or\n\n1536\n01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,570\nleaves us open to certain risks and\nvulnerabilities, we want to know that.\n\n1537\n01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:56,370\nThen there's the operational as well as\nthe tactical levels that we addressed.\n\n1538\n01:14:56,370 --> 01:15:01,230\nOperational is gonna be the day to day\noperational detail of how we run a system.\n\n1539\n01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:04,110\nThe tactical is the blocking and\ntackling, the setting it up, and\n\n1540\n01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:05,480\nreally getting it going.\n\n1541\n01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,830\nSo how do we do those things?\n\n1542\n01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:10,250\nWe focus on all those things when\nwe deal with security assessments,\n\n1543\n01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:13,930\nand this is an art as\nmuch as it is a science.\n\n1544\n01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:17,500\nYou typically will find that security\nassessments can be done informally,\n\n1545\n01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:20,040\ninternally by trained practitioners,\n\n1546\n01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:24,940\npeople such as yourselves that are SSCPs,\nmaybe certified in other areas.\n\n1547\n01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:27,890\nYou may have a CISCO security\ncertification for instance,\n\n1548\n01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,850\nand operate on CISCO networks.\n\n1549\n01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:33,140\nSo you may be more than qualified\nif you have those certifications.\n\n1550\n01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:37,140\nTo do a high level security assessment\nof the organizational infrastructure,\n\n1551\n01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:38,910\ntake a look at what's going on in there.\n\n1552\n01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:42,630\nBut you may need, if you're gonna do ore\nof a formal one, one that is documented,\n\n1553\n01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:47,240\nthat almost verges on and may even\ninclude a penetration test as part of\n\n1554\n01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:51,800\nthe assessment overall, you may decide to\nbring in a trusted partner, a third party,\n\n1555\n01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,120\na vendor of some kind, that may have these\nskills and specialize in these areas.\n\n1556\n01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,680\nThis is a very unique set of skills\nto conduct a penetration test\n\n1557\n01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,030\nfrom the outside in, and\n\n1558\n01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:04,550\nthen be able to link that to a security\nassessment to document the findings\n\n1559\n01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:08,480\nthat we often will see are happening\ninside the network as a result of probing.\n\n1560\n01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,030\nAnd doing a vulnerability assessment\n\n1561\n01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:13,880\nkind of wrapped up with\nthe penetration test all in one.\n\n1562\n01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,870\nSo we may bring in a third party and\nwe just wanna be aware of that and\n\n1563\n01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:17,910\nunderstand that.\n\n1564\n01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:22,930\nAnd by doing so, what that's gonna lead\nus to understand how to do is get very\n\n1565\n01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:27,400\nclear picture, a well documented, well\nthought out picture, of exactly what is\n\n1566\n01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,340\nhappening inside of our network and with\nour systems at the given moment in time.\n\n1567\n01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,990\nNow we have to put this in context.\n\n1568\n01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:35,680\nWe have to understand that\na security assessment\n\n1569\n01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,930\nis a snapshot of a moment\nin time of our network.\n\n1570\n01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:43,160\nSo what we did as a security assessment\ntwo years ago, was very valuable\n\n1571\n01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:47,750\nat the time, but is not the up to date\ndocumented evidence of where we are today.\n\n1572\n01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,880\nAnd so, we have to have the context,\n\n1573\n01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,480\nthe timeline around that assessment\nclearly established in our minds.\n\n1574\n01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,812\nBecause the minute we do it, in effect,\nin one respect, it's already out of date.\n\n1575\n01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:57,520\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> Right.\n\n1576\n01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,750\nBut in another respect,\nit's very important as a baseline and\n\n1577\n01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:03,670\na benchmark for where we are,\nversus where we want to be able to go.\n\n1578\n01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:07,990\nAnd what often is missed with security\nassessments is this idea that as we go\n\n1579\n01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:12,710\nthrough them, we create this baseline,\nor this activity, this moment in time.\n\n1580\n01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:15,990\nWe then use that as a launching\npad to affect change, right?\n\n1581\n01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:19,180\nTo go back and do remediation and\ndo the risk assessments and\n\n1582\n01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,280\nall things we need to do.\n\n1583\n01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,680\nWe make those changes.\n\n1584\n01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,440\nWhat we then don't do\nis go backing off and\n\n1585\n01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,390\ndo another assessment against that same\ninfrastructure to see whether the changes\n\n1586\n01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:30,990\nhave been successful at addressing\nthe concerns that we've identified.\n\n1587\n01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:34,960\nWe wait six months or a year to get\nthat output as opposed to going back and\n\n1588\n01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,920\ndoing it as part of the process\nof implementing a change.\n\n1589\n01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,560\nSo, we wanna make sure we understand\nthat and think about that.\n\n1590\n01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,160\nBecause security assessments done once\nare good, but being done every quarter,\n\n1591\n01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,590\nevery six months, are much better and\nwe often see as the best practice\n\n1592\n01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:52,330\nthat you should be doing these at\nleast at a minimum once a year.\n\n1593\n01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:55,610\nBut we recommend usually doing\nthem twice a year on average\n\n1594\n01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:58,550\nto really get a true assessment as\nto what's going on in the network.\n\n1595\n01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,895\nSo remember,\nthey could be both informal and formal.\n\n1596\n01:18:00,895 --> 01:18:03,245\nExternal, internal, some combination.\n\n1597\n01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:08,615\nWe often see penetration testing is being\ndone as a form of security assessment.\n\n1598\n01:18:08,615 --> 01:18:12,605\nVulnerability assessments are done as\na form to secure the assessments in this\n\n1599\n01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:13,795\narea as well.\n\n1600\n01:18:13,795 --> 01:18:16,850\nAnd all these things may\nbe done with software.\n\n1601\n01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:20,675\nWe use different kinds of software\nto do penetration testing and\n\n1602\n01:18:20,675 --> 01:18:23,170\nto do vulnerability assessments.\n\n1603\n01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:25,780\nPenetration tests are typically\ngoing to be done by,\n\n1604\n01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,975\nwhat we call penetration testers.\n\n1605\n01:18:27,975 --> 01:18:30,940\nThird parties, typically,\nthat specialize in this area.\n\n1606\n01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:35,545\nSometimes referred to as\neither a zero knowledge test,\n\n1607\n01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:37,640\nwhere the effect will be\nthe pin tester comes in and\n\n1608\n01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,600\nhas no knowledge of our networks\ndirectly or indirectly.\n\n1609\n01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,650\nThere may be some\nknowledge of that network.\n\n1610\n01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,770\nYou may be given passwords and\nsome basic stuff to come in.\n\n1611\n01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:48,720\nOr you may have what's known as a full\nknowledge, a grey box, a black box,\n\n1612\n01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,290\nor a white box is absolutely correct.\n\n1613\n01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:52,170\nAnother way referring to them.\n\n1614\n01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:56,710\nSo if it's gonna be a black box or a zero\nknowledge test, we really come in and\n\n1615\n01:18:56,710 --> 01:18:57,619\nhave no knowledge.\n\n1616\n01:18:57,619 --> 01:19:01,985\nWe're basically like okay here's the\npublic name of the company and good bye,\n\n1617\n01:19:01,985 --> 01:19:02,605\ngood luck.\n\n1618\n01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:04,585\nWe'll see you in a week and\n\n1619\n01:19:04,585 --> 01:19:08,355\nwe'll talk more about this just as\na high level to remind you of this, but\n\n1620\n01:19:08,355 --> 01:19:10,935\nyou have to get your what's called\nyour get out of jail free card, right?\n\n1621\n01:19:10,935 --> 01:19:12,675\n>> Yes, you do.\n>> Which is the signed contract,\n\n1622\n01:19:12,675 --> 01:19:16,125\nin effect the statement of work from\nthe company that says as the pen tester,\n\n1623\n01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:19,545\nas the vulnerability assessor, I have\nthe right, in effect, to attack you.\n\n1624\n01:19:19,545 --> 01:19:23,445\nYou're not gonna prosecute me if I\nset off alarm bells and whistles.\n\n1625\n01:19:23,445 --> 01:19:24,520\n>> A little CYA right?\n\n1626\n01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,180\nAll right.\n>> CYA exactly right, so\n\n1627\n01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:28,625\na very important acronym in the IT world,\nright.\n\n1628\n01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:30,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So make sure that you have\n\n1629\n01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:32,240\nwhat we literally call the get\nout of jail free card.\n\n1630\n01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right, now make sure you have that\n\n1631\n01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:37,190\nsigned contract, that statement or\nword that stipulates that you actually are\n\n1632\n01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:41,330\nengaging activities that are authorized\nby senior management in that company.\n\n1633\n01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:43,030\n>> And that's another big point, too.\n\n1634\n01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:44,930\nMake sure you get it from\nthe right person, right?\n\n1635\n01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:46,420\n>> Get it from the right person,\nit's gotta be-\n\n1636\n01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,390\n>> If the guy in the IT department\n\n1637\n01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:50,680\nwants you to come and do a test,\nhe's not the one who can say, sure,\n\n1638\n01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,790\nyou can attack our network!\n\n1639\n01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:52,535\n>> No, Zach.\nWell, he can, but\n\n1640\n01:19:52,535 --> 01:19:54,355\nyou don't want to take his word for\nit, right?\n\n1641\n01:19:54,355 --> 01:19:56,495\nBecause you're going to find very\nquickly that's going to prove to be\n\n1642\n01:19:56,495 --> 01:19:57,159\na liability for you.\n\n1643\n01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:02,007\nSo what you do want is senior management,\nand Mike raised a really important point,\n\n1644\n01:20:02,007 --> 01:20:05,640\nwhich is it has to be the right\nperson in the organization.\n\n1645\n01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,380\nTypically, a C level executive or\nmore senior manager,\n\n1646\n01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:13,470\nyou may not get the CEO of the company to\nsign off on it, but typically the CIO or\n\n1647\n01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:18,270\nthe CTO, maybe the chief security officer,\nchief information security officer\n\n1648\n01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:22,260\nCISO may sign off on this, to document\nthe fact that you are authorized, and\n\n1649\n01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:27,220\nmost importantly, aside from the right\nperson on the dotted line, is the outline\n\n1650\n01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:30,890\nof the skills and the areas that you're\ngonna bring to the table and cover.\n\n1651\n01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:31,420\nSo in other words,\n\n1652\n01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:35,430\nare you gonna do a pen test on\nthe main line of business, ERP system.\n\n1653\n01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,220\nAre you just going to probe the websites?\n\n1654\n01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:38,350\nAre you going to take on email?\n\n1655\n01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:41,070\nAre you going to check for\nmobile vulnerabilities?\n\n1656\n01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:45,300\nWhat areas of the systems are you allowed\neffectively, in other words, to play in.\n\n1657\n01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,913\nAnd what areas are off limits, right?\n\n1658\n01:20:46,913 --> 01:20:48,250\nBecause that's very important.\n\n1659\n01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:50,221\nCuz you could, without realizing it,\n\n1660\n01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:52,860\nliterally take down an entire\nproduction network.\n\n1661\n01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you attack the wrong system without\n\n1662\n01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:58,630\nthe prior knowledge of the company\nto make sure theyre prepared for\n\n1663\n01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:59,790\nwhatever that outcome may be.\n\n1664\n01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,240\n>> Right.\n>> Even if it's only at the senior\n\n1665\n01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,760\nmanagement level to say we're aware of it,\nmaybe not in the response phase.\n\n1666\n01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,300\nBut just to know that that\nattack is coming in, and\n\n1667\n01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:11,610\nas it escalates up the wire, we flag\nit as an attack that we were expecting,\n\n1668\n01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:15,790\ninstead of a go pull the plug and\ncircle the battleships and\n\n1669\n01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:16,700\npull up the moat-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1670\n01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,330\n>> Kind of thing, or\n\n1671\n01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:21,400\npull up the drawbridge over the moat,\nbecause as a result, we're under attack.\n\n1672\n01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:25,730\nYou never want a company to take down its\ne-commerce website because of a botched\n\n1673\n01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:28,250\npenetration test because they\nthink they're under attack.\n\n1674\n01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:31,980\nThat leads to significant financial,\npotential liabilities, right?\n\n1675\n01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,200\nSo detailing this out\nbecomes very important.\n\n1676\n01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,914\nSo make sure we know that, and\nmake sure as we do that pen test,\n\n1677\n01:21:36,914 --> 01:21:39,330\nthe black box test, as we said,\nreally no knowledge.\n\n1678\n01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:44,240\nZero knowledge, here's the company\nbasically the URL, the company profile and\n\n1679\n01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,358\nwe'll see the comeback\ndocument in results.\n\n1680\n01:21:46,358 --> 01:21:50,780\nThat grey box test in the middle,\nwhich is some knowledge, medium knowledge.\n\n1681\n01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:53,400\nYou're probably given not just\nthe profile of the company.\n\n1682\n01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,782\nYou're probably told some\ngeneral information about it,\n\n1683\n01:21:56,782 --> 01:21:58,616\ninfrastructure runs this way.\n\n1684\n01:21:58,616 --> 01:22:04,450\nSo maybe we run Windows, we run Linux,\nhere's our external IP address range.\n\n1685\n01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:07,250\nHere's kind of where\nyou find us on the web.\n\n1686\n01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,650\nHere's our router,\nhere's the kind of stuff we do.\n\n1687\n01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:10,980\n>> Right.\n>> So that's going to be that.\n\n1688\n01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:14,930\nA white box which is really internal,\nwhere we almost know everything\n\n1689\n01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:19,020\nabout the system is gonna be where we're\ngiven full access from inside, right?\n\n1690\n01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,920\nSo typically, we may not be physically\nsitting inside the company,\n\n1691\n01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,840\nalthough we may.\n\n1692\n01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,430\nBut we're gonna have user names,\nwe're gonna have passwords,\n\n1693\n01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:29,070\nwe're gonna have the diagrams,\nthe logical and physical infrastructure.\n\n1694\n01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:32,180\nWe're gonna really understand that system,\nand then what we're gonna really\n\n1695\n01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:36,090\nfocus on is not so much penetration,\nbut more vulnerability assessed.\n\n1696\n01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:39,850\nWhen we get to that level, we're looking\nfor vulnerabilities in the systems,\n\n1697\n01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:43,040\nthe patch levels, the architecture,\nthe VLANs, the logical and\n\n1698\n01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,400\nphysical connections.\n\n1699\n01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,910\nAs opposed to, hey, can I get in from\noutside, and get through the DMZ,\n\n1700\n01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:50,900\nam I good enough to go that extra mile and\nget all the way in.\n\n1701\n01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,780\nThat's important, but\nonce we get all that knowledge,\n\n1702\n01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:59,100\nit's child's play to walk through\na network knowing all that stuff.\n\n1703\n01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,940\nWhat's really important then is what\nvulnerabilities exist inside the network.\n\n1704\n01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:05,120\nAnd so we see that transition\ninto vulnerability assessments\n\n1705\n01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:05,850\nwhen we go that way.\n\n1706\n01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:08,228\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nthat and we kind of define that and\n\n1707\n01:23:08,228 --> 01:23:09,199\nthink about that, right?\n\n1708\n01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,210\nThat's gonna be very important as well.\n\n1709\n01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:13,080\nAnd so, maybe we can bring up one or two.\n\n1710\n01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,180\nI know we had a couple of\npictures we talked about,\n\n1711\n01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:18,270\nmaybe just some examples of this,\nthat would be valuable to show you.\n\n1712\n01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:21,140\nI think on the screen\nhere if I'm not mistaken,\n\n1713\n01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,808\nwe're taking a look at Nessus and\nsome of the output of the reports.\n\n1714\n01:23:23,808 --> 01:23:25,830\nFrom the Nessus software run.\n\n1715\n01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:28,410\nThis is a vulnerability\nscanner that is very popular.\n\n1716\n01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:31,680\nIt's an open source scanner\nthat's been built in Linux and\n\n1717\n01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,420\nused by people in Linux.\n\n1718\n01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:35,870\nAnd so as a result,\nthis is a Windows port obviously,\n\n1719\n01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:39,170\nwe're looking at it in Windows,\nhere right the scan capture,\n\n1720\n01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,610\nbut the idea is that we can use this and\nthis tool today.\n\n1721\n01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:45,690\nIt's a very easy point and click kind of\ngraphical environment, you can see it.\n\n1722\n01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:47,350\nIt does rank them for us there.\n\n1723\n01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:50,300\nYou see there's a high\nvulnerability there.\n\n1724\n01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,980\nWhat is it, a firebird default\ncredential on the database.\n\n1725\n01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,610\nSo somebody's got a database\nwith a default logon.\n\n1726\n01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:56,110\n>> Yup.\n>> Right.\n\n1727\n01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,075\nSo that's always fun.\n\n1728\n01:23:57,075 --> 01:24:01,448\n[LAUGH] And then we have some SSL\ncertificates cannot be trusted there.\n\n1729\n01:24:01,448 --> 01:24:06,130\nLooks like RDP is set up and there could\nbe a man-in-the-middle weakness there for\n\n1730\n01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:07,820\nMicrosoft on the windows side.\n\n1731\n01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:12,120\nSome .net issues there, although you\nknow customer is not set in .net.\n\n1732\n01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,360\nIs not life and death right?\n\n1733\n01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,480\nIt just means when things go wrong,\nyou're stuck not knowing why, but\n\n1734\n01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,220\nyou at least know they went wrong,\nright, so.\n\n1735\n01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,560\n>> Contact your system administrator.\n\n1736\n01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,050\n>> Absolutely, the standard default.\n\n1737\n01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:21,616\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1738\n01:24:21,616 --> 01:24:23,373\nyou could see some of these\nare more important than others.\n\n1739\n01:24:23,373 --> 01:24:27,213\nThat one may not be that critical but\nthe fact that we do have RDP set up and\n\n1740\n01:24:27,213 --> 01:24:30,158\npotentially whether or\nnot it's set up the right way,\n\n1741\n01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:32,410\ncould open us up to a man in the middle.\n\n1742\n01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:35,530\nThat's probably a well\nfounded medium vulnerability,\n\n1743\n01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:38,210\nbecause we may want to think a little\nbit about that and take that on.\n\n1744\n01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:38,780\n>> Right.\n\n1745\n01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:40,040\n>> Right.\nThat could be an issue.\n\n1746\n01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,350\nSo this is one way of seeing some\nvulnerabilities in a system.\n\n1747\n01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:47,130\nThe other one is going to be by\nlooking at what we have here.\n\n1748\n01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:51,170\nWe can see that we're\nlooking at an N map scan, or\n\n1749\n01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,550\nthe output of an N map scan,\nas we zoom in.\n\n1750\n01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:57,590\nAnd so what we can see here is\nthat we've done a target scan.\n\n1751\n01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:01,530\nWe're scanning and looking for\nopen ports in this case.\n\n1752\n01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:06,106\nAnd so, as we do a port scan and\nwe see this, we see port 22 for\n\n1753\n01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:08,842\nSSH is open, identifies the build.\n\n1754\n01:25:08,842 --> 01:25:12,570\nYou see 4.3 there so\nversion two of the SSH protocol.\n\n1755\n01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:15,190\nSo, good to know, there may or\nmay not be known vulnerabilities\n\n1756\n01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,680\ndocumented issues\nassociated with this build.\n\n1757\n01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,310\nAnd so we want to know that although\ntypically SSH is not an attack vector.\n\n1758\n01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:22,100\nVery hard to attack.\n\n1759\n01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,990\nIt's actually made and\nspecifically designed for\n\n1760\n01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,100\nyou to prevent-\n>> Right.\n\n1761\n01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,170\n>> Attack by obscuring data\nas opposed to showing it.\n\n1762\n01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:32,240\nSo we also here will have the Port 53 for\nthe domain so\n\n1763\n01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,260\nwe're seeing that information.\n\n1764\n01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:38,023\nIt looks like gopher is available but\nit is closed right now, port 70, so\n\n1765\n01:25:38,023 --> 01:25:40,797\nwe know that gopher is running but\njust not available.\n\n1766\n01:25:40,797 --> 01:25:45,220\nAnd we have port 80 web services are open\nbut notice we see a Fedora Apache build\n\n1767\n01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:49,710\nthere on the website, so we know that we\nare running a Linux based web server, and\n\n1768\n01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:53,406\nas a result, we may or may not then\nbe able to go out and find a bunch of\n\n1769\n01:25:53,406 --> 01:25:58,162\nexploits documented around this particular\nbuild, and maybe take on the web service\n\n1770\n01:25:58,162 --> 01:26:02,030\nhere and try to underlie that web\nservice with some sort of an attack.\n\n1771\n01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,180\nWe're running a little,\n\n1772\n01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:08,660\nit looks like Fedora Core 5 there on\na Linux 2.6 to 0,20 build on the core.\n\n1773\n01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:12,920\nAnd it looks like it's been up and running\nfor at least at the time of the scan.\n\n1774\n01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:16,760\n45 days, which means that we know that\nit has not been rebooted and started for\n\n1775\n01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,850\npatching cycle.\n\n1776\n01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:19,480\n>> Right.\nNow also keep in mind\n\n1777\n01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:21,890\nLinux patching cycles tend\nto vary from Windows cycles.\n\n1778\n01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,000\nIf this was an IS server\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1779\n01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,510\n>> And we saw 45 day up time,\n\n1780\n01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:28,520\nwe would begin to wonder why\nthey missed a patching cycle.\n\n1781\n01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:32,900\nSo you know, you can infer quite a bit\nabout this, just by looking at the output\n\n1782\n01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:37,820\nof a scan, if you know what you're looking\nat and understand what is there, right.\n\n1783\n01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:39,140\nAnd if we can scroll down\njust a little bit, Mike,\n\n1784\n01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:41,410\nthere's also, we don't see a lot of it,\nbut just right there,\n\n1785\n01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:43,300\njust to show the beginning\nof the trace route, right.\n\n1786\n01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,080\n>> Right.\n>> So we also see the trace route there,\n\n1787\n01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,660\nat least the first two hops of it anyway\n>> There's more but\n\n1788\n01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,210\nobviously, the screen\ncapture can be scrolled down.\n\n1789\n01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,230\nWe don't see that.\n\n1790\n01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:53,287\nBut we begin the two hops,\nbut what we're seeing is,\n\n1791\n01:26:53,287 --> 01:26:54,993\nwe're seeing the beginning point of this.\n\n1792\n01:26:54,993 --> 01:26:58,456\nSo 192, address box, so\na private internal IP.\n\n1793\n01:26:58,456 --> 01:27:03,655\nWe're then seeing a jump outside to\non e of the carrier provide nets,\n\n1794\n01:27:03,655 --> 01:27:05,995\nso SCP Global or whatever that may be.\n\n1795\n01:27:05,995 --> 01:27:08,575\nAnd we're seeing the jump from\nthe internal to the external here.\n\n1796\n01:27:08,575 --> 01:27:11,145\nAnd we see that's one hop,\nwhich means we know that they're\n\n1797\n01:27:11,145 --> 01:27:14,055\nbasically crossing one interface\nto go outside the network.\n\n1798\n01:27:14,055 --> 01:27:17,565\nSo we can begin to tell a little bit\nabout the structure of the routing and\n\n1799\n01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:19,380\nmaybe the DMZ that's in place,\n\n1800\n01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:21,835\nright, things like that because\nthere's one external interface.\n\n1801\n01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:26,870\nAnd so we want to begin to really\nunderstand how to extract knowledge\n\n1802\n01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:29,140\nout of these kinds of assessments and\nscales.\n\n1803\n01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:32,930\nThis is obviously not the full blown,\nhow do I become a PIN tester,\n\n1804\n01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:35,100\nhow do I become a vulnerability\nassessment tester.\n\n1805\n01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,150\n>> Right, right\n>> How do I do\n\n1806\n01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:37,725\nthe ethical hacking concept.\n\n1807\n01:27:37,725 --> 01:27:39,300\n>> Mm-hm\n>> That's not this discussion.\n\n1808\n01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:42,737\nYeah, we have the ability to have these\ndiscussions and to train you and help you\n\n1809\n01:27:42,737 --> 01:27:46,331\nunderstand those skills and acquire them\nover time but it's going to be for another\n\n1810\n01:27:46,331 --> 01:27:49,743\ndiscussion another program and another\nopportunity to learn something new.\n\n1811\n01:27:49,743 --> 01:27:53,499\nHere we're just pointing out that bringing\nto bear some of the knowledge that we\n\n1812\n01:27:53,499 --> 01:27:56,248\nposses as practitioners already\nthat we can identify some\n\n1813\n01:27:56,248 --> 01:27:59,743\nvery important elements about\nthe structure and make up of this network.\n\n1814\n01:27:59,743 --> 01:28:02,860\n>> It's important that we see this because\nthe bad guys might be seeing this They're\n\n1815\n01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,269\ndefinitely going to see it, right?\n\n1816\n01:28:04,269 --> 01:28:05,035\nAbsolutely.\n\n1817\n01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:05,953\n[CROSSTALK] So we want to know that.\n\n1818\n01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:06,870\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1819\n01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:08,170\n>> Very, very important.\n\n1820\n01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:09,810\nSo these kind of things can be helpful.\n\n1821\n01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:12,400\nIf you haven't performed\nan assessment on your\n\n1822\n01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,120\nown network internally with a tool\nlike this, go out and download Nexus.\n\n1823\n01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,970\nGo out and download Nmap.\n\n1824\n01:28:17,970 --> 01:28:20,350\nThese are typically either\nWindows ports are open.\n\n1825\n01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:24,450\nSource Linux based tools that\nare very easily approachable today.\n\n1826\n01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:25,960\nThere's instructions on how to run them.\n\n1827\n01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,200\nBoth these tools will run in Windows or\nLinux.\n\n1828\n01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,340\nYou can run them in\nvirtual machines today,\n\n1829\n01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,960\nas long as you have a network adapter\nthat's connected to the network.\n\n1830\n01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,430\nYou can port them across\nwith no trouble and\n\n1831\n01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:38,370\nthere's many, many other tools\nout there that you can use.\n\n1832\n01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:41,510\nThese are one of hundreds\nthat wind up in tool kits.\n\n1833\n01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:44,190\nAnd there are whole distribution's\non Linux side, right?\n\n1834\n01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:46,170\nSecure Linux and Optics, things like that.\n\n1835\n01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:49,770\nWhere you get all these tools\nrecombined or combined together in one.\n\n1836\n01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:52,420\nBootable distribution that runs off media,\nright?\n\n1837\n01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,520\nSo you don't have to worry about\n\n1838\n01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,910\ninstalling anything or\neven knowing anything.\n\n1839\n01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:56,020\nThink about Linux.\n\n1840\n01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:56,990\n>> Exactly.\n>> Very, very nice.\n\n1841\n01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:57,500\nRight.\n\n1842\n01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,350\nEasy.\nWe don't have that same luxury in Windows,\n\n1843\n01:28:59,350 --> 01:28:59,960\nunfortunately.\n\n1844\n01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,290\nYou have to actually understand\nhow to install tools and run them.\n\n1845\n01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:04,760\nBut the idea is still there and\nit's still important to understand,\n\n1846\n01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,780\nwhich is get familiar with the tools.\n\n1847\n01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:10,180\nTalk to your peers and\ncolleagues about the tools that they use.\n\n1848\n01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:11,590\nUnderstand what they're doing.\n\n1849\n01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:14,980\nGo out to the blogs and read up on\nwhat security professionals are doing.\n\n1850\n01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:16,390\nWhat's the latest tool that's out there?\n\n1851\n01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:18,660\nWhat's the latest activity\nthat you may be seeing?\n\n1852\n01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,900\nAnd understand that.\n\n1853\n01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,180\nGo out and play with it.\n\n1854\n01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:25,450\nNothing worse that coming across something\nin the wild, having no exposure to it,\n\n1855\n01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:26,720\nno point of reference.\n\n1856\n01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:30,700\nAnd while Google is your friend,\nit should not be your reactive tool for\n\n1857\n01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,860\nevery opportunity to troubleshoot either.\n\n1858\n01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:35,400\nRight, you should have some working\nknowledge of things as you walk\n\n1859\n01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,250\ninto a solution.\n\n1860\n01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:39,190\nMake sure you're aware of that,\nmake sure you're comfortable with that.\n\n1861\n01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:41,280\nIt will be an important thought\nprocess for you to engage in.\n\n1862\n01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,820\nAnd really just think about it.\n\n1863\n01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:45,700\nThe key here is to understand\nhow to document and\n\n1864\n01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,450\nreally take the output of these\nscans that we talked about.\n\n1865\n01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:52,090\nYou saw the documentation as we walk\nthrough with you and just reading it.\n\n1866\n01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:55,550\nAnd capture that and\ntranslate that into actionable items.\n\n1867\n01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:59,020\nWhat I love to see when I go in and\nI talk to clients and customers, and\n\n1868\n01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:02,900\nI do auditing work, and I'm invited to\ncome in and see what a customer is doing.\n\n1869\n01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,910\nI love to see the output of\nscan documented in a run book,\n\n1870\n01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:08,680\nalong with the remediation\nactivities in the change log.\n\n1871\n01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:12,000\nAnd I love to see that this is what they\nfound, this is what they identified as\n\n1872\n01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,970\nprioritized, and\nthis is what they chose to remediate, and\n\n1873\n01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:18,460\nthis is what they accepted as risk\nthat was valuable to the organization.\n\n1874\n01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,750\nAnd chose to deal with, right.\n\n1875\n01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,810\nAnd so by seeing all those things,\n\n1876\n01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:25,972\nwe really get to see a full picture of how\nwe're managing that system in real time.\n\n1877\n01:30:25,972 --> 01:30:28,490\nThat's very, very important for\nus to understand that and\n\n1878\n01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:32,510\nto be reactive if we can at all to\nreally understand what that means.\n\n1879\n01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:36,010\nAnd so, when we think about those things,\ninterpreting the results of the test,\n\n1880\n01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:39,290\nunderstanding what they are, and\ngetting professional assistance, right.\n\n1881\n01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:42,750\nIf you're not sure what something\nis in the wild, you ask somebody.\n\n1882\n01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:43,840\nGet them to help you.\n\n1883\n01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,070\nTake those results, call support,\nright, talk to them,\n\n1884\n01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:51,430\nfind out if the vendor has any information\nabout it, ask a peer or a colleague.\n\n1885\n01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:52,830\nThose are all going to\nbe important things.\n\n1886\n01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:56,810\nYou know, I can't remember the number\nof times I've been asked by somebody,\n\n1887\n01:30:56,810 --> 01:31:01,555\njust not professionally off the grid\nkind of thing, but just as a favor.\n\n1888\n01:31:01,555 --> 01:31:03,480\nHey I found this, I'm not sure what it is.\n\n1889\n01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,430\nCan you take a look and\nat least point me in the right direction.\n\n1890\n01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:08,670\nDon't spend a lot of cycles on this,\ndon't come in.\n\n1891\n01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:09,470\nWe're not looking to hire you.\n\n1892\n01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:11,310\nWe don't want you to come and\ntell us what we did wrong.\n\n1893\n01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:13,770\nWe just want you to help us understand\nwhat we need to do to figure it out.\n\n1894\n01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,280\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1895\n01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,740\n>> And I'm more than happy to do that.\n\n1896\n01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:19,780\nI do that all the time for students,\nI do it for customers a lot of the times.\n\n1897\n01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:23,460\nYou know I work pretty cheaply, a good cup\nof espresso I'm yours for an hour or two.\n\n1898\n01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:26,770\nRight, so really the idea there is\nget that professional guidance.\n\n1899\n01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:27,970\n>> Yeah.\n>> Ask somebody who knows.\n\n1900\n01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:28,720\n>> Mm hm.\n>> And if you ask two or\n\n1901\n01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:31,820\nthree people and you get the same thing\n>> It's probably a good indication of\n\n1902\n01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,030\nthe fact that you're on the right track.\n\n1903\n01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:36,940\nIf you ask five people and you get six\ndifferent opinions, what that tells me\n\n1904\n01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,970\nis that it's so new that probably\nnobody really understands it yet.\n\n1905\n01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:42,090\nAnd that's where I really then\nneed to spend some time and\n\n1906\n01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:43,420\ndrill in and figure it out.\n\n1907\n01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:44,500\nCause then I'm concerned.\n\n1908\n01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,550\nIf I can't get a straight answer\nout of people that I rely on,\n\n1909\n01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:51,880\nthat I trust that are advisors to\nme in my professional practice.\n\n1910\n01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,830\nAnd we all have those people we go to,\nright.\n\n1911\n01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:57,080\nIf I can't talk to those people,\nas senior and\n\n1912\n01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:01,510\nprofessional as I am in the IT And\nthe security world that I live in.\n\n1913\n01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:04,920\nI've got 20, 30 years of experience\ndoing most of this stuff.\n\n1914\n01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,720\nIf I don't have the answer, that doesn't\nmean it's a good or a bad thing.\n\n1915\n01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,750\nIt just means I may never\nhave seen that before.\n\n1916\n01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,770\nBut I know enough to\nknow what I don't know.\n\n1917\n01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:14,470\nAnd if I go ask the people\nthat I think should know, and\n\n1918\n01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,770\nthey still can't help me understand it,\n\n1919\n01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:20,690\nwhat I take away from that conversation\nis, it's a relatively new phenomenon.\n\n1920\n01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:24,720\nAnd I then really have to go out and do my\nhomework before I make any decisions about\n\n1921\n01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,090\nhow to interact with it, interpret it,\ndo anything like that at all.\n\n1922\n01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:31,030\nAnd so, the idea of bringing maybe\na virtual environment to play here, right.\n\n1923\n01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:33,190\nWhere we can go and create a sandbox,\n\n1924\n01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:36,440\na little play area where we can isolate\nthese events and work with them.\n\n1925\n01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:39,820\nMay be important, may be something\nthat you want to consider doing.\n\n1926\n01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,460\nAnd if you haven't done that already,\nthink about doing that.\n\n1927\n01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:45,460\nYou know, I would challenge you out there\nas you think through the process of\n\n1928\n01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:48,410\nhow to become an SSCP, and how you test.\n\n1929\n01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:52,410\nAnd really how you acquire knowledge and\nunderstand it and internalize it\n\n1930\n01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:55,760\nto create environments where you can test\nthese things out, because let's be honest.\n\n1931\n01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,560\nYou can't go back to production, right?\n\n1932\n01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:00,570\nIt's very hard to go into production and\nsay, yeah, I wanna play with that router.\n\n1933\n01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:04,020\nI need to take that firewall, and I need\nto reconfigure it so we can get attacked.\n\n1934\n01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,060\nSo I wanna see how this Mauer\nactually behaves, right?\n\n1935\n01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,570\nAnd so when we talk about that stuff\nit sounds really exciting, but\n\n1936\n01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:11,580\nthe challenge is you can't just go out and\ndo that.\n\n1937\n01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:13,750\nAt least you shouldn't go out and\ndo that anyway.\n\n1938\n01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:17,030\nAnd so you have to take that internal,\nand you know the advent of technology\n\n1939\n01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:20,760\nover the last several years towards\nthis desktop virtualization services.\n\n1940\n01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,590\n>> It's fantastic.\n\n1941\n01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:22,290\n>> It's phenomenal.\n\n1942\n01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:27,260\nI mean, I just can't imagine what we used\nto, I mean, I can because I did it, right,\n\n1943\n01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:29,920\nbut I find it very hard to imagine\nthat I used to have to sit and\n\n1944\n01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,475\nbuild these things from scratch, right?\n\n1945\n01:33:31,475 --> 01:33:36,090\nAnd so I wanna really just stress for\nyou, how lucky you are and\n\n1946\n01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:38,030\nhow important it is to really\nthink about these things.\n\n1947\n01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:42,940\nBecause I do remember a time where when I\nwanted to look at a messaging system like\n\n1948\n01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:46,200\nExchange hypothetically, or Sendmail, or\n\n1949\n01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:51,930\nNovell if it was a Novell mail solution,\nor whatever it may have been.\n\n1950\n01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:55,690\nThat I had to build every\nserver in that infrastructure.\n\n1951\n01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:58,640\nFrom scratch, physically,\nlink them all together.\n\n1952\n01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:02,280\nAnd there was no, oops, I didn't mean to\nundo, you know, do, undo snapshot concept.\n\n1953\n01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,350\n>> Undo snapshot, yeah.\n\n1954\n01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:04,460\n[LAUGH]\n>> You blew it up, guess what,\n\n1955\n01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,460\nyou start it from scratch.\n\n1956\n01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:07,700\nIt was another four hours to rebuild it.\n\n1957\n01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:08,620\n>> Yeah.\n>> It was a totally\n\n1958\n01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:11,150\ndifferent world back then because\nwhen we had to build test labs.\n\n1959\n01:34:11,150 --> 01:34:12,540\nYou had 12, 15, 20 machines running.\n\n1960\n01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:15,410\n>> You probably didn't do as much testing,\nright?\n\n1961\n01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:18,800\nYou probably had to prioritize, and\nit had to warrant all of that effort.\n\n1962\n01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,470\n>> You did, and so\n\n1963\n01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:23,860\nit really was a different concept of\nhow we would approach being proactive.\n\n1964\n01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:26,680\nWe tested, to Mike's point,\nit's a great one, we tested,\n\n1965\n01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:30,020\nthe only things that really we could\ntest were the most critical things.\n\n1966\n01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:31,880\nThe things that if we\ndidn't test them properly,\n\n1967\n01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,660\nright, would literally\nblow up the entire world.\n\n1968\n01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:39,850\nAnd so as a result of that, what we did,\nbasically, was we went ahead.\n\n1969\n01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:42,340\nSorry, a little hair adjustment there so\nI could keep thinking, and\n\n1970\n01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:45,520\nit wasn't just pulling down my hair, or\nrather my head, and weighing me down.\n\n1971\n01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,520\nSo you know, we had to really think\nabout what the priority was, and\n\n1972\n01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,340\nhow to adjust that.\n\n1973\n01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:51,300\nToday, it's still that same mindset,\n\n1974\n01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:55,090\nwe wanna think about that priority,\nbut virtualization today gives us so\n\n1975\n01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:59,610\nmuch more flexibility around penetration\ntesting, vulnerability assessments.\n\n1976\n01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:03,300\nToday I carry table devices with me,\nright, a Windows 8 tablet.\n\n1977\n01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:07,300\nI carry what you would\ncall a slate device.\n\n1978\n01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:11,600\nSo it's a form factor that runs Windows\n8 It's not the traditional, either the,\n\n1979\n01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,530\nyou know, the tablet devices\nthat we may be familiar with.\n\n1980\n01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:18,920\nSo maybe the surface tablet or something\nlike that, or an iPad like device.\n\n1981\n01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:23,050\nA slate is basically a full computer,\nbut in a slightly smaller form factor.\n\n1982\n01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:25,100\nIt's got the form factor of a tablet.\n\n1983\n01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,380\n>> Right.\n>> It's a little bit heavier,\n\n1984\n01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:28,050\na little bit bigger, a little bit bulkier.\n\n1985\n01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:30,760\nSo I run a couple of those because\nI think that they're important.\n\n1986\n01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:35,220\nI run these surface devices but I also use\na slate because of the nature of the slate\n\n1987\n01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:37,820\nand the build on it I can actually\nrun virtual machines on it.\n\n1988\n01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:40,540\nI can't do that on the surface,\nbut I can run it on the slate.\n\n1989\n01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:45,100\nI have 4 gigs of memory in there,\nI've got a dual core processor.\n\n1990\n01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:47,210\nI've got 128 gig solid state drive.\n\n1991\n01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:50,310\nSo I basically carry my desktop with me\nin a form factor that's a little more\n\n1992\n01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:51,930\nportable than my laptop.\n\n1993\n01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:53,540\nAnd I can run VMs on that thing.\n\n1994\n01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,830\nI can hook it up to a network.\n\n1995\n01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:57,965\nAnd I can run my pen testing tools,\nmy vulnerability testing tools there.\n\n1996\n01:35:57,965 --> 01:36:02,526\nI can boot it to Linux so I can run, you\nknow, Linux Kernel off a USB drive on it.\n\n1997\n01:36:02,526 --> 01:36:03,493\nAnd so as a result,\n\n1998\n01:36:03,493 --> 01:36:07,005\nI carry that toolset with me in a much\nmore compact form factor today.\n\n1999\n01:36:07,005 --> 01:36:08,290\n>> Fantastic.\n\n2000\n01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:11,280\n>> I carry a lot of those tools\non my mobile phone as well.\n\n2001\n01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,050\nLike on my smartphone because today you\nhave things like TeamViewer that you can\n\n2002\n01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:17,150\nuse as an app on your phone,\nremote capabilities to get in.\n\n2003\n01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:19,000\nThose are not virtualization tools.\n\n2004\n01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,250\nBut I promise you,\nright, if you come back,\n\n2005\n01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:25,760\ncycle back to this program in another two\nyears or so, right, we'll still be here.\n\n2006\n01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,450\nBut cycle back and listen to the\nprediction I'm about share to you about\n\n2007\n01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,540\nwhether or\nnot this is what happens in the future.\n\n2008\n01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:33,630\nBecause I think in the next couple\nof years with the advent of\n\n2009\n01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:38,270\nmobile technology, and the blurring of the\nlines between what a smartphone represents\n\n2010\n01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:43,060\nas a productivity tool and a management\ndevice, and an all-in-one device.\n\n2011\n01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:46,020\nThat we're gonna see that these tools that\nhave traditionally been in the domain of\n\n2012\n01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:47,530\nthe security practitioner, but\n\n2013\n01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:51,080\non the desktop are now gonna\nget ported to mobile platforms.\n\n2014\n01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,150\nEspecially on the Windows side,\nif you think about that.\n\n2015\n01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:55,040\nAnd now on the Android side by extension.\n\n2016\n01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,830\nBut because of that, you're gonna have\npeople running around, literally,\n\n2017\n01:36:58,830 --> 01:37:02,930\nwith these tools in the palm of their\nhand, using them on their phone.\n\n2018\n01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:06,540\nAnd they're not gonna be tied to\na desktop in the traditional sense.\n\n2019\n01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:10,440\nSo you're gonna have people attacking\nyour networks from their cell phones.\n\n2020\n01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:12,975\nAnd this is gonna be chaos\nat the end of the day,\n\n2021\n01:37:12,975 --> 01:37:17,661\nbecause how do you defend against a mobile\nfrontier that is truly mobile, right, and\n\n2022\n01:37:17,661 --> 01:37:21,129\nis so spread out that there's no\nsingle point of entry or exit.\n\n2023\n01:37:21,129 --> 01:37:22,161\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n2024\n01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:22,811\n>> It's going to be near impossible.\n\n2025\n01:37:22,811 --> 01:37:24,190\n>> It's going to become very,\nvery difficult.\n\n2026\n01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:26,870\nSo let's see what happens, but\nI'm willing to bet you on that one.\n\n2027\n01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:30,390\nAnd I think if you come back and\ncheck this out, and tell me whether or\n\n2028\n01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:33,280\nnot I was right or wrong, we're gonna\nfind that that's probably something like\n\n2029\n01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,090\nwhat's going to happen,\nbecause it's already starting to happen.\n\n2030\n01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,190\n>> It is.\n>> We're already seeing those ports.\n\n2031\n01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:38,450\n>> I'm already seeing some really cool\ntools on some of the Android devices,\n\n2032\n01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:39,650\nscanners and things like that.\n\n2033\n01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:40,380\nSo it's just a matter of time.\n\n2034\n01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:41,870\n>> Yeah.\nI've got ping scanners and\n\n2035\n01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:44,120\nthings that i run on my Windows tablet\nright now and on my mobile device.\n\n2036\n01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:47,873\n>> Windows put out an official\nremote desktop app on the iOS\n\n2037\n01:37:47,873 --> 01:37:48,613\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n2038\n01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:49,877\nYeah, along with Office.\n\n2039\n01:37:49,877 --> 01:37:50,945\nYay.\n\n2040\n01:37:50,945 --> 01:37:52,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so very good.\n\n2041\n01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:55,390\nSo, I think we're gonna wrap\nup this particular session and\n\n2042\n01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:58,378\nthis conversation, and\nwe're gonna finish up our thoughts here.\n\n2043\n01:37:58,378 --> 01:38:01,310\nWe are gonna come back and\ntalk a bit about incident handling and\n\n2044\n01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:04,060\nincident management, and we'll\nobviously have another session on that.\n\n2045\n01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:05,670\nWe encourage you to come back and listen.\n\n2046\n01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:07,400\nAnd we'll look for you in a few minutes.\n\n2047\n01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:10,061\n[SOUND]\n\n2048\n01:38:10,061 --> 01:38:15,385\nAll right.\n\n2049\n01:38:15,385 --> 01:38:19,614\nWelcome back everybody to our risk\nresponse and recovery portion of our SSCP,\n\n2050\n01:38:19,614 --> 01:38:23,830\nand we're gonna get ready to dive\nin to some incident handling next.\n\n2051\n01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:25,450\n>> Incident handling, interesting topics.\n\n2052\n01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:28,140\nSo let's talk a little bit about\nincident handling in a high level.\n\n2053\n01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:31,551\nThe goal here is to really understand\nincident response, and the objectives\n\n2054\n01:38:31,551 --> 01:38:34,820\naround what incident response\nrepresents to the organization, right?\n\n2055\n01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:36,870\nAnd so,\nwhen we think about incident response,\n\n2056\n01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:39,530\nwe're really thinking about\nthe detection of a problem.\n\n2057\n01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:42,880\nWhat is it that we're trying to respond\nto, how do we know we have an issue,\n\n2058\n01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,330\nwhat is that, determine the cause.\n\n2059\n01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:48,680\nTalked a little bit with you\nin prior presentations and\n\n2060\n01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:52,110\nprior episodes about root\ncause analysis and asking why.\n\n2061\n01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:54,800\nGetting down to understanding\nwhat's behind what's happening.\n\n2062\n01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,240\nSo, determine cause.\n\n2063\n01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,920\nMinimize the damage if possible.\n\n2064\n01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,230\nSo come up with a remediation solution and\ntry to contain it.\n\n2065\n01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:02,230\nResolve the problem.\n\n2066\n01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:06,579\nSo ultimately understand root cause, put\na fix in place, document lessons learned\n\n2067\n01:39:06,579 --> 01:39:10,254\nthrough some sort of a, maybe a PIR\nopposed to implementation review,\n\n2068\n01:39:10,254 --> 01:39:12,760\nlessons learned, whatever you call it.\n\n2069\n01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:17,270\nAnd then obviously as a result of that,\ncreate documentation that will help us to\n\n2070\n01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:19,960\nprevent this from occurring again,\nbecause we understand and\n\n2071\n01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:23,845\nidentify the symptoms and hopefully if\nthat's the case, we can move more quickly\n\n2072\n01:39:23,845 --> 01:39:26,755\nthe next time to understand that\nwe have this particular issue.\n\n2073\n01:39:26,755 --> 01:39:29,215\nAnd so these are really gonna\nbe kind of the key steps,\n\n2074\n01:39:29,215 --> 01:39:33,275\nthe high level steps, that we would\nengage in around incident response.\n\n2075\n01:39:33,275 --> 01:39:36,535\nBut let's go one step further,\nlet's actually document a formal incident\n\n2076\n01:39:36,535 --> 01:39:41,055\nresponse process, really talk about the\nphases involved with incident response.\n\n2077\n01:39:41,055 --> 01:39:43,262\nWe do have a detailed documentation.\n\n2078\n01:39:43,262 --> 01:39:45,310\nElements here that has been formalized,\n\n2079\n01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:47,560\nthat is the accepted way of\ndealing with incident response.\n\n2080\n01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,000\nI wanna share that with you.\n\n2081\n01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,570\nPut that up on the screen for you.\n\n2082\n01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:52,700\nAnd make sure we're\nable to deal with that.\n\n2083\n01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:55,490\nAnd so we broke it into three\ncategories as you can see here.\n\n2084\n01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:57,710\nMike and I talked a little\nbit before we got started.\n\n2085\n01:39:57,710 --> 01:40:00,190\nWe were just making sure\nwe had it all captured.\n\n2086\n01:40:00,190 --> 01:40:01,780\nAnd so we have triage.\n\n2087\n01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:05,815\nAs a category area, this is really\ngonna be the phase if you will,\n\n2088\n01:40:05,815 --> 01:40:08,565\nof the primary activities\nassociated with the phase is so.\n\n2089\n01:40:08,565 --> 01:40:12,920\nTriage is gonna be one of the key three\nprimary activity groups that we think\n\n2090\n01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:17,130\nabout, response and follow up, and then we\nhave activities associated with each, and\n\n2091\n01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:20,282\nso in the triage area,\nwe talked about identification.\n\n2092\n01:40:20,282 --> 01:40:23,476\nLet's identify as we just said,\nwhat that incident, that problem is,\n\n2093\n01:40:23,476 --> 01:40:26,540\nmake sure we know what it is we're\ndealing with, and most importantly,\n\n2094\n01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:28,100\nwhat we're not dealing with right?\n\n2095\n01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:32,000\nNothing worse than going after a problem,\nand figuring out we spent all this time\n\n2096\n01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,720\nand energy over here doing this, when in\nfact, it's really something very small in\n\n2097\n01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:38,000\nfront of us that we could have dealt\nwith if we just paid attention.\n\n2098\n01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,530\nSo we wanna make sure we understand that.\n\n2099\n01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:42,080\nThen we move into response.\n\n2100\n01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:46,732\nAnd in the response activity area,\nwe're gonna see containment, analysis, and\n\n2101\n01:40:46,732 --> 01:40:47,820\ntracking.\n\n2102\n01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:50,860\nAnd so we wanna make sure we\nunderstand that we have to\n\n2103\n01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:52,580\nfigure out what it is through triage.\n\n2104\n01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:56,360\nThen we have to make sure we don't allow\nwhatever it is to bleed beyond the borders\n\n2105\n01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:59,030\nof where it all ready has\nestablished itself in the network.\n\n2106\n01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:01,450\nIf it's in one area, perhaps in a VLAN,\n\n2107\n01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:04,980\nor if it's just on one type of desktop,\none image let's say.\n\n2108\n01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:05,520\n>> Right.\n>> We wanna\n\n2109\n01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,820\nmake sure we don't let it escape.\n\n2110\n01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:10,210\nThat may involve doing things\nlike unplugging a network cable.\n\n2111\n01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:13,320\nPerhaps logically or\nphysically isolating the machine.\n\n2112\n01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,300\nIt may involve turning the machine off and\ntaking it out of production.\n\n2113\n01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,310\nThere's lots of things that could\nbe involved there, but contain it.\n\n2114\n01:41:19,310 --> 01:41:20,270\nAnalysis of it.\n\n2115\n01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:23,000\nSo what is going on,\nlet's actually drill in.\n\n2116\n01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,190\nIdentification is not the same\nthing by the way as analysis.\n\n2117\n01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:28,670\nIdentification is, we have a sense that\n\n2118\n01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:31,900\nlooks like Mike is standing in front of\nme, and I'm pretty sure that's Mike, but\n\n2119\n01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:34,470\nthen analyzing it would\nreally be a different level.\n\n2120\n01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:36,128\nWe may wanna take fingerprints from Mike.\n\n2121\n01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:39,650\nWe may wanna get Mike's DNA, and\ndo a full analysis of whether or\n\n2122\n01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:44,430\nnot it really is Mike, or\nmaybe some sort of an alien dropped\n\n2123\n01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:48,710\na Mike-like person here who's standing\nhere next to me but is really not Mike.\n\n2124\n01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:51,707\nAnd so, we're being a little\nsilly here with our analogy here,\n\n2125\n01:41:51,707 --> 01:41:52,770\nit's late in our day.\n\n2126\n01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:56,790\nBut you just have to think about that\nfact that when we talk about this,\n\n2127\n01:41:56,790 --> 01:42:00,040\nthe key criteria that I wanna point\nout to you, the difference is that\n\n2128\n01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:04,640\nidentification is usually a very quick,\ncursory look at the issue.\n\n2129\n01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:08,620\nAnalysis is that more in depth, right,\nstep-by-step, let's really take it\n\n2130\n01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:11,790\ndown to that level and\nunderstand what's happening look, right?\n\n2131\n01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:12,970\nAnd then tracking, right?\n\n2132\n01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:15,910\nWe wanna make sure we understand not\njust where it is, keep it contained,\n\n2133\n01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:20,030\nanalyze it, but make sure we\nunderstand as we go get ready and\n\n2134\n01:42:20,030 --> 01:42:23,040\nfollow up to apply a fix and remediate.\n\n2135\n01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,910\nWanna make sure we know what's happening,\nso\n\n2136\n01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:26,740\nwe wanna make sure containment is holding.\n\n2137\n01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,130\nWe don't wanna see it spreading.\n\n2138\n01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:31,280\nWe wanna understand as we remediate that\nit's being removed from the environment.\n\n2139\n01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:35,705\nSo tracking helps us to do these things\nand documentation of that is part of it.\n\n2140\n01:42:35,705 --> 01:42:38,650\nIn the follow up area,\nthe activities we see is recovery.\n\n2141\n01:42:38,650 --> 01:42:41,870\nSo let's apply the patch or\nwhatever that may be, that remediation,\n\n2142\n01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:43,800\nand then let's ultimately prevent.\n\n2143\n01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:49,650\nAnd prevent is documenting to ensure we\nunderstand what that recovery solution is,\n\n2144\n01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:52,115\nand that we roll that forward\nto the next time this happens.\n\n2145\n01:42:52,115 --> 01:42:55,960\nWe're not faced with a need to learn and\nto recreate that knowledge.\n\n2146\n01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,150\n>> Start from the beginning\nall over again.\n\n2147\n01:42:57,150 --> 01:42:58,013\n>> Right.\nBecause we're gonna waste\n\n2148\n01:42:58,013 --> 01:42:58,651\nvaluable time, right?\n\n2149\n01:42:58,651 --> 01:43:02,170\nThat's gonna cause issues and\ncost time and money.\n\n2150\n01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,930\nInstead what we wanna do is make\nsure that we understand that\n\n2151\n01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:07,840\nwe have somewhere in the back of our mind,\nthe knowledge that if we just go look in\n\n2152\n01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,000\nour knowledge base or wherever we document\nthat stuff that hopefully we've recorded\n\n2153\n01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,100\nenough information that we can quickly get\nout of the gate, quickly jump on that,\n\n2154\n01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:19,260\nestablish containment immediately,\nand prevent spread.\n\n2155\n01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:20,620\nAnd this is gonna be very important.\n\n2156\n01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:24,970\nSo, incident response processes,\nsuper important incident response and\n\n2157\n01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:28,090\nincident handling,\nsuper important to understand how to do\n\n2158\n01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:31,000\nin the production environments\nin the enterprise.\n\n2159\n01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,290\nAlso important for you as you\nprepare to be able to go out and\n\n2160\n01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:37,050\napply this knowledge against\nsomething like an exam.\n\n2161\n01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:42,680\nYou need to understand, ultimately how to\nbring these methodologies, these step by\n\n2162\n01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:47,400\nstep solutions to bear in order to answer\nquestions around how we do something.\n\n2163\n01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:50,340\nBe prepared to understand\nthe methodology as well as the steps,\n\n2164\n01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:52,190\nthe prioritized order that we do them in.\n\n2165\n01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,840\nSo this is very important.\n\n2166\n01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:54,988\nSo make sure you're comfortable with that.\n\n2167\n01:43:54,988 --> 01:43:59,678\nNow again, I'll remind you that if you\nhave not done something like this, and\n\n2168\n01:43:59,678 --> 01:44:03,532\nwe may have been involved with\nresponse and incident handling.\n\n2169\n01:44:03,532 --> 01:44:07,209\nInformally, it may have been just on\na team that tripped over an event and\n\n2170\n01:44:07,209 --> 01:44:09,864\nmay or may not have actually\nhave had the opportunity\n\n2171\n01:44:09,864 --> 01:44:12,710\nto follow a predetermined\nprocess step by step.\n\n2172\n01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:15,910\nBut if you haven't done this formally,\nit's probably a good idea for\n\n2173\n01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:20,691\nyou to go out and try to see if you can\nassociate with a emergency response team,\n\n2174\n01:44:20,691 --> 01:44:23,957\nwhat's called a CERT in our\nworld in information security,\n\n2175\n01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:25,960\na computer emergency response team.\n\n2176\n01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:29,510\nSo most big companies have\nCERTs associated with them.\n\n2177\n01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:30,580\nThese are strike teams or\n\n2178\n01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:34,320\nearly response teams that get called\nin when there's a major breach.\n\n2179\n01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,040\nYou may not be able to join that team.\n\n2180\n01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:38,360\nYou may not meet the experiential\nrequirements to do so.\n\n2181\n01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:42,135\nBut that doesn't mean you can't find out\nwhat they do and tag along and observe.\n\n2182\n01:44:42,135 --> 01:44:43,980\n>> Mm-hm\n>> A lot of the times they will allow you\n\n2183\n01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:45,920\nto do that, if you don't get in the way.\n\n2184\n01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,390\nAnd this way you get some knowledge and\n\n2185\n01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:49,960\nget some training and\nsome general understanding and awareness.\n\n2186\n01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:53,580\nYou may also be able to keep up with\nwhat's going on in the wild by looking at\n\n2187\n01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:57,620\nthings like the US-CERT or\ndifferent companies CERT solutions.\n\n2188\n01:44:57,620 --> 01:44:59,470\nThey all, a lot of companies, companies,\n\n2189\n01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:02,910\nexcuse me a lot of countries today,\nwhich have companies in them by the way.\n\n2190\n01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:07,650\nBut a lot of countries will have CERTs,\ncomputer emergency response teams that\n\n2191\n01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:11,810\nare national, involved in their\ninfrastructure and their cyber defense.\n\n2192\n01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:15,340\nAnd so they will put out reports and\nupdates and finding on things they're\n\n2193\n01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:19,340\nseeing in the wild in terms of outbreaks\nand things like that that are happening,\n\n2194\n01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:23,030\nand they'll help each other cross\nborder to understand what to expect.\n\n2195\n01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:27,150\nAnd so looking at the US-CERT site for\ninstance, which would be a good thing for\n\n2196\n01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:29,740\nyou to do or some of the other sites,\n\n2197\n01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:33,870\nCanada maintains a CERT that is\nvery well respected and well known.\n\n2198\n01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:36,610\nSo you may just wanna go out.\n\n2199\n01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:38,900\nAnd look at one or\nmore of these websites and, you know,\n\n2200\n01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:40,570\njust stay up to date on\nwhat's going on with them.\n\n2201\n01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:45,080\nYou can see on the screen there for\nus the US-CERT.gov site that is there on,\n\n2202\n01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,925\nyou know, the computer emergency\nresponse team which is,\n\n2203\n01:45:47,925 --> 01:45:50,620\nas most things are today in the US,\nultimately managed and\n\n2204\n01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:54,590\nmaintained through Homeland Security but\nthere's a lot of overlap there.\n\n2205\n01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:56,510\nThis does involve cyber defense and\n\n2206\n01:45:56,510 --> 01:46:01,370\nit does involve government as well as\nmilitary as well as private sector\n\n2207\n01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:05,230\nresources that are brought to bear to\nreally help to understand how to do this.\n\n2208\n01:46:05,230 --> 01:46:07,920\nSo it could be a very\nvaluable resource for you.\n\n2209\n01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,280\nYou could see they have\ncontact information there,\n\n2210\n01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:14,020\nthey have web advisories, all sorts of\nstuff that's there, and I would encourage\n\n2211\n01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:17,590\nyou to start thinking about these,\njust looking at some headlines here.\n\n2212\n01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:22,350\nMozilla releases updates for Firefox,\nThunderbird, and Seamonkey there and\n\n2213\n01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:25,470\nsome sort of Microsoft related\nsecurity advisory has been announces.\n\n2214\n01:46:25,470 --> 01:46:28,250\nSo they're republishing and\nputting out this information.\n\n2215\n01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:31,080\nGoogle, surprising,\nhas security updates for Chrome.\n\n2216\n01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,240\nWho would've thought\nthat would've happened.\n\n2217\n01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:35,850\nSo nothing for Chromecast but\nsomething for Chrome.\n\n2218\n01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:40,520\nSo we can see obviously clearly that\nthere's a lot of information out there and\n\n2219\n01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,220\na lot of stuff that has to be available.\n\n2220\n01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:43,140\nAnd notice on the right,\n\n2221\n01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,720\nrecent vulnerabilities,\njust off on the right there, right?\n\n2222\n01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:48,560\nThe vulnerability matrix where\nwe're seeing by date and\n\n2223\n01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,770\ntimestamp, the vulnerabilities\nwith the tracking numbers.\n\n2224\n01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:53,940\nReally important those VU numbers, right?\n\n2225\n01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:55,270\nThe number or whatever.\n\n2226\n01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:58,740\nIt gives you the tracking matrix to\nbe able to go in and drill down.\n\n2227\n01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:00,070\nAnd can we just, randomly click on one?\n\n2228\n01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:01,220\nIt doesn't really matter which one.\n\n2229\n01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:02,080\nWhen we click on one and\n\n2230\n01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,540\nwe see it we'll just take a look\nat the CERT database here.\n\n2231\n01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:08,700\nThis brings up the vulnerability matrix\nand shows us what that scan looks like.\n\n2232\n01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:12,157\nCan you scroll a little bit towards\nthe left, your left, other way.\n\n2233\n01:47:12,157 --> 01:47:14,095\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I think that's [CROSSTALK]\n\n2234\n01:47:14,095 --> 01:47:15,471\n>> Okay yeah so no problem,\n\n2235\n01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:19,472\njust making sure you guys can see the edge\nof the screen there that we do see\n\n2236\n01:47:19,472 --> 01:47:24,170\nthat advisory, we do see the information\nof it, and we do see the description.\n\n2237\n01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:27,730\nAnd notice they have the impact,\nthe solution, vendor information,\n\n2238\n01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:30,340\nthe vendor that may or\nmay not be affected.\n\n2239\n01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:33,090\nWhen the vendor was notified,\nwhen they were updated, and\n\n2240\n01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:36,350\nall the metrics associated with it\nas well as references by the way.\n\n2241\n01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:40,590\nThey give you references to the vendor's\nsite to help you to understand things, and\n\n2242\n01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:44,750\nthe CVE, the common vulnerability\nidentifier, so the CVE number that tells\n\n2243\n01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:48,440\nyou in the master CVE database what\nthis particular vulnerability is.\n\n2244\n01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,030\nAll that is listed here.\n\n2245\n01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:53,090\nAnd so this is a great resource for\nyou as a security professional.\n\n2246\n01:47:53,090 --> 01:47:54,730\n>> Right.\n>> It tells you who reported it.\n\n2247\n01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:57,950\nSo, you know, in this case,\nWilliam Costa or somebody did.\n\n2248\n01:47:57,950 --> 01:48:01,265\nSo you want to make sure you understand\nthat and that this is really gonna be\n\n2249\n01:48:01,265 --> 01:48:04,925\nvaluable for you as a security\npractitioner to bring to the table, and\n\n2250\n01:48:04,925 --> 01:48:06,665\nbring in, bring that knowledge in-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2251\n01:48:06,665 --> 01:48:08,055\n>> To the organization.\n\n2252\n01:48:08,055 --> 01:48:10,135\nIf you're running the software,\nyou may not be running Webmin,\n\n2253\n01:48:10,135 --> 01:48:12,830\nin which case you may not really care\nabout this particular vulnerability.\n\n2254\n01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:14,375\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But knowing about the fact that\n\n2255\n01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:15,735\nyou can find information on the ones you\n\n2256\n01:48:15,735 --> 01:48:16,495\nare running,-\n>> Yep.\n\n2257\n01:48:16,495 --> 01:48:17,385\n>> It's gonna be very valuable.\n\n2258\n01:48:17,385 --> 01:48:20,545\nSo if you haven't checked it out,\ndefinitely do take the time to do that.\n\n2259\n01:48:20,545 --> 01:48:22,105\nMike, thank you for\nbringing that up for us.\n\n2260\n01:48:22,105 --> 01:48:23,955\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n>> We'll make sure we put that URL in\n\n2261\n01:48:23,955 --> 01:48:25,370\nthe the running notes for\n\n2262\n01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:27,180\nyou and make sure that's available\nat the end of the broadcast.\n\n2263\n01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:30,198\nSo Mike'll do that while we're talking and\njust capture that for you.\n\n2264\n01:48:30,198 --> 01:48:34,210\nAnd so, incident response documentation,\nthe website's one example of that right,\n\n2265\n01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:36,410\nand very important for\nyou to be aware of that.\n\n2266\n01:48:36,410 --> 01:48:39,490\nAgain, other countries have CERTs and\nmake sure you go out and check for\n\n2267\n01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:40,540\nthem as well.\n\n2268\n01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:43,940\nIndonesia has one, there's several\nin Asia; several in Europe.\n\n2269\n01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:46,060\nGermany has one that's\nvery well respected.\n\n2270\n01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,710\nThe Netherlands do as well.\n\n2271\n01:48:47,710 --> 01:48:49,280\nSo, there's a lot of them out there.\n\n2272\n01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:53,050\nIn addition to that,\nthere's all sorts of documentation,\n\n2273\n01:48:53,050 --> 01:48:56,070\nincident reporting generically\ninside your organization.\n\n2274\n01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:59,460\nIt takes on many forms and in one of\nthe earlier broadcast, one of the earlier\n\n2275\n01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:03,830\nepisodes in the SSCP solution that we're\ngoing through and really helping you to\n\n2276\n01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:07,915\nunderstand as we manage through all of\nthe associated with the certification,\n\n2277\n01:49:07,915 --> 01:49:11,165\nwe talked a lot about policies and\nwhere to find policy templates.\n\n2278\n01:49:11,165 --> 01:49:14,865\nWe turned you on to the idea of\ngoing to the Sans reading room and\n\n2279\n01:49:14,865 --> 01:49:18,405\ntake a look at their policy library,\ndownloading some templates from there,\n\n2280\n01:49:18,405 --> 01:49:19,945\nthe PDF's, the word documents.\n\n2281\n01:49:19,945 --> 01:49:23,685\nSo you can find incident reporting\ntemplates out there on the web also.\n\n2282\n01:49:23,685 --> 01:49:27,600\nAnd this would be something potentially\nthat literally just a quick Google search,\n\n2283\n01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,990\nwill tend to find a lot of templates and\npotentially, some opportunity for\n\n2284\n01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:32,120\nyou to find some.\n\n2285\n01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:35,600\nYou may not have your own internally,\nmay never have had to write one, you may\n\n2286\n01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:39,320\nnot have seen one before and, as a result,\nyou may need a little help finding one.\n\n2287\n01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:42,970\nSo take a look at computer incident\nreports, or things like that.\n\n2288\n01:49:42,970 --> 01:49:46,250\nYou can see Mike is doing a little\nreal time evidence gathering for\n\n2289\n01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:47,820\nus in real time here while we're talking.\n\n2290\n01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:50,640\nYou know, so something in maybe\nthe generic incident report template,\n\n2291\n01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:52,205\nprobably something like that.\n\n2292\n01:49:52,205 --> 01:49:54,200\nRight, just to show you\nwhat it looks like.\n\n2293\n01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:58,970\nYou know, nothing too fancy there, but\nwe can zoom in real quick and we can see\n\n2294\n01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:02,810\nsays to be completed by staff within so\nmany hours of the incident, right?\n\n2295\n01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:06,320\nAnd although it's a little fuzzy,\nincident date, incident time, you know.\n\n2296\n01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,010\nIn this case this is about an injury or\nsomething,\n\n2297\n01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:10,910\nthis is not necessarily a computer one.\n\n2298\n01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:13,380\nBut that's okay,\nit's still has the general information.\n\n2299\n01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:17,360\nThe idea there, which is you know,\ncapture the relevent details of\n\n2300\n01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:20,690\nthe particular incident, document them,\nand make sure we know what they are.\n\n2301\n01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:22,430\nYou may want to put the word\ncomputer in front of it.\n\n2302\n01:50:22,430 --> 01:50:24,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> Just so we do the search and find it.\n\n2303\n01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:27,860\nThe idea generically is we're\ngonna capture that information,\n\n2304\n01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:31,562\nmake sure we document it and go out and\nget yourself a template, whatever that is.\n\n2305\n01:50:31,562 --> 01:50:34,340\nAgain, it doesn't really\nmatter necessarily\n\n2306\n01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:38,340\nwhere you get the template from,\nthere is no harm in borrowing somebody's\n\n2307\n01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:41,440\ntemplate as long as they've made\nit available for you to use.\n\n2308\n01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,620\nObviously don't want to\nborrow without permission.\n\n2309\n01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:46,630\nBut if it is publicly available\non the web and easily accessible,\n\n2310\n01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:50,480\nwhy not take it as starting point and\nuse it to build your response solution?\n\n2311\n01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:53,680\nSo do make sure you understand\nthe concept of incident reporting.\n\n2312\n01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:56,240\nIt will be important for\nyou to have that, right?\n\n2313\n01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:59,660\nSo notifying somebody when\nincidents have happened\n\n2314\n01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:02,000\nwhether it's through this\nkind of a report certainly.\n\n2315\n01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,560\nAlso alarms and vendor alerts.\n\n2316\n01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,680\nWe talked about using the US-CERT or\nthe C-CERT database and\n\n2317\n01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:11,401\nthe CVE vulnerabilities, making sure\nyou look at those kind of things and\n\n2318\n01:51:11,401 --> 01:51:15,380\nhaving a documented communication\npath as well is also very important.\n\n2319\n01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:17,810\nHave that policy and\nprocedure in line there.\n\n2320\n01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:21,210\nAnd we can see type of report there,\nso it has different things,\n\n2321\n01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:23,540\nagain, that could be associated with it.\n\n2322\n01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:26,570\nSo just make sure you're aware of that,\nright, and just use that.\n\n2323\n01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:31,220\nMaking sure that when we go to communicate\naround the incident, that we have a plan.\n\n2324\n01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:35,080\nThere's nothing worse than random\ninformation leaking out that\n\n2325\n01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:39,790\nmay not be substantiated, may or\nmay not be authorized to be given to other\n\n2326\n01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:43,930\npeople inside or outside the organization\nalong the way to getting to the truth.\n\n2327\n01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:47,213\nAnd it's not that we don't want to\ntell people the truth, but we want to\n\n2328\n01:51:47,213 --> 01:51:51,104\nultimately frame that conversation around\nthe idea of having command of the facts,\n\n2329\n01:51:51,104 --> 01:51:55,106\nclearly understanding what's been going\non, and then communicating in an effective\n\n2330\n01:51:55,106 --> 01:51:57,401\nand efficient way to\nexplain what has happened.\n\n2331\n01:51:57,401 --> 01:52:01,665\nAnd so that first response indication\nof what went on may not be the complete\n\n2332\n01:52:01,665 --> 01:52:02,280\npicture.\n\n2333\n01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:02,895\nRight?\n\n2334\n01:52:02,895 --> 01:52:03,569\n>> Right.\n\n2335\n01:52:03,569 --> 01:52:05,252\n>> In this heat of the moment,\nwe may be missing vital details.\n\n2336\n01:52:05,252 --> 01:52:05,948\n>> Yep.\n>> And so\n\n2337\n01:52:05,948 --> 01:52:09,303\nyou often see that companies are a little\nhesitant to communicate initially about\n\n2338\n01:52:09,303 --> 01:52:11,735\nincidents until they've really\ngathered all the facts and\n\n2339\n01:52:11,735 --> 01:52:14,712\nthey have a good understanding of what\nto do and then how to present that.\n\n2340\n01:52:14,712 --> 01:52:18,191\nAnd so we do talk about the fact\nthat communication of the incident,\n\n2341\n01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:20,692\nit's crucial to the overall\nmanagement of it and\n\n2342\n01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:24,170\nyou wanna make sure that only\nauthorized people speak to the press or\n\n2343\n01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:26,695\nspeak to law enforcement or\nwhoever that may be.\n\n2344\n01:52:26,695 --> 01:52:29,886\nWe don't want unauthorized leaks and\nyou often hear about those things.\n\n2345\n01:52:29,886 --> 01:52:32,978\nWe didn't do it on the record,\nbut off the record, unofficially,\n\n2346\n01:52:32,978 --> 01:52:34,994\nwe can't tell you who, but they said this.\n\n2347\n01:52:34,994 --> 01:52:36,492\nWell, that may or not be accurate.\n\n2348\n01:52:36,492 --> 01:52:39,150\nWe wanna make sure we give\nout accurate information.\n\n2349\n01:52:39,150 --> 01:52:42,934\nSo we wanna make sure that we, obviously,\nprovide factual information that's been\n\n2350\n01:52:42,934 --> 01:52:45,686\nreferenced based on understanding\nof the incidents in hand.\n\n2351\n01:52:45,686 --> 01:52:49,118\nCommunication, bottom line as\na practitioner just understand.\n\n2352\n01:52:49,118 --> 01:52:52,714\nOnly handled by authorized appointed\nrepresentatives of the business,\n\n2353\n01:52:52,714 --> 01:52:53,761\nwhoever that may be.\n\n2354\n01:52:53,761 --> 01:52:56,678\nWe don't know who that is and\nit may be a chief security officer,\n\n2355\n01:52:56,678 --> 01:52:58,254\nit could be an IT representative.\n\n2356\n01:52:58,254 --> 01:53:01,295\nBut whoever speaks on behalf\nof that organization.\n\n2357\n01:53:01,295 --> 01:53:05,673\nLot of times when you see news reports\non a police investigation for instance.\n\n2358\n01:53:05,673 --> 01:53:08,968\nYou often see that there is\na police departments spokes person,\n\n2359\n01:53:08,968 --> 01:53:10,932\nwhoever that is that's identified.\n\n2360\n01:53:10,932 --> 01:53:13,740\nThey often come out and\nbrief the press and they will say, okay,\n\n2361\n01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:17,488\nthis is what's going on with this incident\nand they are very well dressed typically,\n\n2362\n01:53:17,488 --> 01:53:18,651\nthey look professional.\n\n2363\n01:53:18,651 --> 01:53:20,313\nThey may or may not be in uniform.\n\n2364\n01:53:20,313 --> 01:53:23,510\nA lot of times they dress more like\ncivilians, so they may not be in\n\n2365\n01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:27,174\na uniform, but they're really out\nthere as the face of the organization,\n\n2366\n01:53:27,174 --> 01:53:29,228\nthe official voice of the organization.\n\n2367\n01:53:29,228 --> 01:53:30,641\nAnd that's really how we speak and\n\n2368\n01:53:30,641 --> 01:53:34,069\nthat's what we wanna understand we need to\ndo when it comes to incidence response.\n\n2369\n01:53:34,069 --> 01:53:36,867\nSo again, just be aware of that, and make\nsure you're familiar with that as well.\n\n2370\n01:53:36,867 --> 01:53:39,188\nGood little item there to keep\nin the back of your mind.\n\n2371\n01:53:39,188 --> 01:53:40,784\nBoth in the professional practice,\n\n2372\n01:53:40,784 --> 01:53:44,030\nthe real world and also as you think\nabout preparing answers to questions.\n\n2373\n01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:46,372\nMay be something that you\njust wanna be aware of.\n\n2374\n01:53:46,372 --> 01:53:50,160\nAnd so response activities tend to\nfall into three categories within\n\n2375\n01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,337\nincident response,\n\n2376\n01:53:51,337 --> 01:53:55,659\nwe tend to see containment, we tend to\nsee analysis, we tend to see tracking.\n\n2377\n01:53:55,659 --> 01:53:57,900\nWe talked about each of these and\ntalked about what they are.\n\n2378\n01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:59,411\nI just wanna remind you those and\n\n2379\n01:53:59,411 --> 01:54:02,715\nmake sure you are familiar with them\nas we laid out that entire timeline\n\n2380\n01:54:02,715 --> 01:54:05,920\nthere under response,\ncontainment analysis and tracking.\n\n2381\n01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,915\nSo just making sure you're really\nfocused in on those things and\n\n2382\n01:54:08,915 --> 01:54:11,530\nunderstand what they are,\nis gonna be very important.\n\n2383\n01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:14,187\nLet's turn our attention\na little bit to forensics.\n\n2384\n01:54:14,187 --> 01:54:18,922\nNo good discussion Incident handling and\nincident analysis would be complete\n\n2385\n01:54:18,922 --> 01:54:21,059\nwithout the CSI reference-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2386\n01:54:21,059 --> 01:54:23,306\n>> And the computer forensics concept all\n\n2387\n01:54:23,306 --> 01:54:24,262\nthe rage today.\n\n2388\n01:54:24,262 --> 01:54:29,233\nIt's not quite as sexy and exciting,\nby the way, boys and girls as it is on TV.\n\n2389\n01:54:29,233 --> 01:54:31,740\nHaving done a lot of it, I can tell\nyou it's no where near as exciting.\n\n2390\n01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,283\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We don't tend to go out and\n\n2391\n01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:33,979\ndo all those things.\n\n2392\n01:54:33,979 --> 01:54:35,141\nWe don't tend to fire guns.\n\n2393\n01:54:35,141 --> 01:54:37,222\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least not officially for\n\n2394\n01:54:37,222 --> 01:54:38,019\nwork, anyway.\n\n2395\n01:54:38,019 --> 01:54:40,914\nAnd as a result of that, it can be\nvery boring and tedious work, but\n\n2396\n01:54:40,914 --> 01:54:42,170\nI wanna make it clear to you.\n\n2397\n01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:44,811\nI'm not suggesting for\na minute it's not important work But\n\n2398\n01:54:44,811 --> 01:54:46,430\nyou have to put this in perspective.\n\n2399\n01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:50,991\nThis work is typically done, you're in\na lab somewhere at a bench with a computer\n\n2400\n01:54:50,991 --> 01:54:54,952\nand a bunch of tools around how to\nmanipulate and manage information,\n\n2401\n01:54:54,952 --> 01:54:57,971\neither in memory in real time\nwhile the machine is on or\n\n2402\n01:54:57,971 --> 01:55:00,276\nis digital information on a hard drive.\n\n2403\n01:55:00,276 --> 01:55:03,610\nAnd this is not typically done\nin the field at a crime scene.\n\n2404\n01:55:03,610 --> 01:55:05,131\n>> It's a really controlled\nenvironment that we work in.\n\n2405\n01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:05,851\n>> Absolutely.\n\n2406\n01:55:05,851 --> 01:55:07,196\nWe tend to take those machines.\n\n2407\n01:55:07,196 --> 01:55:10,714\nWe may capture certain information from\nthem in real time from in the field before\n\n2408\n01:55:10,714 --> 01:55:11,654\nthey get turned off.\n\n2409\n01:55:11,654 --> 01:55:15,972\nBut then a lot of that information is\nthen worked on in a dull, boring cubicle\n\n2410\n01:55:15,972 --> 01:55:20,235\nsomewhere and you don't spend a lot of\ntime looking pretty for the camera.\n\n2411\n01:55:20,235 --> 01:55:21,742\n>> Don't you love it when\nthey go to the config,\n\n2412\n01:55:21,742 --> 01:55:23,614\nthey get into this place where\nthis crime has occurred.\n\n2413\n01:55:23,614 --> 01:55:26,176\nThey sit down at the computer and\nthey just start opening things up and\n\n2414\n01:55:26,176 --> 01:55:27,293\nbrowsing through the email.\n\n2415\n01:55:27,293 --> 01:55:30,141\n>> Because you know that happens,\nyou can automatically do that and\n\n2416\n01:55:30,141 --> 01:55:31,554\nyou have all that information.\n\n2417\n01:55:31,554 --> 01:55:32,110\n>> Yeah.\n\n2418\n01:55:32,110 --> 01:55:34,435\n>> And you know how to do that without\nblowing up all the evidence and\n\n2419\n01:55:34,435 --> 01:55:35,654\nwithout rendering it unusable.\n\n2420\n01:55:35,654 --> 01:55:36,431\n>> There's the thing.\n\n2421\n01:55:36,431 --> 01:55:38,335\nAre you gonna be able to\ntake that to court later on?\n\n2422\n01:55:38,335 --> 01:55:42,629\n>> Absolutely not,\nwhich brings up a very good point.\n\n2423\n01:55:42,629 --> 01:55:45,386\nWe'll talk about chain of custody\nof evidence and the crime scene and\n\n2424\n01:55:45,386 --> 01:55:48,630\nall that is part of forensics, but\nreally it's kicking off this conversation.\n\n2425\n01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:52,809\nThe reason I mention this is that I often\nget asked about this when I talk about\n\n2426\n01:55:52,809 --> 01:55:56,675\nsecurity and I do forensics work, so\nI do get asked about this as well.\n\n2427\n01:55:56,675 --> 01:55:59,090\nHey, is this something I\nmight be interested in doing?\n\n2428\n01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:00,147\nIs it really that cool?\n\n2429\n01:56:00,147 --> 01:56:02,412\nYou get to use all those cool tools.\n\n2430\n01:56:02,412 --> 01:56:04,795\nDo you have the 60 foot\nby 60 foot video display?\n\n2431\n01:56:04,795 --> 01:56:06,625\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can throw things in the air and\n\n2432\n01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:07,141\nit shows up.\n\n2433\n01:56:07,141 --> 01:56:09,048\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Not unless you work for\n\n2434\n01:56:09,048 --> 01:56:11,679\na television production company, no.\n\n2435\n01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:15,113\nCuz very few forensic labs I've been\nin have anything like that kind of\n\n2436\n01:56:15,113 --> 01:56:19,318\ntechnology, you're lucky if you have a\ncoffee maker that's from the last century.\n\n2437\n01:56:19,318 --> 01:56:22,042\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So as a result of that, it is very,\n\n2438\n01:56:22,042 --> 01:56:23,753\nvery, very detailed.\n\n2439\n01:56:23,753 --> 01:56:26,516\nVery, very interesting work,\nbut you have to put it context.\n\n2440\n01:56:26,516 --> 01:56:30,509\nIt's the kind of work that gets done\nbehind the scenes that often leads to\n\n2441\n01:56:30,509 --> 01:56:35,093\nthe breakthroughs in the case that we need\nto understand in order to be successful at\n\n2442\n01:56:35,093 --> 01:56:38,323\ncreating a prosecution event\nthat leads to a conviction.\n\n2443\n01:56:38,323 --> 01:56:41,468\nBut at the end of the day, it's often\nthe unglamorous work that often goes\n\n2444\n01:56:41,468 --> 01:56:43,664\nuncelebrated that's done\nin the forensics area.\n\n2445\n01:56:43,664 --> 01:56:46,940\nAnd when you talk to forensics examiners\nthat are very good at what they do,\n\n2446\n01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:47,831\nthey will tell you.\n\n2447\n01:56:47,831 --> 01:56:52,080\nThey're very good at detail management,\nthey're very good at being focused on what\n\n2448\n01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:55,326\nthey do and that a lot of it is\nrepetitive work day in day out time and\n\n2449\n01:56:55,326 --> 01:56:57,527\ntime again around analyzing information.\n\n2450\n01:56:57,527 --> 01:57:01,043\nAnd so it is not necessarily gonna be\nthe kind of thing, where we have all\n\n2451\n01:57:01,043 --> 01:57:04,516\nthe bells and whistles going off and\nthe alarms and that kind of stuff.\n\n2452\n01:57:04,516 --> 01:57:08,479\nIt's very quiet work done basically in an\noffice, undisturbed and typically done in\n\n2453\n01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:12,183\na very methodical way and that's really\nvery important for you to understand.\n\n2454\n01:57:12,183 --> 01:57:15,527\nSo understand that management of\nthe crime scene becomes critical.\n\n2455\n01:57:15,527 --> 01:57:18,510\nMike and I were just talking about\nthe idea that you come in, sit down and\n\n2456\n01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:21,425\nopen up the computer and start hacking\naway and do all sorts of stuff.\n\n2457\n01:57:21,425 --> 01:57:24,870\nYou basically, blew the case before you\neven started if you do that, because\n\n2458\n01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:28,588\nthe minute you touch that computer, you\nhave modified the state its currently in.\n\n2459\n01:57:28,588 --> 01:57:32,295\nIf the computer was part of a crime that\nwas being committed or was the vessel,\n\n2460\n01:57:32,295 --> 01:57:35,101\nwhich the computer was actually\nused to commit the crime.\n\n2461\n01:57:35,101 --> 01:57:39,099\nEither way, we have to preserve that state\nof evidence in order to establish what's\n\n2462\n01:57:39,099 --> 01:57:42,532\ncalled a chain of custody of evidence\nto make sure that we can then use that\n\n2463\n01:57:42,532 --> 01:57:44,477\nevidence down the road in a court of law.\n\n2464\n01:57:44,477 --> 01:57:47,357\nSo we have to really understand that and\nbe wary of that.\n\n2465\n01:57:47,357 --> 01:57:50,641\nWe don't sit down and try to surf the web\nand check our email on that computer\n\n2466\n01:57:50,641 --> 01:57:54,055\nto find out what the boss said about\nbringing the computer back to the office.\n\n2467\n01:57:54,055 --> 01:57:55,621\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because of we do that we're done.\n\n2468\n01:57:55,621 --> 01:57:57,929\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just make sure that you're aware,\n\n2469\n01:57:57,929 --> 01:58:01,548\nyou'd be surprised the stories I hear\nabout and the things I've seen in\n\n2470\n01:58:01,548 --> 01:58:05,711\nthe field over the years, where people\nunfortunately, because of awareness and\n\n2471\n01:58:05,711 --> 01:58:10,105\nlack thereof, have nor been trained\n>> Somebody who's a first responder that\n\n2472\n01:58:10,105 --> 01:58:14,574\nshows up and means well is not the same\nthing as a trained responder that\n\n2473\n01:58:14,574 --> 01:58:17,481\nunderstands how to deal\nwith this evidence.\n\n2474\n01:58:17,481 --> 01:58:20,083\nAnd we want those first responders\nto do the right thing, but\n\n2475\n01:58:20,083 --> 01:58:23,670\nwe also want them to understand there are\nlimitations to what they should be doing.\n\n2476\n01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:26,793\nSo this is where we really get into\nthe rub about how to manage that.\n\n2477\n01:58:26,793 --> 01:58:30,915\nAnd so make sure you need to identify\nthe scene, protect the environment.\n\n2478\n01:58:30,915 --> 01:58:33,610\nMake sure we understand how to\ndo that Identify evidence or\n\n2479\n01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:35,154\npotential sources of evidence.\n\n2480\n01:58:35,154 --> 01:58:39,252\nMake sure we collect that evidence\nin a logical, systematic, detailed,\n\n2481\n01:58:39,252 --> 01:58:44,011\ndocumented way and then minimize, if at\nall possible, the degree of contamination.\n\n2482\n01:58:44,011 --> 01:58:45,675\nWe often see this in the movies,\n\n2483\n01:58:45,675 --> 01:58:49,386\nwhere they put up the yellow tape\naround a police crime investigation.\n\n2484\n01:58:49,386 --> 01:58:51,533\nSomebody comes in,\ntramples all over the whole area.\n\n2485\n01:58:51,533 --> 01:58:53,265\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What are you doing walking on my crime\n\n2486\n01:58:53,265 --> 01:58:54,227\nscene and doing all of this?\n\n2487\n01:58:54,227 --> 01:58:56,494\nYou hear about these things\nlike elimination prints,\n\n2488\n01:58:56,494 --> 01:58:59,252\nthey have to take to make sure they\nget rid of the prints that the team\n\n2489\n01:58:59,252 --> 01:59:01,785\nthat was there may have put on\nthe initial first responders.\n\n2490\n01:59:01,785 --> 01:59:03,350\nThe EMTs, things like that.\n\n2491\n01:59:03,350 --> 01:59:06,951\nSo they have to eliminate them and\ncertain kinds of crimes.\n\n2492\n01:59:06,951 --> 01:59:07,612\n>> Yeah.\n\n2493\n01:59:07,612 --> 01:59:09,504\n>> And so these kind of things\nhave to be thought about.\n\n2494\n01:59:09,504 --> 01:59:11,816\nWhen you walk up and\nlook at a crime scene,\n\n2495\n01:59:11,816 --> 01:59:14,472\nthe last thing you want\nto do is touch anything.\n\n2496\n01:59:14,472 --> 01:59:17,351\nThe absolute last thing\nyou do is touch anything.\n\n2497\n01:59:17,351 --> 01:59:20,024\nYou look at everything, you put on gloves.\n\n2498\n01:59:20,024 --> 01:59:24,026\nYou get out a camera, you take a million\npictures of everything, where it is and\n\n2499\n01:59:24,026 --> 01:59:25,541\nwhat condition it was found.\n\n2500\n01:59:25,541 --> 01:59:29,559\nWhat was plugged into what,\nlabel anything you may find on the ground.\n\n2501\n01:59:29,559 --> 01:59:33,050\nIf you find a broken USB memory\nstick laying by the computer,\n\n2502\n01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:35,040\nyou put a little number next to it.\n\n2503\n01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,517\nYou take a picture of it, so\n\n2504\n01:59:36,517 --> 01:59:39,939\nyou can identify it later as\nnumber five in the evidence chain.\n\n2505\n01:59:39,939 --> 01:59:43,059\nAnd then before anything is taken up and\nbagged and tagged as we say,\n\n2506\n01:59:43,059 --> 01:59:46,087\nPhotographs of it in context\naround the environment were taken.\n\n2507\n01:59:46,087 --> 01:59:47,955\n>> Where was it found,\nwhat was its position.\n\n2508\n01:59:47,955 --> 01:59:48,593\n>> Exactly.\n\n2509\n01:59:48,593 --> 01:59:49,151\nAll that stuff.\n\n2510\n01:59:49,151 --> 01:59:52,726\nAnd what we often miss in computer\nforensics is the wiring on the back of\n\n2511\n01:59:52,726 --> 01:59:53,459\nthe machine.\n\n2512\n01:59:53,459 --> 01:59:56,109\nAnd things that are plugged in\nto the front of the machine or\n\n2513\n01:59:56,109 --> 01:59:57,677\nwhere the machine sat on the desk,\n\n2514\n01:59:57,677 --> 02:00:01,412\nbecause we have to reproduce that entire\nstructure that architecture to validate\n\n2515\n02:00:01,412 --> 02:00:05,010\nthat the evidence that we found is indeed\nthe way we found it when we go to court.\n\n2516\n02:00:05,010 --> 02:00:08,998\nAnd if we can't reproduce the wiring\nThe diagram [INAUDIBLE] showing.\n\n2517\n02:00:08,998 --> 02:00:10,879\nWhat was plugged into\nthe back of the computer.\n\n2518\n02:00:10,879 --> 02:00:14,190\nWas it the primary network cable\nplugged into the main onboard one, or\n\n2519\n02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:16,830\nthe secondary adapter,\nthose kind of things?\n\n2520\n02:00:16,830 --> 02:00:20,110\nWe could actually be in for a problem,\nbecause the prosecuting attorney or\n\n2521\n02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:22,190\nthe defense attorney may\ndisagree about whether or\n\n2522\n02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:24,070\nnot that evidence is gonna be important.\n\n2523\n02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:26,860\nAnd one is, I promise you,\ngonna push the other to get it thrown out,\n\n2524\n02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:29,620\nbecause you can't document\nthat it was plugged in there.\n\n2525\n02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:32,390\nAnd if you can't tell me it was plugged in\nthere unequivocably I'm gonna tell you it\n\n2526\n02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:36,290\nwasn't, and if it wasn't then maybe\nthat case that your trying to prosecute\n\n2527\n02:00:36,290 --> 02:00:37,955\nmay not actually mean the same thing.\n\n2528\n02:00:37,955 --> 02:00:38,518\n>> Exactly.\n\n2529\n02:00:38,518 --> 02:00:41,139\n>> So then this becomes really important\nwhen we talk about first responders.\n\n2530\n02:00:41,139 --> 02:00:43,658\nSo make sure we understand how\nto deal with a crime scene.\n\n2531\n02:00:43,658 --> 02:00:47,497\nIt's very rare you get to show up and\ndeal with a crime scene unless you're paid\n\n2532\n02:00:47,497 --> 02:00:51,454\nprofessionally to do so right I mean\nunless you're computer front investigator\n\n2533\n02:00:51,454 --> 02:00:55,310\nthis is not something you do normally But\neven then, you know, common sense.\n\n2534\n02:00:55,310 --> 02:00:58,120\nWe keep coming back to that\nidea of employing common sense\n\n2535\n02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:00,530\nas the most important tool\nin the security toolkit.\n\n2536\n02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:05,695\nIf you walk into a room and something\nis wrong, obviously safe, guard, life.\n\n2537\n02:01:05,695 --> 02:01:06,765\nWe talked about the code of ethics.\n\n2538\n02:01:06,765 --> 02:01:09,145\nHelp that person,\nmake sure they get the help they need.\n\n2539\n02:01:09,145 --> 02:01:11,525\nForget about what's going on with\nthe computer for the moment.\n\n2540\n02:01:11,525 --> 02:01:15,595\nBut when that person is safe, if there\nis indeed potentially a life that may be\n\n2541\n02:01:15,595 --> 02:01:20,355\nin jeopardy if somebody needs help,\nonce that person is safe, then back up and\n\n2542\n02:01:20,355 --> 02:01:23,975\nthink through and assess the situation\nbefore anything happens.\n\n2543\n02:01:23,975 --> 02:01:25,715\nDon't run up and unplug the computer.\n\n2544\n02:01:25,715 --> 02:01:28,335\nBecause you're gonna destroy all\nthe evidence that might have been on\n\n2545\n02:01:28,335 --> 02:01:30,908\nthe screen, right, in real time\nbecause you blew out the memory.\n\n2546\n02:01:30,908 --> 02:01:34,804\n>> Mm-hm [CROSSTALK] Right,\nvery important, so courts and evidence,\n\n2547\n02:01:34,804 --> 02:01:36,895\nwhat is admissible in a court of law?\n\n2548\n02:01:36,895 --> 02:01:38,390\n>> Mm-hm\n>> How do we know that?\n\n2549\n02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:40,690\nAnd so this ability, very important.\n\n2550\n02:01:40,690 --> 02:01:45,220\nEvidence can be graded along different\nlines based on whether it is first or\n\n2551\n02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:49,930\nbest kind of evidence, hearsay, secondary,\ntertiary, quaternary kind of evidence and\n\n2552\n02:01:49,930 --> 02:01:51,440\nmaybe down the chain that may or\n\n2553\n02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:53,820\nmay not be admissible is very\nimportant to think about.\n\n2554\n02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:57,300\nAnd this idea of chain of\nevidence is also critical.\n\n2555\n02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:59,320\nAdmissibility is a one way street right.\n\n2556\n02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:02,730\nIf you take evidence that may potentially\nbeen admissible as we talk about and\n\n2557\n02:02:02,730 --> 02:02:05,900\nbotch it, move it around,\nchange it, whatever.\n\n2558\n02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:07,240\nYou don't get a second chance at that.\n\n2559\n02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:11,280\nThe judge says hey I'm sorry,\nbut we can't go back in time, and\n\n2560\n02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:13,190\nas a result you don't get\nto play with that evidence.\n\n2561\n02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:14,410\nSo that's really important.\n\n2562\n02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:17,210\nBut the chain of evidence is what leads\nus to understand how to safeguard and\n\n2563\n02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:20,890\nsecure evidence, and so this is\nreally gonna be varying by country.\n\n2564\n02:02:20,890 --> 02:02:23,880\nDifferent countries have different laws\nof evidence, and you need to obviously\n\n2565\n02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:27,860\nlocalize this conservation to where you\nlive, where you practice and what you do.\n\n2566\n02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:32,460\nIn the US there are federal statutes that\nare at play here, around evidentiary law.\n\n2567\n02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:33,540\nAnd we're not getting into,\n\n2568\n02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:37,190\nspecifically in this exam,\nwhat the laws are by country.\n\n2569\n02:02:37,190 --> 02:02:39,980\nThis is not an exam about US federal law.\n\n2570\n02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:43,690\nThis is not an exam about the law\nin Germany, or the law in China, or\n\n2571\n02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:44,810\nwhatever that may be.\n\n2572\n02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:47,220\nBut it's about the broad idea\nthat regardless of country,\n\n2573\n02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:52,430\nregardless of law, you have to maintain\nreliable chain of evidence around,\n\n2574\n02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:56,830\nand custody of evidence around evidence\nto make it admissible in a court of law.\n\n2575\n02:02:56,830 --> 02:02:58,830\nSo complete records of custodianship and\n\n2576\n02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:02,090\nhandling need to be able to\nbe documented and produced.\n\n2577\n02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:04,030\nin order to establish a chain of evidence.\n\n2578\n02:03:04,030 --> 02:03:06,480\nAnd uncontestable proof\nof the possession and\n\n2579\n02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,790\nprotection of this evidence\nhas to be demonstrated.\n\n2580\n02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:12,890\nThose of you that are in the US and\nyou have been around for\n\n2581\n02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:16,460\na few years doing this, will probably\nremember the OJ Simpson trial.\n\n2582\n02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:19,720\nWe all probably do, especially if you\nlived in the US during that time.\n\n2583\n02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:21,610\nYou remember hearing the coverage of it.\n\n2584\n02:03:21,610 --> 02:03:24,760\nWhether or not at the end of\nthe day we think, or did think,\n\n2585\n02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:27,160\nor do think today that OJ Simpson did or\n\n2586\n02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:30,680\ndid not commit a crime is really\nirrelevant to the conversation, right?\n\n2587\n02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:34,610\nThe point there and really the way\nin which that trial was decided and\n\n2588\n02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:40,170\nthe genius of the lawyers involved,\nright, in terms of just\n\n2589\n02:03:40,170 --> 02:03:44,410\nbeing able to go through and prosecute\nthis and/or to defend OJ Simpson, right?\n\n2590\n02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:47,340\nSo the genius of really going through and\n\n2591\n02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:50,290\ntrying to figure out whether or\nnot He was guilty.\n\n2592\n02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:52,590\nAnd remember you had known\nanything about the trial,\n\n2593\n02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:55,910\nhe was found innocent in the criminal\ntrial but guilty in the civil trial.\n\n2594\n02:03:55,910 --> 02:04:00,710\nSo in effect what happened was he was\nfound innocent of committing a crime but\n\n2595\n02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:04,260\nheld accountable for committing the crime\nat the same time on the civil side,\n\n2596\n02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:07,580\nwith a penalty and obviously jail\ntime as a result of that as well.\n\n2597\n02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:12,200\nBut the reason he got off in the criminal\ntrial was that the chain of custody\n\n2598\n02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:16,950\nof evidence was challenged successfully\nby OJ Simpson's lawyer and\n\n2599\n02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:20,800\nhis team of lawyers, because they felt\nthat they could prove beyond a reasonable\n\n2600\n02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,640\ndoubt that the law\nenforcement officials and\n\n2601\n02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:27,570\nthe forensic officials that did the\nexamination had not handled the evidence,\n\n2602\n02:04:27,570 --> 02:04:30,840\nthe glove for instance and\nthe other things associated with it,\n\n2603\n02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:34,450\nin such a way that they could\nvalidate beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n2604\n02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:37,360\nAnd this is the key reasonable doubt,\nin the mind of the judge and\n\n2605\n02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:38,600\nthe mind of the jury,\n\n2606\n02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:41,460\nthat they could establish reasonable doubt\nabout the chain of custody of evidence.\n\n2607\n02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:45,180\nSo much so that ultimately, he was found\nnot guilty in that respect, right?\n\n2608\n02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:49,270\nAnd so, this is critical because they\ncould not establish a complete chain of\n\n2609\n02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:52,440\ncustody of evidence from the time it was\nfound until the time it showed up in\n\n2610\n02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:55,430\nthe courtroom, unequivocally, right,\nbeyond reproach and beyond doubt.\n\n2611\n02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:59,030\nAnd so we want to make sure we think\nabout that, and that we understand that.\n\n2612\n02:04:59,030 --> 02:05:01,960\nAnd that we understand that the chain\nof evidence is really, really crucial.\n\n2613\n02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:05,050\nAnd so to be admissible evidence\nmust satisfy some rules.\n\n2614\n02:05:05,050 --> 02:05:07,000\nAnd let's talk about what those rules are.\n\n2615\n02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,680\nHave to have, as we said,\na proven chain of custody.\n\n2616\n02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,500\nThat's very important.\n\n2617\n02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:13,460\nSo to be admissible in a court\nof law We have to be able\n\n2618\n02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:14,950\nto prove the chain of custody.\n\n2619\n02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:17,840\nWe have to see evidence as\nbeing authentic, right.\n\n2620\n02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:18,810\nSo it has to be authentic.\n\n2621\n02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:21,730\nIt has to be complete.\n\n2622\n02:05:21,730 --> 02:05:26,960\nSo we have to have authentic evidence,\nwe have to have complete evidence.\n\n2623\n02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,770\nWe have to have accurate evidence.\n\n2624\n02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:33,960\nSo we have to have authentic,\ncomplete, accurate as well convincing.\n\n2625\n02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:37,770\nThese are all things that\nhave to be established.\n\n2626\n02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:41,705\nSo when we talk about authentic we have to\nmake sure that really is the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n2627\n02:05:41,705 --> 02:05:43,025\nEvidence that was found there.\n\n2628\n02:05:43,025 --> 02:05:45,055\nWhen we talk about it being complete,\nit has to be all the evidence.\n\n2629\n02:05:45,055 --> 02:05:46,565\nWe talked about taking pictures,-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2630\n02:05:46,565 --> 02:05:49,675\n>> Making sure we capture the wiring and\nthings like that.\n\n2631\n02:05:49,675 --> 02:05:52,925\nIt has to be accurate, it has to represent\nthe state in which the evidence was found.\n\n2632\n02:05:52,925 --> 02:05:54,707\nIt has to be convincing and compelling.\n\n2633\n02:05:54,707 --> 02:05:57,177\nHas to actually speak to\nthe fact that this evidence\n\n2634\n02:05:57,177 --> 02:05:59,787\nsomehow impacts on this\nparticular solution.\n\n2635\n02:05:59,787 --> 02:06:01,797\nAnd so when we think about\nchain of custody for evidence,\n\n2636\n02:06:01,797 --> 02:06:03,757\nwe wanna ask questions, right?\n\n2637\n02:06:03,757 --> 02:06:07,067\nThe questions we normally ask, and\nthese are pretty standard questions.\n\n2638\n02:06:07,067 --> 02:06:09,167\nThe who, what, when, where, and how.\n\n2639\n02:06:09,167 --> 02:06:12,437\nRight, these are the four\nWs as opposed to the five.\n\n2640\n02:06:12,437 --> 02:06:13,057\nAnd the H.\n\n2641\n02:06:13,057 --> 02:06:15,017\nBut the who, what when, where, and how.\n\n2642\n02:06:15,017 --> 02:06:22,460\nThe five questions But the who, the what,\nthe when, the where and the how\n\n2643\n02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:26,650\nof evidence when it comes to chain of\ncustody becomes really, really important\n\n2644\n02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:30,400\nto establish the viability of the evidence\nof the chain of custody of this evidence.\n\n2645\n02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,760\nJust want to make sure that\nwe understand that and\n\n2646\n02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:35,140\nwe speak to that as we go to establish it.\n\n2647\n02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:37,580\nWhen we talk about identifying evidence,\nright,\n\n2648\n02:06:37,580 --> 02:06:39,790\nwe talk about understanding\nwhat the evidence is.\n\n2649\n02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:42,810\nWhen we collect it, we have to use\nthe appropriate collection techniques.\n\n2650\n02:06:42,810 --> 02:06:44,370\nWe talked about putting on gloves.\n\n2651\n02:06:44,370 --> 02:06:48,050\nWe talked about making sure that we\ncapture the running state of computers and\n\n2652\n02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:49,120\ndevices.\n\n2653\n02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:51,380\nSo we have to use special tools\nin order to be able to do that,\n\n2654\n02:06:51,380 --> 02:06:52,890\nto dump the memory in effect.\n\n2655\n02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:56,770\nIf it's a cell phone, we have to make sure\nwe plug it in to a battery, rather plug\n\n2656\n02:06:56,770 --> 02:06:59,440\nthe cell phone with the battery\ninto a charger, to keep it running,\n\n2657\n02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:02,710\nto keep it powered on to capture\nthe memory state so we can download it.\n\n2658\n02:07:02,710 --> 02:07:05,500\nWe have to make sure, if it's\nsomething like a router, that we don't\n\n2659\n02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:09,270\ncycle power cycle the router, because we\nlose the running config of the router,\n\n2660\n02:07:09,270 --> 02:07:12,310\nwhich can be different from\nthe actual store config.\n\n2661\n02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:14,608\nOne of the old hacking tricks\nwe would often use, and\n\n2662\n02:07:14,608 --> 02:07:17,520\nwe talked a lot about\nthis in hacking classes.\n\n2663\n02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:21,310\nFor instance, when I teach hacking\nclasses, is that you can actually change\n\n2664\n02:07:21,310 --> 02:07:24,420\nthe running config of a router\nin real time while it's running,\n\n2665\n02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:27,680\nif you have the right passwords of course,\nbut not save that back Hack in and\n\n2666\n02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:30,050\nestablish or\neffectively change the stored config.\n\n2667\n02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:31,410\n>> So when you're done?\n\n2668\n02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:33,970\n>> You just power cycle the router,\nthe config disappears.\n\n2669\n02:07:33,970 --> 02:07:37,380\nIn effect, the backdoor you just created\nalong with all the evidence of that\n\n2670\n02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:39,320\nis wiped out when the router\ngets power cycled.\n\n2671\n02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:42,997\nSo the hacker will effectively tap\nthe router, change the running config in\n\n2672\n02:07:42,997 --> 02:07:46,559\nreal-time to modify the entry and\nexit points, execute the attack, and\n\n2673\n02:07:46,559 --> 02:07:49,545\nthen on the way out,\nbasically just power cycle the router and\n\n2674\n02:07:49,545 --> 02:07:52,552\nwipe out the evidence of having\nbeen there in the first place.\n\n2675\n02:07:52,552 --> 02:07:55,742\nIf they're smart, they'll also\ntake out the log files, and or\n\n2676\n02:07:55,742 --> 02:07:59,244\nthe logging servants being used to\ncapture that on the way out as well.\n\n2677\n02:07:59,244 --> 02:08:01,926\nAnd by doing this effectively,\nwe're ghosts, right.\n\n2678\n02:08:01,926 --> 02:08:04,692\nWe stealth ourselves There's no way for\nyou to go back and\n\n2679\n02:08:04,692 --> 02:08:07,689\nforensically examine that router and\nunderstand what I did,\n\n2680\n02:08:07,689 --> 02:08:11,590\nbecause the effective evidence that\nwould have been there in memory is gone.\n\n2681\n02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:12,330\nIt doesn't exist.\n\n2682\n02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:13,900\nIt's basically vaporware.\n\n2683\n02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:16,600\nWe used to refer to this\nas a stealth attack.\n\n2684\n02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:18,680\nAnd in some cases, we still do.\n\n2685\n02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:22,900\n>> And if we're not careful,\nwe can end up doing that for them.\n\n2686\n02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:23,880\n>> We could do that for them.\n\n2687\n02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:25,385\n[CROSSTALK] Because the minute\nyou come in and do that,\n\n2688\n02:08:25,385 --> 02:08:26,957\nyou effectively have done\nexactly what the hacker may or\n\n2689\n02:08:26,957 --> 02:08:28,541\nmay not have done on their\nway out of the system, right?\n\n2690\n02:08:28,541 --> 02:08:29,086\n>> Yeah.\n\n2691\n02:08:29,086 --> 02:08:31,560\n[LAUGH]\n>> So every important as well, right?\n\n2692\n02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:34,320\nSo types of digital evidence,\nnow we talked about forensics and\n\n2693\n02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:35,930\nreally the chain of evidence and\nunderstanding it.\n\n2694\n02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:37,790\nLet's talk about the types of evidence and\n\n2695\n02:08:37,790 --> 02:08:41,260\ntypes of digital evidence specifically,\nthree different ways to do distinct\n\n2696\n02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:45,210\nanalysis specifically on\nthese digital evidence items.\n\n2697\n02:08:45,210 --> 02:08:49,460\nWe could do media analysis, right, so\nanalyzing the physical media for evidence.\n\n2698\n02:08:49,460 --> 02:08:52,150\nThis would be maybe\nlooking at a hard drive or\n\n2699\n02:08:52,150 --> 02:08:55,440\nlooking at a USB memory stick or\nthings like that.\n\n2700\n02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:59,020\nWe can look at software analysis so\nwe can review the software.\n\n2701\n02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:01,520\nSee what's in log files and\nthings like that.\n\n2702\n02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,740\nLook at the code\nthe underlying code itself,\n\n2703\n02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:05,510\nsee if maybe the code's been modified.\n\n2704\n02:09:05,510 --> 02:09:08,260\nLook at digital signatures on files and\n\n2705\n02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:09,070\nfile identifiers\n>> Right.\n\n2706\n02:09:09,070 --> 02:09:11,220\n>> And see if they've been modified.\n\n2707\n02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:14,170\nWe can look at network analysis and\nscrutinize network traffic and\n\n2708\n02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:18,410\nlogs, and understand what's happening\nthere with the transfer of information.\n\n2709\n02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:22,040\nAll three of these areas are ways in\nwhich we analyze digital evidence.\n\n2710\n02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:22,910\nAs a practitioner,\n\n2711\n02:09:22,910 --> 02:09:26,370\nyou wanna be familiar with them, you wanna\nhave a good working examples of them.\n\n2712\n02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:30,040\nAnd you wanna make sure you\nunderstand how they are applied in\n\n2713\n02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:32,240\nrelation to digital analysis of evidence,\nbut\n\n2714\n02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:35,570\nalso in relation to the forensics\nconversation we are having.\n\n2715\n02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:39,380\nIt's also very important to think about\nthat, and just understand that, right?\n\n2716\n02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:44,290\nAnd so when we look at digital analysis,\nor digital evidence analysis,\n\n2717\n02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:45,350\nlook at forensics.\n\n2718\n02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:47,460\nWe also want to think about recovery and\nfollow up.\n\n2719\n02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:49,920\nThis is kind of the last\narea that we spoke about.\n\n2720\n02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:52,290\nObviously we want to repair\nthe system there, right?\n\n2721\n02:09:52,290 --> 02:09:54,120\nWant to talk about how we back up,\n\n2722\n02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:57,070\nclean up the system,\nclose the vulnerabilities that are there.\n\n2723\n02:09:57,070 --> 02:10:00,010\nWe talked about those things,\nobviously following up and\n\n2724\n02:10:00,010 --> 02:10:03,290\npreventing this from happening again\nby documenting, patching things of that\n\n2725\n02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:07,580\nnature, all very important for\nus to consider and to be aware of.\n\n2726\n02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:11,250\nThere are established guidelines for\nforensic practices out there.\n\n2727\n02:10:11,250 --> 02:10:14,860\nThere are some international\nstandard bodies that will have\n\n2728\n02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:17,240\nrecommendations that\nyou may want to follow.\n\n2729\n02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:21,380\nOne of them is the International\nOrganization on Computer Evidence what is\n\n2730\n02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:26,200\ncalled IOCE, which may be a body that you\nwant to follow up and just take a look at.\n\n2731\n02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:30,530\nSo that is the International Organization\non Computer Evidence,\n\n2732\n02:10:30,530 --> 02:10:34,593\nIOCE, as opposed to Iranian\noffshore engineering company.\n\n2733\n02:10:34,593 --> 02:10:35,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n2734\n02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:38,030\nSo the international organization,\nthat's the wrong one.\n\n2735\n02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:39,530\nI think that's the cooperation and\nevaluation.\n\n2736\n02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:40,150\n>> Oops.\n\n2737\n02:10:40,150 --> 02:10:44,520\nSo you wanna do IOCE, but\nyou may have to actually spell it out.\n\n2738\n02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:48,300\nWe may not, or look for, yeah that one,\nsecond one down, that one, yeah there.\n\n2739\n02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:49,180\nYeah, IOCE.\n\n2740\n02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:52,440\nSo guidelines for best practice in\nthe forensic examination right there.\n\n2741\n02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:55,040\nSo this may be one for\nyou to take a look at his website.\n\n2742\n02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:57,840\nAnd obviously make sure we\ncapture this URL for you as well.\n\n2743\n02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:02,310\nAnd there is, this is an international\nbody by the way, so this is one\n\n2744\n02:11:02,310 --> 02:11:06,650\nthat is outside the U.S. although this is\nobviously appropriate for U.S. examiners.\n\n2745\n02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:07,990\nThere's one specific to the U.S.\n\n2746\n02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:11,880\nas well, which is called the Scientific\nWorking Group on Digital Evidence.\n\n2747\n02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:17,980\nThis is the SWGDE, I'll give you that\nagain, if we wanna search for it.\n\n2748\n02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:23,406\nThe S-W-G, as in George, D-E.\n\n2749\n02:11:23,406 --> 02:11:27,225\nSo the scientific working group,\nfour right there, the first one, right?\n\n2750\n02:11:27,225 --> 02:11:30,780\nScientific working group for digital\nevidence, around digital evidence in\n\n2751\n02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:34,225\nthe U.S., this is also very good and\nanother good one to take a look at from\n\n2752\n02:11:34,225 --> 02:11:37,888\na digital evidence, digital forensic\nstandpoint, just in terms of you know,\n\n2753\n02:11:37,888 --> 02:11:41,389\ndifferent standards that we look at,\ndifferent ways to go out and to find out\n\n2754\n02:11:41,389 --> 02:11:45,030\nabout this information and for you as\na practitioner to follow up a little bit.\n\n2755\n02:11:45,030 --> 02:11:48,360\nAnd get some background and\nmaybe do a little deeper dive.\n\n2756\n02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:51,490\nSo think about that, obviously think\nabout your areas of strengths and\n\n2757\n02:11:51,490 --> 02:11:55,120\nweaknesses as you become\ninvolved in these conversations.\n\n2758\n02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:57,920\nLooking to progress ahead and\ntrying to certify.\n\n2759\n02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:59,600\nAround getting ready for the exam.\n\n2760\n02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:02,370\nThis may be an area where\nyou have a lot of expertise.\n\n2761\n02:12:02,370 --> 02:12:04,590\nThis may be an area where you\ndon't a have a lot of expertise.\n\n2762\n02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:07,450\nAnd so you maybe do a little due\ndiligence, a little studying, in order to\n\n2763\n02:12:07,450 --> 02:12:10,830\nget up to speed on some of the things\nwe've been discussing with you here today.\n\n2764\n02:12:12,472 --> 02:12:15,650\n>> All right, well I think that pretty\nmuch, unless you've got anything else?\n\n2765\n02:12:15,650 --> 02:12:17,780\n>> No, I think we're good other\nthan saying goodbye to everyone for\n\n2766\n02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:22,380\nthe moment, and we'll see you soon for\nanother conversation continuing this area.\n\n2767\n02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:25,180\nWe're gonna be coming up and\ntalking about business continuity and\n\n2768\n02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:28,120\ndisaster recovery as we\ncontinue our conversations.\n\n2769\n02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:32,386\nAnd risk and response, and finish off this\nsection, and this particular program.\n\n2770\n02:12:32,386 --> 02:12:38,550\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Hey, welcome everybody to\nanother episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,440\nI'm Mike Roderick,\nwith Mr Adam Gordon in the house today.\n\n6\n00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,620\n>> Howdy, everybody.\n\n7\n00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,570\n>> Get ready to do part two of our\nrisk response and recovery episode.\n\n8\n00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,640\nGetting into some,\nwhere are we headed this time?\n\n9\n00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,630\n>> Business continuity planning, disaster\nrecovery planning, backup and restore.\n\n10\n00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,320\nHow do we deal with all the procedural and\npolicy-based elements around making sure,\n\n11\n00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,900\nwe're gonna take the mess that\nwe may have been left with, and\n\n12\n00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,410\nget it back to where it's suppose to be,\nto put us back to normal,\n\n13\n00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,550\nthat's what we're going to focus on.\n\n14\n00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,660\nBusiness continuity management.\n\n15\n00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,790\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n16\n00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,950\n>> Absolutely.\n\n17\n00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,840\nLet's talk about at a high\nlevel what that actually means.\n\n18\n00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,640\nHow do we go from the mess that we\nmay find ourselves in, the as is,\n\n19\n00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,640\nif you will and to the to be, where we\nwant to be which is back to normal.\n\n20\n00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,685\nWe often refer to this particular\nconceptual idea in this practice, going\n\n21\n00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:27,260\nfrom being stuck somewhere where things\nare not normal, to returning to normal.\n\n22\n00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,210\nRight, so really getting back\nto normal is what we talk about,\n\n23\n00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,570\nwhen we talk about business\ncontinuity management.\n\n24\n00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,740\nGetting us back to the way the business\nruns on a daily basis, reestablishing\n\n25\n00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,590\nsystems, the continuity and the integrity\nof that information has to be restored.\n\n26\n00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,780\nAnd so we talk about business\ncontinuity planning, what we call BCP.\n\n27\n00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,240\nWe talk about disaster recovery planning,\nDRP.\n\n28\n00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,670\nWe wanna make sure we have\na good understanding,\n\n29\n00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,220\nwhat both of these things represent, so we\ncan begin to carve up and talk about each,\n\n30\n00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,790\nand in this particular segment we're\ngoing to spend our time focusing on BCP.\n\n31\n00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,010\nWe'll come back and\ntalk about DRP a little bit later on.\n\n32\n00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,990\nBut I want to spend some time\nreally getting to know, and\n\n33\n00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,200\nunderstand what happens in\nbusiness continuity planning.\n\n34\n00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,090\nSo BCP is about keeping all those\ncritical business processes.\n\n35\n00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,380\nWhatever we identify as being critical,\noperational in the event of a disaster.\n\n36\n00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,600\nSo if something were to happen,\n\n37\n00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,800\nif a disaster were to occur,\nhow do we stay on-line as a business,\n\n38\n00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,630\nhow do we keep e-mail up and running,\nhow do we make sure we have phones?\n\n39\n00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,530\nThings like that.\n\n40\n00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,500\nWhatever those critical business\nsystems are that must be maintained,\n\n41\n00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,750\nmaking sure we focus on\nthe viability of those.\n\n42\n00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,770\nThat's what BCP Is all about.\n\n43\n00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,560\nDRP disaster recovery, and of course DRP\ndisaster recovery planning specifically,\n\n44\n00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,220\nrecovering the infrastructure\nthat's necessary for\n\n45\n00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,290\nreestablishing normal business operations.\n\n46\n00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,130\nSo, disaster recovery is really\nabout getting back to normal,\n\n47\n00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,280\nBCP business continuity is trying\nto attempt to maintain normalcy,\n\n48\n00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,160\nin the face of disaster.\n\n49\n00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,120\nBut really understanding how to make\nsure that we keep things moving, and\n\n50\n00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,080\nmaking sure that we understand what it\nmeans is really important in the sense,\n\n51\n00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,440\nthat this is what BCP is focused on,\nis really to mitigate incidents, right,\n\n52\n00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,750\nminimize the impact of the disaster.\n\n53\n00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,070\nKeep the critical business systems up and\nrunning.\n\n54\n00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,180\nAnd then over time,\n\n55\n00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,680\nreturn to normal through a process of\nreestablishing the nonessential systems,\n\n56\n00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,110\nand all the other things that may go\non around those essential elements.\n\n57\n00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,100\nBut obviously, we need to make sure safety\nof life is always first and foremost.\n\n58\n00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,310\nSo focus on this idea\nof safeguarding life,\n\n59\n00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,580\nthen we safeguard our systems secondarily,\nand mitigation, and\n\n60\n00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,740\nor containment of damage is really\nsecondary to safety of life at all times.\n\n61\n00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,930\n>> Of course.\n>> We wanna make sure we\n\n62\n00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,570\nalways keep that in mind,\nand we're aware of that.\n\n63\n00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,980\nRight, very important.\n\n64\n00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,770\nSo when we talk about this idea of BCP and\n\n65\n00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,620\nDRP, we're also talking about risk\nmanagement, or at least looking backwards\n\n66\n00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,810\nto risk management a little bit, because\nwe wanna make sure we keep in mind,\n\n67\n00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,360\nthat it's important for us to identify,\nthat risks could lead to disaster.\n\n68\n00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,620\nSo we want to be aware of them,\nand so engaging in risk analysis,\n\n69\n00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,400\nwhich is the key methodology,\n\n70\n00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,582\nwe use in risk management to identify\nrisks, is what we do in risk management.\n\n71\n00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,960\nIn disaster recovery, we're really looking\nat measures and methods, that are gonna be\n\n72\n00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,960\nable to be used, to be able to\nunderstand the impact of the disaster.\n\n73\n00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,320\nAnd in business continuity, we're\nlooking at a business impact analysis,\n\n74\n00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320\nwhat's known as a BIA.\n\n75\n00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,500\nAnd the business impact analysis is\nreally gonna be very critical for\n\n76\n00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,550\nus, because the business impact\nanalysis helps us to identify and\n\n77\n00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,260\nprioritize, what the mission critical\nsystems are of the business.\n\n78\n00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,090\nWhereas risk analysis helps us\nto identify the risks we face,\n\n79\n00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,090\nthis is impact analysis, it's going\nto help us to identify key or mission\n\n80\n00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,010\ncritical systems, that the business must\nhave up and running, and continue to be\n\n81\n00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,540\nable to access, during times of disaster,\nand or, during times of stress.\n\n82\n00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,190\nSo we want to make sure we\nunderstand the difference\n\n83\n00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,410\nbetween the business impact analysis.\n\n84\n00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,890\nAs well as the difference\nbetween the risk analysis.\n\n85\n00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,900\nBusiness impact analysis\nis done as a what if.\n\n86\n00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,220\nThis is really a, if this were to\nhappen to this system scenario,\n\n87\n00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,990\nkind of a conversation,\nwhat would the impact be?\n\n88\n00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,670\nWhereas risk analysis is more factual.\n\n89\n00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,490\nWe're looking at the risks and\nunderstanding the impact, and\n\n90\n00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,170\nthe exposure that we're looking at,\nwith the quantitative measures.\n\n91\n00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,290\nWe're gonna have more fact based and\n\n92\n00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,180\nmeasurable, quantifiable base\nmeasures that we engage in there.\n\n93\n00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,960\nSo we talk about impact and probability\nas we just said, when we look at risk\n\n94\n00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,700\nanalysis, whereas we look at impact and\ntime on the business impact analysis side.\n\n95\n00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,150\nThis is gonna be, if it was to go down for\n\n96\n00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,920\nhow long, however long that is, what\nwill be the impact be to the business?\n\n97\n00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,700\nSo business impact analysis\nis all about impact and time.\n\n98\n00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,360\nWe call it generically a what if scenario.\n\n99\n00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,730\nSo typically, the tolerable downtime and\nthings of that nature,\n\n100\n00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,120\nis measures that we'll get into\nhere in a couple of minutes.\n\n101\n00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,760\nAre gonna be discussed in a business\nimpact analysis, where as impact and\n\n102\n00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,120\nprobability is the functional element,\nthat we use to understand and\n\n103\n00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,910\nassess the risk analysis,\nso please be aware of that.\n\n104\n00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,880\nThe scope of these analysis\nare also important to keep in mind,\n\n105\n00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,050\nwhen we take a look at risk analysis,\n\n106\n00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,900\nwe're focused primarily on the management\nof risk, to the core business objectives.\n\n107\n00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,640\nWhat are those risks we've identified and\n\n108\n00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,080\nfocusing on them,\nwhereas when we talk about the scope and\n\n109\n00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,230\na business impact analysis area,\nwe focus on incident management.\n\n110\n00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,710\nReally, looking at the key critical\nbusiness systems that we are focused on,\n\n111\n00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,270\nbut really understanding that they\nare going to be necessary, right?\n\n112\n00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,160\nWhat is necessary?\n\n113\n00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,140\nIs it e-mail, or whatever that may be?\n\n114\n00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,250\nAnd looking at the focus\nmainly in incident management,\n\n115\n00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,950\nto understand the impact\nof that particular outage.\n\n116\n00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,630\nWhat will that be if it goes down,\nand how do we keep it up and\n\n117\n00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,050\nrunning, hopefully, if that is the case?\n\n118\n00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,457\nAnd so, remember, typically, both of these\ndeal with potentially sudden events,\n\n119\n00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:55,565\na business impact can be a very sudden\nevent arising out of a risk or a disaster,\n\n120\n00:06:55,565 --> 00:07:00,210\nsomething like an earthquake, or a forest\nfire, or a mudslide, or a weather event.\n\n121\n00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,050\nCan come up almost immediately\nwithout little to no advanced warning.\n\n122\n00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,290\nAnd so these events can be very sudden,\nthey can overtake us.\n\n123\n00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,090\nAnd as a result, we may or\nmay not have time really to think about,\n\n124\n00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,980\nahead of time what that impact may be.\n\n125\n00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,240\nBut it could be something that's\nslow moving and slow acting.\n\n126\n00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,930\nYou know, a hurricane, although it happens\nsuddenly when it's off the coast, and\n\n127\n00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,740\nit moves on shore.\n\n128\n00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,250\nIn the sense that there's\na small time window there,\n\n129\n00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,200\nwe can typically see hurricanes\ncoming from out on the water.\n\n130\n00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,150\nYou know, across literally the ocean,\nwhether it's the Atlantic or the Pacific.\n\n131\n00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,770\nUsually with a week or more's lead time.\n\n132\n00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,290\nWe may not know exactly\nwhere it's gonna go.\n\n133\n00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,120\nBut we typically have enough lead time\nto know it's gonna hit this general\n\n134\n00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,330\ngeographic area.\n\n135\n00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,370\nWhereas something like a forest\nfire may give us some warning,\n\n136\n00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,580\nmaybe coming down the canyon, or wherever\nwe find ourselves, but we typically tend\n\n137\n00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,750\nto know with a much shorter time frame,\nmaybe hours as opposed to days or weeks,\n\n138\n00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,560\nthat that's coming, and something\nthat is going to happen that maybe.\n\n139\n00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,910\nMuch more slow moving.\n\n140\n00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,308\nLike potentially the availability of\ncertain supplies or certain strategic\n\n141\n00:07:57,308 --> 00:08:02,109\nsupplies that we need as a business being\ncut off because of political instability,\n\n142\n00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:06,371\nmay or may not are becoming, perhaps\nless affordable because of political\n\n143\n00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:11,200\ninstability, may or may not have a very\nlong extended timeline associated with it.\n\n144\n00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,860\nSo you know, just think about those\nthings, understand those things and\n\n145\n00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,110\nbe aware of them.\n\n146\n00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,800\nSo when we think about disasters,\nwhen think about what a disaster is,\n\n147\n00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,320\nit's the sudden unplanned event\nthat we are dealing with.\n\n148\n00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,320\nAnd the disaster is that\nsudden unplanned circumstance\n\n149\n00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,590\nthat creates basically an inability\non the part of the organization to\n\n150\n00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,460\nfunction the way the they would normally.\n\n151\n00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,070\nRight?\n\n152\n00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,870\nSo, if there is a loss\nof the building that\n\n153\n00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,200\nthe operational day to day events\ntake place in because there's a fire.\n\n154\n00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,390\nThat would be a disaster for\n\n155\n00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,980\na company because they no longer\nhave the office space, right?\n\n156\n00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,930\nAnd that kind of thing.\n\n157\n00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,510\nThat would be considered a disaster.\n\n158\n00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,860\nAnd that's that unexpected\nsudden event that overtakes us,\n\n159\n00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,260\nreally with no warning, and it can\ntypically result in great damage or loss.\n\n160\n00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,160\nThis is important for us to be aware\nof and to think about as well.\n\n161\n00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,840\nSo, we want to think about that and\nhave that as, in our mind,\n\n162\n00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,350\na working definition.\n\n163\n00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,410\nAnd, then some other key business\ncontinuity language vocabulary items\n\n164\n00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,580\nthat we wanna have are gonna be,\nwe've already discussed a couple of these,\n\n165\n00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,290\nthe business impact analysis.\n\n166\n00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,420\nI know we have that up there, and Mike,\nyou've been kind enough to write some\n\n167\n00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,850\nnotes as we've been going\nto capture those key areas.\n\n168\n00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,300\nThe critical business function,\nwe can see there, what's known as the CBF.\n\n169\n00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,870\nThe CBF, the critical business function,\nthis is gonna come out of the business\n\n170\n00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,230\nimpact analysis, or these,\ncuz there's more than one typically.\n\n171\n00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,490\nSo these things come out of\nthe business impact analysis.\n\n172\n00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,410\nThey are in effect the outcomes\nof the business impact analysis.\n\n173\n00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,960\nWhen we do a BIA and we come up with\nthe fact that email, most companies today,\n\n174\n00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,040\nthis tends to be a critical\nbusiness factor.\n\n175\n00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,870\n>> Right.\n>> Or a critical business function.\n\n176\n00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,180\nI don't always agree that\nit's the most important one.\n\n177\n00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,920\nBut I'm just one of those people that\nprefer to talk to you face to face.\n\n178\n00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,305\nI don't really think you can get\na lot of context in an email or chat.\n\n179\n00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:56,380\n>> Right.\n>> So sometimes,\n\n180\n00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,200\nit's the subtlety of communication that\nmay actually be missing from that.\n\n181\n00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,360\nSo it's very hard to intone context.\n\n182\n00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,520\nBut in general, we do, I think all agree,\n\n183\n00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,090\nthat email is considered a pretty\ncritical business function today.\n\n184\n00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,080\nSo as a result,\nwe would do a business impact analysis and\n\n185\n00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,780\nunderstand that we need email\nto really conduct our business.\n\n186\n00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,220\nMaybe our phone systems are considered\ncritical business functions.\n\n187\n00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,740\nMaybe internet access, if we\nare an internet company of some kind,\n\n188\n00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,340\nwe do e-commerce or things like that.\n\n189\n00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,932\nImagine Amazon or\nGoogle not having web access, or Facebook.\n\n190\n00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:30,277\nRight? [CROSSTALK]. How many millions\nof dollars are they losing every time\n\n191\n00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:34,070\nsomebody blinks, so that would\nbe a critical business function.\n\n192\n00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,070\nFor them, maybe more so\nthan email if you think about it, right?\n\n193\n00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,880\nI mean, Google, Facebook, these companies,\nemail is important for them, right?\n\n194\n00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,250\nBut it is not as important as web access,\nand you know,\n\n195\n00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,180\nyou want to think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n196\n00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,500\nWhereas the phone company, right, they're\nin a services-oriented environment.\n\n197\n00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,800\nThey need a lot of stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,350\nBut for them, the thing they make money\non is gonna be internet access and\n\n199\n00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,740\ninternet service today,\nthat's what they really sell.\n\n200\n00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,630\nPhone is part of that.\n\n201\n00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,960\nBut let's be honest, you may not realize\nyou don't have phone service right away,\n\n202\n00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,410\nbut you're gonna miss internet\nservice almost immediately.\n\n203\n00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,880\nSo it really depends on\nthe business vertical you are in.\n\n204\n00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,230\nAnd you have to then look at the BIA to\nunderstand how that then helps you to\n\n205\n00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,220\nidentify critical business functions.\n\n206\n00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,920\nSo please make sure you make that\nconnection be aware of that.\n\n207\n00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,330\nObviously, we rank these based on\nthe ability of the business to\n\n208\n00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,210\nsurvive an outage.\n\n209\n00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,580\nThe higher up the food chain we go in\nterms of the less likely it is we can\n\n210\n00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,570\nsurvive an outage for very long means that\nthat CBF is gonna be the highest priority\n\n211\n00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,190\nif we really can't survive without it,\nright?\n\n212\n00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,920\nAnd that's the kind of thing,\nif we can survive for a while without it,\n\n213\n00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,950\nthen it's gonna be lower down\non that priority change.\n\n214\n00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,120\nSo coffee and\n\n215\n00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,970\nvending services services may be\nimportant to people that work in IT.\n\n216\n00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,150\nBut to the general population,\noutside of IT, may not be so important.\n\n217\n00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,950\nSo we may be able to survive without\nthose for a little bit of time.\n\n218\n00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,630\nRight?\n\n219\n00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,970\nSo maximum tolerable downtime.\n\n220\n00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,750\nThis is gonna be the maximum\na business can go and or survive.\n\n221\n00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,660\nMaximum time,\n\n222\n00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,590\nmeaning we measure this in time,\nwithout a critical system being available.\n\n223\n00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,210\nSo if we think about what the CBFs are,\nthis is the measure of how long we can\n\n224\n00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,210\ndo without the CBF before\nthings get really, really ugly.\n\n225\n00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,680\nThat's what the maximum tolerable downtime\nis, and so companies will declare these\n\n226\n00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,270\nin their disaster recovery and\nbusiness continuity planning documents.\n\n227\n00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,640\nWe measure these with SLAs, service\nlevel agreements, to understand and\n\n228\n00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,800\nto really take to heart\nwhat these things will be.\n\n229\n00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,710\nSo maximum tolerable down time is\ndeclared typically in a service agreement\n\n230\n00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,450\ninside of an SLA.\n\n231\n00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,740\nAnd we then measure those and\n\n232\n00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,500\nmaximize our usage of the service by\nmeasuring the maximum tolerable down time.\n\n233\n00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,209\nRTO, the Recovery Time Objective.\n\n234\n00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,810\nThe recovery time objective\nis the time frame,\n\n235\n00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,020\nexcuse me, to restore the critical\nbusiness function, the CBF.\n\n236\n00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,630\nSo this is what it will take to actually\nperform what we call the restoral process,\n\n237\n00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,170\nto put back the critical\nbusiness function,\n\n238\n00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,090\nto re-establish the CBF\nin a working fashion.\n\n239\n00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,510\nThis is what the RTO represents.\n\n240\n00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:05,230\nIt must be shorter than or\nequal to the maximum tolerable downtime.\n\n241\n00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,230\nSo when we talk about the RTO,\nthe recovery time objective,\n\n242\n00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,250\nthat window that we have to recover this,\nit has to be no more than\n\n243\n00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,660\nthe amount of maximum tolerable\ndowntime we allocate to the CBF.\n\n244\n00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,960\nAnd if you think about the logic of this,\nif we say hypothetically,\n\n245\n00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,190\nright, that email is a critical\nbusiness function and\n\n246\n00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,120\nwe are gonna allow ourselves to\nbe without it for three hours.\n\n247\n00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,900\nAnd after three hours,\nit becomes critical.\n\n248\n00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,840\nAnd that system is no longer available and\n\n249\n00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,470\nwe are now in a disaster as a result\nof that, the maximum tolerable downtime\n\n250\n00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,980\nin other words has been set\nat three hours for the CVF.\n\n251\n00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,970\nWhat we then have to understand is that\nthe RTO, the recovery time objective,\n\n252\n00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,350\ncan be no longer than three hours, right.\n\n253\n00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,261\n>> Because if it's four hours [INAUDIBLE].\n\n254\n00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,820\n>> It's outside the window.\n\n255\n00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,320\n>> Exactly.\nExactly.\n\n256\n00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,200\nSo, it has to be no more than the MTB.\n\n257\n00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,180\nIt can be up to that window, but no more\nthan, and should be less than, obviously.\n\n258\n00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,240\nWe want to think about that and obviously,\nhopefully, that will be the case.\n\n259\n00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,820\nAnd then, the recovery point objective,\nthe RPO, this is going to be where we look\n\n260\n00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,340\nat the amount of tolerable data loss that\nwe can sustain, so we're thinking about\n\n261\n00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,860\nwhat that business function is, and how\nmuch of it we can afford to do without.\n\n262\n00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,050\nAnd then, obviously,\n\n263\n00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,460\nour recovery procedures have to be\naligned to be able to support this.\n\n264\n00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,500\nAnd if we say, for instance,\nthat we can survive,\n\n265\n00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,890\nmaybe this is when we talk about maybe\na backup solution, hypothetically.\n\n266\n00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,900\nAnd so we say, we typically do back\nups once a day, perhaps at night.\n\n267\n00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,190\nSo, we have a 24-hour cycle\non our backups for that data.\n\n268\n00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,340\nCan we afford to lose one day's\nworth of business data as a business\n\n269\n00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,330\nhypothetically?\n\n270\n00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,070\nIf we can, our recovery point objective\n\n271\n00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,510\nis going to be the amount of tolerable\ndata loss that we can sustain.\n\n272\n00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,550\nSo, is it that one day of business\ndata that if we lose we're still okay?\n\n273\n00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,760\nIs it perhaps less than that,\nhard to say, we don't know.\n\n274\n00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,560\nSo what is that, and I obviously wanna\nmake sure we're aware of that and\n\n275\n00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,130\nwe're thinking through that.\n\n276\n00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,590\nAnd so, the recovery point objective\nis the amount of tolerable data lose\n\n277\n00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,250\nthat effectively can sustain or\n\n278\n00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,750\nstand in order to then continue\nworking before we declare, again,\n\n279\n00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,060\na disaster, an event that will then have\nfurther ramifications, further issues.\n\n280\n00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,100\nA few years back when we had the blackout\nthat affected most of the Northeast,\n\n281\n00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,120\nwhere that power grid went down,\nstarted in Canada, cascaded through, but\n\n282\n00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,270\ncascaded all the way across the Northeast\nand took out very large swathes of\n\n283\n00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,810\nthe whole Great Lakes Region and across\nthe border, because all the interweaving,\n\n284\n00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,960\nutility grids had failed one\nafter the other and cascaded.\n\n285\n00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,100\nYeah, we had some interesting\nthings that came out of that.\n\n286\n00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,610\nObviously, we are working\non re-establishing and\n\n287\n00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,510\ncreating smart grids as a result of this.\n\n288\n00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,380\nSo we're not really talking about what\nthe outcome in terms of recovery was.\n\n289\n00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,575\nBut interesting studies done after\nthe fact show proved that a lot of\n\n290\n00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:49,614\nthe utilities that we're managing through\nin the production environments that were\n\n291\n00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:52,210\nthere for a lot of these big\nmanufacturing companies.\n\n292\n00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,800\nThink about car manufacturers,\nfor instance, right?\n\n293\n00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,170\nBut Ford Motor Company has the big plants,\nright?\n\n294\n00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,500\nSome of them are up in Michigan and\nDearborn and places like that.\n\n295\n00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,152\nAnd so they had to decide, based on power\noutages, and their emergency generator's\n\n296\n00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:09,027\nkicking in, things of that nature,\nhow long they could afford to go and\n\n297\n00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:13,690\nkeep their plants open before they had\nto declare disaster and idle the plant.\n\n298\n00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,940\nAnd shutting down a plant like that\nis not as simple as saying hey guys,\n\n299\n00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,650\nwe're just gonna turn the lights off.\n\n300\n00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,270\nYou guys go hang out for a while and go\ngrab lunch, come back in like two hours.\n\n301\n00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,590\nIt should all work itself out.\n\n302\n00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,630\nYou know, it doesn't work that way.\n\n303\n00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,590\nYou start shutting down a car plant,\nit could take a couple\n\n304\n00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,860\nof days to spin a plant down, and a couple\nof days to spin a plant back up again.\n\n305\n00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,190\nAnd so this is a big event, because\nyou start shutting this thing down,\n\n306\n00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,160\nand all of a sudden the power comes back\non It's not as simple as reversing course.\n\n307\n00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,140\n>> Right.\n>> You have an entire procedure you go\n\n308\n00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,390\nthrough, because of the nature of the\nmachinery and the fact that you can damage\n\n309\n00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,750\nrobotics that may cost millions of\ndollars if you don't shut them down and\n\n310\n00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,520\nrestart them in a proper sequence.\n\n311\n00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,750\nAnd so there were a lot of gambles going\non in these boardrooms where they were\n\n312\n00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,760\nlooking at this and saying,\nhow long are we gonna be able to go?\n\n313\n00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,580\nWhat's the impact?\n\n314\n00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,670\nAre we gonna get power back?\n\n315\n00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,200\nWhat's the utility telling us?\n\n316\n00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,020\nAnd at some point they were\nlooking at that disaster\n\n317\n00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,600\nthreshold where they had to basically\nmake a decision based on these MTDs,\n\n318\n00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,350\nthese maximum tolerable downtimes they\nhave to establish in their systems.\n\n319\n00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,455\nYou know, we don't have enough\nresources coming into the plant\n\n320\n00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:16,370\ncause we're doing this just\nin time delivery method where\n\n321\n00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,140\nwe only have enough resources to run\nthe assembly plant for 12 hours.\n\n322\n00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,550\nAnd shipments are stopped because all\nthe powers out, the rail heads are down,\n\n323\n00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,180\ncan't run the trains,\nnot getting cargo in, no bulk resources.\n\n324\n00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,650\nCan we afford to run the plant\nif we can't produce anything?\n\n325\n00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,260\nAnd so what are we doing and so, they did\na lot of these after the fact studies,\n\n326\n00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,940\nthese lesson learned are basically\npost implementation review studies on\n\n327\n00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,140\nthe great black outs.\n\n328\n00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,640\nAnd they really started to realize\nthat a lot of these things were\n\n329\n00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,780\nnot very well documented and\nvery well understood in some cases\n\n330\n00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,360\nbecause there was a gut feeling about\nwhether this should or should not run.\n\n331\n00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,520\nBut because the utility companies couldn't\ngive accurate information about when they\n\n332\n00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,030\nwould come back online,\nit was almost impossible for\n\n333\n00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,070\nthese companies to decide what to do.\n\n334\n00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,515\nAnd so, you know, this can really have\na lot of unintended consequences.\n\n335\n00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:05,310\nIf we don't really understand all\nthe facts around the decisions\n\n336\n00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,030\nthat we have to make based on the issue,\n\n337\n00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,110\nbased on potential,\nthe disaster event that we are facing.\n\n338\n00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,569\nThis is a really big deal.\n\n339\n00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,470\nSo just some things to think about\nthere and for you to be aware of.\n\n340\n00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,110\nSo, the business impact analysis\nas we talked about, right?\n\n341\n00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,390\nDescribes the impact that\na disaster has on any and\n\n342\n00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,910\nall of these critical business functions.\n\n343\n00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,310\nWe said the CBFs are derivative.\n\n344\n00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,490\nThey come out of the BIA.\n\n345\n00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,170\nWe wanna make that connection.\n\n346\n00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,090\nWe really wanna ask two question there,\nright?\n\n347\n00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,330\nWhat will the effect to the business be?\n\n348\n00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,690\nSo ultimately what can affect\nthe business if this goes wrong?\n\n349\n00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,920\nHow will we deal with that?\n\n350\n00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,550\nAnd how will it affect the business.\n\n351\n00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,590\nSo the BIA, the Business Impact Analysis,\nis all about the what and the how, right?\n\n352\n00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,890\nThese are the questions we ask.\n\n353\n00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,770\nThis would be the business impact\nanalysis that we're focused on.\n\n354\n00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,560\nThe questions we wanna ask are the what,\nand you have it there, what if scenario,\n\n355\n00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,690\nkind of what it is and\ncan the sudden event, tolerable downtime,\n\n356\n00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,610\nmaybe able to foresee, maybe not.\n\n357\n00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,150\nHow, excuse me,\nhow will it affect the business?\n\n358\n00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,470\nThis is the other question\nthat we wanna ask.\n\n359\n00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,900\nAnd obviously a successful BIA,\nhow will it affect the business?\n\n360\n00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,370\nA succesful BIA maps those CBFs,\n\n361\n00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,840\nthose Critical Business Functions, to\nthe processes on which they're gonna rely.\n\n362\n00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,330\nSo we have to make sure we\nsee that critical linkage\n\n363\n00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,190\nbetween the business impact analysis,\ncreating the CBFs, and\n\n364\n00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,730\nthe CBFs being mapped to the business\nprocesses that drive them.\n\n365\n00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,950\nIt's very, very important.\n\n366\n00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:30,110\nWe also wanna take into account that\nthere may be obvious impacts, but\n\n367\n00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,890\nalso impacts that are not so\nobvious, right?\n\n368\n00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,550\nAnd so what are those not so\nobvious impacts that we have to rely on?\n\n369\n00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:40,380\nYou know, when we think about\nthis timeline, and we think about\n\n370\n00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,370\nthe impact that may be obvious, are there\nonce in a five year, once in a 10 year,\n\n371\n00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,900\nonce in a 50 or 100 year cycle events\nthat we may not plan for and may not\n\n372\n00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,580\nthink about all the time, but could\npotentially have catastrophic impacts?\n\n373\n00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,790\nAnd as a result, we have to\npotentially plan for those as well.\n\n374\n00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,240\nAnd so, some of those business impact\nanalysis may be more of those,\n\n375\n00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,620\nwhat if those kind of outlier\nscenarios were to occur?\n\n376\n00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,843\n>> Yeah.\n>> What if that once in\n\n377\n00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:05,850\n100 year weather event occurs?\n\n378\n00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,779\n>> And if we live in New Orleans,\nunfortunately, when it did occur, and\n\n379\n00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:13,507\nthe levees breach, what happens\nwhen a storm like Katrina hits and\n\n380\n00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:17,172\nthat perfect confluence of weather and\nstructural integrity and\n\n381\n00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,171\nall those things comes together and\n\n382\n00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:23,126\nwe see the flooding of an entire\nmetropolitan downtown area in a city.\n\n383\n00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:24,766\nRight, so we didn't plan for that.\n\n384\n00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,380\n>> We had those three,\nfour hurricanes come through here,\n\n385\n00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,510\nhit us all in the same year\n>> We had all that water right?\n\n386\n00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,142\nAll that flooding and also up in New York.\n\n387\n00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:34,301\n>> Places that had never flooded before\nall the sudden had to deal with this and\n\n388\n00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:38,700\nrestructure their, we think the way they\nhad set up their buildings, their layouts.\n\n389\n00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,220\n>> That's the time of the year where\nyou wanna be thinking about living\n\n390\n00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,810\nsomewhere else.\n\n391\n00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,535\n>> Yes absolutely.\n\n392\n00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:43,430\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n393\n00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,530\nvery important right to be\nthinking about that, right?\n\n394\n00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,610\nWinter here is summer somewhere else.\n\n395\n00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,130\nSo just think about that, but really, the\nidea there is to make sure we take into\n\n396\n00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,830\naccount even the most remote of scenarios.\n\n397\n00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,650\nWe may not spend a lot of time on\nthe once in 100 year event in terms of\n\n398\n00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,630\nthrowing resources at it right now.\n\n399\n00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,070\nIf we're 20 years into\nthat 100 year cycle,\n\n400\n00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,120\nit's less likely than when we're 50 or\n60 years in, but having the background\n\n401\n00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,760\nplan in place, having done the what if\nanalysis as a starting point, is so\n\n402\n00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,600\nmuch more important than starting\nfrom scratch when it hits us.\n\n403\n00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,350\nI think often, when I talk about this\nwith students and when I talk about this\n\n404\n00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,040\nparticular concept with customers a lot\nas well, I use the Wizard of Oz analogy.\n\n405\n00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,460\nYou know, we've probably, most of us,\n\n406\n00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,450\nI can't say all of us, it's depending\non the part of the world you live in.\n\n407\n00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,660\nThe Wizard of Oz may or\nmay not be a cultural icon to you.\n\n408\n00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,740\nBut, you know, growing up in\nthe United States, certainly,\n\n409\n00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,465\ndepending on your age, you will have\nseen most likely as a young kid,\n\n410\n00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:36,565\nthe Wizard of Oz, and\na lot of us have seen it.\n\n411\n00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:39,145\nIf you haven't seen it, you have homework!\n\n412\n00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,825\nGo watch the Wizard of Oz, right?\n\n413\n00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:44,015\nBut it's a great movie for a lot of\nreasons but I often try to use these\n\n414\n00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:47,480\nanalogies when I'm teaching in classes\nbecause a lot of people have seen movies,\n\n415\n00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,790\nhave seen TV things, and so-\n>> Something they can relate to.\n\n416\n00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,760\n>> It's a common thing, right?\n\n417\n00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,880\nIt's a common cultural touchstone.\n\n418\n00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,780\nAnd so in the Wizard of Oz,\nthe thing that really relates to this idea\n\n419\n00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,620\nis where Dorothy comes out of the house,\nfalls on the Wicked Witch,\n\n420\n00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,790\nwinds up in Downtown Munchkinville,\nright she finally falls on the witch.\n\n421\n00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,140\nAnd so she comes out,\nboom we have technicolor, great concept.\n\n422\n00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,270\nWe see everything in color.\n\n423\n00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,510\nWe do the song and dance, right?\n\n424\n00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,200\nThe lollipop guild and all that.\n\n425\n00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,130\nAnd then we wind up in the middle of\nthe town square in Munchkinville.\n\n426\n00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,890\nAnd the mayor comes out and\nwalks Dorothy around and he says, okay, so\n\n427\n00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,950\nyou want to go and\nfollow the yellow brick road.\n\n428\n00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,300\nAnd so we see they get on\nto the yellow brick road.\n\n429\n00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,980\nAnd if you remember the yellow brick road,\nit starts out at a single little point in\n\n430\n00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,235\nthe middle of the square and it wraps\naround in a kind of a circular fashion,\n\n431\n00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:37,095\nright, it spirals out into what goes\nout onto this what we think of now, we\n\n432\n00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:40,985\nsee it as a little road, see the backdrop,\nyou can realize it's not really Oz.\n\n433\n00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:45,410\nIt looks kind of hokey by today's\nstandards, but [COUGH] back in the day\n\n434\n00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,570\nyou looked at this and you saw this gold\npaved road that went out from the city and\n\n435\n00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,179\nultimately in the distance there\nwas the Emerald City, right?\n\n436\n00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:53,100\nThe Land of Oz.\n\n437\n00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,960\nAnd so Dorothy started out on that\nroad and then the adventures happened.\n\n438\n00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,850\nShe meets the scarecrow, the wizard and\nall of these things eventually and\n\n439\n00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,170\nthen ultimately gets home.\n\n440\n00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,760\nBut the idea was she started\nat a well defined point.\n\n441\n00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,930\nShe planned her journey although\nthere were a lot of unknowns,\n\n442\n00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,920\nshe didn't know she would\nmeet the Scarecrow,\n\n443\n00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,730\ndidn't know she need the Tin Man,\ndidn't know anything about the Lion,\n\n444\n00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,770\ndidn't know about the Wizard,\ndidn't know if the Wizard was real or not.\n\n445\n00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,490\nBut at the end of the day she went through\nall these areas of her journey because she\n\n446\n00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,010\nat least had the boundary of\nit the structure of the box\n\n447\n00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,190\nshe had the road she knew stay on\nthe road, stay on the yellow brick road.\n\n448\n00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,230\nIf I follow the road I will\nget to where I'm going.\n\n449\n00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,760\nAnd the road is like the plan\nthat we're talking about.\n\n450\n00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,750\nIt gives us the boundaries and\nthe starting and\n\n451\n00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,910\nending points, to then begin to have the\ndialog with the business about how we can\n\n452\n00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,110\nactually engage in disaster recovery\na business continuity plan.\n\n453\n00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,930\nSo follow your yellow brick road,\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n454\n00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,783\n>> I like that. [LAUGH] >> We\ntalk about disaster recovery,\n\n455\n00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:45,212\nit's all about the Wizard of Oz.\n\n456\n00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:49,183\nAll right, so now that we're done with\nmodern TV, and interpretation of it in IT,\n\n457\n00:23:49,183 --> 00:23:51,880\nlet's get back to what we're\nactually talking about.\n\n458\n00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,329\nSo we talked about MTD, we talked\nabout the Maximum Tolerable Downtime,\n\n459\n00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:57,630\nwe talked about RTO.\n\n460\n00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,000\nRecovery time objective.\n\n461\n00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,169\nTalked about recovery point objective.\n\n462\n00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,072\nThe point to which data must be recovered.\n\n463\n00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,384\nWe talked about that.\n\n464\n00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:06,730\nSo make sure we understand that.\n\n465\n00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,400\nAnd we need to obviously think about all\nof this stuff in relation to Forkree.\n\n466\n00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,230\nListen to me.\n\n467\n00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,620\nUsing my command of my\nEnglish language skills here.\n\n468\n00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,810\nFour key critical components.\n\n469\n00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,519\nLet me share with you, or at least\nask you to think about what they are.\n\n470\n00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,066\nSo we talk about people, we talk about\nthis idea of being able to prepare and\n\n471\n00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:28,462\nplan in relation to these four things.\n\n472\n00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:30,858\nWe have to think about people and\ntheir role in this,\n\n473\n00:24:30,858 --> 00:24:34,685\nwhat's gonna be impacted in the disruption\nto people if this disaster does occur?\n\n474\n00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:36,264\nYou know, people might lose their houses.\n\n475\n00:24:36,264 --> 00:24:39,800\nThat could be horrible and\nobviously very devastating for people.\n\n476\n00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,740\nThey could lose the place where they work,\n\n477\n00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,300\nthey may be disrupted in\ntheir daily routines.\n\n478\n00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,920\nThere's a lot of things\nthat could go wrong.\n\n479\n00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,330\nSo impact to people, impact to systems.\n\n480\n00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,190\nThis is important as well.\n\n481\n00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,970\nWe may lose the ability to access our\ndata, so that could be important.\n\n482\n00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,630\nWhat does that mean?\n\n483\n00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,970\nWe may not be able to ship out\nwhat product to our customers,\n\n484\n00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,880\nbecause we can't build them.\n\n485\n00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,580\nSo this kind of thing may happen and\nhave butterfly effects.\n\n486\n00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,640\nImpacted data, what is the impact?\n\n487\n00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,910\nWhat data is critical for our business,\nas a result what's the impact to that?\n\n488\n00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,570\nAnd impact property,\nwhat kind of equipment do we have and\n\n489\n00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,120\nwhat's the impact going to be there?\n\n490\n00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,080\nSo, really understanding downtime and\nthe impact of downtime\n\n491\n00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,810\nacross these four areas is going to\nbe very important for us as well.\n\n492\n00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,085\nWe want to make sure we're\nthinking about that,\n\n493\n00:25:23,085 --> 00:25:26,968\nbecause we really have to understand what\nthat impact is, not just take for granted\n\n494\n00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:30,628\nthe fact that it's going to be okay, and\nwe'll just turn the lights back on and\n\n495\n00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:33,575\neverybody will come back and\ndo the things that they have to do.\n\n496\n00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,516\nJust because the power\ncomes back on over here,\n\n497\n00:25:36,516 --> 00:25:39,983\ndoesn't mean when we do that\non the screen, over here.\n\n498\n00:25:39,983 --> 00:25:43,700\nDoesn't mean that ultimately that\nthe people that have to get to the office\n\n499\n00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,358\nstill have power where they are.\n\n500\n00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:49,207\nAnd maybe they can't get gas because the\ngas station where they live doesn't have\n\n501\n00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:50,620\npower, but the office does.\n\n502\n00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,390\nWe see this a lot in\nFlorida with storm events.\n\n503\n00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,455\nCertain areas get power\nback before others.\n\n504\n00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:57,677\n>> Some roads are impassable and\nthings like that.\n\n505\n00:25:57,677 --> 00:25:59,390\n>> Are flooded out or impassable, correct.\n\n506\n00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,850\nAnd as a result, what we often see is\nbusinesses come back up, because they tend\n\n507\n00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,820\nto be on grids that are located in city\ncores where we re-establish because\n\n508\n00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,400\nof hospitals and proximity to major\nthings that have to be turned back on.\n\n509\n00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,160\nSo those businesses come back on.\n\n510\n00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,890\nBut yet the outlying residential areas\nare some of the last ones to get restored.\n\n511\n00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,660\nAnd so the people that work in those\nbusinesses often can't come back to work,\n\n512\n00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,290\neven though the business\nitself may be ready to reopen.\n\n513\n00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,170\nAnd so this is a challenge, and this is\nsomething we have to really think through,\n\n514\n00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,640\nand you'll kind of understand.\n\n515\n00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,840\nAlso, the speed of the impact.\n\n516\n00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,980\nSome threats,\nas we talked about, are sudden.\n\n517\n00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,500\nOthers creep along, and so\nwe wanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n518\n00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,995\nThe key watch word here\nis critical dependencies.\n\n519\n00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:42,795\nWhat systems and what things have to be\nrelated to other systems and other things\n\n520\n00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:48,415\nin order to make sure that those critical\ndependencies are going to be documented?\n\n521\n00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:51,425\nAnd we know that,\nif we need people to work but\n\n522\n00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:54,855\nthey can't get in because\nthere's no traffic management.\n\n523\n00:26:54,855 --> 00:26:58,280\nThe lights are out, in other words,\nthe roads are impassable, can't get gas.\n\n524\n00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,850\nDo we have background systems or\n\n525\n00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,660\nbackup systems set up where\nmaybe they can telecommute.\n\n526\n00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,330\nBecause maybe they don't necessarily\nhave the ability to travel, but\n\n527\n00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,030\nperhaps we could still get them to connect\nover a cell phone, lord knows what.\n\n528\n00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,900\nHard to say given that\nparticular solution.\n\n529\n00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,360\nBut, just be aware of that, and at least\nbe thinking through what that may mean.\n\n530\n00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,520\nSo these critical dependencies\namong systems also very important.\n\n531\n00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,740\nHaving said that, we often then\ntalk about critical dependencies,\n\n532\n00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,900\ntalk about what are called\nrecovery alternatives.\n\n533\n00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,340\nWhat are our different sites?\n\n534\n00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,190\nSo this will be like a different header,\nand this is the hot site, warm site,\n\n535\n00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,850\ncold site conversation.\n\n536\n00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,290\nWhat are those things gonna be and\nhow do we do this?\n\n537\n00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,910\nAnd so as I mention, you may not be able\nto get people back to the office, but\n\n538\n00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,630\nmaybe you can get them over to another\nsite 100 miles away and they can work out\n\n539\n00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,440\nof that site because that site does have\npower, it is set up it's ready to go.\n\n540\n00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,770\nSo what is a hot site,\nwhat's a warm site, what's a cold site and\n\n541\n00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,800\nwhat are mobile sites?\n\n542\n00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,080\nThat's probably another one\nwe wanna throw in there.\n\n543\n00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,900\nAnd let's just quickly define and\ntalk about what these things are.\n\n544\n00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,490\nA mobile site, really it's just putting it\nup on a trailer and tracking it somewhere.\n\n545\n00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,320\nSo a hot site is this idea that\neverything we do in our main office,\n\n546\n00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,250\nwherever that is, the main data center,\n\n547\n00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,000\nis identically duplicated running\nin real time fully synchronized.\n\n548\n00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,200\nAnd is 100% locked and\nready to go, in real time.\n\n549\n00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,240\nSo fully synchronized, mirrored, is what\nwe often hear, a term that is define this.\n\n550\n00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,040\nAnd so, if we were to just go over and\ndrop a bomb on the main site, then,\n\n551\n00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,620\nwhat would happen is\nthe primary site goes away.\n\n552\n00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,610\nThe secondary hot site is up and\nrunning and mirrored in real time.\n\n553\n00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,560\nThere's no loss of data continuity.\n\n554\n00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,760\nNo loss of systematic integrity.\n\n555\n00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,070\nEverything is still available, customers\nare still connected, nothing gets lost.\n\n556\n00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,090\nWe may have a minor failover\nin a system in a sense that\n\n557\n00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,950\nit is going to failover actively\nin real time typically, but\n\n558\n00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,865\nthere's really no loss of continuity,\nvery minimal loss of continuity there.\n\n559\n00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:48,975\nA warm site is set up, fully functional,\nready to go, has computers,\n\n560\n00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,175\nhas data loaded.\n\n561\n00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,485\nIt's not fully mirrored live in real time.\n\n562\n00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:53,585\nWe're probably running a day or\n\n563\n00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:57,585\ntwo behind because we have\nto load data from a back up.\n\n564\n00:28:57,585 --> 00:29:00,785\nSo there is some lag time\nin bringing up a warm site.\n\n565\n00:29:00,785 --> 00:29:04,275\nBut we're talking about several hours\nto restore data to bring us into full\n\n566\n00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,530\ncompliance with where the primary\nsite was when it went down.\n\n567\n00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,050\nBut we can run the business from\nthere almost immediately, very,\n\n568\n00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,110\nvery minimal amount of downtime\nto get back up and running.\n\n569\n00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,710\nA cold site is basically a shell, right?\n\n570\n00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,260\nAnd so, a cold site is really nothing\nmore than probably a building\n\n571\n00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,935\nthat has some furniture that\nmay be stored in an area.\n\n572\n00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:25,175\nSome maybe desks and\nchairs and things like that.\n\n573\n00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:29,455\nHas wiring, has power, has HVAC but\nas a result, really we have to\n\n574\n00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:32,815\nroll in the computers, unbox them,\ntypically because they're all stored.\n\n575\n00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:35,315\nWe have to build out the infrastructure,\nin other words.\n\n576\n00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,215\nAnd this could take days or\nweeks in order to bring it back up.\n\n577\n00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:40,305\nIt's not actually wired up,\nset, ready to go.\n\n578\n00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:42,765\nAlthough there's power and things like\nthat that are in the building and\n\n579\n00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:43,710\nwired up.\n\n580\n00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,200\nBut we don't have the network setup,\n\n581\n00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,620\nwe typically don't have\nthe computers in place.\n\n582\n00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,240\nWe have to build all that stuff out.\n\n583\n00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,790\nSo that's gonna take longer.\n\n584\n00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,120\nAnd then a mobile site is really just\na site that is literally mobile.\n\n585\n00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,060\nIt's on the back of a trailer typically,\nor in a trailer trucked around.\n\n586\n00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,020\nTypically, an 18-wheel trailer.\n\n587\n00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,740\nSomething like that gets brought in.\n\n588\n00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,428\nSo it's like a mobile command center.\n\n589\n00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:06,570\nSo after 9/11, we saw this happening\nin New York and these places where\n\n590\n00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,690\nAll this infrastructure was just totally\ntaken out when the towers came down.\n\n591\n00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,560\nAnd very quickly thereafter, the telco\nproviders rolled in these mobile command\n\n592\n00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,420\nsites and mobile switching sites and\nbrought them in on trailers and so for\n\n593\n00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,730\nmonths and in some cases years afterwards,\nyou saw these just sitting on the sides of\n\n594\n00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,710\nthe road hooked up to generators\nrunning critical infrastructure.\n\n595\n00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,210\nThey were effectively running their\ntelephone networks out of these trucks.\n\n596\n00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,800\nBecause everything that was underneath\nthe buildings has been buried and\n\n597\n00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,920\nwas probably destroyed, and\n\n598\n00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,810\nso these are the kind of things we see\nwhen we talk about recovery alternatives.\n\n599\n00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,820\nSo we wanna make sure you're\nfamiliar with them and\n\n600\n00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,180\njust have a working knowledge of them.\n\n601\n00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,870\nObviously hot sites are very\nexpensive to maintain.\n\n602\n00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,940\nThey're probably the most expensive.\n\n603\n00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,425\nWhere as warm sites a little bit less and\ncold sites obviously much lower.\n\n604\n00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:55,375\nBut as a result, the expense that we spend\nup front means that we have a real time\n\n605\n00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:59,090\nactive fail over scenario\nwhere we don't go offline.\n\n606\n00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,400\nAnd so we have to just weigh that and\n\n607\n00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,660\nreally understand that to really\nunderstand what that means.\n\n608\n00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,780\nA mobile site could be almost like\na hot site in the sense that if you\n\n609\n00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,470\nalready have the truck prepositioned,\nand the trailer's there,\n\n610\n00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,280\nall you have to do is plug it in and\neffectively power it up.\n\n611\n00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,500\nIt's not immediate fail over, but\nit is, we're talking about minutes or\n\n612\n00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,070\nmaybe an hour as opposed to\nhours to days kind of thing.\n\n613\n00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,490\nSo it's very, very quick if you power it\non, these things come self-contained,\n\n614\n00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,470\nthey have their own generators.\n\n615\n00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,740\nAnd their own power hookups, they just\nspool the 120 to 220 lines out and\n\n616\n00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,670\nhook them up, and\nthey're pretty much up and ready to go.\n\n617\n00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,790\nSo they're kinda interesting\nif you've never seen one, so\n\n618\n00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,930\nit is kind of interesting so\njust be aware of that.\n\n619\n00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,140\nSo obviously we want to make sure\nwe're thinking about how to review\n\n620\n00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,960\nthrough our business continuity area,\nour business continuity planning.\n\n621\n00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,220\nWant to make sure we take a look\nat what it means to review a plan.\n\n622\n00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,510\nYou know how often should we do this?\n\n623\n00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,490\nI often get asked.\n\n624\n00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,400\nWe have a plan.\n\n625\n00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,160\nWe have a sense of what\ngoes into the plan.\n\n626\n00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,960\nWe do the business impact analysis.\n\n627\n00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,840\nWe put our CBFs in the plan.\n\n628\n00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,120\nWe document our MTDs and\nour RTOs and our RPOs.\n\n629\n00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,952\nAnd we have out SLAs to help manage\nall that, but after all that,\n\n630\n00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:05,380\nhow often do we review the plan?\n\n631\n00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,782\nAnd this is a question that a lot of\nus struggle with cuz we may not be very\n\n632\n00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:12,593\nknowledgable about this cuz we may not\nhave had to create this start to finish as\n\n633\n00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:13,640\na solution.\n\n634\n00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,000\nAt a minimum we say, as a best practice,\n\n635\n00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,900\nyou need to go through this plan\nat least once a year, right?\n\n636\n00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,250\nHopefully companies are doing it more than\nthat but at a minimum at least once a year\n\n637\n00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,980\nyou should obviously have\nregular testing of the plans.\n\n638\n00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,538\nThis'll be the same talk track for\n\n639\n00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:30,661\nthe disaster recovery planning as\nwell by the way, when we get to it.\n\n640\n00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:34,430\nSo we should be going through and\nshould be looking at it.\n\n641\n00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,680\nOnce we do that if we find\nthat we have any deviations,\n\n642\n00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,260\nnew systems have been brought online,\nthings have change and\n\n643\n00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,580\nthey obviously will over the course of\na year, we need to make sure we have\n\n644\n00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,880\na planning cycle that allows us to do\nan update or several updates to this plan.\n\n645\n00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,780\nSo we have to think about\nhow to do those updates and\n\n646\n00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,390\nmake sure we're integrating that\ninto part of our plan review, so\n\n647\n00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,865\nplease be aware of that and\nthink of that as well.\n\n648\n00:32:55,865 --> 00:32:59,345\nThere are several places where we\ncan get information about BCP.\n\n649\n00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:03,815\nThis is continuity planning and\nDRP, disaster recovery planning.\n\n650\n00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,365\nThe Disaster Recovery Institute,\nDRI, is one of them, and\n\n651\n00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:12,605\nwe do wanna make sure that you're\naware of DRI, I should say.\n\n652\n00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:15,185\nSo, Mike's gonna go ahead and\njust pull up DRI for you.\n\n653\n00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:18,423\nI think it's dri.org if I remember\ncorrectly, but you may just wanna do,\n\n654\n00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:24,120\nyou try dri.org or\njust try Disaster Recovery International.\n\n655\n00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,411\nNope, that's the defense [INAUDIBLE],\nwrong one, sorry about that.\n\n656\n00:33:26,411 --> 00:33:29,760\nTry Disaster Recovery Institute and\n\n657\n00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,410\njust see what we come up with there,\ninternational.\n\n658\n00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:40,606\nAnd so DRI which is that one right there,\ndri.org.\n\n659\n00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:44,070\nDidn't we just do dri.org?\n>> DRII, they got an- [CROSSTALK]\n\n660\n00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,069\n>> Okay, drii.org,\n\n661\n00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:46,600\nokay right there you go.\n\n662\n00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,600\nSo DRI.org is gonna be a great\nsource of information for\n\n663\n00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,570\nyou, something you definitely\nshould look at and consider.\n\n664\n00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,280\nAnd there's other sites, but this site\nwill be a jumping off point for you.\n\n665\n00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,970\nSo at least take a look at that and\njust be aware of that.\n\n666\n00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,940\nThere's also a couple of ISO standards and\n\n667\n00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,460\nANIS standards you probably\nwant to be familiar with here.\n\n668\n00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,020\nWe have them noted for you.\n\n669\n00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,230\nOn the screen, ISO 25999,\nas you can see there, ISO 27,001,\n\n670\n00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,930\nso 27001 is another standard, and\n\n671\n00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:19,835\nyou can find these by going and\njust searching for the ISO standards and\n\n672\n00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:23,435\ngetting the overview pages and\nthen maybe a PDF from the library.\n\n673\n00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:26,915\nRemember, typically, ISO standards\nmay cost you a little bit of money.\n\n674\n00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:30,575\nOnce they are formally promulgated,\nthey tend not to be free.\n\n675\n00:34:30,575 --> 00:34:31,923\nBut just at least be aware of them.\n\n676\n00:34:31,923 --> 00:34:35,815\nAnd then ANIS standard,\nwhich is ANIS special publication 800-34,\n\n677\n00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:40,475\nrev one, or revision one went\nrecently underwent a revision,\n\n678\n00:34:40,475 --> 00:34:43,730\nis also a really good source of\ninformation within the US and\n\n679\n00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,860\ninternationally as well around\nbusiness continuity planning.\n\n680\n00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,660\nJust making sure we understand that.\n\n681\n00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,660\nThe ISO 25999 series is all about\nbusiness continuity management.\n\n682\n00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:58,720\nIt really has under it's master umbrella\nthere, the ideas of risk management,\n\n683\n00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,580\ndisaster recovery,\n\n684\n00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,830\nbusiness continuity management,\nall the aspects that are involved.\n\n685\n00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,210\nThe 27000 series, ISO 27000 series\n\n686\n00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:12,490\nis about information security what we\ncall infosec generically and there's then\n\n687\n00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,210\ndifferent areas within the 27000 series\nthat focus on different elements.\n\n688\n00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,020\n27000 to one happens to be the business\ncontinuity management piece\n\n689\n00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,660\nrelated to information security,\nso there's some guidance there.\n\n690\n00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,590\nYou just want to make sure\nthat you're aware of that and\n\n691\n00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,216\nunderstand those as well.\n\n692\n00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:31,608\nYou have the BCM standard,\nthis comes to be management standard for\n\n693\n00:35:31,608 --> 00:35:36,013\n25999, was originally\npublished in 2006 and 2007.\n\n694\n00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:39,588\nSo it's getting to be around six to seven,\napproximately, give or take,\n\n695\n00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:42,360\nmaybe seven to eight-years-old\nat this point.\n\n696\n00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,560\nSo it has gone through some revisions.\n\n697\n00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,670\nThere is some review work that\nconstantly's going on around\n\n698\n00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,560\nthese standards.\n\n699\n00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,770\nYou wanna make sure you keep yourself\neducated on them and are aware of them.\n\n700\n00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,590\nThese are things to look at as you become\nmore integrated into the idea of business\n\n701\n00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,030\ncontinuity management.\n\n702\n00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,900\nAs a security professional, as you go out\nand practice through what BCP may mean in\n\n703\n00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,705\nyour world, these are the kinds of places\nwhere you can go to get some guidance and\n\n704\n00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:08,945\nto get some understanding of what other\nprofessionals in this industry are doing.\n\n705\n00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:11,965\nThere also are certain certifications\naround business continuity planning,\n\n706\n00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:15,585\nyou can become a certified business\ncontinuity planner and you can go out and\n\n707\n00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:20,135\nactually seek those certifications\nseparately as part of a more broad focus\n\n708\n00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:25,740\nin your information security career around\nBCP and DRP if you choose to do so.\n\n709\n00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,340\nSo that's gonna basically take us to\nthe point where I think we can wrap up our\n\n710\n00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,900\nconversation around BCP and\nthis particular segment.\n\n711\n00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,800\nWe're gonna come back and\n\n712\n00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,880\ntalk to you about disaster recovery\nplanning in just a few minutes.\n\n713\n00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,010\nAnd we'll wrap up our conversations there\nwith disaster recovery planning and\n\n714\n00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,990\nbackup and recovery strategies.\n\n715\n00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,480\nThings like the concept of RAID and\nbacking up and fault tolerance and\n\n716\n00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,600\nall that kind of stuff will be discussed.\n\n717\n00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,666\nSo we'll look forward to seeing\nyou there in just a few.\n\n718\n00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:55,887\n[SOUND]\n[SOUND].\n\n719\n00:36:55,887 --> 00:37:00,340\nAll right welcome back to our\ndisaster recovery planning episode.\n\n720\n00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,360\n>> Oh jazz hands.\n\n721\n00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:01,860\nYay.\n>> Yay.\n\n722\n00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,261\n>> All right very good, so\n\n723\n00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:05,230\ndisaster recovery right.\nSo,\n\n724\n00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,330\nwe were talking in the last episode\nabout business continuity planning.\n\n725\n00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,870\nWe made a break,\na very big distinction between the two.\n\n726\n00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:15,200\nWe broke them up because we wanted to\nreally focus on each as a specific topic\n\n727\n00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,420\nto make you aware of the differences.\n\n728\n00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,088\nAnd so remembering that business\ncontinuity planning, right,\n\n729\n00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:25,487\nis really about making sure we understand\nwhat it is that we need to focus on that\n\n730\n00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:29,688\nis mission critical to the business,\nhow do we keep the business running,\n\n731\n00:37:29,688 --> 00:37:34,515\nin effect, what's required there to make\nsure that we understand what is critical.\n\n732\n00:37:34,515 --> 00:37:38,221\nThe business impact analysis sets up our\ncritical business functions as we talked\n\n733\n00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:41,763\nabout and you can see on the screen there\nin front of us, or rather off to the side\n\n734\n00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:45,901\nthere, but business continuity planning,\nkeeping those critical business functions,\n\n735\n00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:48,157\ndocumenting them,\nlooking at risk management,\n\n736\n00:37:48,157 --> 00:37:52,490\nunderstanding the difference there between\nrisk analysis, business impact analysis.\n\n737\n00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,820\nBut really understanding how to get\nthe business impact analysis and\n\n738\n00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,720\nthen the CBF the critical\nbusiness functions.\n\n739\n00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,270\nIn disaster recovery\nplanning we're down towards,\n\n740\n00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,435\nI think, a little bit further down,\nwe did DRP right there,\n\n741\n00:38:03,435 --> 00:38:07,830\nrecovering the business process to what\nwe would consider it to be normal, right?\n\n742\n00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:12,370\nThe quoted air, the air quotes there,\njust like air guitar, but for IT.\n\n743\n00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,530\nSo the air quotes for normal,\nyou know what, normal is relative.\n\n744\n00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,810\nAnd I often, when I talk about.\n\n745\n00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,710\n>> Sorry.\n>> You sounded like you were reflecting on\n\n746\n00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,240\nsomething there for just a minute, right?\n\n747\n00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,285\nSo, you know what,\nwe think about what normal may be, right?\n\n748\n00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:28,930\nI often have this conversation with my\nstudents and sometimes with customers\n\n749\n00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,320\nbecause when we're sitting and\ntalking about what a disaster it is.\n\n750\n00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,290\n>> Right,\n>> And we think about,\n\n751\n00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,120\nis it a disaster,\nhow do we know and if it is,\n\n752\n00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,220\nwhat does that mean in relation to where\nwe have been and where we want to go.\n\n753\n00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,400\nMy definition of normal is gonna\nchange based on the time of day and\n\n754\n00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,087\nwhat I'm being asked to do.\n\n755\n00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:46,710\n>> Right.\n>> And so, normal for\n\n756\n00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,785\nme at 5 o'clock in the morning is not\nnormal for me at 7 o'clock in the evening.\n\n757\n00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,695\n>> Exactly.\n>> It's a very different thing.\n\n758\n00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,280\n>> Yep.\n>> So normal is this real sliding,\n\n759\n00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,610\nelastic scale.\n\n760\n00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:00,050\nThis colored filter that we use to vision\nthe world, and we have to understand and\n\n761\n00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,310\nthink about when we say we're covering\nthe business process to normal\n\n762\n00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,820\nthat what we really are focused on is\nwhat that average, that median, right,\n\n763\n00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,395\nis that mean, if you will,\nof what average is for the business.\n\n764\n00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:14,305\nIt's not hey, normal is this,\nnormal is that.\n\n765\n00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:18,125\nIt's really what is a normal day,\na normal process look like in our\n\n766\n00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:22,210\nworld if we didn't have this\ndisaster going on what would it be.\n\n767\n00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,770\nThat's what DRP is all about.\n\n768\n00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,060\nIt's about how to figure out what that is,\nand\n\n769\n00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,358\nget back to that process of normal,\nwhatever normal is.\n\n770\n00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:33,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so as a result, please keep\n\n771\n00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,350\nthat in mind, and understand that as\nwe begin our conversations here, right?\n\n772\n00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,950\nThis is really what we want\nto make sure we're aware of,\n\n773\n00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:43,340\nas we think about what it is,\nwhat a disaster is what it represents.\n\n774\n00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,948\nI'll remind you yet again of our focus on\nsafety and specifically the sanctity of\n\n775\n00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:52,825\nlife, right, as a security practitioner,\nas a SSCP potentially when you do certify\n\n776\n00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:57,460\nas an (ISC)2 member of the security\ncommunity, we uphold the code of ethics.\n\n777\n00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,334\nCode of ethics very clearly and\nvery unequivocally says safety of life and\n\n778\n00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:03,090\nsanctity of life above all else.\n\n779\n00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,794\nSo it is important to understand that this\nis really about making sure the people\n\n780\n00:40:06,794 --> 00:40:09,227\nthat are involved in our\nsystems every day are safe,\n\n781\n00:40:09,227 --> 00:40:13,080\nand that we safeguard the system and\nthe information as a secondary event.\n\n782\n00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,120\nOur secondary priority is\nto contain the damage.\n\n783\n00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,900\nSo, if we see a computer is on fire,\nright?\n\n784\n00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,960\nRight, we want to make sure that we\nsafeguard the people in the room,\n\n785\n00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,360\nthen we worry about safeguarding\nthe information that's in the computer.\n\n786\n00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,600\nNot the other way around.\n\n787\n00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,240\nRight?\n\n788\n00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,720\nSo don't take the people and\ntry to beat the fire out on the computer.\n\n789\n00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,290\nRight?\nThat's not a good idea.\n\n790\n00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:37,120\nEven if they happen to be interns, still\nnot appropriate, still not a good idea.\n\n791\n00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120\nBut all kidding aside, right,\n\n792\n00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,710\nobviously just a little bit of levity\nhere to lighten the day up for us,\n\n793\n00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,680\nbut the reality is we always want to make\nsure that we safeguard those people.\n\n794\n00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,825\nAnd so this brings up some\nInteresting opportunities for\n\n795\n00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:53,265\nus to do one of scenarios because\nup until several years ago if you\n\n796\n00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:57,435\nworked in data centers, and specifically\nin Knox in a network operation center and\n\n797\n00:40:57,435 --> 00:41:00,665\nyou had fire suppression gear,\nas many of them do in place,\n\n798\n00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:03,705\nyou would have probably been\nsitting in a room that had halon,\n\n799\n00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:08,255\npotentially in the data center at least in\nthe server rack area of the data center.\n\n800\n00:41:08,255 --> 00:41:13,550\nAnd if that halon went off, you probably\nhad a ten to 30 second kill switch delay\n\n801\n00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:17,580\nwhere you could either get out of the room\nor put on breathing gear before halon was\n\n802\n00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,780\nshot into the room under a high\npressure system to extinguish the fire.\n\n803\n00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,110\nThe way that was done was effectively by\nsucking all of the oxygen out of the room.\n\n804\n00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,700\n>> Right.\n>> Because halon reacts with oxygen and\n\n805\n00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,880\nbasically binds to it and kills the\nability for that oxygen to feed the fire.\n\n806\n00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,841\nIt also happens to kill any living,\nbreathing thing.\n\n807\n00:41:33,841 --> 00:41:36,421\n[CROSSTALK] It's very\neffective at doing that, but\n\n808\n00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:39,491\nit's also very effective at\nkilling people in the process.\n\n809\n00:41:39,491 --> 00:41:40,570\n>> I like my oxygen.\n\n810\n00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,827\n>> So one of the downsides of working at\ndata centers where halon was present,\n\n811\n00:41:43,827 --> 00:41:46,309\nis we had these big warning\nstickers all over the doors and\n\n812\n00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:48,250\neverything that said hey, halon present.\n\n813\n00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,220\nYou had to go through safety drills,\nknowing where your breathing gear was.\n\n814\n00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,000\nYou had to know how to get to it, how\nlong of a delay there was in the system\n\n815\n00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,900\nbecause, again, you typically had maybe a\n30 second delay before the halon shot off,\n\n816\n00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,430\nthe doors typically would slam closed\nto prevent the fire from spreading.\n\n817\n00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,454\nSo it's like one of those Star Trek\nepisodes where you're Spock stuck in\n\n818\n00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:09,925\nthe radiation chamber and you're talking\nto Jim Kirk on the other side going yeah,\n\n819\n00:42:09,925 --> 00:42:10,736\nyou're my buddy.\n\n820\n00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,973\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I wish you were here and\n\n821\n00:42:11,973 --> 00:42:12,537\nI was out there.\n\n822\n00:42:12,537 --> 00:42:13,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n823\n00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,934\nyou know the reality is you got to\nunderstand how to survive in these\n\n824\n00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:16,710\nsystems, right?\n\n825\n00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,940\nAnd so very, very important,\nbecause if a disaster was called, right,\n\n826\n00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,665\nthat system goes into effect and boom,\nif you're not paying attention or\n\n827\n00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:27,585\nyou're the newbie on the block that\nwasn't trained on what a breathing gear\n\n828\n00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:29,355\napparatus was, and where to get one.\n\n829\n00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:30,715\n>> Right.\n>> There could be a significant\n\n830\n00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,465\nproblem there.\n\n831\n00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,955\nYou may actually have a life and\ndeath situation.\n\n832\n00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:36,565\n>> Right.\n>> Same thing now where we see FM 200,\n\n833\n00:42:36,565 --> 00:42:40,050\nwhich has replaced halon because\nof the Montreal protocol,\n\n834\n00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,000\nthis idea of halon being bad for\nthe environment with the ozone.\n\n835\n00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,030\nWe replaced that and now we are using,\namong others, FM 200.\n\n836\n00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,600\nThere's a lot of other variables that\ncould be used there and other gases and\n\n837\n00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,260\nthings that could be used, but\n\n838\n00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,590\nFM200 is one of the big things\nthat's been used to replace halon.\n\n839\n00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:57,720\nStill, we have to make sure we're aware of\nthe fact that it's there and how to use\n\n840\n00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,070\nit, but secondary to life, ultimately,\nright, is the safety of property.\n\n841\n00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:06,320\nThese gases don't affect property,\nbut they can affect life.\n\n842\n00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,060\nSo just make sure we understand that.\n\n843\n00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,970\nAnd then third in the steps in a disaster,\n\n844\n00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,369\nis to understand how to assess the damage\nand begin recovery operations.\n\n845\n00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:17,764\nRight, so assess damage, begin recovery\noperations, also very important is\n\n846\n00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:21,580\nthe thought process there when we\ntalk about the steps in a disaster.\n\n847\n00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,640\nSo please be aware of\nthe fact that we will try our\n\n848\n00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,020\ngoal with disaster recovery planning\nis to, what's called return to normal.\n\n849\n00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,890\nWe talk about this is being return\nto normalcy, so restoral processes,\n\n850\n00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:35,990\nrestoral events,\n\n851\n00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,790\nrestoring normal is what the goal of\ndisaster recovery planning is all about.\n\n852\n00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,740\nAnd yes, the normal\n>> Put the air quotes on there for you.\n\n853\n00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,340\n>> The air quotes on there.\n\n854\n00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,230\nSee this is why flat communication\nwith things like email,\n\n855\n00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,770\nis not effective because\nyou don't get this.\n\n856\n00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,860\nThis is context.\n\n857\n00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,700\nYou can't get context without\nthe physical person being in the room and\n\n858\n00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,670\ninteracting with you.\n\n859\n00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,530\nJust seeing it on the page is not as\ncool as seeing me do this, right,\n\n860\n00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,330\nso that's why you need context.\n\n861\n00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:04,741\nBut make sure you know it's about return\nto normal, that's very important.\n\n862\n00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:07,249\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nsequencing of activities,\n\n863\n00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:08,720\nwhat do we do after a disaster?\n\n864\n00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,680\nWe talked about how we kind\nof lead up to the disaster.\n\n865\n00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,431\nWhat do you do after the disaster?\n\n866\n00:44:12,431 --> 00:44:16,102\nRight, we talked about having to respond,\nas you can see there on the screen,\n\n867\n00:44:16,102 --> 00:44:19,930\nresponding to the disaster, so\nthis is what's gonna effectively happen.\n\n868\n00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,590\nWe declare a disaster event.\n\n869\n00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,490\nAs a result, what are we gonna do?\n\n870\n00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,860\nThe initial response activities\nare gonna be activated.\n\n871\n00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,270\nThere may be an emergency response team.\n\n872\n00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:31,500\nThere may be a secondary\nsite we have to spin out.\n\n873\n00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,820\nThere's all these different\nthings that have to be done.\n\n874\n00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:39,240\nSo most critical functions, right,\nare gonna have some sort of redundancy and\n\n875\n00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,560\ncapability within the business so we have\nto understand how to initially respond,\n\n876\n00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,050\nand then we have to\nunderstand how to recover.\n\n877\n00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,990\nAnd recover can deal with\nthings like most critical\n\n878\n00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,180\nbusiness processes we just mentioned,\nreally taking priority and\n\n879\n00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,630\nmaybe being moved offsite,\nthings like that.\n\n880\n00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,840\nAnd the least critical\nfunctions will be restored last\n\n881\n00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,640\nwhere as most critical functions\nwill be restored first.\n\n882\n00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,700\nSo making sure that when we talk about the\nidea of recovery, doing the recovery team,\n\n883\n00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:11,960\nthat we look at our BIA, and we understand\nthe priority of our most common or\n\n884\n00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,740\nmost critical rather business functions,\nor CBFs.\n\n885\n00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,959\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe do our restoral prioritization,\n\n886\n00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,170\nand we really think about the fact\nthat we have to restore activities or\n\n887\n00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,680\ngo through these restoral activities in\nsuch a way, that we bring back online\n\n888\n00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,000\nthese systems that are gonna be\nmost valuable to the business.\n\n889\n00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,757\nNow having said that, what we often have\nto think about is do we want to plug in\n\n890\n00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:37,521\nthe most critical mission critical\nbusiness system first, taking a chance\n\n891\n00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:41,553\nthat everything is okay, or do we wanna\nturn on something like the coffee maker.\n\n892\n00:45:41,553 --> 00:45:44,317\nRight, and if we blow it up\nbecause the power spikes and\n\n893\n00:45:44,317 --> 00:45:47,262\nfluctuates, hey that sucks,\nwe don't have coffee, but\n\n894\n00:45:47,262 --> 00:45:51,408\nthe reality is we didn't just blow up\nour $5 million storage array, right, and\n\n895\n00:45:51,408 --> 00:45:55,435\nso we have to really think about the fact\nthat while we prioritize for recovery,\n\n896\n00:45:55,435 --> 00:45:59,462\nwe also have to bring common sense into\nthe mix and understand that it's usually\n\n897\n00:45:59,462 --> 00:46:03,005\nimportant to put our toe in the water\nbefore we jump into the deep end and\n\n898\n00:46:03,005 --> 00:46:05,709\nhope that there's enough\nwater in the pool, right,\n\n899\n00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:07,750\nthat we're not gonna hurt ourselves.\n\n900\n00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,400\nSo please be aware of that.\n\n901\n00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,790\nIf you have not lived through\none of these events and done so,\n\n902\n00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,240\nyou will come to find very quickly if you\ntalk to people that do this for a living,\n\n903\n00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,060\nthat while it's important to restore in a\nprioritized order, we tend to pick one or\n\n904\n00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:25,070\ntwo less critical systems, reenable them,\nmake sure things are stable, and\n\n905\n00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:28,090\nthen really bring online those most\ncritical business systems at that point.\n\n906\n00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:32,150\nSo just be aware of that,\nwe have restore as a function there,\n\n907\n00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,200\nI think we're up under\nrestore right there as well.\n\n908\n00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,810\nAnd so what we just wanna understand there\nis our salvage or resumption teams, right?\n\n909\n00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,740\nOur salvage teams are gonna move in,\n\n910\n00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,580\ntry to save what they can out of the\ndisaster site if there is a site to go to.\n\n911\n00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,440\nDepending on the nature of the disaster,\nand then they're obviously then going to\n\n912\n00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,980\nmake sure that they are bringing\nthose systems back online.\n\n913\n00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,310\nWe want to differentiate between\nrecovery and restore in this respect.\n\n914\n00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,685\nRecover is about putting most\ncritical systems online first,\n\n915\n00:46:58,685 --> 00:47:00,925\nleast critical systems online last.\n\n916\n00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:01,585\nRight.\nSo\n\n917\n00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:07,365\nrecovery is about most critical\nsystems online first, and\n\n918\n00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:11,607\nthen most critical systems, right, coming\nonline first, down to least critical.\n\n919\n00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:14,797\nKind of go most to least in that respect,\na sliding scale.\n\n920\n00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:18,937\nWhereas restore is about\ngoing least to most.\n\n921\n00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:22,905\nThis idea I just shared with you about\nplug in the coffee pot so you don't blow\n\n922\n00:47:22,905 --> 00:47:28,875\nup the array, is a restore process as\nopposed to a recovery process I said\n\n923\n00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:32,380\nthat once I was talking to somebody about\nI said you plug in the Xbox or something.\n\n924\n00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,040\nNo, no, no we can't do that it's the most\nimportant thing we can't do that.\n\n925\n00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,870\nThat comes absolutely last cuz we can't\npossibly survive without the Xbox.\n\n926\n00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,200\nGet rid of the coffee,\nget rid of email but we got to have Xbox.\n\n927\n00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,740\nSo whatever it is in your world just so\nyou understand, right?\n\n928\n00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,358\nSo understand the difference between\nrecovery and restore, a very important\n\n929\n00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:51,550\npivot point in relation to one being\nthe exact opposite of the other.\n\n930\n00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,568\nObviously want to resume normal\noperations after we reset and\n\n931\n00:47:54,568 --> 00:47:58,167\nverify that everything is working\ncorrectly so this is obviously gonna be\n\n932\n00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:01,590\nAn important file process for us and\nwell, for us as well I should say,\n\n933\n00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,800\nyou know making sure we have backups\nof our systems ahead of time.\n\n934\n00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,172\nWe're going to get into RAID function here\nin just a minute and talk about backing up\n\n935\n00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:13,280\nand restoring and full tolerance,\nyou know parody and all these things.\n\n936\n00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,440\nBut if we don't plan ahead and\nput in full tolerant systems and\n\n937\n00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,010\nwe don't decide to choose a striping\nsolution that does parody versus not\n\n938\n00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,490\nparody, we may find ourselves on the wrong\nend of that equation when we go to restore\n\n939\n00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:28,820\nbecause the information may or\nmay not be there in a usable form.\n\n940\n00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,050\nAnd as a result we may not actually have\nthe option of restoring except if we\n\n941\n00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,560\ndo a full system rebuild.\n\n942\n00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,360\nAnd that can take a lot longer and\nwe may actually have a problem\n\n943\n00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,870\nbecause we may not be able to get the\nparts involved with rebuilding right away.\n\n944\n00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:44,930\nWe, our area may be so devastated that\npeople can't get in and ship equipment in.\n\n945\n00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:47,700\nWe had this happen after Katrina,\ncertainly in New Orleans.\n\n946\n00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,850\nHad it happen here, in Florida,\n\n947\n00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:52,340\nafter some of the events you\nmentioned in our last segment,\n\n948\n00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,620\nsome of the rain events and the hurricanes\nthat came together back to back.\n\n949\n00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,080\nWe had problems when we couldn't\nget gas trucks in here.\n\n950\n00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,070\nWe had power but we couldn't,\nbecause the roads were impassable,\n\n951\n00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,706\nwe couldn't gas tankers to come in.\n\n952\n00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,890\nYou couldn't get UPS and\nFed Ex on the ground to deliver parts.\n\n953\n00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:09,130\nAnd so businesses might have been\nable to literally open their doors,\n\n954\n00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,030\nbut nobody could show up because\nthey couldn't get to work.\n\n955\n00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:16,970\nAnd so, this was a big issue, because the\nidea behind it was all the infrastructural\n\n956\n00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:20,850\nthings that needed to be in place were\nnot aligned, and so this became an issue.\n\n957\n00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,760\nOne of the big gotcha moments or,\nyou know epiphany moments,\n\n958\n00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,840\nduring the last round of storms in\nFlorida several years ago was that, and\n\n959\n00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,820\nyou may remember this if\nyou were living down here,\n\n960\n00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,020\nthis happened in South Florida especially\nwas that the gas stations had gas.\n\n961\n00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,020\nThey had no back up generators.\n\n962\n00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,430\n>> Right [INAUDIBLE] power yeah.\n>> They didn't have power.\n\n963\n00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,710\nAnd so there was a law that was passed\nthat said, after this whole thing\n\n964\n00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,160\nhappened, that now back up generators\nare mandatory for gas stations.\n\n965\n00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,030\nBecause they couldn't get\ngas out of the ground.\n\n966\n00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,220\nSo you had all these\npeople sitting around,\n\n967\n00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,840\nthere was power that was restored\neventually, but until the power came back,\n\n968\n00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,360\nyou couldn't actually get gas out\nof the ground to power anything.\n\n969\n00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,130\nOr rather, to put into cars to move,\n\n970\n00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,130\nbecause there was no\npower to drive the pumps.\n\n971\n00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:03,300\nWhich was crazy, because you had all these\ngas stations full of gas, and you couldn't\n\n972\n00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,670\nget any gas, you know, so nobody could go\nto work for like a week, it was just nuts.\n\n973\n00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,970\n>> Break out the rubber hose.\n\n974\n00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:08,570\n>> Yeah!\nYou're right,\n\n975\n00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,030\neverybody was trying to siphon gas,\nboy there's a fun activity.\n\n976\n00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:13,290\nIf you've never had\nthe opportunity to do that,\n\n977\n00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,160\nboy let me tell you, that is not\nsomething you want to mess around with.\n\n978\n00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:17,940\nNot good.\n\n979\n00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,680\nSo making sure we can understand\nhow to repair, right?\n\n980\n00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,830\nSystems replaced them, obviously, very\nimportant to do all of those things and\n\n981\n00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,800\nunderstanding what that\nwill ultimately mean.\n\n982\n00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,760\nYou know,\nwe talked a little bit in our last episode\n\n983\n00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,130\nabout recovery point objective,\nrecovery time objective.\n\n984\n00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,180\nMaximum Tolerable Downtime.\n\n985\n00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,060\nAll of these terminology items,\n\n986\n00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,760\nthese vocabulary terms\nthat we have talked about.\n\n987\n00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,360\nAnd so, making sure that we understand\nwhat that window is to restore operations.\n\n988\n00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,960\nVery important as well\nas we talk about this.\n\n989\n00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,620\nSo we have to test our plan and\n\n990\n00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,310\nthere's different ways to test our\ndisaster recovery plans, we want to make\n\n991\n00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:56,160\nsure that we think about the fact that we\ncan go through several different tests.\n\n992\n00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,450\nWe actually have five different tests or\nsequencing of tests.\n\n993\n00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,270\nthat we may choose to do.\n\n994\n00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,870\nI want to run through\nthem with you quickly\n\n995\n00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,210\nmake sure you're comfortable with them.\n\n996\n00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,030\nThis is the ways in which we can\ntest the disaster recovery plan.\n\n997\n00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:09,260\nWe have what's called a check\nlist a check list test.\n\n998\n00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,180\nThis is really just a reading\nwhere we kind of walk through\n\n999\n00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,160\nit looking at it ourselves.\n\n1000\n00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,050\nWe sit down at a desk and just walk\nthrough it real quickly and read it and\n\n1001\n00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:22,510\nas a result, we put a check mark literally\nin the box that says we ran through it.\n\n1002\n00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,770\nAnd we see what's there but\nwe don't actually pull the plan out and\n\n1003\n00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:27,690\nexecute it, we're not turning systems\noff and on or anything like that,\n\n1004\n00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,780\nit's really just a flat paper based test.\n\n1005\n00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,790\nWe then have what's called\na structured walkthrough test.\n\n1006\n00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,610\nA structured walk through test.\n\n1007\n00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,510\nSo a structured walk through test\n\n1008\n00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:43,940\nis going to be where we effectively\nare going to be going though and\n\n1009\n00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,930\neffectively get representatives\nfrom each department in a room.\n\n1010\n00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:51,700\nSo it's almost like role playing we sit\naround the table every team represents\n\n1011\n00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,090\ntheir portion of the plan to other\nteams we talk it through verbally and\n\n1012\n00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,920\ntalk about what we would do in the plan.\n\n1013\n00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,590\nBut this is not anything\nlike doing a live test.\n\n1014\n00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:04,020\nBut this is a step further down\nthe chain in terms of understanding\n\n1015\n00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,300\nthe complexity of plan.\n\n1016\n00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,530\nFrom the checklist task, which is sort\nof like senior management sitting around\n\n1017\n00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,970\nreading the plan and kinda off\nloading it and saying, yeah we saw it,\n\n1018\n00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,940\nit's there, put a check mark in the box,\nwe're good for the audit for\n\n1019\n00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,280\nthe next week, or the next month,\nor whatever it is.\n\n1020\n00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,760\nSo structured walk throughs,\n\n1021\n00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,890\ntypically also commonly referred to\nas table top exercise by the way.\n\n1022\n00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,150\nSo a structured walk through sometimes\ncalled a table top exercise because\n\n1023\n00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:29,460\neverybody sits around a table and talks\nabout what they're going to do, right.\n\n1024\n00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,810\nSo reviewing all\nthe objectives of the plan,\n\n1025\n00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:34,770\nmaking sure we understand what each\nparticipant is supposed to do.\n\n1026\n00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:35,500\nThat kind of thing.\n\n1027\n00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,790\n>> Right.\n>> We then have a simulation test.\n\n1028\n00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:41,100\nSimulation test is going to be\nmore than a paper exercise.\n\n1029\n00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,740\nSo, we're still sitting around in a room\nand we're talking about things, but\n\n1030\n00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,480\nwe're doing kind of a role play,\na what if scenario.\n\n1031\n00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,110\nIf you guys ever saw,\nI got a movie reference for you.\n\n1032\n00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,030\nYou remember War Games,\never watch War Games?\n\n1033\n00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:52,550\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So\n\n1034\n00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,365\nMatthew Broderick was probably 12\nyears old when this movie was shot.\n\n1035\n00:52:55,365 --> 00:52:56,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Him and Ally Sheedy,\n\n1036\n00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,170\nshe's probably all of 13.\n\n1037\n00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:01,430\nSo both of them really young,\nearly in their careers.\n\n1038\n00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,450\nBack in the 80s, and so\n\n1039\n00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:08,450\nthe idea there was that basically\nwe almost get into global thermal\n\n1040\n00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:12,870\nnuclear war because he hacks into a gaming\nsystem that he thinks is a gaming company.\n\n1041\n00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,790\nTurns out to be\nthe Pentagon's Whopper computer\n\n1042\n00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,200\nwhich is running war simulations, right.\n\n1043\n00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,390\n>> Yeah. Uh-huh. >> And he hacks into\nit and says, you know, and by the way,\n\n1044\n00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,430\njust a point of reference for\n\n1045\n00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,880\nyou, little friendly advice, if you ever\nget asked by a computer generated voice if\n\n1046\n00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,270\nyou wanna play a game\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1047\n00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,620\n>> Called Global Thermonuclear War,\n\n1048\n00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,395\nplease say no.\n\n1049\n00:53:30,395 --> 00:53:33,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just exercise caution, exercise,\n\n1050\n00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,560\nright, due diligence there,\nbe thinking ahead.\n\n1051\n00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,410\n>> Right.\n>> What could that mean\n\n1052\n00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:36,940\nfor me\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1053\n00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,770\n>> You know, may ruin my day.\n\n1054\n00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:41,510\nCould be a bit of an issue, so\nyou don't wanna do that, right?\n\n1055\n00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,320\nSo just a little friendly advice.\n\n1056\n00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,970\nBut the idea there was that basically he\ngoes in and effectively kicks of what he\n\n1057\n00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:51,920\nthinks is just a game, but it turns out\nto be a simulation, so it is a game.\n\n1058\n00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,190\nBut it almost becomes very real at the end\nwhere in effect computer takes over and\n\n1059\n00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,310\ntries to launch the missiles and\nstart the war to win the game.\n\n1060\n00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:01,020\n>> Yep.\n>> And so simulation tests are where\n\n1061\n00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,410\neverybody is involved, right?\n\n1062\n00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,140\nAll the members of the staff.\n\n1063\n00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,200\nAre gonna be involved and participate.\n\n1064\n00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,600\nSo everybody sitting at a desk,\n\n1065\n00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,360\nin their place, with their little\nname card, telling you what they do,\n\n1066\n00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,200\nand when it comes to their job, and\ntheir role, they stand up and say,\n\n1067\n00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,375\nokay, and I'm doing this and\nthis happened, and now we're over here.\n\n1068\n00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:20,975\nWe're calling these people and that's\nkind of what happens in the simulation.\n\n1069\n00:54:20,975 --> 00:54:23,375\nSo it is basically like\nplaying a video game.\n\n1070\n00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:25,115\nIt's a very good way of\nthinking about that, right?\n\n1071\n00:54:25,115 --> 00:54:27,145\nBut that's what a simulation test is.\n\n1072\n00:54:27,145 --> 00:54:30,035\nBut again it's intended\nto identify shortcomings.\n\n1073\n00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:32,465\nWe're not actually working on\nlive production environments.\n\n1074\n00:54:32,465 --> 00:54:36,895\nWanna make sure that we understand this,\nright?\n\n1075\n00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:41,700\nA parallel test Is gonna be the next\n[COUGH] stop down on the train.\n\n1076\n00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,910\nAnd a parallel test is where\nwe are usually conducting this\n\n1077\n00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:49,020\nat the alternate site, so the recovery\nsite, wherever that is gonna be.\n\n1078\n00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,890\nThat may be the hot site, the warm site,\nthe cold site, whatever it is.\n\n1079\n00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,600\nSo we're gonna send a team there,\nthey're gonna spin up the site,\n\n1080\n00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,039\nthey're gonna get it online,\nmake sure it's live and running.\n\n1081\n00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,240\nThey are then going to go ahead and\n\n1082\n00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,860\nthey are going to make sure they\nare talking to the primary site.\n\n1083\n00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,700\nAnd so they are going to\nunderstand what's going on there.\n\n1084\n00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,940\nIt's an operational test, right.\n\n1085\n00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,810\nSo we are not going to actually bring in\nall representatives from all areas of\n\n1086\n00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,180\nthe company, so we're not bringing in HR,\nwe're not bringing in sales and\n\n1087\n00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:16,770\nmarketing and those people.\n\n1088\n00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:19,630\nBut we are checking the efficacy,\nthe functionality and\n\n1089\n00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:23,010\nthe operational requirements and\nthe readiness of the parallel sites.\n\n1090\n00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:27,070\nWe're gonna load the data, go through that\ncycle to see what it would take to recover\n\n1091\n00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,860\nto get to the point where we would\ncut over and understand that.\n\n1092\n00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,490\nWe're not gonna actually go and\ncut over and fail over live.\n\n1093\n00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:37,400\nThat's gonna happen on the last test on\nwhat's known as a full interruption test.\n\n1094\n00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,110\nWell we are gonna get to that point.\n\n1095\n00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:42,061\nWe are gonna set the site up,\nrun through that full cycle and\n\n1096\n00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:44,910\nget to the point where we would\npull the plug and cut over.\n\n1097\n00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,908\nFull interruption testing is just that,\n\n1098\n00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:50,504\nliterally somebody goes to the parallel\nsite, sets it up, is ready to go,\n\n1099\n00:55:50,504 --> 00:55:53,840\nwe walk up and pull the plug in\nproduction and see what happens right?\n\n1100\n00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,659\nAnd hopefully everything shows up on\nthe other side, everything is working and\n\n1101\n00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:58,460\nit's all good.\n\n1102\n00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,500\n>> Right.\n\n1103\n00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,630\n>> Can't guarantee that will be the case.\n\n1104\n00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,750\n>> Some breath holding there.\n\n1105\n00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,500\n>> Little bit of breath holding,\nhoping everything works the right way.\n\n1106\n00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,480\nThis is often where we see, that we really\nfind the devil in the details right?\n\n1107\n00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,530\nBecause everything looks good on paper.\n\n1108\n00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,330\nEverything sounds like it will work.\n\n1109\n00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:16,580\nWe may have tested elements of failover,\nindividually for\n\n1110\n00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,120\nsystems to get the routing right,\nthings like that.\n\n1111\n00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,530\nSetting up our routing pathways,\nour redundancy, our secondary systems, yet\n\n1112\n00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,540\nwe do that in sections and segments.\n\n1113\n00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,490\nBut its almost impossible for\n\n1114\n00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:31,750\nus to do a full bore interruption test\nunless literally we are doing it because\n\n1115\n00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:35,285\nof DR or it's forced on us by\na natural disaster, one or the other.\n\n1116\n00:56:35,285 --> 00:56:38,220\nSo once a year, without fail at a minimum,\n\n1117\n00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:42,270\nthis has to be done because you don't\nreally know what you're gonna find there.\n\n1118\n00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,040\nYou don't know what's gonna happen.\n\n1119\n00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,010\nYou're not sure that this is\ngoing to work the right way.\n\n1120\n00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,490\nJust because this router failed over,\n\n1121\n00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:52,670\nisolated from everything else in\nthe system, doesn't mean it's going to\n\n1122\n00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:55,830\nwork that way when there's all these\nother things piling in on top of it.\n\n1123\n00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:59,630\nAnd I often find with customers as we walk\nthrough this, that this is the place where\n\n1124\n00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,890\nwe actually see that we're not\nas well prepared as we could be.\n\n1125\n00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,640\nWhere we do the full interruption test.\n\n1126\n00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,360\nSomething breaks, something\ndoesn't work the way it should and\n\n1127\n00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,600\nthat's where we all of a sudden\nhave this epiphany moment.\n\n1128\n00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,145\nAnd we say, oh well, if we'd only known.\n\n1129\n00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:13,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we would have done differently?\n\n1130\n00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:17,330\nSo just be aware of that, please make\nsure you're thinking about that.\n\n1131\n00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,580\nKnowing those testing the plan items,\nwhat are those plans,\n\n1132\n00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,970\nwill be very important to you as you\nlook to prepare to become an SSCP.\n\n1133\n00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,980\nSo what are some of the other issues?\n\n1134\n00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,630\nObviously, we talked about things like\navailability of resources, right?\n\n1135\n00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,060\nAre people able to get to work?\n\n1136\n00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,310\nCan they find the resources?\n\n1137\n00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,460\nCan they get what they need?\n\n1138\n00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,680\nDo we have things like power, batteries,\nback ups, generators all that stuff.\n\n1139\n00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,990\nAll that's important but at the end\nof the day if we have all that and\n\n1140\n00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,710\nwe don't have our data,\nit's great to have the systems running but\n\n1141\n00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,930\nwithout the data there\nisn't a lot we can do.\n\n1142\n00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,730\nAnd so, that's really.\n\n1143\n00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,630\n>> Solitaire maybe, I don't know.\n\n1144\n00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,100\n>> Not even potentially,\ndepends you may or\n\n1145\n00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,890\nmay not have installed the game\npack before you lost the OS.\n\n1146\n00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:54,970\nSo it's important.\n\n1147\n00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,786\nSo this is where smart phones come in\nbecause you obviously have games on your\n\n1148\n00:57:57,786 --> 00:57:58,314\nsmart phone.\n\n1149\n00:57:58,314 --> 00:58:01,168\nBecause you're a smart individual so\nyou have Bejeweled Blitz, or\n\n1150\n00:58:01,168 --> 00:58:03,400\nwhatever it is that you may be doing,\nright.\n\n1151\n00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,200\nBut the reality is, Candy Crush, right?\n\n1152\n00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,100\nWhatever it is.\n\n1153\n00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,960\nBut today, and it always has been,\nby the way, it's about the data.\n\n1154\n00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,140\nWe kid around about this kinda stuff, but\nthe reality is having the systems up and\n\n1155\n00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,630\nrunning, having the power is great.\n\n1156\n00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,420\nBut if we don't have the data in\nthe systems up-to-date to run with,\n\n1157\n00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,310\nwe unfortunately only have\n50% of the equation, right?\n\n1158\n00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,890\nAdd the people and maybe we have 65 or\n70% of the equation.\n\n1159\n00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:28,150\nBut we're still missing that critical\nthing that's gonna make everything go,\n\n1160\n00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,930\nthe catalyst that makes the people and\nthe machinery work and\n\n1161\n00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:31,840\nreally become productive.\n\n1162\n00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,790\nSo backing up data and\ntheir applications is critical.\n\n1163\n00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,430\nCritical to success.\n\n1164\n00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,880\nAnd so we have to talk about that.\n\n1165\n00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,860\nNo good discussion about disaster recovery\nwould be complete without backing up data\n\n1166\n00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,480\nand applications and\nunderstanding how to do this.\n\n1167\n00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,390\nWe talked to most security professionals,\nmost IT professionals\n\n1168\n00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:53,260\nwhether they do security or not by the\nway, and they have a good understanding.\n\n1169\n00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,670\nConceptually of the idea that\nbacking up data is important.\n\n1170\n00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:57,330\nWe tend to do this in our private lives.\n\n1171\n00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,650\nWe have our own PCs at home, typically.\n\n1172\n00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,430\nPictures of the kids,\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n1173\n00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:06,690\nSo, even individually, we tend to be\ncomfortable with the idea and cognizant or\n\n1174\n00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,260\naware of the idea that\nbacking up data is important.\n\n1175\n00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,140\nBut how often in your professional life,\nright?\n\n1176\n00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,380\nAnd we've all had these moments.\n\n1177\n00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,440\nI've had them, right?\n\n1178\n00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,423\nHow often have we said, oh yeah,\nI'll get to it, not a big deal, I'm busy.\n\n1179\n00:59:17,423 --> 00:59:20,744\nAnd then all of a sudden the inevitable\nhappens, and you lose something, and\n\n1180\n00:59:20,744 --> 00:59:23,470\nwe're sitting there going,\nwell I'm just an idiot, right?\n\n1181\n00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,520\nIf I only would have done that, right?\n\n1182\n00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,120\nBoy wouldn't I have saved myself\na lot of time and trouble.\n\n1183\n00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,570\nAnd so we always have good intentions,\nbut we also are human beings.\n\n1184\n00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,540\nAnd humans, let's be honest we're lazy.\n\n1185\n00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,500\nAnd we will take the path\nof least resistance.\n\n1186\n00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,980\nAs a result we tend to put this stuff off.\n\n1187\n00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,640\nThis is why as professionals,\n\n1188\n00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,090\nwe need procedures, we need policies we\nneed to make sure we have a checklist.\n\n1189\n00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:48,680\nAnd I talk about this with my students and\nmy customers a lot.\n\n1190\n00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,370\nI harp on the idea that you should\nliterally have a daily, a weekly,\n\n1191\n00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,190\na monthly, right?\n\n1192\n00:59:55,190 --> 01:00:00,500\nA quarterly, a semiannual and an annual\nchecklist about how you run your network.\n\n1193\n01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,838\nAnd so that's six different, six, six.\n\n1194\n01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:06,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's six different checklists\n\n1195\n01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,350\nthat I just went through.\n\n1196\n01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:09,964\nSo my question to you out there\nlistening to us right now,\n\n1197\n01:00:09,964 --> 01:00:13,299\nhow many of those checklists do you\nactually have in your environments?\n\n1198\n01:00:13,299 --> 01:00:16,400\nHow many of those do you work\nwith on a regular basis.\n\n1199\n01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,750\nSo you may be thinking\nto yourself oh my god.\n\n1200\n01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,940\nIt's bad enough already that I\ngotta do all this crazy paper work\n\n1201\n01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,560\nand all this stuff.\n\n1202\n01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,960\nNow you're telling me you need\nsix different checklists?\n\n1203\n01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,880\nSome of which talk about\nwhat I'm doing each day.\n\n1204\n01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,510\nYou gotta be kidding me, right?\n\n1205\n01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:33,120\nActually quite the opposite I'm not and\nI'm not suggesting that this is a way for\n\n1206\n01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,540\nyour boss to manage your life down\nto the minute minute level, and\n\n1207\n01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,960\nthat's not what this is about.\n\n1208\n01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:42,160\nWhat I'm suggesting is that this is a way\nfor you to prioritize the activities\n\n1209\n01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,710\nthat are critical to not only success,\nbut critical to survivability.\n\n1210\n01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,670\nFor you, your systems, your data, and\n\n1211\n01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:51,270\nthe people that you have to protect,\nultimately.\n\n1212\n01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:53,480\nBut daily check lists might be very\nsimple and might only have one or\n\n1213\n01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,150\ntwo things on it.\n\n1214\n01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,930\nAnd that might be, I made sure that\nwhen I logged onto my machine,\n\n1215\n01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,830\nthat I logged in using my domain account.\n\n1216\n01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,600\nAnd that if I ever walk away from\nthat machine during the day,\n\n1217\n01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,460\nI lock out the screen,\nbecause that way nobody can get into that.\n\n1218\n01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,580\nAnd that at the end of the day,\nwhenever I'm safeguarding my data and\n\n1219\n01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,330\nI'm saving everything I work on.\n\n1220\n01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:14,690\nI'm not saving it locally, I'm saving\nit back up to that network location,\n\n1221\n01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:15,660\nwherever it is.\n\n1222\n01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,330\nThat is then going to be backed up.\n\n1223\n01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:22,150\nSo that way the burden of data\nintegrity and data availability, and\n\n1224\n01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:25,760\nconfidentiality is being placed\non the network administration.\n\n1225\n01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,810\nRather than on me locally who's a user,\nwho's gonna forget to do it and\n\n1226\n01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,730\nscrew it up.\n\n1227\n01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:32,330\nAnd so it's maybe something that simple.\n\n1228\n01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,020\nIt's common sense best practices.\n\n1229\n01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,730\nBut these are the things we often miss.\n\n1230\n01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,470\nThese are the things we\nhave to think about.\n\n1231\n01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,010\nAnd so, think about those things.\n\n1232\n01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,345\nHow many of those checklists do you have?\n\n1233\n01:01:40,345 --> 01:01:42,145\nIf you don't have them, why not?\n\n1234\n01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:43,285\nThat would be what I would ask.\n\n1235\n01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:44,505\nRight?\n\n1236\n01:01:44,505 --> 01:01:45,835\nThere's never a good reason for that.\n\n1237\n01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,165\n>> Nope.\n>> There's always an opportunity\n\n1238\n01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:47,785\nto get better.\n\n1239\n01:01:47,785 --> 01:01:50,675\nBut there's no time for the present to\nstart thinking about getting better.\n\n1240\n01:01:50,675 --> 01:01:53,897\nSo backup solutions might be\nthings like going to disk, right?\n\n1241\n01:01:53,897 --> 01:01:57,287\nBacking up to disk or to tape you may\nhave a SAN, a Storage Area Network.\n\n1242\n01:01:57,287 --> 01:01:59,437\nYou may have Network Attached Storage,\na NAS device.\n\n1243\n01:01:59,437 --> 01:02:01,517\nThese are common in\nvirtualized environments and\n\n1244\n01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,067\ncloud environments today especially,\nright?\n\n1245\n01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:06,263\nIt's where we do our bulk storage and\nput stuff out on the network.\n\n1246\n01:02:06,263 --> 01:02:07,363\nMaybe tape storage, right?\n\n1247\n01:02:07,363 --> 01:02:09,023\nAre you still using tape?\n\n1248\n01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:10,863\nOld technology, but still pretty reliable.\n\n1249\n01:02:10,863 --> 01:02:11,893\nLot of tape out there.\n\n1250\n01:02:11,893 --> 01:02:16,413\nEspecially high speed, high capacity tape\nsystems today, DAT Tape Solutions etc.\n\n1251\n01:02:16,413 --> 01:02:17,543\nWhat about remote journaling?\n\n1252\n01:02:17,543 --> 01:02:18,283\nAre you journaling?\n\n1253\n01:02:18,283 --> 01:02:22,503\nSending those log files off site and\nremotely mastering and capturing them so\n\n1254\n01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:25,110\nwe can replay those\ntransactions into a database.\n\n1255\n01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,420\nIf we were to lose integrity in\nthe database for some reason.\n\n1256\n01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,350\nAnd so these are things to consider and\nreally be aware of.\n\n1257\n01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:34,160\nWe've talked about this recovery point\nobjective concept and want to make sure we\n\n1258\n01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,015\nremind you as we talked about\nbacking up data here about the RPO.\n\n1259\n01:02:38,015 --> 01:02:40,835\nThis is the point at which all\ndata must be recovered to, so\n\n1260\n01:02:40,835 --> 01:02:44,345\nthis is the amount of data that we can\neffectively afford to lose before we have\n\n1261\n01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:46,625\nto recover the data and\nget back to normal.\n\n1262\n01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:49,685\nPlease just be aware of that definition;\nit's further up on our list, but\n\n1263\n01:02:49,685 --> 01:02:51,540\njust be thinking about that.\n\n1264\n01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,700\nWe also wanna talk about\nthe kinds of backups that we have.\n\n1265\n01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,140\nWe often talk about full\nbackups as being the way to go.\n\n1266\n01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,790\nWe say well, I'll just do a full back up,\nwe'll have everything, and doing a full or\n\n1267\n01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,420\nwhats called a complete backup.\n\n1268\n01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:04,350\nIs very good, obviously.\n\n1269\n01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,070\nIf we could do that every day, great.\n\n1270\n01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,850\nBut the problem is our\ndata sets might be so\n\n1271\n01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,870\nbig today that we just\ndon't have enough time.\n\n1272\n01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,560\nSo we talk about this idea of big data.\n\n1273\n01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,520\nBig data, data sets that\nliterally may be petabytes or\n\n1274\n01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,750\nterabytes in size in these master\ndatabases, data warehouses.\n\n1275\n01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:23,190\nWe can't back that amount of data up,\nI don't care how fast your system is.\n\n1276\n01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:23,730\nIt's gonna be,\n\n1277\n01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:26,580\nwe're gonna get to the point where it's\njust physically impossible with today's\n\n1278\n01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,160\ntechnology to back up that\namount of data in a day.\n\n1279\n01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,910\nAs a result we just don't have\nthe ability to do full backups sometimes.\n\n1280\n01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,330\nWe might not have the network bandwidth,\nthe speed, and the capability.\n\n1281\n01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:40,130\nSo aside from full backups, we have\nto also talk about differential and\n\n1282\n01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,700\nincremental backups, and\nunderstand the differences between them.\n\n1283\n01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,060\nAnd make sure we really\nunderstand how to work with them\n\n1284\n01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,890\nin relation to a full\nbackup to affect a restore.\n\n1285\n01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:50,625\nIt's easy if you have a full back up.\n\n1286\n01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:53,385\nYou just take the last full backup,\nyou replay it in the system,\n\n1287\n01:03:53,385 --> 01:03:54,735\nall the data's there, and you're done.\n\n1288\n01:03:54,735 --> 01:03:55,525\nIt's very, very easy.\n\n1289\n01:03:55,525 --> 01:03:57,425\nVery straight forward.\n\n1290\n01:03:57,425 --> 01:03:58,545\nEverything is backed up.\n\n1291\n01:03:58,545 --> 01:04:01,425\nBut when we do a differential backup,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n1292\n01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:02,545\nSo let's talk about that.\n\n1293\n01:04:02,545 --> 01:04:05,022\nWe do a full backup along\nwith a differential,\n\n1294\n01:04:05,022 --> 01:04:07,255\na full backup along with an incremental.\n\n1295\n01:04:07,255 --> 01:04:09,330\nSo let's talk about the differences there.\n\n1296\n01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,840\nBut a differential backup, right.\n\n1297\n01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,700\nMaybe we do the full backup,\nlet's say, on Sunday, right.\n\n1298\n01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,150\nSunday night, maybe do a full backup,\nstart the week off.\n\n1299\n01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:18,750\nThen on Monday through Saturday\nwe'll do daily changes, right.\n\n1300\n01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:23,010\nThe daily changes are gonna be\ncaught with a differential backup.\n\n1301\n01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:28,530\nThe back up is going to capture\njust those differences, right?\n\n1302\n01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:32,980\nAnd as a result, if we then are gonna\neffectively have to restore, right?\n\n1303\n01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:37,860\nWhatever that may be,\nthen what's gonna happen is we're gonna\n\n1304\n01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:41,150\nneed the full backup, and let's say\nif we did a full backup on Sunday and\n\n1305\n01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,710\nwe did differentials on Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\n1306\n01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,170\nAnd we have an outage let's\nsay on Wednesday, just so\n\n1307\n01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:48,511\nwe don't have to recite the whole week.\n\n1308\n01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:50,488\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we have an outage on Wednesday.\n\n1309\n01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:52,270\nWe need the full back up from Sunday.\n\n1310\n01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:57,020\nWe need Monday's and Tuesday's\ndifferential backups in order to restore.\n\n1311\n01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,500\nSo we have to restore those in backup\npriority order, meaning Sunday,\n\n1312\n01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,150\nthen put on Monday's differential and\nTuesday's differential on top of that,\n\n1313\n01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:08,360\nto incrementally, or rather to add up\nall the differences and put them back.\n\n1314\n01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,910\nAnd so, just be aware of that.\n\n1315\n01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,670\nAnd so that's important because we need\nmultiple tapes in order to do the restore,\n\n1316\n01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:14,980\nand this is very important.\n\n1317\n01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:19,791\nThe backup flag, in other words, is going\nto be reset after each differential,\n\n1318\n01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:22,924\nand as a result of that-\n>> Differential or incremental?\n\n1319\n01:05:22,924 --> 01:05:24,319\n>> Did I say differential?\n\n1320\n01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:25,350\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n1321\n01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:25,863\n>> Incremental, right.\n\n1322\n01:05:25,863 --> 01:05:27,414\n[CROSSTALK] I'm sorry,\nwe're about to talk about incremental.\n\n1323\n01:05:27,414 --> 01:05:28,390\nI apologize.\n\n1324\n01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:29,630\nSo, we're getting those backups.\n\n1325\n01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:34,022\nWe're rather, we're getting the,\nlet's try that again.\n\n1326\n01:05:34,022 --> 01:05:36,645\n[LAUGH] We're getting\nthe differences captured and\n\n1327\n01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:39,330\nthen we're talking about the difference\nbetween differential and incremental.\n\n1328\n01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:40,570\nSo let's just make sure, right?\n\n1329\n01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,700\nSo let's replay that one more time and\n\n1330\n01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,870\njust do a back up and\nrestore on our knowledge process here.\n\n1331\n01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:49,210\nSo we do a differential back up and we'll\nstart, we're doing incremental there?\n\n1332\n01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:49,850\nWe're doing incremental.\n\n1333\n01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:50,658\nSo we do an incremental back up.\n\n1334\n01:05:50,658 --> 01:05:51,576\n>> [CROSSTALK] differential there.\n\n1335\n01:05:51,576 --> 01:05:52,794\nLet's do that one.\n\n1336\n01:05:52,794 --> 01:05:53,610\n>> Okay.\nSo we do a differential.\n\n1337\n01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,430\nThis is live by the way, no safety nets.\n\n1338\n01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:57,940\nSo you can see we obviously operate with\n\n1339\n01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,410\nthe full capability back up\nof authority of knowledge but\n\n1340\n01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:03,950\nwe do sometimes have a knowledge flub and\na knowledge momentary lapse.\n\n1341\n01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:06,810\nSo when we have a differential back up,\nlet's document that one.\n\n1342\n01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:09,650\nFull back up is made as we talked about.\n\n1343\n01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,890\nAnd as we go through, daily changes\nare gonna be captured along the way and\n\n1344\n01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:14,890\neach night's backup takes\na little bit longer.\n\n1345\n01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,630\nSo we're adding to it each night, right?\n\n1346\n01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,930\nSo we're gonna have that\nbackup along the way.\n\n1347\n01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:19,770\nI think I was describing\n\n1348\n01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:21,860\nthe incremental even though we\nwere talking about differentials.\n\n1349\n01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:22,870\nI apologize.\n\n1350\n01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,670\nBut basically the idea there is\nthat when we do the differential,\n\n1351\n01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,830\nwe're adding on\nthe differences every night.\n\n1352\n01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:31,010\nAnd so we need that full backup, and\nwe need the last differential backup,\n\n1353\n01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:33,420\nwhatever it was, Tuesday in our example.\n\n1354\n01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,530\nAnd we're replaying all\nthese changes off that tape.\n\n1355\n01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:38,780\nSo we're gonna have the backup,\nthe full backup and the differential.\n\n1356\n01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:42,530\nWhen we do the incremental, again maybe\nSunday night we do the incremental\n\n1357\n01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:44,930\nfull backup, or rather full backup.\n\n1358\n01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,890\nAnd then let's say we do incrementals,\nrather.\n\n1359\n01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:49,090\nOn a Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday night, etc.\n\n1360\n01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,790\nAnd so each night as we go through that,\n\n1361\n01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:55,370\nwe're making only that day's changes\nbeing recorded with the incremental.\n\n1362\n01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,840\nWe're resetting the backup flag\nafter every backup every night, and\n\n1363\n01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,610\nso we have multiple tapes\nthat we have to restore from.\n\n1364\n01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:06,610\nAnd so when we do an incremental, we need\nSunday's full backup, and Monday, Tuesday,\n\n1365\n01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:09,450\nlet's say if the issue was on Wednesday,\nMonday and\n\n1366\n01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,650\nTuesday's tape done in that order.\n\n1367\n01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:14,010\nSunday, then Monday, then Tuesday.\n\n1368\n01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:17,220\nAnd as a result of that we replay\nthose changes into the system.\n\n1369\n01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,660\nSo incremental backups\nreset the backup flag.\n\n1370\n01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,910\nI think we're capturing that.\n\n1371\n01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:23,510\nWhereas differential backups\ndon't reset the flag.\n\n1372\n01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:26,430\nWe simply capture the deltas of\nthe differences along the way.\n\n1373\n01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,280\nEach night as we go.\n\n1374\n01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,230\nAnd this then leads us to understand what\nthe difference is in terms of the time it\n\n1375\n01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:34,460\ntakes to restore, but also the number\nof takes that it takes to restore,\n\n1376\n01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,290\nassuming we're doing tapes,\nthe number of tapes and\n\n1377\n01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,910\nthe number of backups that\nit would take to restore.\n\n1378\n01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:41,530\nSo just wanna make sure that we're aware\nof that and we're thinking through that.\n\n1379\n01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:46,090\nAnd making sure that we\nhave a capture on that, or\n\n1380\n01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:49,410\na way to understand that in\nrelation to the amount of time.\n\n1381\n01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:51,250\nBut also the number of\ntapes that it will take.\n\n1382\n01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,290\nSo just be aware of that or\nbe thinking through that.\n\n1383\n01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:57,100\nIn addition, we want to quickly\ndiscuss raid levels, and\n\n1384\n01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,670\nmake sure that we are gonna be able to\ntalk about raid levels and just have kind\n\n1385\n01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:03,880\nof a good understanding, we've documented\nthe highlight of them there for you.\n\n1386\n01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,310\nAnd then we have a couple\nof pictures we'll\n\n1387\n01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:08,270\nthrow up on the screen in a minute as\nwell, just to help talk through this.\n\n1388\n01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:11,805\nBut the traditional raid levels that we\ntalk about, there are more by the way,\n\n1389\n01:08:11,805 --> 01:08:13,630\nthere's another bunch of RAID levels.\n\n1390\n01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,490\nThere's a RAID level two,\na RAID level three, RAID level four,\n\n1391\n01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,950\nRAID level six etc., but\nwe're really gonna focus on those.\n\n1392\n01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:23,200\nWe're gonna focus on RAID level zero, RAID\nlevel one, the combination of the two,\n\n1393\n01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,060\none plus zero was called RAID level\nten on the screen in front of you, and\n\n1394\n01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,520\nwe'll talk about RAID level five.\n\n1395\n01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,970\nThose are the main ones\nwe're gonna talk about,\n\n1396\n01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,930\nthe four main ones that we wanna focus on.\n\n1397\n01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,830\nRAID level zero is striping.\n\n1398\n01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:37,200\nIt is striping without parity,\nvery important to understand that.\n\n1399\n01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,420\nAnd so when we talk about RAID level one,\nwe talk about drive mirroring.\n\n1400\n01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,820\nWhen we talk about RAID level five,\n\n1401\n01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,790\nwe are talking about basically\na stripe set with parity.\n\n1402\n01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,020\nAnd when we talk about RAID level ten,\n\n1403\n01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:52,540\nwe're talking about raid level\none plus ten added together.\n\n1404\n01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:56,380\nAnd so we see on the screen here RAID\nlevel zero which is just a stripe.\n\n1405\n01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,440\nYou'll see block 1 and then block 2.\n\n1406\n01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,260\nBlock 1 on the left and\nblock 2 on the right.\n\n1407\n01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,560\nBlock 3 on the left and\nblock 4 on the right.\n\n1408\n01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,850\nAnd what we're doing is,\nwe take two hard drives, right?\n\n1409\n01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:09,860\nAnd we are writing across those drives\nin 64 kilobit stripes or chunks of data.\n\n1410\n01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:12,230\nAnd we're striping,\nit's almost like painting a line.\n\n1411\n01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,140\nWe're painting all the way across,\nwe stop,\n\n1412\n01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,590\nwe come back,\nwe paint again all the way across.\n\n1413\n01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:18,620\nOr if you're familiar with a typewriter,\nright?\n\n1414\n01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,128\nOld school technology you may or\nmay not have seen.\n\n1415\n01:09:21,128 --> 01:09:22,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You could visit one in a library,\n\n1416\n01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,330\nif you ever know where one of those are.\n\n1417\n01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:26,550\nBut if you can ever find a typewriter,\n\n1418\n01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:28,420\nwe might want to throw\na picture up of a typewriter.\n\n1419\n01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:29,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if you do that,\n\n1420\n01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:32,650\nwhat you would see is that the typewriter\nruns across the edge of the page here.\n\n1421\n01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:35,750\nIt kind of types the text,\nthe line goes to the end, ding.\n\n1422\n01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:38,410\nIt comes back, and it resets and\nthen you type across again.\n\n1423\n01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:39,290\nThis is basically the-\n>> Right.\n\n1424\n01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:40,350\n>> Concept of stripe.\n\n1425\n01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:43,770\nSo the data stripe is 64 kilobits in size,\ntraditionally.\n\n1426\n01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:46,850\nAnd we stripe across both\ndrives equally as we go.\n\n1427\n01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,500\nData is therefore written\nin blocks across.\n\n1428\n01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,240\nAnd the downside to this is\nsince there is no parity,\n\n1429\n01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,500\nthere is no what we call fault\ntolerance with a RAID level 0 stripe\n\n1430\n01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,020\nif we are to lose one of the drives\nin the system, if one were to fail.\n\n1431\n01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,160\nSo let's just hypothetically say\nwe block out or X out drive 1,\n\n1432\n01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,730\nor what we would call drive 1 on the left.\n\n1433\n01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:08,610\nAs a result, the stripe becomes\nunreadable and operable.\n\n1434\n01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:11,094\nWe lose all the data even though\nhalf of it is still available.\n\n1435\n01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:12,267\n>> [CROSSTALK] too, is unavailable.\n\n1436\n01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:13,274\n>> Because in effect,\n\n1437\n01:10:13,274 --> 01:10:17,370\nthat stripe no longer has the ability to\nactively provide that data to us, right?\n\n1438\n01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:20,040\nThere's no integrity, as we would say,\nto the stripe any more.\n\n1439\n01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,000\nUnless we have a backup.\n\n1440\n01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,700\nIn which case, then obviously we could\npotentially restore that entire solution.\n\n1441\n01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:28,340\nWe'd have to replace the physical drive\nand then restore the data as a result.\n\n1442\n01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,370\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1443\n01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:30,400\nSo that's RAID level zero.\n\n1444\n01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,830\nStriping with no parity.\n\n1445\n01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:33,510\nTwo drives required, right?\n\n1446\n01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:35,700\nThey must be on average the same size or\n\n1447\n01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,210\nat least have the same amount\nof storage available on them.\n\n1448\n01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:40,560\nWe set the stripe up but\nthere is no fault tolerance, and\n\n1449\n01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,230\nno parity associated with that.\n\n1450\n01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:45,400\nWhen we deal with RAID level one,\nwe have mirroring, as you can see here.\n\n1451\n01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,540\nAgain, same model.\n\n1452\n01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,920\nDrive on the left,\ndrive on the right, disk 1, disk 2.\n\n1453\n01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:54,373\nNotice that blocks are equally distributed\nbetween both drives, block 1, block 2,\n\n1454\n01:10:54,373 --> 01:10:55,780\nblock 3, block 4.\n\n1455\n01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:58,730\nExact duplicate copy on\nboth physical drives.\n\n1456\n01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:03,240\nAs a result of that if one drive were to\nfail we effectively have the exact data\n\n1457\n01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,650\ncopied over and available live\nin real time on the other side.\n\n1458\n01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:09,940\nThe only difference may be, depending on\nthe nature of failure, if the controller\n\n1459\n01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:13,130\nwere to go down, we may have to swap out\nthe controller in the box, physically,\n\n1460\n01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:14,470\nto get the drive to come back up.\n\n1461\n01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,510\nWe may have to break the mirror and\nchange the drive order.\n\n1462\n01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:20,040\nSo there may be some administrative\nstuff that has to happen there.\n\n1463\n01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,020\nA little bit of tinkering to\nmake the drive available to us.\n\n1464\n01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,200\nBut, integrity of the data is intact.\n\n1465\n01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:25,960\nThat's the main thing.\n\n1466\n01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:26,800\nIt is there.\n\n1467\n01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,690\nMirroring can either be done with software\nor hardware controllers, by the way.\n\n1468\n01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:32,980\nSo, this is typically\na software thing in Windows.\n\n1469\n01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:36,260\nWe do it with typically a software\nsolution where we can write\n\n1470\n01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,200\nthrough the OS.\n\n1471\n01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,730\nThere are hardware controllers that\ncan do RAID level one arrays for us.\n\n1472\n01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,180\nSo servers, typically, not desktops,\nbut servers more often than not\n\n1473\n01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,490\nwill have these hardware controllers\nthat will perform the mirroring for us.\n\n1474\n01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:50,010\nWe set them up in the BIOS.\n\n1475\n01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:50,930\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1476\n01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:51,710\nThat's RAID level 1.\n\n1477\n01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:54,170\nThis is fault tolerant by the way.\n\n1478\n01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:57,077\nAnd when we do RAID level 1 with\nfault tolerant hardware, so\n\n1479\n01:11:57,077 --> 01:11:59,420\nthat extra controller\nthat we just spoke about?\n\n1480\n01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,950\n>> Yeah duplex [CROSSTALK].\n\n1481\n01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,630\n>> Then we get what's call disk duplexing,\nexactly.\n\n1482\n01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:06,271\nSo we get RAID level 1, which is\njust the drives being mirrored but\n\n1483\n01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:09,450\nwe can add hardware capability for\nthe controllers.\n\n1484\n01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,706\nAnd we add that and\nwe call that RAID level 1 plus duplexing,\n\n1485\n01:12:11,706 --> 01:12:12,690\nwhich is-\n>> Looking for\n\n1486\n01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:14,010\nthose single points of failure.\n\n1487\n01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:14,950\n>> Single points of failure.\n\n1488\n01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:15,710\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n1489\n01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:17,690\nAnd so then we have RAID level 5.\n\n1490\n01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:21,100\nWe'll come back and\ndo the combo RAID level one plus zero.\n\n1491\n01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,928\nOr RAID level ten in just a minute.\n\n1492\n01:12:22,928 --> 01:12:25,590\nRAID level five is striping plus parity,\nand\n\n1493\n01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:28,070\nwhat we get there is the same\nconcept as the stripe set.\n\n1494\n01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:32,630\nWe write the data across the drive in\nstripes, but with a unique variable.\n\n1495\n01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,400\nAnd so we need a minimum, first of all,\n\n1496\n01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,290\nof three drives to do a stripe\nset with parity, not two.\n\n1497\n01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,300\nWe're gonna do it with a stripe set.\n\n1498\n01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:42,670\nAnd we have a maximum, typically, of 32\ndrives on this because we can only go out\n\n1499\n01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:45,940\nto 32, given the nature of the software\nsolutions that are implemented to\n\n1500\n01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:49,025\nimplement striping today,\nour RAID five striping with parity today.\n\n1501\n01:12:49,025 --> 01:12:52,970\nAnd most major operating systems\nwe do this in a software way.\n\n1502\n01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:56,295\nAnd so we start with three drives in\na minimum, again standardized storage\n\n1503\n01:12:56,295 --> 01:12:59,200\nmeaning they must have the same\navailable storage space.\n\n1504\n01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,980\nOne can be bigger than the other's but\nthe partition space has to be\n\n1505\n01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:05,820\nequal to the smallest amount available\non the smallest of the drives.\n\n1506\n01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,620\nHaving said that, we create\nthe partitioned area for the striped set.\n\n1507\n01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:13,436\nWe take A and if we do and\njust take a look at A1 up there.\n\n1508\n01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:15,340\nAnd A2, so left to right.\n\n1509\n01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:20,630\nAnd then Ap which is parity for A, and\nthen we see B1, B2 and Bp which is parity.\n\n1510\n01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:23,470\nC1, C2, and in green Cp for parity.\n\n1511\n01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:26,130\nAnd D1 and D2 and then Dp for parity.\n\n1512\n01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:30,926\nYou'll notice we have a parity stripe\nscattered somewhere, or a parity partition\n\n1513\n01:13:30,926 --> 01:13:35,110\nscattered somewhere across one of\nthe three drives for A B C and D..\n\n1514\n01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,650\n>> So all of the parity\nis not on the same drive?\n\n1515\n01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:38,140\n>> Not all on the same drive, number one.\n\n1516\n01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:41,690\nAnd number two,\nif we were to lose any one of those drives\n\n1517\n01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:44,830\nwe could reconstitute\nthe remaining information.\n\n1518\n01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:48,880\nWhether it's the parity stripe, or the\npartition stripe, you know the information\n\n1519\n01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,440\nthat's not on the parity, depending on\nwhat we lose, we can regenerate it from\n\n1520\n01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,360\nthe parity information that's maintained\nin the other areas of the drive.\n\n1521\n01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,690\nAnd so as a result we can fully recover.\n\n1522\n01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:01,520\nThis does take time, by the way, this is\nnot like boom just put the drive back in,\n\n1523\n01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,960\noh we're back up and running.\n\n1524\n01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,690\nWe have to do what's called\nregenerating the stripe set, right?\n\n1525\n01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,830\nSo we effectively replace the physical\nmember that has gone bad,\n\n1526\n01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:12,750\nand then there's a software process\nthat kicks in, a service that kicks in.\n\n1527\n01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,880\nAnd will effectively rewind and\n\n1528\n01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,845\nreplay those parity stripes back onto\nthe the drive to reestablish parity.\n\n1529\n01:14:18,845 --> 01:14:20,255\nSo that will take time.\n\n1530\n01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,845\nThe system performance slows\ndown during this time.\n\n1531\n01:14:22,845 --> 01:14:25,385\nSo we can still access\nthe parity information.\n\n1532\n01:14:25,385 --> 01:14:27,335\nStill access the spread, get our data.\n\n1533\n01:14:27,335 --> 01:14:28,805\nBut, performance definitely takes a hit.\n\n1534\n01:14:28,805 --> 01:14:30,560\nIt will be slower during this time, but\n\n1535\n01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,780\nit is fault tolerant and\nwe wanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n1536\n01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:38,400\nMinimum of three, maximum of 32 drives\navailable in the stripe set with parity.\n\n1537\n01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,730\n>> And we lose some of our capacity\ntoo because of that parity, right?\n\n1538\n01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:41,820\n>> We do absolutely right.\n\n1539\n01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,250\nWe're not gonna be adding a lot\nof new information typically, but\n\n1540\n01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,350\nwe are gonna be able to\naccess existing information.\n\n1541\n01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:47,170\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1542\n01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:51,230\nAnd then we have RAID one plus zero,\nsometimes commonly called RAID ten,\n\n1543\n01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:54,670\nwhich is just really\nliterally combining a stripe,\n\n1544\n01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:57,450\nwhich is not going to have\nfault tolerance, no parity.\n\n1545\n01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:02,380\nRAID zero, right, with a RAID one array,\na drive mirror array.\n\n1546\n01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:05,370\nSo we stripe to the drive\nmirror in effect.\n\n1547\n01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:09,890\nAnd as a result, we achieve a fault\ntolerance solution that allows us to have,\n\n1548\n01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:14,780\nas you can see, two grade level one arrays\nthere underneath the RAID zero stripe.\n\n1549\n01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,490\nWhich means we're writing\ndata as you can see there,\n\n1550\n01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:21,105\nto a mirror on the sets of drives,\ndrive zero and one.\n\n1551\n01:15:21,105 --> 01:15:24,775\nAnd the drive two and three, both of them\nhave mirrors in place, as you can see.\n\n1552\n01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:26,725\nBut we're striping\nthe data between the two.\n\n1553\n01:15:26,725 --> 01:15:28,885\nSo we're writing it across one or\nthe other, and\n\n1554\n01:15:28,885 --> 01:15:32,415\nso the data is getting split between the\ntwo, but wherever it is, it is mirrored.\n\n1555\n01:15:32,415 --> 01:15:35,710\nSo if we did have a problem,\nwe effectively could break the mirror and\n\n1556\n01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,880\nbring the data back if there was an issue.\n\n1557\n01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,640\nSo this brings the best of\nboth worlds to performance and\n\n1558\n01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,040\nenhancement of the stripe with the mirror.\n\n1559\n01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,210\nAnd so we combine the two together.\n\n1560\n01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:46,380\nThis is RAID one plus zero or RAID ten.\n\n1561\n01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:49,260\nJust be aware of that and\nmake sure you're comfortable with that.\n\n1562\n01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:52,110\nAgain, obviously want to make sure we\nunderstand how to set these things up in\n\n1563\n01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:54,210\nthe sense of what goes into them.\n\n1564\n01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:58,130\nMinimum of two drives on the stripe\nobviously, raid zero, right?\n\n1565\n01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:01,530\nMinimum of three on the RAID five\nstripes that would parity maximum 32.\n\n1566\n01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:04,410\nNeed two drives on the raid\none on the drive mirror, so\n\n1567\n01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:07,170\nwe want to make sure we're aware of\nthose things and understand them.\n\n1568\n01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:08,490\nThat will be important as well.\n\n1569\n01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:12,690\nWe'll not spend as much time,\nby the way, on other RAID levels.\n\n1570\n01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:13,676\nI'd mentioned there were others.\n\n1571\n01:16:13,676 --> 01:16:16,010\nRAID 2, RAID 3, RAID 4, RAID 6.\n\n1572\n01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:17,050\nThey are out there.\n\n1573\n01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:19,419\nThey're important to be aware\nof if you implement them, but\n\n1574\n01:16:19,419 --> 01:16:21,980\nif you're not managing them,\ndon't spend a lot of time on them.\n\n1575\n01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,810\nJust not gonna be a lot of value.\n\n1576\n01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:26,080\nA lot of times we don't even see them,\nhonestly.\n\n1577\n01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,720\nYou mentioned an item very, very\nfortuitously just a couple minutes ago.\n\n1578\n01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,970\nYou used the term single point of failure\nwhen we talked about duplexing, right?\n\n1579\n01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:35,897\nAnd so one of the last things\nwe wanna throw out and\n\n1580\n01:16:35,897 --> 01:16:37,930\ntalk about is this idea of\nsingle point of failure.\n\n1581\n01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,180\nWhat is a single point of failure?\n\n1582\n01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,410\nWhat we call an SPOF.\n\n1583\n01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:45,520\nAnd the single point of\nfailure is simply just that.\n\n1584\n01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,240\nIt's the area of the system,\nthe weakest link.\n\n1585\n01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,310\nThat is where if anything will go wrong\nthat we don't have a backup for it,\n\n1586\n01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:54,650\nthat's typically where we're going\nto see the downside in the system.\n\n1587\n01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:58,410\nSo if it's a power supply and\nwe don't have a secondary power supply,\n\n1588\n01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:01,350\nmaybe our power supply is our weakest\nlink and our single point of failure.\n\n1589\n01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,240\nIf that is a signal hard\ndrive in the system,\n\n1590\n01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:06,760\nand the hard drive were to go bad and\nfail, then maybe it's the hard drive.\n\n1591\n01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:11,600\nSo if we can eliminate multiple single\npoints of failure by looking at them and\n\n1592\n01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,760\nthen reinforcing them with this idea of\ncreating second and maybe even third and\n\n1593\n01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,770\nfourth backups for them, then we're\ngoing to eliminate these things.\n\n1594\n01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:24,110\nAnd so, clustering can create single\npoint of failure elimination for us.\n\n1595\n01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,830\nWe can eliminate single points of failure.\n\n1596\n01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:28,720\nVirtualization is another good\ntechnology to think about here\n\n1597\n01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,320\nthat might be important to consider.\n\n1598\n01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:35,920\nKeeping inventory on hand, where we have\nextra power supplies, extra hard drives,\n\n1599\n01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,070\nthings like that, may be good ways to\nthink about this to create redundancy.\n\n1600\n01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:44,220\nTraining people so they understand how\nto deal with single points of failure\n\n1601\n01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,500\nfrom a knowledge standpoint.\n\n1602\n01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,150\nBecause remember, human inventory,\n\n1603\n01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:50,530\nhuman capital in a system is\nalso a single point of failure.\n\n1604\n01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:53,190\nHow many of your organizations\ncross train and so\n\n1605\n01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:55,500\nthat you have more than one\nexchange administrator?\n\n1606\n01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:59,365\nMore than one person that knows that\nsystem, and it's that black box knowledge,\n\n1607\n01:17:59,365 --> 01:18:02,180\nand Joe is on vacation, right,\nwhen the system goes down.\n\n1608\n01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,220\nOut in the middle of the Mediterranean,\ncruising or something,\n\n1609\n01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,120\nyou can't get ahold of him.\n\n1610\n01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,020\nRight?\n>> And you really don't think\n\n1611\n01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,490\nof your people as being a single-point\nof failure but they definitely can be.\n\n1612\n01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:09,220\n>> They absolutely are.\n\n1613\n01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:11,800\n>> Yeah.\n>> See, you really have to\n\n1614\n01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:12,440\nthink about that.\n\n1615\n01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,000\nThese are the common sense things that,\nas we said, we were thinking about.\n\n1616\n01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,630\nBut if we don't take the time to really\nunderstand how to integrate into our\n\n1617\n01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:23,310\nplanning cycle, it may actually prove to\nbe our undoing as a security professional.\n\n1618\n01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:25,010\nWe do wanna just make sure\nwe're aware of that and\n\n1619\n01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:26,330\nobviously think about that as well.\n\n1620\n01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:30,050\nSo I think with that we've probably done\na really good job of covering the most\n\n1621\n01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:32,170\nimportant points that we want to address.\n\n1622\n01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:35,990\nNot just in DRP in general in\nthis section but overall for\n\n1623\n01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:38,540\nthe entire discussion that we've\nhad through all the episodes\n\n1624\n01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:41,160\nwe've been dealing with in this\narea on risk and recovery.\n\n1625\n01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:44,380\nAnd really just understanding all those\nelements is something that hopefully\n\n1626\n01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:48,060\nyou've gotten the value out of\nduring our conversations during\n\n1627\n01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,530\nthe various episodes you've\nbeen able to look at.\n\n1628\n01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:52,170\nBut, are our time is done, as they say.\n\n1629\n01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:55,670\nWe're coming to the end of this\nconservation, and we hope you'll obviously\n\n1630\n01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:59,940\njoin us at the end of this conservation\nand transition into another one.\n\n1631\n01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,185\nBut there's a question that I want\nto throw out there real quick,\n\n1632\n01:19:02,185 --> 01:19:04,020\ncuz Jason threw something in there for us.\n\n1633\n01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,000\nSo Jason if you don't mind,\nwe're going to take a second and\n\n1634\n01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,690\nanswer your question in real time.\n\n1635\n01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:10,900\nSo you're asking what's you're opinion,\nwhat's my opinion, or our opinion,\n\n1636\n01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:14,150\nI will say, on the performance of software\nrate versus hardware rate setups.\n\n1637\n01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,950\nAnd Jason, you know,\nthat's a great question.\n\n1638\n01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:19,430\nBecause there is value to both.\n\n1639\n01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:21,020\nPerformance is one of the key indicators.\n\n1640\n01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:22,240\nWe wanna think about that.\n\n1641\n01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,270\nIt is contagious, isn't it?\n\n1642\n01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:24,220\nIt's like yawning right?\n\n1643\n01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,130\n>> Huh.\n>> So, it is important to think\n\n1644\n01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,380\nabout that, and\nwe wanna think about performance.\n\n1645\n01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:29,830\nDefinitely one of the key criteria.\n\n1646\n01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:33,620\nBut, I'll broaden the question out,\nnot just to address performance, but\n\n1647\n01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:37,410\nI think the bigger way to address this\nquestion from a context perspective is\n\n1648\n01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:40,770\nwhat is the opinion based on the business\nneed and the business requirement?\n\n1649\n01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:43,020\nRight?\nBecause if performance is the only key\n\n1650\n01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:46,620\nindicator, then absolutely wanna be\nthinking about hardware based RAID.\n\n1651\n01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:50,400\nBecause hardware's always gonna be faster,\nit's always gonna be able to do more\n\n1652\n01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,260\nquicker for you because it operates on\na underlying level underneath the OS.\n\n1653\n01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:58,290\nTypically has offload acceleration,\ndedicated processors, things like that.\n\n1654\n01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,600\nAnd as a result,\nit's always gonna perform better.\n\n1655\n01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,370\nWell, almost always.\n\n1656\n01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:02,400\nPut an asterisk next to that.\n\n1657\n01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,930\nThere are some exceptions if you implement\nit poorly, right, you screw it up,\n\n1658\n01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:06,770\npatch your firmware.\n\n1659\n01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,580\nIt may not work.\n\n1660\n01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,922\nBut in general, right, if everything\nis done the way it should be,\n\n1661\n01:20:09,922 --> 01:20:14,630\nimplemented properly, it's always going\nto out perform software based solutions.\n\n1662\n01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:19,500\nBut having said that, if the business\nrequirement and the criteria is not\n\n1663\n01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:24,195\njust performance, but is also perhaps\ndriven by economics, because hardware base\n\n1664\n01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:27,370\nRAID is going to be more expensive,\nso you have to think about that.\n\n1665\n01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:31,630\nIf it's driven by the need to have\nelimination of a single point of failure,\n\n1666\n01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:34,720\nthen hardware based RAID may be\nthe better choice because you\n\n1667\n01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,720\ncan create redundancy by adding multiple\nimplementations of that hardware.\n\n1668\n01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,880\nIt's very hard to create software\nbased redundancy for RAID because it's\n\n1669\n01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:45,750\nan OS function and you can't create\nredundancy in the OS the same way.\n\n1670\n01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:48,528\nSo business objectives, Jason I would\njust through that back to you and\n\n1671\n01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:51,460\nthink about that, or ask you to\nthink about that is also important.\n\n1672\n01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:55,190\nBut specifically to the heart of your\nquestion, from just a sheer performance\n\n1673\n01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:58,050\nstandpoint, definitely hardware based\nRAID I think would perform better.\n\n1674\n01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:00,660\nMike I don't know if you have any other\nthoughts you wanna add about that, but.\n\n1675\n01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,920\n>> No, I would chime in right with you.\n\n1676\n01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,900\nI think you hit it perfectly.\n\n1677\n01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:03,760\n>> Okay, all right, so very good.\n\n1678\n01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,460\nSo Jason, we appreciate the opportunity\nto interact and have a question there for\n\n1679\n01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:09,030\nyou, or from you rather in real time.\n\n1680\n01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,440\nSo thank you very much.\n\n1681\n01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,370\n>> Absolutely.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1682\n01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:13,190\nAnd I guess that does it for our episode.\n\n1683\n01:21:13,190 -->

00:00:36,360\nI'm Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n4\n00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,540\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n5\n00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,790\n>> Good, good.\nHowdy everybody, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,830\n>> Here today we are gonna dive\ninto the world of cryptography.\n\n7\n00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,320\nSo let's sit back, relax and\nsee what we've got.\n\n8\n00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,600\n>> Sit back and relax.\n\n9\n00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,220\nThat just doesn't go well with\ncryptography for some reason.\n\n10\n00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,320\nIt's like opposite ends of\nthe spectrum on those statements.\n\n11\n00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,630\nRight?\nSo, I wanna talk about cryptography.\n\n12\n00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,030\nIt is an exciting topic, and\n\n13\n00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,500\nobviously one that I think\n[LAUGH] at the end of the day.\n\n14\n00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,970\nSteganagrasaurus?\n\n15\n00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:03,940\nOh wow, that's great.\n\n16\n00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,550\nSo, you know, we have this\ntradition here as you could see,\n\n17\n00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,340\nwhere we choose those bottom little\nheaders on the bottom of our names.\n\n18\n00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,770\nAnd then, that one was chosen for me.\n\n19\n00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,110\nI didn't have any input\non that particular one.\n\n20\n00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,550\nSo it is obfuscated, we'll probably\ntranslate that and run it through\n\n21\n00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,700\nthe cryptographic system we'll define here\nin a few minutes, it may turn out to be\n\n22\n00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,000\nsomething like heavy espresso drinker or\nsomething like that, we'll see.\n\n23\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,280\nBut the idea here is that we're gonna\nstart talking about cryptography.\n\n24\n00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,110\nYou know, one of the really important\nthings that the SSCP candidate needs to be\n\n25\n00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,980\nable to understand how to do,\nany good security professional needs to be\n\n26\n00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,280\nable to understand how to do,\nit's not just the SSCP.\n\n27\n00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,037\nA candidate or the practitioner is to\nunderstand the conceptual ideas behind\n\n28\n00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:44,730\ninformation security.\n\n29\n00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,470\nAnd one of those areas that we're drilling\ninto of the many that we've been talking\n\n30\n00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,390\nabout in prior episodes and we will\ntalk about in some upcoming episodes,\n\n31\n00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,680\nis this idea of information security\nfrom a cryptography perspective.\n\n32\n00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,540\nAnd we always start out our\nconversations in these areas\n\n33\n00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,510\nby talking about the three pillars.\n\n34\n00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,639\nRight, the three areas or the triad,\nthe iron triangle, the AIC triad,\n\n35\n00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:06,330\nwe call it many things.\n\n36\n00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,170\nBut the three pillars are really\nunder pin information security.\n\n37\n00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,350\nWhen we talk about confidentiality,\n\n38\n00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,980\nwe talk about integrity,\nwe talk about availability.\n\n39\n00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,440\nAnd in this area we're gonna\nadd not a third or, excuse me,\n\n40\n00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,880\nnot a fourth pillar but another\nitem that's gonna fall under those,\n\n41\n00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,900\nwhich will be authentication and\nauthenticity of data.\n\n42\n00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,134\nWe'll talk about that and that'll\nhappen later when we talk about digital\n\n43\n00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:32,765\nsignatures and hashing and\nall those things.\n\n44\n00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:36,510\nSome of those are integrity items, others\nwill be dealing with authentication.\n\n45\n00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,394\nBut we're gonna start our discussions in\nthe cryptography area really focusing\n\n46\n00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:46,134\non the confidentiality concept and\nthis idea of keeping information secret,\n\n47\n00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:50,870\nkeeping it secure, keeping it away from\nprying eyes, and figuring out ways to\n\n48\n00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,529\nsafeguard that information so\nthat if we allow you to see it,\n\n49\n00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:58,860\nit's because we've granted you access,\ngiven you permission.\n\n50\n00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,845\nAnd if we don't want you to see it, you're\nnot authorized, as you were just saying,\n\n51\n00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:03,900\nand that's gonna be very, very important.\n\n52\n00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,870\nSo we're gonna talk about some\nvocabulary here to get started.\n\n53\n00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,210\nThis is one of those areas where,\nas you can see,\n\n54\n00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,030\nwe've done our homework ahead of time.\n\n55\n00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,360\nMike's been very busy\nlearning how to type.\n\n56\n00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,870\nAnd so now that he's got it down,\nwe've put those skills to use and\n\n57\n00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,098\nwe're gonna detail through\na vocabulary list here.\n\n58\n00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:23,270\nBecause it's gonna be critical for you to\nhave knowledge of these vocabulary terms\n\n59\n00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,730\nboth as you get ready to answer\nsome questions, but also\n\n60\n00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,650\njust number one to be able to talk about\ncryptography in a professional sense.\n\n61\n00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,300\nYou want to speak about\nthe building blocks and\n\n62\n00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,762\nthe parts of the systems that are in play.\n\n63\n00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:39,000\nYou wanna be able to understand as you\nread about these systems what the building\n\n64\n00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440\nblocks and the parts are.\n\n65\n00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,560\nHow to manipulate them,\nhow to work with them.\n\n66\n00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,450\nAnd you're gonna definitely\nneed to know this material\n\n67\n00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,560\nin order to be successful at\nmastering this knowledge area.\n\n68\n00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,260\nSo we're gonna break with tradition\na little bit here in the sense of\n\n69\n00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,140\nreally just walking\nthrough a large list here.\n\n70\n00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,060\nWe've got about 14 items or\n\n71\n00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,060\n13 items on that list that we\njust wanna have defined for you.\n\n72\n00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,490\nWe're gonna make them available to\nyou through the notes after the fact.\n\n73\n00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,248\nAnd we may actually wanna do\na quick word wrap on that also.\n\n74\n00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:09,100\nI'm just looking, some of them\nare trailing off towards the side there.\n\n75\n00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,430\nSo we'll go through and translate,\nor rather do the definitions here.\n\n76\n00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,470\nBut we're also gonna just do a word wrap\nto make sure that we have everything\n\n77\n00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,650\norganized.\n\n78\n00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,960\nAnd, as a result, we can just\nsee all of the definitions, and\n\n79\n00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,790\nMike's just making that adjustment for\nus in real time here real quickly.\n\n80\n00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,416\nSo let's go through our vocabulary\nlist just to make sure we\n\n81\n00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,634\nknow what these terms are.\n\n82\n00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,391\nStarting at the top with cryptography,\n\n83\n00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:36,190\nthis idea of transferring information\nfrom a clear form, an unencrypted form.\n\n84\n00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,480\nYou'll see plaintext right below\nit is considered human readable.\n\n85\n00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,020\nSo taking plaintext and\nwalking it through into an enciphered form\n\n86\n00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,820\nright below that which is\nwhat we call ciphertext.\n\n87\n00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,160\nAnd so this idea of doing that as\na thought process is this idea of\n\n88\n00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,250\ncryptography, and so making sure\nthat we transfer this information\n\n89\n00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,860\ninto a form that cannot be used by\npeople that are not authorized is\n\n90\n00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,058\nthe general definition of what a\ncryptography solution does, I should say.\n\n91\n00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:10,730\nNot a cryptographic systems or define a\ncryptosystem down below is being something\n\n92\n00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,955\na little different, but cryptography\noverall is what we're talking about here.\n\n93\n00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:19,020\nPlaintext, as I just mentioned,\nthis idea of human readable.\n\n94\n00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,510\nHuman readable is really just normal,\naverage, everyday text that we'd look at.\n\n95\n00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,256\nInformation, by the way,\nin a variety of forms,\n\n96\n00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:28,060\nright, it doesn't necessarily have to\njust be a couple of letters on a page.\n\n97\n00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,000\nIt could be entire documents.\n\n98\n00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,310\nIt could be whole files,\ndatabases, websites.\n\n99\n00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,250\nIt could be a variety of things\nwere we get this data from.\n\n100\n00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,580\nThe idea is that whatever it\nis is considered plaintext\n\n101\n00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,310\nwhen we are not applying encryption to it.\n\n102\n00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,481\nWhen we apply encryption to it,\nit will be ciphertext.\n\n103\n00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:49,955\nCiphertext is the result of taking that\nplaintext, applying encryption to it,\n\n104\n00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:52,533\ntypically through the use\nof a cryptosystem.\n\n105\n00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:56,361\nWe'll get down to that\ndefinition in a few minutes, and\n\n106\n00:05:56,361 --> 00:06:00,841\nthen as a result of that enciphering\nprocess that we speak about,\n\n107\n00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:06,394\nwe transfer that plaintext into enciphered\ntext, which is called ciphertext.\n\n108\n00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:08,772\nWe apply encryption to it,\nin other words, and\n\n109\n00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:11,780\nthis is gonna be a very important\nprocess that we engage in.\n\n110\n00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,530\nEncryption itself is the idea of\nconverting plaintext to ciphertext,\n\n111\n00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,040\nas we just talked about.\n\n112\n00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,060\nDecrypting is this idea, or decryption,\nif we wanna just be formal and\n\n113\n00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,020\nclean up after ourselves, is gonna be the\nidea of processing, converting, in other\n\n114\n00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,220\nwords if you will, ciphertext back to\nplaintext, right, going back and forth.\n\n115\n00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,040\nAn algorithm is gonna be\n\n116\n00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,090\ngenerically defined here as the rules\nused to encipher and decipher.\n\n117\n00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,690\nWe can just broaden that slightly and\n\n118\n00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,920\njust say that's really the mathematical\nformulas, the mathematical\n\n119\n00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,980\nsolutions that are applied,\nalgorithms are mathematical constructs.\n\n120\n00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,600\nAnd so the algorithm is the mathematical\nconstruct that is applied, but\n\n121\n00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,500\nit is the rules that are used to do the\nenciphering and deciphering of the data.\n\n122\n00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,460\nWe see algorithms being used inside\ncryptosystems to then be able to form\n\n123\n00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,288\nthis whole solution that we can actually\nuse to take plaintext in the front end,\n\n124\n00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:08,050\nrun it through a crypto system\nby applying algorithms, and\n\n125\n00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,140\nthen out the back end,\nspit out ciphertext.\n\n126\n00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,560\nAnd if we were to run that in reverse,\ngo through the other way,\n\n127\n00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,250\nturn the machine around if you will, and\nspit back out plaintext on the other side.\n\n128\n00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,750\nThat's where the algorithm and\n\n129\n00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,310\nthe encryption/decryption process come\ntogether inside the cryptosystem, and\n\n130\n00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,440\nwe'll see that definition down towards\nthe bottom here in just a moment.\n\n131\n00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,700\nCryptanalysis, this practice\nof defeating confidentiality.\n\n132\n00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,410\nCryptanalysis is the art and\nscience of analyzing encrypted data, and\n\n133\n00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,800\nthen doing so\nusually without the knowledge of the key,\n\n134\n00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,840\nthe information needed to\nunencrypt the data directly.\n\n135\n00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,935\nAnd trying to figure out how to break or\ncrack, a term you'll often hear,\n\n136\n00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,980\nbreak or crack the encryption.\n\n137\n00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,972\nIt's this art and\nscience of cryptanalysis, and so\n\n138\n00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,899\nthis is what code breakers will do,\ngenerically.\n\n139\n00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:58,404\nCode breakers are cryptanalysts and\nthey are going in and trying to figure out\n\n140\n00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:03,059\nhow to unencrypt data, usually without\nthe benefit of having the key up front.\n\n141\n00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:07,481\nCryptovariable, which is often referred\nto simply as the key that we were just\n\n142\n00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,650\ndiscussing.\n\n143\n00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,790\nSo the cryptovariable, or the key,\nis the secret, you can see there,\n\n144\n00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,050\nsequence that governs the enciphering and\ndeciphering of the data.\n\n145\n00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,940\nSo this is the magical wand that\nreally helps us to take data,\n\n146\n00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,750\ntransform it from plain text into\ncipher text, and back again.\n\n147\n00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,430\nWhen we lose the key,\n\n148\n00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,750\nliterally we potentially lose\nthe opportunity to recover that data.\n\n149\n00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,010\nAnd if we don't have a copy of the key,\nand\n\n150\n00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,520\nwe don't have a good crypto system\nthat allows us to do key archiving and\n\n151\n00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,590\nkey escrowing to understand\nhow to safeguard the key.\n\n152\n00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,500\nWe may actually run into a problem\nwhere we lose the key, and\n\n153\n00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,390\nlose the ability to unencrypt the data.\n\n154\n00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,930\nSo this can be a definite issue.\n\n155\n00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,320\nWe see this sometimes in Windows, for\ninstance, where we use things like EFS,\n\n156\n00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,540\nthe encrypting file system,\nBitLocker, or AppLocker.\n\n157\n00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,580\nWhere we use in Windows 7, Windows 8, and\n\n158\n00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,299\nVista, that incredible\noperating system that it was.\n\n159\n00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:00,125\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I shouldn't make fun of this,\n\n160\n00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,225\neven though I am going to.\n\n161\n00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:04,215\nBut I shouldn't because I was one of\nthe few human beings on the planet\n\n162\n00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:07,115\nthat actually ran Vista as\na production level operating system.\n\n163\n00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,525\n>> Nice, nice.\n>> And actually thought it was a good one.\n\n164\n00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:09,925\nSo it actually wasn't that bad.\n\n165\n00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,680\n>> It was.\n\n166\n00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,237\n>> But you're saying it was that bad,\nor it wasn't?\n\n167\n00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:13,173\n>> It wasn't that bad.\nI mean, it was [CROSSTALK].\n\n168\n00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:14,591\n>> Okay.\nJust wanna make sure,\n\n169\n00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:18,142\ncuz that would be the whole Windows\n98 millennium conversation, right?\n\n170\n00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,747\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How bad was it truly, right?\n\n171\n00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:23,573\nJust another gaming platform without\ndeveloping anything, so but, no.\n\n172\n00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:26,205\nSomething with Vista,\nwe started to see the advent of,\n\n173\n00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:29,458\nand actually goes back much\nfurther than Windows 2000.\n\n174\n00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we started CUAC certainly, but\n\n175\n00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,854\nwe did see the advent of BitLocker\nstarting to make its approach there\n\n176\n00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:35,725\nin Vista.\n\n177\n00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:38,710\nApplocker really became an option\nin Windows 7 into Windows 8.\n\n178\n00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,370\nWith group policy management, now Windows\n8.1 and even 8.1 update one and beyond.\n\n179\n00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,890\nBut the idea there is that we can do\nencryption at the drive level, or\n\n180\n00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,710\nin the operating system\nat the file system level.\n\n181\n00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,380\nAnd we can use encryption keys,\ncrypto variables that the operating\n\n182\n00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,650\ntypically will define for\nus to apply that encryption.\n\n183\n00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,630\nAt least in the Windows\nspace we do anyway.\n\n184\n00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,500\nLinux it's done slightly differently.\n\n185\n00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,900\nWe don't have the same technology names,\nalthough it's at the end of the day still\n\n186\n00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,810\na key that's being applied to encrypt and\ndecrypt data.\n\n187\n00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,560\nSo for instance,\nwe use in the FC password directory.\n\n188\n00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,440\nWe use the shadow password\nfile to encrypt the passwords,\n\n189\n00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,060\nto effectively get the same\nsecurity level that we have.\n\n190\n00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,350\nAlthough, it is actually better\nsecurity in theory than the Windows\n\n191\n00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,500\nsecurity hive around the passwords there,\nright?\n\n192\n00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,610\nSo we see the same concepts being applied\nin Windows and in Linux in one form or\n\n193\n00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,900\nanother, but the cryptovariable,\nthe key is definitely going to be\n\n194\n00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,720\none of the most important elements\nwe have in our cryptive system.\n\n195\n00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,500\nBecause without it,\n\n196\n00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,070\nif we don't link the key in some way\nto the encryption-decryption cycle,\n\n197\n00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,910\nwe lose the ability to validate and\nultimately use the data.\n\n198\n00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,785\nThe key space,\n\n199\n00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:45,575\nthe number as it says there of distinct\nkeys that is supported by a cipher.\n\n200\n00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:48,515\nSo this will be the overall amount\nof keys that are available to us.\n\n201\n00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:53,385\nThe overall working number\nof keys inside of the crypto\n\n202\n00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:54,685\nsolution that we are looking at.\n\n203\n00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:55,225\nThe cipher,\n\n204\n00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:59,055\nthe algorithms that are being used\nwill support a certain amount of keys.\n\n205\n00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:00,465\nThe bigger the key space,\n\n206\n00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:03,715\nas a rule of thumb,\nthe harder it is to crack the encryption.\n\n207\n00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:07,840\nBecause the more key potential\ncombinations we have out there,\n\n208\n00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,420\nor the potentiality of finding that key,\n\n209\n00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,070\ngrows exponentially ever upward as the key\nsystem or the key space itself expands.\n\n210\n00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,540\nMeaning the likelihood of finding\nthat key becomes much smaller,\n\n211\n00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,000\nit's an inverse ratio.\n\n212\n00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,300\nThe bigger the key space, the less likely\nit is we'll trip across that key easily.\n\n213\n00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,190\nThe smaller this key space, the more\nlikely it is that we will find it.\n\n214\n00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,320\nAnd so with today's modern computing\ntechnology, the idea of being able to run\n\n215\n00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,510\nthings like password cracking programs or\nencryption cracking programs\n\n216\n00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,990\nagainst encrypted data is a function\nof computing power over time.\n\n217\n00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,620\nWe will say an algorithm is considered\nto be unbreakable in today's world\n\n218\n00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,490\nif it can survive an attack against it for\nbasically,\n\n219\n00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,190\nthe normal lifetime of a human being.\n\n220\n00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,450\nRight?\nSo if an algorithm will survive based on\n\n221\n00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,870\nthe key space it brings to the table and\nattack against encryption for\n\n222\n00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,340\nout over 100 years.\n\n223\n00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,980\nWe consider that to be an unbreakable\nsolution because by today's standards,\n\n224\n00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,870\nyou're not gonna be able\nto break it right now.\n\n225\n00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,900\nHaving said that, 24 months from now,\nwe may have cut that timeline in half,\n\n226\n00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,180\nor by two-thirds.\n\n227\n00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,640\nAnd so,\nit's not considered truly unbreakable, but\n\n228\n00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,730\nrather unbreakable at this moment in time.\n\n229\n00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,340\nSo we really have to think about that and\nunderstand what that key space means.\n\n230\n00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,570\nWe're starting to see ridiculous\nkey spaces being created.\n\n231\n00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,170\n>> Right.\n\n232\n00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,530\n>> You know, 2048 bit long keys,\n4096 bit keys.\n\n233\n00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,410\n>> 4096, yeah.\n>> Million year key space\n\n234\n00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,650\nkind of thing now, But\nin 10, 20, 30 years,\n\n235\n00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,080\nthat million year key space may literally\ncome down to less than a hundred years.\n\n236\n00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,580\n>> Absolutely.\n\n237\n00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,580\n>> Based on just chipping away at our\nability to process and to do grid and\n\n238\n00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,725\nparallel process, right?\n\n239\n00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:45,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Across the divide there.\n\n240\n00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640\nKey clustering,\nthe idea that there are two or\n\n241\n00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,480\nmore keys that will successfully\ndecrypt the message.\n\n242\n00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,950\nWhen we have a key cluster,\nit's a bad thing.\n\n243\n00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,130\nWe don't want to see key\nclustering happening.\n\n244\n00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,480\nThis means that if we do,\n\n245\n00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,180\nwe are most likely going to be\nable to decrypt that message.\n\n246\n00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,080\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz we're going to\n\n247\n00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,180\nfind that key, right?\n\n248\n00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,750\n>> That's going to be able to decrypt it.\n\n249\n00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,400\nWe'll talk later on as we get into some of\nthe other episodes on this topic around\n\n250\n00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,790\nbit ciphers, stream ciphers.\n\n251\n00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:16,500\nWe'll talk about asymmetric algorithms,\nsymmetric solutions.\n\n252\n00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,680\nRight.\nWhether we have a public and\n\n253\n00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,370\na private key, or just a private key.\n\n254\n00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,200\nAnd so\nunderstanding how key clustering works\n\n255\n00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,780\nis really a function of several variables\nbecause of the type of algorithm we use.\n\n256\n00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,700\nWhether it's a public key and a private\nkey combination, or just a private key\n\n257\n00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,120\nis not so important because we're\nstill going after the private key.\n\n258\n00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,260\n>> Right.\n>> Public key's known anyway,\n\n259\n00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,310\nso whether it's asymmetric or\nsymmetric doesn't really matter.\n\n260\n00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,430\nBut the nature of the algorithm\nthat we choose and\n\n261\n00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,050\nhow big the key space is,\ndoes directly impact key clustering.\n\n262\n00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,230\nBigger the key space,\nless likely we'll get a key cluster.\n\n263\n00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,120\nCollisions, two or more message\nthat produce the same hash value\n\n264\n00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,720\nare considered to present a collision.\n\n265\n00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,330\nA hash value is something we\nalso will talk about later,\n\n266\n00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,240\nwhere we get into digital symmetries,\nand we get into integrity.\n\n267\n00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,290\nHashing is this idea of taking a variable\namount of data plus a known algorithm, and\n\n268\n00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,070\ncreating a fixed output in bit size\nthat will allow us to identify and\n\n269\n00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,550\ntag that data to create integrity and\nauthenticity.\n\n270\n00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,952\nWe'll talk more about that concept later.\n\n271\n00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:19,646\nBut the idea of a collision here is also\nvery important, because this is another\n\n272\n00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:24,004\nway that we potentially can look to\nfind out information about a message.\n\n273\n00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:28,305\nJust like a key cluster can present\nchallenges for us, a collision can also\n\n274\n00:14:28,305 --> 00:14:33,020\npresent challenges in the encryption and\ndecryption of information.\n\n275\n00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,555\nA cryptosystem is the algorithm you need\nto implement a certain kind of encryption\n\n276\n00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:38,486\nor decryption.\n\n277\n00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:43,010\nIt is the box, if we think about a logical\ndiagram that we put the algorithms into.\n\n278\n00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:48,369\nOn one side, we have the inputs which\nare going to be the plain text coming in,\n\n279\n00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,685\nruns through the crypto system.\n\n280\n00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:53,524\nWhich is the black box where\nthe algorithms live and\n\n281\n00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:56,769\nthe process of deciphering and\nenciphering takes place.\n\n282\n00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:00,987\nOut the back end, we will spit out,\nif we are inputting plain text,\n\n283\n00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,500\nspit out cipher text.\n\n284\n00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,290\n>> Right.\n>> If we are starting with cipher text,\n\n285\n00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,050\nrunning it through the crypto system going\nthe other way, we'll do our magic inside,\n\n286\n00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,780\ndecrypt, spit out plain\ntext on the back end.\n\n287\n00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,680\nThis is what the crypto system is.\n\n288\n00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,880\nWe have steganography.\n\n289\n00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,480\nSteganography is this idea of being\nable to go in and to hide things.\n\n290\n00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,010\nWe said the art of hiding things because\nultimately we talk about the fact that\n\n291\n00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,070\nsteganography is something we can\nengage in as an art and a science.\n\n292\n00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,150\n>> Right.\n>> We can go ahead and\n\n293\n00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,210\nbasically prevent people\nfrom seeing things by\n\n294\n00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,677\nliterally in some cases\nhiding things in plain sight.\n\n295\n00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:36,301\n>> As you say because it doesn't\nreally encrypt it, right?\n\n296\n00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,150\n>> It doesn't.\n>> You're just taking advantage that\n\n297\n00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,011\nthey don't even know it's there.\n\n298\n00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:41,352\n>> Right, so\nwe're using things like white space.\n\n299\n00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:46,320\nWe define this idea of being able to use\nspace on a hard drive that is in between\n\n300\n00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,330\nthe other things that's there.\n\n301\n00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,960\nIt's white space, unused space.\n\n302\n00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,880\nWe can hide bits of data there.\n\n303\n00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,100\nWe may be able to hide\nit inside of a picture.\n\n304\n00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,248\n>> Leave significant bits,\nsomething like that.\n\n305\n00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:55,305\n>> Leave significant bits.\n\n306\n00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:57,952\nWe may be able to hide it\ninside of an audio file.\n\n307\n00:15:57,952 --> 00:15:59,124\n>> MP3 [INAUDIBLE]\n>> In white noise.\n\n308\n00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,228\nMP3 Stego.\n\n309\n00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:04,309\nIs a program we use in hacking solutions\nand in our forensic tool kits,\n\n310\n00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:06,340\nto be able to find these things.\n\n311\n00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,152\nAnd so, yes.\n\n312\n00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:09,800\nDefinitely LSBs, least significant bits,\n\n313\n00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,850\nis gonna be what steganography is going to\nuse and how we will then roll backwards,\n\n314\n00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,875\nif you will, to try and un-stega,\nwhich is what we call it.\n\n315\n00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:21,620\nUn-stega-ling the steganagraphic data\n\n316\n00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,960\nis the idea of taking the data\nout of it's steganography form.\n\n317\n00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,470\nAnd then representing it in effect as\nfull data that we can then look at.\n\n318\n00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,100\nAnd there's an art and a science to this.\n\n319\n00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,590\nThere are tools that let you do this.\n\n320\n00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,370\nIt's very interesting conceptually and\n\n321\n00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,730\nit's also very interesting when you\nactually go in and try to do this.\n\n322\n00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,630\nSo these are some of the terms,\n\n323\n00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,580\nvocabulary terms that we want\nyou to be familiar with.\n\n324\n00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,770\nI would suggest, and\nMike you may have a suggestion for\n\n325\n00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,060\nour listeners as well,\nI know I've found it to be very helpful\n\n326\n00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,110\nwhen I do vocabulary lists like\nthis to create flashcards.\n\n327\n00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,660\n>> And that's the old fallback.\n\n328\n00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,420\nAnytime I've gotta memorize something,\nI think that's the way to go.\n\n329\n00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,317\n>> Right.\nSo yeah, old-school terminology,\n\n330\n00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:04,130\nold-school trick, but at the end of the\nday old school is new school today, right?\n\n331\n00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,520\nIt's still cool to be\ndoing this kind of stuff.\n\n332\n00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,600\n>> They can bring it\ninto the modern world.\n\n333\n00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600\nYou can do it now online, right?\n\n334\n00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,830\nYou can go get some digital flash drives.\n\n335\n00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,420\n>> You can, absolutely.\n\n336\n00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,750\n>> You can put them up on your phones and\ntablets.\n\n337\n00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,630\n>> Yeah, it's not the same though.\n\n338\n00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,886\nI'm just that old.\n>> I like to have it in my hand.\n\n339\n00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:17,071\n>> Four by six,\nfive by seven paper person, that's me.\n\n340\n00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:19,987\nBut I find whether its typing,\nand I'm one of those people, and\n\n341\n00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:22,530\nI know Mike is as well,\nwe were just talking about this.\n\n342\n00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,132\nWith typing,\nI'm a little challenged with typing.\n\n343\n00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:26,738\nI'm a hunt a peck kinda guy.\n\n344\n00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:29,993\nThe one mistake I make [LAUGH]\nprofessionally in my career early on when\n\n345\n00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:33,878\nI had the opportunity to learn how to type\nwhen I was in high school, I never did it.\n\n346\n00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:37,057\nI thought what the hell am I\ngonna use typing for, right,\n\n347\n00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,580\nwhat do I possibly need it for,\nand I never too advantage of it.\n\n348\n00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,293\nWe were talking about that before\nright before we got online here for\n\n349\n00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:46,540\nthis episode that the one thing you really\nneed to is learn how to do is how to type.\n\n350\n00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,583\nAnd so I struggle to this day with\nthe fact that I never learned how to type\n\n351\n00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,106\nformally.\n\n352\n00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:55,565\nAnd so I write books this is not like I\nneed to use this because I dabble in it,\n\n353\n00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:59,030\nI write books and\nI gotta type for a living.\n\n354\n00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,980\n>> And\nhere I am typing live on the internet.\n\n355\n00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,921\n>> And you're typing, and yeah.\n\n356\n00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,126\n[LAUGH] And\nnotice I made Mike type, right?\n\n357\n00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:07,863\nI'm not typing because mama didn't raise\nno fools, so I know better, right?\n\n358\n00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:09,970\n[LAUGH] So you know it's very important,\n\n359\n00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,970\nbut the idea here is that when we\ndo these kinds of things, right?\n\n360\n00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,540\nAnd we look at stegonography,\nwe look at all of this stuff.\n\n361\n00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,680\nIt is important to understand that you\nwant to be able to have these definitions.\n\n362\n00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,880\nUnderstand what they are.\n\n363\n00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,950\nI learn by doing.\n\n364\n00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,480\nI write it down, it sticks in my head\na lot better when I'm preparing to take\n\n365\n00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,860\nan exam than if I just see it on a page,\nI read it a couple times.\n\n366\n00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,510\nI'm one one of those photographic\nmemory people, right.\n\n367\n00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,190\nI hate those people by the way.\n\n368\n00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,922\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Sometimes just the act of writing it\n\n369\n00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:36,690\nout on a card.\n\n370\n00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,950\nYeah I know,\nthey look at it once they remember.\n\n371\n00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,810\nI am not that way.\n\n372\n00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,130\nI'm just not wired that way.\n\n373\n00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,310\n>> Sometimes just writing it down on\nthe cards, I don't even go back and\n\n374\n00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,030\nlook at them again.\n\n375\n00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,959\nYou've memorized it, [CROSSTALK]\n>> You got it.\n\n376\n00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,783\nAbsolutely.\n\n377\n00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:51,487\nAnd I was cleaning up a while back,\nand I found in one of my offices,\n\n378\n00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:56,815\nwhen I still had offices, cuz I'm now\nhomeless, I don't have an office.\n\n379\n00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:58,799\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But when I did have an office before I\n\n380\n00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,920\nwas booted out of\nthe last one I inhabited.\n\n381\n00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,551\nAnd told oh no,\njust kind of put your stuff over there,\n\n382\n00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,401\nyou're not really here that much,\nwhy do you need an office?\n\n383\n00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:07,270\nWe gotta use it so\nwe're gonna give it to somebody else.\n\n384\n00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,495\nBut when I was doing that I cleaned out a\nbunch of stuff and I found an old box with\n\n385\n00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:17,822\na bunch of my index cards from one of\nthe very first certifications [INAUDIBLE].\n\n386\n00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:22,900\nI did my NT35 and 351,\nMCSZ when I was starting out.\n\n387\n00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,780\nAnd I had my flash Cards.\n\n388\n00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,552\nAnd I had literally, I had two shoeboxes\nfull of flashcards from all the stuff\n\n389\n00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:32,110\nI'd written down and\nthen setup and did on my DOS.\n\n390\n00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,640\nYou had to do a DOS certification on\nWindows 95 and Windows 3.1 and 3.11.\n\n391\n00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,640\nAll that stuff, I had done all those\nexams, those MCP exams early on.\n\n392\n00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,590\nAnd-\n>> Did you save them?\n\n393\n00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,100\n>> I still have them,\nas a matter of fact, I do.\n\n394\n00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,945\nYeah.\nThey make great coasters at parties.\n\n395\n00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're awesome for\n\n396\n00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,070\nlike greeting cards and\ngift cards for the holidays.\n\n397\n00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,210\n>> Some kind of computer based trivial\npursuit game could be made out of it.\n\n398\n00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,450\n>> Yeah.\nIt could be something like that.\n\n399\n00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,845\nHere's 5000 cards, right, sort them.\n\n400\n00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:57,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean listen,\n\n401\n00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,150\nwhen I went to college, I still did.\n\n402\n00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,650\nWhen I did statistics for my graduate\nstudies, I had to do it with punch cards.\n\n403\n00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,750\nSo that's how far back in the day I was.\n\n404\n00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,260\nI did my VAX programming and\nmy statistical package,\n\n405\n00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,235\nmy analysis package class,\nI did that on punch cards.\n\n406\n00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:13,291\n>> Wow.\n>> Actually do my stuff and\n\n407\n00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,165\ncreate punch cards.\n\n408\n00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:16,595\nSo that's how old I am guys,\njust so you know.\n\n409\n00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:21,460\nA lot of our listeners out there are going\npunch cards, what the hell is that, right?\n\n410\n00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,367\nSo when we talk about, by the way, great\nway to Cryptographicaly hide your data,\n\n411\n00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,667\nput it on punch cards today.\n\n412\n00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,517\nNobody reads that right?\n\n413\n00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,826\nSo the idea was originally cryptographic\nsolutions were used for secrecy, right?\n\n414\n00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:35,117\nAnd we joke around about\nsome of this stuff.\n\n415\n00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,827\nWe talk about things like Caesar ciphers,\nand\n\n416\n00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:40,518\nall these these original old\nciphers that were around.\n\n417\n00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:44,798\nThe Vigenère cipher, Alphabetic\nSubstitution, things of that nature.\n\n418\n00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:45,560\n>> Right.\n>> These were all\n\n419\n00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,098\njust ways of achieving this.\n\n420\n00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:49,718\nBut the idea was that basically we\nwere looking to hide information.\n\n421\n00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:51,338\n>> Right.\n>> And so if A equalled Three and\n\n422\n00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:55,593\nB equalled five or whatever, and\nwe could substitute letters into numbers,\n\n423\n00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:58,864\nyou could begin to send a message\nwithout spelling it out and\n\n424\n00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:00,978\nfiguring out what it might have been.\n\n425\n00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:04,874\nSo this was the kind of thing we did and\nthis is what originally cryptography was\n\n426\n00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:08,591\nall about, and it is still today by\nthe way, its just that we've got better\n\n427\n00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:12,621\ntechnology and as a result we have more\nstronger systems that can do more things.\n\n428\n00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:13,730\nBut at the end of day,\nit's really nothing more than that.\n\n429\n00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,870\nIt's about hiding data,\nkeeping it out of the hands and\n\n430\n00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,530\nthe eyes of the individuals that are not\ndesigned, or not supposed to see it.\n\n431\n00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,365\nWhoever that is for\nwhatever reason that may be.\n\n432\n00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:29,100\nSo we talk about things like security\nprotocols, we will mention some of these\n\n433\n00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,160\nin some of the upcoming coming episodes in\nthis particular segment on cryptography.\n\n434\n00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,220\nBut things like SSH, an oldy but\na goody, Secure Shell, SSL,\n\n435\n00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,020\nand TLS, Transport Layer Security and\nsecure sockets, SHTTP,\n\n436\n00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,535\nsecure HTTP, as well as HTTPS,\nwe do have both.\n\n437\n00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:52,750\nPeople often forget about SHTTP and\nfocus on HTTPS, but that is there.\n\n438\n00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,700\nFTP also has got a secure implementation.\n\n439\n00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,970\nSo we wanna think about\nthose kinda things.\n\n440\n00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,210\nIPsec, very important one.\n\n441\n00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,730\nOften one that is overlooked in\nthe sense that although we may use it,\n\n442\n00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,540\nwe may not always understand how it is\ndeployed, and we were talking a bit about\n\n443\n00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,500\nthis yesterday when you and I were just\nchatting about cryptography and Windows.\n\n444\n00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,530\nAnd we were talking about IPsec and\nthe idea that in most of\n\n445\n00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,880\nthe Windows classes that you teach for\ninstance and occasionally I teach.\n\n446\n00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520\nThat we talk about\nimplementation of IPsec, but\n\n447\n00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,110\nwe tend to overlook at that level,\nin that class,\n\n448\n00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,230\nin that knowledge area, the nuts and bolts\nand the actual underlying architecture.\n\n449\n00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,430\n>> Right, yep.\n>> Because Windows kind of\n\n450\n00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,170\nobscures it, right?\n\n451\n00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,655\nIt's not really all that\nimportant to know it.\n\n452\n00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:34,116\n[CROSSTALK] You have a wizard,\nwe throw it and we manage implementation,\n\n453\n00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:37,990\ntypically policy based, a lot of times\nyou just apply a group policy in Windows.\n\n454\n00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,340\nBut IPsec is not just a Windows thing,\nnumber one.\n\n455\n00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,460\nIt is a network security\nimplementation of secure protocols.\n\n456\n00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,630\nBut it's not exclusively to Windows.\n\n457\n00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,280\nYou can use it in other systems.\n\n458\n00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,230\nSo, managing and\n\n459\n00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,950\nunderstanding the architecture of it,\nis also very important.\n\n460\n00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,520\nWe're gonna get into that and\ntalk a little bit about that at some\n\n461\n00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,080\npoint with you guys as well to make\nsure you understand things like Ike and\n\n462\n00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,980\nkey exchanges, and and all the things\nthat go into that to make sure you\n\n463\n00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,720\nreally understand what happens when we\ntake a look at IPsec top to bottom.\n\n464\n00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,778\nIt's one of those things that if I\ncould stand on one leg, close my eyes,\n\n465\n00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:13,310\nspin around three times, and\nexplain, it's a lot of fun.\n\n466\n00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So stay tuned for that,\n\n467\n00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,710\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n468\n00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,700\nBut you're gonna wanna also be aware of\nsome of the ports associated with these\n\n469\n00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,280\nprotocols that we're talking\nabout that are secure.\n\n470\n00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,980\nI knew I threw out NTP at\nyou at a prior episode.\n\n471\n00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,180\nTalked about the fact it was important,\nknowing what protocol that NTP is\n\n472\n00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,310\nassociated with, whether it's TCP or\nUDP, connection orient, connection-less.\n\n473\n00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,540\nWe spoke about that as well, but\n\n474\n00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,645\nmost importantly,\nknowing that it runs on, a drumroll.\n\n475\n00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:38,345\nWe don't have a drumroll.\n\n476\n00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:40,165\nWe need a drumroll sound effect, right?\n\n477\n00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:40,840\nThere you go.\n\n478\n00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,045\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What port does NCP run on?\n\n479\n00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:45,505\nWe talked about that, and\nI paused in the last episode and\n\n480\n00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,715\nasked you to think about that.\n\n481\n00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:48,665\nYou may or may not know that.\n\n482\n00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:52,128\nIf you haven't seen that episode, it's\na good place for us to do another quick\n\n483\n00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:55,132\nknowledge check for you, which is\ndo you know what port NTP runs on?\n\n484\n00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:56,762\nAnd I'm gonna pause for just a sec, and\n\n485\n00:23:56,762 --> 00:23:58,848\nlet you ponder that before\nwe give you the answer.\n\n486\n00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:03,329\nBut if you're not familiar with it, you're\nnot familiar with things like what HTTPS.\n\n487\n00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:05,779\nThe port for that is,\nwhat is the port for DNS?\n\n488\n00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,890\nWhat is the port for FTP?\n\n489\n00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,340\nPOP3, IMAP4,\nany of these things that we need to know.\n\n490\n00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,170\nSSH certainly, what is the port for that?\n\n491\n00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,320\nRDP in Windows, what is the port for that?\n\n492\n00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,270\nFor SQL and Query SQL.\n\n493\n00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,770\nSo a lot you gotta know out there.\n\n494\n00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,240\nIf you don't know these ports,\nyou gotta go out and look them up.\n\n495\n00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,880\nYou're gonna be expected to know them.\n\n496\n00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,081\nThis part of answering questions,\nyou're gonna need to know them.\n\n497\n00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:31,440\n>> Yeah because one,\nyou can't set up your firewall rules or\n\n498\n00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,260\nmake those exceptions if you don't\nknow what ports are coming across.\n\n499\n00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,700\nWhen you're analyzing you're traffic and\nyou're looking at that data,\n\n500\n00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,186\nyou've gotta know what those\nport numbers are representing.\n\n501\n00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:41,190\n>> Or know somebody who does.\n\n502\n00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,400\nHey, can you come over here for a minute?\n\n503\n00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,960\nI got a little question for ya.\n\n504\n00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,840\nThat's why we have interns, right?\n\n505\n00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,420\n>> Yeah, right. [LAUGH] >> That's\nexactly why we have interns.\n\n506\n00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,770\nSo NTP, by the way, right?\n\n507\n00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,130\nNTP, port 123,\nin case you were not aware of that.\n\n508\n00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,240\nWanna make sure we know that,\nand take a look for\n\n509\n00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,530\nsome of those other ports that I\nwas mentioning to you as well.\n\n510\n00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,650\nWe'll come up with a list and\nput them in the notes there for you.\n\n511\n00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,200\n>> Yeah,\nI've got a link I can throw out later on.\n\n512\n00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,410\n>> And we'll throw some stuff out there.\n\n513\n00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,080\nIt's not gonna be in this exact episode.\n\n514\n00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,510\nThis part of the conversation\nwill be a little bit later on.\n\n515\n00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,090\nWe'll actually reference that and\nsee that, not so much in cryptography, but\n\n516\n00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,560\nin the networking and\ntelecommunications area.\n\n517\n00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560\nWe'll talk about the network and\nthe structure there.\n\n518\n00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,730\nThat's where we're really going\nto get into that conversation.\n\n519\n00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,200\nThat'll be a future episode that\nyou'll want to take a look at and\n\n520\n00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,310\nmake sure you're familiar with.\n\n521\n00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,420\nYou'll notice that some of\nthe protocols we're looking at there.\n\n522\n00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,660\nWe're also going to make sure that we\nthink about the fact that algorithms and\n\n523\n00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,520\nthe security of algorithms help us to\naddress a lot of these problems and\n\n524\n00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,545\nconcerns we have around\ninformation security.\n\n525\n00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:32,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know,\n\n526\n00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,920\nare we able to eliminate people being\nable to snoop and see our data?\n\n527\n00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,340\nYou were just talking about firewalls.\n\n528\n00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,450\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> And firewall rules.\n\n529\n00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,690\nAnd, we had that whole conversation\nin our last, you know,\n\n530\n00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,500\nprogram that we did about IPS and\nIDS and firewalls and all the different\n\n531\n00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,450\ngenerations of firewalls, you know,\ngood times, right, good times.\n\n532\n00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,910\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Firewall generations,\n\n533\n00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,990\nreally cool stuff.\n\n534\n00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,900\nSo but we talked about the fact that\nfirewall logic has gotten better as\n\n535\n00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,780\nfirewalls have progressed,\nand a fifth gen firewall,\n\n536\n00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,740\na next gen firewall that's a kernel proxy\nfirewall is gonna be tremendously more\n\n537\n00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,670\nvaluable to us in terms of keeping the\nflow of information managed and monitored\n\n538\n00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,530\nthan our first gen, a gen one firewall\nthat was a packet filter, where we had no\n\n539\n00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,520\nunderstanding of the logic of what was\ngoing on, no idea of statefulness,\n\n540\n00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,510\nreally didn't understand anything except\nfor what was in the one data packet.\n\n541\n00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,050\nAnd so, figuring out how to use\nencryption to safeguard information.\n\n542\n00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,780\nCryptography to safeguard information,\nvery important right?\n\n543\n00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,210\nAnd do we have that picture,\nthat we were talking about?\n\n544\n00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,320\nThe XOR,\nthat we wanna put up here quickly.\n\n545\n00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,860\nSo, we're just gonna zoom in.\n\n546\n00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,430\nWhoa, there we go.\n\n547\n00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,180\n[LAUGH] We're gonna assume.\n\n548\n00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,740\nOver to the side for just a second.\n\n549\n00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,010\nBut you know the last thing we really\njust want to at least prime your thought\n\n550\n00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,240\nprocess with here is as we're starting\nto talk about cryptography is this idea\n\n551\n00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,580\nof exclusive ORing or XOR generically\nas we refer to it in cryptography.\n\n552\n00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,210\nAnd it's this idea, and the XOR symbol\nby the way, I'll just point it out,\n\n553\n00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,610\nmaybe Mike we can highlight that on\nthe left there where it says XOR.\n\n554\n00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,640\n>> Maybe it will let me draw while I zoom.\n\n555\n00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,360\n>> Can you?\nI don't know if you can.\n\n556\n00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,080\nOh maybe not.\n\n557\n00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,520\nMaybe we could zoom out and\njust draw it back in.\n\n558\n00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,370\nBut just want highlight that.\n\n559\n00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,370\nThe XOR symbol there is just\ngonna be seen traditionally.\n\n560\n00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,290\nNo big deal, that's fine.\n\n561\n00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,130\nPeople see where it is.\n\n562\n00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,290\nThey have a general sense.\n\n563\n00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:20,107\nIt's gonna be seen as this little,\nit's almost looks like a little squarish\n\n564\n00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:25,020\nrectangle ish, not rectangle, octagonal\nkind of thing or whatever that is.\n\n565\n00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,860\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right but it's got a little\n\n566\n00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,580\ncross in the middle of it.\n\n567\n00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,400\nAnd so\nthe ideas that when we see this symbol,\n\n568\n00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,090\nwe know we're talking about XORing,\nbut the XOR logic,\n\n569\n00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,555\nas you can see at the top, is that\na zero XOR to a zero equals a zero.\n\n570\n00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,822\nIn other words, if we have 00 or\n11 as the bits line up,\n\n571\n00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:43,317\nas we're gonna see down below,\nwe get the same bits, right?\n\n572\n00:27:43,317 --> 00:27:47,245\nIf we have a one and a zero or\na zero and a one, we have a difference,\n\n573\n00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:48,680\nwe get different bits.\n\n574\n00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,280\nSo if we look at the first\nexample to encrypt there,\n\n575\n00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,090\nthen we see that the plantext is in black,\nright.\n\n576\n00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,130\nSecret key which would be the key or\n\n577\n00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,160\nthe cryptovariable that we\nare applying is going to be in blue.\n\n578\n00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,640\nAnd the ciphertext winds up being in red.\n\n579\n00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,880\nIf this was a holiday show we'd have to\nmake the plaintext in green right, and\n\n580\n00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,710\nciphertext in red and that kind of stuff.\n\n581\n00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,990\nBut the idea here is that the plaintext\nis zero at the top on the left for\n\n582\n00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,960\nthe first one.\n\n583\n00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,260\nAnd then we see the secret key,\nthe bit identifier there is a one.\n\n584\n00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,010\nAnd so because we're XORing zero and\na one different bits, what do we get?\n\n585\n00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,810\nWe get a one as the ciphertext.\n\n586\n00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,040\nWhere we'd see the same thing on\nthe next one, same pattern repeats.\n\n587\n00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,410\nThird bit in, one for the plaintext\none for the secret key and so\n\n588\n00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,490\nwe get the same bit and\nthe same bit is represented as a zero.\n\n589\n00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,350\nAnd so\nwe transfer what is 00110101 is plaintext,\n\n590\n00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:46,660\nwe transfer that by applying\nthe key into 11010110.\n\n591\n00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:53,990\nAnd you can see it bears no resemblance to\nthe plain text, the original plaintext.\n\n592\n00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,010\nCiphertext has been transformed by\nthe application of the secret key.\n\n593\n00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,810\nAnd we use the same thought process\nthe XORing in reverse, as you can see,\n\n594\n00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,460\nwhen we do a decrypt, where again we\nhave the cypher text up top in red,\n\n595\n00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,020\nwe have the secret key down below in blue.\n\n596\n00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,920\nRight?\nSecret key, notice is the same for\n\n597\n00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,090\nboth operations, right?\n\n598\n00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:12,990\nIdentical.\n\n599\n00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,190\nAnd so we run it in reverse, and what we\nthen find is one and one are the same.\n\n600\n00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,860\nWe get a zero, right,\ncuz we have sameness.\n\n601\n00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,350\nOne and one the same, we get a zero.\n\n602\n00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,380\nZero and one for\nthe third operational item there.\n\n603\n00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,200\nThird column, zero, one,\ndifferent, we get a one.\n\n604\n00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,000\nAnd as we walk through and we keep going,\nwhat we get back is the original plaintext\n\n605\n00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,420\nthat we started with in the example up\ntop there, which if you do a comparison,\n\n606\n00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,840\nright, as Mike was just highlighting\nto show you, we get 00110101.\n\n607\n00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,620\nSo we have decrypted successfully\nthe plaintext that we encrypted before.\n\n608\n00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,110\nSo this idea of XORing is this\nidea of being able to go in and\n\n609\n00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,080\nto be able to understand how the plaintext\nor the cipher text and the key\n\n610\n00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,980\ncombine together and generate the output,\nwhatever that output is, plaintext or\n\n611\n00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,470\ncipher text, depending on the nature of\nthe operation or the way we're running it.\n\n612\n00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,330\nSo we call this XORing, this is what it\nis referred to as, it is a key component,\n\n613\n00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,590\na key thought process of what\nwe do inside of cryptography and\n\n614\n00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,240\nwe wanted you to be aware of it,\nto see it, to get a visual on it,\n\n615\n00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,760\nbecause it's very hard to describe\nthat just simply by talking about it.\n\n616\n00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,875\nYou've got to see it to understand it.\n\n617\n00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,320\n[LAUGH] But now that you've seen it,\nhopefully we'll be referring to\n\n618\n00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,360\nit a little later on when we\ntalk about stream cyphers and\n\n619\n00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,210\nblock cyphers, what we're doing\nthere to XOR, and how that works.\n\n620\n00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,420\nWe're then gonna refer back to that idea,\nand in a future episode you'll at\n\n621\n00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,020\nleast have seen it here and you'll have\nan idea of how to progress through that.\n\n622\n00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,160\n>> I like it.\n\n623\n00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,000\nOkay, very good, very good.\n\n624\n00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,660\nCuz if Mike likes it,\nthat means we're okay if Mike likes it.\n\n625\n00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,090\nYou remember the Life commercials?\n\n626\n00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,590\n>> Hey, Mikey!\n\n627\n00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,330\n>> Remember Life, right, Mikey.\n\n628\n00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,930\nMikey likes it, right, exactly.\n\n629\n00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,840\nAll right, so\nwe're dating ourselves here once again.\n\n630\n00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:56,040\nAll right, so I think we've done a great\njob of kind of laying out the road map for\n\n631\n00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,390\nus in terms of understanding some\nof the operational vocabulary.\n\n632\n00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:04,300\nSome of the things we gotta do to get\nready to really crack the code so\n\n633\n00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,930\nto speak, right?\n\n634\n00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,220\nForgive the bad pun.\n\n635\n00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,730\nAround cryptography as we will\ndo in some future episodes.\n\n636\n00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,350\nWe're gonna come back in our next episode,\ntalk a little bit about stream and\n\n637\n00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,600\nblock cyphers.\n\n638\n00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,810\nGet into the differences there, how we\nmanage information, talk about algorithms,\n\n639\n00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,790\nsymmetric versus asymmetric,\nwe'll talk about the differences there.\n\n640\n00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,100\nPublic private key\nversus private key only,\n\n641\n00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,550\nand we'll begin to really talk\nabout strengths and weaknesses and\n\n642\n00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,270\nhow we set all of this up and\nwhat we can expect to do with it.\n\n643\n00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,960\nBut that's gonna be after we take a break\nand come back for our next episode.\n\n644\n00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,860\nSo for now, we're gonna say goodbye for\nthe moment.\n\n645\n00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,268\nWe're gonna thank you for your time and\n\n646\n00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:46,614\nattention and\nwe'll see you in our next episode.\n\n647\n00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,380\n[MUSIC]\n\n648\n00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,030\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n649\n00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,849\nI'm Mike Roderick,

hair then I do, so I don't\nknow about the improved part but Anyhow so\n\n653\n00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:01,009\nwe left off in the last segment,\n\n654\n00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:03,911\nwe were talking about really\nit was the vocabulary list.\n\n655\n00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:05,584\n>> It was the vocabulary list.\n\n656\n00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:06,443\n>> It was a dictionary attack.\n\n657\n00:32:06,443 --> 00:32:09,130\n>> It was, indeed.\n\n658\n00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,500\n>> So we've gone through\na lot of the terminology and\n\n659\n00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,820\nwhat we're going to do now is we're going\nto take a look at those same things.\n\n660\n00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,730\nBut we're going to go a little more\nin depth into how they function and\n\n661\n00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,920\nhow we need to understand those concepts.\n\n662\n00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,930\nNot just for the exam, but for\n\n663\n00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,720\nreal life as we select which technologies\nwe're gonna implement in our environment.\n\n664\n00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,750\nSo that's where we're going and\nAdam I'm gonna turn it over to you.\n\n665\n00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,950\n>> All right, very good.\n\n666\n00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,830\nSo let's talk a little bit about\nstream and block side for a second.\n\n667\n00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,820\nWe spent some time talking,\n\n668\n00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,590\nlaying out vocabulary lists\nas we were just reviewing.\n\n669\n00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,300\nAnd we've talked about the general\nideas behind cryptography.\n\n670\n00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,060\nI want to spend some time now\nreally delving into the details.\n\n671\n00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,340\nAnd we always seem to find that as we\ndiscuss the details we uncover a lot\n\n672\n00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,600\nof interesting things and\n\n673\n00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,920\nopportunities to make sure we're\nfocused on the right level of material.\n\n674\n00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,559\nAs you said for\n\n675\n00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:57,085\nthe real world as opposed to the fake\nworld where we don't do this kinda stuff.\n\n676\n00:32:57,085 --> 00:32:59,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when we talk about stream ciphers\n\n677\n00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,840\nand block ciphers, one of the first\nthings we want to delve into.\n\n678\n00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,040\nWe're talking about the different\nways in which we actually engage\n\n679\n00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,450\nin applying encryption to information.\n\n680\n00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,310\nSo we're talking about cryptography.\n\n681\n00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,520\nWe are talking about confidentiality\nhere specifically, wanna be clear.\n\n682\n00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,840\nWe will spend some time focused\non integrity a little later on,\n\n683\n00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,720\nin one of our future discussions when we\ndeal with things like digital signatures\n\n684\n00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,450\nand hashing, and discuss nonrepudiation.\n\n685\n00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,100\nBut for right now, we're gonna focus\non this idea of confidentiality.\n\n686\n00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,500\nAnd so we're take a look at\nthe different ways in which we can apply\n\n687\n00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,160\nconfidentiality to information.\n\n688\n00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,390\nSo stream ciphers, are gonna basically\nas we put up on the screen here for\n\n689\n00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,370\nyou, operate on data as\na continuous stream of plaintext.\n\n690\n00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:46,400\nSo if imagine a hose that is\nspraying out some water, and\n\n691\n00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,290\nthat stream of information\nthat comes out of the hose\n\n692\n00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,520\nis then being taken into the crypto\nsystem and being encrypted.\n\n693\n00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,750\nAnd at that point then transferred\nover to a recipient or\n\n694\n00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,030\nwhatever we do with it,\nlong term storage, data on a wire,\n\n695\n00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,490\ndoesn't really matter where\nthe data goes at that point.\n\n696\n00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,610\nBut the crypto system encrypts the data as\na continuous stream of bits of ones and\n\n697\n00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,980\nzeros in effect.\n\n698\n00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,890\nSo have that mental image of that stream\nof water or stream of data coming out of\n\n699\n00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,090\nthe hose and that's what we're\nthinking about with a stream cipher.\n\n700\n00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,950\nWhen we're talking about block\nciphers we're talking about instead of\n\n701\n00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,320\na continuous stream we're talking\nabout thick sized blocks of\n\n702\n00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,520\nplain texts as you can see.\n\n703\n00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,710\nAnd this idea here would be\nalmost like little packages or\n\n704\n00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,840\nbales of information that are boxed up and\nmoved down an assembly line.\n\n705\n00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,740\nAnd as they move into the cryptosystem,\nthe cryptosystem operates on that box\n\n706\n00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,310\nof ones and zeros, that box of the bits\nof data, moves it out the back end and\n\n707\n00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,040\nmoves another one into the crypto system.\n\n708\n00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,470\nDoor closes, we encrypt,\nmoves out the back end.\n\n709\n00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,010\nI don't know if you've ever seen one\nof those industrial dishwashers in\n\n710\n00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:53,820\na restaurant where they slide the tray\nof dishes in, bring the door down,\n\n711\n00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,350\nit kinda does it's magic,\nmoves out the back end.\n\n712\n00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,530\nAny of those mental images\nyou have of an assembly line,\n\n713\n00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,950\nsomething like that,\nthat would be the block cipher.\n\n714\n00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,770\nThat's what we're thinking of anyway.\n\n715\n00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:09,470\nAnd so stream ciphers are very well\nsuited for certain kinds of activities.\n\n716\n00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,980\nBecause we're operating on data in\na continuous stream, this one and\n\n717\n00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,705\nzero stream of bits that just comes\nroaring into the crypto system and\n\n718\n00:35:17,705 --> 00:35:19,285\ncontinues to move through.\n\n719\n00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:22,555\nWe first of all see this implemented\nmore often than not in hardware.\n\n720\n00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:26,977\nBecause this kind of a solution has to use\nhardware acceleration and have hardware\n\n721\n00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:31,612\ncapabilities dedicated to the encryption\nand ultimately the decryption solution.\n\n722\n00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:35,710\nBoth of these solutions, when you think\nabout what we do with cryptography,\n\n723\n00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,362\nare very resource intensive.\n\n724\n00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:41,312\nWe're talking about a lot of memory and\na lot of processor cycles.\n\n725\n00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:43,992\nAnd so\nwe tend to see these solutions being done,\n\n726\n00:35:43,992 --> 00:35:47,392\nat least in high end systems,\nin dedicated hardware implementation.\n\n727\n00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:48,842\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n728\n00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,770\nThings that might be found\nunder stream ciphers\n\n729\n00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:56,040\nwould be things such as streaming audio,\nstreaming video solutions.\n\n730\n00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,340\nThey tend to be done and\n\n731\n00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,980\nencrypted in streams because we\ndon't wanna chunk that data.\n\n732\n00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,830\nCuz if we break it up,\n\n733\n00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,870\nobviously we impact the integrity of\nthe data in terms of the flow and\n\n734\n00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:10,400\nthe information that's being received\nby the end user becomes very choppy.\n\n735\n00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,500\nIt's very hard to have that\nconversation when it is blocked.\n\n736\n00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,560\nSo, we tend to do stream ciphers for\nthese kinds of activities.\n\n737\n00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,980\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n738\n00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,320\nAnd, I think, if I'm not mistaken, we have\nsome graphics that we have created for\n\n739\n00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,150\nour lovely studio audience that\nwe want to share with them.\n\n740\n00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,150\nMike 2.0 and I, have spent some time,\n\n741\n00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:34,140\nmainly more Don than me, but\nour new version of Mike today,\n\n742\n00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,630\nDon, has spent some time helping me to\ngenerate some graphics for our discussion.\n\n743\n00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,900\nAnd so we're gonna throw them up\nthroughout the next several discussions as\n\n744\n00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,930\nwe go through and\n\n745\n00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,840\ntalk about the different ways these things\nwork to give you some visuals on this.\n\n746\n00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,620\nOn the left area you can\nsee we have plaintext,\n\n747\n00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,720\nthe lovely green shade of plaintext today.\n\n748\n00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,150\nSo the reason we chose green was\nit the whole spring thing or\n\n749\n00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,630\njust feeling green today?\n\n750\n00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,940\n>> You know in my mind it looked a lot\nbetter than it did in Visio, but\n\n751\n00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,472\nI was thinking like a stop light.\n\n752\n00:37:01,472 --> 00:37:02,340\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Green is go, the text you can use,\n\n753\n00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,196\nthe red is Stop, text you can't use.\n\n754\n00:37:03,196 --> 00:37:05,751\n>> Got that.\n\n755\n00:37:05,751 --> 00:37:07,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See I like that.\n\n756\n00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,600\nThat's very good.\n\n757\n00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,470\nThat's why you always want to ask for\nclarification from the artist.\n\n758\n00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,240\nBecause you always want to\nunderstand their context,\n\n759\n00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,730\ntheir mindset about how\nthey produce things.\n\n760\n00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,720\nA lot of it is usually\njust ridiculousness, but\n\n761\n00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,970\nyou always want to ask anyway.\n\n762\n00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,790\n>> I didn't have time to do\nthe Bob Ross happy trees and all that.\n\n763\n00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,460\n>> Okay.\n\n764\n00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,300\n>> Just ran out of time.\n\n765\n00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,380\n>> So we got what we got.\n\n766\n00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,080\nIt's okay.\nSo plaintext on the left there, right?\n\n767\n00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,160\nAnd you'll see the plaintext is coming in.\n\n768\n00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,800\nWe were representing it\ngoing into the keystream.\n\n769\n00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,310\nAnd the solution down there in\nthe key stream generator being XORed\n\n770\n00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,490\nwith the zeroes and the ones.\n\n771\n00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,860\nYou can see the stream that is\nbeing represented there with our\n\n772\n00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,080\nlittle green circle.\n\n773\n00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,920\nRemember the crosshair icon there\nis representing the XOR function\n\n774\n00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,180\nthat we spoke about in our last episode.\n\n775\n00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,460\nThat idea of being able to take the key\nand the plaintext, do the comparison,\n\n776\n00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,830\nlining up the numbers,\nthe zeros and the ones, the bits.\n\n777\n00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,970\nAnd then as we do that,\nunderstanding whether or\n\n778\n00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:02,020\nnot we have two values that are the same,\nor two values that are different.\n\n779\n00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,020\nAnd as a result of that, the XOR function\nwill then spit out on the back end what\n\n780\n00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,800\nour cypher text is by basically combining\nthe key and the plain text together.\n\n781\n00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,260\nAnd so, if we just do a quick example of\none of them, just as a go through, right?\n\n782\n00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,590\nJust to remind you quickly,\nwe're not gonna do the entire thing.\n\n783\n00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,860\nBut, let's do one.\n\n784\n00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,690\nIf we do a zero from the key of\nthe first spot on the key, so\n\n785\n00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,040\nDon's just gonna reproduce the key and\nthe plain text there for us.\n\n786\n00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,750\nPerfect.\n\n787\n00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,360\nAnd so, if we look at the key on the top,\nplaintext on the bottom, we see zero and\n\n788\n00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,640\nzero lining up in the first column there.\n\n789\n00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,030\nSo zero and zero will be the same right?\n\n790\n00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,060\nBoth those values are the same.\n\n791\n00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,810\nAs a result of that we wind up\nrepresenting the first bit of\n\n792\n00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:47,580\nthe plaintext being converted to\nciphertext right there as a zero.\n\n793\n00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,560\nSo if we just walk through that logic\nthe next column over the one and\n\n794\n00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,290\nthe zero there, perfect.\n\n795\n00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,250\nAnd as a result of that we\nsee different characters or\n\n796\n00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,880\ndifferent bits being compared.\n\n797\n00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,020\nAnd so the XOR spits out a one to\nrepresent different as opposed to same.\n\n798\n00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,860\nAnd so as we go through that logic,\nwe're not gonna step through all of them,\n\n799\n00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,141\nyou get the general idea, right?\n\n800\n00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:09,175\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Gonna run out of ability\n\n801\n00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:09,692\nto draw, to create those columns.\n\n802\n00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:10,210\nBut as you go through\nthe whole line there, we XOR\n\n803\n00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,110\nthat crosshairs in the middle there is\nsupposed to represent the XORing function.\n\n804\n00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:15,817\nJust want to remind you of that and\nshow you that\n\n805\n00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:20,887\nthat output winds up on\nthe right hand side there,\n\n806\n00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:25,160\nbeing converted into cypher text.\n\n807\n00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,020\nSo thinking through that, this is what\na typical solution would look like.\n\n808\n00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,700\nRight?\nWe're gonna run through the cryptosystem\n\n809\n00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,560\nthere in the middle.\n\n810\n00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,090\nThe algorithms, the stream algorithms\nwill be applied, whatever they are.\n\n811\n00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,370\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n812\n00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,675\nonce we're done we see cipher text\nbeing produced on the right hand side.\n\n813\n00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:46,004\nAnd so this is a general representation,\nright?\n\n814\n00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:49,116\nWe want to give you just the general\npicture, general visual on this,\n\n815\n00:39:49,116 --> 00:39:51,597\ndoesn't have to be authoritative\nin the senses maybe,\n\n816\n00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,798\nthe only one you look at Encourage\nyou to go out and find others, right?\n\n817\n00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:56,061\nThere's many of these out there.\n\n818\n00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,632\nBut the idea is just very simply\nrepresenting this thought process, so\n\n819\n00:39:59,632 --> 00:40:03,040\nyou can link this in your mind\nhow these things are working.\n\n820\n00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,050\nNotice also our vocabulary that\nwe've defined in our prior episode,\n\n821\n00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,810\nour key stream generator up at the top.\n\n822\n00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:12,540\nOur key stream is being represented\nas flowing into the crypto system.\n\n823\n00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,990\nWe have the XOR function there in\nthe middle, plaintext on the lift,\n\n824\n00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,680\nciphertext on the right,\nthe key being represented\n\n825\n00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,020\noff to the left there of the key\nstream generator up at the top, right?\n\n826\n00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,130\nSo a good general visual representation\nof how a stream cipher will work.\n\n827\n00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,490\nGood.\n>> Excellent.\n\n828\n00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,500\n>> All right, wonderful.\n\n829\n00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,940\nLet's move on to block ciphers then.\n\n830\n00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,360\nLet's talk about what a block cipher is.\n\n831\n00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,360\nWe'll go back to our notes and\n\n832\n00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,229\nthen we'll jump into the,\nwe can jump into the diagram.\n\n833\n00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:38,598\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> No, see now I ruined the surprise,\n\n834\n00:40:38,598 --> 00:40:39,325\nlet me go back here.\n\n835\n00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:40,045\n[LAUGH]\n>> You did, you did. Yeah.\n\n836\n00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:42,955\nI was just gonna offer a few points to\nadd to the notes before we go back.\n\n837\n00:40:42,955 --> 00:40:44,740\nSo, we do have a diagram for\n\n838\n00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,740\nyou on blocks as well as you quickly saw.\n\n839\n00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,370\nAll right so with block ciphers,\nthe idea here, right,\n\n840\n00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,160\nfixed size blocks of plaintext.\n\n841\n00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,680\nWe're not as concerned about\nthe block size right now.\n\n842\n00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,730\nThat will depend on the algorithms\nthat are being used.\n\n843\n00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,220\nSo let's not worry about\nwhat the block size is.\n\n844\n00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,000\nLet's just focus on the fact\nthat it's fixed for\n\n845\n00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,210\nwhatever that particular algorithm\nchoice may be for the moment.\n\n846\n00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,620\nBut the idea here is\nthat we're tending to do\n\n847\n00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,790\na idea of chunking data\nwhen we use block ciphers.\n\n848\n00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,670\nAnd the reason I'm specifying this is\nwe wanna understand the difference\n\n849\n00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,780\nbetween the stream and the block as\nbeing the way we deal with the data.\n\n850\n00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,040\nAnd by blocking it or\nchunking it into fixed sizes,\n\n851\n00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,740\nwe're then going to be able to make\nthe data a little bit more manageable for\n\n852\n00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,800\nus in the sense of being able to\nunderstand how to do other things.\n\n853\n00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,620\nAnd we'll look at multiple rounds of\nXORing or multiple rounds of output\n\n854\n00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:40,080\nbecoming input for the next go around in\nthese algorithms to then further encrypt\n\n855\n00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,080\nand further obfuscate the data because\nof the block, the nature of the block.\n\n856\n00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,550\nSo we could do different things than we\ndo with a stream which is just basically\n\n857\n00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:51,050\none pass on the data through\nthe cryptosystem, encrypt it out,\n\n858\n00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,650\nput it on the back end of\nthe ciphertext and then we move on.\n\n859\n00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,918\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n860\n00:41:54,918 --> 00:41:58,440\nWe are gonna talk about\nthe different algorithms\n\n861\n00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,638\nthat will be used here in a little while\nand set them up under each category.\n\n862\n00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:05,730\nWe also wanna know that certain\nblock ciphers actually emulate or\n\n863\n00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,420\nact as if they are stream-based ciphers.\n\n864\n00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,560\nSo we have a little\nstealthy thing going on,\n\n865\n00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,660\nbecause certain block ciphers\nwill actually masquerade\n\n866\n00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,100\nIn terms of their activity and\nthe way they work, as stream ciphers.\n\n867\n00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,370\nAnd we'll discuss that and\n\n868\n00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,740\ncome up with a discussion point\non that in a little while.\n\n869\n00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,590\nLet's go and actually,\nlet's take a look at the diagram\n\n870\n00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,725\nthat we have thrown out there that\nyou would put together for us.\n\n871\n00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:31,275\nAnd so, as soon as we zoom in there,\n\n872\n00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:34,775\nwhat we're gonna see is the ability,\nthere we go.\n\n873\n00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:39,885\nWe're gonna see the ability to be able to\nsee our plaintext up at the upper left.\n\n874\n00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:44,685\nWe see plaintext sentence, the dog is\nblue, and so we're gonna block that\n\n875\n00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:48,800\ninto two distinct blocks of plaintext\nthat we're then gonna operate on.\n\n876\n00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,480\nThe dog, and is blue.\n\n877\n00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,660\nBlock one, block two there.\n\n878\n00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,170\nSo the text has been chunked,\nand then we apply our\n\n879\n00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,120\nkey inside of our cryptosystem that\nwill do the encryption for us, and so\n\n880\n00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,090\nyou see the key being brought in at\nthe lower left into the cryptosystem, and\n\n881\n00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:08,880\nthen as we go through the block cipher\nin the cryptosystem, what happens at\n\n882\n00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,130\nthe end is you'll see that we are gonna\noutput two blocks of cipher text.\n\n883\n00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:18,470\nThe magic happens inside\nthe containment vessel.\n\n884\n00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,530\nAnd then block one and block two on the\nfar side, ciphertext coming out the far\n\n885\n00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:27,850\nside in our representation just\nrandomized alphanumeric output,\n\n886\n00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:32,150\ngibberish is I think, the formal\ncryptographic term that we use for that.\n\n887\n00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,560\nRight.\nBut the idea's that we basically\n\n888\n00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,840\njust have randomized output that is now\nrendered to ciphertext unintelligible,\n\n889\n00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,970\ncannot be read by anybody that doesn't\nhave the key, and the ability to\n\n890\n00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:44,940\nunderstand how to run the cryptosystem\nin reverse to effectively unencrypt.\n\n891\n00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,825\nAt least that's the theory anyway.\n\n892\n00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:48,525\nWe know that that doesn't\nalways hold true.\n\n893\n00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,855\nIf we implement the system incorrectly,\nif the key is weak.\n\n894\n00:43:51,855 --> 00:43:53,495\nWe've talked about things like key space.\n\n895\n00:43:53,495 --> 00:43:56,485\nIf the key space is a vocabulary\nterm that's too small,\n\n896\n00:43:56,485 --> 00:44:01,325\nif we have collisions where we have the\nability to represent that message through\n\n897\n00:44:01,325 --> 00:44:03,745\nseveral different ways, and\nunderstand that it can be encrypted and\n\n898\n00:44:03,745 --> 00:44:07,850\ndecrypted as a result of that using\ncertain keys, these things can lead to\n\n899\n00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:12,550\nweaknesses in our system, and as a result,\npotentially exposure of the ciphertext.\n\n900\n00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,790\nBut assuming we implement correctly,\n\n901\n00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:19,010\nthen we should not be able to unencrypt\nthat ciphertext without knowing the key.\n\n902\n00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,260\nAnd so this is one of the key criteria\nthat we wanna keep in mind is that\n\n903\n00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,860\nthe strength of these cryptosystems\nis the strength of the algorithms.\n\n904\n00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,400\nThe bit strength, the actual size\nof the keys that are being used,\n\n905\n00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,890\nas we talked about, as well as the key\nspace, the actual total number of keys\n\n906\n00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,620\nthat potentially exist as the result\nof the way we implement that algorithm.\n\n907\n00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,920\nTwo very important things\nto be concerned about and\n\n908\n00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,930\nto be thinking about as we\ngo through this discussion.\n\n909\n00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:47,430\nThe other thing we want to\nadd in here will be this idea\n\n910\n00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,530\nof initialization vectors,\nor what we call IVs.\n\n911\n00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,920\nWe haven't put it on the diagram.\n\n912\n00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,620\nIt's really just more\na thought process for\n\n913\n00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,040\nus to be aware of the fact that these\nare the random numbers that are included.\n\n914\n00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,440\nSometimes we'll say they're injected\ninto the system in order for\n\n915\n00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,070\nus to be able to kick off the process.\n\n916\n00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,190\nInitialization, starting something off,\nthis is a randomized value that is\n\n917\n00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:12,670\nused and\nadded in to almost be like a seed value or\n\n918\n00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,780\na catalyst, that starts the reaction of\nconverting plain text into cipher text.\n\n919\n00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,020\nBut as a result of this, we will then\nbe able to, by adding randomness into\n\n920\n00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:27,590\nthe system, further enhance the security\nof the cryptosystem by making it that much\n\n921\n00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:32,030\nmore difficult for somebody who wants to\ngrab that data, to understand how to do so\n\n922\n00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:36,020\nby re-engineering, cuz they would have\nto now have the initialization vector,\n\n923\n00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:40,480\nthe IV,\nplus the key to then truly re-engineer and\n\n924\n00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,780\nrun the cryptosystem back where\nit's an unencrypted data.\n\n925\n00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:48,190\nAnd so as a result, this is again, this\nidea of layered defense, defense in depth.\n\n926\n00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:53,600\nBuilding multiple layers into a system\nto make it that much more difficult for\n\n927\n00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,250\npeople that don't belong using the system,\nto understand it's architecture and\n\n928\n00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:01,170\nas a result, understand how to break\nthat system whatever that may be.\n\n929\n00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,230\nSo think about that.\n\n930\n00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,160\nUnderstand IVs are used for\nthat randomization.\n\n931\n00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,474\nRandomize starting values.\n\n932\n00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:10,510\nAnd they're also added to re-encryption\nruns as we iterate through,\n\n933\n00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:15,680\nto again add further randomness as we go\nthrough, and to really allow us to create\n\n934\n00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,730\nthese complex, highly secure systems,\nagain relatively speaking, is to\n\n935\n00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,680\nmake sure that we are adding defense and\ndepth, adding security at multiple layers.\n\n936\n00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,570\nThis idea of re-encrypting the same\nplaintext twice by running it through\n\n937\n00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,980\nan IV twice, meaning two different random\nvalues, will give us even stronger\n\n938\n00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:39,950\nciphertext out the back end, and this is\ntypically what the IV's are used for.\n\n939\n00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,490\nRemember IVs, initialization vectors\nthemselves are not encrypted.\n\n940\n00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,060\nSo it's not that we have to\nencrypt the data that we're using\n\n941\n00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,130\nthe randomness initially.\n\n942\n00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,250\nWe're just adding it to the mix.\n\n943\n00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,490\nIt's almost like an ingredient when\nyou're baking that you add in.\n\n944\n00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:53,840\nNot a secret ingredient, right?\n\n945\n00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,390\nNot one that nobody knows, but\none that's commonly available.\n\n946\n00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,730\nSo just imagine that and\nunderstand how that will work.\n\n947\n00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,260\n>> Yeah cuz otherwise only you and Colonel\nSanders will be able to read that message.\n\n948\n00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,448\n>> Or Ronald McDonald.\n\n949\n00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:05,058\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely correct.\n\n950\n00:47:05,058 --> 00:47:07,148\n>> [LAUGH] Cuz, you always wanna\nknow what's in the secret sauce,\n\n951\n00:47:07,148 --> 00:47:08,140\nbut you never quite find out.\n\n952\n00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,197\n>> Yeah, you're never brave enough to ask.\n\n953\n00:47:09,197 --> 00:47:10,158\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n954\n00:47:10,158 --> 00:47:14,900\nthat's I think a good overview for\nus on streams and the blocks.\n\n955\n00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,360\nHopefully the diagrams are helpful for\nyou just to get a point of reference,\n\n956\n00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,740\na visual reference there.\n\n957\n00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,080\nLet's talk about some other\nkinds of ciphers that exist.\n\n958\n00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,710\nSo when we go back and\nwe take a look at block and stream.\n\n959\n00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:32,560\nWe also have substitution ciphers, and we\nalso have this idea of just scrambling and\n\n960\n00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,660\ndealing with transposition, and so\nyou'll see the initialization vector\n\n961\n00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,788\nconversation that we just had has been\nrecorded for you there in our notes.\n\n962\n00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:45,155\nSo, substitution ciphers are gonna be\nsome of the oldest ciphers that we have\n\n963\n00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:48,999\nhistorically going backwards in time,\nlooking at cryptography.\n\n964\n00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:53,787\nAnd a good example of that one you\noften hear used is a Caesar cipher,\n\n965\n00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:58,495\nas in Julius Caesar,\nthe progenitor of the Caesar salad, right?\n\n966\n00:47:58,495 --> 00:47:59,517\nSo the guy who basically.\n\n967\n00:47:59,517 --> 00:48:02,845\nThroughout his life came up with\ngreat marketing concepts and\n\n968\n00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:04,900\ngreat ways to market himself.\n\n969\n00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,870\nAnd so the Caesar Cipher is that cipher\nthat was used, historically attributed to\n\n970\n00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,785\nJulius Caesar, to send information\nto his troops in the field.\n\n971\n00:48:13,785 --> 00:48:18,695\nAnd the idea was we basically shifted or\nrotated the alphabet that was\n\n972\n00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:23,695\nused to effectively encrypt the plain\ntext by a certain number of spaces.\n\n973\n00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:27,155\nYou know the Caesar Cipher\nshifted it by three, but\n\n974\n00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:30,025\nwhatever it was at the end of\nthe day it doesn't really matter.\n\n975\n00:48:30,025 --> 00:48:31,765\nThe idea was you would simply shift or\n\n976\n00:48:31,765 --> 00:48:34,615\nrotate the alphabet by\na certain number of spaces.\n\n977\n00:48:34,615 --> 00:48:37,340\nAnd so there were lots of different\nways of doing this throughout history.\n\n978\n00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:42,094\nThere were a polyalphabetic ciphers\nthat use multiple alphabets to then be\n\n979\n00:48:42,094 --> 00:48:45,647\nable to create a matrix and\ndo the shift in the rotation.\n\n980\n00:48:45,647 --> 00:48:48,160\nThere was the Vigenère cipher.\n\n981\n00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,230\nSo there were many different\nways of doing this.\n\n982\n00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,330\nIf you're interested in\nthe history of ciphers,\n\n983\n00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,110\nthe history of the way in\nwhich cryptography was\n\n984\n00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:59,490\ncarried out there are several good\nbooks out there for you to look at.\n\n985\n00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:03,000\nCode Breakers is one of them,\nthere's a lot of material out there.\n\n986\n00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,410\nI would not worry too much\nabout historical ciphers and\n\n987\n00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,800\nthe references to them as you look to\nprepare to answer questions, other than\n\n988\n00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,250\ngenerically knowing that there is\na history there, maybe having one or two\n\n989\n00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,205\nexamples of something like a substitution\ncipher as we've just discussed.\n\n990\n00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,680\nWould be a good value point for\nyou just to bring up and\n\n991\n00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,120\nperhaps have in the back of your mind.\n\n992\n00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,330\nTransposition ciphers,\nreordering of the plain text.\n\n993\n00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,260\nWe want to make sure that we\nare thinking about the fact that as we\n\n994\n00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,110\ndo a transposition cipher we are not\ngonna change it but rather reorder it so\n\n995\n00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,230\nit is effectively like a word scramble.\n\n996\n00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,520\nI think that's a game that most of us\nprobably played when we were kids.\n\n997\n00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,208\nYou have that little puzzle square,\nif you remember it,\n\n998\n00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:45,970\nit was maybe a three by three or four by\nfour square in a little border of plastic.\n\n999\n00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,750\nYou would slide the tiles around or\nsomething like that.\n\n1000\n00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,590\nBoggle as a game is\na good example of that,\n\n1001\n00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,770\nif you've ever played Boggle,\nwhere you shake the tiles around.\n\n1002\n00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:59,570\nScrabble could be a good example of that,\ndepending on how you play scrabble, right.\n\n1003\n00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,490\nSo those kind of things\nare things to think about.\n\n1004\n00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:04,993\nSomething like that, as Don's doing\non the screen right there, right,\n\n1005\n00:50:04,993 --> 00:50:09,180\ndictionary becomes idactasaurus or\nwhatever he put on there.\n\n1006\n00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,910\nSo, exactly.\n\n1007\n00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:14,017\nSo the idea would be that the cipher\ntext and the plain text are gonna\n\n1008\n00:50:14,017 --> 00:50:18,570\nbe reordered around some sort of thought\nprocess to then transpose them and\n\n1009\n00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:23,460\nbecause of that, we then are shifting the\nmeaning, but we're not really changing it,\n\n1010\n00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,890\nwe're just simply randomizing the letters.\n\n1011\n00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,965\nSo that's what we call\na transposition cipher, again.\n\n1012\n00:50:28,965 --> 00:50:30,785\n>> And there's normally\nsome kind of pattern to it.\n\n1013\n00:50:30,785 --> 00:50:34,225\nAnd, and that's what I tried to do\nhere is, I just took in pairs, and\n\n1014\n00:50:34,225 --> 00:50:35,465\nreversed the letters.\n\n1015\n00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,495\nSo DI became ID.\n\n1016\n00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:38,155\n>> Okay.\n\n1017\n00:50:39,715 --> 00:50:41,560\n>> NA became AN, and so on.\n\n1018\n00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,220\nSo the person on the other end would\nobviously need to know that pattern so\n\n1019\n00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,030\nthey could quickly reverse\nit back otherwise-\n\n1020\n00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:46,960\n>> That takes all the fun out of it,\n\n1021\n00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,640\nif you tell them the pattern,\nthey have nothing to do, right?\n\n1022\n00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,510\n>> I guess if it was like\na prison communication, and\n\n1023\n00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,030\nthey needed something to pass the time.\n\n1024\n00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,240\n>> Right.\nMaybe, right, exactly.\n\n1025\n00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,520\nMaybe that would be important, right?\n\n1026\n00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,115\nSo typically, as I mentioned,\n\n1027\n00:50:57,115 --> 00:51:00,250\nwhen I was referring to a little game that\nyou may have used when you were a kid.\n\n1028\n00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,310\nThese things are actually typically\nlaid out in grids more often then not.\n\n1029\n00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,340\nSo you would see a table of some kind,\nmaybe a five by five table where we would\n\n1030\n00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,640\nlay it out and then scramble, write out\nthe plain text in the grid going this way.\n\n1031\n00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,044\nAnd then we would move it around and\nscramble it and then you,\n\n1032\n00:51:14,044 --> 00:51:18,120\nas you pointed out rightly, would have to\ntranslate that pattern, whatever was used\n\n1033\n00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,900\nto do the scrambling, to the recipient so\nthey could in effect unscramble that.\n\n1034\n00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:28,650\nWe also have, aside from the ciphers,\nwe also have things like a one time pad,\n\n1035\n00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:32,070\nwhich we'll talk a bit more about\nlater on in one of our other episodes.\n\n1036\n00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,260\nBut probably worth mentioning here.\n\n1037\n00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:38,590\nAs an example of probably the only\nunbreakable crypto system\n\n1038\n00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,650\nthat has existed and does exist today.\n\n1039\n00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:45,375\nAnd is seen by experts as being truly,\nif it's implemented properly,\n\n1040\n00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:50,550\none of the only, not one of the only,\nthe only unbreakable system that exists.\n\n1041\n00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,390\nThis concept is fairly\nstraightforward forward,\n\n1042\n00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,640\nit's been used a lot throughout time.\n\n1043\n00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,100\nIt was used during the second World War\nextensively, for instance, to send or\n\n1044\n00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,340\nreceive messages both for\nour side, for the allies,\n\n1045\n00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:08,210\nand by the people that we were fighting,\nby the Axis powers.\n\n1046\n00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:13,260\nAnd the idea is that you write down\na series of one time codes, literally,\n\n1047\n00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,860\non typically a pad.\n\n1048\n00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,570\nAnd as a result of that,\nthe pad has to be synchronized.\n\n1049\n00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:22,260\nBoth parties, the sender and the\nrecipient, have to have copies of the one\n\n1050\n00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,490\ntime set of codes in sequence and\nunderstand how to use them in sequence so\n\n1051\n00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:30,830\nthey can obviously send and receive\nthe same message with the same key.\n\n1052\n00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:35,550\nAnd as a result of that if it's truly done\nthat way, if it's only a one time use and\n\n1053\n00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:38,120\nthen the code is destroyed and\nnot used again, so\n\n1054\n00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,300\nthere can be no reuse in other words.\n\n1055\n00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:46,130\nAnd the paths are securely transmitted\nto both parties and not uncovered.\n\n1056\n00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:51,390\nThen there's no way to discern a pattern,\nand no way to break this encryption.\n\n1057\n00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,610\nSo this is why it is considered to be\nthe only unbreakable encryption or crypto\n\n1058\n00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,690\nsystem that currently exists because\nthere's no way to discern the pattern.\n\n1059\n00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,810\nBecause by the time you\nfigure out a pattern,\n\n1060\n00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,060\nthat code is no longer used, right.\n\n1061\n00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,930\nSo there's absolutely no way to\nunderstand what the message was.\n\n1062\n00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,640\n>> And these were in the news not\ntoo long, a couple of weeks ago.\n\n1063\n00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,580\nYou hear about it from time\nto time where a message\n\n1064\n00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,020\nwill turn up that was\na World War 2 era message.\n\n1065\n00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:19,180\nThis was one was a message that had\nbeen attached to a carrier pigeon and\n\n1066\n00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,740\nthey found it and it had been\nencrypted using a one time pad.\n\n1067\n00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,622\nAnd basically the cryptologist looked at\nit and said there's no point in working on\n\n1068\n00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:30,900\nit, unless we have that pad there's\nno way to determine what this is.\n\n1069\n00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:36,596\n>> Did they interrogate the pigeon\nto see if the pigeon knew?\n\n1070\n00:53:36,596 --> 00:53:37,328\nNo they didn't do that.\n>> I was curious that they found it.\n\n1071\n00:53:37,328 --> 00:53:38,616\nDid they find the skeleton [CROSSTALK]?\n\n1072\n00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:42,040\n>> Just how old was that pigeon?\n\n1073\n00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,680\nRight?\n>> Yeah apparently they found the tube,\n\n1074\n00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,090\nand there was a message in it.\n\n1075\n00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:46,840\nWho knows what it said?\n\n1076\n00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,880\nMaybe it says do you want to eat for\nlunch or something?\n\n1077\n00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,080\nWe don't know.\n>> Maybe we're having pigeon for lunch.\n\n1078\n00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,670\n>> There you go [LAUGH] it's\nthe first to go orders.\n\n1079\n00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:56,250\n>> Right [LAUGH] so you never know.\n\n1080\n00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,370\nBut that's actually a good\nanecdotal story, right.\n\n1081\n00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,600\nSo these things do pop\nup from time to time.\n\n1082\n00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:05,430\nBut it is important for you to have\na sense of the fact that a one time pad,\n\n1083\n00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,840\nit's use and then the way it is set up and\nwhat it means is important for\n\n1084\n00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,710\nyou as a reference point,\n\n1085\n00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:14,710\nas a knowledge point as you look\nto move through the SSCP material.\n\n1086\n00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,580\nSo do be aware of it.\n\n1087\n00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,110\nYou hear it referred to every so\noften and it is considered, as we said,\n\n1088\n00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:21,560\nthe only unbreakable encryption system.\n\n1089\n00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,180\nAll right, very good.\n\n1090\n00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:29,450\nSo I think, having said that we may\nwant to think about doing a pause here.\n\n1091\n00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,410\nWrapping up and\nthen maybe we'll go ahead and\n\n1092\n00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:35,580\nmove into our discussion around algorithm\ntype symmetric, asymmetric strengths and\n\n1093\n00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,470\nweaknesses in our next episode.\n\n1094\n00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,320\n>> Yeah if you guys thought the dictionary\nattack from the last segment was great,\n\n1095\n00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,240\nwait until you see this.\n\n1096\n00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,380\nWe got a ton of different ciphers to talk\nabout and it's really interesting stuff.\n\n1097\n00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,710\nThis is usually the most fun\npart of studying for the SSCPs.\n\n1098\n00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,292\n>> That's absolutely correct.\n\n1099\n00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:52,324\n>> All right, let's stop here and\ntake a pause, when we get back,\n\n1100\n00:54:52,324 --> 00:54:53,792\nmore cipher stuff after this.\n\n1101\n00:54:53,792 --> 00:55:00,572\n[MUSIC]\n\n1102\n00:55:00,572 --> 00:55:03,540\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1103\n00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,170\nSo now what we're gonna do is we're gonna\njump into some of the different ciphers\n\n1104\n00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:06,890\nthat are out there.\n\n1105\n00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:10,920\nAnd really get a chance to see, not just\nhistorical, cuz that's nice to know, but\n\n1106\n00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,710\nnow we get to see a little\nbit more practical.\n\n1107\n00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:16,125\nWhat we're actually gonna be using out\nthere in what I like to call the real\n\n1108\n00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:17,680\nworld, the responsible world.\n\n1109\n00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,184\n>> In the real world,\nthe world outside of TV world.\n\n1110\n00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:24,642\nSo let's talk a bit about symmetric and\nasymmetric key cryptography.\n\n1111\n00:55:24,642 --> 00:55:27,184\nThis is obviously gonna\nbe very important for us.\n\n1112\n00:55:27,184 --> 00:55:30,531\nthis really takes the next level down\nfrom what we did with stream and block,\n\n1113\n00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:34,240\nand brings them into this idea of how\nwe approach managing the algorithms.\n\n1114\n00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,930\nThat's specifically the keys\nin the key distribution\n\n1115\n00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,020\nthat the algorithms represent for\nus inside the crypto system.\n\n1116\n00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,200\nSo we'll start with symmetric key.\n\n1117\n00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,330\nYou've got some notes up there.\n\n1118\n00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,249\nI wanna walk you through them and\nthen we'll go and\n\n1119\n00:55:45,249 --> 00:55:48,643\ntake a look at some of the visuals that\nwe've created how all this comes to life.\n\n1120\n00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:53,263\nSo with symmetric key, we're talking\nabout what's called a single key or\n\n1121\n00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:55,184\nsame key or secret key system.\n\n1122\n00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:59,282\nThey're all basically used as the same\nterminology to refer To symmetric key,\n\n1123\n00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:03,381\njust often hear these terms when you read\nthrough literature, and read through\n\n1124\n00:56:03,381 --> 00:56:07,320\ndocumentation on these systems you\nwill hear these different things.\n\n1125\n00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,960\nBut they all refer to symmetric key.\n\n1126\n00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,330\nWhat I would often think of, what I often\ntell my students to think about when I'm\n\n1127\n00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:19,760\ntalking to them about this kind of stuff\nis symmetric, same, SS as a mnemonic or\n\n1128\n00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,860\na memory device to figure out how to\nremember that it's a single key system.\n\n1129\n00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,450\nSo just think about that but\nit is gonna use a single key.\n\n1130\n00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:29,140\nThat key is referred to as a private key.\n\n1131\n00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,950\nSo it will be the private\nkey of the sender.\n\n1132\n00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,160\nThe person that initiates\nthe message transfer.\n\n1133\n00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,660\nWe'll see this in the visual\nin just a minute.\n\n1134\n00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,390\nThat we're gonna use and we're gonna have\nto figure out how to get that key over.\n\n1135\n00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,730\nTo the recipient, which is why we\nhave a note there on same key use for\n\n1136\n00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:45,470\nencryption and decryption.\n\n1137\n00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:49,930\nSo one of the key challenges, that's\nprobably a little unintended pun, one of\n\n1138\n00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:55,130\nthe challenges, right, of a symmetric\nkey solution is being able to transfer\n\n1139\n00:56:55,130 --> 00:57:00,390\nthe keys successfully and securely\nbetween the sender and the recipient.\n\n1140\n00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:06,600\nI had a friend years ago that did\nthis kind of work for the military.\n\n1141\n00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:14,700\nAnd so basically what he did was he\nwould transfer secure launch codes and\n\n1142\n00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:19,410\nkeys for the launch codes for the nuclear\nmissile systems out in the midwest.\n\n1143\n00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:23,240\nAnd so basically what would happen\nis he would be put, he'd go and\n\n1144\n00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,270\nshow up at a base or wherever they were to\nget the keys and whatever he had to do.\n\n1145\n00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:32,508\nThey would strap the keys to his arm,\nliterally like you see in the movies with\n\n1146\n00:57:32,508 --> 00:57:37,300\na briefcase, with the handcuffs because\nthese were on master tapes, these big,\n\n1147\n00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,210\nhuge quarter inch or half inch tape reels,\nand so he would have that information.\n\n1148\n00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:45,350\nHe would have it put into a briefcase,\nit will be locked to his arm, he'd have\n\n1149\n00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:50,440\na bunch of really big, heavy, burly\nguys with sunglasses and bulges right\n\n1150\n00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,190\nhere surrounding him in cars, and they'd\nthrow him in the back of a car, and they\n\n1151\n00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:59,160\nwould drive him from point to point where\nthey had to go to drop these keys off.\n\n1152\n00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,410\nAnd the only way you could securely\ntransfer these keys was to have\n\n1153\n00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:09,070\nthe copy that he was carrying,\nbeing moved securely under guard,\n\n1154\n00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,640\narmed guard right, to the actual site.\n\n1155\n00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,920\nBecause if you transmitted\nthem electronically,\n\n1156\n00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,410\npotentially somebody could interdict\nright, could intercept them.\n\n1157\n00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,460\nAnd as a result,\nthe keys would now become compromised.\n\n1158\n00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,580\nAnd so literally,\nthey did it the old fashioned way, right?\n\n1159\n00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,720\nThey put the guy in the car with\nthe briefcase chained to the guy's arm.\n\n1160\n00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,370\nAnd they surrounded the guy to make\nsure that the keys would show up.\n\n1161\n00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:31,920\nSo this is the kind of security that\nwe have to think about implementing\n\n1162\n00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,760\nwhen we talk about\ntransferring keys this way.\n\n1163\n00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,900\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1164\n00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,410\nI'm not suggesting you have to do\nthat to use symmetric key encryption.\n\n1165\n00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,290\nThat is an extreme example, but\n\n1166\n00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:44,160\nit's one that actually does\nhappen in the real world.\n\n1167\n00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,910\nWe're gonna come up with a better way to\ndo that in a little while when we talk\n\n1168\n00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:51,220\nabout a hybrid system that will blend both\nsymmetric and asymmetric together, and\n\n1169\n00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,850\nuse the best parts of both to be\nable to do secure key transfer, but\n\n1170\n00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,100\nalso encrypt with that secure key.\n\n1171\n00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,460\nSo, effectively creating a solution\nthat solves all the problems we have.\n\n1172\n00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,710\nBy using one or the other individually.\n\n1173\n00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,630\n>> Imagine if we tried to apply\nsomething like this with amazon.com.\n\n1174\n00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,490\nIf you want to buy something from amazon,\n\n1175\n00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:13,600\nthe first time you got to drive to their\nheadquarters and give them the key.\n\n1176\n00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,730\n>> So Amazon 2.0 for that.\n\n1177\n00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,440\nThat's what it's gonna be.\n\n1178\n00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,210\nThat's the original one.\n\n1179\n00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,390\nSo I got a better one for you.\n\n1180\n00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:22,372\nSo Amazon 2.0 you're going to\nhave to drive to get the key.\n\n1181\n00:59:22,372 --> 00:59:27,968\nWe're gonna send it out to you using a,\nyou know, little drone copter, right?\n\n1182\n00:59:27,968 --> 00:59:30,480\nAnd we're gonna drop it off\nright there for you and\n\n1183\n00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,040\nit's going to be secure,\nbeacause that's what we're seeing right?\n\n1184\n00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,120\nI mean if guys doing ice fishing out in\nMinnesota on lakes, they are using it to\n\n1185\n00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,520\ndeliver beer, then we obviously\ncan use it to deliver keys, right?\n\n1186\n00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,480\nYou've just got to think about that, so.\n\n1187\n00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,080\nYou know,\nmodern technology being applied, right.\n\n1188\n00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,580\nIn a backwards, backwards kind of way,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1189\n00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,850\n>> To achieve the end result.\n\n1190\n00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:49,970\nSo just think about that.\n\n1191\n00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:51,480\nThat's what we're going to see next.\n\n1192\n00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,170\nAlright, so symmetric keys, right?\n\n1193\n00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,050\nVery important to be\nthinking about these things.\n\n1194\n00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,630\nIt is known as, or symmetric key\ncryptography is referred to as,\n\n1195\n00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,670\nbeing the fastest encryption technique.\n\n1196\n01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,660\nMeaning, when we look at it in comparison,\n\n1197\n01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:06,580\nasymmetric, it is gonna operate much\nfaster, because there's only one key.\n\n1198\n01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:11,250\nAnd as a result, we encrypt only one time,\nand decrypt one time, using one key and\n\n1199\n01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:15,130\nwe don't have to worry about the fact that\nwe'll have to bring a key pair together\n\n1200\n01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:19,250\nas we will with asymmetric in a minute\nin order to talk about that, and\n\n1201\n01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:22,830\nthen use those keys together\nto do the encrypt/decrypt.\n\n1202\n01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,750\nYou remember the Wonder Twins on the\nJustice League of America when you were\n\n1203\n01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:26,920\na kid, in that cartoon?\n\n1204\n01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,690\n>> Wonder Twin powers unite.\n\n1205\n01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:28,940\n>> Wonder Twin powers activate.\n\n1206\n01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,440\nRight, so the asymmetric is those\npowers coming together, the public and\n\n1207\n01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,550\nthe private key, but\nthe symmetric ia the single key, and so\n\n1208\n01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:36,300\nthat's what we want to know.\n\n1209\n01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,630\nThat reference may have been\na little not old school enough, or\n\n1210\n01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,570\nmaybe too old school,\ndepending on how old you are.\n\n1211\n01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:44,820\n>> So you combine the two certificates,\nand they turn into a bucket of water.\n\n1212\n01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,100\n>> Form of, shape of.\n\n1213\n01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Remember Gleek the monkey\n\n1214\n01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,300\nthat would run around with them?\n\n1215\n01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,505\nI'm dating myself here.\n\n1216\n01:00:50,505 --> 01:00:51,380\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> All right.\n\n1217\n01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,470\nSo blocks, right.\n\n1218\n01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:53,100\nWhat we're talking about?\n\n1219\n01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,730\nWe talk about symmetric key cryptography.\n\n1220\n01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,730\nWe talked about block and\nstream ciphers or block and\n\n1221\n01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,570\nstream algorithms that are used.\n\n1222\n01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,420\nWe gave you an example\nof some of these here.\n\n1223\n01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,150\nYou're gonna wanna know what these are,\n\n1224\n01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:07,750\nknow the big key strength that is listed\nfor the ones we've listed for you.\n\n1225\n01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:10,390\nThese will be knowledge points for\nyou to master and\n\n1226\n01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:13,020\nbe aware of as you prepare\nto answer some questions.\n\n1227\n01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:17,670\nSo looking at DES, by the way, DES is\njust pronounced generically as DES, for\n\n1228\n01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:21,200\nthe data encryption standard, that's the\nname of the algorithm, it is initially,\n\n1229\n01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,140\nwhen it's implemented,\nit's just single desk, a 56 bit key.\n\n1230\n01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,494\nWhen We do triple DES, so\nthat's DES times three,\n\n1231\n01:01:28,494 --> 01:01:32,582\nwe multiply the 56-bit key by three,\nwe get 168-bit.\n\n1232\n01:01:32,582 --> 01:01:35,095\nIf you do double DES,\nwe didn't put it on the list, but\n\n1233\n01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:39,965\ntwo DES would simply be 56-bit times\ntwo which is gonna be 112 right so\n\n1234\n01:01:39,965 --> 01:01:41,970\nyou can just do the math there quickly.\n\n1235\n01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:45,740\nAES, which is what is now\nreplacing DES as the standard for\n\n1236\n01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:50,410\nthe federal government that is being used\nbecause DES has been in the market so\n\n1237\n01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:54,350\nlong and is old enough that it's\napproaching the end of its useful life.\n\n1238\n01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:57,350\nOur computing computational\npowers are now being able to\n\n1239\n01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,140\nrender DES basically ineffective.\n\n1240\n01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:03,900\nWe can break DES encryption, and so\nas a result, the AES has replaced it.\n\n1241\n01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:08,420\nEither 128 or 256 bit solution depending\non how the key is actually implemented,\n\n1242\n01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,600\nhow you implement the algorithm.\n\n1243\n01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:15,093\nIdea is 128 bit key,\nthe RC series, RC five and\n\n1244\n01:02:15,093 --> 01:02:20,160\nsix specifically, are block ciphers.They\nare variable key sizes anywhere\n\n1245\n01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,080\nfrom 64 to 256 bit keys.Again,\ndepending on how implementation is done.\n\n1246\n01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,680\nThe stream version of RC, the RC4,\n\n1247\n01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,040\nis considered a stream as\nopposed to a block cipher.\n\n1248\n01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,170\nAgain, based on implementation and\nthe way it is being done.\n\n1249\n01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:37,290\nAlright, why don't we take a look\nat the diagram we've put together,\n\n1250\n01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,620\nthe visual that we have?\n\n1251\n01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:39,710\nFor symmetric.\n\n1252\n01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,550\nNow let's just quickly walk\nthrough this with everybody.\n\n1253\n01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,870\nMake sure everybody is comfortable and\njust has a visual on this.\n\n1254\n01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:48,030\nSo on the left we see the sender and\n\n1255\n01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,030\nwe see the sender is going to\nstart out with some plain text.\n\n1256\n01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:54,780\nThey are going to run\nthrough an encryption cycle.\n\n1257\n01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,220\nBring any of those algorithms\nin we just talked about.\n\n1258\n01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,680\nWhether it was DES,\nDouble DES, Triple DES, AES,\n\n1259\n01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,750\nIDEA, whatever it may be,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n1260\n01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:07,170\nWe have the sender's private key\nbeing applied to the encryption\n\n1261\n01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:08,380\nsolution of the plaintext.\n\n1262\n01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:13,020\nIn other words the cryptosystem that\nis being used to encrypt the data\n\n1263\n01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,340\nis going to use the sender's private key.\n\n1264\n01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:18,340\nWe output cypher text\non the far side there.\n\n1265\n01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:22,320\nAnd that cypher text has now\neffectively been rendered secure.\n\n1266\n01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,324\nAt least we hope it's been\nrendered secure, right.\n\n1267\n01:03:24,324 --> 01:03:28,472\n[LAUGH] But the trick here is now we\nhave the sender's private key that is on\n\n1268\n01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:32,620\nthe left hand side, and notice it's\nduplicated on the right hand side of\n\n1269\n01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:37,244\nthe diagram, but as we're gonna draw\na little line or somehow just indicate, we\n\n1270\n01:03:37,244 --> 01:03:41,664\nhave to now be able to securely transfer\nthat key, because it is the same key,\n\n1271\n01:03:41,664 --> 01:03:45,023\nfrom where it is on the left over\nto where it is on the right.\n\n1272\n01:03:45,023 --> 01:03:49,482\nAnd so the successful transference of\nthat key, to be able to take that key and\n\n1273\n01:03:49,482 --> 01:03:53,602\nsecurely transfer it Means the difference\nbetween success and failure\n\n1274\n01:03:53,602 --> 01:03:57,924\nwhen we look at unencrypting the data on\nthe far side and so the orange dotted\n\n1275\n01:03:57,924 --> 01:04:03,220\nline that's coming over represents secure\ntransfer of the sender's private key.\n\n1276\n01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:08,780\nNow again, it could be done by many\nmechanisms, physical transference, right?\n\n1277\n01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:12,030\nWe could call somebody verbally,\nrepresent the key to them, but you know,\n\n1278\n01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,610\nthere are issues associated with that.\n\n1279\n01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:17,860\nSomebody may overhear it, maybe somebody\ntransposes a few of the bits in the key,\n\n1280\n01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,450\nbecause these keys can be very long,\nas we indicated.\n\n1281\n01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:23,710\nAnd as a result, maybe they don't\nget the key sequencing correct.\n\n1282\n01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:26,270\nSo there are issues we have to\nthink about and address there.\n\n1283\n01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:29,070\nBut having said that,\nthe cipher text comes across.\n\n1284\n01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,110\nWe have a copy of\nthe sender's private key.\n\n1285\n01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,120\nAssuming that private key has\nbeen transmitted successfully\n\n1286\n01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,650\nwe can use it to effectively run\nthe cryptosystem in reverse.\n\n1287\n01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:43,740\nDecrypting the private key will allow us\nto decrypt the ciphertext and then output\n\n1288\n01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:48,570\nthe same plain text on the far side that\nwas sent into the system by the sender.\n\n1289\n01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,010\nAssuming again nothing has been modified.\n\n1290\n01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:54,240\nNow this particular solution,\nremember we're focusing on\n\n1291\n01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,480\nthe idea of using confidentiality in\nour system to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n1292\n01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,700\nWe're not focusing on the integrity\nof the data, we don't know if that\n\n1293\n01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:08,070\nplain text that was entered in the system\non the left is the same plain text that is\n\n1294\n01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:11,820\noutputted on the right just\nby doing an encrypt decrypt.\n\n1295\n01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:15,510\nIn other words, this data could've been\nmodified in transit, and we don't know.\n\n1296\n01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,050\nRight?\nSo we're gonna talk about how to deal with\n\n1297\n01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,370\nthat in another episode.\n\n1298\n01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:22,720\nI'm just pointing out to you that right\nnow we are focused solely on the idea of\n\n1299\n01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:28,050\nthe use of cryptography to enhance and\ncreate confidentiality of information.\n\n1300\n01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:32,350\nAnd this is what symmetric and ultimately\nasymmetric encryption helps us to do.\n\n1301\n01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:35,810\nSo this is the visual for\nthe symmetric solution.\n\n1302\n01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:40,120\nSingle key, sender's private key\nbeing used on both sides, right?\n\n1303\n01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,240\nWhen we come back and talk about\nasymmetric encryption, as we said,\n\n1304\n01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,410\nwe're talking about our\npublic private key.\n\n1305\n01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,120\nSo let's go back to our notes and\n\n1306\n01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:51,580\nlet's just throw some ideas up\nthere quickly on asymmetric.\n\n1307\n01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,260\nAnd then we'll come back and take a look\nat a graphic on asymmetric, right.\n\n1308\n01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,970\nSo we'll take a look at that as well.\n\n1309\n01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:00,540\nSo we do already have some ideas and some\npoints we wanted to share with you for\n\n1310\n01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,160\nasymmetric key encryption.\n\n1311\n01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,210\nYou will see it is considered\npublic/private key, as opposed to simply\n\n1312\n01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:09,460\nprivate key only, so remember we talked\nand instead of you having the key pair,\n\n1313\n01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:13,170\nright, public key, private key,\nwe link the two together.\n\n1314\n01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:16,990\nAnd by doing that, we form the ability\nto be able to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n1315\n01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:21,000\nWhen we separate the keys, we then have\nthe ability to give one of the keys to\n\n1316\n01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,350\nsomebody, keep the other key for\nourselves, and as a result of that,\n\n1317\n01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:31,190\nas long as we then are able to safely\nsecure one key, transmit another key,\n\n1318\n01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:35,010\nwe're gonna then be able to work through\nthis idea of how we unencrypt and\n\n1319\n01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:36,660\nreencrypt data on demand.\n\n1320\n01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,710\nAnd so we call this a key pair.\n\n1321\n01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:40,760\nAnd so when we talk about\nasymmetric key encryption,\n\n1322\n01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,576\nwe're talking about both public and\nprivate key,\n\n1323\n01:06:43,576 --> 01:06:49,022\n[COUGH] A public key/private key solution\nof an asymmetric key is considered here,\n\n1324\n01:06:49,022 --> 01:06:54,430\ncomputationally infeasible to derive the\nprivate key from the public key solution.\n\n1325\n01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:58,600\nMeaning the way we define an asymmetric\nkey system is through this statement.\n\n1326\n01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:03,260\nIf it is computationally infeasible,\nthe system has been set up in such a way\n\n1327\n01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:07,120\nthat we cannot run the system\nbackwards with one key only, and\n\n1328\n01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,730\nmathematically produce another key.\n\n1329\n01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,540\nIt is said to be an asymmetric key system.\n\n1330\n01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:14,700\nThat is the definition,\nthe defining criteria.\n\n1331\n01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:20,530\nSo examples of asymmetric we gave you\nsome examples of symmetric earlier,\n\n1332\n01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:25,260\nexamples of asymmetric keys,\nRSA or asymmetric algorithms, RSA,\n\n1333\n01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:30,150\nprobably one of the most common and\nwell known ones, the RSA solution, based\n\n1334\n01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:34,945\non the factoring of two two large prime\nnumbers we're not talking about one and\n\n1335\n01:07:34,945 --> 01:07:39,005\nthree here we're talking about some\npretty big multiple places right for\n\n1336\n01:07:39,005 --> 01:07:42,955\nprime numbers so very very large prime\nnumbers but the factoring of the product\n\n1337\n01:07:42,955 --> 01:07:46,340\nof those two prime numbers is\nwhat RSA's algorithm is based on.\n\n1338\n01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:50,985\nDiffie-Hellman another algorithm that\nis used in the asymmetric systems\n\n1339\n01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:54,200\nis used almost exclusively for\nkey exchange We'll come back and\n\n1340\n01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,810\ntake a look at Diffie-Hellman\nagain later in another episode or\n\n1341\n01:07:57,810 --> 01:08:02,320\nin another topical area in the SSEP when\nwe talk more about the networking solution\n\n1342\n01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,970\nand we talk about\nthe implementation of IP Sec.\n\n1343\n01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:05,920\nRight?\nCuz we're gonna use it for\n\n1344\n01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,120\nkey exchange there.\n\n1345\n01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,690\nPotentially and\nat least see the impact of it there.\n\n1346\n01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:13,880\nElliptic curve, another algorithm\nthat can be used that's isometric and\n\n1347\n01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,570\nEl Gamal is also a good example of this,\n\n1348\n01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:19,930\njust another example of algorithms\nthat could be used here.\n\n1349\n01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:25,730\nYou know,\nthe idea with this list of the algorithms\n\n1350\n01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:29,340\nis really not to give you an exhaustive\nlist, we are not working through giving\n\n1351\n01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:34,160\nyou a list that is going to be only those\nalgorithms that are one or the other.\n\n1352\n01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,560\nWe're just offering you some and\nasking you to think about those as being\n\n1353\n01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,470\nthe primary ones we see, but\nto do your due diligence, right.\n\n1354\n01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:43,640\nGo out and research, and\nunderstand there are many, many others.\n\n1355\n01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,110\nYou may find other algorithms\non other lists, and\n\n1356\n01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:48,260\nthose lists are equally valuable to you.\n\n1357\n01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,030\nBut there are many of these.\n\n1358\n01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:52,220\nThese are just some of the most common\nones that we're offering you samples of.\n\n1359\n01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,450\nSo I think we're gonna take a look, or\n\n1360\n01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:56,510\nwe'd like to take a look,\nat the asymmetric key solution.\n\n1361\n01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:02,290\nAnd so\nwhen we focus on our asymmetric system,\n\n1362\n01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,030\njust as we go through and\nwe diagram it out,\n\n1363\n01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:09,330\nnotice it looks almost identical to\nthe one we just looked at for symmetric.\n\n1364\n01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:11,120\nIf we were not looking carefully,\n\n1365\n01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,170\nwe might actually not catch\nthe fact that it is different.\n\n1366\n01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:19,010\nBecause the physicality, the layout and\nthe labeling of this is identical with\n\n1367\n01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:21,840\none exception,\nwhich is the labeling of the keys.\n\n1368\n01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,930\nAnd so down below we will see the public\nkey of the receiver is used by\n\n1369\n01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:29,010\nthe sender to initialize the transfer\n\n1370\n01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:32,580\nof the data from plain text to\nciphertext by encrypting it.\n\n1371\n01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,010\nAnd then on the far side,\n\n1372\n01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:37,120\nthe private key of the receiver is\nbeing used to run the decryption.\n\n1373\n01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:42,600\nWhat this allows us to do as the sender,\nis to use a key that is typically\n\n1374\n01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,695\nmade available publicly, through\na cloud more often more often than not.\n\n1375\n01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:49,950\nSo if you think about PGP, Pretty Good\nPrivacy is a commercially available\n\n1376\n01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:52,355\npublic-private key solution today.\n\n1377\n01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,865\nThere are public key servers,\n\n1378\n01:09:53,865 --> 01:09:57,655\nwhat are called PGP key servers\nthat are out there in the cloud.\n\n1379\n01:09:57,655 --> 01:10:01,255\nYou also have what's known as a PGP key\nring, or just generically a key ring,\n\n1380\n01:10:01,255 --> 01:10:05,165\nwhere you keep your keys that you've kind\nof collected that you're using to send\n\n1381\n01:10:05,165 --> 01:10:08,550\ndata to other people, so you don't have\nto constantly go out and download them.\n\n1382\n01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,266\nAnd so the software does all this for you,\n\n1383\n01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:13,220\nthe little application you use\non the front end does this.\n\n1384\n01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:17,520\nSo, as an idea we would download,\nif maybe Don and I were gonna send and\n\n1385\n01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,510\nreceive some information.\n\n1386\n01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:20,260\nDon, do you wanna be the sender or\nreceiver?\n\n1387\n01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,200\n>> I'll be the sender.\n\n1388\n01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,070\n>> You'll be the sender, okay,\nso, Don's gonna be the sender.\n\n1389\n01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:29,520\nIf Don's the sender, then what Don\nhas to do is, Don has to get my key,\n\n1390\n01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:34,900\nmy public key from the Cloud server or\nthe key server, wherever it's published.\n\n1391\n01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,530\nHe has to download that somehow,\nget a copy of that.\n\n1392\n01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:39,990\nOnce he's gotten that,\nhe can then go ahead and\n\n1393\n01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:44,910\ntake his plain text message,\nencrypt it with my public key, and\n\n1394\n01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:48,260\ncan cipher it, so in other words,\ncreate ciphertext out of it.\n\n1395\n01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:50,150\nIt could then send\nthe cypher text over to me.\n\n1396\n01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:53,780\nHe does not have to send me\na copy of the private key,\n\n1397\n01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,180\nbecause the private key belongs to me.\n\n1398\n01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,420\nI already have it.\n\n1399\n01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,610\nI'm using it.\n\n1400\n01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:01,630\nAll Don has to do is make sure I get the\ncypher text in an intact form that I can\n\n1401\n01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:06,960\ndecrypt, and then I'm able to read\nthat message simply by using the pair\n\n1402\n01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,820\npartner of the public key that Don\ndownloaded and I made available to him.\n\n1403\n01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:13,160\nNow, we talked about where\nthe public keys are stored.\n\n1404\n01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,640\nThey're stored in the cloud\ntypically in servers, like with PGP.\n\n1405\n01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,990\nWhere are the private keys stored?\n\n1406\n01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:21,380\nYou know, this is also important for\nus to think about and to be aware of.\n\n1407\n01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:25,250\nIn most modern systems,\nif they are directory based systems,\n\n1408\n01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:29,020\nLDAP based systems,\nwhether they are Microsoft-centric,\n\n1409\n01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:33,750\nwhether they use a generic LDAP\nprovider doesn't really matter.\n\n1410\n01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:38,423\nFor using an LDAP directory then what\nwe're doing is we're storing those private\n\n1411\n01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:42,959\nkeys with the user information in the user\nprofile as part of the creation of that\n\n1412\n01:11:42,959 --> 01:11:45,751\nuser in there inside\nthe directory as an object.\n\n1413\n01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:49,594\nAn object that represents the user, right?\n\n1414\n01:11:49,594 --> 01:11:53,634\nSo this idea of the user having\nproperties, attributes and values.\n\n1415\n01:11:53,634 --> 01:11:57,973\nAnd some of those properties, attributes,\nand values, focusing on the private key\n\n1416\n01:11:57,973 --> 01:12:01,070\nand the key being stored,\nas part of that user profile.\n\n1417\n01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:04,870\nWhich is really just bits of information\nthat are associated with the user and\n\n1418\n01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:07,910\nthe directory,\nis where we find the private key.\n\n1419\n01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:10,830\nSo, as the user logs in,\nwe create the token for\n\n1420\n01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,250\nthe user to authenticate\nthem into the system.\n\n1421\n01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:17,150\nThe private key becomes part of that and\nwe then allow that user to use that\n\n1422\n01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:20,590\nprivate key that's stored in\nthe directory to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n1423\n01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:24,450\nDepending on what they're doing,\nin this case to decrypt.\n\n1424\n01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:28,740\nUnderstand that this is how we move\nthe key, a public key, over to the sender.\n\n1425\n01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:33,110\nThe private key is kept with the receiver,\nand we never expose the private key.\n\n1426\n01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:36,020\nAt least in this system the way it\nis right now we don't expose it.\n\n1427\n01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,630\nWhen we create the hybrid look at these\nsystems we'll talk about the fact that we\n\n1428\n01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:45,600\nthen actually can send the message using\na private key to do the encryption.\n\n1429\n01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,605\nAnd then unencrypt and then use\nthat key to unencrypt the message.\n\n1430\n01:12:48,605 --> 01:12:51,485\nSo, we're gonna be able to do that but\nwe'll take a look at that\n\n1431\n01:12:51,485 --> 01:12:54,145\nas an outcome of having now explained\nboth symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n1432\n01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:56,645\nAll right, very good.\n\n1433\n01:12:56,645 --> 01:12:59,945\nSo we've tackled asymmetric,\nwe've tackled symmetric,\n\n1434\n01:12:59,945 --> 01:13:04,225\nwe've taken a look at the vision,\nthe visual if you will, of both of these.\n\n1435\n01:13:04,225 --> 01:13:06,955\nSo what I wanna ask you to do\nquickly as you're watching us or\n\n1436\n01:13:06,955 --> 01:13:11,060\nperhaps watching this after\nthe fact as we record it for you.\n\n1437\n01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:14,150\nIs I want you to stop for\njust a couple of minutes here before we go\n\n1438\n01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:17,390\non to more information and\nhave you consume more information.\n\n1439\n01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:21,030\nAs you're watching, I want you to go back\nand just quickly review and make sure\n\n1440\n01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:24,460\nyou're comfortable with the differences\nbetween symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n1441\n01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:24,970\nAll right.\n\n1442\n01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:28,010\nJust so that way as we\ncontinue our conversations and\n\n1443\n01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,570\ntalk about how these combine.\n\n1444\n01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:33,960\nYou're very clear on the differences\nbetween what the sender has as a key, and\n\n1445\n01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,830\nwhat the sender will use\nas a key to encrypt.\n\n1446\n01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,190\nAnd what the recipient,\nthe receiver has as a key,\n\n1447\n01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:41,550\nand what they need to use to decrypt.\n\n1448\n01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:44,350\nBecause this is where,\nif you get it right up front.\n\n1449\n01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:47,500\nEverything works, it's flawless,\nyou know it, it's easy.\n\n1450\n01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,990\nIf you are scrambled it's not quite clear.\n\n1451\n01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:52,920\nIt's very difficult to follow the rest\nof the conversations we're going\n\n1452\n01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,000\nto have going forward because you're\nalways looking over you're shoulder going.\n\n1453\n01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,880\nWhich key was it?\n\n1454\n01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,920\nWhat am I doing?\n\n1455\n01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,080\nNot quite sure.\n\n1456\n01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,920\nSo you want to make sure you're\njust comfortable with this concept\n\n1457\n01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,320\nbefore we move on and before we keep\ntalking about anymore material.\n\n1458\n01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,380\nSo just a little knowledge point for\nyou there to think about and\n\n1459\n01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:11,220\njust some guidance for\nyou to make sure you're on target.\n\n1460\n01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:13,660\nVery good.\n\n1461\n01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:15,280\nSo having said that then.\n\n1462\n01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,200\nLet's go back to our notes if we could for\njust a second.\n\n1463\n01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,980\nI just want to make sure we have all\nthe information we want to discuss\n\n1464\n01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:20,990\ncaptured there.\n\n1465\n01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:25,370\nSo probably the best way to think about\nasymmetric, I gave you this little s for\n\n1466\n01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,190\nsame key, s for symmetric.\n\n1467\n01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:27,760\nRight.\n\n1468\n01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,130\nSo when we think about asymmetric key,\nright.\n\n1469\n01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:34,390\nWhat I think of with asymmetric,\nat least how I think of it anyway.\n\n1470\n01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:37,720\nIs, I think of A, and I think of AB.\n\n1471\n01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,230\nFor me it's just,\nmy name is Adam, I think of A.\n\n1472\n01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,560\nI think of AB.\n\n1473\n01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,590\nSo when I think of AB,\nI think of two keys, or two items.\n\n1474\n01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:46,500\nAnd as a result,\nI think a public private key.\n\n1475\n01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,630\nAs opposed to just a single key, which is\ngoing to be the symmetric key solution.\n\n1476\n01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:52,310\nAgain, this may not work for you.\n\n1477\n01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:56,330\nI know it's hokey, but the idea is\njust simply that it's just a mnemonic,\n\n1478\n01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:58,250\nit's a memory device, as we call it.\n\n1479\n01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:02,870\nThat helps you to remember the difference\nbetween symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n1480\n01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:06,970\nIf that doesn't work for\nyou feel free to come up with one.\n\n1481\n01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:09,180\nFeel free to tell us what it is.\n\n1482\n01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,210\nSend it to us in the chat.\n\n1483\n01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:15,830\nSend it to us after the fact and we'll\nbe happy to understand what those are.\n\n1484\n01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:18,480\nAnd I've heard a lot of really\ncreative ones over the years.\n\n1485\n01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,590\nThere are just the two that I happen\nto use because they work for me.\n\n1486\n01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,760\n>> You wanna know my bad one?\n\n1487\n01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,830\n>> Do I have a choice?\n\n1488\n01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:28,710\n>> Some of my mnemonics are good, some\nare bad, some of the viewers who watch my\n\n1489\n01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:31,185\nothers shows know that some of my\nmnemonics are extremly vulgar so\n\n1490\n01:15:31,185 --> 01:15:34,360\nI can't tell them on the air, but\nthis one is actually just bad grammar.\n\n1491\n01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,700\nI do, you know symmetric,\nS, it's the same, right.\n\n1492\n01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,200\n>> Okay.\n>> And then being in the south,\n\n1493\n01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,065\nA, ain't the same.\n\n1494\n01:15:42,065 --> 01:15:45,535\n>> [LAUGH] I wasn't going to go there,\nall right?\n\n1495\n01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:48,790\n[LAUGH] I'm in the south with you but\nI wasn't going to go there but okay,\n\n1496\n01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,740\nsince you brought it out then I\nguess we can do that one too.\n\n1497\n01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,485\nSo you get to take your pick, right?\n\n1498\n01:15:53,485 --> 01:15:55,160\n[LAUGH] You get to take your pick.\n\n1499\n01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,580\nNotice Don's not brave enough\nto write down the second one.\n\n1500\n01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,180\n>> You know what, I'll do it, I'll do it.\n\n1501\n01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,950\n>> I was going to say, so\nwe'll capture that one for posterity.\n\n1502\n01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:02,660\n>> I've never actually written ain't.\nIs that how you write it?\n\n1503\n01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:03,860\n>> That's how you write ain't.\n\n1504\n01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,650\n>> Ain't the same.\n\n1505\n01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,450\n>> Ain't the same.\n\n1506\n01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:07,200\nAll right.\nVery good.\n\n1507\n01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,430\nSo, we got both.\n\n1508\n01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:11,850\nJust some ways hopefully for\n\n1509\n01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:16,980\nyou to keep these straight in your\nhead and to be aware of them.\n\n1510\n01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:17,870\nVery good.\n\n1511\n01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:21,030\nSo, I think that's probably a good place\nfor us to wrap up on this particular\n\n1512\n01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:24,040\nepisode, having dealt with symmetric and\nasymmetric.\n\n1513\n01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,570\nMaking sure we have a good understanding\nof them is going to build the foundation\n\n1514\n01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:31,470\nfor us as we continue to go forward to\nmake sure that we now are going to be able\n\n1515\n01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:35,250\nto talk about as I mentioned the hybrid\nsolution where we combine the two.\n\n1516\n01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:35,960\nPretty interesting.\n\n1517\n01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,485\nWe'll talk about that in a future episode.\n\n1518\n01:16:37,485 --> 01:16:41,345\nSo, we're also going to continue this\ngeneral theme with cryptography.\n\n1519\n01:16:41,345 --> 01:16:45,245\nGo build down through, not just\nasymmetric, symmetric and hybrid, but\n\n1520\n01:16:45,245 --> 01:16:47,850\nwe're going to talk about things\nin upcoming episodes like PKI.\n\n1521\n01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:48,355\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n1522\n01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:51,635\nwe'll go through a whole discussion there\nwith you about certificate services, and\n\n1523\n01:16:51,635 --> 01:16:56,045\ncontinue discussing all the material\nrelated to how we engage in cryptography.\n\n1524\n01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:59,965\nUntil you as an SSCP have\na very good understanding of\n\n1525\n01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:02,320\nall the things you need to be aware of.\n\n1526\n01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,260\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nhope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n1527\n01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,010\nAs

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:36,600\nWelcome back.\n\n6\n00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,770\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,290\nI'm your host Don Pezet today.\n\n8\n00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,650\nOnce again with Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,480\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,230\n>> Good good, howdy everybody.\n\n11\n00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,620\n>> We are excited to be back at\nyou with another episode of SSCPs.\n\n12\n00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,470\nWe continue, we left off, or\nI should say, you and Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,974\n>> Mike 2.0.\n\n14\n00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:55,410\n>> Mike 2.0 left off of last episode.\n\n15\n00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,785\nGlad to have you back by the way.\n\n16\n00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:57,590\n>> [LAUGHTER].\n\n17\n00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,170\nIntroducing several, actually quite a few,\ndifferent cryptographic standards and\n\n18\n00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,420\nalgorithms and all that good stuff and\nwhy stop a good thing?\n\n19\n00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,760\nWe're going to continue\nright where we left off.\n\n20\n00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,470\n>> Absolutely, so we're gonna jump back\nin and what we're gonna do is continue.\n\n21\n00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,850\nWe're actually gonna reach backwards for\njust a couple minutes.\n\n22\n00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,880\nContinue that conversation we were\nhaving around symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n23\n00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,390\nWe're gonna do that from two perspectives.\n\n24\n00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,930\nWe're first gonna go through and\n\n25\n00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,300\nquickly make sure we're clear on the idea\nof how we produce confidentiality\n\n26\n00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,040\nversus integrity when we're\nusing public key algorithms.\n\n27\n00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,300\nSo we want to make sure we understand\nthat with asymmetric systems.\n\n28\n00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,930\nThen we're gonna take a look at that\nhybrid concept that I mentioned at the end\n\n29\n00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,890\nof the last episode where we combined\nsymmetric and asymmetric together.\n\n30\n00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,970\nAnd see what happens there and\n\n31\n00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,792\nall sorts of crazy magic starts\nhappening when we do that.\n\n32\n00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:46,280\nAll right, so I know we've got a little\ngraphic that we put together that we're\n\n33\n00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,920\ngonna throw up on the screen to\nhelp you better understand this,\n\n34\n00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,664\nso if we can put that up.\n\n35\n00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:55,490\nAnd what we'll do is we'll take a look\nat the way in which confidentiality\n\n36\n00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,590\nin an asymmetric public key system\nis gonna be dealt with, and\n\n37\n00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,760\nthe way that integrity or\nnon-repudiation is gonna be dealt with.\n\n38\n00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,280\nProof of origin, in other words, right,\n\n39\n00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,860\nwhen we're talking about\nthat as dealt with.\n\n40\n00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,270\nAnd so,\non the left we see confidentiality.\n\n41\n00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,150\nAnd so what we're trying to make sure\nwe're clear on, and what we're gonna focus\n\n42\n00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,580\non, and I'm gonna ask Don to help me\nwith this, he's been real good about\n\n43\n00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,310\ntrying to draw our attention to\nthings by highlighting, is gonna\n\n44\n00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,050\nbe the area where the keys are locate\ndown at the bottom on each of these.\n\n45\n00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,770\nAnd so, let's start out with,\n\n46\n00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,420\non confidentiality,\nidentifying which keys are being used.\n\n47\n00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,230\nAnd, you'll see we have the public key of\nthe receiver that is doing the initial\n\n48\n00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,840\nencrypt of the plain text data\nto create the ciphertext.\n\n49\n00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,350\nSo, the public key of the receiver.\n\n50\n00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,320\nIn our example last time, when Don, you\nwere the sender and I was the receiver.\n\n51\n00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,200\nAnd so as a result of that, the public\nkey of the receiver being my public key\n\n52\n00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,790\nis being used on the left by Don\nto be able to do the encryption.\n\n53\n00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,800\nAnd then you'll notice on\nthe right in the green circle,\n\n54\n00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,750\nmy private key is being used\nto decrypt the message.\n\n55\n00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,920\nThis is what we wanna\nfocus on confidentiality.\n\n56\n00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,370\nMaking sure we obscure the data,\nwe keep it from prying eyes.\n\n57\n00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,930\nNobody else is able to see it.\n\n58\n00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,790\nSo only Don and I.\n\n59\n00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,610\nDon would be able to see\nit if I sent it to him.\n\n60\n00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,430\nAnd we reverse the order,\nI could see it when he sends it to me.\n\n61\n00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,420\nWe do it this way, but Mike would not be\nable to see it, right, to use the example\n\n62\n00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,320\nthat we're getting in to, because\nobviously he doesn't have the private key,\n\n63\n00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,410\nand as a result would not be able to\ndecrypt the data, unless I gave it to him.\n\n64\n00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,190\nAnd we'll talk about this hybrid\nsolution to do that in a little while.\n\n65\n00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,180\nOn the right hand side what we're gonna\ndo is take a look, in a good color choice\n\n66\n00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,780\nby the way, so we're gonna take a look\nin orange so we can tell the difference.\n\n67\n00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,320\nLet's say look at Integrity here, so\n\n68\n00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,950\nwhat we're focused on here\nis not confidentiality.\n\n69\n00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,670\nBut rather proof of origin.\n\n70\n00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,150\nWho sent the message, right.\n\n71\n00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,330\nSo we want to make sure\nwe have non-repudiation,\n\n72\n00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,180\nis the term we often talk about.\n\n73\n00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,240\nAnd as a result, we want to make sure\nwe have integrity in the system, so\n\n74\n00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,020\nthat we know that in the case of Don being\nthe sender, that when I get the message,\n\n75\n00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,650\nI know it was Don and it wasn't Mike\ntrying to masquerade as Don, cuz you know,\n\n76\n00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,420\nwe have that whole 2.0 thing going on.\n\n77\n00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,780\nWe want to make sure we differentiate and\nwe don't wind up with the wrong person\n\n78\n00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,450\nsending and, as a result,\nme receiving from somebody incorrectly.\n\n79\n00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,740\nSo again, we'll focus on the keys.\n\n80\n00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,000\nAnd so if we look at the sender side\nof the diagram, on the right hand\n\n81\n00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,900\nside of the screen, where we focused on,\nright, proof of origin.\n\n82\n00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,260\nWe see that it is the private key\nof the sender that is being used\n\n83\n00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,040\nin order to encrypt or\nto start off the encryption process.\n\n84\n00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,710\nJuxtapose that, compare that to\nthe left hand side of the other diagram\n\n85\n00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,010\nwhere you see it is the public key of\nthe receiver that is being used in\n\n86\n00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,940\norder to encrypt to the data when\nwe wanna achieve confidentiality.\n\n87\n00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,490\nVery important distinction,\nbecause this is the exact opposite.\n\n88\n00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,590\nWe want to make sure we're aware of that.\n\n89\n00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,150\nSo the private key of\nthe sender is being used\n\n90\n00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,400\nto do the encryption when we're dealing\nwith proof of origin on the right.\n\n91\n00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,290\nAnd then notice that\nthe public key of the sender\n\n92\n00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,430\nis then being used to do the decrypt on\nthe right hand side by the recipient.\n\n93\n00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,090\nThe public key is available to anybody.\n\n94\n00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,950\nAs a result of that, what will happen\nis Don's private key is kept secure.\n\n95\n00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,490\nHe never exposes the key and\n\n96\n00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,720\nthis is one of the misconceptions\npeople sometimes have in this solution.\n\n97\n00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,420\nDon's encrypting with his private key.\n\n98\n00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,420\nOh my god!\n\n99\n00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,110\nThat means I can get his private\nkey when I get the message.\n\n100\n00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,820\nAnd all I have to do is unencrypt\nthe message and I have Don's private key.\n\n101\n00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,145\nNow I can become Don, and\nI can get a mortgage in Don's name.\n\n102\n00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:27,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or do something crazy, right?\n\n103\n00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,570\nNo, we're not going to do that,\nbecause here's the trick, right?\n\n104\n00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,820\nHere's where the magic happens,\nthe sleight of hand.\n\n105\n00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,630\nDon never exposes his private key\nby encrypting the message with it,\n\n106\n00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,910\nbecause Don keeps the private key.\n\n107\n00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,895\nThe fact that the key was used to do\nthe encryption does not expose the key,\n\n108\n00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:50,630\nbecause remember, we talked about\nthe definition of an asymmetric system.\n\n109\n00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,600\nCan we go back to the notes for\njust one second?\n\n110\n00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,060\nWe're gonna come back to this diagram,\njust wanna make another point.\n\n111\n00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,670\nBut I wanna go back to the notes for\njust a second and\n\n112\n00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,570\nI want us to go up to, if we remember\non our other system right there,\n\n113\n00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,380\ncomputationally unfeasible to derive\nthe private key from the public key.\n\n114\n00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,600\nI wanna stress this because,\nthe fact that in an asymmetric system\n\n115\n00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,830\nDon uses his private key\nto encrypt the message and\n\n116\n00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,910\nsend it to me,\nto validate proof of origin.\n\n117\n00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,990\nRight, to prove it was really him.\n\n118\n00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,380\nBeyond reasonable doubt, right?\n\n119\n00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,370\nRealistically we know Mike could've\nsnuck into Don's workspace,\n\n120\n00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,920\nlogged on to Don's computer, pretending\nto be Don, sending the message and\n\n121\n00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,100\nwe really have no way to know for\nsure, unless we layer in\n\n122\n00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,870\nother security systems and measures,\nthat it really is Don, right.\n\n123\n00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,670\nSo we can bring the biometric\nconversation back in here.\n\n124\n00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,790\nWe can bring in the closed-circuit\nTV conversation.\n\n125\n00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,190\nAny of those things we could do.\n\n126\n00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,550\nWe could electrify Don's doorknob\nhandle to his work space, so\n\n127\n00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,450\nMike gets a nasty surprise when\nhe goes to try to come in.\n\n128\n00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,120\nThere's all these things we could do.\n\n129\n00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,650\nBut at the end of the day we have\na reasonable assumption of security,\n\n130\n00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,600\na reasonable assumption of identity\nis what we talk about in a system.\n\n131\n00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,320\nAnd so thinking about this concept\nof computational infeasibility\n\n132\n00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,710\nto derive private keys from public keys,\nwhen we switch back now to our graphic,\n\n133\n00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,970\nright so let's go back to where we were,\nwhen we send a private key,\n\n134\n00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,890\nor excuse me when we use a private\nkey to send on the right hand side.\n\n135\n00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,730\nDon is not exposing the key because\nhe's not sending me the key,\n\n136\n00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,750\nhe's sending me the cipher text\nthat was created with the key.\n\n137\n00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,350\nAnd as a result of that,\nwhat then happens is,\n\n138\n00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,981\nwhen I go to decrypt\nthe message quote unquote,\n\n139\n00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:32,560\nmeaning I go to work the system backwards,\nuse the copy of the public key that\n\n140\n00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,710\ncorresponds to Don's private key, his key\npair, I get that and I pull that down.\n\n141\n00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,690\nAnd so when I do that, I am now\nusing the public key of the sender,\n\n142\n00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,180\nto validate as a match\nto his private key pair.\n\n143\n00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,870\nAnd when I unencrypt the cipher text,\nby rendering it back in plain text,\n\n144\n00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,090\nI see the message.\n\n145\n00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,013\nIt's not because I'm worried about\nmaking sure that we have confidentiality\n\n146\n00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:57,290\nbecause remember.\n\n147\n00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,341\nAnybody can get Don's public key and\nas a result,\n\n148\n00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:05,136\nanybody could decrypt this message, so\nwe're not doing it to keep it secret,\n\n149\n00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:09,810\nwe're doing it to ensure that we have\nproof of origin in the system, right?\n\n150\n00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,090\nWe have this non repudiation, Don can't\nclaim that he didn't send the message,\n\n151\n00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,030\nbecause Don's private key was used.\n\n152\n00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,750\nAnd most reasonable systems,\nthat assumption is the only way that Don's\n\n153\n00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,410\nprivate key could have been used is if\nDon had logged on and sent the message.\n\n154\n00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,270\nBecause Don's private key is tied,\n\n155\n00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,830\nas we talked about in the last episode, to\nhis user account in the directory service.\n\n156\n00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,380\nAnd as a result, we logically assumed,\nthat it was Don that sent the message.\n\n157\n00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,790\nAgain, reasonable assurance of identity.\n\n158\n00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,670\nAre there ways to skirt this system?\n\n159\n00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:43,010\nCan we pretend to be Don and\nthen find out later it wasn't him?\n\n160\n00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,390\nAbsolutely.\n\n161\n00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,080\nBut the idea is that just\nunderstanding the concept,\n\n162\n00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,690\nthe conceptual framework here, is what\nwe are trying to put across to you.\n\n163\n00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,320\nSo, we want to make sure\nwe see the difference here.\n\n164\n00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,410\nVery important based on the focus of the\nsystem whether it is based on as we now\n\n165\n00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,330\nsee back to the split screen.\n\n166\n00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,260\nWhether it is based on the idea\nof the confidentiality.\n\n167\n00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,060\nOr based on this idea of the integrity\napproach that we talked about\n\n168\n00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,650\nwhich is just generically referred to as\neither non-repudiation or proof of origin.\n\n169\n00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,960\nThis is the pivot point.\n\n170\n00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,240\nWe want to make a focus on here,\n\n171\n00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,440\nwhich is to understand the difference\nbetween the keys that are used to send and\n\n172\n00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,410\nthe keys that are used to decrypt or\nreceive at the far end.\n\n173\n00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,230\nVery important as we think through this.\n\n174\n00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,390\nAll right, so\nhaving said that then, right,\n\n175\n00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,250\njust to wrap up this thought process.\n\n176\n00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,660\nRemember, you know, symmetric keys,\nvery fast, single key systems, private,\n\n177\n00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,620\ntypically hardware initiated, and is gonna\nbe seen as being good for bulk encryption.\n\n178\n00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,640\nLarge volumes of data, symmetrically\nencrypted very, very quickly.\n\n179\n00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,900\nWhereas the asymmetric system,\npublic private key encryption, so\n\n180\n00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,630\nwith key pair, much slower by comparison.\n\n181\n00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,370\nTypically not seen as being very good for\n\n182\n00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,370\nbulk encryption rather use traditionally,\nas we're gonna see,\n\n183\n00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,300\nto encrypt keys, and then send the keys\nto do the encryption of the data.\n\n184\n00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,300\nAnd so what we're gonna do is create\na hybrid solution now where we combine\n\n185\n00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,870\nthe two together and take a look at\nhow we do what's called key exchanges\n\n186\n00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,780\nwhere we use the best of both worlds.\n\n187\n00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:15,510\nThe quick lightning fast solution of\na symmetric system where we could do\n\n188\n00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:22,020\nvery very large bulk encryption solutions\nquickly as well as using the slower but\n\n189\n00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,420\nmuch more secure asymmetric\nsolution to do the key exchange, so\n\n190\n00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,250\nwe can effectively bulk encrypt\nwith the sender's private key.\n\n191\n00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,850\nWe then can asymmetrically encrypt\nthat private key for a key exchange.\n\n192\n00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,520\nWe can then unencrypt\nthe private key on the far side.\n\n193\n00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,400\nAnd then, as a result of that,\nuse the private key to unencrypt the data.\n\n194\n00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,160\nAnd so that's roughly what we're gonna\ntake a look at and what we're gonna do.\n\n195\n00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,290\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n196\n00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,400\nwe're gonna run through a diagram\nthat will help us to understand that\n\n197\n00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,830\ncuz you know, just hearing it once\nmay not really make a lot of sense.\n\n198\n00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,200\nAnd so we want to make sure\nwe understand that, and\n\n199\n00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,540\nobviously we have a sense\nof how this is gonna work.\n\n200\n00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,580\nSo the symmetric key algorithms for\nthe bulk data encryption,\n\n201\n00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,110\nthe asymmetric key algorithms to\ndo the automated key distribution,\n\n202\n00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,030\nis what we're gonna take a long at and\nreally go through here.\n\n203\n00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,210\nSo we should have our diagram up here\nwe're just gonna be losing the edge of\n\n204\n00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,430\nthe key right there I think\nwe're good with that we're good.\n\n205\n00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,920\nSee me kind of splinting off to the sides\nmake sure the split view I can see\n\n206\n00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,800\nthe edge of the diagram.\n\n207\n00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,712\nMake sure it's good.\n\n208\n00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:27,650\nAll right so on the left we have sender,\nagain, typical.\n\n209\n00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,290\n>> I can't leave well enough alone.\n\n210\n00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,040\n>> I was going to say it's fine,\nyou just don't have to touch it.\n\n211\n00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,120\n>> There we go.\n>> So he's away cam,\n\n212\n00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,291\nhe's away from the keyboard.\n\n213\n00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,912\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> We see them, put them up.\n\n214\n00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:38,800\nAll right so we have sender on the left.\n\n215\n00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,080\nIn all of our diagrams this\nis how we set it start out.\n\n216\n00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,860\nSo sender on the left.\n\n217\n00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,130\nYou'll see Plaintext, Encrypt,\nCiphertext up at the top.\n\n218\n00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,540\nThat's pretty standard at this point,\n\n219\n00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,960\nhopefully you're able to track\nthrough that really with no trouble.\n\n220\n00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,460\nAnd so what we see down at the bottom\n\n221\n00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,090\nis another area that we've added\ninto this diagram if you will.\n\n222\n00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,810\nWe're gonna Encrypt the message\nwith the Symmetric Key and\n\n223\n00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,320\nthen use the receiver's public key to\nEncrypt and send the Symmetric key.\n\n224\n00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,220\nAnd so the Symmetric key remember\nis the private key, the same key.\n\n225\n00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,990\nAnd so\nwhat we're gonna do is the following,\n\n226\n00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,400\nwe're gonna take our Private key,\nthe sender's private key,\n\n227\n00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,470\nwhich is the Symmetric key,\nwe're gonna Encrypt the data.\n\n228\n00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,670\nThat's the first top tier and middle tier\nof the diagram on the left-hand side.\n\n229\n00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:28,760\nSo the top two thirds of that diagram\ninvolves using the sender's private key,\n\n230\n00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,890\ntheir Symmetric key, to do the first\npass at the bulk encryption of the data.\n\n231\n00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,940\nThat's what we're seeing\nup top right there, right?\n\n232\n00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,400\nAnd so then, once that data has been\nencrypted and we have Ciphertext.\n\n233\n00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,340\nWhat we then are gonna do is,\nwe're gonna take that key, as you can see.\n\n234\n00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,780\nAnd we wanna show the green arrow,\nwhich Don has put on the screen,\n\n235\n00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,200\ncoming down from the Symmetric key.\n\n236\n00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,880\nYou can see it right there.\n\n237\n00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,000\nHe's kinda circling around\nit as we're talking.\n\n238\n00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,690\nAnd we're gonna take that and\nwe're gonna Encrypt that key.\n\n239\n00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,680\nNow we're gonna use,\nas you notice on the left in the circle,\n\n240\n00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,010\nlooks more like a mound or maybe almost\nlike a Winnie the Pooh honey hive or\n\n241\n00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,890\nsomething, but in that generic shape\noff to the left, whatever that is.\n\n242\n00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,950\nWe see the Receiver's Public Key\nis gonna be used, and\n\n243\n00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,090\nthat Receiver's Public Key is\ngonna be encrypted, right?\n\n244\n00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,725\nAs you can see there, right?\n\n245\n00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:25,710\n[COUGH] So what we're doing is, or excuse\nme, is gonna be used I should say to do\n\n246\n00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:31,750\nthe encryption pardon me, of the symmetric\nof the sender's private key.\n\n247\n00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,930\nAnd so what we're doing is we're taking\nthe sender's private key that's encrypted\n\n248\n00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,280\nthe data, and we're encrypting that\nkey with the recipient's public key.\n\n249\n00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,659\nAnd if you stop here for just a second and\nthink about the logic of this.\n\n250\n00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,910\nWhat this actually winds up meaning for\nus, is that the only way\n\n251\n00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,840\nthat the sender's private key can be\nunencrypted to unencrypt the data,\n\n252\n00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,380\nwill be if the recipients,\nthe receiver's private key\n\n253\n00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,400\nis used to unencrypt the symmetric\nkey to then unencrypt the data.\n\n254\n00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,650\nAnd so, again, we have a reasonable\nassumption of security.\n\n255\n00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,770\nIn a model like this we reasonably\nassume that the only person\n\n256\n00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,610\nthat could wield the consumer's\nprivate key in a secure system is\n\n257\n00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,480\nthe recipient based on logging in,\nauthenticating their identity and\n\n258\n00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,530\nsomehow accessing that key as\npart of their user credential.\n\n259\n00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,210\nIf that user credential is\ncompromised all bets are off, right?\n\n260\n00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,150\nWe know that potentially then bad guys get\ninto the system and bad things happen.\n\n261\n00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,930\nBut because we use the receiver's public\nkey to encrypt the sender's private key,\n\n262\n00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,380\nthe receiver's private key is the only\nkey that can effectively unlock\n\n263\n00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,570\nthe sender's private key\nto then unlock the message.\n\n264\n00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:51,410\nAnd so what happens is we send two things,\nwe send the bulk encrypted Ciphertext,\n\n265\n00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:57,630\nand we send an encrypted key, so we send\ntwo things in effect in this system.\n\n266\n00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,255\nI in other words the receiver,\nwould get both I would get the encrypted\n\n267\n00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:06,670\nciphertexts which I can't read\nas I don't have a key for.\n\n268\n00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,220\nAnd then separately I get the key\nthat will unencrypt the Ciphertext.\n\n269\n00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,080\nI unencrypt the key.\n\n270\n00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,980\nI then use the key to run a secondary\nunencryption solution or a decryption\n\n271\n00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,530\na solution to un-encrypt the ciphertext\nand render it back into plain text.\n\n272\n00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,630\nSo this is how we create a hybrid system.\n\n273\n00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,140\nYou're gonna put the key there right?\n\n274\n00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,600\nAnd label it as encoded key, perfect.\n\n275\n00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,760\nVery good.\n\n276\n00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,083\nWe're gonna then have,\n\n277\n00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,926\nthe encoded text in Don's label makes\nit a little bit easier to refer to.\n\n278\n00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:42,368\nSo we're gonna have the encoded text being\nsent and the encoded key being sent, and\n\n279\n00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:46,430\nthen the two together are combined in\norder to then be able to render a message\n\n280\n00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,494\nthat could be unencrypted successfully\nusing the sender's private key but\n\n281\n00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:52,553\nnot exposing the key unnecessarily.\n\n282\n00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:57,211\nSo we're doing effectively secure\nkey transfer along with The value of\n\n283\n00:15:57,211 --> 00:16:01,480\nhaving the quick bulk encryption\nof the large amounts of data with\n\n284\n00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,870\nthe symmetric algorithm.\n\n285\n00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,060\nSo this is how these systems are built.\n\n286\n00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,800\nAnd this is how they actually then\nare able to securely transfer\n\n287\n00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,250\nthis key back and forth.\n\n288\n00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,810\nNow remember, if somebody interdicts,\ngets inside the message stream.\n\n289\n00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,010\nSteals the encrypted key, the encoded key.\n\n290\n00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,760\nUnless they can find the key\npair that will unencrypt the key\n\n291\n00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,080\nby getting the receiver's private\nkey out of the directory.\n\n292\n00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,430\nThe encrypted symmetric\nkey does them no good.\n\n293\n00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,080\nThey're not gonna be able to\nreverse engineer it, right.\n\n294\n00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,710\nBecause, as we pointed out,\n\n295\n00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,970\nthe value of the asymmetric system\nis computational infeasibility.\n\n296\n00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,390\nTo run the system backwards and\ngenerate one key from another, right.\n\n297\n00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,320\nWe're separating them in such a way that\nit's not supposed to be able to happen.\n\n298\n00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,190\nIf the system is not\nimplemented correctly,\n\n299\n00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,230\nif we have weak algorithms,\nobviously things can go wrong, right.\n\n300\n00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,490\nBut if we're not talking about any\nof those things being at the heart\n\n301\n00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,460\nof the issue.\n\n302\n00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,970\nIf things are implemented correctly,\nthis system should work and work well.\n\n303\n00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,820\nAnd we see these systems in\nproduction all the time, and\n\n304\n00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,950\nwe see them being used all the time\nto send and receive information.\n\n305\n00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,490\nNow, a lot of the times this is done for\nbulk\n\n306\n00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,440\nencryption to then store this encryption\nfor long term archival storage, right.\n\n307\n00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,330\nCuz we wanna be able to bulk encrypt data\nquickly, put into a storage container,\n\n308\n00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:24,840\nwhether it's a NAS solution,\nan NFF share somewhere.\n\n309\n00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,730\nJust bulk data being stored on a file\ndirectory in some sort of storage medium.\n\n310\n00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,865\nDoesn't really matter where.\n\n311\n00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:35,280\nIt's obviously not accessed very often if\nit's got double encrypted attached to it.\n\n312\n00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,898\nIt's just really meant for\nlong-term secure archival storage.\n\n313\n00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:41,755\nWe will do something like this sometimes\nbecause we can then simply transfer\n\n314\n00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:45,431\nthe encrypted key successfully,\nmake sure it's available if we have to\n\n315\n00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,160\ndecrypt the message, or\ndecrypt the data, rather.\n\n316\n00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,860\nAnd as a result, we no longer worry about\nbeing able to then have this data floating\n\n317\n00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,700\naround without it being secure.\n\n318\n00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,770\nSo these are where we tend to see\nthese kind of solutions happen, so.\n\n319\n00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,230\n>> Yeah, there's a couple of\nreal ingenious pieces to this.\n\n320\n00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,860\nIt's brilliant people that\ninvent these systems.\n\n321\n00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,590\nAnd the two big advantages,\nyou mentioned, Adam.\n\n322\n00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,420\nHow, basically, we are starting the\nsession by using these asymmetric keys,\n\n323\n00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,590\nwhich is a little more\nresource intensive and\n\n324\n00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,160\nnot as good, performance wise,\nas a symmetric key.\n\n325\n00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,210\nAnd we securely exchange that key, and\nafter that point, once the symmetric\n\n326\n00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,175\nkey's been exchanged, all your raw data\ntransfers using those symmetric keys.\n\n327\n00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:29,260\nSo you get the benefit and security of\ndoing the faster symmetric keys, but\n\n328\n00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,310\nwith the secure key exchange happening.\n\n329\n00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,270\nThe other benefit of that, and\nyou'll see this in some systems,\n\n330\n00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,020\nis that symmetric key can change for\nevery single session you make.\n\n331\n00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,890\nSo it's not necessarily the same\nsymmetric key every single time.\n\n332\n00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,860\nBecause that key exchange is happening,\nwhen the session builds up,\n\n333\n00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,320\nthey can generate new symmetric\nkeys to use for each session.\n\n334\n00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,710\nSo if somebody does intercept that\ntraffic, and years go by, and\n\n335\n00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,490\nthey manage to finally break it, right.\n\n336\n00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,150\nLet's just say that's possible.\n\n337\n00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,490\nIt shouldn't be, but let's say that it is.\n\n338\n00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,400\nEven if they break it, that would\nbe the key for just that session,\n\n339\n00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,590\nnot necessarily follow-on\nsessions from there.\n\n340\n00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,610\nSo it's a very high level of security and\n\n341\n00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,090\nit really is just a generally\naccepted pattern now.\n\n342\n00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,180\n>> Very good, and it's very correct to\npoint that out to remind us of that.\n\n343\n00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,650\nSo it is something to consider and\nto be aware of.\n\n344\n00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,358\nSo, hopefully you have this visual\nrepresentation of the process that's gonna\n\n345\n00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:23,330\nhelp you to get this\nstraight in your head.\n\n346\n00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,310\nI mentioned at the end of the last episode\nas we were wrapping up our discussions,\n\n347\n00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,810\nthat we wanted you to stop and\njust think for a couple of minutes,\n\n348\n00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,160\nas you are reviewing that material\nbefore you were moving on,\n\n349\n00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,320\nthat we wanted you to get it\nstraight in your head, right.\n\n350\n00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,470\nWhat was the private key?\n\n351\n00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,960\nWhat was the public key?\n\n352\n00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,540\nHow does symmetric work?\n\n353\n00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,980\nHow does asymmetric work?\n\n354\n00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,570\nBecause knowing and looking ahead to being\nable to combine the two becomes very\n\n355\n00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,870\nimportant for you to keep track of\nwhich key comes from which party, and\n\n356\n00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,030\nwhich system is being used in\nwhich part of the diagram, right.\n\n357\n00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,350\nAll right, so hopefully this is helpful to\nyou in the sense of just clarifying and\n\n358\n00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,860\nmaking sure we can visually see it.\n\n359\n00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,200\nAll the diagrams, obviously,\nare things that we produce for you,\n\n360\n00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,810\njust to make it easier for you to render\nthem in your mind, to think about them.\n\n361\n00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,110\nIf you come up with a better\nway to document this,\n\n362\n00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,900\nand you come up with a better diagram that\nworks for you as you're preparing and\n\n363\n00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,940\nmastering this material, go for it, right.\n\n364\n00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,050\nI mean there is no right\nway to put this together.\n\n365\n00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,240\nObviously, other than the sense that there\nhas to be certain things on certain sides\n\n366\n00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,850\nof the diagram labeled a certain way.\n\n367\n00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:26,960\nBut if you prefer triangles and\nsmiley faces to circles and\n\n368\n00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,150\nrectangles, then that's what works for\nyou and that's what's important.\n\n369\n00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,170\nSo, just understand this is simply our\nvision of how this comes together,\n\n370\n00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,020\neasily identifiable so\nwe can label it for you.\n\n371\n00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,330\nIt's not the only way to represent this,\njust so we're clear about that.\n\n372\n00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,720\nAll right so we've done some good\nconversation around this stuff.\n\n373\n00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,240\nLet's talk for\n\n374\n00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,900\nat least a couple of minutes about\nkind of the next step in the process.\n\n375\n00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900\nWe've talked a bit about proof of origin.\n\n376\n00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,350\nLet's take a look at hashing.\n\n377\n00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,270\nLet's talk a bit about hashing and\nwhat we could do with hashing.\n\n378\n00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,400\nWe actually have a little\ndemonstration that we're gonna do for\n\n379\n00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,110\nyou with hashing in just a minute.\n\n380\n00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,730\nBut before we show you the magic, it's\nprobably good to explain the magic, so\n\n381\n00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,300\nthat when you see it you know\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n382\n00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,340\nSo let's start out by talking\nabout what a hash is and\n\n383\n00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,450\nwhat it represents to us, right.\n\n384\n00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,180\nWhen we think about hashing data,\nwhat we're doing is,\n\n385\n00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,290\nwe're taking a large amount of data,\nactually variable length data.\n\n386\n00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:21,190\nAnd I'm gonna generate a little formula\nhere for you by way of explaining this so\n\n387\n00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,630\nwe can capture this, and help you\nto think about what a hash equals.\n\n388\n00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,530\nSo a hash can take any amount of data,\nit doesn't really matter how big.\n\n389\n00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,100\nIt could be a single bit,\nit could be just the letter T, or\n\n390\n00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,470\nit could be the sum total of all knowledge\nthe human race has ever produced, right.\n\n391\n00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,680\nAnything in between.\n\n392\n00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,940\nSo input variable amounts of\ndata plus a hashing algorithm.\n\n393\n00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,170\nSo, [COUGH] we add a hashing algorithm\nthat is gonna be appropriate.\n\n394\n00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,360\nWe're gonna take a look at this and\nshow you how to do this in just a minute.\n\n395\n00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,010\nAlgorith, as opposed to algorithm, right?\n\n396\n00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,600\n>> No you got it right.\n\n397\n00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,470\n>> It's just when you stopped typing for\na second, you left the m off.\n\n398\n00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,098\nSo, apply the hashing algorithm, and\n\n399\n00:21:56,098 --> 00:22:02,160\nthen what we get at the bottom is going to\nbe the hash, the output equals the hash.\n\n400\n00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:08,720\nAnd what the hash equals is a,\nbit stream of, not data, right.\n\n401\n00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,640\nWe're not taking the data and\ntransforming it in any way, but\n\n402\n00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,740\nrather representing the data\nwith a fixed amount of bits, and\n\n403\n00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,880\nI'll talk about why\nthey're fixed in a minute,\n\n404\n00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,970\nto represent what the data is at\nthat moment in time that we hash it.\n\n405\n00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,910\nIn other words, freeze frame,\n\n406\n00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,020\nthis is the state of the data\nright now when we hash it.\n\n407\n00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,870\nWhat hashing does is it creates integrity.\n\n408\n00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,430\nAnd so\nwe've been talking about confidentiality.\n\n409\n00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,460\nHashing is a focus on integrity.\n\n410\n00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,410\nWe wanna make sure we understand that.\n\n411\n00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:45,180\nBecause what that does for\nus is it freezes the state of the data\n\n412\n00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,450\nin our minds and on the paper, so\nto speak, when we generate the hash.\n\n413\n00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,400\nAnd as long as the data does not change,\n\n414\n00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,790\nthe hash will be the same no matter\nhow long we wait to run it again.\n\n415\n00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,200\nIt's when the hash is modified,\nthe output stream,\n\n416\n00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,400\nthe bits themselves in\nthe output stream change.\n\n417\n00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,310\nWe know the data has been\nmodified in some way.\n\n418\n00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,560\nAnd so this is generically,\nit's called a hash.\n\n419\n00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,060\nBut generically, we refer to this\nas a trip wire solution, right,\n\n420\n00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,710\nbecause this is gonna tell us if\nthere's been some sort of a change.\n\n421\n00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,630\nSome way, whatever that is.\n\n422\n00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,230\nSo let's take a look at how it works,\nand then let's come back and\n\n423\n00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,590\ntalk about some of the algorithms\nthat are used for hashing.\n\n424\n00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,250\nYou're gonna see a couple of\nthem in the demonstration.\n\n425\n00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,660\nAnd we'll then talk about the fixed bit\noutput that these algorithms produce\n\n426\n00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,640\nfor us.\n\n427\n00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,160\nSo let's go ahead, let's take a look.\n\n428\n00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,530\nI think we have a program, right.\n\n429\n00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,690\nYou had a little program you like to\nuse that you wanted to demo with.\n\n430\n00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,040\nSo lets take a look at that.\n\n431\n00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,105\n>> Yeah this is a little program,\nwe call it Karen's Hasher.\n\n432\n00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:41,855\n>> It's free.\n\n433\n00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:45,245\nYou can go out and download it off\nthe Internet thing, and [LAUGH].\n\n434\n00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:46,875\n>> The thing, the internet thing.\n\n435\n00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:50,126\n>> The internet thing.\nAnd I like this one just cuz it's simple.\n\n436\n00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:51,702\nThere's a ton of other\nones that are out there.\n\n437\n00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,165\nYou're welcome to use whatever you want,\nbut this one's just really, really easy.\n\n438\n00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:58,890\nYou can feed some text into it or\nentire files, even groups of files, and\n\n439\n00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,934\nit will run a hash algorithm of your\nchoice against it and give you the result.\n\n440\n00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:06,002\nAnd you'll see where I can kind of pick.\n\n441\n00:24:06,002 --> 00:24:08,680\n>> Can we make, yeah, I was gonna say\njust zoom in and make it a little bigger.\n\n442\n00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,340\nAll right, great.\n\n443\n00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,770\n>> Let me change this so\nI can still click while I do it, there.\n\n444\n00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,810\nSo you can actually come through here and\n\n445\n00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,730\npick which algorithm it\nis that you want to use.\n\n446\n00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,020\nBecause there's different strengths and\nit all just kind of depends on your\n\n447\n00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,940\nenvironment, what you may or\nmay not actually want or need.\n\n448\n00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,930\nAnd so\nI can just type something in here like.\n\n449\n00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,750\n>> Oh wait, can I pick the text?\n\n450\n00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,950\n>> Oh, sure.\nWhat do you wanna do?\n\n451\n00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,628\n>> Starbucks.\n\n452\n00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:30,649\n>> Starbucks.\n\n453\n00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:34,470\n[LAUGH] Little free product placement\nfrom our non-sponsor, Starbucks.\n\n454\n00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,740\n>> Little side joke we're running here,\nso just, yeah.\n\n455\n00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,632\nBut let's take a look at\nwhat that looks like.\n\n456\n00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,373\n>> If anything, we're sponsoring them,\nthe amount of coffee that you drink.\n\n457\n00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:42,440\n[LAUGH] So.\n\n458\n00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,530\nAll right, so\nwe'll punch in just the name Starbucks.\n\n459\n00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:50,940\nWe then select which hashing algorithm we\nwanna use, and it is entirely up to us.\n\n460\n00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,913\nThere's different strengths.\n\n461\n00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:55,121\nObviously with SHA,\nthe secure hashing algorithm,\n\n462\n00:24:55,121 --> 00:25:00,110\nyou've got different bit strengths you can\npick from and I'll just do MD5 to start\n\n463\n00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,045\nwith cuz that's the older and\nweaker of them but the most common.\n\n464\n00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:09,290\nAnd so when I run it, it's feeding that\ntext string, right, which is Starbucks.\n\n465\n00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,225\nWhat is that, ten characters?\n\n466\n00:25:11,225 --> 00:25:12,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n467\n00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,390\n>> So it's feeding simply ten\ncharacters to a formula, and\n\n468\n00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,980\nthe result is considerably more\nthan ten characters, right?\n\n469\n00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,690\nAnd let's just.\n\n470\n00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,710\n>> Whoa.\n>> We'll move over there.\n\n471\n00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,290\nLet's just kind of keep\nthis in perspective here.\n\n472\n00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,290\n>> So let's do, you wanna do MD5?\n\n473\n00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,470\nOh, in plaintext.\n\n474\n00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,570\n>> So, in plaintext we had Starbucks,\nright?\n\n475\n00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,714\nAnd that was MD5 that I just\ndid which resulted in that.\n\n476\n00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:41,383\nAnd we'll just do maybe\njust a few of these, right?\n\n477\n00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:43,472\n>> Okay, yeah, you could do a couple\nof the different ones, sure.\n\n478\n00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:46,724\n>> Well, we could spend all day.\n\n479\n00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:48,547\n>> Look, another hash, how exciting.\n\n480\n00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,330\n>> Did I close the program?\n\n481\n00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,300\nAre you kidding me?\n\n482\n00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,360\n>> All right, so brief technical pause\nhere while we bring the program back up.\n\n483\n00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,470\n>> This is a great chance to\nshow something, though, Adam.\n\n484\n00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,900\nSo, I closed it by accident,\nbecause I wasn't paying attention.\n\n485\n00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:06,578\nAnd if I come in here and type in\nStarbucks again, right, Starbuicks,\n\n486\n00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:11,290\nStarbucks again, if I recalculate that\nMD5 hash, it's the same formula and\n\n487\n00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,660\nthe same input, right, so\nI should get the same results.\n\n488\n00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,960\nSo even though I close the program,\nthis should be the same exact result and\n\n489\n00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,730\nI could always compare that.\n\n490\n00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,482\n>> Now the users, the consumers here,\nthe people that are watching,\n\n491\n00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:26,551\nthey'll trust us, right?\n\n492\n00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,364\nThey're gonna know it's the same.\n\n493\n00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:28,711\nWe just have to tell them and\nthey'll rely on us.\n\n494\n00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:29,467\n>> Trust in no one.\n\n495\n00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,582\n>> Trust no one, exactly.\n\n496\n00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:33,240\n>> The one thing you\nlearned from the X-Files.\n\n497\n00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,160\nSo I've pasted it in I can see\nthat it is exactly the same, but\n\n498\n00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,420\nthat is not the SHA-1.\n\n499\n00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,440\nSo let me go back and redo that one.\n\n500\n00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,265\nSo this time I'm gonna choose SHA-1 and\nrerun it, and\n\n501\n00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:45,870\nI'll see that it should be\na different result this time.\n\n502\n00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,701\nAnd I'll just quickly do SHA-512 also.\n\n503\n00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:55,200\nAnd throw that one in there.\n\n504\n00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,341\nThere we go.\n>> Yeah, but that's fine.\n\n505\n00:26:58,341 --> 00:26:59,899\nYou can tell it's obviously much longer,\nright?\n\n506\n00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:00,756\n>> Okay, yep.\n\n507\n00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:02,222\n>> So that's really all we wanna show,\n\n508\n00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:04,982\nwe don't really care about the actual\nstring cuz it's irrelevant.\n\n509\n00:27:04,982 --> 00:27:06,205\nAll right, so great demo,\n\n510\n00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:08,770\nand a couple things we wanna\ntake away from this, right?\n\n511\n00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,650\nAnd actually you know, I want you\nto do one more thing if you could.\n\n512\n00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,080\nGo back and do Starbucks again but\nspell it like Starbuicks, and do the MD5.\n\n513\n00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:20,810\nCuz it's the smallest one so it will be\neasy to show it and let's take a look at\n\n514\n00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,990\nwhat that hash looks like when you\nchange just one item in the text, right?\n\n515\n00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:31,630\nSo this will be MD5 at Starbuicks or\nwhatever we did there and\n\n516\n00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:36,410\nyou could see that as we compare the two\nthere for you we'll put it down there.\n\n517\n00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,740\nWe can take a quick look.\n\n518\n00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,960\nWe will see that just\nchanging one character\n\n519\n00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,350\nchanges the output of the hash stream, and\n\n520\n00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:51,260\nas a result, remember what we're focused\non here is integrity, not confidentiality.\n\n521\n00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,910\nAnd so as a result,\n\n522\n00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,960\nwhat we find is that by modifying\nthe data, we have modified the hash.\n\n523\n00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,781\nAnd it's a very simple,\nstraightforward, on/off,\n\n524\n00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:04,010\ntrue/false [LAUGH] kind of system, right?\n\n525\n00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,380\nIt's a very, very binary solution.\n\n526\n00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,921\nIt's either the same way it was,\nor it's modified.\n\n527\n00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:13,191\nWell, what we use this for\nis to tell that data has either integrity\n\n528\n00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:17,764\nassociated with it, it has not been\nmodified, or it has no integrity,\n\n529\n00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:20,221\ndata has been modified at some point.\n\n530\n00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:22,720\nNow, we can use this for data on the wire.\n\n531\n00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,520\nWe can use this for data at rest.\n\n532\n00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,082\nAnd we use it in both cases, data on\nthe wire is the generic term we use.\n\n533\n00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:32,383\nWe're talking about data in transit, where\nwe're sending data back and forth and\n\n534\n00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:36,623\nit could be picked off during transit by\nsomebody, a man in the middle attack, for\n\n535\n00:28:36,623 --> 00:28:39,010\ninstance, somehow interdicted.\n\n536\n00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,040\nWe could actually see some sort of\ncompromise in the data where we\n\n537\n00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,250\nare manipulating frames and\ninserting or injecting or\n\n538\n00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,650\nperhaps removing key pieces of the data.\n\n539\n00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,440\nSo any of those things\nwould then modify the hash.\n\n540\n00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,200\nAnd so if Don was to send data to me and\n\n541\n00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,910\nwanted to ensure integrity,\nhe would hash the data before he sends it.\n\n542\n00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,590\nI would then hash it when I receive it.\n\n543\n00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,510\nWe would just have to agree\non what the algorithm was,\n\n544\n00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,820\nas you can see, that was used.\n\n545\n00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,980\nDoesn't really matter what program we use,\nby the way.\n\n546\n00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,290\nHe could use the Karen program.\n\n547\n00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,965\nI could could use any of the hundreds\nof other programs that exist.\n\n548\n00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,615\nIt's the algorithm that's imported,\n\n549\n00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:15,275\nnot the way we run the hash\nthrough the program.\n\n550\n00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:18,895\nThe algorithm itself that will produce\nthe same exact output over and over and\n\n551\n00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:21,895\nover again given the same input, and so\n\n552\n00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:25,445\nas a result,\nwhat we then do is we run the hash again.\n\n553\n00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:27,755\nWhen I run the hash,\nit should be identical and\n\n554\n00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:30,225\nif we compare the two and\nit is, we're good.\n\n555\n00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:32,600\nIf we compare the two and\nwe're not, then Don and\n\n556\n00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,890\nI both know that for somehow, some way,\nsome reason, data has been modified.\n\n557\n00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,980\nCould have just been by the way that it\nwas a bad set and we lost a data pack.\n\n558\n00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,600\nRight, there was collision, something\nwent wrong, we were using a UDP solution.\n\n559\n00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,410\nSo we did a resend instead\nof a TCB based solution.\n\n560\n00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,120\nAnd we did resend.\n\n561\n00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,610\nWe could've dropped one of the sequence\npackets out of the Windows buffer, and\n\n562\n00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,140\nas a result we might've missed it.\n\n563\n00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,210\nThere's all these things that could have\ngone wrong that don't indicate foul play,\n\n564\n00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,490\nbut it could also have been that somebody\nwas actually trying to steal the data.\n\n565\n00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,600\nSo there's lots of\nthings that could go on.\n\n566\n00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,170\nNow, you know, we could see modification\nof this data stream where somebody is\n\n567\n00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,010\nport mirroring, right?\n\n568\n00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,750\nAnd so, for instance, they could be\nsucking this data out of a system into\n\n569\n00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,010\nan analyzer and putting it back on the\nwire, in effect looping it and running it\n\n570\n00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:21,350\naround and through and monitoring it with\na promiscuous mode driver of some kind.\n\n571\n00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,390\nWhen that happens,\ndepending on how it's done, you may or\n\n572\n00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,230\nmay not see any change to\nthe data stream itself.\n\n573\n00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,550\nYou may increment the headers\nin the actual TCP header, right,\n\n574\n00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,250\nbut you're not gonna\nmodify the data packet.\n\n575\n00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,800\nAnd we focused on the header\nearly on in one of our episodes.\n\n576\n00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,840\nWe kind of threw that up and\nworked through it.\n\n577\n00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,520\nWe didn't take a look at the middle and\nthe back end of that data frame,\n\n578\n00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,810\nwhich would have been the middle package\npart, which is basically the data, right?\n\n579\n00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:51,670\nAnd then the back end which is the trailer\nwhere we have the error control and\n\n580\n00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,700\ncorrection and all the buffering and\nstuff that goes on there.\n\n581\n00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,600\nThe data packet itself in the middle, the\ndata, the bits of the data in the frame\n\n582\n00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,040\nwill not get modified when we do that\nkind of surreptitious monitoring, but\n\n583\n00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,900\nwe may increment the header ID.\n\n584\n00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,440\nAnd so there could be ways to\ntell the data has been looked at\n\n585\n00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,250\neven though it hasn't been modified, but\na hash is not gonna be that mechanism.\n\n586\n00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,160\nWe can obviously talk about\nthat in a different episode and\n\n587\n00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,050\ntalk more about the tricks of the trade\nthere that go into monitoring and\n\n588\n00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,720\nunderstanding how that works.\n\n589\n00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,050\nSo when we talk about hashing let's make\nsure we make some notes here quickly about\n\n590\n00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,500\nthe bit output that comes\nout with these algorithms.\n\n591\n00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,184\nSo the two that are most\ncommon is the MD series,\n\n592\n00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:33,812\nspecifically MD5,\nwhich is gonna produce, or MD2 and MD5,\n\n593\n00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:37,900\nI should say, but typically MD5\nis the one we see implemented.\n\n594\n00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,199\nThat's gonna produce a 128-bit output.\n\n595\n00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:45,858\nSo when you run that, the output that\nwe're looking at is 128 bits always,\n\n596\n00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:47,418\nwithout fail, for MD5.\n\n597\n00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:51,598\nThe SHA-1 series is going\nto produce 160-bit output.\n\n598\n00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:54,442\nAnd so these are the two that\ntypically you wanna be familiar with.\n\n599\n00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:58,938\nAnd want to know because if you're gonna\nanswer questions about this kind of stuff,\n\n600\n00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:02,800\nyou want to know what the standard\nalgorithms that are more often used for\n\n601\n00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,490\nhashing on an output.\n\n602\n00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,900\nSo if we recap here quickly,\n\n603\n00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,720\njust to understand the formula,\nI call it a formula,\n\n604\n00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,950\nit's not an actual real formula,\nit's just a way of thinking about it.\n\n605\n00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:18,230\nVariable data input, plus hashing\nalgorithm equals fixed bit output,\n\n606\n00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,640\nand remember it's not\nthe data we're outputting.\n\n607\n00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,770\nIt's a representation,\n\n608\n00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,770\na computational representation of\nthe data through the hashing algorithm.\n\n609\n00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:30,200\n>> And you'll hear some people refer to\nthis as non-reversible encryption, and\n\n610\n00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,230\nwhat they're really saying is that\nwe're not truly encrypting our data.\n\n611\n00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,970\nBut it's that if you have this hash,\nyou can't reverse it, you can't undo\n\n612\n00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,940\nthis to find out what the original text\nis, that's not the purpose of this, right?\n\n613\n00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,290\nIt's expected that you already have\nthe original text, and you're using this,\n\n614\n00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,200\nyou yourself are apply the algorithm, so\nit's almost like both sides are encrypting\n\n615\n00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,100\nin a way to then compare those results,\nthat's how this is supposed to be used.\n\n616\n00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,760\nSo it is simply integrity,\nyou don't get confidentiality with this.\n\n617\n00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,120\n>> Yeah, it's a little confusing\nsometimes, people refer to it that way,\n\n618\n00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,910\nand I really try hard not to use that\nterminology when I talk about this.\n\n619\n00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,540\nBecause it leads you down the road of\nthinking that somehow we're bringing\n\n620\n00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,235\nconfidentiality into the conversation.\n\n621\n00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:10,180\nIf we go so\n\n622\n00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,948\nfar out of our way to stress that whenever\nwe encrypt, we create confidentiality.\n\n623\n00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:16,060\nAnd it's just not a very good\nway of thinking about it,\n\n624\n00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,810\nso let's wipe that reference in the sense\n\n625\n00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,730\nof thinking about it in your mind as not\nbeing associated with this conversation.\n\n626\n00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,180\nBut Don raises a good point,\n\n627\n00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,140\nbecause you do see it referred to\nout there in documentation that way.\n\n628\n00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,380\nBut really associate\nhashing with integrity.\n\n629\n00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,230\nAnd very important to the thought process.\n\n630\n00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,260\nSo, I think we've done a good job of\ngetting through our discussion around\n\n631\n00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,930\nthe hybrid solution, around\nthe asymmetric symmetric key exchange.\n\n632\n00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,435\nWe've brought hashing\ninto the mix to really\n\n633\n00:33:42,435 --> 00:33:44,623\nhelp people understand the integrity\nside of the conversation.\n\n634\n00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:49,648\nSo it's probably, for us, a good point\nto step back and end another episode and\n\n635\n00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:54,233\ngo spend some time with the family and\npet the dog and have a beer, right?\n\n636\n00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,350\nOr whatever it is we do\nat the end of the day.\n\n637\n00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,055\n>> Inconceivable.\n\n638\n00:33:57,055 --> 00:33:58,483\n[LAUGH]\n>> Inconceivable, right, exactly.\n\n639\n00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:00,400\nThat doesn't happen here at IT TV.\n\n640\n00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,240\nBut what we are gonna do\nis wrap up this episode.\n\n641\n00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,120\nWhen we do come back with another one,\nand we will, we promise you,\n\n642\n00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,490\ndefinitely come back with another one,\nwe're gonna continue talking and\n\n643\n00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,790\nwhat we're gonna talk about is\nsome digital signatures, right?\n\n644\n00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,140\nWe'll talk about some of that.\n\n645\n00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,870\nWe do have PKI coming up in a future\nepisode, so stay tuned for that as well,\n\n646\n00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:18,380\nbecause, obviously a real important part\nof the cryptography conversation is how we\n\n647\n00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,322\nuse digital identity and digital\ncertificates to create that identity.\n\n648\n00:34:21,322 --> 00:34:24,640\n>> All right well ladies and gentlemen\nlets wrap it up here, I do want to remind\n\n649\n00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,950\nyou guys if you ever have any questions\non this cuz its a lot to swallow.\n\n650\n00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,250\nMake sure you take advantage of how\nyou can interact with us, right?\n\n651\n00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,420\nLive during the show right beneath the\nlive video you'll see see the chat room,\n\n652\n00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,600\nyou can post your questions there.\n\n653\n00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,040\nWe monitor and answer.\n\n654\n00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,880\nIf you are watching this\nas a recorded episode,\n\n655\n00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,850\ntake advantage of our Q&A section.\n\n656\n00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:47,430\nOn the top of every page at ITPro.tv,\nyou'll see a link that says Q&A.\n\n657\n00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,170\nYou can jump into the Q&A forms,\n\n658\n00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,500\npost the questions there,\nwe monitor and answer, right?\n\n659\n00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,970\nIt's important to us that you guys have\na good grasp of all this concept because\n\n660\n00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,570\nthat's what's gonna make you\nsuccessful on that exam.\n\n661\n00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,780\nAnd that's what we want\nat the end of the day.\n\n662\n00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,770\nSo take advantage of the resources,\nthey're there for you.\n\n663\n00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,377\nAll right, well signing off for\nITProTV, I'm

welcome everybody to another\nepisode of ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick and\n\n5\n00:00:36,574 --> 00:00:37,730\nwith me today is.\n\n6\n00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,560\n>> I'm Adam Gordon,\n\n7\n00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,030\nat least that's who I was this\nmorning when I got started anyway.\n\n8\n00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,913\n>> I was a little confused after\nwatching the last segment there.\n\n9\n00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:46,344\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> We had Mike 2.0 showed up.\n\n10\n00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:50,408\n>> [LAUGH] Glad to have everybody here,\nand today, we're gonna be going back into\n\n11\n00:00:50,408 --> 00:00:54,720\nour SSC Episodes, and more specifically,\nI think with this one we're gonna start\n\n12\n00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,195\ndiving into digital signatures, and\nthen the wonderful world of PKI.\n\n13\n00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:00,135\n>> Absolutely.\n\n14\n00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:01,925\nNot KPI but PKI.\n\n15\n00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,125\nDifferent conversations.\n\n16\n00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,960\nAlthough we can measure the PKI\nsolution with KPI, [LAUGH] but\n\n17\n00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,540\nthat's a whole other conversation.\n\n18\n00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,260\nObviously, we want to continue our\nconversations, we've been focusing\n\n19\n00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,810\nin some of our prior episodes in the area\nof cryptography on things like keys and\n\n20\n00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,430\nkey exchange and algorithms and\nasymmetric and symmetric solutions,\n\n21\n00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,420\nidentity, management with proof of\norigin and non-repudiation and hashing.\n\n22\n00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,160\nWe talked about using confidentiality\nthrough encryption, applying those models.\n\n23\n00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,190\nI want to bring a lot of that back around\nnow and start narrowing the focus and\n\n24\n00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,670\nget down to some of the last areas we have\nto discuss in this particular knowledge\n\n25\n00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,190\nmodule, and\nwe wanna talk about digital signatures.\n\n26\n00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,720\nWe're gonna start talking about that right\nnow or also, as you heard from Mike,\n\n27\n00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,730\ntalk a bit about PKI and\ntalk about digital identity, and\n\n28\n00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,690\nhow we use digital certificates to\nbe able to establish that identity.\n\n29\n00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,681\nBut also, how we use it to safeguard\ninformation in relation to the management\n\n30\n00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:59,532\nof identity, and\nwe'll make that connection as we go.\n\n31\n00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:02,427\nSo let's first highlight what digital\nsignatures are able to do for\n\n32\n00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:05,471\nus by way of introducing the concept and\nthen we're going to go ahead and\n\n33\n00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:09,440\nwe're going to put a little screen capture\nup or a graphic that we've worked on.\n\n34\n00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,300\nWe're going to walk you through what the\nprocess of creating a digital signature\n\n35\n00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,240\nlooks like and reference those keys\nwe've been talking about, symmetric,\n\n36\n00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,860\nasymmetric and\nput the whole thing in there.\n\n37\n00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,578\nSo the idea with a digital signature\nis that each user is going to\n\n38\n00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:23,080\nhave a public-private key pair.\n\n39\n00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,770\nThis idea of the asymmetric\nsolution we spoke about earlier,\n\n40\n00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:32,510\nwhere we are talking about having\na private key that is kept by the user,\n\n41\n00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,250\nconfidential, not shared\nwith anybody else.\n\n42\n00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,430\nWe then also have a public key that\nis gonna be made available and\n\n43\n00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,700\nthat public key is made available so that\nanybody who wants to interact with and\n\n44\n00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,370\nuse this digital signature, read it,\nunderstand it, validate identity\n\n45\n00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,540\nthrough it, is gonna be able to access\nit and combine the two keys together.\n\n46\n00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,980\nAs a result, then be able to achieve\nthe end result, which will be to validate\n\n47\n00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,050\nthe sender's identity and create integrity\nand non-repudiation along the way.\n\n48\n00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,250\nSo the private key is used to sign,\nthe private key is used to create\n\n49\n00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,810\nthe signature, and\nwe say the public key is used to verify.\n\n50\n00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,240\nWe may just wanna, Mike,\nas you're making notes there, and\n\n51\n00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,660\nyou did a great job of putting\nthat stuff just up there for\n\n52\n00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,830\nus, you'll create the signature,\nwould be a great capture there.\n\n53\n00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,820\nThen for public,\nwe'll be doing the verification concept,\n\n54\n00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,210\nis what we want to take away as a key\nindicator of what the public key does.\n\n55\n00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,460\nWhat this effectively does when we combine\nthe public-private key pair together in\n\n56\n00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,290\nthe digital signature is it effectively\ncreates this idea that I mentioned\n\n57\n00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,380\nof non-repudiation.\n\n58\n00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,660\nOf binding the message,\nwhatever the message is,\n\n59\n00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,810\nto the user in such a way that the user\ncan't claim they didn't send the message.\n\n60\n00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,650\n>> It wasn't me, I swear.\n\n61\n00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,260\n>> Exactly, right.\n\n62\n00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,600\nIt wasn't me, I wasn't there.\n\n63\n00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:51,620\n[LAUGH] We talked about this and we say\noftentimes, to use Mike as an example,\n\n64\n00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,730\nhow do we know really that Mike is\non the other end of the keyboard,\n\n65\n00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,470\nwhen maybe you and\nI are exchanging information.\n\n66\n00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,775\nWhen you're texting with somebody,\nif you're sending somebody a text or\n\n67\n00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:03,350\nchatting, you connect to them, their ID,\nwhether it's their phone number,\n\n68\n00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,010\nmaybe it's a screen alias for chat.\n\n69\n00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,970\nSo you have a general idea,\nin theory, that it's that person but\n\n70\n00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,220\nyou don't know for sure.\n\n71\n00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,390\n>> Somebody could have their phone or\nsomething like that\n\n72\n00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,270\n>> Somebody could, we don't know for sure,\n\n73\n00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,330\nthere's no way to really identify\nnecessarily just based on the technology\n\n74\n00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:25,230\nbeing used by itself that it really is\nsomebody on the other end of the phone or\n\n75\n00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,380\non the other end of the chat message.\n\n76\n00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,330\nWe hear cases about this all the time.\n\n77\n00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,400\nSomebody thought it was somebody else,\nrealized later, it wasn't.\n\n78\n00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,350\nThere was that little sporting\nincident a few months back,\n\n79\n00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,390\nthat last year we may have heard about or\n\n80\n00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,100\nmake reference to, without naming\nany names or anything like that.\n\n81\n00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,010\nBut when you talk to people over the wire\nor you send information over the wire,\n\n82\n00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,815\nunless there's facial recognition\ninvolved, face to face,\n\n83\n00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:54,445\nliterally me looking at you as we are now,\nto truly identify face to face in\n\n84\n00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:58,775\nperson that the person is who we think\nthey are, it's very difficult to know.\n\n85\n00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:02,745\nAt the end of the day, we talk about\nthis reasonable expectation of system of\n\n86\n00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:07,035\nsecurity, reasonable expectation of\nidentity and identity management but\n\n87\n00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:07,985\nwe don't know for sure.\n\n88\n00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:12,780\nThis is why we come back to these ideas\nof defense in depth, of building multiple\n\n89\n00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,500\nlayers of security and identity into\na system to validate who that user is.\n\n90\n00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,310\nRemember, technology such as biometrics\nthat we've talked about come into play\n\n91\n00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,260\nhere, so we may be able to add\nin a biometrics solution, or\n\n92\n00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,570\nsome sort of multifactor authentication\nsolution, where we have something,\n\n93\n00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,730\nwe know something, we are something.\n\n94\n00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,230\nBy adding one or more of those together,\nwe bring in so many different data\n\n95\n00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,200\npoints that it becomes very unlikely,\nand we talked about the likeliness or\n\n96\n00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,220\nunlikeliness, that\nthreshold that we cross.\n\n97\n00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,890\nIt tends to become much more\nunlikely that somebody is indeed\n\n98\n00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,790\npretending to be somebody else when\nwe add one and then add another and\n\n99\n00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,030\nanother factor of authentication.\n\n100\n00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,610\nSo just usernames, passwords,\nkind of light on the authentication.\n\n101\n00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,650\nMaybe okay for average things but\n\n102\n00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,618\nprobably a determined attacker's\ngoing to get past that pretty quick.\n\n103\n00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:04,250\n>> Low security.\n>> Yeah.\n\n104\n00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,549\n>> Or any good five year-old who knows how\nto type may get past that pretty quickly.\n\n105\n00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:09,430\n>> [LAUGH] Or\npeople who look under the keyboard.\n\n106\n00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,620\n>> Just flip the keyboard and\nsee what's there but\n\n107\n00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,330\nwhen we think about this idea of adding\nnot just used name and password,\n\n108\n00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:22,360\nsomething you know or something you will\nknow, knowledge, to something you have.\n\n109\n00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,670\nSo maybe a key fob, something like\nthat and then something you are,\n\n110\n00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,530\nmaybe a retina scan or an iris scan and\nquick knowledge check for you, here.\n\n111\n00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,980\nRemember, you wanna know the difference\nbetween the retina and iris scan,\n\n112\n00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,500\nbe able to talk about those knowledgeably,\nas you prepare to answer some questions.\n\n113\n00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,240\nReaching backwards to that episode, wanna\nmake sure we also know the difference\n\n114\n00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,570\nbetween hand geometry and signature\ndynamics, know the difference there.\n\n115\n00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,730\nAgain, forms of biometrics,\nkeystroke dynamics as well,\n\n116\n00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,730\nwant to make sure we understand\nthe differences there between those.\n\n117\n00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,300\nIf we add those things in,\nit becomes a lot more valuable to us.\n\n118\n00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,010\nThe idea would be when we\nprovide non-repudiation,\n\n119\n00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,070\nwe want to make sure that\nwe are relatively secure,\n\n120\n00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,120\nrelatively sure, that the person on the\nother end is indeed who they claim to be.\n\n121\n00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,000\nThis becomes important when\nwe are doing a lot today.\n\n122\n00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,960\nOnline banking, thinks like this where a\nlot of online transactions take place, and\n\n123\n00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,110\nwe have to validate beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that we know who the parties are,\n\n124\n00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,010\nand we call them trusted parties,\nby the way.\n\n125\n00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,840\nWe have trusted parties.\n\n126\n00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,390\nYou can digitally sign documents\nin lieu of an actual physical\n\n127\n00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,430\nsignature done in front of somebody.\n\n128\n00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,800\nMaybe to do banking, to do bill pay,\n\n129\n00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,890\nyou can sign digital documents to attest\nto things today, those kinds of things.\n\n130\n00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,630\nWe want to make sure we know how this\nsystem works because it's coming more and\n\n131\n00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,309\nmore prevalent and so a digital signature\nis effectively gonna be created.\n\n132\n00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,240\nWe're gonna take a look at the way\nit's created here in just a second but\n\n133\n00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,280\neffectively created by encrypting\na hash of the message.\n\n134\n00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,120\nWe talked about hashes in\nour last episode, and so\n\n135\n00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,376\nthe hash is the concept of\ncreating this proof of origin.\n\n136\n00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:57,004\nWe take the variable data, if you remember\nthe formula that we had talked about,\n\n137\n00:07:57,004 --> 00:08:00,968\nvariable data, plus known hashing\nalgorithm equals fixed output.\n\n138\n00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,045\nNot output of the data in encrypted form.\n\n139\n00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:08,780\nBut output of a bit stream that represents\nintegrity, proof of origin of that data.\n\n140\n00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,270\nIn the sense that we know that\nthe data as a frozen moment in time.\n\n141\n00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,140\nA snapshot of that data at\nthe moment the hash is taken,\n\n142\n00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,355\nthat the data does not modify.\n\n143\n00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:19,390\n>> Yeah, any change in that file is\ngoing to invalidate that signature.\n\n144\n00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,160\n>> It's going to change it.\n\n145\n00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,480\nWe did a nice little demo Don and\nI where we actually.\n\n146\n00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,130\nWe did some hashing in real time and\nwe showed the different hash outputs, and\n\n147\n00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,360\nthen we modified Starbuck's and\nmade it Starbuck's right?\n\n148\n00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,145\nWe saw the difference in\nthe outcome of that MD5 hash.\n\n149\n00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,950\nSo that's what we're talking about.\n\n150\n00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,457\nIt was actually, it was very nice.\n\n151\n00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:38,130\nIt set us up for a good coffee break\nafter we get done with our sessions.\n\n152\n00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,790\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nthat the digital signature right?\n\n153\n00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:46,800\nAs I said, created by encrypting a hash\nof a message with a private digital key,\n\n154\n00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,830\nthe private key of the sender.\n\n155\n00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,460\nSo we are going to hash and\nthen we're going to take that hash and\n\n156\n00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,700\nwe're going to encrypt the hash.\n\n157\n00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,670\nSo we're going to take the proof\nof origin, proof of integrity.\n\n158\n00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,020\nIt really is Mike.\n\n159\n00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,670\nWe're going to take that proof.\n\n160\n00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,310\nWe're going to encrypt that output so\nwe're going to do the hash.\n\n161\n00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,300\nWe're gonna encrypt the hash,\nnot encrypt the data.\n\n162\n00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,930\nDigital signatures are not\nabout confidentiality.\n\n163\n00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,230\nWe're not encrypting the message.\n\n164\n00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,100\nWe do that separately, by the way, right?\n\n165\n00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,170\nBut we're not doing that.\n\n166\n00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,560\nWe're encrypting the validation of\nproof of origin of the message.\n\n167\n00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,770\nAnd then we're gonna send that along\nwith the message we tend to tag it on.\n\n168\n00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,990\nAnd when we do that,\n\n169\n00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,110\nwhen you unencrypt the hash with\nthe key that will unencrypt it, and\n\n170\n00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,130\nwe'll show you a graphic of this in a\nsecond, and you then validate the hash, we\n\n171\n00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,530\nknow that the sender has validated in our\nmind if it is legitimate proof of origin.\n\n172\n00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,310\nWe know it is.\n>> So\n\n173\n00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,580\nwe're really getting\ntwo things out of that.\n\n174\n00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,250\nWe're getting integrity because we know\nthat message hasn't been modified.\n\n175\n00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,820\nAnd we're getting\nthe non-repudiation because we\n\n176\n00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,960\ncan tie the identity of the creator or\nsender.\n\n177\n00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,780\n>> Proof of origin or non-repudiation\nas well as integrity, correct.\n\n178\n00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,280\nSo, We're going to digitally sign.\n\n179\n00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,970\nSo let's take a look.\n\n180\n00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,810\nIf we can pull up that diagram.\n\n181\n00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,240\nProbably a good point\nto take a look at that.\n\n182\n00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,660\nOr a good place to take a look at that and\nsee what's going on there.\n\n183\n00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,942\nSo it looks-\n>> Is that big enough?\n\n184\n00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:57,450\nDo you want me to zoom in at all?\n\n185\n00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,526\n>> Maybe if we can zoom in just a tad,\nright?\n\n186\n00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:00,643\nAnd okay.\n\n187\n00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,620\nMaybe not quite so much.\n\n188\n00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,370\nMove it over just a tad to the left.\n\n189\n00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,627\nThere we go.\nMaybe just a little bit.\n\n190\n00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:08,362\nPerfect there we go.\n\n191\n00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:10,240\nAll right and now you guys can see it.\n\n192\n00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,100\nWe can see it and so when we talk about\nit we're actually all looking at the same\n\n193\n00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,770\nthing which is always important.\n\n194\n00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,892\nWe never wanna ad lib when we're\ntalking about how something works.\n\n195\n00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:19,090\nAll right, so, on the left side,\n\n196\n00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,090\nas you know in all over diagrams we have\nthe sender sitting over there, right?\n\n197\n00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,170\nSo, there we go, right there,\nlittle blue underline.\n\n198\n00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,270\nAnd, so, the sender,\nlet's focus on the sender side first,\n\n199\n00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,350\nbecause we talked about the fact that\nthe sender is going to be responsible for\n\n200\n00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,530\nmaking sure we create the initial hash.\n\n201\n00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,390\nAnd then encrypting that has\nto send out to the receivers.\n\n202\n00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,080\nSo we got a couple of steps we\nwant to work on over there.\n\n203\n00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,040\nSo we start with plain text, and\nwe'll see the plain text there.\n\n204\n00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,430\nThe plain text as you can see,\nthe sender will create.\n\n205\n00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,510\nWe have the initial message.\n\n206\n00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,400\nMaybe it's the standard\nmessage we were talking about,\n\n207\n00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,780\nthe dog is blue, or whatever it is.\n\n208\n00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,930\nAnd good theme since we chose blue for\nthe color.\n\n209\n00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,480\nSo we'll go with the dog is blue.\n\n210\n00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,930\nSo we got the dog is blue\nas our plain text message.\n\n211\n00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,230\nNotice that coming down directly\nfrom the plain text going.\n\n212\n00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,630\nDown in a column like form,\nthere's we create that little blue line.\n\n213\n00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,140\nWe see a hash being created.\n\n214\n00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,590\nAnd now we know what the hash is and\nhow it's done, so\n\n215\n00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,950\nwe run that through our hashing solution,\nuse our hashing algorithm.\n\n216\n00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,960\nIf it was MD5 for instance,\nwe would get our 128-bit output,\n\n217\n00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,750\nif it was a SHY1 solution\nwe'd get a 160-bit output.\n\n218\n00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,110\nAnd so we will do our hash.\n\n219\n00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,300\nWe get what's called\nthe digest down there.\n\n220\n00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,360\nThe digest, which is the output of the\nhash, the message digest, what we call it,\n\n221\n00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,500\nwill then be encrypted on the bottom.\n\n222\n00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,490\nNotice we are encrypting that, right?\n\n223\n00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,200\nSo we're taking the hash,\nwe're no gonna encrypt the hash.\n\n224\n00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,810\nAnd notice who's key we are encrypting\nit with, the sender's private key.\n\n225\n00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,700\nBecause, again,\nto remind you the sender creates the hash,\n\n226\n00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,300\nencrypts the hash with their private key.\n\n227\n00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,710\nWe don't worry about anybody un-encrypting\nit, anybody that wants to un-encrypt it,\n\n228\n00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,890\nas we find out on the other side, will be\nable to do so with the senders public key.\n\n229\n00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,930\nRemember, this is proof of origin,\n\n230\n00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,040\nnot confidentiality where we're\nmasking the actual data itself.\n\n231\n00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,400\nSo we're gonna encrypt with the sender's\nprivate key to encrypt the hash.\n\n232\n00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,410\nThat is the digital signature\nthat is formed there in the box.\n\n233\n00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,060\nThe digital signature is then\nattached to the plain text message.\n\n234\n00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,650\nNotice, probably want to go the other way,\nright?\n\n235\n00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,380\n>> You switched it around, yeah.\n\n236\n00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,230\n>> The right idea with\nthe arrow going the wrong way.\n\n237\n00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,400\nAnd so the idea here, and the reason\nwe labeled it plain text here, and\n\n238\n00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,720\nnotice you do not see cypher\ntext anywhere in this diagram,\n\n239\n00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,140\nis that we're not encrypting\nthe data as we said.\n\n240\n00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,580\nWe're encrypting the association of\nthe data with the user, the hash.\n\n241\n00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,910\nAnd so we send that message as plain text.\n\n242\n00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,060\nWe send it out across the divide.\n\n243\n00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,750\nThe receiver on the other end gets\nthe plain text, as you can see.\n\n244\n00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,750\nAnd that plain text has the signature\nas well as a hash associated with it.\n\n245\n00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,700\nSo what the receiver does is\nthe receiver goes out and\n\n246\n00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,610\ngets the sender's private key.\n\n247\n00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,630\nWherever they get that from.\n\n248\n00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,600\nAgain, typically they'll get\nthat from the public key server.\n\n249\n00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,540\nThen they get that from the directory\nwhere the public key is stored,\n\n250\n00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,740\nwherever that is generically.\n\n251\n00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,830\n>> They get that public key, right?\n\n252\n00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,490\n>> The public key, right.\n\n253\n00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,790\nPublic key, and they'll have what,\n\n254\n00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,490\nwe refer to this as a keychain,\nthe PGP solution, calls it.\n\n255\n00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,480\nYou have your keychain,\n\n256\n00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,700\nyour public keychain, where you basically\nhave your public digital signature keys.\n\n257\n00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,290\nSo we're gonna have\nthat digital signature.\n\n258\n00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,730\nWe're gonna un-encrypt the hash\nby using the sender's public key,\n\n259\n00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,090\nas you can see there.\n\n260\n00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,870\nAnd the sender's public key will then be\nused to decrypt that digital signature,\n\n261\n00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,340\nwhich goes and gets us the message\ndigest effectively, The hash.\n\n262\n00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,030\nAnd so what we're gonna do on that first\npart as you're coming down that column.\n\n263\n00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,398\nRight where you put the blue arrow, and\nwe're kind of stopping right there.\n\n264\n00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:37,189\nTo the left of the crosshairs is we now\nhave the original digest that was sent\n\n265\n00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:38,540\nfrom the sender.\n\n266\n00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,010\nWe now have un-encrypted that.\n\n267\n00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,140\nSo those two can actually be\nconnected like that if you wanna\n\n268\n00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,915\nthink of it that way.\n\n269\n00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:43,755\n>> Those two would be the same.\n\n270\n00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,150\n>> Absolutely correct, they should be.\n\n271\n00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,860\nObviously if they're not\nthen we have a problem.\n\n272\n00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,050\nAt that point we stop and say well we\ngotta go back and start over again.\n\n273\n00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,320\nSo they should be the same.\n\n274\n00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,460\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n275\n00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,900\nAnd so now what we can do.\n\n276\n00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,240\nThe second part of this is we\ncould take that plain text,\n\n277\n00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,580\nwe can run it through a hashing algorithm.\n\n278\n00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,350\nObviously using the same\nhashing algorithm.\n\n279\n00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,625\nSo it's important to know what\nhashing algorithm was used.\n\n280\n00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,880\nWe'll run it through a hash on our\nside ourselves, as the receiver.\n\n281\n00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,060\nAnd if we come up with the same digest,\nthe same output of the hash, and\n\n282\n00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,245\nthat's where the comparison,\nthe bi-directional arrow comes in.\n\n283\n00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:19,795\nIf we see the same thing,\nthen effectively what we get at the bottom\n\n284\n00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:22,655\nis we get non-repudiation and\nproof of origin.\n\n285\n00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,315\nWe know that in this\ncase Mike could not have\n\n286\n00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:28,390\npossibly claimed that he did not\nsend it because we know he did.\n\n287\n00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,500\nAnd I got the message that was intended\nfor me because I got it from him and\n\n288\n00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,250\nthe data has not been modified in transit.\n\n289\n00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,380\nSo we have the integrity that\nwe've been calling out and\n\n290\n00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,850\ntalking about along with proof of origin.\n\n291\n00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,446\nSo two very important things here.\n\n292\n00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:43,360\n>> As long as I kept my\nprivate key safe and\n\n293\n00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,130\nI'm the only one with that key then\nthat message had to come from me.\n\n294\n00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,910\n>> The logic would be sound right.\n\n295\n00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,690\nWe would assume.\n\n296\n00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,470\nThere's always that little\noff in the corner case where\n\n297\n00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,100\nsomebody does impersonate you.\n\n298\n00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,300\nSo you can keep your key secure.\n\n299\n00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,230\nRemember we wanna make this clear.\n\n300\n00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,270\nYou and I actually were having\nthis conversation around PKI right\n\n301\n00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,820\nbefore we got started with this,\nwhich is, where do those keys live?\n\n302\n00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,420\nWhat are they?\nHow do we secure them?\n\n303\n00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,780\nWhere do we find them?\n\n304\n00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,840\nSo you could do everything you should\ndo as a user to keep your key secure.\n\n305\n00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,215\nBut if you let somebody, and this is kind\nof semantics, is keeping the key secure\n\n306\n00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:20,525\nmean that if you give your login away and\nsomebody gets on that it's not secure?\n\n307\n00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:23,695\nTechnically the key is secure,\nyour login is now insecure.\n\n308\n00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,765\nBut because the two are tied together\nin a single sign on solution,\n\n309\n00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:30,395\nmost LDAP based directories today we\ntend to just think of this generically\n\n310\n00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,835\nas a single sign on directory provider.\n\n311\n00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:37,180\nSo today when you login once and access\nmany through single sign on, in effect,\n\n312\n00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,340\nthe front door to keep that key secure\nis actually validating the user.\n\n313\n00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,000\nIf Mike were to allow somebody to get\nto his machine, maybe walked away,\n\n314\n00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,630\ndidn't lock out the desktop,\nwas already logged in, and we could then\n\n315\n00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,310\nopen Outlook or whatever the mail client\nwas, send mail, it doesn't really matter.\n\n316\n00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,928\nFor the Unix users out there,\nPine or something like that.\n\n317\n00:15:56,928 --> 00:16:00,893\nAnd so whatever we're doing, if we get\ninto that mail client, and we then can\n\n318\n00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:05,224\nsend, and literally in many of these mail\nclients, additional senders are nothing\n\n319\n00:16:05,224 --> 00:16:09,189\nmore than either a little check box, a\nlittle button And we click to just add to\n\n320\n00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:13,410\nin effect the outgoing message because of\nthis nice graphical interface we have.\n\n321\n00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,050\nWe don't have to go through the trouble\nof crafting one and attaching it.\n\n322\n00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,160\nThe way we did it in the old\nschool days when we had to do it\n\n323\n00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,530\noff of the command line.\n\n324\n00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,980\nRight?\nSo that was a fun class, and\n\n325\n00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,240\nwe'd teach hacking classes, and it was\nall command line, and we would actually\n\n326\n00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,610\nshow you how to create these things\nfrom a command line interface, and\n\n327\n00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,080\nshow you how to manipulate them.\n\n328\n00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,130\n>> MD5 Compute if I remember right?\n\n329\n00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,210\n>> Well, something like MD5 compute,\nbut you know,\n\n330\n00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,230\nwhen we would use like send mail or\nsomething, right?\n\n331\n00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,125\nAnd so\nyou would be in a command line buffer.\n\n332\n00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,970\n[LAUGH] To see how some\nof this stuff works.\n\n333\n00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,220\nBoy.\nthere's a lot of thought.\n\n334\n00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,860\nWhen you do a SMTB or\n\n335\n00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,470\nSMTP connect to a mail system from\nthe command line, and so you're basically\n\n336\n00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,840\nmanipulating the mail system using\nthe command shell which can still be done.\n\n337\n00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,870\nRight?\nSo this is old-school stuff.\n\n338\n00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,130\nThis is first-generation,\nto use our firewall episode lingo, but\n\n339\n00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,870\nthis is 1-G emailing, but we will do\nthis for them, and you still can.\n\n340\n00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,710\nI teach this in my hacking classes.\n\n341\n00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,480\nWe go in and\nwe show you how to use an EHLO, a HLO or\n\n342\n00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,380\nan EHLO,\nan extended HLO command from a buffer.\n\n343\n00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,900\nAnd so basically in a command show\nyou're connected to a mail system and\n\n344\n00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,970\nyou're manipulating the mail system.\n\n345\n00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,590\nI can write an entire email right out\nof on the command line, upload it and\n\n346\n00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,860\nnever see a graphical interface.\n\n347\n00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,610\nI could do digital signatures and\nall that stuff from there.\n\n348\n00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,050\nSo this can actually\nbecome somewhat involved.\n\n349\n00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,950\nBut we make it nice for\nyou guys these days.\n\n350\n00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,950\nWe give you graphical interfaces.\n\n351\n00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,820\nWe give you pretty pictures.\n\n352\n00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,110\nWrite a drawing up for it.\n\n353\n00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,680\nSo we make it simple, right?\n\n354\n00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,950\nSo the idea here, ultimately is,\nto get back to the point,\n\n355\n00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,250\nand Mike raised a very good point.\n\n356\n00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,870\nI just wanted to drill down on it for\na minute to make it clear for\n\n357\n00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,240\nyou that keeping that key secure\nis the key, is the lynchpin.\n\n358\n00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,140\n>> Yes.\nIt really is.\n\n359\n00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,250\n>> No pun intended there, but it is the\nlynchpin around the whole system because\n\n360\n00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,000\nif the integrity of that\nprivate key is compromised\n\n361\n00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,830\nthen in effect we have no way of knowing\nwho's on the other end of that system.\n\n362\n00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,890\n>> No.\n>> We don't know.\n\n363\n00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,630\nAnd we'll never know,\nby the way, unless they tell us,\n\n364\n00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,030\ncause there's just no\nway to figure it out.\n\n365\n00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,180\nSo that's really the crucial\npart about digital signatures.\n\n366\n00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,200\nThat we want to make sure we're clear on\nthis because this is gonna help us to\n\n367\n00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,300\nunderstand everything.\n\n368\n00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,140\nCan we erase all the marks made, and\njust basically clean it up one more time?\n\n369\n00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,970\nLet everybody look at that for\njust a second or\n\n370\n00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,620\nso, without all of our notations on there.\n\n371\n00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,670\nSo, hopefully this graphic helps\nyou to get a better sense of how we\n\n372\n00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,480\nincorporate hashing with\ndigital signatures.\n\n373\n00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,040\nTo be able to go through\nlook at this information,\n\n374\n00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,510\nthe use of the senders private\nkey in the public key pair.\n\n375\n00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,420\nThe asymmetric keys being used to\neffectively create integrity and\n\n376\n00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,450\nnon reputiation what we call proof or\norigin and so\n\n377\n00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,140\nthis is what we're talking about and\nwhat we want to do on this is\n\n378\n00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,325\ngo from digital signatures, we want to\nkind of build on this a little bit, right?\n\n379\n00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:43,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n380\n00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,730\nwe talked about providing non-repudiation,\n\n381\n00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,880\nwe talked about the ability to be able\nto do that when we're sending email, but\n\n382\n00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,100\nwhat about digitally signing other things,\nlike files for instance, right?\n\n383\n00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,740\n>> RIght.\n>> We see a lot of digital\n\n384\n00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,460\nsignatures being used or\ncertificate identity.\n\n385\n00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,630\nWhich will lead us into PPI here in\na couple of minutes being used on\n\n386\n00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,900\nsource files for software, for instance.\n\n387\n00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,000\nSo, drive files,\n\n388\n00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,820\nlibrary files being signed by vendors\nto validate where they come from.\n\n389\n00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,780\nMicrosoft.\n\n390\n00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,800\n>> Windows is now requiring it for\na lot of their-\n\n391\n00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,590\n>> And windows eight, for\n\n392\n00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,850\ninstance 8.1, absolutely.\n\n393\n00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,660\nAnd we had an issue with some of\n\n394\n00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,450\nthe worms that have been released in the\nMiddle East over the last couple of years.\n\n395\n00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:26,490\nYou know, this is more of the government\ncyber warfare kind of stuff, but flame for\n\n396\n00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,360\ninstance, one of the big worms that was\nreleased that was doing all of this\n\n397\n00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,880\nsystem burrowing and finding files and\ndoing stuff in Iran and\n\n398\n00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,375\nin some of these other countries that\nwe may or may not have been targeting.\n\n399\n00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,330\n'Cause there's been no official\nacknowledgement although there is\n\n400\n00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,060\nunofficial clear, unofficial evidence\nof that that we were behind all this.\n\n401\n00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,010\nBut flame and\nsome of these other ones are using\n\n402\n00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,180\nmanipulated digital signature files for\nvendors like Microsoft.\n\n403\n00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,770\nThis was a huge issue when\nit all came to light.\n\n404\n00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,020\nBecause they effectively took\nover the Windows update solution,\n\n405\n00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,080\ncreated a fake Windows update proxy and\n\n406\n00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,950\neffectively as a result were able\nto spoof digital signatures,\n\n407\n00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,030\nfooling the machines that were targeted\nwith this malware into downloading and\n\n408\n00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,260\nthinking it was a legitimate package\nbecause digital signatures have been\n\n409\n00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,730\nmanipulated on these files to make it look\nas if it was valid coming from a vendor.\n\n410\n00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,780\nSo, this is the ultimate in masquerading.\n\n411\n00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,240\nWe would generically call\nthis a masquerade attack.\n\n412\n00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,410\nBut, it was a very complex,\nvery, very involved and\n\n413\n00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,295\nvery well executed, well thought-out\nattack because we find out after\n\n414\n00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:35,715\nthe fact that this had been going on for\nseveral years.\n\n415\n00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:38,355\nAnd this was running amuck and\nkinda the underground\n\n416\n00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:42,195\nof where these systems were being targeted\nand power plants and places like that.\n\n417\n00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:43,655\nAnd it didn't really get caught.\n\n418\n00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:45,565\nNobody knew about this for some time.\n\n419\n00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:49,780\nSo digital signature usage really\nflows through almost every area.\n\n420\n00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,400\nEvery digital entity that we\ntouch on today is some way or\n\n421\n00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,000\nform using this with machines, with user\nidentities, we said, with source files.\n\n422\n00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,716\nJust about any good thing of today that\nhas a digital footprint, probably has\n\n423\n00:21:01,716 --> 00:21:05,661\na digital signature associated with it to\nsomehow validate identity in one form or\n\n424\n00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:06,500\nanother.\n\n425\n00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,420\nSo having said that let's talk about how\nthat identity actually get's validated.\n\n426\n00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,230\nLet's look at the signature\npiece a little more broadly and\n\n427\n00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,130\ntalk about the certificates\nassociated with digital signatures.\n\n428\n00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,340\nProbably a good place.You know\nlet's start with some notes.\n\n429\n00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,450\nI think you and I put together\na little hit list of some things from\n\n430\n00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,420\na vocabulary stand point.\n\n431\n00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,090\nAnd we have a network model for\nyou for later.\n\n432\n00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,180\nA little preview of what's\ncoming up at a later episode..\n\n433\n00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,520\nRight?\nAll right, so.\n\n434\n00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,440\n>> Spoiler alert.\n\n435\n00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,910\n[LAUGH]\n>> We have a gift card for\n\n436\n00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,730\nanybody that can reproduce that\ndiagram exactly as you saw it\n\n437\n00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,430\nwithin that two second blurb.\n\n438\n00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,650\nIn the chat room with colors\nbefore the end of this episode\n\n439\n00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,740\nwe'll have a gift card for you.\n\n440\n00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,540\nAll right?\n\n441\n00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,610\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n442\n00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,420\nlet's talk about some of the vocabulary\nassociated with certificates and\n\n443\n00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,540\ncertificate authorities,\nand PKI more broadly.\n\n444\n00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,960\nAnd we will by doing that\nextend the concept out and\n\n445\n00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,310\ntalk about the structure of digital\ncertificates and go through all that.\n\n446\n00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,890\nSo this idea of PKI of public key\ninfrastructure is this idea of\n\n447\n00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,910\nbuilding this digital infrastructure\nthat supports the issuance,\n\n448\n00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,520\nsupports the usage of and ultimately the\nrevocation of what we call the entire life\n\n449\n00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,880\ncycle of digital certificates to be\nable to create digital identity.\n\n450\n00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,700\nAnd so PKI is all about creating\n\n451\n00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,980\nthe infrastructure that allows us to\nmanage the digital certificate life cycle.\n\n452\n00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,110\nIs really what it's about.\n\n453\n00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,220\nIt's about managing the life\ncycle from creation\n\n454\n00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,160\nall the way to revocation\nof digital identity.\n\n455\n00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,710\nSo digital certificates.\n\n456\n00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:30,700\nAnd so, we do have several components\nthat make up a PKI solution.\n\n457\n00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,000\nWe have of course digital certificates.\n\n458\n00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,060\nWe'll come to those at the bottom,\nwe didn't add them in, so\n\n459\n00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,010\nI want to talk about them separately.\n\n460\n00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,710\nBut let's talk about the architecture\nspecifically, the pieces, if you will,\n\n461\n00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,620\nof the puzzle that are servers.\n\n462\n00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,820\nWhether they are physical or\nvirtual is really not important right now.\n\n463\n00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,043\nThey can be either by the way.\n\n464\n00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:47,679\n>> Right.\n\n465\n00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,760\n>> Used to be years ago these\nwere physical servers we built.\n\n466\n00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,000\nToday more often than\nnot they are virtual and\n\n467\n00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,700\nthey are included at least in\nthe Microsoft world anyway.\n\n468\n00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,370\nThis infrastructure is all\nincluded right inside you're\n\n469\n00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,770\nroute Windows operating system.\n\n470\n00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,480\nYou have the capability to add\nit as a role and or feature.\n\n471\n00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,450\nBecause we need the web server as well so\nwe add the feature and the role.\n\n472\n00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,860\nBut, we basically have the ability to do\nthat when we create either a domain and\n\n473\n00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,850\ndo it as a stand alone.\n\n474\n00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,230\nWe'll come to that in a minute.\n\n475\n00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,500\nOr, excuse me, in domain we do it as\nan enterprise, rather, or I should say, or\n\n476\n00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,580\na stand alone where we do it just\non our own on an isolated server.\n\n477\n00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,040\nWe have it build right in\nto the operating system.\n\n478\n00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,240\nWe've had that since MP4.\n\n479\n00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,940\nSo it's been there for some time, and, of\ncourse in Linux and UNIX, we can do this\n\n480\n00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,010\nas well by adding certificate services in,\ncompiling that and putting it up as well.\n\n481\n00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,870\n>> Just as a side note,\nwhy do you think it's taking so long?\n\n482\n00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,650\nIt seems to me like the last few years,\n\n483\n00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,060\ncertificates have really come into\nplay a lot more in different places.\n\n484\n00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,700\nIs it because of the complexity\nof what it took to set up\n\n485\n00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,990\nthe infrastructure in the first place,\n\n486\n00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,610\nor were we not that worried about\nsecurity back in the NT days?\n\n487\n00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,565\n>> Oh, we shouldn't say that.\n\n488\n00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:48,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the unspoken secret, right?\n\n489\n00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,140\nThat's like Voldemort, you're not\nsupposed to mention his name for\n\n490\n00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,350\nfear of invoking him, right?\n\n491\n00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,230\n>> Oh, okay.\nGotcha, gotcha.\n\n492\n00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,940\n>> So\n>> I think it's a really,\n\n493\n00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,500\nactually it's a very great question,\na very good observation.\n\n494\n00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,551\nBut that's probably, it is, and it's an\nopinion question in the sense that we may\n\n495\n00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:02,426\nnot really be able to\nauthoritate an answer it, but\n\n496\n00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:03,833\nI think it's a good thought process.\n\n497\n00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:07,204\nAnd I think thinking about why\nit's become so important today,\n\n498\n00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:10,699\nand why it has not been a focus up\nuntil now, at least in my opinion is\n\n499\n00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,526\nThat I think we've made it,\nnot easier because it's always been easy.\n\n500\n00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:16,766\nIf you understood how to\ndo it it was never hard.\n\n501\n00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:18,936\n>> Right.\n>> But I think we made the business,\n\n502\n00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:21,900\nthe leap in the mind of the end user and\nbusiness.\n\n503\n00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,500\nThose two leaps came\ntogether around value and\n\n504\n00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,310\nvendors understood that if they get\ncould authenticate and provide identity.\n\n505\n00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,890\nThat they could then, digital identity,\nin such a way that they validate and\n\n506\n00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,610\nshow that this was really theirs.\n\n507\n00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,896\nThey have a market advantage, right.\n\n508\n00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:37,150\n>> Right.\n>> They're competitively advantageous,\n\n509\n00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,880\nin terms of their\npositioning in the market,\n\n510\n00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,270\nbecause now we can weed out the\ncompetitors that are falsely representing\n\n511\n00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,615\nthemselves as having content that may or\nmay not work with our products.\n\n512\n00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:48,570\nWhereas when we do this we\nauthoritatively stamp our solution and\n\n513\n00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,860\nsay we're certifying them.\n\n514\n00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,430\nSo I just think it's more\nof that than anything else.\n\n515\n00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,068\nIt's the almighty dollar\nis what it [CROSSTALK]\n\n516\n00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:54,218\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n517\n00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:54,899\n>> At the end of the day.\n\n518\n00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:56,410\nAll right so let's go back to our list.\n\n519\n00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,430\nLet's talk about what that is and\nlet's go through this.\n\n520\n00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,010\nSo, the certificate authority is gonna be,\nas you can see there, issuing and\n\n521\n00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,720\nverifying digital certificates.\n\n522\n00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,240\nWe're to take a look at the structure\nof digital certificates here in just\n\n523\n00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,330\na couple of minutes.\n\n524\n00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,300\nThe types of CAs.\n\n525\n00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,870\nTypes of certificate authorities.\n\n526\n00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,820\nWe have a stand alone CA.\n\n527\n00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,940\nThis is gonna be in a work group,\ntypically just on its own,\n\n528\n00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,010\nnot a member of a domain.\n\n529\n00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,400\nWe just wanna make that clear.\n\n530\n00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,650\nSo this is not gonna be a domain member.\n\n531\n00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,860\nAnd then we will have an enterprise CA.\n\n532\n00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,671\nAn enterprise CA will be\na member of a domain,\n\n533\n00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:27,860\nso we wanna make sure we know that.\n\n534\n00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,215\nAnd then,\na root CA is going to be the parent,\n\n535\n00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:38,050\nif we think of parent-child hierarchies,\nit is where all of the initial\n\n536\n00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,790\nwork is done to setup\nthe certificate architecture.\n\n537\n00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,550\nWe have to have at least one root for\nevery PKI solution we build.\n\n538\n00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,580\nAnd then that root, that parent,\n\n539\n00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,670\nis gonna typically issue subordinate CA\ncertificates to several subordinates,\n\n540\n00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,865\nseveral children, or grandchildren\nthat go down the list hierarchically.\n\n541\n00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:58,170\nThen that root CA disappears, meaning\nwe don't tend to talk to it anymore,\n\n542\n00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,110\nit's usually kept offline, and\n\n543\n00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,070\nonly made available when we have\nto bring a new subordinate online.\n\n544\n00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,690\nBecause if you can access and\ncompromise a root CA,\n\n545\n00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,702\nevery certificate issued under that\nhierarchy has now become suspect.\n\n546\n00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:10,480\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> And so\n\n547\n00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,170\nthis was one of the big concerns\nwith Flame, for instance,\n\n548\n00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,510\nwhere if Microsoft really had been\nthe subject of an attack that\n\n549\n00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,450\ninvalidated their route CAs around\ndigitally signing Windows updates.\n\n550\n00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,145\nImagine the chaos that could\nhave caused

00:26:35,000\nSo that could have been a big issue.\n\n556\n00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,324\nIt would have taken more than just\na single reboot to fix, right.\n\n557\n00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:38,710\n>>

00:26:44,340\nSubordinate's gonna be a child if we\nthink about the root as being the parent.\n\n561\n00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,850\nSubordinate will be a child to the root.\n\n562\n00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,210\nVery important to make that connection.\n\n563\n00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,580\nAnd it will issue certificates,\nbut not to subordinates.\n\n564\n00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,830\nAlthough, it can if we have a child,\ngrandchild.\n\n565\n00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,620\n>> Right.\n>> But typically,\n\n566\n00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,520\nwhat we see subordinates doing is\nissuing certificates to end users, or\n\n567\n00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,595\nto end points, let's say, users or end\npoints, because it can issue to a machine.\n\n568\n00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:04,660\n>>

out, kind of,\n\n571\n00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,775\nwhat the architecture looks like, right.\n\n572\n00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We then have an RA,\n\n573\n00:27:13,140 -->

today.\n\n585\n00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,140\nSo we want to make sure\nwe understand that.\n\n586\n00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,410\nAnd that we know what\nthe x.509 standard is.\n\n587\n00:27:53,410 -->

00:28:02,730\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nthe structure of the x.509 v3 certificate\n\n590\n00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,421\nhere in just a second.\n\n591\n00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:04,950\n>>

that are\navailable to us in operating systems like\n\n594\n00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,260\nWindows, have x.509 v3\ncertificates associated with them.\n\n595\n00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,350\nWe do have some older v2 templates that\nare still there from a legacy perspective,\n\n596\n00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,695\nbecause we may use those older ones.\n\n597\n00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:20,330\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Right,\n\n598\n00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:25,980\nwe may have some v1s going all of the way\nback, but typically we see v2 and v3.\n\n599\n00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,920\nBut, if you're ever asked about\nwhat the current standard is for\n\n600\n00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,270\nany reason, we want to make\nsure we reference x.509 v3.\n\n601\n00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,122\nThat would be the proper way to\napproach answering that question.\n\n602\n00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:37,310\nAll right, so having said that,\nlet's take a look quickly.\n\n603\n00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,495\nI think we have a web graphic,\nright, that we're going to bring up.\n\n604\n00:28:39,495 --> 00:28:40,296\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> That,\n\n605\n00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:44,840\nwe're gonna zoom in a little bit\nthanks to Microsoft Tech Net here.\n\n606\n00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,990\nAnd we're just gonna take a quick look\nat what the structure of the certificate\n\n607\n00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,780\nlooks like.\n\n608\n00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,930\nSo if you were to look at the certificate,\nthe x.509 v3 certificate, and\n\n609\n00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,160\nlooked at the header information\nin the certificate itself,\n\n610\n00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,770\nthis is exactly what we're gonna see.\n\n611\n00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,710\nThe structure, we're gonna see version, as\nyou can see there, followed by going down,\n\n612\n00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,760\nand we're going to do or\nsee a certificate serial number there.\n\n613\n00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,830\nWe're going to see a certificate\nalgorithm identifier,\n\n614\n00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,740\nthat helps us to understand who\nthe issuer of the certificate is.\n\n615\n00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,010\nIs it Verisign?\n\n616\n00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:13,516\nIs it RSA?\n\n617\n00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:15,225\nIs it whoever, right, we don't know.\n\n618\n00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:16,295\n>> Right.\n>> Could be Thawte.\n\n619\n00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:17,405\nThere's a lot of different issuers.\n\n620\n00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:19,925\nSo we're gonna see the algorithm\nassociated with it and\n\n621\n00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,495\nthen the issuer itself, right.\n\n622\n00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:22,965\nTwo very important pieces.\n\n623\n00:29:22,965 --> 00:29:24,725\nHow long is the certificate good for?\n\n624\n00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:26,315\nThe validity period is gonna be there.\n\n625\n00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:30,035\nThe subject, what is this particular\ncertificate gonna be good for?\n\n626\n00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,265\nWhat is it used for?\n\n627\n00:29:31,265 --> 00:29:33,735\nIs it digitally signing email,\nis it signing files?\n\n628\n00:29:33,735 --> 00:29:35,381\n>> Right.\n>> Is it a machine certificate?\n\n629\n00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:37,150\nWhat are those things.\n\n630\n00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,800\nWe're gonna see the subject\npublic key information, so\n\n631\n00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,510\nthe subject public key information.\n\n632\n00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,780\nWho is the public key owner?\n\n633\n00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,010\nIn other words, right, who's the owner\nof record, that kind of thing.\n\n634\n00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:51,700\nThe issuer unique ID and subject unique ID\nand extensions, notice those are optional.\n\n635\n00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,230\nMay or may not have those in there.\n\n636\n00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,830\nAll the stuff in orange,\nby the way, is mandatory.\n\n637\n00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,570\nYou will definitely see those things.\n\n638\n00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,908\nYou may not see the things in blue.\n\n639\n00:29:57,908 --> 00:30:01,650\nAnd then notice down below\nthe CA's digital signature itself.\n\n640\n00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,890\nWhich is going to be the CA,\nthe certificate authority signing, to\n\n641\n00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,890\nvalidate the identity of this certificate\nas having been issued by the CA.\n\n642\n00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,160\nThis is how we create what is\nknown as the trust path, right.\n\n643\n00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,020\n>> Path or chain.\n\n644\n00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,840\n>> The chain of trust or the web of trust.\n\n645\n00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,000\nBut ultimately, that certificate path\nthat can be traced from the issuer,\n\n646\n00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,290\nall the way through from\nthe root to the subordinate, and\n\n647\n00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,230\nthen ultimately down to the end user or\nthe end point that has it.\n\n648\n00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,520\nSo we could see that chain\nall the way down, and\n\n649\n00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,100\nvalidate the integrity\nof that certificate.\n\n650\n00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,305\nAbsolutely correct, right.\n\n651\n00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:29,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n652\n00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,530\nso you on, as an endpoint user,\ncan go in a pull up any\n\n653\n00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,685\nof these certificates that are stored\nin your Internet Explorer cache.\n\n654\n00:30:35,685 --> 00:30:36,480\n>> Yeah.\n>> For instance, right.\n\n655\n00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,660\nWe have them in there,\nin the security tab underneath options.\n\n656\n00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,220\nYou can take a look at the certificate\nstore, you can load an MMC and\n\n657\n00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,100\nlook at your certificates\nlocally on the machine as well.\n\n658\n00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,040\nSo you could just create\na Microsoft Management Console.\n\n659\n00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,480\nMike's just going to go quickly in there,\nto the certificate area, and\n\n660\n00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,590\nshow you one there.\n\n661\n00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,150\nAnd you know, randomly, whichever one\nit is, we bring it up and we zoom in.\n\n662\n00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,295\nWe can see there,\nthat we have all this information, right.\n\n663\n00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:03,383\nSo who it was issued to,\nwhat it was issued for, the availability.\n\n664\n00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:07,750\nWe can look at certification path exactly,\nand see it comes from Verisign.\n\n665\n00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,040\nAnd we can look at the details.\n\n666\n00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,400\nAnd on the details tab,\n\n667\n00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,890\nwe actually would see all that\ninformation that we just talked about.\n\n668\n00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,660\nGoing down the fields, that's the header\ninformation we want to focus on.\n\n669\n00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,330\nAnd that's all the information.\n\n670\n00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:19,990\nIt is there.\n>> Yeah, it is there.\n\n671\n00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,117\n>> It's up top. It is there.\nThat's the stuff that we want to make sure\n\n672\n00:31:22,117 --> 00:31:22,832\nwe're aware of.\n\n673\n00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:24,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that we focus on.\n\n674\n00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,720\nSo making sure we understand what's on\nthat details tab will be important.\n\n675\n00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,260\nAnd we can go in and\nopen up a Management Console, as well.\n\n676\n00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,610\nAs I mentioned.\nWe're not gonna do that,\n\n677\n00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,950\nbut maybe a little assignment for you to\ntake a look at at some point on your own.\n\n678\n00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,750\nIf you're not familiar with how to load\nan MMC, right, just the Windows run line.\n\n679\n00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,300\nSo you know, Windows r, Windows key\nletter r, type MMC at the run line.\n\n680\n00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,510\nGet a blank shell.\n\n681\n00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,490\nGo in and add the snap in for\n\n682\n00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,010\nthe certificate authority there or\nthe local certificate store rather.\n\n683\n00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,495\nAnd you'll see the certificate\nstored on your local machine.\n\n684\n00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,256\n>> Yep.\n>> If you're doing this in Windows.\n\n685\n00:31:54,256 --> 00:31:55,434\nIf you're doing it in Linux,\n\n686\n00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:58,590\nyou have to access the certificates a\nslightly different way, but you can still\n\n687\n00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,052\nsee the certificates that are loaded there\nby using the appropriate management tool.\n\n688\n00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:02,975\nSo, just be aware of that and\n\n689\n00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:04,868\nmake sure you're comfortable\nwith that as well, right.\n\n690\n00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:06,504\n>> Very good ,very good.\n\n691\n00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:09,604\nAlright, so we've done the structure\nof the certificate and\n\n692\n00:32:09,604 --> 00:32:13,700\nwe showed you kind of what's in there,\nwe define the overview of what PKI is.\n\n693\n00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,110\nWhen we come back in our next episode,\nwhat we're going to do, or\n\n694\n00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,525\nrather in our next segment I should say,\nin this episode.\n\n695\n00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:20,685\nWhat we're gonna do is ultimately\nwe're gonna come back and\n\n696\n00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:21,875\ntake a look at a graphic.\n\n697\n00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,525\nThe actual visual representation of PKI.\n\n698\n00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,305\nMike's done a nice diagram for\nus, so we'll take a look at that.\n\n699\n00:32:27,305 --> 00:32:30,255\nHe's gonna play tour guide and walk us\nthrough that and do some drawing for\n\n700\n00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:31,540\nus as we narrate through it.\n\n701\n00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,210\nAnd then we'll finish up discussing\nall the digital signature dos and\n\n702\n00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,270\ndon'ts just about managing PKI,\nand when we're done with that,\n\n703\n00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,030\nwe'll have some more interesting\nstuff to talk about.\n\n704\n00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:44,065\nSo please come back and join us, and\nwe'll look forward to seeing you soon.\n\n705\n00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:51,150\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n706\n00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,350\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n707\n00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,640\nSo back into some PKI with us, for\nthis next little segment here.\n\n708\n00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,770\n>> Absolutely.\n\n709\n00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,380\nHowdy everybody.\n\n710\n00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,400\n>> How's it going out\nthere in digital land?\n\n711\n00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,410\nHopefully everybody's having a good day.\n\n712\n00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,200\nAnd, you know,\nwhen we talk about digital stuff,\n\n713\n00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,720\nwe have been talking about digital\nidentity, we've been talking about PKI in\n\n714\n00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,870\nour last segment and\ntalking about digital infrastructure.\n\n715\n00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,030\nJust wanted to remind you of where we are\nas we're moving back to this material to\n\n716\n00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,827\nmake sure we're finishing up, but\nalso looking backwards a little bit to\n\n717\n00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:22,760\nmake sure we're on target with all\nthe stuff we're talking about.\n\n718\n00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,470\nWe were talking about PKI a little bit.\n\n719\n00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,910\nAnd we were talking about this\nidea of digital identity,\n\n720\n00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,420\nwhat a public key infrastructure\nsolution looks like.\n\n721\n00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:33,860\nWe're gonna actually put the graphic up\nand show you the diagram of a PKI network\n\n722\n00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,440\nor a network solution here\nin just a couple of minutes.\n\n723\n00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,370\nBut maybe an overarching definition,\njust to remind ourselves of that\n\n724\n00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,350\nI think we have some stuff in the notes\nwe can just quickly throw back up, right?\n\n725\n00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,020\nSo if we put the notes back up,\nwhat we can see is we had defined for\n\n726\n00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,070\nyou what the building blocks\nof a PKI solution were.\n\n727\n00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,870\nWe have the certificate of authority\nsitting up there, we have the different\n\n728\n00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,690\ntypes of CAs, the standalone, the\nenterprise, the root, and the subordinate.\n\n729\n00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,290\nWe have our registration authority\nthat allows us to be able to\n\n730\n00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,600\nvalidate identity of requesters.\n\n731\n00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,320\nWe have our directory, LDAP Base, that's\ngonna be where we see keys being managed.\n\n732\n00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,650\nAnd then we have digital certificates\nin the form of an x.509 v3 and\n\n733\n00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,170\nwe went through and showed you what all\n\n734\n00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:19,360\nof the structure of those certificate\nfields were in the details.\n\n735\n00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,540\nAnd then we summarized for\nyou what does PKI provide?\n\n736\n00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,700\nYou know, it provides these five areas.\n\n737\n00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,960\nProvides confidentiality.\n\n738\n00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,720\nProvides access control,\nintegrity, non-repudiation, right.\n\n739\n00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,520\nProof of origin is what we often refer to\nwith non-repudiation, and authentication.\n\n740\n00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,650\nSo, of the [COUGH] three\npillars that we deal with,\n\n741\n00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:45,570\ntypically, in the building blocks that we\nalways keep referring to of information\n\n742\n00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:50,980\nsecurity management, confidentiality,\nintegrity and A for availability.\n\n743\n00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,300\nWhat we don't see here is\nthe availability, right?\n\n744\n00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,970\nWe see A's, we see access control,\nwe see authentication, but\n\n745\n00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,510\nwe're not focusing on availability.\n\n746\n00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,950\nSo two of the three pillars\nof the iron triangle, or\n\n747\n00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:06,110\nthe AIC triad are found here but\nnot that availability one.\n\n748\n00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:10,000\nJust remember this is about validating\nwho we are and what we're sending\n\n749\n00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,790\nmaking sure it gets from point A to point\nB without being modified in transit.\n\n750\n00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:18,680\nThis not about making sure that the data\nis available at all times, that's done,\n\n751\n00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,160\nbut it's done in other\nareas with other systems.\n\n752\n00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,850\n>> RIght.\n\n753\n00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,760\n>> So that's just something to\nremind you of as we get into this.\n\n754\n00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,350\nNow when we kinda laid the ground work\na little bit, just look backwards,\n\n755\n00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,400\nlet's look forwards.\n\n756\n00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,250\nSo, let's take a look at this graphic.\n\n757\n00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,340\nHopefully this one will be as\ninteresting as some of the others\n\n758\n00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,080\nwe've put together there for you.\n\n759\n00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,930\nSo, what you'll see down here is we have\nsome end pointdevices, you know a tablet,\n\n760\n00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,690\na couple of laptops,\nit doesn't really matter what they are.\n\n761\n00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,300\nThey're out there and\nthey're coming in through the internet so\n\n762\n00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,650\nwe're going to see our cloud,\nright traditionally represented there.\n\n763\n00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,250\nThey're gonna register in other words and\n\n764\n00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,251\nlook to use PKI from\noutside of our network.\n\n765\n00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,910\nWe actually could easily move\nthem over inside the network.\n\n766\n00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,380\nWe're not gonna do that on the diagram but\n\n767\n00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,480\nwe easily could see them inside it\nwould work the same way by the way.\n\n768\n00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,540\nReally no difference.\n\n769\n00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,320\nWe come through our firewall.\n\n770\n00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,020\nAgain, our firewall with no fire on it.\n\n771\n00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,880\nIt's a brick wall.\n\n772\n00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,260\nIt happens to be a firewall.\n\n773\n00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,350\nBut, you can see we have\nour firewall there.\n\n774\n00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,810\nDown below, as the traffic comes in,\nyou'll see the first stop there,\n\n775\n00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,980\nis that we come in, and\nwe hit the registration authority.\n\n776\n00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,640\nAnd the RA,\n\n777\n00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,570\nthe Registration Authority, is gonna be\nwhere we actually see the authentication.\n\n778\n00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:27,330\nWho is this user, is this a valid user,\nis this a valid endpoint?\n\n779\n00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,010\nYou know, how do we know it's really Mike,\nor really Adam, and\n\n780\n00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,340\nnot really Don impersonating one of us,\ncuz I've heard Don likes to do that.\n\n781\n00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,670\nSo may or may not be that, so\nwe just wanna be aware of that.\n\n782\n00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,940\nAnd then as we come through,\nnotice that the RA,\n\n783\n00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,810\nthe registration authority, will talk\nto the subordinate CA in this case.\n\n784\n00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,290\nThe subordinate CA is going to be,\nthe certificate authority.\n\n785\n00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,820\nRemember that is a child in our parent\nchild hierarchy of the root CA.\n\n786\n00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,960\nIn this case we have a enterprise\nroot CA that it is talking to.\n\n787\n00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,380\nRemember the enterprise root CA\ntypically will not be online.\n\n788\n00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,490\nNot be available, not be approachable,\nand may be online, right, but\n\n789\n00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,800\nit's usually kept offline.\n\n790\n00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,390\nA lot of times these things are actually\nbuilt on laptops with removable media, so\n\n791\n00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,310\nyou take the hard drive out of the laptop,\nor out of a desk top, if it's built on\n\n792\n00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,260\na desktop computer, the hard drive\nis put away and stored in a vault.\n\n793\n00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,330\nAnd that secured infrastructure is only\nthen made available and brought online\n\n794\n00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,940\nwhen we have to reissue certificates to\nbring new subordinates CA's online, or\n\n795\n00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,410\nrenew them because we may have to renew\nthem after a period of time when they\n\n796\n00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:34,200\nare invalidated because of the life cycle,\nthe TTL on that certificate is expired.\n\n797\n00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,900\nSo we may not really see\nthe enterprise root CA,\n\n798\n00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,040\nwhat we call a line available here.\n\n799\n00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,780\nIt may be, it may not be, it just really\ndepends on the choices the architects made\n\n800\n00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,580\naround this environment, but we'll see\nthe RA talking to the subordinate CA.\n\n801\n00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,990\nThe subordinate CA may have a reason to\ntalk to the enterprise rooted, may not.\n\n802\n00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,290\nBut typically it talks\nto a domain controller.\n\n803\n00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,540\nYou can see over there\na directory server of some kind.\n\n804\n00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,460\nAnd keep in mind in Windows the CA\nis gonna be on a domain controller,\n\n805\n00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,980\nmore often than not,\nif it is a enterprise integrated CA.\n\n806\n00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,010\nIt's gonna be sitting, typically,\non a domain controller,\n\n807\n00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,890\nso this box roll would actually be one and\nthe same.\n\n808\n00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,290\nThe RA would effectively be\ntalking to the subordinate CA and\n\n809\n00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,030\nin the domain control all in one.\n\n810\n00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,410\nBut if it's a stand alone, it may not be.\n\n811\n00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,150\nIt's obviously gonna be separate.\n\n812\n00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,430\nAnd so\nwe just wanna keep that in mind, but\n\n813\n00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,840\nthe idea here is that we're\ngonna talk to the RA.\n\n814\n00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,730\nThe RA talks to the CA.\n\n815\n00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,410\nThe CA and the domain controller\nwill exchange information\n\n816\n00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,310\nto make sure that we\nunderstand who the user is,\n\n817\n00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,690\nwho the endpoint is,\nget all the stuff done that we need to do.\n\n818\n00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,430\nAnd then ultimately we will then\nallow that endpoint, or that user or\n\n819\n00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,600\nsome combination.\n\n820\n00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,030\nTo be issued a certificate,\nyou could see it down there.\n\n821\n00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,430\nRemember that certificate\ntype will be X.509v3,\n\n822\n00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,120\nour current standard for\ndigital certificates.\n\n823\n00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,580\nThat certificate transits and makes its\nway from the subordinate CA at the top,\n\n824\n00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,750\nback through to the endpoints, right?\n\n825\n00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,840\nWherever that is over there, somewhere.\n\n826\n00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,970\nAnd is then gonna registered one or\nmore of those endpoints, and\n\n827\n00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,990\nstored in the local certificate store.\n\n828\n00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,710\nBut then, there's a copy of registration,\ncopy of that stored in the CA as well\n\n829\n00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,000\nto validate the certificate and\nunderstand that it's been issued properly.\n\n830\n00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,120\nWe then to the left there,\nhave a certificate revocation list, a CRL.\n\n831\n00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,890\nThat CRL is going to be made available.\n\n832\n00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,900\nNow, old school PKI would've\nhad that CRL being downloaded\n\n833\n00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,880\nas a spreadsheet CSV kind of document.\n\n834\n00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,450\nWhere we would have to manually see\nthat and manually go through the list.\n\n835\n00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,190\nThis and understand which\ncertificates work or were not active.\n\n836\n00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,890\nSo a CRL in the old school, would have\nbeen a manually intensive process or\n\n837\n00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,990\na person intensive process.\n\n838\n00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:41,270\nThese days we use the online\nsecurity certificate protocol.\n\n839\n00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,270\nTo be able to validate this automatically.\n\n840\n00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:47,041\nSo we're not actually going out and doing\nthis ourselves, but rather we are now\n\n841\n00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:50,249\nusing just an automated process\nwhen a certificate is presented for\n\n842\n00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:52,629\nauthentication at\nthe registration authority.\n\n843\n00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:53,907\nOn the way into the network,\n\n844\n00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:56,893\nthe online certificate security\nprotocol is going to check that,\n\n845\n00:39:56,893 --> 00:40:00,266\nmake sure that we validate whether\nthe certificate is still active or not.\n\n846\n00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:03,635\n>> So it checks it against the CRL\nin an automated fashion for us.\n\n847\n00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:07,567\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe are in real time checking the validity,\n\n848\n00:40:07,567 --> 00:40:09,010\nas well as the TTL.\n\n849\n00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,830\nThe authenticity of a life\ncycle of that certificate.\n\n850\n00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,450\nNow certificates can be revoked for\na variety of reasons.\n\n851\n00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,390\nCertificates may be revoked simply\nbecause they've expired, right?\n\n852\n00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:22,210\nThey've just gone missing in a sense\nbecause the TTLs ticked down to zero.\n\n853\n00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,840\n>> They're not a permanent assignment or\nanything, right?\n\n854\n00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,990\n>> No, they could be temporary, right?\n\n855\n00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,685\nSo for a period of time.\n\n856\n00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:28,270\nBut we do have a TTL assisted\nwith all certificates.\n\n857\n00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,000\nI remember a funny story about\na customer of mine that had this happen.\n\n858\n00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,370\nSo I do a lot of, in the field,\nwork with the customers.\n\n859\n00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,920\nWe talk about architecture setup,\nnetworks, things like that.\n\n860\n00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,780\nHelp them build solutions and mentor them,\n\n861\n00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,120\nand help them to understand\nhow to do this stuff.\n\n862\n00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,410\nAnd so I was working with one customer,\nand we went through,\n\n863\n00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,930\nwe set up an exchange solution,\ndirectory based in Windows,\n\n864\n00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,380\nset up OWA [INAUDIBLE] web access,\nset up a PKI for them.\n\n865\n00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,650\nDid the whole nine yards, got everything\nup and running, I mean, it was great.\n\n866\n00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,500\nIt was all running, checked in with\nthem a few times, everything's good.\n\n867\n00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,810\nAnd I told them when we\nset this up specifically,\n\n868\n00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,730\nI said listen, here's the deal, right?\n\n869\n00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:07,070\nYou gotta watch the clock on these things\nbecause these certificates expire,\n\n870\n00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,790\nif you don't pay attention,\nyou can have a problem.\n\n871\n00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,180\nAnd I told him exactly what would happen,\nand I said remember we set a TTL of one\n\n872\n00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:19,680\nyear on the certificate that is tied\nto your web directory to provide OWA.\n\n873\n00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,080\nSo you gotta pay attention\nbecause 11 months from now and so\n\n874\n00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,440\nmany days if you don't renew this\nthing you're gonna have a problem.\n\n875\n00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,840\nSo sure enough I don't hear from them for\na year and\n\n876\n00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,400\nit was literally down to the day alright?\n\n877\n00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,250\nI'm in California on\nbusiness when this happens.\n\n878\n00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,430\nSo I'm a east coast guy right.\n\n879\n00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,990\nI'm on the west coast,\n\n880\n00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,910\nI remember it clearly because I got\nthe phone call at three o'clock\n\n881\n00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,730\nin the morning west coast time, and\nI get a phone call on my cell phone.\n\n882\n00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,260\nWakes me up out of a sound sleep in my\nhotel room I was there I was getting ready\n\n883\n00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,220\nto do a speaking engagement so I was gonna\npresent at one of the security conferences\n\n884\n00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,050\nthat I speak at and\n[COUGH] I get a phone call.\n\n885\n00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,250\n3 o'clock in the morning,\n6 o'clock East coast time.\n\n886\n00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:05,086\nThese guys call me, not in a panic, but\ncalled me and said hey listen, basically,\n\n887\n00:42:05,086 --> 00:42:06,820\nkinda here's the deal.\n\n888\n00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,350\nThis is what happened and what do we do?\n\n889\n00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,120\nHow do we fix it?\n\n890\n00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,170\nAnd, so, you know, three o' clock in the\nmorning, you know, I'm a little groggy.\n\n891\n00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,530\nI wasn't thinking clearly,\nI hadn't had my espresso yet so\n\n892\n00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,280\nI wasn't as sharp as I might have been.\n\n893\n00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,960\nBut you know it's a very\nsimple fix actually and\n\n894\n00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,900\nit's very easy to tell\nthem what to do right?\n\n895\n00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,710\nAfter I said you gotta be kidding me.\n\n896\n00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,240\nWe talked about this,\nyou actually let this happen.\n\n897\n00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,581\nSo after we had that conversation.\n\n898\n00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:32,474\n>> One thing you had to do.\n\n899\n00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:33,870\n>> Right.Only one thing you had to do.\n\n900\n00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,920\nWatch the button.\n\n901\n00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,540\nPress the button when it turns red right?\n\n902\n00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,530\nSo you didn't press the button but\nthe one thing you had to do.\n\n903\n00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,350\nSo we had that conversation but\nhere's how you fix it.\n\n904\n00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,340\nIt's very simple.\n\n905\n00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,020\nYou gotta go in, issue a brand new\ncertificate, pick your timeline,\n\n906\n00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,300\nmaybe a year, two years, whatever, but\n\n907\n00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,970\nissue the certificate and simply re-import\nit and apply it to the directory.\n\n908\n00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,320\nAnd so I stood on the phone with them,\nwalked them through it,\n\n909\n00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,480\nliterally three minutes right?\n\n910\n00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,310\nFive minutes probably, because I was\nbabbling, because I was so tired.\n\n911\n00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,050\nAnd they were up and\nrunning with no trouble.\n\n912\n00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,490\nSo it's not that it's\nnecessarily very hard, right?\n\n913\n00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,590\n>> Right.\n>> But if you let it expire it can be\n\n914\n00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,670\na bit of a problem,\nbecause as you know, or\n\n915\n00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,770\nif you haven't had it happen\nyou will find out if you do.\n\n916\n00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,490\nAll email stops when you\ndon't have that certificate.\n\n917\n00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,980\n>> Yep.\n>> Nothing's flowing through the server,\n\n918\n00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,210\nthe email is there,\nit's being cached, right?\n\n919\n00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,990\nIt was in the system, nobody could get\nto it because you couldn't authenticate\n\n920\n00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,830\nthe fact that the email was coming from a\nvalid end point, so just be aware of that.\n\n921\n00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,910\n>> Wow.\n>> That could be the unlooked for\n\n922\n00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,355\noutcome if you're not paying attention.\n\n923\n00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:28,348\n[LAUGH] So the CRL is very important.\n\n924\n00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:29,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because we\n\n925\n00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,860\ncan expire certificates by accident,\n\n926\n00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,520\nwithout paying attention to TTL's,\nwe may expire them on purpose, by the way.\n\n927\n00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,320\nWe may go in and say, Mike is\na customer of mine, maybe if Mike and\n\n928\n00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,830\nI are in a business relationship and\n\n929\n00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:44,440\nMike is buying services from me,\nmaybe a cloud based provider.\n\n930\n00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,900\nSo in some sort of a SAS an IS or\na Pass model, right?\n\n931\n00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,130\nSo software as a service, infrastructure\nand, or platform as a service.\n\n932\n00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,180\nIf Mike is buying those services from me,\nand I'm issuing them to him and\n\n933\n00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,700\nit's a pay as you go model, in effect.\n\n934\n00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,640\n>> Right.\n\n935\n00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,770\n>> And Mike hasn't paid his bill then I\nmight disallow those certificates I might\n\n936\n00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,950\njust simply revoke them because Mike\nno longer has access to those services.\n\n937\n00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,560\n>> Right and you can't reach out and pull\nthem back from the actual certificate.\n\n938\n00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,270\n>> No, no I can't not legally not without\nhacking into your system and doing things\n\n939\n00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,210\nI'm not suppose to do cause we're not\nsuppose to do those things boys and\n\n940\n00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,420\ngirls that would be illegal.\n\n941\n00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,420\nSo absolutely correct we shouldn't\nreach out and pull those back.\n\n942\n00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,800\n>> So instead what we do is simply\nturn them off in effect and\n\n943\n00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,665\nthat's what a CRL is all about.\n\n944\n00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:29,932\nSo there's lots of reasons\nwhy we may wind up on a CRL.\n\n945\n00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:34,090\nSo understand that is\nthe authoritative list\n\n946\n00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:38,850\nfrom the root CA supporting CA's\nperspective as to what is allowed and what\n\n947\n00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,392\nis not allowed based on the availability\nor the denial of that certificate.\n\n948\n00:44:43,392 --> 00:44:45,090\nThat's the critical thing.\n\n949\n00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,520\nSo whether you set this up in Windows,\nwhether you set this up in Linux,\n\n950\n00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,580\nwhat I would recommend you to do is not\nnecessarily go out as a touchpoint,\n\n951\n00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,020\nas an knowledge point here,\naround engaging this information.\n\n952\n00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,020\nTo maybe go out and build one.\n\n953\n00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,460\nI think it would be great if you did,\n\n954\n00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,730\nand I think there's absolutely no\ndownside to you installing the CA.\n\n955\n00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,240\n>> And seeing how it works.\n\n956\n00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,010\nBut instead of maybe building one\non your own, cuz you may or may not\n\n957\n00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:11,010\nbe in a position to do that, at a minimum\ngo out, do a little digging online.\n\n958\n00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,550\nCertainly this is a good starting point.\n\n959\n00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,100\nYou've got a lot of good content here.\n\n960\n00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,130\nSpent a lot of time painting a picture for\nyou.\n\n961\n00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,460\nMaybe you wanna read a TechNet article or\n\n962\n00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,330\nsome sort of article on Google just\nabout the nuts and bolts here.\n\n963\n00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:24,130\nMaybe you wanna take a look\nat this content, review it.\n\n964\n00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,690\nMaybe there's another piece of\ninformation you wanna add in, but\n\n965\n00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,750\njust make sure you have a good thorough\nunderstanding of how all these moving\n\n966\n00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,800\nparts come together as you start\nto prepare for the SSCP exam.\n\n967\n00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,380\nThese are the kinds of\nconceptual ideas and\n\n968\n00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,020\nthe tracking pieces that you're gonna be\nasked about at some level in some form.\n\n969\n00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,390\nYou wanna be able to bring that knowledge\nforcefully and properly into the exam so\n\n970\n00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,570\nyou can execute on success the first\ntime around, that's very important.\n\n971\n00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,220\nSo we've gone through this whole idea\nof PKI, talked about what it is,\n\n972\n00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,320\nwhat it provides.\n\n973\n00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,200\nYou know, we talk about key generation and\ngenerating the keys, and\n\n974\n00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,150\nobviously making sure that\nthis is a closed process.\n\n975\n00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,320\nManaging the certificates and the keys.\n\n976\n00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,980\nKeeping them secure in\na directory of some kind.\n\n977\n00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,930\nLocking them down, as Mike talked about,\nnot letting people near them.\n\n978\n00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,600\nThat's obviously very important.\n\n979\n00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,070\nKeys have to be, you now,\ncreated randomly.\n\n980\n00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,465\nRandomness is a very important part\nof the the key generation process.\n\n981\n00:46:16,465 --> 00:46:21,660\nIf there's any sameness, any pattern, we\ncan discern in that key space, you know,\n\n982\n00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,840\nthen we're gonna have a problem there.\n\n983\n00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,780\nPeople are gonna start finding those.\n\n984\n00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,520\n>> Predictability, yeah.\n\n985\n00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,384\n>> We get predictability, we get\npattern matching, right kind of thing.\n\n986\n00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:29,335\nGood for horse racing.\n\n987\n00:46:29,335 --> 00:46:29,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Bad for\n\n988\n00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,670\nkey generation, just to be clear.\n\n989\n00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,110\nAlright so schedule, right,\nperiodic cryptographic key changes,\n\n990\n00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,430\nright, change out those keys.\n\n991\n00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,920\nWe talked about TTL.\n\n992\n00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,320\nSome best practice thoughts as we're\nwrapping this part of our conversation up.\n\n993\n00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,800\nIn summarizing, don't allow those\nkeys to sit out there forever.\n\n994\n00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,660\nThe reason I gave those guys a one\nyear TTL in their certificate\n\n995\n00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,780\nis that you don't want it\nsitting out there for too long.\n\n996\n00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,390\nRight?\nFIve, 10, 20 year TTLs are okay\n\n997\n00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,320\nas long as you don't ever plan on anybody\nother than you using that certificate.\n\n998\n00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,500\nBut if you got a lot of\npeople interacting with it,\n\n999\n00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,770\na 20 year TTL is just unrealistic.\n\n1000\n00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:04,410\nOf course,\n\n1001\n00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,310\nwhen you tell that to Microsoft about\ntheir core you get no response, right?\n\n1002\n00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,530\nNo, we'll just make it as long as we want.\n\n1003\n00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,320\nWe don't care.\n\n1004\n00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,830\nSo, you look at those certificates,\nthey're good for 30 years,\n\n1005\n00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,630\nwhich is just nuts.\n\n1006\n00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> You look at some of their roots,\n\n1007\n00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,320\nthey're just, it's nuts.\n\n1008\n00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,495\nThey're out there for 20, 30 years.\n\n1009\n00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:18,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, all right, so\n\n1010\n00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,990\nthen obviously, figuring what\nthose certificates are used for.\n\n1011\n00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,120\nAlso key recovery when we're\ntalking about key escrow or\n\n1012\n00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,740\nkey recovery good point or\ngood thing to raise here and\n\n1013\n00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,070\nthink about that,\nlike any good system we have information,\n\n1014\n00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,558\nif we don't back it up its not worth\na heck of a lot to us if we lose it.\n\n1015\n00:47:33,558 --> 00:47:36,860\nSo we gotta come up with a way to do\nthe key escrow, the key backup, and\n\n1016\n00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,620\nthe key restore if we need to.\n\n1017\n00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,720\nI mention that MMC,\n\n1018\n00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,400\nthat Microsoft Management Console that can\nbe used to do the certificate authority.\n\n1019\n00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,060\nSo you want to make sure to look at\nthe certificate authority rather then\n\n1020\n00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,490\nto look at the certificates store locally.\n\n1021\n00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,500\nYou can actually back your certificates\nup there and restore them if you need to.\n\n1022\n00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,085\nSo just be aware of that, right?\n\n1023\n00:47:54,085 --> 00:47:57,285\nObviously the more the key is used,\nthe more it's exposed, the more likely\n\n1024\n00:47:57,285 --> 00:47:58,857\nit is we want to swap that out\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1025\n00:47:58,857 --> 00:48:00,216\n>> On a more aggressive basis.\n\n1026\n00:48:00,216 --> 00:48:04,080\nWe could use hardware for key storage, so\ntrusted hardware comes into play here.\n\n1027\n00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,536\nWe may have the ability to be able\nto use smart cards, the USB tokens,\n\n1028\n00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,860\nwe talked about some of those things.\n\n1029\n00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:14,630\nYou know, my Microsoft ID,\nmy badged ID that I use as a VTSPM,\n\n1030\n00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,640\na virtual technology specialist\nin the field for Microsoft.\n\n1031\n00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,650\nSo in that role, I have a Microsoft ID.\n\n1032\n00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:24,180\nAnd so, that Microsoft ID\nas a badge has a smart card\n\n1033\n00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,490\nchip associated with it on the back.\n\n1034\n00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:28,620\nI've got an embedded identity document\nthere with my certificates and\n\n1035\n00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,900\nall the stuff I need.\n\n1036\n00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,650\nMilitary and government CAC cards,\n\n1037\n00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,150\nsmart cards that are used to access\ngovernment resources are this way.\n\n1038\n00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,860\nWe, in one of our prior episodes,\ntalked about smart cards' contact list,\n\n1039\n00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,390\ncontact based memory cards,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1040\n00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,661\nSo those kind of things\ncould be used to store.\n\n1041\n00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:46,939\nCertainly we don't really\nsee disks anymore, but\n\n1042\n00:48:46,939 --> 00:48:52,222\nUSB based media, a flash drive\nof some kind, SSD, an SD card.\n\n1043\n00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:55,330\nAny of these things are potentially\ngonna be able to be done.\n\n1044\n00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,776\nYou could even store these in secure\nstandalone desktops if you wanted to.\n\n1045\n00:48:57,776 --> 00:48:58,995\n>> [INAUDIBLE] smart cards now,\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n1046\n00:48:58,995 --> 00:48:59,796\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n1047\n00:48:59,796 --> 00:49:01,556\nYep, yep, absolutely, right.\n\n1048\n00:49:01,556 --> 00:49:02,480\nSo that's really great.\n\n1049\n00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,310\nAnd we could do any\nvariety of those things.\n\n1050\n00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:08,220\nSo also remember that we have the ability\nto not only store the key successfully,\n\n1051\n00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,890\nbut also to manage the keys over the life\ncycles we've been talking about and\n\n1052\n00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,540\nwe wanna make sure we understand\nthe idea of encrypting the keys and\n\n1053\n00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,620\nwhat do we mean by that?\n\n1054\n00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,980\nYou have two different ways of encrypting.\n\n1055\n00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,840\nWe can do link encryption,\nthis idea of encrypting and\n\n1056\n00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,140\ndecrypting on a link by link basis as we\nsend and receive the keys back and forth.\n\n1057\n00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,450\nThere's a lot of overhead involved in\nthese sessions, so we have to understand\n\n1058\n00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,693\nevery session gets basically its\nown encryption/decryption scenario.\n\n1059\n00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,430\nWanna make sure we think about that.\n\n1060\n00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,800\nWe could also use what's\ncalled end-to-end encryption.\n\n1061\n00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,130\nRight?\nEnd-to-end encryption lets us do something\n\n1062\n00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,440\nlike using a KDC, a key distribution\ncenter with Kerberos, for instance.\n\n1063\n00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,930\nWe often hear about the KDC\nspoken about with Kerberos.\n\n1064\n00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:50,102\nAnd so link encryption versus\nend-to-end encryption, where\n\n1065\n00:49:50,102 --> 00:49:54,329\nKerberos is being used to encrypt all the\ntraffic transiting through the system, and\n\n1066\n00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:57,909\nwe apply the certificate and\nof course the keys, the Kerberos tickets,\n\n1067\n00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:01,926\nwhich are effectively the keys, the\nsession keys that are being applied there.\n\n1068\n00:50:01,926 --> 00:50:04,341\nThey are going to be changed, however.\n\n1069\n00:50:04,341 --> 00:50:08,985\nThey're changed based on a life cycle,\nI think by default we get a seven day plus\n\n1070\n00:50:08,985 --> 00:50:12,940\none session life cycle there,\nso it's seven and a half days.\n\n1071\n00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,240\nThe ticket is gonna be good for\nup to that amount of time.\n\n1072\n00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,130\nIt may be good for less,\nyou may modify that.\n\n1073\n00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,030\nSo there's different ways\nto think about that but\n\n1074\n00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,172\nbasically the idea is that you wanna make\nsure you understand the different ways\n\n1075\n00:50:23,172 --> 00:50:26,420\nwe could engage in encryption\naround key management.\n\n1076\n00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,690\nThat's just the takeaway that we wanna\nmake sure we're comfortable with here.\n\n1077\n00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,970\nAnd so having said that, right, kind of\nwrapping up our PKI conversation, I know\n\n1078\n00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,665\nyou've kind of just previewed it there\nbriefly, cuz again we had it up there.\n\n1079\n00:50:37,665 --> 00:50:38,807\n>> [CROSSTALK] not too far.\n>> And I noticed nobody took us\n\n1080\n00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:42,100\nup on our challenge in the chat room yet\nto reproduce that little network diagram.\n\n1081\n00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,120\n>> That was pretty quick.\n\n1082\n00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:43,900\n>> It was pretty quick.\n\n1083\n00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,530\nSo you might not be able to get that.\n\n1084\n00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,235\nBut just be aware of that obviously.\n\n1085\n00:50:47,235 --> 00:50:50,210\nYou'll just do things, sometimes\nthings do pop up on the screen here.\n\n1086\n00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,650\nWe do have a method to the madness and\n\n1087\n00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,140\na purpose and we're gonna put\nthat back up in just a second.\n\n1088\n00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,900\nBut what we're gonna do is transition\ninto this discussion of cryptanalysis.\n\n1089\n00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,460\nYou know, what is cryptanalysis here,\nwhat are some of the attack vectors and\n\n1090\n00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,710\nmethods that we use as we look\nat the science of cryptanalysis?\n\n1091\n00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:08,360\nThe science of cracking codes,\nbreaking codes,\n\n1092\n00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,790\nas they say, is what cryptanalysis is.\n\n1093\n00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:15,370\nCryptography is this overall idea of using\ncryptographic mechanisms to safeguard and\n\n1094\n00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:18,620\nensure information has integrity and\nproof of origin.\n\n1095\n00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,317\nThe cryptosystem is this idea of taking\nthe algorithms, putting it in and\n\n1096\n00:51:22,317 --> 00:51:26,470\nthrough the XORing solution moving\nplaintext through and creating ciphertext.\n\n1097\n00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:29,320\nCryptanalysis is defined as\nthe science of code breaking, and\n\n1098\n00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,976\nso we're gonna spend a little time here\njust talking about the different kinds of\n\n1099\n00:51:32,976 --> 00:51:34,905\nways we can break code in effect, right?\n\n1100\n00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,485\nInstead of breaking bad,\nwe're gonna break code, right?\n\n1101\n00:51:37,485 --> 00:51:39,495\nOr if you have bad code we\ncould be breaking bad code,\n\n1102\n00:51:39,495 --> 00:51:42,105\nso I guess it's almost the same\nthing in that respect, right?\n\n1103\n00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:43,575\n>> I like it.\n[LAUGH] >> All right, very good.\n\n1104\n00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:46,395\nSo let's go ahead,\nlet's put back up our notes.\n\n1105\n00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:50,370\nLet's talk about this and you know,\nwe kind of cheated a little bit and front\n\n1106\n00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:54,060\nloaded this list, because there's so many\ndifferent attack types, as you can see,\n\n1107\n00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,850\nthat we felt it was just gonna be better\nto have a running list we could talk out\n\n1108\n00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,950\nwith you, instead of poor Mike trying\nto keep up with me and type as we go.\n\n1109\n00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,529\nI took pity on him before\nwe got started here.\n\n1110\n00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:04,316\nWe went ahead and created the list, right?\n\n1111\n00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:07,741\nCuz Mike was not feeling too confident\nabout being able to execute,\n\n1112\n00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:11,300\ngetting all this information on\nthe page in the proper amount of time.\n\n1113\n00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,260\nSo let's talk about attack types, right?\n\n1114\n00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,050\nSo we have brute force attacks.\n\n1115\n00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,570\nAnd brute force attacks are gonna be,\nas the name implies, basically any and\n\n1116\n00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,030\nall combination.\n\n1117\n00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:23,490\nWe see this a lot with passwords for\ninstance, right, where we use old school\n\n1118\n00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:27,620\nsoftware, things like L0phtCrack, which\nhasn't been around for a while, they got\n\n1119\n00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,210\nbought out, L0pht Heavy Industries\ngot bought out and they disappeared.\n\n1120\n00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,765\nBut you know, attack vectors are gonna\nbe used by a variety of tools.\n\n1121\n00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:36,510\nL0phtcrack was just one password cracker.\n\n1122\n00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,300\nThere are many, many of them out there.\n\n1123\n00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,930\nBut a brute force attack just throws\neverything at the password until we\n\n1124\n00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:45,090\nfigure out what the combination is that\neffectively gives us what we need.\n\n1125\n00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:49,030\nSo just be aware of that,\nobviously the more complex the password,\n\n1126\n00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,300\nthe harder it is to execute\na brute force attack.\n\n1127\n00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,260\nAnd so that's one of the things we\nwanna consider and think about there.\n\n1128\n00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,574\nIn terms of the complexity, well, we\ndidn't know it under brute force attack,\n\n1129\n00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,646\nwe may just wanna make a quick sub-note\nthere is this idea of what's called\n\n1130\n00:53:00,646 --> 00:53:01,810\nMoore's Law.\n\n1131\n00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:08,460\nAnd Moore's law as in Gordon Moore,\nM-O-O-R-E-'-S, as in belongs to Mr. Moore.\n\n1132\n00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,710\nGordon Moore,\none of the founders of Intel,\n\n1133\n00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:16,115\nhas been credited with coming up with this\nidea of Moore's law, which is basically\n\n1134\n00:53:16,115 --> 00:53:20,760\nthat processing speed will double every\nfill in the blank so many months.\n\n1135\n00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,470\nThe original postulated law, or\n\n1136\n00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:27,160\nthe saying that led to Moore's law, was\nthat he figured it was every 18 months.\n\n1137\n00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,790\nThat's really,\nwe've seen a significant downgrade of that\n\n1138\n00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,110\nto something like somewhere\naround 12 to 9 months,\n\n1139\n00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:35,750\ngiven today's current environment and\nhow we produce technology.\n\n1140\n00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,560\nAnd that's continuing on a downward trend,\nand his plot slowed a little bit.\n\n1141\n00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,717\nIt kind of went from up here and started\ngoing down since he came out with it.\n\n1142\n00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:44,626\nAnd we kind of leveled\noff a little bit here,\n\n1143\n00:53:44,626 --> 00:53:47,979\nbut we're starting to move down again as\nwe get into some of the things you were\n\n1144\n00:53:47,979 --> 00:53:50,322\nmentioning around virtualization and\nthese ideas.\n\n1145\n00:53:50,322 --> 00:53:53,278\nAlso quantum computing,\nsubatomic computing,\n\n1146\n00:53:53,278 --> 00:53:57,850\nwhere we can really move not quite at\nthe speed of light, but close to it.\n\n1147\n00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,850\nAnd as a result,\nwe're really seeing an increase and\n\n1148\n00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,640\na force multiplier,\nto use a military term.\n\n1149\n00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,678\nWe're seeing a force multiplier in\nthe ability to do code cracking,\n\n1150\n00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:09,196\nusing some of these advanced techniques.\n\n1151\n00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:11,968\nWe're not really gonna get into\nwhat those are per se here, but\n\n1152\n00:54:11,968 --> 00:54:13,340\ncertainly very interesting.\n\n1153\n00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,232\nIf you wanna know more about it, go out\nand look for quantum computing, go out and\n\n1154\n00:54:17,232 --> 00:54:18,951\nlook for subatomic computing, and\n\n1155\n00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:22,386\nsome of these technologies that\nare being brought to bear today are just\n\n1156\n00:54:22,386 --> 00:54:25,387\nunbelievable in terms of\nthe complexity they deal with, so.\n\n1157\n00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,955\nWe're talking about Moore's Law and\n\n1158\n00:54:26,955 --> 00:54:30,750\nthis idea of just being able to double our\nprocessing power every so many months or\n\n1159\n00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,820\nevery year, year and\na half, whatever it is.\n\n1160\n00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:35,990\nAnd as a result of that, brute force\nattacks that may not have been able to\n\n1161\n00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:39,730\nhave been carried out five or ten or\nfifteen, twenty months ago, may now be\n\n1162\n00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:43,660\npossible, because the complexity of that\npassword may not stand up to the new and\n\n1163\n00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,400\napproved processing power that\nwe have available to us, right?\n\n1164\n00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,640\nI mean, we're seeing quad core processors\nin our smartphones today, right?\n\n1165\n00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,530\n>> I know, isn't it amazing?\n\n1166\n00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:55,380\n>> Snap Dragon processors on some of\nthe advanced Android platforms, right?\n\n1167\n00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,298\nAnd so when you think about a quad core\nprocessor being brought to bear in\n\n1168\n00:54:59,298 --> 00:55:03,870\na smartphone device, let alone what you\ncould potentially do in a grid environment\n\n1169\n00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,243\nwith desktops and linking them together.\n\n1170\n00:55:06,243 --> 00:55:10,062\nSo something like IBM's Watson, which is\njust this massive grid, brought together,\n\n1171\n00:55:10,062 --> 00:55:11,150\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1172\n00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,910\nYou imagine the kind of power that\nwe can bring to bear on this if we\n\n1173\n00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:14,598\nreally wanted to.\n\n1174\n00:55:14,598 --> 00:55:16,689\n>> You're really shortening that\namount of time that it's gonna take\n\n1175\n00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:17,505\nto do an attack like that.\n\n1176\n00:55:17,505 --> 00:55:20,651\nWhat it might have taken a thousand or\nmore years now takes a few months.\n\n1177\n00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,944\n>> Absolutely.\nJust go out and get a coffee, come back,\n\n1178\n00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:22,713\n[SOUND] there you are, it's all done.\n\n1179\n00:55:22,713 --> 00:55:24,270\n>> That's amazing.\n\n1180\n00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,161\n>> Call that the espresso postulate.\n\n1181\n00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:26,966\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1182\n00:55:26,966 --> 00:55:28,692\n>> All right.\nSo ciphertext only attack.\n\n1183\n00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,102\nLet's talk about ciphertext only attack.\n\n1184\n00:55:30,102 --> 00:55:33,469\nSo this idea of ciphertext only attack,\nas the name applies,\n\n1185\n00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:37,183\nyou get a sample of the ciphertext so\nwe know what the ciphertext is.\n\n1186\n00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:40,973\nAnd we don't have the plaintext,\nobviously, if we had the plaintext,\n\n1187\n00:55:40,973 --> 00:55:43,224\nwe can go home and\nstop talking about this.\n\n1188\n00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:44,562\nDon't need to worry about that.\n\n1189\n00:55:44,562 --> 00:55:47,894\nBut we obviously want to have\nthe plaintext, that's the goal, so\n\n1190\n00:55:47,894 --> 00:55:51,702\nthe ciphertext only attack is having\nthe ciphertext and then trying to run it\n\n1191\n00:55:51,702 --> 00:55:55,333\nthrough in such a way that we ultimately\noutput plaintext that matches,\n\n1192\n00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,382\nand as a result we get a hit, if you will.\n\n1193\n00:55:57,382 --> 00:56:02,557\nSo this is obviously going to be attacking\nthe algorithm, attacking the cryptosystem,\n\n1194\n00:56:02,557 --> 00:56:05,800\nattacking the way in which\nThe cipher text was created so\n\n1195\n00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,216\nif we can run it backwards through\nthe system, figure out an effective key,\n\n1196\n00:56:10,216 --> 00:56:15,070\nthen it reverse engineers and we\neffectively unlock it going the other way.\n\n1197\n00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:19,260\nSo this is obviously going to be important\nwhen the encrypted message is available.\n\n1198\n00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,540\nThis is the kind of attack\nthat we often will mount.\n\n1199\n00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,970\nSo this is kind of an interesting one,\n\n1200\n00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:26,540\nbecause we have some examples of this,\nmany, many over the years, but\n\n1201\n00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,780\nhistorically, [COUGH] during\nthe Second World War, right.\n\n1202\n00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,080\nThe resistance in France.\n\n1203\n00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,300\nSo, the Allied Armies were fighting\nagainst the Axis Powers, right.\n\n1204\n00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,470\nAnd, in Europe, so attacking and\nfighting against the Germans, right.\n\n1205\n00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:40,810\nThe Nazis at that point.\n\n1206\n00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,840\nWhen we look at that,\nthe resistance in France, in particular.\n\n1207\n00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,560\nIt was very active in\ntrying to figure out,\n\n1208\n00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,330\non the ground, prior to\nthe Allied Invasion, the landings.\n\n1209\n00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,710\nIn Normandy, and ultimately, the landings\nthat would retake Europe and hopefully end\n\n1210\n00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:55,460\nthe Second World War, at least in Europe,\nanyway, would end the Second World War.\n\n1211\n00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,570\nThey were very active, for many years.\n\n1212\n00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:01,410\nFought many battles in the sense of just\nguerrilla actions, things like that.\n\n1213\n00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:05,860\nAnd so one of the things that the French\nresistance did, was they would manipulate\n\n1214\n00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,720\nthe German army into sending messages,\nknown cypher texts, right.\n\n1215\n00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,940\nKnown plain text,\nwe're gonna talk about both.\n\n1216\n00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,670\nBut they would manipulate the German army\ninto sending certain kinds of messages\n\n1217\n00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,710\nin order to figure out what\nkind of codes were being used,\n\n1218\n00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,450\nand how to then crack the codes.\n\n1219\n00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,420\nNow we're probably a lot of us anyway are\nfamiliar with some of the discussion, and\n\n1220\n00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,790\nthe myth, and urban legends around\nCode breaking the 2nd World War.\n\n1221\n00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:30,790\n>> Right\n>> the idea of using the ultra codes.\n\n1222\n00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:31,710\nAnd we were able to go in and\n\n1223\n00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,900\ncrack the enigma\n>> huh\n\n1224\n00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,080\n>> codes using the enigma\n\n1225\n00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,840\nmachines,\n>> yep\n\n1226\n00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,960\n>> and all the things that went on.\n\n1227\n00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,610\nBut the idea here was if they got\nthe cipher text of a certain message\n\n1228\n00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,690\nthey would try to reverse engineer it.\n\n1229\n00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,940\nIf they guessed at what the message was,\nbut weren't sure, they would try to get\n\n1230\n00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:49,990\nthe Germans by manipulating them to\nrecreate a message that was similar.\n\n1231\n00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:53,190\nSee if the same kind of\ninformation came out the back end.\n\n1232\n00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:57,170\nWhen we talk about known plain text, the\nnext attack down, they did the same thing,\n\n1233\n00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:01,930\nbut what they would do, there's one\nfamous story about this where there were\n\n1234\n00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:04,490\nthe resistance would attack\nthe train networks in particular.\n\n1235\n00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:06,010\nTry to knock out the rail lines,\n\n1236\n00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:08,660\nprevent the Germans from moving\ninformation back and forth.\n\n1237\n00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,720\nAnd so what they did was they would\ngo down to the train yards and\n\n1238\n00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,870\nshoot out the light bulbs on the platform.\n\n1239\n00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,580\nAnd then the Germans\nwould have to go out and\n\n1240\n00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,780\nsend out a message you know,\nmessage of the day, here's what happened,\n\n1241\n00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,560\nhey five light bulbs shot out, replace\nfive light bulbs or whatever it was.\n\n1242\n00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,140\nSo they would choose the plain text.\n\n1243\n00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,070\nThey would know more or\nless what the Germans would send out.\n\n1244\n00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,000\n>> Right.\nThat we are manipulating the system as now\n\n1245\n00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,560\nthey saw what the cypher text was.\n\n1246\n00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,070\nAnd so they began to understand\nhow to read the messages\n\n1247\n00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:35,620\nby getting either the known plain text or\nthe next one down, the chosen plain text.\n\n1248\n00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,050\nJust different ways of\nlooking at the same thing.\n\n1249\n00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,880\nAnd so all of these are basically\nmanipulating the system around choosing\n\n1250\n00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,020\nwhat you start with and\nas a result getting the outcome and\n\n1251\n00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,840\ntrying to compare the two.\n\n1252\n00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,450\nSo.\n\n1253\n00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:47,648\nKnown plain text is you\nchoose what goes in.\n\n1254\n00:58:47,648 --> 00:58:50,160\nFor plain text you look at\nthe outcome as a result and\n\n1255\n00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,600\nyou try to match the cipher\ntext to understand the pattern.\n\n1256\n00:58:54,088 --> 00:58:58,060\nChosen plain text is where you manipulate\nwhat goes in specifically by saying,\n\n1257\n00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,700\nI'm going to encode the dog is blue.\n\n1258\n00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,180\nI'm going to encode the dog is green.\n\n1259\n00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,110\nI'm going to encode the dog is red.\n\n1260\n00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:06,990\nAnd then figuring out, ultimately,\nwhat each of those winds up being and\n\n1261\n00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:08,660\nthen comparing it again.\n\n1262\n00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:12,620\nAn adaptive chose plain text is\njust changing it as I just said.\n\n1263\n00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,580\nThe dog is blue, green, red.\n\n1264\n00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,120\nManipulating that variable\nlet's us adapt to\n\n1265\n00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,970\nfigure out what the outcome\nwill be over time.\n\n1266\n00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:21,635\nSo we have all these\ndifferent ways of doing this.\n\n1267\n00:59:21,635 --> 00:59:24,135\nChosen cipher text attack,\nagain, same thing.\n\n1268\n00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:28,332\nInstead of cipher text only,\nwhere we're given random cipher texts,\n\n1269\n00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:32,025\nchosen cipher text, we choose what\ncipher texts we're gonna work on.\n\n1270\n00:59:32,025 --> 00:59:35,270\nSo, we've chosen the output\nthat we're gonna try to attack.\n\n1271\n00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:36,910\nSo we may have a bin of messages.\n\n1272\n00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:39,840\nWe may reach in and\nfind patterns around five or six of them.\n\n1273\n00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,800\nWe may work with them and\nthink of them as a group.\n\n1274\n00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,180\nMaybe they came from the same geography,\nthe same people,\n\n1275\n00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,330\nyou know whatever that defining\ncharacteristic is that we want to address.\n\n1276\n00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:50,440\nThat kind of thing.\n\n1277\n00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,470\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n1278\n00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:54,660\nAdaptive chosen cipher text,\nagain the same concept there.\n\n1279\n00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,490\nWe adaptively choose\nthe cipher text as we go.\n\n1280\n00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,360\nJust wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n1281\n00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,510\nMan in the middle attack.\n\n1282\n01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:03,230\nThis is where we're attacking\nthe key exchange and\n\n1283\n01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,280\nperhaps the exchange of information.\n\n1284\n01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,270\nSo, we are going to try to\nput ourselves as an attacker\n\n1285\n01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,450\nbetween the parties\nthat are communicating.\n\n1286\n01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,600\nGrab that information out of\nthe communication stream.\n\n1287\n01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,910\nGet in between the sender and\nthe receiver, if you will,\n\n1288\n01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,440\nand then try to manipulate that.\n\n1289\n01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,780\nThat's what's generically called\na man in the middle attack.\n\n1290\n01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:26,770\nWe also have side channel attacks and side\nchannel attacks are going to allow us to\n\n1291\n01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:30,875\nbe able to go in and manipulate and\nlook at details in a system.\n\n1292\n01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,735\nI have two items on there,\ntiming and power.\n\n1293\n01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:38,395\nRight this idea of looking at how\nprocesses execute at the process level\n\n1294\n01:00:38,395 --> 01:00:40,760\ndown in the CPU and the memory.\n\n1295\n01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,170\nRight, that kind of thing.\n\n1296\n01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,670\nAnd if we can then read\nthe timing on a system,\n\n1297\n01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:49,500\nsee how many cycles it takes the CPU to\ncrank through an exchange of information.\n\n1298\n01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,930\nLook at how many cycles it takes\nthe memory flashing on and\n\n1299\n01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,760\noff to be able to access information.\n\n1300\n01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,550\nWe may see structural elements\nthere that can be manipulated\n\n1301\n01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:00,590\nto create buffer overflows and, things.\n\n1302\n01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,760\nPower, we look at the power\ncycling in a system.\n\n1303\n01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,750\nWe can maybe,\nperhaps find radiation emanations.\n\n1304\n01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:10,870\nWe talked a little bit about\nthe electromagnetic radiation or\n\n1305\n01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,790\nEMR in one of our prior episodes.\n\n1306\n01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,790\nAnd we talked about the idea\nof tempus shielding and\n\n1307\n01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,420\nthis idea of being able to\ncreate tharadig cages and\n\n1308\n01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:23,380\nthing like that to block those emanations\nso timing and power are the two kinds of\n\n1309\n01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,400\nside channel attacks that we wanna be\naware of, and these are the two examples,\n\n1310\n01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,840\nyou know multiple examples but these are\nthe two that are most commonly looked at.\n\n1311\n01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,290\nSo something like maybe a differential\npower analysis would be a type of a power\n\n1312\n01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:35,950\nsolution there.\n\n1313\n01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:38,730\nSo we could look at EMR, or\nthe terminated radiation, but\n\n1314\n01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:42,770\nalso differential power analysis,\nwhat's called a DPA attack.\n\n1315\n01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,270\nIt's typically what we see\nin these kind of scenarios.\n\n1316\n01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,580\nWe also have a birthday attack.\n\n1317\n01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,690\nThis is a mathematical problem, actually.\n\n1318\n01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:53,000\nThat has been turned\ninto an attack vector.\n\n1319\n01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,460\nAnd so, basically the idea here is that we\nhave what's known as the birthday paradox.\n\n1320\n01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:00,000\nThis is the mathematical problem,\nwhich then translates into the attack.\n\n1321\n01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,250\nSo let me quickly give you the birthday\nparadox, just so that we know what it is.\n\n1322\n01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,590\nSo the idea here, the question,\n\n1323\n01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:08,920\nthe paradox that the birthday attack\ntries to address is the following.\n\n1324\n01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,920\nWhat's the probability?\n\n1325\n01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,050\nJust, you wanna probably just listen.\n\n1326\n01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,300\nWe're not gonna sit here and type it out.\n\n1327\n01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,760\nWe'll encourage you to go out and\nGoogle this.\n\n1328\n01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,850\nMaybe you could quickly find it and\nwe could go out and\n\n1329\n01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:17,520\njust get a reference for it.\n\n1330\n01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,500\nBut the idea basically is this.\n\n1331\n01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,150\nProbability, what is the probability,\nin other words, right?\n\n1332\n01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:26,980\nThat two or more people in a group of\n23 people will share the same birthday.\n\n1333\n01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,450\nYou know, what is that probability, right?\n\n1334\n01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:32,300\nAnd so if we're in a room, we got 21,\nother people besides me and\n\n1335\n01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,650\nMike, in a room together.\n\n1336\n01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,160\nAnd what's the probability\n\n1337\n01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,700\nthat two people in that room\nare gonna share the same birthday?\n\n1338\n01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,800\nAnd it's greater than 50%.\n\n1339\n01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,620\nRight?\n\n1340\n01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,535\nWhen you look at the math.\n\n1341\n01:02:43,535 --> 01:02:46,482\n>> It's almost mind boggling,\nreally.When you think about it.\n\n1342\n01:02:46,482 --> 01:02:48,545\n>> Now,\nwill they share the same birthday, two or\n\n1343\n01:02:48,545 --> 01:02:52,665\nmore people, it's not easy to calculate\nbut do the math and figure it out.\n\n1344\n01:02:52,665 --> 01:02:54,775\nSo the idea with this is\nthat if we go through and\n\n1345\n01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:56,507\nwe work it out, we actually, then,\n\n1346\n01:02:56,507 --> 01:03:01,537\ncan apply that logic to finding pattern\nmatching in messages in message keys.\n\n1347\n01:03:01,537 --> 01:03:05,787\nAnd, as a result, potentially,\nfind two messages that match in a pool,\n\n1348\n01:03:05,787 --> 01:03:07,887\nbecause the key space is not big enough.\n\n1349\n01:03:07,887 --> 01:03:09,160\nAnd, as a result.\n\n1350\n01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,430\nAnd so\nthis is basically a key space attack.\n\n1351\n01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:15,980\nAs a result of that, right, we could then\ntheoretically figure out how to decrypt or\n\n1352\n01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,030\ndecode messages if the pool\nis not big enough.\n\n1353\n01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,230\nAnd so\nthe birthday attack helps us to understand\n\n1354\n01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,760\nthat this is possible if we don't\nhave big enough key spaces.\n\n1355\n01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,490\nSo just something to consider,\nto be aware of.\n\n1356\n01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,640\nBut it is another kind of attack one that\nyou may want to read up on a little bit\n\n1357\n01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,150\nand play around with the math on it.\n\n1358\n01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:33,580\nThere is some cool discussions\nout there about it.\n\n1359\n01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:37,170\nIt doesn't take long to get up to\nlike ninety nine we're at seventy.\n\n1360\n01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:40,670\nAlmost one hundred percent depending\non the number of people and\n\n1361\n01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:43,280\nhow you approach with the variables\nthat you're looking for.\n\n1362\n01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,710\nIs it the same birthday?\n\n1363\n01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:46,180\nRight, on the same day kind of thing.\n\n1364\n01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:46,990\n>> Right.\n>> We're looking for\n\n1365\n01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,770\nthe month, two different people\nrandomly will have the same birthday,\n\n1366\n01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:52,470\nversus two people that we\nidentify with the same birthday.\n\n1367\n01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:54,296\nThere's different ways to look at it,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1368\n01:03:54,296 --> 01:03:54,876\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1369\n01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:56,150\n>> All right, so going back to our notes,\n\n1370\n01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:57,976\njust a couple of other things\nwe wanted to hit on as well.\n\n1371\n01:03:57,976 --> 01:03:58,511\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1372\n01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:01,436\n>> So we had attacks on\nsymmetric block ciphers here.\n\n1373\n01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:05,754\nWe had four categories of attacks\nthat we could see being executed on.\n\n1374\n01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:09,470\nWe had differential, linear and algebraic.\n\n1375\n01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:13,250\nThese are categories of attacks.\n\n1376\n01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:16,060\nOr four types of attacks I should say.\n\n1377\n01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:21,560\nSo I gave you an example of some of\nthe attacks here, so a differential attack\n\n1378\n01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,809\nwhen we're talking about symmetric block\nciphers would be using chosen plain text.\n\n1379\n01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:28,880\nThis will be an example\nof a differential attack\n\n1380\n01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,740\nusing a symmetric block\ncipher as the target.\n\n1381\n01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:35,000\nLinear, an example of that\nwould be known plain text.\n\n1382\n01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,420\nDifferential linear is really\njust a combination of the two, so\n\n1383\n01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:39,920\nliterally chosen and\nknown plain text together, right?\n\n1384\n01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,240\nWill be used to combine.\n\n1385\n01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,502\nAnd then algebraic, there.\n\n1386\n01:04:42,502 --> 01:04:44,668\nYeah, chosen and\nknown plain text would be good.\n\n1387\n01:04:44,668 --> 01:04:45,410\n>> [INAUDIBLE] up a little bit.\n\n1388\n01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:50,520\n>> Absolutely, and then algebraic,\nthere, is gonna be accessing and\n\n1389\n01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,400\nanalyzing the underlying math, the\nmathematics associated with the algorithm,\n\n1390\n01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,400\nthe crypto-system in other words.\n\n1391\n01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,140\nAnd we're looking at that algorithm to\nbetter understand what it is that we could\n\n1392\n01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,900\npotentially find as a weakness and then\nexecuting on that weakness, in theory,\n\n1393\n01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:09,627\ndepending on what we find would be\nthe example that we would be looking for\n\n1394\n01:05:09,627 --> 01:05:11,610\nin terms of how to execute an attack.\n\n1395\n01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:15,020\nThose kind of attacks are difficult,\nthey require a very good understanding\n\n1396\n01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,000\nof high level mathematics and\nreal deep knowledge there.\n\n1397\n01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,150\nAnd we gotta have people that understand\nhow to write software that can execute\n\n1398\n01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,790\non that analysis,\ndraw out those weaknesses and\n\n1399\n01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:27,550\nthen create vulnerabilities that could\nbe attached to as a result of that.\n\n1400\n01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:30,095\nThis is kind of the deep tech stuff.\n\n1401\n01:05:30,095 --> 01:05:31,328\nRight?\nThe deep geek stuff,\n\n1402\n01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:34,204\nthis is like geek layer two,\ngeek layer three on the geek model.\n\n1403\n01:05:34,204 --> 01:05:34,704\n>> Not the script kiddies.\n>> Right?\n\n1404\n01:05:34,704 --> 01:05:35,204\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1405\n01:05:35,204 --> 01:05:35,792\n>> This is not right.\n\n1406\n01:05:35,792 --> 01:05:38,802\nThis is not for the basic point and click\n\n1407\n01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:41,952\nkids out there that are just copying.\nYou've gotta actually know your stuff to\n\n1408\n01:05:41,952 --> 01:05:44,879\nexecute an algebraic attack.\nIt's pretty complicated stuff.\n\n1409\n01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:45,979\nWe do have some other types of\n\n1410\n01:05:45,979 --> 01:05:48,700\ncryptographic attacks that we've\nlisted out there for you as well.\n\n1411\n01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,340\nWe have analytic attacks.\n\n1412\n01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,670\nThese again are just\ncategories of attacks.\n\n1413\n01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:56,090\nRSA factoring and the double DES\nattacks fall under this category.\n\n1414\n01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:58,650\nYou may wanna go out and\ndo a little follow up research on them,\n\n1415\n01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,200\nif you're interested.\n\n1416\n01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:04,300\nThe RSA factoring attack allows us to go\nour and look at how they're factoring\n\n1417\n01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:09,155\nthe combination of prime members to\nsee if there's weaknesses there and\n\n1418\n01:06:09,155 --> 01:06:10,965\nif there are they may\nbe executing on them.\n\n1419\n01:06:10,965 --> 01:06:13,495\nThe RSA was attacked over\nthe last couple of years.\n\n1420\n01:06:13,495 --> 01:06:17,065\nSome of their solutions are proven to\nbe although still very secure and still\n\n1421\n01:06:17,065 --> 01:06:20,797\nlooked at as an standard, there were some\nweaknesses that were found potentially in\n\n1422\n01:06:20,797 --> 01:06:24,577\nsome of the implementations and so this\nis the kind of thing that was being done.\n\n1423\n01:06:24,577 --> 01:06:27,365\nStatistical attacks where we look\nat weakness in the design and\n\n1424\n01:06:27,365 --> 01:06:29,687\npattern-matching in the key\nspaces in the result.\n\n1425\n01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:33,972\nAgain, this is Mathematics\n404 instead of 101 down.\n\n1426\n01:06:33,972 --> 01:06:36,588\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You've gotta have a real deep knowledge\n\n1427\n01:06:36,588 --> 01:06:38,940\nof how to do this stuff to carry\nout some of these attacks.\n\n1428\n01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:42,100\nImplementation attacks,\nthese are probably the easiest to do.\n\n1429\n01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:46,150\nThings like using WEP on a wireless\nsolution, implementing it incorrectly,\n\n1430\n01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:51,640\nnot using WPA2, but rather WPA versus WEP,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1431\n01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,890\nDo we broadcast out that information?\n\n1432\n01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:57,020\nDo we make those weak\nalgorithms our default choice?\n\n1433\n01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,460\nThose are issues we have to address.\n\n1434\n01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,870\nSo those are implementation\nissues we want to be aware of.\n\n1435\n01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:02,920\nJust thinking about that.\n\n1436\n01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:07,230\nFinally, some last item category\n\n1437\n01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:10,020\nattacks we just wanna throw out\nas we look to wrap up here.\n\n1438\n01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:13,810\nNon-technical, things that are not,\nhey, gotta know math at that level, but\n\n1439\n01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:17,850\nrather just outside in the environment,\nin the wild what can be done.\n\n1440\n01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:21,300\nWe have purchase key, as a concept here,\nmeaning bribery in effect.\n\n1441\n01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,470\nWe can go out and\noffer somebody money just to get the keys.\n\n1442\n01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:25,780\nWhy go to all that trouble and\n\n1443\n01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:29,490\nlearn statistical analysis when I\ncould just buy the keys from you.\n\n1444\n01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:29,990\nMake a lot of sense.\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n1445\n01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:31,331\n>> So, you know, money does go a long way.\n\n1446\n01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:33,740\nSocial engineering, right?\n\n1447\n01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,490\nWe could perhaps trick people into giving\n\n1448\n01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:38,240\nus that information without them\nreally thinking about that.\n\n1449\n01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,110\nAnd what we call a rubber hose attack.\n\n1450\n01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:44,380\nA rubber hose attack is literally\nbeating the algorithm in the system up\n\n1451\n01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,730\nuntil we can make it do what we want.\n\n1452\n01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:49,250\nYou can almost think of that as a brute\nforce attack in many respects very\n\n1453\n01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,140\nsimilar.\n\n1454\n01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,330\nBut it is just going after that system\nwith everything we could possibly think of\n\n1455\n01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:56,550\nto beat it up and or beat up the person.\n\n1456\n01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:58,560\nRight?\nYou may have the information.\n\n1457\n01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,430\nCould be either way there right?\n\n1458\n01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:01,910\nBy the way do not try that at home.\n\n1459\n01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:04,640\nNot a recommended concept.\n\n1460\n01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,230\nNo human beings were hurt in the\nproduction of this particular TV episode\n\n1461\n01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:11,020\nwhen we talked about rubber hose attacks.\n\n1462\n01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,030\nSo make sure you understand that this\ncould be against human resources, right?\n\n1463\n01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:18,160\nPersonnel, as opposed to systems,\nbut it could be either one.\n\n1464\n01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,720\nWe talk about a brute force attack when we\ngo after passwords and just crank away,\n\n1465\n01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,400\nthis is broadening that concept out to\nsystems and potentially people, right?\n\n1466\n01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,210\nSo we see that in movies, you know?\n\n1467\n01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:29,790\nThey hook you up, they torture you,\nthey waterboard you,\n\n1468\n01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:31,480\nwhatever it is to get\nthe information out of you,\n\n1469\n01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,720\nthat theoretically would be\nconsidered a rubber hose attack.\n\n1470\n01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,080\nLots and lots of fun.\n\n1471\n01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,055\nGreat way to spend a Saturday afternoon\nif you've got nothing going on.\n\n1472\n01:08:37,055 --> 01:08:38,660\n>> [LAUGH] Jumper cables and\na bucket of water.\n\n1473\n01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,980\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1474\n01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:40,505\nRight.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1475\n01:08:40,505 --> 01:08:42,470\n>> Yeah, what was that, that was.\n\n1476\n01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:43,745\nNot Die Hard, the one with.\n\n1477\n01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:46,510\n>> He's been in a couple of-\n>> Oh my god.\n\n1478\n01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:49,550\n>> Didn't they do it in one of\nthe James Bond movies I think, and-\n\n1479\n01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:50,870\n>> Yeah, but that whole series,\n\n1480\n01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,650\noh god now we're gonna sound silly.\n\n1481\n01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:53,720\nWe can't figure it out.\n\n1482\n01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,680\nAll right so anyway!\n\n1483\n01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,740\nWe'll come back,\nwe'll figure that one out right?\n\n1484\n01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,460\nThat was the movie.\n\n1485\n01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,930\nI just can't think of the name, right now.\n\n1486\n01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:00,710\nAll right.\nAnyway.\n\n1487\n01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:04,340\nSo, the idea here is that we really\nwanted to wrap up an summarize for\n\n1488\n01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,660\nyou just all of those last\nminute elements, right.\n\n1489\n01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,040\nAll those things about the attack types.\n\n1490\n01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:12,470\nBut also, bring back that whole\nconversation and finish it up around PKI,\n\n1491\n01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:17,030\ndive through that detail for you, make\nsure you saw the concept of the digital\n\n1492\n01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:21,440\nsignatures and brought them home and\njust how all that comes to fruition.\n\n1493\n01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,030\nSo, with that, I think we've done\na really good job of laying out for\n\n1494\n01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:28,260\nyou the information in this area\nof the SSCP body of knowledge.\n\n1495\n01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:31,180\nWe've talked a lot about cryptography and\nall the supporting elements.\n\n1496\n01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,860\nReally hope you've gotten a lot\nof value out of our conversations\n\n1497\n01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:36,280\nover the sessions and\nthe episodes that we've done this for.\n\n1498\n01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,280\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou in future ones.\n\n1499\n01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,070\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1500\n01:09:39,070 -->

00:00:38,296\nI'm Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n4\n00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:39,191\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n5\n00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:40,150\n>> I'm great.\n\n6\n00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,450\nI'm just fabulous, how 'bout you?\n\n7\n00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,035\n>> I'm fantastic, and any day I'm sitting\nhere with you on the other side of\n\n8\n00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:48,750\nthe podium is a good day for me, so-\n>> You're gonna make me blush.\n\n9\n00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,080\n>> Well, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe're gonna get right back into some

communications.\n\n12\n00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,480\nAwesome.\n>> Yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,140\nGo over some different\n\n14\n00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,790\nprotocols.\n>> Very cool.\n\n15\n00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,720\n>> Some different components and\n\n16\n00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,800\nthings like that, so by the way, if you\ncan identify the ghost finger that every\n\n17\n00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,280\nso often moves into the frame when\nwe move the camera around, right?\n\n18\n00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,100\nYou'll probably see I did that for just a\nsecond before, so we'll try to watch that.\n\n19\n00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,910\n>> I'll get you back.\n>> Yeah, but\n\n20\n00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,182\nit's the third presenter that's up\nhere that you don't see very often.\n\n21\n00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:16,870\n>> Exactly.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,570\n>> And then it moves over.\n\n23\n00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,160\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about or\n\n24\n00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,830\ncontinue talking obviously\nabout SSP related content,\n\n25\n00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,500\nbut in this episode talk a little\nbit about networking, right?\n\n26\n00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,860\nAnd so, we spend a lot of time in our\nother conversations throughout the content\n\n27\n00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,540\nwe've been covering with you laying out\nall the various things that go out,\n\n28\n00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,460\ngo round, go under and\ngo on top of our network, right.\n\n29\n00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,730\nPolicies, procedures and standards,\n\n30\n00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,870\ninternet services, protocols,\nports, intrusion detection,\n\n31\n00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,240\nrisk, analysis of risk, all the various\nthings we've got to worry about.\n\n32\n00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,870\nCryptography, how we safeguard\ninformation, what we haven't really\n\n33\n00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,270\nspoken about directly, is the thing\nthat puts it all together, links it, and\n\n34\n00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,950\nmakes sure that information\nmoves from point A to point B.\n\n35\n00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,730\n>> That's an important of this.\n\n36\n00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,101\n>> Pretty important part, right?\n\n37\n00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,938\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We can do all that other stuff, right?\n\n38\n00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:09,485\nBut, if we're not careful\nto really focus on and\n\n39\n00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:12,420\nmake sure that we are structuring\nthe network, right?\n\n40\n00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,240\nThe underlying pipes, the architecture\nof all that, in such a way that we have\n\n41\n00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,640\nsecurity built in right from the ground\nup, or right from the bottom up,\n\n42\n00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,510\nthen we're good, right?\n\n43\n00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,375\n>> Yep\n>> Sorry.\n\n44\n00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just a quick technical adjustment here,\n\n45\n00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,490\nI apologise.\n\n46\n00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,440\nThis is live, remember.\n\n47\n00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,530\nJust be aware of that.\n\n48\n00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,140\nI stepped on my mic cord briefly so\n\n49\n00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,490\nI wanted to make sure I was still\nconnected and you're able to hear me.\n\n50\n00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,360\nOtherwise you would just get a lot of\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,750\n>> You wouldn't actually hear anything.\n\n52\n00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,720\n>> Still good stuff but\nnot quite as informative.\n\n53\n00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,920\n>> Wouldn't be quite as valuable to you,\nall right, so anyway, so\n\n54\n00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,780\nwhat I was saying was, just making sure\nwe're focusing on the networks, right?\n\n55\n00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,350\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n56\n00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,360\nwe want to start talking about\nthis idea of the network.\n\n57\n00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,960\nWant to make sure we understand that we're\ngonna help you develop the understanding\n\n58\n00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,150\nof what a network looks\nlike from the ground up.\n\n59\n00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,000\nWe're gonna talk about\nsomething very central and\n\n60\n00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,110\nvery important to it called the OSI model.\n\n61\n00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,140\nAlways a good place to start and we'll go\nthrough that and talk about what that is.\n\n62\n00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,530\nWe're also gonna break down the network,\nand\n\n63\n00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,690\nwe're gonna take a look at the cabling,\ncomponents that make up a network.\n\n64\n00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,990\nSo what kind of cables can we potentially\nlook forward to seeing out there?\n\n65\n00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,810\nA lot of you that are doing this\nare interested in watching this content\n\n66\n00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,570\nI'm sure.\n\n67\n00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,170\nIt's probably one of the areas that\nyou have a lot of background with,\n\n68\n00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,310\nand probably a lot of\nhands on experience with,\n\n69\n00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,690\neven if you're not doing this day in and\nday out professionally now,\n\n70\n00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,350\nas a security professional,\nyou have some background with IT, right?\n\n71\n00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,720\nBecause we all have at least one or two\ncomputers, we tend to play around with,\n\n72\n00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,730\nwhether it's at home or in the office,\nand whether it's wireless, wired, or\n\n73\n00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,000\nsome combination of that, we probably have\nsome exposure to a lot of the themes and\n\n74\n00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,170\na lot of the structure that\nwe're going to talk about.\n\n75\n00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,870\nBut there may be some areas you haven't\nspent as much time with, for instance,\n\n76\n00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,910\nso you may not work with fiber optic\ncable all that often, if at all.\n\n77\n00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,220\nYou may not have seen coax cable because\nalthough you may see it at home for\n\n78\n00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,650\nyour cable cable, you may not\nhave seen the networking variety.\n\n79\n00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,580\nIt's not real popular and\nreally not used anymore today.\n\n80\n00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,360\nAnd you may never have seen something\ncalled a repeater or a hub even though now\n\n81\n00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,950\nwe use kind of all that stuff in a bridge,\nall built in generically a switch, right?\n\n82\n00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,030\nSo we're gonna talk about some of those\nolder legacy things that are just\n\n83\n00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,320\nknowledge points.\n\n84\n00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,410\nSome of you have been doing this for\na while, will probably have\n\n85\n00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,050\nseen these devices, may have even used\nthem and configured them at some point.\n\n86\n00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,560\nWhen was the last time you saw\nToken Ring in production, for instance?\n\n87\n00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,220\n>> It's been a long time.\n\n88\n00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,150\n>> So you know MAWs and S-MAWs,\n\n89\n00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,580\nwhich are the effective switch and hub\nsolutions that were used in token rings.\n\n90\n00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,500\nYou may not have seen these things,\nbut we'll mention them.\n\n91\n00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,660\nWe'll talk about them so\nyou know what they are.\n\n92\n00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,480\nWe'll show some pictures along the way.\n\n93\n00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,500\nMike's going to whip out his old Polaroid\ninstamatic camera here with the browsing\n\n94\n00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,520\nfunction on Google.\n\n95\n00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,290\nAnd we'll take you through some pictures\nto make sure you get the chance to see\n\n96\n00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,620\nwhat's going on in there.\n\n97\n00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,800\nAnd we're also going to define a bunch\nof stuff that is really going on today.\n\n98\n00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,360\nWith network, so we'll talk about how\nto build the architecture of a network\n\n99\n00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,090\nwhether it is going to\nbe a meshed apology or\n\n100\n00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,330\na start apology, or a bus and\n\n101\n00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,680\nwhat those things are and how we use them\nto build the modern networks of today.\n\n102\n00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,420\nSo we'll take a look at all this stuff and\n\n103\n00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,900\njust make sure we see what it is and\nunderstand all those things.\n\n104\n00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,690\nAfter we get done talking\nabout some of that stuff.\n\n105\n00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,800\nWe'll obviously be able to then come\nback and layer in some richness on top.\n\n106\n00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,290\nWe'll put in protocols.\n\n107\n00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,370\nWe'll put in port numbers and\nall the ingredients that go in and\n\n108\n00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,350\nmake a complete network.\n\n109\n00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,440\nHopefully when we're done,\n\n110\n00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,310\nwe're going to have something that\nactually makes a lot of sense.\n\n111\n00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,600\nAnd will be able to be used to drive\nthat focus towards that knowledge and\n\n112\n00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,760\nthe questions you may need to answer\nalong the way, to get ready as an SSCP.\n\n113\n00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,160\nAs always, we always start talking about,\nwhen we talk about the SSCP content, and\n\n114\n00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,060\nby the way,\nwhen we talk about CISSP content as well,\n\n115\n00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,010\nthe broader the focus overall,\nmore managerial.\n\n116\n00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,470\nBut we're still talking about\nthe same three building blocks,\n\n117\n00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,550\nthe same three components we have\nspoken about in almost every one\n\n118\n00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,095\nof the areas that we've been discussing,\nwhich is confidentiality, right?\n\n119\n00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:52,615\nSo how do we safeguard information,\nmake sure that it is going to be\n\n120\n00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,545\nhidden from those that\nare not supposed to see it,\n\n121\n00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:56,545\nbut given to people that\nare supposed to see it, right?\n\n122\n00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:59,745\nSo that's gonna be important, so\nthings like access control come in here,\n\n123\n00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:03,260\nand you know making sure we understand\nhow to safeguard information\n\n124\n00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,700\nusing cryptography and using protocols\nthat could drive that encryption.\n\n125\n00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,930\nWe'll speak about some of those protocols\nin our discussions in this area.\n\n126\n00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,970\nThings like IPSEC for instance.\n\n127\n00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,710\nMaybe TLS, Transport Layer Security,\nVPNs for instance, a way of safeguarding\n\n128\n00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,050\ninformation when we access remotely and\ncome in to a network from from outside.\n\n129\n00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,850\nSo tunnelling as a methodology,\nthings of that nature.\n\n130\n00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,540\nWe talk about integrity.\n\n131\n00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,300\nOur internet integrity is gonna be not\nthis idea of safeguarding information,\n\n132\n00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,690\nkeeping it from prying eyes, but\nrather validating the origin,\n\n133\n00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,840\nthe proof of origin, and the fact that the\ninformation has not changed the substance,\n\n134\n00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,110\nthe form of that information is intact,\nso when we send a message and\n\n135\n00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,550\nwe receive a message, is the same\nmessage being received that was sent?\n\n136\n00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,035\nHas it been modified in any way?\n\n137\n00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:49,070\n[INAUDIBLE] That kinda stuff's integrity.\n\n138\n00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,840\nAnd so we had talked about things\nlike hashing, for instance,\n\n139\n00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,600\nand digital signatures\nhelping us to deal with that.\n\n140\n00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,210\nAnd when we talk about networks,\n\n141\n00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,452\nwe will talk about methodologies like\nthose things that are layered on top.\n\n142\n00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:03,960\nBut, [INAUDIBLE] monitor it, right, and\nkeeping an eye on information as it flows.\n\n143\n00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,550\nKnowing who's able to\nplug into our network and\n\n144\n00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,500\nmonitor information is part of what we\nthink about when we talk about integrity.\n\n145\n00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,860\nAnd we're talking about availability,\nright?\n\n146\n00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,890\nThe A and the AIC triad or\nthe A and the CIA taught process,\n\n147\n00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,690\nwhen we think about the triangle\nof information security.\n\n148\n00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,050\nWhen we talk about availability,\nthis is one of those areas, networking and\n\n149\n00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,220\ncommunications, where availability\nreally is one of those things we push to\n\n150\n00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,960\nthe forefront in our discussions, because\nalthough integrity is very important,\n\n151\n00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,170\nalthough confidentiality very important,\nand\n\n152\n00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,690\nwe build those things\non top of our network.\n\n153\n00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,520\nAvailability is really all about\nmaking sure the network is designed\n\n154\n00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,560\nto provide access to that information,\nin an ongoing fashion.\n\n155\n00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,589\nAn so, the proper architecture\n>> Right.\n\n156\n00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:48,901\n>> And proper design so\nweather we choose asynchronous or\n\n157\n00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:53,869\nsynchronous data access method, whether it\nis going to be an old school style like\n\n158\n00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,463\nISDN which we don't see too much anymore.\n\n159\n00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:57,171\n>> Right.\n\n160\n00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:58,901\n>> Or it's something a little bit newer,\nright?\n\n161\n00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:02,162\nSo some of these newer\ntechnologies that we may be using.\n\n162\n00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:07,860\nSo, whether we have a MPLS solution,\nhigh speed fiber of some kind.\n\n163\n00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,230\nWhatever it may be.\n\n164\n00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,570\nCable modems these days.\n\n165\n00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,650\nRight, business grade.\n\n166\n00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,210\nCable modems are being brought\ninto businesses and in homes.\n\n167\n00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,261\nYou probably get, what, 50, 100 megabytes\nof bandwidth coming in [CROSSTALK].\n\n168\n00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:20,331\nRight?\nYou just got to be able to stream all that\n\n169\n00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:22,881\nill-gotten content off the internet\nthat you want to borrow\n\n170\n00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:25,190\nbecause somebody else made\navailable to you, right?\n\n171\n00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,340\n>> Legally

act ethically, right?\n\n175\n00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,710\nSo you wanna make sure you don't do that.\n\n176\n00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,120\nNot supposed to do that, right?\n\n177\n00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,870\nThat's not legal.\n\n178\n00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,740\nBut should you know somebody who does,\n\n179\n00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,090\nthey're probably using a high\nspeed internet connection.\n\n180\n00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,060\nSo we'll go through and\ntalk about some of these things as well.\n\n181\n00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,421\nSo, you asked me things about\ninformation security and\n\n182\n00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:47,950\ninformation security activities, we\nreally gonna start thinking about policy.\n\n183\n00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,470\nWe've talked about policy in\nsome of our prior discussions.\n\n184\n00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,690\nWhat is gonna be the guideline,\nthe policy,\n\n185\n00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,720\nthe standard we look to,\nto start setting things up?\n\n186\n00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,140\nWhat's the architecture gonna look\nlike for our networks as we said?\n\n187\n00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,360\nAre we gonna have good network design?\n\n188\n00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,240\nAre we using the proper tools\nto document our network design?\n\n189\n00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,420\nMaybe Visio.\n\n190\n00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,020\nActually if it's not Visio, or\nwe just have a captured tool that will map\n\n191\n00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,430\nout our network for us, and\nthen give us some sort of representation.\n\n192\n00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,290\nYou know, tools like solar windsus\ntools that do this, what a golds,\n\n193\n00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,630\ngood tool that's been out there for\na long time.\n\n194\n00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,935\nNetwork monitor,\nnot the Microsoft Network Monitor.\n\n195\n00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:23,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But another product that you can use\n\n196\n00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,720\nthat maps out all your networks.\n\n197\n00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,480\nSee, there's a lot of different\nthings you can use out there.\n\n198\n00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,280\nYou could sit down and\njust do a sketch, obviously.\n\n199\n00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,740\nBut also you gotta formalize that, right?\n\n200\n00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,980\n>> Right.\n>> You gotta document it.\n\n201\n00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,460\nSo how do we get that\ndocumentation created?\n\n202\n00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,432\nHow do we know that we can then train and\n\n203\n00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:40,490\non board new team members\nwhen they come on and\n\n204\n00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,390\nstart being part of our administrative\nteam, that's gonna be important.\n\n205\n00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,970\nPass on that knowledge, right?\n\n206\n00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,880\nHow do we do the risk assessments that\nwe've talked about in prior episodes,\n\n207\n00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,660\nthe business impact analysis,\nthreat surveys, site surveys,\n\n208\n00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,040\nvulnerability assessments,\nthe list goes on and\n\n209\n00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,240\non in relation to what we\nwould have to consider.\n\n210\n00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,110\nWe want to make sure we have\na good understanding of change.\n\n211\n00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,850\n>> Yeah, change management.\n\n212\n00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,880\n>> And change configuration, management\nchange, and configuration management,\n\n213\n00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,550\nboth very important there.\n\n214\n00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,230\nAnd as well, aside from all that,\n\n215\n00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,120\nwe then wanna have security awareness and\ntraining.\n\n216\n00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,980\nWe've talked a lot about\nthe value of making\n\n217\n00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,660\neverybody in the network a stakeholder,\na shareholder in awareness.\n\n218\n00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,880\nAnd what we really think about when\nwe talk about this is this idea of\n\n219\n00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,080\nspreading the knowledge, right?\n\n220\n00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,070\nIt's much like spreading out\nanything we can think of.\n\n221\n00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,820\nYou pour some liquid into\na container of some kind and\n\n222\n00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,620\nas it moves all around it really\nspreads out to cover everything.\n\n223\n00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,380\nWe want to get that good coverage, right?\n\n224\n00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,280\nSo, much like if you're mulching or\n\n225\n00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,740\nif you're spreading fertilizer,\nwe want to have coverage everywhere.\n\n226\n00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That has a couple plants we\n\n227\n00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,860\ncould throw in there.\n\n228\n00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,870\n>> There are a few about\nspreading the knowledge and\n\n229\n00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,720\nspreading the good knowledge\naround the work, right?\n\n230\n00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,130\nSo some knowledge is more\nvaluable than others.\n\n231\n00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,880\nLet's put it that way\nto wrap that plant up.\n\n232\n00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,490\n>> User edge case scenario is paramount.\n\n233\n00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,550\nI mean it really does underline everything\nelse because no matter what you do to\n\n234\n00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,380\nsecure that network,\nit just takes that one user to\n\n235\n00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,280\nclick on that link in the email they\nweren't supposed to or prop that back door\n\n236\n00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,700\nopen with their briefcase and undermine\npretty much everything you've done.\n\n237\n00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,410\n>> Absolutely.\n\n238\n00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,120\nAnd then we go out, we hunt them down\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,050\n>> And we\n\n240\n00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,270\ndo terrible things to them cause we\ndon't like them very much, right?\n\n241\n00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,580\nRemember, always act ethically.\n\n242\n00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,850\nJust make sure nobody catches you.\n\n243\n00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,950\nThat's the only thing.\n\n244\n00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,860\nSo what is a security policy, right?\n\n245\n00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,050\nWe want to make sure we have\na good working definition of this.\n\n246\n00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,530\nWe've defined policy in some\nof our other episodes, but\n\n247\n00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,670\nI want to recap the definition here for\nyou quickly.\n\n248\n00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,000\nJust to make sure we're thinking about\nit as we go into network design.\n\n249\n00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,435\nSo, it's a formal statement, right?\n\n250\n00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:25,765\nOf all the rules that are gonna\ngovern our behavior or\n\n251\n00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:29,405\nactivities in a certain area, in this case\nwe're talking about a security policy,\n\n252\n00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:33,045\nvery broadly defined as security,\nwe're talking about the high level\n\n253\n00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:36,645\nrules of engagement that cover,\nand define, and govern for\n\n254\n00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:40,805\nus, what the expectations of behavior will\nbe inside the network around security,\n\n255\n00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:43,575\nand management of and\nimplementation of security.\n\n256\n00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:48,300\nSo whether it is a user bringing in their\nown device to try to see if they can\n\n257\n00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,460\nconnect and get corporate email, or\nit is the use of a business sponsored\n\n258\n00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,530\ndevice like a laptop or a desktop or\nwhatever it may be, all of those things\n\n259\n00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,860\nshould have policies that govern their\ninteraction with users and users'\n\n260\n00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,690\ninteraction with the devices, we split\npolicies up into different categories.\n\n261\n00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,220\nRemind you of the fact\nthat our prior episode,\n\n262\n00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,840\nthat we talked about this in depth.\n\n263\n00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,410\nWe spoke about this idea that you could\nfind these policy templates out there.\n\n264\n00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,530\nIf you're not familiar with them, I think\nwe referenced the Sansorg, Sans.org, or\n\n265\n00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,590\nthe reading room.\n\n266\n00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,980\nThat, SANS has there.\n\n267\n00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,510\nSo you know giving you know a little\nbit of knowledge out there and\n\n268\n00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,280\nputting it out there for\nyou guys to think about.\n\n269\n00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,250\nTaking and running with, it's important.\n\n270\n00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,180\nYou want to make sure you have a good\nunderstanding of what these policies may\n\n271\n00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,270\nlook like and\nhow to execute on them, right?\n\n272\n00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,980\nHow to create them.\n\n273\n00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,560\nIf you've never done one,\nmaybe you've never written a policy,\n\n274\n00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,770\nyou may not have an idea of\nwhat it should look like.\n\n275\n00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,420\nDon't be afraid to go out and\nfind something.\n\n276\n00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,120\nAsk, and I think I said this the last\ntime we talked about this as well,\n\n277\n00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,310\nask your peers and colleagues.\n\n278\n00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,030\nAsk your friends.\n\n279\n00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,310\nWhat are you doing?\n\n280\n00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,480\nHow are you doing this?\n\n281\n00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,760\nWould you mind if I took a look at yours?\n\n282\n00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,300\nUnderstand they may say,\nwell listen, it's got a lot of\n\n283\n00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,220\nsensitive stuff in the sense of\nhow we call out what we do inside,\n\n284\n00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,950\nand you'll say, listen no problem,\ncan you scrub it for me, you know,\n\n285\n00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,550\ngo through do a quick find and replace,\nremove all references to your company,\n\n286\n00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,040\ntake out IP ranges,\n>> Right.\n\n287\n00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,870\n>> Stuff that might be internal that,\nobviously, you don't want exposed.\n\n288\n00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,950\nI just want the template.\n\n289\n00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,040\nI want to see what it looks like.\n\n290\n00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,070\nI want to get a sense of what you're\ndoing, I don't want to take it and\n\n291\n00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,740\nrun away with it.\n\n292\n00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,970\nI just want to see a finished one,\nI just want to know.\n\n293\n00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,600\nBecause a lot of times, you get handed\nthis job where somebody says to you we\n\n294\n00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,570\nneed a policy for that and\nyou may never written one before.\n\n295\n00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,300\nSo, no, we don't teach you how\nto do this stuff unfortunately,\n\n296\n00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,930\na lot of the times we just kind of hand\nit to you and soon you'll figure it out.\n\n297\n00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,500\nAnd the nice thing about\ngoing to school today.\n\n298\n00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500\nUnlike for instance,\nwhen I went to school.\n\n299\n00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,370\nAnd Mike,\nyou might have had the same experience.\n\n300\n00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:33,990\nI don't know.\n\n301\n00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,160\nWhen I went to school, when I went,\nespecially when I was in college, and\n\n302\n00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,140\nstudying for what I wanted to become,\nI didn't study computers.\n\n303\n00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,670\nThere really was no such thing\nother than being an engineer, and\n\n304\n00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,260\nit wasn't a computer engineer.\n\n305\n00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,600\nIt was just being an engineer\nback then when I went to college.\n\n306\n00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,670\nComputer science wasn't really around\nin the current form it is today.\n\n307\n00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,010\nInformation security management\nwasn't around as a discipline.\n\n308\n00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,220\nYou couldn't go an learn how to be an I.T.\nprofessional by going to a college.\n\n309\n00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,830\nA normal four-year, or two-year and\nthen four-year education.\n\n310\n00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,560\nOut of the traditional education\nsystem with community and\n\n311\n00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,280\nthen ultimately a normal\nfour-year university or college.\n\n312\n00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:16,400\nIt just didn't exist, you were self taught\nand or you figured it out or you didn't.\n\n313\n00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,310\nMuch later on,\ngoing into maybe the last ten years or\n\n314\n00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,450\nso these programs have really\nstarted to become popular.\n\n315\n00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,120\nYou can now go to a full\nfour year university,\n\n316\n00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,320\nin some cases community colleges can\nalso offer this kind of training.\n\n317\n00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,220\nAnd whether it's vocational\nspecifically by design or\n\n318\n00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,100\nyou're going to a school that\njust does that kind of training.\n\n319\n00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,160\nOr you're going to a broader,\nfull college level experience university.\n\n320\n00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,930\nYou're able to study these\ndisciplines today, and\n\n321\n00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,120\ntoday we do show you\nhow to write policies.\n\n322\n00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,880\nWe teach you and educate you what\nthese different things are and\n\n323\n00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,445\nhow to engage in them prior to you.\n\n324\n00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:52,145\nYou coming out, but for a lot of people\nthat came out many, many years back and\n\n325\n00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:53,983\nhad to learn the hard way by doing this.\n\n326\n00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:57,425\nIt's self taught knowledge, right, and\nwe may or may not be taught the right way.\n\n327\n00:14:57,425 --> 00:15:02,552\nWe may or may not know the right things,\nand I always am reminded about the fact\n\n328\n00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:06,932\nthat just because I have done things\na certain way for many, many years that I\n\n329\n00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:10,702\nmay have been doing this, that doesn't\nmean necessarily that it's the right way.\n\n330\n00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,890\nAnd I'm always learning from\ncustomers from my students.\n\n331\n00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,850\nAbout practices and things that\nthey're engaged and they're doing.\n\n332\n00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,920\nThings that they may find\nvaluable in their networks today\n\n333\n00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,730\nthat are different perhaps in the approach\nI would take, and I'm always interested,\n\n334\n00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,150\nalways open to the idea of hearing\nwhy we're doing things a certain way.\n\n335\n00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,840\nAnd if there's a legitimating reason\nthat you can share with me that says,\n\n336\n00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,060\noh by the way,\nwe're doing it this way and here's why.\n\n337\n00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,210\nHey, let's have at it.\n\n338\n00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,120\nLay it out on the table.\n\n339\n00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,850\nLet's talk about it.\n\n340\n00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,500\nYou may have discovered a much better\nway to do something, and sharing that\n\n341\n00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,610\nknowledge is what we're talking about when\nwe talk about security awareness training.\n\n342\n00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,109\nIt's all about those kinds of activities\nthat really help us, individually and\n\n343\n00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:50,528\ncollectively, to be better\nmembers of our community,\n\n344\n00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:53,678\nthe information security community,\nbut also to be better at our jobs.\n\n345\n00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:56,639\nI take the approach that I'm only\nas good as what I did recently.\n\n346\n00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,915\nAnd the success or failure that I've\ncreated for my customers And for\n\n347\n00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,909\nmy students, and by extension\ntheir customers over time and,\n\n348\n00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:06,185\nyou know if I can't validate that\nbecause I haven't done good work,\n\n349\n00:16:06,185 --> 00:16:08,180\nthen I gotta go back and do something new.\n\n350\n00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,840\nI gotta change something, I gotta\nfigure out how to do something else,\n\n351\n00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,290\nso why we create policy is all about\nmaking sure we standardize our management\n\n352\n00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,390\nthought process around how we do things.\n\n353\n00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,490\nMaking sure we're focused in\non hitting the right notes and\n\n354\n00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,400\nsetting the right tone for our users.\n\n355\n00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,600\nWe define the assets that will be used.\n\n356\n00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600\nWe define the approach to the assets.\n\n357\n00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,770\nWe define the methodology and\nthe mechanisms around the security.\n\n358\n00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,500\nAnd we lay out a strategic\nas well as tactical vision\n\n359\n00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,170\nof what security means in this area for\neverybody.\n\n360\n00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,620\nNot just for management.\n\n361\n00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,110\nNot just for end users, but\nfor everybody holistically.\n\n362\n00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,575\nThat approach is using this system.\n\n363\n00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:45,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This is what a policy represents to us,\n\n364\n00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,110\nand it's a good knowledge point for you\nas you look to prepare for the SSCP exam.\n\n365\n00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,170\nAnswer questions, have to go through\nthat process to validate your knowledge.\n\n366\n00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,750\nThese are the kinds of things you're\ngonna wanna make sure you're comfortable\n\n367\n00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,520\ndiscussing, right?\n\n368\n00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,060\n>> Right.\n\n369\n00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,080\nSo, what does the policy\ncontain ultimately?\n\n370\n00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,250\nStatement of authority and scope,\nas we talked about this idea of\n\n371\n00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,280\nwhat's the purpose here,\nwhat are we doing, what does it focus on?\n\n372\n00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,640\nAcceptable usage,\nwhat is acceptable usage,\n\n373\n00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,370\nsome of the tactical\ndetails I just mentioned.\n\n374\n00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,220\nWho's gonna be identified as the audience?\n\n375\n00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,250\nThe policy is typically the scope.\n\n376\n00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,500\nWhat is the focus?\n\n377\n00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,740\nIs it internet policies?\n\n378\n00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,540\nIs it mobile device policies?\n\n379\n00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,820\nIs it desktop, what is gonna be in there?\n\n380\n00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,880\nWhat are we gonna be looking at?\n\n381\n00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,250\nThose are the kind of things we want to be\nthinking about as we define our policies.\n\n382\n00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,430\nAnd remember, network security over all\nright, driven by these components we've\n\n383\n00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,260\nbeen talking about, and we'll continue to\ntalk about here, is a continuous process.\n\n384\n00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,210\nIt's a life cycle.\n\n385\n00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,770\nAnd like anything else,\nit has a well defined beginning,\n\n386\n00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,800\na well defined middle and\na well defined end, the trick is we\n\n387\n00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,040\nunderstand that we have to link through\nall of those and then cycle back.\n\n388\n00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,110\nRIght?\nAnd so, when we figure out something and\n\n389\n00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,860\nwe're monitoring it.\n\n390\n00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,370\nIt's live.\n\n391\n00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,280\nWe're operating it.\n\n392\n00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,330\nWe're looking to continuously monitor and\nimprove it.\n\n393\n00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,460\nAnd this is the life\ncycle that we talk about.\n\n394\n00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,810\nIt's a continuous process because\nyou're new solutions are being\n\n395\n00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,840\nthought of and implemented.\n\n396\n00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,510\nNew technologies are coming\nout all the time.\n\n397\n00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,180\nSome old technologies may be retired.\n\n398\n00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,890\nAs we said, we don't see much coax.\n\n399\n00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,250\nWe don't see much in the way\nof RAIN topology, anymore.\n\n400\n00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,188\nThere may still be some out there in\nlegacy systems that haven't been retired,\n\n401\n00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:17,423\nbut certainly there's no on implementing\nRAIN topologies, the traditional ring,\n\n402\n00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:21,418\nnot fiber rings, not FTDI rings, but for\ninside a LAN, traditional copper wire\n\n403\n00:18:21,418 --> 00:18:24,810\nbased fiber rings, nobody's\nbuilding them new any more, right?\n\n404\n00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,281\nWe're not deploying hubs anymore new.\n\n405\n00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:27,781\nAt least\n>> Probably not.\n\n406\n00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:29,282\n[LAUGH] >> Hopefully not, right?\nSo,\n\n407\n00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:31,840\nas a result of this, right,\ntechnology comes and goes.\n\n408\n00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,800\nThat doesn't mean that a usage policy is\nnot gonna still be pertinent if it talked\n\n409\n00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,700\nabout hubs at one point, and bridges that\nnow can be changed with just a few minutes\n\n410\n00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,390\nof thought and focus to edit it, to not\ntalk about switches and routers, right?\n\n411\n00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,920\nAnd so you want to think about\nupdating that process and\n\n412\n00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,890\nmaking sure things are gonna be,\nas much as possible right,\n\n413\n00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,030\nkept up to date if we can\nreally focus on that.\n\n414\n00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,720\nHaving said that, I know we have\na nice list of things that we want to\n\n415\n00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,970\nstart talking about and we've spent some\ntime putting together for everybody.\n\n416\n00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,680\nSo we go this nice list of network\ncomponents that we wanna throw together\n\n417\n00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,150\nand talk through a little bit with you,\nright?\n\n418\n00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,700\nAnd we're gonna start by just\ntalking about some of the basics,\n\n419\n00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,150\nthe cabling for instance.\n\n420\n00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,760\nAnd some of the architecture elements\nlike patches and hubs that we deal with.\n\n421\n00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,270\nAnd will get a little bit more\ncomplicated as we go down the list here.\n\n422\n00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,440\nAnd we'll throw some\npictures up along the way.\n\n423\n00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,520\nAnd try to give you a visual\non some of this stuff.\n\n424\n00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,810\nSo we start thinking about networks,\nwe think about cabling first and foremost.\n\n425\n00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,670\nBecause we have to\nconnect things together.\n\n426\n00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,300\nAnd so we have three kinds of cable.\n\n427\n00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,290\nYou can see up at the top\nof our list there.\n\n428\n00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,620\nWe have twisted pair cable.\n\n429\n00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,900\nThis would be traditional copper wire.\n\n430\n00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,900\nEthernet base cable whether it's a Cat 3,\nCat 5, Cat 6 or Cat 7, whatever it may be.\n\n431\n00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,930\n>> Yes.\n>> We'll talk about what those categories\n\n432\n00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,310\nare a bit later.\n\n433\n00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,610\nBy the way, if you're not familiar\nwith the term CAT generically,\n\n434\n00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,800\nthis shortened abbreviation for\ncategory of cabling, CAT is just a short\n\n435\n00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,910\nversion of category and when we say a Cat\n5 cable, we're talking about a twisted\n\n436\n00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,840\npair of Ethernet copper wire cable,\nmuch like speaker wire you have at home.\n\n437\n00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,140\nWe do still wire up speakers.\n\n438\n00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,770\nSome of us do anyway right?\n\n439\n00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,810\nEverything is wireless today, but you know\nif you do have either copper wire for\n\n440\n00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,940\nspeakers or you have some network\ncable laying around, right?\n\n441\n00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,540\nYou may be listening to this and,\nyou may be able to look down and\n\n442\n00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,900\nsee a network cable.\n\n443\n00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,393\nWe're talking about that copper wire\ncable, and the category rating,\n\n444\n00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:24,120\nCat 5 versus Cat 5e versus Cat\n6 is a rating of speed, and\n\n445\n00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,432\nso we'll talk more about that and\nwhat that is a little later.\n\n446\n00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:31,892\nCat 5 represents 100 megabits, for\ninstance, Cat 5e, up to about 350 megs and\n\n447\n00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:36,290\nCat 6 up to potentially a gigabit of speed\ndepending on what we're talking about,\n\n448\n00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,640\nmaybe even a little more down the road.\n\n449\n00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,170\nAnd so that's what we're talking\nabout when we're talking about a Cat,\n\n450\n00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,610\nit's just simply a rating.\n\n451\n00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,600\nSo twisted pair cable is traditional\ncopper wire Ethernet-based cabling,\n\n452\n00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,360\ncoax would be copper wire cable as well,\nfor Ethernet networks but\n\n453\n00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,360\nmuch older cable, it would be thicker by\ncomparison to the twisted pair copper wire\n\n454\n00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,080\ncabling that we are thinking about for\nEthernet networks in use today.\n\n455\n00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,920\nYou don't see coax cable being used much\nanymore, the coax cable would be like\n\n456\n00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,370\nthe cable you have at home for your\ncable system if you have actually still\n\n457\n00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,870\na wired cable solution coming out of your\ncable box or VCR or whatever it may be.\n\n458\n00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,430\nIf you're not using like a Blu-ray DVD\nwith HDMI or something, right?\n\n459\n00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,440\n>> Right.\nIt's an old school cable wire cabling, but\n\n460\n00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,220\nthat's what we think of.\n\n461\n00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,020\nIt's a different grade of copper wire\ncable than what you use at home.\n\n462\n00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,980\n>> Right.\n>> It looks almost identical to\n\n463\n00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,250\nthe untrained professional.\n\n464\n00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,550\nYou might just look at it and\ngo, well, it looks the same.\n\n465\n00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,730\nAnd indeed it almost is,\n\n466\n00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,760\nbut the copper wire core is\ngonna be a little bit different.\n\n467\n00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,980\nIt's got a little bit of\na different thickness to it.\n\n468\n00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,350\nAnd the makeup of that\ncable has extra shielding,\n\n469\n00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,730\nwhen we talk about network cable versus\nthe cable you might use at home.\n\n470\n00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,410\nBut we still have that copper core in\nthe middle that is kind of long and\n\n471\n00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,310\nthin and is ultimately gonna connect\ninto the back of the network card.\n\n472\n00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,010\nAnd then we have some plastic shielding\nin various layers that wrap around it.\n\n473\n00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:54,780\nWith fiber, we're talking about cable that\nhas a glass core, inside the middle of it.\n\n474\n00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,120\nWhere the network cable would be\ntraditionally a copper wire cable,\n\n475\n00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,290\nwe have a glass core instead\nof a copper wire core,\n\n476\n00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,945\nsurrounded again by some sort\nof heavy duty plastic or\n\n477\n00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:10,275\npolyvinyl kind of external cladding of\nsome kind to protect it, fiber optic\n\n478\n00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:15,145\ncable is going to allow us to transmit\nlight pulses instead of electrical pulses,\n\n479\n00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:18,680\nwhich is what traditional network,\ncopper wire based cable works with.\n\n480\n00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,230\nNot enough to hurt you, certainly.\n\n481\n00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,140\nYou could touch a copper wire cable\nbare handed while standing in\n\n482\n00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,010\na puddle of water.\n\n483\n00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,310\n>> Right.\n>> Not gonna feel anything.\n\n484\n00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,280\nIt's very, very minimal.\n\n485\n00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,380\nSay that now and all of a sudden,\n\n486\n00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,980\nthe lights start dimming as people\nare doing an experiment, right?\n\n487\n00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,970\nSo you'll get a worse shock if\nyou take a nine volt battery and\n\n488\n00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,410\ntouch it to your tongue, right?\n\n489\n00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,300\nIf you've never done that,\nboy let me tell you.\n\n490\n00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,250\nThat's a fun party game, right.\n\n491\n00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,090\nHave a couple of drinks.\n\n492\n00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,800\nAnd start doing that and\npass the battery around.\n\n493\n00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,630\nSo don't do that by the way, right?\n\n494\n00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,600\nYou will actually get shocked with\na nine volt battery if you do that.\n\n495\n00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,840\nBut with a copper wire cable, no.\n\n496\n00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,030\nYou're not gonna get any electrical pulse\noff that that you can detect, right?\n\n497\n00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,180\n>> Right.\n>> It's very, very minimal.\n\n498\n00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,930\n>> Yeah.\n>> But the point is,\n\n499\n00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,660\nwe can certainly hook\nit up to a volt meter.\n\n500\n00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,470\nWe can detect what's going on there.\n\n501\n00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,060\n>> Yes.\n>> It's just not enough to hurt you\n\n502\n00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,490\nin any way, shape, or form.\n\n503\n00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,660\nSo, we have those kinds of cables, and\n\n504\n00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,310\nwe're going to probably just quickly\ntake a look at some pictures if we can.\n\n505\n00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,990\nJust to make sure you guys have a sense\nof what these cables look like.\n\n506\n00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,080\nI think we already have the,\nthat's actually fiber up there,\n\n507\n00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,950\nso let's start with that.\n\n508\n00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,540\nThat way we don't have to worry\nabout going back and finding it.\n\n509\n00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,440\nWe could see some fiber\noptic cable choices.\n\n510\n00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,220\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhich one we're looking at.\n\n511\n00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,930\nThey're all pretty much,\nexcept for that one.\n\n512\n00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,370\n>> Except for that one.\n\n513\n00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,780\n>> Many of those,\nthey're all pretty much the same.\n\n514\n00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,800\nAnd the idea here, you'll notice\nis that the copper wire cable,\n\n515\n00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,230\nand specifically the connector,\nthe external part of the cable\n\n516\n00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,830\nis going to be a square as opposed\nto traditional ethernet-based cables\n\n517\n00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,390\nthat will either have a RJ45 head on them\nwhich will be almost like a rectangle.\n\n518\n00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,900\nWith eight wires laid out inside\nwith the proper contact points.\n\n519\n00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,760\nAnd or a BNC connector for\nour coaxial cable, which will be a circle.\n\n520\n00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,680\nSomething like what you're\nshowing right now, but\n\n521\n00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,828\nit will have a single copper\nwire coming through the core.\n\n522\n00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:56,844\nSo that's what a fiber optic\ncable is gonna look like.\n\n523\n00:23:56,844 --> 00:24:00,385\nAnd inside there is a glass core that\nbasically is transiting light pulses.\n\n524\n00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:02,581\nWhy don't we take a look\nat coax real quick.\n\n525\n00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:03,184\n>> All right.\n>> And\n\n526\n00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:08,377\nfind maybe a BNC connector with a coax\ncable or something like that, right.\n\n527\n00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:12,340\nAnd so we can see we've got some\nBNC connectors up on the screen.\n\n528\n00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,060\nThe coax cable would plug into the back.\n\n529\n00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,940\nBack end of this thing, and\nthen in the front as you can see,\n\n530\n00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,180\nwe have the BNC plug, maybe that one\nright there, or any of the ones.\n\n531\n00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,900\nYeah, either one of those,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n532\n00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,490\nWe could see there that the wire's kind of\nsnaking out the back, and what we can see\n\n533\n00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,690\nis that we have the copper, little tube,\nkind of poking its head out there, and\n\n534\n00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,150\nwe can see that we would basically\ntake this metal jacket, right, and\n\n535\n00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,250\nwe can see the notches on either\nside at like, almost 9 o'clock and\n\n536\n00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,200\nthree o'clock we're thinking\nabout it's more like.\n\n537\n00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,200\n>> 12 and six [LAUGH]\n>> I'm thinking this way\n\n538\n00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,040\nfrom about two and\nabout 8:30 it's a little off center.\n\n539\n00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> But, what we're thinking about is.\n\n540\n00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,220\n>> Those two little notches.\n\n541\n00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,580\n>> Right those two little notches\nthere the back of the network card for\n\n542\n00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,220\na BNC connector, would have a tube\nthat almost maybe about so big.\n\n543\n00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,780\n>> Let's see if I can\nfind you one of those.\n\n544\n00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,220\n>> Sticking out the back of it, and\nhave little poster notches on it.\n\n545\n00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,020\nAnd so what you would do is,\nyou would screw that thing in there, and\n\n546\n00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,280\nattach it down.\n\n547\n00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,470\nAnd so, as a result of that you\nbasically would lock it in place,\n\n548\n00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,940\nyou would turn it and lock it.\n\n549\n00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,080\nAnd we don't really have to bring one up,\n\n550\n00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,880\nthey can get a general idea\nof what it looks like, so.\n\n551\n00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,870\n>> I always tell people, cuz a lot of,\nwell again dating myself.\n\n552\n00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,580\nBut I always think about\nthe old light bulbs in the car,\n\n553\n00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,590\nyour tail lights and stuff.\n\n554\n00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,370\n>> Oh sure, you have to lock them.\n\n555\n00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,630\n>> Have the two little nubs that came out,\nand that's basically what you're doing,\n\n556\n00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,780\nyou're slide\n>> Slide them in that groove,\n\n557\n00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,210\nand you push and turn and\nit locks it in place.\n\n558\n00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,840\nAnd it's just the way to keep\nthat cable secure on the back of\n\n559\n00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840\nthat network interface.\n\n560\n00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,660\n>> Absolutely correct.\n\n561\n00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,160\n>> Make sure one can't pull out real easy.\n\n562\n00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,070\n>> So we've probably all\nhad that RJ-45 connector,\n\n563\n00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,390\nwhich we'll talk about here\nnext if you want to pull it up.\n\n564\n00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,480\nIf the little tab pops off\nthat thing- oh it's in there!\n\n565\n00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,110\nNo it's not, right?\n\n566\n00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,970\nIt keeps falling out the back and\nthat's why you keep losing your signal.\n\n567\n00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:49,210\nSo, the RJ45 for traditional copper wire.\n\n568\n00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,470\nEthernet based cable, right?\n\n569\n00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,320\nYou can see some of the connectors there\nis gonna have that, as you can see,\n\n570\n00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,950\neight slots, each one is\na little copper connector there\n\n571\n00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,890\nwires go in there in a predetermined\norder depending on what you're doing.\n\n572\n00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,720\nAnd as a result, if we lose that little\nconnection nub or I don't know what\n\n573\n00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,690\nthe proper technical name is for that\nlittle piece that sticks out the back.\n\n574\n00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,530\n>> The annoying tab.\n\n575\n00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,140\n>> The little clicky thing.\n\n576\n00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,310\nSo if the little clicky thing\ngoes away and breaks, and\n\n577\n00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,760\nwe're always too lazy to go ahead and just\nre-cut the cable, you know re-crimp it.\n\n578\n00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,320\nAs a result, if that thing breaks,\n\n579\n00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,130\nthen obviously it may slide out\nthe back of the network card.\n\n580\n00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,470\nTo Mike's point, it's not locked in there.\n\n581\n00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,670\nThat's where you get out the old\nduct tape and you start, right?\n\n582\n00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,600\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n583\n00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,890\nAnd then they made these, right?\n\n584\n00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,830\nYou worked with these, I'm sure.\n\n585\n00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,980\nThey had the little protector over them.\n\n586\n00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,550\n>> Which are just the most\nannoying things in the world.\n\n587\n00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,080\n>> They are the worst.\n\n588\n00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,070\nBecause sure it keeps you from breaking\nthe tab cuz you can't get to the tab to\n\n589\n00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,510\nget it out of the back of the card.\n\n590\n00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,950\n>> Exactly, so once you put it in there,\nit's basically there for life.\n\n591\n00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,902\n>> Yeah.\n>> You just can't get it out,\n\n592\n00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:39,922\nwhat you do is you wind up ripping\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n593\n00:26:39,922 --> 00:26:41,886\n>> The entire thing apart to be able to\n\n594\n00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:46,270\nget the little thing out and\nin the process you ruin the cable anyway.\n\n595\n00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,050\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n596\n00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,170\nDefinitely not a good day.\n\n597\n00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,240\n>> There's a good shot of that tab.\n\n598\n00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,540\n>> Yeah, there's a good shot of\nthe tab right there, exactly.\n\n599\n00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,820\nAnd so this is an RJ45 connector, and,\nalthough we're not gonna bother to put one\n\n600\n00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,250\nup, for those of you who are old enough to\nremember, phones that were actually analog\n\n601\n00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,290\nphones that were cabled up as opposed\nto maybe wireless phones we use today.\n\n602\n00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,660\nWe had an RJ-11 connector,\nwhich was a 4-pin connector,\n\n603\n00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,500\nthat would look just like this but\nwould have half the pins obviously and\n\n604\n00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,960\nthat is what we would use for\nthe phone cable.\n\n605\n00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,490\nThat’s what we would see for cat1 cable\nwhich was traditionally phone cable\n\n606\n00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,900\nyou would actually have an rj11 connector.\n\n607\n00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,939\n>> Not as wide but\nit still will fit into that RJ45 jack.\n\n608\n00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:26,332\nHow many people have you seen with a phone\ncable plugged into the back of their\n\n609\n00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:26,885\ncomputer.\n\n610\n00:27:26,885 --> 00:27:29,730\n>> Absolutely the head\nalthough it's not as wide.\n\n611\n00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,030\nThe configuration will still plug in,\n\n612\n00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,290\nyou just won't get anywhere because it\nwon't be able to accept data, right?\n\n613\n00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,060\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n614\n00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,130\nThose are those cable types we at least\nare talking about, and I think we also\n\n615\n00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,640\non our list had the next item down\nwe want to cover was a patch panel.\n\n616\n00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,250\nLet's take a look at\na picture of that real quick.\n\n617\n00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,260\nJust throw that up.\n\n618\n00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,770\nMost people have probably seen one,\nalthough they may not really think about\n\n619\n00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,496\none very often, but a network patch panel\nis gonna be the place where you're gonna\n\n620\n00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,829\nbe able to, that worked,\neven though [CROSSTALK].\n\n621\n00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:58,270\n>> Google's so [CROSSTALK], aren't they?\n\n622\n00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,338\n>> Yeah, they are.\n\n623\n00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:02,034\nA patch panel is gonna be the one,\nor the item there,\n\n624\n00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:06,100\nmaybe going down to that multicolored\nrainbow one, down, over one, right.\n\n625\n00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,130\nNo, down, down, down.\n\n626\n00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,710\nDown, down.\n\n627\n00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,350\nOne more, there we go, yeah.\n\n628\n00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,000\n>> There it is.\nJust so\n\n629\n00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,350\nthey could see what it looks like,\nso something like that, right?\n\n630\n00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,210\nYou're gonna see them up on a,\nmaybe on a wall in a room, you may see\n\n631\n00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,090\nthis certainly in a data center in\na rack you're gonna see these patches.\n\n632\n00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,710\nAnd whether they're color-coded or\nnot, not really important, but\n\n633\n00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,360\nthis is where we're gonna\nplug our cables into,\n\n634\n00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,010\nthey're gonna be labelled,\nthat's what those colored bars are for.\n\n635\n00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,960\nYou could see all the wiring in some\nof the other ones that are there,\n\n636\n00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,870\nthe idea is we're gonna lay out\nthat wiring and somehow label it so\n\n637\n00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,520\nwe know what it connects to, but we're\nbasically just creating a junction point.\n\n638\n00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,675\nWe're connecting cabling in, and\nthe other end of that cable is\n\n639\n00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:42,460\ngonna connect somewhere,\neither to a switch or to a router or\n\n640\n00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,410\nto a wall plate and ultimately, that\nis gonna allow for connectivity, right?\n\n641\n00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,540\n>> Right.\n\n642\n00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,730\n>> Okay, so\nthat's what a patch panel looks like and\n\n643\n00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,600\nit's just really a junction box for\nconnectivity for\n\n644\n00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,010\nour world in addition to that,\nwe had a hub and a bridge.\n\n645\n00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,170\nLet's take a look at hubs and\nbridges real quickly.\n\n646\n00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,380\nYou don't tend to see hubs in\nproduction networks anymore.\n\n647\n00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,540\nYou're not really made anymore perse...\n\n648\n00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,780\nYou can probably still find them\nif you really wanted to, but\n\n649\n00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,270\nwe're not talking about an item\nthat's very popular today,\n\n650\n00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:19,480\na hub is basically a dumb connection box,\nand while it may look like a switch,\n\n651\n00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,520\na small 4-port or 8-port hub and\na small 4-port or 8-port switch will\n\n652\n00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,320\npretty much look identical, in the sense\nthat you can see you connect into them.\n\n653\n00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,260\nThe front end, the business end of it,\nhas the plugins for the various cables,\n\n654\n00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,610\nhas the lights to show connectivity\nas you can see on the screen there.\n\n655\n00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,590\nShows power, shows collision,\nas you can see yellow in this case,\n\n656\n00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,900\nprobably a red of something\nwould've been collision on this.\n\n657\n00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,670\nThis may very well be to\nthe untrained eye, if you didn't read\n\n658\n00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,310\nthe top where it says ethernet hub-\n>> Yes.\n\n659\n00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,740\n>> Or whatever it says there,\nyou may quickly look at it and go oh,\n\n660\n00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,470\nthat's a switch.\n\n661\n00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,670\n>> Yes.\n>> But the main difference is, that a hub\n\n662\n00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,050\nhas no intelligence whatsoever, right,\n>> Right.\n\n663\n00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,630\n>> It's really nothing more\nthan a glorified power strip,\n\n664\n00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,590\nright, where you would just plug things\nin and effectively give connectivity.\n\n665\n00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,436\nWhereas a switch, layer two, layer three,\neven smarter switches going up the stack\n\n666\n00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:11,078\nwill be able to be manage, will provide\nadditional capabilities, and obviously\n\n667\n00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:15,475\nare gonna look different at the high\nend when we talk about 24 and 48 port.\n\n668\n00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:18,478\nWe get into big things obviously but\nmaybe that's a good one,\n\n669\n00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:20,910\na little small one,\na four or an eight port.\n\n670\n00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,720\nYou may look at it quickly and may not\nnotice a lot of differences, right.\n\n671\n00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,700\nAnd so we wanna make sure we understand\nthat these days the hub capability\n\n672\n00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,390\nis really just built right into\nthe switch, this place to plug in and\n\n673\n00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,550\nconnect because when we use hubs,\nwe had to use repeaters separately.\n\n674\n00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:40,250\nAnd a repeater would've been this device\nthat would boost signal strength back up,\n\n675\n00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,670\nbecause the hub did not provide\nany of that capability,\n\n676\n00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,550\nit just provided a plug in point.\n\n677\n00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,230\nNow a hub and a repeater are both built\ninto the switch as a functional element,\n\n678\n00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,580\nand so when you plug into a switch we\ngive you the capability to plug in and\n\n679\n00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,570\nsee traffic and move through the other\ntraffic nodes inside the switch and\n\n680\n00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,230\naround it, but we also boost signal\nstrength by plugging in that cable and\n\n681\n00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,450\nrecycling the signal up to full\nstrength and to pass this through.\n\n682\n00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,550\nIt sounds like an amplifier,\n\n683\n00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:08,650\nwhich was what a repeater was along\nwith a hub rolled into one, right?\n\n684\n00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,270\nAnd we have bridging functionality, a\npotentially in some switches and a bridge,\n\n685\n00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,940\nmaybe a separate layer to device,\ndepending on what we're talking about.\n\n686\n00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,270\nMaybe we can throw a picture up\nof the bridge real quick as well.\n\n687\n00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,310\nSince we went ahead and put a switch\nup there we can do a bridge, and\n\n688\n00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,330\nmaybe take a look at that.\n\n689\n00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,990\nAnd so I think there was\na bridge up there on the upper.\n\n690\n00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,130\nYea maybe that one you\nhad right down there.\n\n691\n00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:28,900\nYea either one.\n\n692\n00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,510\nYea that's probably just a good one.\n\n693\n00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,070\nWe have a bridge there.\n\n694\n00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,240\nWe can zoom in just a little bit.\n\n695\n00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,960\nWe can see again,\ngiving some free plugs to Netgear.\n\n696\n00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,556\n>> I know!\nEvidently.\n\n697\n00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:41,410\n[LAUGH]\n>> Getting every sponsor.\n\n698\n00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,900\nEverybody's getting their gear on here.\n\n699\n00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,180\nIt's all the Netgear stuff.\n\n700\n00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,210\nThat's just the picture\nyou happen to find, right?\n\n701\n00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,000\n>> Right right.\n\n702\n00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,150\nNo Netgear stickers on my jumpsuit.\n\n703\n00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,480\n>> Sell the advertising\nlogo space right here.\n\n704\n00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n705\n00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,375\nPowered by Mountain Dew!\n\n706\n00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or something like that.\n\n707\n00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,307\nWhat we see here, we've got a bridge.\n\n708\n00:31:57,307 --> 00:32:00,141\nAnd what we're basically seeing with\na bridge is the ability to be able to link\n\n709\n00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:01,592\nmultiple network segments together.\n\n710\n00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:04,758\nWe could take, maybe,\na network over in the corner over there,\n\n711\n00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:08,396\nThe network in the corner over here\nbridged them in the middle literally by\n\n712\n00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:10,070\nconnecting them together.\n\n713\n00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,950\nThis would've been done early\non in older network topologies\n\n714\n00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,690\nwhen we didn't wanna use a router because\nrouters were much more expensive,\n\n715\n00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,000\nlittle bit more complicated to configure.\n\n716\n00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,330\nYou needed more horsepower if you wanted\nto use a router cuz you had to program it.\n\n717\n00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,270\nYou had access control lists and\nthings going on in a router.\n\n718\n00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,930\nAnd this was just a physical hardware\ndevice that allowed us to create that\n\n719\n00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,280\nconnection between segments without\nthe overhead of the router,\n\n720\n00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,350\nwithout moving up\nthe topology in the model.\n\n721\n00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,670\nNot real popular anymore.\n\n722\n00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,130\nWe still see them on occasion.\n\n723\n00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,130\nI still see them in the field every so\noften, depending on what I'm doing.\n\n724\n00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,820\nWe see them in wireless\nnetworks sometimes,\n\n725\n00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,030\nwhere we're bridging wireless\nnetworks between buildings.\n\n726\n00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,660\nWe will see wireless bridges.\n\n727\n00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,000\nBut you know, hard wired like this,\nprobably the dinosaur that's slowly but\n\n728\n00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,930\nsurely, making its way out of the network.\n\n729\n00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,520\nRIght?\nWe don't tend to see them very often.\n\n730\n00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,590\nBut you do have bridges there, and\n\n731\n00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,630\nobviously just important to\nbe aware of what they are.\n\n732\n00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,460\nSo we do have switches,\nwe have routers, we do have bridges, or\n\n733\n00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,290\nrather we've done the hub,\nthe bridge, the switch.\n\n734\n00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,790\nWe haven't done the router, probably good\njust to throw a router up real quick.\n\n735\n00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,970\n>> Let's do a router.\n\n736\n00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:13,070\n>> And that'll probably be our last item\nwe want to talk about in this particular\n\n737\n00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,110\nconversation before we take a break.\n\n738\n00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,680\nBut with a router, and let's see,\n\n739\n00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,620\nwe've got all sorts of them, we can use\nthe generic Visio or Cisco diagram router,\n\n740\n00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,523\nwhich is the, no,\njust the cylinder with the four.\n\n741\n00:33:24,523 --> 00:33:25,575\nLook, that's a router.\n\n742\n00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:26,627\n>> That's a router, yeah.\n\n743\n00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:28,730\n>> Like you really know that's a router,\nright.\n\n744\n00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,600\nShows you so much about the functionality.\n\n745\n00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,840\nI want to be in that meeting where\nthey decided that was the router\n\n746\n00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,410\nthat was going to be the diagram and\nthe vision for the router.\n\n747\n00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,130\n>> That is it.\n\n748\n00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,500\n>> That's a wireless one.\n\n749\n00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,430\n>> Yeah, let's see if we can find-\n>> Let's go with that one, whichever one,\n\n750\n00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,090\njust a hardwire one.\n\n751\n00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,590\nOne of the ones just right there.\n\n752\n00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,360\nYeah, something like that.\n\n753\n00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,670\nLet's just show what\na physical one looks like.\n\n754\n00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,910\nSurprise surprise.\n\n755\n00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,660\nI was going to say, it's a Netgear one.\n\n756\n00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,800\n>> Was it Netgear?\n\n757\n00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,910\nEh, let's stick with Netgear.\n\n758\n00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:52,420\nWhat the heck.\n\n759\n00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,860\n>> Alright.\nIt doesn't really matter what we do.\n\n760\n00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,520\nWe had a Cisco one there as well.\n\n761\n00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> But the idea is that with a router,\n\n762\n00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,500\nwhat we're doing is,\n\n763\n00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,310\nwe're creating layer three,\nOSI model layer three base connectivity.\n\n764\n00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,220\nAnd so what we're doing is maybe take\nthat one, or maybe take one of the, yeah,\n\n765\n00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,720\nmaybe the Cisco one, that could be good.\n\n766\n00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,820\nYeah, that's good.\n\n767\n00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,500\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n768\n00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,390\nAnd so what we're doing is, we're able\nto plug in, this is actually good so\n\n769\n00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,880\nwe can zoom in on the LAN and\nthe LAN ports, right?\n\n770\n00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,970\nSo we can actually see\nthat right there and so\n\n771\n00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:21,780\nwhat we see is, we see that we have\nmultiple connection points, we've\n\n772\n00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,730\ngot some ethernet it looks like hundred\nmeg ethernet ports there on the left.\n\n773\n00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,270\n>> Mmhm.\nAnd\n\n774\n00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,780\nit looks like we have a LAN\nport in blue typically, so\n\n775\n00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,940\nthat port right there that we're hovering\nover right now is probably our LAN port,\n\n776\n00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,770\nor maybe our console port actually.\n\n777\n00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,110\nThat's probably console, right?\n\n778\n00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,380\nAnd then we've got a LAN and\na WAN port sitting over there.\n\n779\n00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:41,310\nAnd so the idea is that we're able to plug\nin again using RJ45 connectors, right?\n\n780\n00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,010\nSo we're taking a look at just standard\nnetwork wired topology here, and\n\n781\n00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:49,670\nthe router takes us up to level in the OSI\nmodel where the hub was at layer one,\n\n782\n00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,630\nphysical device [INAUDIBLE] no\nconnectivity management whatsoever.\n\n783\n00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,140\nBridges and switches found at layer two,\n\n784\n00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,780\nalthough switches can operate at\nlayer three and even higher, right?\n\n785\n00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,160\nWe add a zero on for functionality at\nevery level we go up the switch stack.\n\n786\n00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,440\nSo you get up to layer five and six\nswitches, we've got about in some cases\n\n787\n00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,290\nmillion dollar plus core routing and\nswitching gear of the internet, right?\n\n788\n00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,350\nSo you want to get your hands on some\nof that stuff and play with that right.\n\n789\n00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:16,410\nSo we have layer three devices which\nare routers traditionally, and layer three\n\n790\n00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:21,000\nis going to deal with our, beginning\nto understand our network connectivity.\n\n791\n00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,510\nSo we're gonna be able to\ndeal with our routing.\n\n792\n00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,120\nIt's gonna deal with our routing tables,\n\n793\n00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,530\nwe're gonna be looking at IP\naddresses in our routing tables.\n\n794\n00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,910\nWhereas a bridge's routing table,\n\n795\n00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,500\nbecause it does maintain one,\nis gonna be layered two solutions.\n\n796\n00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,960\nIt's gonna be maintaining MAC addresses.\n\n797\n00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,070\n>> And all that.\n>> And so, we'll come back and\n\n798\n00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,070\ntalk about all this\nstuff in the OSI model.\n\n799\n00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,340\nDo a thorough review and\n\n800\n00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,510\nput all of this into context in\none of our upcoming conversations,\n\n801\n00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,120\nbut just laying it out right now for\nyou, this is what a router looks like.\n\n802\n00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,550\nThis is the kind of connectivity at layer\nthree that we're gonna talk about here.\n\n803\n00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,040\nRouters have to be managed, right?\n\n804\n00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,770\n>> Yes.\n>> So these are smart devices.\n\n805\n00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,990\nYou console into them and\nset them up to program them.\n\n806\n00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,800\nThey have their own operating systems.\n\n807\n00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,630\nCISCO has their iOS.\n\n808\n00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,870\nOther vendors have their\nown operating systems.\n\n809\n00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,860\nAnd you load that operating system and\nthen you will go into configure, and\n\n810\n00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:08,680\nrouters can have access controllers\nassociated with them for security that can\n\n811\n00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,410\nrun certain services and publish certain\nservices, how to make them available.\n\n812\n00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,400\nThere may be a web interface on newer\nrouters today where you actually can\n\n813\n00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,270\nmanage through the web and\n\n814\n00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,250\nmight not have to-\n>> Console in.\n\n815\n00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,105\n>> Connect directly and console in,\nexcuse me, absolutely correct.\n\n816\n00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:24,115\nAnd so we're looking at different\nkinds of functionality.\n\n817\n00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,265\nBut that's just icing on the cake.\n\n818\n00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:28,105\nAt the end of the day it's still a router,\nstill works at layer three,\n\n819\n00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,005\ndoesn't really change.\n\n820\n00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:32,015\nSo, we want to just make sure we're\ncomfortable with this idea and understand\n\n821\n00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:36,475\nwhat a router provides, which is layer\nthree management of IP addressing and\n\n822\n00:36:36,475 --> 00:36:40,845\nnetwork capabilities versus a bridge and\na switch traditionally found at layer two,\n\n823\n00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:43,275\nwhich is gonna deal with\nMAC address management and\n\n824\n00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:45,320\nnetworking capabilities at layer two.\n\n825\n00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,790\nAnd a hub, and even though we\ndon't use it anymore per se,\n\n826\n00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,390\nbuilt into the switch, ultimately provided\njust physical connectivity at layer one.\n\n827\n00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,670\nReally no smartness at all, and\nreally just raw connectivity.\n\n828\n00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,530\nJust raw connection points.\n\n829\n00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,210\nAll right, very good.\n\n830\n00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,730\nSo I think that's probably a good\nplace for us to take a break for\n\n831\n00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,310\na couple of minutes.\n\n832\n00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,210\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n833\n00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,279\n>> We'll be back with you shortly.\n\n834\n00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:13,899\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n835\n00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,280\n>> All right.\n\n836\n00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,200\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n837\n00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,950\nWe left off talking about our\nnetworking and communications.\n\n838\n00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,450\nAnd we're going over some different types.\n\n839\n00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,580\nWe went over some cabling types.\n\n840\n00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,994\nCable types, looked at some, started\nto get into some connectivity devices.\n\n841\n00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,609\n>> Connectivity devices.\n\n842\n00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:29,035\n>> Yeah.\n\n843\n00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:29,945\n[CROSSTALK] Jump back in?\n\n844\n00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:31,370\n>> Yeah, absolutely let's do that.\n\n845\n00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:35,030\nSo, let's talk a little bit more\nabout cabling, want to circle back,\n\n846\n00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:38,110\njust talk about some of the things we were\ntalking about in the prior discussion,\n\n847\n00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,640\njust to refresh our memory and\nget us thinking again.\n\n848\n00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,030\nAnd then we'll move back through\nour list and continue on.\n\n849\n00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,850\nSo we had started,\n\n850\n00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,530\nmaybe we can throw the list up real quick\njust while we're talking about stuff.\n\n851\n00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,090\nSo we had talked about\ndifferent kinds of cabling,\n\n852\n00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,240\nwe showed you some\npictures on twisted pair.\n\n853\n00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,550\nCoax fiber, and I started mentioning\nthe idea of categories of cable.\n\n854\n00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,270\nWe were talking about Cat 5,\nfor instance, things like that.\n\n855\n00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,570\nSo when we're thinking about cabling,\nwe wanna think about,\n\n856\n00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,960\nespecially on the copper wire side, we\nwanna think about things like throughput.\n\n857\n00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,300\nSo, obviously bandwidth\nbecomes really critical.\n\n858\n00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,860\nHow much bandwidth with this cable\nprovide based on the rating,\n\n859\n00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,490\nthe category and the cable?\n\n860\n00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,980\nWhat kind of distance are we talking about\nthis cable having to traverse between\n\n861\n00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,180\nconnection points cause we run\ninto a situation were we have\n\n862\n00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,710\nwhats called the attenuation rating\non a cable where at some point?\n\n863\n00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,560\nAgain, it's an average, a best guess.\n\n864\n00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,520\nIt's not gonna be a guarantee every time,\nbut Cat 5 cable attenuates at\n\n865\n00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,270\napproximately 100 meters, which means\ndepending on the quality of the copper\n\n866\n00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,540\nwire, because that's really what\nthe attenuation is based on.\n\n867\n00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,630\nIf you get really good clean copper it's\ngonna be at the high end of that scale.\n\n868\n00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,210\nIf the coppers a little bit dirty,\nand maybe it's not high quality,\n\n869\n00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,410\nit's gonna be at the lower end of that\nscale because there's impurities in it and\n\n870\n00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:50,180\nit has more friction in a fantasy,\nelectricity is moving through it.\n\n871\n00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,900\nThe formal term, Dr.\nScience over here, my partner, right?\n\n872\n00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,820\nThe resistance, right?\n\n873\n00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,472\nAs supposed to the uncorrect,\n\n874\n00:38:57,472 --> 00:39:00,000\nnon technical term called\nfriction that I used.\n\n875\n00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,890\nBut, you're absolutely right.\n\n876\n00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,830\nThe resistance.\n\n877\n00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,340\nIs what we're talking about there\nbecause attenuation rating is basically\n\n878\n00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,610\na resistance rating on the cable for\ndistance.\n\n879\n00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,280\nSo we think about the fact that they\ndon't average about a hundred meters.\n\n880\n00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,861\n>> And [CROSSTALK] we don't\nstop at a hundred meters.\n\n881\n00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:15,256\nIt just means that the cable's not\ngoing to be able to give you a rated\n\n882\n00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:16,780\nspecification.\n\n883\n00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,780\n>> Right.\nAnd a certain point past that distance.\n\n884\n00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,066\nIt may be 120.\n\n885\n00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,027\nIf it's on the low end,\n\n886\n00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:24,348\nmaybe it starts Extenuating at 80 and by\nthe time you get to 100 it drops off but\n\n887\n00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:27,260\nat some point you going to basically\nlose continuity on the cable.\n\n888\n00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,010\nYou are going to lose data integrity.\n\n889\n00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,380\nSome point basically that signal dies\nout just because there's no more forward\n\n890\n00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,360\nmotion left in the electrical impulse,\nthe data packet, if you will,\n\n891\n00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,020\nthat moves down the wire,\nunless we boost it, right?\n\n892\n00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,640\nWe basically rate it\nback up to full speed or\n\n893\n00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,910\neffectively push it back with this idea\nof either the repeating function, or\n\n894\n00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,120\nnow what we talk about in the switch\ncuz the switch does that.\n\n895\n00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,890\nSo we talk about these things and\nthese are important things to consider.\n\n896\n00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,609\nSo distance between\ndevice is very important.\n\n897\n00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:54,906\nYour data sensitivity,\n\n898\n00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:59,115\nare we talking about just normal data that\ncan be seen on the wire with no trouble?\n\n899\n00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:01,136\nIn which case, maybe copper wires okay.\n\n900\n00:40:01,136 --> 00:40:03,365\n>> Typically relatively secure.\n\n901\n00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:06,985\nHard to get signals off it,\nyou gotta tap into it in some way.\n\n902\n00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:08,200\nFibre may be more secure\n>> Right.\n\n903\n00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,370\n>> Because there's no emanation,\nno electrical or\n\n904\n00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,290\nmagnetic radiation or emittance.\n\n905\n00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,455\n>> Right.\n>> That comes off of that.\n\n906\n00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,495\nModality, right,\nthat transmission modality.\n\n907\n00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:18,535\nAnd as a result,\n\n908\n00:40:18,535 --> 00:40:22,495\nwe may put more secure data on fibre\nbecause it's gonna be a lot harder to tap.\n\n909\n00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:23,955\nBecause if we tap the line,\n\n910\n00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:28,945\nwe break the continuity of the light pulse\ndown the glass shield of the glass core.\n\n911\n00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:31,015\nWe know immediately that\nthe signal has been tampered\n\n912\n00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:32,495\nwith because it effectively got.\n\n913\n00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:34,145\nSo we have to think about\nall these things and\n\n914\n00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:35,945\nsort of think about how\nto set up our networks.\n\n915\n00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:37,535\nAnd environment as well.\n\n916\n00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:43,170\nDo we have complicated conduit\nsolutions in our buildings where wiring\n\n917\n00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:47,374\nis going to prove to be like setting\nup an interstate freeway interchange.\n\n918\n00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:48,420\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Figure eights things like that.\n\n919\n00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,000\nWe got to do a clover leaf\nto get something watered.\n\n920\n00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,958\nWe may not be able to able to use fibre\nbecause fibre wont be able to make\n\n921\n00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:55,575\nthose turns.\n\n922\n00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:56,775\n>> Those tight radiuses, yeah.\n\n923\n00:40:56,775 --> 00:40:59,525\n>> Not gonna work because it's basically\nbreak the glass that's inside the cord and\n\n924\n00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,495\nas a result, you're not gonna\nbe able to transmit anything.\n\n925\n00:41:01,495 --> 00:41:04,615\nSo we really gotta think about all these\nthings when we think about cabling.\n\n926\n00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:07,005\nWe're gonna take all\nthis stuff into account.\n\n927\n00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:09,865\nVery important to consider as we said,\nyou have through put, so\n\n928\n00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:11,475\nwhat's the category rating.\n\n929\n00:41:11,475 --> 00:41:14,175\nWe traditionally saw cabling\nbeing rated at CAT one,\n\n930\n00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:17,360\nwhich we were talking a little\nbit about during our break.\n\n931\n00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,700\nMost traditionally is gonna be phone,\nright.\n\n932\n00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,640\nNon-data, but like phone and voice, right.\n\n933\n00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,350\nAnd old phone.\n\n934\n00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:26,270\nSo, CAT three was really where we saw\nthe data beginning to hit the wire,\n\n935\n00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,490\nno pun intended, right?\n\n936\n00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,750\nAnd that was, 10 megabit cable,\n\n937\n00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,010\nthe old fashioned,\nblazingly slow speed of 10 megabits.\n\n938\n00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,730\nBut, if you think about what it was\nback in the day where you had modems.\n\n939\n00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,160\n>> With 56 kilobits if you were lucky.\n\n940\n00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,580\n>> Maybe, or 2600.\n\n941\n00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,820\n600 and\nall of a sudden you jump to a 10 meg wire.\n\n942\n00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,780\nIt literally was like buying a Ferrari.\n\n943\n00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,380\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n>> And\n\n944\n00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,480\ngoing out on a test track,\ncompared to what you had, right.\n\n945\n00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,220\n>> Absolutely.\n\n946\n00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,220\n>> I remember doing work on my\ngraduate thesis when I was in school,\n\n947\n00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,924\nwhen I was in college.\n\n948\n00:41:55,924 --> 00:42:00,440\n[LAUGH] I remember working on having\nto download a bunch of documents\n\n949\n00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,350\nfrom the United Nations, some of\nthe places I was doing research at.\n\n950\n00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:10,000\nI did some of that stuff over modems,\ntalk about great\n\n951\n00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,085\nway to blow four or five days of your life\nyou're never gonna get downloading data.\n\n952\n00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:15,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'd start that thing off and\n\n953\n00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,400\nyou'd have to go actually\n>> Go build something\n\n954\n00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:18,990\n>> Yeah, you planned your\n\n955\n00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,605\nday around it, right.\n\n956\n00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:20,190\n>> Right.\nExactly.\n\n957\n00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,539\nYou didn't go have a cup of coffee, you\nwent and actually grew coffee beans and\n\n958\n00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:25,532\nprocessed them before\nyou got your data back.\n\n959\n00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:28,570\n[LAUGH] It was a much different\nworld back then than it is today.\n\n960\n00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:31,450\nNow you'd set off the download,\nand by the time you walk away and\n\n961\n00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,760\ncome back, maybe you've already got your\ndocuments, depending on what it is, right.\n\n962\n00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,580\nSo it's a lot different today.\n\n963\n00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,640\nSo this idea of category three cable,\ncat three being 10 megs,\n\n964\n00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,365\nat the time pretty revolutionary and\npretty fast.\n\n965\n00:42:43,365 --> 00:42:44,050\n>> Absolutely.\n>> And\n\n966\n00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,740\nwe had cat four which\nwas gonna be 16 megs.\n\n967\n00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,600\nWe didn't really use cat four at all.\n\n968\n00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,710\nWe kind of skipped over it.\n\n969\n00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,890\nIt was more of a token ring thing\nwhere we had cat four for token ring.\n\n970\n00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:56,490\nWe went from slow token\nring to fast token ring.\n\n971\n00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,760\nIt was all the rage at the time.\n\n972\n00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,460\nAnd then all of the sudden we jumped\nto cat five which was 100 megabit.\n\n973\n00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,980\nAnd so cat five is really where\nwe've been parked for many years.\n\n974\n00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,930\nFairly recently.\n\n975\n00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:09,809\nWe saw cat five e start coming out,\n350 megs that we would see with cat five e\n\n976\n00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:12,640\nrecently in the last two or\nthree years probably.\n\n977\n00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,940\nSome of the other ratings we go on with\ncat six, obviously we go up to gigabit and\n\n978\n00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,880\neven beyond now 10 gig.\n\n979\n00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,530\nWiring and\n\n980\n00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:24,110\nout beyond that, on the virtualization\nside we're supporting 40 gig fibre now.\n\n981\n00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,640\nAnd so, fibre fabric,\nright, so fibre channel.\n\n982\n00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,220\nBut we're supporting 40 gig throughput\n\n983\n00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:34,440\non fiber channel fabric now with just some\nof the latest virtualization technology.\n\n984\n00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,470\n100 megabit, or excuse me, 100 gigabit\nis just over the horizon so to speak.\n\n985\n00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,310\nIt's coming fairly quickly in the next\nprobably year or two at the most.\n\n986\n00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,450\nWe'll see 100 plus gigabyte speed\nsupport on those backplanes.\n\n987\n00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,148\nSo it's pretty interesting stuff, right.\n\n988\n00:43:48,148 --> 00:43:51,510\nSo you wanna make sure you're familiar\nwith just that general thought process.\n\n989\n00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,680\nWe have coax and we talk about coax\nhaving been a 10 maegbyt solution.\n\n990\n00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,400\nIt was basically a Cap three solution.\n\n991\n00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,970\nWe talked about in a couple\nof different ways.\n\n992\n00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:06,520\nWe used to talk about either thin net and\nfit net but really old school discussion.\n\n993\n00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,440\n>> Behind the desk and vampire taping-\n>> Exactly is we see vampire\n\n994\n00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,730\ntaps to do that.\n\n995\n00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,870\nAnd we had, and\nthe reason we called them vampire taps.\n\n996\n00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:16,050\nIf you ever had the pleasure of\ndoing this, you may remember this.\n\n997\n00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,560\nWas that very large spiky needle like.\n\n998\n00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,330\n>> Yes, that one little [INAUDIBLE].\n\n999\n00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,060\n>> Protrusion that would\ncome out of the back.\n\n1000\n00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,720\nAnd if you were not careful when\nyou went to tap it down [LAUGH] and\n\n1001\n00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,180\nyou had your hand in the wrong place,\nyou would take a blood sample.\n\n1002\n00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,440\n>> Yeah, yes, yep.\n>> As well as tapping your cables.\n\n1003\n00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,370\nSo.\n>> Been there, done that.\n\n1004\n00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,420\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n1005\n00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,752\n[LAUGH] So you wanna,\nyou only do that once.\n\n1006\n00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,158\n>> That's right.\n>> Before you realize the hard way.\n\n1007\n00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:35,156\nDon't screw it down until you make\nsure the finger's not the way.\n\n1008\n00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:38,010\n>> Yes.\nSo we did have 10 megabit on the copper,\n\n1009\n00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,550\nexcuse me, on the coax cable there.\n\n1010\n00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,810\nAnd we do need to call it thinnet or\nthicknet, it's also referred to as\n\n1011\n00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,610\n10BASE2 or 10BASE5-\n>> Five, yep.\n\n1012\n00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,850\n>> Because it was basically, same concept.\n\n1013\n00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,610\nIt was also half inch or quarter inch,\n\n1014\n00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,480\nbecause of the diameter\ncircumference of the cable.\n\n1015\n00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:58,850\nAnd so we actually would talk about 10\nbase two, on being the quarter inch and\n\n1016\n00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:02,680\nalso being the thin net, this was\nall kind of the same classification.\n\n1017\n00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,670\nAnd then 10 base five,\nbeing the half inch, or the thick net.\n\n1018\n00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,730\nThis was the same we refer to it.\n\n1019\n00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,590\nAnd the attenuation rating on\nthose cables was for 10 base two,\n\n1020\n00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,340\nfor thinnet,\nit was approximately 185 meters.\n\n1021\n00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,090\nSo give or take, and it's funny,\ncuz we talk about this stuff in meters.\n\n1022\n00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,635\nWe're one of the only countries in the\nworld that doesn't do the metric system.\n\n1023\n00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1024\n00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,050\nwe've got this stuff in meters,\neverything else is not in meters.\n\n1025\n00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,590\n>> It's in feet, yeah.\n>> They've got a bunch of people walking\n\n1026\n00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,120\naround IT going,\nwhat's the hell's a meter?\n\n1027\n00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,050\nI gotta do the conversion [LAUGH] three\nfeet to the meter, and I don't know.\n\n1028\n00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:36,540\nOh my god, now I've got a subnet,\nand you saw people's heads explode.\n\n1029\n00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,370\nThe good news is you don't\nhave to do the conversion.\n\n1030\n00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,240\nYou just have to know it was 185 meters.\n\n1031\n00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,170\nIt was approximately 600 feet give or\ntake.\n\n1032\n00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,850\nThat's what it was on thin net.\n\n1033\n00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,420\nOn thick net,\nit was 500 meters approximately.\n\n1034\n00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,630\nAgain, rough average, little bit less,\n\n1035\n00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:56,398\nlittle bit more but\naround 1500 feet give or take, right.\n\n1036\n00:45:56,398 --> 00:45:58,740\nThen for fibre, we had attenuation rating,\n\n1037\n00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,150\nattenuation distances of 2000\nmeters to two kilometers.\n\n1038\n00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,760\nNow we're talking about close to a mile,\nor\n\n1039\n00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,170\njust over a mile because the reality\nis that we are talking about a very\n\n1040\n00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,080\nlong distance because we\neliminate the electrical impulse.\n\n1041\n00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,720\nSo we are eliminating that\nresistance at one level, but\n\n1042\n00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,080\nthere is still gonna be\nthis issue of the signal.\n\n1043\n00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,430\nThe light pulse dying out after\na certain amount of time.\n\n1044\n00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,580\nIf it's not gonna be repeated and\nbasically.\n\n1045\n00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,390\nRegenerate it.\n\n1046\n00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,810\nSo, we do have to be\naware of that as well.\n\n1047\n00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,130\nSo these are some of the issues we\njust wanted to circle back to and\n\n1048\n00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,140\nreally think about when\nwe talk about cabling.\n\n1049\n00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,740\nMaking sure we understand that.\n\n1050\n00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,850\nIt used to be you had to\nbe certified to do fibre.\n\n1051\n00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,450\nIt was pretty expensive, the gear.\n\n1052\n00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,730\nWill cost 20, 30, 40 grand in\norder to spice and put fibre in.\n\n1053\n00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,080\n>> You could make good money going\nout there and laying fibre down.\n\n1054\n00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,860\n>> You could and, I'm not saying\nyou could just do it at home.\n\n1055\n00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,690\n>> Right.\n>> There is still a little bit of expense\n\n1056\n00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,550\nand you need to understand what you're\ndoing, but it's a lot cheaper today.\n\n1057\n00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,620\n>> Yeah\n>> To do fiber than it was back in the day\n\n1058\n00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,200\nwhen it was dollars per yard,\nnow it's not that way at all.\n\n1059\n00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,210\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1060\n00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,700\nWe've talked about the cat five, talked\nabout our different connectivity issues\n\n1061\n00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,235\nthere, and just in general making\nsure you understand all that.\n\n1062\n00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:08,070\nFibre optics, as we talked about as well,\nall that's really important.\n\n1063\n00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:12,400\nWe did talk about patch panels, we spoke\nabout hubs, we talked about a hub being\n\n1064\n00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,250\na layer 1 device in the OSI model\nphysically layer in the OSI model.\n\n1065\n00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,560\nWe talked about a bridge\nbeing a layer two device,\n\n1066\n00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,040\nwhich would be the data link\nlayer of the OSI model.\n\n1067\n00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,359\n[COUGH] We'll get into the OSI model and\nwe'll talk about what it is and\n\n1068\n00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,218\ndocument it all out for you and\nshow you what it looks like.\n\n1069\n00:47:30,218 --> 00:47:32,450\nWe're not gonna do that right now but\nwe will come to that.\n\n1070\n00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,880\nA switch we said is typically thought\nof initially as a layer two device but\n\n1071\n00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,440\nit could be layer three, we certainly\nsee switches at both layer two and\n\n1072\n00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,230\nlayer three.\n\n1073\n00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,890\nWe even see them higher than that\nin the core switching that goes on\n\n1074\n00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:43,950\nfor the Internet.\n\n1075\n00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:49,745\nBut traditionally we often peg a switch at\na layer two, when the OSI is starting out.\n\n1076\n00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:54,036\nWe also think and talk about routers\nas being layer three of the OSI model,\n\n1077\n00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:56,405\nwhich would be [COUGH] the network layer.\n\n1078\n00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:58,575\nWe talked about that\na little bit the last time,\n\n1079\n00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:00,702\nas we were beginning to\ngo through some stuff.\n\n1080\n00:48:00,702 --> 00:48:03,267\nAnd we talked about\nwireless access points.\n\n1081\n00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:06,721\n>> Wireless access points are gonna allow\nus to basically do the same thing a wired\n\n1082\n00:48:06,721 --> 00:48:08,815\nconnectivity point does,\nbut obviously, and\n\n1083\n00:48:08,815 --> 00:48:12,164\nthere's a little bit of a misnomer\nthere and a misleading naming solution,\n\n1084\n00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:16,010\nat least I always thought of it that way,\nbecause it's not truly wireless, right?\n\n1085\n00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,460\nI mean, the front end of it is, right?\n\n1086\n00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,640\nBut at the end of the day we've\nstill got to cable up somewhere and\n\n1087\n00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,700\nconnect back into the core.\n\n1088\n00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,383\n>> Otherwise there's not much\npoint in connecting to it.\n\n1089\n00:48:22,383 --> 00:48:24,100\n[LAUGH]\n>> Not gonna get too far, that's for\n\n1090\n00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,730\nsure, right.\n\n1091\n00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:29,050\nSo it is a wireless/wired access point,\nbut\n\n1092\n00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:34,040\nwe do plug in some sort of cable on\nthe back whether it's through an RJ-45 or\n\n1093\n00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,510\nsome other connection\npoint however we do it.\n\n1094\n00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,800\nBut they allow us to bridge the wireless\nnetwork in to the wired stack.\n\n1095\n00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,180\n>> Gives the wireless clients\naccess to our wired resources.\n\n1096\n00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,400\n>> Absolutely,\nas long as they don't piss us off.\n\n1097\n00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400\nOtherwise we may go and\npull the plug on them.\n\n1098\n00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,180\nIn that case they no longer have access.\n\n1099\n00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:48,720\nThat's right.\n\n1100\n00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,610\n>> Your mac is on the list.\n\n1101\n00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,160\n>> Exactly.\n\n1102\n00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,070\n>> So we have that.\n\n1103\n00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,560\nWe talked about repeaters.\n\n1104\n00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,080\nRepeaters, we said,\n\n1105\n00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,820\nare basically going to be these devices\nthat really no longer exist on their own.\n\n1106\n00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,970\nSame as line conditioners.\n\n1107\n00:48:58,970 --> 00:48:59,890\nWe didn't put those in there.\n\n1108\n00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,480\n>> That's right.\n>> Used to have line conditioners\n\n1109\n00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,360\nyears ago.\n\n1110\n00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,950\nI had little separate metal boxes\nunder my desk for all these things,\n\n1111\n00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:09,690\nwe have the line conditioner where you\nplug the power commonem align condition,\n\n1112\n00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,390\nwe're actually cleaning the power up,\n\n1113\n00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:14,382\nthen you have the repeater that\nwould basically amplify the signal.\n\n1114\n00:49:14,382 --> 00:49:16,810\n>> All right.\nThen you had all the other stuff, but\n\n1115\n00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:17,995\nthose were the good old days.\n\n1116\n00:49:17,995 --> 00:49:20,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Two million pounds of highly\n\n1117\n00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,665\nradioactive electrical\ngear sitting on your desk.\n\n1118\n00:49:22,665 --> 00:49:24,420\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's a wonder anybody could reproduce.\n\n1119\n00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,455\nThey lived through the 80s.\n\n1120\n00:49:25,455 --> 00:49:26,160\n>> [LAUGH] all right.\n\n1121\n00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,590\n>> So, we have line conditioners,\nwe have repeaters.\n\n1122\n00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,710\nYou don't see those anymore.\n\n1123\n00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,650\nAgain, all this functionality is build\nright into the high-end gear today on\n\n1124\n00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,870\nthe layer two and layer three switches.\n\n1125\n00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:35,990\nWe have concentrators.\n\n1126\n00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,600\nYou still see concentrators,\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n1127\n00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,840\nA concentrator may be a VPN concentrator,\nfor instance.\n\n1128\n00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,750\nThere are other kinds,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n1129\n00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,150\nBut these are typically hardware\ndevices that you find in network cores.\n\n1130\n00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:52,650\nSo inside wiring centers or wiring rooms\ninside data centers that are used to bring\n\n1131\n00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:56,200\nin external connectivity in\nthe case of a VPN concentrator.\n\n1132\n00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,920\nTo be able to aggregate connections,\nbring them in, manage them and\n\n1133\n00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,840\nthen split them up and send them out\ninto other areas of the network.\n\n1134\n00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,640\nSo, we may see those.\n\n1135\n00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,500\nThose are not unrealistic to see today.\n\n1136\n00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,489\n>> Right.\n>> Modems.\n\n1137\n00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,310\nA modulation demodulation device.\n\n1138\n00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,820\nI feel like Marvin the Martian\nwhen I say that [LAUGH], right.\n\n1139\n00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,440\nSo modulation demodulation device,\nwe'll talk about analog and\n\n1140\n00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,500\ndigital signals a little later on, and\nwhat modulation demodulation means.\n\n1141\n00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,950\nWe still see modems out there.\n\n1142\n00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:28,170\nThey do exist, they're not totally gone\nthe way of the dinosaur, but they're very\n\n1143\n00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:33,190\nunusual to find in enterprise environments\ntoday, unless they're on backup systems.\n\n1144\n00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,438\n>> I was gonna say, a backup, [CROSSTALK]\nsolution or something like that.\n\n1145\n00:50:34,438 --> 00:50:37,688\n>> They have a dedicated line coming\nin for that, maybe in a phone system,\n\n1146\n00:50:37,688 --> 00:50:41,048\nwhere you have a maintenance port where\nsomebody can literally call in and\n\n1147\n00:50:41,048 --> 00:50:44,070\nconnect through a modem,\nbe able to get in to do something.\n\n1148\n00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,870\nBut for average everyday use, certainly\nat home, unless you're in a part of\n\n1149\n00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:52,510\nthe world where connectivity tends to be\nchallenging because of the terrain and\n\n1150\n00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:55,860\nthe environmental conditions and\nmaybe the technological conditions.\n\n1151\n00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,960\nThe infrastructure,\n\n1152\n00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,170\nyou probably are not finding modems\nin most people's homes anymore.\n\n1153\n00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,320\nAt least a traditional old fashioned\nmodem, let's put it that way.\n\n1154\n00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,130\nThe analog modem.\n\n1155\n00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,620\n>> Right.\n>> You may find newer cable modems,\n\n1156\n00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,490\ncell modems.\n\n1157\n00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,490\nThose modems still exist\nstill very popular.\n\n1158\n00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:10,980\nA lot of people have them.\n\n1159\n00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,605\nThe hotel I'm staying at I think is using\nthat as their core network infrastructure\n\n1160\n00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:18,136\ncuz lord knows I can barely\ndownload anything while I'm there.\n\n1161\n00:51:18,136 --> 00:51:19,626\n>> RT 54G\n>> Exactly, right.\n\n1162\n00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:22,390\n[LAUGH] Got a guy on\nthe roof with a radar dish.\n\n1163\n00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:26,280\nTrying to figure out where\nthe zenith is to hit the horizon.\n\n1164\n00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,590\nThe reality is that we still find them,\n\n1165\n00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,640\nwe just don't find the older analog\nversion of these today, right.\n\n1166\n00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,870\nAlright, so multi-\n>> I've got to ask you.\n\n1167\n00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,032\nDo you miss the noise that it used\nto make when it made the connection?\n\n1168\n00:51:36,032 --> 00:51:37,945\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We should see if we can get\n\n1169\n00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:38,535\na recording,\n\n1170\n00:51:38,535 --> 00:51:42,045\nan audio of that, maybe we could use\nthat in one of our sequences here.\n\n1171\n00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:44,715\nI do miss that dial up\nnoise cuz it was tangible.\n\n1172\n00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:46,151\nYou knew you were connecting to something.\n\n1173\n00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:47,665\n>> Exactly.\n>> It was the excitement where you had\n\n1174\n00:51:47,665 --> 00:51:50,770\nthat in-between moment where it was trying\nto dial out and you were waiting on\n\n1175\n00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,460\nthe pickup on the other side so you\ndidn't know if you were going to get in.\n\n1176\n00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,687\nSo you always had that little question.\n\n1177\n00:51:54,687 --> 00:51:56,698\n>> And you can almost tell cuz\nyou can hear it go [SOUND] and\n\n1178\n00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:59,396\nthen it goes this one pitch and\nthen the pitch would raise a little bit,\n\n1179\n00:51:59,396 --> 00:52:01,894\nthat's a little faster then\nthe pitch would raise a little bit.\n\n1180\n00:52:01,894 --> 00:52:04,135\nI'm going to get a better connection\nthis time, I can feel it.\n\n1181\n00:52:04,135 --> 00:52:07,180\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah they're both probably thinking,\n\n1182\n00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,760\nwhat a bunch of geeks, man?\n\n1183\n00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,385\n>> Yeah\n>> You need to get a hobby or something.\n\n1184\n00:52:10,385 --> 00:52:12,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's the good old days, right.\n\n1185\n00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,160\nWe're just sitting here,\nwe're talking about the good old days.\n\n1186\n00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,740\nSee this is what happens when\nyou do IT for a long time.\n\n1187\n00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,610\n>> Yup\n>> You get to sit around and\n\n1188\n00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,800\ntalk about old technology.\n\n1189\n00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,820\n>> Reminisce about stuff\nfrom way back when.\n\n1190\n00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,380\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Like three of four years ago.\n\n1191\n00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,743\n>> Yeah, right, just maybe even last week\n>> I mean heck.\n\n1192\n00:52:24,743 --> 00:52:25,823\n>> It does change pretty fast.\n\n1193\n00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:27,123\n>> It does, it does.\n\n1194\n00:52:27,123 --> 00:52:30,550\nAnd so we have this idea of\nusing these older devices,\n\n1195\n00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,100\nmaybe in a newer form multiplexers.\n\n1196\n00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:37,050\nYou may not see multiplexers much,\nthese are used with T lines,\n\n1197\n00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,400\nISDN lines, T1 lines, et cetera.\n\n1198\n00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,280\nSo you may still see them,\n\n1199\n00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,520\ndepending on whether or not you're\ninvolved in setting up networks, and maybe\n\n1200\n00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,720\nbringing them into a datacenter somewhere,\nbringing them into a wiring cage.\n\n1201\n00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,430\nYou may see a multiplexer up on the wall,\nbut\n\n1202\n00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:52,170\nthey're also not as popular\nas they used to be.\n\n1203\n00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,910\nWe don't have to split channels\nreally that much anymore.\n\n1204\n00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,970\nA lot of this is now done over VoIP\nwhere we're just bringing in IP\n\n1205\n00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,230\nconnectivity directly.\n\n1206\n00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,480\nWe Manage it through a switch.\n\n1207\n00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,790\nIt's all done with software\nbased networking as opposed to\n\n1208\n00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,480\nhardware interfaces.\n\n1209\n00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,920\nSo these devices are tending\nto now become less popular.\n\n1210\n00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,700\nYou see them in ISP core environments\nwhere they're doing heavy duty.\n\n1211\n00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,320\nLifting concentration of bandwidth and\nswitching, but\n\n1212\n00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,600\nyou don't see them a lot\nin just average networks.\n\n1213\n00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,220\nLike, we used to have a few in our office,\nand they've been dark for a few years.\n\n1214\n00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,060\nWe keep them on the wall because now we\ncan obviously just explain to people and\n\n1215\n00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,340\nshow it to them in our wiring rooms.\n\n1216\n00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,460\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> But they haven't\nbeen active in probably six or\n\n1217\n00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,920\nseven years since we\nstopped splitting T1's.\n\n1218\n00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,890\nSo just think about that.\n\n1219\n00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:34,500\nThe Knicks, the network interface cards,\nthese could take any variety of forms.\n\n1220\n00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,725\nWe have wireless cards, y earth cards\ntoday, all sorts of cards there.\n\n1221\n00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:42,285\nMaybe we could throw a quick\npicture up of a multiplexer, and\n\n1222\n00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,665\nmaybe a quick picture of a network card.\n\n1223\n00:53:44,665 --> 00:53:47,565\nI'm hoping everybody will have a good\nmental image of a network card,\n\n1224\n00:53:47,565 --> 00:53:49,695\nbut they may have not seen\na multiplexer before.\n\n1225\n00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,815\nThat's something that we may just\nwant to show people real quickly.\n\n1226\n00:53:53,275 --> 00:53:59,907\nSo, let's see if we can find\na multiplexer We have the,\n\n1227\n00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:02,610\nyeah, that one there, probably that.\n\n1228\n00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,930\nWe have the actual architectural\ndesign of what a multiplexer did.\n\n1229\n00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,490\n>> There, that’s what we want to see.\n\n1230\n00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,860\n>> There’s a, looks like it is,\n\n1231\n00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,590\nyeah it’s gonna be not from [INAUDIBLE] or\nactually it may be [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1232\n00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,865\nI was going to say,\nnot from [INAUDIBLE], but we don't know.\n\n1233\n00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:19,400\n[LAUGH] It is going to be basically,\nif you look at it,\n\n1234\n00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,350\nit doesn't look that much different\nthan what we may be used to seeing.\n\n1235\n00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:24,710\nYeah, it just any one of these.\n\n1236\n00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:29,460\nIt may not look that much different\nthan what you're used to seeing in a,\n\n1237\n00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,350\nmaybe, a combo of a switch and\n\n1238\n00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,790\na router and a bridge,\ncuz that's kinda what I think about.\n\n1239\n00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,230\nWe got different inputs there.\n\n1240\n00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:39,870\nYou can see probably\nwhat either is fiber or\n\n1241\n00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,850\nmaybe coax can't really tell what the,\nyeah.\n\n1242\n00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,620\nCan't, it's maybe fibre,\nhard to see just from the diagram.\n\n1243\n00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,760\n>> Usually transmit and receive.\n\n1244\n00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,350\nSo, I'm gonna assume that's fibre.\n\n1245\n00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:49,040\n>> Maybe.\nYeah.\n\n1246\n00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,040\nJust I'm assuming it is.\n\n1247\n00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,630\nBut, because we can't, it's very unclear,\nat least what we're looking at.\n\n1248\n00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,010\nBut, you've got some different\nconnection points there.\n\n1249\n00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:58,730\nYou've got what looks like LAN and\nWAN connection and console,\n\n1250\n00:54:58,730 --> 00:54:59,810\noff to the right there.\n\n1251\n00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:00,990\nAnd so we're bringing in those...\n\n1252\n00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,700\nThe cables basically splitting\nthat solution out, and\n\n1253\n00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,480\nbeing able to just carve it\nup with the multiplexers.\n\n1254\n00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,490\nWe talked about a NIC, or\nmaybe just a network card of some kind.\n\n1255\n00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:19,250\nAgain, it doesnt really matter what it is,\nyou probably have a good indication,\n\n1256\n00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,960\na good idea in your mind,\nof what a network card may look like.\n\n1257\n00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,640\nBut yeah, there's a million varieties.\n\n1258\n00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,850\nYou can see many of them there.\n\n1259\n00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:25,830\nSome of them are wireless.\n\n1260\n00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,910\nYou can see the ones that have\nthe wireless antennas coming out\n\n1261\n00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:28,610\nthe back there.\n\n1262\n00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:31,800\nWe have network cards like\nthis one that we plug in.\n\n1263\n00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,760\nPretty straight forward, right?\n\n1264\n00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,780\n>> Right.\n>> We just plug in and\n\n1265\n00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,540\nwe check connectivity on the back.\n\n1266\n00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,490\nCollision, that kind of thing.\n\n1267\n00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:40,080\nAnd so that what a standard card would be.\n\n1268\n00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,840\nThat's got a b and c connector on it so\n\n1269\n00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,020\nthat's actually going to be one that could\nbe co-ax as well as RJ45 connectors.\n\n1270\n00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,560\nSo that's a dual.\n\n1271\n00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,175\nLet's call that a dual NICs?\n\n1272\n00:55:49,175 --> 00:55:51,415\nAnd those NICs could be used for\neither solution.\n\n1273\n00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,225\nProbably older by today's standards,\n\n1274\n00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,715\nprobably not seeing that in\nproduction much anymore, right.\n\n1275\n00:55:55,715 --> 00:55:57,955\nSo we have all those different types.\n\n1276\n00:55:57,955 --> 00:55:58,455\nIt's a quad core, right.\n\n1277\n00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:01,601\nA quad core grabber so you've got four\nports there that you can connect into.\n\n1278\n00:56:01,601 --> 00:56:04,016\n>> It really just depends on what type\nof media you need to connect to, right.\n\n1279\n00:56:04,016 --> 00:56:06,219\n>> It does, right.\nCuz a fiber optic On the far end we'll\n\n1280\n00:56:06,219 --> 00:56:10,145\nlook different, different connectors on\nthe back for instance et cetera, so just\n\n1281\n00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:14,185\nremember that and remember as multiplexers\nis gonna allow us so we didn't really draw\n\n1282\n00:56:14,185 --> 00:56:17,548\nit out, let me just make that specific\nstatement as we talk about it, so\n\n1283\n00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:21,303\nput the picture up we talk about it like\na fiber as well as the RGA 45, well let me\n\n1284\n00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:25,115\njust make the connection for you, again,\nno pun intended here, that the idea is\n\n1285\n00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:29,380\nthat we allow mimic devices to connect and\ncommunicate over different mediums, right?\n\n1286\n00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,020\nSo we may mix fiber and\nmay mix the copper wire ethernet cable.\n\n1287\n00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,850\nThat's what a multiplexer\nwas designed to do.\n\n1288\n00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,540\nIt'd mix different connection mediums and\nallow different networks\n\n1289\n00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:42,680\nto effectively be brought together, and as\nI said, unless you're splitting channels,\n\n1290\n00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,640\nsplitting different things when you're\nbringing in different solutions,\n\n1291\n00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,550\nlike a T1, an ISDN, something like that,\nyou may not see multiplexers any more,\n\n1292\n00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:50,710\nbecause we just don't have need for them.\n\n1293\n00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:54,280\n>> Would your cable modem then, if you're\ngetting your TV and your Internet and\n\n1294\n00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,200\nyour telephone from your cable system.\n\n1295\n00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,550\n>> You can think of it as\na kind of multiplexer.\n\n1296\n00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,440\nIt's all being delivered over the copper,\nright.\n\n1297\n00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,920\nSo it's all being delivered over that.\n\n1298\n00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,260\nThe last mile may be fiber, right,\n\n1299\n00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,610\ncoming in from let's say the switching,\nyou know, box.\n\n1300\n00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:14,110\nWherever the cable company has their\nlast mile connection out to your house.\n\n1301\n00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,090\nThat may be fiber to the curb, but\n\n1302\n00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,400\ncoming in you're not running fiber\nup you're running copper in.\n\n1303\n00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,980\nSo as a result they dumb it down,\nthey stomp it down.\n\n1304\n00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,990\nThat's what those stupid little filters\nyou install, all that stuff is for.\n\n1305\n00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:28,630\nSo they'd dumb it down, and then basically\nthat box does act like a kind of\n\n1306\n00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:32,430\nmultiplexer, in the sense that it does\naggregate different connections, but\n\n1307\n00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,130\nthey're all coming in on the same media,\nright, in the sense that it's all copper.\n\n1308\n00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:39,320\nSo if we actually brought the copper in\nfrom the last mouth through the cable, or\n\n1309\n00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,050\nrather through the curb in, then yeah,\nwe could actually see it as being\n\n1310\n00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,590\na traditional multiplexer,\nthat would actually make a lot of sense.\n\n1311\n00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:47,550\nAll right, very good, very good,\nso we went through those things\n\n1312\n00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:50,110\nright worked through all that I think\nthat brought us up to firewalls so\n\n1313\n00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,870\nlets talk about firewalls for\na minute, right?\n\n1314\n00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:55,400\nSo yeah we've talked about do you have\nhubs and switches and routers and\n\n1315\n00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,210\nall this stuff.\n\n1316\n00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:59,003\nDo we have that network diagram\nthat we were talking about?\n\n1317\n00:57:59,003 --> 00:57:59,590\n>> Let's see, yeah.\n\n1318\n00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:02,370\n>> Don't remember if we have that but\nthat's a different one.\n\n1319\n00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,230\nThat's the one we were\ngonna will look at later.\n\n1320\n00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,740\n>> I'll find it.\n\n1321\n00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,350\n>> No big deal.\n\n1322\n00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,280\nWe don't really need a diagram per say.\n\n1323\n00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,920\nMy bad for not thinking about\nus having one to put up, but\n\n1324\n00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,200\njust the idea of a firewall, right?\n\n1325\n00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,400\nThe firewall is gonna be this device,\ntypically hardware based,\n\n1326\n00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,270\ncan be software based,\nso it can be either one.\n\n1327\n00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:20,050\nCan be a virtual or\na physical firewall, by the way, so\n\n1328\n00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,150\nit doesn't have to be\nnecessarily a physical thing.\n\n1329\n00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:25,980\nBut it's gonna be this device that we\nsetup between the outside world and\n\n1330\n00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,324\nthe inside world.\n\n1331\n00:58:27,324 --> 00:58:29,740\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So when we're doing that we're gonna.\n\n1332\n00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,640\nYeah that one may work.\n\n1333\n00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,160\nThat looks like that has a firewall on it.\n\n1334\n00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,360\nRight so just the device there.\n\n1335\n00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,210\nGot a little router in there.\n\n1336\n00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:34,890\nThat's perfect right.\n\n1337\n00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,390\nSo the idea there is\nthat we have a firewall.\n\n1338\n00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:41,100\nIt's going to separate the external\ninternet off to the right there\n\n1339\n00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,660\nfrom the DMZ which will be off to the left\nphysically define separate VLAN or\n\n1340\n00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,610\nseparate physical or logical network.\n\n1341\n00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,120\n>> Mhm.\n\n1342\n00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,610\n>> And then coming down into the LAN\nallows us to segment our network traffic\n\n1343\n00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,160\nin effect and\nsplit it into different segments.\n\n1344\n00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,410\nAnd the firewall acts as a filtering and\nintrusion prevention,\n\n1345\n00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,650\npotentially intrusion detection device and\nalso a login device.\n\n1346\n00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:02,930\nRight?\nWe control access log inbound and\n\n1347\n00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:03,890\noutbound traffic there.\n\n1348\n00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:07,190\nSo, wanna make sure we have a good\nunderstanding of the concept of firewall.\n\n1349\n00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:10,875\nOne of our previous sessions.\n\n1350\n00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:11,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1351\n00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,390\nOne of our previous episodes we'd talked\nabout the different generations of\n\n1352\n00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:15,640\nfirewalls, right.\n\n1353\n00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,320\n>> Right, Gen1 through 5.\n\n1354\n00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:16,920\n>> Gen1 through 5.\n\n1355\n00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,540\nTalked about them.\n\n1356\n00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,560\nSo I encourage you to go back.\n\n1357\n00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,510\nTake a look.\n\n1358\n00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:20,520\nRemind yourself of that.\n\n1359\n00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,930\nDo a quick review there.\n\n1360\n00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,530\nWe had Gen1,\nwhich were basically filtering firewalls.\n\n1361\n00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,810\nVery, very basic.\n\n1362\n00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,680\nWe have proxying firewalls.\n\n1363\n00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,540\nAll the way up through Gen5, fifth gen or\nnext gen firewalls, that are virtual\n\n1364\n00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:36,040\nkernel firewalls, that reconstruct kernel\non the fly and basically rebuild the TCP\n\n1365\n00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,220\nnetwork stack on demand for each of the\npackets that they're gonna interdict so\n\n1366\n00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,330\nwe have some pretty complicated stuff\ngoing on there, but at the end of the day,\n\n1367\n00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,610\na firewall is gonna be an access\ncontrol device that does filtering for\n\n1368\n00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:49,440\nus and interdicts traffic based\non what we're talking about.\n\n1369\n00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,020\nAnd I know I mentioned at some point,\n\n1370\n00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,930\nalthough we didn't throw the URL up for\nit.\n\n1371\n00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,580\nMaybe you could do a quick Google\nsearch for me while we're doing this.\n\n1372\n00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:00,070\nI mentioned good warriorsofthe.net at some\npoint, and I know I use it with all my\n\n1373\n01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:05,150\nstudents in my network plus classes,\nsecurity plus I show them that, video, and\n\n1374\n01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,170\nso it's good warriors of the .NET,\nand so you spell out of the net,\n\n1375\n01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,545\njust do of the net video,\nthat one right there, the second one, and\n\n1376\n01:00:10,545 --> 01:00:13,845\nso, you can go out and find this we\naren't going to play the video for you.\n\n1377\n01:00:13,845 --> 01:00:14,995\nIt's about a ten minute clip.\n\n1378\n01:00:14,995 --> 01:00:18,065\nIt's an animated clip it's\ndone by Seaman's labs and\n\n1379\n01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:20,165\nit's just really really cool.\n\n1380\n01:00:20,165 --> 01:00:24,397\nSo maybe we can just go ahead and grab\na URL and just put it in there for them.\n\n1381\n01:00:24,397 --> 01:00:24,917\n>> Oh, these?\n\n1382\n01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:27,047\n>> So whichever one, yeah.\n\n1383\n01:00:27,047 --> 01:00:29,257\nJust one of the ones that's out there and\njust pause it so\n\n1384\n01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:31,017\nit doesn't actually stop playing, right?\n\n1385\n01:00:31,017 --> 01:00:34,097\nAnd then you could just give them\nthe URL and just let them see it.\n\n1386\n01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:38,097\nAnd so the idea is that you may wanna take\na look at this if you've never seen this.\n\n1387\n01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:41,257\nIt's gonna cover all of the connectivity\nwe've just been discussing.\n\n1388\n01:00:41,257 --> 01:00:45,347\nIt puts the OSI model, the hub,\nthe router, the switch,\n\n1389\n01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:48,520\nthe bridge, the cabling, the firewall.\n\n1390\n01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:54,730\nThe proxy server, the VP and\nall that stuff into proper perspective,\n\n1391\n01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,310\nand it's just a great way to go through\nand get it straight in your mind and\n\n1392\n01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,290\nunderstand what it does.\n\n1393\n01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,425\nIt's a really cool little video.\n\n1394\n01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:03,015\nLiterally take you about\nten minutes to watch.\n\n1395\n01:01:03,015 --> 01:01:03,555\n>> All right.\n\n1396\n01:01:03,555 --> 01:01:05,295\n>> And it's really dated so\nand it's kind of old and\n\n1397\n01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,115\ncool because you have\nthe Netscape browser in there.\n\n1398\n01:01:07,115 --> 01:01:08,055\n>> Oh, nice.\n>> So you can tell\n\n1399\n01:01:08,055 --> 01:01:11,045\nhow old it is because Netscape\nwas the browser they used, but\n\n1400\n01:01:11,045 --> 01:01:14,370\nit's still a really neat little\npiece of internet history.\n\n1401\n01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,660\nOne you definitely should take a look at.\n\n1402\n01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,490\nSo if you get a chance take a look\nat that it'll do you some good,\n\n1403\n01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,860\nhelp you just formally\nreview all this material.\n\n1404\n01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,460\nBut we were talking about firewalls,\nlet's talk about proxy servers for\n\n1405\n01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,160\njust a minute.\n\n1406\n01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,100\nSo the idea with proxy servers is\nthe idea of being able to go in and\n\n1407\n01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:32,700\nhave a box again, physical,\nvirtual, software based,\n\n1408\n01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:36,520\nhardware based, really not as important\nas understanding what the proxy does.\n\n1409\n01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,100\nIt is going to speed up access to\nan external network of some kind for\n\n1410\n01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,240\nus, by taking our requests, going out and\ngetting them on our behalf,\n\n1411\n01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,870\nbringing them back, caching them, so\nthat the next time somebody asks,\n\n1412\n01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:52,170\nwe feed it right from the device and\nno longer go out and have to go get it.\n\n1413\n01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:55,500\nSo we see this with internet access,\nwhere we use internet proxies\n\n1414\n01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,810\nto be able to speed up internet\nrequests for browsing sessions.\n\n1415\n01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,390\nGoing out to fulfill internet content,\nright?\n\n1416\n01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,770\nSo we use Microsoft made proxy products.\n\n1417\n01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,850\nThey had them in their catalogs for\na long time.\n\n1418\n01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,700\nOther vendors made proxy products.\n\n1419\n01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:12,020\nAnd so they're used basically as speeding\nup, to speed up our network traffic,\n\n1420\n01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,510\nas speeding up devices.\n\n1421\n01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,880\nOur remote access server's what we\ntraditionally call RAS servers,\n\n1422\n01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,380\nremote access servers.\n\n1423\n01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,360\nThese again generically,\nwould be servers that allow for\n\n1424\n01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,320\nexternal parties to come\nin from the outside, right?\n\n1425\n01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:28,130\nTo be able to access internal\nland based resources\n\n1426\n01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:32,060\nfrom the WAN from outside as if\nthey were sitting inside the WAN.\n\n1427\n01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,680\nThat's really what remote\naccess servers do.\n\n1428\n01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,860\nWe'll talk at some point later\nabout radius servers, and AAA,\n\n1429\n01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:40,860\nwhere we talk about RAS servers that are\ngoing to be able to do Call Accounting,\n\n1430\n01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,700\nAuthentication, and\nLogging and Authorization\n\n1431\n01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,290\nto make sure that we understand who is\ncoming in, and what they're looking at.\n\n1432\n01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:48,450\nSo that's just an extension\nof what we do with RAS.\n\n1433\n01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,960\nWe do radius, which will call,\nwhich will effectively log all that.\n\n1434\n01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,420\nBut the RAS solution is just\nbasically being able to control this\n\n1435\n01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,450\nexternal requirement for\naccess to internal resources.\n\n1436\n01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:02,820\nAnd run it through a coordinated system\nthat we then manage on the network,\n\n1437\n01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,960\nhowever we do that.\n\n1438\n01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,920\nAnd again, multiple vendors that do that,\nall the major operating system vendors do,\n\n1439\n01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,310\nand most of the major equipment vendors\nmake some sort of remote access solution.\n\n1440\n01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:13,310\nVPN concentrators.\n\n1441\n01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:15,710\nWe've talked about concentrators\nfrom up above, same thing,\n\n1442\n01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,990\njust specific to VPNs,\nas opposed to more generically.\n\n1443\n01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:21,790\nBut the idea is the same,\nthat we will basically bring in and\n\n1444\n01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:24,450\nconcentrate all this remote\naccess requirement or\n\n1445\n01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,720\nreference material from people\ncoming in and wanting to see stuff.\n\n1446\n01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,510\nThrough this particular device,\nthey speed up access, and\n\n1447\n01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:34,990\nallow us to be able to get in and\napply access control, logging, right,\n\n1448\n01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:37,940\nauthentication capabilities,\nmaybe a little NAC in there,\n\n1449\n01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:42,150\nso a little network access control,\nwhere we remediate based on some sort of\n\n1450\n01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:46,320\nbaseline or health check, something\nlike that, or network access protection.\n\n1451\n01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,480\n>> Unknown or untrusted computers\ntrying to get remote access.\n\n1452\n01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,152\n>> Absolutely so you have NAC or\nNAP depending on the dealer and\n\n1453\n01:03:52,152 --> 01:03:55,260\nwhat they call it these days, but\nbasically it's the same concept.\n\n1454\n01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:55,839\nAll right, so very good.\n\n1455\n01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:59,236\nYou will talk through a lot of that and\nwe talked through a lot of the different\n\n1456\n01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:02,226\nthought processes around the building\nblocks of communication.\n\n1457\n01:04:02,226 --> 01:04:04,940\nWhy don't we quickly talk\nabout the network designs,\n\n1458\n01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:08,598\nthe types that are out there, and\nthat way we can probably go through those\n\n1459\n01:04:08,598 --> 01:04:11,920\ntopologies really quickly,\nnetwork topology on the LAN side.\n\n1460\n01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,530\nAnd then we'll probably at\nthat point be positioned for\n\n1461\n01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:17,130\na break before we come back and talk about\nsome of the transmission mechanisms.\n\n1462\n01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:20,900\nSo, in the LAN side, on the local area\nnetwork, and we'll deal with this on\n\n1463\n01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,830\nthe WAN side separately in another\nsession, right, a little later on.\n\n1464\n01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,710\nBut here on the LAN side we've\ngot five topologies that we\n\n1465\n01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,650\ntraditionally think about.\n\n1466\n01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,770\nWe have a bus topology,\nas you can see there.\n\n1467\n01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:33,650\nThe bus topology is gonna be\na straight line topology,\n\n1468\n01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,720\nwe usually used a core\nnetwork cable of some kind.\n\n1469\n01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,065\nUsually it was coax cable,\nit might not be Ethernet or fiber.\n\n1470\n01:04:39,065 --> 01:04:39,971\n>> Thinnet or thicknet.\n\n1471\n01:04:39,971 --> 01:04:40,772\n>> It could be that, right?\n\n1472\n01:04:40,772 --> 01:04:43,268\nAnd we may still see that\nin some older buildings,\n\n1473\n01:04:43,268 --> 01:04:47,190\nwhere we ran between the floors, and ran\nup and down, we ran coax in the core for\n\n1474\n01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,102\nthe bus, and then spread out to\ndo a star out on the floors,\n\n1475\n01:04:50,102 --> 01:04:52,443\nbecause then we would\nhave the star topology.\n\n1476\n01:04:52,443 --> 01:04:53,686\n>> Hybrid-type topology.\n\n1477\n01:04:53,686 --> 01:04:54,330\n>> We would have a star bus,\n\n1478\n01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:56,480\nthat's what we would call it,\na star bus network, right?\n\n1479\n01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,870\nSo we would have a bus topology\nthat would run between systems.\n\n1480\n01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,690\nThe value of the bus was that everybody\nwas on this connectivity line and\n\n1481\n01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,880\nwe knew where the network started and\nstopped.\n\n1482\n01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,271\nThe down side was, if you broke\nthe connectivity anywhere on that wire,\n\n1483\n01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:12,830\nyou disconnected a machine, turned it off,\nlost that network cable like we\n\n1484\n01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:15,499\ntalked about,\ndidn't lock down that BNC connector, or\n\n1485\n01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:18,366\nyou got your finger in between the tap and\nthe cable, right?\n\n1486\n01:05:18,366 --> 01:05:20,726\nI still remember that,\nI can still point to it right here.\n\n1487\n01:05:20,726 --> 01:05:24,743\nSo if that happened, then what would\nhappen is the entire network segment,\n\n1488\n01:05:24,743 --> 01:05:26,640\nthe entire bus line, went dark.\n\n1489\n01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,091\nAll the machines got knocked off.\n\n1490\n01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,251\n>> Not just that one node,\nit was everybody.\n\n1491\n01:05:29,251 --> 01:05:30,558\n>> All of them.\nSo we used to have these stories I\n\n1492\n01:05:30,558 --> 01:05:31,170\nwould hear about and\n\n1493\n01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:33,990\nI would actually see all the time,\nyou know, like travel agencies were a good\n\n1494\n01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:36,660\nexample of this cuz they usually were\nwired up this way in the old days.\n\n1495\n01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:39,230\nSo you get one agent that will be done for\nthe day and they turn their computer off,\n\n1496\n01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,740\nknock out the whole network\nbecause everybody was on a bus.\n\n1497\n01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,960\nSo you either had to leave\nmachines on all the time or\n\n1498\n01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,651\nyou all had to decide who\nwas gonna turn them off.\n\n1499\n01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:49,599\nSo this is the downside of a bus, so\nobviously we don't really use this in\n\n1500\n01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,860\ntraditional enterprise level\nnetworks much anymore.\n\n1501\n01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:56,410\nIf we do it's really only connecting\nrouters, router to router,\n\n1502\n01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,640\nrouter to switch, something like that\nwhere we have a bus line that is not\n\n1503\n01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,130\never gonna be connected to a machine\nthat could be turned off, but\n\n1504\n01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:04,410\nan end point device that\nstays on all the time, right?\n\n1505\n01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:06,975\nSo it's a core carrying\ndevice of our network\n\n1506\n01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:11,705\ntraffic in between two well defined end\npoints typically, and we would use an end\n\n1507\n01:06:11,705 --> 01:06:16,695\npoint to end point kind of connections\nscenario when we dealt with the bus, so\n\n1508\n01:06:16,695 --> 01:06:18,790\nwe would want to make sure\nwe had that well defined.\n\n1509\n01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,051\nWhen we deal with a star topology,\n\n1510\n01:06:20,051 --> 01:06:22,580\nthis is the topology that you're\nprobably very familiar with.\n\n1511\n01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:26,590\nIt's the most common one on the planet\nthat we see today with Ethernet networks.\n\n1512\n01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:30,050\nYou would see all the machines laid out,\nconnected via cable back\n\n1513\n01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:33,580\nto some sort of a patch plate on the wall,\nultimately up to a patch panel and\n\n1514\n01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:37,000\nthen back over a bus line to a core\nsomewhere where they would go out.\n\n1515\n01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,510\nBut the star is what would happen in\nthat office on that floor where all\n\n1516\n01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:45,090\nthe machines are hooked up to a typically\ngonna be to a switch because the switch\n\n1517\n01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:49,320\nwould allow you to disconnect one node and\nnot lose connectivity for everybody right\n\n1518\n01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,610\nSo we would do that and the star simply\nconnects all those machines together.\n\n1519\n01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:54,337\nBut the key difference between that and\n\n1520\n01:06:54,337 --> 01:06:56,951\nthe bus is you can allow people\nto disconnect, turn off, or\n\n1521\n01:06:56,951 --> 01:07:00,682\nliterally unplug without worrying about\ntaking down an entire network with a star.\n\n1522\n01:07:00,682 --> 01:07:04,763\nSo, with the ring, we would call that,\ntraditionally, token ring by the way,\n\n1523\n01:07:04,763 --> 01:07:06,811\nbecause it was a proprietary topology.\n\n1524\n01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:10,090\nIBM created the token ring standard and\nconcept.\n\n1525\n01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:13,180\nThey went ahead and marketed it,\nbrought it to market, and for many,\n\n1526\n01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:16,450\nmany years it was one of\nthe standards of Ethernet networking.\n\n1527\n01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:19,771\nAnd you would travel in a ring,\nin either clockwise or counter-clockwise,\n\n1528\n01:07:19,771 --> 01:07:20,812\nlogical not physical.\n\n1529\n01:07:20,812 --> 01:07:23,365\nSometimes [LAUGH] I always get\na student who responds in class.\n\n1530\n01:07:23,365 --> 01:07:25,040\nSo, all right, so\njust let me get this straight, right?\n\n1531\n01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,910\nSo you lay out the room in a ring and\n\n1532\n01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,720\neverybody sits around in\na circle looking at each other?\n\n1533\n01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,100\n>> A real pow wow or\nsomething, yeah, I can see it.\n\n1534\n01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,300\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, thank you for playing.\n\n1535\n01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,730\nNo, that's not what we meant.\n\n1536\n01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:36,770\nWhat we meant is that it was\na logical ring, not a physical ring.\n\n1537\n01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:37,520\n>> Data flow, data flow.\n\n1538\n01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,282\n>> Just like it was a logical star,\n\n1539\n01:07:39,282 --> 01:07:42,780\nwe didn't sit at various\nend points of the room.\n\n1540\n01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,980\nWasn't like that either.\n\n1541\n01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,020\nJohnny, you go over there, right?\n\n1542\n01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:47,980\nBob, you're over there.\n\n1543\n01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,270\nSal, you're down here.\n\n1544\n01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,120\nEverybody look sharp.\n\n1545\n01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,170\nLet's make those points, right?\n\n1546\n01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,300\nNo, it doesn't work like that.\n\n1547\n01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:57,020\nSo it is a logical ring and so\ntraffic flow flows in a ring logically.\n\n1548\n01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,640\nPhysically, it's laid out like a star.\n\n1549\n01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,420\nThe machines are laid out\nnormally in a cube pattern or\n\n1550\n01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,230\nwhatever you did where\nyour work stations were.\n\n1551\n01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:05,870\nBut the way they were wired up\nwould have been the logical ring.\n\n1552\n01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:09,700\nAnd so we use this wiring,\ntypically coax wiring would've been used.\n\n1553\n01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,152\nAlthough we could've seen Cat4 cables,\nso it could've been potentially for\n\n1554\n01:08:13,152 --> 01:08:15,790\nhigher speed rings towards\nthe end of its life cycle.\n\n1555\n01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:20,200\nSome Ethernet cabling, with maybe an RJ-45\nlooking-like connector, although,\n\n1556\n01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,280\nnow there's now connectors like alligator\nclips that are massively big, big things.\n\n1557\n01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,970\nBut actually, let's just see,\njust for giggles.\n\n1558\n01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:32,150\nLet's see if we can find\na image real quick of a MAU,\n\n1559\n01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:37,200\nmultistation access unit, for a token\nring network, or an MSAL, either way.\n\n1560\n01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,052\n>> I was gonna say.\n\n1561\n01:08:41,352 --> 01:08:43,070\n>> So yeah, maybe do that one right there.\n\n1562\n01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,206\nThat's a good one.\nSo if you take a look at that,\n\n1563\n01:08:45,206 --> 01:08:49,470\nwhat you could see is you could see\nhow big these connection points were.\n\n1564\n01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,570\nAnd you would slide it in,\nyeah, you actually do that.\n\n1565\n01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:52,520\nSo what would happen is,\n\n1566\n01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:56,130\nyou would take the cable and if you can\nimagine the cable is gonna mirror this\n\n1567\n01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:59,120\ndevice with a clip on the end like\nhanging down here where my thumb is.\n\n1568\n01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,900\nAnd so, you would go and play, right in\nthere, you would slide it in right there,\n\n1569\n01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,760\nand it would make this snapping noise,\n\n1570\n01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:07,410\nlike it was locking home, almost like\npulling the bolt back on a rifle.\n\n1571\n01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:11,190\nAnd it would click in and then you had\nthese two wing clips that you would have\n\n1572\n01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:15,050\nto press down to pull the connector out,\nbecause it would actually lock in.\n\n1573\n01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,420\nAnd it was and L,\nit was like an elbow shape.\n\n1574\n01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,385\nSo it would be like this, right,\nand the head of the cable connector\n\n1575\n01:09:20,385 --> 01:09:23,195\nwent in this way and\nthe cable dangled down the side, so,\n\n1576\n01:09:23,195 --> 01:09:25,265\nor it went off this way depending\non what you were doing.\n\n1577\n01:09:25,265 --> 01:09:27,986\nBut it was really, I mean,\nthis was hardcore stuff.\n\n1578\n01:09:27,986 --> 01:09:29,396\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So this is all proprietary.\n\n1579\n01:09:29,396 --> 01:09:31,866\nAnd you can imagine,\nyou went out and you didn't go-\n\n1580\n01:09:31,866 --> 01:09:32,852\n>> You can't pick this up at Best Buy?\n\n1581\n01:09:32,852 --> 01:09:35,431\n>> At New Egg or Best Buy or\nTiger Direct or wherever, no,\n\n1582\n01:09:35,431 --> 01:09:37,183\nyou didn't find it anywhere there.\n\n1583\n01:09:37,183 --> 01:09:40,958\nYou had to go get this stuff\nfrom an authorized dealer and so\n\n1584\n01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:43,049\nthis is what an MSAU or a SAU was.\n\n1585\n01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:47,125\nI don't know which one this was or there\nwas an MSAU multistation access unit or\n\n1586\n01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:49,060\na secure multistation, whatever.\n\n1587\n01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,330\nBut it was just basically a hub.\n\n1588\n01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,310\nThis is what a hub was\ncalled with token ring.\n\n1589\n01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,669\nAnd so you had, typically,an eight port\nstation, this is where you plugged in.\n\n1590\n01:09:54,669 --> 01:09:56,190\nSo this is what it looked like.\n\n1591\n01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,120\nSo this is what token ring,\nthe physical gear for token ring was.\n\n1592\n01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,880\nAnd then the network ports, obviously,\nhad a different connection point as well.\n\n1593\n01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,880\nThey typically had B and C connectors\non them as we were doing coax for this.\n\n1594\n01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,380\nSo, that's what you would see there.\n\n1595\n01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,660\nSo this is old school, old school.\n\n1596\n01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:10,815\nYou don't tend to see this anymore.\n\n1597\n01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:12,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We see this when we're ripping\n\n1598\n01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:12,960\nout networks.\n\n1599\n01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,200\nWe don't see them where we're\nputting together anymore.\n\n1600\n01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,310\nEven the government's gotten rid\nof their token ring these days.\n\n1601\n01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,520\nSo this is what we see now.\n\n1602\n01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,190\nThere is a newer version of this,\n\n1603\n01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:24,460\nwhich is called FDDI which is fiber-based\ntoken rings, so used in MANs,\n\n1604\n01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:28,400\nmetropolitan area networks where you're\ngonna see under the ground inside a city.\n\n1605\n01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:32,050\nThey're running these solutions\nwhere they got 60 miles or\n\n1606\n01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,920\n50 miles of fiber running in a ring and\nthey have concentric rings.\n\n1607\n01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,170\nAnd they run in opposite directions.\n\n1608\n01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:40,960\nOne ring goes parallel to the other,\nbut they run in opposite directions.\n\n1609\n01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,940\nOne's clockwise, one's counterclockwise,\nso if one of the rings gets damaged,\n\n1610\n01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,860\nthe other ring typically is still running,\nand you still keep the continuity and\n\n1611\n01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:48,230\nthe connectivity in the network.\n\n1612\n01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,060\nSo these are updated token ring networks.\n\n1613\n01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,030\nThey are fiber token ring, FDDI rings.\n\n1614\n01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:55,715\nBut other than that, we don't really\nsee this technology around anymore.\n\n1615\n01:10:55,715 --> 01:10:57,352\nBut this is what a ring\nwould have looked like.\n\n1616\n01:10:57,352 --> 01:11:00,450\nAnd then I think mesh topology on there,\nright?\n\n1617\n01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:05,510\nSo do a rig on this and\nthen a mesh was gonna be total redundancy.\n\n1618\n01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:08,140\nSo a mesh, literally,\nyou think of a spider web, right?\n\n1619\n01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:11,920\nAny point on that network would\nconnect out to all the other points,\n\n1620\n01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,500\nwherever it was.\n\n1621\n01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:16,320\nSo if you had four stations in a mesh,\nyou had connection\n\n1622\n01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,946\npoints coming out from each of those\nfour stations to all the others.\n\n1623\n01:11:18,946 --> 01:11:22,280\nSo each end point had\nfour cables coming and\n\n1624\n01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,710\ngoing to be able to connect\nall the other ones.\n\n1625\n01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,200\nAnd so it was totally redundant.\n\n1626\n01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,040\nYou could take out any\none of the machines and\n\n1627\n01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,590\nall the others were\ncross wired to connect.\n\n1628\n01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:32,806\nBut obviously,\nexponentially as you add machines,\n\n1629\n01:11:32,806 --> 01:11:36,555\nyou get cabling that just becomes so\nbig you can't manage it.\n\n1630\n01:11:36,555 --> 01:11:37,890\nThere's just really no way to do this.\n\n1631\n01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:40,820\nMeshes were really only\nused in very small,\n\n1632\n01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:44,950\nhighly focused networks that had to be\ntotally redundant for various things.\n\n1633\n01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,150\nYou didn't really do a mesh\non a large scale enterprise.\n\n1634\n01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:49,623\nBut these were the five network\ntopology types that we would see.\n\n1635\n01:11:49,623 --> 01:11:50,228\nYou know, and\n\n1636\n01:11:50,228 --> 01:11:53,657\nas you think about getting ready to start\nanswering some questions for the SSCP,\n\n1637\n01:11:53,657 --> 01:11:56,949\nyou wanna make sure you understand these\nnetwork topologies on the LAN side.\n\n1638\n01:11:56,949 --> 01:11:57,912\nVery important.\n\n1639\n01:11:57,912 --> 01:12:00,409\nYeah, we'll come back in\na future conversation and\n\n1640\n01:12:00,409 --> 01:12:04,220\ntalk about the thought process of how\nwe create connectivity on the WAN.\n\n1641\n01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,450\nWe do that in an upcoming episode.\n\n1642\n01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:09,120\nBut for now, we wanna make sure\nthat you're thinking about those,\n\n1643\n01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,250\nthinking about the hardware\nwe just discussed.\n\n1644\n01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:15,289\nTaking a look back is fun, looking at some\nof that old technology with is cool, but\n\n1645\n01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,294\nlooking ahead and understanding what we're\ndoing every day, as you're gonna go out\n\n1646\n01:12:18,294 --> 01:12:22,060\ninto the enterprise and manage Is\nalso going to be really important.\n\n1647\n01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,040\n>> Alright, well sounds good.\n\n1648\n01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,290\nI think that's a good point for\nus to take a little break.\n\n1649\n01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,480\nWhen we come back we'll dive\ninto some more networking.\n\n1650\n01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:32,041\n>> See you soon.\n\n1651\n01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:36,347\n[SOUND] Welcome back\neverybody to our network

but\n\n1706\n01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,420\nthey're going to hear it whether or\nnot they choose to acknowledge it.\n\n1707\n01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,720\nThey have the opportunity at least,\nlet's put it that way, right?\n\n1708\n01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,960\nWhether they want to or not.\n\n1709\n01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,800\nSo that's broadcast.\n\n1710\n01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,770\nThat's everybody.\n\n1711\n01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:13,930\nSo, if you think of radio.\n\n1712\n01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:18,210\nRadio waves going out across the ether and\nthe air.\n\n1713\n01:15:18,210 -->

--> 01:15:44,690\nInstead of one to everyone one to a group,\nand that group is gonna be defined,\n\n1723\n01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:48,720\nI would actually say group instead of\nmany, I would say a

or may not choose to participate.\n\n1726\n01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:58,850\nSo multitask one to a group.\n\n1727\n01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:03,050\nYou know, I often think of pay-per-view,\ncable TV, right?\n\n1728\n01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:05,420\nTuning in the radio station specifically.\n\n1729\n01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,270\nSo maybe you know,\na little Sirius XM or something.\n\n1730\n01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:09,600\nYou get the specific channel.\n\n1731\n01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,090\nThat's a multicast because now we've\nnarrowed down to find that we're gonna be\n\n1732\n01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:17,725\na member of a certain group,\nin order to get that communication.\n\n1733\n01:16:17,725 --> 01:16:19,780\nGroup membership could\nbe tuning into channel,\n\n1734\n01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,350\ncould be paying our monthly\nfee to get cable, right?\n\n1735\n01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:24,180\nWhatever it is, but that's one to a group.\n\n1736\n01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:27,860\nIf you're not in the group, you're\nnot in the multicast IP range, right?\n\n1737\n01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,660\nThe multicast subnet,\nyou don't get that message.\n\n1738\n01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:31,990\n>> Video conferencing.\n\n1739\n01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:34,370\n>> Video conferencing,\nI'm also thinking about desktop imaging.\n\n1740\n01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:36,320\nSo we use multicasting to throw images,\nghosting.\n\n1741\n01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,520\n>> Windows deployment services, yep.\n\n1742\n01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,870\n>> Right, things like that,\nWindows deployment services.\n\n1743\n01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:43,330\nAll done with multicast, cuz you've got to\nbe in the IP subnet Multicast group and\n\n1744\n01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:47,030\neffect right to be able to get that\ninformation, so make sure we're\n\n1745\n01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:50,580\ncomfortable with this idea of how\nthe communication mechanism within and\n\n1746\n01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:54,750\non the land are carved up what\nare the categories of communications.\n\n1747\n01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:57,660\nAnother good knowledge point for\nyou to kind of master and make sure your\n\n1748\n01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:00,610\nthinking about as we broaden that\nknowledge base out a little bit.\n\n1749\n01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,950\nSo, lets add to that I wanna talk\nabout media access methods and\n\n1750\n01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:08,685\ntalk specifically about Carrier Sense\nMultiple Access, what we call CSMA.\n\n1751\n01:17:08,685 --> 01:17:10,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1752\n01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:15,670\n>> CSMA is going to be the general\ndescriptor of how hosts can basically\n\n1753\n01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:21,600\nconnect and or be able to get in, and\nuse this method to transfer information.\n\n1754\n01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,260\nWe also have token passing and\npolling, we haven't added those mixed.\n\n1755\n01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:28,320\nWe'll just add them on the bottom,\nout beyond CSMA.\n\n1756\n01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,880\nCSMA is one category, and\nthen token passing and pulling,\n\n1757\n01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:35,160\nI forgot to mention them as we were\ngetting our notes in order there, but\n\n1758\n01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,130\ntoken passing is in the token\nring kind of token, and\n\n1759\n01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:42,470\npulling is in what we could do when we're\nsignifying up stream or down stream, that\n\n1760\n01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:46,010\nwe have connectivity as a heartbeat for\ninstance, and maybe pulling to do that.\n\n1761\n01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,520\nSo these are other mechanisms and\n\n1762\n01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,840\nmethods, but we want to drill into\ncarrier sense multiple access CSMA and\n\n1763\n01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,490\nspecifically the two subcategories,\nthe collision avoidance and\n\n1764\n01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:59,860\ncollision detection mechanisms that are\nused in order to be able to drive access.\n\n1765\n01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,330\n>> Right.\n>> So let's talk about this.\n\n1766\n01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:04,240\nI asked Mike and\nhe was kind enough to do this for us.\n\n1767\n01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,170\nLabel them four wireless or four wired, so\n\n1768\n01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:09,890\nwe understand where each\nmechanism is gonna be found.\n\n1769\n01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:11,900\nAnd so\nlet's start with collision detection,\n\n1770\n01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,250\neven though it's on\nthe bottom of the list.\n\n1771\n01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,730\nOnly cuz I want to build the thought\nprocess around Ethernet,\n\n1772\n01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:19,560\nthen we'll do the wireless\ncomponent on the the wireless side.\n\n1773\n01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,300\nOkay.\n\n1774\n01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,970\nAnd so when we talk about the wired LAN\nconnection, we talk about collision\n\n1775\n01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:29,700\ndetection, CSMACD allows an endpoint, a\nmachine, to basically listen to the cable.\n\n1776\n01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,600\nWe're listening to the copper wire,\n\n1777\n01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,720\nwe are plugging that copper wire into\nthe back of a network card, into a NIC.\n\n1778\n01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,790\nLayer one is where that connectivity\ntakes place in the OSI model, right,\n\n1779\n01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:39,700\nphysical layer.\n\n1780\n01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:43,680\nWe listen for the electrical pulses\ncoming down the wire, right, so\n\n1781\n01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,540\nthat little burst of electricity\ncomes down the wire,\n\n1782\n01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:50,570\nthe network card reacts to that burst\nof electricity by knowing that there is\n\n1783\n01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:54,910\nsome sort of broadcasting traffic coming\ndown or whether it's broadcast, unicast or\n\n1784\n01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:58,780\nmulticast, generically, there's\ntraffic coming down and as a result,\n\n1785\n01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:03,420\nnow we are going to pay attention to\nthe frames, the data frames on the wire.\n\n1786\n01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:05,720\nPull that packet in as it passes by and\n\n1787\n01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:10,370\nexpected up at layer two of the OSI model,\nso we're going to at that traffic.\n\n1788\n01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:13,230\nAt layer two,\nwe are looking at the MAC address,\n\n1789\n01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:16,150\nat the media access control address.\n\n1790\n01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:19,820\nSo we're going to look at the MAC address\nin the IP header, or in the packet header.\n\n1791\n01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:22,910\nAnd as a result of that if the MAC\naddress matches our interface.\n\n1792\n01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:25,040\nWe're going to continue\nprocessing that packet up.\n\n1793\n01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:25,870\nThe stack.\nIf it doesn't,\n\n1794\n01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:27,890\nwe're going to basically\njust allow it on its way.\n\n1795\n01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,120\nDrop it in effect and\nnot pay attention to it.\n\n1796\n01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:34,310\nAnd so, when this happens,\ncollision detection\n\n1797\n01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:37,960\nis this idea of looking at all packets\nstreaming around back and forth.\n\n1798\n01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:42,076\nAnd every so often two packets will run\nsmack into each other head to head, right?\n\n1799\n01:19:42,076 --> 01:19:44,510\nSo they're coming from\ndifferent directions, and\n\n1800\n01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:48,157\nif you get a mental image in your mind of\nbasically two cars driving down a road,\n\n1801\n01:19:48,157 --> 01:19:49,779\nplaying chicken with each other.\n\n1802\n01:19:49,779 --> 01:19:52,495\nNobody flinches, and boom,\nthey crash into each other.\n\n1803\n01:19:52,495 --> 01:19:55,444\nAnd in a fact, right,\nthe packets are gonna disintegrate.\n\n1804\n01:19:55,444 --> 01:19:59,080\n>> I had a student ask me one time,\nwhat does that sound like?\n\n1805\n01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,275\n>> What does collision sound like?\n\n1806\n01:20:01,275 --> 01:20:04,180\n>> Yes, because I was talking about it,\nand I was saying how you get packets,\n\n1807\n01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:05,650\nyou can only have one on there at a time.\n\n1808\n01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:06,420\nThey can collide.\n\n1809\n01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:09,360\nThat, the nodes are gonna\nhear that collision.\n\n1810\n01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,590\nAnd they're gonna, and\nwe started going into this process.\n\n1811\n01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:14,170\nAnd, so it was a good question I suppose.\n\n1812\n01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:18,030\nIt made me chuckle and\nI had to try not to laugh, in the class.\n\n1813\n01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:20,790\nBut yeah, you wanna know,\ncuz the way I described it was,\n\n1814\n01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,745\nthey're gonna hear this thing.\n\n1815\n01:20:21,745 --> 01:20:24,595\nAnd they're gonna know\nsomething has happened.\n\n1816\n01:20:24,595 --> 01:20:25,095\nI had to.\n\n1817\n01:20:25,095 --> 01:20:29,521\nWhat it sounds like BAM, but it doesn't\nreally sound like that, ladies and\n\n1818\n01:20:29,521 --> 01:20:30,290\ngentlemen.\n\n1819\n01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:32,125\nIt doesn't sound like that.\n\n1820\n01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:37,015\n>> No, it's the sound of a tree making a\nfall in the forest when nobody is around.\n\n1821\n01:20:37,015 --> 01:20:39,217\nThe sound of one hand\nclapping in the forest.\n\n1822\n01:20:39,217 --> 01:20:42,900\nAll right, so\nif we have a collision detection.\n\n1823\n01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,740\nWe have this idea of the collision\ntaking place, right?\n\n1824\n01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:48,240\nThe data packets potentially,\nif we have some sort of collision and\n\n1825\n01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:51,210\nrun into each other, what happens is\nbasically the packet gets destroyed.\n\n1826\n01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:51,940\n>> Right.\nYep.\n\n1827\n01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:56,200\n>> And so as a result of that, what then\nhappens is we have a resend hopefully, so\n\n1828\n01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:01,200\nwith TCP, right, we will resend, cuz we're\nnot acknowledging, with UDP we will not.\n\n1829\n01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,910\nWe'll have that whole\nconversation later in more depth.\n\n1830\n01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:07,780\nBut for right now the idea is\nlet's assume there's a resend.\n\n1831\n01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,290\nThat packet gets resent after\na certain period of time.\n\n1832\n01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:13,630\nAnd so what has to happen\nis we have to step back and\n\n1833\n01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:16,970\ntry to resend from the endpoints\nthat had the collision.\n\n1834\n01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:20,060\nAssuming we are using TCP and\nacknowledging we do a resend.\n\n1835\n01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:25,510\nIf both N points step back and try to\nresend the same exact instant again,\n\n1836\n01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,890\nwe're gonna keep effectively\n>> One more collision, yeah.\n\n1837\n01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:30,060\n>> Having the same collision over and\nover again.\n\n1838\n01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:35,080\nWe have to use a randomized offset,\nsort of timing value that effectively\n\n1839\n01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:38,230\nwill broker this in such a way that\none goes before the other ,right?\n\n1840\n01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:39,490\n>> Yeah\n>> We use, typically,\n\n1841\n01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:42,770\na spanning tree algorithm,\nwhere both parties are running this.\n\n1842\n01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:45,150\nThis is integrated into the network stack,\nby the way.\n\n1843\n01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,910\nIt's part of TCP stack.\n\n1844\n01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:48,810\nWe're not having to do this on our own.\n\n1845\n01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,460\nIt's not like you sit there on\nthe keyboard going all right,\n\n1846\n01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,840\nif I press F12 now\n>> Right.\n\n1847\n01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,000\n>> I'm gonna avoid a collision\nwhen the red light comes on.\n\n1848\n01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,090\n>> I wonder if he's\ngetting ready to push it.\n\n1849\n01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:55,770\nWait, wait.\n>> Exactly.\n\n1850\n01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:58,600\nYou have one job, just watch that button.\n\n1851\n01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,380\nPush that button when I say go.\n\n1852\n01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,370\nIt doesn't work like that.\n\n1853\n01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:04,030\nThis is all automated,\nit's all handled by the systems.\n\n1854\n01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:07,100\nAll this is managed inside\nthe networking stack, but\n\n1855\n01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:11,350\nthis algorithm kicks in, will randomly\ngenerate what's called an offset timer.\n\n1856\n01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:15,210\nThat offset timer effectively says okay,\nwait two milliseconds, wait five,\n\n1857\n01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,480\nwhatever the value is.\n\n1858\n01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:19,800\nEach party figures that out,\nwhatever they do,\n\n1859\n01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,130\nif they randomly,\nhappen to generate the same offset value.\n\n1860\n01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:24,430\nWe step back and do it again.\n\n1861\n01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:28,490\nBut eventually, one party will generate\nan offset value that is smaller,\n\n1862\n01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:29,930\nmeaning goes quicker, than the other,\n\n1863\n01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:34,890\nand as a result we then will be\nable to send without a collision.\n\n1864\n01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:37,630\nWe are detecting the collision\nafter it happens\n\n1865\n01:22:37,630 --> 01:22:38,680\n>> After it's already happened, yep.\n\n1866\n01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,150\n>> And then resetting and\nre-sending as a result.\n\n1867\n01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:46,360\nThis is collision detection, this happens\non the wire, this happens on wired LAN's.\n\n1868\n01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,930\nAnd this is just again, part of\nthe standard architecture mechanism\n\n1869\n01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:51,910\nwithin the ethernet solution,\nthis is how we do it.\n\n1870\n01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:55,120\nCollision avoidance on the other hand.\n\n1871\n01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,040\nhappens on wireless LAN's.\n\n1872\n01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,090\nWe can't detect the collision on the wire.\n\n1873\n01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:00,650\nWe're talking about this during the break,\nright?\n\n1874\n01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:03,120\nHow do you detect the collision when\nthere's no wire to listen to in\n\n1875\n01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,500\nthe first place, right?\n\n1876\n01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:08,300\nWe obviously can tell that we dropped\na packet, but we don't know why.\n\n1877\n01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,370\nAs a result We don't do\ncollision detection.\n\n1878\n01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:15,060\nThe math and the science required to do\nit, just doesn't really get supported.\n\n1879\n01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,700\n>> No.\n>> Because of the architecture.\n\n1880\n01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,540\nInstead, we came up with a very\ncivilized way of doing this.\n\n1881\n01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:20,050\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n1882\n01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:21,380\nIt's very very polite.\n\n1883\n01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:22,865\n>> We all sit around, right?\n\n1884\n01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:25,710\n[LAUGH] And we ask each other if\nanybody plans on doing anything for\n\n1885\n01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:26,610\nthe next five minutes.\n\n1886\n01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:27,630\n>> Right.\n>> If nobody is.\n\n1887\n01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:31,150\nThen maybe we could go out and use the\nwire for a little bit and send something.\n\n1888\n01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:33,810\nAnd so I refer to this as\na civilized networking model.\n\n1889\n01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:36,560\nRight?\nBecause in effect it really is everybody\n\n1890\n01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,680\nasking for permission.\n\n1891\n01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,270\nIn effect,\nbefore we actually send anything.\n\n1892\n01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:46,250\nAnd so what happens on wireless solutions\nwith collision avoidance is, we send out\n\n1893\n01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:50,720\na packet that goes to every machine and\nsays, are you gonna do something?\n\n1894\n01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,290\n>> Right.\n>> In effect, can I use the medium?\n\n1895\n01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:55,550\nAnd if nobody comes back and objects,\n\n1896\n01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:59,960\nthen after everybody gets a chance\nto say no, I get to go and send.\n\n1897\n01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:04,310\nBut if somebody objects, because hey,\nI'm transmitting, then I gotta wait.\n\n1898\n01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,440\nWe avoid collisions by making\nsure nobody else is on the wire,\n\n1899\n01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,520\nbefore we actually use it.\n\n1900\n01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,690\nWire being a relative thing,\nI use that generically,\n\n1901\n01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:15,690\nsaying just the transmission\nmedium not the actual wire, but\n\n1902\n01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:19,270\nas a result of this collision avoidance,\nwe are sending twice the amount of data.\n\n1903\n01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:22,110\nWe're sending the,\nhey can I use the network packet.\n\n1904\n01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:23,180\n>> Then they're responding.\n\n1905\n01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:23,710\n>> Responding.\n\n1906\n01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:27,070\nThen we're sending the oh,\nnow I want to send my data packet packet.\n\n1907\n01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:30,600\nAnd so if you've ever wondered why when\nyou connect to a wireless network,\n\n1908\n01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:37,410\nit may be rated at 54 megabits or\nsix megabits or whatever it is.\n\n1909\n01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:39,800\nIf you ever look at your\nconnection indicator and\n\n1910\n01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,270\nyour bandwidth indicator, you ever wonder\nwhy you're getting approximately half of\n\n1911\n01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:45,200\nthe overall bandwidth\nyou're actually rated for.\n\n1912\n01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,860\nIt's because of the collision avoidance.\n\n1913\n01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:49,840\nThe overhead of doing\nthe avoidance is actually sucking\n\n1914\n01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,400\napproximately 50% of\nthe bandwidth out of the system.\n\n1915\n01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,935\n>> It's not your device ripping you off.\n\n1916\n01:24:53,935 --> 01:24:55,900\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well it could be the device then is not\n\n1917\n01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:56,810\ngiving you true value.\n\n1918\n01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:58,340\nThat's a whole separate conversation.\n\n1919\n01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,190\nThere is always that possibility.\n\n1920\n01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:04,430\nBut one of the key reasons, aside from\njust simple pure greed and malfeasance\n\n1921\n01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:09,100\nis the fact that It actually is going into\nthe architecture of the avoidance solution\n\n1922\n01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:12,010\nthat's being used, to prevent collisions\ntaking place in the first place.\n\n1923\n01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:15,260\nThat's where half our bandwidth disappears\nto on average in wireless systems.\n\n1924\n01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:15,870\nSo now you know.\n\n1925\n01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:18,730\nAll right, so, what's the message here,\n\n1926\n01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:20,810\ncoming out of this whole thought process,\nright?\n\n1927\n01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:22,190\nGo wire all right?\n\n1928\n01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,100\nKeep your bandwidth.\n\n1929\n01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,040\nAll right, so\nnow that we have a better understanding,\n\n1930\n01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,940\nhopefully, of what we're talking about\nhere in terms of media access methods,\n\n1931\n01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:31,900\nwe quickly mentioned and you added, so\nthank you for putting them on there.\n\n1932\n01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,770\nWe mentioned token passing and polling.\n\n1933\n01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:36,550\nThat's two additional media access\nmethods, again we just want to make sure\n\n1934\n01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:39,520\nyou associate the concept there\nwith media access methods.\n\n1935\n01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,780\nWe quickly talked about\nwhat each of those were.\n\n1936\n01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:44,460\nLet's show these nice people\nthat are out there in our\n\n1937\n01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,920\nstudio audience what\na OSI model looks like.\n\n1938\n01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,620\nAnd we have the OSI model there.\n\n1939\n01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,390\nThere are many ways to\nrepresent the OSI model.\n\n1940\n01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:55,490\nYou may have seen a diagram\nthat looks something like this.\n\n1941\n01:25:55,490 --> 01:26:00,710\nThis is a simple representation,\nvery easily laid out table.\n\n1942\n01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:03,690\nBut what you want to understand\nabout about the OSI model.\n\n1943\n01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:05,970\nAnd this is what I often find\nwhen I talk to people about this.\n\n1944\n01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:10,940\nA lot of people that have been doing IP\nsecurity and or just information security\n\n1945\n01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:15,100\nor just generically IT for a long time,\nthey have a working knowledge.\n\n1946\n01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,237\nFamiliarity with the OSI model.\n\n1947\n01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:19,721\nThey may not remember all the layers, but\nthey have a sense that it exists, they\n\n1948\n01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:23,049\nknow roughly more or less what it does,\nif you push them to the wall they may or\n\n1949\n01:26:23,049 --> 01:26:26,689\nmay not be able to tell you what the seven\nlayers are, but for making sure that we're\n\n1950\n01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:30,024\nbuilding foundational knowledge or\ngetting ready to answer questions to.\n\n1951\n01:26:30,024 --> 01:26:33,807\nThe common SSCP want to make sure\nwe understand the OSI model,\n\n1952\n01:26:33,807 --> 01:26:38,171\nwhether you know it top to bottom,\nmeaning level seven to layer one, or\n\n1953\n01:26:38,171 --> 01:26:42,640\nbottom to top, level one to level seven,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n1954\n01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:46,090\nThere are pneumonics, memory devices\nout there that help you to remember.\n\n1955\n01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:48,950\n>> Yeah\n>> Get one figure one out,\n\n1956\n01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:50,330\nit doesn't matter how you do it.\n\n1957\n01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,140\nMake some flash cards.\n\n1958\n01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,412\nRemember what it is we're\nputting the graphic up.\n\n1959\n01:26:54,412 --> 01:26:56,150\nWe're gonna speak about it for\nthe next few minutes.\n\n1960\n01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:59,920\nYou've got plenty of time to look at it\non the screen and get a good sense of it.\n\n1961\n01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,820\nBut at the end of the day, you gotta\nknow the layers of the OSI model and\n\n1962\n01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,427\nyou gotta know them in order, right?\n\n1963\n01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:05,187\nYou gotta know the order.\n\n1964\n01:27:05,187 --> 01:27:08,007\nIt's not enough to say there are seven\nlayers, and I think layer four is this,\n\n1965\n01:27:08,007 --> 01:27:09,345\nand layer two might be that.\n\n1966\n01:27:09,345 --> 01:27:11,835\nYou gotta know them in sequence\nbecause they build on one another.\n\n1967\n01:27:11,835 --> 01:27:15,415\nWhether we go top to bottom,\nhow we're deconstructing.\n\n1968\n01:27:15,415 --> 01:27:19,672\nOr we're going bottom to top, and we're\nconstructing, right, a packet as we go.\n\n1969\n01:27:19,672 --> 01:27:23,382\nTo build it or deconstruct it,\nto look at it and send it out on the wire,\n\n1970\n01:27:23,382 --> 01:27:26,972\nultimately we got to know how this works,\nand this is a bidirectional model.\n\n1971\n01:27:26,972 --> 01:27:29,622\nRight, it can be run in either\ndirection by either party\n\n1972\n01:27:29,622 --> 01:27:32,560\ndepending on whether they're accepting or\nsending, right?\n\n1973\n01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,390\nData packets in and out and\n\n1974\n01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:37,092\nas a result we got to know\nthe model backwards and forwards.\n\n1975\n01:27:37,092 --> 01:27:41,210\nWe're gonna spend a few minutes with you\nhere help walk through it at a high level.\n\n1976\n01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:44,400\nWe'll come back to this in some future\nepisodes do a little more work with it\n\n1977\n01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,210\nadd some additional depth and\ncomplexity here but for\n\n1978\n01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:48,480\nthe moment let's start at the bottom.\n\n1979\n01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,676\nLet's start with layer one let's\nkind of talk about physical layer.\n\n1980\n01:27:50,676 --> 01:27:53,750\nWe've already spoken about physical\ndata link and network a little bit and\n\n1981\n01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:56,528\nwe hinted at transport didn't really\nget too far into it there But,\n\n1982\n01:27:56,528 --> 01:27:59,083\nlet's go through and\nlet's talk about what each layer does.\n\n1983\n01:27:59,083 --> 01:28:01,660\nSo, at layer one,\nthey're at the physical layer.\n\n1984\n01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:03,730\nWhat we have, and by the way,\n\n1985\n01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:06,290\nwe put a description column right\nthere in the middle for you.\n\n1986\n01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:09,900\nThat way you've got a general summary,\na sentence or so, of what it does,\n\n1987\n01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,510\nprobably a good way of thinking about it.\n\n1988\n01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:13,860\nWe have some protocols off to the right,\nor\n\n1989\n01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:18,120\nat least connectivity items that occur or\nthings that are occurring at this level,\n\n1990\n01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,680\nso those are gonna be of\ninterest to us as well.\n\n1991\n01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:25,500\nThe physical layer is where we convert\ndata into a associated appropriate format\n\n1992\n01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,710\nfor the media that we're connecting to.\n\n1993\n01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:31,220\nYou can see off to the right we\nhave things like hubs Fiber optic,\n\n1994\n01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:35,500\neither copper wire, electrical RF,\nwhatever it is, the idea is that this is\n\n1995\n01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:38,770\nliterally where we make the connection\neither on the back of the machine or\n\n1996\n01:28:38,770 --> 01:28:43,530\nin through the device, and this is where\nwe send and receive actually from.\n\n1997\n01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:47,920\nAnd what I often talk,\nto soon as we talk about the IOS model\n\n1998\n01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,360\nis it's a logical representation\nof a process that occurs.\n\n1999\n01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:51,980\n>> Right.\n\n2000\n01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:55,770\n>> And it's very difficult to translate\nthis into a physical specimen in the sense\n\n2001\n01:28:55,770 --> 01:29:00,000\ncan I go to a machine look at it and say\ncan I touch layer three of the OSI model?\n\n2002\n01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,610\nWell yeah you could go find a router in\ntheory and look at layer three devices.\n\n2003\n01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:06,810\nBut it's not really layer three.\n\n2004\n01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:11,020\nOne of the only places you can actually\nsee the OSI model manifesting itself\n\n2005\n01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,120\nis at layer one, right?\n\n2006\n01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,380\nBecause we can look at the physical\nconnectivity of a device and say,\n\n2007\n01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:17,410\nwell that's layer one,\nI know what I'm starting at.\n\n2008\n01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:19,610\nWe can look at layer seven up at the top.\n\n2009\n01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:20,850\nWhen we look at our screen, right,\n\n2010\n01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:23,780\nwe're actually looking at layer seven\nright now through our user application,\n\n2011\n01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:27,140\nseveral of them actually,\nto send this information out to you.\n\n2012\n01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:30,900\nYou guys are consuming information through\nlayer seven of the model right now.\n\n2013\n01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,610\nBut, everything in between the sandwich,\nright,\n\n2014\n01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:34,320\nbetween the two pieces of the bread?\n\n2015\n01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,500\nA little bit fuzzy,\nhard to point to a certain area.\n\n2016\n01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,880\nWe can point to the box and\nsay on the computer, that's the OSI model.\n\n2017\n01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,049\nBut, it's very hard to\npoint to a specific area.\n\n2018\n01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:42,940\nYeah.\n>> Right?\n\n2019\n01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,690\nSo, layer one is the physical layer.\n\n2020\n01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:47,200\nOur layer two data link layer,\nwe're moving up the model.\n\n2021\n01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,670\nData link layer actually\nhas two sublayers in it,\n\n2022\n01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:51,500\nwe didn't document those\n>> Right.\n\n2023\n01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:56,340\nThe model here parse, but we have\nthe MAC sub layer as a media access\n\n2024\n01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:01,430\ncontrol as in MAC address, and\nwe have the LLC or the MAC is in the, well\n\n2025\n01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:04,560\nwe won't get into that whole reference\n[LAUGH] that old-school reference.\n\n2026\n01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,810\nBut you got the mac and\ncheese going on there as we say.\n\n2027\n01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:10,290\nSo you have data link,\nyou have the mac address, layer.\n\n2028\n01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:13,000\nWe also have the LLC,\nLogical Link Control sub layer,\n\n2029\n01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,240\nalso referred to as sub layers,\ninside the data link layers.\n\n2030\n01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:19,690\nWe almost see a branch where we see the\nlayer come out and we see, you know like,\n\n2031\n01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:23,110\ntwo lines coming off and a little box on\neach side representing the sub layers.\n\n2032\n01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:23,730\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n2033\n01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:26,210\nthe idea's to know that the MAC\naddressing is managed here.\n\n2034\n01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:29,660\nWe mentioned this a few minutes ago,\nin relation to our CSMA,\n\n2035\n01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:33,090\ncollisions detection conversation\nabout looking at the MAC addresses.\n\n2036\n01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:35,710\nThat's where we interdict and\nstart inspecting data.\n\n2037\n01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:36,680\nSo that's what happens here.\n\n2038\n01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:40,230\nWe apply physical addressing to the data,\ncreating a switchable frame,\n\n2039\n01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:42,520\nas we talked about in\nour description there.\n\n2040\n01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,390\nOn layer three, our network layer,\n\n2041\n01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:48,400\nas we move up the model\nnetwork layer is gonna apply.\n\n2042\n01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,940\nIP as in TCPIP.\n\n2043\n01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:55,080\nTCPIP are two distinct protocols,\nwe often think of them as being one.\n\n2044\n01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,320\n>> That's one.\nThere's really a sweep.\n\n2045\n01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,540\n>> They are sweep across\nprotocol tools and utilities.\n\n2046\n01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:01,730\nActually, 19 of them all put\ntogether in various forms.\n\n2047\n01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:03,840\nIn one mechanism or method or another.\n\n2048\n01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,280\nYou can tell how much geek trivia\nI played late at night, right.\n\n2049\n01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:09,360\nI got all these useless facts\nI can go down like six or\n\n2050\n01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,440\nseven layers of the geek trivia well and\nstill come up with water.\n\n2051\n01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:15,760\nSo, right, so I've got a lot of time on\nmy hands, basically, is what happens.\n\n2052\n01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,645\nThis is what happens when you teach,\nby the way, right?\n\n2053\n01:31:17,645 --> 01:31:20,988\n[CROSSTALK] You come up with just\nincredible amounts of useless knowledge\n\n2054\n01:31:20,988 --> 01:31:24,013\nthat really are not very good for\nanything, more often than not.\n\n2055\n01:31:24,013 --> 01:31:27,867\n[LAUGH] We have a whole bunch of items\nthat make up the TCPIP protocol suite and\n\n2056\n01:31:27,867 --> 01:31:30,009\nI'm actually glad you brought that up and\n\n2057\n01:31:30,009 --> 01:31:33,067\nyou reminded me to refer to it\nthis way because sometimes and\n\n2058\n01:31:33,067 --> 01:31:37,470\nwe're often been very guilty of this,\nI am, and I know a lot of people that are.\n\n2059\n01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:40,160\nWe just smack it together and\nsay, yeah, it's a TCPIP.\n\n2060\n01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,700\nWe don't take the time to distinguish that\nbecause we're not focused on the layer and\n\n2061\n01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,490\nthe effect that that\nlayer has on the data.\n\n2062\n01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:50,420\nBut when we talk about TCPIP,\nwe're talking about layer four and\n\n2063\n01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:53,460\nlayer three of the OSI model as\nopposed to just layer three.\n\n2064\n01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:55,870\nSo we're talking about IPv4 and IPV6.\n\n2065\n01:31:55,870 --> 01:31:57,460\nWe call both out here for you.\n\n2066\n01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:59,400\nAlso, that oldie but a goodie\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n2067\n01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,820\n>> Mr.\nIPX.\n\n2068\n01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:02,810\n>> Amen.\nCan forget about IPX XPS.\n\n2069\n01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:06,620\n>> No, we can't do that, only if we\nare not forgetting about novelle, right?\n\n2070\n01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:11,090\nWhen we ran novelle networks,\nwe can even go back further and\n\n2071\n01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:14,030\ntalk about banyan vine and street vine.\n\n2072\n01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:19,700\nBut IPS XPS was the equivalent\nof IP PCIP on the novell side.\n\n2073\n01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,670\nMany of you listening may remember that,\na lot of you may not.\n\n2074\n01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:26,680\nNovell has not really been a player in\nthis space, in this regard, for a while.\n\n2075\n01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:30,400\nThey are really now open source and\nfocused on other things, but\n\n2076\n01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:35,110\nback in the day, this was one of the key\nstandards that a lot of people used to set\n\n2077\n01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:38,760\nup networks into managed home, was to use\nthe novelle environment and use IPXSPX,\n\n2078\n01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:43,350\nwhich was basically their implementation\nof the IP protocol stack.\n\n2079\n01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:45,160\nSo, we have a layer of three for\nthe network.\n\n2080\n01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,610\nWe configure packets,\nas you can see there, for intra and\n\n2081\n01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,440\ninter sub-net communication.\n\n2082\n01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,250\nFancy way of saying we smack an IP\naddress on the header there,\n\n2083\n01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:56,440\nand we get it ready to either\nbe processed up the stack, or\n\n2084\n01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,180\ngo out the stack on the bottom and\nget packaged up and sent on our way.\n\n2085\n01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:02,070\nOn layer four,\nwe have the transport layer.\n\n2086\n01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:08,445\nWe add TC we add SPX to IPX we\nadd UDP connection oriented and\n\n2087\n01:33:08,445 --> 01:33:10,835\nor connection less protocols.\n\n2088\n01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,515\nSo streaming media for instance,\n\n2089\n01:33:12,515 --> 01:33:14,695\nthings of that nature we were\ntalking about go in there.\n\n2090\n01:33:14,695 --> 01:33:17,672\nWe segment our traffic for\nreliable best effort delivery.\n\n2091\n01:33:17,672 --> 01:33:21,552\nIf we're using TCP, we are doing\na four-way handshake, or excuse me,\n\n2092\n01:33:21,552 --> 01:33:22,962\na three-way handshake.\n\n2093\n01:33:22,962 --> 01:33:26,962\nWe're doing a the SYN, the SYN ACK,ACK,\nwe're doing the acknowledgment there.\n\n2094\n01:33:26,962 --> 01:33:28,962\nWe're doing UDP,\nwe're not doing any of that.\n\n2095\n01:33:28,962 --> 01:33:33,232\nWe're just sending data in a streaming\neffect and hoping you pick it up.\n\n2096\n01:33:33,232 --> 01:33:37,292\nAs a result we may or may not have\nauthoritative logging on the far end\n\n2097\n01:33:37,292 --> 01:33:40,170\nthat shows that we definitely got the\npacket, and if we didn't, we re-sent it.\n\n2098\n01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:42,470\nBut that's what's happening\nof transport layer.\n\n2099\n01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:47,390\nAt the session layer, layer five,\nit establishes a logical connection, as it\n\n2100\n01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:50,410\nsays there between software endpoints, and\nI want to focus on the word logical for\n\n2101\n01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:54,270\na minute because what we often see in\na lot of documentation out there and\n\n2102\n01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:56,340\nthat's what kills me about the OSI model.\n\n2103\n01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:00,830\nYou read a lot of these networking\nbooks a lot of the documentation\n\n2104\n01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:04,400\nfrom various vendors, we won't\nmentioned names that who they may be,\n\n2105\n01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,880\njust because they create\nthe core foundational routing and\n\n2106\n01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,320\nswitching gear for\nthe Internet doesn't mean anything.\n\n2107\n01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,670\nIt could be anybody, right?\n\n2108\n01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:15,200\nBut you read a lot of this documentation\nand they often represent the session\n\n2109\n01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:19,070\nlayer, has been what we described here,\nbut they leave out the word logical.\n\n2110\n01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:20,320\nAnd so as a result.\n\n2111\n01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,040\nThey say it establishes connections\nbetween software inputs.\n\n2112\n01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,150\nI see this time and again.\n\n2113\n01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:25,920\n>> Right.\n>> When I read documentation from\n\n2114\n01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:31,910\nMicrosoft, from Cisco, from IBM,\nfrom it, from any of these vendors.\n\n2115\n01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:33,960\nIt's not that they're\ngiving you misinformation.\n\n2116\n01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,700\nI wanna be clear and I wanna be fair.\n\n2117\n01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:38,960\nThey're accurately representing what\nhappens, but they're leaving out a very\n\n2118\n01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:44,090\nimportant, subtle context point,\nwhich is how we create the connection.\n\n2119\n01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:46,280\nIt's not a physical connection.\n\n2120\n01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,330\nIt's a logical connection,\n\n2121\n01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:52,750\nmeaning I think of this like effectively\ncreating the box and the rules\n\n2122\n01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:56,400\nspecifically of the box that we're\ngonna use to establish communication.\n\n2123\n01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,780\nWe're not reaching out\nacross the divide and\n\n2124\n01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:01,700\ncreating a physical connection\nto the other machine here.\n\n2125\n01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:04,500\nWe're talking about the rules and the\nstructure of what that communication will\n\n2126\n01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:09,420\nbe as we come down the stack and enable\nthat communication on the physical layer.\n\n2127\n01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:14,100\nIt's very important to understand\nthe differentiation of this being logical.\n\n2128\n01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:18,270\nI often see people go off on these\ntangents, where we have these discussions\n\n2129\n01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:23,520\nin class, or we have these theoretical,\ndiscussions, about who's more right.\n\n2130\n01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,560\nAnd we're talking about it\nbeing a physical connection.\n\n2131\n01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,670\nNo, it's a logical connection.\n\n2132\n01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:32,540\nThe only place we do physical is\nat layer one of the OSI model, or\n\n2133\n01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:35,760\nyou interacting with layer seven at a\nkeyboard, and that's not direct physical.\n\n2134\n01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:36,480\nThat's indirect.\n\n2135\n01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,580\nBut physical's only done at\nlayer one of the OSI model.\n\n2136\n01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:42,210\nVery important so\nmake sure to focus on that in layer five.\n\n2137\n01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:44,040\nBut you can see some\nof the protocols here.\n\n2138\n01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:49,513\nThings like ftp, ssh, http, https, ntp.\n\n2139\n01:35:49,513 --> 01:35:50,757\nRight?\nMike was kind enough and\n\n2140\n01:35:50,757 --> 01:35:54,099\nDon he was kind enough to put together\nsome of this documentation for us.\n\n2141\n01:35:54,099 --> 01:35:57,235\nPut some of the protocols in here and\nput in the port numbers for us.\n\n2142\n01:35:57,235 --> 01:35:58,489\nOn these protocols.\n\n2143\n01:35:58,489 --> 01:36:01,651\nThis is a small subset of some of\nthe one's you're gonna wanna make sure\n\n2144\n01:36:01,651 --> 01:36:04,540\nyou're looking at as you prepare\nto answer some questions.\n\n2145\n01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:07,800\nWe'll come back and have a broader list\nfor you in one of the future episodes,\n\n2146\n01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,880\naround some of the other one's\nyou want to throw out there.\n\n2147\n01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,320\nBut it's certainly\na good starting list for\n\n2148\n01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:14,150\nyou to start thinking about\nthe protocols and important numbers and\n\n2149\n01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:17,040\nwe must start seeing those\nat the session layer here.\n\n2150\n01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,640\nWe have our presentation layer\nscreaming red at layer 6\n\n2151\n01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,690\n>> It's a little bright.\n\n2152\n01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:21,830\n>> That is a bright red.\n\n2153\n01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:23,820\nBoy, wow, I need sunglasses for that one.\n\n2154\n01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,260\nI've got to almost be like\nthat to shield my eyes.\n\n2155\n01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,840\nSo we have presentation layer,\nlayer 6 here.\n\n2156\n01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:33,110\nThis is where we are translating\nbetween the software and coding, and\n\n2157\n01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:34,490\nhuman readable format.\n\n2158\n01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:37,040\nSo this is like a universal\ntranslation layer.\n\n2159\n01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:41,380\nWe're stripping away,\ntranslation is being done to strip away,\n\n2160\n01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:44,100\nall the application layer stuff\nup above as we move down.\n\n2161\n01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:47,550\nIf we're moving up the stack as\nwe are to build, we are encoding,\n\n2162\n01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:51,370\nwe're putting back that translation in, so\nthat when the application layer takes it\n\n2163\n01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:54,635\nfrom us, we then actually, we're gonna\nunderstand how to read it on the screen.\n\n2164\n01:36:54,635 --> 01:36:57,920\nCuz if you ever looked at raw data,\nmachine language data,\n\n2165\n01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,840\nwithout the translation overlay.\n\n2166\n01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,150\nIt doesn't look like much.\n\n2167\n01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:03,310\nWe're talking like looking at the Matrix.\n\n2168\n01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:06,150\n>> No doesn't look like any of that.\n\n2169\n01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:08,800\n>> Just a bunch of random garbage right?\n\n2170\n01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,870\nI'm telling you one day the machines\nare gonna take over and\n\n2171\n01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:13,530\nwe're all gonna have to learn\nhow to read machine language.\n\n2172\n01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:17,082\nAll right, so reasonable for translating\nbetween software writer, this is what we\n\n2173\n01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:21,280\ndo, so where we do the translation between\nthe software and the human encoding.\n\n2174\n01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:25,690\nFormats here, protocols here, you can see\nwe have extensions and things like dot,\n\n2175\n01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:31,330\ndoc, docx, jpg, gif, XLS, you name it,\nwhatever they may be, PDF, right?\n\n2176\n01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:33,370\nDon't want to leave out Adobe there.\n\n2177\n01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:33,910\n>> That's right.\n>> So\n\n2178\n01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:38,170\nall those things that are gonna encode and\nstructure and format data for\n\n2179\n01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:40,800\npresentation are happening at this layer.\n\n2180\n01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,490\nAnd then at the application layer,\nLayer 7,\n\n2181\n01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:46,710\nthe top of the model, software there\nrequesting and receiving communication.\n\n2182\n01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:48,930\nThis could be you sitting in\nfront of your web browser.\n\n2183\n01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:53,390\nIt's you right now if you're watching us\nlive, sitting in front of ITproTV Right,\n\n2184\n01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:55,260\nas we're streaming this out or\nwhen you do watch this,\n\n2185\n01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,910\nwhen you're watching this on a playback,\non a recording later.\n\n2186\n01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:59,628\nIt's you at that point, right?\n\n2187\n01:37:59,628 --> 01:38:03,450\nSo the idea's that we're using some sort\nof software based interface to interact\n\n2188\n01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:06,700\nwith data, request communications,\nestablish connectivity.\n\n2189\n01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,820\nThrough the model and that's what's\nhappening with the application layer so,\n\n2190\n01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:12,530\nyou know, things like web browsers,\nemail, right?\n\n2191\n01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:13,830\nWe did put ftp here but\n\n2192\n01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:15,090\nnotice not the ftp protocol\n>> Right.\n\n2193\n01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:17,110\n>> But rather the client that would call\n>> Yes.\n\n2194\n01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:17,990\n>> The ftp protocol.\n\n2195\n01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:22,070\nWe put a web browser we could've said\nhttp client cuz that's really what it is.\n\n2196\n01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:24,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's not the http protocol but\n\n2197\n01:38:24,010 --> 01:38:27,330\nrather the software that calls the\nprotocol that we're talking about at this\n\n2198\n01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:29,710\nlayer of the OSI model.\n\n2199\n01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:32,710\nAnd so this is the seven stage model.\n\n2200\n01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:36,270\nNow the OSI model has its history\nin the DOD four stage model,\n\n2201\n01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:38,630\nformer defense model from back in the day.\n\n2202\n01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:42,520\nWe can actually line them up side by side\nand see the map, we're in the middle of\n\n2203\n01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:47,060\nthis model, we kinda break out and create\nmore flexibility, more connectivity.\n\n2204\n01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:50,890\nBut we moved into the OSI model over\ntime because it really lays out for\n\n2205\n01:38:50,890 --> 01:38:53,800\nus a little more detail about\nconnectivity, and how it works.\n\n2206\n01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,470\nAnd so this is the model reference that we\nare using, and it's pretty standard today.\n\n2207\n01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,740\nI talked to you about the idea\nof coming up with a mnemonic,\n\n2208\n01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:03,950\nsome sort of memory mechanism\nthat'll help you to remember\n\n2209\n01:39:03,950 --> 01:39:06,642\nwhat the OSI model is\nin terms of the layers.\n\n2210\n01:39:06,642 --> 01:39:11,080\nYou know, there are several being a child\nand a product of the '80s, I go with,\n\n2211\n01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,540\npersonally my favorite I'm gonna go\nfrom the bottom working my way up.\n\n2212\n01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:17,980\n>> By the way, any Paula Abdul fans\nout there I apologize in advance.\n\n2213\n01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:20,840\nSo, people don't need to see Paula Abdul.\n\n2214\n01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:24,320\nRight, that is my memory mnemonic\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n2215\n01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,330\n>> From my perspective, there could be\nmany others, and indeed there are, and\n\n2216\n01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:28,320\nagain, Paula I love you.\n\n2217\n01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,670\nYou're a great human being,\nwonderful person, great performer, but\n\n2218\n01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:33,390\nyou know, just gotta go with what's there.\n\n2219\n01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:35,800\n>> Yep.\n>> So people don't need to see Paula Abdul\n\n2220\n01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,040\n>> You know there's one floating around\n\n2221\n01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,160\nout there about pizza and\n\n2222\n01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:40,180\nall sorts of different words\nI've heard of over the years.\n\n2223\n01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,510\n>> Yeah.\nSome that we can't repeat here.\n\n2224\n01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:43,550\n>> Some you can't use in\npublic in mixed company.\n\n2225\n01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:45,630\nThose are for, you know, another time.\n\n2226\n01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:47,800\nBut whatever you come up with,\nyou know, all kidding aside.\n\n2227\n01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:51,260\nWhatever it is, come up with some sort\nof way to put the model in context,\n\n2228\n01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:53,420\nI guess is what we're getting at\nwhen we talk about mnemonics here,\n\n2229\n01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:56,280\nmake sure you understand\nwhat the layers are.\n\n2230\n01:39:56,280 --> 01:40:00,800\nAssociate some sort of brief,\nlet me clear about this when I say brief,\n\n2231\n01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:01,830\nI mean really brief.\n\n2232\n01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:04,050\nDescription of what happens in each layer.\n\n2233\n01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:07,420\nHave a conceptual framework of\nhow the model operates I guess,\n\n2234\n01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:11,295\nis what we want to establish, and\nthen obviously on the far side, right?\n\n2235\n01:40:11,295 --> 01:40:13,420\n[COUGH] Looking at the functionality,\n\n2236\n01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:16,440\ntranslate that description into\nsome sort of tangible map.\n\n2237\n01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:20,080\nFunctionality around what's happening\nthere by protocol and or by function.\n\n2238\n01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,700\nWe probably should've labeled that\ncolumn protocol slash function, right?\n\n2239\n01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:27,270\nSo maybe we could do that quickly if it's\nnot gonna screw the diagram up to badly.\n\n2240\n01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:31,910\nI just label it protocol slash function\nmaybe we have to change it to FUNC or\n\n2241\n01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:33,670\nsomething like that for function.\n\n2242\n01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:34,800\nYeah right so exactly, good.\n\n2243\n01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,090\nReally cause it is about protocol and\nfunction.\n\n2244\n01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:39,590\nRight we have function as\nwell as protocol there.\n\n2245\n01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:44,316\nSo really just understanding that is\ngonna help us to put this in context and\n\n2246\n01:40:44,316 --> 01:40:46,150\nbe very good hopefully.\n\n2247\n01:40:46,150 --> 01:40:47,910\nA better understanding\nof how this model works.\n\n2248\n01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:51,440\nIn some of our future discussions,\nwe'll circle back to this,\n\n2249\n01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:54,610\ntalk a bit more about\nthe placement of the OSI model, but\n\n2250\n01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:58,050\nlet's quickly make sure that we just\nrecap in our minds as we wrap up.\n\n2251\n01:40:58,050 --> 01:41:00,540\nWhat the physical connectivity components,\n\n2252\n01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:03,500\nrather we place in all these layers\nas we talk about them in our notes.\n\n2253\n01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:07,600\nSo we talked about at the physical layer,\nthings like a network card being there,\n\n2254\n01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,930\na hub being there that is\nidentified at Layer 1.\n\n2255\n01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:13,160\nAt Layer 2,\nwe would have seen a bridge and a switch.\n\n2256\n01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,300\n>> Switch.\n>> A switch usually seen as a Layer 2,\n\n2257\n01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:17,840\nalthough it could be\na Layer 3 device as well.\n\n2258\n01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,440\nWe will see it later, three a router, so\n\n2259\n01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,730\nwe'll see a router there,\nnow what we don't have is a gateway.\n\n2260\n01:41:22,730 --> 01:41:24,130\nWe didn't want to talk\nabout gateways per se.\n\n2261\n01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:27,570\nBut gateways potentially would exist at\nall seven layers of the model because they\n\n2262\n01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:28,750\ncould operate at any layer.\n\n2263\n01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:31,150\nWe traditionally think of them\nas application level gateways.\n\n2264\n01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:33,140\nWhere we have you know, socks, proxies and\n\n2265\n01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:35,580\nthings like that,\nthat are application based.\n\n2266\n01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:39,300\nBut a gateway could actually as a device,\ntypically software based,\n\n2267\n01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,780\ncould cut across any or\nall of these layers typically.\n\n2268\n01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:44,950\nThink about like, the Novell Gateway\nsurfaces from Microsoft years\n\n2269\n01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:47,890\nago where you would have to use them\nto run to be able to do the sync and\n\n2270\n01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:49,620\nlog in and things Like that.\n\n2271\n01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:51,240\nSo that would be a gateway solution,\nright?\n\n2272\n01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,012\nSo a little term, a little blast\nfrom the past coming back there.\n\n2273\n01:41:54,012 --> 01:41:54,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n2274\n01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,250\nwe've covered the OSI model for you.\n\n2275\n01:41:56,250 --> 01:42:00,810\nWe've covered our connectivity, we've\ntalked about our collision avoidance,\n\n2276\n01:42:00,810 --> 01:42:04,290\ncollision detection, and token,\nand the pulling mechanisms.\n\n2277\n01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:06,430\nAnd we've talked about\nmedia access methods,\n\n2278\n01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:10,290\nwe talked about the ideas of all\nthe different ways we communicate.\n\n2279\n01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:15,030\nThe different solutions on the LAN with\nthe unicast, broadcast and multicast.\n\n2280\n01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:16,280\nSo we covered a lot of ground.\n\n2281\n01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,600\n>> We did, we did.\n>> We covered a lot of ground in our last\n\n2282\n01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,213\ncouple of sessions.\n\n2283\n01:42:18,213 --> 01:42:19,410\n>> And don't forget to watch that.\n\n2284\n01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:21,183\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Go watch that Good Warriors in\n\n2285\n01:42:21,183 --> 01:42:22,126\nthe Dot Net movie, right?\n\n2286\n01:42:22,126 --> 01:42:24,896\nGive you a little plug for that but\nthat’s gonna actually take,\n\n2287\n01:42:24,896 --> 01:42:28,128\nnot just take what we just did actually\nfor all the connectivity stuff, but\n\n2288\n01:42:28,128 --> 01:42:30,660\nalso helps you to understand\nsome of old side model stuff.\n\n2289\n01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:34,610\nIt is actually helpful for all this back\nground information we’ve been discussing\n\n2290\n01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:38,650\nin all three of these last\nsegments we’ve been going through.\n\n2291\n01:42:38,650 --> 01:42:41,530\n>> Very good,\nwell I think that wraps it up for now,\n\n2292\n01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:43,510\nwe're gonna call that part one.\n\n2293\n01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:45,550\nAnd thanks, guys, for joining us.\n\n2294\n01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:48,160\nAnd remember, if you guys have

Good. Very good, looking\nforward to another exciting episode.\n\n10\n00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,830\n>> So I missed out on part\none of networking, you and\n\n11\n00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,630\nMike jumped in there and\nstarted going through From my notes\n\n12\n00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,960\nit's one of the largest sections of\nthe SSCP, so it's a ton of material.\n\n13\n00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,370\nSo just because I missed the first episode\ndoesn't mean I don't get some of it, so\n\n14\n00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,780\nhere we are with part two.\n\n15\n00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,630\nI know, oh boy,\nit was a cliffhanger ending last episode.\n\n16\n00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,980\n>> It was, it was.\n\n17\n00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,590\nIs Johnny going to survive?\n\n18\n00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,970\n>> We don't know.\n\n19\n00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,250\n>> Are his subletting skills up to snuff?\n\n20\n00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,970\nWe don't

a big,\n\n24\n00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:19,970\nbig topic.\n\n25\n00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,900\nSo we're gonna be picking up where we\nleft off yesterday and diving into\n\n26\n00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,570\nwide area networks, and looking at all the\ndifferent things that are concerned there,\n\n27\n00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,750\nand this is kind of where the real\nimportant stuff is, in my opinion,\n\n28\n00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,910\nbecause the wide area networks\nare the dangerous ones, the risky ones.\n\n29\n00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,340\n>> They are.\nAll the stuff we do with you is\n\n30\n00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,350\nimportant, Don.\n\n31\n00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,055\nIt's the Don stuff that's important.\n\n32\n00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:43,860\n[COUGH] As Don was saying, welcome back\nand we're gonna continue our conversation.\n\n33\n00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,340\nSo, let's talk a little bit now, shift our\nfocus in this particular topic to wide\n\n34\n00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,520\narea networking, broaden our coverage\nout from the land and really talk about\n\n35\n00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,110\nthings that go on out beyond the border\nof our network or around our network.\n\n36\n00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,950\nAnd I think we have a diagram that we can\nquickly, just very quickly throw up just\n\n37\n00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,500\nas a starting point for\na reference here, where we talk about\n\n38\n00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,120\nthe idea of the Internet cloud being\nthe WAN, the wide area network.\n\n39\n00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,140\nWe have our DMZ, which is our logical\nbuffer between the outside world and\n\n40\n00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,260\nthe inside world there, well, defined.\n\n41\n00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,400\nAnd then we have our\nLocal Area Network down at the bottom.\n\n42\n00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,540\nSo, we're going to focus on what goes on\nin the internet space out in the cloud,\n\n43\n00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,120\nin the wind, may have some references\nto things like firewalls and\n\n44\n00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,270\na DMZ on occasion, but we're really\ngoing to focus on the network for\n\n45\n00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,030\na few minutes, and\ntalk about some of the stuff there.\n\n46\n00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,520\nSo, just a good visual for\n\n47\n00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,180\nyou guys to start thinking about\nas we start our discussions.\n\n48\n00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,180\nSo, in the the wide area network, we're\nreally talking about this ability to be\n\n49\n00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,050\nable to use protocols and\nuse architectures that will move data\n\n50\n00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,525\nout beyond our gateway,\ndevices out beyond our borders, right?\n\n51\n00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:48,368\nMove it and transit it from let's say one\nendpoint device inside our LAN through\n\n52\n00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:52,125\na DMZ out to the land side of the DMZ,\nultimately through one or\n\n53\n00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,242\nmore routers most likely.\n\n54\n00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:57,522\nOn our way out, switching,\nrouting things of that nature will occur.\n\n55\n00:02:57,522 --> 00:03:00,142\nTalked about OSI model,\nso talk about layer two,\n\n56\n00:03:00,142 --> 00:03:03,652\nlayer three functionality there,\nas we move through switches and routers.\n\n57\n00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:08,432\nAnd then ultimately after the firewalls\nand out into the urban wild, if you will,\n\n58\n00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:10,942\nright, of the internet of\nthe wide area network.\n\n59\n00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:15,212\nWe spoke in the last episode about the\nvideo, The Good Warriors of the .Net and\n\n60\n00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,840\ngave that out as a reference for you to\nmaybe take a look at, and it's gonna sense\n\n61\n00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,130\nhow traffic flows, and so the middle part\nof that video where we move traffic across\n\n62\n00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,410\nthe boundary out into the wild and out\nthrough the internet and back the other\n\n63\n00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,060\nside into another network, is really\nthe piece that we're focused on here.\n\n64\n00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,350\nSo we're going to talk about some of\nthese protocols that may exist here.\n\n65\n00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,100\nThe difference between packet switch and\ncircuit switch solutions.\n\n66\n00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,250\nAnd talk about things that are some old\nschool things, what we call POTS or\n\n67\n00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,560\nPlain Old Telephone System.\n\n68\n00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,690\nPlain old fashioned telephones,\nanalog based solutions,\n\n69\n00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,540\na publicly switched data network.\n\n70\n00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,310\nRight?\n\n71\n00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,620\nAnd then we're gonna have ISDN system,\nyou know,\n\n72\n00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,750\ncircuit switching going on in those areas.\n\n73\n00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,380\nWe'll talk about packet switching\nsolutions, X25, frame relay, ATM,\n\n74\n00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,310\nor some of the protocols and technologies\nwe often find brought to bare here.\n\n75\n00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,900\nSome of them older than others,\nobviously, right?\n\n76\n00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,120\nATM is kinda the standard that people\nare using for the most part now.\n\n77\n00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,370\nBut we still see some frame,\nalthough it's kind of on its way out.\n\n78\n00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,400\nIt's not as popular and\n[INAUDIBLE] from the X25 as the solution,\n\n79\n00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,490\nhas really been replaced, for the most\npart, by some of these technologies.\n\n80\n00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,570\nSo we'll talk quickly about\nsome of those things, and\n\n81\n00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,450\njust understand what's going on there.\n\n82\n00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,700\nAnd also in general,\njust between analog and\n\n83\n00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,580\ndigital signalling it would really have to\nprobably at the base understand this idea\n\n84\n00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,180\nof an analog signal an older\nsignal non digital being a wave.\n\n85\n00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,775\nAnd the idea of the analog signal you\nknow these old scientific movies or\n\n86\n00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:41,970\nsci-fi movies we used to see where you'd\nsee with the mad scientist with the work\n\n87\n00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,570\nbench, right?\n\n88\n00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,225\nAnd you'd see the oscilloscope.\n\n89\n00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the proper geek technical term for\n\n90\n00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,360\nthat thing.\n\n91\n00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,630\nYou would see the small green\nscreen display they would have and\n\n92\n00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,370\nthe S wave would be going\nthrough kind of like this.\n\n93\n00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,220\nThe more crazy the scientist was and the\ncloser to taking over the world he was,\n\n94\n00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,770\nthe more narrow the bandwidth was on the\nwave and it was going by really quickly.\n\n95\n00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,210\nSo this idea of this s-wave, going up and\ndown is what we're talking about,\n\n96\n00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,660\nwhen we talk about analog signaling,\nversus a digital signal which is\n\n97\n00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,760\ntraditionally gonna be diagrammed out or\nshown as a block.\n\n98\n00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,260\nRight, really kind of a series of\nrectangles that go like this and go up and\n\n99\n00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,130\ndown and probably not doing a good example\nof documenting that with my finger, but\n\n100\n00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,740\nmaybe we could quickly draw a wave,\n>> No.\n\n101\n00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,670\n>> Versus drawing a signal.\n\n102\n00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,802\nThrough the magic of modern\n>> There we go.\n\n103\n00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:27,990\n>> Modern technology,\nwe could put something together,\n\n104\n00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,510\nso Don's gonna go surfing for\nus here so watch the wave.\n\n105\n00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,023\n>> [NOISE]\n>> So\n\n106\n00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:34,921\nwe could see that's gonna be something\nlike that's my EKG coming up on the screen\n\n107\n00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:35,837\nthere, right, so\n\n108\n00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:39,700\nthat's gonna look something like what\nan analog may have looked like, right?\n\n109\n00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,510\nKind of a trough and valley, peak and\nvalley, wave kind of a solution and\n\n110\n00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,550\nwhen we do a digital solution or\n\n111\n00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,830\nlook at a digital signal we're gonna\nsee something that looks a little\n\n112\n00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,252\nbit more structured, flatter and you know\nat the end of the day, it has this up and\n\n113\n00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:58,810\ndown either square or\nrectangle kind of a look and feel to it.\n\n114\n00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,290\nSo digital on the bottom,\nanalog on the top.\n\n115\n00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,880\nSo thank you very much, Mr. Picasso, we\nappreciate you stepping in there for us.\n\n116\n00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,890\nSo this idea of analog versus\ndigital is important, because\n\n117\n00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,060\nalthough analog technology is old school\ntechnology, right, it's still wide spread,\n\n118\n00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,700\nwe still see analog technology around,\nit's not as if it's gone away totally.\n\n119\n00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,040\nBut it is certainly not going to\nbe in use anywhere near as much\n\n120\n00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,980\nas it may have been in prior days.\n\n121\n00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,510\nToday, really almost everything\nwe talk about is digital and\n\n122\n00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,900\nis going to go over a digital\nsolution of some kind.\n\n123\n00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,440\nAnd so we just want to make sure we start\nout our conversations thinking about that\n\n124\n00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,590\nand just having that in mind.\n\n125\n00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,600\nThinking about that then helps\nus to really think about\n\n126\n00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,020\nasynchronous versus\nsynchronous formatting.\n\n127\n00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,330\nOf our solution,\n\n128\n00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,840\nwhere we think about synchronic solutions\nbeing time synchronise typically.\n\n129\n00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,950\nWe've talked about these\nthings in prior conversations.\n\n130\n00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,920\nWhere, you know typically we're\ndoing a timing of some kind.\n\n131\n00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,188\nTiming mechanism that will then allow of\nto sync the send and receive all the data.\n\n132\n00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:59,010\nWhere as asyrchonous solutions is going\nto use a start and stop solution.\n\n133\n00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,930\nOr inside the data stream we're\ngonna have a start and stop bid.\n\n134\n00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,170\nAnd so, you can see up here on\nour notes we've detailed out for\n\n135\n00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,570\nyou that asynchronous solutions\nare modems typically.\n\n136\n00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,530\nIt's the most common one we often thought\nof and think of where we have a stop,\n\n137\n00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,800\na start bit, and a parity bit.\n\n138\n00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,850\nYou might remember if you ever set up\nmodems like an 8-N-1 for stop, start, and\n\n139\n00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,960\nparity, or no parity, And so the idea\nwould be a start that tells us where\n\n140\n00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,700\nthe data frame is,\nwhere we're starting the transmission.\n\n141\n00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,410\nWe do our character send, however many\nbits of data there may be in the middle,\n\n142\n00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,290\ntypically an eight bit character send\nin traditional asynchronous solutions.\n\n143\n00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,540\nA parody bit and then a stop bit for\na total of 11 bits.\n\n144\n00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,940\nIf we do a one bit start,\nyou know, eight bit send.\n\n145\n00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,630\nOne bit parity, one bit stop.\n\n146\n00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,380\nWe would typically see an 11 bit packet,\n\n147\n00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,790\nor chunk of data that\nwould get streamed out.\n\n148\n00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,267\nAnd we'd do it in 11 bit chunks, as we\nwould send or receive all that scratchy.\n\n149\n00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:52,217\nWe need a recording of the modem noise,\nright?\n\n150\n00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:53,379\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would just be so\n\n151\n00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,751\ngreat to put out there,\nif we had that traditional modem noise.\n\n152\n00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:58,272\nMike and I were talking about that\nwhen we did the last episode and\n\n153\n00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:01,446\nyou would say wow, you remember when you\nwould connect and you would have that and\n\n154\n00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:03,870\nit would go up in pitch, right,\nas you started connecting and\n\n155\n00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,840\nsending more data and how cool that was?\n\n156\n00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,240\nSo yeah, that kind of thing, right?\n\n157\n00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,430\nWe may or may not be able to\ncome up with something here.\n\n158\n00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,889\n[SOUND] There we go,\nthat's great, that's the dial up.\n\n159\n00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:13,514\nAll right, so.\n\n160\n00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:16,152\n[SOUND] That's it right there.\n\n161\n00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:19,352\n[SOUND]\n\n162\n00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:25,113\nYes.\n\n163\n00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:26,971\nGood times, good times, right?\n\n164\n00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:27,862\n[SOUND]\n>> And\n\n165\n00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:30,425\nthat's a fairly fast modem\ncuz it's taking a while.\n\n166\n00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,255\nOop, that's not good.\n\n167\n00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:31,813\n>> Oop.\n[NOISE]\n\n168\n00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:32,313\n>> Okay.\n\n169\n00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,177\nWe've probably just deafened most of our\n\n170\n00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:35,948\nlisteners.\nLike!\n\n171\n00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:36,698\nWhat's going on with that?\n\n172\n00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:37,593\nI can't hear anymore,\n\n173\n00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:38,490\nright?\nSo,\n\n174\n00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,710\nthe old dial-up world\nstill exist out there.\n\n175\n00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,110\nIt's like the underpinning\nof the modern world.\n\n176\n00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,960\nSo, the idea behind that was the modem\nsetting up, synchronizing, connecting.\n\n177\n00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,600\nAnd then making sure we were sending that\ndata out as we would start and stop right,\n\n178\n00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,490\nonce the two establish\ncommunication on either side.\n\n179\n00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,080\nWhere as when we had the synchronize\nsolution, we have that\n\n180\n00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,390\ndata synchronization taking place for\nclocking mechanisms we've put up there.\n\n181\n00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,900\nWe have error checking taking place along\nthe way with that obviously, right?\n\n182\n00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,350\nBut your gonna make sure we don't send or\nreceive data that's not accounted for\n\n183\n00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,410\non either side.\n\n184\n00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,600\nDropping packets means we have\nto resend in the case of TCP.\n\n185\n00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,770\nIn the case of UDP,\nit means you simply skip a frame, right.\n\n186\n00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,450\nWe kind of make it up as we go.\n\n187\n00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,950\nSo, just making sure we understand\nthe difference there, and\n\n188\n00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,490\nwe're comfortable with that,\nwill be important.\n\n189\n00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,420\nYou have circuit switch,\nversus packet switch.\n\n190\n00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,260\nI mentioned this, we threw some of\nthe Solutions that may be found in each of\n\n191\n00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,000\nthese areas up on the list for you.\n\n192\n00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,590\nSo we have the T1, the ISDN, the POTS,\nwhich is an acronym which just stood for\n\n193\n00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,770\nplain old-fashioned telephone system,\nright?\n\n194\n00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,400\nSo that was just our analog phone system,\ntypically,\n\n195\n00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,940\nthat we were connecting\nto more often than not.\n\n196\n00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,710\nBut that was gonna be what the POTS\nsolution was there for circuit switch.\n\n197\n00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:54,500\nThe T carrier class, T1, T3, an E1,\nE3 in Europe, the equivalent there.\n\n198\n00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,730\nISBN old school kind of, fast,\n\n199\n00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,810\n\"connection technology\" compared to\na modem but certainly out of favor today.\n\n200\n00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,470\nWe don't really see ISBN circuits anymore.\n\n201\n00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,630\nWent the way of the dinosaur in relation\nwith T connection and now business class\n\n202\n00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,880\ncable modems or business class DSL, things\nlike that, are really taking its place.\n\n203\n00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,010\nWe're not even seeing T1's just because\nthey are by design and by nature,\n\n204\n00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,320\nalthough they're good for enterprise\nsolutions, a little more expensive, right?\n\n205\n00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,180\nCarriers who come in on the cable side\nreally under cut the telcos traditionally.\n\n206\n00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,000\nAnd they can offer a lot more\nbandwidth a lot quicker typically.\n\n207\n00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,850\nConnection speeds higher\nthan the T class were, and\n\n208\n00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,810\nthey could do it cheaper typically.\n\n209\n00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,576\nPay $100 to $150 a month,\nsomething like that, and\n\n210\n00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:41,180\nyou're getting 40,\n50 megs of burstable bandwidth typically.\n\n211\n00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,910\nToday where you might still pay upwards\nof several hundred to maybe $1,000 for\n\n212\n00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,890\na T class carrier brought in or bundled\nmaybe if you put several together and\n\n213\n00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,190\nhave a bonded T.\n\n214\n00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,130\nRemember bonded Ts?\n\n215\n00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,600\n>> And you get a whopping 1.5 megabit or\n1.544 megabit on a T1,\n\n216\n00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,330\nso the bonded T's, if you wanted\na higher bandwidth you had to do that.\n\n217\n00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,410\nIt got really expensive really fast.\n\n218\n00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,920\n>> And you have an upper limit there\nbecause they can only bond up to six\n\n219\n00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,470\nTs into a bonded T because of\nthe connectivity solution.\n\n220\n00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,940\nWe're literally just trunking\nthem together through\n\n221\n00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,640\nsome sort of a device that would\ntypically aggregate them for you.\n\n222\n00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,720\nYou hit an upper limit of around ten.\n\n223\n00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,640\nMaybe ten to 12 megs on the bonded T.\n\n224\n00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,940\nAnd you are paying per T to basically\nbind them in an extra fee on top to do\n\n225\n00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,410\nthe bonding so that the carrier\ncould link all the signals for you.\n\n226\n00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,400\nSo it was very cost ineffective.\n\n227\n00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,190\n>> Right.\nAnd the next step up was a T3 at 45\n\n228\n00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,080\nmegabit and, I mean, ridiculous cost.\n\n229\n00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,780\n>> And then OCS on top of that, right?\n\n230\n00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,180\nYou go with OCS and.\n\n231\n00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,810\nGet into the gigabit range\nthat you were talking about.\n\n232\n00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,790\nHundreds of thousands of dollars to lay\nin dedicated circuits at that point.\n\n233\n00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,510\nSo, yeah.\n\n234\n00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,370\nClearly not gonna be very viable for\nmost of us.\n\n235\n00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,320\nAlthough if you're that evil\ngenius that has that secret lair\n\n236\n00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,830\non a desert island somewhere.\n\n237\n00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,099\nYou may have tapped into\nthat under sea cable and\n\n238\n00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:54,149\nbeen pulling that bandwidth directly in.\n\n239\n00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,373\nSo, you may be that guy, but\n\n240\n00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:58,880\nif you're not that guy then this might\nof been the way they work for you.\n\n241\n00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,090\nWe don't see much of those circuits with\nsolutions anymore on the traditional side.\n\n242\n00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,570\nRight?\nThe T one's have kind of gone the way of\n\n243\n00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,840\nthe dinosaur, but we're replacing\nthem with things like cable modem,\n\n244\n00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,340\nthe business grade DSL, things like that.\n\n245\n00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,990\nOn the packet switch side,\nolder technology,\n\n246\n00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,025\nI mention this quickly as we\nare just introing this idea.\n\n247\n00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:18,870\nX25 is the standard,\nthe oldest of the three.\n\n248\n00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,785\nHas been replaced for\nthe most part almost exclusively.\n\n249\n00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:24,250\nFrame-relay was really\ndesigned to replace that.\n\n250\n00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,070\nYou may have some legacy systems\nout there that have been set up and\n\n251\n00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,300\njust have not been, maybe on\nthe government or military side, and\n\n252\n00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,150\ndedicated secure installations kinda\nthing may not have been swapped out yet.\n\n253\n00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,235\nBut in general, frame-relay replaced\nx25 over the last number of years.\n\n254\n00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:41,100\nFrame-relay works at the link\nlayer of the OSI model.\n\n255\n00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,720\nNo authentication or\nencryption on its own.\n\n256\n00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,770\nWe overlay security on top of it, but\n\n257\n00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,770\nit was really designed just\nto replace this x25 standard.\n\n258\n00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:54,180\nWhich was kind of old, convoluted and\ncomplicated, wasn't very efficient.\n\n259\n00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,120\nAnd ATM comes in and replaces frame\nrelay in the last several years, and ATM\n\n260\n00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,655\nis really kind of become the standard for\nhigher end packet switch solution today.\n\n261\n00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:07,060\n54-byte fixed cell size\non ATM that you just,\n\n262\n00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,550\none I know of,\nkind of a knowledge point there.\n\n263\n00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,150\nMight need to be able to bring that back\nup and answer that authoritatively at some\n\n264\n00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,230\npoint if asked about what kind\nof structure do we see there.\n\n265\n00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,810\nAnd so we just want I want to make sure\nthat we understand before we move off\n\n266\n00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,380\nthis, the difference between circuit\nswitch and packet switch, overall.\n\n267\n00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,590\nWe've talked about kind of the underlying\ntechnologies as categories.\n\n268\n00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,330\nBut circuit switch solutions need\ndedicated point to point connections for\n\n269\n00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,370\nthe duration of the call.\n\n270\n00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,850\nSo if you and I were calling each other,\n\n271\n00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,340\nlet's say on an old analog phone system,\nI would have to pick up my,\n\n272\n00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,649\nat the time, state of the art,\nrotary dial handset, right?\n\n273\n00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,940\nTypically that nice green, or\nperhaps that nice black color that\n\n274\n00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,170\nthe phone company was able to put out for\nus, kinda like the Henry Ford model.\n\n275\n00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,254\nYou can have anything you want as long\nas it's a T, and it's black, right?\n\n276\n00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,465\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But a Model-T, it's black\n\n277\n00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,525\n>> Can have as many as you want.\n\n278\n00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:56,495\nSo we'd pick up that\nold rotary dial phone.\n\n279\n00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:57,675\nHave you guys seen, by the way?\n\n280\n00:13:57,675 --> 00:14:00,055\nDo we have pictures, we probably should\nput up a picture of a rotary dial phone,\n\n281\n00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:00,735\nif we're talking about.\n\n282\n00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:01,395\n>> In case they don't know.\n\n283\n00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:04,105\n>> In case you don't know, because I'm\nthinking there may be people out there\n\n284\n00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:06,305\nthat have never seen a rotary dial phone.\n\n285\n00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,215\nSo while we pull up a graphic\non the rotary dial phone,\n\n286\n00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,745\nwe need fixed endpoints, right?\n\n287\n00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:11,915\nAnd so what we would see there.\n\n288\n00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:12,830\nOh, look at that.\n\n289\n00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,000\n[COUGH] Modern classic, right?\n\n290\n00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,880\nYou what is incredibly scary and\nalso astounding to me at the same time.\n\n291\n00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,900\nI think I was in maybe New York or Boston\nin the last 12 months on a business trip.\n\n292\n00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,060\nAnd I was in a store.\n\n293\n00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,880\nI had some time to kill.\n\n294\n00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,550\nI was out doing something,\nmaybe between client meetings.\n\n295\n00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,712\nAnd I wound up in one of those we have\neverything kind of stores on the IT side.\n\n296\n00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:42,180\nAlmost like a tech geek depot and\n\n297\n00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,110\nthey actually have, they're selling\nnow as plug ins for your smart phones.\n\n298\n00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,170\nRight, have you seen these?\n\n299\n00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,550\nYou can get the-\n>> I bought one for my wife.\n\n300\n00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,050\n>> Did you?\n\n301\n00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,460\nThe big handset that you get?\n\n302\n00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,760\nSo it's like the old rotary dial\nhandsets that you can plug in.\n\n303\n00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,300\nOh my God!\nI looked at this and I thought, wow!\n\n304\n00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,230\nRight.\n\n305\n00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,080\nThere is just old is new again,\nright, it never goes away.\n\n306\n00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,650\n>> It's funny because I bought one for\nmy wife and I told her, I said,\n\n307\n00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,955\nyou've gotta use this in the car.\n\n308\n00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,320\n>> Mm-hm.\nCuz how awesome would that be to be\n\n309\n00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,565\ndriving down the road holding this\nold cell handset up to your head,\n\n310\n00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:12,030\ncuz people see you on the road and.\n\n311\n00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,950\n>> Right, well.\n\n312\n00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,020\n>> Got an old phone.\n\n313\n00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,340\n>> Right.\n>> It's entertaining.\n\n314\n00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,230\nThese rotary phones,\n\n315\n00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,430\na lot of the local telephone companies\ndon't support rotary dial anymore.\n\n316\n00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,130\nThey require tone dialing.\n\n317\n00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,120\nBut you have,\nyou originally had the computer\n\n318\n00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,370\nmodems you would take this hand set\n>> Plug it in\n\n319\n00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,406\n>> And actually strap that handset to\n\n320\n00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:32,986\nit so\n>> The Hayes modem,\n\n321\n00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:38,777\nthe suction cups from War Games, movie\nwhere that's how he starts hacking into\n\n322\n00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:44,049\nthe gaming company which is masquerading\nright as a front for the Norat,\n\n323\n00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:49,177\nCrystal Mountain so Matthew Broderick\nends up hacking into To Norad.\n\n324\n00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,825\nSo the idea here with circuit switch.\n\n325\n00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,944\nLet's get back to reality.\n\n326\n00:15:51,944 --> 00:15:54,516\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now that we've done the nostalgia bit.\n\n327\n00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:55,610\nRight?\nDo you\n\n328\n00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,070\nhave like a patina where we can do like\nthe shading and do the on the screen.\n\n329\n00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,490\nWe could do the whole thing and\nwe could do it old school.\n\n330\n00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,540\nSo you could see what\na rotary phone looked like.\n\n331\n00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,985\nThe point was whatever the end point was,\nnot so much that it had to be rotary dial.\n\n332\n00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:07,990\nRight.\nBut the right idea was\n\n333\n00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,790\ndedicated end point.\n\n334\n00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,700\nSo Don and I would need to pick up\na phone connected on either side\n\n335\n00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,878\nvia some sort of a cable.\n\n336\n00:16:14,878 --> 00:16:16,285\nRight.\n\n337\n00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:21,754\nThat is what we would be doing, right,\nthat was command central back in the day.\n\n338\n00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:22,350\nRight?\n\n339\n00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,130\nAt the blazing slow speed\nof 300 bits per second.\n\n340\n00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,280\nYou could also connect and\nsend information.\n\n341\n00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,140\nYou and I could probably talk faster than\nwe could send information across the wire.\n\n342\n00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,340\nSo we would put our phone up to\nout ear and we would dial, right?\n\n343\n00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,010\nAnd as a result,\n\n344\n00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,945\nif we were able to connect,\nwe would have a circuit switch solution.\n\n345\n00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:44,235\nWhere we had two dedicated endpoints,\nthat effectively were then for\n\n346\n00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:47,005\nthe duration of the call kept open,\nand the wire,\n\n347\n00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,055\nthe line between the two, was used\nas the transmission medium, right?\n\n348\n00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:51,445\nAnd so this is what we did.\n\n349\n00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:55,635\nSo it was dedicated, the connection was\nestablished between the two endpoints, and\n\n350\n00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:59,715\nit could either be dynamically switched,\nor it could be permanently switched.\n\n351\n00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:02,135\nRight?\nSo we would have this SVC dynamically\n\n352\n00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:07,080\nswitched virtual circuit, or a permanently\nset up virtual circuit that was dedicated.\n\n353\n00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,900\nIf you had a dedicated line you would\nbasically pick it up and it would work,\n\n354\n00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,620\nbut either way, this is how a circuit\nswitch network would effectively function.\n\n355\n00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,930\nAnd so we have these PVC or SVC,\n\n356\n00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,520\na dynamically switched virtual circuit\nwhich would effectively be set up for\n\n357\n00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,870\nthe duration of the call then torn down\nagain, and just simply remade on the fly.\n\n358\n00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,720\nPacket switched networks\non the other hand,right?\n\n359\n00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,770\nWould be these networks that transport\ndata in these little blocks, or\n\n360\n00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,820\ncells as we talked about.\n\n361\n00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,940\nSo they are switching it based on\nthe cells that go through this 54 byte\n\n362\n00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,660\ncell size.\n\n363\n00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,530\nIn other words, for ATM,\nwas the packet we talk about.\n\n364\n00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,930\nThat packet gets sent.\n\n365\n00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,770\nAnd it may not go across the same pathway,\nright?\n\n366\n00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,860\nSo in other words,\nbunch of packets may go this way, right?\n\n367\n00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,120\nBut then if we run into a roadblock out\nthere somewhere, somethings not working.\n\n368\n00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,840\nWe may then see another group\nof packets as they stream out\n\n369\n00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,430\ngoing around that block.\n\n370\n00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,200\nAnd maybe transiting through\nalternate path one or\n\n371\n00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,830\nwhatever our multi-pathing solution would\nhave been in the packet switch network,\n\n372\n00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,130\nin order to make sure they get there.\n\n373\n00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,420\nSo we're always looking to optimize\nsend based on path of least resistance\n\n374\n00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,690\nis what we think of.\n\n375\n00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,720\nSo these were traditionally\nmulti-packet or multi-path networks and\n\n376\n00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,470\nthey have more than one stream set up.\n\n377\n00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,350\nAnd be managing data across\nmultiple streams simultaneously.\n\n378\n00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:23,310\nWe also would see the idea there that\nbecause we use a best delivery method, or\n\n379\n00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,130\na best delivery path, that traditionally\njust to keep the amount I already\n\n380\n00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,190\nstressed this, data didn't necessarily\ntravel the same way all the time, right?\n\n381\n00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,210\nIt may vary, and as a result show up\nfrom different places at the end there.\n\n382\n00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,250\nSo, we did talk about X25,\ntalked about frame relay, ATM.\n\n383\n00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,070\nWe didn't put out SMDS, but\n\n384\n00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,110\njust another example of switch multi-bit\ndata or multi-mega-bit data service.\n\n385\n00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,040\nJust another example of\npacket switching networks.\n\n386\n00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,050\nSo just keep in mind that when\nwe dynamically create path,\n\n387\n00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,550\nthere is this idea of\na security implication here.\n\n388\n00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,360\nWe are talking about security\nrelated architectures here.\n\n389\n00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,130\nHaving a fixed path is\nalso a security liability\n\n390\n00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,380\nbecause people know where to\ngo to find your information.\n\n391\n00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,230\nSo in the old days you wanted to listen\nto someone's telephone conversation\n\n392\n00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,000\non a circuit switch solution, you would\ngo down to the central switching office,\n\n393\n00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,760\nthe SO.\n\n394\n00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,058\nRight?\nAnd you would then basically tap into that\n\n395\n00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:17,620\ncircuit that was dedicated to that\nconnection, and you could listen in.\n\n396\n00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,090\nRight.\nSo there was some issue there, but\n\n397\n00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,820\nwe could control that\nwith physical security.\n\n398\n00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,820\nIf you couldn't get into the SO,\nyou couldn't tap the lot.\n\n399\n00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,000\nBut in a packed switched solution,\ndynamically switching there are still\n\n400\n00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,785\nissues because if we can interject into\nthat street, man in the middle in effect.\n\n401\n00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:34,570\nRight?\nWe can still pull down that data.\n\n402\n00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,280\nWe don't go to a central office\nto tap the line because it's\n\n403\n00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,550\nexisting in effect in the cloud,\nbut the idea is still the same.\n\n404\n00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,280\nWe can interdict that signal in some\nway if we know where to look for it.\n\n405\n00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,140\nSo you'll just be thinking about that.\n\n406\n00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,090\nKeep that in mind.\n\n407\n00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,380\nKind of be aware of that in terms\nof some of the pros and cons.\n\n408\n00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,445\nBut today most things are going\nover packet switching solutions.\n\n409\n00:19:52,445 --> 00:19:53,000\nRight.\nWe're not\n\n410\n00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,900\nreally seeing a lot of that\nolder technology much anymore.\n\n411\n00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,690\nYou may think of point\nto point connections\n\n412\n00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,860\nin relation to this generically as\nbeing relatively secure and they are.\n\n413\n00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,650\nSo just think about a dedicated\nconnection between two end points.\n\n414\n00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,910\nYou're the only one who owns that circuit.\n\n415\n00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,500\nThat's really probably the most secure\nway to do it because nobody's on that\n\n416\n00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,530\nline but you.\n\n417\n00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,710\nBut not everybody uses point to point\ntechnology because it is expensive by\n\n418\n00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,160\ncomparison and you may or\n\n419\n00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,505\nmay not have the reality of being\nable to weigh in a dedicated circuit.\n\n420\n00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:23,710\nRight?\nSo some of my high end older clients that\n\n421\n00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,279\nhave been doing business a long time.\n\n422\n00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,945\nWell-established, big companies will\nuse dedicated end to end point or\n\n423\n00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:32,885\ndedicated point to point\nsolutions on their campuses.\n\n424\n00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:34,835\nRight?\nLinking multiple buildings together\n\n425\n00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:36,565\nto create secure environments.\n\n426\n00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:41,325\nBut if you're a small business, not\nmultiple locations, small geography, or\n\n427\n00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:45,245\nsmall geo footprint, you may just be\nleasing in effect from another provider.\n\n428\n00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,955\nYou're basically a multi-tenant, right?\n\n429\n00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,090\nYou're on a line with\nother people potentially.\n\n430\n00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,820\nOn a frame or\non an ATM solution with other data.\n\n431\n00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,920\nIt's all commingled, and we tag it so\nwe know who's who, but you really have no\n\n432\n00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,860\nguarantee that somebody else is not on\nthe same line as you, unfortunately.\n\n433\n00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,310\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n434\n00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,900\nAll right, so we talked a little bit\nabout some of that underlying technology.\n\n435\n00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,400\nLet's talk.\n\n436\n00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,830\nWe mentioned this idea of\nsmaller businesses, so\n\n437\n00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,020\nlet's talk a little bit about broadband,\nand just what broadband represents for us.\n\n438\n00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,870\nSo this idea of broadband.\n\n439\n00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,920\nIt's really this idea of what most\nof us may have in our homes today,\n\n440\n00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,790\ncertainly a lot of our our small\nbusinesses probably are using that.\n\n441\n00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,010\nI know that in some of the offices\nthat I do business with, or\n\n442\n00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,260\nwork with,\nbroadband is pretty much the standard.\n\n443\n00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,130\nWhere we bring in, we mentioned earlier,\nlike a cable modem, business-grade DSL,\n\n444\n00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,260\nsomething like that.\n\n445\n00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,540\nAnd so good for SOHO, right?\n\n446\n00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,610\nMeans small office, home office,\nthe acronym that we use there.\n\n447\n00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,590\nSo small-medium sized businesses.\n\n448\n00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,260\nSo things like cable companies that\nare doing service provisioning today.\n\n449\n00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,340\nWhether it is Comcast down in my area, or\n\n450\n00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,650\nit may be AT and T, Time Warner,\nwherever they are, whatever they're doing.\n\n451\n00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,590\nSo any of the big players in that industry\nare all providing broadband services.\n\n452\n00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,610\nXDSL, you know fast DSL,\nis the general category for this.\n\n453\n00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,980\nSo this is the idea that we see.\n\n454\n00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,640\nObviously much much faster.\n\n455\n00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,820\nYou can get, as I said, on the business\nside, probably 30 to 50 megs.\n\n456\n00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,530\nOn a burstable circuit today,\nfor a few hundred dollars.\n\n457\n00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,100\n>> Yeah very reasonable rate.\n\n458\n00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,950\nThe story I always tell is that I worked\nfor an insurance company where we\n\n459\n00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,240\nhad 110 branch offices, and\nwe had all fractional T1's.\n\n460\n00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,160\nAt every one of them.\n\n461\n00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,140\nOur telco bill was over\n$40,000 ever month.\n\n462\n00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,870\nThat was our bill,\nthat was just part of our organization.\n\n463\n00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,690\nAnd we converted over\nto business class DSL.\n\n464\n00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,020\nSo we rolled business class\nDSL at every branch and\n\n465\n00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,760\nobviously we had to put in firewalls.\n\n466\n00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,280\nWe put in CISCO PIXes at the time,\nbecause on a fractional\n\n467\n00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,650\nT1 it's a point to point circuit so it's a\nprivate line that runs from there to you.\n\n468\n00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,760\nBut when you switch to using the internet,\nit's the wild west.\n\n469\n00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,690\nSo we had to implement VPN tunnels, but\nour bandwidth increased drastically.\n\n470\n00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,120\nOur cost went down drastically.\n\n471\n00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,740\nOur phone dropped to below 10,000 a month,\njust to support all these various lines.\n\n472\n00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,600\nAnd it was a huge cost savings,\nwith a huge bandwidth increase.\n\n473\n00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,300\nAnd companies are seeing that and\nthey're acting on it.\n\n474\n00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,820\nSo you're seeing this more and\nmore in business environments.\n\n475\n00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,970\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n476\n00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,740\nSo, just something to think about.\n\n477\n00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,910\nSo [COUGH] if that's where you\nfind yourself today, right.\n\n478\n00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,315\nObviously give Don a call.\n\n479\n00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:10,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He'll help you figure that out.\n\n480\n00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,190\nHe's got a solution, we'll box it up and\nsend it to your,right?\n\n481\n00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,070\nAll right, just think about that and\nobviously one of the things that, actually\n\n482\n00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,670\nthis brings up a very good point, as maybe\njust a quick digression here for a second.\n\n483\n00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,800\nWe've spent a lot of time in all\nthe episodes we've been doing with you\n\n484\n00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,230\non the knowledge management\naspect of becoming an SSCP.\n\n485\n00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,656\nLearning about what the knowledge is,\ngetting ready to answer questions,\n\n486\n00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,162\nunderstanding the technology.\n\n487\n00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:35,587\nBut one of the things that a security\nprofessional brings to the table for\n\n488\n00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:38,227\nan organization,\nbeyond clearly a lot of knowledge and\n\n489\n00:23:38,227 --> 00:23:41,056\nskill, is the ability to\nrecognize opportunity, right.\n\n490\n00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:45,122\nAnd so, the story Don just shared with you\nabout this idea of Whether it was him at\n\n491\n00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:48,173\nthe helm ultimately that said,\nwe need to make this shift.\n\n492\n00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:50,590\nOr he was part of the team\nthat implemented it.\n\n493\n00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,180\nSomebody in the organization went out,\nlooked at technology, and\n\n494\n00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,190\nsaid, there's a better way.\n\n495\n00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,010\nWe can do this,\nwe could do it for cheaper.\n\n496\n00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,580\nAnd if we do it, this is the amount\nwe're gonna save or whatever it is?\n\n497\n00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,760\nWe talked in one of our earlier,\nshows about this is impact analysis and\n\n498\n00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,770\nrisk management.\n\n499\n00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,490\nRisk analysis, and this is a great way to\nbring that kind of topic back to the fore,\n\n500\n00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,010\nand quickly remind you of the fact that\nit's not always about the security,\n\n501\n00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,570\neven though you're a security\nfocused professional.\n\n502\n00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,660\nIt's also about figuring out the best\nway forward for the business.\n\n503\n00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,800\nBased on management of technology, and\n\n504\n00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,760\nthen understanding the security\nimpact that that can have.\n\n505\n00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,010\nSo Don said we set up VPN tunnels.\n\n506\n00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,360\nWe brought in firewalls, that would manage\nthat but went away from a dedicated end\n\n507\n00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,470\npoint device solution, a dedicated\ncircuit solution which was secure.\n\n508\n00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,540\nReplaced it with something that was\na little more complicated to build, but\n\n509\n00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,670\nultimately was as secure if not\nmore secure at the end of the day,\n\n510\n00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,300\nat least as secure.\n\n511\n00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,300\nAnd as a result swap that one good\nsecurity solution for another one, upgrade\n\n512\n00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,550\nthe technology in the thought process,\nsave the company money in the process.\n\n513\n00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,540\nThat's a win for everybody,\nas Don said, and\n\n514\n00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,660\nultimately that is part of\nwhat a security professional,\n\n515\n00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,830\nan IT professional's job needs to be,\nis recognizing those opportunities.\n\n516\n00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,730\nAnd making sure we know how to position\nthe business, to take advantage of that.\n\n517\n00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,060\nAnd so just think about that as\nwe're going through this stuff.\n\n518\n00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,830\nA lot of this stuff you may not\never get a chance to use directly.\n\n519\n00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,150\nToday, in your job.\n\n520\n00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,950\nBecause maybe that technology\nplatform is already fixed, but\n\n521\n00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,340\nthat doesn't mean that's\ngonna stay that way.\n\n522\n00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,260\nAs we've talked about and\nin the next 12, to 24, or 36 months\n\n523\n00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,620\nthat technology platform is gonna need\nto undergo a refresh of some kind.\n\n524\n00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,600\nSo, positioning yourself to\nunderstand the opportunity,\n\n525\n00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,460\nis part of the value you\nbring to the business.\n\n526\n00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,470\nIt's a very important thought process for\nyou, to have and for\n\n527\n00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,839\nyou to be thinking about as we go forward.\n\n528\n00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,365\nSo, let's add some other value here.\n\n529\n00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:38,559\nLet's talk about some other\ntechnologies that add value.\n\n530\n00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,204\nPPoE or PPPoE,\nwhich is Point-to-point protocol.\n\n531\n00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:43,180\nIt's really the same.\n\n532\n00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,767\nIt's just you add the P in there for\nprotocol, but\n\n533\n00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,621\nit's traditionally called PPoE.\n\n534\n00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:51,403\nSo PPP or PPPoE,\nPoint-to-Point protocol over Ethernet,\n\n535\n00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:55,194\nis really gonna be another\ntechnology that we see sometimes.\n\n536\n00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:57,313\nAs you can see there,\nwe'll just adjust in realtime.\n\n537\n00:25:57,313 --> 00:25:59,155\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thank you, Siri.\n\n538\n00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:02,860\nAnd so used to implement user\nauthentication over broadband.\n\n539\n00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,050\nSo, when we do with broadband,\nwhat we tend to see is that we then\n\n540\n00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,670\nlayer in something like PPoE to\ndo some authentication for us and\n\n541\n00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,310\nvalidate who's on the other line, or who's\non the other side I should say rather.\n\n542\n00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,990\nSo, it's often very well implemented and\ncommon to see with things like DSL.\n\n543\n00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,150\nSo, you just wanna make sure we\nunderstand that and we see that,\n\n544\n00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,618\nthat is a security add on in effect.\n\n545\n00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:24,240\nIf we wanna think of it that way, for\n\n546\n00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,920\nwhat we might be looking at\nthere with a DSL connection.\n\n547\n00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,560\nSo, [COUGH] when we talk about\nthese ideas of security issues and\n\n548\n00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,490\nreally think about access, and\ncontrolling authentication.\n\n549\n00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,280\nWe're always looking for\nways to authoritatively decide, whether or\n\n550\n00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,500\nnot to let somebody in.\n\n551\n00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,850\nThis is very important,\nespecially impactful with remote access,\n\n552\n00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,300\nas we get to this new topic area here.\n\n553\n00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,940\nSo things like, terminal services\non the Microsoft side for instance.\n\n554\n00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,040\nMaybe an RDP solution there.\n\n555\n00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,760\nCould be a thin client solution or virtual\ndesktop these days of DDI of some kind.\n\n556\n00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:00,705\nI pine for the old days of the green\nscreen, or the amber screen thin client.\n\n557\n00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:01,515\n>> Dummy terminals.\n\n558\n00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:04,095\n>> Yeah, I remember when I\nwas getting into college.\n\n559\n00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:05,405\nAt that point I was already in college.\n\n560\n00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:06,665\nI was doing research work.\n\n561\n00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:09,045\nI was getting ready to\nstart my master's thesis,\n\n562\n00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:13,637\nand we still had these mythical places\nat that point in time, called libraries.\n\n563\n00:27:13,637 --> 00:27:14,882\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n564\n00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:16,382\nOld school, mythical place.\n\n565\n00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:17,742\nIt was almost like Narnia, right?\n\n566\n00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:20,272\nYou don't know how to get there\nunless you read about it, and\n\n567\n00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,352\nyou follow an ancient treasure map.\n\n568\n00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:24,966\nBut, in back the day when we\nhad libraries as the standard,\n\n569\n00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:27,796\nwhere people would go instead of looking\nfor information on the internet.\n\n570\n00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:31,896\nYou would go to a library, and\nwe have these things called card catalogs.\n\n571\n00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:35,546\nAnd you would actually, in the old school\nworld, you would actually look up the book\n\n572\n00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:40,810\nreferences in Index card, card catalog,\nsliding drawer card catalogs.\n\n573\n00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,290\nAnd slowly, but surely that changed and\n\n574\n00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,900\nyou then brought that online as\nyou have these dumb terminals.\n\n575\n00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,570\nThese thin clients that you\nwould do these green screen or\n\n576\n00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,070\namber screen searches on, and\nyou would search the card catalog.\n\n577\n00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,600\nBut, do it on the thin clients.\n\n578\n00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,120\nSo, this is probably really old\ntechnology by today's standards,\n\n579\n00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,550\nwe don't tend to see\nthat kind of thin client.\n\n580\n00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,020\nBut we're actually making\ncomeback on the thin client side,\n\n581\n00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,660\nbecause a lot of the embedded systems that\nwe're seeing today are thin client based.\n\n582\n00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,969\nAnd or are gonna be a VDI,a virtual\ndesktop environment, where we may or\n\n583\n00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:14,099\nmay not do the heavy lifting there.\n\n584\n00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:15,185\nRight, well that's an oldie but a goody.\n\n585\n00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:16,683\nThat was a Zenith.\n\n586\n00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:19,597\nHaven't seen one of those in a while,\nright?\n\n587\n00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,962\n>> Here we go, that's a little more.\n\n588\n00:28:20,962 --> 00:28:23,283\n>> Well, look w hat they built there?\n\n589\n00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:23,922\n>> A bomb?\n\n590\n00:28:23,922 --> 00:28:25,060\nI don't know what that is.\n\n591\n00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,726\n>> I don't know why it's got\na battery attached to it, but\n\n592\n00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:28,085\nthis is a little more\nlike what I always used.\n\n593\n00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:29,589\n>> It's powering the computer, right?\n\n594\n00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:31,017\nGot the little hamster on the fly wheel,\n\n595\n00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:33,120\noff to the side of\nthe screen that nobody sees.\n\n596\n00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,080\nSo something like that whatever it was.\n\n597\n00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,820\nIt was interesting, because the keyboard\nwould be wired up and could see it there.\n\n598\n00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,400\nIt was almost like a phone cord twisted\ncable off to the left-hand side,\n\n599\n00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,640\nas it goes to the back there\non the side of the picture.\n\n600\n00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,090\nAnd you'll be plugged in and then the\nnetwork cable was basically an RJ 11 or\n\n601\n00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,340\nan RJ 45, depending on what it was but\ntypically an RJ 11,\n\n602\n00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,260\nconnection that just links you back\ninto the system to go to the main frame.\n\n603\n00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,840\nCuz that's where it was, it was sitting\non a mainframe computer somewhere.\n\n604\n00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,380\nSo, this is really the back in\nthe bygone era days and stuff.\n\n605\n00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,210\nBut, when we talk about thin clients,\n\n606\n00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,640\nwe may not be talking about\nsomething quite as old as this.\n\n607\n00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,270\nWe're talking about a modern,\nupdated version of that, but\n\n608\n00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:13,380\nit's a small footprint PC, typically\nvery small and something like this,\n\n609\n00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,970\nwhere you're gonna see it just basically\nhas the ability to download and\n\n610\n00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,510\nrun the OS or\nmay have embedded OSes in it.\n\n611\n00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,880\nEmbedded point of sales systems typically,\n\n612\n00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,950\nare gonna run a solution that\nis a thin client solution.\n\n613\n00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,500\nAnd so they will be able to boot up.\n\n614\n00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,900\nThey have some hardware\nassociated with them.\n\n615\n00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,510\nNothing too fancy,\nmaybe able to plug a monitor into it or\n\n616\n00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,040\nsomething like that through a USB port,\nbut basically you'll be able to download,\n\n617\n00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,320\nand may even use it through the cloud.\n\n618\n00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,830\nThat one is I think a cloud based\nsolution, cloud based desktops.\n\n619\n00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,450\n>> These are the ones we use there.\n\n620\n00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,420\n>> The wise ones.\n\n621\n00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,840\n>> Not like in this studio room, but\n\n622\n00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,720\noutside the studio room this is\nwhat everybody in our company has.\n\n623\n00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,200\n>> All right, so it's a small little box.\n\n624\n00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,440\nTry and use basically front load.\n\n625\n00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,520\nAnd then after you're all loaded up and\nready to go, it's a very simple and\n\n626\n00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,190\nportable footprint.\n\n627\n00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,210\nIt's actually really, really neat.\n\n628\n00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,130\nSo, these are the modern thin client ones,\nyou see they may be wireless, right?\n\n629\n00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,045\nThese happen to have wireless antennas\nsitting up, on the top of them there.\n\n630\n00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:07,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They could be wired up,\n\n631\n00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,120\nyou may have a network port\nwhere you wire it into the back,\n\n632\n00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,070\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n633\n00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,770\nSo there's different ways to set this up,\n\n634\n00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,220\nbut this is what a modern thin client as\nopposed to the old school thin client.\n\n635\n00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,190\nSo, we were just talking about,\nso just be aware of that and\n\n636\n00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,030\nthere's many vendors out\nthere that do this right?\n\n637\n00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,646\nSo obviously a lot of technology platforms\nyou can play with in this form factor,\n\n638\n00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:24,862\nall right?\n\n639\n00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:29,280\nSo let's go back and yeah,\n\n640\n00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,180\nlet's just go back and finish up this\nconversation, and wrap up this section.\n\n641\n00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,900\nSo, Terminal Services Thin Clients.\n\n642\n00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,290\nRADIUS and or TACACS or even TACACS plus,\n\n643\n00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,220\nkind of multiple generations\nof that thought process.\n\n644\n00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,780\nWe have what's known as triple AAA\nwhen we deal with these solutions.\n\n645\n00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,210\nWhich is the authorization,\nauthentication and accounting.\n\n646\n00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,460\nSo letting people in,\nknowing who they are.\n\n647\n00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,440\nGiving them the rights, and\nthen making sure we log or\n\n648\n00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,980\naccount, the counting is referred to.\n\n649\n00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,900\nIn the proper technology\naccounting is really logging.\n\n650\n00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,670\nSo, making sure we know whose coming in,\nand what we're doing?\n\n651\n00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,250\nKeeping track of their session\nis gonna happen there.\n\n652\n00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,380\nI think we had Authentication twice,\nbecause under radius you had\n\n653\n00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,140\nAuthentication there again, so\nwe had it listed twice for some reason.\n\n654\n00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,095\n>> It's double important.\n\n655\n00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:12,080\n>> It's double important, [LAUGH] right?\n\n656\n00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,700\nIt's double authentication,\nlike double-secret probation, all right?\n\n657\n00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,305\n[LAUGH] So, can you bring an Animal House\nmovie reference into your thought process\n\n658\n00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:22,180\naround network security?\n\n659\n00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,256\n>> [CROSSTALK] So, it's not done\nunless you bring John Belushi into it.\n\n660\n00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:25,510\n>> Exactly.\n\n661\n00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,950\nSo remote access solutions, right?\n\n662\n00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,100\nVery important to folks on the ideas here,\nabout bringing people in securely.\n\n663\n00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,420\nWhether they're coming in through a VPN or\na VPN-less client solution today.\n\n664\n00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,350\nNot as critical,\nused to be VPN was the standard.\n\n665\n00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,640\ntoday we can do it without a VPN overlay,\n\n666\n00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,490\nwe've talked about some\nof the technology there.\n\n667\n00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,194\nLike maybe something like RPC over HTTPS.\n\n668\n00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,006\nWhere we are bundling in RPC.\n\n669\n00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,815\nTunneling it inside of a secure protocol,\nand transiting.\n\n670\n00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:50,759\nWithout a VPN.\n\n671\n00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,383\nBut however we get there, it's always\nsecure, it's always focused on satisfying\n\n672\n00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:57,210\nthe requirements to make sure\nwe know who's on either end.\n\n673\n00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,240\nWe keep track of what's going\non during that session.\n\n674\n00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,350\nWe do so securely, typically,\nwith an encryption overlay.\n\n675\n00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,100\nSo as we wrap up our discussion at least\nin this part of our discussion here,\n\n676\n00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,600\nanyway, around some of these\nWAN level technologies.\n\n677\n00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,170\nWe'll come back and talk about protocols\nthat are implemented for security and\n\n678\n00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,230\nauthentication in our next discussion.\n\n679\n00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,170\nJust wanna make sure you guys\nare comfortable with all the technology,\n\n680\n00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,680\ncomfortable with the thought process and\nmaking sure you\n\n681\n00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,510\nare beginning to see how the\narchitecture's being built layer by layer.\n\n682\n00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,230\nAnd we'll continue some of\nthose conversations as we\n\n683\n00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,100\ncome back with future episodes.\n\n684\n00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,360\n>> All right, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, let's stop here.\n\n685\n00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,420\nWe're gonna take a break, and\n\n686\n00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,610\nwhen we get back, we'll jump into those\nsecurity protocols Adam was talking about.\n\n687\n00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,270\nWe still have a ton more to go.\n\n688\n00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,310\nIn fact so much that we'll probably end up\nhaving to do a part three for this series.\n\n689\n00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,010\n>> I would say so.\n\n690\n00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,340\n>> But yeah, so stay tuned.\n\n691\n00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:49,447\nWe'll be back in just a few.\n[MUSIC]\n\n692\n00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,515\nAlright, welcome back everybody.\n\n693\n00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:55,200\nSo we left off talking about\nsome various WAN protocols and\n\n694\n00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,270\nnow we're gonna take a look at some\nsecurity, they're protocols also,\n\n695\n00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,170\nbut security add-ons to help\nus ensure that we get the...\n\n696\n00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,480\nGet all sorts of things to get\nthe confidentiality or integrity or\n\n697\n00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,630\navailability that we need out\nof our various protocols.\n\n698\n00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,530\nSo let's take a look at a few of these and\n\n699\n00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,310\nI think we're going to start\nwith authentication protocols.\n\n700\n00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,930\nWe're going to talk a bit about remote\naccess authentication kind of keeping our\n\n701\n00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,160\ntheme that we had from\nthe last discussion.\n\n702\n00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,350\nAround remote access technology, so let's\ndelve in and lay on the next layer here,\n\n703\n00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,530\nwhich is the protocols that\nare gonna be used around them.\n\n704\n00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,480\nSo broad levels,\nbefore we jump into protocols.\n\n705\n00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,050\nWhat is remote access authentication?\n\n706\n00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,180\nJust high levels of thought process,\nright.\n\n707\n00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,960\nThis idea of having an N user somewhere,\nremote user, wherever they are.\n\n708\n00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,500\nThey need to come in and\nauthenticate across the wire, so\n\n709\n00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,480\nthey are gonna come in from outside,\nright?\n\n710\n00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,380\nCan we throw that diagram back up for\na second and\n\n711\n00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,280\nmaybe we can make a little stick\nfigure on there or something.\n\n712\n00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,840\nThey are going to be sitting out\nthere on the internet and we’re gonna\n\n713\n00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,800\nhave a user at a workstation somewhere,\ndoesn't really matter where, right.\n\n714\n00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,150\nIf it was me, I'd be at Starbucks,\n\n715\n00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:00,250\nbut that's just me, and I would then be\ntrying to authenticate in through the DMZ,\n\n716\n00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,870\nthrough the firewalls down\ninto that domain controller.\n\n717\n00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,260\nAnd in order to get there I would have to\ncome through something that's known as\n\n718\n00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,180\na network access server, it's you know,\nsome way, some shape, some form.\n\n719\n00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,660\nWe call it VPN servers when we do VPNs.\n\n720\n00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,780\nWe may call it a border gateway device.\n\n721\n00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,090\nLot's of different technology names for\nthis, but at the end of the day it's\n\n722\n00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,975\na device that is gonna stop us and\ninterdict and basically say, who are you?\n\n723\n00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:24,895\nRight, tell me who you are.\n\n724\n00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,815\nProve to me that you belong here.\n\n725\n00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,665\nCheck us against an axis control list.\n\n726\n00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:30,935\nGive us some sort of yes or no, go or\n\n727\n00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,415\ndon't go based on whether\nwe belong there or not.\n\n728\n00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:36,465\nWe have to be on the authorized\nlist to get in, in other words.\n\n729\n00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:41,070\nAnd then If we're able to do\nthat we're able to look at that.\n\n730\n00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,220\nAnd that was freehand and\nyou did a back swirl on that.\n\n731\n00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,180\nThat looks awesome.\n\n732\n00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,835\n>> It's a tube.\n\n733\n00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,310\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's a tube.\n\n734\n00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,290\nRight.\nExactly.\n\n735\n00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:48,990\nThat was great.\n\n736\n00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,730\nAnd you did it around the connection.\n\n737\n00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,460\nEven better.\n\n738\n00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,330\nGuys I'll tell you, the Winter Olympics,\nnothing on this guy, okay.\n\n739\n00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,070\nThis is the true half pipe right here.\n\n740\n00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,750\nSo when we take a look at this and\n\n741\n00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,420\nwe talk about how this all comes together,\nwe really have to think about what\n\n742\n00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,290\nis the mechanism that's gonna be\nused to actually ask us who we are.\n\n743\n00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,200\nAnd then what is the protocol that's\nbeing used to carry that traffic back and\n\n744\n00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,820\nforth, to validate that we\nare who we say we are, but\n\n745\n00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,480\nalso that encrypt and\ncreate the tunnel, however we do it,\n\n746\n00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,870\nthat's gonna to authenticate us,\nand secure us at the same time.\n\n747\n00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,990\nSo we're gonna use the untrusted network,\nright, things that are gonna come in,\n\n748\n00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,500\nthat are gonna obscure our username and\npassword and data, so things like PAP,\n\n749\n00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,810\nCHAP, EAP, so\neither password authentication protocol,\n\n750\n00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,600\nchallenge handshake\nauthentication protocol.\n\n751\n00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,830\nWhich will be the CHAP.\n\n752\n00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,090\n[COUGH] There is a Microsoft\ncentric version of CHAP.\n\n753\n00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,160\nOften people think my Microsoft thought\nup chap because you only hear about\n\n754\n00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,310\nMS chap or MS chap V two.\n\n755\n00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,520\nBut the reality is Microsoft\ntook the standard of chap and\n\n756\n00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,030\nmodified it to implement in their world.\n\n757\n00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,160\nAnd so just simply created their\nown branded version of chap, but.\n\n758\n00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,420\nShop is a generic protocol\nthat is used all of the time.\n\n759\n00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,560\nIt's used in VMWare.\n\n760\n00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,340\nFor instance, to be able to set up and\n\n761\n00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,810\nauthenticate security on\na storage connection.\n\n762\n00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,178\nThere's lots of different\nreasons why we may use CHAP.\n\n763\n00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:14,980\nSo MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2 would be there as\nwell, Microsoft centric versions of them.\n\n764\n00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:20,360\nAnd then EAP, Extensible Authentication\nProtocol, which is used with TLS,\n\n765\n00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,430\ntransport layer security,\nwith an IPsec solution typically.\n\n766\n00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,430\nSo we can see that being implementing\nwith IPsec as part of the encryption\n\n767\n00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,970\nsolution or the authentication solution or\nboth, depending on how we do we it, to be\n\n768\n00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,470\nable to implement security in an IPsec\nsolution is contrary to popular belief.\n\n769\n00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,640\nIBsect by itself although we created\ntunnel doesn't do any encapsulation\n\n770\n00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,130\nin terms of encryption of the data or\nauthentication of the data.\n\n771\n00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,900\nNatively we have to add on as we'll come\nmuch later when we come to understand much\n\n772\n00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,690\nlater when we talk about IP sect.\n\n773\n00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,390\nWe have to add on the encapsulating\nsecurity payload protocols,\n\n774\n00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,500\nwhatever they are, right.\n\n775\n00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,410\nSo we'll add on\nthe authentication headers, VAH.\n\n776\n00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:03,500\nAnd we'll add on the encryption bolt-ons,\nif you will.\n\n777\n00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,160\nAlmost like extensible modules that\nadd that layer of security into\n\n778\n00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160\nthe protocol for us.\n\n779\n00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,880\nSo, we have these protocols being used.\n\n780\n00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,080\nInside as we come across the network's\naccess point we will have\n\n781\n00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,100\ntechnologies like we\nmentioned the TACAX plus and\n\n782\n00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,750\nradius solutions that will\neffectively stop us at the border.\n\n783\n00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,380\nSay okay, Don, hold on a second.\n\n784\n00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,750\nLet me take your credentials,\ntake your information,\n\n785\n00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,380\npass them back to the domain controller,\ncheck on you to make sure you belong here,\n\n786\n00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,600\nand then in effect let\nyou in after we do that.\n\n787\n00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,460\nSo, we may wanna change that\nweb server and simply just name\n\n788\n00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,130\nit your radius server, because that\nweb server could do a dual role.\n\n789\n00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,190\nIt could be a web server, but it could\nbe radius and or it could be tack axe.\n\n790\n00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,670\nDoesn't really matter what it is.\n\n791\n00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,830\nSo if that's a radius server in our world,\njust for\n\n792\n00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,610\npurposes of our discussion, inbound\ntraffic coming from the internet through\n\n793\n00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,660\nthe first firewall hits the radius or\n\n794\n00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,372\ngateway device in the DMZ because that's\nwhere we would traditionally see this.\n\n795\n00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:03,440\nWe wanna stop you before you\nget into the internal network.\n\n796\n00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,740\nThe radius device proxies\nthe authentication request for\n\n797\n00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,850\naccess on behalf of the client, puts the\nclient on hold, keeps the session alive.\n\n798\n00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:16,100\nSets up a separate session, goes in\nthrough the internal firewall in the DMZ\n\n799\n00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,540\nand opens up, different color, opens up\na connection to the domain controller,\n\n800\n00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:25,290\nauthenticates and validates the user,\nauthorizes the user after authentication.\n\n801\n00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,890\nVery important to remember, we will\nauthenticate first and we only authorize,\n\n802\n00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,050\nonly grant access, after we authenticate.\n\n803\n00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,700\nIf we don't authenticate\nwe cannot authorize, right.\n\n804\n00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,470\nSo we authorize the user coming back\nthrough the DMZ on the far side, right,\n\n805\n00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,520\nback over.\n\n806\n00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,160\nTo the client once the RADIUS server's\nsatisfied that the conversation with\n\n807\n00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,640\nthe domain controller or the directory\nservice, whatever the LDAP provider is,\n\n808\n00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,620\nis yes, right.\n\n809\n00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,315\nBlue guy belongs here, right.\n\n810\n00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:56,810\n[LAUGH] And then we let blue guy in and\nso then we see a connection\n\n811\n00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,220\nthat comes all the way through at\nthe point and establish a session.\n\n812\n00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:04,220\nAnd that allows blue guy to access\nwhatever he needs or she needs.\n\n813\n00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,770\nBlue person, make it more generic.\n\n814\n00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,290\n>> There we go.\n\n815\n00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,550\n>> So blue person gets to access\ninformation at that point.\n\n816\n00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,260\nSo, this is what an external\naccess scenario looks like.\n\n817\n00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,330\nIt's like when we talk\nabout adding radius.\n\n818\n00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:19,040\nTacacs or\nTacacs plus would basically be identical.\n\n819\n00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,150\nThe subtle difference is in the shift from\nan industry standard generic platform,\n\n820\n00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,510\nradius is an industry standard.\n\n821\n00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,960\nThere are many vendors that\ncreate radius solutions.\n\n822\n00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,660\nMicrosoft has had theirs over the years.\n\n823\n00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,285\nThe IAS solution was a RADIUS\nsolution from Microsoft.\n\n824\n00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:36,792\nThere's a product called Steel Belted\nRADIUS which many people use and\n\n825\n00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,849\nfairly popular out there for a long time.\n\n826\n00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:41,326\nAnd yes folks it really is\ncalled Steel Belted RADIUS.\n\n827\n00:39:41,326 --> 00:39:45,429\n[LAUGH] And then there are- The Cisco\nspecific implementations of TACACS,\n\n828\n00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:49,923\nTACACS+, which is the Cisco proprietary\nimplementation of how they do RADIUS in\n\n829\n00:39:49,923 --> 00:39:50,850\ntheir systems.\n\n830\n00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,720\nSo there's different ways of doing this,\nbut\n\n831\n00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,360\nat the end of the day,\nthe technology itself is similar.\n\n832\n00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,070\nIt's all the same.\n\n833\n00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,450\nIt's more icing on the cake and branding.\n\n834\n00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,930\nMarketing, in effect,\nif you will, than anything else.\n\n835\n00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,420\nThe underlying architecture, the\nunderlying thought process is the same.\n\n836\n00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,520\nThis is what we would see.\n\n837\n00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,270\nWe would see these protocols,\nas we said PAP, CHAP, EAP being used.\n\n838\n00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:15,910\nPassword authentication Protocol,\nOld-school protocol, very, very, ancient\n\n839\n00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,830\nby today's standards, not used anymore,\nnot very secure, in and of itself.\n\n840\n00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:24,730\nWe would send that password in\nthe clear really not very secure.\n\n841\n00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,950\nRight, so instead we go to CHAP and\nas a result CHAP would then be used, or\n\n842\n00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,630\nCHAP was seen as being a step up.\n\n843\n00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,790\nWe do allow the remote\nentry there to come in and\n\n844\n00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:40,790\nwas standards base PAP and CHAP both,\nbut obviously PAP, not very good.\n\n845\n00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,680\nWe do have an encrypted database\nwhen we used PAP to store that, but\n\n846\n00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,380\nthe password itself was\ntransmitted in the clear.\n\n847\n00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,790\nSo you think about the logic of this\nwe encrypt the data storage for\n\n848\n00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,280\nthe passwords with PAP, but\n\n849\n00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,030\nwe send them in the clear because at the\ntime nobody thought about this and said.\n\n850\n00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,065\nYeah people are gonna tap the wire,\nthey're gonna steal this stuff,\n\n851\n00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:00,480\nwe've got to secure this.\n\n852\n00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,670\nBack in the day we focused on securing\ndata at rest, we didn't really understand\n\n853\n00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,350\ndata on the wire could be subject\nto basically people snooping.\n\n854\n00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:13,500\nFound out very quickly not a very\ngood idea PAP didn't last too long.\n\n855\n00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,410\nWent the way of SLIP, right?\n\n856\n00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,350\nIf you remember SLIP.\n\n857\n00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,060\nSerial Line Interface Protocol for UNIX.\n\n858\n00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,850\nSLIP also a very old school protocol\nto connect old mainframe and\n\n859\n00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,370\nUNIX systems up, really not in use\nany more today, because again,\n\n860\n00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,590\na lot of that information\ntransiting in the clear.\n\n861\n00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,385\nWe go to CHAP.\n\n862\n00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:34,240\nCHAP brings in this idea of basically\nsafeguarding the information,\n\n863\n00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,210\nby doing something we spoke about\nat one of our earlier sessions,\n\n864\n00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,480\nwhich was to create,\nin effect, a hash, right?\n\n865\n00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,740\nWe're not sending\nthe information directly, but\n\n866\n00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,870\nrather a representation of that\ninformation that can be compared\n\n867\n00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:50,830\nwith a stored known quantity on the remote\naccess server directory service side, and\n\n868\n00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:54,640\nif we compare the hash, and understand\nthat the hash equals whatever the stored\n\n869\n00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,100\nvalue is, we're providing\nthe right username and password.\n\n870\n00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,640\nIn this case, the password more so\nthan the username.\n\n871\n00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,970\nAnd as a result of then,\nwe then can validate you and let you in.\n\n872\n00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,190\nIf the hashes didn't match up, we know\nsomebody was trying to do something they\n\n873\n00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,580\nweren't supposed to do, and\nwe would effectively deny access.\n\n874\n00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,600\nWe took a step up on the security side\nwith CHAP, but not because we encrypted.\n\n875\n00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,320\nBut rather we focused on proof\nof origin and integrity, and\n\n876\n00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,170\nmake sure specifically on\nthe integrity side we hash\n\n877\n00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,395\nthe password that is sending is protected\nand we send a representation of it.\n\n878\n00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:29,515\nRemember, with the hash, we cannot reverse\nengineer the hash to get the password.\n\n879\n00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:32,585\nIn effect, we're not exposing\nthe password by hashing it.\n\n880\n00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:34,065\nWe're simply sending\na representation of it.\n\n881\n00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:36,717\nA bit, specific representation of it.\n\n882\n00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:40,307\nQuick knowledge checkpoint for you, those\nof you out there listening to us now and\n\n883\n00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:45,657\nthose of you that will ultimately\nlisten to us when this is rebroadcast.\n\n884\n00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:50,827\nHow many of you remember what the output\nof the MD5 and the SHA1 hashes are?\n\n885\n00:42:50,827 --> 00:42:52,467\nMeaning, what's the bit output for MD5?\n\n886\n00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,220\nIt's a fixed output.\n\n887\n00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,760\nAnd how many of you remember\nwhat the bit output,\n\n888\n00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,500\nthe fixed output was for SHA1 right?\n\n889\n00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,310\nSo if you don't remember, right?\n\n890\n00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,250\nWe have two options here.\n\n891\n00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,980\nOne, we could be nice guys, and tell them.\n\n892\n00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,830\nThe other is, we could tell them to go\nback and watch that episode, right?\n\n893\n00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,430\nThat might be important for you to know.\n\n894\n00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,985\nWe'll give that to you here, real quickly.\n\n895\n00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:11,353\nSHA-1 and MD5.\n\n896\n00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:13,720\nSo, MD5, right?\n\n897\n00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,550\nIs going to be 128-bit output.\n\n898\n00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,690\nFixed output.\n\n899\n00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,210\nAnd SHA1 is gonna be a 160-bit output.\n\n900\n00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,880\nWanna just remember that, make sure we're\ncomfortable with that, or it as you might\n\n901\n00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,275\nhave been putting there, just because it's\nso good you wanna say it twice, right?\n\n902\n00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:30,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so we do have that.\n\n903\n00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,750\nAnd so MS Chap,\nMS Chap V2 are just gonna be steps\n\n904\n00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,530\nup in the sense that Microsoft just\nsimply encapsulates that thought process,\n\n905\n00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,630\nthe CHAP brings into their\nsoftware platform, instantiates it\n\n906\n00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,870\ninside the core of the OS, tweaks it\na little bit, refines it a little bit.\n\n907\n00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,970\nBut at the end of the day, it's just CHAP\nimplemented with a Microsoft veneer.\n\n908\n00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,760\nThat's really what it is.\n\n909\n00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,390\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n910\n00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:55,760\nWhen we talk about\nEAP Extensible Authentication Protocol,\n\n911\n00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,450\nor rather sensible authentication, right?\n\n912\n00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,420\nAnd how we do this, we're talking about\na solution that as we said already,\n\n913\n00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420\nkinda used with TLS.\n\n914\n00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,340\nPotentially used with IPSec there, so\nthat's just something to consider.\n\n915\n00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,290\nBut basically the idea here is that we can\nextend under the EAP umbrella, and use and\n\n916\n00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:16,160\npotentially create new authentication\nmechanisms, as they become necessary and\n\n917\n00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,580\nbecome available.\n\n918\n00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,440\nWe see EAP as being a wrapper or container\nthat allows for this extensibility,\n\n919\n00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,720\nand one of the things it does is it\nbrings a digital certificate support for\n\n920\n00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,200\ninstance for authentication.\n\n921\n00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,500\nThis is one of the things we\nsee up under the EAP banner\n\n922\n00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,550\nthat has been very successful.\n\n923\n00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:37,940\nAnd so, keep in mind that we're using\nthings like hashing digital signatures in\n\n924\n00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,490\nEAP, excuse me.\n\n925\n00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,690\nThis is being used in the 802.11\nwireless LAN standards, for instance.\n\n926\n00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,080\nSo 802.11 for the wireless side.\n\n927\n00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,920\nWe'll be talking about that in\na future upcoming episode as well.\n\n928\n00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,338\nWe'll see the implementation of EAP\nthere to do some security work there.\n\n929\n00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:56,640\nWPA, for\ninstance we'll be using a WPA, WPA2,\n\n930\n00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,950\nwe'll be using versions or implementation\nsolutions built up under the EAP banner.\n\n931\n00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,690\nJust be aware that we're authenticating\nend user devices with that solution.\n\n932\n00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,510\nThat's what EAP does, and as\na challenge-response kind of solution as\n\n933\n00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,300\nwell, where we're sending out\nthe challenge, authenticating and\n\n934\n00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,010\ncoming back, but it's much more flexible\nand hence the name, extensible.\n\n935\n00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,140\nAs the thought process there.\n\n936\n00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,790\nWe've already talked about some of the\nserver based access controls, the Radius,\n\n937\n00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,020\nthe TACACS, the TACACS+.\n\n938\n00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,840\nSo, we've been through those, wanted\nto mention Kerberos here quickly for\n\n939\n00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,790\nyou as well.\n\n940\n00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:32,500\nThe original Kerberos RFC, and I thought\nit was important to mention this,\n\n941\n00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,310\nis listed there, it's 1510 because\na lot of people mistake Kerberos,\n\n942\n00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,970\nfor several things that it's not.\n\n943\n00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,370\nFirst of all, they assume again, and this\nis no discredit by the way to Microsoft,\n\n944\n00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:46,020\nwhen I say Microsoft took it and\nmarketed it.\n\n945\n00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,740\nAnd put it into their operating system and\nbranded it.\n\n946\n00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,850\nAnd made it popular.\n\n947\n00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,740\nBut it's not that Microsoft\ninvented Kerberos so\n\n948\n00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,470\nI just want to be clear about this.\n\n949\n00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,470\nCuz I often get asked about this a lot\nsince we hear about Kerberos all the time,\n\n950\n00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:01,740\nit actually as a solution that was\noriginally created or thought up and\n\n951\n00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,040\nproffered under this RFC 15 ten.\n\n952\n00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,140\nIt was based on work done at\nMIT of all places, right.\n\n953\n00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,100\nIt was a group there that\ndesigned the solution ultimately.\n\n954\n00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,870\nNamed after the mythical three headed dog\nthat guarded the gates of the underworld.\n\n955\n00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:19,810\nIf you are up on your Disney animated\nlore, you may have seen Kerberos hanging\n\n956\n00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:24,515\nout there when we took a look at\nHercules because he was in Hercules.\n\n957\n00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,860\nKerberos at some point to Hercules,\n\n958\n00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,990\nalso I think in Harry Potter when we\nhad the only Harry Potter episode.\n\n959\n00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:32,010\n>> You had me wondering, I was like what\nDisney movie did they go to Hell in?\n\n960\n00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,390\n>> But Hercules, right?\n\n961\n00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,140\nCuz you see\n>> I never saw it.\n\n962\n00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,240\n>> You see the underworld because you\nsee the battle between Zeus, right?\n\n963\n00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,690\nAnd you see the battle between Hades.\n\n964\n00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:43,960\nAnd so as a result,\nHades is down there hanging out below and\n\n965\n00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,020\nHercules has to go down there.\n\n966\n00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:45,770\nRemember, right?\n\n967\n00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,130\nWe're getting to the whole myth and\nlore thing.\n\n968\n00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:51,370\nSo tune in for the episode later\ntoday on Greek urban myth and\n\n969\n00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,840\nlegend and Roman urban myth and legend.\n\n970\n00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,470\n>> There we go.\n>> And we'll do the whole comparison of\n\n971\n00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:55,720\nthe Pantheons, right?\n\n972\n00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,100\nBut they also do it in Harry Potter, one\nof the early Harry Potter segments, right?\n\n973\n00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,400\nWhere they actually have\nthe three headed dog guarding the.\n\n974\n00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,780\nThe trapped door or whatever it is.\n\n975\n00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,865\nAnd that's the only part of\nHarry Potter I know, by the way,\n\n976\n00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:10,180\ncuz I never saw the movies, although\nI've heard that they were very good.\n\n977\n00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,390\nSo, we have all those solutions, right?\n\n978\n00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,350\nKerberos is gonna be the solution\nthat Microsoft again takes.\n\n979\n00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,890\nImplements, really makes basically\npopular for people to use.\n\n980\n00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,790\nAnd is all over the place today.\n\n981\n00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:22,820\nEverybody uses it.\n\n982\n00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,747\nBut it was being used in non\nMicrosoft solutions as well.\n\n983\n00:47:25,747 --> 00:47:29,778\nAnd was before Microsoft popularized it,\nso we've got some followup URLs on\n\n984\n00:47:29,778 --> 00:47:33,498\nthere for you, I think the original\nRFC FTP URL, and then the Microsoft\n\n985\n00:47:33,498 --> 00:47:37,174\nreference to the graphic, and\nmaybe we could pull that up real quick.\n\n986\n00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:40,853\nAnd let's just talk about how Kerberos\nworks, it is gonna be Pretty important for\n\n987\n00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:41,771\nyou to understand.\n\n988\n00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:43,826\nI think we need just a little\nbit more at the bottom there.\n\n989\n00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:45,450\nI think we're good right there.\n\n990\n00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,680\nYeah, we don't really need the text.\n\n991\n00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,540\nWe just need that.\n\n992\n00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,310\nYeah, that's good.\n\n993\n00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:53,170\nAnd then,\nwe gonna zoom in there a little bit.\n\n994\n00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:53,900\nOkay, perfect.\n\n995\n00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,830\nVery good.\n\n996\n00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,050\nOh yeah, that's good.\n\n997\n00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,222\nOkay, coming at you.\n[SOUND] 3D, right.\n\n998\n00:47:58,222 --> 00:47:59,256\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n999\n00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:00,640\nthe building blocks of Kerberos.\n\n1000\n00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,770\nThat's spend a couple minutes breaking\nthis down and talking about it to you,\n\n1001\n00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:06,190\nWe have six numbered items\nhere we'll break them down and\n\n1002\n00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:07,860\ntalk about them along the way.\n\n1003\n00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,700\nBut let's set the stage for\nwhat Kerberos is gonna represent for us.\n\n1004\n00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,260\nSo when the client, the end user, right?\n\n1005\n00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,710\nWhich is sitting over there on the left\nlower hand quadrant of the diagram\n\n1006\n00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,620\nis trying to authenticate,\nlog into the domain and\n\n1007\n00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,850\nthen ultimately access\nservices through the domain.\n\n1008\n00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,350\nThere's two distinct things we\ngotta understand here as a process,\n\n1009\n00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:31,010\nthe client has to first authenticate and\nprove identity at the domain,\n\n1010\n00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,590\nat the LDAP Controller.\n\n1011\n00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:36,660\nThat'll be the active directory since\nthis is a Microsoft specific document.\n\n1012\n00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,182\nWill see this picture from\nthe Microsoft perspective.\n\n1013\n00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:42,615\nWe'll use Microsoft's language\nwill say we're authenticating\n\n1014\n00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:46,135\nagainst an active directory\nbased domain controller.\n\n1015\n00:48:46,135 --> 00:48:47,495\nAnd so we will go up there and\n\n1016\n00:48:47,495 --> 00:48:51,635\nthe first couple of steps will be around\ngetting a authentication solution going.\n\n1017\n00:48:51,635 --> 00:48:52,942\nAnd getting a ticket.\n\n1018\n00:48:52,942 --> 00:48:57,072\nSpecifically and we'll talk about what\nit is from the authentication service\n\n1019\n00:48:57,072 --> 00:49:01,052\nthat gives us the ability to validate\nidentity and prove that we belong.\n\n1020\n00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:01,722\nRight?\n\n1021\n00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:06,252\nThen the latter stages of that\nexchange is gonna be the five and\n\n1022\n00:49:06,252 --> 00:49:08,232\nsix area down below, right,\n\n1023\n00:49:08,232 --> 00:49:11,582\nonce we've done that cuz that's kind of\nthe first four or five, or the first four,\n\n1024\n00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:16,080\nrather, steps and then going across the\nbottom there, when the client then wants\n\n1025\n00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,610\nto access a network service,\nwhatever that network service may be.\n\n1026\n00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:24,240\nIt could be DNS for name resolution,\ncould be DHCP to validate and\n\n1027\n00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,510\nget an IP address, lease one,\nre-lease one, whatever.\n\n1028\n00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,956\nBecause we're gonna authorize our DHCP\nservers in the active directory so\n\n1029\n00:49:30,956 --> 00:49:33,197\nthey don't have any rogue\nDHCP things going on,\n\n1030\n00:49:33,197 --> 00:49:36,280\nso you're gonna need a Kerberos\nticket to be able to do that.\n\n1031\n00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,560\nWe might be accessing\na file in print solution,\n\n1032\n00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,130\ncould be trying to get to a website,\ndoesn't really matter what.\n\n1033\n00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:46,320\nWe're gonna then use that initial ticket\nto then get a secondary ticket called\n\n1034\n00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,600\nan ST or a service ticket.\n\n1035\n00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,540\nSometimes, incorrectly referred\nto as a session ticket, but\n\n1036\n00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,240\ntypically it's a service ticket for\nthat session.\n\n1037\n00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,200\nAnd as a result will then be able to\nvalidate that we actually can consume\n\n1038\n00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,400\nthe service.\n\n1039\n00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,020\nLet's go through and break this down\nstep by step and talk about it,\n\n1040\n00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,420\nand make sure we're\ncomfortable with the idea.\n\n1041\n00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,120\nUp top we have our domain controller.\n\n1042\n00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,480\nNotice the block of the domain controller\nincorporates all of this functionality.\n\n1043\n00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,430\nThe first thing to understand in\nthe Microsoft world is that the domain\n\n1044\n00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,150\ncontroller is also\nwhat's known as the KDC.\n\n1045\n00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:21,780\nIn a Kerberos solution, the KDC,\nthe Key Distribution Center,\n\n1046\n00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,370\nis the Kerberos server that\nauthenticates and grants tickets.\n\n1047\n00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:31,110\nAuthenticates runs the authentication\nservice, tying into the LDAP provider, and\n\n1048\n00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:34,730\ndoes the ticket granting service,\nactually gives out the tickets.\n\n1049\n00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,540\nThis role,\n\n1050\n00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:40,370\nthis capability, is built right into the\ndomain controller on the Microsoft side.\n\n1051\n00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:44,470\nAs a result, when you create a domain\ncontroller by doing a DC promo event, and\n\n1052\n00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,980\nyou take a standalone server and\ncreate a domain, a forest, a tree,\n\n1053\n00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,530\nand a domain, or join an existing\narchitecture, you basically add in\n\n1054\n00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:56,300\nthis functionality as part of adding\nin and creating the domain interface.\n\n1055\n00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,720\nWe don't see it as separate in\ncase you go looking for it.\n\n1056\n00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,260\nIt's a not a role,\nit's not a feature you can add.\n\n1057\n00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,340\nIt's part of the process of building\nthe domain controller functionality.\n\n1058\n00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,260\nIt's built right in,\nin other words, right?\n\n1059\n00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,530\nAnd so inside that active\ndirectory based domain controller,\n\n1060\n00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,020\nthe client authenticates\nby hitting step one there.\n\n1061\n00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:16,100\nSo the client requests what's know\nas a TGT, a Ticket Granting Ticket,\n\n1062\n00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,230\nfrom the KDC, the Key Distribution Center.\n\n1063\n00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,180\nWe hit that Key Distribution Center,\n\n1064\n00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,390\nthe KDC functionality, we talk to\nthe authentication service which is\n\n1065\n00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,430\none of the services that\nmakes up the curb row set.\n\n1066\n00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,450\nWe see basically I am Adam,\nas a user, my credential is,\n\n1067\n00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:39,560\nmy password is going to be Adam1 and\nmy user identity is AdamG as a user.\n\n1068\n00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,630\nI come in,\nI present that in my request for the TGT.\n\n1069\n00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:45,020\nIn step two, as you can see,\n\n1070\n00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:50,770\nthe authentication service will send\nme an encrypted TGT in session key.\n\n1071\n00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,960\nAssuming I authenticate.\n\n1072\n00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,386\nSo, actually, step 1A, right?\n\n1073\n00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:56,641\nWhich we don't really have a number for,\nbut we should list there,\n\n1074\n00:51:56,641 --> 00:52:00,126\nis the bidirectional arrow that goes\nout from authentication service,\n\n1075\n00:52:00,126 --> 00:52:03,560\nover to the active directory,\nright, up there on the left.\n\n1076\n00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,680\nThat's kinda step 1A.\n\n1077\n00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,790\nBecause, remember,\nthis is all in the same machine.\n\n1078\n00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,810\nBut internally, what's happening is\nKerberos is talking to the directory, and\n\n1079\n00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:15,830\ngetting confirmation of the user\nidentity from the LDAP provider.\n\n1080\n00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,673\nThis could be a NIS solution by the way,\nthis could be a,\n\n1081\n00:52:18,673 --> 00:52:22,667\njust a Linux based LDAP provider, it does\nnot need to be the active directory,\n\n1082\n00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:26,241\nalthough if you are using Microsoft's\nimplementation of Kerberos,\n\n1083\n00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:28,265\njust to be clear with you on this point.\n\n1084\n00:52:28,265 --> 00:52:31,923\nYou cannot use this solution because\nit is been tweaked, it is not 100%\n\n1085\n00:52:31,923 --> 00:52:36,221\naligned with the standard implementation,\nto then cross pollinate without doing some\n\n1086\n00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:40,010\narchitecture in the middle to make sure\nthe two know how to talk to each other.\n\n1087\n00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,790\nBecause Microsoft is changed slightly\n\n1088\n00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:48,080\nthe way that Kerberos works in\nthe outside world from the RFC standard.\n\n1089\n00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,840\nEnough that it will not talk directly\nunless you put some middle-ware\n\n1090\n00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,510\nin there and kinda crafted,\nalmost like the gateway services for\n\n1091\n00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,130\nnovelle used to be, things like that.\n\n1092\n00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,049\nJust be aware of that in case you're\ntrying to do multi-directional or\n\n1093\n00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:03,440\nmulti-directory based, that will\nprovide authentication with federation,\n\n1094\n00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,440\nit gets a little complicated.\n\n1095\n00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,705\nAnd there's a lot of additional\nstuff you gotta worry about.\n\n1096\n00:53:06,705 --> 00:53:08,100\nBut that's another show, right?\n\n1097\n00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,465\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So come back and join us for\n\n1098\n00:53:10,465 --> 00:53:13,495\narchitecting in the cloud, we'll be\ntalking about all that stuff then.\n\n1099\n00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:15,965\nWhen we do client requests in TGT,\nwe have step 1a,\n\n1100\n00:53:15,965 --> 00:53:18,615\nwe do the authentication\nin the LDAP provider.\n\n1101\n00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:19,255\nWe come back.\n\n1102\n00:53:19,255 --> 00:53:22,175\nStep 2 then, we authenticate services and\n\n1103\n00:53:22,175 --> 00:53:24,855\nas a result, rather the authentication\nservice rather, authenticates.\n\n1104\n00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:27,390\nIt says yes, we get this encrypted and\n\n1105\n00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,720\nit's important to stress\nthe idea of encrypted.\n\n1106\n00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,310\nWe get this encrypted.\n\n1107\n00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:35,390\nTGT, Ticket Granting Ticket,\nwhich is basically a ticket that gives\n\n1108\n00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:38,090\nus permission to go and\nrequest other tickets.\n\n1109\n00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,330\nThat will Will be an important thought\nprocess, as we come back to this\n\n1110\n00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,430\nservice ticket that we will get\nhere in just a couple of minutes.\n\n1111\n00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:48,480\nThe ticket granting service, the TGS,\noff to the right of the authentication\n\n1112\n00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,595\nservice box,\nis gonna coming into play here next.\n\n1113\n00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:54,405\nWe have our TGT,\nit's encrypted our session key.\n\n1114\n00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:59,635\nStep three, we go to the TGT,\nthe Ticket Granting Service.\n\n1115\n00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:01,245\nThe TGS, rather it should say.\n\n1116\n00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:03,775\nWe go back to the Kerberos,\ngo to the ticket granting service,\n\n1117\n00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:08,040\npresent our TGT and our session key.\n\n1118\n00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,070\nHere's who I am.\n\n1119\n00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,150\nI've now been authenticated,\nI would now like to access or\n\n1120\n00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,910\nrequest services from the domain or\nfrom the directory.\n\n1121\n00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:19,150\nHere's my credential to do so,\nis effectively what we're doing.\n\n1122\n00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,890\nThe ticket-granting service in step four,\ncomes down and\n\n1123\n00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,690\nsends us an encrypted session key and\na ticket, so\n\n1124\n00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,700\nwe now have two encrypted session keys,\ntwo encrypted tickets, in effect.\n\n1125\n00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,880\nNow we're on our second ticket.\n\n1126\n00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,140\nWe've cached both of\nthose on the client side.\n\n1127\n00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,820\nNow there's some interesting tools\nyou can look at from a forensics and\n\n1128\n00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,270\nhacking perspective.\n\n1129\n00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,200\nTo work with Kerberos,\nbreak it up, and see these things.\n\n1130\n00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,660\nCurb Tray is one of those tools\nthat you may go out and download.\n\n1131\n00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,760\nIt's a set of tools that allows\nyou to see the Kerberos exchange,\n\n1132\n00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,380\nto see the tickets coming down, so you may\nwant to just explore that at some point.\n\n1133\n00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,930\nTake a gander at it, and see what's\ngoing on there if you're interested.\n\n1134\n00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,720\nIt's a great way to kind\nof see this come to life.\n\n1135\n00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,250\nThese tickets are stored\non the client's side.\n\n1136\n00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,440\nThey are cashed for a period of time.\n\n1137\n00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,480\nThe default window in Microsoft, again,\nmodifiable through group policy,\n\n1138\n00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,810\nis a seven-day window for\nthe ticket life-cycle, the TTL,\n\n1139\n00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:17,020\nplus one session which is traditionally\nbeen 12 hours so you get seven and\n\n1140\n00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,590\na half days, at least in early\nimplementations that's what you would get\n\n1141\n00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,110\nI haven't looked to see in the server\ntwelve R2, if we've update that.\n\n1142\n00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:25,130\nAnd that might have changed.\n\n1143\n00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,460\nBut, traditionally,\nthat's roughly the window we would get.\n\n1144\n00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,250\nMeaning, if a user stays logged on,\nand doesn't shut off their PC for\n\n1145\n00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:35,560\nthat amount of time, they effectively\ncan use these initial ticket setups for\n\n1146\n00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,430\nup to a week plus, a session.\n\n1147\n00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:40,865\nAnd then they do time out and then the\nauthentication process reiterates itself,\n\n1148\n00:55:40,865 --> 00:55:42,670\nyou have to kick in and get a brand new...\n\n1149\n00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,998\nTGT and a new session key, and\nthen a brand new service session, and\n\n1150\n00:55:45,998 --> 00:55:50,032\nthen ultimately go out and request more\ntickets So, keep in mind, from a security\n\n1151\n00:55:50,032 --> 00:55:54,180\nstandpoint, just like we know with\nother stuff in Windows, like our token.\n\n1152\n00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,730\nIf we don't log off of a use\nthat's being locked out, or\n\n1153\n00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,890\nmodified from a security standpoint,\nbecause that token is static.\n\n1154\n00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:05,260\nThe tickets are static, they are cached\nwith the user credential with the token.\n\n1155\n00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,240\nIf we don't log that user out, they still\nhave access to those resources they've\n\n1156\n00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,990\nalready touched, and\nas a result can still see them.\n\n1157\n00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,270\nDuring the security scenario, where we\nmay need to get them out of the system to\n\n1158\n00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:19,300\nchange their permissions, change\ntheir access rights, cut off access,\n\n1159\n00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,310\nthis is something\nimportant to keep in mind.\n\n1160\n00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,740\nSo just remember that, because those\ntickets do live for a period of time.\n\n1161\n00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,310\nThe other thing to think about here,\nbefore we go to steps five and\n\n1162\n00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:31,220\nsix, is what can we do\nto disrupt Kerberos?\n\n1163\n00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,180\nSo, I'm thinking about a denial\nof service attack, for instance.\n\n1164\n00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,670\nSo again, bringing up some\nof that hacking knowledge.\n\n1165\n00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,990\nAnd bring it back in and throwing it\non the table here quickly for you.\n\n1166\n00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,690\nWhat can we do to disrupt this?\n\n1167\n00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:46,440\nSo, one of the key things we may do, and\nprobably the key thing we could do easily.\n\n1168\n00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,050\nWould be to decouple time synchronization,\ninside of our domain infrastructure,\n\n1169\n00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,010\ninside of our LDAP infrastructure.\n\n1170\n00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:56,760\nAnd if we can knock out the time\nsynchronization solution, and\n\n1171\n00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,660\nby the way, quick knowledge check for\nyou quick quiz.\n\n1172\n00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,800\nWhat is the protocol that does\ntime synchronization for us?\n\n1173\n00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,380\nDoes anybody know?\n\n1174\n00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,790\nI think Don knows he was whispering in my\near earlier that he wanted me to ask that\n\n1175\n00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,365\nquestion because he knew, the answer.\n\n1176\n00:57:08,365 --> 00:57:11,468\nSo, what are we gonna look for\nwhen we do time synchronization,\n\n1177\n00:57:11,468 --> 00:57:13,425\nwhat protocol we're gonna to look for?\n\n1178\n00:57:13,425 --> 00:57:17,165\n>> Well, assuming the environment is\nnot doing manual time setting which is\n\n1179\n00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:18,205\ninsane these days.\n\n1180\n00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:21,317\nThey're more than likely using\nNTP right more time for protocol.\n\n1181\n00:57:21,317 --> 00:57:24,737\nAnd NTP in its default arrangements,\n\n1182\n00:57:24,737 --> 00:57:26,807\noriginal arrangements,\nis not very secure at all.\n\n1183\n00:57:26,807 --> 00:57:28,937\nSo, its a great target for attacks.\n\n1184\n00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:29,767\n>> It is.\n\n1185\n00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:30,557\nAnd it runs on port 123.\n\n1186\n00:57:30,557 --> 00:57:31,997\nWe keep stressing that to you,\n\n1187\n00:57:31,997 --> 00:57:37,007\nso but, the idea here is that if we can\nget the domain controllers, the KDCs,\n\n1188\n00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:41,787\ndesynchronized, meaning they spread out\nand start loosing time synchronization.\n\n1189\n00:57:41,787 --> 00:57:45,590\nBy more than five minutes by default\nwe now have broken Kerberos.\n\n1190\n00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,230\nNow again, this is a modified\ntime value through group\n\n1191\n00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:52,690\npolicy on the Mircosoft side, and so if we\nallowed more than what we call time drift,\n\n1192\n00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:57,330\nthat's the name we use for\nit in the vehicular of IT security.\n\n1193\n00:57:57,330 --> 00:58:00,340\nIf we allow time drift to occur for\nmore than five minutes,\n\n1194\n00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,260\nthen all of a sudden this whole\nprocess just comes to a grinding halt.\n\n1195\n00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,480\nClients cannot get through\nsteps one through four,\n\n1196\n00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,290\nbecause they can't authenticate because\nnow the KDCs are out of sync, and\n\n1197\n00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:13,200\nthey cannot time stamp these tickets,\nwhich is crucial to success.\n\n1198\n00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,550\nBecause the ticket is time stamped to\nvalidate when it was issued, by who, and\n\n1199\n00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:20,270\nhow long it has until it\ndies through the TTL?\n\n1200\n00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:25,060\nSo, a five minute or\nmore deviation basically breaks Kerberos.\n\n1201\n00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,770\nQuick fix though on the DOS side, right?\n\n1202\n00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,820\nSo, if we do a distributed,\neither distributed denial of service and\n\n1203\n00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,200\nwe attack multiple NTP points\nthroughout an architecture.\n\n1204\n00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,640\nOr a DOS, a localized attack\njust against this one area.\n\n1205\n00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,450\nAll we gotta do is resynchronize\nthe Domain Controllers.\n\n1206\n00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,340\nPut them back in within\na five minute window,\n\n1207\n00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,100\nand all of a sudden everything cranks\nback up again almost immediately.\n\n1208\n00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,120\nSo, it's very easy to break, but it's\nalso very easy to fix in that respect.\n\n1209\n00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,878\nGo out and practice that on\nyour friends network today.\n\n1210\n00:58:48,878 --> 00:58:50,410\nRight now, you go do that.\n\n1211\n00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,072\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right now.\n\n1212\n00:58:51,072 --> 00:58:51,769\nSee how that works.\n\n1213\n00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:53,127\nCome back and let us know.\n\n1214\n00:58:53,127 --> 00:58:54,404\n>> See, how long they stay your friends?\n\n1215\n00:58:54,404 --> 00:58:57,524\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Pick somebody you're not planning to\n\n1216\n00:58:57,524 --> 00:59:01,440\nsending you're greeting card, to over\nChristmas or Hanukkah for the holidays.\n\n1217\n00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,248\nAll right,\nif we could go back to the picture here.\n\n1218\n00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,800\nWe do wanna finish up this discussion,\nwrap this step five and\n\n1219\n00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,900\nsix into our discussion and finish up.\n\n1220\n00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,660\nSo, we see we now have at the bottom.\n\n1221\n00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,820\nWe have our TGS or\nour Ticket Granting Service,\n\n1222\n00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,390\nsending us our encrypted session key and\nticket.\n\n1223\n00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:16,880\nTicket and session key number two.\n\n1224\n00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,160\nAnd now what we're gonna do is go out, and\nwe are going to use that as the client and\n\n1225\n00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,740\nsay, we'll now I actually need a service.\n\n1226\n00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,780\nSo I'm gonna go out, and\nI'm gonna request it and\n\n1227\n00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:30,040\nnotice we're requesting it from another\nserver, somewhere else in the directory,\n\n1228\n00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,290\nin the network, doesn't matter where.\n\n1229\n00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:34,170\nIt has to obviously be within\nthe boundary of our forest, so\n\n1230\n00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,190\nsomewhere within the LDAP namespace.\n\n1231\n00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:38,050\nBut, it may be in another area.\n\n1232\n00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:41,490\nThe idea's that we're now\ngonna use this ticket service,\n\n1233\n00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,310\nthat we have accessed on the KDC,\n\n1234\n00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:48,200\nand the credentials we have gotten to\nnow properly authenticate ourselves.\n\n1235\n00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,940\nShow the service provider the server\nthat has the service that we want.\n\n1236\n00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,060\nThat we're authorized to\nbe able to access it, and\n\n1237\n00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:57,720\nthen we're gonna be able to get\nback that service and consume it.\n\n1238\n00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,750\nAnd so in step five and step six,\nwe send our service ticket,\n\n1239\n01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,330\nour ST, over to the Server.\n\n1240\n01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,560\nThe server validates our ST.\n\n1241\n01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,700\nSends back the encrypted time stamp.\n\n1242\n01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,420\nThis is again why time synchronization,\nbecomes so\n\n1243\n01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,150\nimportant throughout the infrastructure.\n\n1244\n01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:16,050\nAnd then, gives us the right to\naccess the service, whatever it is,\n\n1245\n01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,420\nmaybe multiple services\nthat we may be looking for.\n\n1246\n01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,860\nSo these are the six steps\nassociated with Kebros.\n\n1247\n01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,460\nIt's gonna be important for you,\nto be able to be knowledgable enough about\n\n1248\n01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,450\nKerberos, knowledgable enough\nabout the architecture.\n\n1249\n01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:33,410\nTo be able to explain what happens\nbetween, the client and the KDC, and\n\n1250\n01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:36,710\nthe client and\nthe server when requesting a service?\n\n1251\n01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,620\nAt the level that we\njust went through it at.\n\n1252\n01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:41,470\nMeaning, walk your way\nthrough those six points.\n\n1253\n01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:45,350\nHave a working knowledge, of making sure\nyou understand what happens at each one.\n\n1254\n01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:49,020\nIt is not a Microsoft specific\nconversation, I wanna be clear.\n\n1255\n01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,040\nMake it generic,\n\n1256\n01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,250\njust understand that the KDC is gonna be\nfound inside the lDAP directory somewhere.\n\n1257\n01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,560\nWhether it's on the directory controller,\nor\n\n1258\n01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,410\nseparate from it is not\ncritical to your success.\n\n1259\n01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:04,810\nBut, knowing it is a role that must be\navailable with two constituent parts.\n\n1260\n01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:07,830\nAuthentication service and\nticket granting service, and\n\n1261\n01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:12,850\nthe conversation points between the client\nand the KDC, and decline in the server,\n\n1262\n01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:15,460\nare what we wanna pivot on here, and\nmake sure we're comfortable with.\n\n1263\n01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,940\n>> All right, very good.\n\n1264\n01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:22,879\nSo, I think we've gone ahead and exhausted\nour conversational opportunities again.\n\n1265\n01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,645\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In this particular segment.\n\n1266\n01:01:24,645 --> 01:01:29,005\nSo we have gone through, and spent a lot\nof time hopefully helping you to better\n\n1267\n01:01:29,005 --> 01:01:33,405\nunderstand remote access, some of the\nprotocols associated with that process,\n\n1268\n01:01:33,405 --> 01:01:35,930\nand specifically,\ndelved deep into Kerberos.\n\n1269\n01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:36,710\nTo debunk it and\n\n1270\n01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:39,290\nmake sure you are comfortable with\nthe architecture, and how it works?\n\n1271\n01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,640\n>> All right now, one of the things\nthat we drew in the diagram, or\n\n1272\n01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,180\nwe had in the diagrams before,\nwas a firewall.\n\n1273\n01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,530\nAnd that's gonna be our\nnext topic that we hit on.\n\n1274\n01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:49,810\nSo, why don't we go ahead and\nstop and take a break?\n\n1275\n01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:53,180\nBefore gaming, because that's\na pretty big topic in and of itself.\n\n1276\n01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,201\nSo, let's take a break here.\nStay tuned,\n\n1277\n01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:56,261\nwhen we get back we're\ngonna hit on firewalls.\n\n1278\n01:01:56,261 --> 01:01:56,917\nIt'll be a good time.\n\n1279\n01:01:56,917 --> 01:01:57,566\n>> All right.\n\n1280\n01:01:57,566 --> 01:01:58,484\nSee you soon.\n\n1281\n01:01:58,484 --> 01:02:02,837\n[MUSIC]\n\n1282\n01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:06,679\n>> All right.\n\n1283\n01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:07,237\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1284\n01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:10,912\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're driving our director nuts today,\n\n1285\n01:02:10,912 --> 01:02:14,476\nbecause we don't wanna\nlisten to his scene madness.\n\n1286\n01:02:14,476 --> 01:02:16,685\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, all right, so\n\n1287\n01:02:16,685 --> 01:02:20,785\nwe're gonna jump back in and\ntake a look at probably some of\n\n1288\n01:02:20,785 --> 01:02:23,975\nthe most important devices that we\nhave on our network, firewalls.\n\n1289\n01:02:23,975 --> 01:02:27,670\nAnd, obviously not the only key to\nnetwork security but pinblock point, and\n\n1290\n01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:31,650\ntake a look at some of the different\nones and how we implement those.\n\n1291\n01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,242\n>> Okay, very good, so\nwhat we are gonna do I think we've got,\n\n1292\n01:02:34,242 --> 01:02:37,890\nwe're gonna put up a quick list of\nitems and notes we want to refer to.\n\n1293\n01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:41,900\nSo, just to remind you as we get\nstarted with the Firewall Generation.\n\n1294\n01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,800\nWe've spoke about this prior episode,\ngonna be an important knowledge point for\n\n1295\n01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,490\nyou to make sure you bring\nto the conversation here.\n\n1296\n01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:51,240\nSo we thought it was a good way to review\nthat material just by having it up for\n\n1297\n01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:56,920\nyou, so you can see Gen 1 through Gen 5,\nor first gen through 5th gen there.\n\n1298\n01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,180\nSo packet filters,\n\n1299\n01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:02,230\napplication layer, a solutions which\nare referred to proxying firewalls.\n\n1300\n01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:05,580\nStateful packet filtering,\ndynamic packet filtering.\n\n1301\n01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:09,390\nThe old popular, oldie but a newie,\nand a goodie, and a gooey.\n\n1302\n01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,810\nI guess you could say as well.\n\n1303\n01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:11,670\nColonel filtering,\n\n1304\n01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:15,415\nwhich is referred to sometimes as\nnext gen or next gen Firewall.\n\n1305\n01:03:15,415 --> 01:03:18,365\nSo, what we're gonna do is\ntake those generations, and\n\n1306\n01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:19,625\nnow walk down a level in them.\n\n1307\n01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,665\nAnd we're going to talk about,\n\n1308\n01:03:20,665 --> 01:03:25,295\nhow we build network architecture using\nthese different kinds of solutions?\n\n1309\n01:03:25,295 --> 01:03:29,510\nWhatever firewall we may use, we're\ngonna to now focus on the architecture\n\n1310\n01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:32,920\nof building firewalls into our\nnetworks and what they may look like.\n\n1311\n01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:38,440\nI can share with you some screen captures,\npictures.\n\n1312\n01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,740\nWhat am I looking here for Don?\n\n1313\n01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,518\n>> A word it sounds [CROSSTALK] like\ntwo syllables first one is, right?\n\n1314\n01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,126\nSo we're gonna play charades, and\n\n1315\n01:03:44,126 --> 01:03:46,880\nwe're gonna take a look here\nactually at some diagrams.\n\n1316\n01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,837\nAnd we're gonna take a look at,\nhow different architectures may appear?\n\n1317\n01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:52,379\nAnd then, do a little discussion\nof them along the way.\n\n1318\n01:03:52,379 --> 01:03:53,756\nSo, what do we have up here?\n\n1319\n01:03:53,756 --> 01:03:57,688\nThis is going to be a cloud, the internet\nsitting off to the right hand side,\n\n1320\n01:03:57,688 --> 01:04:00,160\nwe have a firewall clearly evident there.\n\n1321\n01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,860\nWe have a connection coming inbound\nfrom the cloud, so in from the firewall.\n\n1322\n01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:07,080\nRather, into the firewall, down through\nthe firewall, and into the LAN.\n\n1323\n01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,690\nAnd so\nwhat we would see here is going to be\n\n1324\n01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:15,330\neffectively what we call a boundary router\nor a packet filtering firewall solution.\n\n1325\n01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:18,840\nVery simple architecture,\nsingle firewall, right?\n\n1326\n01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,980\nOne connection coming in,\none connection going out,\n\n1327\n01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,030\ndoing some basic filtering there.\n\n1328\n01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,710\nProbably have an access\ncontrol list of some kind,\n\n1329\n01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:30,050\nwith some logical rules that\nare set up there to manage traffic,\n\n1330\n01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:35,560\neither based on IP address, Mac address,\nprotocol type, maybe packet type,\n\n1331\n01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:40,230\nthings of that nature, maybe even content\nwithin, that would be filtered as well,\n\n1332\n01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:44,230\nalthough that would be typically a later\nstage and smarter kind of firewall.\n\n1333\n01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:46,710\nBut this is the kinda stuff\nthat we would see going on, and\n\n1334\n01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,730\nyou could see as long as we\nget through the boundary, and\n\n1335\n01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:51,590\nwe meet the criteria of the packet filter,\nwhatever it is,\n\n1336\n01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:54,340\nthen we're gonna be allowed access and\nbe able to get in, right?\n\n1337\n01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,490\nNo DMZ.\n\n1338\n01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:59,770\nWe could say in theory, right,\nthat there is a logical connection or\n\n1339\n01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:02,650\na logical boundary point between\nthe physical outside world and\n\n1340\n01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,710\nthe physical inside network, but\nthere was no logical buffer.\n\n1341\n01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,690\nNo DMZ that exists in this model.\n\n1342\n01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:10,036\nRight.\nSo we don't see that as we\n\n1343\n01:05:10,036 --> 01:05:11,456\nhave in our prior networks.\n\n1344\n01:05:11,456 --> 01:05:16,444\n>> And this is a pretty common topology\nthat we'll see in branch offices and\n\n1345\n01:05:16,444 --> 01:05:19,498\nsmall offices small office, home office.\n\n1346\n01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:21,403\n[CROSSTALK] Silly term.\n\n1347\n01:05:21,403 --> 01:05:23,770\nIt's on the exam so why not.\n\n1348\n01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:27,785\nBut if you have a branch office,\nyou probably don't have email servers and\n\n1349\n01:05:27,785 --> 01:05:32,220\nweb servers and public infrastructure\navailable from your branch office.\n\n1350\n01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:37,458\nAnd so you may have a very simple\ntopology like this where maybe\n\n1351\n01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:44,223\nthat firewall there is building up a VPN\ntunnel back to the home office, right?\n\n1352\n01:05:44,223 --> 01:05:45,101\n[LAUGH]\n>> Whoops,\n\n1353\n01:05:45,101 --> 01:05:46,468\nthere goes the diagram remoting out.\n\n1354\n01:05:46,468 --> 01:05:47,519\n>> [CROSSTALK] Crazy with my diagrams.\n\n1355\n01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,285\nSo you might have that where you've\ngot a VPN tunnel that runs out to your\n\n1356\n01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:56,337\nhome office so that all of your\nwork machines can reach out and\n\n1357\n01:05:56,337 --> 01:06:00,730\ngain secure access to that network,\nor whatever.\n\n1358\n01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:03,850\nFor a business, for a small office,\nfor a home office, even for my house.\n\n1359\n01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:07,500\nAt my house, this is the topology I have,\nI have a pfSense Firewall.\n\n1360\n01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,100\nThis sits between my home computers and\nthe internet.\n\n1361\n01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,006\nI don't have a DMZ because I don't\nneed that extra layer of protection,\n\n1362\n01:06:13,006 --> 01:06:15,020\nI don't have any public\ninfrastructure at home.\n\n1363\n01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,850\n>> After discussing that with the public\nat large, you may want to rethink that\n\n1364\n01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,660\narchitecture and\nperhaps change that up just a little bit.\n\n1365\n01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,260\n>> Here's my IP address.\n\n1366\n01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,620\nAnd login to the firewall,\ntake a look at the configuration.\n\n1367\n01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:26,931\n>> If you go to Google maps right now,\n\n1368\n01:06:26,931 --> 01:06:28,852\nyou can see Don waving from\nthe front of his house.\n\n1369\n01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:33,032\nHe'll be outside saying hi for the next\nfive minutes as the satellite passes over.\n\n1370\n01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:36,170\nAll right, so\nwe have here a boundary as we said.\n\n1371\n01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:39,080\nRouter, traditionally referred to\nas a packet filtering firewall.\n\n1372\n01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,920\nBut sometimes just referred\nto in the documentation\n\n1373\n01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,530\nas a perhaps a boundary router,\nit's basically the same thing, right?\n\n1374\n01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,660\nSo now we want to go to\na dual-home solution,\n\n1375\n01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,400\nI believe if we have that diagram up.\n\n1376\n01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,310\n>> Let's see, here.\n\n1377\n01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:50,885\n>> There we go.\n\n1378\n01:06:50,885 --> 01:06:53,060\nSo we have a dual-home solution here,\nand so\n\n1379\n01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:56,360\nwe have our internet cloud as\nyou can see again on the right.\n\n1380\n01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,750\nWe have our firewall connection coming in.\n\n1381\n01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:03,430\nWe have two LAN connections,\nor two internal connections.\n\n1382\n01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:06,840\nI'll refer to them as LANs only because\nthey're on the inside of the firewall,\n\n1383\n01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,390\nnot necessarily cuz they\nboth represent a LAN base.\n\n1384\n01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:13,247\nThat is the dual-home,\nis that the new brand name for dual-home?\n\n1385\n01:07:13,247 --> 01:07:14,070\n>> Dadgummit.\n\n1386\n01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,610\n>> It's the dual-home solution.\n\n1387\n01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:19,290\nWe'll pause for\njust a minute while Don corrects.\n\n1388\n01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:20,100\nThere we go, the dual-home.\n\n1389\n01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,310\n>> I was trying to save money,\nthey charge per letter on this.\n\n1390\n01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:25,545\n>> They do.\nWant to be as constructive and\n\n1391\n01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:29,595\nas formal as possible, but also\nfocused on conserving the environment.\n\n1392\n01:07:29,595 --> 01:07:31,055\nThere's not enough elves to go around, so\n\n1393\n01:07:31,055 --> 01:07:33,385\nwe want to make sure we safe\nguard those if possible.\n\n1394\n01:07:33,385 --> 01:07:37,425\nWe have the DMZ off to the left there\nthat will be one of the two spurs or\n\n1395\n01:07:37,425 --> 01:07:40,945\nconnection points that\nthe dual-home solution provides.\n\n1396\n01:07:40,945 --> 01:07:44,030\nAnd then we have a connection\ndown to the LAN.\n\n1397\n01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:48,260\nAnd you could see that there is\nno direct connection from the DMZ\n\n1398\n01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:53,110\nto the LAN that is allowed out beyond the\nconnections between the firewall segments.\n\n1399\n01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:57,650\nAnd this is important, because the only\nway to go from the DMZ to the LAN,\n\n1400\n01:07:57,650 --> 01:08:02,000\nand by extension the other way,\nis to transit through the firewall, right?\n\n1401\n01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000\nThere is no external or other connection\nthrough a router or a switch,\n\n1402\n01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,890\nwhatever it may be that allows us\nto link these two logical segments,\n\n1403\n01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:13,710\nunless we go through the physicality,\nthe linkage that is being created for\n\n1404\n01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,780\nus through the device,\nthrough the firewall.\n\n1405\n01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:19,400\n>> And that's really important because\nif we did, let's say for example, that\n\n1406\n01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,570\nwhatever switch powered our DMZ was the\nsame switch that powered our LAN, right.\n\n1407\n01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:28,760\nIn those scenarios, if the DMZ could\nbypass the firewall to get to the LAN,\n\n1408\n01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,860\nyou've really defeated the purpose\nof having a DMZ at all.\n\n1409\n01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,250\nRight?\nThe whole purpose of having that DMZ is to\n\n1410\n01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:38,215\nisolate it, and insure that you can use\nyour firewall to control what access goes\n\n1411\n01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:43,345\nin and out, even controlling the access\nthat's going between the DMZ and the LAN.\n\n1412\n01:08:43,345 --> 01:08:48,005\nYou want to filter that because your DMZ,\nthat's containing your risky servers,\n\n1413\n01:08:48,005 --> 01:08:50,625\nthe servers that are exposed\nto the internet.\n\n1414\n01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:53,765\nYour LAN, those machines should\nnot be available, right?\n\n1415\n01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:55,365\nIf I draw another arrow here.\n\n1416\n01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:58,995\nAny of that kind of access,\ninternet to LAN, that should be blocked.\n\n1417\n01:08:58,995 --> 01:09:02,410\nYou don't want an attacker to be\nable to compromise a DMZ machine.\n\n1418\n01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:05,050\nAnd then leap frog to use\nthat to get into your LAN.\n\n1419\n01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:07,990\n>> Well the attacker wants to do that,\nbut you don't want that.\n\n1420\n01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,290\nWe want to take everybody's\nneeds into consideration, right?\n\n1421\n01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:13,100\nWhat about the poor attacker,\nwho's sitting in the cloud, and\n\n1422\n01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,020\nwe're not paying any attention to\ntheir needs, they're feeling unloved.\n\n1423\n01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,830\n>> You want the happy hacker,\nnot the sad hacker.\n\n1424\n01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:19,920\n>> You want the happy hacker,\nnot the sad hacker, exactly.\n\n1425\n01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,530\n>> Crying on the inside.\n\n1426\n01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:24,330\n>> I'm happy on the outside, but\nI'm very depressed on the inside.\n\n1427\n01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,660\nVery unhappy.\n\n1428\n01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:28,210\nAll right so, we've gone through,\nwe've talked about dual-home.\n\n1429\n01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:30,850\nLet's talk about screened host.\n\n1430\n01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:32,960\nWhat a screened host will look like.\n\n1431\n01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,680\nOr a screened sub-net firewall,\nit's effectively gonna be the same thing.\n\n1432\n01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,080\nAnd so\nwhat we see here is again we have this.\n\n1433\n01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:43,310\nBy the way,\nthis is more of a traditional model\n\n1434\n01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:47,270\nthat we often see in documentation\nwhen we talk about a DMZ.\n\n1435\n01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:50,180\nThis is a two firewall-based DMZ.\n\n1436\n01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,940\nWe call it a screened sub-net.\n\n1437\n01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:55,150\nAnd the idea here is that this\nis where we will build out\n\n1438\n01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:58,970\na second firewall to add\nadditional filtering capabilities,\n\n1439\n01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:03,430\nadditional control, and monitoring\ncapabilities to the back end of the DMZ,\n\n1440\n01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:07,750\nso that we may allow different traffic\npatterns in from the internet coming in,\n\n1441\n01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,900\nmay have certain ports open\non that external firewall,\n\n1442\n01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:15,150\nmay have certain access controls\nfiltering that's taking place there.\n\n1443\n01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:19,480\nAnd then we may implement different\naccess control mechanisms on the internal\n\n1444\n01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,025\nfirewall.\n\n1445\n01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:25,960\nSo we may for instance, on the external\nfirewall allow certain ports to come in,\n\n1446\n01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,270\nbut we really can't do\nan IP address MAP or\n\n1447\n01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:32,380\na MAC address access control base\nscenario on the external firewall.\n\n1448\n01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:36,260\nUnless it's between dedicated branches\nright in some sort of a dedicated solution\n\n1449\n01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,520\nknown point-to-point,\n\n1450\n01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,680\nbecause we don't know what the origin\nof that traffic coming in is gonna be.\n\n1451\n01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,850\nBut on the internal firewall we do know\nwhat the origin of that traffic is gonna\n\n1452\n01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:48,310\nbe, and we could actually only allow\ninbound traffic, hypothetically let's say,\n\n1453\n01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:53,530\nfrom the web server inbound on\na dedicated IP address in port map so\n\n1454\n01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:58,010\nthat, that service on the web only\ncomes in with that origination point.\n\n1455\n01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:03,275\nWe don't allow external web traffic coming\nin on that IP address if it's not noted.\n\n1456\n01:11:03,275 --> 01:11:06,735\nSee there is different ways we can\nmanipulate the idea of the screening\n\n1457\n01:11:06,735 --> 01:11:09,920\nsub-net to be able to really\ncreate this defense in depth,\n\n1458\n01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,370\nthis layered approach that we want to make\nsure we're constantly thinking about.\n\n1459\n01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:16,325\n>> And\nyou see this with web services a lot.\n\n1460\n01:11:16,325 --> 01:11:18,440\nBecause most of us,\n\n1461\n01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,850\nwe browse the web you're obviously\nhitting a server to get that web page.\n\n1462\n01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:23,170\nBut the data-\n>> Destroying the magic.\n\n1463\n01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:24,480\n>> I know.\n\n1464\n01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,650\n>> Obviously doing it.\n\n1465\n01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:30,439\nI always thought up until just now,\nI'm crushed by the way,\n\n1466\n01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:32,158\nI'm crying on the inside.\n\n1467\n01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:34,263\nI always thought up until now that,\n\n1468\n01:11:34,263 --> 01:11:39,145\nthat just appeared magically because\nMicrosoft was the source of all knowledge.\n\n1469\n01:11:39,145 --> 01:11:40,168\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I didn't realize that.\n\n1470\n01:11:40,168 --> 01:11:44,935\n>> More often than not these days,\nit's not Microsoft involved unfortunately.\n\n1471\n01:11:44,935 --> 01:11:47,544\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so what we have is a website that's\n\n1472\n01:11:47,544 --> 01:11:51,372\ngenerating HTML, whatever,\nthe web code that you see.\n\n1473\n01:11:51,372 --> 01:11:55,637\nBut the data itself is being pulled or\nattracted from a database on the back end.\n\n1474\n01:11:55,637 --> 01:11:57,112\nThink like Amazon.com.\n\n1475\n01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:01,500\nWhen you go to Amazon's web page, yeah,\nyou're hitting a web server That web\n\n1476\n01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,293\nservers in turn pulling\nfrom a data base server and\n\n1477\n01:12:04,293 --> 01:12:07,770\nAmazon doesn't want you directly\naccessing that database.\n\n1478\n01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:10,710\nImagine what you could do if you had\naccess to the Amazon product data base,\n\n1479\n01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:12,184\neverything's on sale.\n\n1480\n01:12:12,184 --> 01:12:14,190\nWhat they do-\n>> Pennies for everybody.\n\n1481\n01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:17,110\n>> The database ends up\nbeing on a separate network,\n\n1482\n01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:20,000\nlike what we're seeing here,\na screened subnet ensuring that\n\n1483\n01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,600\nonly the web front ends can reach\nout to those database servers.\n\n1484\n01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,660\nAnd I'm sure they go even beyond that,\ndoing filters, as say, not just\n\n1485\n01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:31,600\nbasic network connectivity, but the web\nservers can only issue certain commands\n\n1486\n01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,220\nlike query commands and not update\ncommands or something of that nature.\n\n1487\n01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,690\nSo you can be very specific,\n\n1488\n01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:40,430\nvery restrictive with this to protect\nthese high risk machines, right?\n\n1489\n01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:43,510\nThis really does give you\nthe most power and control.\n\n1490\n01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:47,430\nExtra hardware costs right we gotta buy\ntwo firewalls, and so for a home user\n\n1491\n01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:51,000\nthat's not necessarily suitable, but for\na business especially if you're handling\n\n1492\n01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,278\ntransactions this is essential,\nI mean this is the model you follow.\n\n1493\n01:12:54,278 --> 01:12:54,938\n>> It is.\n\n1494\n01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:58,380\nNow also keep in mind, so\nlet's talk about does and\n\n1495\n01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:02,050\ndon't we talk about some good best\npractice thought processes around\n\n1496\n01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:07,190\nbuilding a secure enterprise grade as\nDon pointed out architecture here.\n\n1497\n01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:11,100\nSo kind of the standard we see this\nimplemented in most modern businesses\n\n1498\n01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:15,110\nespecially ones that have web\npresence as Don was indicating.\n\n1499\n01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:16,630\nWhat we don't often talk about and\n\n1500\n01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:19,790\nit's probably a good idea to mention\nit here is what kind of firewalls?\n\n1501\n01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:21,980\nAre they software based or hardware based?\n\n1502\n01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,008\nAnd are they from the same vendor or\nare they different vendor?\n\n1503\n01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:29,271\nBecause what often happens is,\nyou get a company that will say okay,\n\n1504\n01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:33,445\nwe're gonna buy some sort of gear,\nmaybe Cisco gear,\n\n1505\n01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:37,190\nmaybe it's gonna be a checkpoint firewall.\n\n1506\n01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:38,470\nDoesn't really matter what it is.\n\n1507\n01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:41,680\nWe're not talking about the efficacy of\nthe vendor, whether it's a good product or\n\n1508\n01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,530\nnot at all.\n\n1509\n01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:45,370\nWe're simply pointing out that they're\ngonna go to one vendor and say,\n\n1510\n01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:49,600\nI need firewalls, plural, and so they're\ngonna buy them from the same vendor.\n\n1511\n01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,238\nNow there's some value in that, right?\n\n1512\n01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:53,580\nBecause you're gonna get\nthe skill set internalized,\n\n1513\n01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:56,000\nyou're gonna get skilled up\non how to implement them,\n\n1514\n01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,990\nyou're gonna get the vendor probably\nto help you and implement properly.\n\n1515\n01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:02,945\nThe challenge is, you now are using,\nJuniper is better.\n\n1516\n01:14:02,945 --> 01:14:06,620\n[LAUGH] I thought we agreed there\nwas going to be no mention of\n\n1517\n01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,510\nour personal preferences here,\nbecause I have not mentioned the fact\n\n1518\n01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:13,340\nthat I think the Juniper is not\nas good but that's just me.\n\n1519\n01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,190\nRight.\n\n1520\n01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:15,750\nSo all kidding aside whatever it is.\n\n1521\n01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,770\nYou didn't make it flash, you should\nmake it flash while i was talking.\n\n1522\n01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,090\n>> I know blinking text\nwould have been perfect.\n\n1523\n01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:22,540\n>> So it could be Juniper\nas well whatever it is.\n\n1524\n01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:27,040\nSo the idea here would be that, it's great\nthat we can get that economy to scale.\n\n1525\n01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,231\nBuy wants, get a discount,\nimplement want's have the knowledge,\n\n1526\n01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:34,120\nthe stuff I just mentioned.\n\n1527\n01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,580\nBut here's a downside people\ndon't often think about.\n\n1528\n01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,730\nIf there is a fault, if there is a bug,\n\n1529\n01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:41,440\nif there is some sort of security issue,\nthen now we're\n\n1530\n01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:45,810\ndoubly liable because we effectively have\nit on both platforms simultaneously.\n\n1531\n01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:49,930\nAnd if we implement, what we tend to do\nis we tend to implement the same way.\n\n1532\n01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:54,690\nAnd so what often happens is, we configure\none, and we're human, we get lazy.\n\n1533\n01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:58,350\nWe take that configuration,\nwe spin it up on the second one and\n\n1534\n01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,500\nthen we may modify that configuration,\never so\n\n1535\n01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,530\nslightly to do some of the stuff\nwe discussed on the backend.\n\n1536\n01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:06,410\nBut we basically use\nthe same core configuration.\n\n1537\n01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:07,980\nAs a hacker, I love to see this.\n\n1538\n01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:12,020\nBecause what I know, when I probe your\nnetwork, and I find out you've got a dual\n\n1539\n01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:16,510\nhome or basically a screen subnet DMZ,\nwhat I bet more often than not and\n\n1540\n01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:19,510\nI'm right is, you get two of\nthe same firewalls sitting there.\n\n1541\n01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,210\nAnd they're probably\nconfigured the same way.\n\n1542\n01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:22,110\nAnd here is the trick.\n\n1543\n01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:23,410\nHere's what I'm really talking about.\n\n1544\n01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:26,280\nIt's not so much the config,\nbecause let's be honest there's only so\n\n1545\n01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,250\nmany ways to set up a configuration.\n\n1546\n01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:32,040\nIt's the username and\npassword that is often what is the same.\n\n1547\n01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,020\nAnd this is what kills you.\n\n1548\n01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,770\nWhat kills me when I put\non my good hacker hat,\n\n1549\n01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:39,800\nwhat I love to see when I turn around and\nbecome Evil Adam and\n\n1550\n01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:44,110\nI'm the bad hacker, which is, you use the\nsame user name and password to initialize,\n\n1551\n01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:48,040\nsetup, and create the config on the\nfirewall, so root access is now the same.\n\n1552\n01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,830\nI get one, I have both,\nand that is a big issue.\n\n1553\n01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:55,060\nSo if we use different vendors,\n\n1554\n01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,320\nwe typically are forced to\nuse different solutions.\n\n1555\n01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,350\nThat may or may not be a good thing.\n\n1556\n01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:03,570\nAlso, keep in mind that if there\nare weaknesses that are out there that\n\n1557\n01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,390\nwe researched,\nwe talked about vulnerability and\n\n1558\n01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:09,410\nthreat assessments in some of our earlier\nconversations in some other episodes.\n\n1559\n01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:12,840\nWe then, the downside to using\ndifferent vendors is we've gotta manage\n\n1560\n01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,320\ntwo sets of vulnerability lists.\n\n1561\n01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,470\nAnd we have patched two different\ntechnologies, and so there's pros and\n\n1562\n01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:18,980\ncons on both sides of this.\n\n1563\n01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:22,552\nBut you do need to understand\nthat if we use one vendor,\n\n1564\n01:16:22,552 --> 01:16:26,660\nwe do have to then make sure we use\na different username and a password for\n\n1565\n01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:29,960\neach of those devices to make\nsure they are truly secured.\n\n1566\n01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,530\nAnd if they're software based, and\n\n1567\n01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:35,880\na lot of people go with software firewalls\ntoday, they are cheaper than hardware and\n\n1568\n01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,730\nthey are usually easier to implement,\nbecause they have GUI interfaces and\n\n1569\n01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:43,300\nsome hardware devices until very recently\nhave been more command line than GUI.\n\n1570\n01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,440\nAlthough last few years almost\neverything has a web server of some\n\n1571\n01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,820\nkind and a GUI in it.\n\n1572\n01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:52,370\nBut today if you use software firewalls,\nagain, let me put on my bad hacker hat for\n\n1573\n01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:54,390\na minute, what I'm thinking is wow,\n\n1574\n01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,640\nyou just made it so much easier for me-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1575\n01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,160\n>> To break into your network\n\n1576\n01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,760\nbecause I don't even care\nwhat firewall you're running.\n\n1577\n01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,670\nI don't care if you have checkpoint\nimplemented as a software solution or\n\n1578\n01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:07,100\nnot, I don't care what it is,\nyou know what I care about?\n\n1579\n01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:10,850\nWhat's the underlying OS on that box and\nhow am I gonna crack that box and\n\n1580\n01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:11,630\nknock it over.\n\n1581\n01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:14,230\nBecause now all I have\nto do is hack Windows.\n\n1582\n01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:16,060\nRight, I don't have to hack your firewall.\n\n1583\n01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:16,980\nI just gotta hack Windows.\n\n1584\n01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:17,680\nBecause let's be honest,\n\n1585\n01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,930\nthat's probably where you're\nrunning your software firewall.\n\n1586\n01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:23,680\nIf you were confident enough to run\na software firewall in Linux, and\n\n1587\n01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,920\ndo it the right way, you probably would\nhave the skills to lock it down and\n\n1588\n01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,050\nreally understand it and\nprobably it's gonna be harder to get in.\n\n1589\n01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:34,360\nBut if you're doing it in Windows\nchances are good I'm willing to bet and\n\n1590\n01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,050\nI'm normally right when I do this.\n\n1591\n01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:38,180\nThat it's probably not\ngonna be managed very well.\n\n1592\n01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:42,200\nMeaning you probably haven't really\nstrip that box down to its bare essence.\n\n1593\n01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,790\nYou should be running that thing for\ninstance, right.\n\n1594\n01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:48,150\nIf you can figure out how to\ndo it with minimal services.\n\n1595\n01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:51,332\nYou may or not be able to run it on core\ndepending on the kind of firewall it\n\n1596\n01:17:51,332 --> 01:17:55,580\nis and whether they support implementation\nin a headless, non GUI environment or not.\n\n1597\n01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,120\nRight?\nBut if you can do it, run it on core.\n\n1598\n01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,470\nBecause now you've got a stripped down OS\nthat's really gonna have minimal footprint\n\n1599\n01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,590\nfor me to grab a hold of and\ntry to knock over.\n\n1600\n01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:07,750\nBut it's a lot easier for me to hack\na software solution than it is for\n\n1601\n01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,840\nme to hack a firewall\nthat is hardware-based.\n\n1602\n01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,780\n>> Yeah.\nIf you take like Linux,\n\n1603\n01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:17,050\nalmost every Linux distribution\nhas IP tables built-in.\n\n1604\n01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:21,240\nSo you can enable the routing process and\nyou can use it as the software firewall.\n\n1605\n01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,270\nBut you're responsible for\nsecuring that Linux OS, and\n\n1606\n01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,060\nyou can find dedicated\ndistributions out there.\n\n1607\n01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:30,450\nI mention, I used PF sense at home,\nwhich is built on top of free BSD.\n\n1608\n01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:31,770\nIt is very purpose driven.\n\n1609\n01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:35,040\nThey've stripped that distro down,\nto just have what's necessary for\n\n1610\n01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:35,820\nthe firewall pieces.\n\n1611\n01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,300\nSo it's not running.\n\n1612\n01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,780\nIt has no GUI whatsoever.\n\n1613\n01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,450\nIt doesn't have XServer on it or\nanything like that, and\n\n1614\n01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,850\nthat's the mistake people make.\n\n1615\n01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:47,030\nWhen they set up firewalls using\ngeneric OSs underneath Windows, Linux,\n\n1616\n01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:49,810\nwhatever, they install\nway more than they need,\n\n1617\n01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:51,595\nand with Windows a lot of\ntimes you don't have a choice.\n\n1618\n01:18:51,595 --> 01:18:52,950\n>> Very true, very true.\n\n1619\n01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:56,650\nSo just think about that as kind of\na best practice takeaway in this area.\n\n1620\n01:18:56,650 --> 01:19:00,130\nI wanna make sure we're not just\neducating you about how to be good\n\n1621\n01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:04,810\nsuccessful SSCPs from an exam standpoint\nand getting ready and certifying.\n\n1622\n01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:05,860\nIt's very important.\n\n1623\n01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:08,080\nBut it's only that first step on\nthe journey cuz now you gotta go out.\n\n1624\n01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,710\nYou gotta actually be\nproductive in the real world.\n\n1625\n01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:14,510\nYou gotta be able to bring value to the\nbusiness and hopefully create things and\n\n1626\n01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:17,340\nmake things more secure ultimately\nthan you found them, and\n\n1627\n01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:18,290\nleave them in a better state.\n\n1628\n01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:22,590\nAnd this is the kind of stuff we have\nto focus on in order to do that, right?\n\n1629\n01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:24,490\nAll right, so what's up next on our list?\n\n1630\n01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:25,220\nWhat else do we have?\n\n1631\n01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:28,240\n>> The only one, and we don't have a\ndiagram for this one, is proxy firewalls.\n\n1632\n01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:28,880\n>> Proxy firewalls.\n\n1633\n01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,830\nRight.\nSo proxy firewalls are simply gonna be\n\n1634\n01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:35,775\nthis idea of using a solution that,\nand actually let's go back up and\n\n1635\n01:19:35,775 --> 01:19:39,210\njust move up in our list there for\njust a second to the generations.\n\n1636\n01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:43,120\nSo you can see, we have a second gen,\nlike an application layer proxy solution.\n\n1637\n01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,900\nTypically is what were\ntalking about there.\n\n1638\n01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,610\nSo we're talking about a solution\nthat's effectively gonna communicate\n\n1639\n01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:50,680\nwith an untrusted host on our behalf.\n\n1640\n01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,624\nProxy in effect, says, hey Don,\nhold on, stay here for a minute,\n\n1641\n01:19:53,624 --> 01:19:54,826\nlet me go get what you need.\n\n1642\n01:19:54,826 --> 01:19:58,190\nAnd then it goes off and has\nthe conversation between the endpoint and\n\n1643\n01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:02,199\nthe firewall device, and then moves that\ninformation across a secure boundary.\n\n1644\n01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:06,173\nBack into the interior, back over\nto Don or whoever's requesting it,\n\n1645\n01:20:06,173 --> 01:20:07,380\non the back end.\n\n1646\n01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,740\nSo, just like a traditional proxy,\nthat's exactly how it's gonna work.\n\n1647\n01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:14,370\nSo the circuit level proxies operate\nat the session layer, as you can see,\n\n1648\n01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:16,910\nmeaning session layer of the OSI model.\n\n1649\n01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:21,050\nThe Application Level proxies, clearly at\nthe Application Level, of the OSI model.\n\n1650\n01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:22,280\nThe Application Layer, right?\n\n1651\n01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,870\nOr excuse me, of the OSI model.\n\n1652\n01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:28,170\nAnd when we think about\nApplication Layer proxies,\n\n1653\n01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:31,320\nwe think about things that are gonna\nbe implemented as programs.\n\n1654\n01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,990\nSo, we're thinking about or\nare at least implemented as software.\n\n1655\n01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:36,585\nWe're thinking about a WinSOCK proxy,\nfor instance, right?\n\n1656\n01:20:36,585 --> 01:20:37,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or a SOCKS proxy,\n\n1657\n01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:41,980\nmore generically, there may be a proxy for\na specific service.\n\n1658\n01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:45,500\nSo, we're gonna be seeing\nmultiple implementations of this\n\n1659\n01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,760\nbased on service or program or need.\n\n1660\n01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,340\nAs opposed to a generic\nfirewall that's just there,\n\n1661\n01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:53,100\ndoing a bunch of stuff at\na lower level of the OSI model.\n\n1662\n01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,130\n>> And those proxies they can be\ndeployed where they're very visible.\n\n1663\n01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,880\nIn order to get the internet, you've got\nto go into your internet options and\n\n1664\n01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,420\ndefine the proxies server used to get out.\n\n1665\n01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:04,950\nOr they might be transparent, you that\nwith a lot of Websense deployment.\n\n1666\n01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:06,710\n>> Stealthy Firewall.\n\n1667\n01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:09,560\n>> So, if you wanna filter people's\ninternet access, they're gonna websites\n\n1668\n01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:13,020\nand you wanna block certain sites, you can\ndeploy Websense in a transparent mode,\n\n1669\n01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,720\nit's invisible, and\nit is effectively a proxy.\n\n1670\n01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,660\nYou're actually hitting that Websense\nServer, it's getting the web page for\n\n1671\n01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,120\nyou if it approves.\n\n1672\n01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,670\nOr it's serving up a denial page.\n\n1673\n01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:24,515\nThose are kinda nice,\n\n1674\n01:21:24,515 --> 01:21:27,530\ncuz they don't have a configuration\nto maintain on the client side.\n\n1675\n01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:28,150\n>> Absolutely.\nSo,\n\n1676\n01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,480\na funny little aside\nhere about denial pages.\n\n1677\n01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,660\nI do a lot of work for a lot of different\ncustomers, and around the country,\n\n1678\n01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:37,110\nand even internationally at some points.\n\n1679\n01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:41,490\nSo, I did work for\na customer several years back,\n\n1680\n01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:43,900\nthat was very big in their industry.\n\n1681\n01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:47,350\nYou would know the name if I\ntold you who the company was,\n\n1682\n01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:48,500\nyou would recognize, anyway.\n\n1683\n01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,780\nIt's very big, very successful company.\n\n1684\n01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:56,400\nBut they were doing something like\nWebsense, a customized proxy solution.\n\n1685\n01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,680\nAnd so for web surfing,\nwhat they had to do was,\n\n1686\n01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:05,150\nthey had to filter web access for\ncertain departments, because they had\n\n1687\n01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:09,320\na lot of sponsorships of sports teams and\nthings like that going on, right?\n\n1688\n01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,780\nSo, their marketing department had\nto be able to get out and look at.\n\n1689\n01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:16,740\nThis streaming stuff coming in from\nESPN to see how the team is doing.\n\n1690\n01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:18,850\nCheck product placement,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n1691\n01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,840\nBut, the rest of company\nwasn't able to get that stuff.\n\n1692\n01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,840\nThey weren't able to watch the race\nin real time, or anything like that.\n\n1693\n01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,810\nAnd so, they set up basically\na denial of service page,\n\n1694\n01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:32,450\n404 you can't get that content page,\nbut they had it with the company logo.\n\n1695\n01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:34,640\nAnd so, when it would come up\nit wasn't just a generic page.\n\n1696\n01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,900\nIt would be the company logo, right?\n\n1697\n01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,430\nOr the company mascot.\n\n1698\n01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:43,620\nAnd it was holding a red stop\nsign with a traffic hat on it and\n\n1699\n01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,760\na little whistle and basically, stop!\n\n1700\n01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:46,930\nYou can't go there, kind of thing.\n\n1701\n01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:47,750\nSo it's kinda interesting.\n\n1702\n01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:48,755\nIt was just really cool.\n\n1703\n01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:51,270\nCuz the way you can do this stuff,\ncould be a little tounge-in-cheek,\n\n1704\n01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:53,390\nto get people used to the idea\nthat you're doing it.\n\n1705\n01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:56,120\nThey didn't wanna hide the fact,\nto your point, that they were filtering.\n\n1706\n01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,420\nThey made it very clear.\n\n1707\n01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,750\nBut, they wanted to do it in a way\nthat brought everybody back, and\n\n1708\n01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:00,570\nkind of branded them.\n\n1709\n01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:03,270\nAnd said this is why you're\nnot supposed to do it?\n\n1710\n01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:06,360\nAnd so, this brings up this idea\nof nap and knack very quickly.\n\n1711\n01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,040\nThis is a conceptual idea.\n\n1712\n01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:12,710\nNetwork access protection,\nnetwork access control.\n\n1713\n01:23:12,710 --> 01:23:15,520\nIt is referred to different\nways by different vendors,\n\n1714\n01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:20,290\nthis is really more of a marketing\nconcept, than it is a technology concept,\n\n1715\n01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:23,180\nbecause at the end of the day\nit is basically the same thing.\n\n1716\n01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:28,980\nSo, if you go with a Cisco like model or\na Cisco solution, you're looking at NAC.\n\n1717\n01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,340\nIf you're looking at something,\nfor instance,\n\n1718\n01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:33,940\nMicrosoft's solution is referred\nto as Network Access Protection.\n\n1719\n01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:37,590\nIt doesn't really matter who makes it,\nand what we're talking about?\n\n1720\n01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:41,380\nThe idea here generically is we're doing\nnetwork connection enforcement, right?\n\n1721\n01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:45,870\nSo we are looking at that session,\ninterdicting, proxying in effect,\n\n1722\n01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:49,660\nfiguring out what is happening,\nwhat are you looking to do, and\n\n1723\n01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:51,450\nthen isolating you in a DMZ?\n\n1724\n01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:55,240\nAnd above all, to verify that you have\nthe right to go do what you wanna,\n\n1725\n01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,460\nand that you are configured the right way.\n\n1726\n01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:01,680\nTo get in or out, and go do what you\nwanna do before we let you through.\n\n1727\n01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,945\nSo we can do network health checks, or\nnetwork health status here, and we can\n\n1728\n01:24:05,945 --> 01:24:11,920\nre-mediate and baseline machines and patch\nthem as part of a NAC or a NAP process.\n\n1729\n01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,110\nSo, it's actually some very\ninteresting technology, and\n\n1730\n01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:17,050\nwe think about the use of\nthe screen subnet and the DMZ.\n\n1731\n01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:19,720\nWhen we add this capability\nonto the firewall, and\n\n1732\n01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:24,400\nwe add this technology in, all of a sudden\nwe're now really creating a solution\n\n1733\n01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,250\nthat not just lets us understand\ntraffic and authenticate.\n\n1734\n01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:32,060\nBut, really lets us create a standard\nbaseline for service provisioning, right?\n\n1735\n01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:35,410\nBecause every system has to meet this\ncriteria, or we don't let it through.\n\n1736\n01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,600\nIt's actually pretty interesting.\n\n1737\n01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,440\n>> Yeah, and the real power with these,\nwell what I like,\n\n1738\n01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,750\nare the remediation networks, that if\nyou define some kind of rule that says,\n\n1739\n01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,850\nif somebody wants to\nconnect to our network.\n\n1740\n01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:46,300\nIt's got to be a company-issued laptop, so\n\n1741\n01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,930\nit's got to have a certificate attached\nto it that guarantees its identity.\n\n1742\n01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:53,970\nAnd then, it also has to have antivirus\ndefinitions that have been updated in\n\n1743\n01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:55,000\nthe last three days.\n\n1744\n01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,280\nAnd a virus scan,\n\n1745\n01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,950\na full scan that's been performed\nin the last seven days, all right?\n\n1746\n01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:01,870\nSo you can configure these,\nNAP and NAP, they can both do it.\n\n1747\n01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:04,710\nWhere, when somebody plugs that laptop in,\nit runs these checks.\n\n1748\n01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:06,020\nIf there's no certificate.\n\n1749\n01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,920\nit blocks it,\ndoesn't allow it on the network.\n\n1750\n01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,430\nIf it has a certificate, it checks\nto see if it's healthy, if it isn't,\n\n1751\n01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:15,620\nit doesn't just block it, it says all\nright, I'll give you limited connectivity.\n\n1752\n01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:19,330\nSo that you can download virus definition\nupdates, so you can run your scan, and\n\n1753\n01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:22,230\nit re-mediates, it give it a chance to\nbecome healthy, and when it's healthy,\n\n1754\n01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:25,620\nit automatically moves it on the network,\nvery cool stuff.\n\n1755\n01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,410\nIt takes a lot of infrastructure\nto set something up like this, and\n\n1756\n01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:29,390\na lot of money.\n\n1757\n01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:34,480\nI don't know, I've deployed NAP in lab,\nand test environments, not in production.\n\n1758\n01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,909\nI've done NAC in Production Cisco Systems.\n\n1759\n01:25:36,909 --> 01:25:40,601\nAnd the cheapest NAC installation.\n\n1760\n01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:41,576\n>> Five figures\n>> Yeah, I mean-\n\n1761\n01:25:41,576 --> 01:25:42,270\n>> Five figures.\n\n1762\n01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,810\n>> It was, I know it was like\n50 grand in just equipment, and\n\n1763\n01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:48,710\nthen on top of that you start to get\ninto consulting fees and all that, so\n\n1764\n01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,330\nit gets really expensive really fast.\n\n1765\n01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:52,540\n>> And what people often miss there\nare the soft costs with that,\n\n1766\n01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:55,255\nwhich is the fact that you then\nhave to train people to manage it.\n\n1767\n01:25:55,255 --> 01:25:56,802\nSo, building it's one thing, right?\n\n1768\n01:25:56,802 --> 01:26:00,570\nI mean, building it's tough, and\nyou can get it up and running, but\n\n1769\n01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,660\nthen you get to walk away.\n\n1770\n01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,980\nYou don't [LAUGH] have to\nworry about it day-to-day.\n\n1771\n01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,910\n>> Right, so when I get called in to help\nfigure that stuff out, we build something,\n\n1772\n01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:09,340\nwe're okay, here you go.\n\n1773\n01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,150\nGood luck.\n[LAUGH] Call us when you have\n\n1774\n01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:12,350\nanother question.\n\n1775\n01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:17,620\nAnd if you are either doing\n[COUGH] service based solutions,\n\n1776\n01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:20,780\nwhere you're coming back and\nhave that recurring generation of revenue\n\n1777\n01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,200\nbased on support,\nright that's what you want.\n\n1778\n01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,940\nBut, if you're gonna turn it internal, and\n\n1779\n01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:28,760\ntake it over from the vendor as a black\nbox, or hopefully not a total black box.\n\n1780\n01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,560\nYou've got to document everything,\nand now you've got to go out and\n\n1781\n01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,130\ntrain your staff on how to do it?\n\n1782\n01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:35,900\nSo, when I say a five figure solution,\nwe're really talking about probably\n\n1783\n01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:38,690\na $100,000 minimum,\nbecause you got to factor in the time,\n\n1784\n01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:41,320\nand the soft cost as well\nas the hard cost of money.\n\n1785\n01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,880\nTo acquire, build, and then manage and\noperate through a life cycle, and\n\n1786\n01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,540\nthis stuff can get very\nexpensive very quickly.\n\n1787\n01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:50,240\nI don't think I've ever seen\na solution in production.\n\n1788\n01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,050\nFirst of all, a company has to be big\nenough to want this, so you've got to\n\n1789\n01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:56,230\nbe a company that's got thee or four\ndifferent geos that you wanna link right?\n\n1790\n01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:58,710\nBecause if you're one little\ncompany in one little area,\n\n1791\n01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,182\nyou really don't need\na solution like this.\n\n1792\n01:27:00,182 --> 01:27:01,940\nYou just don't have this kinda need.\n\n1793\n01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,930\nSo, if you've got that\nkind of infrastructure,\n\n1794\n01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:08,140\nyou're spending this kind of money on\na yearly basis to maintain it regardless.\n\n1795\n01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,260\nThis is just an add on to your portfolio.\n\n1796\n01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:13,820\nBut, you're gonna spend at\nleast five figures minimum to\n\n1797\n01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:16,060\nstand up a solution like this and\nget a 100th hour.\n\n1798\n01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:17,321\nSix figure I guess I should say, right?\n\n1799\n01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:19,443\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A six figure, a $100,000 or more.\n\n1800\n01:27:19,443 --> 01:27:21,035\nIt's five figures just on the acquisition.\n\n1801\n01:27:21,035 --> 01:27:22,420\nBut, it's six figures overall.\n\n1802\n01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:23,800\nWhen you factor in the soft costs.\n\n1803\n01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,350\nAnd remember, from our prior discussion,\n\n1804\n01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:28,500\nwe would call those qualitative\nversus quantitative measures.\n\n1805\n01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, so,\n\n1806\n01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,610\nquantitative metrics, dollars.\n\n1807\n01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:33,770\nAnd then qualitative, the idea that\nwe can measure other stuff, right?\n\n1808\n01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:38,280\nAnd some of that soft costs around human\ncapital hours, would potentially be soft.\n\n1809\n01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,380\n>> Great point.\n\n1810\n01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:41,290\nIf we go back to thinking about risk,\n\n1811\n01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:43,330\nwhich we've talked about\nin an earlier episode.\n\n1812\n01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:47,358\nWhen we talk about the cost of this kind\nof equipment, it's easy to balk at it.\n\n1813\n01:27:47,358 --> 01:27:49,569\nYou say, $50,000, that's it's crazy, but\n\n1814\n01:27:49,569 --> 01:27:52,033\nyou need to think of the risk\nthat it's mitigating, right?\n\n1815\n01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:56,009\nSo, if a compromised machine got on\nyour network, if some of your private\n\n1816\n01:27:56,009 --> 01:28:00,258\nintellectual property got out on the\nnetwork, what would the cost of that be?\n\n1817\n01:28:00,258 --> 01:28:01,013\nRight?\n\n1818\n01:28:01,013 --> 01:28:04,285\nSo, if it costs $50,000 to implement this,\nbut\n\n1819\n01:28:04,285 --> 01:28:07,000\nit saved you from\na million dollar liability,\n\n1820\n01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:12,590\n$50,000 as opposed to a million that's\na big difference, it's worth it to do it.\n\n1821\n01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:17,180\nSo you need to gauge your solution\nbased on the sensitivity of your data.\n\n1822\n01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:20,590\nI know we made fun of my home\nnetwork not being terribly secure.\n\n1823\n01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:22,490\nI don't have any sensitive data at home.\n\n1824\n01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:25,870\nIf somebody breaks into my home network\nthey can get our family photos.\n\n1825\n01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:26,990\nIt's not that big of a deal.\n\n1826\n01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:29,872\nMost of them are on, surely my wife put\nthem on Facebook or something anyway.\n\n1827\n01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:33,938\nSo they're out there but\nif I'm at a doctor's office,\n\n1828\n01:28:33,938 --> 01:28:38,240\nmaybe even a small doctor's office,\nten employees.\n\n1829\n01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,090\nIf I'm handling medical records,\n\n1830\n01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:42,800\nthere's a huge liability if\nthat data gets out, right?\n\n1831\n01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,810\nSo it becomes worth it to\nincur these expenditures\n\n1832\n01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:47,590\nto guarantee you don't\nhave that compromise.\n\n1833\n01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:48,820\n>> There is.\nWe have a formula for that.\n\n1834\n01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:50,470\nIf you remember, we talked about this.\n\n1835\n01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:53,120\nSince we reached back into the vault,\nso to speak,\n\n1836\n01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,690\nand brought forward this idea, let's\njust throw that out there real quick.\n\n1837\n01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:59,310\nSo this would have been a quick\nknowledge check for you,\n\n1838\n01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:00,340\nif you're thinking about it.\n\n1839\n01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,350\nYou've already got it in your head and\n\n1840\n01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:03,200\nhopefully you've kind of\nbrought that forward.\n\n1841\n01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,900\nWe were talking about this\nidea of how we assess risk and\n\n1842\n01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,570\nwhat we would look at in terms\nof a cost of a countermeasure.\n\n1843\n01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:11,200\nSo the formula would\nhave three parts to it.\n\n1844\n01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,180\nRight?\nWe would talk\n\n1845\n01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,120\nabout annualized loss expectancy,\nwhat we call ALE.\n\n1846\n01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:19,770\nAnd ALE, annualized loss expectancy,\nwould be made of the two components.\n\n1847\n01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:22,485\nSo ALE would equal, in our formula, SLE.\n\n1848\n01:29:22,485 --> 01:29:28,000\nS-L-E, single loss expectancy,\ntimes ARO, annual rate of occurrence.\n\n1849\n01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,590\nAnd so when we see the formula\nALE equals SLE times ARO,\n\n1850\n01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:34,560\nwhat were thinking about is, it costs us\nthis million dollar liability that Don was\n\n1851\n01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,000\ntalking about if our information\ngot exposed one time.\n\n1852\n01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,240\nCountermeasure, single loss expectancy,\nwhat would it cost?\n\n1853\n01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:44,160\nOr what would it cost a for\nsingle loss expectancy, excuse me.\n\n1854\n01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,265\nThat would be a $1 million liability,\nright?\n\n1855\n01:29:47,265 --> 01:29:50,130\nAnnual rate of occurrence\nwould have been one time, so\n\n1856\n01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:52,040\nit would cost $1 million one time.\n\n1857\n01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,317\nSo as a result of that,\nwe can begin to figure out,\n\n1858\n01:29:54,317 --> 01:29:57,376\nis that $50,000 safeguard\nreally gonna make sense or not.\n\n1859\n01:29:57,376 --> 01:29:59,229\nAnd so think about these concepts and\n\n1860\n01:29:59,229 --> 01:30:03,233\nwhen you see these conversation topics\ncome up again or hear them come up again,\n\n1861\n01:30:03,233 --> 01:30:07,416\nyou reach back like we do and we're trying\nto bring that knowledge forward for you,\n\n1862\n01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:11,305\nsprinkle it liberally throughout our\ndiscussions in various topic areas and\n\n1863\n01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:14,832\nvarious episodes to make sure that\nit's really making sense to you and\n\n1864\n01:30:14,832 --> 01:30:17,470\nthat you're seeing that\nit's a web of knowledge.\n\n1865\n01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:20,800\nWe're kinda creating these linkages\nwe're connecting to all these theories,\n\n1866\n01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,390\nthese concepts,\n\n1867\n01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:26,600\nthese terms because they really play well\nin any one of these knowledge areas.\n\n1868\n01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,290\nRisk is not just in the risk\ndomain in other words, right?\n\n1869\n01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,160\nWe deal with risk in everything we do.\n\n1870\n01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,420\nSo we see it all over the place.\n\n1871\n01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:34,470\nWanna make sure you're\ncomfortable with that as well.\n\n1872\n01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:38,135\n>> Well speaking of ALE, Adam, why don't\nwe wrap it up here and go get some brews?\n\n1873\n01:30:38,135 --> 01:30:39,670\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n1874\n01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,680\n>> All right, we still have a lot\nmore to get into on networking.\n\n1875\n01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,460\nWe're gonna bump it off into\na networking part three episode,\n\n1876\n01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:48,140\ncuz it's far too much to get through here.\n\n1877\n01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:50,160\n>> Cuz part three's so\nmuch better than part two.\n\n1878\n01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:53,650\n>> I tell you, part three is usually\nwhen the trilogy wraps up, right?\n\n1879\n01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:55,130\nAnd you get the exciting conclusion.\n\n1880\n01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:56,399\n>> That might be part four though.\n\n1881\n01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:57,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll see how that goes.\n\n1882\n01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,530\nThis might be a four parter show.\n\n1883\n01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:00,430\n>> Are we gonna milk it\nlike the Die Hard series?\n\n1884\n01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:01,309\nJust keep turning out episodes.\n\n1885\n01:31:01,309 --> 01:31:04,460\n>> We are, we are.\n>> So anyway, we'll wrap it up here.\n\n1886\n01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,420\nI hope you guys enjoyed the

00:00:40,140\nI'm Mike Roderick and\ntoday with me is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n4\n00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,980\n>> That would be me.\n\n5\n00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,860\n>> Yeah, and we're gonna be diving\nback into our networking section and\n\n6\n00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,102\nwe're hitting Networking part 3.\n\n7\n00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:46,600\nWe're gonna hit some protocols and\n\n8\n00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,760\nsome port numbers and\nother good stuff that we just got know.\n\n9\n00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,100\n>> Absolutely, yeah, we gotta know it all.\n\n10\n00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,400\nThat's the stuff we gotta do.\n\n11\n00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,570\nAll right, let's jump in.\n\n12\n00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,270\nLet's talk a bit about, since you\nmentioned protocols and port numbers,\n\n13\n00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,280\nlet's talk about those and what they are.\n\n14\n00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,440\nSo I know we had a little list\nwe put together for you guys.\n\n15\n00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,372\nAnd we'll put those up on the screen for\nyou.\n\n16\n00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:10,400\nYou wanna start off by talking about\nwhat the different port numbers are and\n\n17\n00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,700\nspecifically the overall range.\n\n18\n00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,460\nAnd then we want to break it down for\n\n19\n00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,950\nyou, just make sure you know how we\nrefer to these different areas, right.\n\n20\n00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,678\nSo overall any machine that is running\na network stack, in other words anything\n\n21\n00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:26,265\nthat has an operating system on it that\nruns a network TCP IP network stack in it\n\n22\n00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:31,585\nWe're gonna have virtually the ability\nto create, bind to and use 65,535 ports.\n\n23\n00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:33,088\nQuite a few, right.\n\n24\n00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:35,591\nSo if you looked on the back\nof your machine and looked for\n\n25\n00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:39,280\nall of those pinholes [LAUGH] you can plug\ninto, you'd have a bit of counting to do.\n\n26\n00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,100\nThey are virtual, they're not physical.\n\n27\n00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,890\nActually had somebody\nask me once in class, so\n\n28\n00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,630\nexactly where do I find all those ports,\nhow do I connect to them?\n\n29\n00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,890\nAre they there somewhere?\n\n30\n00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,535\nJust keep looking,\nkeep looking back there, you'll find them.\n\n31\n00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:50,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n32\n00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,820\nwe say from zero to six 5,000\nis that full port range.\n\n33\n00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,638\nObviously we don't set anything to port\nzero, so it's really from one to 65,535.\n\n34\n00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:03,459\nBut from one to 1,023 are what\nwe call well known ports, and so\n\n35\n00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:06,840\nthose well known ports\nare gonna be the first 1,023.\n\n36\n00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,490\nSo a lot of the protocol Port\nassociations that we think of,\n\n37\n00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,550\nlike HTTP that we use almost\nubiquitously all the time.\n\n38\n00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,440\nCertainly SMTP, DNS, FTP, etc.\n\n39\n00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,540\nMost if not all of them are gonna\nshow up in the well known ports,\n\n40\n00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,910\nin the first 1,023.\n\n41\n00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,160\nSo, we will have a list for\n\n42\n00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,170\nyou in a little while of some of the ones\nyou probably wanna be paying attention to.\n\n43\n00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,970\nJust making sure you're conversing\nwith as you look to prepare to\n\n44\n00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,810\nanswer some questions.\n\n45\n00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,370\nSo, we'll put those together for you and\nwe have them up in the notes here.\n\n46\n00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,275\nOut beyond 1023, when we start with 1024,\nwe go up to 49,152 1,151,\n\n47\n00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:45,405\nwe have what are known\nas the registered ports.\n\n48\n00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:48,675\nSo these are ports that are going\nto be allocated to a service or\n\n49\n00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:52,565\nto a company that runs various\nservices associated with software.\n\n50\n00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:55,390\nBut they're not well known, meaning\nwe don't tend to use them as often.\n\n51\n00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,700\nYou may use them a lot but you may not\nuse them for a variety of things but\n\n52\n00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,030\nthey are dedicated and hard wired\nin the sense that you run a program\n\n53\n00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,210\non that port number it is gonna be\nbased on whatever's registered there.\n\n54\n00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,070\nYou can go out and\n\n55\n00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,090\nsay I wanna run this particular piece\nof software that we are building.\n\n56\n00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,070\nOn one of these ports, but\n\n57\n00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,810\nnormally what we will find on these ports\nare things that are registered with IANA,\n\n58\n00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,050\nwhich is going to be the port\nregistration administration network.\n\n59\n00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,280\nSo the Internet Assigned Number Authority\nis what IANA stands for.\n\n60\n00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,421\nAnd that is the group that tracks\nall these port registrations,\n\n61\n00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:31,212\nassigns a port to a company or an entity\nor a service and then keeps track of it.\n\n62\n00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,209\nSo that's something that we'll find there.\n\n63\n00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,847\nAnd then 49,152 out through\nthe end of 65,535 will be dynamic\n\n64\n00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:41,512\nports that are assigned on\na basically as-needed basis,\n\n65\n00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:45,500\nfirst-come, first-served kind\nof thing within a network.\n\n66\n00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,130\nAnd we can map to those and use those\npretty much on demand if we choose to.\n\n67\n00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,790\nSo, just wanna be aware of that and\n\n68\n00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,830\nmake sure we're comfortable with\nthat thought process as we begin to\n\n69\n00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,340\ndrill in and start talking about protocols\nbecause obviously we're then gonna\n\n70\n00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,400\nstart mapping some of these protocols and\nthe functions that they have.\n\n71\n00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,760\nOver to some of these ports for us.\n\n72\n00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,030\nAnd so, as we start talking about network\nprotocols, what we're gonna do is\n\n73\n00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,280\nwe've got a short list of ones there that\nyou're probably going to want to focus on.\n\n74\n00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,220\nWe then break those out into some\nrouting protocols down below,\n\n75\n00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,540\ninterior versus exterior.\n\n76\n00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,600\nSo we'll talk through that and\nthat whole thought process as well.\n\n77\n00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,230\nSome of these you're probably gonna know,\nand I'm sure, hopefully,\n\n78\n00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,680\nyou're conversing with already.\n\n79\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,120\nSo IP, TCP, as in TCP-IP, is something\nthat we hopefully are familiar with.\n\n80\n00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,810\nWe talked in one of our prior episodes.\n\n81\n00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,670\nI think you actually were the one\nwho through it on the table for us,\n\n82\n00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,250\nthat it's actually a suite of protocols,\nutilities, and\n\n83\n00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,868\nthings that are coming together in\norder to create that functionality.\n\n84\n00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,520\nSo we wanna make sure we're familiar\nwith that, we'll talk about the layer of\n\n85\n00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,070\nthe Osine model that that maps to there\nas well and maybe the Touchpoint force.\n\n86\n00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,520\nSo let's start with,\nlet's start with IP, right.\n\n87\n00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,990\nSo, IP internet protocol, we're gonna\nsee that at which layer, right,\n\n88\n00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,305\nlet's maybe make pick our studio audience,\nthrow out some information to us.\n\n89\n00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:54,866\n>> Remember that OSI model we looked at?\n\n90\n00:04:54,866 --> 00:05:01,017\n>> We did, so I don't know if anyone\nthere might want to jump into the chat\n\n91\n00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:06,875\nreal quick and throw out what layer\nof the OSI we may be looking for.\n\n92\n00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,985\nI don't know if anybody out there\nwants to take a stab at that.\n\n93\n00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:12,355\nIf not, we'll throw it up there for\nyou in just a second.\n\n94\n00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,930\nWhat we want to try to get you to do,\n\n95\n00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,890\nis be thinking about these connections\npoints as we go through this material.\n\n96\n00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,500\nSo when we reach backwards, and pull\nsomething out, like what is the OSI model.\n\n97\n00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,930\nAnd what specifically is\nthat layer that we work at?\n\n98\n00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,010\nWe're trying to make that connection for\nyou knowledge wise.\n\n99\n00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,970\nTo make sure it's substantiated in there.\n\n100\n00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,860\nYou got the mind and the gears\nspinning there to make sure you know.\n\n101\n00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,130\nSo I see we got layer four,\nsomebody was throwing out there for\n\n102\n00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,490\nus if I'm not mistaken, right?\n\n103\n00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,100\n>> Yes it's close.\n\n104\n00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,420\n>> It is close, but we're actually\ngoing to be one layer above or below.\n\n105\n00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,400\nWhich way are we going Mike?\n\n106\n00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,510\n>> I think we're going\nto go down from there.\n\n107\n00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,170\n>> Down one layer.\n\n108\n00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,010\nSo we're going to layer three,\nThree, right?\n\n109\n00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,500\nTake the elevator down one layer.\n\n110\n00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,960\nInternet protocol IP is a routed protocol,\nand\n\n111\n00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,750\nis gonna be dealt with by\na routing device, a router.\n\n112\n00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,410\nHardware based,\nworks at layer three of the OSI model, and\n\n113\n00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,010\nfocuses on IP addresses in their Mac or\nexcuse me in their Mac address.\n\n114\n00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,210\nFocus on IP addresses in their\nrouting table now there's a layer\n\n115\n00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,170\nthree device where we find\nIP as a protocol will be at\n\n116\n00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,830\nlayer three\n>> And\n\n117\n00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,460\nthat's how I always remember I\nstart thinking about that model and\n\n118\n00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,480\nI remember that that first layer that\nphysical layer right and you're talking\n\n119\n00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,130\nabout the actual electricity going back\nand forth and then you're next layer up.\n\n120\n00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,950\nYour data link layer you're\nhitting your MAC address is there.\n\n121\n00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,300\nAnd then the next one up from that\nyou're getting a little more detail,\n\n122\n00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,880\nyou're getting further\ninto the packet header.\n\n123\n00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,800\nAnd now you're looking at that IP address.\n\n124\n00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120\nSo, we can route it between networks.\n\n125\n00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,630\nSo that's how I always remember that\nthat IP is working at that layer 3.\n\n126\n00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,400\n>> Absolutely, and\nthen TCP will be up at layer four.\n\n127\n00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,530\nSo we got layer four as an answer and\nwe'll give you credit for that,\n\n128\n00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,560\ncuz I'm gonna assume you were referring\nto both layer three and layer four,\n\n129\n00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,090\nanswering the question overall.\n\n130\n00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,370\nAnd we certainly will see TCP at layer\nfour, right at the transport layer, but\n\n131\n00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,960\nwe're gonna see IP at layer\nthree at the network layer.\n\n132\n00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,460\nWe have the TCP wrapper,\nas it is referred to often,\n\n133\n00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,710\nwhich wraps around the IP package,\nwraps around that and\n\n134\n00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,630\nbinds to it, and\nworks with it as part of our solution.\n\n135\n00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,360\nSo, transmission control protocol\nis what we see TCP as being.\n\n136\n00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,650\nWe see that as a layer four solution.\n\n137\n00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,570\n>> Right.\n>> We have PPP, point to point protocol.\n\n138\n00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,750\nIt's gonna be one of the early\nprotocols that was used to create\n\n139\n00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,702\ndedicated point to point connections.\n\n140\n00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,920\n>> Right.\n>> Right, so\n\n141\n00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,920\nwe've talked a little bit about PPP/POE\nin one of our prior episodes and\n\n142\n00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,780\nwe'll talk more about some of the\ntunneling protocols in one the upcoming\n\n143\n00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,280\nepisodes where we talk\nabout layer two tunneling.\n\n144\n00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,890\nTalk about ITSEC.\n\n145\n00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,420\nSome of those protocols So\nPPP is point to point.\n\n146\n00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,540\nWe have DNS which is not a protocol but\nis actually a network service.\n\n147\n00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,810\nRight, so we throw down this list\nbecause the Domain Name System\n\n148\n00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,480\nis gonna be something we\nneed to be thinking about.\n\n149\n00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,060\nWe have BOOTP and\nDHCP down there at the bottom.\n\n150\n00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,190\nWhich is part of the other side\nof that network service solution.\n\n151\n00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,248\nAnd so we do ascribe DNS to a port and\nwe do make sure we\n\n152\n00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:57,852\nunderstand it is very important to\nus in terms of name resolution.\n\n153\n00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,423\nSo that's gonna be something\nyou want to throw out there.\n\n154\n00:07:58,423 --> 00:08:00,670\nUDP, user datagram protocol.\n\n155\n00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,197\n>> This the kind of mirror\nflipped image of TCP, right?\n\n156\n00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,600\n>> Right.\n\n157\n00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,950\n>> TCP is our connection\noriented protocol.\n\n158\n00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,400\nSend and\nacknowledges we often refer to it.\n\n159\n00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,920\nSo we have the three way handshake,\nthe cin, sinach,\n\n160\n00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,300\nact which is the three way handshake.\n\n161\n00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,370\nAnd with UDP we have send and forget.\n\n162\n00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,050\nWe basically are streaming\ncontent out there.\n\n163\n00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,820\nWe are gonna keep sending\ndata packets down the wire.\n\n164\n00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,780\nAnd if we lose one or don't acknowledge\nthe acceptance and the delivery of one,\n\n165\n00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,600\nwe just keep going.\n\n166\n00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,710\n>> Right.\n>> In fact it's up to the end user who's\n\n167\n00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,320\ngetting that, typically the end point\nwhich is, maybe a streaming media server,\n\n168\n00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,270\nwhatever it may be.\n\n169\n00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,870\nBut sending it out,\nit's up to the end point in the browser or\n\n170\n00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,230\nwhatever it is to say, hey, I didn't get\nsomething and then request the resend.\n\n171\n00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,930\nWe don't do it automatically.\n\n172\n00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,360\nSo we have ARP,\nthe address to our solution protocol.\n\n173\n00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,140\nWe put RARP in brackets there,\n\n174\n00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,460\nreverse ARP, which is just gonna\nremind us that ARP is going to be\n\n175\n00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,150\none of those things like IP addresses,\nwhich we can do through DNS resolution.\n\n176\n00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,480\nEither forwards or backwards.\n\n177\n00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,030\nWhen we think about the fact that\nwhen we do an IP address and\n\n178\n00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,280\nDNS name resolution, we do a fully\nqualified domain name, right.\n\n179\n00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,090\nOr a host name to an IP address or\nvice versa.\n\n180\n00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,807\nDepending on whether it's a forward or\nreverse look-up.\n\n181\n00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:06,781\n[CROSSTALK] And so\nwe think about something similar with ARP.\n\n182\n00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:10,429\nWhere we're thinking about whether\nwe're doing, in effect, a forward or\n\n183\n00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:12,140\na reverse resolution, right.\n\n184\n00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,490\nBut we're doing, instead of an IP address\nto a fully-qualified domain name or\n\n185\n00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,570\na host name, we're doing it to a-\n>> A MAC address.\n\n186\n00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,560\n>> A Mac address.\n\n187\n00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,488\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n188\n00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:22,690\nSo we wanna just make sure we're\nthinking about ARP and reverse ARP.\n\n189\n00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,640\nIGMP, the interior gateway,\nor interior group rather.\n\n190\n00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,610\nLet me try that again,\ninternet group management protocol.\n\n191\n00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,880\nI got interior routing\non the brain right now.\n\n192\n00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,870\nInternet group management protocol, IGMP.\n\n193\n00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,390\nSo we have IGMP and this is gonna be\nsome protocol structure functionality.\n\n194\n00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,860\nThings that we're gonna think about and\n\n195\n00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,490\ntalk about in relation to,\nwhat do we think of IGMP?\n\n196\n00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,890\n>> Multicasting\n>> We could think of that, we could think\n\n197\n00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,800\nof perhaps also, let me think of\nsomething else we can throw on there,\n\n198\n00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,720\nperhaps we also want to think about\n\n199\n00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,670\nsomething we would actually subscribe\nto or become a group member of,\n\n200\n00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,960\nso maybe it is gonna be,\n>> The video conference type thing,\n\n201\n00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,510\nor not quite that?\n\n202\n00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,170\n>> Not quite that,\nmaybe something more along the lines of,\n\n203\n00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,787\nI'm having a moment, I can't think of\nsomething that would be a good example.\n\n204\n00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:21,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, let's just leave it off to the side\n\n205\n00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,310\nfor a moment, we'll come back to it.\n\n206\n00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,030\nI'm just trying to come up with something\nthat we could throw out there as\n\n207\n00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,560\nan example.\n\n208\n00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,600\nBut, we have the protocol and\nobviously thinking through that.\n\n209\n00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240\nWe at least came up with one.\n\n210\n00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,370\nWe have ICMP, right.\n\n211\n00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,670\nObviously very important.\n\n212\n00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,140\nWe use that.\nWe see that underlying ping.\n\n213\n00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,010\nAnd, so, ICMP Internet Control\nMessage Protocol, right.\n\n214\n00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,310\nSo, we use that for ping.\n\n215\n00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,920\nEverybody knows that or\nat least thinks of it that way.\n\n216\n00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,190\nSNMP, right.\n\n217\n00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,380\nThe Simple Network Management Protocol\ncurrently I think version three,\n\n218\n00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,980\nall right, which is more secure and\n\n219\n00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,960\nhas some encryption built into\nthe transfer traffic there.\n\n220\n00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,130\nBut SNMP is gonna be used to manage\nhardware devices or network device.\n\n221\n00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,270\nThings of that nature,\nwill typically be SNMP based or\n\n222\n00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,060\nwhat we use SNMP to inventory and\nmonitor them.\n\n223\n00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,570\nBut we have BOOTP and DHCP and\nBOOTP is gonna be the bootstrap protocol,\n\n224\n00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,500\nthat's how it's referred to and DHCP is\njust out ability to do dynamic addressing\n\n225\n00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,130\nwithin an environment send out and\ndo the four step process of requesting,\n\n226\n00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,710\noffering, and selecting and\nacknowledging and IP address.\n\n227\n00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,480\nWhether it's the ROSA or\nthe DORA acronym that you come up with,\n\n228\n00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,470\nthe discover offer request acknowledge.\n\n229\n00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,020\nThe twin sisters of IP addresses.\n\n230\n00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,440\nSo we think of either one, again\na mnemonic, something to think about and\n\n231\n00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,152\njust kind of be thinking through.\n\n232\n00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:34,150\nWe wanna make sure we're focused\non these network protocols.\n\n233\n00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,490\nWe have a sense of them.\n\n234\n00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,010\nWe understand a little bit about them.\n\n235\n00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,250\nPut them in the context of how\nwe start building networks.\n\n236\n00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,640\nAnd so when we think about using\nTCIP versus UDP as an example.\n\n237\n00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,860\nWe're thinking about what we're doing\nin terms of what kind of traffic we're\n\n238\n00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,620\ngoing to send across that network.\n\n239\n00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,150\nDoes it have to be something\nthat is acknowledged?\n\n240\n00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,680\nCan it be something that\nis simply streamed and\n\n241\n00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,500\nwe in effect just walk away from it?\n\n242\n00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,400\nReally don't pay much attention to.\n\n243\n00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,360\nWhen we think about using ARP or\nreverse ARP,\n\n244\n00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,730\nwe're thinking about being able to do a\n[COUGH] IP address to Mac address, right.\n\n245\n00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,290\nSo we're thinking about doing a layer\nthree to layer two translation.\n\n246\n00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,710\n>> Right.\n>> And we're trying to figure out whether\n\n247\n00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,380\nwe map the IP to the MAC or\nthe MAC to the IP.\n\n248\n00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,250\nAnd so we wanna understand what that is so\nthat way we can better identify an end\n\n249\n00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,130\npoint, understand where\nthey're coming from.\n\n250\n00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,400\nAnd remember, as we inspect traffic\ncoming through the OSI model,\n\n251\n00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,720\nthe first place we look is at that layer\n2, as you were pointing out, right.\n\n252\n00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,580\nComing up from the physical layer,\nthat Layer two MAC address.\n\n253\n00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,830\nLayer two dynamic link sublayer,\n\n254\n00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,670\nwhich is the max sublayer\ninside the data link layer.\n\n255\n00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,380\nIn the OSM models so our plays at\nthat is gonna be very important for\n\n256\n00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,080\nthat and we need to make sure that\nwe are going to be aware of that.\n\n257\n00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,850\nSo thinking about some of the functional\nelements of these protocols\n\n258\n00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,270\nbecomes very important.\n\n259\n00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,140\nNow also specifically with ARP, and\n\n260\n00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,060\nlet's talk about some security\nrelated issues here for a minute.\n\n261\n00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,020\nWe often hear about the fact\nthat we have a cache,\n\n262\n00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,255\nor a cache, depending on where you\ncome from and how you pronounce that.\n\n263\n00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,260\n[LAUGH] So, maybe you could pull up\nyour command line there for me, for\n\n264\n00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,995\njust a second.\n\n265\n00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,893\n[CROSSTALK] And maybe we could do a,\n\n266\n00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:05,519\nYou'll take a look at\nthe ARP cache real quick.\n\n267\n00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,164\nSo let's do ARP and no [CROSSTALK]\ninstead, let's do / question mark and\n\n268\n00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,072\nshow everybody.\n\n269\n00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:11,635\n>> Okay.\n>> Just how to take a look at\n\n270\n00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:15,085\nthe information around, something like,\nhow do I pull up an ARP cache?\n\n271\n00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,345\n>> Right.\n>> And if I don't know how to do it,\n\n272\n00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,350\nhow do I get it?\n\n273\n00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,970\nAnd so you know with any of these\ncommands and thees protocols for\n\n274\n00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,640\ninstance or things we wanna look at icmp\nfor instance would be the same, right.\n\n275\n00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,887\nIP config would be the same\nwe have up there now.\n\n276\n00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:30,708\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] So but Mike was\njust trying to highlight it for you so\n\n277\n00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,360\nyou can see it.\n\n278\n00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,740\nAnd so the idea there would be, whenever\nwe're not sure about something, right.\n\n279\n00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,930\nHey, I think it was ARP a to display the\ncurrent ARP entries, but was it a big A?\n\n280\n00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,590\nWas it a small a?\n\n281\n00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,130\nSome of these are case sensitive.\n\n282\n00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,780\nAs you can see, ARP -a is right there, it\nis what will display the cache for us, but\n\n283\n00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,770\nif you're not sure, do something slash and\n\n284\n00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,570\nit will bring up what we call in\nLinux the demand file, the help file.\n\n285\n00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,712\nBut in Windows we just refer to it as,\nhey, look at that, it's on the screen.\n\n286\n00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:56,210\n[LAUGH] Right.\nSo, let's talk about the help file.\n\n287\n00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,120\nSo, this is just a little helpful hint for\nyou just generically, so\n\n288\n00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,660\nyou know how to look this stuff up.\n\n289\n00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,810\nCuz if you don't walk around and\n\n290\n00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,290\nuse this stuff every day you may\nnot remember what the command is.\n\n291\n00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,000\nSometimes I I forget.\n\n292\n00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,750\nI don't remember which one I've\ngotta use if it's case sensitive.\n\n293\n00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,680\nSo let's do an ARP -a and let's just maybe\ndo a cls to clear the screen if you want,\n\n294\n00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,830\nor, either way it doesn't really matter.\n\n295\n00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,590\n>> Yeah, let's get back to the top.\n\n296\n00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,590\n>> But just get back up at the top,\nit's easier to keep track of, and\n\n297\n00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,290\nit's a space -a.\n\n298\n00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,610\nLet's see what's in the ARP cache here.\n\n299\n00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,020\nYou haven't been out browsing the dark\ncorners of the internet, right?\n\n300\n00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,680\n>> No, no, I don't think I have, but.\n\n301\n00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,500\n>> Okay, all right.\nJust want to make\n\n302\n00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,400\nsure before we find that.\n\n303\n00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,040\n>> I think I cleared all that\nbefore I started the show.\n\n304\n00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,760\n>> Make sure we don't have anything that's\ngonna potentially cause a problem there.\n\n305\n00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,320\n>> All right.\n\n306\n00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,180\n>> And so what we see is we see\nInternet addresses on the left,\n\n307\n00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,760\nor TCP/IP addresses.\n\n308\n00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,660\nSpecifically IP addresses, I should say.\n\n309\n00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,410\nAnd then on the right in the middle column\nthere what we're seeing is we are seeing\n\n310\n00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,950\nthe MAC address equivalents\nof the physical address map,\n\n311\n00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,960\nas you can see there.\n\n312\n00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,570\nNotice our broadcast\naddress at the bottom,\n\n313\n00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,570\nall 255s, MAC addresses all f's lower\ncase, right, and so we will see that,\n\n314\n00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,290\nthat's one of the things we\ncan look at and identify.\n\n315\n00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,500\nI see our broadcast [INAUDIBLE] broadcast,\nour multicast 224 solution there,\n\n316\n00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,140\nso we see some of the multicast\naddressing ranges there, we'll be talking\n\n317\n00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,550\nabout IP address ranges at some point\nin classes but that would be a class D.\n\n318\n00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,340\nRight, as opposed to a class A, B, or\nC IP address range, or a class range.\n\n319\n00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,790\nSo we're gonna see a class D,\ntherefore a multicast.\n\n320\n00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,590\nAnd we see we've got some\nother addresses there, a 10.\n\n321\n00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,230\nwhatever it is,\nin this case a 10.1.1.100 or 101.\n\n322\n00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,430\nAnd then we've got our MAC addresses for\nthat.\n\n323\n00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,020\nAnd notice some of those are set to\ndynamic, some are set to static, right.\n\n324\n00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,090\nDepending on what it is we're looking\nat and so we can easily do an ARP and\n\n325\n00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,670\nthen an ARP minus a to look at that.\n\n326\n00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,560\nNow we have other caches like net bios,\nright.\n\n327\n00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,570\nSo we can see what's there,\n\n328\n00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,400\nwe have an IP config, a cache where we\nlook at the DNS cache for IP config.\n\n329\n00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,690\nSo we could do a display DNS,\nand then a flush DNS\n\n330\n00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,130\n>> That one could be dangerous.\n\n331\n00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:45,950\n>> Well, yeah it could be.\n\n332\n00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,360\nIt's a good thing it's your machine and\n\n333\n00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,831\nI'm not the one who has\nto take the heat on that.\n\n334\n00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,366\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, we do an IP config display DNS\n\n335\n00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,126\nright, and so what we see is\nsome interesting information.\n\n336\n00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:56,209\nYou know we talked about- Doing\na vulnerability assessment,\n\n337\n00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:59,235\none of are early episodes talked\nabout some reconnaissance,\n\n338\n00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:02,920\nsocial engineering,\ndifferent ways of gathering information.\n\n339\n00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,160\nDo you guys notice anything on the screen,\n\n340\n00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,700\nthat may tell you what kind of\noperating system Mike's running?\n\n341\n00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,490\nNow, obviously clearly, very,\nvery straight forward and\n\n342\n00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,710\nright in the front there, top of the left\nwhere it says winig.ipp6, it says that and\n\n343\n00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,970\nso we can clearly see, that Mike is\nrunning a Windows 8 build here, and\n\n344\n00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,750\nhe's using, right,\nthe ipv6 stack as part of what he's using.\n\n345\n00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:30,010\nAnd so we can see here that just by doing\nin this case an IP config display DNS,\n\n346\n00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,100\nwe may have foot-printed, or\nfingerprinted the OS right, it figured\n\n347\n00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,080\nout what it is that we're running, so just\nmaking those times for you and pointing\n\n348\n00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,240\nsome things out for you but you'll see\nwe've got the IPv6.Microsoft.com there.\n\n349\n00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,990\nAnd we've got some resolutions there,\nwe also have a TTL set to 234 so that.\n\n350\n00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,840\nThe number of seconds that this\nregistration will stay current in\n\n351\n00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,855\nthe [CROSSTALK] if we do that\nagain it should go down.\n\n352\n00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:58,990\nSo it's down by about 60 seconds.\n\n353\n00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,600\nAnd if we wait long enough\nthat will tick down to zero.\n\n354\n00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800\nThere's a good way to spend three minutes.\n\n355\n00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,345\n>> That is.\n\n356\n00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,730\n[LAUGH]\n>> Hammering away at that.\n\n357\n00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,410\nAll right.\n\n358\n00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:11,230\nSo we have that, and we also have the host\nrecord, the A record at the bottom,\n\n359\n00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,340\nwhich is giving us the host registration\ninformation, the IP address for\n\n360\n00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,840\nthe host that's serving that up.\n\n361\n00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,797\nAnd we have the C name record up above\nat the bottom of the first entry,\n\n362\n00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:25,166\nwhich is the conotical name record,\nwhich is basically the fully qualified\n\n363\n00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,802\nregistration for\nthat hosts for 15756106.189.\n\n364\n00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:31,411\nSo we're seeing a lot of\ninformation there, just again,\n\n365\n00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:33,920\none of the local caches\navailable on our machine.\n\n366\n00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,337\nNow if we wanted to clear that cache out,\nand get rid of that information instead of\n\n367\n00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:42,497\nan IP config display DNS we would do an IP\nconfig flash DNS and when we do that and\n\n368\n00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:45,569\nthen we get rid of it you will\nsee as soon as we go back up here\n\n369\n00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:49,819\nthat we have nothing in the cash because\nnow we have effectively gotten rid of.\n\n370\n00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,412\nAny of the information that would have\nbeen there as part of that even though it\n\n371\n00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:57,870\ndidn't take down to the zero on TTL which\nwould automatically get rid of it itself.\n\n372\n00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,800\nJust a quick little primer for\nyou on IP config.\n\n373\n00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,490\nOn caching in general, specific to ARP but\nthen a little more broadly.\n\n374\n00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,620\nWe wanna make sure as part of thinking\nabout this is that there's entries\n\n375\n00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,100\nthat are stored on the local machine.\n\n376\n00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,940\nNow, from a security standpoint, may or\n\n377\n00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,430\nmay not be that critical,\ncuz again, proximity access.\n\n378\n00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,750\nCan I get to the box?\n\n379\n00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,000\nCan I successfully take that information?\n\n380\n00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,810\nMay be very difficult to use that.\n\n381\n00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,180\nBut ARP is an unauthenticated protocol,\nwhich means that in theory,\n\n382\n00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,150\nDNS cache poisoning, ARP cache poisoning,\nalthough now we have DNSSec.\n\n383\n00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,580\nSo obviously it's\na little bit more secure.\n\n384\n00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,910\n>> ARP side of things.\n\n385\n00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,600\n>> Right.\n\n386\n00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,710\n>> And they'll cache just about anything\nthey get off the network, right?\n\n387\n00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,980\n>> They will cache anything.\n\n388\n00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,540\nRight.\nThey don't know.\n\n389\n00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,910\nAnd there's no security associated with it\ncuz we have no way of authenticating it.\n\n390\n00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,910\nAs a result, if we send out ARP\nregistrations into the network, and\n\n391\n00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,760\nwe get machines to cache them and\nthey're malformed, they're incorrect, what\n\n392\n00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,210\nwill happen is a very simplistic denial\nof service attack, but one that is very\n\n393\n00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,440\neffective, because what it effectively\ndoes is, it rewires an effect, right?\n\n394\n00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,180\nOur network configuration resolution,\n\n395\n00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,840\nin such a way that we always\nlook at our local caches.\n\n396\n00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,400\nBefore we go out and do anything else.\n\n397\n00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,640\n>> It's quicker, it's right there local,\nif my computer thinks it has the answer\n\n398\n00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,790\nalready, then there's no need for\nit to check with DNS.\n\n399\n00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,540\nIt has no way of knowing if that\nanswer's incorrect or has been poisoned.\n\n400\n00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,690\n>> Absolutely correct.\n\n401\n00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,710\nWe wanna be aware of that and\n\n402\n00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,670\njust think about that because\nthat's an old school thing.\n\n403\n00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,500\nBut an oldie but a goody as we say.\n\n404\n00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,350\nYes.\n>> Cuz our cache poisoning can occur.\n\n405\n00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,130\n>> That's a great start to\nthe man in the middle attack.\n\n406\n00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,670\n>> It is.\n\n407\n00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> It is.\n\n408\n00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:23,760\nIt redirects you.\n\n409\n00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,290\nAnd it's very easy to fix, by the way.\n\n410\n00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,910\nYou saw it.\n\n411\n00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,940\nIt's very easy to purge cache.\n\n412\n00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,780\nBut you have to know that\nthat's what's happening and\n\n413\n00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,510\nyou have to know what\nthe warning signs are.\n\n414\n00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,270\nIf you're the only one that's resolving\na certain way and everybody around you,\n\n415\n00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,250\nis getting out to the internet or\nfinding the file server and you're not.\n\n416\n00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,470\nIt's most likely because you have a bad\nregistration in one of the cashes.\n\n417\n00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,150\nOne of the reasons that\nrebooting a system tends to work\n\n418\n00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,980\nreally well at fixing a lot of things\nis that we tend to clear those caches.\n\n419\n00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,210\nAnd everything goes away, and all the\nsudden everything starts working again.\n\n420\n00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,490\nWell it's not magic, right,\n\n421\n00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,560\nI mean it starts working for\na very good reason, right?\n\n422\n00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,020\nI'm bursting everybody's bubble out there.\n\n423\n00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,750\nIt's like, pay no attention to\nthe man behind the curtain.\n\n424\n00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,870\nHe doesn't exist,\n\n425\n00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,480\nwe just want you to be aware of this\nbecause this is the hidden thing.\n\n426\n00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,060\nThis is the thing we don't speak about\nunderlying the fact that it's Microsoft.\n\n427\n00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,280\nIf we just reboot it, it will work.\n\n428\n00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,170\nYeah, there's all that, but that's after\nyou actually get all the stuff up and\n\n429\n00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,610\nrunning in the app layer.\n\n430\n00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,490\nLower down in the stack in the OSI\nmodel further down where all the real\n\n431\n00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,190\ngood important stuff happens,\nit restarts and resets those caches.\n\n432\n00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,160\nAnd that's why we're clearing\nout a lot of that garbage,\n\n433\n00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,840\nso wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n434\n00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,490\nAll right, so having said that, we're\nfocusing on ARP, and reverse ARP, or RARP.\n\n435\n00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,280\nObviously doing a ping, we took a look at\nnot pinging, but we did take a look at\n\n436\n00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,180\nICMP, or rather, IP config, but we didn't\nreally go through the whole thing, but\n\n437\n00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,380\nyou could do a persistent ping, setting\nup the ping to do some diagnosis there,\n\n438\n00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,390\nmaybe a ping dash key would be good.\n\n439\n00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,470\nYou wanna know about that.\n\n440\n00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,490\nCertainly, making sure we\nunderstand that BOOT P traffic,\n\n441\n00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,600\nDHCP based traffic,\nis broadcast traffic, so\n\n442\n00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,770\nlet's talk about broadcasting for\njust a minute we are broadcasting to you.\n\n443\n00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,170\nWhen we broadcast out,\n\n444\n00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:08,010\nyou're receiving this information because\nyou're able to hear it and see it, and\n\n445\n00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,580\nit's transiting a lot of connectivity\ndevices transit switches,\n\n446\n00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,520\ntransit routers, transit firewalls cuz\nit's coming out of our studios and\n\n447\n00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,730\nultimately winding up somewhere\non the far side of the world,\n\n448\n00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,230\nwherever you happen to be near or\nclose to us and you are receiving it.\n\n449\n00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,600\nBut because it is a certain kind of\nbroadcast it's making its way through all\n\n450\n00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,340\nof those devices with no trouble.\n\n451\n00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,350\nTraditional broadcast traffic inside\nof a LAN is actually dropped and\n\n452\n00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,640\nstopped at a device, like a router.\n\n453\n00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,720\nBecause the idea is that the router\ndoes not propagate broadcast traffic,\n\n454\n00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,420\nit's specifically to\nprevent broadcast storms.\n\n455\n00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,320\n>> Help us to create those\ncontention domains and\n\n456\n00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,800\nfewer hosts have to compete with\neach other for time on the network.\n\n457\n00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,310\n>> Right.\nSo\n\n458\n00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,930\nwe don't really have the gladiatorial\nnetwork games any longer.\n\n459\n00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,300\nSo we don't see that.\n\n460\n00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,080\nI'm gonna fight you to the death for\nthat packet.\n\n461\n00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,790\nBut, what is important for\n\n462\n00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,090\nus to be aware of is the fact that because\nrouters will stop broadcast traffic.\n\n463\n00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,880\nThey effectively will just simply\nignore the packets and drop them and\n\n464\n00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,960\nlet them decrement down to\nzero in the TTL and die.\n\n465\n00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,700\nAs a result of that we prevent\nwhat is called a broadcast storm.\n\n466\n00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,890\nBroadcast storms are not\nbeing propagated forward,\n\n467\n00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,720\nat least in architectures that\nare set up the right way.\n\n468\n00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,550\nPurposely work around the router and trick\ninto sending that traffic out, right,\n\n469\n00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,530\nbut sooner it gets set up the right\nway we will stop broadcast storm.\n\n470\n00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,670\nSo, that's the good news, right.\n\n471\n00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,560\nNo tidal wave taking out our network.\n\n472\n00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,340\nThe bad news is that everything else\ngets swept up in that tidal wave that is\n\n473\n00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,060\nbroadcast caster may be good,\nand so- well, right, exactly.\n\n474\n00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,830\nWhat we do with that is we\nhave a certain kind of packet,\n\n475\n00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,370\nPHCP packets, that are actually gonna\nbe able to be propagated through\n\n476\n00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,990\na router if we set them up a certain\nway and follow an RFC standard, right?\n\n477\n00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,830\n>> Yep.\n>> In order to be able to use them and\n\n478\n00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,645\nto send them out and so,\nwanna make sure that we know that,\n\n479\n00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:46,810\nwanna make sure that we're aware\nof the fact that that DHCP setup,\n\n480\n00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,820\nthe I won't call it the hand shake, as we\ndo the three way handshake for TCP, but\n\n481\n00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,640\nthat four way exchange of\ninformation that we talked about.\n\n482\n00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,470\nDora Right?\n\n483\n00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,130\nWhere we go and discover,\noffer, request, acknowledge.\n\n484\n00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,680\nOr ROSA, request, offer,\nselection and knowledge.\n\n485\n00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,720\nRight?\nThose items will go back and\n\n486\n00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,650\nforth from a host that has no IP address,\nor\n\n487\n00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:09,900\nat least one that is not going to be used\nright now for routing out onto the WAN.\n\n488\n00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,440\nWe may have an APIPA base address,\nso once it's 9254 address\n\n489\n00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,150\nin later operating systems where we assign\nan IP address that's good on the LAN.\n\n490\n00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,620\nKeeps us on our sub-net,\nkeeps us connected so\n\n491\n00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,820\nwe can request that IP address from\nthe DHCP server when it comes back online.\n\n492\n00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,290\nBut it's not gonna be able to be\nused to go outside the LAN, right?\n\n493\n00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,325\nIt's just a local address only,\nspecial address block called APIPA,\n\n494\n00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:36,090\nA-P-I-P-A, for\nautomatic private IP addressing.\n\n495\n00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,418\nBut if we don't have that, then what we\neffectively have is a host with no IP\n\n496\n00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,256\naddress, maybe all zeros or a 1.69254.\n\n497\n00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,901\nAnd then we are going to send\nout that hey are you available?\n\n498\n00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:48,248\nIs there a GHCP server\npacket out there I need?\n\n499\n00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:52,017\nIf so I need you.\n\n500\n00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:54,211\nAnd then we're gonna get back from\nthe DHCP server basically an offer.\n\n501\n00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:57,278\nHey yes I'm out here and\nI may have something you need.\n\n502\n00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,030\nWe're gonna o then return that with a\nrequest and say OK I'd like an IP address.\n\n503\n00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,390\nAnd we get back an acknowledgement.\n\n504\n00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,868\nThe four step.\nStep in processing, okay, here you are and\n\n505\n00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:05,855\nhere you go.\n\n506\n00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:09,145\nAnd at that point, and only at that point,\nby the way, at the end of the transaction\n\n507\n00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:12,655\nin step four, when the host has\ntaken the announcement packet and\n\n508\n00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:16,260\nprocessed it, do we then actually see\nan IP address appearing on the host\n\n509\n00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,110\nit's already been noted\nin the DHCP database so\n\n510\n00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,460\nit's effectively it's part of\nthe scope and been leased out.\n\n511\n00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,990\nWe now have a reference to it, so we need\nto make sure we understand that that\n\n512\n00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,860\ntraffic is broadcast based for the entire\noperation, until we come back and\n\n513\n00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,170\ntry to renew that address\nafter having one.\n\n514\n00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,580\nBecause at that point we're\nusing an IP based solutions so.\n\n515\n00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,820\n>> No idea the IP address of the server.\n\n516\n00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,410\n>> It's a unicast so\nit's suppose to broadcast right?\n\n517\n00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,340\nThat's right.\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n518\n00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,070\nBut at that first point,\nit is all broadcast and so\n\n519\n00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,950\nthat traffic won't pass the router\ntypically unless it is gonna\n\n520\n00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,290\nbe set up to use this proper\nRSC/g-based standard.\n\n521\n00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,070\n>> RSc1542, if I remember correctly.\n\n522\n00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,215\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So,\n\n523\n00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:51,220\nthat's what we need to make sure\nwere just focused on, so very good.\n\n524\n00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:57,390\nAnd also we have the need to know that\nwe could also use a DHCP relay agent.\n\n525\n00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,560\nWe may decide to setup a relay agent\nthat basically takes all of that traffic\n\n526\n00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,870\nright aggregates for us on the LAN.\n\n527\n00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,870\nIs dual home so\n\n528\n00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,200\nit has a network card sitting on\neither side of the router interface or\n\n529\n00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,530\nconnected to either side to sub-nets and\neffectively allows us to pass the traffic.\n\n530\n00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,680\nIt's kind of old school because we don't\ntend to set up too many relay agents\n\n531\n00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,320\nanymore, we just tend to use\nrouters that are compliant,\n\n532\n00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,240\nright because the result of pass\nthe traffic is we tag the traffic.\n\n533\n00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,840\nSo we just want to make sure we're aware\nof that, and we know that that is done.\n\n534\n00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,300\nOr, of course, the third option is\nyou bring the DHCP server local to\n\n535\n00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,090\nthe sub net, where the hosts are, right?\n\n536\n00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,210\nSo we eliminate the need to\nbroadcast in the first place.\n\n537\n00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,520\nWe do really have options there, right?\n\n538\n00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,070\nWe just want to make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n539\n00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,170\nBut just thinking through that\nhelps us to understand that and\n\n540\n00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,232\nmake sure we're comfortable with that.\n\n541\n00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:47,430\nThe BooTP process, the DHCP traffic\nas we said, passing through that,\n\n542\n00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,690\nmaking sure we know the offer,\nthe request and\n\n543\n00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,600\nthe acknowledgement, all that stuff\nis gonna be very helpful for you.\n\n544\n00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,564\nWe also want to make sure as we\nsaid that these kinds of protocols,\n\n545\n00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:00,927\nDHCP, are reverse our BOOTP.\n\n546\n00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,750\nThey could be used for reconnaissance.\n\n547\n00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,020\nWe could scout out the network and\nwe can get information.\n\n548\n00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,920\nIf I can lease an address as a rogue\nclient on a sub-net, I now have your\n\n549\n00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:17,920\nnetwork address information,\nI now have the perhaps the DNS server.\n\n550\n00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,820\nAnd at least one of them anyway.\n\n551\n00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,820\nI certainly know your sub-net, I will know\nan IP range, and so we wanna make sure\n\n552\n00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,540\nthat we're aware of that, because that can\nbe giving out a lot of information, right?\n\n553\n00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:35,380\nThat will give out a lot of information\nfor us N-O-W, right, N-O-W?\n\n554\n00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,880\nAnd so, as a result.\n\n555\n00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,090\nThere we go, look,\nall of a sudden it's spelled correctly.\n\n556\n00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,590\nAwesome!\n\n557\n00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,655\n>> Look at my built-in spell\nchecker right next to me.\n\n558\n00:26:41,655 --> 00:26:44,280\n>> [LAUGH] And by the way, I'm\nthe world's most horrible speller, so for\n\n559\n00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,680\nme to get that right was pretty cool cuz\nit's probably never gonna happen again.\n\n560\n00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,390\nI can't spell my way out of a paper\nbag to save my life typically.\n\n561\n00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,890\nBut, so we wanna make sure we're aware\nof the fact that there are security\n\n562\n00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,448\nimplications associated with some of\nthat's right a very important thing.\n\n563\n00:26:57,448 --> 00:27:00,330\nWe are did talk about DNS\nas well a little bit,\n\n564\n00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,400\nabout using DNS to do name resolution.\n\n565\n00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,840\nI believe we did in one of our\nearlier episodes look at WHOis and\n\n566\n00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,670\nwe actually went through and\npulled up a WHOis registration.\n\n567\n00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,170\nWalked through the concept of using some\nof that name registration information for\n\n568\n00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,230\nsocial reconnaissance and for basically.\n\n569\n00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,950\nSome preparatory work\naround maybe a pen test or\n\n570\n00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,640\na hack, what we give out out there\npotentially, something to consider,\n\n571\n00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,290\nwe talked about the NS lookup tool and\nmaking sure we understand that we could\n\n572\n00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,810\npotentially do a name,\na zone transfer, right?\n\n573\n00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,390\nA name resolution zone transfer request,\nwhere if we can get that zone, we get,\n\n574\n00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,010\nI think you pointed out when we did it,\nyou get all of that information.\n\n575\n00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,570\n>> Everything, yep.\n\n576\n00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,170\n>> We didn't do that live, that might have\nbeen actually a good little demo to do.\n\n577\n00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,040\nBut we want to think about that.\n\n578\n00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,910\nWith ICMP, I mentioned the fact that\nthis is for ping, obviously, so\n\n579\n00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,930\nwe wanna just make sure that we're\nthinking about what ping is good for,\n\n580\n00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,480\ndiagnosing that we have a connectivity\nissue, pinging a machine to make sure it's\n\n581\n00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,980\nup and running, heart beating,\nall that kind of stuff, is good.\n\n582\n00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,770\nBut we have some security\nissues associated with this,\n\n583\n00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,690\nwe could have an ICMP redirect attack,\nwhere potentially, somebody's mirroring\n\n584\n00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,400\nthat ping back to us, and amplifying it\nfor a distributed denial of service, or\n\n585\n00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,450\na denial of service focused at us\nwhich could be a ping of death.\n\n586\n00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,020\n>> Right, malformed ping packets.\n\n587\n00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,080\n>> Malformed ping packets, and they're\njust coming in and overwhelming us and\n\n588\n00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,480\nwe're having to open up\nsessions to respond, and\n\n589\n00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,765\nlocking open resources eventually,\nrunning machine into the ground.\n\n590\n00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:18,400\nCuz we have, in effect,\nno more overhead available.\n\n591\n00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,480\nWe could use trace route,\n\n592\n00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,270\nand be able to exploit information in\ntrace route by looking at a network map.\n\n593\n00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,920\nAnd so\nthat's something to consider as well.\n\n594\n00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,480\nWe could do a ping scan, right,\n\n595\n00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,910\nand just scan the network and\nfind out what's out there.\n\n596\n00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,100\nAnd so, we are, potentially,\nopen to certain vulnerabilities, and just,\n\n597\n00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,860\nyou know, we use these network\nmonitoring tools or these\n\n598\n00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,810\nport tools that will just go out and do\na swath of a sub-net and scan everybody,\n\n599\n00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:45,185\nping quickly, find things that are alive\nand then come back and drill in.\n\n600\n00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:46,651\n[CROSSTALK] So\nthis is the kind of thing we see\n\n601\n00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:48,217\nthat could potentially be an issue, right?\n\n602\n00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:52,347\nAnd maybe we could quickly just sort of\ntracer it up and, Command window there,\n\n603\n00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:54,210\nmaybe just do a quick show and tell.\n\n604\n00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,610\nBecause I don't know if everybody's\nseen that, maybe do that real quick.\n\n605\n00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:03,630\nYour trace route or as we refer to it,\ntracer, in the window stack just\n\n606\n00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:07,120\nbecause that's the short version\nof the name of the tool there.\n\n607\n00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,050\nAllows us to look at\na hop map if you will.\n\n608\n00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,520\nWhat's at the hop count\nfrom where you are,\n\n609\n00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,110\nyour starting endpoint to your starting\npoint rather to your endpoint.\n\n610\n00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,660\nIt looks at every stop around the way,\nevery hop which is touching a routered\n\n611\n00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,210\ninterface and\nit lays out the IP address map for you.\n\n612\n00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,620\nAnd maybe we could do a tracer out to\nCNN.com we'll dive the firewall there.\n\n613\n00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,280\n>> Yeah, pretty much.\n\n614\n00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,300\n>> But we will get out beyond\nat least a couple of the,\n\n615\n00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,530\nhopefully a couple of the hops, right?\n\n616\n00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,310\nAnd this maybe short in\nterms of quickly resolving,\n\n617\n00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,170\nyou can see the first one once it hit.\n\n618\n00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,180\nFirewall then goes out real quickly,\nbut right after that we get some\n\n619\n00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,370\ndifferent ones, and so here you can see we\nare making a round trip down to Miami, and\n\n620\n00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,010\nthen to Atlanta, and\nwe are bouncing all over the place.\n\n621\n00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,750\nIt is actually interesting,\nbecause if you scroll up a bit,\n\n622\n00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,190\nright past that first one, no, go up that\nway you get past like the first couple and\n\n623\n00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,050\nlike stop go down a little more.\n\n624\n00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,680\nJust go down, down, down, down, no no no\nI'm sorry, go up, there inverted, right.\n\n625\n00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,240\nWait, we're flying upside down.\n\n626\n00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,352\nWhat's happening.\n\n627\n00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:09,710\nAll right, so, what I wanted\nto point out is the following.\n\n628\n00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,270\nOn line six and line seven.\n\n629\n00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,180\nIf you start looking there,\nwe're in Miami, right?\n\n630\n00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,810\nMIA.\nSo,\n\n631\n00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,330\nwe're basically resolving\ndown there to Miami.\n\n632\n00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,130\nAnd, then if you notice a little\nfurther down on line nine,\n\n633\n00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,680\nwe go from Miami up to Atlanta, right?\n\n634\n00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,720\nAnd it's kinda interesting because it's\nobviously where we want to wind up.\n\n635\n00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,020\nRight.\n>> But we effective,\n\n636\n00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,620\nwe are jumping from here, right in\nthe middle of the state of Florida,\n\n637\n00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,380\ndown south to come back up on the pipe,\nbecause of the way of the routing and\n\n638\n00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,120\nthe architecture of\nthe Internet is set up.\n\n639\n00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,950\n>> Right.\n>> Miami is a NAP,\n\n640\n00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,860\nit's a network access point,\nit's got all of that information.\n\n641\n00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,160\nAll of that infrastructure\nsitting down there in Terremark,\n\n642\n00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,190\nthe big data center down in Miami.\n\n643\n00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,790\nAs a result, we wind up down there based\non the provider you guys are using and\n\n644\n00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:55,370\nhow they path their traffic before we\nactually bounce back up on a DNS RSP\n\n645\n00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:55,990\nuse them there.\n\n646\n00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,240\n>> Right.\n\n647\n00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,590\nSo you're coming out of there and\nthen we wind up going down.\n\n648\n00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,700\nIt's just interesting that\nultimately you wind up there.\n\n649\n00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,545\nAnd we stop at,\nyou can see the website for\n\n650\n00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:07,260\nCNN.com right there whatever\nthat particular resolution is.\n\n651\n00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,850\nSo this is what a typical trace rout would\ndo, and of itself may not expose a lot of\n\n652\n00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,200\ninformation, but what it does tell me is\nit tells me what the logical path is.\n\n653\n00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,970\nIt takes 14 hops to get from there to\nhere, and it tells me that there may be\n\n654\n00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,820\ncertain points along the way that I\ncan go and try to interdict traffic.\n\n655\n00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,200\nRight?\nSo it's just giving me some\n\n656\n00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,290\ninformation here.\n\n657\n00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,750\nSo just some stuff to think about.\n\n658\n00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:32,406\nAll right, so when we talk about that,\nobviously, we're talking about the use of\n\n659\n00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:36,729\nand the ability to understand these\nprotocols in a way that allows us to, from\n\n660\n00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:41,610\na security standpoint, really drill in and\nunderstand what's happening with them.\n\n661\n00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,148\nWe do have a couple of other\n\n662\n00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:43,131\nvulnerabilities we want\nto quickly throw out.\n\n663\n00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:44,812\nTo wrap up our thoughts here,\n\n664\n00:31:44,812 --> 00:31:48,390\nwe talked about some of the other\nattacks like we have up there.\n\n665\n00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n666\n00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:54,550\n>> The pings scanner sweep, or some sort\nof ping of death or things like that.\n\n667\n00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,620\nWe may have a smurf attack\nwhere we misuse the ICMP echo.\n\n668\n00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,185\nSo, we will have a smurf attack that will\nbasically go out try create a an echo,\n\n669\n00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:06,520\nin effect in such a way that we we use\nthat in such a way that we can then knock\n\n670\n00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,710\na system offline.\n\n671\n00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,580\nWe may have a fraggle attack.\n\n672\n00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,760\nFraggle attack is gonna\nuse UDP instead of ICMP so\n\n673\n00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,925\nit's basically a smurf\nattack used with UDP.\n\n674\n00:32:14,925 --> 00:32:17,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And we could have a teardrop or\n\n675\n00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,700\nan overlapping fragmentation attack.\n\n676\n00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,750\nThese are IP fragmentation attacks,\nwhere effectively we will go in, and\n\n677\n00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:29,070\nwe will break up packets and stream them\nin such a way that we setup lots and\n\n678\n00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,810\nlots of open sessions and\nnever close them.\n\n679\n00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,276\nAnd we basically suck all\nthe resources out of the system,\n\n680\n00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:35,959\neffectively grinding it to a halt\nwhen we do IP fragmentation.\n\n681\n00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:39,547\nSo these would be these will\nbe like a tear drop attack,\n\n682\n00:32:39,547 --> 00:32:44,163\nwould be a good example of a IP\nfragmentation attack, type of attack.\n\n683\n00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,597\nIt's called a tear drop attack.\n\n684\n00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:50,154\nSo, we may have that, and\nwe could have a spoofing attack.\n\n685\n00:32:50,154 --> 00:32:52,950\nWe could have an attack that\npretends to be something, and\n\n686\n00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,270\nis indeed something else.\n\n687\n00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n688\n00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,460\n>> So spoofing attacks,\n\n689\n00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,430\nare just another category of attacks\nthat we may see here as well.\n\n690\n00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,790\nThere's lots of different kinds\nof attacks that exist out there.\n\n691\n00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,680\nAgain, we get into territory\nhere where we can spend, and\n\n692\n00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,220\njust hours talking through all\nthese attacks, how they work?\n\n693\n00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,150\nWhat are the tools used to\nnot only carry them out, but\n\n694\n00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,415\nthen how do we defend against them?\n\n695\n00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:13,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And,\n\n696\n00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,720\nat some point you'll wanna get into that,\nand really understand that knowledge.\n\n697\n00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,050\nBut at this level for\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n698\n00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:22,760\nWe wanna have general awareness, of\na general sense of some of these things.\n\n699\n00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,330\nAnd then have points of reference for you\nto go back, and maybe drill down on later.\n\n700\n00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,140\nBut remember, first and\nforemost, we wanna get really\n\n701\n00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,790\ngood at understanding the general thought\nprocess behind building secure systems,\n\n702\n00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:38,200\nthe general ideas behind the architecture,\nanswer those questions as they come up.\n\n703\n00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,810\nAnd then, once we're successful at getting\nthrough the certification requirements,\n\n704\n00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:45,520\nthen we can focus on really becoming\nexperts at certain areas and\n\n705\n00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,150\ndrilling down professionally\nas we develop those skills.\n\n706\n00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,650\nTo be able to get better\nat certain things, right.\n\n707\n00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,730\nYou may become that person, that guy or\n\n708\n00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,640\nthat girl that wants to be the expert\non these kind of attacks, and\n\n709\n00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,880\nthese kind of network typologies and\nreally just build out secure networks.\n\n710\n00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,720\nSomebody else might decide they wanna\nbe the person that really gets good at\n\n711\n00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,450\nrisk analysis and VIA.\n\n712\n00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,310\nAnother person may decide they just\nwanna be the person who goes out and\n\n713\n00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,580\ndoes policies, and just writes policy,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n714\n00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,744\n[CROSSTALK] So, it's really question\nwhat you think you wanna do,\n\n715\n00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:10,604\nwhat's exciting to you.\n\n716\n00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:14,018\nSo, I think we're probably at\na good place to take a small break.\n\n717\n00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:18,630\n>> Well,\nwe're gonna take a little break then, and\n\n718\n00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:22,165\nwe'll be right back with you.\n\n719\n00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:26,757\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back,\neverybody, to our networking,\n\n720\n00:34:26,757 --> 00:34:30,942\nwe're doing I think Part 3 is\nwhere we're at at this point.\n\n721\n00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:35,030\nBut, lots of networking stuff that we're\ngoing over, we've been over, in this last\n\n722\n00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,680\nsegment we saw a bunch of the protocols\nthat we're gonna have to be aware of.\n\n723\n00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,510\nSupport numbers,\n\n724\n00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,280\nstarted associating some of those with\ndifferent layers in the OSI model.\n\n725\n00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,960\nAnd I think we're gonna\ndive right back in, and\n\n726\n00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,472\nmaybe get into some more protocols.\n\n727\n00:34:46,472 --> 00:34:49,070\n>> We're gonna talk a little bit about\nrouting protocols, absolutely, or\n\n728\n00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,145\nwe're gonna jump in talk about those,\ninterior versus exterior,\n\n729\n00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:56,230\ngonna throw up a bunch of port numbers you\nneed to be aware of for these protocols.\n\n730\n00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,400\nThis will be more of a, we just got\na known kind of item that you wanna\n\n731\n00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,430\nmake sure you focus on as you\nprepare to answer some questions.\n\n732\n00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,475\nWe'll expose the bottom of that list\ntherefore, in a couple of minutes.\n\n733\n00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:06,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n734\n00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,180\nnow let's move up to routing protocols, or\nmove over to routing protocols I should\n\n735\n00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,860\nsay, and so we wanna understand\nwhat the routing protocols are.\n\n736\n00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,370\nThat these are the things, that are gonna\nhelp us to move information from\n\n737\n00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,060\npoint A to point B, right, so we're\ntalking about both interior and exterior.\n\n738\n00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,200\nInside the interior gateway protocols,\nwe actually subdivide.\n\n739\n00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,670\nAs you can see,\nwe've listed four of them there for you.\n\n740\n00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,060\nWe have, well actually technically five,\ncuz RIP is V1, V2.\n\n741\n00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,430\nIt's kind of two separate ones.\n\n742\n00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,920\n>> Right.\n>> But, RIP generically.\n\n743\n00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,712\nIRGP, EIGRP, enhanced, and then OSPF.\n\n744\n00:35:38,712 --> 00:35:42,390\nAnd so, we also put a distance vector or\n\n745\n00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,420\nlink state classification\non each of these,\n\n746\n00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,090\nbecause inside of the interior gateway\nprotocol thought process for routing.\n\n747\n00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:52,630\nWe have these two mechanisms or methods\nthat we use to help us sub-define and\n\n748\n00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,320\nreally understand,\nthe way in which we calculate.\n\n749\n00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,880\nHow these protocols affect and\nwe're gonna be able to send and\n\n750\n00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,980\nreceived, the mechanism\nthat are used to do so.\n\n751\n00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,940\nSo, when we talk about Distance Vector,\nwe're talking about a protocol\n\n752\n00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,710\nthat is traditionally gonna\nbe seen in smaller networks.\n\n753\n00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:12,285\nLink state protocols are gonna be\ntypically seen in the larger networks,\n\n754\n00:36:12,285 --> 00:36:16,855\nmore complicated, a lot more management,\nan extensibility in the formatting and\n\n755\n00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:18,455\nthe way that that link state works.\n\n756\n00:36:18,455 --> 00:36:19,475\nBut in Distance Vector,\n\n757\n00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:22,262\nwe're talking about typically protocols\nseen in smaller, all our networks.\n\n758\n00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:24,172\nVery simple, they use times and\n\n759\n00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:27,457\ncompute based on a compute path,\nbasically, based on a metric.\n\n760\n00:36:27,457 --> 00:36:32,312\nSo, we look at a metric for that path and\nsay this is this or that, and\n\n761\n00:36:32,312 --> 00:36:35,736\nas a result, we see that that particular\npath will be the one that we use.\n\n762\n00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:39,816\nAnd so Distance Vector are gonna be\nrelatively simplistic by comparison, so\n\n763\n00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:42,726\nyou can see RIP, RIP v1, RIP v2, IGRP,\n\n764\n00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:48,060\nas well as EIGRP enhanced\ninterior gateway protocol.\n\n765\n00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,720\nAre going to be falling\ninto that category.\n\n766\n00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,890\nAnd then we see OSPF link state, OSPF\nwhen we talk about link state protocols,\n\n767\n00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,460\nare really going to be event\nbased update parameters.\n\n768\n00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,380\nWe'll look at the up or\ndown state of that particular link,\n\n769\n00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,480\nand we use that as the basis to\nthen decide how to route traffic.\n\n770\n00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,770\nSo, if we see that a link is down,\nwe will update the routing parameters\n\n771\n00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,760\nthrough propagation to\nthe routing devices.\n\n772\n00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,780\nIn other words, the routing table\nwill update, and as a result of that,\n\n773\n00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,380\nwe will then switch to a secondary\npath to get from point A to point B,\n\n774\n00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,550\nbecause that primary path,\nwhatever it is no longer valid.\n\n775\n00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,140\nBecause, the links they chose that\nare just down is gonna be decremented.\n\n776\n00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,680\nIt's no longer seen as valid.\n\n777\n00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,090\nIt's a more expensive route,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n778\n00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,240\nSo, we're looking at almost real time,\nnetwork information and\n\n779\n00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,870\nreconnaissance going on\nwith link state protocols,\n\n780\n00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:40,450\nas opposed to the distance vector\nprotocols which don't really understand,\n\n781\n00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,480\nthe true real-time state of the network\nin terms of the architecture.\n\n782\n00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,480\nThey keep sending down that path, because\nuntil somebody tells them not to and\n\n783\n00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,390\nor until we find out the hard way that\nthings are not working the right way.\n\n784\n00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,390\nSo, they don't update\ndynamically the same way.\n\n785\n00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,010\nSo, just be aware of that,\nbe aware of that distinction.\n\n786\n00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,190\nFor the exterior side, we have BGP,\nBorder Gateway Protocol.\n\n787\n00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,260\nThat is actually what's called\na Path Vector Protocol.\n\n788\n00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,660\nIt uses a slightly different solution\nto figure out how things go.\n\n789\n00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,070\nIt is different than link state,\ndifferent than distance vector.\n\n790\n00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,920\nWe refer to it as Path Vector.\n\n791\n00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,930\nNot that critical for you,\nin this particular exam.\n\n792\n00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,580\nTo be focused on that distinction.\n\n793\n00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,380\nIf you were doing a Cisco exam, for\ninstance, maybe something of note.\n\n794\n00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,598\nMaybe we're spending some time on.\n\n795\n00:38:22,598 --> 00:38:26,060\nIf you wanna impress at a party,\nthrow that out there,\n\n796\n00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,520\nsay about that Path Vector thing,\nwhat do you think about that?\n\n797\n00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,380\n>> You'd be the hit of the party,\nwouldn't you?\n\n798\n00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,010\n>> [LAUGH] Only if you're hanging\nout in certain circles, I suppose.\n\n799\n00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,280\nBut, other than that,\nit's really not worth your time.\n\n800\n00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,360\nAnd then we have EGP which is\nan Exterior Gateway Protocol.\n\n801\n00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,670\nOld protocol,\nreally retired by today's standards.\n\n802\n00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,760\nWe don't typically see EGP anymore.\n\n803\n00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,580\nIt's one of the early,\n\n804\n00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:51,090\nvery first protocols that were typically\nused on the internet way back when.\n\n805\n00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,400\nBut it's considered old by today's\nstandards, so we don't really see it.\n\n806\n00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,210\nIt's just out there as a point\nof reference as another example\n\n807\n00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,890\nof an exterior protocol,\nthat you may come across,\n\n808\n00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,710\nmaybe asked about, but probably will not\nsee in production more often, than not.\n\n809\n00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,820\nAt least not in most modern networks,\nanyway.\n\n810\n00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,750\nSo, having talked about those real\nquick probably wanna quickly throw in,\n\n811\n00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,850\nthe idea of NATs,\nnetwork address translation.\n\n812\n00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,370\nJust as a thought process.\n\n813\n00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,120\nMaking sure we understand the concept\nof being able to use a NAT,\n\n814\n00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,670\nor a port address translation,\nor a PAT solution.\n\n815\n00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,650\nTo be able to effectively proxy or\nsomehow hide the internal architecture,\n\n816\n00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,300\nthe internal IP address.\n\n817\n00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,570\nWe're talking about a NAT solution.\n\n818\n00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,010\nWe're talking about PAT,\n\n819\n00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,240\nwe're hiding the port that we are\nconnecting to by doing a port translation.\n\n820\n00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,550\nMaking it appear we're coming out of\nsomewhere else and translating that.\n\n821\n00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:42,530\nAnd so as a result, we are going\nto really focus on the spoofing.\n\n822\n00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,155\nAnd when I say spoofing, I mean it\nvery generically in the sense that we\n\n823\n00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:49,965\nare effectively changing the address\nwe originate from, swapping it for\n\n824\n00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:51,572\nanother address of some kind.\n\n825\n00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:56,118\n>> And in effect, just simply wrapping\nour packet in an external secondary\n\n826\n00:39:56,118 --> 00:40:00,888\naddress wrapper that allows us to pretend,\nhence the concept of the spoof or\n\n827\n00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:04,830\nmasquerade, another way\nof thinking about it.\n\n828\n00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,150\nPretend that we are coming from\nanother origination point.\n\n829\n00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:12,590\nAnd what this allows us to do is\nmask our internal addressing scheme.\n\n830\n00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,060\nSo just be aware of\nthe concept of natting and\n\n831\n00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,020\nor patting network and/or address trans,\nnetwork address translation and/or\n\n832\n00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,810\nport address translation as we\ntalk through some of this content.\n\n833\n00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,620\nWe do see a lot of NAT solutions\nout there, it's popular for\n\n834\n00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,860\nyou to spend everything that's used in\nyour home devices, for instance, right.\n\n835\n00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,128\nYou're natting through your, ISP based\nwireless router, or whatever you get.\n\n836\n00:40:33,128 --> 00:40:34,770\n>> You wanna.\nThey give me one public IP address.\n\n837\n00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,540\nI have several devices that need\nto get out to the internet.\n\n838\n00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,470\n>> Absolutely.\n\n839\n00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,105\nAs all good secondary\nresellers of bandwidth will.\n\n840\n00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:41,825\nRight.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n841\n00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:42,529\n>> You obviously wanna share\n\n842\n00:40:42,529 --> 00:40:43,139\nthat with the masses.\n\n843\n00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:46,074\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You do need more than one publicly\n\n844\n00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:47,535\nroutable IP address.\n\n845\n00:40:47,535 --> 00:40:52,037\nBut as a result we can use NAT in order\nto be able to effectively give multiple\n\n846\n00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:56,324\ndevices behind the router right behind\nthe box in effect the wireless or\n\n847\n00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:59,540\nwired router device that is\nacting as our firewall and\n\n848\n00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,560\neverything else that\nthe cable company gives us.\n\n849\n00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,218\n>> Right.\n\n850\n00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:05,530\n>> We're gonna then be able to use\nthat to effectively go out and\n\n851\n00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:10,210\nto have one identity the external public\nIP on the WAN side of the device.\n\n852\n00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,670\nBut that effectively proxies on\nbehalf of multiple devices inside.\n\n853\n00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,117\nAnd maybe your neighbors as well\nif they are borrowing your.\n\n854\n00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:20,465\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Ill gotten gains there on the internet.\n\n855\n00:41:20,465 --> 00:41:21,750\n>> I've noticed some slow\ntimes in the evenings there.\n\n856\n00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,899\nI think they're doing some Netflix-\n>> Could potentially be streaming there\n\n857\n00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,200\nwithout your prior knowledge\nand/or your permission.\n\n858\n00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,909\nYou gotta put that disclaimer\nup on the network there and\n\n859\n00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:32,108\nmake sure they sign off\non that usage policy.\n\n860\n00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:33,269\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Before you let them on.\n\n861\n00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:36,720\nAll right, so having said that,\nlet's scroll up a little bit.\n\n862\n00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,140\nLet's take a look at some of the ports\nthat we've identified there.\n\n863\n00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,492\nWe do have a long, laundry list of ports\nthat we are gonna recommend that you do\n\n864\n00:41:42,492 --> 00:41:45,090\nwanna, make sure you take a look\nat that them that you know.\n\n865\n00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:48,450\nI think it may be too big to fit\nthe whole thing on the screen.\n\n866\n00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,300\nI don't know if we have\nanymore at the bottom.\n\n867\n00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,520\nI don't remember what was down below.\n\n868\n00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,420\nSo we may have to do this in two parts.\n\n869\n00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,200\nAnd what we're gonna do is just,\nbasically, show you and\n\n870\n00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,780\nrecommend you that you take\na look of what's on this list.\n\n871\n00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,660\nIt's by no means an authoritative list.\n\n872\n00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,180\nIt is not exhaustive.\n\n873\n00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:03,860\n>> Right.\n\n874\n00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,720\n>> In the sense that there is more\nto the ports and the services and\n\n875\n00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,780\nthe systems that you may want to identify.\n\n876\n00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,200\nThese are fairly common ones.\n\n877\n00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,900\nThey are certainly ones that\nyou want to be aware of.\n\n878\n00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,920\nThey are ones that if you're asked to\nanswer some questions would be good for\n\n879\n00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,300\nyou to be aware of.\n\n880\n00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,720\nI'm not gonna walk through\nwhat every one of these does.\n\n881\n00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,250\nActually IRC is the last one, isn't it?\n\n882\n00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,010\nI think so.\n\n883\n00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,301\nSo I think we just did manage to get the\nwhole thing on there and so, except for\n\n884\n00:42:27,301 --> 00:42:30,646\nTelNet, but we don't really care about\nTellNet anyway cuz it's insecure so\n\n885\n00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:31,540\nwho cares, right.\n\n886\n00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,210\nSo other then TellNet,\neverything's on the screen.\n\n887\n00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,550\nSo what we do wanna do is make\nsure you are familiar with them.\n\n888\n00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,550\nWhat I would recommend is that you know\nthe protocol name, whatever it is.\n\n889\n00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,834\nYou know the port number we've\nspecified there, so for instance for\n\n890\n00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,770\nSMTP we'd want to know it's port 25.\n\n891\n00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:51,180\nYou'll see it runs on either TCP,\nUDP or both in some cases.\n\n892\n00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:56,590\nAnd so we, you may wanna make that\ndistinction and be aware of that as well.\n\n893\n00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,990\nRPC is a good example of that\ndown towards the bottom.\n\n894\n00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,610\nCertainly DNS is on there somewhere.\n\n895\n00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,710\nGood example of that.\n\n896\n00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,890\nAnd also I think FTP\nis on there somewhere.\n\n897\n00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,470\nGood example of using both up\ntowards the top I think, right.\n\n898\n00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:11,198\nIt's a good thing we didn't do it\nalphabetically and have any rhyme or\n\n899\n00:43:11,198 --> 00:43:11,752\nreason to it or\n\n900\n00:43:11,752 --> 00:43:14,825\nchronologically based on the port numbers\nso that we would have them in order.\n\n901\n00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Lord knows that would have made sense.\n\n902\n00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,010\nThat's what happens when you\nfree associate for the list and\n\n903\n00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,740\nsomebody says we need that port list.\n\n904\n00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,200\nWhat should we put on that.\n\n905\n00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,960\nAnd you rattle off 20 ports and\nyou don't do them in order.\n\n906\n00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,170\nSo but you do wanna know and you do wanna\nmake sure that you're familiar with these.\n\n907\n00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,560\nAnd remember the one that is up at the top\nTellNet which is gonna be there as well.\n\n908\n00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,670\nSo you wanna make sure that we\nhave TellNet there and SSH.\n\n909\n00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,290\nI don't know if SSHwas on top but\nTellNet that as well.\n\n910\n00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,640\nSo TCP port 23.\n\n911\n00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,620\nSo do make some notes on these right.\n\n912\n00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,990\nMake sure you're familiar with them.\n\n913\n00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,600\nI think flash cards, I've said this\nat least in one other episode.\n\n914\n00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,100\nGreat way to study,\nit could be helpful for you.\n\n915\n00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,670\nDon't know for sure, but\nyou may want to think about that.\n\n916\n00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,700\nThere's apps out there to do flashcards\ntoday [CROSSTALK] could make it a group\n\n917\n00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,550\nactivity, get your kids involved,\nhave them throw port numbers at you.\n\n918\n00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,718\nThrow back a protocol, talk to strangers,\ngreat way to meet people.\n\n919\n00:44:03,718 --> 00:44:06,704\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hey, I got this thing going on,\n\n920\n00:44:06,704 --> 00:44:09,120\nmaybe you could help me for a few minutes.\n\n921\n00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,470\nMake sure you're on a bus or something\nwhere they can't get away from you easily.\n\n922\n00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,428\nAnd you might be able to get some help.\n\n923\n00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:16,345\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So can't really go anywhere,\n\n924\n00:44:16,345 --> 00:44:17,660\nthought we spend a few minutes.\n\n925\n00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,880\nAnd hey, if I've got a party activity\nthat we could engage in, right.\n\n926\n00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,430\nBut however you get there, whatever you\ndo, make sure you test yourself and\n\n927\n00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,370\nobviously remember what those ports are.\n\n928\n00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,250\nWill be important.\n\n929\n00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,125\nYou wanna know them.\n\n930\n00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:32,000\n[SOUND] Wanna make sure you know those\nprotocols that are associated with them.\n\n931\n00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,930\nThese are typically the common ones,\nright.\n\n932\n00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,420\nThere's many more but\n\n933\n00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,235\nif you notice the range that these\nare in almost without exception.\n\n934\n00:44:38,235 --> 00:44:40,425\nThey're in the well-known\nport ranges we talked about.\n\n935\n00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:43,335\nSome of them will be in the registered\nport range as opposed to dynamic.\n\n936\n00:44:43,335 --> 00:44:46,285\nBut notice there are no\ndynamic ports on this list,\n\n937\n00:44:46,285 --> 00:44:50,705\nnothing up in the 40,000, 45,000 rather,\nplus range all the way up to the top.\n\n938\n00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:53,985\nEverything is in either the well-known or\nthe dynamic in the middle tier.\n\n939\n00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:57,895\nAnd mainly things like RDP,\nfor instance and RADIUS.\n\n940\n00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,848\nActually, it's just really RDP.\n\n941\n00:44:59,848 --> 00:45:03,460\nThat are gonna be up in that\nrange up in the dynamic area,\n\n942\n00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,920\neven though it is a dedicated\nrather registered, excuse me.\n\n943\n00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,930\nNot in the dynamic,\nrather a registered port.\n\n944\n00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:12,340\nThe rest are gonna be, yeah, MS Sequel\nis also a registered port, right?\n\n945\n00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,960\nRadius, I think I mentioned a minute ago.\n\n946\n00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,980\nBut, other than those, everything else is\ngonna be sitting in that well known area.\n\n947\n00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,720\nRight down at the bottom,\nor rather up at the top so\n\n948\n00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,720\njust be aware of that and make sure you're\nfocused on those as we go through here.\n\n949\n00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,450\nAll right, so now that we've done our\nports, right, we've given everybody\n\n950\n00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:31,030\na chance to take a look, let's take\na look at some of the data link layer and\n\n951\n00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:34,050\nwe'll work our way through and\nsee network security layer etc.\n\n952\n00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,800\nSo we're mapping back to the OSI model,\nwe're drilling back in.\n\n953\n00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,992\n>> And maybe we could throw the graphic,\n>> Yeah.\n\n954\n00:45:38,992 --> 00:45:41,801\n>> Of the OSI model up real quick just\nas a visual to remind you, right.\n\n955\n00:45:41,801 --> 00:45:44,128\nSo we have our seven layer model here,\n\n956\n00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:47,580\nright we talked about this in\none of our other episodes.\n\n957\n00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,016\nWe have our physical followed by\ndata link where again we're going up\n\n958\n00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:50,650\nfrom the bottom.\n\n959\n00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,392\nAnd we have our data link layer.\n\n960\n00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:54,088\nWe have our network layer.\n\n961\n00:45:54,088 --> 00:45:57,151\nWe have our transport layer.\n\n962\n00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:01,090\nWe have our session layer, right.\n\n963\n00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:05,060\nAnd then we have our presentation\nlayer in that bright, beautiful red.\n\n964\n00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,104\nIt's hurting my eyes.\n\n965\n00:46:06,104 --> 00:46:08,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then we have application, right.\n\n966\n00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,740\nSo we have our seven layers.\n\n967\n00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,750\nIf we go top to bottom, bottom to top,\nit doesn't really matter which.\n\n968\n00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,580\nWe'll talk about some mnemonics and\n\n969\n00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,070\nmemory devices that may be helpful,\nhelp us remember that.\n\n970\n00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,640\nI shared one yesterday.\n\n971\n00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,968\nI won't put Mike on the spot cuz\nI didn't ask him to prepare.\n\n972\n00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:25,296\n>> No, I've got a couple layers, and\none is if I go from the top down,\n\n973\n00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:27,389\nall people seem to need delicious pizza.\n\n974\n00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:28,203\n>> Okay good.\n\n975\n00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:30,934\n>> I had somebody tell me we\nshould make it more technical, so\n\n976\n00:46:30,934 --> 00:46:33,462\nwe went with all people seem\nto need data processing.\n\n977\n00:46:33,462 --> 00:46:35,447\n>> Okay.\n\n978\n00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:37,362\n>> I have a thing for food.\n\n979\n00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:37,870\n>> Okay.\n\n980\n00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,020\n>> So the other one is if you\ncan start from the bottom up.\n\n981\n00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:45,730\nPlease don't what is it,\nplease do not throw sausage pizza away.\n\n982\n00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,770\n>> Please do not throw sausage pizza away.\n\n983\n00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,511\nSo that's good that's almost like\nwe can do that for Paula Abdul too.\n\n984\n00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:51,636\n>> Yeah that's right, I like that.\n\n985\n00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,518\nMine is please don't-\n>> Please do not.\n\n986\n00:46:53,518 --> 00:46:54,840\n>> Please don't throw Paula Abdul away.\n\n987\n00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,538\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Doesn't quite match up though,\n\n988\n00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:57,100\nright, so, right.\n\n989\n00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,420\n>> You could find a couple\nof things to see.\n\n990\n00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,340\n>> But mine was, right, there were and\n\n991\n00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,120\nmine was, people do not need\nto see Paula Abdul, right.\n\n992\n00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,050\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n993\n00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,580\nyou come up with all sorts of\ndifferent ones, whatever it is.\n\n994\n00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,170\nBut do come up with some\nway some how some mechanism\n\n995\n00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,690\nto help you remember the OSI model.\n\n996\n00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,520\nWe're gonna flip back to\nour discussion here and\n\n997\n00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,570\nstart layering in some\nprotocols on these layers.\n\n998\n00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:19,260\nWe want you to have that idea in your mind\nof what this looks like and making sure,\n\n999\n00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,360\nas we talk about, these layers that\nyou're really thinking through.\n\n1000\n00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,090\nWhat happens at each of these.\n\n1001\n00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,850\nSo we look at the data links security\nlayer data link layer security\n\n1002\n00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,160\nprotocols I should say.\n\n1003\n00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,760\nWe find things like PPTP point\nto point tunnelling protocol.\n\n1004\n00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,410\nWe find L2F layer two forwarding which\nis a Cisco proprietary protocol.\n\n1005\n00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:44,340\nWe combine PPTP with L2TF and\nwe get L2TP layer two tunnelling protocol.\n\n1006\n00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,897\nSo that is a mix of a Cisco\nproprietary protocol,\n\n1007\n00:47:48,897 --> 00:47:52,240\nplus an Internet standard, EPTP.\n\n1008\n00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,560\nI think I might have had a little bit\ntoo much espresso after lunch, but\n\n1009\n00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,820\na PPTP plus L2F solution.\n\n1010\n00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,130\nIs how we actually came up\nwith Layer 2 Tunnelling.\n\n1011\n00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,770\nSo we'll talk some more about that.\n\n1012\n00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:07,330\nWe have the MPLS, the Multi\nProtocol Label Switching Solution,\n\n1013\n00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,230\nwhich also lives at the data link layer.\n\n1014\n00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:13,290\nThese would be found in\nLayer 2 of the OSI model.\n\n1015\n00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,450\nAnd while we want to have\na general understanding of these,\n\n1016\n00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:18,350\nwe wanna make sure we understand\nwhat they are, what they do.\n\n1017\n00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:21,400\nWe'll give you a brief history\non these in just a second.\n\n1018\n00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,150\nWant to most importantly take away from\nthe fact that we map them to Layer 2\n\n1019\n00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,110\nof the OSI model.\n\n1020\n00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,000\nPPTP was Microsoft's proprietary protocol\nthat they came out with in order to do\n\n1021\n00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,350\ntheir tunneling in their solutions,\npoint to point tunneling.\n\n1022\n00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:39,205\nAnd while it was really designed\nto do support for dial-up and\n\n1023\n00:48:39,205 --> 00:48:43,510\nVPN's, that kind of thing, dial-up VPN\nis what it was really designed for.\n\n1024\n00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:48,210\nSupports authentication,\nsupports encryption so it does both.\n\n1025\n00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,400\nIt was proprietary.\n\n1026\n00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,350\nIt was unique to Microsoft and couldn't\nuse it outside of the Microsoft world.\n\n1027\n00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:57,760\nL2F was Cisco's version of that\ntheoretically at the Layer 2 level.\n\n1028\n00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,450\nIt was their proprietary solution.\n\n1029\n00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,090\nTo deal with some of their upper layer,\n\n1030\n00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:06,330\nlower level requirements within the OSI\nmodel, and, broker those conversations,\n\n1031\n00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,080\nand help to do authentication\nbetween devices.\n\n1032\n00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,280\nThere was no encryption\nassociated with L2F,\n\n1033\n00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,660\nwhich was one of the issues that\nled us to combine the two together.\n\n1034\n00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,690\nCuz L2F by itself was good,\nbut it had no encryption, so\n\n1035\n00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,620\nit would send everything in the clear.\n\n1036\n00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,390\nAnd so what we then get is to get\nan industry standard together, that would\n\n1037\n00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:29,230\nallow everybody non-proprietary,\nnon-linked to a certain vendor,\n\n1038\n00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:33,120\nto be able to implement something\nthat was both secure and functional.\n\n1039\n00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,050\nWe combine the two and\n\n1040\n00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:38,660\ncome up with L2TP, which is going to\nbe the Layer 2 Tunnelling solution.\n\n1041\n00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,728\nThe RFC for L2TP, might or\nmight not want to know that,\n\n1042\n00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,993\nnot important for\nyou in terms of answering questions, but\n\n1043\n00:49:44,993 --> 00:49:49,129\nit may just be one of those things\nthat you are familiar with, is 2661.\n\n1044\n00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:52,940\nThat I have written down\nthere in my notes 2661.\n\n1045\n00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,460\nAnd that is the RFC for L2TP.\n\n1046\n00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,650\nAnd you can go out and find those,\nobviously, if you really want to.\n\n1047\n00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:02,470\nThere's a version three of\nL2TP that was more recent.\n\n1048\n00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:08,360\nAnd that is RFC 3931, so L2TP version two,\n\n1049\n00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,948\nand then RFC for\nL2TP version three, that was 3931.\n\n1050\n00:50:12,948 --> 00:50:17,241\n[CROSSTALK] 3931 is version three.\n\n1051\n00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:22,386\nJust wanna make sure that we are thinking\nabout that, have a sense of that,\n\n1052\n00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:26,959\nunderstand what that is, L2TP,\nLayer 2 Tunnelling Protocol,\n\n1053\n00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:31,920\nthat allows us to be able to send\ninformation through this tunnel.\n\n1054\n00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,620\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n1055\n00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:38,620\nuse a solution that is seen as being\nmore secure at the data link layer.\n\n1056\n00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,040\nJust be aware of that.\n\n1057\n00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,870\nLayer 2 protocols like\nthis are being used for\n\n1058\n00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:47,430\nsecure solutions throughout\nbusinesses all over the world today.\n\n1059\n00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:50,490\nAnd they are very effective that, but\n\n1060\n00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:53,250\nwe may move higher up\nthe levels in the OSM model.\n\n1061\n00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,520\nWanna impact and\n\n1062\n00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,470\nimplement security at a different level,\nas a result we may need other protocols.\n\n1063\n00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:02,470\nLet's move up beyond the data link\nlayer I think we're gonna talk about\n\n1064\n00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:06,100\nnetwork security protocols next,\nat the network layer, right?\n\n1065\n00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,810\nMoving up into Layer 3 of the OSI model.\n\n1066\n00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,710\nWhat we have is the ability to be able to\ngo in and we can see we have GRE there,\n\n1067\n00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,780\nwhich is the generic route encapsulation.\n\n1068\n00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,440\nSolution.\n\n1069\n00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,410\nGRE stands for\ngeneric route encapsulation.\n\n1070\n00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,770\nAnd so what GRE does is it's\na generic tunneling protocol.\n\n1071\n00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:32,330\nAnd what it basically does is\nit will encapsulate tunnel\n\n1072\n00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:36,270\na wide variety of traffic inside\nof an IP tunneling packet, so\n\n1073\n00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:40,900\nlets us move a variety of different kinds\nof traffic inside of an IP tunnel, so\n\n1074\n00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,130\nthat's what it effectively does,\nit is almost like a Swiss army knife,\n\n1075\n00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,879\nit can tunnel almost everything or\nanything that you could think of.\n\n1076\n00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,200\nGRE is very useful because it allows\nus to move a lot of traffic that might\n\n1077\n00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,150\notherwise not be able to\ncross through interfaces,\n\n1078\n00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,850\nbecause it is not moving in a tunnel\nout and then in to a tunnel.\n\n1079\n00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:01,160\nIt was developed by Cisco, so\nagain, one of those Cisco things.\n\n1080\n00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,990\nThey tend to be behind\na lot of this stuff.\n\n1081\n00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,300\nAnd it was considered to be, or\nwas designed to be stateless.\n\n1082\n00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,360\nMeaning that the endpoints\ndid not monitor and\n\n1083\n00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,680\ndid not keep track of the availability\nof the other tunnel endpoints.\n\n1084\n00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,040\nYou would connect and\njust kind of best of luck.\n\n1085\n00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,085\nSee you on the other side kind of thing.\n\n1086\n00:52:19,085 --> 00:52:20,325\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> May or may not be there.\n\n1087\n00:52:20,325 --> 00:52:21,659\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, but as a result,\n\n1088\n00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:24,724\nwe didn't keep track,\nit wasn't a state full protocol,\n\n1089\n00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:28,291\nit was a state less protocol and\nwe did not keep track of the up state or\n\n1090\n00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:30,270\nthe down state of the end points.\n\n1091\n00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:33,640\nWe would just connect out and\nuse our best select to connect and\n\n1092\n00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,670\nwhen we found that point,\nwe could then obviously tunnel.\n\n1093\n00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,700\nIf we did not, we would fail and\nit try again in effect.\n\n1094\n00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,830\nGRE is out there, it's seen as\na network security protocol at Layer 3.\n\n1095\n00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,380\nIn addition,\n\n1096\n00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:49,100\nwe also have IPSec probably the most\ncommon of the network security protocols.\n\n1097\n00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,640\nHopefully everyone has some\npassing familiarity of IPSec.\n\n1098\n00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,590\nI know that we have a URL there\nthat we put into the notes for\n\n1099\n00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:59,930\nyou which is a diagram that we're going\nto, put up and we're gonna zoom in on and\n\n1100\n00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,660\ntalk a little bit, there we go,\nzoomed right over our heads.\n\n1101\n00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,580\nTalk a little bit about it,\nwe do have some building blocks, so\n\n1102\n00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:11,355\nmaybe we can go back to the notes for just\none second and just talk about the parts.\n\n1103\n00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,185\nThen we'll come back and\nwe'll take a look at the diagram,\n\n1104\n00:53:13,185 --> 00:53:16,135\nbut we did list out the parts here for\nyou.\n\n1105\n00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:19,730\nWe have the Which are called\nthe Authentication Headers.\n\n1106\n00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:24,135\nThis is gonna provide integrity, you may\njust want to note that in relation to what\n\n1107\n00:53:24,135 --> 00:53:28,645\nwe're doing, that we focus on\nintegrity for authentication here, and\n\n1108\n00:53:28,645 --> 00:53:31,335\nthen our authentication headers\nare providing integrity.\n\n1109\n00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:34,205\nWe then have\nEncapsulation Security Payload, ESP.\n\n1110\n00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:36,190\nThis provides confidentiality.\n\n1111\n00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,090\nThis is where we do encryption, right.\n\n1112\n00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,130\nIf we choose to provide encryption\nthis is where we will do it.\n\n1113\n00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,830\nWe have the Security Association, the SA,\n\n1114\n00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:49,570\nwhich is a one-way negotiated\nagreement for connectivity.\n\n1115\n00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:55,570\nAnd so, what I mean by that is a one-way\nnegotiated agreement for connectivity.\n\n1116\n00:53:55,570 --> 00:54:00,060\nAnd so what I mean by that is we must have\nan SA establish in each direction for\n\n1117\n00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,880\nthe connection for\neach party as part of the process.\n\n1118\n00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,750\nAnd this is the agreement that we\nnegotiated in order to allow us\n\n1119\n00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,320\nto effectively connect when we use IPSec.\n\n1120\n00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,030\nWe have two SA's, one in each direction\nbetween, lets say, Mike and I.\n\n1121\n00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:16,020\nIf I was connected to Mike using IPSec,\nI'd have to negotiate an SA going\n\n1122\n00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,750\nthis way, and Mike would have to\nnegotiate one coming back this way.\n\n1123\n00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:23,190\nAnd we would each effectively have\nan ability to connect as a result of that.\n\n1124\n00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:28,150\nWe do see IPSec being\nimplemented in one of two modes.\n\n1125\n00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:32,460\nSo we see down there as Max is\ntyping out a little sub-note there,\n\n1126\n00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,985\nwe have transport mode and or tunnel mode,\nand these are the ways, the mechanisms,\n\n1127\n00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,645\nthe ways in which we implement IPSec.\n\n1128\n00:54:39,645 --> 00:54:45,805\nAnd so what we often say about IPSec is\nthat we transport up to the router and\n\n1129\n00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:49,385\nthen we tunnel through the router as a way\nof remembering how we implement these.\n\n1130\n00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:55,410\nAnd so transport mode is used on the LAN\nside up to the LAN side of the router.\n\n1131\n00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,900\nUp to the LAN side of the connectivity\ndevice in other words.\n\n1132\n00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:02,300\nSo we transport between end points on\nthe LAN, our transport mode, right?\n\n1133\n00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,700\nWe tunnel between end points, meaning\ntunnel between routers specifically,\n\n1134\n00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,300\non the WAN.\n\n1135\n00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,530\nAnd so,\ntunnel mode is really implemented between.\n\n1136\n00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:15,650\nEnd points on a WAN which\nwill be our routers, and so\n\n1137\n00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,930\nwe want to just make sure we\nunderstand the differences there, and\n\n1138\n00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,850\njust understand how we're identifying and\nimplementing those.\n\n1139\n00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,590\nAnd then we have IKE,\nwhich is gonna represent the key exchange.\n\n1140\n00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:27,901\nThe Internet Key Exchange is the process\nwe actually engage in to be able to\n\n1141\n00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:33,060\nNegotiate the implementation of IPSec and\nthe process of implementing them securely.\n\n1142\n00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:37,395\nSo we have Oakley which is one of\nthe security protocols that is used,\n\n1143\n00:55:37,395 --> 00:55:40,929\nas in Oakley like the sun-glass\nmanufacturer Oakley.\n\n1144\n00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:41,649\nIn order to be able to do this.\n\n1145\n00:55:41,649 --> 00:55:43,427\nAnd we have ISAKMP.\n\n1146\n00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:49,213\nI-S-A-K-M-P.\n\n1147\n00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:50,014\nISAKMP.\n\n1148\n00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:54,330\nWe just call it ISAKMP, but\nit's the secured key exchange protocol.\n\n1149\n00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:58,580\nAnd so we are using these two\nsubportions of IKE as a process\n\n1150\n00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:02,670\nto be able to effectively exchange and\nnegotiate the exchange of these keys.\n\n1151\n00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,960\nAnd so these are all the building\nblocks that go into IPsec.\n\n1152\n00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,130\nAnd so what we want to do quickly\nis bring up that graphic and\n\n1153\n00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,720\nI know that we had it there a minute ago,\nwhen we zoom back in and\n\n1154\n00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,740\njust talk a little bit there we go,\nperfect.\n\n1155\n00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,680\nJust talk a little bit about this to show\nyou more or less what's going on here.\n\n1156\n00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,110\nAnd so what we see on the left is we see\nComputer A, on the right Computer B.\n\n1157\n00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:26,120\nNow in Windows, this is to be fair and\njust to be a transparent here,\n\n1158\n00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,980\nthis is off of one of the Microsoft\nwebsites we gave you the URL so\n\n1159\n00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,820\nthis is from their documentation.\n\n1160\n00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,040\nSo obviously when we're talking about this\nand I mention the fact that IPsec can\n\n1161\n00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,830\nbe manage in a Microsoft\nimplementation through policy, right.\n\n1162\n00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,390\nWe can see this potentially be\nmanage through group policy or\n\n1163\n00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,760\nthe network shell that\nwe can use to manage it.\n\n1164\n00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,180\nFor instance we could set this up with\nSSH and we can go on and this from netsh,\n\n1165\n00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,013\nwit is netsh, but\nspecifically netsh in the Microsoft world,\n\n1166\n00:56:51,013 --> 00:56:52,850\nmust be able to go in and do that, right?\n\n1167\n00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,010\nSo the command line shell.\n\n1168\n00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,560\nTalk about a good time on a Friday night,\nboy.\n\n1169\n00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,540\n>> I'll tell you what. [LAUGH] >> Wow,\nwhen you've got like nothing going on and\n\n1170\n00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,313\nyou wanna party like a big dog.\n\n1171\n00:57:01,313 --> 00:57:06,829\nSit down and do IPsec on Netsh, and\nyou are just gonna be loving life, right?\n\n1172\n00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:08,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> About two minutes in,\n\n1173\n00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,199\nyou're gonna be wishing you were anywhere\nelse, doing anything else in the world.\n\n1174\n00:57:13,462 --> 00:57:15,890\nBut y can do it in netsh as well,\nall kidding aside,\n\n1175\n00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,730\nand anything we do here in the graphical\ninterface would describe it and\n\n1176\n00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,110\nbe done from the command shell as well.\n\n1177\n00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,830\nWe're not gonna go through\nthe trouble of putting netsh up,\n\n1178\n00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,435\nand make you walk through.\n\n1179\n00:57:24,435 --> 00:57:26,140\n[LAUGH] Maybe I shouldn't have said that.\n\n1180\n00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,210\nMaybe walk through how to set this up,\nbut I would encourage you to\n\n1181\n00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,440\nat least take a look at it,\npull it up look at the help file.\n\n1182\n00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,290\nTake a look at the fact that you\ncan do all sorts of stuff there.\n\n1183\n00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,485\nAnything to do in the graphical\ninterface can be done through netsh.\n\n1184\n00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,770\nSo Computer A on the left,\nComputer B on the right.\n\n1185\n00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:42,925\nSo you'll see we have the TCP/UDP\ntransport layer there.\n\n1186\n00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:47,375\nWe have the IPsec driver which is injected\ninto the network stack in order to be able\n\n1187\n00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:51,645\nto do IPsecs, what actually effectively\ncreates the ability to do IPsec.\n\n1188\n00:57:51,645 --> 00:57:52,735\nWe have, as you can see,\n\n1189\n00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:56,485\nthe SA negotiations going between\nIKE at the top on either side.\n\n1190\n00:57:56,485 --> 00:58:00,145\nSo IKE, the key exchange, is the process\nthat actually creates the SAs and\n\n1191\n00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:01,490\nnegotiates them for us.\n\n1192\n00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:03,740\nWe have the SA negotiation going back and\nforth.\n\n1193\n00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,660\nWe have an SA key pair in\neffect attached to each side.\n\n1194\n00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:10,970\nThat's our SA, our agreement in order\nto be able to talk back how we do that.\n\n1195\n00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:12,320\nResults from the negotiation.\n\n1196\n00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,295\nSo it is effectively the thing that\nallows us to engage in the use of IP Sec.\n\n1197\n00:58:17,295 --> 00:58:18,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1198\n00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:19,760\n>> And so that is negotiated there.\n\n1199\n00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,700\nAnd then you can see at the bottom,\nas we go out the stack, effectively\n\n1200\n00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,340\nwe are using secure IP packets, the\ninternet layer because we are sending that\n\n1201\n00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,770\nIP security traffic out and we are then\ngoing to see it go back and forth.\n\n1202\n00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:36,310\nNow whether we decide to\napply authentication headers\n\n1203\n00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:40,260\nwe decide to apply ESP,\nEeapsulating security payload, and\n\n1204\n00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:44,420\nwe decide to apply one or\nthe other, or both is up to us.\n\n1205\n00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,680\nBut IPsec, natively, out of the box,\ngenerically, without us making that\n\n1206\n00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,580\ndistinction, does not encrypt and\ndoes not provide authentication.\n\n1207\n00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,630\n>> It's just a tunnel.\n\n1208\n00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,575\n>> It is just a tunnel,\na dark scary tunnel, right?\n\n1209\n00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:56,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nothing at the other end that\n\n1210\n00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:01,120\nwe can see, but what it basically does\nis simply provide a mechanism for\n\n1211\n00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,940\nus to move information, but\n\n1212\n00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,670\nit may not be the most secure mechanism\ndepending on how we configure it.\n\n1213\n00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:10,119\nSo we do need to be aware of\nthe fact that that is an option,\n\n1214\n00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:14,950\nknow that ESP, encapsulate security\npayload, know that Authentication headers\n\n1215\n00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,830\nare not necessarily going\nto be enabled by default.\n\n1216\n00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,690\nDepends on how you would set this up.\n\n1217\n00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,580\nAn IPsec has a couple\nof different options.\n\n1218\n00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:25,700\nWe can require IPsec,\nmandate it in the network in which case we\n\n1219\n00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,795\nare not talking to a secure IPsec enable\nthen point, we drop the communication.\n\n1220\n00:59:29,795 --> 00:59:33,185\nWe could require it, in other words,\nwe could recommend it.\n\n1221\n00:59:33,185 --> 00:59:37,755\nSay, we'd like to use it, so we could\nrequest and we could negotiate down to\n\n1222\n00:59:37,755 --> 00:59:40,932\na common baseline and\nsay we'll do our best effort and try.\n\n1223\n00:59:40,932 --> 00:59:43,292\nSo we have different ways of\nimplementing this, right?\n\n1224\n00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:47,772\nSo you wanna make sure you\nunderstand both for the server or\n\n1225\n00:59:47,772 --> 00:59:50,822\nlet's say the endpoint, whatever we're\ntalking to in the origination point,\n\n1226\n00:59:50,822 --> 00:59:53,880\nthat we have to make sure we\nunderstand how IPsec is configured.\n\n1227\n00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,690\nAnd if we have a mismatch where one\nparty is configured to require only and\n\n1228\n00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:03,690\nanother party is configured using request\nonly, then it will probably work.\n\n1229\n01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:07,760\nBut if we have a require only and do not\nuse, cuz that is an option don't use it.\n\n1230\n01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,920\n>> Yep.\n>> We have that, we're not talking.\n\n1231\n01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,700\nWe are but we're not talking\nabout anything important.\n\n1232\n01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,490\nWe're talking about not talking,\nso effectively we don't talk.\n\n1233\n01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,580\nSo you do wanna make sure\nyou do understand that and\n\n1234\n01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,798\nthat you're aware of that as well.\n\n1235\n01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:22,245\nSo all of this as we said is going\nto be found at the network layer.\n\n1236\n01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:26,675\nThese are layer 3, OSI model functions.\n\n1237\n01:00:26,675 --> 01:00:28,770\nWanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n1238\n01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:33,970\nIf I was you, as I prepare to get ready to\nbecome an SSCP, look out at the wonderful,\n\n1239\n01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:38,630\nwide world of tunneling protocols and\nlayer 3 network security.\n\n1240\n01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:43,470\nAnd I look at the functionality, and\nI'm focused on something like IPsec, and\n\n1241\n01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,660\nI wanna understand it.\n\n1242\n01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,160\nI would wanna make sure I can run through\nthe discussion that we just had with you.\n\n1243\n01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,360\nI would wanna be able to do that one\nminute spiel as we call it on IPsec,\n\n1244\n01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,345\nexplain at a high level how that works.\n\n1245\n01:00:54,345 --> 01:00:59,350\nAnd I wanna make sure or that I would\nwant to make sure that I understood\n\n1246\n01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:03,930\nall the component parts, the parts of\nthe recipe here that we've put out on\n\n1247\n01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:06,150\nthe section here for you in the notes.\n\n1248\n01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:09,540\nAnd Mike was just adding a couple of\nlast minute items in here to make sure\n\n1249\n01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,180\nthat you capture all that.\n\n1250\n01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:14,360\nBut authentication headers,\nencapsulated security payloads,\n\n1251\n01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,990\nsecurity associations,\ntransport in tunnel mode, IKE and\n\n1252\n01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:21,680\nthe two sub-components hopefully,\nand IC camp to do the key exchange.\n\n1253\n01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,250\nAnd that we can implement one, the other\nor both with AHCSP and/or nothing.\n\n1254\n01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,720\nWe could do nothing, one,\nor the other, or both.\n\n1255\n01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,890\nWe wanna make sure we know that,\nand then just be aware of that.\n\n1256\n01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:34,540\nThose are very important building\nblocks for you to focus on, and\n\n1257\n01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,320\nultimately to be aware of.\n\n1258\n01:01:38,405 --> 01:01:40,720\nAright, so we can go in and\n\n1259\n01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,000\nwe can make sure that when we think of\nIPsec we wanna make sure as we said,\n\n1260\n01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,890\nsupporter used devices that are supported,\nthat are gonna be using IPsec.\n\n1261\n01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:53,390\nAnd today it's hard to find things\nthat are not IPsec compatible.\n\n1262\n01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:56,320\nWhereas five, six, seven, ten years ago,\nit may have been a problem.\n\n1263\n01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,950\nYou had a lot of endpoints that\njust didn't understand IPsec.\n\n1264\n01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:01,885\n>> It's a really nice protocol to secure\nyour traffic, because it's so far down in\n\n1265\n01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,921\nthat OSI model, the applications don't\nhave to be aware of it, for the most part.\n\n1266\n01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:05,897\n>> Correct, right.\n\n1267\n01:02:05,897 --> 01:02:07,763\n>> Your application-\n>> Your networking stack,\n\n1268\n01:02:07,763 --> 01:02:08,997\nyour network devices-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1269\n01:02:08,997 --> 01:02:12,250\n>> Routers have to understand it,\nobviously, in layer three, right?\n\n1270\n01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,680\nSwitches have to understand\nit in layer two,\n\n1271\n01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,660\nthey have to be able to interact with it,\nand layer three switch certainly will.\n\n1272\n01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,935\nBut yeah, you're right, Adobe Acrobat\ndoesn't really care whether you're using\n\n1273\n01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:21,890\nIPsec or not, it has no knowledge of it.\n\n1274\n01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:22,430\nAnd rightly so,\n\n1275\n01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:25,400\nbecause it struggles enough just trying to\nfigure out how to do Adobe Acrobat stuff.\n\n1276\n01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,665\nSo, it shouldn't make it\neven more complicated.\n\n1277\n01:02:27,665 --> 01:02:28,430\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1278\n01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:30,470\n>> Just screw it up even worse, right?\n\n1279\n01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:31,890\nSo you just wanna make sure\nyou're thinking about that.\n\n1280\n01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:33,070\nBut Mike, raises a really good point.\n\n1281\n01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:35,380\nBecause it has slowed down in the stack.\n\n1282\n01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,840\nThis is again, awareness why the OSI\nmodel is so important to us, we have no\n\n1283\n01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,450\nawareness of the stuff that happens\nlower down, because we don't need to.\n\n1284\n01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:46,030\nWe figure out and understand that\nlower levels of the network model\n\n1285\n01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,700\nwill take care of that for us.\n\n1286\n01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,480\nThey basically obscure it, and so\nby the time we get up to the top,\n\n1287\n01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,780\nwe're really not interested in it.\n\n1288\n01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,870\nJust like the network layer, layer 3,\n\n1289\n01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:58,720\ndoesn't need to understand what an Adobe\nAcrobat PDF is in a PDF format because it\n\n1290\n01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,280\nhas no knowledge of that because that\ntranslation happens in the upper layer.\n\n1291\n01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,880\nIt's layer 6 and layer 7, and until we get\nup there it's just a bunch of bits of one\n\n1292\n01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,030\nand zeroes and meaningless data, that we\ndon't really look at in the number player.\n\n1293\n01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:10,730\nOther than it's a data packet.\n\n1294\n01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:15,080\nSo to certain form, this nice little\npackage, but what's in the package?\n\n1295\n01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,030\nFrom our perspective, totally irrelevant,\nwe don't really care.\n\n1296\n01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:20,530\nAll right, so that's actually really\ngood point, something to consider,\n\n1297\n01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,920\nI hadn't thought about it that way before.\n\n1298\n01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,670\nIt's actually like that a lot.\n\n1299\n01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:26,374\nAll right, let's see if we can squeeze in\ntransport layer security protocols there\n\n1300\n01:03:26,374 --> 01:03:27,782\nreal quick and maybe do those and\n\n1301\n01:03:27,782 --> 01:03:29,890\nget through that part cuz\nthose are not too big.\n\n1302\n01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:33,641\nSo you'll see there we have some transport\nlayers due to protocols listed for you.\n\n1303\n01:03:33,641 --> 01:03:35,707\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Things like SSH right so secure shells,\n\n1304\n01:03:35,707 --> 01:03:37,272\nwhere I was just talking about that.\n\n1305\n01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:37,992\n>> Right.\n>> With netsh.\n\n1306\n01:03:37,992 --> 01:03:38,816\nWe have SSL, that's Secure Socket Layer.\n\n1307\n01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:43,200\nOldie, but\na goodie from the Netscape days.\n\n1308\n01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,570\nWe have TLS,\nthe Transport Layer Security Protocol.\n\n1309\n01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:49,970\nWe have WTLS, which is\nWireless Transport Layer Security.\n\n1310\n01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:52,825\nAnd we have Socks solution,\nwhich is basically\n\n1311\n01:03:52,825 --> 01:03:56,105\na proxy solution generically that\nwe could start to begin to see.\n\n1312\n01:03:56,105 --> 01:03:59,465\nAnd see something like maybe\nSock solution sitting there.\n\n1313\n01:03:59,465 --> 01:04:02,685\nAnd so, these are protocols that\nagain just get pegged at this layer.\n\n1314\n01:04:02,685 --> 01:04:07,555\nWant to make sure we understand the fact\nthat when we put stuff at this layer,\n\n1315\n01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:12,155\nthe transport layer, we are talking about\nhow we are actually packaging up data.\n\n1316\n01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:15,155\nWrapping and securing it if\nwe're building a data packet.\n\n1317\n01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:19,100\nComing up the OSI model coming down\nthe model either way, we're wrapping or\n\n1318\n01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:19,910\nunwrapping.\n\n1319\n01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:23,200\nAnd we're starting to put that\nsecure wrapper around the data or\n\n1320\n01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,010\nunwind it if we\nare processing the packet up.\n\n1321\n01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,000\nAnd as a result,\n\n1322\n01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,180\nwe wanna make sure that we are just aware\nof the importance of these kinda protocols\n\n1323\n01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:37,530\nas layering solutions to add outer layer\nsecurity to our packets in that respect.\n\n1324\n01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:40,640\nBecause the application layer\nprotocols obviously are gonna do that\n\n1325\n01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,820\nfrom an application perspective.\n\n1326\n01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,825\nThis is gonna be the actual\nstructure of the data packets and\n\n1327\n01:04:43,825 --> 01:04:45,119\nwhat we're securing there, right?\n\n1328\n01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,889\nAnd so, Socks, we just socked the sock.\n\n1329\n01:04:46,889 --> 01:04:48,089\nWe don't really think\nof it as [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1330\n01:04:48,089 --> 01:04:55,490\nAll right, and so we have application\nlayer security protocols, as well.\n\n1331\n01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,980\nWe'll go ahead and\njust quickly talk through those.\n\n1332\n01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,810\nSo what we have there, things like,\nas you can see, Secure RPC,\n\n1333\n01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:06,900\nso just think about RPC, but\nthen think about secure RPC.\n\n1334\n01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:11,479\nA secure RPC solution will\nallow us to be able to use RPC.\n\n1335\n01:05:11,479 --> 01:05:12,982\nDuh, right?\n\n1336\n01:05:12,982 --> 01:05:13,790\nIn a secure way.\n\n1337\n01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,565\n[LAUGH] What more can we say about that?\n\n1338\n01:05:15,565 --> 01:05:17,360\n>> [LAUGH] I love when\nthey're easy like that.\n\n1339\n01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,720\n>> They are.\nSometimes it is just George Washington on\n\n1340\n01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,380\na white horse.\n\n1341\n01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,250\nAnd the white horse is white.\n\n1342\n01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,215\nThat's just how it works.\n\n1343\n01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:23,844\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So DNS-Sec as well,\n\n1344\n01:05:23,844 --> 01:05:25,560\nthe secure DNS solution.\n\n1345\n01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,180\nI think it's actually\nwritten with no dash.\n\n1346\n01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,940\nIt's just DNSSEC with no dash.\n\n1347\n01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:29,940\nIf I remember correctly.\n\n1348\n01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,090\nYeah, there we go.\n\n1349\n01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,957\nAnd so if you haven't really done\nany work with DNSSEC, if you're not\n\n1350\n01:05:33,957 --> 01:05:36,983\nreally familiar with it, then first of\nall shame on you cuz you should be.\n\n1351\n01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:38,224\nAnd you should go out and\n\n1352\n01:05:38,224 --> 01:05:41,960\nspend a little time understanding\na little bit more about DNSSEC.\n\n1353\n01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,830\nThis is gonna be important.\n\n1354\n01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:48,490\nFor instance, secure RPC,\nbased on DES encryption built around RPC,\n\n1355\n01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,820\nwrapping DES encryption in there.\n\n1356\n01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:54,020\nDES encryption has been\nseen by many to become\n\n1357\n01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:57,050\nsomething that potentially is gonna be\na liability, because it can be broken.\n\n1358\n01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:59,080\nWhich is why we moved to AES for instance.\n\n1359\n01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,500\nBut for something like this, it's okay,\n\n1360\n01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,760\nbecause it's not the sole\nthing we're relying on.\n\n1361\n01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,095\nThis is one of many things, so\nsecure RPC, important for what it is, but\n\n1362\n01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:10,100\nuses slightly older solutions.\n\n1363\n01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:14,430\nDNSSEC add security into\nDNS by adding extensions\n\n1364\n01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:17,560\nonto the DNS solution\nthat provides security.\n\n1365\n01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,020\nSo we extend that original\nauthentication regime and\n\n1366\n01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:24,450\noriginal name resolution regime\nwith adding some security in.\n\n1367\n01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:27,460\nSo, we do things like protect from\nDNS cache poisoning, for instance,\n\n1368\n01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,740\none of the key things DNSSEC does.\n\n1369\n01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,300\nAll answers to any queries that are issued\n\n1370\n01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,000\nthrough DNSSEC solutions\nare digitally signed.\n\n1371\n01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,180\nSo as a result we can prove, proof of\norigin and integrity around that so\n\n1372\n01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:44,080\nwe talked about digital signatures\nin one of our earlier episodes.\n\n1373\n01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,542\nSo the value of that there\nis gonna be very important.\n\n1374\n01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:51,300\nSo DNSSEC is something you want to\nbe aware of and secure MIME, S/MIME,\n\n1375\n01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,880\nwhich is the MIME messaging protocol but\nwith security added on.\n\n1376\n01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,610\nAgain, something that if you're not\nfamiliar with is focused on email\n\n1377\n01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,520\nsecurity.\n\n1378\n01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,835\nAnd so we want to just make\nsure that we know that MIME or\n\n1379\n01:07:00,835 --> 01:07:03,790\nS/MIME rather specifically is\nan email security solution,\n\n1380\n01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,420\none that is used to secure email systems.\n\n1381\n01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,830\nAll right, very good.\n\n1382\n01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:11,500\nSo I think we've covered all of\nthe major protocols and all the layers.\n\n1383\n01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,110\nI feel like I need to take oh, I don't\nknow what are we thinking, a two, three,\n\n1384\n01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:18,060\nfour minute break before we come back and\ntalk about some more stuff?\n\n1385\n01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,720\n>> Yeah, give you guys enough\ntime to hit the fridge and\n\n1386\n01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,480\nmake it back to the couch and\nwe'll do it again.\n\n1387\n01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,060\n>> Absolutely.\nSo what do we have coming up quickly?\n\n1388\n01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:23,637\nWhat's on the hit list?\n\n1389\n01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:24,693\nWe have wireless, huh?\n\n1390\n01:07:24,693 --> 01:07:26,120\n>> We are getting ready to\nget into wireless standard.\n\n1391\n01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:26,933\n>> All right, very good.\n\n1392\n01:07:26,933 --> 01:07:28,303\nSo we'll talk about some\nwireless stuff when we come back.\n\n1393\n01:07:28,303 --> 01:07:29,220\nAll right, see you then.\n\n1394\n01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:29,952\n>> All right.\n\n1395\n01:07:29,952 --> 01:07:37,653\n[MUSIC]\n\n1396\n01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,773\n>> All right, welcome back everybody,\n\n1397\n01:07:39,773 --> 01:07:42,431\nto our networking section\nof our SSCP content.\n\n1398\n01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:44,585\nWe're going to dive back\ninto more protocols, and\n\n1399\n01:07:44,585 --> 01:07:47,605\nI think this time we're going to head\nover to some wireless protocols.\n\n1400\n01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:52,390\n>> More protocols, wireless, I'm going to\ntake a look at the wild side, as they say.\n\n1401\n01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,710\n>> The wild side.\n>> Cut the wire and see what happens.\n\n1402\n01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:57,272\nSo, we're gonna spend some time talking\nthrough the wireless side of things,\n\n1403\n01:07:57,272 --> 01:07:58,086\nwhere we'll wrap-up.\n\n1404\n01:07:58,086 --> 01:08:02,520\nTake a look at H.323 gateways and\nthings like that.\n\n1405\n01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,790\nAnd just make sure we talk about voice\na little bit with SIP and finish up.\n\n1406\n01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,890\nAnd then super bonus will be in\nthe super round at that point.\n\n1407\n01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:12,720\nMike just told me, pulled me off to\nthe side before we came back on camera and\n\n1408\n01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,940\nsaid listen, I'm just dying\nto do this sub-netting thing.\n\n1409\n01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:20,720\nSo we're gonna have a fourth bonus round\nwhere we go in and talk about sub-netting.\n\n1410\n01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,461\n>> Absolutely, one of my favorites.\n\n1411\n01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:22,897\n>> I'm gonna turn Mike loose and\n\n1412\n01:08:22,897 --> 01:08:26,320\nsee what he can inflict on your minds\nwhen we talk about sub-netting.\n\n1413\n01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,570\nSo stay turned for that.\n\n1414\n01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,390\nIf we get done with this, obviously we'll\ncome back, we will talk about sub-netting.\n\n1415\n01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,510\nDidn't want you to think you\nwere gonna get off lightly.\n\n1416\n01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:35,080\nAnd didn't have to know about that,\nin case you were hoping,\n\n1417\n01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,240\nyou hadn't heard about it until now,\nand breathing that sigh of relief.\n\n1418\n01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:38,864\nIt's not to be.\n\n1419\n01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:39,892\n>> Maybe it's not on there.\n\n1420\n01:08:39,892 --> 01:08:41,690\n>> Maybe we just won't have to cover it.\n\n1421\n01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:45,920\nTruth be told, it is there, and\nyou will have to go through it.\n\n1422\n01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,060\nWe will walk you through that,\nbecause obviously, no good,\n\n1423\n01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:53,470\nnot thorough explanation of\nnetworking would be finished up and\n\n1424\n01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:55,760\nput to that properly if we did\nnot talk about sub-netting.\n\n1425\n01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,670\nSo we will have a segment on that and\ninvite you to come back and\n\n1426\n01:08:58,670 --> 01:08:59,250\njoin us for that.\n\n1427\n01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,830\nIt will be a lot of fun,\nwe'll be serving milk and cookies and\n\n1428\n01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,470\na good time will be had by all.\n\n1429\n01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,690\nAll right so wireless networking then,\nlet's take a look.\n\n1430\n01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:10,040\nSo let's talk about now I know we have the\nmagic of modern TV technology there and\n\n1431\n01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:10,840\nwe have some notes.\n\n1432\n01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,510\nSo network standards, we have MAN,\n\n1433\n01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:18,340\nLAN, PAN, we've obviously talked\nabout WANs, wide-area networks.\n\n1434\n01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:21,270\nBut let's talk about the idea of a MAN,\na metropolitan area network,\n\n1435\n01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:26,020\nwhat we did was we gave you the IEEE\nstandards for wireless implementations.\n\n1436\n01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:29,535\nThese are the working groups, meaning\nthe groups that are going to come up\n\n1437\n01:09:29,535 --> 01:09:32,768\nwith the standards around\nthe technologies that are implemented or\n\n1438\n01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:35,166\nused to implement these\ntechnological designs.\n\n1439\n01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:38,703\nSo what you want to take away from\nthis knowledge, point here is\n\n1440\n01:09:38,703 --> 01:09:43,530\nsimply that IEEE 802.16, that's associated\nwith concept of a wireless MAN.\n\n1441\n01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,685\nIEEE 802.11 associated with LANs, so\n\n1442\n01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:50,562\nwireless implementations of LANs,\nlocal area networks.\n\n1443\n01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:53,927\nAnd 802.15 Wireless\nimplementation of PANs or\n\n1444\n01:09:53,927 --> 01:09:58,186\npersonal area networks, or\nput in front of or behind of Peter rather\n\n1445\n01:09:58,186 --> 01:10:02,696\nI should say you have a fairy character\nfrom a Disney movie, Peter Pan.\n\n1446\n01:10:02,696 --> 01:10:04,110\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So 802.15 personal-area networks,\n\n1447\n01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:09,415\nBluetooth for instance an example\nof a PAN network standard that we\n\n1448\n01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:13,080\nprobably all are familiar with and consume\nmost likely on a regular basis, right?\n\n1449\n01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,600\nSo you do wanna know the standard\nworking group titles.\n\n1450\n01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:20,510\nWe then get down a little bit further,\nwe talk about some more standards.\n\n1451\n01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:25,070\nWhat we have is wireless standards that,\nspecifically within the 802.11, so\n\n1452\n01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:28,320\nwithin the LAN,\nLocal Area Network Standard Working Group.\n\n1453\n01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,880\nWe have sub-groups, standards\nthat are created specifically for\n\n1454\n01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,010\ncertain solutions.\n\n1455\n01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:37,720\nAnd we have the traditional three that we\nthink of, A, B and G on the wireless side.\n\n1456\n01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,850\nWe'll quickly talk through each of those.\n\n1457\n01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:44,140\nWe also have 802.11n, newer standard\nthat we're seeing emerge and\n\n1458\n01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,422\na lot of people are excited about.\n\n1459\n01:10:45,422 --> 01:10:50,420\nWe have new things like Metro Wireless,\nso being able to put wireless\n\n1460\n01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,490\ninside cities and things like that,\ninside whole neighborhoods.\n\n1461\n01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:57,210\nAnd we'll get into the security protocols\nas you can see a little bit further down,\n\n1462\n01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,128\nWEP need I say more?\n\n1463\n01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:02,290\nWPA, WPA2 like what is there\nto say after you say WEP?\n\n1464\n01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:04,890\nIt's almost like the punchline\nbefore the joke, right?\n\n1465\n01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:07,580\nThe joke was, why would you\nbother applying for security?\n\n1466\n01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,540\nAnd the answer was,\nbecause we use WEP, right?\n\n1467\n01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:12,933\nSo let's go back up, and\nlet's talk about 802.11a.\n\n1468\n01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:16,193\nSo what we wanna understand here with\nthese standards is that we wanna\n\n1469\n01:11:16,193 --> 01:11:18,000\nunderstand the amount of bandwidth.\n\n1470\n01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,090\nYou'll see we have a megabit designation\non the left followed by the @\n\n1471\n01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:26,390\nsign telling us that we are transmitting\nat or in this bandwidth range.\n\n1472\n01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:30,330\nIn the 5 gigahertz range, 2.4 gigahertz,\nor both depending on the standard.\n\n1473\n01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:34,093\nSo from a knowledge standpoint,\nwhat you want to take away from this and\n\n1474\n01:11:34,093 --> 01:11:37,416\nunderstand is that you look to\nprepare to answer to questions,\n\n1475\n01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:41,932\nwill be associate the standard 802.11a\nWith a 54 megabit bandwidth rating,\n\n1476\n01:11:41,932 --> 01:11:44,920\ntransmitted in the 5\ngigahertz bandwidth range.\n\n1477\n01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:48,981\nSo this is what the a standard for\n802.11a represents,\n\n1478\n01:11:48,981 --> 01:11:55,182\nversus 802.11b which will be 11 megabits\ntransmitted at the 2.4 gigahertz range.\n\n1479\n01:11:55,182 --> 01:12:01,480\n802.11g which will be the 54 megabit,\nbandwidth solution so the same as a.\n\n1480\n01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,010\nBut notice it is on a lower\nbandwidth frequency,\n\n1481\n01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:06,429\n2.4 gigahertz as opposed to 5 gigahertz.\n\n1482\n01:12:06,429 --> 01:12:10,676\nSo a and g in effect are the same speed,\nbut done had a different frequency,\n\n1483\n01:12:10,676 --> 01:12:14,871\ndifferent [CROSSTALK] they are not\ncompatible with each other, correct.\n\n1484\n01:12:14,871 --> 01:12:18,523\nAnd then we have 802.11n as in Nancy.\n\n1485\n01:12:18,523 --> 01:12:22,019\nNow we have 100 megabytes, or\nup to 100 megabytes, it would depend.\n\n1486\n01:12:22,019 --> 01:12:24,393\nWe could even get higher than that,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n1487\n01:12:24,393 --> 01:12:28,192\nAt the 2.4 and or 5 gigahertz range,\nbecause it could be implemented\n\n1488\n01:12:28,192 --> 01:12:32,613\nin either one, depending on how we choose\nto implement it based on that architecture\n\n1489\n01:12:32,613 --> 01:12:35,626\nthat we would specify we would see one or\nthe other there?\n\n1490\n01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:38,460\nSo, we just wanna make\nsure we are aware of that.\n\n1491\n01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,690\nFrom a security standpoint,\nwe'll get down there to security.\n\n1492\n01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,088\nAnd from a security standpoint,\n\n1493\n01:12:43,088 --> 01:12:47,660\nwe do wanna understand that we\nare using different protocols.\n\n1494\n01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:49,530\nAgain, depending on what we choose to do.\n\n1495\n01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,350\nYet when we go in and\nwe look at wireless, and\n\n1496\n01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:53,900\nwe setup wireless,\nwe do have a choice, right?\n\n1497\n01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,450\nAnd obviously choices are important\nprovided we're educated,\n\n1498\n01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:59,910\nand we have the knowledge and\nware thought to make the right choices.\n\n1499\n01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:03,250\nSo, we started out with WEP early on,\n\n1500\n01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:06,840\nright obviously although perhaps\nthe choice that in the beginning.\n\n1501\n01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,300\nWe started to use wireless,\nmay have made some sense,\n\n1502\n01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,610\nwe didn't really understand the security\nimplications of using WEP early on.\n\n1503\n01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:15,730\nBut very quickly, we came to understand\nthat because WEP can be broken,\n\n1504\n01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:21,030\nbecause of bad architecture,\nbad limitation, short key space,\n\n1505\n01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,600\nincorrect use of initialization vectors.\n\n1506\n01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,520\nThat it was not really designed,\nunfortunately we found out after the fact,\n\n1507\n01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,860\nwas not designed to be as\nsecure as we thought it was.\n\n1508\n01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:32,820\nIt dealt with a shared key\nauthentication mechanism.\n\n1509\n01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:35,610\nAnd because of the fact that the key is\nrepeated, because the key space was so\n\n1510\n01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:38,570\nsmall, or\nby today's standards was too small.\n\n1511\n01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:39,960\nWe then began to see patterns.\n\n1512\n01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,670\nAnd we could easily.\n\n1513\n01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:41,380\n>> It was predictable.\n\n1514\n01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:44,210\n>> Relatively speaking predictable,\nand break the encryption.\n\n1515\n01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:45,200\nSo, we have moved away from WEP.\n\n1516\n01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,430\nAt least, hopefully, we have.\n\n1517\n01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:49,941\nIf you are still using WEP,\nthen good for you?\n\n1518\n01:13:49,941 --> 01:13:51,586\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You keep doing that,\n\n1519\n01:13:51,586 --> 01:13:53,626\ncuz we wanna make sure you're secure.\n\n1520\n01:13:53,626 --> 01:13:58,340\nBut for those of us that know better,\nwe are using WPA, and now more recently,\n\n1521\n01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:02,385\nhopefully WPA2, again,\nbecause although WPA is much stronger.\n\n1522\n01:14:02,385 --> 01:14:07,788\nWi-Fi protected accesses the acronym\nthere, it used the R4 stream,\n\n1523\n01:14:07,788 --> 01:14:13,400\nor RC4 steam cipher as you can see,\nand was not being used or was not\n\n1524\n01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:18,620\ncreated to be used with the most recent\nencryption standards, for instance AES.\n\n1525\n01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:22,860\nWhich is used in WPA2,\nwhich is more secure, more robust, and\n\n1526\n01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,510\nas a result is less likely to be cracked.\n\n1527\n01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:29,480\nRC4 cyphers, although they are strong,\ntend to because of the modern computing\n\n1528\n01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:33,000\npower would bring to the table,\nare seen as potentially being vulnerable.\n\n1529\n01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,760\nSo, WPA2 is a stronger solution.\n\n1530\n01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,070\nAnd it uses AS, so\n\n1531\n01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:40,760\nwe wanna make sure we understand that\nwhen you set up a wireless connection.\n\n1532\n01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,710\nLet's say on your home devise,\n\n1533\n01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:46,600\nmaybe your cable modem, whatever it is,\nyou have the wireless router there, right?\n\n1534\n01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,525\nYou're gonna be given the opportunity\nto go in and make a choice, and\n\n1535\n01:14:50,525 --> 01:14:54,475\npull down on your connection, what she\nmakes you do in terms of security, and\n\n1536\n01:14:54,475 --> 01:14:57,185\nso there may be other options there.\n\n1537\n01:14:57,185 --> 01:15:00,645\nDepends on the nature of the device,\ndepends on the protocols in play,\n\n1538\n01:15:00,645 --> 01:15:03,105\nyou're using a Cisco devise\nhypothetically, for instance,\n\n1539\n01:15:03,105 --> 01:15:06,675\nyou may have proprietary protocols that\nthey may implement and or support.\n\n1540\n01:15:06,675 --> 01:15:09,295\nBut these are the one's you're\ngonna commonly see, and so\n\n1541\n01:15:09,295 --> 01:15:12,700\nas a result probably not really\nseeing WEP too much anymore.\n\n1542\n01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:17,200\nBut you do wanna really focus on WPA and\nWPA2, just be aware of that and\n\n1543\n01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,440\njust understand the key takeaway there,\n\n1544\n01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,748\nin terms of the higher level of security,\nall right?\n\n1545\n01:15:21,748 --> 01:15:25,640\nVery important, and we also want\nto think about the fact that we\n\n1546\n01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:30,340\ntalked about the collision detection,\ncollision avoidance conversation, CSMA.\n\n1547\n01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,350\nSo, carrier sensing multiple access,\n\n1548\n01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:35,930\ncollision avoidance which is the mechanism\nthat's used by wireless connections.\n\n1549\n01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:38,250\nWe talked about that in\none of our prior episodes.\n\n1550\n01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:43,610\nSo, in terms of the mac layer, and how we\ndo communications there in the OSI model.\n\n1551\n01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:46,670\nWe're using the carrier\nsense multiple access CSMA,\n\n1552\n01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:51,380\nCA [COUGH] collision avoidance mechanism,\nso please be aware of that.\n\n1553\n01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,000\nAnd that's again something that,\n\n1554\n01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,330\nyou would wanna associate\nwith wireless solutions here.\n\n1555\n01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:59,880\nAnd just make sure that we're\ncomfortable with, and aware of that,\n\n1556\n01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,770\nas opposed to collision detection.\n\n1557\n01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:05,540\nCollision detection being\nwhat is used with a wired\n\n1558\n01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:08,590\nsolution as opposed to\na wireless solution.\n\n1559\n01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:12,390\nDo wanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n1560\n01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:16,400\nHaving said that,\nwe talked through the different standards,\n\n1561\n01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,740\nwe did talk about those,\nwe talked a little about Bluetooth,\n\n1562\n01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:23,520\nwe didn't mention 802.16,\njust throw that out to 40 quickly.\n\n1563\n01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,990\nUp there for\nsometimes referred to as WiMax,\n\n1564\n01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:29,520\nthat's what you commonly\nhear referred to as WiMax.\n\n1565\n01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:34,840\nBut, is traditionally seen as a wireless\naccess method from Metropolitan\n\n1566\n01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,820\narea network.\n\n1567\n01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,480\nSo, just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that, and\n\n1568\n01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,330\nwe did talk about that briefly as well.\n\n1569\n01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:44,480\nSome best practices when we think\nabout using wireless technology,\n\n1570\n01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,510\nnever a good conversation as we talked\nabout some of the things you should do.\n\n1571\n01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:50,180\n>> All right.\n>> And do to be smart, and be more secure.\n\n1572\n01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:53,450\nSo for instance, would you wanna\nset up a wireless access point\n\n1573\n01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:57,010\nthat uses a broadcasted SSID,\na secure set ID?\n\n1574\n01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:00,300\nIn other words, do you just randomly and\nopenly tell everybody,\n\n1575\n01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,915\nwhat the wireless access\npoint is going to be called?\n\n1576\n01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:05,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And it depends at home,\n\n1577\n01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,050\nyou may to choose to broadcast the SSID.\n\n1578\n01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:09,930\nIf you have kids and want them to be\nable to connect, it's convenient.\n\n1579\n01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,304\n[CROSSTALK] Your neighbors can\nget into it with no trouble.\n\n1580\n01:17:11,304 --> 01:17:11,980\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n1581\n01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:14,370\n>> People driving down the street,\nthey can find it.\n\n1582\n01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:15,310\nIt's real easy.\n\n1583\n01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:18,410\nIt makes it easy for the mailman to\nborrow when he comes the high right.\n\n1584\n01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:22,020\nSo, obviously if you broadcast\nthe SSID the upside is,\n\n1585\n01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,480\nit's easy to find the access point.\n\n1586\n01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,320\nDownside is everybody who doesn't belong\nconnecting to it, can also find it, right,\n\n1587\n01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,928\nso you wanna make sure you're aware\nof that and you understand that.\n\n1588\n01:17:29,928 --> 01:17:34,370\nYou also wanna think about\nthe fact that we should change\n\n1589\n01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:37,740\nthe SSID from the default,\neven though we don't broadcast it, right?\n\n1590\n01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,980\nWe don't wanna leave it at the default.\n\n1591\n01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:41,412\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Cisco used to come out and\n\n1592\n01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:45,570\nTsunami used to be the access\npoint default, right?\n\n1593\n01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,930\nWe don't wanna do that,\nwe wanna make sure we change that.\n\n1594\n01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:51,420\nSo, change it to tidal wave instead\nof tsunami, be creative, right,\n\n1595\n01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,750\nwhatever it is, but\nchange the SSID from default,\n\n1596\n01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,960\nmake sure that we're not\ngonna broadcast that SSID.\n\n1597\n01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,390\nJust some things to think about.\n\n1598\n01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:00,840\nYou may wanna turn on enable.\n\n1599\n01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:05,250\nYou're gonna to say something.\n\n1600\n01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,288\n>> [CROSSTALK] I was\nthinking back to the SSIDs,\n\n1601\n01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:10,219\na fun one is always to put in there\nlike an FBI surveillance van.\n\n1602\n01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:11,705\n>> Sure if something like that.\n\n1603\n01:18:11,705 --> 01:18:13,100\n>> Yeah, if that shows up\nin the list your neighbors,\n\n1604\n01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,150\nare less likely maybe to jump on that.\n\n1605\n01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:16,090\nI don't know.\n\n1606\n01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,480\n>> [LAUGH] It depends\non what they're doing.\n\n1607\n01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,650\nYou never know.\n\n1608\n01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:21,440\nBut one of the things I was gonna say.\n\n1609\n01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,440\nSo aside from those things,\n\n1610\n01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,040\nwe may wanna go ahead, we may wanna use\nsome MAC address filtering on them.\n\n1611\n01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,179\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So filter the MAC addresses in effect,\n\n1612\n01:18:28,179 --> 01:18:30,083\ncreate an access control list in there,\n\n1613\n01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:33,500\nthat prevents people from getting\nin unless they're on the list.\n\n1614\n01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:37,760\nSo a little whitelist, right,\nas opposed to a blacklist.\n\n1615\n01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,690\nWe may wanna choose to set up some login,\nright, so do a little login on there.\n\n1616\n01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:44,260\nAlthough chance is good you're probably\nnot gonna pay a lot of attention to that,\n\n1617\n01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,950\nunless something like\nthat goes horribly wrong.\n\n1618\n01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:50,760\nYou may just start to devise whatever, but\nthe chances of somebody doing something\n\n1619\n01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,810\nyou have to log in there, and\nreally pay attention to at home anyway.\n\n1620\n01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:57,270\nYeah, probably small, but in an office may\nbe important to have logging turned on for\n\n1621\n01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:58,510\nprobably about in the enterprise.\n\n1622\n01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,302\nProbably very important\nto think about that.\n\n1623\n01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:03,520\nWe wanna enable encryption, so\nobviously making sure we talk about it,\n\n1624\n01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,910\nand we did talk about\ndifferent encryption options.\n\n1625\n01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:09,940\nBut enable strong encryption\nthat is going to be specific,\n\n1626\n01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:12,670\nto the nature of the usage\nof the technology.\n\n1627\n01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:16,790\nMeaning if you are transiting financial\ndata across that wireless network,\n\n1628\n01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:17,930\nit's gonna be a lot different for\n\n1629\n01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:21,450\nyou than if you're just\ntransiting generic web traffic.\n\n1630\n01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,190\nYou don't really care about that.\n\n1631\n01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:25,270\nYou've got to make sure we're\nusing strong encryption,\n\n1632\n01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:28,160\ndepending on the data source,\nand limit the power output.\n\n1633\n01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,560\nThat's one thing people often miss.\n\n1634\n01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,150\nThey turn these devices on, crank them up\ninto full steam, they are broadcasting out\n\n1635\n01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,910\nprobably in a 50 to a 100 foot,\nmaybe 50 to 100 yard radius,\n\n1636\n01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:41,122\nmaybe even longer depending on\nthe kind of device you have.\n\n1637\n01:19:41,122 --> 01:19:44,673\nAnd the kind of antennas you have,\nand as a result of that,\n\n1638\n01:19:44,673 --> 01:19:47,500\nyou may be lighting up\nnot just your house, but\n\n1639\n01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:51,440\nyou could be lighting up your\nneighbor's house on either side.\n\n1640\n01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,090\nRight?\nAnd if it's in an office,\n\n1641\n01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:54,720\nyou could be lighting\nup not just the office,\n\n1642\n01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,830\nbut bleeding out into the parking lot.\n\n1643\n01:19:56,830 --> 01:20:00,540\n>> Or in shared environments, where you've\ngot like Strip malls, where you've got\n\n1644\n01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:02,930\nthe offices covering both of the-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1645\n01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,890\nThe little cubes as we call them.\n\n1646\n01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:06,860\nSo you've got the boxes inside the boxes.\n\n1647\n01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,630\nAnd so, we often see that.\n\n1648\n01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:09,670\nAnd what I find when we go out and\n\n1649\n01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:13,810\nwe do wireless site surveys is we\nfind these overlapping circles or\n\n1650\n01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:17,010\nconcentric rings of coverage and\nthat can actually lead to problems.\n\n1651\n01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:19,730\nTo the point where we're just raiding,\nwhere we may have tightly knit\n\n1652\n01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:23,330\nspaces where people are kind of\ncompressed together in effect.\n\n1653\n01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:26,820\nAnd if we put too much power,\ntoo much wireless signal into that space,\n\n1654\n01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,430\nwe actually wind up disrupting\neach other's signals.\n\n1655\n01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:31,760\nAnd potentially wind up\nscrewing things up and\n\n1656\n01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,430\nactually it works a lot\nworse than it should.\n\n1657\n01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,530\nBeing aware of the fact that there\ncould be reflective surfaces\n\n1658\n01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:39,760\nthat can also interfere\nwith signal strength.\n\n1659\n01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,410\nSo glass and steel, things like that.\n\n1660\n01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:43,310\nMetal, right?\n\n1661\n01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:45,160\nAre going to act as reflective surfaces.\n\n1662\n01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,810\nYou want to be aware of that.\n\n1663\n01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:49,530\nWhereas things like\nthe tiles in the ceiling,\n\n1664\n01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:52,860\nthose acoustical tiles,\nwill effectively act to dampen and absorb.\n\n1665\n01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,710\n>> Right.\n>> And then things that are solid,\n\n1666\n01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:58,480\nsuch as cinder block, concrete,\nwill tend to block, right.\n\n1667\n01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,170\n>> Right\n>> And prevent signals from bleeding out.\n\n1668\n01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:02,010\nSo, we just wanna be aware\nof those things, right?\n\n1669\n01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,900\nWhere are you gonna place the wireless\naccess points for maximum coverage.\n\n1670\n01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,050\nThese are all things to consider, and just\nall things that you have to be aware of.\n\n1671\n01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:10,860\nBecause, if users\nare struggling to get on, and\n\n1672\n01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:15,640\nas a result have to act insecurely in\norder to access the wireless solution.\n\n1673\n01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,450\nEffectively is defeating all\nthe other stuff you're doing.\n\n1674\n01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:20,520\nSo be aware of things like that.\n\n1675\n01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,990\nIf you're doing in between building,\n\n1676\n01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:26,370\nwireless solutions may be bridging\ntwo buildings on a campus.\n\n1677\n01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,930\nYou gotta worry about line of sight.\n\n1678\n01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:28,920\n>> Right.\n>> You gotta worry about things that\n\n1679\n01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,870\nare disruptive there.\n\n1680\n01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:31,428\nMaybe a tree getting in the way.\n\n1681\n01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,240\nWho knows what,right?\n\n1682\n01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:36,810\nBut obviously, also think about outside,\nyou know, location of the attacker.\n\n1683\n01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:39,280\nCan they get between the signal,\nbetween the two buildings and\n\n1684\n01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,640\nsuck it out of the sky, in effect?\n\n1685\n01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,320\nBecause it's wide open, right?\n\n1686\n01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,030\nSo, as long as they can-\n>> Get an antenna up there.\n\n1687\n01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:45,390\n>> Get an antenna up there,\nin the right area,\n\n1688\n01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:47,610\nthey can effectively see that connection.\n\n1689\n01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:51,820\nSo just some things to consider, just\nto be aware of, things to think about.\n\n1690\n01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:55,030\nYou know in general inherent security\nvulnerabilities, things that are going to\n\n1691\n01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:57,780\nbe problems there, eavesdropping\nas we were just talking about.\n\n1692\n01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,120\nRight?\nWe want to be aware of that.\n\n1693\n01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,915\nMan in the middle attacks, war driving,\npeople driving by and picking up on these\n\n1694\n01:22:03,915 --> 01:22:07,680\nthings are all going to be issues so\nwe want to be able to address.\n\n1695\n01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:11,810\nSo, when we think about types of\nvirus attacks or security issues,\n\n1696\n01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:13,770\nwe think about eavesdropping.\n\n1697\n01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:16,820\nWe think about man in the middle,\nwhich is a form of eavesdropping.\n\n1698\n01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,645\nWe can think about war driving.\n\n1699\n01:22:18,645 --> 01:22:19,240\nRight?\n\n1700\n01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,890\nSo people are driving by and\nare basically picking up our signal.\n\n1701\n01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:28,170\nWe can think of,\nthings like blue-jacking, blue-scarfing.\n\n1702\n01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:31,410\nYou know, we're effectively jacking\nthe signal on the Bluetooth.\n\n1703\n01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:36,900\nWe could be doing a WLAN jacking,\na wireless LAN jacking in general.\n\n1704\n01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,500\nWEP, and obviously using WEP\nis an insecure solution,\n\n1705\n01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,000\nleads to all sorts of problems there.\n\n1706\n01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,210\nSo, you just want to make sure-\n>> That is a vulnerability.\n\n1707\n01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:45,370\n>> You should, it should,\nit is a vulnerability.\n\n1708\n01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,198\nRight it is, absolutely.\n\n1709\n01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:48,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And remember, we could have passive and\n\n1710\n01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:51,860\nactive attacks, in the sense that\npeople could set out to attack us.\n\n1711\n01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,460\nOr inadvertently, right?\n\n1712\n01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:56,430\nThey could just be listening or not really\nlooking, but they could actively go out\n\n1713\n01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,910\nand try to create disruption in our\nservice and that also could be a problem.\n\n1714\n01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:02,010\nSo we do want to be aware of that.\n\n1715\n01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,500\nShared key authentication on the website\nis why we talk about it being so weak.\n\n1716\n01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:09,309\nWe talked about that key space being\nsmall as well, so, just be aware of that.\n\n1717\n01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:14,770\nSo obviously setting up those secure\nsolution, thinking about those\n\n1718\n01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:18,992\nas practice, is going to be very important\nfor us when we take a look at that.\n\n1719\n01:23:18,992 --> 01:23:23,560\n[COUGH] When we think about\nusing technology like VPNs for\n\n1720\n01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,490\ninstance to do tunneling,\nwe are encrypting data, tunneling it,\n\n1721\n01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:28,630\nsafeguarding it, we are tunneling it away.\n\n1722\n01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:32,320\nThese are thing that we want to think\nabout generically as best practices across\n\n1723\n01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,250\nour networks.\n\n1724\n01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:37,060\nBut making sure that we are aware of\nthe fact that these kind of things exist.\n\n1725\n01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:39,200\nAnd so VPN's down there as our note.\n\n1726\n01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:44,200\nWhat we put down was 802.1x for\nthe new standard that will allow us to\n\n1727\n01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:49,900\nbe able to increase security, bring TLS,\nor transport layer security into the mix.\n\n1728\n01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:54,500\nAnd maybe with radius, that kind of thing,\nbe able to create a more secure solution.\n\n1729\n01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,860\nSo, you have to be passingly\naware of the fact or\n\n1730\n01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:01,540\nvaguely aware of the fact that we do\nhave some increased network standards or\n\n1731\n01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,554\nincreasing security network\nstandards that are out there.\n\n1732\n01:24:03,554 --> 01:24:07,510\n802.1x, the emerging standards around\nthat to enhance network security,\n\n1733\n01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,380\nvery important.\n\n1734\n01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:09,650\nIt's actually not so now, I mean,\n\n1735\n01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:13,720\nit's been around since right around the\nturn of the century, right around 2001.\n\n1736\n01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,880\nGive or take, somewhere in there is\nwhere 802.1x actually kind of became\n\n1737\n01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,625\nofficial as an authentication mechanism.\n\n1738\n01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:20,300\n>> Right.\n\n1739\n01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,210\n>> Both on the wireless and\non the wired side, but\n\n1740\n01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:26,550\nwe didn't really see it impacting and\nimplemented right away,\n\n1741\n01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:29,900\nI mean it was really something that\nkinda took a while to take hold.\n\n1742\n01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:33,170\nWe use these protocols to\ndrive authentication there.\n\n1743\n01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:36,400\nThings like EAP, we talk about\nextensive authentication protocol.\n\n1744\n01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,930\nThings like radius, right?\n\n1745\n01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:39,030\nWe use there.\n\n1746\n01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:41,760\nSo, those kind of things\nare going to be very important.\n\n1747\n01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:47,250\nYou know, Cisco uses 802.1x, they built\nin, support on their solutions and\n\n1748\n01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,630\nmost of the big vendors do so it's not\nsomething that is unusual by any means.\n\n1749\n01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:54,430\nBut it is just something to be aware of,\nand basically what we're doing is we're\n\n1750\n01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:57,930\nauthenticating users through\nthe use of this solution.\n\n1751\n01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:02,180\nAnd although it can establish\nthe encryption key concept,\n\n1752\n01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:07,440\nwe don't tend to use 802.1x\nto do the encryption\n\n1753\n01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:11,770\nas much as we do to use it and\nfocus it on the authentication.\n\n1754\n01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:14,223\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1755\n01:25:14,223 --> 01:25:16,530\n[COUGH]\nAnd\n\n1756\n01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:20,290\nKerberos by the way can be used with\n802.1x to provide authentication as well.\n\n1757\n01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,050\nOr rather provide encryption as well.\n\n1758\n01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,600\nSo just maybe a little\nnote there in your mind,\n\n1759\n01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,350\njust about some of the things\nwe could do there.\n\n1760\n01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:29,320\nTalked about Kerberos,\ntalked about how it works and\n\n1761\n01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,550\nthat's something we see\nthe added there as well.\n\n1762\n01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:33,260\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n1763\n01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:36,300\nwhat we wanna do is just spend\na couple minutes talking about VOIP.\n\n1764\n01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,040\nVoice over IP, and\n\n1765\n01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:41,230\njust make sure we're comfortable\nwith the things that go on there.\n\n1766\n01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:42,640\nMake sure we have a sense of that.\n\n1767\n01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:47,615\nWhen we talk about voip,\ntalk about voice over IP, we'll\n\n1768\n01:25:47,615 --> 01:25:51,675\ntalk about the idea of using an IP based\ntraffic pattern to move voice traffic.\n\n1769\n01:25:51,675 --> 01:25:55,615\nSo we talked early on about categories\nof cable, one of our early episodes.\n\n1770\n01:25:55,615 --> 01:25:58,540\nIn fact a cat one Cable is\nreally voice cable, right?\n\n1771\n01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:01,490\nAnd cap three is where we\nstarted to see data emerging.\n\n1772\n01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:05,710\nAnd so the idea was that we could take\nvoiceover IP, really put the voice\n\n1773\n01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:10,660\nsolution out over the IP wire in\neffect and do IP telephony and make\n\n1774\n01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:15,310\ninternet based phone calls and everybody\nnow could talk using things like Skype.\n\n1775\n01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:18,620\nCould use a link as a video chat client,\nthings like that.\n\n1776\n01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:22,580\nAnd as a result, we could obviously\nincrease the capabilities of our\n\n1777\n01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:26,930\ntraditional IP networks, further enhancing\nthem, adding capabilities to them,\n\n1778\n01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:29,900\npotentially adding some additional\ndata that has to be secured.\n\n1779\n01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,600\nWe have to do things now like QLS.\n\n1780\n01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,995\nQuality of service.\n\n1781\n01:26:32,995 --> 01:26:33,910\n>> Yap.\n>> We have to worry about\n\n1782\n01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:35,220\nsecuring the voice traffic.\n\n1783\n01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:38,010\nWe have to make sure that we understand\nthat we don't slow down the network for\n\n1784\n01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:40,750\nthe voice traffic and\noverwhelm our data stream.\n\n1785\n01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,390\nSo we have to manage more right?\n\n1786\n01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:46,700\n>> So\nnow my voice is susceptible the same.\n\n1787\n01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,920\nDenali serves a tax that my data is.\n\n1788\n01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,930\n>> It is.\nSo we have things like jitter that we have\n\n1789\n01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:51,620\nto worry about now.\n\n1790\n01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:55,280\nA term that we often talk about when\nwe talk about network bandwidth and\n\n1791\n01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,220\nmeasuring network\nbandwidth on voice systems.\n\n1792\n01:26:57,220 --> 01:27:01,690\nWe talk about jitter which is that issue\nwe have if we have flutter in the line,\n\n1793\n01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:03,730\nwe have any noise where\nthe voice would be disrupted.\n\n1794\n01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:08,030\nIf you're in a meeting or\non a call it comes over very choppy.\n\n1795\n01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:11,710\nIt's almost like talking, I don't know\nif you remember, back in the day.\n\n1796\n01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:15,810\nI had when I grew up,\nmy cousins, from Venezuela,\n\n1797\n01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:18,808\nwere born down there and\ngrew up in Venezuela.\n\n1798\n01:27:18,808 --> 01:27:22,330\nAnd so when we would talk to them,\nwhen we were growing up,\n\n1799\n01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:28,000\nback in the 70s,\nwe would have to talk to them over a,\n\n1800\n01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,770\nyou'd make a phone call,\nbut it's very expensive.\n\n1801\n01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:31,640\nSo you could talk.\n\n1802\n01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,530\nMy uncle would use HAM radio.\n\n1803\n01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:35,340\n>> Oh, really?\n>> And so\n\n1804\n01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:38,570\nwe would be able to talk to them over the\nwire, but it was very choppy sometimes.\n\n1805\n01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:40,053\nIt was depending on the signal, right,\n\n1806\n01:27:40,053 --> 01:27:42,640\nand you may or may not be able to get\na good signal and a good connection.\n\n1807\n01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,063\nOr he would send the signal through and\npatch it in as a phone call.\n\n1808\n01:27:46,063 --> 01:27:47,094\n>> Right.\n>> So he'd get on the radio but\n\n1809\n01:27:47,094 --> 01:27:47,967\nthen he'd be listening on the phone.\n\n1810\n01:27:47,967 --> 01:27:48,643\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n1811\n01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:51,949\n>> But since they were calling Through and\ntheir using a radio signal to do it.\n\n1812\n01:27:51,949 --> 01:27:52,901\nSometimes you would lose it.\n\n1813\n01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:53,552\n>> All right

you have somebody disrupts\nthe radio signal is my point.\n\n1819\n01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,150\nThen it can flutter and you get that\nFlutters the wire where you get,\n\n1820\n01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:11,770\nbasically, that jitter, and as a result\nthe signal transmission can be destroyed.\n\n1821\n01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:13,740\n>> Yeah, that's different from our data,\nwhere we kind of broken up and\n\n1822\n01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:16,410\nsequenced it, and\nit can arrive in a different order.\n\n1823\n01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:20,190\nWe can put it back together and\nI still have my email or my word document.\n\n1824\n01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:21,690\n>> With a nice PCP sliding window.\n\n1825\n01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:24,540\n>> Yeah exactly, and voice,\nvideo and streaming stuff.\n\n1826\n01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:28,480\nThey kind of need to get there in\nthe right order in a timely fashion, so.\n\n1827\n01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,050\n>> Well, yeah.\nIt's kind of hard to put frame 25 back in\n\n1828\n01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:33,410\nsequence after we watched 40 other frames.\n\n1829\n01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:34,480\nOkay.\nStop there.\n\n1830\n01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,610\nWe're gonna go back over here.\n\n1831\n01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,040\nThis one frame right here.\n\n1832\n01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,840\nPlay.\nNow everything makes sense.\n\n1833\n01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,460\nSo, I got the whole thing now.\n\n1834\n01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:43,400\nI didn't know who did it but\nnow I see that it's all there.\n\n1835\n01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:47,000\nRight, so clearly, right,\nyou can't re-sequence, unfortunately.\n\n1836\n01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,650\nVoice and video, right?\n\n1837\n01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:51,540\nThe mind plays tricks on you and the ear\nplays tricks on you in the sense that\n\n1838\n01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:54,250\nwe kind of fill in a little bit,\nwe anticipate.\n\n1839\n01:28:54,250 --> 01:29:00,200\nAnd so we fill in if we lose a packet or\ntwo, frame or two, but it's not the same.\n\n1840\n01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,900\n>> Right.\n>> If we lose half the signal,\n\n1841\n01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,710\nit's not the same,\nwe can't really fill in the gaps.\n\n1842\n01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:04,840\n>> Yep.\n>> But because we have packet\n\n1843\n01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,642\nsequencing on the data side,\nas you pointed out.\n\n1844\n01:29:06,642 --> 01:29:09,770\nSequence numbers in the flags and\nthe offset.\n\n1845\n01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:12,600\nThe offset idea allows us to to be\nable to say it's packet 5 of 20, and\n\n1846\n01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,810\nwe left a space there, and\nnow we can drop packet 5 in, and\n\n1847\n01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,990\nwe can then move forward\nin the sliding buffer.\n\n1848\n01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:21,310\nThis is actually something that's\ndifferent when we talk about voice.\n\n1849\n01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:23,950\nAll right, so let's just talk\nabout voice for just a minute.\n\n1850\n01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:25,295\nWe'll talk some more about voice-\n>> All right, [CROSSTALK] back up there?\n\n1851\n01:29:25,295 --> 01:29:26,580\n>> Yeah.\n\n1852\n01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:30,360\nSo, we wanna talk quickly\nabout the H.323 solution.\n\n1853\n01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,870\nSo this idea here.\n\n1854\n01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:34,520\nWe have these voice gateways\nthat we often talk about.\n\n1855\n01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:37,350\nAn H.232 standard is\nthe gateway that we will use or\n\n1856\n01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:40,910\nthe way that we process voice or\ncreate voice over IP solutions.\n\n1857\n01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:43,340\nIt's the standard effectively\nthat we are using.\n\n1858\n01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:46,250\nSo we just want to make sure\nthat we're aware of that.\n\n1859\n01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:50,200\nYou can go out and\nget a little bit more understanding,\n\n1860\n01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:53,780\nin the sense of just go and\nmaybe look at H.323 as a standard.\n\n1861\n01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:56,882\nWe're not gonna spend a lot of time on\ndefining the entire standard for you here.\n\n1862\n01:29:56,882 --> 01:30:02,015\nWe do hold in discussions on VoIP and\nVoIP based technologies today,\n\n1863\n01:30:02,015 --> 01:30:05,425\nbut as the standard, it's basically\nthe cornerstone for this technology.\n\n1864\n01:30:05,425 --> 01:30:07,895\nIt's how we do the voice,\nreal time audio and\n\n1865\n01:30:07,895 --> 01:30:11,547\ndata communications over a data packet,\nor over a packet network.\n\n1866\n01:30:11,547 --> 01:30:12,747\nSo this is the standard.\n\n1867\n01:30:12,747 --> 01:30:15,457\nWhen we talk about standards,\nit's the standard for VoIP.\n\n1868\n01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:17,197\nThis is what we refer to.\n\n1869\n01:30:17,197 --> 01:30:20,607\nSo you may wanna go out and take a look,\nbut it is gonna be the standard that\n\n1870\n01:30:20,607 --> 01:30:24,540\nspecifies all the components,\nall the ways in which they come together.\n\n1871\n01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:28,725\nHow this all done, so devices, hardware\ndevices, that act as gateways are called\n\n1872\n01:30:28,725 --> 01:30:33,350\nH.323 gateways in the void world and\nthe H.323 standard is the void standard.\n\n1873\n01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:35,000\nSo we do want to make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n1874\n01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,020\nAnd then we have SIP,\nthe session initiation protocol.\n\n1875\n01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:43,310\nSo SIP, the session initiation protocol,\n\n1876\n01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:47,190\nis going to be the voice protocol that\nis used to set up and then tear down.\n\n1877\n01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:50,790\nIt's used to manage the VoIP\nsessions that actually transmit\n\n1878\n01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:55,220\nthe data if the H323 is the standard,\nthe SIP is the worker bee,\n\n1879\n01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:59,000\nit's the implementor that goes out and\nsets up those sessions for us.\n\n1880\n01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,570\nSo, it is the protocol that's\nused to do the set up,\n\n1881\n01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:04,460\nthe management and ultimately\nthe breakdown of those sessions.\n\n1882\n01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,890\nSo, want to make sure we\nare aware of that as well.\n\n1883\n01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:09,050\nObviously SIP is gonna be very important.\n\n1884\n01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:12,970\nIt's built into most of the modern\nsystems that are using VOIP today.\n\n1885\n01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:16,560\nSo for instance, Microsoft has it\ndirectly integrated into their stack for\n\n1886\n01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,660\nwhat they do.\n\n1887\n01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:21,090\nCisco on their side has their\nimplementations, and so\n\n1888\n01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:24,450\nanybody that supports it We'll be using\nit natively and be able to work with it.\n\n1889\n01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:29,230\nSo if you use any voice related technology\non a device today, any enabled device,\n\n1890\n01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:32,390\nin terms of video conferencing and\nthings like that.\n\n1891\n01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:34,320\nYou're using SIP, the underlying protocol.\n\n1892\n01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,060\nLink, for instance,\n\n1893\n01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:38,600\nMicrosoft Link which you used to know\nas Office Communications Server, and\n\n1894\n01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,420\nLive Meeting, and all that stuff is now\njust It's called link on their platform.\n\n1895\n01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:43,510\nIt is a native SIP client.\n\n1896\n01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:46,060\nThe Cisco Presence clients\nare using SIP as well.\n\n1897\n01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,560\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n1898\n01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:53,350\nAll right, so when we talk about VoIP,\ntalk about SIP, talk about HV 23.\n\n1899\n01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:55,380\nWhat we probably want to do is\n\n1900\n01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:01,870\nreally just think through from your\nperspective, getting ready for the SSCP.\n\n1901\n01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:05,090\nWhat it is we want to make sure we\nwalk away with from this conversation.\n\n1902\n01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:08,140\nSo, what I want to remind\nyou of is this is not It's\n\n1903\n01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:11,190\ngoing to be a Cisco voice exam, right?\n\n1904\n01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:12,010\nSo we're not, for instance,\n\n1905\n01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:15,770\ntrying to understand call manager\nimmunity and get certified at that level.\n\n1906\n01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:18,050\nThis is not a void exam.\n\n1907\n01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:23,050\nVoid is one very small piece as you've\nseen of a very large technology area\n\n1908\n01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:27,380\nthat we've been spending several\nepisodes on, and several programs on.\n\n1909\n01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,730\nRight.\nSo this is our third episode, right.\n\n1910\n01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:31,040\n>> Right.\n>> In part three, so\n\n1911\n01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,690\nwe've been spending a lot of time\ndeveloping these particular discussions in\n\n1912\n01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:36,000\nthe network area.\n\n1913\n01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,290\nA lot of material, yet\nat the end of the day hundred and\n\n1914\n01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:43,155\nsomething questions on the exam\nhundred and twenty five questions.\n\n1915\n01:32:43,155 --> 01:32:45,370\n>> Right.\n>> So, you want to put it in perspective\n\n1916\n01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:49,210\nmake sure we're clear on the fact that\nwe have a lot content but that doesn't\n\n1917\n01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:53,170\nnecessarily translate into everything\nbeing asked about in-depth on everything.\n\n1918\n01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:58,130\nSo, what we really want to understand is\nthis idea of that fact they we're gonna be\n\n1919\n01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:02,070\nasking a lot of different kinds of\nquestions on an exam like this.\n\n1920\n01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:04,940\nFrom a lot of different technology areas.\n\n1921\n01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:08,130\nYou can see the amount of time we\nspend on something like networking.\n\n1922\n01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:11,450\nClearly indicates that there are gonna\nbe questions in the network area.\n\n1923\n01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:13,050\nMaybe some that are specific.\n\n1924\n01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:16,580\nAnd so for\ninstance our Episode on subnetting.\n\n1925\n01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:17,935\nThat would be something to take a look at.\n\n1926\n01:33:17,935 --> 01:33:18,960\n>> Right.\n>> Because that's going to\n\n1927\n01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,840\nbe something where you're\ngoing to get a very unique and\n\n1928\n01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,770\nspecific set of skills that\nwill help you to understand and\n\n1929\n01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:28,060\nidentify questions either scenario based\nor individual stand alone question.\n\n1930\n01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,792\nWhere a component of the answer\nmay involve an IP address,\n\n1931\n01:33:30,792 --> 01:33:33,990\nSubnet masking derived,\nor something like that.\n\n1932\n01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:38,350\nThere's a lot of other material that we've\nbeen through that is both application and\n\n1933\n01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:40,270\ntheory based, and a blend of the two.\n\n1934\n01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:43,820\nRisk analysis, business impact analysis,\nare good examples of this.\n\n1935\n01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:47,750\nThe theory associated with how to do it,\nbut we also have structure and\n\n1936\n01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,500\nreal hands on pieces that we get into.\n\n1937\n01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:53,460\nSo you wanna make sure you have\na good understanding at this point,\n\n1938\n01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:57,220\nas we're getting close to\nwrapping up our conversations,\n\n1939\n01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:00,360\naround all of this material,\nto round out the SSCP.\n\n1940\n01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:04,660\nThat you really have a good understanding,\na good common sense approach to studying.\n\n1941\n01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:07,390\nWant to make sure that you put\nthis information in perspective.\n\n1942\n01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:11,980\nTake the time to go back through the CIB,\n\n1943\n01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:16,940\nthe Candidate Information Bulletin that\nISC Squared puts out in market to talk to\n\n1944\n01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:20,560\nyou about the various touch points that\nthe exam is gonna cover effectively,\n\n1945\n01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,280\nthe exam blueprint for\nlack of a better way of describing that.\n\n1946\n01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,830\nWhich is really the outline of all\nthe material that we follow as we prepare\n\n1947\n01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:28,240\nall of the programs for you.\n\n1948\n01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,270\nMake sure you know what's\nbeing talked about.\n\n1949\n01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:34,440\nMake sure you look at the amount of focus\nand time that we spent on some of these\n\n1950\n01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:38,230\nareas, and that obviously something that\ngets just a very small amount of coverage\n\n1951\n01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:40,590\nversus something that we\nspent an entire episode on.\n\n1952\n01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:43,300\nOr perhaps the better part of\nan episode on is going to be\n\n1953\n01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:46,120\nweighted appropriately in your mind,\nas you prepare to study, right?\n\n1954\n01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,660\nIt's very important there, and\n\n1955\n01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:50,930\nvery important just to think about that\nas you get ready to take the exam.\n\n1956\n01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:53,270\nAll right, so, any maybe,\nclosing thoughts?\n\n1957\n01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,350\nAnything we want to wrap up with?\n\n1958\n01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:56,870\n>> I'm getting excited for subnetting.\n\n1959\n01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:58,800\n>> I'm awesomely excited for subnetting.\n\n1960\n01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,910\nAwesomely excited because Mike is\ngoing to be doing the subnetting, and\n\n1961\n01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:04,090\nI am going to be watching him do it.\n\n1962\n01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:06,170\nI am equally excited.\n\n1963\n01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:07,420\nAs you should we as well.\n\n1964\n01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:10,175\nWe will be engaging, and\nwe will be back with that shortly.\n\n1965\n01:35:10,175 --> 01:35:15,569\n>> [SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back everybody to our SSCP\n\n1966\n01:35:15,569 --> 01:35:20,842\nepisodes on networking,\nand we're getting ready\n\n1967\n01:35:20,842 --> 01:35:26,127\nto dive into the wonderful\nworld of sub-netting.\n\n1968\n01:35:26,127 --> 01:35:28,350\n>> Wonderful world of sub-netting.\n\n1969\n01:35:28,350 --> 01:35:30,090\n>> Wonderful world.\nWe gotta think positive, right?\n\n1970\n01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:32,900\nWe gotta. [LAUGH] >> See if we can\nmaintain that through the entire\n\n1971\n01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:33,910\ndiscussion.\n\n1972\n01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:34,890\nAlright, so.\n>> It's a little difficult\n\n1973\n01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:35,620\nsometimes to show.\n\n1974\n01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:36,220\n>> It is.\nIt is.\n\n1975\n01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,010\nSo you know what?\n\n1976\n01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:37,617\nAll kidding aside.\nI happen to love subnetting and\n\n1977\n01:35:37,617 --> 01:35:38,528\nI love the discussion around subnetting\nbecause it lets me do two things.\n\n1978\n01:35:38,528 --> 01:35:45,469\nIt lets me really step back and as a.\n\n1979\n01:35:45,469 --> 01:35:49,402\n>> A teacher, somebody who spends\ntime explaining things to people,\n\n1980\n01:35:49,402 --> 01:35:52,500\nreally forces me to stop and\nthink about the basics.\n\n1981\n01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:58,280\nAnd come up with some really good, general\nways to explain concepts that are bedrock,\n\n1982\n01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,810\nthat are absolutely foundational to\neverything else we've been talking about.\n\n1983\n01:36:01,810 --> 01:36:05,560\nSo, Forces me to go back to bases,\nreally keeps me humble and\n\n1984\n01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,020\nhonest in the sense of knowing that\nI have to master certain topics and\n\n1985\n01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:11,770\nunderstand them in a way\nthat I can then use them and\n\n1986\n01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:16,290\napply them to everything else that I'm\ndoing in terms of architecture and design.\n\n1987\n01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:18,780\nAnd so, we've been talking\na lot in these episodes and\n\n1988\n01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:22,460\nthroughout the entire series\nof programs along SSCP.\n\n1989\n01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:26,930\nAbout the importance of making\nsure we are focused on awareness,\n\n1990\n01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:30,920\nsure we're focused on, making sure we're\nfocused on confidentiality, integrity,\n\n1991\n01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,220\nunavailability.\n\n1992\n01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:35,920\nAnd at the heart of all those discussions\nat the end of the day is the ability to\n\n1993\n01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:42,180\nunderstand how to turn on a computer Aar\n\n1994\n01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:46,000\nformatting associated with the appropriate\nsubnet so that we can send and\n\n1995\n01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,180\nreceive information from\nwhere we need to be, and\n\n1996\n01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:50,960\ntransit through networks to get\nto where we want to be, and\n\n1997\n01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,690\nback again obviously cuz it's important\nto be able to come back, right?\n\n1998\n01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:57,450\nSometimes easier to get there then it is\nto come back, so we want to make sure we\n\n1999\n01:36:57,450 --> 01:37:01,880\nunderstand that and so as we were talking\nabout this topic and making sure that we\n\n2000\n01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:05,960\nwere in sync, Mike and I about how we were\ngonna present this information to you.\n\n2001\n01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:09,250\nWe both started talking about how\nwhat if we do this, or that, and\n\n2002\n01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:12,770\nhow's it gonna look and are we gonna lay\nit out the right way and can they see it?\n\n2003\n01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:15,850\nAnd really get it, so\nwe want to take a very simple approach and\n\n2004\n01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:17,540\nlay out the basics for you.\n\n2005\n01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:20,060\nGive you some information that\nhopefully is gonna be helpful.\n\n2006\n01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:22,890\nMike is going to be kind\nenough to assist me here and\n\n2007\n01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:25,520\nlay out some of the graphics for\nus as we talk about some things.\n\n2008\n01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,490\nI'm going to narrate a little bit and\ntry to make sure we explain it.\n\n2009\n01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:30,490\nMike is going to jump in and\nhelp along the way.\n\n2010\n01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:32,550\nTogether, hopefully,\nwe're gonna lay out a pretty picture for\n\n2011\n01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:35,270\nabout subnetting, but the one thing\nI want to challenge you with at\n\n2012\n01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:37,000\nthe end of this process is to understand.\n\n2013\n01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,900\nAnd I think you were\nprobably gona jump in and\n\n2014\n01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:42,640\nsay the same thing, but,\nif we need a deeper dive, right.\n\n2015\n01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:46,268\nBecause we may want that deeper dive\non some of this subnetting material.\n\n2016\n01:37:46,268 --> 01:37:50,920\nWe are gonna be at a relatively high level\nhere, we're not gonna go into the, my God,\n\n2017\n01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,240\nI need to know everything there is to\nknow about subnetting to get ready for\n\n2018\n01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:53,950\na CISCO Go exam.\n\n2019\n01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:54,520\n>> Right.\n>> Conversation.\n\n2020\n01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,310\n>> Instead of borrowing bits and yeah.\n\n2021\n01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:59,070\n>> So. Right. We're not gonna do classes,\ninternet domain routing.\n\n2022\n01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:02,000\nWe're not gonna do custom subnetting.\n\n2023\n01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,980\nWe are going to mention them.\n\n2024\n01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:06,040\nWe just did, so we're gonna check those\n[LAUGH] off the list because they're not\n\n2025\n01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:06,815\ngonna come up again [LAUGH].\n\n2026\n01:38:06,815 --> 01:38:08,295\nAnd what we're gonna do is very basic,\nright.\n\n2027\n01:38:08,295 --> 01:38:11,585\nAnd so as a result, we are gonna\nleave some things off the table,\n\n2028\n01:38:11,585 --> 01:38:14,595\nthat maybe of interest to you and\nthat you're gonna know more about it.\n\n2029\n01:38:14,595 --> 01:38:15,745\nAnd so where are we gonna look for that.\n\n2030\n01:38:15,745 --> 01:38:16,275\nWhere are we gonna go?\n\n2031\n01:38:16,275 --> 01:38:19,005\n>> Sometimes knowing a little bit\ndeeper is gonna help you with\n\n2032\n01:38:19,005 --> 01:38:24,235\nthis exam anyways so, you guys you\ncan over to the CCENT episodes.\n\n2033\n01:38:24,235 --> 01:38:25,985\nYou can jump into\nthe network plus episodes.\n\n2034\n01:38:25,985 --> 01:38:28,240\nAnd they spend a lot of time,\nthey go over it.\n\n2035\n01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,290\nAnd a couple of different ways.\n\n2036\n01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:31,940\nSo if you want a different analogy or\na different way of looking at it.\n\n2037\n01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:32,560\nI highly recommend.\n\n2038\n01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,850\nBecause if you guys are subscribers\nyou have access to all those videos.\n\n2039\n01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:38,820\nSo when you get done studying for this or\nwhen you want to take break from this.\n\n2040\n01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:42,490\nJump over this SCCENT and\nlook at three hour dive into subnetting.\n\n2041\n01:38:42,490 --> 01:38:43,800\nAnd get into the nitty gritty.\n\n2042\n01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,720\n>> Good times.\n\n2043\n01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,130\n>> And then come back here and\nhave more fun.\n\n2044\n01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:46,895\n>> Yeah, good times.\n\n2045\n01:38:46,895 --> 01:38:48,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Spent those three hours wisely.\n\n2046\n01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,240\nAll right absolutely correct.\n\n2047\n01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,860\nSo, having said that kinda setting\nthe pace, setting the tone.\n\n2048\n01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:55,650\nContext is always very important.\n\n2049\n01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:58,410\nLets's go ahead and jump in if we could.\n\n2050\n01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:00,030\nSo then we're gonna throw the screen up,\nright.\n\n2051\n01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:01,840\nSo we can make sure we have that up here.\n\n2052\n01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,430\nAnd so what we're going to do is kind\nof start up a lane alpha basics,\n\n2053\n01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:09,190\nwe have a little grid up, we have a dot\ndecimal notation IP address up here,\n\n2054\n01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:11,670\n192, 168, 01 and four quadrants.\n\n2055\n01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:15,820\nSo let's start with a very basic\ndefinition of an IP address,\n\n2056\n01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:18,150\nI just mentioned this idea\nof dot decimal notation.\n\n2057\n01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:22,950\nAnd so what we're talking about is a 32\nbit address IP addresses are considered,\n\n2058\n01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:28,270\nat least IPv4 addresses, version four,\nare considered to be 32 bit addresses.\n\n2059\n01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:30,660\nSo how do we get to that 32 bit address?\n\n2060\n01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,485\nSo, let's talk about what that is and\nhow we get it.\n\n2061\n01:39:32,485 --> 01:39:33,795\nGet there, and so the idea is,\n\n2062\n01:39:33,795 --> 01:39:38,775\nthat each of these areas that we are\nrepresenting here, for instance the 192,\n\n2063\n01:39:38,775 --> 01:39:42,005\nwhich Mike is gonna highlight\nthere in whatever color we choose.\n\n2064\n01:39:42,005 --> 01:39:42,845\n>> Just fade a little bit.\n\n2065\n01:39:42,845 --> 01:39:45,820\n>> Perhaps a nice or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n2066\n01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:46,890\nLike white.\n\n2067\n01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:48,440\nWhite is good.\n\n2068\n01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:50,356\nWhite will be a good color.\n\n2069\n01:39:50,356 --> 01:39:53,550\n[CROSSTALK] How about we do instead\nof text [LAUGH] right exactly.\n\n2070\n01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:56,620\nSo we're going to just quickly color code\nhere so that we can keep track of them.\n\n2071\n01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:58,620\nAnd then come up with different ones.\n\n2072\n01:39:58,620 --> 01:39:59,590\nPerfect okay.\n\n2073\n01:39:59,590 --> 01:40:01,030\nSo while we're color coding.\n\n2074\n01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:04,170\n>> Are we going for\nlike the British flag theme?\n\n2075\n01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:05,820\n>> No it's just kind of a randomly go.\n\n2076\n01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:07,350\n>> We're not doing any theme here?\n\n2077\n01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:11,635\nWe're not gonna do like Brazil for the\nupcoming World Cup or anything like that?\n\n2078\n01:40:11,635 --> 01:40:12,738\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Okay so we've got our\n\n2079\n01:40:12,738 --> 01:40:14,500\ncolor scheme out there, right.\n\n2080\n01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,260\nAnd so for the first octet.\n\n2081\n01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:21,460\nFor the first group of numbers that\nwe're gonna work with are aqua or\n\n2082\n01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:22,690\nwhatever we call that.\n\n2083\n01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:25,310\n192, we're gonna label that octet one.\n\n2084\n01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:29,230\nAnd an octet is gonna be\na grouping of eight bits.\n\n2085\n01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:30,650\nAnd so this will be octet one.\n\n2086\n01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,130\nI think you actually made\nthe font that same color.\n\n2087\n01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:35,230\nI think the font is the same\ncolor as the actual.\n\n2088\n01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:36,093\n>> Let's just double check.\n\n2089\n01:40:36,093 --> 01:40:38,198\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, so probably wanna go ahead and\n\n2090\n01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:39,598\nmake that like, black.\n\n2091\n01:40:39,598 --> 01:40:40,345\nYeah, there we go.\n\n2092\n01:40:40,345 --> 01:40:41,370\nSo, octet one.\n\n2093\n01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:44,250\nNo matter what we do we're\ngonna label this octet two, and\n\n2094\n01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:46,060\nthen of course octet three and\noctet four and\n\n2095\n01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:50,720\nyou probably gonna be hard-pressed\nto see black on that color, so yeah.\n\n2096\n01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:54,770\nThat one may have to be may have\nto be done in a lighter color,\n\n2097\n01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:57,180\nor just change the fill there.\n\n2098\n01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:59,635\nYeah, something like that.\n\n2099\n01:40:59,635 --> 01:41:00,685\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, do a light one.\n\n2100\n01:41:00,685 --> 01:41:03,971\nRed and red, that's good.\n\n2101\n01:41:03,971 --> 01:41:05,976\n[CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE] we don't\nreally need to differentiate, okay.\n\n2102\n01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:06,680\nAll right.\n\n2103\n01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,855\nSo we have some light colors.\n\n2104\n01:41:07,855 --> 01:41:08,690\n[LAUGH] Again,\n\n2105\n01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:13,018\nwith that red thing we can barely see\n[CROSSTALK] save your retinas on that.\n\n2106\n01:41:13,018 --> 01:41:14,030\nWant to change that to\nmaybe something a little.\n\n2107\n01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:15,410\n>> All right.\nTo a nice shade of pink or\n\n2108\n01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:16,360\nsomething down there.\n\n2109\n01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,740\n>> Yeah. Let's do. [CROSSTALK]\n>> Something, you know, very light.\n\n2110\n01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:20,276\n>> There we go.\n>> Okay, that's a little better.\n\n2111\n01:41:20,276 --> 01:41:20,890\nAll right.\nSo\n\n2112\n01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:24,090\nthe comedy stylings of Mike and\nAdam here, everybody.\n\n2113\n01:41:24,090 --> 01:41:24,780\nWe're here all week.\n\n2114\n01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,390\nThank you very much.\n\n2115\n01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:28,413\n>> Where's our\n>> IP humor, right?\n\n2116\n01:41:28,413 --> 01:41:30,042\nSo, we have octet number one.\n\n2117\n01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:30,580\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd\n\n2118\n01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:33,500\noctet number one is gonna be\nrepresented by the number,\n\n2119\n01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,090\nthe decimal notation number of 192.\n\n2120\n01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:39,200\nBut what that really can be broken\ndown into, is bit of information.\n\n2121\n01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,970\nSpecifically, eight bits.\n\n2122\n01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:44,700\nAnd, those eight bits\nmultiplied across four octet,\n\n2123\n01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:47,799\nwill give us the 32 bit\nreference to the IPB4 address.\n\n2124\n01:41:47,799 --> 01:41:50,200\n>> All right.\n>> So, the first thing to understand is we\n\n2125\n01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:54,820\nget a 32 bit address by taking eight bits\nfrom each octet, multiplying them out and\n\n2126\n01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:57,140\nhaving a total of 32 bit solution.\n\n2127\n01:41:57,140 --> 01:42:01,890\nAnd for an IBP6 address,\nwe have a 128 bit address block,\n\n2128\n01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:04,510\nand so effect we have four times.\n\n2129\n01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:05,540\nThe number of Bits.\n\n2130\n01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:09,140\nSo that is obviously a much broader,\nmuch bigger, much deeper.\n\n2131\n01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:09,830\n>> Much larger address space.\n\n2132\n01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:11,260\n>> Much larger address pool, and\n\n2133\n01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:13,690\nthat's about the extent of what\nI'm gonna have to say about IPv6.\n\n2134\n01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:15,405\n>> Wahoo.\n>> Cross that one off the list as well.\n\n2135\n01:42:15,405 --> 01:42:18,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so on octet one, 192.\n\n2136\n01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,220\nLet's go ahead and let's do the following.\n\n2137\n01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:23,550\nWe've labelled the octets one,\ntwo, three, four.\n\n2138\n01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:25,500\nWe've laid out our dot decimal notation.\n\n2139\n01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:26,670\nSo now what we're gonna do, and\n\n2140\n01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:28,870\nI think we're gonna try to\nprobably start with octet.\n\n2141\n01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:31,740\nI want to do this, let's lay out our bits.\n\n2142\n01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:34,510\nAnd let's actually identify our bits and\nwe'll put a number underneath each bit so\n\n2143\n01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:35,770\nwe'll know it's bit one, bit two.\n\n2144\n01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:37,142\nBut let's lay out the bits first.\n\n2145\n01:42:37,142 --> 01:42:37,820\n>> All right.\n>> So I'm gonna\n\n2146\n01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:40,450\nlet Mike work some magic there real\nquickly just while we're talking.\n\n2147\n01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:42,920\nHe's just going to quickly\nnotate through those for us.\n\n2148\n01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,970\nAnd so what we'll notice is we\ndo 128 starting on the left and\n\n2149\n01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:46,916\nwe're moving left to right.\n\n2150\n01:42:46,916 --> 01:42:48,934\nInside octet one.\n\n2151\n01:42:48,934 --> 01:42:53,420\nWe've got 128 and actually before\nyou put in the numbers here.\n\n2152\n01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:54,143\nJust pause for just one second.\n\n2153\n01:42:54,143 --> 01:42:55,477\nLet me just point\nsomething out to everybody.\n\n2154\n01:42:55,477 --> 01:42:56,436\nAnd then we'll do that.\n\n2155\n01:42:56,436 --> 01:43:00,940\nSo we've got 128, 64,\n32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1.\n\n2156\n01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:03,690\nEight bits descending in\norder from left to right.\n\n2157\n01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:06,290\nWe will number those bits and\nwe'll put the bit numbers in.\n\n2158\n01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:10,570\nAnd we'll identify the 128 bit\ncolumn as being number one and\n\n2159\n01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:13,950\nthen we'll move over towards bit\nnumber eight on the far right.\n\n2160\n01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:17,470\nBut before we do that, and\nwe'll put those in, we also wanna call out\n\n2161\n01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:21,370\nthe fact that these are going to be able\nto be seen not just as bit numbers and\n\n2162\n01:43:21,370 --> 01:43:23,080\nvalues, but also powers of two.\n\n2163\n01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:23,650\n>> Right Yes.\n\n2164\n01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:26,300\n>> So\nwe're not gonna put in the two notation,\n\n2165\n01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,930\nthen you know two to the power of zero,\ntwo to the power of one, two, three,\n\n2166\n01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:30,861\nfour, five, six etcetera\n>> But\n\n2167\n01:43:30,861 --> 01:43:32,630\nyou also can think about them [LAUGH].\n\n2168\n01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:33,221\nRight, exactly.\n\n2169\n01:43:33,221 --> 01:43:36,336\n[CROSSTALK] I don't know where\nthe heck that is in here,\n\n2170\n01:43:36,336 --> 01:43:38,310\nI don't know where to put that in.\n\n2171\n01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:39,770\nYou should have told me about that one.\n\n2172\n01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:41,920\nThat's why I said don't do anything,\nI'm just gonna mention it, right.\n\n2173\n01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:46,506\nBut we could also see it that way, and\ndepending on the discussion we have around\n\n2174\n01:43:46,506 --> 01:43:51,311\nIP and- From what perspective we take it\nat, we get deeper into some of this stuff.\n\n2175\n01:43:51,311 --> 01:43:54,496\nWe spend time helping you to understand\nhow to build that knowledge base out or\n\n2176\n01:43:54,496 --> 01:43:57,730\nwe think about it in multiple ways because\nthat becomes important when we start\n\n2177\n01:43:57,730 --> 01:44:00,480\ndoing classless internet domain\nrouting and custom subnetting.\n\n2178\n01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,890\nBecause we have to understand\nwhat bits we're using,\n\n2179\n01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:05,530\nwhere we're gonna borrow from and\nhow to split that octet.\n\n2180\n01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:08,870\nThen that value becomes important, but for\nus, for what we're doing at this level,\n\n2181\n01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:11,100\nwe're gonna have it in the back of\nour mind, maybe be aware of it.\n\n2182\n01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,970\nBut we're not gonna spend\ntoo much time on it, right?\n\n2183\n01:44:12,970 --> 01:44:15,205\nSo let's go ahead and\nthrow the bit numbers in there.\n\n2184\n01:44:15,205 --> 01:44:19,680\nSo we're just gonna number that out,\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and 8.\n\n2185\n01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:20,820\nWe have our bit numbers.\n\n2186\n01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:23,680\nMaybe if we can do, you wanna get\ndo a quick grid on those two?\n\n2187\n01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:25,500\n>> All the way across, the?\n\n2188\n01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:28,340\n>> Just the 128, just on the first ones,\njust on the first octet and\n\n2189\n01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:32,020\ngrid out the bit value and\nbit number just so they can see it.\n\n2190\n01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:37,210\nAnd just understand that your one\ncorresponds to 128, two corresponds.\n\n2191\n01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:39,150\nYou know what I'm talking about?\n\n2192\n01:44:39,150 --> 01:44:40,721\nJust laying the borders.\n\n2193\n01:44:40,721 --> 01:44:42,231\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\nLaying the borders all the way\n\n2194\n01:44:42,231 --> 01:44:42,774\nacross there.\n\n2195\n01:44:42,774 --> 01:44:44,258\n>> Maybe.\n\n2196\n01:44:44,258 --> 01:44:44,928\n>> So that way we.\n\n2197\n01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:47,440\nIf we can.\nIf not, not a big deal.\n\n2198\n01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,900\nThat's a merge, we don't want that one.\n\n2199\n01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:52,030\nYeah, I think we want that,\nright at the lower right.\n\n2200\n01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:53,870\nDo that and do the lower right selection.\n\n2201\n01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:55,405\nAll the way over, down, down, down.\n\n2202\n01:44:55,405 --> 01:44:55,927\nRight there.\n\n2203\n01:44:55,927 --> 01:44:56,473\nPerfect.\n\n2204\n01:44:56,473 --> 01:44:57,123\nYeah.\n\n2205\n01:44:57,123 --> 01:45:00,610\nSo Mike's gonna go ahead and just put\nthe grid in there for us real quick.\n\n2206\n01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:04,080\nBut the idea is that basically what we're\ngonna be able to then do is just really\n\n2207\n01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:07,300\nunderstand that we can see it,\njust lines up for us a little bit easier.\n\n2208\n01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:09,050\nSee in that respect.\n\n2209\n01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:12,260\nAnd so what that distills down\nto at the end of the day,\n\n2210\n01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:15,170\nwill be in this case a dot\ndecimal solution of 192.\n\n2211\n01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:20,092\nNow, what we then have to understand is\nthat we're actually going to get 192.\n\n2212\n01:45:20,092 --> 01:45:22,440\n>> Right.\n>> So lets maybe move 192 down,\n\n2213\n01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,810\noh lets move it down like two lines.\n\n2214\n01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:26,440\nSort a couple of rows in there.\n\n2215\n01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:30,380\nAnd so what we're going to do\nis we're going to go ahead and\n\n2216\n01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:33,145\nwe are going to put in for us.\n\n2217\n01:45:33,145 --> 01:45:33,870\nOkay, there we go.\n\n2218\n01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:38,780\nWe're going to put as the next item down,\nwe're going to identify the fact that\n\n2219\n01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:41,740\nwe have to signify whether this\nbit is turned on or off, right?\n\n2220\n01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:44,290\nSo from a binary notation perspective.\n\n2221\n01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:45,030\nRight?\nWe have to\n\n2222\n01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:47,200\nunderstand that one equals on or true.\n\n2223\n01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:48,750\nZero equals off or false.\n\n2224\n01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:52,470\nMaybe we'll put a little key down there\nat the bottom just to understand that.\n\n2225\n01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:55,010\nSo bit turned on will equal one.\n\n2226\n01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:57,850\nBit turned off or\na bit not chosen equals zero.\n\n2227\n01:45:57,850 --> 01:45:58,960\nHowever you want to think of that.\n\n2228\n01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:03,040\nSo if we have a key there and we\nunderstand that then what we're going to\n\n2229\n01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:07,250\ndo is go up there and let's maybe skip\nan area because we have all the 1s there.\n\n2230\n01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,050\nSo let's just go down one and skip it.\n\n2231\n01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:12,980\nAnd what we'll do is we'll\nput the binary equivalent\n\n2232\n01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:16,000\nof 192 in by selecting\nthe appropriate bits.\n\n2233\n01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,650\n>> And looking at those place values and\n>> And\n\n2234\n01:46:17,650 --> 01:46:19,960\ncoming up with some quick math and\nfiguring it out, right?\n\n2235\n01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,180\nSo in other words,\n\n2236\n01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:24,810\nto make 192 the question becomes,\nHow many bits do we need?\n\n2237\n01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:29,880\nAnd what value in each of those bits do we\nwant to turn on and which one not have on?\n\n2238\n01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:35,330\nSo if we do some quick math on our heads,\nwe hopefully know that 128 and\n\n2239\n01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:37,800\n64 when combined together\nwill give us 192.\n\n2240\n01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:38,750\n>> Right.\n\n2241\n01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:42,920\n>> And so we need to put a one inside or\nunderneath the bid value of one and\n\n2242\n01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,140\nbid value of two there.\n\n2243\n01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:45,600\nRight in the first two.\n\n2244\n01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,912\nAnd then the rest are gonna be zeros 'cuz\nwe're gonna signify that the rest are not\n\n2245\n01:46:48,912 --> 01:46:49,451\nbeing used.\n\n2246\n01:46:49,451 --> 01:46:53,961\nAnd so\n192 effectively when it's written out\n\n2247\n01:46:53,961 --> 01:46:59,400\nin binary notation will equal 11000000.\n\n2248\n01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:03,755\nAnd so, computers speak binary,\nhumans speak dot decimal.\n\n2249\n01:47:03,755 --> 01:47:05,670\n>> Right.\n>> Because we don't walk around going, so,\n\n2250\n01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:06,810\nhey, how you doing?\n\n2251\n01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:11,170\nI went down to the store today and\nI bought 192 boxes of something.\n\n2252\n01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:13,300\n>> Right.\n>> So, we don't say I bought a 1\n\n2253\n01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:14,220\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 amount of boxes.\n\n2254\n01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:18,310\nWe could, but, you would run\naway from people that did that.\n\n2255\n01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,910\nAnd, hopefully,\nif you don't know, you should.\n\n2256\n01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:20,720\nPlease do.\n>> Yeah.\n\n2257\n01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:21,760\n>> Public service announcement here.\n\n2258\n01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:22,685\nTime out for just a second.\n\n2259\n01:47:22,685 --> 01:47:24,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Run, run fast and run far.\n\n2260\n01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:26,280\nRight?\nYou don't want to talk to\n\n2261\n01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,160\npeople like this because,\nwhat's the reality.\n\n2262\n01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:29,433\nNobody understands what that is.\n\n2263\n01:47:29,433 --> 01:47:30,962\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> So, reality is that,\n\n2264\n01:47:30,962 --> 01:47:31,744\nmachines understand.\n\n2265\n01:47:31,744 --> 01:47:33,795\nThat's right?\nBut we don't.\n\n2266\n01:47:33,795 --> 01:47:37,521\nSo this is the interesting thing about\nhow we write an IP address in decimal.\n\n2267\n01:47:37,521 --> 01:47:38,875\nRight?\nWhich is we write 192.\n\n2268\n01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:43,575\nI know you have the periods there\njust off to the side quietly and\n\n2269\n01:47:43,575 --> 01:47:45,120\nI see in column J there.\n\n2270\n01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,360\nSo let's just focus on one for\njust a second.\n\n2271\n01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:51,860\nThe reason we put the period there,\nis that it is a placeholder for us,\n\n2272\n01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:53,740\nbecause it signifies to us.\n\n2273\n01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:58,190\nThis is the first octet and dot decimal,\nso the machine, it signifies the stop for\n\n2274\n01:47:58,190 --> 01:47:59,210\neight bits.\n\n2275\n01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:01,310\nSo we know it's eight bits period.\n\n2276\n01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:02,310\nEight bits period.\n\n2277\n01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:03,460\nEight bits period.\n\n2278\n01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:06,530\nEight bits no period, we're done and\nthat is the full address or\n\n2279\n01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:08,970\nif it's IPv6 then obviously\nit's a little bit different,\n\n2280\n01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:11,180\nwe have colons,\nthat's a different address structure.\n\n2281\n01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:13,740\nAs a matter of fact could you do me a\nfavor just while we're doing this quickly,\n\n2282\n01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:17,470\njust wanted to show the nice\nfolks out there in our audience.\n\n2283\n01:48:17,470 --> 01:48:19,120\nWhat the difference is\nbetween the two addresses.\n\n2284\n01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:20,550\nJust pull up the command line for\na minute,\n\n2285\n01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:23,060\nif you could, and\nlet's just do an IP config.\n\n2286\n01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:23,580\nRight?\nAnd\n\n2287\n01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:28,090\nlet's do first just do\nan IP config by itself.\n\n2288\n01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:31,350\nRight, let's just start out by showing,\nokay, just what we get there.\n\n2289\n01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:34,110\nSo, we do, you'll see,\nwe get the IP config,\n\n2290\n01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:37,860\nwe got the IPv4 address which\nis he third one down there.\n\n2291\n01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:38,834\nWe got, there we go, right there.\n\n2292\n01:48:38,834 --> 01:48:39,550\n10.1.100.24.\n\n2293\n01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:46,214\nAnd then right above it we have\nthe link local IPv6 address.\n\n2294\n01:48:46,214 --> 01:48:46,950\nRight?\n\n2295\n01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:50,570\nAnd so you can see the different\nnotation of the IP.\n\n2296\n01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:53,850\nIt's basically an alphanumeric solution.\n\n2297\n01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:54,530\nRight?\n\n2298\n01:48:54,530 --> 01:48:59,900\nWith colons as opposed to periods and\njust numeric notation.\n\n2299\n01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:02,460\nSo, obviously gonna be\na different address format.\n\n2300\n01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:05,320\nWe're not gonna spend a lot of time\non why it's different right now other\n\n2301\n01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,530\nthan to say it's an emerging standard.\n\n2302\n01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:08,120\nIPv6.\n\n2303\n01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:09,460\nIt is becoming more important.\n\n2304\n01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:12,290\nDefinitely something for\nyou to be comfortable with and aware of.\n\n2305\n01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:15,833\n>> If you guys want more information,\njump over to those network plus episodes.\n\n2306\n01:49:15,833 --> 01:49:17,360\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Did you talk about it there as well?\n\n2307\n01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,720\nRight.\nSo you can definitely see that.\n\n2308\n01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,010\nBut, that's 128-bit address.\n\n2309\n01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:21,460\nBut you can see the difference there.\n\n2310\n01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:24,150\nSo, let's just go back to our spreadsheet,\nbut what I wanted to make sure we're\n\n2311\n01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:26,810\ncomfortable with is the idea that,\nthe period.\n\n2312\n01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,820\nRight?\nIn the dot decimal notation signifies\n\n2313\n01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:32,320\nthe 8 bit break from the machine to\nunderstand how to translate that.\n\n2314\n01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,810\n>> And without that,\nit wouldn't work too well.\n\n2315\n01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:35,820\n>> Without that,\nit wouldn't work too well at all, correct.\n\n2316\n01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:39,920\nWe would be speaking gibberish and\nour messages would be Lord knows where.\n\n2317\n01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:40,580\nRight?\n\n2318\n01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:43,290\nSo 192 is equal to the binary\nnotation that way.\n\n2319\n01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:46,870\nAnd obviously if we did 168 we could\neffectively do the same thing.\n\n2320\n01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:47,610\n>> Right.\n>> If we did zero,\n\n2321\n01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:49,970\nif we did one obviously zero is all zeros.\n\n2322\n01:49:49,970 --> 01:49:53,600\nOne would be all zeros with just one\nat the very end for only the last\n\n2323\n01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:57,010\nof the octet bits, the eighth bit\nbeing signified as being available.\n\n2324\n01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:57,950\nSo you get the general idea.\n\n2325\n01:49:57,950 --> 01:49:59,480\nWe're not gonna lay all of them out for\n\n2326\n01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:02,735\nyou but hopefully you get the general idea\njust about what this would look like.\n\n2327\n01:50:02,735 --> 01:50:05,010\n>> Right.\n>> So now that we've set this out,\n\n2328\n01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:06,440\nwhat we then want to\nreally think about and\n\n2329\n01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:08,670\nunderstand is, how do we then go ahead.\n\n2330\n01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:11,160\nExcuse me.\nHow do we then go ahead\n\n2331\n01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:15,440\nhow do we actually apply this information\nand how do we actually take this and\n\n2332\n01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:20,010\nthen use this to create communications,\ncreate an IP address.\n\n2333\n01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:23,260\nSo the next thing we want to think about,\nthe next things we potentially\n\n2334\n01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:27,990\nwant to talk about is taking this IP\naddress and signifying that we have some\n\n2335\n01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:30,080\nrules that are going to be\nassociated with it's usage.\n\n2336\n01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:30,860\nRight?\n\n2337\n01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,880\nAnd so, let's think about some rules for\na minute.\n\n2338\n01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:38,420\nLet's talk about general rules and\nrules that we can apply to these octets.\n\n2339\n01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:41,630\nAnd so, I have three rules that\nI think of that really when\n\n2340\n01:50:41,630 --> 01:50:44,760\nI think about IP addressing and\nI talk about it, I use and\n\n2341\n01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,370\nI apply that tend to help me\nto put this into perspective.\n\n2342\n01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:50,270\nAgain I follow the principle\nof Keep it Simple.\n\n2343\n01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:51,810\nSo we can have simple rules,\n\n2344\n01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:55,440\nwe tend to have uncomplicated\noutcomes that are easily reproduced.\n\n2345\n01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:59,310\nAnd so let's label it maybe rule number\none, rule number two, that kind of thing.\n\n2346\n01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:00,880\nLet's start with rule number one.\n\n2347\n01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,930\nSo what rule number one\nequals is this idea that for\n\n2348\n01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:07,280\nthe first octet, just for the first octet.\n\n2349\n01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:12,310\nThat we were gonna have the ability\nto use the value of anything for\n\n2350\n01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:13,120\nthe octet, right?\n\n2351\n01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:14,950\nIn other words,\nthe value that can go in there.\n\n2352\n01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:19,110\nAnything from zero,\nall the way to 255, what is our range.\n\n2353\n01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:19,770\nRight?\n\n2354\n01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:22,020\nSo possible values is 0 to 255.\n\n2355\n01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:25,570\nBut actual values,\nright, will be 1 to 254.\n\n2356\n01:51:25,570 --> 01:51:30,500\nRight?\nBecause, what we say there is,\n\n2357\n01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:32,830\nthat although we could\ntheoretically start at zero,\n\n2358\n01:51:32,830 --> 01:51:35,190\nwhen we do that we don't\nhave a valid IP address.\n\n2359\n01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:39,010\nAnd if we start on a 255,\nwe are broadcasting.\n\n2360\n01:51:39,010 --> 01:51:41,970\nSo we're not actually using a routeable\nIP, we're using a non-routeable IP.\n\n2361\n01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:44,820\nSo although they are theoretical values,\npossible values,\n\n2362\n01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:48,400\nthey're not actual values that we would\nuse in production to route traffic.\n\n2363\n01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:54,077\nAnd so our actual useable values Will\nbe one to 254 for the first octave.\n\n2364\n01:51:54,077 --> 01:51:55,238\nThat's rule number one.\n\n2365\n01:51:55,238 --> 01:51:58,430\nOn rule number two, and maybe we can\njust put it into the second octet\n\n2366\n01:51:58,430 --> 01:52:00,570\neven though you're writing rule two there.\n\n2367\n01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:02,830\nThen just do it in the second octave so\nthey can see it.\n\n2368\n01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:05,950\nAnd that will actually be for\noctet two and octet three.\n\n2369\n01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:07,900\nWe'll write it but we'll put it in both.\n\n2370\n01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:10,680\nWill be this idea of possible values.\n\n2371\n01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:15,560\nAgain of anything from possible and\nactually actual, so it will be both.\n\n2372\n01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:19,760\nPossible and actual is from zero to 255,\nbecause in octet two and\n\n2373\n01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:24,490\nthree, we can use anything\nfrom zero to 255 in\n\n2374\n01:52:24,490 --> 01:52:28,770\norder to represent numbers that\nwill be in these two octets.\n\n2375\n01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:34,750\nAnd then for rule number three,\nrule number, we just lost that there.\n\n2376\n01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:38,710\nThink you left justified,\nas opposed to as opposed to centering.\n\n2377\n01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:42,330\nI think you were trying to center and I\nthink you left justified too much there or\n\n2378\n01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:42,830\nsomething?\n\n2379\n01:52:42,830 --> 01:52:43,510\nYeah, there you go.\n\n2380\n01:52:43,510 --> 01:52:44,570\nWhatever it was, all right.\n\n2381\n01:52:44,570 --> 01:52:47,520\nSo, then rule number three,\nmaybe we skip another two lines and\n\n2382\n01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:52,080\nput it in there, but rule number three is\ngoing to be for the fourth octet, and so\n\n2383\n01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:59,060\nwhat we're gonna find there, is going to\nbe possible values again of zero to 255.\n\n2384\n01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,120\nRight.\nBut actual values,\n\n2385\n01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:02,420\njust like octet number one.\n\n2386\n01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:03,510\nWe actually could just copy it.\n\n2387\n01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:05,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> From there, if you want.\n\n2388\n01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,890\nActual values of one to 254,\n\n2389\n01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:12,400\nagain the idea is that we could end\non a zero, end on a 255 in theory.\n\n2390\n01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:17,260\nIndeed we do in certain cases, but\nwhen we do it we have no assigned IPM or\n\n2391\n01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,770\nno routable IP because we're broadcasting.\n\n2392\n01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:24,400\nAnd so as a result what we actually do\nis we say it's from one to 254 because\n\n2393\n01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,440\nthis is the usable range.\n\n2394\n01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:29,500\nA range that we can actually use in\norder to send or receive traffic.\n\n2395\n01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:33,990\nAnd so if we think about these three rules\nacross four octet, we have a structure\n\n2396\n01:53:33,990 --> 01:53:37,770\nthat allows us to understand,\nhow to see us filling in the values.\n\n2397\n01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:41,280\nFor instance,\nthe first IPV four based address,\n\n2398\n01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:45,780\nin any network that can be created that\ncan transit traffic, would be a 1.001.\n\n2399\n01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:47,130\n>> Right.\n\n2400\n01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:48,440\n>> First usable routable IP.\n\n2401\n01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:51,306\nThen we could have it in the middle.\n\n2402\n01:53:51,306 --> 01:53:52,074\nRight.\n\n2403\n01:53:52,074 --> 01:53:53,916\nSo, 1.001.\n\n2404\n01:53:53,916 --> 01:53:56,760\nThe absolute last usable I.P. address.\n\n2405\n01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:59,650\nThe other end of the spectrum\nfour billion ish away.\n\n2406\n01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:00,310\nRight.\n\n2407\n01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:02,130\nLike McDonald's billions served.\n\n2408\n01:54:02,130 --> 01:54:02,790\nRight.\n\n2409\n01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:04,340\nAt the end of that whole cycle.\n\n2410\n01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:05,320\nRight.\nIt'd be one\n\n2411\n01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,420\nhell of a drive thru line if we\ngot stuck in that, wouldn't we?\n\n2412\n01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:08,290\nRIght?\n\n2413\n01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:11,360\nAt the end of that,\nwhat's the last usable IP address, right?\n\n2414\n01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:16,320\nThat would wind up being- according\nto our little chart there- would be\n\n2415\n01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,019\na 254.255.255.254.\n\n2416\n01:54:19,019 --> 01:54:22,440\nThat would be the upper\nend of the entire range.\n\n2417\n01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:28,908\nOf every IP address, starting with 1001,\n1002, 1003, all the way up through that.\n\n2418\n01:54:28,908 --> 01:54:32,717\nAnd so what the then brings us into\nis this idea of IP address classes,\n\n2419\n01:54:32,717 --> 01:54:37,250\nbefore we talk about sub-net masks which\nwe'll get to here in just a minute.\n\n2420\n01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:40,600\nWhen we talk about IP address classes,\nso let's add some additional stuff in.\n\n2421\n01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,090\n>> Okay.\n>> And we already have that,\n\n2422\n01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:44,620\nyou got it right there perfectly,\njust do it, we already got it made.\n\n2423\n01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:45,550\nSo let's just go with it.\n\n2424\n01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:47,320\n>> All right.\n>> So we have Class A, Class B,\n\n2425\n01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:49,200\nClass C and Class D and Class E.\n\n2426\n01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:53,365\nAnd so we have five classes, right,\nthree of which are used in production for\n\n2427\n01:54:53,365 --> 01:54:55,170\nroute-able IP addresses traditionally.\n\n2428\n01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:56,990\n>> Right.\nA fourth one is used in production\n\n2429\n01:54:56,990 --> 01:54:57,550\nfor multi casting.\n\n2430\n01:54:57,550 --> 01:54:58,140\n>> Multi casting.\n\n2431\n01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:01,380\n>> A fifth one is really only used\nright now as experimental space,\n\n2432\n01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:06,300\nexpansion range so we don't really\nuse it for routable traffic today.\n\n2433\n01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:11,190\nBut let's talk about what these are, so\nClass A represents the ability- and again,\n\n2434\n01:55:11,190 --> 01:55:16,140\nwhen we talk about classes, we're focused\non the value for the first octet only.\n\n2435\n01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:17,870\nIt's very important to note that.\n\n2436\n01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:21,842\nAnd so, the first octet value- and\nso- Class A is going to have a value,\n\n2437\n01:55:21,842 --> 01:55:24,450\nas Mike indicated with\nthe gray shading there,\n\n2438\n01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:28,580\nwhich is gonna be the indication of\nthe fact we use the first octet, right?\n\n2439\n01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:32,434\nThat it's gonna be from one to 126.\n\n2440\n01:55:32,434 --> 01:55:37,405\nThe range, in other words, the acceptable\nrange for that IP or, excuse me, for\n\n2441\n01:55:37,405 --> 01:55:40,500\nthat octet value,\nis gonna be from one to 126.\n\n2442\n01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:43,340\nNow what we need to do is probably\ninsert a row there between Class A and\n\n2443\n01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:45,330\nClass B, yeah, down there.\n\n2444\n01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:48,960\nInsert like two rows so we can make room\nfor our friend the loop-back adapter.\n\n2445\n01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,912\n>> Oh, yeah, can forget about that,\nnow can we? >> We just want to talk\n\n2446\n01:55:49,912 --> 01:55:50,494\nabout that, right?\n\n2447\n01:55:50,494 --> 01:55:52,352\nCan't forget him or her,\n\n2448\n01:55:52,352 --> 01:55:57,102\ncuz it is a potential opportunity\nto be open to either of those two.\n\n2449\n01:55:57,102 --> 01:55:59,810\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> And so we want to signify the loop-back\n\n2450\n01:55:59,810 --> 01:56:03,140\nadapter there, because the loop-back\nadapter is gonna be special and separate.\n\n2451\n01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:03,850\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n2452\n01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:06,380\nit's not a Class\n>> In and of itself but\n\n2453\n01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:07,730\nit's considered to be 127.\n\n2454\n01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:11,850\nThe traditional adapter\naddress is 127.001.\n\n2455\n01:56:11,850 --> 01:56:17,930\n127 is an address block, in other words\nwill be it's set aside for diagnostics.\n\n2456\n01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:20,320\nReferred to, typically,\nas the loop-back address.\n\n2457\n01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:24,860\nIt is, traditionally and properly,\nconsidered a Class A address, by the way.\n\n2458\n01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:28,440\nSo, it is part of Class A, but\nit's the non-routable part of class A.\n\n2459\n01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:31,810\nWe kind of carved it out and\ncreated a, Put it aside as special.\n\n2460\n01:56:31,810 --> 01:56:33,000\nAnd so we see Class A,\n\n2461\n01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,550\nwhere we talk about the routable IP\naddress designations for the octet.\n\n2462\n01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:39,250\nTalk about one to 126.\n\n2463\n01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:44,210\nWhen you go for instance through CCNT or\nmaybe the Cisco gear,\n\n2464\n01:56:44,210 --> 01:56:47,400\nCisco material rather, Network Plus\nprobably talks about it this way as well.\n\n2465\n01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,750\nIf we talked about the four\nClass a address block,\n\n2466\n01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:53,340\nwe'd talk about it including 127,\njust to properly place it.\n\n2467\n01:56:53,340 --> 01:57:00,210\nSo then Class B begins with 128 and\ngoes from 128 to 191.\n\n2468\n01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:06,411\nClass C will go from 191 to, or excuse me,\n192, pardon me, I meant to say 192.\n\n2469\n01:57:06,411 --> 01:57:09,039\n191 too.\n192 to 223.\n\n2470\n01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:15,687\nAnd then Class D, which is our multicast\nrange, we'll go from 224 up through.\n\n2471\n01:57:15,687 --> 01:57:17,893\nYou made the same mistake I did there.\n\n2472\n01:57:17,893 --> 01:57:19,477\nThere you go.\n224 to 239.\n\n2473\n01:57:19,477 --> 01:57:24,760\nAnd then Class E will\nbe from 240 up to 254.\n\n2474\n01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:29,122\nAnd so these are the five classes,\nagain three of which we think of as\n\n2475\n01:57:29,122 --> 01:57:34,450\nbeing in production everyday used for\nrouting and exchanging information.\n\n2476\n01:57:34,450 --> 01:57:37,420\nClass D is traditionally\nseen as multi cast block,\n\n2477\n01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:41,390\nwhere we do things like Media\nstreaming maybe desktop imaging, and\n\n2478\n01:57:41,390 --> 01:57:44,210\nthen Class C expansion it's\nthe experimental range.\n\n2479\n01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:47,750\nIt's used, it has been used up\nuntil recently for IPv6 testing and\n\n2480\n01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:51,080\nexperimental work there,\nIPv6 becoming more the norm and so.\n\n2481\n01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:54,270\nWe are seeing it being assigned to and\nused actually for other things.\n\n2482\n01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:56,340\nSo we have our classes of addresses and\n\n2483\n01:57:56,340 --> 01:58:01,220\nyou will notice we have almost\na stair step concept going on.\n\n2484\n01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:04,780\nLet's make a little chart off to\nthe right over here somewhere.\n\n2485\n01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:06,950\nLet's label it host on one side,\n\n2486\n01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:12,320\nor network rather I should say we'll label\nit net and then label the other side host.\n\n2487\n01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:15,740\nAnd so let's put this class\nconcept into perspective.\n\n2488\n01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:18,940\nMaybe off to the left,\ncolumn over from network, right.\n\n2489\n01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:23,658\nLet's put the,\nlet's label that one as Class right.\n\n2490\n01:58:23,658 --> 01:58:26,703\nClass A, class B, class C,\nwe'll go downa and\n\n2491\n01:58:26,703 --> 01:58:30,354\nkind of lay them in there and\nlet's just lay these in, and\n\n2492\n01:58:30,354 --> 01:58:35,452\nlet's lay in our sub-net because now we\nwant to talk about sub-net masks and so\n\n2493\n01:58:35,452 --> 01:58:40,549\nthe idea behind the sub net mask is gonna\nbe that the sub-net mask identifies for\n\n2494\n01:58:40,549 --> 01:58:44,156\nus, not the IP address but\nthe sub-net or the network.\n\n2495\n01:58:44,156 --> 01:58:48,653\nThat we are a member of as a host,\na unique identity within the network and\n\n2496\n01:58:48,653 --> 01:58:51,320\nthe network that we are a member of.\n\n2497\n01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:57,040\nAnd it does so by using either a 255 or\na zero as a designation.\n\n2498\n01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,200\nAnd so the idea will be at least for\n\n2499\n01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:03,280\ntraditional basic sub-netting nothing\nthat is going to be custom at this point.\n\n2500\n01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,200\nWe'll talk about that briefly,\nbut not really.\n\n2501\n01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,020\nDeal with it we're gonna see\nlaid out this way and so\n\n2502\n01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:12,600\nthe idea behind it is that\na 255 signifies network,\n\n2503\n01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:16,980\nzero, right a none 255 designation well,\nequal host.\n\n2504\n01:59:18,250 --> 01:59:22,838\nAnd so what we then need to do is\nprobably color code, right and then.\n\n2505\n01:59:22,838 --> 01:59:27,580\nMake 255, 255 for Class B,\nthen two zeroes for\n\n2506\n01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:31,320\nhost, then do 3255 and\nMike is just going to pretty that up for\n\n2507\n01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:34,640\nus while we are talking, and\nthen one zero there for the host.\n\n2508\n01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:37,386\nAnd so what we are gonna see it, and\nhe's gonna go through, I think, and\n\n2509\n01:59:37,386 --> 01:59:38,570\ncolor code all that out for us.\n\n2510\n01:59:38,570 --> 01:59:41,396\nWhat I think we're gonna\nsee when we're done,\n\n2511\n01:59:41,396 --> 01:59:46,343\nis that we have the ability to see that as\nthe network portion of our solution grows,\n\n2512\n01:59:46,343 --> 01:59:49,419\nmore networks\n>> More bits being given to networks,\n\n2513\n01:59:49,419 --> 01:59:53,040\nless bits available for\nunique host identities, right?\n\n2514\n01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:55,620\n>> Yeah, and you've got 32 bits one way or\nanother, so.\n\n2515\n01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:57,310\n>> Got 32 bits and\nit's a zero-sum solution.\n\n2516\n01:59:57,310 --> 02:00:01,300\nWhat that means is at the end of the day,\nwe could grow one in favor of the other,\n\n2517\n02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:03,730\nbut we take away from\none to grow the other.\n\n2518\n02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:04,740\nTo your point.\n\n2519\n02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:06,960\nAnd we have a fixed number.\n\n2520\n02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,210\nRoughly about four billion addresses,\ngive or\n\n2521\n02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:12,121\ntake a couple of million on either side,\nright?\n\n2522\n02:00:12,121 --> 02:00:14,612\n[LAUGH] As a result,\nwe work in round numbers here, right.\n\n2523\n02:00:14,612 --> 02:00:16,015\nYou get that big, you can round up.\n\n2524\n02:00:16,015 --> 02:00:18,190\n[LAUGH] What's a million between friends,\nright.\n\n2525\n02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:21,380\nAnd so, when we get up around that area,\nwe're done, right.\n\n2526\n02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,270\nThis is gonna be basically\nbe the way it is.\n\n2527\n02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:24,992\nSo we have a fixed amount of stuff.\n\n2528\n02:00:24,992 --> 02:00:27,890\n>> All right.\n>> And so on a class A network Right?\n\n2529\n02:00:27,890 --> 02:00:31,320\nThe octet for the subnet is\ngonna be the first octet, and so\n\n2530\n02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:36,040\nas a result of that what we're seeing\nis we're seeing the 1 to 126 address\n\n2531\n02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:40,430\nbeing used there in the first octet, or\nthe number rather, the value being used.\n\n2532\n02:00:40,430 --> 02:00:44,530\nAnd as a result,\nwe can have 126 individual networks, 1.\n\n2533\n02:00:44,530 --> 02:00:47,660\nSomething, right.?\n\n2534\n02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:52,210\nSo 0.0.1, 0.0.2, 0.0.3, on the one network\nor each individual host In the one\n\n2535\n02:00:52,210 --> 02:00:56,780\nnetwork, then the two network, and the\nthree network, if you do 126 individual\n\n2536\n02:00:56,780 --> 02:01:01,800\nnetworks each with three octets\nworth of values for the host.\n\n2537\n02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:06,180\nAnd that means we have approximately\n16.7 million hosts per network,\n\n2538\n02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:07,950\n126 networks right?\n\n2539\n02:01:08,990 --> 02:01:12,870\nIn the middle, right, we have two\noctets being given over to the network,\n\n2540\n02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:14,120\ntwo for the host.\n\n2541\n02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:20,550\nAnd so what we see is approximately about\n65400 something like that networks and\n\n2542\n02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:24,840\nsomething like 16000 hosts or something\naround that I think approximately, right.\n\n2543\n02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:29,240\nFor each network writes a 01, 02, 03,\n>> Right.\n\n2544\n02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:34,230\n>> Rights multiply 255 times 254,\nthat's gonna give you the number of hosts.\n\n2545\n02:01:34,230 --> 02:01:40,870\nAnd then we can do class C, so\nthree octets up front for the network,\n\n2546\n02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:44,940\nabout 2.1 million, give or take, and then\non the far side for the host one octet.\n\n2547\n02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:46,780\nRemember our third golden rule?\n\n2548\n02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:51,030\nOne to 254 for the useable value and so as\na result there is a method to the madness\n\n2549\n02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:55,100\nby the way, right, [LAUGH] so as a result\none to 254 means we have a total\n\n2550\n02:01:55,100 --> 02:02:00,390\nof 254 hosts per network for roughly just\nover 2 million networks scattered out.\n\n2551\n02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:04,610\nAnd so as we put all this together, what\nthis allows us to effectively understand,\n\n2552\n02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:10,090\nsee and do is look at an IP address,\nput it in the context of the network,\n\n2553\n02:02:10,090 --> 02:02:14,610\nunderstand the unique host identity that's\nbeing given to us to use with that host or\n\n2554\n02:02:14,610 --> 02:02:16,120\nrather with that network id.\n\n2555\n02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:20,490\nAnd together combine the two in order\nto be able how to uniquely identify\n\n2556\n02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:23,910\nan individual end point, send or\nreceive information to and from it.\n\n2557\n02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:24,580\nRight.\n>> Right.\n\n2558\n02:02:24,580 --> 02:02:26,450\n>> Nice.\n>> So this lays it all out for us,\n\n2559\n02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:27,410\nhelps us to understand.\n\n2560\n02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:30,240\nThat hopefully that helps you to\nunderstand that as well cuz obviously\n\n2561\n02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:31,980\nthat's gonna be very important for us.\n\n2562\n02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:34,530\nAnd lets us really understand\nhow to put all the IP\n\n2563\n02:02:34,530 --> 02:02:36,150\naddressing information into context.\n\n2564\n02:02:36,150 --> 02:02:37,145\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n2565\n02:02:37,145 --> 02:02:39,850\n>> [COUGH] All right, so is there anything\nelse you want to throw in there, and\n\n2566\n02:02:39,850 --> 02:02:42,910\nmaybe add for the nice ladies and\ngentlemen out there?\n\n2567\n02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:44,455\n>> Office is much better than Open Office.\n\n2568\n02:02:44,455 --> 02:02:45,392\n[LAUGH]\n>> Open Office?\n\n2569\n02:02:45,392 --> 02:02:48,600\n[LAUGH] I didn't wanna say anything,\nbecause I know before we started,\n\n2570\n02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:49,810\nMike brought up Open Office.\n\n2571\n02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:53,100\nAnd I kinda looked at him, he looked at\nme, and said well we'll give it a shot.\n\n2572\n02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:55,970\n>> Well, I'm a Microsoft guy\n>> The only reason when I reinstall I did\n\n2573\n02:02:55,970 --> 02:02:57,480\nnot put Office back on here yet.\n\n2574\n02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:59,680\nAnd yeah,\nkind of had to get in on the fly, so.\n\n2575\n02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:00,580\nBut the indicator for\n\n2576\n02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:03,055\nme, was when he asked me where\nwas the formatting for the color.\n\n2577\n02:03:03,055 --> 02:03:05,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How do I color things in Open Office.\n\n2578\n02:03:05,290 --> 02:03:08,090\nAnd we couldn't quickly figure\nit out because I will admit.\n\n2579\n02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:10,270\nI don't use Open Office for\nmuch of anything.\n\n2580\n02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:13,400\nThen as a result,\nwe managed to struggle through and\n\n2581\n02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:14,990\nkeep the basic color pallet here.\n\n2582\n02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:19,380\n>> But hopefully that gives you guys\na good visual representation of what Adam\n\n2583\n02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:20,190\nwas going through.\n\n2584\n02:03:20,190 --> 02:03:22,710\nCuz it's a tough one to\njust talk about out there.\n\n2585\n02:03:22,710 --> 02:03:24,640\nYou really need to kinda see it and\nremember,\n\n2586\n02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:26,860\nyou guys have access to\nall those other episodes.\n\n2587\n02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:29,900\nIf you want a more in depth look,\ngo check out those CCENT videos,\n\n2588\n02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:34,880\ngo check out those network plus videos and\ntake a look at those.\n\n2589\n02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:36,340\n>> All right.\nSo are we signing off?\n\n2590\n02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:37,900\n>> I think that'll do it ladies and\ngentleman.\n\n2591\n02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:39,420\nSo, I hope you guys enjoyed the show,\n\n2592\n02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:42,790\nand we will see you next\ntime here at IT Pro TV.\n\n2593\n02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:44,160\n>> Absolutely, thank you all so much.\n\n2594\n02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:46,870\nHave a great

00:00:36,324\nGood morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:38,381\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,230\nI'm your host, Don Pazet.\n\n7\n00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,880\nBack again, once again,\nwith Mr. Adam Gordan.\n\n8\n00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,660\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,440\n>> Good, good, good.\n\n10\n00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,629\nVery good.\nThat would be me by the way.\n\n11\n00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,341\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,892\nThis guy.\n\n13\n00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:50,670\nSo.\n[LAUGH] Or do you wanna be Mike 2.0 today?\n\n14\n00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,090\n>> You know I was thinking\nabout of that because Mike and\n\n15\n00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,920\nI talked about that when we did\nsome of the other episodes.\n\n16\n00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,460\nWe were talking through the fact\nthat you had an impersonator.\n\n17\n00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,980\nThere was a little identify\ntheft going on there, so.\n\n18\n00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,505\n>> It's important during\na security show to demonstrate\n\n19\n00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:05,860\nthe topics that are on the exam.\n\n20\n00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,515\n>> It is, absolutely.\n\n21\n00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:08,510\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, well, ladies and\n\n22\n00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,350\ngentleman, we've got another\nexciting show ahead of us.\n\n23\n00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,230\nWe're going to be diving into\nmalicious Code and activities.\n\n24\n00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,250\nI know the title on the screen said\nmalware activities or whatever,\n\n25\n00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,430\ncuz just couldn't get enough\nletters on the screen.\n\n26\n00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,820\nBut we're gonna take a look at malware and\na lot of the things that are plaguing\n\n27\n00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,650\nthe bulk of users out there\njust on a daily basis.\n\n28\n00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,690\nSo this is good stuff,\nit's fun to talk about, and\n\n29\n00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,540\nboy there's a lot of it, right Adam?\n\n30\n00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,920\n>> Absolutely, absolutely there is.\n\n31\n00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,160\nAnd so let's talk a little bit, as we\nalways start off most of our conversations\n\n32\n00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,970\nin this grouping of topics around\nSSCP by really reminding you\n\n33\n00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,420\nof the three pillars that we focus on\nin each of our subject areas, right?\n\n34\n00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,520\nSo, we're focusing around confidentiality.\n\n35\n00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,440\nWe spent a lot of time when we were\ntalking through the cryptography material\n\n36\n00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,500\nabout focusing on the difference\nbetween achieving confidentiality and\n\n37\n00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,080\nachieving integrity through\nthe use of different mechanisms.\n\n38\n00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,700\nWhether it was encryption,\ndigital signatures, hashing, right?\n\n39\n00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,790\nAssociated with different functions\nthat we're looking to achieve.\n\n40\n00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,015\nSo confidentiality, securing information,\nkeeping it from prying eyes,\n\n41\n00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:14,065\nmaking sure the bad people don't see it,\nthe good people do.\n\n42\n00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:16,515\nBut only if they don't piss us off and\nwe let them, right?\n\n43\n00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:19,655\nThat's the bane of all the administrators\nout there, the users that we have.\n\n44\n00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:22,495\nBut you know if you think of them as job\nsecurity they're actually not a bad little\n\n45\n00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:23,355\ngroup of people, right?\n\n46\n00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:25,305\nSo, we have confidentially,\n\n47\n00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:30,535\nwe have integrity this idea of\nfocusing on information's value.\n\n48\n00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:34,100\nBut the value of the information from\nthe perspective of making sure that\n\n49\n00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,890\nthe information has not been modified,\nreally that's what integrity is all about.\n\n50\n00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,260\nSo again things like hashing and digital\nsignatures will provide proof of origin,\n\n51\n00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,040\nintegrity, can come at us different ways,\nwhether it's non repudiation,\n\n52\n00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,630\nproof of origin, or\njust the value of the information\n\n53\n00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,650\nis intact because it hasn't\nbeen modified with a hash.\n\n54\n00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,358\nAnd then we talk about availability.\n\n55\n00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:57,790\nAnd we’re gonna focus on availability as\none of the key areas in this particular\n\n56\n00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,710\ndiscussion, more so then confidentiality;\nalthough integrity is very important and\n\n57\n00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,870\nkind of paired with availability here.\n\n58\n00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,320\nBecause what we're really getting at is\nthis idea that malware, all the viruses,\n\n59\n00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,010\nworms, trojans, all the things\nwe're gonna be dealing with here,\n\n60\n00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,150\nare really gonna get in the way\nof availability, right?\n\n61\n00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,120\nTheir goal at the end of the day is to\nprevent us from accessing our systems,\n\n62\n00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,150\naccessing the information\nthat we need to use.\n\n63\n00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,630\nAnd in doing so really then effectively,\nnot only remove our ability to get to\n\n64\n00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,660\nthe information, but maybe manipulate the\ninformation, even take it away from us.\n\n65\n00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,700\nAnd maybe even take over\nour systems in the process.\n\n66\n00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,685\nSo we wanna make sure we're just\nthinking about this as we get started,\n\n67\n00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:36,675\nit's a very important concept.\n\n68\n00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,395\nAnd along those lines, we talked in some\nof our earlier episodes about risk,,\n\n69\n00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:43,745\nand we've, you know had to say about risk,\nwe had a whole section actually.\n\n70\n00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:48,045\nIn the FSCP body of knowledge, it deals\nspecifically with risk, risk analysis, and\n\n71\n00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:50,425\nunderstanding risk, business impact.\n\n72\n00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:53,755\nA lot of those terms and thoughts that\nwe've had and have discussed with you.\n\n73\n00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:57,115\nSo I want to remind you of the idea\nof risk here as we get started\n\n74\n00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:58,165\ntalking about these things.\n\n75\n00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:02,160\nBecause a lot of the stuff we\ndeal with here, is gonna be very,\n\n76\n00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,780\nvery problematic for us.\n\n77\n00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,860\nIf it get's into our systems,\nspreads through our networks.\n\n78\n00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,890\nPresents a tremendous threat, tremendous\nliability and risk to the business.\n\n79\n00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,840\nAnd potentially is really focused\non this idea of vulnerabilities and\n\n80\n00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,660\nvulnerability management.\n\n81\n00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,719\nSo we want to identify risk and understand\nthat in this section here as well as in\n\n82\n00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:23,901\nthe risk analysis section that we've\ntalked about, we really need to be focused\n\n83\n00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:26,976\non understanding the risks we\nas security professionals,\n\n84\n00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:30,580\nas practitioners face every day\nin the running of our networks.\n\n85\n00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,360\nThe ones that our users face,\nthe ones that we face.\n\n86\n00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,370\nAnd how we identify those risks, and\n\n87\n00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,410\nthen act on those threats and make sure\nwe have security awareness to support\n\n88\n00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,850\nthe vulnerability assessments\nthat are out there.\n\n89\n00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,175\nPenetration testing, all the terminology,\n\n90\n00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:47,700\nall the things that we've spoken\nabout before come back to play here.\n\n91\n00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,610\nAnd so, let's quickly talk about the four\nways that we can manage and identify risk.\n\n92\n00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,070\nWe've gone through them before.\n\n93\n00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,510\nWanna make sure we're focused on them so\nit's a good point, good knowledge item for\n\n94\n00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,870\nus to review at this point right now.\n\n95\n00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,000\nAnd you know maybe just a quick\ncheck of knowledge for you.\n\n96\n00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,550\nIf you have seen our episodes on risk and\n\n97\n00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,810\nrisk analysis, hopefully you'll remember\nthe four ways to deal with risk.\n\n98\n00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,760\nIf you don't, obviously you'll hear\nabout them in just a minute here.\n\n99\n00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,960\nBut if you haven't seen them, definitely\ngo back and take a look at them.\n\n100\n00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,210\nWatch through and make sure you're\nfamiliar with all the material on risk cuz\n\n101\n00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,940\nyou will get ready to, and prepare to\nanswer questions around cecoming an SSCP.\n\n102\n00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,120\nSo, let's go through the four different\nways we address and deal with risk.\n\n103\n00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,040\nIn no particular prioritized order by\nthe way, they are all equally important.\n\n104\n00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,220\nWe can accept risk.\n\n105\n00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,020\nRight?\nSo we can\n\n106\n00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,630\ndecide that risk is just\ngonna be apart of our life.\n\n107\n00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,130\nWe can transfer risk.\n\n108\n00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,910\nTransferring risk typically involves\nsomething like, maybe, getting insurance,\n\n109\n00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,270\nor giving somebody else the liability\nof helping manage our risk.\n\n110\n00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,490\nWe can avoid risk.\n\n111\n00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,110\nAnd we can mitigate risk.\n\n112\n00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,152\nMitigate typically means to minimize risk.\n\n113\n00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:54,060\nRight it's some way managing through\nit by removing elements in the system.\n\n114\n00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,010\nAnd somehow impacting the system in\na positive way to minimize the risk.\n\n115\n00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,890\nThe other thing to identify and\nbe aware of here when we deal with risk.\n\n116\n00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,106\nIs we start talking about identifying\nthe risk of threat exposure here,\n\n117\n00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:09,393\nvulnerabilities being assessed and\nunderstood in relation to malware,\n\n118\n00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:12,590\nis that we can never get\nto a zero risk solution.\n\n119\n00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,930\nMeaning no system that we run\nthat's connected to the internet,\n\n120\n00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,770\nthat people interact with, that is not\ntotally isolated in a little bubble\n\n121\n00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,350\nsomewhere, is gonna ever\nachieve a zero risk condition.\n\n122\n00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,140\nWhich means that there's always\nthe possibility, always the likelihood,\n\n123\n00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,710\nalthough it may be more remote at certain\npoints than at others, that this system\n\n124\n00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,620\ncan be infected, and that infection\ncan spread out beyond the system and\n\n125\n00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,180\npotentially impact other\nsystems negatively.\n\n126\n00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,630\nSo we wanna have that framework and\nthat thought process in mind\n\n127\n00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,540\nas we begin our discussions here to\ntruly understand the impact of risk and\n\n128\n00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,170\nalso remember that the way we understand\nrisk in relation to the business.\n\n129\n00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,130\nIs through something known as a,\nfill in the blank, right?\n\n130\n00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,200\nInteractive here.\n\n131\n00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,970\nRight, Don what do we think of when\nwe think of identifying risk and\n\n132\n00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,510\nunderstanding in relation to the business?\n\n133\n00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,950\nWe often talk about a business?\n\n134\n00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,710\n>> Business impact.\n\n135\n00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,040\n>> A business impact, and\n\n136\n00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,770\nmost importantly, business impact\nanalysis specifically, right?\n\n137\n00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,580\nWe think about a BIA.\n\n138\n00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,140\nAnd so also wanna make sure we understand\nthat the business impact analysis or\n\n139\n00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,680\nanalusus if we're making it plural.\n\n140\n00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,380\nThe business impact analysis what we\ncall the BIA the acronym for it right?\n\n141\n00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,520\nIs going to be how we frame the discussion\nof risk and what risk can mean for\n\n142\n00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,592\nthe business and what we call the business\ncontext and I want to be clear of these.\n\n143\n00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:31,890\nThese are different activities but\nwhat business impact analysis does\n\n144\n00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,120\nis it helps us to identify\nour critical focuses right?\n\n145\n00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,770\nOur critical business solutions,\nour critical success factors,\n\n146\n00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,580\nlots of different ways of naming them,\nbut what it really does is focus the mind\n\n147\n00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,560\nof the business on what the most\nimportant line of business elements are,\n\n148\n00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,550\nthe most important services and\nthings of that nature.\n\n149\n00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,870\nWe do the what if scenarios\naround what if we lost email?\n\n150\n00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,360\nWhat if we lost file and print?\n\n151\n00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,955\nWhat if we lost web and things like that?\n\n152\n00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:02,558\nAnd as a result of that, we're then able\nto identify the most critical systems that\n\n153\n00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:03,886\nhave to be maintained.\n\n154\n00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:09,180\nAnd rank and prioritize what systems\nhave to be recovered in what order.\n\n155\n00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,910\nThat then allows us to manage and\n\n156\n00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,210\nunderstand risk in\nrelation to the business.\n\n157\n00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,647\nAnd that's why business impact analysis\nand risk assessment go hand in hand.\n\n158\n00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:22,645\nAnd we have to remember that here, because\nwe're dealing with things that potentially\n\n159\n00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:27,070\ncan get out of hand very quickly and\ncause catastrophic chaos.\n\n160\n00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,450\nOh, CC, catastrophic chaos, right?\n\n161\n00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,750\nCan cause catastrophic chaos inside\nof our systems if we're not careful.\n\n162\n00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,060\nAll it takes is one user following\na socially engineered link to\n\n163\n00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,830\na website of some kind.\n\n164\n00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,409\nThat is infected with malware that has in\neffect malware teed up ready for download.\n\n165\n00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,583\nThey touch that site maybe through\nan iFrame or something like that,\n\n166\n00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,521\nthey get infected.\n\n167\n00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:51,925\nBecause the root kit or the remote access\nTrojan or whatever it may be that will be\n\n168\n00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:55,952\na targeting system will worm its way\nin and get it's way into the system.\n\n169\n00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,088\nAnd as a result of that interaction and\n\n170\n00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:02,430\nthat infection effectively they may\nbecome an active spreader of the virus,\n\n171\n00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,131\nalmost immediately of that worm or\nthat Trojan or whatever it is.\n\n172\n00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:10,418\nOr they may become a carrier where they're\ninfected, they may not realize it.\n\n173\n00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:14,190\nThey come back into the network or\ncontinue working in the network.\n\n174\n00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,580\nAnd as a result of that, they spread\nthat infection from point to point.\n\n175\n00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,830\nEvery time they touch a system,\n\n176\n00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,440\nthey access a file, they open email,\nthey go out and browse the web,\n\n177\n00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,100\nthey print a document, they're touching\nvarious places in our network.\n\n178\n00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,871\nAnd that architecture that is\nused in effect against us.\n\n179\n00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,378\nRight and\nour architecture that is used to spread,\n\n180\n00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:35,666\nas opposed to prevent\nthe spread of the virus.\n\n181\n00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,873\nAnd this may be a point to quickly throw\nup our defense in depth diagram just to\n\n182\n00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:42,790\ntalk about this idea of how\nwe build secure systems.\n\n183\n00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,920\nWe're gonna refer to this diagram\nseveral times throughout our\n\n184\n00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,930\nconversations in this episode.\n\n185\n00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,560\nAnd the idea here is that if you look\nat this, we have an Internet cloud, so\n\n186\n00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,744\nan external network,\nthe LAN somewhere out on the right there.\n\n187\n00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,674\nWe have our traditional firewall.\n\n188\n00:09:56,674 --> 00:10:01,103\nWe have our DMZ sitting in the middle\nof our kind of upper left hand\n\n189\n00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:02,343\nquadrant there.\n\n190\n00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:05,877\nWhere we have a well-defined logical\nnetwork that is separate from\n\n191\n00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:09,907\nthe Internet, separate from the WAN,\nseparate from the internal network,\n\n192\n00:10:09,907 --> 00:10:13,883\nseparate from the LAN down below, and\nwe may have multiple machines there.\n\n193\n00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:16,270\nWe just put a web server\nthere to represent one or\n\n194\n00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,129\nmore machines that could live here.\n\n195\n00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:23,020\nBut the idea is that this network,\nthis DMZ, is a separate logical network,\n\n196\n00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,687\nand in many cases is going to be a\nseparate physical network as well from our\n\n197\n00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:29,364\nother networks, right?\n\n198\n00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:32,356\nSo this is gonna be a place where\nwe can conduct business, that\n\n199\n00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:36,455\nis partially exposed the outside world,\npartially available to the inside world.\n\n200\n00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:41,055\nBut through firewalls that have well\ndefined business rules and open ports and\n\n201\n00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:45,943\nclosed ports that are being managed to\nthe maximum hopefully to provide security.\n\n202\n00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:49,117\nIf a machine in the DMZ were to get\ninfected with malware, it may or\n\n203\n00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:51,081\nmay not spread to the internal network,\n\n204\n00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,765\nbased on the configuration\nof the internal firewall.\n\n205\n00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:57,271\nBut if the workstation on the lower\nright-hand side, in the LAN,\n\n206\n00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:58,397\nwere to be infected,\n\n207\n00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:02,420\nthen all of a sudden anything behind\nthat DMZ potentially becomes a target.\n\n208\n00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,300\nAnd, obviously,\nour most important, most critical,\n\n209\n00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,885\ninfrastructure lives inside of that LAN,\nright?\n\n210\n00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,331\nWe may be able to sustain\nthe loss of a web server, but\n\n211\n00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:13,960\nit's a lot harder to sustain the loss\nof domain controllers, for instance.\n\n212\n00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,112\nBecause typically that's going to\nlead to some complications and\n\n213\n00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:19,994\ninterruptions of service within\nour network very quickly.\n\n214\n00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:24,342\nSo just think about this concept of what\na DMZ represents in our discussions.\n\n215\n00:11:24,342 --> 00:11:27,060\nThink about this idea of defense in depth.\n\n216\n00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,384\nWe've often talked about it, and\nwe do often talk about it in information\n\n217\n00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:33,508\nsecurity as being the underlying\narchitecture at the end of the day.\n\n218\n00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:38,740\nThe most important architecture we build\non, because it is the thought process\n\n219\n00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,829\nthat from everything else we do is really\ngonna underlie all the things we do.\n\n220\n00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,615\nYou know, all goodness, I often say when\nI'm discussing this with customers or\n\n221\n00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:48,401\nwith students.\n\n222\n00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:53,274\nAll goodness comes from or all badness can\nemanate from the architecture that you put\n\n223\n00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:55,410\non the ground inside your networks.\n\n224\n00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,640\nIf you have well thought out\ndefense in depth solutions.\n\n225\n00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,580\nYou have logical as well as physical\nisolation of your network segments you're\n\n226\n00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,483\ngoing to be a lot stronger in terms of\nyour ability to withstand these attacks.\n\n227\n00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:09,005\nThat we're going to start documenting for\nyou shortly,\n\n228\n00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,590\nthan you will if you don't\nhave these solutions in place.\n\n229\n00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,550\nIf your definition of\na firewall is what's running on\n\n230\n00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,089\nthe endpoint on the workstation, that's\nunder the user's control, that may or\n\n231\n00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:22,927\nmay not be configured properly to\nwithstand these kinds of attacks.\n\n232\n00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:28,607\nAnd there's no front facing coordinated\neffort to create a defense perimeter that\n\n233\n00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:33,980\nis managed by IT within the organization\nat a central, more focused way.\n\n234\n00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,910\nIt's very unlikely that that\nworkstation is going to stay secure for\n\n235\n00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,490\nvery long, so just think about that as\n\n236\n00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,690\na thought process as we really lay\nout the beginning conversations here.\n\n237\n00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,900\nAround what viruses, what worms,\nwhat Trojans, and what malware in general,\n\n238\n00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,130\nthese categories can really do and\npotentially do to impact your systems.\n\n239\n00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,460\nAll right, so let's talk a little bit.\n\n240\n00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,290\nHaving said that I know we've put\ntogether a very long laundry list of\n\n241\n00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,020\nthings that we wanna go through with you.\n\n242\n00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,130\nDon was kind enough to scribe and\ntake some notes as I rambled on here.\n\n243\n00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,300\nAnd so let's go ahead and\n\n244\n00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,110\nlet's talk about some of\nthe different categories of malware.\n\n245\n00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,200\nThat may be of interest to you, and\nthat obviously as an SSCP candidate,\n\n246\n00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,460\nyou're gonna want to be thinking about and\nmaking sure that you're focused on.\n\n247\n00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,606\nSo let's start with viruses.\n\n248\n00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:20,280\nAnd viruses are going to be\nthings that can obviously,\n\n249\n00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,025\njust like they do in the real world,\n\n250\n00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:25,529\ninfect us if we're not paying attention\nto what's going on around us.\n\n251\n00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,985\nIn the real world, if somebody's sneezing\nand coughing, maybe blowing their nose,\n\n252\n00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:32,498\nmaybe they have an allergy,\nmaybe they don't.\n\n253\n00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:36,700\nWe don't know, but they could be sick and\nif they're sick there's the possibility\n\n254\n00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,191\nthat they could spread the virus or\nwhatever it is that they have to us,\n\n255\n00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:42,710\nwhether it's the flu or\na cold or who knows what.\n\n256\n00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,500\nAnd so when we think about\nthat in terms of computers\n\n257\n00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,020\nwe think about the same behavior.\n\n258\n00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,540\nA virus is something that will\nspread from computer to computer but\n\n259\n00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,950\nrequires interaction in order to do that,\nto spread.\n\n260\n00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,830\nSo we may spread the virus\nby giving somebody a file,\n\n261\n00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,996\nsending them a file that's infected.\n\n262\n00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:03,442\nWe may spread it by giving them a file\non a USB drive and saying, hey, here,\n\n263\n00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,299\nplug this in.\n\n264\n00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:08,874\nAnd if we don't run a virus scan on that\nsystem, or on that drive to figure out\n\n265\n00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:13,360\nwhat's there, that virus could\nactually then infect that system.\n\n266\n00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,090\nAnd it requires some sort of interaction,\ntypically human interaction,\n\n267\n00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,102\nin order to spread.\n\n268\n00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:19,910\nSo understand, it's a definition point.\n\n269\n00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,470\nIn order to replicate\nviruses require interaction.\n\n270\n00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,234\nViruses typically are made up of two\nparts, we look at the viruses being\n\n271\n00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:31,015\nmade up of a replication mechanism\nin some kind, whatever that may be.\n\n272\n00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:34,530\nThere's many different ways to think of\nwhat replication mechanisms could be.\n\n273\n00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,703\nAnd then there is a payload,\nthe thing that we want to actually\n\n274\n00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:41,851\ndeliver to the system, in order to make\nsure that when it does infect the system,\n\n275\n00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:43,700\nthat that's the outcome, right?\n\n276\n00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,050\nThe payload may be that it\nhas some sort of a program\n\n277\n00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,140\nthat will open up a backdoor, right?\n\n278\n00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,530\nSo maybe it's a remote access virus.\n\n279\n00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,130\nSo it will open up a backdoor and somehow\nthen let the system be overtaken and\n\n280\n00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,620\nbecome maybe a bot or a zombie.\n\n281\n00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,580\nCould be a virus that will simply\nInteract with information on the system,\n\n282\n00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,800\ngrab any file that may have\nsome sort of a designation\n\n283\n00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,240\nwith things like credit card numbers or\nthings like that in it.\n\n284\n00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,219\nThen scoop that information up and\n\n285\n00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:15,359\nthen somehow exit that\ninformation out of the system,\n\n286\n00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:19,878\nmaybe send it out through some sort of\nsurreptitious, hidden transmission.\n\n287\n00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,763\nThere's lots of different things\nviruses potentially can do.\n\n288\n00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:26,644\nSo, think about the fact that we have this\nreplication mechanism and this payload.\n\n289\n00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:30,179\nThese are the two defining\ncharacteristics of what a virus will be.\n\n290\n00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,043\nWhen we think about a worm, we think about\na worm as being something that reproduces\n\n291\n00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:37,757\non its own, as opposed to a virus that\nrequires interaction in order to spread.\n\n292\n00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:41,930\nAnd it typically will target\nservers as opposed to workstations.\n\n293\n00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,200\nYou can find worms on workstations,\nbut more often than not,\n\n294\n00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,780\nthey will target servers, whereas viruses\ntend to target, more often than not tend\n\n295\n00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,990\nto target end points or\nworkstations traditionally, right?\n\n296\n00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,724\nSo just be aware that's probably a good\nsub-point for us to throw up there.\n\n297\n00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:58,816\nWe didn't really mention\nthat particular one, but\n\n298\n00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:01,493\nit may be worth just capturing them,\nright?\n\n299\n00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,137\nAnd also viruses tend to not to be overt,\nright?\n\n300\n00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:07,464\nWe don't tend to see them\nnecessarily in the system, and\n\n301\n00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:09,240\nthey'd be running behind the scenes.\n\n302\n00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,183\nYou tend to see activity and\nmaybe understand that they're there, but\n\n303\n00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:15,565\nthey could be sitting dormant for a period\nof time until they actually go active and\n\n304\n00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:16,119\ninfect you.\n\n305\n00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:19,743\nSo we'll talk about that, logic bombs for\ninstance, or you're gonna be in this\n\n306\n00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:22,623\ncategory where they sit dormant\nuntil a certain period of time or\n\n307\n00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:25,743\nsome sort of triggering condition\ntypically rears it's ugly head.\n\n308\n00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:27,044\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n309\n00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:30,457\nSo worms have been around for\nsome time, as have viruses by the way.\n\n310\n00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,781\nAlmost immediately after\ncreating the computer and\n\n311\n00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:35,577\ncoming up with the general concept\nof what a computer would be,\n\n312\n00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,055\nsomebody went out and said okay,\nnow that we have this,\n\n313\n00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:41,300\nlet's come up with ways that we can\neffectively use it to our advantage.\n\n314\n00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,920\nAnd so very early on, we see the advent\nof these systems, solutions that\n\n315\n00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,720\nare coming out that are trying to take\nover a system with malware emerging.\n\n316\n00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,150\nThey're not obviously gonna be anywhere\nnear sophisticated as they are today.\n\n317\n00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,640\nSome of the original early worms and\n\n318\n00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,135\nearly viruses were pretty\nsimplistic by today's standards.\n\n319\n00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,750\nSo things like the Melissa Virus,\n\n320\n00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,600\nthe I Love You Virus, the Morris Worm,\nthese are historical references.\n\n321\n00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,230\nMacro viruses that would have been\naround back in the maybe the 90s\n\n322\n00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,020\nto affect things like Microsoft Word or\nthe early 2000s.\n\n323\n00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,210\nThose kind of viruses and\n\n324\n00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,920\nthose kind of worms are child's play\ncompared to what we face today.\n\n325\n00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,310\nBut as we go up the scale and\n\n326\n00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,150\nget closer to the modern day, obviously\nthings become a lot more complicated,\n\n327\n00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,380\nbecause our systems have\nbecome a lot more complicated.\n\n328\n00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,510\nWe went from several thousand lines of\ncode to several million lines of code in\n\n329\n00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,878\nmodern operating systems, at least\nthe Wintel based operating systems today.\n\n330\n00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:39,040\nLinux-based operating systems\nnowhere near as involved,\n\n331\n00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,920\nin the sense of having that many\nlines of code in them traditionally.\n\n332\n00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,290\nBecause a lot of the times, most of that\ncode is really being used to feed things\n\n333\n00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,240\nlike interactive GUI interfaces and\ntouch interfaces and things like that.\n\n334\n00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,530\nSo you take all that out of the area and\n\n335\n00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,790\nyou just use a very, very stripped\ndown kind of basic operating system.\n\n336\n00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,980\nYou're talking about a much smaller,\nwhat we call attack surface, and\n\n337\n00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,330\nobviously viruses, worms, and all these\nother things, Trojans, logic bombs,\n\n338\n00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,360\nall the other things will go through here.\n\n339\n00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,130\nThe attack surface is really what\nthose systems are gonna present,\n\n340\n00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,020\nwhether it's a computer or server, that\nthese particular pieces of software, or\n\n341\n00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,500\nthese malicious code items,\ncan attach to and\n\n342\n00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,442\nreally latch onto when\nwe think about that.\n\n343\n00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:21,890\nYou wanna have as small an attack surface\nas possible, much like when we talk about\n\n344\n00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,982\nstealthing a plane or stealthing\nsomething in the military sense.\n\n345\n00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:31,130\nWe wanna reduce the surface that that\nparticular item presents to radar\n\n346\n00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,290\nby either absorbing incoming signals or\nsomehow changing the geometry and\n\n347\n00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,980\nthe shape we present as a radar profile\n\n348\n00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,730\nto minimize the potential that\nwe can actually discover.\n\n349\n00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,850\nSo it's basically the same concept here.\n\n350\n00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,416\nIf we can stealth our machines\nby reducing the attack surface,\n\n351\n00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,872\nminimizing things like services that\nare running that we don't really need.\n\n352\n00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:52,659\nSo I think I mentioned this\nin one of our other episodes.\n\n353\n00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,380\nWhy on earth do we have sound\ndrivers in virtual machines?\n\n354\n00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,190\nBecause the reality is in a virtual\nserver, you're not gonna use a sound\n\n355\n00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,780\ndriver, yet they're available\ntraditionally on virtualization platforms.\n\n356\n00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,240\nWe need that really with a VDI solution,\nwith a virtual desktop solution, but\n\n357\n00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,900\nwe don't need it in a server that's\ngonna be a virtualized mail server or\n\n358\n00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,660\nvirtualized web server.\n\n359\n00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,790\nHaving that may or may not open up the\nattack surface and make it broader, but\n\n360\n00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,220\nthe idea is that every little\nthing we can reduce and\n\n361\n00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,990\nget out of a system is\ngonna make it more secure.\n\n362\n00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,040\nSo strip away all the, what we just\ngenerically call the nuisance wear, right?\n\n363\n00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,610\nAll that free software\nthat gets installed.\n\n364\n00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,770\nGet rid of all those services that\nare running that you don't need.\n\n365\n00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,590\nDon't add features and roles in the\nsystems just because they're there, right?\n\n366\n00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,530\nServers don't need games on them, right?\n\n367\n00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,630\nServers don't need media players on them.\n\n368\n00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,140\nServers should not have web\nbrowsers on them unless you have\n\n369\n00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,950\na reason to go out to the internet.\n\n370\n00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,268\nAnd so, you may be stuck\nwith Internet Explorer, but\n\n371\n00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:53,028\nthat doesn't mean you need Google Chrome,\nand it doesn't mean you need Firefox, and\n\n372\n00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,831\nit doesn't mean you need Safari, just so\n\n373\n00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:58,320\nyou have every browser that you\npossibly could ever want to use, right?\n\n374\n00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,170\nServers may need Adobe Acrobat Reader, so\nyou can look at PDFs, but they shouldn't\n\n375\n00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,065\nhave a full blown installation of Adobe\nProfessional Suite for instance, right?\n\n376\n00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:08,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'll think through the logic\n\n377\n00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,000\nof this stuff.\n\n378\n00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,025\nYou don't need Microsoft Office\ninstalled on a server.\n\n379\n00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,875\nAll you probably need is a word viewer,\nright?\n\n380\n00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,501\nIf you think about the logic of that.\n\n381\n00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:19,377\nSo, things like that are where we\ntend to see mistakes happening and\n\n382\n00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:23,933\nthings like that are why we wind up with\nbroader attack surfaces that this kind of\n\n383\n00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,225\ndiscussion leads to,\n\n384\n00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:29,365\nwhere we have all this malware\ntaking advantage of our severs.\n\n385\n00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:32,520\nActive X Controls,\nSilverlight, things like that.\n\n386\n00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,740\nFlash, for instance, another huge one.\n\n387\n00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,750\nShockwave.\n\n388\n00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,600\nWhy do you put that stuff on your servers?\n\n389\n00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,320\nAbsolutely no reason to have it there.\n\n390\n00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,520\nOpen yourself up to a huge\nliability in terms of security,\n\n391\n00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,890\nin terms of your attack profile.\n\n392\n00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,633\nSo, think about defense in depth, coming\nback to this idea for just a minute,\n\n393\n00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:52,265\nas being not just architecture, but\nalso architecture of the broad sense,\n\n394\n00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:56,320\nlogical and physical, but think about\nit as being down to the desktop, right?\n\n395\n00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,365\nHow do we architect that one machine?\n\n396\n00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:02,440\nAnd then, how do we architect that\nmachine's connectivity out to the network?\n\n397\n00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,360\nHow do we architect the network\nin relation to that machine and\n\n398\n00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,630\nother machines around it?\n\n399\n00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,200\nAnd ultimately as we build\nthese concentric rings,\n\n400\n00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,197\nI'm running out of room on\nthe screen to do this, right?\n\n401\n00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:12,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How do we then\n\n402\n00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,280\narchitect over all holistically, right?\n\n403\n00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,580\nHow do we architect the entire thought\nprocess of WAN, LAN, desktop, right?\n\n404\n00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,330\nAnd if we can think about those areas and\nhave defense and\n\n405\n00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,980\ndepth thought processes in all of them,\n\n406\n00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,490\nwe're gonna be a lot better off than\nif we just kind of wing it, literally.\n\n407\n00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,270\nAnd just decide one day that we may or\nmay not install something.\n\n408\n00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,760\nAnd, so you're thinking about processes,\nour procedures, our policies,\n\n409\n00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,060\nall the things we've talked about in some\nof the other episodes we've done with you,\n\n410\n00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,440\nor we will be talking about again\nas we continue our discussions.\n\n411\n00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,880\nAll this comes together.\n\n412\n00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,800\nIt's a recipe.\n\n413\n00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,290\nI often talk about the fact that\nwhen we do information security and\n\n414\n00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,370\ninformation security management,\nas security professionals,\n\n415\n00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,802\nit's a lot like making a meal.\n\n416\n00:21:54,802 --> 00:21:58,215\nAnd a good meal is made up of lots\nof different elements, right?\n\n417\n00:21:58,215 --> 00:22:02,145\nIt's as much the ambiance as it\nis what you put on the table and\n\n418\n00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:06,225\nhow it tastes and\nthe overall theme of the meal.\n\n419\n00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,425\nIs it gonna be Mexican?\n\n420\n00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:08,765\nIs it gonna be Italian?\n\n421\n00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:11,525\nIs it gonna be, I don't know,\nwhat else have we out there?\n\n422\n00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:12,425\nJapanese, right?\n\n423\n00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:13,155\nIt may be sushi.\n\n424\n00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:13,725\nWho knows what?\n\n425\n00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:17,120\nBut the idea is that whatever it is,\nyou gotta have a theme, and\n\n426\n00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,070\nyou gotta have the ability to understand\nhow to execute on that theme,\n\n427\n00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,720\nto the point that you create in the minds\nof the people that are consuming it,\n\n428\n00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,420\nyour end users in your network, success.\n\n429\n00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,020\nAnd for them, remember, the end user, for\nthem success is I go about my business,\n\n430\n00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,150\nI don't get bothered, and\nI can do what I wanna do, right?\n\n431\n00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,160\nAs security professionals, our definition\nof success is a little bit different.\n\n432\n00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,150\nWe don't want end users going about\ntheir business unrestricted and\n\n433\n00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,500\ndoing what they want to do.\n\n434\n00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,160\nWe want them in a box and only allow them\nto do what we want them to do, and so\n\n435\n00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,360\nthere's this yin and yang of information\nsecurity that we often talk about.\n\n436\n00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,750\nAnd building that box is all\nabout defense and depth, and\n\n437\n00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,830\nthat's really what we wanna make sure\nwe're thinking about and focusing on here.\n\n438\n00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,715\n>> Adam, I don't know that I've ever\nheard anybody use a food analogy while\n\n439\n00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,415\ndescribing viruses and worms.\n\n440\n00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:06,585\n>> Oh, I've got a whole bunch of them,\nactually.\n\n441\n00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,664\n>> [LAUGH] It's somewhat unsettling.\n\n442\n00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:15,110\n>> Well, only if you think about it\nI guess, in perhaps a broad sense.\n\n443\n00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,130\nBut just trying to be as\ninclusive as we can possibly be.\n\n444\n00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,880\nSo any of those gourmets out\nthere that are looking for\n\n445\n00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,227\ncooking as well as security,\nwe have a program just for you.\n\n446\n00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:27,980\nAll right, so let's go back to some of\nour definitions we were working through,\n\n447\n00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,705\nI think viruses,\nwe had talked about viruses and worms.\n\n448\n00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:32,954\n>> So let's talk about Trojans\na little bit here, right?\n\n449\n00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,135\nMoving down our list.\n\n450\n00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:37,775\nSo Trojans are gonna typically masquerade\nas legitimate software, right?\n\n451\n00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:42,265\nSo we often see these as things like\nscreen savers you can download or\n\n452\n00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:43,667\nwallpaper.\n\n453\n00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:48,712\nPrograms you can install, or happy dancing\nunicorns, or whatever they may be, right?\n\n454\n00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:51,915\nAnd so those kind of things are again\ntypically socially engineered.\n\n455\n00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:56,905\nYou're given a URL, you're attracted to\na site somewhere where you download stuff.\n\n456\n00:23:56,905 --> 00:24:01,130\nThey are often associated, as you can see,\nthey're with social engineering.\n\n457\n00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,630\nHappy dancing unicorns, right?\n\n458\n00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,450\nThat's a good one to capture there,\nexactly.\n\n459\n00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,032\nAlong with purple squirrels,\nthat's also another good one.\n\n460\n00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:12,670\nAnd so typically,\nTrojans do not self replicate.\n\n461\n00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,840\nTrojans, in other words, affect a single\nmachine, unlike viruses and or worms,\n\n462\n00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,000\nthat are looking to replicate.\n\n463\n00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,300\nWorms especially will self replicate.\n\n464\n00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,920\nTrojans do not self replicate.\n\n465\n00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,020\nThey must be spread.\n\n466\n00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,380\nSomebody must give you\nthe infected executable, the MSI,\n\n467\n00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,100\nor whatever it is that's gonna spread\nthat, and then you have to install that in\n\n468\n00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,740\norder to effectively render that\nmachine then infected by the Trojan.\n\n469\n00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,950\nAnd they often include what\nare called back door mechanisms.\n\n470\n00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,360\nA lot of remote access\nsolutions that are being\n\n471\n00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,960\nproffered by people that are hacking\nthe systems today, RATs as we call them,\n\n472\n00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,570\nRemote Access Trojans,\nare coming in disguise.\n\n473\n00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,730\nSo somebody downloads a program,\ninstalls or executes the program,\n\n474\n00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,150\nand all of a sudden, they got a bunch\nof ports that have been opened up, or\n\n475\n00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:58,720\nthe firewall's been redirected, and\nas a result of that, now somebody can\n\n476\n00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,450\nreach out remotely and get into this\nmachine almost on-demand, right?\n\n477\n00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,935\nWe might not even know they're there.\n\n478\n00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,471\nAnd so, programs like port scanners and\nprograms such as Nmap,\n\n479\n00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:11,661\nI know we've talked talked about Nmap\nin some of our prior discussions, and\n\n480\n00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:14,240\neven shown you once or\ntwice how Nmap can work.\n\n481\n00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,950\nPrograms like that and like port scanners,\ncan be very effective at violating, or\n\n482\n00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,920\nexcuse me,\n\n483\n00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,930\ngetting into this idea of understanding\nwhat's been done to your machine.\n\n484\n00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,190\nHow it's been violated.\n\n485\n00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,780\nAnd as a result of that,\ndisrupting the Trojan.\n\n486\n00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,420\nBecause what you can do then is\nunderstand what ports are open,\n\n487\n00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,940\nwhat services are running that\nwere not there before, and\n\n488\n00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,460\nthen you can take some sort\nof remediative action.\n\n489\n00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,130\nSo you can identify the risk and\nthen obviously minimize it.\n\n490\n00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,430\nBut what you need here is the idea of\nhaving a baseline associated with your\n\n491\n00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,080\nmachine to understand\nwhat normal behavior is.\n\n492\n00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,920\nSo when you run this scanner,\nit tells you, hey,\n\n493\n00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,920\nall of a sudden I've got these\nports in the 40,000 range\n\n494\n00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,200\nthat seem to appear to be open, but\nnormally I never see those ports.\n\n495\n00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,600\nEven though they're dynamic and may or may\nnot actually be open on a regular basis,\n\n496\n00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,330\nthey're not normally there,\nnow all of a sudden they are.\n\n497\n00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,900\nSo that may be unusual, and\n\n498\n00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,500\nthen you want to drill in and\nfind out what's going on there.\n\n499\n00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,270\nNow keep in mind a lot of Trojans,\nespecially in the Windows world, are gonna\n\n500\n00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,310\nrun in the GUI in some way, but they\ncan manipulate what goes on in the GUI.\n\n501\n00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,020\nAnd so, as a result of this,\n\n502\n00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,980\nyou may not be able to get to\ncertain control interfaces.\n\n503\n00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,480\nThey may interdict and\nblock signals or requests for\n\n504\n00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,250\nservice that go from you through a run\nline into the kernel to execute, and so\n\n505\n00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,250\nyou may not be able to\nbring up your virus scan.\n\n506\n00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,010\nYou may not be able to launch\ncertain programs because\n\n507\n00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:33,440\nthese Trojans have a list of executables\nor MSIs that they go look for and tag and\n\n508\n00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,925\neffectively interdict the execution\nof those system programs.\n\n509\n00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:39,885\nI know you have the malware\ndetection solution running\n\n510\n00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:42,605\nin the Windows environment that we\nsaid we would just throw up quickly.\n\n511\n00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:45,225\nIn Windows 8, for instance,\nwe have Windows Defender.\n\n512\n00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:50,035\nAnd so Windows Defender, what happens\nwith a lot of these Trojans is,\n\n513\n00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:55,035\nthe Trojan will have a hit list of files\nthat it's gonna look for and block.\n\n514\n00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:58,385\nAnd so as a result, Windows Defender\nmay be blocked from coming up,\n\n515\n00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:01,340\nyou may not be able to run an update\nto find the latest spyware and\n\n516\n00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,010\nvirus definitions to then\nget rid of this thing.\n\n517\n00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,220\nAnd so this can be very, very problematic.\n\n518\n00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,020\nBecause if you can't launch\nyour antivirus software,\n\n519\n00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,610\nyou may not actually be able to\nget this stuff off the system.\n\n520\n00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:17,250\nSo what we often find we have to do is\nrun programs off of a USB drive that\n\n521\n00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,000\nare actually not installed, but execute\nlocally right off the drive to scan\n\n522\n00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,410\nthe system, because a lot of the installed\nsoftware tends to prove to be an issue.\n\n523\n00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,560\nAnd so what I often have on\nmy machine at any one time,\n\n524\n00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,380\nis have a bunch of these things installed.\n\n525\n00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,602\nBut I also keep a bunch in a little\ntoolkit that I can walk around with,\n\n526\n00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:36,880\nthat effectively, literally,\nI'll carry in my pocket.\n\n527\n00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,580\nAnd I think I may even have,\nyeah I do have.\n\n528\n00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,810\nSo, in my pocket,\nwhat I keep is two things typically.\n\n529\n00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,058\nI have an SD card of some kind that\nI often will walk around with..\n\n530\n00:27:47,058 --> 00:27:49,800\nBecause if it's a device\nthat I can put a reader and\n\n531\n00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,640\nsimply execute off this, because maybe\nthe USB ports have been disabled.\n\n532\n00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,040\nSo, for instance, you know I do a lot of\nwork for military and government clients.\n\n533\n00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,200\nIn many cases, those secure systems\nare not gonna allow USB access, and\n\n534\n00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,050\nI have a lot private sector\nclients don't allow USB access.\n\n535\n00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,200\nAnd so something like an SD card\nreader may or may not work, and\n\n536\n00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,920\nsomething like a USB drive may or\nmay not work, right?\n\n537\n00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,100\nSo we have to understand that\nthere's lots of ways to do this.\n\n538\n00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,200\nI carry the same information with\nme typically on a DVD or a CD-ROM\n\n539\n00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,070\nbecause they may block that, but they\nmay not block the CD or DVD-ROM access.\n\n540\n00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,890\nAnd so, those are the kind of\nthings that as a professional,\n\n541\n00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,520\ndoing information security out\nin the field, if you do this,\n\n542\n00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,180\nobviously you're already\nthinking about these things.\n\n543\n00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,570\nBut if you're just starting out,\n\n544\n00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,880\nmaybe you're not familiar with some of\nthese processes that we have to engage in.\n\n545\n00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,190\nYou may wanna think about that, right?\n\n546\n00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,020\nBuild your toolkit.\n\n547\n00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,070\nI remember years ago,\nwhen I first started out.\n\n548\n00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,950\nAnd this is back in the old school dark\ndays when dinosaurs roamed the computing\n\n549\n00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,930\nlandscape.\n\n550\n00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:52,470\nAnd floppy disks were new, I used to walk\naround with several bags or satchels.\n\n551\n00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,750\nWe probably all have had this experience\nif we have done this long enough, and\n\n552\n00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,300\nI walked around with my tool kit.\n\n553\n00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,730\nMy DOS drivers, my floppy disks.\n\n554\n00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,360\nAnd I go back to the day when they were\nfive and a quarter discs by the way,\n\n555\n00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,690\nnot three and a half.\n\n556\n00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,335\nI used to walk around with those,\nand we used to have those.\n\n557\n00:29:08,335 --> 00:29:10,720\nWe used to have all\nthe software we would need,\n\n558\n00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,250\nwould typically be downloaded and\nprecompiled for us.\n\n559\n00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,590\nAnd so, we would walk around with DOS and\nDOS boot disks, and\n\n560\n00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,700\nall this stuff, because we may have\nto reinstall a system, redo an MBR,\n\n561\n00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,440\na Master Boot Record might\nhave become corrupt, reset it.\n\n562\n00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,652\nAll sorts of stuff.\n\n563\n00:29:24,652 --> 00:29:28,730\nAnd so, we would literally walk around\nwith these, either backpacks or\n\n564\n00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,110\nbinders full of software to be able\nto effectively do the same thing.\n\n565\n00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,620\nToday, obviously,\na lot more portable right?\n\n566\n00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,460\n>> Yeah, I used to carry\naround the one hundred disk-\n\n567\n00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,170\n>> Yeah the binders, the sleeves.\n\n568\n00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,030\n>> CD binders, yeah exactly.\n\n569\n00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,730\nI used to carry that same thing around,\nand I was talking about it on our show\n\n570\n00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,120\na few months ago, and\none of our viewers showed me something.\n\n571\n00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,690\nLet me show you this.\n\n572\n00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,120\nThis will show you how outdated I am.\n\n573\n00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,640\n>> I actually converted all\nmine to CD holders now, so\n\n574\n00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,735\nI have all my CDs in those right,\nbut yeah.\n\n575\n00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:53,215\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh, isostick.\n\n576\n00:29:53,215 --> 00:29:53,900\n>> Isostick.\n\n577\n00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,610\n>> Yeah sure.\n\n578\n00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,925\n>> You rip all your discs to ISO,\nand you stick them on this, and\n\n579\n00:29:57,925 --> 00:29:59,430\nit emulates a CD drive.\n\n580\n00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,480\n>> Absolutely.\n>> It's really amazing.\n\n581\n00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,282\n>> Yeah, self-contained.\n\n582\n00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:04,070\n>> So nobody has to carry\nthe big binders anymore, and so\n\n583\n00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,340\nit makes me feel a little old.\n\n584\n00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,300\nBut yeah, I did the same thing as you.\n\n585\n00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,590\nJust this huge collection cuz you\nnever knew what you we're gonna need.\n\n586\n00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,140\n>> Very true.\nAnd you know, so the Boy Scout motto,\n\n587\n00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,980\nalways be prepared, be prepared,\nis really important for\n\n588\n00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,680\nyou as security professionals.\n\n589\n00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,760\nAnd just out beyond what we're\ntalking about here, right?\n\n590\n00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,210\nIt's not just in this one area,\n\n591\n00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,410\nit's in any of the areas that make\nup the SSCP body of knowledge.\n\n592\n00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:30,285\nBut even more broadly, SSCP is simply\none stop on the overall journey you're\n\n593\n00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:34,225\ntrying to take or beginning to take,\nas you become an IT professional.\n\n594\n00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:35,415\nAnd over the course of your career,\n\n595\n00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:38,835\nyou're gonna spend a lot of time\ndoing a lot of different things.\n\n596\n00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:41,986\nYou may be interested in\ncertifying in Cisco, for instance.\n\n597\n00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:46,585\nAnd so, may wanna look at the CCNA\ncontent that we have available.\n\n598\n00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:50,490\nAnd you may ultimately decide that you\nwant to become an MCSE or an MCSA.\n\n599\n00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,725\nOr you may decide that you wanna become,\noh, I don't know,\n\n600\n00:30:53,725 --> 00:30:59,520\nmaybe a manager, a CISSP,\nor somebody like that,\n\n601\n00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,140\nover time as you professionally\nprogress through your career.\n\n602\n00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,946\nAnd at every stage, you're gonna have to\nthink about what does being prepared mean\n\n603\n00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:09,465\nin this part of my career?\n\n604\n00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:11,701\nWhat are the activities\nI'm gonna encounter, and\n\n605\n00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:14,310\nwhat are the challenges that I\nmay ultimately have to face?\n\n606\n00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,010\nSo, you'll be thinking about that,\nand when we talk about this idea of\n\n607\n00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,770\nthis toolkit, and what my tools look like,\nand what I bring to the table\n\n608\n00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,140\nas a professional,\nit's not just about the software, right?\n\n609\n00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,560\nIt's also about the skills.\n\n610\n00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,120\nBut it's about the ability to use\nthose two things in tandem together\n\n611\n00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,680\nto create the most opportune solutions\nthat you can then bring to the table for\n\n612\n00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,560\nyour customers at the end of the day.\n\n613\n00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,910\nSo I know we've defined virus,\nworm, and Trojan, right?\n\n614\n00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,990\nWe've talked a little about\nthe overview concept of defense and\n\n615\n00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,590\ndepth and what that means.\n\n616\n00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,205\nProbably a good place for\nus to pause for a couple minutes.\n\n617\n00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,779\nTake a break and then when we come back,\n\n618\n00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:50,232\nwe'll continue our conversations\naround malicious code.\n\n619\n00:31:50,232 --> 00:31:51,970\n>> All right, so ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n620\n00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,198\nWe'll be back in just a few.\n\n621\n00:31:54,198 --> 00:32:02,115\n[MUSIC]\n\n622\n00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:04,040\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n623\n00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,810\nSo we left off talking about\nlaundry list of virus types or\n\n624\n00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,440\nreally just malicious code type.\n\n625\n00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,590\n>> Absolutely.\n\n626\n00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,020\nAbsolutely.\n>> And we're going to pick back up,\n\n627\n00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,720\nI think we left off with logic bombs.\n\n628\n00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,620\nRight?\n>> We did.\n\n629\n00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,310\nWe did.\nAnd you know, just something interesting,\n\n630\n00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,960\nwe didn't really get a chance to\ntalk during the session break.\n\n631\n00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,450\nBut one of the things that popped up on\nthe radar in the last couple of days.\n\n632\n00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,220\nThis is about as live as live gets, right,\nwe were talking about remote exploits,\n\n633\n00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,220\nabout trojans in our last discussion,\nremote access.\n\n634\n00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,220\nOne of the things that's making the rounds\nright now in the security news,\n\n635\n00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,190\nand in lot of the chat rooms Is\nthe idea of remote USB access.\n\n636\n00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,250\nIn the site you have being able\nto use a remote USB solution\n\n637\n00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,280\nto be able to effectively\ntake over a server.\n\n638\n00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,040\nWindows 12 for\ninstance suffers from this potentially.\n\n639\n00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,045\nAnd to now instead of having to\nphysically plug a USB device in\n\n640\n00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:55,565\nto infect a system and\npotentially take it over.\n\n641\n00:32:55,565 --> 00:32:58,085\nYou can remotely knock that server offline\n\n642\n00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:02,015\nby using a remote USB device that's\nbeen effectively added to the system.\n\n643\n00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:03,620\nSo you don't even need\nphysical access anymore.\n\n644\n00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,831\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We don't even need USB device\n\n645\n00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:07,087\ndocks anymore.\n\n646\n00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:12,697\nBecause now with RemoteFX, which is\nthe remote USB solution that Microsoft,\n\n647\n00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:14,647\nfor instance, has turned on in the kernel.\n\n648\n00:33:14,647 --> 00:33:17,867\nAnd by exposing the Windows\nkernel through these solutions.\n\n649\n00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:22,257\nWe effectively can add USB\ndevices to a remote machine,\n\n650\n00:33:22,257 --> 00:33:24,300\na virtual machine as well, for instance.\n\n651\n00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,020\nAnd as a result of that we\nactually now run the liability\n\n652\n00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,720\nof potentially seeing these machines\ntaken over and blue screened.\n\n653\n00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,980\nAnd there's some well documented\ndiscussions coming out of the last\n\n654\n00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,990\nblack cat conference in\nAsia that deal with this.\n\n655\n00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,970\nThis is some of the issues\nthat we're gonna be continuing\n\n656\n00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,160\nto emerge around these technologies.\n\n657\n00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,800\nBut just because we virtualize something\n\n658\n00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,100\ndoesn't mean it behaves any differently\nthan it does in the real world.\n\n659\n00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,880\nAnd I tell my virtualization\nstudents this all the time.\n\n660\n00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,340\nIt's identical, right?\n\n661\n00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,910\nThe only difference is,\nyou can't reach out and\n\n662\n00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,275\ntouch it physically, but\nyou can touch it logically.\n\n663\n00:33:57,275 --> 00:34:00,425\nAnd as a result of that, we still\nhave all these liabilities, right?\n\n664\n00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:03,635\nWe still write antivirus software\nin virtual infrastructure\n\n665\n00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:06,535\nbecause we can infect it just\nlike we do in the real world.\n\n666\n00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:11,135\nAnd so be aware of the fact that\nthis remote FX USB redirection\n\n667\n00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:14,065\nattack is something you're\ngoing to potentially face.\n\n668\n00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:16,565\nAnd deal with as an SSCP at some point.\n\n669\n00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:21,250\nYou may not but my point is, this is yet\njust another way that malware,\n\n670\n00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:25,080\nor something like malware,\nsome sort of malicious intent.\n\n671\n00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,560\nCan make it's way into your system.\n\n672\n00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,830\nSo just something interesting off the\nwires, so to speak, in terms of headlines.\n\n673\n00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,790\nThat are making their way out\ninto the chat rooms today, and\n\n674\n00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,960\naround the security community.\n\n675\n00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,535\nAlright, so let's talk about logic bombs.\n\n676\n00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:39,870\n[COUGH] Logic bombs, do we have our notes?\n\n677\n00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,100\nDo you wanna throw those back up?\n\n678\n00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,950\nThere we go.\n\n679\n00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,070\nMagic!\nI just point and\n\n680\n00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,410\nwhoop there they go, right?\n\n681\n00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,060\n>> Wireless.\n\n682\n00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,100\n>> Wireless, it's awesome.\n\n683\n00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,730\nSo logic bombs are gonna be\ntypically planted by an insider.\n\n684\n00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:55,160\nYou know, somebody who has access to the\nsystem can then implement a logic bomb.\n\n685\n00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,500\nThis is gonna be malicious\ncode of some kind.\n\n686\n00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,790\nThat is set based on a date or\na condition,\n\n687\n00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,600\ntypically in order to be able to go off or\ndo its damage.\n\n688\n00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,830\nAnd there are some very\nfamous ones out there.\n\n689\n00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,780\nThe Michelangelo logic bomb that\ngoes off on his birthday every year.\n\n690\n00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,660\nThere's a bunch of others read\nabout that urban myth and\n\n691\n00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,620\nlegend that have gone off or\nbeen set up to go off.\n\n692\n00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,210\nThere’s a story of the network\nadministrator that gets fired and leaves\n\n693\n00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,240\nbehind a little present for his boss that\ngoes off on his birthday or something.\n\n694\n00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,310\nThose kind of things happen or\nyou hear about them potentially happening.\n\n695\n00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,890\nBut the idea behind a logic bomb is\nbasically just a piece of malware.\n\n696\n00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,900\nThat is going to\neffectively have a timer or\n\n697\n00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,850\nsome sort of conditional\nsolution associated with it.\n\n698\n00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,760\nAnd when we trigger that event or\n\n699\n00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,850\nthat condition,\nwe then trigger the logic block.\n\n700\n00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,190\nNow, as things go, they may or\nmay not be as disruptive and\n\n701\n00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,720\ndestructive as some of these\nother things we've talked about.\n\n702\n00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,540\nA lot of the times they just,\nyou know, throw mad,\n\n703\n00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,760\nsmiley faces up on the screen or\ndo something crazy.\n\n704\n00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,700\nThey may take a certain amount of space\non the hard drive and reformat it.\n\n705\n00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,350\nThey may wipe out certain files.\n\n706\n00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,430\nThis certainly can do damage.\n\n707\n00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:04,270\nBut they typically are not gonna be as\ninsidious as some of the other things\n\n708\n00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:09,560\nwe've talked about like viruses for\ninstance, back door trojans, root kits.\n\n709\n00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,500\nWhich really can screw with your\nsystem in such a way that it\n\n710\n00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,840\nreally ruins your day, right?\n\n711\n00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,280\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n712\n00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,470\nYou know, getting rid of a root kit can\ntypically be a lot more difficult than\n\n713\n00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,170\ngetting rid of a logic bomb.\n\n714\n00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,920\nSo just think about that.\n\n715\n00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,710\nSpyware and\n\n716\n00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,760\nadware delivered to a system as you can\nsee here from on our list, via download.\n\n717\n00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,550\nSo again, typically somebody is invited\nto go to a website, follows a link.\n\n718\n00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,080\nHey if you just go here and\ncheck out this new video.\n\n719\n00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,020\nIt's really cool.\n\n720\n00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,550\nEverybody should see it.\n\n721\n00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,400\nDownload this new MP3 or whatever it is.\n\n722\n00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,980\nHere's the latest e-book.\n\n723\n00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,900\nYou know, it's funny because I\nhave a lot of, you may do this.\n\n724\n00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,370\nI don't know if you use e-readers.\n\n725\n00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,480\nWe haven't really talked about this.\n\n726\n00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,920\nBut I'm a old school kind of guy.\n\n727\n00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,090\nI keep referring to myself that way.\n\n728\n00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,820\nI use technologies you can see, right,\n\n729\n00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,550\nat least I make a good show of\nusing technology, really, right?\n\n730\n00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,620\nBut, you know, I try to use technology for\na lot of stuff, but\n\n731\n00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,840\nthere's certain things I just\ndon't find a lot of value in.\n\n732\n00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,340\nWhen I read a book, I want to read a book.\n\n733\n00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,200\nI don't want to read an electric device\nthat represents itself as a book.\n\n734\n00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,830\nSo, for me, things like ereaders\njust don't really work in my world.\n\n735\n00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,600\nI am the kind of person when I'm\ndoing presentations and whatever.\n\n736\n00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,370\nI want to be able to\nwrite down my notes and\n\n737\n00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,830\nactually write them down on\nthe margin of something, on a paper.\n\n738\n00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,870\nSo yes, I'm the non-environmental\nperson who goes around killing\n\n739\n00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,575\ntrees cause I print stuff out.\n\n740\n00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:28,085\nBut I recycle on the other side.\n\n741\n00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:31,545\nSo it's kind of good because I recycle\nall the stuff I print out when I'm done.\n\n742\n00:37:31,545 --> 00:37:36,325\nBut, if you walk into an office, I'm\nthe guy who has the whole wall with all\n\n743\n00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:39,365\nthe bookshelves with the old\nbooks sitting on them.\n\n744\n00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:42,225\nAnd, as a result of that,\nI don't use a lot of these devices.\n\n745\n00:37:42,225 --> 00:37:44,335\nKindles and\nthings like that are just not my thing.\n\n746\n00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:47,540\nAnd so when you look at\nsome of this technology and\n\n747\n00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,190\nyou look at some of\nthe things that can go on.\n\n748\n00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,510\nAnd some of the ways in which we find\nspyware and adware being disseminated.\n\n749\n00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,170\nWe often see it around these kinds of\nthings where people are being invited to\n\n750\n00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,600\ndownload free stuff and as a result\nof that they're getting infected.\n\n751\n00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,420\nAnd this is really what tends to happen.\n\n752\n00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,320\nSo adware tends to be where we just\npop up a lot of ads on the screen.\n\n753\n00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,285\nHow much Viagra do you really need, right?\n\n754\n00:38:09,285 --> 00:38:11,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> How many weight loss solutions can you\n\n755\n00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,100\npossibly partake in?\n\n756\n00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,830\nThat's adware, that kind of thing.\n\n757\n00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,810\nSpyware is gonna be stuff that again,\ngiven the name, snoops on you, right?\n\n758\n00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:23,020\nSo something that's installed that may\nbe a surreptitious keystroke logger.\n\n759\n00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,710\nKeystroke loggers can be hardware based\nbut they can also be software base.\n\n760\n00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,750\nSo they're a good example of Spyware,\n\n761\n00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,650\nsomething that may be recording\nyour instant chat messages.\n\n762\n00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,990\nSo any of your IRC chatting that goes on\nif you're using that kind of a client,\n\n763\n00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,080\nthere could be Spyware associated\nwith downloading one of those.\n\n764\n00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,040\nInstalling it while you're chatting and\nthinking nobody else but you and\n\n765\n00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,450\nthe person on the other end is aware of.\n\n766\n00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,980\nThat bot or\nthat spyware item is taking down and\n\n767\n00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,090\nliterally getting a transcript\nof all that information.\n\n768\n00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:57,670\nAnd as a result, we may then be sending\nit to somebody, whoever that may be.\n\n769\n00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,310\nSo think about this kind of stuff,\n\n770\n00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,640\nusually delivered through some form of\nsocial engineering as we've talked about.\n\n771\n00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,150\nAnd again, if somebody invites you\nto do something like anything else,\n\n772\n00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,330\nuse common sense.\n\n773\n00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,600\nIf you know somebody, maybe you can\ntrust what they're telling you.\n\n774\n00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,380\nBecause obviously if they have\nbeen smart enough to vet it,\n\n775\n00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,070\nit may be a good recommendation.\n\n776\n00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:20,490\nBut I would still be skeptical, even\nif somebody that I trust tells me, hey,\n\n777\n00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:24,330\nit's a really cool site, or it's a really\ngood piece of software, whatever.\n\n778\n00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,080\nI wanna do my own due diligence.\n\n779\n00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,240\nI wanna know about it\nbefore I go download it.\n\n780\n00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,710\nBut if I get a random totally\nunsolicited email in the mail\n\n781\n00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,220\nabout being the long lost relative\nof some African chieftain.\n\n782\n00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,600\nWho has millions of dollars that\nthey need to get into the country.\n\n783\n00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,940\nIf I just give them some information.\n\n784\n00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,370\nI keep a running folder in my\nemail system of all of these\n\n785\n00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,240\nsocial engineered emails I get.\n\n786\n00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,257\nThese phishing emails.\n\n787\n00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:54,172\nBecause I use them in class sometimes, so\nI'll just pull out the most random and\n\n788\n00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:55,701\nup-to-date one that I have.\n\n789\n00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:57,731\nAnd I get them from all over the world.\n\n790\n00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,355\nIt's almost like being a stamp collector.\n\n791\n00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,982\nI feel like a philologist because I\nhave all these different things, and\n\n792\n00:40:02,982 --> 00:40:06,010\nI've been going back probably 10 or\n15 years.\n\n793\n00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,600\nI just keep a running\nfolder on this stuff.\n\n794\n00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,980\nSo I can constantly pull these up and\ntalk about them, and\n\n795\n00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,920\nsee the emerging trends that are going\non in that particular space.\n\n796\n00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,760\nBut this all has to deal with\nthe ideas of spyware and adware.\n\n797\n00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,250\nAnd just socially engineering\ninformation out of somebody is really\n\n798\n00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,810\npart of that conversation.\n\n799\n00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,600\nSo just be thinking about that, right?\n\n800\n00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,720\nI think we're up to bots on our list.\n\n801\n00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,540\nSo let's talk a bit about bots.\n\n802\n00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,830\nSo a bot, generically,\nis a machine that has been infected,\n\n803\n00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,050\nsomehow taken over as being remote\ncontrolled from somewhere else.\n\n804\n00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,900\nAnd so this idea of malware\nbeing introduced to them,\n\n805\n00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,360\nremotely manage this system, and either\nmake it a bot, or what we call a zombie,\n\n806\n00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,100\nthere's different terms you often hear out\nthere, is gonna be what we talk about.\n\n807\n00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,090\nBotnets are simply this network that is\na collection of bots that are being run by\n\n808\n00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:57,020\na bot herder, the person or entity that\nis managing these remote systems and\n\n809\n00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,830\nthen using them and\ntypically selling them.\n\n810\n00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,080\nThere's a black market for\n\n811\n00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,620\nthese systems today where you\ncan go on to certain places.\n\n812\n00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,490\nSilk Road, for\n\n813\n00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:08,870\ninstance, is one of those websites where\nthey've dealt with a lot of things, right?\n\n814\n00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,010\nSo, drugs, arms, etc.\n\n815\n00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,290\nAll the good stuff that wholesome\nindividuals need to be able to buy\n\n816\n00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,340\nthrough E-commerce on the Web.\n\n817\n00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,560\nIn addition to all that, one of the\nunspoken things that was going on there\n\n818\n00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,000\nthat you could also deal with was getting\naccess to the underground hacking network.\n\n819\n00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,610\nWhere you could get into things\nlike buying bots and botnets for\n\n820\n00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,230\ndistributed denial of service attacks that\ncould then be launched against systems.\n\n821\n00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,950\nThis is a huge, huge issue today in the\nunderground, because what's happening is\n\n822\n00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:40,850\nyou basically have a grey market that is\nmaking its living selling its services,\n\n823\n00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,600\nmuch like the arms market is.\n\n824\n00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,090\nBut we're not selling guns, we're selling\n\n825\n00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,220\naccess to infected systems that can then\nbe brought to bear to take down networks.\n\n826\n00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,870\nAnd for several hundred dollars you can\ngo out and buy a botnet and rent it.\n\n827\n00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,430\nIt's a software as a service model.\n\n828\n00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,860\nOr an infrastructure is a service and\na platform is a service,\n\n829\n00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,970\nall rolled into one.\n\n830\n00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,060\nBecause you can actually rent and\nor buy one or\n\n831\n00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,150\nall three of these mechanisms\nover the cloud today.\n\n832\n00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,140\nAnd so you're able to effectively go out,\n\n833\n00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,490\nput an order in, transfer either some\ndigital currency or some actual money.\n\n834\n00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,430\nAnd for several hundred or\n\n835\n00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:16,080\nseveral thousand dollars, you now have\nan army waiting to do your bidding.\n\n836\n00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,900\nIt's kinda like The Clone Wars, right?\n\n837\n00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,840\nGo out and order up an army and\nthere you are,\n\n838\n00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,030\nyou got your whole saga\nright in the can there.\n\n839\n00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,930\nBut this is becoming\na really big issue today.\n\n840\n00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,870\nAnd this is something that security\nprofessionals are aware of.\n\n841\n00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:33,380\nYou may not have a lot of ability to\ninterdict until the bots are actually\n\n842\n00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,820\nat your front door.\n\n843\n00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,210\nBut we go back to this idea\nof defense in depth, and\n\n844\n00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,310\nreally understanding how to\ndeal with something like this.\n\n845\n00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,400\nIt's this idea of understanding what\ndefense mechanisms you put in play,\n\n846\n00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,000\nand what is sitting in your DMZ.\n\n847\n00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,440\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n848\n00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,520\nThink about that.\n\n849\n00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,290\nThey're used for spam, for denial of\nservice, distributed denial of service.\n\n850\n00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:56,460\nAs we talked about, a lot of these bots\nare being used to spread email, so\n\n851\n00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,210\nbeing able to spread, or\nrather used for spam networks.\n\n852\n00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,950\nWe get voice spam today.\n\n853\n00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:06,040\nWe also get fax-based spam today.\n\n854\n00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,940\nSo there's all sorts.\n\n855\n00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,870\nInstant messaging spam, which is called\nSPIM, so spam on instant messaging.\n\n856\n00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,310\nAs if spam itself wasn't bad enough.\n\n857\n00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,900\nSo, we have all these different ways that\nwe can see this garbage just emanating and\n\n858\n00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,830\nflowing out of one or\nmore areas into our network.\n\n859\n00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,750\nSo you really wanna be aware of this,\nand just have a sense of this and\n\n860\n00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,118\nunderstand what it is.\n\n861\n00:43:26,118 --> 00:43:28,840\nAnd we called them zombies,\nby the way, long before the rage\n\n862\n00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,450\nthat has taken over reality TV and\nall that stuff, talking about zombies.\n\n863\n00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,000\nSo social engineering, right?\n\n864\n00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,650\nI've mentioned it several times here.\n\n865\n00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:41,720\nThis idea of going down the line and\nreally getting people to buy in\n\n866\n00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,550\nto sharing information that normally\nwould not be made available to you.\n\n867\n00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:49,150\nThere was an interesting study that\nwas done a few years ago in England.\n\n868\n00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,670\nAnd they randomly went out on the street\nand started talking to people,\n\n869\n00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,910\nthe surveyors did.\n\n870\n00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,950\nAnd what they asked people was a series\nof questions about what they did.\n\n871\n00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,330\nYou didn't really know who they were\nstopping, they just kinda went through and\n\n872\n00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:04,010\nsaid hey, walking down the street,\ndo you mind taking a few questions and\n\n873\n00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,200\nanswering them for us?\n\n874\n00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,600\nAnd somebody would typically say,\nabsolutely.\n\n875\n00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,780\nAnd they would say,\nokay great, what do you do?\n\n876\n00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,550\nWhere do you work?\n\n877\n00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,240\nGreat, I work here, I do this.\n\n878\n00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,160\nWhat does your job role entail?\n\n879\n00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,941\nAnd they would walk down and eventually\nthey would get to the point where they'd\n\n880\n00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:19,150\nsay so, do you have a username and\na password?\n\n881\n00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,590\nDo you use that to log into your system?\n\n882\n00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,220\nYes.\n\n883\n00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,990\nWould you be willing to\ntell us what it was?\n\n884\n00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,330\nOh no, no, no, I can't do that.\n\n885\n00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,480\nWould you tell us for.\n\n886\n00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,360\nAnd they would go down the list and ask\npeople what you would basically give up\n\n887\n00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,942\nyour username and\nyour password for, right?\n\n888\n00:44:29,942 --> 00:44:35,910\nAnd so, number one thing\nmost people would have said,\n\n889\n00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,460\nif you bribe me with this in effect,\nI would give it to you.\n\n890\n00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,458\nYou know what it was?\n\n891\n00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:40,418\n>> Starbucks?\n\n892\n00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:42,150\n[LAUGH]\n>> It wasn't Starbucks,\n\n893\n00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,230\nit wasn't money either.\n\n894\n00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,670\nIf it was me,\nit would have been Starbucks.\n\n895\n00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,030\nYou can have me for\ntwo cups of espresso, right?\n\n896\n00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:49,430\nBut wasn't money, wasn't coffee.\n\n897\n00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,810\nSnickers candy bar.\n\n898\n00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,510\n>> Really?\n>> Snickers candy bar.\n\n899\n00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:56,380\nNumber one thing, number one thing\nthat most people said they'd give up,\n\n900\n00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:01,025\nthey'd sell out, give up their\ninformation for a Snickers candy bar.\n\n901\n00:45:01,025 --> 00:45:03,120\nNow, we joke about this kind of stuff.\n\n902\n00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,340\nThat was a serious survey, by the way.\n\n903\n00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,450\nI'm not joking about that.\n\n904\n00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,680\nBut we joke about this kinda stuff and\nmake light about it,\n\n905\n00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,020\nbut think about the implications of that,\nright?\n\n906\n00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:14,933\nSomebody working in a business, could be a\nlow-level information worker, doesn't have\n\n907\n00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:19,289\naccess to a lot, may just be an office\nworker, may really know no secrets at all.\n\n908\n00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:25,510\nBut imagine if they give up their\naccess to the network to somebody.\n\n909\n00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,150\nWhat could we parlay that into?\n\n910\n00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,430\nWhat can we use from that logon to then\ntake and get to other information?\n\n911\n00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,510\nSomebody like me that does this for\na living,\n\n912\n00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:40,210\nthe last person you want in your network\nis somebody like me snooping around.\n\n913\n00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,320\nNot because I'm looking to do you harm,\nI'm not the evil me.\n\n914\n00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,230\nThat would break in the black hat me.\n\n915\n00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,760\nWe need to get some hats, so we put on the\nblack hat, the white hat, the gray hat.\n\n916\n00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,160\nSo if I put on my black hat,\nI'm not that person.\n\n917\n00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,450\nBut what if I was, right?\n\n918\n00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,500\nWhat if that person gave me\nthe access to that network?\n\n919\n00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,710\nWhat would happen?\n\n920\n00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:04,540\nIn five or ten minutes, I could walk out\nliterally with intellectual property that\n\n921\n00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,780\nmay be the next big thing your\ncompany was gonna go to market on.\n\n922\n00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,440\nI'm giving that to your competitor.\n\n923\n00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,960\nAll of a sudden you're done.\n\n924\n00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,480\nI may be walking out with financials, and\n\n925\n00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,354\nI may be looking to blackmail your\ncompany, for instance, hypothetically.\n\n926\n00:46:15,354 --> 00:46:20,256\nI may be planting software inside your\nnetwork on that machine that will\n\n927\n00:46:20,256 --> 00:46:23,279\nremotely monitor what goes on, looking for\n\n928\n00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:27,120\ninformation that I can use for\na variety of things.\n\n929\n00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,810\nI may not be targeting your network,\nby the way, in your company, but\n\n930\n00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,150\nyou may be doing business with somebody\nwho I ultimately want to get into.\n\n931\n00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,860\nAnd I may be using your\ncompany as a launching pad to\n\n932\n00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,200\nfigure out how to get to them,\n\n933\n00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,440\nbecause you have a vendor relationship\nthat gives you federated access.\n\n934\n00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,040\nGives you trust between you and\nthat company.\n\n935\n00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,110\nAnd as a result, I wanna get in and\nsee what you see.\n\n936\n00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,260\nYou imagine the implications\nof something like this?\n\n937\n00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,070\nAll over a candy bar, right?\n\n938\n00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,460\nNot anything big.\n\n939\n00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,550\nDoesn't seem like a lot.\n\n940\n00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,890\nMost people would say, yeah,\nyou know, not a big deal.\n\n941\n00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,710\nI don't really see the value in not\ntelling you, because we don't have\n\n942\n00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,204\nthe security awareness mentality\nthat we keep talking about,\n\n943\n00:47:00,204 --> 00:47:01,584\nthat everybody has to be trained.\n\n944\n00:47:01,584 --> 00:47:05,289\nNo matter what, we don't give that\nstuff up, because it's so quick.\n\n945\n00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,710\nOnce we infect a system, we're done.\n\n946\n00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:08,790\nIt's that quick.\n\n947\n00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,205\nAnd it usually takes us hours\nto disinfect the system,\n\n948\n00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:15,332\nit only takes us seconds or\nminutes to infect one.\n\n949\n00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,212\nReally doesn't take very long at all.\n\n950\n00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,450\nSo just be aware of that as\nwe keep thinking about this.\n\n951\n00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,290\nSo we were talking about social\nengineering types, right?\n\n952\n00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,160\nSo things like phishing, which is setting\nup the emails we talked about for\n\n953\n00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,940\ninstance, and\ngoing after low-level people.\n\n954\n00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,280\nSpear phishing,\ntypically phishing is done by email.\n\n955\n00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,060\nIt could be done via voice, by the way.\n\n956\n00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,018\nThere is voice phishing\nthat goes on there.\n\n957\n00:47:39,018 --> 00:47:43,460\nWe have it noted down below as vishing,\nvoice over IP-based phishing.\n\n958\n00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,280\nBut this idea is just\ntargeting lower-level email,\n\n959\n00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,340\nlower level people typically by email.\n\n960\n00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,442\nSpear phishing is gonna be going\nafter a specific targeted group.\n\n961\n00:47:53,442 --> 00:47:58,385\nSo in other words, you may be going after\njust people in HR or something like that,\n\n962\n00:47:58,385 --> 00:48:02,542\nand that will be typically what we're\ndoing there Whaling is gonna be\n\n963\n00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:07,271\ngoing after high level, more senior C\nlevel, typically executive types, so\n\n964\n00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:12,390\nwe're gonna target a fairly big fish,\nin effect, is the analogy there.\n\n965\n00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,380\nSo we may be targeting\nthe head of a company,\n\n966\n00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,570\na major manager in a line of business,\nsomething like that [COUGH].\n\n967\n00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:25,320\nWhen we're talking about going after\nthose kind of people, obviously,\n\n968\n00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,850\nwe potentially get a lot\nof very useful information.\n\n969\n00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:31,310\nBlackmail is typically the endgame there,\nor access.\n\n970\n00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:35,060\nA lot of time we see this in banking or\nfinancial sectors where they're targeting\n\n971\n00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:39,540\nthose people to get access to basically\ncodes and money and transactions and\n\n972\n00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,560\nthings like that,\ntypically through blackmail.\n\n973\n00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,780\nAgain, you know, a lot of people\ndo a lot of strange crazy things.\n\n974\n00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,890\nThey often don't want people\nto know about them, yet\n\n975\n00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,250\nwe tend to find out about them and\nas a result, we tend to use them.\n\n976\n00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,220\nSo just be aware that, think about that,\nthat's kinda what we're thinking about and\n\n977\n00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,470\ntalking about there.\n\n978\n00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,200\nSo the idea,\nI think I mentioned Vishing already.\n\n979\n00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,430\nVishing is this idea of going after\nvoice over IP based Phishing.\n\n980\n00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,400\nSo basically,\ntrying to do social engineering but\n\n981\n00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,640\nover the phone, either through a cell\nphone or just over the phone in general.\n\n982\n00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,020\nCalling up for instance,\nhey I'm from the service desk, right?\n\n983\n00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,750\nAnd I wanna help you I understand\nyou're having a problem.\n\n984\n00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:17,510\nWe need to reset your password, help me\nout by giving me the current password.\n\n985\n00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:18,810\nTell me what's going on there.\n\n986\n00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:21,200\nThat's the kind of thing that\nmight happen with Vishing.\n\n987\n00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,330\nPharming, which we didn't get to\nLet's just quickly define that.\n\n988\n00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:30,320\nIt's typically the exploitation of\nthe weaknesses we may find for instance,\n\n989\n00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:34,360\nin something like a DNS server or\na DHCP solution.\n\n990\n00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,777\nWhere basically we're gonna\ngo after network services.\n\n991\n00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:38,460\nIs probably a good way\nof thinking about it.\n\n992\n00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,100\nSo it's really targeted around DNS where\nwe're going to go after exploits that we\n\n993\n00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,220\nfind out there and\nwe're going to then go after them\n\n994\n00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,580\nin such a way that we can use them to\nour advantage to get into a system.\n\n995\n00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,870\nSo we may bring in, for instance,\na wireless access point.\n\n996\n00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:54,420\nWhat we call a rouge access\npoint if we set it up.\n\n997\n00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:59,680\nWe may turn that on, turn on a DHCP\nsolution, start handing out network IDs\n\n998\n00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,130\nto, you know, people that are connecting\nand then try to grab their machines and\n\n999\n00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,850\ninstall remote access solutions\non them when they connect.\n\n1000\n00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,860\nAnd they may not be able to get\nanywhere and they disconnect.\n\n1001\n00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,900\nThey go, oh that was bad access point, we\ndidn't really mean to connect to that one,\n\n1002\n00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,830\ndoesn't go anywhere.\n\n1003\n00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:15,290\nWe've already infected the system\nwhen they've logged in.\n\n1004\n00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,090\nSo as a result we're connected to it.\n\n1005\n00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:20,010\nSo as a result of that, things like that\nfall under that category typically of\n\n1006\n00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:24,000\nforming and so these are just all examples\nof what social engineering may be.\n\n1007\n00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,580\nWe talked a little bit about key loggers\na minute ago and mentioned them and\n\n1008\n00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,500\nI mentioned they could be hardware or\nsoftware based.\n\n1009\n00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,980\nI just want to remind you about\nthe fact that things like key loggers,\n\n1010\n00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,580\nwhich are gonna grab everything we do.\n\n1011\n00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:40,440\nKey stroke loggers, often called that as\nwell are gonna be another form of malware.\n\n1012\n00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,410\nAnd again hardware based,\n\n1013\n00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,780\nreally hard to get those in there\nunless we have physical access.\n\n1014\n00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,890\nBecause we put them in-between\nthe keyboard and the device and\n\n1015\n00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,560\nobviously on something like a laptop.\n\n1016\n00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,480\nYou can't really use a physical\nkey stroke logger in the same\n\n1017\n00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,360\nway you would a desktop that may be\nburied in the back of the machine and\n\n1018\n00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,590\nmaybe nobody looks back there all right?\n\n1019\n00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,530\nAnd we talked of situational\nawareness a lot.\n\n1020\n00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,740\nI mentioned it a lot\nwhen I talked to people.\n\n1021\n00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,070\nAlways know you're surroundings and\nwhat's going on..\n\n1022\n00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,690\nYou know, I'm not suggesting you\ncrawl under the desk every day and\n\n1023\n00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,820\nlook at the cabling, but\nI am suggesting that every once in a while\n\n1024\n00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,070\nyou take inventory and\nsee what's going on back there.\n\n1025\n00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,240\nYou never know what's been put in there,\nand you want to just be aware of that.\n\n1026\n00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,720\nIs there a USB device that's been plugged\ninto your system that you're not aware of?\n\n1027\n00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,110\nAnd that's something to think about.\n\n1028\n00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,120\nAnd on laptops and\n\n1029\n00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,900\ntablets, we can still use keystroke\nloggers we just use them as USB devices.\n\n1030\n00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,720\nAnd so, you know, if you come along and\nfind something in the USB\n\n1031\n00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,010\nslot that doesn't belong there,\nyou may have an issue.\n\n1032\n00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,570\nAnd what typically keystroke loggers do\nis they generate text files, right and\n\n1033\n00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,550\nthey bury these text files\nsomewhere in the root of the OS.\n\n1034\n00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,350\nCan you bring up Windows Explorer\ninterface for just a minute,\n\n1035\n00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:46,500\na file explorer for us.\n\n1036\n00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,640\nNot the chat room explorer,\nthe file explorer.\n\n1037\n00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,300\nWrong explorer.\n\n1038\n00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:49,920\n>> Wrong explorer.\n\n1039\n00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,060\nThere we go.\n\n1040\n00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:55,310\n>> Let's just go into the windows\ndirectory, if we could.\n\n1041\n00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:59,060\nAnd let's just go down to Windows and\njust scroll down a little bit and\n\n1042\n00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,510\nlet's look at some of the, system 32.\n\n1043\n00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:05,140\nLet's look at some of the text files that\nare sitting in there If you go down,\n\n1044\n00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,290\nright, and we just start looking at files.\n\n1045\n00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,730\nAnd you're gonna see there's\nall sorts of files in there.\n\n1046\n00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:14,720\nBut if we do a find on files by type,\nyou're gonna find if you just do like\n\n1047\n00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,850\nan asterisk dot .txt, right, we're gonna\nfind all sorts of files sitting in there.\n\n1048\n00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,380\nAnd so we've got a bunch right there.\n\n1049\n00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,630\nAnd if you imagine on average,\nin a generic Windows system,\n\n1050\n00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,080\nwe probably have several hundred,\nmaybe close to 1,000 text files.\n\n1051\n00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,890\nObviously not all showing up on\nthe screen right now because we did it on\n\n1052\n00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:33,870\nthe sub-directory.\n\n1053\n00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,480\nBut if you just did it on\nthe root of the C drive and\n\n1054\n00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,420\njust looked at everything on C,\n\n1055\n00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,940\nyou would see several hundred text files\nthat are sitting in a traditional system.\n\n1056\n00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,530\nAnd as a result of that, if we hide one or\ntwo of them among the mix there somewhere,\n\n1057\n00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,900\nchances are good,\nyou're never gonna know they're there.\n\n1058\n00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,020\nThey're not very big, and\n\n1059\n00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,210\nwhat we're doing is capturing\neverything you do on that box.\n\n1060\n00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:55,660\nSo when you type your supposedly encrypted\nand hidden password into the website,\n\n1061\n00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:59,490\nwe're capturing the actual keystroke\nin unencrypted form using a key logger.\n\n1062\n00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:00,730\nSo we know what it is.\n\n1063\n00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,270\nWe know the URL you went to.\n\n1064\n00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,840\nWe know the username you used.\n\n1065\n00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,550\nWe know where you clicked\non the screen and\n\n1066\n00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,530\nwhat you did because we're\nalso taking screen captures.\n\n1067\n00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:12,510\nWe're taking pictures and screen scraping\nall this stuff, put into files and\n\n1068\n00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,290\nthen burst it out over your session\ntraffic when you connect to the web so\n\n1069\n00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,960\nthat you don't see it happening.\n\n1070\n00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,740\nAnd so this kind of stuff can be very,\nvery insidious and\n\n1071\n00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,090\nvery difficult to track.\n\n1072\n00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:24,970\nBut can be very,\nvery problematic for a system.\n\n1073\n00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,960\nSo, I just want to call that out and\nremind you of these kind of things and\n\n1074\n00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,230\nmake sure you're aware of them as well.\n\n1075\n00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:33,810\nAll right, I think we had some virus\ntypes that we listed there as well,\n\n1076\n00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,760\nwanted to quickly just maybe go through\nsome of them, throw them out there for\n\n1077\n00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,220\nus and just make sure we know what\nthey are so we have boot viruses.\n\n1078\n00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,650\nSome of these are historical by the way.\n\n1079\n00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,400\nYou don't really see boot\nviruses around much anymore.\n\n1080\n00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,220\nThe modern OSs,\nespecially Windows based OSs,\n\n1081\n00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,772\nhave really gotten around the implications\nof the boot virus because they have safe\n\n1082\n00:53:51,772 --> 00:53:55,860\nkernels of that are loaded now and really\ncompiled and protected in such a way that\n\n1083\n00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,240\nboot viruses are not necessarily\ngoing to infect a lot of systems.\n\n1084\n00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,850\nWe have basic virus scanning\nsolutions running in the BIOS.\n\n1085\n00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:06,910\nSo we have AV scanners in effect that\nare built right into the BIOS these days.\n\n1086\n00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,330\nNot the same ones that you use\non the Windows desktop, but\n\n1087\n00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,300\nvery simple logic ones that are gonna look\nfor this kind of activity and block it.\n\n1088\n00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,330\nSo as a result we dont tend to see\nthese as being very difficult for\n\n1089\n00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,540\nus to deal with anymore.\n\n1090\n00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:21,150\nBut they were spread typically on disks\nfor instance if you boot it to a floppy\n\n1091\n00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,850\ndisk by accident,\nthe boot sector virus would be there.\n\n1092\n00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:28,480\nIt would load, if you leave USB devices\nplugged in and modify your boot order\n\n1093\n00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,200\nyou could still get hit with a boot virus\nbecause it could come in off the media.\n\n1094\n00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,440\nYou know but typically not really a big\ndeal anymore more of a historical note.\n\n1095\n00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,920\nYou know,\ntypically in the late 80s to maybe,\n\n1096\n00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,760\nmid 2000s is when we would have\nseen boot viruses happening.\n\n1097\n00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,570\nThis was all the rage back in the mid to\nlate 80s, especially this big deal as we\n\n1098\n00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:49,810\nreally started seeing computing spreading\nto businesses and to the home especially.\n\n1099\n00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:53,220\nThe advent of the Mac, right, and\nthat kind of stuff happened back then.\n\n1100\n00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,815\nThe good days, right?\n\n1101\n00:54:53,815 --> 00:54:56,120\n[LAUGH] The good days, all right.\n\n1102\n00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,320\nSo, File viruses,\n\n1103\n00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,150\nthese would've been programmatic\nfiles that would've been infected.\n\n1104\n00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:01,980\nWe still see these,\n\n1105\n00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,730\nby the way, we don't necessarily see them\nin the guise of a file virus, per se.\n\n1106\n00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,640\nBut if somebody gives you a program\nthat has infected files in it,\n\n1107\n00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,025\nyou could theoretically say that\nwas a file File virus of some kind.\n\n1108\n00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:17,035\nYou download a word document or something\nthat has a file associated with it that\n\n1109\n00:55:17,035 --> 00:55:21,505\nmay be an alternate data stream, a hidden\ndata stream of some kind that has viruses.\n\n1110\n00:55:21,505 --> 00:55:25,100\nWe're not really going to get into ADS and\ntalk about how to build them and use them.\n\n1111\n00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,220\nWe do that in hacking classes typically we\ntalk about that when we deal with hacking,\n\n1112\n00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,200\nbut it may be just a knowledge point for\nyou to go out and\n\n1113\n00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,900\nlook up on your own if you're interested.\n\n1114\n00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,220\nSomething like alternate data streams.\n\n1115\n00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,580\nADS's allow you to create space inside\na hard drive in the wide space, and\n\n1116\n00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:43,140\nassociate files with it and\nonly see them on the fly\n\n1117\n00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,210\nwhen you are calling them with the full\npath, as opposed to a normal path.\n\n1118\n00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,607\nSo we could attach hidden data to\nsomething like a Word document or\n\n1119\n00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:53,126\na text file that would be there\nwhile it's stored in the system, but\n\n1120\n00:55:53,126 --> 00:55:54,883\nyou wouldn't know it was there.\n\n1121\n00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:56,716\nAnd it could be activated on demand.\n\n1122\n00:55:56,716 --> 00:55:59,672\nSo these are these kinda things,\nwhen we think about they're,\n\n1123\n00:55:59,672 --> 00:56:01,544\nthese are program files again, right?\n\n1124\n00:56:01,544 --> 00:56:02,948\nTypically very popular.\n\n1125\n00:56:02,948 --> 00:56:05,350\nAgain, late 80s, early 2000s.\n\n1126\n00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:07,240\nDon't really see them much anymore.\n\n1127\n00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,520\nNot really a big prevalent\nthing in today's world.\n\n1128\n00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,150\nMacro viruses, these are still around.\n\n1129\n00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:17,550\nYou know the Word macro viruses\nthat were popular back in\n\n1130\n00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:20,180\nprobably the 90s are a good\nexample of this.\n\n1131\n00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,290\nWe still see macro viruses\nbeing used on occasion.\n\n1132\n00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:25,850\nAnd so these are viruses that\nare gonna basically come in and\n\n1133\n00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,640\nexecute as you execute automated routines.\n\n1134\n00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,960\nAnd so one of the interesting things about\nmacro viruses, we don't really refer to\n\n1135\n00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,900\nthem much in the world today because\nthey are rare, but they still exist.\n\n1136\n00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,430\nBut with the advent of\nthings like PowerShell, and\n\n1137\n00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:42,210\nautomation scripting really becoming\nall the rage, in the Windows world,\n\n1138\n00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:44,148\nit's been the rage for many, many years.\n\n1139\n00:56:44,148 --> 00:56:45,790\nIn the non-Windows world, Linux and\n\n1140\n00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,180\nUnix, you do almost everything you need\nto do through a command shell, and\n\n1141\n00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,920\nusually use cron jobs and batch jobs, and\nscripts and things like that, to automate.\n\n1142\n00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,260\nBut here in the Windows world, we haven't\nreally seen an advent of an automation\n\n1143\n00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,640\nsolution until very recently in the last\nmaybe couple of years especially.\n\n1144\n00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,680\nAnd now it's becoming\npretty much standard.\n\n1145\n00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,980\nIf you want to administer,\nyou gotta know about it.\n\n1146\n00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,000\nSo using that kind of a solution,\n\n1147\n00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,850\nwhat are the implications of those kind\nof environments and macro viruses?\n\n1148\n00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,640\nNot macro per se, but automation viruses.\n\n1149\n00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,150\nI'll broaden that category and\nhave you think about that.\n\n1150\n00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,470\nThat's something to think about.\n\n1151\n00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,790\nStill prevalent today.\n\n1152\n00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:21,890\nWorms, obviously.\n\n1153\n00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:25,890\nWe've talked about worms, very prevalent,\nbeen around since the mid to late 90s, and\n\n1154\n00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,810\nstill seeing the advent of that.\n\n1155\n00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,570\nThings like the Slammer worm\na few years ago with SQL.\n\n1156\n00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:31,780\nCode red, right?\n\n1157\n00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,140\nAll sorts of stuff.\n\n1158\n00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:33,770\nNimda.\n\n1159\n00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:38,690\nThese are all examples of viruses and/or\nworms or any combination of the two.\n\n1160\n00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:42,310\nI know we have Nimda listed down\nthere as a multipartite virus cuz it\n\n1161\n00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,400\ninfects as a worm and acts like a virus.\n\n1162\n00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,260\nAnd so\nyou wanna make sure you're aware of that.\n\n1163\n00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,880\nAlso polymorphic viruses, right?\n\n1164\n00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,570\nWe'll talk about these and\ntalk about what they are.\n\n1165\n00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:56,060\nRetroviruses, metamorphic viruses,\nmultipartite viruses.\n\n1166\n00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,320\nWe'll get into these in our next section,\nin our next discussion.\n\n1167\n00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,440\nReally just wanted to lay out\nthe general virus types for you and\n\n1168\n00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,690\nmake sure we had a general\nidea of what they are.\n\n1169\n00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,850\nThis is gonna be now, what you want\nto make sure you're gathering and\n\n1170\n00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:10,050\nreally focusing on as you get ready to\nanswer some questions in this area.\n\n1171\n00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:13,270\n>> All right, well Adam,\nthat's probably a pretty good spot for\n\n1172\n00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,530\nus to stop and teak a break.\n\n1173\n00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,140\nWhen we get back, we can dive into\nsome of those other areas, and\n\n1174\n00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,680\nwe got a lot more to get through too.\n\n1175\n00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,580\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1176\n00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,460\n>> So\ntons of information coming down the pipe.\n\n1177\n00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,999\nStay tuned.\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1178\n00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:31,276\n>> Okay.\n[MUSIC]\n\n1179\n00:58:31,276 --> 00:58:33,010\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1180\n00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,895\nSo we were in the middle of running\ndown some of the different categories\n\n1181\n00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:39,805\nof exploiting of worms, viruses,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n1182\n00:58:39,805 --> 00:58:43,029\nAnd I think we had a little bit more to\ngo in on viruses before we moved on, so\n\n1183\n00:58:43,029 --> 00:58:44,648\nlet's just jump right back into it.\n\n1184\n00:58:44,648 --> 00:58:45,175\n>> We did.\n\n1185\n00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:46,445\nSo, it is flu season, remember.\n\n1186\n00:58:46,445 --> 00:58:47,115\nGet your flu shots.\n\n1187\n00:58:47,115 --> 00:58:49,005\nThat's also important.\n\n1188\n00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,795\nAll right, so,\nwe were talking about different things,\n\n1189\n00:58:50,795 --> 00:58:52,425\nas Donald was just saying,\nand we left off.\n\n1190\n00:58:52,425 --> 00:58:56,415\nWe have this hit list on our notes, so we\nwanna make sure we are referring back to\n\n1191\n00:58:56,415 --> 00:59:02,170\nhere with polymorphic, metamorphic,\nretro and multipartite virus types.\n\n1192\n00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,120\nAnd we wanna talk about\nthe different virus types.\n\n1193\n00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:08,860\nSo, a polymorphic virus, as you can see,\nis a virus that is able to change itself.\n\n1194\n00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,129\nIt can manipulate its shape,\n\n1195\n00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:14,475\nits structure, its makeup in\norder to be able to fool a virus,\n\n1196\n00:59:14,475 --> 00:59:18,405\na piece of antivirus software solution or\nan anti-malware solution.\n\n1197\n00:59:18,405 --> 00:59:22,865\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nthat polymorphic viruses as a category\n\n1198\n00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:27,490\nare basically called shift viruses, or\nshift changer, or shape changer viruses\n\n1199\n00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:31,320\nbecause the idea there is that they can\nactually modify themselves on the fly.\n\n1200\n00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,430\nSo this is almost like being able to make\nyourself taller, make yourself shorter,\n\n1201\n00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:39,710\nchange your hair color, whatever you may\ndo in order to hide in plain sight, so\n\n1202\n00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,820\nthat the system that's scanning for\n\n1203\n00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:45,210\nyou doesn't realize that really at\nthe end of the day, you are the virus.\n\n1204\n00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,580\nAnd so this is what we talk about.\n\n1205\n00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:51,250\nWhen we talk about metamorphic viruses,\nwe're talking about this idea\n\n1206\n00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:56,260\nthat the metamorphic virus, a type of\npolymorphic virus, a type of shape shifter\n\n1207\n00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:01,980\nor a type of changing virus actually can\ngo in and recompile their code on the fly.\n\n1208\n01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,980\nAnd so what they can do is pull\nfrom different libraries, and\n\n1209\n01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,070\neffectively, like a set of Lincoln Logs or\nbuilding blocks or Legos.\n\n1210\n01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,855\nI'm dating myself here with\nthe Lincoln Logs reference, right?\n\n1211\n01:00:10,855 --> 01:00:11,945\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You ever play with\n\n1212\n01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:13,100\nLincoln Logs when you were a kid?\n\n1213\n01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,760\n>> Absolutely, and\nI bought some for my son, too.\n\n1214\n01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,150\n>> Those are awesome toys.\n\n1215\n01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:19,228\nRight, as adults, one of the few toys I\nstill look forward to being able to play\n\n1216\n01:00:19,228 --> 01:00:21,290\nwith are Lincoln Logs believe it or not.\n\n1217\n01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:24,170\nSo, you know,\nLincoln Log-like file process, right?\n\n1218\n01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,470\nLet's use that analogy.\n\n1219\n01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:30,220\nBuilding blocks, components, if we take\nthree or four different code libraries and\n\n1220\n01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:34,080\nhave them instantiated with the virus\nas part of the code of the virus, and\n\n1221\n01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:38,080\nit can pull from those libraries\nto recreate itself on the fly,\n\n1222\n01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,250\nrecompiling itself as it goes.\n\n1223\n01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:44,010\nIt's gonna be very difficult for\nthe antivirus software to scan for\n\n1224\n01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,560\nthat virus because, in effect,\n\n1225\n01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,740\nthe signature is changing every time\nthe virus replays itself into the system.\n\n1226\n01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,890\nIt's a new virus, right.\n\n1227\n01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,330\nSo that's something to consider and\nreally think about,\n\n1228\n01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:59,020\nbecause at the end of the day, if we face\na new virus every time that machine turns\n\n1229\n01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,382\non, how effective are we going to be\nin removing the virus from the system?\n\n1230\n01:01:02,382 --> 01:01:05,040\nIt's gonna constantly be a zero day\nsolution where we probably don't\n\n1231\n01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,350\nknow anything about it, and\nwe may not be able to keep up with it.\n\n1232\n01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:12,760\nSo these metamorphic viruses, or morph\nviruses, as they sometimes are referred\n\n1233\n01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,820\nto, are gonna be very challenging for\nus to be able to get rid of, right?\n\n1234\n01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:20,050\nSo you wanna make sure you surf\nthe dark corners of the internet\n\n1235\n01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,655\non your friend's computer.\n\n1236\n01:01:21,655 --> 01:01:23,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As opposed to yours.\n\n1237\n01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,920\nJust a thought process there.\n\n1238\n01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,270\nGive them the gift that keeps on giving,\nwhile you then leave and\n\n1239\n01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:30,050\nhave something else on your machine.\n\n1240\n01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:32,610\nAll kidding aside, not your friend's\nmachine because that would be bad and\n\n1241\n01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:33,940\nyou shouldn't do that.\n\n1242\n01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,470\nBut what you should do,\nall kidding aside, let's be serious for\n\n1243\n01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:38,180\na minute about a best practice here.\n\n1244\n01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:42,360\nWhat you think about doing, right, with\nsomething like this, at least what I would\n\n1245\n01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:46,410\nthink about doing to help prevent this\nkind of solution from getting a hold is I\n\n1246\n01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:50,600\nwould run my desktops, my machines, as\nvirtual machines, as opposed to physical\n\n1247\n01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,730\nmachines, because what I can then do\nis I can memory isolate this issue.\n\n1248\n01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:59,499\nAnd if I get a virus in a VM,\nit's very easy for me to isolate that VM,\n\n1249\n01:01:59,499 --> 01:02:03,621\ncut off network access, simply by\ndropping the card out of the settings.\n\n1250\n01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:04,585\nBy the way in real time,\n\n1251\n01:02:04,585 --> 01:02:07,384\nbecause you don't need to turn the VM\noff to kill network access, and\n\n1252\n01:02:07,384 --> 01:02:11,016\nyou're not unplugging the physical machine\nfrom the network while you're doing that.\n\n1253\n01:02:11,016 --> 01:02:14,490\nYou simply change a setting in a file and\nit comes off right away.\n\n1254\n01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:17,940\nSo I could network isolate\nthat VM in real time.\n\n1255\n01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:21,520\nI could reach in and\ngrab the files I need, disinfect that,\n\n1256\n01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,640\ndo whatever I need to do in there, but\nI can keep it in the memory bubble.\n\n1257\n01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,860\nI can shut it off if I need to, right?\n\n1258\n01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,010\nPut it off to the side and\n\n1259\n01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:32,260\nif I have a snapshot, revert back\nto a time that it wasn't infected.\n\n1260\n01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:35,160\nIf I'm storing my data\noutside the virtual machine,\n\n1261\n01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,540\nin other words, and I use data that's\nbeing used in the VM in real time, but\n\n1262\n01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:43,170\nI store it long-term outside the VM,\nwhat liability do I have?\n\n1263\n01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,760\nRight?\nThere's almost no exposure there.\n\n1264\n01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,562\nAnd so this may be a good way for\n\n1265\n01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:51,630\nyou to start thinking about what is the\nbest practice from a survival perspective.\n\n1266\n01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:55,330\nHow do I avoid these things, and\nif I do get infected with them,\n\n1267\n01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:59,120\nhow do I not agonize over whether or not\nI'm gonna be able to restore my system?\n\n1268\n01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,620\nJust go ahead and go virtual.\n\n1269\n01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:03,740\nThe downsize to it really\nis almost nil today, and\n\n1270\n01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:06,240\nthe upside is dramatic when you\nthink about potential impact.\n\n1271\n01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,910\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1272\n01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,020\nSo we do have that.\n\n1273\n01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,920\nWe do have retro-viruses, right?\n\n1274\n01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,980\nWhat was that joke you made about\nretro-viruses as we were talking earlier?\n\n1275\n01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,100\n>> They're the viruses that wear\nbell bottoms and have lava lamps.\n\n1276\n01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,000\n>> Absolutely, right?\n\n1277\n01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,710\nSo the retro-virus, right,\nthe hip cool retro-virus.\n\n1278\n01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:23,490\nSo they're designed defeat antivirus,\nto defeat rather, I should say,\n\n1279\n01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:25,510\nantivirus countermeasures as you can see.\n\n1280\n01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:29,280\nThey also can alter code so\nsignature files don't match, so\n\n1281\n01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,770\nthey are gonna be able to go in,\nfor instance, typically and\n\n1282\n01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:35,360\nthey're a lot of times they're referred\nto as the anti virus virus, right?\n\n1283\n01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,010\nBecause they effectively\nare the anti-antivirus virus,\n\n1284\n01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,183\nI guess is probably a better\nway of putting that.\n\n1285\n01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:44,779\nThey effectively are designed to really go\nafter and target antivirus solutions and\n\n1286\n01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:45,953\ntry to take them out.\n\n1287\n01:03:45,953 --> 01:03:48,738\nThat's specifically what\nthey are designed to do, so\n\n1288\n01:03:48,738 --> 01:03:52,563\nthey will disable countermeasures\nthat antivirus programs put in place.\n\n1289\n01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:57,148\nThey will try to infect antivirus\nexecutables and render them inoperable.\n\n1290\n01:03:57,148 --> 01:03:58,520\nThey'll try to swap them out.\n\n1291\n01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,607\nAnd do all sorts of stuff, so\nthat's what retroviruses do.\n\n1292\n01:04:01,607 --> 01:04:02,895\nNasty little buggers.\n\n1293\n01:04:02,895 --> 01:04:05,690\nAnd then multipartite viruses.\n\n1294\n01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:10,490\nMultipartite viruses are gonna be viruses\nthat are made up of multiple parts,\n\n1295\n01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,940\nhence multiple behaviors as an item there.\n\n1296\n01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:17,500\nThey are viruses that may start out as\na worm and then switch to a virus so\n\n1297\n01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,670\ninfect through non-self rather\nthrough self replicating non-human\n\n1298\n01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:26,070\nintervention mechanisms and then act as\na virus once they get into the system.\n\n1299\n01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,790\nSo Nimbda is a good example of this.\n\n1300\n01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:30,590\nIt infects as a worm and\nthen acts as a virus.\n\n1301\n01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:32,860\nIt spreads through email\nonce that is done.\n\n1302\n01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,390\nRight, spreads through network shares,\nspreads through emails.\n\n1303\n01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:37,290\nVarious ways of seeing that happen.\n\n1304\n01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,520\nSo, multi part type viruses, viruses\nthat are made up of multiple parts and\n\n1305\n01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,150\nbehave typically as both worms and\nviruses to their benefit.\n\n1306\n01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,810\nSo, be aware of that.\n\n1307\n01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:47,180\nThose again, examples of those abound, and\n\n1308\n01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,280\nyou can find them all\nover the place today.\n\n1309\n01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,075\nSo, when we wanna talk about going out and\nfinding these kinds of things,\n\n1310\n01:04:53,075 --> 01:04:56,835\nawareness of infection rates,\n\n1311\n01:04:56,835 --> 01:05:01,015\nawareness of potential\nvulnerabilities that exist.\n\n1312\n01:05:01,015 --> 01:05:04,950\nAnd, you know, broadcasting that out and\nmaking the community at large aware of it.\n\n1313\n01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:07,540\nMeans you as a practitioner have\nto know where to find them.\n\n1314\n01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,090\nThere are many websites out there\nthat could be valuable to you.\n\n1315\n01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:12,180\nI think we have one that\nwe are gonna bring up for\n\n1316\n01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,910\nyou quickly which is\nthe cve.mitre.org website.\n\n1317\n01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:19,220\nAnd so we're gonna go out take\na look at the common vulnerability.\n\n1318\n01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:22,160\nA website here and\nI think Don has that open for us or\n\n1319\n01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,670\nat least he does have it there.\n\n1320\n01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:28,317\nAnd so you'll see their CVE if we\nkind of stop right there, right?\n\n1321\n01:05:28,317 --> 01:05:33,578\nYou'll see CVE is really set up here to\nfocus on the vulnerability management,\n\n1322\n01:05:33,578 --> 01:05:37,270\npatch management, learning,\nintrusion detection,\n\n1323\n01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:42,750\ncontent automation and discovery,\nthe US cert bulletins are listed here..\n\n1324\n01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:46,220\nSo all the bulletins from\nthe United States government's own\n\n1325\n01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:49,770\nComputer Emergency Response\nteams are available here, and\n\n1326\n01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:54,240\nwe cross-reference that\nwith other CVE entries or\n\n1327\n01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,170\nother CERT entries that are coming\nin from other countries.\n\n1328\n01:05:57,170 --> 01:06:00,150\nBut just click through the U.S.\nCERT bulletins link there if you could for\n\n1329\n01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:03,200\nme for just a minute, And let's just\ntake a look at what we see there.\n\n1330\n01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,530\nSo you see this takes us directly out\nto the United States Cert website, and\n\n1331\n01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,290\nI think we showed this in one of\nour earlier episodes at some point.\n\n1332\n01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:11,300\nWe put this up.\n\n1333\n01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,428\nAnd so, we can see whatever's out there.\n\n1334\n01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:17,680\nThere's you know Microsoft security\nadvisories there, right, Mozilla updates,\n\n1335\n01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,320\nthings like that.\n\n1336\n01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,120\nSo all sorts of stuff.\n\n1337\n01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:24,300\nSo being aware of where to go to find this\nkind of information, very important for\n\n1338\n01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,800\nyou as a practitioner.\n\n1339\n01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,550\nTo know about websites like cve.mitre.org\nso that you're aware of it.\n\n1340\n01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,620\nWe call that a clearinghouse,\nby the way, right?\n\n1341\n01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:36,210\nIt's aggregating a lot of\ninformation together for you.\n\n1342\n01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:39,088\nYou know most of the big\nmajor Anti-virus and\n\n1343\n01:06:39,088 --> 01:06:41,900\nsecurity vendors tend to have their sites.\n\n1344\n01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:46,330\nSo, Verizon does their data breach\nreport every year, Symantec,\n\n1345\n01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:48,510\nwho I think owns the entire world now\n>> Right.\n\n1346\n01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:53,010\n>> Pretty much when it comes to security,\nthey have their own virus clearing house\n\n1347\n01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:57,360\nas part of their security efforts and\nyou know, very very good stuff there.\n\n1348\n01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,360\nThey put a lot of information out there.\n\n1349\n01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,060\nSo looking at the data breach reports,\nlooking at the clearing houses from major\n\n1350\n01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:07,440\nvendors in the market, is gonna be very\nimportant for you as a professional\n\n1351\n01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,900\nto get skilled up and really knowledgeable\nabout what's going on out there.\n\n1352\n01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,070\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1353\n01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:12,810\nOkay?\n\n1354\n01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:15,150\nSo, [COUGH] let's make sure\nthat you're aware of that.\n\n1355\n01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:16,630\nLet's make sure you know that.\n\n1356\n01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:20,200\nAnd let's just remind you that we\nare obviously talking about malware.\n\n1357\n01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,520\nRight we're talking about\nmalicious code and activities.\n\n1358\n01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,120\nWe're talking about viruses, but\nwe're talking about the knowledge area in\n\n1359\n01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,510\nthe SSCP that deals with\nmalicious code and activities.\n\n1360\n01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,958\nThat's what we're really trying to address\nwhen we speak about this content right?\n\n1361\n01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:34,700\nAlright so, trojans,\nwe've talked about trojans,\n\n1362\n01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:39,440\nwe've talked about the remote aspect of\ntrojans, RATs, as they're referred to.\n\n1363\n01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,920\nRemote Access Trojans Let's talk\na little bit about mobile code.\n\n1364\n01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,190\nSo mobile code is going\nto be active content,\n\n1365\n01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:48,190\nactive code that is available out there.\n\n1366\n01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,380\nIt is not code you'll often.\n\n1367\n01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,710\nI had one student come and\ntell me this once, mobile code, so\n\n1368\n01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:56,440\nthat's code that moves around or code that\npotentially runs on a mobile system so\n\n1369\n01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,960\nI have it wherever I go.\n\n1370\n01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,110\nYou know that's a good thought process,\nbut not necessarily how we define it.\n\n1371\n01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:05,100\nWe're simply talking about code that is\nactive, that can be used in web browsers,\n\n1372\n01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,720\nand used in a variety of\nformats in different areas.\n\n1373\n01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,551\nRight and so this is ActiveX,\n\n1374\n01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:14,490\nthe Microsoft plug in solution that\nis used to drive their web content.\n\n1375\n01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,410\nJava, JavaScript falls into this category.\n\n1376\n01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:20,080\nMacros, generically fall\ninto this category.\n\n1377\n01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,020\nVB Script.\n\n1378\n01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:24,320\nAny kind of scripting solution\ngenerically, VB Script in particular.\n\n1379\n01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:30,940\nBrowser plug-ins like Silverlight,\nlike flash, like shockwave, Adobe air,\n\n1380\n01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,940\nwhich is another one that we don't often\nthink about but are there as well.\n\n1381\n01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,190\nThese are browser plugins.\n\n1382\n01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:41,260\nAny of the third party plugins\nthat you could be thinking about\n\n1383\n01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:45,030\nthat go into not just Microsoft products,\nbut go into any of the browser products.\n\n1384\n01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:49,733\nRight so it goes into Google, goes into\nChrome for instance, if it goes into\n\n1385\n01:08:49,733 --> 01:08:54,088\nMozilla and to Firefox, and\nit goes into Apple, it goes into Safari.\n\n1386\n01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:54,930\nRight?\nYou know any\n\n1387\n01:08:54,930 --> 01:09:00,150\nof those plugins that you download and use\npotentially are classified as mobile code.\n\n1388\n01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:04,699\nSo, anything that allows us to introduce\nfunctionality by plugging something in,\n\n1389\n01:09:04,699 --> 01:09:07,180\nright is what we're talking about here.\n\n1390\n01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:11,260\nThere are all sorts of potential\nliabilities associated with these.\n\n1391\n01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:15,160\nYou have a lot of well documented issues\nwith ActiveX out there; don't have to\n\n1392\n01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,640\nspend a lot of time explaining why\nit might be a good or a bad thing,\n\n1393\n01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,560\nreally just focusing you on the idea\nthat it is necessary if you run\n\n1394\n01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,840\nMicrosoft infrastructure to\npotentially engage in using ActiveX.\n\n1395\n01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,840\nBut there's a reason we\nminimize ActiveX's exposure and\n\n1396\n01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,490\nfootprint in our Internet Explorer\nsettings, right?\n\n1397\n01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:35,630\nCan we pull up the settings\nof IE real quick?\n\n1398\n01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,510\nDo we, we have the browser open, don't we?\n\n1399\n01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,770\n>> Sure.\n>> Lets just go in there real quick,\n\n1400\n01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,410\njust look at the settings and do this.\n\n1401\n01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,920\nGo to about internet explorer for\n\n1402\n01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,872\nme at the very bottom there\nbefore we do anything else.\n\n1403\n01:09:43,872 --> 01:09:46,400\nAnd let's just show people what\nversion of IE is being used\n\n1404\n01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,550\nbecause it's going to look a little\ndifferent by version, right?\n\n1405\n01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:52,650\nSo we just want to know IE 11 and\nDon is doing the right thing here.\n\n1406\n01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,810\nLet's hang here for a second,\nI want to point something out.\n\n1407\n01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:57,640\nSo notice the settings that\nDon has on his system.\n\n1408\n01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,690\nRight?\n\n1409\n01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,530\nJust looking at this,\nwe can tell obviously\n\n1410\n01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,780\nthat he is automating the installation\nof new software here.\n\n1411\n01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,410\nHe's got the check mark in the box.\n\n1412\n01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,190\nNow that may be a good or a bad thing,\nso let's think about this for a minute.\n\n1413\n01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:11,600\nLet's talk about default settings and\nwhat users may or\n\n1414\n01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,310\nmay not be aware of is going on.\n\n1415\n01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:17,680\nWith a piece of software like this\nin particular, you know Google and\n\n1416\n01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:23,210\nMozilla based browsers, Firefox for\ninstance, Chrome, and the Safari browser,\n\n1417\n01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,440\nall automatically update at a certain\nlevel for certain things as well.\n\n1418\n01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,770\nSo this is not unique to Windows and\nunique to IE.\n\n1419\n01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:32,805\nBut what this represents for\nus and has represented since IE10.\n\n1420\n01:10:32,805 --> 01:10:36,120\nCuz this is a IE10 and now an IE11 thing.\n\n1421\n01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,620\nIs by default by the way\nthis setting is set that\n\n1422\n01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,400\nthe vendor pushes down new\nversions of the software and\n\n1423\n01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,490\nyou're automatically going to install\nthem whether you want them there or not.\n\n1424\n01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:49,280\nAnd so this is something to consider\nbecause IE11 is a good example of this\n\n1425\n01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,250\nbecause it is not being universally\naccepted on every website because of\n\n1426\n01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,610\nthe code base right now.\n\n1427\n01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:58,330\nAnd as a result of that you may not be\nable to do certain things you were able to\n\n1428\n01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:00,780\ndo before the update when\nyou push a new version.\n\n1429\n01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:04,580\nAnd this could also obviously clearly,\naside just from usability,\n\n1430\n01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:08,450\nopen up a whole host of liabilities\nassociated with unknown vulnerabilities.\n\n1431\n01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:09,830\nRight?\nI sound like Dr. Seuss.\n\n1432\n01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:12,390\nOne fish, two fish,\nred fish, blue fish, right?\n\n1433\n01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:16,200\nSo, vulnerabilities,\nliabilities, very important.\n\n1434\n01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,060\nWhat I educate my users, my customers,\n\n1435\n01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:23,010\nmy students to think about with\nsettings like this is uncheck that box.\n\n1436\n01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:24,710\nDon't leave it selected.\n\n1437\n01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,860\nWhen you get pushed a new browser update,\n\n1438\n01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:29,250\nthat should be something\nthat IT is aware of.\n\n1439\n01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,940\nThere should be some testing around it.\n\n1440\n01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:33,950\nThere should be some thought\nprocess around change management.\n\n1441\n01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:37,260\nIn an enterprise, in a business,\nbefore this automatic update and\n\n1442\n01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,490\ninstall takes place.\n\n1443\n01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:43,017\nIf this is you as an individual user,\non your own machine caveat emptor, right,\n\n1444\n01:11:43,017 --> 01:11:44,070\nbuyer beware.\n\n1445\n01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:47,682\nIt's up to you to decide whether or\nnot this is a good idea.\n\n1446\n01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:52,184\nBut if you think that just automatically\nupdating because the vendor says it's\n\n1447\n01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:54,411\na good idea is gonna then keep you safe.\n\n1448\n01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:57,713\nClearly that can be an issue that we\nare just unfortunately misinformed\n\n1449\n01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:58,488\nabout, right?\n\n1450\n01:11:58,488 --> 01:12:00,590\nBecause it's not that way.\n\n1451\n01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:03,810\nYou're actually probably less\nsecure by automatically updating\n\n1452\n01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:07,770\nwithout understanding the impact of\nthat new patch, that new software item,\n\n1453\n01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:10,740\nthan you are if you don't apply it\nuntil after somebody's gone through and\n\n1454\n01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:11,530\ndone the due diligence.\n\n1455\n01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:14,490\nSo I always want to point this out\nwhen we talk about these things,\n\n1456\n01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,990\nbecause this inadvertently\nas a default setting\n\n1457\n01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:19,210\ncould actually be causing\nmore harm than good right?\n\n1458\n01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,270\nSo we just wanna know that.\n\n1459\n01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:21,380\nSo hit close.\n\n1460\n01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:24,840\nLet's actually then if you don't mind\nlet's take a look at the settings there.\n\n1461\n01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,500\nAnd let's just go ahead and\n\n1462\n01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,930\ntake a look at some of the security\nsettings really quickly.\n\n1463\n01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:30,400\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nDon's just gonna set this up for us and\n\n1464\n01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,310\ntake us over to the security area there.\n\n1465\n01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:34,060\nYeah, we'll go to security.\n\n1466\n01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:36,650\nIf we could drill in and\nmaybe just do custom level on one.\n\n1467\n01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:39,370\nWe just wanna take a look at some\nof the ActiveX check boxes and\n\n1468\n01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:40,960\nthe script executables, things like that.\n\n1469\n01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,080\nJust to remind people of what's there.\n\n1470\n01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,920\nAnd so you have this ability in IE,\nagain, varies by version.\n\n1471\n01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,510\nMeaning it will be in a different place in\ncertain earlier versions of the browser,\n\n1472\n01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:52,510\nbut it's always found in\nInternet Explorer options,\n\n1473\n01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:54,370\nit's just a matter of where you look for\nit.\n\n1474\n01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,630\nAnd you can turn on and turn off, enable,\n\n1475\n01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:58,900\ndisable, all sorts of settings here,\nright?\n\n1476\n01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,000\nAnd as we go down,\nwe were talking about ActiveX,\n\n1477\n01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,560\nyou can see there,\nActiveX controls and plugins enabled,\n\n1478\n01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,130\nallow previously unused ActiveX controls\nto run without prompt, disabled, right?\n\n1479\n01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:10,470\nAllow script is disabled,\n\n1480\n01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:13,600\nautomatic prompting is disabled,\nshame on you, by the way.\n\n1481\n01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:19,660\nWhich means that in effect, what's\nhappening is ActiveX controls can actually\n\n1482\n01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:23,120\ncome up and potentially run in Don's\nsystem without him being aware of it.\n\n1483\n01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,050\nNow it's a nuisance thing.\n\n1484\n01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:26,010\nI get that.\nWe all know you don't want to be prompted\n\n1485\n01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:29,890\nevery time you go to a page and refresh\nfive times to get functionality working.\n\n1486\n01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,940\nBut you have to think about the impact of\nsome of these settings and what it may or\n\n1487\n01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:35,010\nmay not mean for you from what\nthey call a protection profile.\n\n1488\n01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,580\n>> You know it's funny Adam.\n\n1489\n01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:39,950\nI don't use internet explorer normally,\nonly on this show.\n\n1490\n01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:42,080\nAnd so these are actually the defaults.\n\n1491\n01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,070\n>> I know they are, but do they,\nthe default's for, I think, what?\n\n1492\n01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,855\nMedium, right?\n\n1493\n01:13:44,855 --> 01:13:45,510\nMedium-high?\n\n1494\n01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:47,070\n>> Yes.\n>> Not the default for high, right?\n\n1495\n01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:49,135\nIf you change back to high,\nsome of those things do change.\n\n1496\n01:13:49,135 --> 01:13:49,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so,\n\n1497\n01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:53,380\nit's a question of what security, as I was\njust mentioning, protection profile or\n\n1498\n01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:56,720\nsetting we want to go ahead and\ntry to figure out how to use here, right?\n\n1499\n01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,830\nBecause this is really the important\nthing, is understanding\n\n1500\n01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:03,980\nwhat the choice of high versus medium-high\nversus medium may mean, right?\n\n1501\n01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,530\nAnd we don't have to\nnecessarily reset it now,\n\n1502\n01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:10,550\nbut just thinking through what those\nchoices are is all I'm suggesting to you.\n\n1503\n01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,670\nSo there is a host of settings in here.\n\n1504\n01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:14,930\nYou obviously want to look at this,\nand not just in IE,\n\n1505\n01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:17,240\nby the way,\nwe're not just picking on Microsoft.\n\n1506\n01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,400\nAny of the browsers you use.\n\n1507\n01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,530\nWe can have Don pull up Google Chrome and\nlook at the same issues there, and\n\n1508\n01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:25,520\nlook at plugins that are being managed\nthere, and those kinds of things.\n\n1509\n01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,350\nSo think about that, and\njust be aware of that.\n\n1510\n01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:30,260\nWe're not going to run through the entire\nlist, but really just wanted to get you in\n\n1511\n01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:34,190\nthe mindset of making sure you're aware\nof that and understanding that, right?\n\n1512\n01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:36,000\nSo we do run into malware software for\n\n1513\n01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,150\nActiveX controls that is part of\nthe settings, that is enabled.\n\n1514\n01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:40,700\nBut what if somebody changes the settings,\nright?\n\n1515\n01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,810\nOne of the things malware does is it\ncomes in and manipulates these settings.\n\n1516\n01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:44,940\nYou may not realize it.\n\n1517\n01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:49,190\nAnd it may still say medium high or high\nby the way, on the reset item there, and\n\n1518\n01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:52,550\nwhat it is, the protection profile, even\nthough the settings have been changed.\n\n1519\n01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:56,090\nBecause what malware will do is modify\nthose settings in the registry,\n\n1520\n01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:59,440\nand then not change the indicator,\nthe graphical indicator in the GUI.\n\n1521\n01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,870\nSo just be aware of that and\n\n1522\n01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:03,540\nbe thinking about that,\nbecause that's the kind of stuff\n\n1523\n01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:07,970\nthat potentially could lead to a lot of\ndevastating effects if we're not careful.\n\n1524\n01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,100\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1525\n01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,940\n>> All right.\nSo let's cancel out of that and\n\n1526\n01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,080\ngo back to where we were.\n\n1527\n01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,360\nSo obviously evidence of attacks is\nwhat we're kind of getting at here and\n\n1528\n01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,910\nmanipulation of systems.\n\n1529\n01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:19,180\nSo before we, you know,\nfinish up with mobile code.\n\n1530\n01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,010\nLet's just generically\ntalk about the indicators.\n\n1531\n01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:22,330\nThe warning signs of attacks.\n\n1532\n01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,030\nRight?\nWe could see, as we said,\n\n1533\n01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:25,540\nmanipulated settings.\n\n1534\n01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:29,680\nWe could potentially see versions\nof software being changed,\n\n1535\n01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,720\nthings being installed or\nmodified so features, role,\n\n1536\n01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,770\nstuff like that,\npotentially could be modified.\n\n1537\n01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:40,120\nChanges to our home page for instance,\nright, our browser could be redirected.\n\n1538\n01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,550\nIncreased virus activity, right?\n\n1539\n01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:46,290\nWe may see increased\nactivity in our scanner,\n\n1540\n01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:49,540\nwe may be running more scans and\nfinding more things.\n\n1541\n01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:54,470\nWe could see an increase in system\nusage of resources, so processors and\n\n1542\n01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:56,270\nmemory usage could go up.\n\n1543\n01:15:56,270 --> 01:16:01,360\nWe could have unusual services\nbeing run inside our systems.\n\n1544\n01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,910\nYou know, we may or may not,\n\n1545\n01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:06,140\nto you out there listening to us today and\nin the future, may or\n\n1546\n01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:12,120\nmay not be familiar with the ways to be\nable to find a service that is running.\n\n1547\n01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,420\nIf the service is running\ntraditionally in Windows,\n\n1548\n01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,610\nwe can simply expose it through the\ncontrol panel through the service's MMC.\n\n1549\n01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:19,730\nBut what if that service is stealthed?\n\n1550\n01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:23,210\nWhat if it doesn't appear in that list\nbecause the virus has set it up in such\n\n1551\n01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,270\na way that we don't show it?\n\n1552\n01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,360\nWe'll be there and we'll be running,\nbut we won't see the impact of it.\n\n1553\n01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,920\nSo we may need deeper scanning.\n\n1554\n01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,170\nWe may need to use something like PROC or\nTOC.\n\n1555\n01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:35,911\nPlist is the port of that in\nWindows from the Sysinternals, and\n\n1556\n01:16:35,911 --> 01:16:37,330\nWinternals now right?\n\n1557\n01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:40,620\nCuz Microsoft on the other side owns that.\n\n1558\n01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:45,330\nBut so the former Sysinternals System\nInternal's company is now Winterna'ls for\n\n1559\n01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:47,990\nseveral years now, but\nthey have a program called PList,\n\n1560\n01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:51,180\nwhich will basically go out and\nlist all of the active,\n\n1561\n01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:54,260\nrunning processes, even the ones\nthat are stealth will show up there.\n\n1562\n01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:56,900\nSo looking at that, Process Explorer,\n\n1563\n01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:59,990\nwhich is a graphical version of that\ncommand line solution, you know?\n\n1564\n01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,510\nWhat's running, in effect,\n\n1565\n01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:05,770\nand looking at that which is their\ngraphical overlet will be very helpful.\n\n1566\n01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:08,410\nIn Linux and Unix it would be\nsomething like TOC and Proc,\n\n1567\n01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:12,540\nwhere you list all of the processes\nin some sort of tabular layout.\n\n1568\n01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,700\nThese are important skills to have.\n\n1569\n01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:18,520\nSome are older, some are newer, but\nunderstanding how to find services that\n\n1570\n01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,230\nare running in the system even\nthough they may not be apparent\n\n1571\n01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:24,460\nis one of the things that would be\nindicative of seeing this activity.\n\n1572\n01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,840\nSo I wanna make sure we have that.\n\n1573\n01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,529\nYou know, if a system all of\na sudden runs really badly,\n\n1574\n01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:32,490\nafter you've read an mail that has\nan attachment associated with it.\n\n1575\n01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:35,720\nPerhaps installed something at\nthe prompting of what you thought was\n\n1576\n01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:39,460\na trusted party, and now things seem\nto be running worse than normal.\n\n1577\n01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,330\nThat could be an indication\nthat you may have a problem.\n\n1578\n01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:44,200\nYou may not have thought about it and\nlinked it back to that, but we often\n\n1579\n01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,970\nin hindsight think about that and go, oh\nyeah, no, that must have been what it was.\n\n1580\n01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:50,970\nAnd we didn't realize it right, so\nobviously something to think about there.\n\n1581\n01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:53,040\nNow we did talk about the DMZ.\n\n1582\n01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,520\nWe did talk about the defense\nin depth concept earlier.\n\n1583\n01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,540\nWe had the nice picture\nthat we'd thrown up.\n\n1584\n01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:01,390\nAnd just reminding you that obviously\nthe more time we spend thinking\n\n1585\n01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:06,330\nabout the protective areas that we create\nand carve out, hopefully the more time we\n\n1586\n01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:10,520\nthen are gonna be able to spend managing\nas opposed to mitigating our network.\n\n1587\n01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,270\nSo this is just a general truism, right?\n\n1588\n01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:16,330\nMore time up front,\nmore proactive time spent planning.\n\n1589\n01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:17,940\nLess time on the backend spent reacting.\n\n1590\n01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,380\nSo that's something for\n\n1591\n01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,860\nyou to be aware of as a theme that\nwe've talked about here, as well.\n\n1592\n01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:23,525\nAnd just be thinking about that.\n\n1593\n01:18:23,525 --> 01:18:25,620\nYou know, denial of service attacks and\n\n1594\n01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:30,915\ndistributed denial of service attacks both\ncan be stopped by a well architected DMZ.\n\n1595\n01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:33,205\nCan we throw the picture back up for\njust a second?\n\n1596\n01:18:33,205 --> 01:18:33,705\n>> Sure.\n\n1597\n01:18:34,735 --> 01:18:36,585\n>> Always at the ready with our diagram.\n\n1598\n01:18:36,585 --> 01:18:40,470\nAnd so, we see here that in the internet\ncloud on the right, as we come\n\n1599\n01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:45,040\ninto the first firewall in the DMZ, that\nwe're able to think about inbound traffic.\n\n1600\n01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,210\nNow, at that firewall,\nif we're interdicting traffic and\n\n1601\n01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:51,390\nfiltering based on,\nobviously not probably based on IP,\n\n1602\n01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:55,010\nbecause it's gonna be very tough\nThe filter inbound on an IP range, right?\n\n1603\n01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:58,450\nUnless we have a dedicated pipe between us\nand maybe another vendor, trusted third\n\n1604\n01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:02,300\nparty connection, where we have a known\nsource and a known endpoint, right?\n\n1605\n01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,260\nWhere we can then filter based on that.\n\n1606\n01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,440\nBut for traditional DMZs that\nare open to the outside world,\n\n1607\n01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,970\nthis would simply be raw\ntraffic streaming in.\n\n1608\n01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,670\nNow what we didn't show you in this\ndiagram would be, we may have an IDS or\n\n1609\n01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,120\nan IPS solution sitting in the cloud\n\n1610\n01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,830\nthat is filtering before we\neven get to the firewall.\n\n1611\n01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:20,638\nSo it's doing a first\nswipe at some traffic.\n\n1612\n01:19:20,638 --> 01:19:23,657\nAnd so that could be the outer\nparameter of our DMZ.\n\n1613\n01:19:23,657 --> 01:19:27,805\nSo things like Postini for instance, or\na service like that, that's doing SPAM\n\n1614\n01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:32,490\nfiltering and SPAM confidence management\nso that we are looking at inbound email.\n\n1615\n01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:36,040\nFiltering out a bunch of stuff before\nwe even get into our gateway devices.\n\n1616\n01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,130\nThat could be an example\nof something here.\n\n1617\n01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,710\nSo that's kind of a second or a third step\n\n1618\n01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:44,680\nwe would think about in architecting\na DMZ, because that could add value.\n\n1619\n01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,673\nBut let's just say we're\ncoming in blind and\n\n1620\n01:19:46,673 --> 01:19:48,726\nthere's no traffic\nfiltering ahead of time.\n\n1621\n01:19:48,726 --> 01:19:53,433\nWe hit that firewall, that firewall has to\nmake some very quick decisions about what\n\n1622\n01:19:53,433 --> 01:19:55,435\nit is we are or aren't gonna allow.\n\n1623\n01:19:55,435 --> 01:20:00,090\nSo we may have a rule that says allow all\ninbound TCP traffic Inbound to the web\n\n1624\n01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:04,530\nserver on ports 80 and 443\nhypothetically and maybe even a secure,\n\n1625\n01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:09,116\nrandomized port because we have some\nother services that are running, but\n\n1626\n01:20:09,116 --> 01:20:13,234\nwe may decide to block all\ntraffic on any port above 40,000.\n\n1627\n01:20:13,234 --> 01:20:16,253\nJust because we don't want that traffic\ncoming in hypothetically, right?\n\n1628\n01:20:16,253 --> 01:20:18,830\nOr we may allow it all in but\nwe may not allow it out, right?\n\n1629\n01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,370\nThere's different ways of looking at this.\n\n1630\n01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:24,280\nSo, there's lots of ways to put\na firewall to use in the DMZ\n\n1631\n01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,980\nto effectively deal with things\nthat could be going on inside.\n\n1632\n01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:31,250\nMalware that's bursting this\ntraffic out over the web.\n\n1633\n01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,900\nRight, so we can interdict this traffic.\n\n1634\n01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,560\nBut the malware vendors are smart.\n\n1635\n01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,717\nAnd make no mistake, they are vendors,\nthey're looking to make money, right?\n\n1636\n01:20:39,717 --> 01:20:43,211\nThey're in business, not only to take\nyour business away from you, but\n\n1637\n01:20:43,211 --> 01:20:45,620\nthey sell access and\nthey make money doing it.\n\n1638\n01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:48,390\nAnd so one of the things\nthey've gotten smart at is,\n\n1639\n01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:52,570\nthey're gonna take that traffic from\ninside the LAN that they wanna send out.\n\n1640\n01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:55,010\nThe command and\ncontrol traffic that has to come in and\n\n1641\n01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:57,870\nthe traffic that goes back\nout going the other way.\n\n1642\n01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:59,607\nAnd they're going to go ahead and\n\n1643\n01:20:59,607 --> 01:21:03,703\nthey're gonna tunnel that traffic inside\nof existing protocols and existing\n\n1644\n01:21:03,703 --> 01:21:07,999\nports that are being used that are open in\nthe firewall that are being allowed out.\n\n1645\n01:21:07,999 --> 01:21:12,782\nSo we'll talk a lot about things\nlike IPsec and tunneling traffic and\n\n1646\n01:21:12,782 --> 01:21:18,308\ntalk about RPC over HTTP where we tunnel\nRPC traffic inside an HTTP web session so\n\n1647\n01:21:18,308 --> 01:21:23,691\nwe can move it through a firewall\nwithout opening additional ports, right?\n\n1648\n01:21:23,691 --> 01:21:25,490\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n1649\n01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:29,660\nSo there's value in that, but the problem\nis that the antivirus vendors know\n\n1650\n01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:32,250\nhow to scan for\nthat traffic when it's in the clear.\n\n1651\n01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:35,110\nWhen it's tunneled and encrypted,\nit may be difficult to interdict and\n\n1652\n01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:36,450\nunderstand that it's there.\n\n1653\n01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:40,285\nAnd so, as a result of that, we may be\npassing a lot of this traffic back and\n\n1654\n01:21:40,285 --> 01:21:41,825\nforth without realizing it.\n\n1655\n01:21:41,825 --> 01:21:47,825\nAnd our traditional DMZ architecture may\nbe actually wide open to these botnets,\n\n1656\n01:21:47,825 --> 01:21:50,755\nand these distributed denial of\nservice and denial of service attacks.\n\n1657\n01:21:50,755 --> 01:21:51,916\nDo we have a DDoS?\n\n1658\n01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:53,118\nWe had a DDoS.\n\n1659\n01:21:53,118 --> 01:21:54,088\n>> We do, somewhere.\n\n1660\n01:21:54,088 --> 01:21:55,995\n>> We had a DDoS graphic that\nwe wanted to bring up, right?\n\n1661\n01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:56,885\nThere we go.\nSo\n\n1662\n01:21:56,885 --> 01:21:59,765\nlet's just quickly talk about denial of\nservice and distributed denial of service,\n\n1663\n01:21:59,765 --> 01:22:01,190\nand what the difference is.\n\n1664\n01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:03,470\nSo in this diagram here, right?\n\n1665\n01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:05,320\nWe have a handler which\nis off to the left.\n\n1666\n01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,054\nThis would be the bot handler or\n\n1667\n01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:11,136\nthe zombie handler that is gonna run\nthis botnet or zombie net, whoops.\n\n1668\n01:22:11,136 --> 01:22:13,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That is gonna be over there.\n\n1669\n01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,600\n>> There we go.\n\n1670\n01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,460\nAnd so the handler, and there may be\nmore than one by the the way, right?\n\n1671\n01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:22,430\nThe handler is going to be the entity that\nis gonna control the machines that have\n\n1672\n01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:24,800\nbeen infected with malware and\nare being remotely accessed.\n\n1673\n01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,340\nSo, all the bots down below there\n\n1674\n01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:30,050\nare being managed by this handler\nbeing given instructions.\n\n1675\n01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:33,767\nSo when you go out and buy a botnet or\nrent one you're going to be dealing with\n\n1676\n01:22:33,767 --> 01:22:37,545\nsomeone who ultimately is going to give\nyou access to a group of machines that\n\n1677\n01:22:37,545 --> 01:22:40,577\nhave been infected with some\nsort of remote access malware.\n\n1678\n01:22:40,577 --> 01:22:45,071\nAnd then they are going to be used to\ntarget and effectively turn as one and\n\n1679\n01:22:45,071 --> 01:22:48,030\naccess some sort of victim or\ntarget computer.\n\n1680\n01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:51,530\nIn this case, up on the right-hand side,\nthrough the internet cloud, and\n\n1681\n01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:52,600\nout through the firewall there.\n\n1682\n01:22:53,792 --> 01:22:58,761\nSo, what'll happen in a distributed denial\nof service, in a DDoS attack, is all\n\n1683\n01:22:58,761 --> 01:23:03,513\nthat traffic from all those machines in\nblue is being targeted at one machine,\n\n1684\n01:23:03,513 --> 01:23:08,050\nthat if we can then simply just overwhelm\nwith the amount of traffic that's\n\n1685\n01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:10,668\ncoming in, we can effectively take down.\n\n1686\n01:23:10,668 --> 01:23:13,100\nNow what I often point out\nto a lot of my students, and\n\n1687\n01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,697\nwhen I build solutions and architect\nthem for clients and we talk about this,\n\n1688\n01:23:16,697 --> 01:23:19,373\nit's this idea of this signal\npoint of failure, right?\n\n1689\n01:23:19,373 --> 01:23:22,790\nThe SPOF, and\nwe look at the weakest link in the chain.\n\n1690\n01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:25,800\nIf I want to take out that\nvictim target right there,\n\n1691\n01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,090\nI'm probably not even gonna\nbother to target that machine.\n\n1692\n01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:29,660\nIf it was me,\n\n1693\n01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:34,610\nI would be targeting the routers that feed\nthe firewall that feed the pipe coming in.\n\n1694\n01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:38,190\nBecause routers are a lot easier\nto take down than firewalls are.\n\n1695\n01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:41,220\nAnd firewalls are probably\neasier to take down\n\n1696\n01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:44,550\nif we can choke the access\nthat feeds into them off.\n\n1697\n01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:47,540\nBecause I don't ever have to bother\nhacking into a Cisco firewall,\n\n1698\n01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,460\nI just have to kill\nthe router that feeds it.\n\n1699\n01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:53,180\nAnd I can do that a lot easier simply by\noverwhelming it with too much traffic.\n\n1700\n01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:58,120\nSo as a result of that, if I can sustain\nmillions of packets per second being\n\n1701\n01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:02,025\nthrown across this router, I can\noverwhelm it and simply take it down.\n\n1702\n01:24:02,025 --> 01:24:04,608\nNow, the smart person knows they\ncan cycle the router, right?\n\n1703\n01:24:04,608 --> 01:24:08,072\nAnd as a result they can clear the buffers\nand bring it back up, but if you're having\n\n1704\n01:24:08,072 --> 01:24:11,194\nto constantly power-cycle your devices\nto keep connectivity coming in,\n\n1705\n01:24:11,194 --> 01:24:14,730\nI've effectively denied you service and\nthat's the goal of the attack.\n\n1706\n01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:18,070\nSo I may never actually try to\nexploit vulnerabilities on that\n\n1707\n01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:21,290\ntarget machine directly\nto carry out a DDoS.\n\n1708\n01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:25,517\nI may simply target the pipes that feed\nit, effectively cutting off the air that\n\n1709\n01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:28,563\nthe network breathes in order\nto bring things in and out.\n\n1710\n01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:31,408\nNow different would be\na denial of service attack,\n\n1711\n01:24:31,408 --> 01:24:35,230\nthis may happen from inside the network or\noutside either way.\n\n1712\n01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:38,420\nBut it's a single machine going\nup against a single machine.\n\n1713\n01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,518\nAs opposed to a group of\nmachines distributed,\n\n1714\n01:24:40,518 --> 01:24:42,650\ndenial of service group of machines.\n\n1715\n01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:45,842\nA single bot or a single machine\ntargeting another machine is\n\n1716\n01:24:45,842 --> 01:24:48,165\nsimply gonna be a denial\nof service attack.\n\n1717\n01:24:48,165 --> 01:24:50,149\nAnd so we want to understand\nthe difference there,\n\n1718\n01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:52,650\nwhere we're looking to take\nout a service or a machine.\n\n1719\n01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:56,550\nBut we may not bring an entire army\nwith us, right, in order to do so.\n\n1720\n01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,600\nSo let's just make sure we're\ncomfortable with those definitions.\n\n1721\n01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,770\nBut at the end of the day, we see a lot\nof DDoS activity taking place out there,\n\n1722\n01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:07,680\nand we talked about, for instance\nearly on, that you could go out and\n\n1723\n01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,050\nrent botnets, and it's all the rage today.\n\n1724\n01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:13,200\nYou can rent them with BitCoin, you can\nrent them with any digital currency.\n\n1725\n01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,220\nCan also pay real dollars for them or\ntrade them for goods and services in kind,\n\n1726\n01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:20,300\nmeaning you may trade them for access.\n\n1727\n01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:24,000\nThe bot handler may want access to\nthat network for some other reason.\n\n1728\n01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,530\nAnd they may be willing to work with\nyou to get in if you can provide them\n\n1729\n01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:28,190\nintelligence on how to do so, right?\n\n1730\n01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:32,210\nAt least that's what I've heard is\na myth and legend out there, anyway.\n\n1731\n01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,523\nJust be aware of that.\n\n1732\n01:25:34,523 --> 01:25:37,123\n>> We can neither confirm nor\ndeny these allegations.\n\n1733\n01:25:37,123 --> 01:25:39,290\n>> Absolutely,\nwe have no knowledge of such things.\n\n1734\n01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:40,700\nNo knowledge of such things.\n\n1735\n01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,780\nSo if we can go back to our notes\nwe had a few more items we wanted\n\n1736\n01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:46,200\nto quickly review there and touch on.\n\n1737\n01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:50,170\nI think we wanted to talk about some\nof the five steps, or not some,\n\n1738\n01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:52,990\nthe five steps rather I should say,\nin the hacking process so\n\n1739\n01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:57,070\nlet's go through this and let's just talk\nabout what the hacking process looks like.\n\n1740\n01:25:57,070 --> 01:26:00,910\nWe've talked about penetration testing and\nthis idea of pen testing in some of our\n\n1741\n01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:04,080\nearlier discussions and\nother areas in other shows.\n\n1742\n01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,165\nAnd I wanna remind you of that when\nwe talk about the hacking process,\n\n1743\n01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:10,700\ncuz effectively they are two\nsides of the same coin.\n\n1744\n01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:15,490\nBeing outside the system trying to get in,\nwhatever that means, is hacking.\n\n1745\n01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:18,250\nYou may do that for good, right?\n\n1746\n01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:19,980\nPen testing is doing it for good.\n\n1747\n01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,230\nYou may do it for evil.\n\n1748\n01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:24,750\nHacking just for the sake of hacking\nis effectively doing it for evil.\n\n1749\n01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:30,280\nThe origins of the concept of hacking\nreally come from this idea that early on\n\n1750\n01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,280\nthis was a way for people that built\nsystems to understand the weaknesses and\n\n1751\n01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,620\nfind them and then patch them.\n\n1752\n01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:37,200\nIt wasn't always seen as a negative thing,\nright?\n\n1753\n01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:43,160\nBut then hackers really turned to these\nthinks that were called crackers, right?\n\n1754\n01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:46,417\nEspecially connotations there from\nall sorts of different places and\n\n1755\n01:26:46,417 --> 01:26:47,665\nthings we could think of.\n\n1756\n01:26:47,665 --> 01:26:51,060\nBut, if you think about\nthe idea of being a cracker.\n\n1757\n01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,720\nHackers wanted to distance\nthemselves historically\n\n1758\n01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,770\nfrom this idea of being people that\nwere doing ill and being evil.\n\n1759\n01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:58,595\nSo they saw themselves as doing good.\n\n1760\n01:26:58,595 --> 01:27:02,286\nAnd so they started labeling the people\nthat broke into systems to do bad as being\n\n1761\n01:27:02,286 --> 01:27:05,811\ncrackers, cuz they were trying to break\nsystems and really get into them and\n\n1762\n01:27:05,811 --> 01:27:07,429\nunderstand what they were doing.\n\n1763\n01:27:07,429 --> 01:27:12,190\nAnd so it became this fighting\nwar in concept in vocabulary.\n\n1764\n01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:14,670\nAt the end of the day,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n1765\n01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,620\nThe idea is that we generically\nnow think of people as hackers,\n\n1766\n01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:21,390\nas being people that are typically looking\nto do ill, and people that are not looking\n\n1767\n01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:24,400\nto do ill as being penetration testers or\nethical hackers.\n\n1768\n01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,800\nWe have all these different\nways of referring to that.\n\n1769\n01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,200\nSo the hacking process has five steps\nassociated with it as you can see on\n\n1770\n01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,060\nthe screen there.\n\n1771\n01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:34,470\nWe have reconnaissance, we have scanning.\n\n1772\n01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:36,190\nWe have gaining access.\n\n1773\n01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:39,620\nWe have maintaining access and\nwe have covering your tracks.\n\n1774\n01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:44,666\nAnd so if we think quickly about these\nholistic items together as a life cycle,\n\n1775\n01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:45,210\nright?\n\n1776\n01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:49,088\nA process, reconnaissance or recon is\ngoing out and probing, using tools\n\n1777\n01:27:49,088 --> 01:27:52,845\nmaybe like Nmap or vulnerability scanners,\nOS fingerprint scanners,\n\n1778\n01:27:52,845 --> 01:27:56,598\nto be able to understand port scanners\nTo understand the lay of the land,\n\n1779\n01:27:56,598 --> 01:28:01,130\nsocial engineering may occur here, where\nwe try to figure out what's going on.\n\n1780\n01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:05,010\nWe'll bring in scanning, and certainly the\nthings I just mentioned in the recon phase\n\n1781\n01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:07,320\ncould also be used in the scanning phase.\n\n1782\n01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:11,770\nWe may be looking at websites in the recon\nphase, looking at LinkedIn profiles,\n\n1783\n01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:13,180\nFacebook information.\n\n1784\n01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:15,080\nA lot of gathering of information.\n\n1785\n01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,380\nWe go active there when we start scanning.\n\n1786\n01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:19,480\nWe then, in step three,\ntry to gain access.\n\n1787\n01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:24,180\nWe use the information gathered in steps\none and two, to start accessing websites,\n\n1788\n01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,640\nputting in passwords.\n\n1789\n01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,910\nYou know, potentially trying to get in.\n\n1790\n01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:33,100\nLaunch and execute on remote access\nTrojans, and maintain or put in,\n\n1791\n01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:37,010\nand then in step four, maintain, software\nthat is going to give us access over time.\n\n1792\n01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:40,440\nSo malware is introduced\ntypically in step three.\n\n1793\n01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,388\nAnd then we are maintaining\nthat access through the use and\n\n1794\n01:28:43,388 --> 01:28:46,670\nremote management of that\nsystem long term in step four.\n\n1795\n01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:50,170\nAnd then covering our tracks in step five,\nis where we back out of the system, and\n\n1796\n01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:52,240\ntry to remove any traces\nof having been there.\n\n1797\n01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,300\nWe wipe out log files, right?\n\n1798\n01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:58,950\nWe hide the key logger files inside\nthe text file forest that I talked about.\n\n1799\n01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:02,910\nWe may wipe out the running config on the\nrouter, as we reboot it on our way out,\n\n1800\n01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:05,090\nto prevent people from seeing what we did.\n\n1801\n01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,540\nWe talked about some of\nthese old school and\n\n1802\n01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,700\nnew school methods to be\nable to do this stuff.\n\n1803\n01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,600\nLots of ways to cover your tracks.\n\n1804\n01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,620\nCould be something as simple\nas simply going in and\n\n1805\n01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:18,120\nhaving a conversation with somebody\nto do some social engineering.\n\n1806\n01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:21,860\nAnd then after you've actually dealt with\nthat, and make sure that you have access,\n\n1807\n01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:24,470\nsimply removing notes to that\neffect from the system so\n\n1808\n01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:25,680\nnobody knows that you were there.\n\n1809\n01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,790\nIt doesn't have to be anything\nmore complicated than that.\n\n1810\n01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:31,629\nSo, just be aware of that and think about\nthat, but as we take this all together,\n\n1811\n01:29:31,629 --> 01:29:35,353\nwe're really talking about the way that\nhackers are gonna execute against our\n\n1812\n01:29:35,353 --> 01:29:38,764\nsystems, and are really then gonna\nbring the pain, as we say, right?\n\n1813\n01:29:38,764 --> 01:29:43,650\nThey're gonna try to get in and long term\ntake control and reside in our networks.\n\n1814\n01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:47,360\nAnd I often want to think about, or at\nleast I want to put it in perspective of\n\n1815\n01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:50,480\nthinking about,\nwho is in my network at any given time?\n\n1816\n01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,770\nAccess control is really very important.\n\n1817\n01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:53,680\nWe talk a lot about this.\n\n1818\n01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,670\nIt's important in the SSCP credential,\nit's important in the CISSP credential,\n\n1819\n01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:01,290\nit's important in Security+ from CompTIA,\nit's important everywhere.\n\n1820\n01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:04,140\nCan't really do security\nwithout access control and\n\n1821\n01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:08,440\nit's about the idea of understanding who's\nthere and as a result who's not there, and\n\n1822\n01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,350\nhacking is exactly that.\n\n1823\n01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:14,480\nIt's the idea of getting inside a system\nwithout anybody knowing you're there.\n\n1824\n01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,304\nSo that's really something you,\nas practitioners and professionals,\n\n1825\n01:30:17,304 --> 01:30:18,154\nhave to think about.\n\n1826\n01:30:18,154 --> 01:30:21,770\nYou know, I would challenge you just to\nthink about the mindset of the hacker and\n\n1827\n01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:24,520\nunderstand the network and\nthe world from their perspective.\n\n1828\n01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:28,940\nTheir sole goal, if they do this\nprofessionally, is to get in and\n\n1829\n01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,650\nget out and be a ghost, right?\n\n1830\n01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:34,240\nSo it's really like, Ghost Ops, right?\n\n1831\n01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:36,430\nIt's really like being a ghost operator,\nright?\n\n1832\n01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:40,200\nYou want to get in and get out,\nyou're the black suited warrior, right?\n\n1833\n01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,990\nAnd, you know, we talked about the Tao\nof security, being the security ninja.\n\n1834\n01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:45,400\nHear all these terms today.\n\n1835\n01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,960\nHackers really are not looking for\nthe limelight.\n\n1836\n01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,710\nThey are not looking to be made,\nyou know, to be seen by everybody.\n\n1837\n01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:54,350\nWe don't want to announce\nthe fact we're there.\n\n1838\n01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:58,220\nI know I did a good job when I hack\na system if nobody knows about it.\n\n1839\n01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:02,015\nIf nobody ever talks about the fact that\nsomebody broke in, I know I did my job.\n\n1840\n01:31:02,015 --> 01:31:03,710\nAnd I did it well when I'm pen testing.\n\n1841\n01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:07,250\nIf the next morning, everybody's talking\nabout the fact that they found all this\n\n1842\n01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:10,750\nstuff, and they know that somebody was\nthere, I got a problem on my hands, right?\n\n1843\n01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:14,030\nI didn't do a very good job, I was\npretty noisy, as we say in the business,\n\n1844\n01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:16,490\nas opposed to being pretty quiet.\n\n1845\n01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:19,810\nSo just be aware of that, right, as we\nthink about what hackers do and don't do,\n\n1846\n01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:21,810\nwe wanna make sure that\nwe're aware of that.\n\n1847\n01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:27,070\nRemote access, remote takeover of systems,\nmisuse of administrator tools,\n\n1848\n01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:30,490\ndenying, as we said, or\ndistributed denial of service attacks,\n\n1849\n01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:33,580\ntheft of intellectual property,\nthese are all attack types.\n\n1850\n01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:36,230\nThere's many, many categories that\nwe could be thinking about and\n\n1851\n01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:38,230\ndoing discussions on here.\n\n1852\n01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:41,680\nIndirect threats, as we talked about,\nversus direct threats, for instance.\n\n1853\n01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:44,310\nAnd just making sure we\nunderstand the nature\n\n1854\n01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:46,310\nof what the hacker brings to the table.\n\n1855\n01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:48,470\nThat's the toughest part of this job,\n\n1856\n01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:52,990\nis having to face these unstructured,\nunrecognized attacks, and\n\n1857\n01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:56,310\nthen figuring out that we actually\nhave a problem on our hands.\n\n1858\n01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:57,980\nIt's easy when we know they're coming,\n\n1859\n01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:02,850\nwe know they're knocking on the door,\nI think of the Lord of the Rings movies.\n\n1860\n01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:06,436\nYou think of, if you've seen\nthe Lord of the Rings movies,\n\n1861\n01:32:06,436 --> 01:32:10,453\nI think of them being in Gondor,\nand they're looking at the hordes\n\n1862\n01:32:10,453 --> 01:32:14,779\ncoming across the plain,\nwhen they're trying to defend themselves.\n\n1863\n01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:18,427\nAnd you see all of the orcs and all of\nthe bad guys coming and running up against\n\n1864\n01:32:18,427 --> 01:32:22,190\nthe city walls from out on the plain,\nand we know they're coming, right?\n\n1865\n01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:22,900\nNo mystery there.\n\n1866\n01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,140\nWe know we're under attack.\n\n1867\n01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:28,300\nBut when it's the stealth attack that\nwe don't see, when somebody gets in and\n\n1868\n01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:32,080\nis a bad actor, acts in bad faith,\ntricks us into accepting them,\n\n1869\n01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,280\nthat proves to be an issue.\n\n1870\n01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,280\nAnd so\nthose are the ones that really hurt.\n\n1871\n01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,470\nThe people that we thought, potentially,\n\n1872\n01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:39,320\nwere going to be allies\nturned out to be bad guys.\n\n1873\n01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:44,450\nSo think about those things, think about\nwhere that leads us to, what kind of\n\n1874\n01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:48,440\nsolutions we're opening ourselves up to as\nwe start wrapping up our discussion here.\n\n1875\n01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:52,530\nReconnaissance can take many forms, and\nthe information that you put out there\n\n1876\n01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:56,820\nis potentially the information that comes\nback to bite you at the end of the day.\n\n1877\n01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:00,370\nAll right, very good, so\nI think we've really gone through and\n\n1878\n01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:02,490\ntalked about a lot of\nthese different areas.\n\n1879\n01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:05,400\nDone some good things,\nput out a lot of good information,\n\n1880\n01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:09,080\nmaybe any closing thoughts that we\nwant to share with the nice folk?\n\n1881\n01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:12,130\n>> You know, the main thing to remember\nis that, what we've talked about,\n\n1882\n01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:15,990\nwe've really covered all the\ngeneralizations that we make around this,\n\n1883\n01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:19,930\nbut the details,\nthey are changing every single day.\n\n1884\n01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:21,900\nThere's constantly new exploits.\n\n1885\n01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,680\nNew types of viruses.\n\n1886\n01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,260\nThat's part of being\na hacker is being creative.\n\n1887\n01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,840\nComing up with new methods.\n\n1888\n01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,990\nSo, this is not something that\nyou just learn and memorize once.\n\n1889\n01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:32,710\nIt's an ongoing body of knowledge.\n\n1890\n01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:37,080\nSomething that you've continually got\nto cultivate to stay up to date on\n\n1891\n01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,070\nwhat types of attacks there are.\n\n1892\n01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:42,268\n>> And you know, just as we summarize and\nto build on that point, quick,\n\n1893\n01:33:42,268 --> 01:33:45,792\nwe think about the fact that when we talk\nabout this defense in depth concept,\n\n1894\n01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:49,454\nwe talk about the logical and the\nphysical, and the technical architectures.\n\n1895\n01:33:49,454 --> 01:33:52,538\nThe outer layer which is the WAN,\nthe middle layer, the DMZ,\n\n1896\n01:33:52,538 --> 01:33:53,800\nthe internal, the LAN.\n\n1897\n01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:57,743\nYou can attack at the network level,\nyou can attack at the information level,\n\n1898\n01:33:57,743 --> 01:34:01,926\nyou can attack at the user level, hackers\nare always looking for new and innovative\n\n1899\n01:34:01,926 --> 01:34:05,660\nways, to Don's point, to constantly\nreinvent themselves and come in.\n\n1900\n01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:06,671\nSo you wanna think about that.\n\n1901\n01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:10,591\nOne of the things that may help you just\nin closing would be to look at some of\n\n1902\n01:34:10,591 --> 01:34:12,869\nthe current standards that are out there,\n\n1903\n01:34:12,869 --> 01:34:16,795\nwe've talked about ISO standards\nbefore and the ISO 27,000 series\n\n1904\n01:34:16,795 --> 01:34:21,350\nin particular deals with information\nsecurity management and best practices.\n\n1905\n01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:28,140\nAnd so looking at ISO 27,001 and\n27,002 in particular, security or\n\n1906\n01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:32,180\nsystem engineering best practices, would\nreally be a good starting point for you.\n\n1907\n01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:35,990\nSome of the Niss documentation that we've\nalso mentioned, the special publications\n\n1908\n01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:40,210\non network architecture and network\nmanagement will be valuable here as well.\n\n1909\n01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:44,155\nAgain from a US centric perspective, but\nstill, best practices are just that.\n\n1910\n01:34:45,235 --> 01:34:48,565\nThey are best practices, and just because\nthey come from one area of the world\n\n1911\n01:34:48,565 --> 01:34:50,455\ndoesn't mean they're not\nvaluable in other areas.\n\n1912\n01:34:50,455 --> 01:34:52,445\nIt just means we have to localize them,\nand\n\n1913\n01:34:52,445 --> 01:34:56,250\nmake use of them in a contextually\nrelevant and culturally friendly way.\n\n1914\n01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,450\nSo just be aware of that as well.\n\n1915\n01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:58,750\nAll right, very good.\n\n1916\n01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:01,580\nSo, do we have any questions or\nanything we want to address from the chat?\n\n1917\n01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:02,460\nI wasn't paying attention.\n\n1918\n01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,530\nI didn't see if there was anything.\n\n1919\n01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:05,810\n>> I was answering one real quick here.\n\n1920\n01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:08,480\nI guess I could answer it out loud.\n\n1921\n01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,890\nMSG had mentioned how he didn't understand\nwhy Microsoft was forcing that IE\n\n1922\n01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:15,900\nautomatic upgrade by default.\n\n1923\n01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,560\n>> Oh!\n>> My comment was going to be,\n\n1924\n01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,650\nI know why they did it.\n\n1925\n01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:21,598\nThey did it because of all the bad\npress they were getting over IE6.\n\n1926\n01:35:21,598 --> 01:35:25,412\nSo many users still running\nInternet Explorer 6 out there,\n\n1927\n01:35:25,412 --> 01:35:28,940\neven though it's,\nwhen did IE6 come out, 2001?\n\n1928\n01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:31,770\nYou're talking about a 13 year old\nbrowser, people are still running it.\n\n1929\n01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:35,436\nSo, Microsoft said, screw it,\nwe're gonna make it the default that if\n\n1930\n01:35:35,436 --> 01:35:38,758\nyou're a home user,\nthat it'll just automatically update IE.\n\n1931\n01:35:38,758 --> 01:35:42,072\nCuz people would just decline the update,\nbut in the business world, like Adam,\n\n1932\n01:35:42,072 --> 01:35:44,730\nyou said this earlier in the show,\nit can really cause problems.\n\n1933\n01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:47,500\nYou might have a line of business\napplications or whatever that\n\n1934\n01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:53,540\nare requiring IE 9, and\ndon't support IE 10 yet, or whatever.\n\n1935\n01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:58,110\nAnd so in those cases,\nwhat I was typing was, if you deploy\n\n1936\n01:35:58,110 --> 01:36:02,910\nWSUS with a group policy object, you can\noverride those settings inside of IE.\n\n1937\n01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:04,970\nSo you can stop that update.\n\n1938\n01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:06,330\nYou can actually say,\n\n1939\n01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:11,110\ndon't allow my machines to update to\nIE11 when IE11 releases, or whatever.\n\n1940\n01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:14,610\nSo you do have that control,\nit's just not in the default.\n\n1941\n01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:18,675\nAnd it is specifically a response\nto the bad press they got.\n\n1942\n01:36:18,675 --> 01:36:23,361\nBecause there were literally millions\nof home users still running IE6 in\n\n1943\n01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,199\nWindows XP.\n\n1944\n01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:26,845\nAnd that's a big deal for them.\n\n1945\n01:36:26,845 --> 01:36:27,715\n>> Very true.\nVery true.\n\n1946\n01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:28,525\nIt's a good question.\n\n1947\n01:36:28,525 --> 01:36:31,440\nThank you for for bringing that up and\nfor asking us to clarify.\n\n1948\n01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,960\nAll right, so I think we're done here,\nour work is done.\n\n1949\n01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:36,390\n>> All right, so let's wrap it up here,\nand let me just remind you guys,\n\n1950\n01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:38,470\nif you have questions,\nand we love questions.\n\n1951\n01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:41,830\nAnd so live during the show,\nyou can do just like MSG there,\n\n1952\n01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:44,660\nand type right into the chat\nbox underneath the video.\n\n1953\n01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:46,690\nYou post your questions, we answer them.\n\n1954\n01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:50,160\nI try and answer during the show, but I've\nbeen doing a lot of screen sharing this\n\n1955\n01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:53,130\nepisode so I didn't get to answer\na bunch of them during the show,\n\n1956\n01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:54,480\nbut so we answer them that way.\n\n1957\n01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,485\nAlso if you are watching this recorded,\nyou can use our Q & A system.\n\n1958\n01:36:58,485 --> 01:37:02,800\nAt the top of every ITPro.TV page\nyou'll see a link that says Q & A.\n\n1959\n01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,840\nClick on that,\npost your questions in there.\n\n1960\n01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,160\nI'm not the only one that monitors.\n\n1961\n01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,800\nThe other hosts, and\nsome of our other guys here monitor, too.\n\n1962\n01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:09,620\nAnd the other users.\n\n1963\n01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:13,370\nThere's a wealth of information out\nthere for you guys to take advantage of.\n\n1964\n01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:16,850\nI think that's about all I got, so\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1965\n01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:18,510\n>> Good.\n>> Signing off for IT ProTV,\n\n1966\n01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:19,980\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n1967\n01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:20,970\n>> I'm Adam
