Doing fantastic, Peter, and you?\n\n10\n00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.420\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.040\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n12\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.410\n&gt;&gt; John tell us a little bit\nabout yourself to get us started.\n\n13\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.290\n&gt;&gt; More than 20 years as a leadership and\nstrategy, and business trainer,\n\n14\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.460\nand consultant.\n\n15\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.940\nI've written five books, and\nthis is what I've built my career around,\n\n16\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.960\nis trying to help people\nimprove in business.\n\n17\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.600\nFantastic, all right, so we're talking\nabout launching successful teams.\n\n18\n00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.740\nThere are so many places to start,\nwhere do we start on this?\n\n19\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.060\n&gt;&gt; Well, I like to start with what's a\npretty famous model done by Bruce Tuckman\n\n20\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.945\nabout the five stages of teams.\n\n21\n00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:56.555\nAnd that's forming, storming,\nnorming, performing, and\n\n22\n00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.910\nthen I like to say adjoining,\nbut it should be adjourning.\n\n23\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.461\n[LAUGH] Or transforming,\nyou gotta make them all rhyme.\n\n24\n00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:03.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gotta work, it's a song.\n\n25\n00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:04.625\n&gt;&gt; It still would have them all.\n\n26\n00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.615\nSo this first one's gonna\nbe around the forming.\n\n27\n00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:10.655\nAnd this is launching the team,\ngetting the team together,\n\n28\n00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:15.280\nestablishing the team and making sure\nthat we start on the right foot.\n\n29\n00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.730\nAnd the first question you want to ask\nyourself is do we even need a team?\n\n30\n00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.420\nSo the key idea there is,\nwould a workgroup do fine?\n\n31\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.320\nCould we do individual people?\n\n32\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.360\nAnd the way you handle that is you go to\nthe sponsor, who is asking for the team?\n\n33\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.230\nYou sit down and clarify, what are the\ntasks we want, what's the outcome we want,\n\n34\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.930\nwhat's the purpose of the team?\n\n35\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.860\nWhat are you trying to achieve here?\n\n36\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.240\nAnd deciding where the sponsor,\nif building a high performance team\n\n37\n00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.910\nis actually what is necessary\nto accomplish the task.\n\n38\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.110\n&gt;&gt; John, what is the difference between,\nyou mentioned a work group and a team,\n\n39\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.460\nwhat's the difference there?\n\n40\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.950\n&gt;&gt; A work group would be a group of\nindividuals that basically are doing\n\n41\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.150\ntheir projects and their tasks.\n\n42\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.320\nHanding them off to each other to\nfinish a project independently.\n\n43\n00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.120\nThere's really sort of\nthree levels of teams.\n\n44\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.900\nThere's independent teams,\ninterdependent teams, and dependent teams.\n\n45\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.350\nOn an independent team, and\nI like to use sports analogies for\n\n46\n00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.670\nthis, sort of like a golf team.\n\n47\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.970\nAnd this would be a almost close\nto a workgroup where you've got\n\n48\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.570\neach person individually\ndoing their stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.980\nOn a golf team it's me versus the course.\n\n50\n00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.890\nNo one else can prep for me.\n\n51\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.010\nNo one else can drive for me.\n\n52\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.050\nThey can give me advice, but\nI'm the only one responsible for\n\n53\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.860\nmy own score on the golf course.\n\n54\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.370\nOur team can win, and\nwe've got a team product, but\n\n55\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.690\nI can also individually do very well.\n\n56\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.130\nThen you have whats called\nan interdependent team.\n\n57\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.190\nWhere we've got folks that\nare handling things off, and\n\n58\n00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.740\nam doing some work on my own, and\nsome of it actually as a team.\n\n59\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.600\nThis is more of a hybrid\nfrom a work group coming up.\n\n60\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.590\nA good analogy for that,\nwould be a baseball team.\n\n61\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.980\nWhen am, I get to play banding\nno body else can help me.\n\n62\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.820\nThey can't hit the ball for\nme,they can't watch the pitch for me.\n\n63\n00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.370\nAgain, the coach can give me advice, but\n\n64\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.720\nam completely on my own independent\nof that part of the teamwork.\n\n65\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.100\nThen you've got when you're out in\nthe field, you're part of the entire team.\n\n66\n00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.520\nYou're interdependent.\n\n67\n00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.530\nIf somebody hits a pot fly and\nit flies by and I watch it and lands it.\n\n68\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.310\nI don't pick it up and throw it back in,\nthe team's probably not gonna win.\n\n69\n00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.620\nSo that's a different type of team,\nan interdependent team.\n\n70\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.450\nAnd finally, and this is really where\nyou go to high performance teams and\n\n71\n00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.590\nthe normal definition of a team which\nis sort of like a football team or\n\n72\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.590\na basketball team where\nit's fully dependent.\n\n73\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.520\nThat if one of the linemen doesn't block,\nthe quarterback gets sacked.\n\n74\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.040\nIf one of the people decides they\ndon't wanna pass the basketball,\n\n75\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.260\nhard to win the game.\n\n76\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.235\nMy favorite example for\nthis is like an Olympic four by four team.\n\n77\n00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.135\nIf one of the folks decides\nthey're not going to run,\n\n78\n00:03:36.135 --> 00:03:37.830\nyou're not getting a gold metal.\n\n79\n00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.068\nSo step one is clearly understanding,\nwhat kind of a team do we need.\n\n80\n00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:43.720\nWould a workgroup be fine?\n\n81\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.210\nDo we even need to put a team together?\n\n82\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.680\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good all right, and\nI got you off task a little bit.\n\n83\n00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.597\nSo let's go back to, what was the first\nstep in the Bruce Tuckman model?\n\n84\n00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:52.140\nIt's forming.\n\n85\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.280\n&gt;&gt; It's forming.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n86\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.680\n&gt;&gt; So at this stage we're just\nputting the team together.\n\n87\n00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.530\nAnother thing to look at is\nhow will the team operate?\n\n88\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.080\nIs it gonna be a departmental team?\n\n89\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.280\nIs it by function?\n\n90\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.190\nIs it cross functional?\n\n91\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.960\nIs it, maybe, interdepartmental or\nintercorporate?\n\n92\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.030\nMaybe, it's different parts of\nthe company or different companies or\n\n93\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.350\nworking with vendors.\n\n94\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.470\nSo, once you establish,\n\n95\n00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.100\nall right we do need to build a team,\nis it gonna be inside one division?\n\n96\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.349\nIs it gonna be across divisions or\nacross companies?\n\n97\n00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay and so after we're done\nforming the team, you said storming.\n\n98\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.810\nI'm assuming brainstorming?\n\n99\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.420\n&gt;&gt; No, storming is when we come together\nand we're gonna be covering a little bit\n\n100\n00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.930\nlater in this, is we come together and\nwe start working together and\n\n101\n00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.690\nthe stormy part is when people\nare starting to have some friction.\n\n102\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.640\nThey don't know each other well,\nthey haven't built up a level of trust.\n\n103\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.420\nSo it's the team sorta fighting through,\nand\n\n104\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.280\nstorming through,\ncreating a more cohesive group.\n\n105\n00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.560\nWhich, the next level is then\nthey start performing well, and\n\n106\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.910\ngetting better and better at what they do.\n\n107\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay and so I'm not gonna try to\nguess now on what norming means,\n\n108\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.910\nbut, help us out here.\n\n109\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, the norming is really the stage\nwhere that now we've created a charter,\n\n110\n00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.680\nwe've got everybody working together\nin groups, we know each other well.\n\n111\n00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.070\nAnd that is the foundation of being\nable to perform well together as a team,\n\n112\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.580\nis having the norms across the entire\ngroups, shared meaning, shared values,\n\n113\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.740\na shared purpose that gets\neveryone on the team aligned and\n\n114\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.360\nable to deliver what's necessary.\n\n115\n00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.499\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nthen finally you said, adjourning,\n\n116\n00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:20.650\nadjourning gotta make it rhyme.\n\n117\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.462\nSo what do we mean there?\n\n118\n00:05:21.462 --> 00:05:24.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, adjourning or actually\nanother word for it is transforming.\n\n119\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.360\nThere's two ways here.\n\n120\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.145\nThe team could transform,\ntransforming, it does rhyme.\n\n121\n00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:31.640\n[LAUGH] The team could transform\nto another team project and\n\n122\n00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.980\nkeep the team together.\n\n123\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.920\nBut often times what happens is\na team is broken up, it's adjourned.\n\n124\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.740\nThey disperse and then they are put on\nseparate teams or put on new teams.\n\n125\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, it sounds like at the\nbeginning when we're forming that team and\n\n126\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.050\nfiguring out what kind of team we're gonna\nbuild and what that charter is and what\n\n127\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.960\nthe norms are, we need to understand why\nthe team was created on the first place.\n\n128\n00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.650\nSo, that's going back to whoever said to,\nto build the team and\n\n129\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.750\nfiguring that out or?\n\n130\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, at this stage which\none of you take some time to really\n\n131\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.110\nwork with the sponsor, to really clarify\nwhat's the purpose of this team.\n\n132\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.610\nWhat's the outcome we want?\n\n133\n00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.630\nHow will it be measured?\n\n134\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.460\nIn other way I like to say is\nwhat does success look like?\n\n135\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.810\nIf this team operates perfectly and\ndelivers exactly what you want,\n\n136\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.490\nhow do we measure that, how will we\nknow that we've been successful?\n\n137\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Basically the same as any other\n\n138\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.790\nbusiness practice your gonna have where\nyou want to have measurable goals and\n\n139\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.280\nbe able to look back and\nsay did we hit these or not.\n\n140\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.200\nNot just kinda,\nyeah I think it kinda went well.\n\n141\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and part of that is\nis once you've got that and\n\n142\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.640\nyou're gonna be the team leader or\nyou're putting the team together,\n\n143\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.840\nis making sure you have the resources,\nthe access to people, the authority.\n\n144\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.810\nSo that once you've figured out\nwhat the purpose is where we going,\n\n145\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.030\nwhat are trying to achieve, making\nsure you have everything necessary for\n\n146\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.700\nyou to be successful, leading that team\nand taking them to the next level.\n\n147\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.600\n&gt;&gt; Great, I know we're in kind of\na position now where in a lot of companies\n\n148\n00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.220\nwhere people are spread out either in\ndifferent rooms in the same building, or\n\n149\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.960\neven different buildings, or\nyou've got people working from home.\n\n150\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.410\nWhat kind of challenges does that create\nwhen putting a team together that\n\n151\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.200\nmight not be all in\nthe same actual geography?\n\n152\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the biggest challenges,\nespecially to do now with virtual teams is\n\n153\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.920\ncreating a level of trust that's necessary\nto create a true high performance team.\n\n154\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.990\nYou can have teams that\nare located together,\n\n155\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.330\ncolocated at different buildings or\ndifferent groups, or completely virtual.\n\n156\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.610\nAnd what you wanna try to do is create,\nagain that's why that norming is so\n\n157\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.580\nimportant, creating shared values,\na shared system, clear goals,\n\n158\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.180\na clear purpose so\nthat everyone is in line working together.\n\n159\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.660\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthis in later sections, but\n\n160\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.550\nit's absolutely essential to create\nsome level of bond of trust.\n\n161\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.264\nSo that, even though we're in different\nlocations, we may not see each other that\n\n162\n00:07:49.264 --> 00:07:52.235\noften, we're still operating as\na group that trusts each other,\n\n163\n00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:53.421\nthat speaks with candor.\n\n164\n00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.366\nThat has lots of open communication,\n\n165\n00:07:55.366 --> 00:07:59.685\nthat has high levels of accountability\nto allow us to be successful as a team.\n\n166\n00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:03.145\n&gt;&gt; And that kinda comes back to\nthe norming a little bit to say Here's how\n\n167\n00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:04.409\nthis team is gonna work.\n\n168\n00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:06.383\nIt's unique for\neach kind of team you're building.\n\n169\n00:08:06.383 --> 00:08:08.431\nBut here's what we expect of you, and\n\n170\n00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:11.253\nhere's how we are holding\neach other accountable.\n\n171\n00:08:11.253 --> 00:08:12.332\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n172\n00:08:12.332 --> 00:08:15.542\nAnd it's those shared values,\nthat foundation,\n\n173\n00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:18.081\nthat keeps everybody on the same page and\n\n174\n00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:22.798\nallows you to hold people accountable\nwhen they violate one of this norms.\n\n175\n00:08:22.798 --> 00:08:26.030\nIf they violet the value of showing up\non time, turning their work in on time.\n\n176\n00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.833\nNot getting aggressive with\none of the other team members.\n\n177\n00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:34.209\nAnd we'll go into a lot more depth\non that, of figuring out as a team,\n\n178\n00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:35.850\nhow do we wanna treat each other.\n\n179\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.976\nBut before even that, we gotta back up and\ntalk about who do we want on the team?\n\n180\n00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:44.867\nAnd one of the exercises I use a lot with\nthe classes I teach is, let's create\n\n181\n00:08:44.867 --> 00:08:49.740\na model for this organization,\nthis group of an ideal team member.\n\n182\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.240\nSo for a second,\nI wanna ask you a question.\n\n183\n00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Is when you think about someone you'd\n\n184\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.330\nlove to bring on your team.\n\n185\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.730\nSomeone that's really, really good.\n\n186\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.050\nSomeone that's what I would\ncall an ideal team member.\n\n187\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.560\nWhat are four or\n\n188\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.040\nfive of the characteristics you'd look for\nin a perfect team member?\n\n189\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.860\n&gt;&gt; Well I think communication\nis certainly a big one.\n\n190\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.670\nWhen you're working with a team, it's very\ndifferent than working just by yourself.\n\n191\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.770\nYou've gotta be able to\ntalk with one another.\n\n192\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.680\nIt's kind of,\nI'm not sure the right way to say it.\n\n193\n00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.630\nBut without kind of sounding silly here.\n\n194\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.800\nBut being a team player,\nactually sharing ideas and\n\n195\n00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.620\nnot saying,\nI wanna take all the credit for this.\n\n196\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.000\nAnd I wanna actually work on the success\nof the team as opposed to just myself.\n\n197\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.340\nThose would be a couple good ones.\n\n198\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.583\nJust beyond that I think, trust,\nto trust that someone else is\n\n199\n00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:43.928\ngoing to do their part and so\nI don't have to worry about them.\n\n200\n00:09:43.928 --> 00:09:44.748\n&gt;&gt; Cool, well those are all good.\n\n201\n00:09:44.748 --> 00:09:48.841\nAnd this is a question I've asked hundreds\nof companies, lots of people, and\n\n202\n00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:52.066\nI actually was working with\na large organization last week and\n\n203\n00:09:52.066 --> 00:09:53.630\nwent through this with them.\n\n204\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.070\nSo I brought the actual list they created.\n\n205\n00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.550\nAnd we talked about two things.\n\n206\n00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.230\nI figured there's an interesting idea\nhere, and you said it sort of around,\n\n207\n00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.620\nbe a good team player.\n\n208\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.540\nWe also added in, what does it take to\nbe a great follower or team player?\n\n209\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.770\nNot just a team member but\nalso a great follower of the team leader.\n\n210\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.320\nSo it's a long list and I'm gonna go\nthrough and hit a couple of ideas.\n\n211\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.670\nNumber one, absolutely most important.\n\n212\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.460\nAnd this shows up in research studies\non leadership teamwork, everything,\n\n213\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.560\nis honesty, integrity,\ntell the truth all the time, period.\n\n214\n00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.910\nIf you're not honest there's no way\nanyone else on the team will trust you.\n\n215\n00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.040\nIf they don't trust you,\nyou're not a team member.\n\n216\n00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.520\nHigh energy, positive attitude,\npassion, enthusiasm, commitment,\n\n217\n00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.830\nbeing excited about being on the team.\n\n218\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.840\nAnother key one, critical,\nhighly competent.\n\n219\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.490\nYou gotta be exceedingly\ngood at what you do,\n\n220\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.230\nthere's sort of a combination\nhere of competence and concern.\n\n221\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.820\nWhen you're on the team, to build trust,\n\n222\n00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.570\npeople wanna see that you're extremely\ngood at what you do, highly competent, and\n\n223\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.130\nyou care about the team,\nyou're committed at the team.\n\n224\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.690\nHigh competence, high concern, and\nthe phrase I use there always is,\n\n225\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.540\nI'm good at what I do, and\nI do it because I care about you.\n\n226\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.380\nAnother one you almost said,\nis loyal and dependable.\n\n227\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.750\nI want someone who I can trust\non the team, who's reliable, and\n\n228\n00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.540\nwill get their work done.\n\n229\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.040\nAnother big element, absolutely,\n\n230\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.500\nand it's one of the modules we'll cover\nhere, is being a fantastic communicator.\n\n231\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.960\nAnd mostly that's about being curious,\nasking great questions, being an intense\n\n232\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.900\nlistener, and understanding when\nto offer ideas and information.\n\n233\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.670\nA couple of other ideas,\njust wanna read them here.\n\n234\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.090\nFlexible, they have an ownership\nmentality, high level of engagement.\n\n235\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.850\nThey know their role on the team,\nthey respect the leader, they're loyal,\n\n236\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.950\nhave patience, great team player,\nproactive, analytical and\n\n237\n00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.520\nthoughtful, strong work ethic, a doer.\n\n238\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.080\nAnd the reason I take the time\nto read that list is,\n\n239\n00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.490\nwhat I'm gonna challenge you to do\nis sit down and think about that.\n\n240\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:49.580\nAs you go to build a team and launch a\nteam, you need to sorta create a model of,\n\n241\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.470\nwhat would the best\nperson on this team be?\n\n242\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.720\nIf I could pick anyone in the\norganization, out of the organization, and\n\n243\n00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.170\nbring someone on this team.\n\n244\n00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.530\nWhat are the elements I would look for\nin an ideal team member?\n\n245\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.490\n&gt;&gt; So that list that you just shared.\n\n246\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.800\nYou mentioned it's for\na specific application.\n\n247\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.670\nThose seem like kind of\nuniversal things though.\n\n248\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:11.760\nAre there times when some of those traits\nwouldn't be appropriate on a team?\n\n249\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Well not really inappropriate, but\nsome of those are highly specialized.\n\n250\n00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.810\nLike competence, you're gonna look for\n\n251\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.640\nsomeone that has a specific type of\ncompetence, a level of competence.\n\n252\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.540\nSometimes you want people with experience.\n\n253\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.957\nSometimes it's great to have people that\ndon't have experience with what you're\n\n254\n00:12:27.957 --> 00:12:31.177\ndoing, cuz they'll be innovative and\ncreative, and bring new ideas because\n\n255\n00:12:31.177 --> 00:12:34.274\nthey're not trapped in the paradigm\nof having worked in that area before.\n\n256\n00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:36.002\nSo yes, there are times that\nyou wanna change it up.\n\n257\n00:12:36.002 --> 00:12:38.994\nBut trust, integrity,\nhonesty, team player,\n\n258\n00:12:38.994 --> 00:12:44.492\ncommunication, passionate, committed,\nyou want that on every single team.\n\n259\n00:12:44.492 --> 00:12:47.540\n&gt;&gt; All right John so now we've put\ntogether that list of good attributes of\n\n260\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.380\na team member, what do we do with it?\n\n261\n00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.900\n&gt;&gt; Here's a couple different suggestions,\nand\n\n262\n00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.860\nthere's different ways\nyou're forming your teams.\n\n263\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.760\nSometimes you're going external\nto bring somebody in on a team.\n\n264\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.856\nYou're gonna be hiring them.\n\n265\n00:12:57.856 --> 00:12:59.215\nOr you'll be choosing internally.\n\n266\n00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:04.050\nAnd other times, your team members are\ngiven to you, you don't get to pick them.\n\n267\n00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.290\nSo let's talk about the first two.\n\n268\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.260\nWhat I would use this model for\nis to create it and\n\n269\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.810\nthen write it down and then prioritize it.\n\n270\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.720\nHere's the A skills that\nthis person has to have.\n\n271\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.204\nIf they don't have these skills, these\ncompetencies, this sort of a committment,\n\n272\n00:13:19.204 --> 00:13:22.085\npassion, I don't want them\non my team no matter what.\n\n273\n00:13:22.085 --> 00:13:25.739\nThen you'd have maybe B level,\nnice to have, this is important.\n\n274\n00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:27.800\nIt would add a lot of value,\nand then C, nice.\n\n275\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.150\nGreat, they speak five languages,\nthat's interesting.\n\n276\n00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.270\nBut this is an American team, or\nwe're all gonna speak English.\n\n277\n00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.130\nOnce you've created that, write it down.\n\n278\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.070\nUse that as a template for\nhiring either externally or internally.\n\n279\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.830\nAnd the reason you wanna\ndo it before that is so\n\n280\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.270\nyou've got no emotion involved when\nyou go to pick the team member.\n\n281\n00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.500\nSometimes they're folks you like,\nyou've known them for a while,\n\n282\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.740\nyou've got a friendship.\n\n283\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.560\nAnd it might not meet all the criteria but\n\n284\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.750\nyou think they'll be\npretty good on the team.\n\n285\n00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.850\nEvery now and then you can use intuition,\nbut I strongly recommend that if\n\n286\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.190\nthey don't have those A criteria, if they\ndon't meet the ideal team member model,\n\n287\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.470\nthe essentials, no matter how\nnice they are, or sweet, or kind,\n\n288\n00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.500\nor loving, you don't put them on the team.\n\n289\n00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.810\n&gt;&gt; So to clarify those A level skills,\nthey can be things like attributes,\n\n290\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.110\nlike trust or certain behaviors.\n\n291\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.630\nBut they could also be\nspecific competencies.\n\n292\n00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.120\nSo if you're putting together\na programming team and\n\n293\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.518\nsay I need someone that knows JavaScript.\n\n294\n00:14:20.518 --> 00:14:22.940\nThat's an A level skill as well?\n\n295\n00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.080\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, Peter.\n\n296\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.790\nIs I'm gonna look at skills that Java,\nthey've got experience,\n\n297\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.520\nthey've done a bunch of coding,\nthey know these sort of things.\n\n298\n00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.280\nSo I wanna create a list there of\nthey've got maybe leadership experience.\n\n299\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.470\nThey've worked on teams before.\n\n300\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.520\nThey've had more than five\nyears in the industry.\n\n301\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.810\nThey've worked on a project of\nover x millions of dollars.\n\n302\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.660\nSo that I've got someone that when they\nwalk on the team they've done it before,\n\n303\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.800\nthey know what they're doing.\n\n304\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.520\nAnd I mentioned earlier, maybe I\nwant somebody that doesn't have that\n\n305\n00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.610\nexperience, but\nthey're highly creative, innovative.\n\n306\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.800\nThey've done something\nthat would be adjacent and\n\n307\n00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.400\nknow a little bit about the topic.\n\n308\n00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.670\nJust enough that they\ncould bring in new ideas.\n\n309\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.925\nSo what you wanna do is create,\nfor this specific team,\n\n310\n00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:06.890\nthey have to have all of\nthese A level things.\n\n311\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.560\nThe B is great and the C is nice,\nbut it doesn't add any extra value.\n\n312\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.455\n&gt;&gt; So I think that all sounds great but\nit sounds a little bit a perfect world.\n\n313\n00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:17.920\nAnd I know a lot of cases out there,\nyou're told who your team is.\n\n314\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.841\nAnd It might include the boss's nephew.\n\n315\n00:15:19.841 --> 00:15:21.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who maybe has some C skills.\n\n316\n00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:24.748\nSo what do you do when\nyou're given a team,\n\n317\n00:15:24.748 --> 00:15:29.220\nand kinda forced upon you and\nyou have to put it together?\n\n318\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Great question, and\none that a lot of people run into.\n\n319\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.410\nA tool I've developed years ago\nis what I call a competency grid.\n\n320\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.640\nAnd what you do is ask each\none of the team members,\n\n321\n00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.700\nput all the team members down.\n\n322\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.713\nAnd you put all the different\nskills across the top.\n\n323\n00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:45.568\nAs you said, maybe Java or\nI have leadership as I said.\n\n324\n00:15:45.568 --> 00:15:47.540\nOr I've got five years experience.\n\n325\n00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.070\nOr I know a lot about innovation,\nbrainstorming.\n\n326\n00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.350\nI've got marketing background.\n\n327\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.490\nWhatever it might be.\n\n328\n00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.312\nEvery sort of skill that you would\nwant that team member to have.\n\n329\n00:15:57.312 --> 00:16:01.456\nThen you have them rate themselves,\nself-evaluate on a scale of one to ten at\n\n330\n00:16:01.456 --> 00:16:04.410\nhow good they feel they are at\neach one of those skills.\n\n331\n00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.509\nAnd this allows you to create a matrix on\nthe team of, if you really want to, and\n\n332\n00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:12.675\nthe team knew each other well, later on\nyou could have them evaluate the other,\n\n333\n00:16:12.675 --> 00:16:15.222\nsorta do it 360, but\nthis is a good way to start\n\n334\n00:16:15.222 --> 00:16:18.331\nto allow people to tell you\nwhere they think they're good,\n\n335\n00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:21.688\nwhere their skills lie,\nwhere they're most comfortable, and\n\n336\n00:16:21.688 --> 00:16:25.209\nthat helps you build them and\nput them in the right part of the team.\n\n337\n00:16:25.209 --> 00:16:29.117\n&gt;&gt; So we've been talking a lot about\nthe team members themselves, but\n\n338\n00:16:29.117 --> 00:16:33.096\nwhat about the team leader as well\nin terms of their accountability,\n\n339\n00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:35.993\nso there's expectations there as well,\nright?\n\n340\n00:16:35.993 --> 00:16:39.600\nI need to give you the tools\nyou need to do this job, or\n\n341\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.531\nhelp remove roadblocks that are gonna\nprevent you from doing your job.\n\n342\n00:16:44.531 --> 00:16:48.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the role of the team leader,\nand here's an interesting point is that\n\n343\n00:16:48.755 --> 00:16:53.377\ncan sometimes shift, you've always got\none person that's fully accountable for\n\n344\n00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:56.810\nthe team, whoever the sponsor\nnamed as the full team leader,\n\n345\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.168\nthey're the ones that have to make sure\nthe team has the resources, the time,\n\n346\n00:17:01.168 --> 00:17:06.022\nthe budget, the people, the equipment,\nall the things necessary to be successful.\n\n347\n00:17:06.022 --> 00:17:08.755\nHandle the bureaucracy,\nget rid of the red tape,\n\n348\n00:17:08.755 --> 00:17:12.008\ngo talk to seek other sponsors\nwithin the organization, so\n\n349\n00:17:12.008 --> 00:17:15.196\nthe leader plays a big role in\nputting out the red carpet for\n\n350\n00:17:15.196 --> 00:17:19.386\ntheir team and making sure they have\neverything they need to be successful.\n\n351\n00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:22.157\nThe leader also has enough maturity and\n\n352\n00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:27.121\nconfidence to ask other people to\nlead the teams at different points.\n\n353\n00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:30.372\nSo if you've got an area of expertise\nthat's not mine, and I'm the leader,\n\n354\n00:17:30.372 --> 00:17:33.023\nI'm gonna shift leadership on\nthat part of the project to you,\n\n355\n00:17:33.023 --> 00:17:36.523\nI still take accountability for the whole\nteam, and I'm still in charge of getting\n\n356\n00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:39.774\nall the resources for them, but I'm gonna\nlet you run this part of the project\n\n357\n00:17:39.774 --> 00:17:43.058\nbecause you know a lot more about it,\nthat's why I asked you to be on the team.\n\n358\n00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:46.632\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great leader, too, knowing\nwhat you don't know and relying on those\n\n359\n00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.711\npeople, and that goes back to that\ntrust and teamwork we talked about.\n\n360\n00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:54.163\nAll right, so now that we've figured out\nwhat kind of thing we need to create,\n\n361\n00:17:54.163 --> 00:17:56.861\nhow we need to create it,\nand who is on the team,\n\n362\n00:17:56.861 --> 00:18:01.381\nwe have that first meeting when we get\neveryone in the room, what do we do there,\n\n363\n00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:05.045\ntalking expectations and roles,\nand how does that process go?\n\n364\n00:18:05.045 --> 00:18:08.734\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna go into this in\na little bit more depth later on, but\n\n365\n00:18:08.734 --> 00:18:12.057\nat that first meeting when you\nbrought everybody together, and\n\n366\n00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:15.809\nthis is really the first step of\nforming the team, I've got the people,\n\n367\n00:18:15.809 --> 00:18:19.993\nI'm bringing them together, the leader\nneeds to set some overall expectations\n\n368\n00:18:19.993 --> 00:18:24.488\nabout accountability, about work product,\nabout communication, all those sort of\n\n369\n00:18:24.488 --> 00:18:28.779\nthings about how the team will be formed\nand what the leader's expectations are.\n\n370\n00:18:28.779 --> 00:18:32.843\nAnd they also need to clarify with\neverybody what the purpose of the team is,\n\n371\n00:18:32.843 --> 00:18:36.971\nwhere they're going, what success looks\nlike, and get full commitment and\n\n372\n00:18:36.971 --> 00:18:39.068\nalignment from everybody on the team,\n\n373\n00:18:39.068 --> 00:18:43.221\nthat they understand the general\nresponsibilities and accountabilities.\n\n374\n00:18:43.221 --> 00:18:46.708\nThey understand where they're going,\nwhat the purpose is, what the goals are,\n\n375\n00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:49.790\nwhat the outcome looks like,\nthey feel comfortable they can add value,\n\n376\n00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.912\nthey believe they've got the resources,\ntime,\n\n377\n00:18:51.912 --> 00:18:54.721\nand things necessary that have\nbeen given to them by the sponsor.\n\n378\n00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:58.256\nAnd they looked at the leader of the team,\nas they begin to form the team, and say,\n\n379\n00:18:58.256 --> 00:19:01.637\nI'm 100% committed, I believe in this\nteam, I believe in these people,\n\n380\n00:19:01.637 --> 00:19:03.453\nI'm ready to get started on the project.\n\n381\n00:19:03.453 --> 00:19:07.715\n&gt;&gt; So when we're talking about\naccountability and goals, we're maybe\n\n382\n00:19:07.715 --> 00:19:12.556\nlooking at a project as a whole, so\nlet's say we're building a new mobile app,\n\n383\n00:19:12.556 --> 00:19:16.959\nthe success at the end is, did we build\nthis app, does it do what we said it\n\n384\n00:19:16.959 --> 00:19:21.901\nshould do, but should we be looking at\nthose things on a more incremental level?\n\n385\n00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:26.740\nSo when we're saying, here's our goals and\nthe expectations for you as a member of\n\n386\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.888\nthe team, John, it's not just the big\npicture looking at the end, but\n\n387\n00:19:30.888 --> 00:19:34.213\nit's here's what you're\ngonna accomplish this week,\n\n388\n00:19:34.213 --> 00:19:37.428\nhere's how we're gonna set\nup that accountability.\n\n389\n00:19:37.428 --> 00:19:42.118\nYeah, that's gonna be another one of\nthe modules in this is what are the roles,\n\n390\n00:19:42.118 --> 00:19:46.808\ngoals and accountabilities on a team, but\nwe do want to be able to break it down,\n\n391\n00:19:46.808 --> 00:19:50.098\nthe thing that I think is\ncritical with a team, though,\n\n392\n00:19:50.098 --> 00:19:54.091\nis to allow the team to have some sort\nof a say in how all that is built.\n\n393\n00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:57.749\nMany teams that are dysfunctional fail\nbecause someone gives them a goal,\n\n394\n00:19:57.749 --> 00:20:01.580\ngives them a direction, gives them\na purpose, tells them exactly what to do,\n\n395\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.178\nwhat their budget is, what their\ntimeline is, they have no say in it and,\n\n396\n00:20:05.178 --> 00:20:08.894\nthe phrase I always like to say is that\nif you don't have a say in the outcome,\n\n397\n00:20:08.894 --> 00:20:10.849\nyou don't have a stake in the outcome.\n\n398\n00:20:10.849 --> 00:20:13.304\nAnd if you don't have a committed,\npassionate,\n\n399\n00:20:13.304 --> 00:20:16.519\nengaged team that feels like\nthey've got some level of control,\n\n400\n00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:20.334\nyou will not ever get it to be a high\nlevel performance team that ships on time.\n\n401\n00:20:20.334 --> 00:20:24.913\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I love the saying you hear\na lot in agile development of a servant\n\n402\n00:20:24.913 --> 00:20:29.933\nleader, so a leader that's going to say\nperiodically throughout that process,\n\n403\n00:20:29.933 --> 00:20:34.801\nwhat can I do to help you, what skills do\nyou need, what training do you need, or\n\n404\n00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:39.672\nwhat things can I get out of your way that\nare stopping you from not being able to do\n\n405\n00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:40.369\nyour job?\n\n406\n00:20:40.369 --> 00:20:45.309\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, servant leadership comes from a\ngentleman named Greenleaf, and it's really\n\n407\n00:20:45.309 --> 00:20:49.771\nthe way leadership is changing, years\nago it used to be command and control,\n\n408\n00:20:49.771 --> 00:20:54.226\ndo as I say, not as I do, which is what I\nwas just describing with a sponsor that\n\n409\n00:20:54.226 --> 00:20:59.131\njust gives the team all of the information\nand says, go do this, it's do it or else.\n\n410\n00:20:59.131 --> 00:21:03.575\nThat doesn't really work and it especially\ndoesn't work with millennials and\n\n411\n00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:08.151\nthe new generation of workers, then it\nshifted to a lot of management by numbers,\n\n412\n00:21:08.151 --> 00:21:12.065\nand spreadsheet and project and\nall those sort of things where it was,\n\n413\n00:21:12.065 --> 00:21:15.619\ndid we meet our numbers,\nwhat does the spreadsheet look like?\n\n414\n00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:18.372\nNow it's much more gone\nto servant leadership and\n\n415\n00:21:18.372 --> 00:21:21.324\nthe big idea there is compassion,\nconnection, EQ,\n\n416\n00:21:21.324 --> 00:21:24.813\nthe ability to understand the needs and\nthe worries of others.\n\n417\n00:21:24.813 --> 00:21:27.142\nAnd then a big, big part of,\nis the leader being,\n\n418\n00:21:27.142 --> 00:21:30.249\ninstead of at the top of the pyramid,\nflipping the pyramid over and\n\n419\n00:21:30.249 --> 00:21:33.967\nbeing the one who serves the rest of the\nteam and helps them be successful because\n\n420\n00:21:33.967 --> 00:21:37.221\nthey know if the team is successful,\nI'm successful as the leader.\n\n421\n00:21:37.221 --> 00:21:37.758\n&gt;&gt; Great, John.\n\n422\n00:21:37.758 --> 00:21:41.515\nNow I think we've got a pretty good\nunderstanding of how to build a team,\n\n423\n00:21:41.515 --> 00:21:44.533\nhow to set up the different\nteam members and pick that, and\n\n424\n00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:48.413\nI know we're gonna get to some of the\nother things later in terms of now how to\n\n425\n00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:51.123\nactually worked with that\nteam on the day to day, but\n\n426\n00:21:51.123 --> 00:21:54.489\nany final thoughts on this before\nwe leave off for this episode?\n\n427\n00:21:54.489 --> 00:21:56.533\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you don't get\nstarted off on the right foot,\n\n428\n00:21:56.533 --> 00:21:58.231\nit's really hard to\nhave an effective team.\n\n429\n00:21:58.231 --> 00:22:02.271\nSo, you wanna clearly understand where\nyou're going, make sure you're in full\n\n430\n00:22:02.271 --> 00:22:06.374\nalignment with the sponsor, get the best\npeople you can possibly get on your team,\n\n431\n00:22:06.374 --> 00:22:09.653\nthe ones that are ideal team members,\nand then gain commitment and\n\n432\n00:22:09.653 --> 00:22:13.287\nalignment before the team even gets\ntogether, or as you put it together,\n\n433\n00:22:13.287 --> 00:22:16.801\nto make sure that we all start off on\nthe same page in the same direction,\n\n434\n00:22:16.801 --> 00:22:18.951\nexcited about working together as a team.\n\n435\n00:22:18.951 --> 00:22:22.016\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, and I'm excited about\nthese future episodes we have, and\n\n436\n00:22:22.016 --> 00:22:24.841\nfiguring out this whole process from here,\nso thank you, John.\n\n437\n00:22:24.841 --> 00:22:25.497\n&gt;&gt; My pleasure, Peter.\n\n438\n00:22:25.497 --> 00:22:28.723\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that is going to do\nit for this episode here on BizProTV,\n\n439\n00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:32.497\nlike I said we've got a lot more coming up\nwith a lot more information on how you're\n\n440\n00:22:32.497 --> 00:22:35.943\nactually going to work together with\nthis team, but we are going to do it for\n\n441\n00:22:35.943 --> 00:22:38.496\nthis episode, so signing off,\nI am Peter VanRysdam.\n\n442\n00:22:38.496 --> 00:22:39.274\n&gt;&gt; And I'm John Spence.\n\n443\n00:22:39.274 --> 00:22:39.949\n&gt;&gt; And we'ill see you next time.\n\n444\n00:22:39.949 --> 00:22:49.853\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Peter Vanryanstam, and\ntoday we're continuing in our series about\n\n4\n00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:13.660\nleading technology teams, and specifically\nin this episode, I'm gonna look down so\n\n5\n00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.144\nI get this right, we're talking about\nestablishing guidelines, roles and\n\n6\n00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:18.690\ngoals for those teams.\n\n7\n00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.400\nAnd here to help us is someone who has\na lot of experience building teams,\n\n8\n00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.960\nJohn Spence.\n\n9\n00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.640\nJohn, how are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.720\n&gt;&gt; Doing great Peter, and you?\n\n11\n00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.080\nThank you very much.\n\n13\n00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.960\n&gt;&gt; My pleasure.\n\n14\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.590\n&gt;&gt; I think a good place for\nus to start today,\n\n15\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.750\nwe talked a lot in previous episodes about\nhow we go ahead and build that team.\n\n16\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.500\nSo let's just do a quick recap of that so\nwe can kind of get our minds set in this,\n\n17\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.380\nand then continue on in talking\nabout how to establish those goals.\n\n18\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we used one of the most famous\nand well known frameworks about forming,\n\n19\n00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.490\nstorming, norming,\nperforming and adjourning.\n\n20\n00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.280\nRemember that,\n[LAUGH] adjourning the team.\n\n21\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.690\nAnd we're still focused on\nthe forming part here, and\n\n22\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.060\ngetting sure that we're on track.\n\n23\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.040\nAnd one of the most important\nthings to do when forming a team\n\n24\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.760\nis after you've figured out your purpose,\nyour direction, your sponsors told you\n\n25\n00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.890\nwhere you wanna go is to sit back and\nsay, alright let's create a team charter.\n\n26\n00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.475\nAt least that's the word.\n\n27\n00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:13.886\nIt could be a rules for\nthe road, your team guidelines,\n\n28\n00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:16.120\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n29\n00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.740\nBut I call it a team charter of, this\nis the way we're gonna behave, this is\n\n30\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.160\nthe way we're gonna act, this is the way\nwe'll treat each other within the team.\n\n31\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.250\nAnd I brought an example here, Peter,\n\n32\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.540\nI wanted to read, because these can\nbe challenging to put together.\n\n33\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.910\nAnd it should be your whole team\nthat sits down and discusses this.\n\n34\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.180\nBut I want to give you a few examples\nthat I think will help you when you go to\n\n35\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.950\ndo your guidelines.\n\n36\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.945\nSo here's a set that I've pulled down\nfrom one of the clients I worked with.\n\n37\n00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:46.110\n100% respect at all time.\n\n38\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.160\nMicrosoft's got a great example around\nthis, they say to be tough on ideas and\n\n39\n00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.400\neasy on people.\n\n40\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.870\nSo if you're gonna have a highly cohesive\nteam, you gotta make sure that you treat\n\n41\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.230\neach other with the an extremely\nhigh level of respect.\n\n42\n00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.110\nMeetings are a safe place that if we talk\nabout something that's confidential,\n\n43\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.380\nif we share an idea that we don't want\noutside of the room that we know that\n\n44\n00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.980\nwhatever happens in\nthe meeting you're safe.\n\n45\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.030\nYou're not gonna be attacked.\n\n46\n00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.296\nWe're not gonna come after you, we're not\ngonna embarrass you and we're not gonna\n\n47\n00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:16.289\nshare the things that you said in here\nthat you'd prefer didn't get shared.\n\n48\n00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.041\nWe will communicate the status of\neach other's work no matter how bad\n\n49\n00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:21.100\nthe news is.\n\n50\n00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.600\nI love this one.\n\n51\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.630\nIf you're running late on something, and\nyou're not gonna turn it in on time,\n\n52\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.800\nyou don't wait until it's\nlate to tell everybody.\n\n53\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.436\nYou tell them, I'm falling behind,\nI need a little help,\n\n54\n00:02:30.436 --> 00:02:33.197\nI'm not gonna be able to get\nthat to you by Friday at 4:00.\n\n55\n00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:37.660\nWe will speak our mind rather\nthan hide things from each other.\n\n56\n00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.380\nWhen we evaluate each others work\nour focus will be on work and\n\n57\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.360\nnot who did it, and that's a big idea.\n\n58\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.970\nSo kinda goes back to my Microsoft quote,\nfocus attack ideas but not people.\n\n59\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.430\nThis is where we're gonna look at it and\nsay,\n\n60\n00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.430\nthis work is not at the quality we wanted,\nit's not what we expected, it doesn't\n\n61\n00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.420\nhave all the information we required and\nI'm not going to attack the person at all.\n\n62\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.270\nBut as a team, we're gonna agree that\nevery time we put work out, as a group,\n\n63\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.260\nwe're gonna make sure the work is up to\npar and no one will take it personally.\n\n64\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.510\nWe will come prepared to meetings.\n\n65\n00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.580\nAnd in case we are unable to attend,\nwe will complete our work, and\n\n66\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.580\nforward its status to the team leader.\n\n67\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.850\nNot every time a team gets together\ncan all the team members be there.\n\n68\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.290\nBut you want to make sure that\nall the information necessary for\n\n69\n00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.880\nthe meeting is there.\n\n70\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.380\nEverything's been turned early, people\nhave a chance to prepare, read, study, and\n\n71\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.520\nbe able to come to the meeting\nset to go immediately.\n\n72\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.829\nHere's two more to go on that, we'll\narrive on time and respect the agenda.\n\n73\n00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.090\nWe will not have a meeting\nunless we have an agenda.\n\n74\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.120\nThis is a big point.\n\n75\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.440\nI see a lot of teams waste time because\nthey set a 9 o'clock meeting when people\n\n76\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.088\nroll in about 9, 9:15.\n\n77\n00:03:44.088 --> 00:03:48.260\nIt was supposed to stop at 10, we don't\nhave agenda, we're chatting about it.\n\n78\n00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.350\nReally good teams have a clear start time,\na clear stop time,\n\n79\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.990\nand they've created an agenda and\neveryone stays on agenda.\n\n80\n00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.890\nAnd if you get something that's off,\nyou can put it over in a parking lot.\n\n81\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.970\nBut 80% of the meeting, 90% of\nthe meeting should be fast, on time,\n\n82\n00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.320\nclear communication, on agenda.\n\n83\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.870\nThere are a couple more here\nI wanna share with you.\n\n84\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.200\nWe will leave every medium with a clear\naction steps, responsibilities and\n\n85\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.230\ndue dates.\n\n86\n00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.000\nAgain, this is another big issue I see\nis we have a meeting, we discuss stuff,\n\n87\n00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.530\nwe throw some ideas out and\nthen we get up and walk out.\n\n88\n00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.290\nOn an effective team, we stop and\nwe talk about each idea,\n\n89\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.060\nwho's gonna take care of it,\nwho will take the responsibility,\n\n90\n00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.790\nwhat the outcome looks like, what the due\ndate is and we'll gain agreement.\n\n91\n00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.700\nAnd we'll not leave the media until\nsomeone is specifically responsible for\n\n92\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.780\nit, and has accepted responsibility and\nagreed on a timeline and date, and\n\n93\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.470\nyou know what the next steps are.\n\n94\n00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.730\nSo everyone knows what's gonna\nhappen after the meeting.\n\n95\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.700\nWe will practice both personal and\nteam accountability.\n\n96\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.220\nIf you didn't do something you\ngotta take full accountability.\n\n97\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.880\nIf someone else didn't,\nand here's the tough one,\n\n98\n00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.580\nis we have to have a team that\nholds each other accountable.\n\n99\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.930\nAnd that people don't get defensive or\nangry or emotional,\n\n100\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.210\nthat they understand this is us trying\nto create a super high performance team.\n\n101\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.130\nWhich is another role l like is if we're\npushing each other a little hard in\n\n102\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.290\nthe meeting and we're being\na little aggressive around ideas,\n\n103\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.550\nif people do start to get emotional, then\nyou've got a mandatory ten minute break.\n\n104\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.330\nEverybody go just gets a glass of water,\nwalks outside, has some coffee or\n\n105\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.471\nsomething, but the minute emotions start\nto get beyond the point of constructive\n\n106\n00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:25.371\nconflict, you wanna sort of shut\nthe meeting down for 10 or 15 minutes and\n\n107\n00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:27.011\nmake sure everything's good.\n\n108\n00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:30.149\nAnd then last but not least,\nwe will respond to email or\n\n109\n00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:33.830\nphone queries from others on\nthe team within 24 hours.\n\n110\n00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.860\nIf we don't have an answer,\nwe will at least acknowledge the query\n\n111\n00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.258\nwithin 24 hours, and let the sender\nknow about our ability to help.\n\n112\n00:05:40.258 --> 00:05:43.340\nIf you're not communicating with\nthe rest of the team in a timely manner,\n\n113\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.330\nyou're holding the rest of the team back.\n\n114\n00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.814\nSo making that rule, you've got 24\nhours from the minute you get an email,\n\n115\n00:05:48.814 --> 00:05:50.500\nto either say, I can't respond right now,\n\n116\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.730\nI'll get back to you tomorrow, or here's\nthe answer, let's keep things moving.\n\n117\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.140\n&gt;&gt; I think those are a great kind of\nlist that you could start from and build\n\n118\n00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.130\nyour own, or tweak those to accommodate\nthe kind of project you're own.\n\n119\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.260\nBut I think it's also important to\nnote that isn't something that just\n\n120\n00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.830\ncomes down from the team leader and\nsays, these are our rules,\n\n121\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.720\nbut we gotta get everyone involved and\nget that buy in.\n\n122\n00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really the essential part\nof this, is this should be a very robust,\n\n123\n00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:19.650\nthorough discussion, where you put a lot\nof ideas on the table, some of the ones\n\n124\n00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.150\nI just gave you, look some more up on\nthe internet, whatever you wanna do.\n\n125\n00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.780\nAnd let people give their ideas, of\nthe kinda guidelines, rules of the road,\n\n126\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.220\nthe charter they want, cuz this is\ngonna be the bedrock for your team.\n\n127\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.010\nThis is gonna be the thing that keeps\nyour performance at a certain level and\n\n128\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.930\nhelps you interact with each other and\n\n129\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.000\none of the ways I use this,\nPeter, is to number it.\n\n130\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.520\nOnce we come up with a team charter, I\nwant to put a big number next to each one\n\n131\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.670\nso if we're in middle\nof a team meeting and\n\n132\n00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.930\nI feel like someone violates one of\nthe charter ideas, one of the values.\n\n133\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.236\nInstead of calling me out I'm still\nlooking at my piece of paper and go,\n\n134\n00:06:54.236 --> 00:06:55.040\nnumber three.\n\n135\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.370\nNumber three, everybody read it.\n\n136\n00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.080\nBecause you should carry\nthe charter to every meeting.\n\n137\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.670\nIt should be sitting on the desk so\n\n138\n00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.780\nthat any time you interact with people,\nyou can look down at, and\n\n139\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.380\nif you're violating it or if you're\nworried about it, and I like that.\n\n140\n00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.070\nSo it's a very innocuous way to say,\nnumber seven.\n\n141\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.724\nLet's just all take a second\nto look at number seven.\n\n142\n00:07:09.724 --> 00:07:12.057\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this isn't something\nthat's just discussed,\n\n143\n00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:15.080\nthis is actually written down on paper and\nbrought to meetings.\n\n144\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.668\n&gt;&gt; Written down, brought to meetings,\npart of the agenda.\n\n145\n00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:20.719\nSome companies I work have\na couple of them laminated, and\n\n146\n00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:23.287\nthey leave them laying\non the conference table.\n\n147\n00:07:23.287 --> 00:07:26.060\nAnd any time you get together,\nyou just sort of push them around.\n\n148\n00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.510\nSome organizations I work with, actually\nread them at the beginning of every team\n\n149\n00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.660\nmeeting, to make sure that everybody's on.\n\n150\n00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.570\nThey will do the mission, vision,\nvalues of the company and\n\n151\n00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:40.100\nthe team charter as a two or three minute\nstart up to get everybody refreshed and\n\n152\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.730\nmake sure we're all on the same page.\n\n153\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now,\n\n154\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.110\none of the next things that we have to\ntalk about in this episode is the roles.\n\n155\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.162\nAnd I'm curious about how the decision\nmaking process should go within in a team.\n\n156\n00:07:52.162 --> 00:07:55.554\nIs this something that's unique to\nthe team or do we always just say, okay,\n\n157\n00:07:55.554 --> 00:07:57.627\neveryone bring their ideas,\nand the leader.\n\n158\n00:07:57.627 --> 00:07:59.975\nComes up with what the final decision is?\n\n159\n00:07:59.975 --> 00:08:04.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is something I learned\nyears ago when I used to run a company.\n\n160\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.510\nI was a new CEO and I thought it was so\ncool to be in charge.\n\n161\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.239\n[LAUGH] And I would sit in my office and\nevery decision had to come to me.\n\n162\n00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:16.450\nUntil I looked up one day and saw my\nentire staff standing in the hallway\n\n163\n00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.200\nwaiting for me to make the decisions.\n\n164\n00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.048\nAnd I realized I was the bottleneck.\n\n165\n00:08:20.048 --> 00:08:24.320\nSo, all of the decisions do not\nneed to be made by the team leader.\n\n166\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.360\nAnd I came up with an idea called\nthe four levels of decision making.\n\n167\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.470\nSo here's how they work.\n\n168\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.490\nLevel one decision.\n\n169\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.740\nNo matter who you are on the team.\n\n170\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.430\nNo matter what role you are playing.\n\n171\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.073\nThis is your decision.\n\n172\n00:08:34.073 --> 00:08:36.350\nNow, you're the expert on this.\n\n173\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.950\nThis is why you're on the team.\n\n174\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.740\nYou don't need to talk to anybody else.\n\n175\n00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.010\nMake the decision and\nthen you own the outcome.\n\n176\n00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.060\nYou have full accountability for\nthe outcome.\n\n177\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.917\nLevel one decision,\nyou make the decision, you own it.\n\n178\n00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:50.460\nLevel two, you probably need\nto get some feedback on this.\n\n179\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.480\nTalk to me as a team leader,\ntalk to someone else on the team,\n\n180\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.070\nmaybe talk to someone outside of the team,\nget some advice, some input,\n\n181\n00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.490\nsome suggestions,\nthen you make the decision and you own it.\n\n182\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.690\nLevel two, get advice,\nyou make decision, you own the decision.\n\n183\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.470\nLevel three is a team decision.\n\n184\n00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.880\nAnd this is, as you said Peter,\nis when we get everybody together.\n\n185\n00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.150\nAnd we're going to try\nto get the consensus.\n\n186\n00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.730\nWe're going to put\neverybody's idea in there.\n\n187\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.160\nWe're all going to talk about it.\n\n188\n00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.880\nAnd then here's the big idea for\nthe team leader.\n\n189\n00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.620\nWhatever the team decides,\nthe leader backs it up and\n\n190\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.260\nthe leader owns the decision.\n\n191\n00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.280\nSo if I'm the team leader and the team\nsays, we all wanna go this way, and I say,\n\n192\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.360\nI think we should go this way,\n\n193\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.220\nand the whole team says this,\nthen I say, all right.\n\n194\n00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.410\nI'm gonna go in your direction,\nI trust you.\n\n195\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.624\nWe're on this team together.\n\n196\n00:09:34.624 --> 00:09:38.240\nWe'll make that decision as a team and\nthen I own the outcome.\n\n197\n00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.050\nIf anything goes wrong, I'll take\naccountability and responsibility for it.\n\n198\n00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.582\nWhich gets me to level four decisions,\nwhich is the team leaders' decision.\n\n199\n00:09:45.582 --> 00:09:48.257\nAnd at that level you say\nI'm making this decision and\n\n200\n00:09:48.257 --> 00:09:50.370\nI need everybody else to back me up.\n\n201\n00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.275\nOn the level three team decisions you made\nthe decisions or you guys came up with\n\n202\n00:09:54.275 --> 00:09:57.961\nwhat you wanted to do, I followed it and\nbacked you, I need you to back me.\n\n203\n00:09:57.961 --> 00:09:59.837\nI might have information you don't have,\n\n204\n00:09:59.837 --> 00:10:03.270\nI might have a little bit higher\nstrategic view of what's going on.\n\n205\n00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.050\nI might have better\ncommunications with the sponsor.\n\n206\n00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.420\nBut at this level I need to,\nyou just need to trust me.\n\n207\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.422\nAnd if you've done the other three levels\nand you've built a high level of trust,\n\n208\n00:10:13.422 --> 00:10:17.482\nthen what happens is your team, instead of\ngetting angry or mad or pushing back, or\n\n209\n00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:19.351\ngetting defensive is say, I got you.\n\n210\n00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:20.360\nI got your back.\n\n211\n00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.150\nYou trusted us.\n\n212\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.127\nI'll trust you and they get to\nwork instead of sitting around and\n\n213\n00:10:24.127 --> 00:10:25.738\ncomplaining about the decision.\n\n214\n00:10:25.738 --> 00:10:28.352\n&gt;&gt; That seems to be a theme,\nnot just with the team charter, but\n\n215\n00:10:28.352 --> 00:10:30.070\nalso with how decisions are made.\n\n216\n00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.710\nWe wanna get buy-in from the entire group,\nand speaking of that group.\n\n217\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.314\nSo we just talked about the leader,\n\n218\n00:10:35.314 --> 00:10:38.844\nthat's kind of the role that everyone\nalready knows that exists on a team, but\n\n219\n00:10:38.844 --> 00:10:41.964\nthere are other roles just besides\nleader and non-leader, right?\n\n220\n00:10:41.964 --> 00:10:43.670\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, yeah.\n\n221\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:48.470\nThis is an area that frankly,\nI'm not used to working in a whole bunch.\n\n222\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.081\nBecause most of the time teams have sort\nof formed and they're going together.\n\n223\n00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:57.140\nSo I had to do a little research on this,\nand I found a model by Meredith Belbin.\n\n224\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.710\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nmove to a slide here if we could.\n\n225\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:05.000\nAnd this is the nine roles of a team and\nI thought this was some very good work.\n\n226\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.732\nSo I wanna go through these quickly and\nwe'll hit them.\n\n227\n00:11:07.732 --> 00:11:10.820\nSo the first one we're gonna look at\nis the people focus part of the team.\n\n228\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.130\nWhat do the people do together?\n\n229\n00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.270\nAnd you've got three general areas there.\n\n230\n00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.190\nYou've got your resource Investigator,\nwhich is the person that's going out and\n\n231\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.260\ntrying to get help.\n\n232\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.270\nThey're asking for input,\nthey're asking for\n\n233\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.430\nresources, they're trying\nto get information.\n\n234\n00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.225\nThey're trying to do everything they\ncan to bring more resources and\n\n235\n00:11:26.225 --> 00:11:27.198\nbring them to the team.\n\n236\n00:11:27.198 --> 00:11:31.320\nNext one is what they call team worker,\nand this is pretty easy.\n\n237\n00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.470\nThis is the sociable person on\nthe team that energizes the team,\n\n238\n00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.780\nkeeps them motivated, keeps them together.\n\n239\n00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.687\nSmooths out conflict,\nmake sure people aren't fighting,\n\n240\n00:11:40.687 --> 00:11:44.630\nthey're the one's that want to make sure\nthe team's cohesive and it gets along.\n\n241\n00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.760\nThe next one is the coordinator.\n\n242\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.810\nAnd with the coordinators\nit's kinda like the agenda.\n\n243\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.340\nIt's keeping people on goal,\non time, on date.\n\n244\n00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.780\nMaking sure they're coordinated in all\nthe different parts of the project and\n\n245\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.659\nkeeping everyone on the team\nfocused on delivering the results.\n\n246\n00:11:58.659 --> 00:12:01.670\nSo those first three\nare all-around people focused.\n\n247\n00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.345\n&gt;&gt; And just to clarify while you're\ngoing to the next slide here,\n\n248\n00:12:04.345 --> 00:12:07.235\nare we saying that every team needs\nto have all of these components.\n\n249\n00:12:07.235 --> 00:12:09.782\nOr are we saying that these\nare kind of the buckets\n\n250\n00:12:09.782 --> 00:12:13.980\nthat you can kind of put people in your\nmind so you know how to work with them?\n\n251\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.530\n&gt;&gt; Superb question.\n\n252\n00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.320\nThese are sort of the buckets\nyou can put them in.\n\n253\n00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.458\nAnd different people play different roles.\n\n254\n00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:21.880\nLike in a minute we're gonna\ntalk about the specialist.\n\n255\n00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.920\nAnd I might be the specialist in\none part of the team project and\n\n256\n00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.370\nthen someone else is a specialist.\n\n257\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.352\nSo you don't always wanna\nbe the coordinator.\n\n258\n00:12:28.352 --> 00:12:32.670\nYou don't always wanna be the team worker,\nalthough you want everybody in the team.\n\n259\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.300\nBut it would be tiring if you were\nthe one that constantly had to go\n\n260\n00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.130\nsmooth the waters.\n\n261\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.230\nMake sure everybody is right.\n\n262\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.740\nGet between people.\n\n263\n00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.260\nSo these roles rotate according to\nwhere people are on the team and\n\n264\n00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.100\nwhere the team is in its project.\n\n265\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.206\nGive you a good example here, the first\none we're gonna talk about in under action\n\n266\n00:12:49.206 --> 00:12:52.432\nand task focus is the shaper and\noftentimes that's the leader.\n\n267\n00:12:52.432 --> 00:12:55.992\nThe visionary whose setting the strategy,\nidentifying the course for\n\n268\n00:12:55.992 --> 00:12:58.017\nthe organization, where we want to go.\n\n269\n00:12:58.017 --> 00:13:00.833\nWe said earlier, and\nwe're gonna talk about it in a minute,\n\n270\n00:13:00.833 --> 00:13:03.850\nit's really important on a team for\nthat to be shared.\n\n271\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.630\nBut there is a role for someone who's\ngonna say this is where we're all going.\n\n272\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.530\nLet's get excited, let's get aligned,\nhere's where I see our team going.\n\n273\n00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.176\nThe next one is the Implementer.\n\n274\n00:13:13.176 --> 00:13:17.498\nAnd this is critical on a team, because\nthe single biggest problem in most teams\n\n275\n00:13:17.498 --> 00:13:21.059\nand organizations I work with Is\nlack of disciplined execution.\n\n276\n00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:23.200\nThey've got great ideas.\n\n277\n00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.280\nThey've got a good strategy.\n\n278\n00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.948\nThey've got a plan.\n\n279\n00:13:24.948 --> 00:13:29.010\nThey've got a vision, but\nit's not being implemented accordingly.\n\n280\n00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.640\nSo the implementer is\nsomeone who's pushing,\n\n281\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.720\nwho's moving things forward, making sure\nthey take ideas and turn them into action.\n\n282\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.722\nThey're results focused all the time.\n\n283\n00:13:37.722 --> 00:13:41.973\nThe completer and finisher is the one\nthat once you've got the stuff quote on\n\n284\n00:13:41.973 --> 00:13:45.510\nquote finished, [LAUGH] they go in and\nmake sure it's right.\n\n285\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.100\nThat there's no errors.\n\n286\n00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.180\nThat you've covered everything\nyou needed to cover.\n\n287\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.700\nThat it's on time and you deliver\nwhat you promised you would deliver.\n\n288\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.760\nSo again people are gonna\nswitch in those roles Peter.\n\n289\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.810\nSometimes I'm gonna be the finisher.\n\n290\n00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.820\nIf I understand the project\nbetter than anyone else.\n\n291\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.590\nI'll be the one that goes through and\nchecks for errors,\n\n292\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.390\nomissions and\nmakes sure that everything's on target.\n\n293\n00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe've done people focused.\n\n294\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.780\nWe've done action and task focused.\n\n295\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.700\nSo what's next?\n\n296\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.230\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna move to thinking focused,\nand again there's nine roles, so\n\n297\n00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.370\nthere's three here.\n\n298\n00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.870\nIt's an interesting name when I looked at\nthis research by Dolbin, the word plant,\n\n299\n00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.970\nand I had to think about this for\na minute.\n\n300\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.841\nAnd the plant is sort of the person you\nplant in the team who's innovative,\n\n301\n00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:27.805\ncreative, who's gonna may\nbe play devil's advocate.\n\n302\n00:14:27.805 --> 00:14:30.430\nThey're gonna push people\na little bit harder.\n\n303\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.600\nThey're the one that are gonna\ntest ideas,and try to bring in\n\n304\n00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.720\ndifferent thinking, new ideas,\ndifferent ways to look at things.\n\n305\n00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.700\nAnd mix things up, and\nkeep the team innovative and creative.\n\n306\n00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.889\nAnd again different people\nplay this role all the time.\n\n307\n00:14:43.889 --> 00:14:47.710\nThe specialist is the person\nwho has unique knowledge.\n\n308\n00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.860\nThey've got an expertise, experience,\n\n309\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.100\ntraining in an area that no\none else on the team has.\n\n310\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.790\nSo they've got a lot more than\nthe other people on the team and\n\n311\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.070\nwe turn to the specialist.\n\n312\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.204\nAnd again the role rotates according to\nwhat the project's trying to achieve and\n\n313\n00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:05.116\nthe person who has the best experience,\nthe most information in that area.\n\n314\n00:15:05.116 --> 00:15:07.673\nAnd then, last, is the monitor evaluator,\n\n315\n00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:10.540\nwho's always looking at options,\nall right?\n\n316\n00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.724\nCuz what happens a lot is\nyou get groupthink and\n\n317\n00:15:12.724 --> 00:15:15.246\nit's an interesting thing\nI learned a long time ago.\n\n318\n00:15:15.246 --> 00:15:19.481\nAnd you'll probably enjoy this, Peter, is\nI realized one day that almost throughout\n\n319\n00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:22.614\nyour entire life when you're\nin kindergarten, grade school,\n\n320\n00:15:22.614 --> 00:15:27.170\ngraduate school, whatever it is, you're\ntaught to look for the one right answer.\n\n321\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.720\nCuz on every test,\nthere's always one right answer.\n\n322\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.230\nBut the minute you get out of school and\nyou get into the work, you realize\n\n323\n00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.730\nthere's not always one right answer,\nthere could be multiple right answers.\n\n324\n00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:40.030\nSo what the monitor evaluator is doing is\nconstantly trying to evaluate options.\n\n325\n00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.661\nMake sure things are going,\noffer more options and\n\n326\n00:15:42.661 --> 00:15:44.863\nmake sure that we don't\nget group think and\n\n327\n00:15:44.863 --> 00:15:48.613\nsettle on the very first idea because\nwe think it's the one best answer.\n\n328\n00:15:48.613 --> 00:15:52.412\nThat we go to a second, and a third, and\na fourth option and then usually find out\n\n329\n00:15:52.412 --> 00:15:56.247\nthat if we combine number three and number\none it comes out with a better answer.\n\n330\n00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:59.986\n&gt;&gt; So what, we might not have\none of each of those nine roles.\n\n331\n00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:03.354\nWe might not even have nine\nindividual people on the team,\n\n332\n00:16:03.354 --> 00:16:07.683\ncould be a smaller team than that, it\nmight be a good idea to have people kind\n\n333\n00:16:07.683 --> 00:16:10.111\nof in each of those overall three groups.\n\n334\n00:16:10.111 --> 00:16:13.671\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I want a good mix on my team,\nof people that can do all of those things.\n\n335\n00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:17.395\nAnd then sometimes, you can assign\none of these roles, for example,\n\n336\n00:16:17.395 --> 00:16:21.120\nyou can tell someone that their job's\ngonna be to bring in the second,\n\n337\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.466\nthird, fourth idea,\nto be the creative, innovative one, or\n\n338\n00:16:24.466 --> 00:16:28.569\nyou can assign someone to be the one that\nkeeps everybody on time and agenda and\n\n339\n00:16:28.569 --> 00:16:31.887\nmakes sure that things are going\nforward the way they need to.\n\n340\n00:16:31.887 --> 00:16:36.980\nSo it's gonna be, some people will fall\ninto these on their own, other times,\n\n341\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:42.020\nyou can assign the role and say, for now\nI want you to play this role on the team.\n\n342\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.976\n&gt;&gt; All right, great, John, that covers the\nroles now, and now we're gonna move on to\n\n343\n00:16:45.976 --> 00:16:49.230\nthe goals I guess, everything has\nto rhyme with you, it seems like.\n\n344\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.493\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Roles and goals, so\n\n345\n00:16:50.493 --> 00:16:51.855\ntell us about the goals on a team.\n\n346\n00:16:51.855 --> 00:16:56.102\n&gt;&gt; Well, now that we've understood\nthe different roles people can play,\n\n347\n00:16:56.102 --> 00:17:00.905\nbefore you set the goals, you wanna step\nback and reconfirm what's our purpose,\n\n348\n00:17:00.905 --> 00:17:03.985\nwhat does success look like,\nwhat's the outcome?\n\n349\n00:17:03.985 --> 00:17:07.508\nBecause all the goals are going to\nbe driven by the final outcome, and\n\n350\n00:17:07.508 --> 00:17:11.641\none of the reasons it's so important to\nset that direction together is it's part\n\n351\n00:17:11.641 --> 00:17:15.893\nof a model that I teach, that I've studied\nand learned about what it takes to create\n\n352\n00:17:15.893 --> 00:17:20.445\na high performance team, and there's six\nthings on that, and we'll go through them.\n\n353\n00:17:20.445 --> 00:17:24.759\nNumber one is direction, going back and\nchecking on what are the overall goals,\n\n354\n00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:26.991\nthe outcomes, what do we wanna achieve?\n\n355\n00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:31.326\nAnd the key word on high performance\nteams with direction is shared,\n\n356\n00:17:31.326 --> 00:17:35.528\npeople need to have a chance to\ngive their ideas, their opinions.\n\n357\n00:17:35.528 --> 00:17:38.390\nThat doesn't mean they get to\nchange the overall objective and\n\n358\n00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.062\npurpose of the team, the overall major\ngoal for the team or major objective, but\n\n359\n00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:45.410\nthey need to have a chance to say,\nhere's how I think we should get there,\n\n360\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.216\nthis is what I'm interested in, here's\nsome things that we might wanna focus on.\n\n361\n00:17:49.216 --> 00:17:52.258\nOne of the ways I look at it is if\npeople don't have a say in the outcome,\n\n362\n00:17:52.258 --> 00:17:54.990\nthey wont have a stake in the outcome,\nif the leader just says,\n\n363\n00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.395\nthis is what we're doing, this is where\nwe're going, these are the values,\n\n364\n00:17:58.395 --> 00:18:01.489\nthis is our culture, and you are not\ngetting a lot of bind on your team and\n\n365\n00:18:01.489 --> 00:18:04.169\nin order to have a great technology team,\nor any kind of team,\n\n366\n00:18:04.169 --> 00:18:06.482\nyou need people committed and\naligned and excited.\n\n367\n00:18:06.482 --> 00:18:10.776\nSo the first D in my model,\nand the model is DMCCMD, so\n\n368\n00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:15.548\nthe first D is direction,\nthe first M is measurable goals,\n\n369\n00:18:15.548 --> 00:18:19.938\nwhich is exactly what we\nare going to get into here, and\n\n370\n00:18:19.938 --> 00:18:23.566\nthe idea behind measurable\ngoals is binary,\n\n371\n00:18:23.566 --> 00:18:27.601\nyou want the goal to be very clear,\nno ambiguity.\n\n372\n00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:32.375\nOne of my very, very favorite business\nphrases is ambiguity breeds mediocrity, so\n\n373\n00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:36.138\nwe want the goals to be as specific and\nclear as possible, binary,\n\n374\n00:18:36.138 --> 00:18:41.248\nit's a one-zero, yes-no, you've got it or\nyou didn't, no guessing, everybody can\n\n375\n00:18:41.248 --> 00:18:46.129\nclearly understand it, you're gonna see\nwhy that's so important in just a minute.\n\n376\n00:18:46.129 --> 00:18:50.398\nThe first C is competence, I want to get\nthe very best people I can possibly get on\n\n377\n00:18:50.398 --> 00:18:54.671\nmy team, I want people who are highly\ncompetent, who understand what they're\n\n378\n00:18:54.671 --> 00:18:58.047\ndoing, have a lot of experience and\nare good at being on a team,\n\n379\n00:18:58.047 --> 00:19:02.237\nthat are collaborative, so I wanna get\nhighly competent people on the team.\n\n380\n00:19:02.237 --> 00:19:07.666\nThe next C is communication, and the key\nwords around communication are open,\n\n381\n00:19:07.666 --> 00:19:11.646\nhonest, robust, and\nthe major key word is transparent.\n\n382\n00:19:11.646 --> 00:19:16.902\nOn a high functioning team,\npeople are constantly sharing information.\n\n383\n00:19:16.902 --> 00:19:20.121\nPeople used to believe a long time\nago that knowledge equaled power,\n\n384\n00:19:20.121 --> 00:19:23.351\nthat is not it at all, and\nespecially on a team, that doesn't work.\n\n385\n00:19:23.351 --> 00:19:27.098\nThe more information you share with\npeople, the better you can empower them,\n\n386\n00:19:27.098 --> 00:19:30.958\nand that creates a more cohesive team that\nthe team together is more powerful, so\n\n387\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.946\nlet me stop there and\nreview before we get through the first M.\n\n388\n00:19:33.946 --> 00:19:37.831\nWe want to have a clear,\nvivid, compelling vision for\n\n389\n00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:41.133\nthe team that is shared,\na shared direction.\n\n390\n00:19:41.133 --> 00:19:45.355\nThe next thing is we want measurable goals\nthat are binary, we want highly competent\n\n391\n00:19:45.355 --> 00:19:48.815\npeople on the team, and\nwe want lots of transparent communication.\n\n392\n00:19:48.815 --> 00:19:51.634\nNow, the second M here is\nwhere the whole model changes,\n\n393\n00:19:51.634 --> 00:19:55.645\nthis is where all the power in the model\nis, and this M is mutual accountability.\n\n394\n00:19:55.645 --> 00:19:59.778\nThis is where everybody on the team holds\nthemselves personally accountable for\n\n395\n00:19:59.778 --> 00:20:03.850\ndelivering whatever they had promised,\nand they hold everyone else on the team\n\n396\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.423\naccountable for\ndelivering what they promised.\n\n397\n00:20:06.423 --> 00:20:10.392\nNow we're going to understand why the\nmeasurable binary goals are so important,\n\n398\n00:20:10.392 --> 00:20:13.728\nbecause if you don't have clear goals,\nif the goals are ambiguous,\n\n399\n00:20:13.728 --> 00:20:17.178\nit sounds like this, Peter,\nI don't think you achieved that goal, or\n\n400\n00:20:17.178 --> 00:20:20.628\nI don't think you delivered what\nyou were supposed to deliver, Mary,\n\n401\n00:20:20.628 --> 00:20:24.113\nthat doesn't seem like you really got\nwhat we wanted to get out of that.\n\n402\n00:20:24.113 --> 00:20:24.801\n&gt;&gt; I've heard that so much.\n\n403\n00:20:24.801 --> 00:20:27.953\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sure you have.\n\n404\n00:20:27.953 --> 00:20:32.616\nIf you've got the measurable goals that\nare binary, there's not think, no feel nor\n\n405\n00:20:32.616 --> 00:20:37.149\nopinion, they either got it or they\ndidn't, that takes out emotion, politics,\n\n406\n00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:40.774\npersonality, now it's not me versus\nthe other person on my team,\n\n407\n00:20:40.774 --> 00:20:44.078\nit's the entire team working\ntogether towards the goal, so\n\n408\n00:20:44.078 --> 00:20:48.398\nit's not me versus you, it's you and\nme together versus achieving the goal.\n\n409\n00:20:48.398 --> 00:20:50.805\nA big idea that helps\na team stay cohesive, and\n\n410\n00:20:50.805 --> 00:20:53.832\nyou can have some constructive\nconflict around that, but\n\n411\n00:20:53.832 --> 00:20:56.942\nit won't elevate all the way\ninto high levels of conflict.\n\n412\n00:20:56.942 --> 00:21:00.142\n&gt;&gt; And again, going back to\nthe other two points we've done so\n\n413\n00:21:00.142 --> 00:21:03.343\nfar before goals,\nit's about accountability again, and\n\n414\n00:21:03.343 --> 00:21:07.584\nmaking sure we get buy in from everybody\non the team about what these goals are.\n\n415\n00:21:07.584 --> 00:21:09.006\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you said it perfectly.\n\n416\n00:21:09.006 --> 00:21:12.103\nIt's about accountability,\nalignment, commitment, and clarity,\n\n417\n00:21:12.103 --> 00:21:15.654\nwe want to make sure that we're all moving\ntogether and we're all on the same team,\n\n418\n00:21:15.654 --> 00:21:18.163\nwhich brings me to the final one,\nand I'll do them again.\n\n419\n00:21:18.163 --> 00:21:21.286\nDirection shared, measurements binary,\ncompetent people,\n\n420\n00:21:21.286 --> 00:21:25.104\ncommunications are transparent,\nnow we're going mutual accountability,\n\n421\n00:21:25.104 --> 00:21:28.627\nwhere we're all holding each other\naccountable, and the last one is D,\n\n422\n00:21:28.627 --> 00:21:32.729\nthe discipline to actually make sure that\nyour team performs like this all the time,\n\n423\n00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:36.889\nthat they're on point, they're focused,\nthey've got those first five in order,\n\n424\n00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:40.370\nthey're doing them very well, and\nhere's what typically happens.\n\n425\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.845\nOn a mediocre team, a semi-dysfunctional\nteam, when there's an emergency, a fire,\n\n426\n00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:48.963\nthey can run together and they work great\ntogether, and they do all these things,\n\n427\n00:21:48.963 --> 00:21:53.440\nthey communicate, they help, everyone uses\ntheir expertise and they put out the fire,\n\n428\n00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.792\nand then they go back to\nbeing a mediocre team.\n\n429\n00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:59.905\nOn a high performance team, 90% of\nthe time they operate at high performance,\n\n430\n00:21:59.905 --> 00:22:02.588\nthey're doing really well,\ngreat communication,\n\n431\n00:22:02.588 --> 00:22:04.214\nall the things we talked about.\n\n432\n00:22:04.214 --> 00:22:08.436\n10% of the time they'll start to fail and\nnot do as well and then they pull\n\n433\n00:22:08.436 --> 00:22:12.740\nthemselves right back up because of\nthe discipline around this on the team.\n\n434\n00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.841\n&gt;&gt; All right, so John,\nnow we hive a high performance team and\n\n435\n00:22:15.841 --> 00:22:18.763\nwe're about to set goals, so\nwhat does that look like?\n\n436\n00:22:18.763 --> 00:22:23.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, basically what we're doing here\nis creating a strategic plan for the team,\n\n437\n00:22:23.335 --> 00:22:27.011\nand just like any strategic plan,\nthere's a general framework.\n\n438\n00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:30.577\nIf you're going to set a strategy, the\nfirst thing is to have your clear vision,\n\n439\n00:22:30.577 --> 00:22:32.896\nyour purpose,\nwhat's the direction for the team?\n\n440\n00:22:32.896 --> 00:22:36.687\nAnd we've talked about that many times,\nbecause without a clear direction,\n\n441\n00:22:36.687 --> 00:22:38.823\nthere's no way the team can be successful.\n\n442\n00:22:38.823 --> 00:22:42.014\nOnce you've got that overall purpose,\nthe outcome you wanna get to,\n\n443\n00:22:42.014 --> 00:22:45.872\nthen you wanna back up and say, all right,\nwhat are three or four major objectives?\n\n444\n00:22:45.872 --> 00:22:50.454\nWhat are key, fundamental elements\nof making sure we can deliver this?\n\n445\n00:22:50.454 --> 00:22:54.523\nSo you wanna break it into three or fours\nsort of subprojects within the entire\n\n446\n00:22:54.523 --> 00:22:58.843\nproject, what I call major objectives,\nunder each one of those major objectives\n\n447\n00:22:58.843 --> 00:23:03.162\nthen is when we start setting clear goals,\nand there's, again, a framework for\n\n448\n00:23:03.162 --> 00:23:06.043\nthis, there's frameworks for\nall these things, and\n\n449\n00:23:06.043 --> 00:23:10.650\nprobably one you've heard before is smart\ngoals, and here's what smart stands for.\n\n450\n00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.725\nThe S stands for specific,\nclear measurable, key result areas, and\n\n451\n00:23:15.725 --> 00:23:21.329\nagain, binary, so you want very specific,\nclear goals with no ambiguity.\n\n452\n00:23:21.329 --> 00:23:25.744\nThe M stands for measurable,\nwe wanna put numbers on that, due dates,\n\n453\n00:23:25.744 --> 00:23:30.305\neverything we can do to make sure,\nagain, that there's no guessing, so\n\n454\n00:23:30.305 --> 00:23:32.824\nthere's specific with measurements.\n\n455\n00:23:32.824 --> 00:23:36.696\nThe A stands for, and I changed this\none a little bit, is agreed upon,\n\n456\n00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:40.501\na lot of other folks would use the word\nattainable, I think on a team,\n\n457\n00:23:40.501 --> 00:23:43.456\nif we're all gonna work\ntowards a goal together, and\n\n458\n00:23:43.456 --> 00:23:47.161\nwe're all gonna be on the same team,\nwe need to agree on the goals.\n\n459\n00:23:47.161 --> 00:23:51.775\nThe R stands for reasonable, and this\nis where you look at it and say, can I\n\n460\n00:23:51.775 --> 00:23:56.987\nactually achieve this goal, am I willing\nto commit to it, do I have the resources,\n\n461\n00:23:56.987 --> 00:24:01.392\ndo I have the people, do I have\nthe technology, do I have enough time?\n\n462\n00:24:01.392 --> 00:24:05.446\nAnd if someone tries to assign or create\na goal that's just unreasonable, then it\n\n463\n00:24:05.446 --> 00:24:09.697\nautomatically puts people frustrated, it\nputs the team pitted against each other.\n\n464\n00:24:09.697 --> 00:24:12.675\nAnd of course they're not gonna be able\nto deliver an unreasonable goal, so\n\n465\n00:24:12.675 --> 00:24:14.960\nit's gonna hurt the team\nprogress all the way.\n\n466\n00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.410\nAnd then last but not least is time down.\n\n467\n00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.510\nIt's gotta have a due date.\n\n468\n00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:25.350\nA goal without a due date is just a wish,\nhoping that we can implement our strategy.\n\n469\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.727\nAnd as I like to say,\nhope is not a strategy.\n\n470\n00:24:27.727 --> 00:24:31.466\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I feel like a broken\nrecord here talking about accountability,\n\n471\n00:24:31.466 --> 00:24:34.695\nbut once we've created these goals\nas a team and used those models,\n\n472\n00:24:34.695 --> 00:24:36.500\nwho's accountable for the goals?\n\n473\n00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.870\nIs it just the leader of\nthe team that's accountable?\n\n474\n00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.900\nOr every individual has goals\nthat they're accountable for.\n\n475\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.096\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what we're going to do is,\nthe leader of the team is accountable for\n\n476\n00:24:45.096 --> 00:24:47.690\nthe overall success of\nthe project no matter what.\n\n477\n00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.460\nThere always has to be one person that's\naccountable for delivering the outcome.\n\n478\n00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.491\nBut now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to be assigning accountability\n\n479\n00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:59.335\nto different people on the team to finish\ntheir goals that go up to the major\n\n480\n00:24:59.335 --> 00:25:00.089\nobjectives.\n\n481\n00:25:00.089 --> 00:25:01.485\nI've got a major objective here,\n\n482\n00:25:01.485 --> 00:25:04.600\nsomething that's core to the strategy\nof achieving what we want.\n\n483\n00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.760\nUnderneath that I'm gonna\nhave a set of goals, and\n\n484\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.610\nthen each one of those goals will have\none person who's accountable for it.\n\n485\n00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.830\nAnd one of the reasons I think that's\ncritical is, is I want the person who's\n\n486\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:20.920\naccountable for it to actually set\nthe tasks and the action steps themselves.\n\n487\n00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.460\nAgain, I want them to own it.\n\n488\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.990\nSo instead of saying this is your goal and\nthis is when it's due and here's\n\n489\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.040\nthe actions I want you to take, we agree\nthis is the goal, this is when it's due.\n\n490\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.330\nAnd then I'm, as the one is has to\nimplement it, is gonna sit down and\n\n491\n00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.170\ncreate a little plan to say all right,\nhere's what I need to do.\n\n492\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.070\nHere's the resources.\n\n493\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.650\nHere's my own timeline.\n\n494\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:44.480\nHere's my project milestones so that I can\nfigure out specifically which tasks and\n\n495\n00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.370\naction steps make sense to allow\nme to achieve what I need to do on\n\n496\n00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.670\nthe task I've been assigned that\nI'm taking full accountability for.\n\n497\n00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.642\n&gt;&gt; Great, okay so\nwe've covered a lot in this episode.\n\n498\n00:25:55.642 --> 00:25:57.794\nCan you kind of wrap things up for us and\n\n499\n00:25:57.794 --> 00:26:01.120\ngive us some final\nthoughts to remember here?\n\n500\n00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think when you\nlook at setting the goals for\n\n501\n00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.000\nthe team, there's a couple of key ideas.\n\n502\n00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.182\nNumber one, it's got to have full\nalignment on the outcome, the deliverable.\n\n503\n00:26:09.182 --> 00:26:12.592\nWhatever the sponsor has tasked you with,\nwe got to clearly understand,\n\n504\n00:26:12.592 --> 00:26:15.460\nthis is what the entire team\nneeds to do to get there.\n\n505\n00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.390\nYou wanna look at those six key elements\nof a high performance team, and\n\n506\n00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.320\nI'm gonna especially\nemphasize the communication.\n\n507\n00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.190\nThe transparent communication,\nhelping each other, sharing lots of stuff.\n\n508\n00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:29.500\nAnd then last but not least, you've gotta\nmake sure that if you're gonna get there,\n\n509\n00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.610\nyou've gotta have a high level of\naccountability, of mutual accountability,\n\n510\n00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.025\nacross the entire team.\n\n511\n00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:35.846\nTo actually deliver what\nyou promised to deliver.\n\n512\n00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:40.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, great John, I appreciate it\nand that's a lot of great information,\n\n513\n00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.840\nbut also a good spot for us to go\nahead and wrap up for this episode.\n\n514\n00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.725\nSo, we're going to go ahead and\nsign off for Biz Pro TV.\n\n515\n00:26:46.725 --> 00:26:48.194\nI'm your host Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n516\n00:26:48.194 --> 00:26:51.102\nI'm John Spence, and\nwe'll see you next

Peter VanRysdam,\n\n4\n00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:12.067\nand today we're continuing in our\nseries about leading technology teams.\n\n5\n00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:16.375\nAnd we're specifically talking about,\nhow to develop a team and it's culture.\n\n6\n00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:19.115\nAnd here to help us, we are very\nfortunate to have Mr John Spence.\n\n7\n00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:19.815\nJohn, how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:20.695\n&gt;&gt; Great, Peter, and you?\n\n9\n00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:22.645\n&gt;&gt; I'm fantastic, thank you.\n\n10\n00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:23.174\nI think,\n\n11\n00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:27.681\na great place to start here is just how do\nwe define culture as it relates to a team?\n\n12\n00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well it's an interesting thing.\n\n13\n00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.935\nThere's some people that say\nthat culture just emerges.\n\n14\n00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:38.170\nIt's the way the folks on the team act,\nand treat each other and behave.\n\n15\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.130\nSo, at its basis, culture's all\nabout how do we do work together,\n\n16\n00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.910\nhow will we treat each other,\nwhat's the main motivators for our team.\n\n17\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.260\nSo, it's a lot around,\nthis is the way we're gonna act, and\n\n18\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.550\nbehave with each other, with our clients,\nour customers, our sponsors.\n\n19\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.910\nThis is the way we do business together.\n\n20\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nNow, why is it very important for\n\n21\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.440\nus to have a culture that's so\ngreat in a team.\n\n22\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.970\nI mean, it sounds like\na loaded question there, but\n\n23\n00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.080\nit's not something we should just take for\ngranted.\n\n24\n00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.790\n&gt;&gt; No.\nIt's not something you can take for\n\n25\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.770\ngranted, and here's why.\n\n26\n00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.260\nIn my 20 years of working with companies\nall over the world, there's place,\n\n27\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.830\nyou can look at them, and they might\nbe able to improve their manufacturing\n\n28\n00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100\na little bi,t or buy some new equipment,\nor new technology,\n\n29\n00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.520\nor maybe capture a little bit more market\nshare, but the single greatest place\n\n30\n00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.940\nthat makes, or breaks most\norganizations is their culture.\n\n31\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.760\nPeter Drucker, who's one of the most\nfamous management gurus of all time,\n\n32\n00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.020\nsaid culture each strategy for breakfast.\n\n33\n00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.260\nYou can have great equipment.\n\n34\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.490\nYou can have a cool strategy.\n\n35\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.610\nYou can even have good people, but\nif you have a dysfunctional culture\n\n36\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.040\nthey will not deliver the business\nresults that are needed.\n\n37\n00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.370\nSo, a strong positive culture is one of\nthe major drivers of success on a team and\n\n38\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.050\nin an entire organization.\n\n39\n00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.170\n&gt;&gt; So, it's kind of the bottom\nof the pyramid, if you will,\n\n40\n00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.150\nin terms of the foundation for the rest\nof those ingredients in a business.\n\n41\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.540\nNow, when you're creating these teams,\nand putting them together,\n\n42\n00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.000\nwe've talked a lot in previous episodes\nabout setting goals and things like that.\n\n43\n00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.220\nWho sets this culture?\n\n44\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.370\nIs it organic, does it set itself?\n\n45\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.560\nOr is it something that's\nagreed upon with the team?\n\n46\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.460\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely fantastic question.\n\n47\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.040\nThere are some people, and\n\n48\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.000\nI mentioned this briefly earlier, that\nsay that team culture's just discovered.\n\n49\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.570\nThat it shapes itself.\n\n50\n00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.710\nThat the people on the team\ncreate the culture.\n\n51\n00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.180\nAnd, I think, to some degree that's true.\n\n52\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.900\nBut, I also think,\n\n53\n00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.370\nthat the team leader has the opportunity\nto set some standards around the culture.\n\n54\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.660\nAround trust, respect, communication,\nthings like that, that are non negotiable.\n\n55\n00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.520\nThat these are gonna be\npart of our culture.\n\n56\n00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.880\nWe're gonna treat each other like family,\nwe're gonna have fun, and\n\n57\n00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.730\nI'm gonna give you some\nmore examples on this.\n\n58\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.170\nSo, I think it's two ways, Peter.\n\n59\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.790\nI think, that partially the team\njust creates the culture\n\n60\n00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.860\nby the way they treat each other, and\nthe way they want to do business together.\n\n61\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.470\nBut, I also believe,\n\n62\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.310\nthat the team leader has an opportunity\nto set some fundamental,\n\n63\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.700\ncore values on the culture that everyone\non the team has to follow those.\n\n64\n00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.140\nWhether they got to choose them or not,\n\n65\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.680\nbecause it's just the way\nany team must work together.\n\n66\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.670\n&gt;&gt; And while it's great to write some\nof those things down, I imagine,\n\n67\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.830\nsome of that could also be just set\nby the leader leading by example.\n\n68\n00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.810\nI think, a lot of people might look to\nthe leader and say, are we having fun?\n\n69\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.450\nIs it okay to crack some jokes, or\nare we strictly business here with this?\n\n70\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.535\nSo, the leader kind of sets\nthe culture in how they act as well.\n\n71\n00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:30.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's in the behavior\nof everyone on the team.\n\n72\n00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.700\nAnd culture in large part is defined\nby what is accepted on the team, or\n\n73\n00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.920\nwhat is punished on the team.\n\n74\n00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.010\nAnd another reason they\ncall it leadership is\n\n75\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.810\npeople are going to follow the lead\nof the head person on the team.\n\n76\n00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.920\nThey drive the culture a lot by what they\naccept, what they punish, who they put\n\n77\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.640\nin specific positions, who they reward,\nbased on their actions and behaviors.\n\n78\n00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.690\nSo, in a large part there, the leader\ndoes set the standard for the culture.\n\n79\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.248\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo, you mentioned you have some examples,\n\n80\n00:04:01.248 --> 00:04:02.950\nso walk us through those.\n\n81\n00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, Peter, I've got a couple of\nexamples I want to share with you.\n\n82\n00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.710\nThe first one is based on a research study\nI did several years ago of 10,000 high\n\n83\n00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.450\npotential employees at top\ncompanies around the world.\n\n84\n00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.920\nThese are employees that are so\n\n85\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.830\ngood at what they do,\nI call them voluntary employees.\n\n86\n00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.820\nIn other words, they've got options.\n\n87\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.710\nIf they decided at 10 o'clock, well\nactually I have a young lady I work with\n\n88\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.700\nat Microsoft that decided one day she\nwasn't happy in her job, wasn't getting\n\n89\n00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.680\nthe career promotions she wanted to get,\nand sort of let a head hunter, or\n\n90\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.360\ntwo know about it and by the next day\nshe was a Vice President at Amazon.\n\n91\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.740\nSo, these are folks that go to work,\nbecause they want to at this company not,\n\n92\n00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.770\nbecause they have to.\n\n93\n00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.950\nBecause if they didn't like it they\ncould just get a job at the competition\n\n94\n00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.320\nwith in a day or two.\n\n95\n00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.590\nSo, when I asked them this question,\nwhy do you work where you work.\n\n96\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.730\nBecause they could work\nanywhere they wanted to work.\n\n97\n00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.420\nWhy did they choose to come\nin to that they chose?\n\n98\n00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.340\nAnd a lot of it was around culture.\n\n99\n00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.880\nAnd there were six key things.\n\n100\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.680\nAnd the first one is one that you may or\n\n101\n00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.460\nmay not have control of in your team,\nwhich is fair pay.\n\n102\n00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.950\nAs long as they've got what they\ncall a reasonable pay, fair pay,\n\n103\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.335\nthey've got parity on pay,\n\n104\n00:05:06.335 --> 00:05:10.320\n10% above or below what they would make\nto do the same job any place else.\n\n105\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.770\nThen pay came off\nthe table as a motivator.\n\n106\n00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.930\nSo, that maybe an organizational decision,\n\n107\n00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.140\nor you might be able to impact\nthat somewhat as the team leader.\n\n108\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.230\nThe next thing they said,\nis I wanna work with cool colleagues.\n\n109\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.730\nI wanna work with a players, only want\nto be on a team with other a players.\n\n110\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.960\nAnd if you're going to build\na high performance team they want\n\n111\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.430\nto be surrounded by other bright,\nsharp, smart talented people\n\n112\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.140\nthat are good at what they do,\nthat are cool and highly competent.\n\n113\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.620\nThe next thing was challenging and\nmeaningful work.\n\n114\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.890\nI want to come in everyday, and\nfeel like I'm using my full brain power.\n\n115\n00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.850\nI'm dong things that are fun and\ninteresting, and engaging, and\n\n116\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.250\nexciting, challenging me to be smarter,\nto be innovative, to be creative,\n\n117\n00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.710\nto improve my expertise.\n\n118\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.060\nThe next one was winning culture, and\n\n119\n00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.970\nthat's what we're going to talk about\nin even more detail in just a second.\n\n120\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.640\nBut they want to be someplace where\nit's got a strong supportive culture.\n\n121\n00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.190\nThe last two were really\nfascinating to me.\n\n122\n00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.150\nThe next one is personal and\nprofessional growth.\n\n123\n00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.020\nWhat they said to me is I want to know\n\n124\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.680\nthat at the end of the month I'm\nsmarter than I was at the beginning.\n\n125\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.480\nThat my company is investing in mentors,\nand coaches, and training, and support,\n\n126\n00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.800\nand giving me opportunities to grow, and\nget better, and better at what I do.\n\n127\n00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.460\nThat I'm constantly improving my\nprofessional skills, personal improvement.\n\n128\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.930\nThe other thing was professional growth.\n\n129\n00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.300\nAnd that says, can I look up in this\ncompany, in this team, and see a place for\n\n130\n00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.180\nme three, four, five,\nten years from today?\n\n131\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.380\nIf a really talented person feels like\nthey're not learning anything new,\n\n132\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.900\nthey're not improving, and\nthey can't see a place for\n\n133\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.100\nthemselves in the organization a few years\nout, they will leave us fast as they can.\n\n134\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.700\nAnd then the last one,\nwhich is actually the most important one,\n\n135\n00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.835\nPeter, was I worked for\na leader, I respect and admire.\n\n136\n00:06:51.835 --> 00:06:54.270\n88% of people are quit their job.\n\n137\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.560\nDon't quit the job, don't quit the hours,\ndon't quit the pay,\n\n138\n00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.630\ndon't quit the workload,\nthey quit their idiot boss.\n\n139\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.740\nAnd on a team, that's a team leader,\nif they have a team leader,\n\n140\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.200\nthey don't respect, admire and trust.\n\n141\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.127\nYou're not going to get a high\nperformer to be fully engaged.\n\n142\n00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, John, so\nthat's the first model.\n\n143\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.420\nYou said you had a couple examples?\n\n144\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.260\nWhat's the next model?\n\n145\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThe next model I want to share with you\n\n146\n00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.300\ncomes from a Gallup poll of\n23 million American workers.\n\n147\n00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.950\nThe great places to work study,\nand the firms of endearment study.\n\n148\n00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.590\nAnd when I looked at all of those and\nput them together,\n\n149\n00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.355\nthere's basically nine core elements\npeople look for in a winning culture.\n\n150\n00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:28.860\nCuz we just said that top talent,\n\n151\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.360\none of the most important things\nthey want from a company,\n\n152\n00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.910\nthey would willingly work at when they\nwant to go to is a winning culture.\n\n153\n00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:35.580\nSo, here they are.\n\n154\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.800\nThe first one is fun.\n\n155\n00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.070\nI want to enjoy the work I do.\n\n156\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.130\nI want to have a good time.\n\n157\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.180\nNow, this doesn't mean that we've got\nwhoopee cushions under all of the seats,\n\n158\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.190\nor we're constantly pranking each other.\n\n159\n00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.050\nBut it is an enjoyable place to work, and\nthere is a real clear measure for this.\n\n160\n00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.029\nDo people smile just as much when\nthey come to work as when they leave?\n\n161\n00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:55.139\nIf people are excited when they get\nout of their car, they're walking and\n\n162\n00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:58.503\nthey're looking forward to seeing\nthe other people, looking forward to doing\n\n163\n00:07:58.503 --> 00:08:01.110\ntheir work, and at the end of\nthe day they're still smiling,\n\n164\n00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.947\nthen you've got a good,\nfun culture as part of a winning culture.\n\n165\n00:08:03.947 --> 00:08:06.771\nThe next one is a family atmosphere.\n\n166\n00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:09.880\nI want to feel like the people at work\ntruly care about me as an individual.\n\n167\n00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.860\nI'm not just a cog in the machine,\njust a number,\n\n168\n00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.700\nbut they ask me how my weekend was.\n\n169\n00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.904\nThey want to know if my wife feels better,\nif she had a cold.\n\n170\n00:08:17.904 --> 00:08:19.950\nOr how my kid's soccer game was.\n\n171\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.410\nSo they genuinely care about each other\nand we treat each other like a family.\n\n172\n00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.720\nWe take care of each other.\n\n173\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.192\nAnd you can see in teamwork this is\nexceedingly important to make sure that\n\n174\n00:08:28.192 --> 00:08:30.824\neverybody's bonded enough and\nlikes each other enough\n\n175\n00:08:30.824 --> 00:08:33.680\nthat they care genuinely about\nthe other people on the team.\n\n176\n00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.411\nWhich brings me to number three,\nalso important for\n\n177\n00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:38.157\nteamwork Is I work with friends.\n\n178\n00:08:38.157 --> 00:08:41.880\nSo it's a fun place to work with a family\natmosphere, where I work with my friends,\n\n179\n00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.640\noften times my best friend.\n\n180\n00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.950\nNow, that doesn't mean you've got to be\nfriends with everybody in the company.\n\n181\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.822\nThere might be a few jerks there.\n\n182\n00:08:48.822 --> 00:08:50.960\nBut, for the most part,\nI like the people I work with.\n\n183\n00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.350\nI would consider them my friends.\n\n184\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.488\nAnd I would consider a few of them\nsome of my very best friends.\n\n185\n00:08:55.488 --> 00:08:57.670\nThe next one is freedom.\n\n186\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.570\nAnd that means that I get the tools,\nthe resources,\n\n187\n00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.620\nthe support I need and\nthen the freedom to go out and do my job.\n\n188\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.250\nTo do the things on the team I'm\nsupposed to do without micromanagement\n\n189\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.120\nfrom the leader of the team.\n\n190\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.210\nThe next one is fair.\n\n191\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.960\nAnd this is exceedingly\nimportant also on a team.\n\n192\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.310\nAnd fair is not about pay.\n\n193\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.994\nI mentioned that, that pay is 10% above or\nbelow then it's off the table.\n\n194\n00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:21.035\nWhat we're talking about\nhere is the rules are fair.\n\n195\n00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:24.640\nThe workload is fair at some level,\nI'm not doing everybody's work for them.\n\n196\n00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.700\nBut the most important thing is,\nif there's a problem, an issue or\n\n197\n00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.960\na challenge, my voice will be heard.\n\n198\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.815\nI will be treated fairly.\n\n199\n00:09:31.815 --> 00:09:35.280\nSo we're gonna start with it's a fun\nplace to work with a family atmosphere,\n\n200\n00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.930\nwhere I work with my friends, where\nI have the freedom to do my job well.\n\n201\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.794\nAnd I'm treated fairly.\n\n202\n00:09:40.794 --> 00:09:44.549\n&gt;&gt; All right John so you said there were\nnine elements that looks like five so\n\n203\n00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:46.580\nfar so what are the four remaining?\n\n204\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.830\n&gt;&gt; The final four, the next one is pride.\n\n205\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.770\nI take proud in the organization I work\nfor, I'm proud to hand out the card, or\n\n206\n00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.400\nwear the logo on my shirt.\n\n207\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.710\nAnd from a team aspect,\nI'm proud to be on this team.\n\n208\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.250\nWe're a high performance team.\n\n209\n00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.960\nAnd other people in the organization\nlook up to us for the work we do and\n\n210\n00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.960\nhow well we all get along.\n\n211\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.270\nThe next one is praise, and\nthis is a tough one Peter, because it's\n\n212\n00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:12.410\nsome sort of genuine, honest, sincere\npraise once every seven to ten days.\n\n213\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.980\nAnd I know all the team\nleaders out there are going\n\n214\n00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.391\nI'd have to be out all day\nlong talking to my team.\n\n215\n00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:19.150\nAnd if you're highly analytical.\n\n216\n00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.745\nThis does not mean you put it on your\ncalendar or your outlook and once every\n\n217\n00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:25.870\nten days you go to your team and go you\nguys are awesome, I love you, great team.\n\n218\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.770\nThat's not the way it works, but\nhere's how to make it better.\n\n219\n00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.730\nIn most organizations when you do\nsomething wrong somebody is there to\n\n220\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.170\npoint it out rather quickly.\n\n221\n00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.410\nThey're happy to do that,\nalso in most organizations,\n\n222\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.060\nif you do something right,\nnobody says anything about that at all.\n\n223\n00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.030\nWhat I suggest is within your team,\n\n224\n00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.550\nyou create a culture of catching\neach other doing things right.\n\n225\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.722\nThat you're constantly looking for\nopportunities to praise your other\n\n226\n00:10:50.722 --> 00:10:54.206\nteam members, to tell them they're doing\na great, give them a pat on the back,\n\n227\n00:10:54.206 --> 00:10:57.809\nsend them a hand written note or give them\na hand written note or send them an email.\n\n228\n00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:01.806\nSo it's not just the team leaders job to\npraise everybody, but you're all looking\n\n229\n00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:06.070\nto help each other out all day long and\ncatch each other doing things right.\n\n230\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.210\nI think this is especially important for\njob satisfaction.\n\n231\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.060\nThis means that if you've got\na team culture of catching each\n\n232\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.660\nother doing things right,\nthat when you get up in the morning.\n\n233\n00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.504\nAnd you're headed off to work that you\nknow that you're gonna have an opportunity\n\n234\n00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:23.406\ntoday to catch someone else on your team\ndoing something good, something right and\n\n235\n00:11:23.406 --> 00:11:25.706\ngive them some honest praise and\nmake their day.\n\n236\n00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:28.715\nThat also means that everyone else on\nyour team is trying to catch you do\n\n237\n00:11:28.715 --> 00:11:30.250\nsomething right and make your day.\n\n238\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.671\nAnd to me that's a pretty exciting\nway to go to work everyday.\n\n239\n00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:35.400\nThe last two are interesting.\n\n240\n00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.740\nThe first ones I just went over,\nit's fun, family, friends,\n\n241\n00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.300\npride, praise, meaning, freedom.\n\n242\n00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.790\nAll the ones I just covered.\n\n243\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.592\nThose had been like that for about 20\nyears and in just the last four or\n\n244\n00:11:46.592 --> 00:11:50.151\nfive years, thank you millennials,\ntwo new ones join the list.\n\n245\n00:11:50.151 --> 00:11:52.030\nMeaning and accomplishment.\n\n246\n00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.210\nMeaning, I want to do something\nthat's important, and\n\n247\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.190\nfrom a millennial stand point they\nsay I want to change the world.\n\n248\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.320\nBut I want to know that the work\nI do on this team is important.\n\n249\n00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.490\nIt's meaningful, it makes an impact.\n\n250\n00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:09.950\nAnd sometimes people have menial tasks on\na team, let's just be honest about that.\n\n251\n00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.036\nAnd if that's the case, and the work\nthey're doing is not super meaningful,\n\n252\n00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:14.931\nthen maybe they'll look\nto the organization.\n\n253\n00:12:14.931 --> 00:12:16.311\nOr maybe the team decides,\n\n254\n00:12:16.311 --> 00:12:19.491\nwe're gonna go out as a team and\nwalk in the breast cancer walk,\n\n255\n00:12:19.491 --> 00:12:23.860\nor we're gonna raise some money as a team\nfor the local children's hospital.\n\n256\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.697\nSo maybe the work I'm doing on the team\nisn't that meaningful, but my team is\n\n257\n00:12:27.697 --> 00:12:31.969\ndoing meaningful things that I feel good\nabout, and that we're making a big impact.\n\n258\n00:12:31.969 --> 00:12:33.970\nThen the last one is accomplishment.\n\n259\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.600\nAnd what accomplishment says is,\nI wanna be able to point to someone and\n\n260\n00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.610\nsay that's my work.\n\n261\n00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.340\nI did that.\n\n262\n00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.680\nI wanna be able to look at someone and\n\n263\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.569\nsay I'm not just passing\nthings around the team.\n\n264\n00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:47.004\nAnd I'm not just either shuffling papers,\nbut I do meaningful work and I create that\n\n265\n00:12:47.004 --> 00:12:51.010\nwork and I can point at it and\nsay that's my work and I'm proud of it.\n\n266\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.770\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n267\n00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.980\nNow it sounds like most of that is\nwhat the employee is looking for\n\n268\n00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.570\nin a company which makes a lot of sense.\n\n269\n00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.358\nI think a lot of people that might be\nwatching this video are also kind of in\n\n270\n00:13:00.358 --> 00:13:01.056\nboth roles here.\n\n271\n00:13:01.056 --> 00:13:03.670\nThey're the leaders as well or\nsomeone who is putting together that team.\n\n272\n00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:09.102\nSo what does a company look for\nin the employees as a to these models.\n\n273\n00:13:09.102 --> 00:13:12.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you make a good point there\nbecause culture is really two sided.\n\n274\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.430\nYou've got the culture\nthat the employees want.\n\n275\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.310\nWhich we just talked about.\n\n276\n00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.490\nThat winning culture.\n\n277\n00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.530\nBut you've also got the culture\nthat the company wants, and\n\n278\n00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.890\nI can basically bring that\ndown to one key word.\n\n279\n00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.340\nThey want folks with\nan ownership mentality.\n\n280\n00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.210\nThey want folks that are proactive.\n\n281\n00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.490\nThat are creative and innovative,\nconstantly improving.\n\n282\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:36.386\nAnd, again, based on a big research study,\nthere's four major things they look for\n\n283\n00:13:36.386 --> 00:13:40.482\nfrom the organizational standpoint\nof a culture of a really good team.\n\n284\n00:13:40.482 --> 00:13:42.770\nThe first one is really good goal setting.\n\n285\n00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.500\nExactly what we talked about in one of the\nother modules, is you've gotta have clear,\n\n286\n00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.550\nspecific, measurable goals.\n\n287\n00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.438\nAnd the team needs to be outstanding\nat setting and achieving goals.\n\n288\n00:13:52.438 --> 00:13:56.000\nThe next one is high levels of trust,\nabsolutely essential.\n\n289\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.560\nThe next one is lots of\ngood communications.\n\n290\n00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.350\nOpen, honest, robust transparent.\n\n291\n00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.010\nYou've heard this over and over again.\n\n292\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.720\nBecause without good communications,\nyou cannot have an effective team, period.\n\n293\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.120\nAnd then the last one is having\na high level of accountability\n\n294\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.510\nto deliver the business results\nthey promised they would deliver.\n\n295\n00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.338\nAnd, again, the perfect word to phrase\nall this up is, ownership mentality.\n\n296\n00:14:17.338 --> 00:14:20.518\n&gt;&gt; John you kind of went through\nthose pretty quick and I know trust\n\n297\n00:14:20.518 --> 00:14:24.299\nis something we've talked about a lot\nin previous episodes on a team here.\n\n298\n00:14:24.299 --> 00:14:26.270\nSo, can we dive into that\none a little bit more?\n\n299\n00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:31.284\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, trust is one of those things\nthat's hard to build and easy to lose.\n\n300\n00:14:31.284 --> 00:14:33.954\nAnd when you look at\nbuilding trust there's,\n\n301\n00:14:33.954 --> 00:14:37.730\nI built a model around this what\nI call the four C's of trust.\n\n302\n00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.300\nThe four C's of trust and\nare the four C's are this,\n\n303\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:45.370\nyou must consistently communicate\nthat you are confident and you care.\n\n304\n00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.759\nConsistently communicate that\nyou are confident and you care.\n\n305\n00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:51.742\nAnd there's only four levels around this.\n\n306\n00:14:51.742 --> 00:14:56.361\nOne of the levels is someone with\nhigh competence but low concern.\n\n307\n00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:57.440\nThey're really good at what they do.\n\n308\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.360\nThey're technically experts,\nthey really understand their stuff but\n\n309\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.170\nthey don't care about\nanybody else on the team.\n\n310\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:07.092\nJust not connected, not important,\nnot family atmosphere, not friendly.\n\n311\n00:15:07.092 --> 00:15:11.810\nThe word I use for that sort of person\nis respect, I respect their expertise.\n\n312\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.501\nI respect their talent and\ntheir skill, their knowledge, but\n\n313\n00:15:14.501 --> 00:15:17.920\nI do not trust them because I know they\ndon't like me or anybody else on the team.\n\n314\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.850\nThey don't care about me.\n\n315\n00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.700\nAnother way you can look at it,\nthat another one would be low confidence,\n\n316\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.340\nlow concern.\n\n317\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.679\nI'm incompetent and\nI don't care about the team.\n\n318\n00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:28.050\nI work at the post office.\n\n319\n00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:28.870\nNo just kidding.\n\n320\n00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.768\nI was actually teaching at\nthe post office years ago and\n\n321\n00:15:31.768 --> 00:15:34.920\none of the guys said hey\nthat sounds we don't care.\n\n322\n00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.860\nSo let's move on to the next one.\n\n323\n00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.960\nThis is high concern but low competence.\n\n324\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.327\nThis is somebody on your team\nyou love they're awesome.\n\n325\n00:15:42.327 --> 00:15:42.856\nThey're friendly.\n\n326\n00:15:42.856 --> 00:15:45.162\nTake them out for a barbeque.\n\n327\n00:15:45.162 --> 00:15:46.908\nYou enjoy yourself.\n\n328\n00:15:46.908 --> 00:15:50.637\nYou love this person but unfortunately\nthey're not competent, which means you and\n\n329\n00:15:50.637 --> 00:15:53.330\nthe other teams members have to\ndo all of their work for them.\n\n330\n00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.394\nYou are constantly cleaning\nup behind them and\n\n331\n00:15:56.394 --> 00:15:58.221\n&gt;&gt; That's hopefully somebody you can find\n\n332\n00:15:58.221 --> 00:15:59.408\na new role on the team for.\n\n333\n00:15:59.408 --> 00:16:02.888\nCuz if you're such a great team player and\nyou fit the culture, you really want that\n\n334\n00:16:02.888 --> 00:16:06.186\nperson, but maybe some training or\nmaybe find a different position for them.\n\n335\n00:16:06.186 --> 00:16:09.026\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have a saying for\nthis in the South.\n\n336\n00:16:09.026 --> 00:16:11.785\nIt's when somebody says he's trying so\nhard, bless his heart.\n\n337\n00:16:11.785 --> 00:16:13.275\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In other words, hes an idiot.\n\n338\n00:16:13.275 --> 00:16:17.870\n[LAUGH] But that's the person that you,\nand when you look at that sort of stuff,\n\n339\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.760\nand we can look at situational\nleadership around this.\n\n340\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.250\nIf you've got someone\nthat's got high competence,\n\n341\n00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.200\nlow concern,\nthis is someone who needs a cheerleader.\n\n342\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.870\nYou're not gonna go in and\ntell them what to do and direct them and\n\n343\n00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.450\ncoach them on that.\n\n344\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:33.340\nYou're gonna get in there and\ntry to get that person who's got a high\n\n345\n00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.040\ncompetence and a low concern for the rest\nof the team motivated, excited, engaged.\n\n346\n00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.050\nThe reverse is this person,\nwho's got high concern and\n\n347\n00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.250\nlow competence,\nthey don't need a cheerleader.\n\n348\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.860\nCuz if you go come on, sis boom bah,\nyou just have a motivated idiot.\n\n349\n00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.020\nSo this one is the person that needs\na coach, a director, someone that says\n\n350\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.050\nI know you're motivated, you're excited,\nlet's work on your skill level.\n\n351\n00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.520\nLet's help you get better.\n\n352\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.900\nHere, let me give you some advice and\nmentoring and coaching.\n\n353\n00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.930\nWhich brings me to the last one,\nwhich is high competence, high concern.\n\n354\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.720\nThis is who you want on your teams, Peter.\n\n355\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.280\nThis is somebody who's really good\nat what they do, a highly talented,\n\n356\n00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.100\nhighly skilled, an expert, and\nthey care about the rest of the team.\n\n357\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.890\nThey're committed to the team,\nthey're committed to the project.\n\n358\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.390\nThey're committed to the outcome,\nthey care about the rest of the people.\n\n359\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.780\nThey really,\nreally want that family atmosphere.\n\n360\n00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.520\nNow, I can summarize all of\nthis in one clear phrase.\n\n361\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.985\nIf you want somebody on your team who's\nreally good, who will build high trust,\n\n362\n00:17:23.985 --> 00:17:25.358\nthis is the phrase.\n\n363\n00:17:25.358 --> 00:17:29.300\nI'm good at what I do, and\nI do it because I care about you.\n\n364\n00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.420\nI'm extremely talented, I'm trying to get\nbetter everyday, I'm studying, learning,\n\n365\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.370\nI'm working.\n\n366\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.020\nAnd I do it all because I care about\nthe rest of the people on the team, and\n\n367\n00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.040\nI want the team to succeed.\n\n368\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, that makes sense.\n\n369\n00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.890\nNow, John,\nwe've spent the first 20 minutes or so\n\n370\n00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.200\nof this episode talking about how to\nbuild a great culture on your team.\n\n371\n00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.230\nBut I bet you can destroy\na great culture pretty quickly.\n\n372\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.590\nSo, what are some of thing\nwe wanna make sure we avoid?\n\n373\n00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.200\nWhat is it that can kill a culture?\n\n374\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.823\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, w ell, this is, I'm gonna\nshare with you another good colleague,\n\n375\n00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:55.640\nfriend of mine.\n\n376\n00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.050\nPatrick Lencioni wrote a great book\ncalled The Five Dysfunctions of a Team.\n\n377\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.750\nAnd this is probably the most famous\nframework around dysfunctional teams.\n\n378\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.590\nAnd there's five layers to it, and\nhe sorta describes it in a pyramid,\n\n379\n00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.140\nfrom a base that goes up.\n\n380\n00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.400\nSo, the base of the pyramid is lack\nof trust, what we just talked about.\n\n381\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.318\nAnd the hard thing about trust,\nI mentioned it briefly earlier,\n\n382\n00:18:15.318 --> 00:18:18.820\nis it takes weeks, months, or\nyears to build up and seconds to lose.\n\n383\n00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:23.550\nSo that building that foundation of\nstrong trust on a team is essential.\n\n384\n00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.760\nSo a dysfunctional team\nhas a lack of that trust.\n\n385\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.690\nThe next one is lack of candor.\n\n386\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.970\nAnother word I like to use\nthere is vulnerability.\n\n387\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.040\nBecause I don't really trust the other\npeople on the team too much,\n\n388\n00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.320\nI'm afraid to be vulnerable or\nto speak my mind or\n\n389\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.630\nto challenge someone else's idea\nbecause I don't want retribution.\n\n390\n00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.066\nAnd I don't want to share my ideas,\ncuz I don't want to look stupid.\n\n391\n00:18:45.066 --> 00:18:49.380\nSo I sit in a meeting and things come up\nthat I'm concerned about with the team,\n\n392\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.670\nbut because I don't really trust\neverybody else, I don't say anything.\n\n393\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.870\nWhich leads to the third one,\nwhich is lack of commitment.\n\n394\n00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:59.060\nWe're in the meeting, we're talking,\nI don't have a high enough level of trust.\n\n395\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.600\nI'm not really sharing my ideas.\n\n396\n00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.950\nI'm not being open, and\nhonest, and vulnerable.\n\n397\n00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.790\nAnd the team wants to commit to something\nthat I think is the stupidest idea\n\n398\n00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.450\nI've ever heard of in my life.\n\n399\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.400\nAnd then they go around the table and they\ngo, what do you think about that, Peter?\n\n400\n00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.100\nAnd Peter goes, I love it!\n\n401\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.570\nWhat do you think about that, Taylor?\n\n402\n00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.710\nWhat do you think about that, Megan?\n\n403\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.400\nIt's fantastic!\n\n404\n00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.990\nThey get to you and they go,\nwhat do you think, John?\n\n405\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.240\nAnd you go, love it, love it,\ngreat, great, great!\n\n406\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.400\nLove that!\nAnd then what happens?\n\n407\n00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.130\nDo you have the meeting after the meeting\nwhere you go out to the parking lot and\n\n408\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.740\nyou're talking to one of your, that's the\nstupidest idea I've ever heard in my life!\n\n409\n00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.900\nSo we've got lack of trust\nleads to lack of candor or\n\n410\n00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.670\nvulnerability, which leads\nto lack of commitment.\n\n411\n00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.150\n&gt;&gt; And\nI remember you said something earlier,\n\n412\n00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.700\nthat you can attack ideas\nwithout attacking people.\n\n413\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.380\nSo, that would be a great opportunity\nto do that, in that example.\n\n414\n00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.782\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that and, but\nwithout that lack of trust and candor,\n\n415\n00:19:47.782 --> 00:19:49.620\npeople are afraid to do that.\n\n416\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.680\nSo they sit in there and they commit\nto things they don't believe in.\n\n417\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.960\nA highly functional team, when somebody\nput an idea out that the rest of the team\n\n418\n00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.770\ndid not agree with, they would be very\npolite and respectful to the person, but\n\n419\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.880\nthey would attack the idea and\nsay this is what I don't like about it,\n\n420\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.520\nhere's how we can make it better,\nthis is how we can change it.\n\n421\n00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.310\nBut if it's a sub-functional team,\nthey don't say that.\n\n422\n00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.080\nSo what happens then,\nthe next one is lack of accountability.\n\n423\n00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.380\nIs I don't trust the team or the rest of\nthe people, I'm not communicating with\n\n424\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.150\ncandor, I've made a commitment\nI'm not really committed to, so\n\n425\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:21.650\nI don't wanna be held accountable for it.\n\n426\n00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.850\nI think it's a stupid idea, and I'm not\ngonna point the finger of accountability\n\n427\n00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.040\nat you, Peter,\ncuz you're just gonna point it back at me.\n\n428\n00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.070\nBecause I don't wanna be held accountable,\nI'm not gonna hold you accountable.\n\n429\n00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.160\nWhich leads to the fifth and\n\n430\n00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.620\nfinal dysfunction of the team\nwhich is lack of results.\n\n431\n00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.300\nIf nobody's holding each other\naccountable, and we've said this multiple\n\n432\n00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.037\ntimes during these episodes, is one of\nthe major factors you've gotta have in\n\n433\n00:20:42.037 --> 00:20:45.623\nhigh performance team is high levels\nof personal mutual accountability.\n\n434\n00:20:45.623 --> 00:20:48.900\nWithout that accountability,\nyou can't deliver results.\n\n435\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.780\n&gt;&gt; So what I took away from that\nis there's a lot of steps and\n\n436\n00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.730\nit's difficult to build a team.\n\n437\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.590\nIt's pretty easy to go ahead and\nbreak one down, it sounds like.\n\n438\n00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.230\nAnd one or two little mistakes can\nkind of have some big consequences.\n\n439\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.550\nSo, how do we hold it all together?\n\n440\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.270\n&gt;&gt; There's multiple ways\nto hold this together.\n\n441\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.560\nFirst of all, the leader has to be,\n\n442\n00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.080\nas you mentioned earlier, a living example\nof what the culture of the team is.\n\n443\n00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.480\nAnd the other big thing is to\nreinforce positive behaviors\n\n444\n00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.950\nwith positive reinforcement, and negative\nbehaviors with negative reinforcement.\n\n445\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.610\nIn other words, if someone's doing\nsomething that doesn't match the culture,\n\n446\n00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.310\nthey've got be held accountable for\nthat, you gotta call them out and\n\n447\n00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.670\nget them back into the norm of the team.\n\n448\n00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:33.320\nWhen someone is really living the team\nculture, you want to give them awards,\n\n449\n00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.900\npat them on the back, and\n\n450\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.710\nmake sure they understand that you\nare doing exactly what we all agreed to.\n\n451\n00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.230\nAnother big factor in this is doing things\naway from working in the company together.\n\n452\n00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.010\nGoing out for beer,\ngoing bowling, or going out and\n\n453\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.420\ngetting a pizza, so that that culture gets\ningrained and we build that friendship and\n\n454\n00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.120\nthat camaraderie and trust.\n\n455\n00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.970\nBecause a big,\n\n456\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.600\nbig foundation of trust is also how\nwell do I know the folks on my team.\n\n457\n00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.220\nIf I only work with them at the office,\nI never see them outside of the office,\n\n458\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.400\nthen it's hard for\nme to build up a personal trust with them,\n\n459\n00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.250\nwhat we call tie strength,\nwhere we are friendly and\n\n460\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.830\nwe get to know each other more\nthan just the work we're doing.\n\n461\n00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.990\nSo those are some of the elements it\ntakes to hold a culture together, but\n\n462\n00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.810\nthis isn't done by chance.\n\n463\n00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:19.390\nIt's done because you purposely work on\nthe culture, make sure it's going well,\n\n464\n00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.450\nstrongly support it,\nmake sure that no one's breaking it down.\n\n465\n00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.680\nAnd talk about it often, and\n\n466\n00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.940\nmake sure that the culture's where\neverybody wants it to be, and that it's\n\n467\n00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.300\nengaging, exciting, the people are having\nfun and they like working on the team.\n\n468\n00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so maybe a culture does grow\norganically, but it takes work and\n\n469\n00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.690\nit takes effort to maintain it and\n\n470\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.720\nmake sure you keep that up as\nthe company grows, as it gets bigger,\n\n471\n00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.520\nas you add more people, bringing\nall those people into that culture.\n\n472\n00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.660\nSo John, we're pretty close on time for\nthis episode.\n\n473\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.130\nAny final thoughts?\n\n474\n00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:51.430\n&gt;&gt; My final thought would be that\nculture can make or break your team.\n\n475\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.734\nYou can have the most talented people,\nyou can have a clear objective,\n\n476\n00:22:54.734 --> 00:22:58.110\nyou can have a strong sponsor,\nyou can the resources, the technology.\n\n477\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:02.400\nYou could have everything you need, but if\nyou don't create a culture of coherence,\n\n478\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.860\nof alignment, where people like each\nother, and they wanna work together, and\n\n479\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.620\nthey're excited to be there every day,\n\n480\n00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.810\nwithout that culture it's impossible\nto have an effective team.\n\n481\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.590\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\nThere's a lot of great information there\n\n482\n00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.700\nyou can probably implement\nright away in your business and\n\n483\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.300\nhelp improve your culture as\nyou're leading your tech teams.\n\n484\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.330\nAnd we have a lot more great\ninformation coming up in other episodes\n\n485\n00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.700\nabout leading those tech teams.\n\n486\n00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.810\nBut for now,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n487\n00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.230\nI'm Peter VanRysdam.\n\n488\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.990\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n489\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.733\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

Peter VanRysdam and\n\n4\n00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:12.360\ntoday continuing in our series\nabout building technology teams.\n\n5\n00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.230\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ntalking about building commitment and\n\n6\n00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.590\nteamwork, and trust within those teams.\n\n7\n00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.020\nHere to help us with that,\nwe have Mr. John Spence.\n\n8\n00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.750\nJohn, how you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.970\n&gt;&gt; Doing wonderful, Peter, and you?\n\n10\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.210\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, thanks.\n\n11\n00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.950\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\n\n12\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.520\n&gt;&gt; So, where do we start in\nbuilding trust on your team?\n\n13\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.720\n&gt;&gt; Well, before we talk about and\ncommitment, let me talk about\n\n14\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.050\nwhy the lack of trust and\ncommitment is so incredibly challenging.\n\n15\n00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.258\nRight now, statistics\nare somewhere between about 60 and\n\n16\n00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:44.335\n77% of employees are disengaged or\nnot committed.\n\n17\n00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:47.490\nYou've got your disengaged\nemployees that really just don't\n\n18\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.880\ncare that much about the company.\n\n19\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.690\nThey don't really like what they do, and\nthey don't really like the organization\n\n20\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.360\nthey work in, but\nthey show up every day anyways.\n\n21\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.510\nThere is also a portion that\nare called actively disengaged,\n\n22\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.950\nwhich are actively attempting\nto sabotage the organization.\n\n23\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.700\nThe analogy I like to use is if\nyou've got a good team on a boat,\n\n24\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.730\nyou're all rowing in the same direction.\n\n25\n00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.770\nIf you have a somewhat dysfunctional\nteam with disengaged people,\n\n26\n00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.910\nmost of the boat's rowing in one way and\nsomebody's either dragging their oars or\n\n27\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.470\nthey're rowing against it.\n\n28\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.820\nBut when you've got\nactively disengaged people,\n\n29\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.910\nthey're basically filling buckets of\nwater and putting it in the boat or\n\n30\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.150\ndrilling wholes in\nthe boat as you go along.\n\n31\n00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.450\nNow we're making light of it but\n\n32\n00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.560\nthe truth of the matter is,\nit's exceedingly expensive to companies.\n\n33\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.820\nLarger companies lose\nhundreds of millions or\n\n34\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.670\nbillions of dollars from team\nmembers that are not committed.\n\n35\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.050\nIt can put a small business\nout of business and\n\n36\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.340\nit can really hurt your career\nif your not a good team player.\n\n37\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.940\nSo, what I'd like to do is although we\ntalked about it in one of the other\n\n38\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.110\nsessions, I'd like to go back and\n\n39\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.920\nquickly refresh on Patrick Lencioni's idea\naround the five dysfunctions of a team.\n\n40\n00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.110\nI was actually talking to a senior\nprofessor at a major university yesterday\n\n41\n00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.140\nabout this, and we came up with\na few new ideas to add into it.\n\n42\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.810\nSo there are five things that ruin a team.\n\n43\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.310\nAt the base of it, and the thing that\nreally causes the most trouble, and\n\n44\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.520\nexactly why we're doing this session,\nis lack of trust.\n\n45\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.510\nAnd we're going to talk quite a bit about\nhow to build trust, how to overcome\n\n46\n00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.040\ndistrust in the next few minutes, but\njust understand that the single most\n\n47\n00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.850\ndevastating thing to a team is when the\nteam members don't truly trust themselves.\n\n48\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.290\nThat lack of trust then leads to a lack\nof candor or a lack of vulnerability.\n\n49\n00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.110\nAnd here's the new word we\ncame up with yesterday.\n\n50\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.990\nIt's really a lack of transparency.\n\n51\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.070\nPeople hoarding knowledge,\nnot sharing information.\n\n52\n00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.290\nNot saying everything\nthat's on their mind.\n\n53\n00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.020\nSo when you don't really trust each other,\n\n54\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.630\nyou don't have the good open, honest,\nrobust transparent communication\n\n55\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.580\nthat is essential to having\na high performing team.\n\n56\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.710\nAt the next level then is we\nhave a lack of commitment.\n\n57\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.700\nHe and I, yesterday, were talking about\na project in China we're both working on.\n\n58\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.400\nAnd I said, it's sort of like you're\nall sitting around the table and\n\n59\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.140\nsomeone's going, hey, what do you\nthink about the China projects?\n\n60\n00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.140\nSomebody goes it's fantastic, love it,\ncan't wait to get over there.\n\n61\n00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.570\nShanghai's gonna be awesome.\n\n62\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.120\nAnd the next person at the table goes,\nI've been to China three or\n\n63\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.320\nfour times, love that place, fantastic.\n\n64\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.650\nThen they point at you and\nyou're thinking, this is a disaster.\n\n65\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.700\nWe're gonna lose money.\n\n66\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.090\nThis is a really bad idea.\n\n67\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.670\nBut because you don't have a high level of\ntrust with everybody else at the table,\n\n68\n00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.380\nyou're not willing to be vulnerable.\n\n69\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.690\nYou don't wanna speak courageously or\nyou're afraid to be transparent and\n\n70\n00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.720\nshare your feelings.\n\n71\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.730\nSo you go excited about China too,\nthey're gonna be great.\n\n72\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.550\nWhat happens then there in the next\nlevel is lack of accountability.\n\n73\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.980\nI have agreed to something\nI don't believe in.\n\n74\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.010\nOr someone else on the team has agreed\nto something they don't believe in\n\n75\n00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.200\ncuz we didn't have enough trust and\nwe weren't transparent and\n\n76\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.410\nwe made commitments that\nwe didn't believe in.\n\n77\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.890\nNow I don't wanna be held accountable for\n\n78\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.880\nthe commitments cuz I\ndon't believe in them.\n\n79\n00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.990\nAnd I'm not gonna hold you accountable cuz\nyou're just gonna hold me accountable and\n\n80\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.640\nwe all don't want that,\nwhich leads to the fifth and\n\n81\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.570\nfinal dysfunction is lack of results.\n\n82\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.321\nSo before we talk about trust and\ncommitment,\n\n83\n00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:06.493\nI wanted to help you understand\nthat a lack of trust and\n\n84\n00:04:06.493 --> 00:04:11.520\ncommitment is extremely expensive not only\nto the organization but to your career.\n\n85\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.539\nAnd without trust, you don't have candor,\n\n86\n00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.675\nwithout candor you don't get real\ncommitment, no real commitment,\n\n87\n00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:20.750\nthere's no accountability and no results,\nand that does not help the team, Peter.\n\n88\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.500\n&gt;&gt; So John, what to we do about this?\n\n89\n00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.500\nHow do we go about building\ntrust within our organization?\n\n90\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay, at an organizational level,\nit's pretty simple.\n\n91\n00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.219\nThere are three major ideas.\n\n92\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.600\nAnd a friend of mine who's a psychologist,\nwe were chatting about this, and\n\n93\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.820\nhe said, basically these are the exact\nsame three things that anybody needs in\n\n94\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.100\nany important relationship,\nwith their spouse, with their friends,\n\n95\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.360\nwith their family, and your job.\n\n96\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.310\nBecause you [LAUGH] spend an awful lot of\ntime at work with the people you're there.\n\n97\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.460\nIt's a major part of your life.\n\n98\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.200\nYour job is one of the biggest\nrelationships you have in your life.\n\n99\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.740\nSo the three things are, and\nthey're also on three levels.\n\n100\n00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.270\nThe first one is safety, safety.\n\n101\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.120\nIf you're going to be\ncommitted to your company and\n\n102\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.040\nfeel trustworthy, you have to feel safe.\n\n103\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.720\nAnd you have to feel safe on three levels.\n\n104\n00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.860\nFirst is the emotional level.\n\n105\n00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.500\nI need to feel safe that I'm not going\nto be yelled at or embarrassed or\n\n106\n00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.942\ntaken advantage of.\n\n107\n00:05:14.942 --> 00:05:18.476\nPhysical safety is, I'm not gonna\nget a machine that grab my arms or\n\n108\n00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:21.638\nI'm not going to get electrocuted or\nit's safe for me to walk\n\n109\n00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:26.320\nout in the parking lot in the evening when\nit's late after I've finished my work.\n\n110\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.590\nAnd then the last one is psychological\nsafety which says my ideas are safe,\n\n111\n00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.000\nthat I'm not gonna be\nconstantly given a hard time,\n\n112\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.470\nmade fun of, teased, my ideas shot down.\n\n113\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.540\nSo I need to emotionally feel safe\nthat I'm not gonna be yelled at,\n\n114\n00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.420\nscreamed at,\nembarrassed in front of everybody.\n\n115\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.750\nI need to be physically safe.\n\n116\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.880\nI won't get hurt.\n\n117\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.620\nI need to be psychologically safe,\nit's safe to share my ideas.\n\n118\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.830\nSo safety's the first one.\n\n119\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.220\n&gt;&gt; So safety that makes a lot of sense.\n\n120\n00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.050\nI don't want to lose an arm\nin a machine or something.\n\n121\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.540\nBut anything else that we\nneed to do to build trust?\n\n122\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.029\n&gt;&gt; There's two more stages\nat an organizational level.\n\n123\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.880\nSo we've got safety.\n\n124\n00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.050\nThe next one is belongingness.\n\n125\n00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.458\nAnd what this says is I wanna\nfeel like I belong on the team,\n\n126\n00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:12.160\nthat people enjoy being around me.\n\n127\n00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.400\nThey feel like I'm a partner,\nI'm one of the group.\n\n128\n00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.540\nAnd basically for all humans, we wanna\nfeel like we're part of the tribe.\n\n129\n00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.670\nNobody wants to be standing alone,\noff on the side and not connected.\n\n130\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.640\nSo belongingness is critical and\n\n131\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.980\nit's also part of way to build\na deeper level of trust.\n\n132\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.120\nIf we know each other, we care about each\nother, I know about your family, and\n\n133\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.190\nyou really feel like I'm happy to\nsee you when you come to work, and\n\n134\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.670\nyou belong on the team, key idea.\n\n135\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.590\nThe last one is appreciation and\nI've been doing this for a long time and\n\n136\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.810\neven I didn't realize how critical it\nis to really show genuine, honest,\n\n137\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.490\nsincere appreciation and\nto celebrate when things go right.\n\n138\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.410\nAnd that's also on three levels.\n\n139\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.320\nIt's emotional appreciation.\n\n140\n00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.550\nI like your sense of humor,\nPeter, [LAUGH] well, not so\n\n141\n00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.120\nmuch, but we have fun together.\n\n142\n00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.330\nWe enjoy stuff.\n\n143\n00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.050\nI appreciate the fact that\nyou're happy when you come in.\n\n144\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.880\nYou got a good attitude and\nyou're passionate.\n\n145\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.090\nIt's also physical appreciation.\n\n146\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.480\nI appreciate the work you do.\n\n147\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.430\nWhen you're sitting at your computer and\nyou're coding, when you bring in a report,\n\n148\n00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.340\nwhen you come and make some sort of\na presentation of the rest of the team.\n\n149\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.160\nI appreciate the actual work you do.\n\n150\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.230\nAnd then the last one is\npsychological appreciation.\n\n151\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.470\nAnd what that says is I\nappreciate your diversity.\n\n152\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.630\nI appreciate the new and different and\ninnovative ideas you bring.\n\n153\n00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.230\nI appreciate the fact that you have\nhad a different background and\n\n154\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.470\ndifferent experiences than\nthe rest of the team.\n\n155\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.310\nAnd you're bringing that to the team and\nintellectually helping us be\n\n156\n00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.600\na more robust and\na more successful team with better ideas.\n\n157\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.830\nSo, very essential to build\nin an organization, safety,\n\n158\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.900\nbelongingness, and appreciation.\n\n159\n00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.630\n&gt;&gt; Now you've mentioned a couple of\ntimes that that's building trust\n\n160\n00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.920\nwithin an organization.\n\n161\n00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.130\nWhat other levels are there that\nwe want to building trust in?\n\n162\n00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.333\n&gt;&gt; Well the next one is personal trust,\n\n163\n00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:58.029\nand this is something I've been\nteaching for a long time, and\n\n164\n00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:02.458\nit's one of the very hardest concepts for\npeople to grasp in my sessions.\n\n165\n00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:06.592\nAnd here's the idea Peter, and\nthis is a big one is, to build trust,\n\n166\n00:08:06.592 --> 00:08:08.390\nyou must extend trust first.\n\n167\n00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.540\nIn other words, and\nhere's the way I sort of explain it,\n\n168\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.600\nwhen I meet most people, Megan,\nI've met this girl Megan.\n\n169\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.010\nShe's very nice, but\nI don't know her at all.\n\n170\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.108\nAnd in that initial conversation, if I\nwere to see a little bubble of trust over\n\n171\n00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:26.347\nher head, for most people, that bubble\nstarts at zero, on a scale of one to ten.\n\n172\n00:08:26.347 --> 00:08:29.382\nI don't know her, I can't trust her,\nI never been around her before,\n\n173\n00:08:29.382 --> 00:08:30.958\nwe have no background, no history.\n\n174\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.118\nBut I hang out with Megan for the day,\nwe do some work on a project,\n\n175\n00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:35.730\nshe seems pretty cool.\n\n176\n00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.680\nMaybe it goes up to a two and\nthen I run into her another week or\n\n177\n00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.115\ntwo later and we end up going to lunch and\ntalking about our families.\n\n178\n00:08:42.115 --> 00:08:43.682\nAnd now it's up to a five or a six.\n\n179\n00:08:43.682 --> 00:08:47.249\nAnd maybe six months later we run into\neach other at a big convention or\n\n180\n00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:49.785\na conference we got out and\nhave a beer together.\n\n181\n00:08:49.785 --> 00:08:53.072\nAnd now it's up to an eight nine, and\nmaybe the next year she finally gets to,\n\n182\n00:08:53.072 --> 00:08:55.640\nwe had two, two and\na half years of hanging out.\n\n183\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.800\nFinally now,\nMegan is a ten on my trust level.\n\n184\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.510\nProblem, it took two years to get there.\n\n185\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.180\nSo here's the big challenging\nthing is if you really want to\n\n186\n00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.180\nbuild trust on your team, you need\nto start at ten with other people.\n\n187\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.540\nYou need to extend full trust and\nfull respect at the very beginning.\n\n188\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.995\nNow a lot of people say, but\nthey'll take advantage of me.\n\n189\n00:09:16.995 --> 00:09:18.415\nThat's being naive.\n\n190\n00:09:18.415 --> 00:09:21.140\nI'm not saying they have to stay at a ten.\n\n191\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.420\nIf they do something to violate that,\n\n192\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.880\nyou can take it from a ten\nto a zero immediately.\n\n193\n00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.130\nBut if you tell someone,\nyou've got to hang around with me.\n\n194\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.650\nI've got to watch you do your work.\n\n195\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.307\nI've got to do this for 18 months or\n2 years before I decide to trust you,\n\n196\n00:09:35.307 --> 00:09:36.946\nthen I'm finally comfortable.\n\n197\n00:09:36.946 --> 00:09:39.650\nThat's very, very hard to\nbuild a high performance team,\n\n198\n00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.960\nespecially if you're only gonna\nbe together for a few months.\n\n199\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.930\nSo big challenges,\nhow do you extend full trust and\n\n200\n00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:52.040\nfull respect first, and then only take\nit away if the other person violates it?\n\n201\n00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.770\nAnd if you can come together as a team and\nagree on that idea,\n\n202\n00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:01.120\nyou can catapult past other teams, by\nbeginning with a very high level of trust.\n\n203\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.900\n&gt;&gt; And\nmaybe you get burned one out of ten times,\n\n204\n00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.110\nbut you're able to be that much\nmore productive right off the bat,\n\n205\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.170\nwhich sounds like it's\npotentially worth that risk.\n\n206\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.363\nSo that's building trust\nas an individual then.\n\n207\n00:10:11.363 --> 00:10:13.300\nAny more?\n\n208\n00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we've got as an organization,\n\n209\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.260\nwe've got it individually which is\nalso sort of intermixed in the team.\n\n210\n00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.367\nAnd now I'd like to go to slide and talk\nabout how to do this as a team leader.\n\n211\n00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:25.080\nHow do you build trust as a team leader?\n\n212\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.510\nSo here we're gonna go through this.\n\n213\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.010\nAnd this is now when\nyou're leading the team or\n\n214\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.440\nyou stepped into a role of leading the\nteam for a while on part of the project.\n\n215\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.930\nFirst and most important is to\nestablish and maintain integrity.\n\n216\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.980\nAnd I've mentioned this before,\nbut again, it's worth saying.\n\n217\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.350\nA couple of times, actually, multiple\ntimes, the single most important thing\n\n218\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:50.280\nthat people look for in a leader they\nwould willingly follow, is honesty.\n\n219\n00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.140\nIn a global survey,\n90% of people on the face\n\n220\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.440\nof the earth said that if\nmy leader isn't honest,\n\n221\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.450\nthere's no way that I will trust him and\nthere's no way that I'll follow him.\n\n222\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.666\nSo you've got to constantly show that\nyou are in integrity with your values.\n\n223\n00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:10.261\nWhich brings me to another point is, if\nyou're gonna be a leader you need to share\n\n224\n00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:13.130\nwith your team your leadership philosophy.\n\n225\n00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.652\nThe core values you plan to lead the team\nby, honesty, integrity, fairness,\n\n226\n00:11:17.652 --> 00:11:19.688\nrespect, passion, commitment.\n\n227\n00:11:19.688 --> 00:11:23.390\nI don't know what they are, but\nyou need to think those through.\n\n228\n00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.774\nBecause the only way that someone\ncan measure if you have integrity\n\n229\n00:11:26.774 --> 00:11:30.530\nis to understand what values you're\nholding your integrity up against.\n\n230\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:35.013\nThe next thing is, and this is one\nof the big issues we see over and\n\n231\n00:11:35.013 --> 00:11:39.510\nover again is not communicating\ndivision well enough.\n\n232\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.120\nSo in an organization, on the whole,\nthis is a huge problem.\n\n233\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.313\nOn a team what the team leader needs to\ndo is constantly talk about the vision,\n\n234\n00:11:47.313 --> 00:11:51.569\nthe direction, the purpose of the team,\nto keep people aligned on the team and\n\n235\n00:11:51.569 --> 00:11:52.555\nmoving forward.\n\n236\n00:11:52.555 --> 00:11:54.738\nAnd the reason this is\nimportant to trust is,\n\n237\n00:11:54.738 --> 00:11:57.100\nif I tell everybody we're\ngoing in direction a.\n\n238\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.293\nWe're going to go in a, in a.\n\n239\n00:11:58.293 --> 00:11:59.828\nAnd then all of a sudden I go, no,\nwe're headed in b and we're going to go b.\n\n240\n00:11:59.828 --> 00:12:01.599\nNo, no, now we're headed c.\n\n241\n00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:06.470\nThat inconsistency of vision and\ndirection destroys trust.\n\n242\n00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.390\nThe next thing we're gonna look\nat is making sure that you treat\n\n243\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.180\neverybody on the team as an equal.\n\n244\n00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.240\nIt is very hard to trust your team leader\nif you think they have special people on\n\n245\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.080\nthe team that they're looking out for.\n\n246\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.840\nThat they give more opportunity to or\n\n247\n00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.519\nthey give them a break if\nthey don't turn something in.\n\n248\n00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:25.680\nThe team, the leader's pet.\n\n249\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.590\nYou don't trust a leader who\ntreats people differently.\n\n250\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.320\nNow I'm not saying that they might\nchallenge somebody who's got a higher\n\n251\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.269\nlevel of skills a little\nharder than somebody else.\n\n252\n00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:37.841\nWhat I'm talking about is fairness,\nrules, and\n\n253\n00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:43.029\nrespect that everyone on the team gets\ntreated the same way around time,\n\n254\n00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:46.420\nflexibility, exposure, things like that.\n\n255\n00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.990\nThings that people want on a team\nto allow them to be successful.\n\n256\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.621\nThat the team leader isn't making\na couple of people their little pets, and\n\n257\n00:12:51.621 --> 00:12:52.410\nmaking them special.\n\n258\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.250\nThis is a big one that\nthe team leader has to model.\n\n259\n00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.748\nWhich is, we are all on the same team and\nwe have a shared goal,\n\n260\n00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:07.610\na shared outcome, and a shared reward\nto all of us doing this together.\n\n261\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.439\nOnce you start getting fractions on a team\nand things get siloed you will not have\n\n262\n00:13:11.439 --> 00:13:15.225\ntrust or commitment on the team because\nit becomes everybody for themselves.\n\n263\n00:13:15.225 --> 00:13:19.293\nSo it's essential that the team\nleader constantly be showing people,\n\n264\n00:13:19.293 --> 00:13:21.080\nwe're all in this together.\n\n265\n00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:21.825\nWe're on the same team.\n\n266\n00:13:21.825 --> 00:13:23.760\nWe're moving forward together.\n\n267\n00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.930\nWe've got a shared direction,\nshared goals, a shared outcome, and\n\n268\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.150\nwe will all share in the success.\n\n269\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.380\nAnd then the last thing\nis that as a leader,\n\n270\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.840\nif you really wanna build\ntrust strong on your team,\n\n271\n00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.770\nyou've gotta do what's right for the team\nand the organization above yourself.\n\n272\n00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.049\nThere's a word we use for\nthis in leadership, servant leadership,\n\n273\n00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:48.022\nwhere you say it's my job to support the\nteam and make sure the team's successful.\n\n274\n00:13:48.022 --> 00:13:51.693\nEven if it might be challenging or\ndifficult for my career, or\n\n275\n00:13:51.693 --> 00:13:56.634\neven risking my career, but I'm willing to\nput a stake in the ground and stand up for\n\n276\n00:13:56.634 --> 00:14:01.752\nmy team even if it might cost me personal\ndifficulties, and challenges, and risks.\n\n277\n00:14:01.752 --> 00:14:05.050\n&gt;&gt; All right so John, you mentioned it's\ngood to kind of start with that level of\n\n278\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.030\ntrust and\nyou then you can build on that or\n\n279\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.380\nit can be taken away from\nif something goes wrong.\n\n280\n00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.256\nBut how do we overcome distrust if\nthat does come up within our team?\n\n281\n00:14:15.256 --> 00:14:19.354\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Peter, so we've worked hard,\nwe've tried to make the team work great\n\n282\n00:14:19.354 --> 00:14:23.718\nand now something's gotten in there and\nwe're starting to spiral into distrust.\n\n283\n00:14:23.718 --> 00:14:28.355\nAnd this is one of those things they call\nit the, Jim Collins in his book calls it\n\n284\n00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:32.292\nthe fly wheel in the doom loop It's\nhard to get the fly wheel going,\n\n285\n00:14:32.292 --> 00:14:35.350\nit's like pushing a car down the road.\n\n286\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.835\nIf you stop for\na second it slows down immediately, but\n\n287\n00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:41.254\nonce you get a little momentum going\nyou can keep push car it's not as hard.\n\n288\n00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:44.910\nBut the minute you stop or start to go\nuphill it just rolls back over you.\n\n289\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.030\nSo same thing with a team.\n\n290\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.958\nIf you've got a pretty high level\nof trust, you're doing well and\n\n291\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.259\nsomething comes in and\nviolates the trust on a team,\n\n292\n00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:54.682\nyou're gonna start to see\na wave of distrusts coming.\n\n293\n00:14:54.682 --> 00:14:57.480\nAnd there's a couple of\nthings you need to do.\n\n294\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.630\nNumber one is admit that\nyou have a problem.\n\n295\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.860\nA lot of times on teams,\npeople just hope it'll go away.\n\n296\n00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.870\nIf I just don't say anything and\n\n297\n00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.380\nI just try to be a little\nextra nice to this person.\n\n298\n00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.910\nOr I don't bring up this issue or this\nchallenge maybe we can just pretend that\n\n299\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.280\npeople aren't arguing, and\nfighting, and backstabbing.\n\n300\n00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.530\nSo the first one is and\nlet's go ahead and look at the slide,\n\n301\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.880\nI've got a couple more here\nthat I want to put up.\n\n302\n00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.270\nOnce you've understood that there is\na problem and you've faced up to it and\n\n303\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.370\nyou know you have to deal with it,\n\n304\n00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.430\nthe most important thing next step is\nto ask people about their stories.\n\n305\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.810\nWhat happened?\nWhy do you feel this way?\n\n306\n00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.250\nWhat did the other person say, or do, or\n\n307\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:42.200\nwhat was the situation that began to\nerode your trust in other person?\n\n308\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.390\nAnd I have seen teams,\nworked with one not so long ago,\n\n309\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:50.076\nwhere there were two ladies on the team\nwho, for years, didn't get along.\n\n310\n00:15:50.076 --> 00:15:52.795\nAnd this was a senior management team,\nand it made the team very dysfunctional.\n\n311\n00:15:52.795 --> 00:15:55.446\nThey didn't like to sit next\nto each other in meetings.\n\n312\n00:15:55.446 --> 00:15:58.465\nThey didn't support each other\nwhen they came up with ideas.\n\n313\n00:15:58.465 --> 00:16:03.504\nAnd it turns out that three years ago,\none of the women had said something\n\n314\n00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:08.700\nabout the other woman's husband\nin a not so complementary way.\n\n315\n00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.420\nAnd she took that as a personal insult and\nfor\n\n316\n00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.990\nthree years, she didn't wanna work well\nwith this other woman on the team.\n\n317\n00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.800\nAnd when I sat down\nseparately with them and\n\n318\n00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.070\nsaid tell me what's going on here,\ntell me your story.\n\n319\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.720\nThe story came out and the other\nwomen who had made the insult said,\n\n320\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.970\nI didn't realize that,\nI was being sort of sarcastic,\n\n321\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.380\nI thought that was a joke, I didn't\nmean for you to take that personally,\n\n322\n00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.860\nI think your husband's awesome,\nhe's great and here's all the reasons.\n\n323\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.070\nAnd as soon as they had that discussion,\nthey realized their stories were silly,\n\n324\n00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.180\nthey've never been backed up, they were'nt\nthat important and they buried the hatchet\n\n325\n00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.100\nand got along great, and it totally\nchanged the dynamics of the team.\n\n326\n00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.450\nSo when you start to lose trust,\nits usually miscommunication or\n\n327\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.570\nan assumption, or something that people\ndidn't really take the time to work out,\n\n328\n00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.080\nso when you get them to tell their\nstories you get to get to the foundation\n\n329\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.720\nof what really drove the distrust.\n\n330\n00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.330\nThe next one is to create some low\nrisk opportunities for interaction.\n\n331\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.480\nIn other words, if I'm starting\nto get some distrust on my team,\n\n332\n00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.830\nlet's go do a team building exercise.\n\n333\n00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.670\nLet's all go out and get a pizza.\n\n334\n00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.560\nLet's do some sort of an icebreaker, and\n\n335\n00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.330\nI'll give you on paper the ideas\nthat I'm not an icebreaker guy.\n\n336\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.450\nBut I was working with a big company and\nthey, when they had a little team\n\n337\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.870\ndysfunction they would say, all right, I'd\nlike everyone on the team to talk about\n\n338\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.300\nhow many kids were in your family and\nwhat number kid you were.\n\n339\n00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.570\nAnd I thought this is the silliest\nexcercise I've ever heard in my life,\n\n340\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.790\nthen people started going around saying,\nyeah, I had five brothers and sisters, and\n\n341\n00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.420\nI was the middle child.\n\n342\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.070\nI never got any attention from my parents.\n\n343\n00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.690\nThere was one guy that I worked with\n\n344\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.830\nthat was the oldest in a group of six or\nseven kids.\n\n345\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.210\nHis father passed away when he was 14.\n\n346\n00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.350\nHe said I had to take the family over.\n\n347\n00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.540\nI had to lead the family and\nI never got to go to summer camp.\n\n348\n00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.850\nAll those years, my brothers and sisters,\nbut I had to work, I had to do things.\n\n349\n00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.650\nAnd now in his 50s,\nhe gets together with his buddies and\n\n350\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.080\nevery year they go to\nsummer camp together.\n\n351\n00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.460\nAnd that story,\n\n352\n00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.410\nwhich I still think is great, really\nbonded him with the rest of the team.\n\n353\n00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.840\nSo do some sort of a non-threatening\ndiscussion icebreaker,\n\n354\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.590\ngo bowling, do something.\n\n355\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.212\nSo the people can get to know\neach other more as individuals,\n\n356\n00:18:20.212 --> 00:18:22.421\nnot just as the person I worked with.\n\n357\n00:18:22.421 --> 00:18:23.910\nBig idea there.\n\n358\n00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.230\nAnd then the last one, or the last two,\n\n359\n00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:32.370\nis as a leader on a team that\nhas distrust and dysfunction,\n\n360\n00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.130\nyou gotta really model a way of extending\ntrust, like we were talking about earlier.\n\n361\n00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.970\nExtend full trust and respect and the way\nyou do that is through your actions.\n\n362\n00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.440\nNot what you say,\nnot what you talk about, but\n\n363\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.950\nhow you treat everybody on the team and\nthey need to see in meetings and\n\n364\n00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.640\nhear on the phone and see in Skype calls\nthat you are fully committed to the team.\n\n365\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.220\nYou're making every effort to show trust,\nrespect, fairness,\n\n366\n00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.900\ncommitment to the team, and that will\nallow other people to go out on the limb.\n\n367\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.500\nIf you as a leader, aren't modeling,\n\n368\n00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.480\nthrough your actions,\nhigh levels of trust, nobody else will.\n\n369\n00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.280\nNow that does come to\nthe last one which is,\n\n370\n00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.495\nwhen someone does go out on that limb,\ndon't saw it off.\n\n371\n00:19:14.495 --> 00:19:16.660\n[COUGH] Celebrate it, give him a hug.\n\n372\n00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.670\nPut him up on a pedestal\nin front of the team and\n\n373\n00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.570\nsay, this is what we're looking for.\n\n374\n00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:26.500\nThis is someone who is taking\na risk to try to extend trust and\n\n375\n00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.470\ndispel distrust and it takes courage.\n\n376\n00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:34.260\nAnd it's hard, and\nit makes you vulnerable and scared.\n\n377\n00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.550\nBut they went ahead and did it, and\n\n378\n00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.980\nthis is what we love to\nsee from our team members.\n\n379\n00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.840\n&gt;&gt; Great John.\nNow, thinking back, I think the beginning\n\n380\n00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.770\nof this episode, we talked about,\nthis is trust and commitment.\n\n381\n00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.400\nAnd we've covered trust pretty well now.\n\n382\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.590\nCommittment what does that mean\nin relation to the teams here?\n\n383\n00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Again I'm gonna start sort of\nat an organizational level and\n\n384\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:58.800\nthen I'll move back into a personal level\non the team, and then as a team leader.\n\n385\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.350\nThis is a big subject that\nI've been working on for\n\n386\n00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.380\na few years and\nI've really seen it become more and\n\n387\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.890\nmore important in companies I've\nworked with around the world.\n\n388\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.290\nAnd the way you get committment\nto an organization and\n\n389\n00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.470\nthis works as a team as well.\n\n390\n00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.660\nBut now we're talking the overall\norganization, is people really have to\n\n391\n00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.510\nunderstand and be committed to and\nbe excited about the division,\n\n392\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:23.090\nmission, values and\nespecially the purpose of the company.\n\n393\n00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.250\nNow these are terms that a lot of people\nget confused with vision, mission,\n\n394\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.730\nvalue and blah, blah, blah, let me\ntake a second and define terms here.\n\n395\n00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.040\nThe vision is where you want\nthe company to be one day.\n\n396\n00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.980\nThe vision of the team is what do we\nwanna achieve, where do we wanna be.\n\n397\n00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.340\nHow will we measure it?\n\n398\n00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.480\nDo we wanna become the industry leader?\n\n399\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.698\nDo we wanna be number one?\n\n400\n00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:44.110\nDo we wanna be a billion dollar company?\n\n401\n00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.260\nBut the vision is what do we\nwanna be when we grow up?\n\n402\n00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.560\nThe mission and I love the way to look\nat this one, is why are we doing it?\n\n403\n00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.934\nOr another fantastic way is,\nwho would miss us if we’re gone?\n\n404\n00:20:55.934 --> 00:20:59.472\nIf your company ceased to exist tomorrow,\nor your team just\n\n405\n00:20:59.472 --> 00:21:04.300\ndisappeared off the face of the Earth,\nwho would say wow, I loved that company?\n\n406\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:04.974\nI loved their products.\n\n407\n00:21:04.974 --> 00:21:06.710\nI loved the people there.\n\n408\n00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.879\nI can't believe they're gone,\nthat's really sad.\n\n409\n00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:10.746\nOr if the other people\nin your company went,\n\n410\n00:21:10.746 --> 00:21:12.570\nI can't believe that team got disbanded.\n\n411\n00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.230\nThey were so effective.\n\n412\n00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.590\nThey produced such good work.\n\n413\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.310\nThat was good people.\n\n414\n00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.070\nSo the mission is, why are you doing this?\n\n415\n00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.360\nOr who would be unhappy if you just\ndisappeared and you weren't doing it?\n\n416\n00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.240\nWhat customer, internal or external,\n\n417\n00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.160\nwould be sad that you weren't\ncontinuing to do your work?\n\n418\n00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.990\nValues are pretty straightforward and\nare usually set by the organization.\n\n419\n00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.010\nBut these are the core values that run\nhow we treat each other in the company.\n\n420\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.590\nAs you recall, we talked about,\n\n421\n00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:45.020\nwhen we're doing the team charter, that\nyou also wanna set a list of team values.\n\n422\n00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.170\nHow we'll work on the team together,\nhow we'll treat each other,\n\n423\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.190\nhow we'll serve our customers, how we're\ngonna communicate with each other.\n\n424\n00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.460\nThose are the values, and\n\n425\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:58.920\nthey're 90% controlled by just the people\non the team, how they decide to do it.\n\n426\n00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.809\nA little bit can be guided by the leader\nor the CEO of the company about,\n\n427\n00:22:02.809 --> 00:22:07.650\nhere's a few values that we\nwill never ever like honesty,\n\n428\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.210\nintegrity, customer first,\nthose never change.\n\n429\n00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.490\nThe other ones the sort of created\nby the organization of the team.\n\n430\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.202\nNow we've just talked about three big\nelements, vision, mission, values.\n\n431\n00:22:18.202 --> 00:22:20.254\nNow I wanna talk about something\nthat's really coming to the forefront.\n\n432\n00:22:20.254 --> 00:22:23.960\nAnd it's both on an organizational level,\na personal level.\n\n433\n00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.860\nBut if you want true commitment,\nand it's especially millennials and\n\n434\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.220\nfolks in the younger\ngenerations are saying this.\n\n435\n00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.580\nThey wanna be involved in\nsomething with a worldly purpose,\n\n436\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.110\nsomething where they gonna\naccomplish something meaningful.\n\n437\n00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.320\nAnd today specially if you can't\noffer some of the a lot of money or\n\n438\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.140\na lot of perks, then getting them\nexcited about the purpose of the team,\n\n439\n00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.040\nthe purpose of the company.\n\n440\n00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.670\nSteve Jobs said we're trying to\nput a dent in the end universe.\n\n441\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.890\nThere's other companies, Medtronics,\nwe're gonna return people to full health.\n\n442\n00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.680\nThat people will become exceedingly\nmore committed to your company and\n\n443\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:06.160\nyour team if there's some sort of big\nexciting, worldly purpose, meaningful goal\n\n444\n00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.410\nthat they can personally get very excited\nand passionate about and committed to.\n\n445\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.240\n&gt;&gt; That makes a lot of sense.\n\n446\n00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.730\nI recently heard that the millennials\nactually tend to value experiences\n\n447\n00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.900\nover wealth and still gotta get paid,\nstill gotta pay those bills,\n\n448\n00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.700\nbut being able to be part of something\nbigger is very important for them.\n\n449\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.220\nSo now how do we build the commitment\non the, what's next the team level.\n\n450\n00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, on the team level the ideas here,\nand we're starting now at\n\n451\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.660\nthis level of these sessions, starting\nto get a little things overlapping.\n\n452\n00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.180\nSo, you see that we're starting\nto get sort of a criss-cross\n\n453\n00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.050\nof ideas from different places.\n\n454\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.600\nSo, if you're gonna get commitment at\nteam level, again, we just set it for\n\n455\n00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.680\nan organizational level.\n\n456\n00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.580\nBut you got to have a shared direction.\n\n457\n00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.790\nAnd the key on the team is that people\nneed to have a say in that direction.\n\n458\n00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.853\nThey need to have some input, some\nfeedback, feel like they were able to put\n\n459\n00:23:55.853 --> 00:23:58.848\ntheir thumb print on it, and\nthey have some ownership.\n\n460\n00:23:58.848 --> 00:24:02.602\nAnd my favorite phrase for this is if\npeople don't have a say in the outcome,\n\n461\n00:24:02.602 --> 00:24:04.980\nthey won't have a stake in the outcome.\n\n462\n00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.930\nSo if you wanna get commitment to your\nteam, you've gotta have a clear vivid\n\n463\n00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:13.790\ncompelling shared vision that everyone\nis personally committed to as well.\n\n464\n00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.970\nThe next thing, Peter, is dependability.\n\n465\n00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.650\nIf I'm gonna be committed to my team,\nI need to know that the other\n\n466\n00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.480\npeople on the team are dependable and\ncommitted to me.\n\n467\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.200\nThat they're going to do\nwhat they say they'll do.\n\n468\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.930\nThey're going to keep their promised.\n\n469\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.590\nThat they're consistent and\nI know where they stand and\n\n470\n00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.920\nI can trust that they are going\nto be standing there tomorrow.\n\n471\n00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.580\nBecause if people on my\nteam are undependable,\n\n472\n00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:39.360\nthey're unreliable, it's very hard to be\ncommitted to a team when you can tell\n\n473\n00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.840\nthe other people aren't\ncommitted to the team.\n\n474\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.390\nThe next thing is personal connection.\n\n475\n00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:50.000\nIf you wanna build commitment and\ntrust on a team, people have to feel like,\n\n476\n00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.350\nwe're all on this together and\nwe know enough about each other, and\n\n477\n00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:59.330\nour passions, and our commitment, and\nour competence, and our work quality, that\n\n478\n00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.540\nI'm willing to be committed to the team,\ncuz I believe in the rest of the people.\n\n479\n00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.150\nBecause I know them pretty well.\n\n480\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.230\nIf I get on a team and\nI don't know anybody else on a team,\n\n481\n00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.860\nI might be committed to the vision\nof the team where we're going, but\n\n482\n00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.050\nI'm not committed to\nthe rest of the members.\n\n483\n00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.360\nAnd what we're talking about\nhere is on a personal level.\n\n484\n00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.820\nHow we build more commitment in the team\nis I have to believe that the other people\n\n485\n00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.390\nare also committed to me and the team.\n\n486\n00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.995\nAnd I need that,\n\n487\n00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:25.386\nthe only way I'm gonna know that\nis I need to spend time with them.\n\n488\n00:25:25.386 --> 00:25:26.355\nI need to chat with them.\n\n489\n00:25:26.355 --> 00:25:28.060\nI need to be in meetings with them.\n\n490\n00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:32.530\nI need to see that their work product is\nexcellent and they're doing a great job.\n\n491\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.120\nAnd then, the other two things that\nare sort of important with this, and\n\n492\n00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.450\nwe're gonna get to virtual\nteams in another session.\n\n493\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:44.000\nReally hard to do this, is shared\nexperience and celebrating together.\n\n494\n00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.830\nWhere you say its team above self, where\nyou say, all right, we went on we worked\n\n495\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.820\non this project, we we did this\nthings we had an offsite retreat, we\n\n496\n00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.680\nhad a big party together, we went out and,\nwe went to the mall, we went drinking or\n\n497\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.150\nwhatever it might be, we all went to\nthe beach, we had a little luau there.\n\n498\n00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.678\nAnd we've had some shared experiences\naround the team, so we had some history\n\n499\n00:26:03.678 --> 00:26:06.945\nwith the team and we can tell stories\nabout things we've done together.\n\n500\n00:26:06.945 --> 00:26:11.180\nAnd then when things go well, we need to\ncelebrate that together as a team and\n\n501\n00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.826\nalways if I'm going to\nbe committed to my team,\n\n502\n00:26:13.826 --> 00:26:18.520\nI need to know that the other people on\nthe team put the team above themselves.\n\n503\n00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.320\nThat all of us are in this together.\n\n504\n00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.360\nWe're committed to each other.\n\n505\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.410\nWe're committed to the team.\n\n506\n00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.248\nWe want the team to win.\n\n507\n00:26:24.248 --> 00:26:28.800\nI'm always gonna do what's right and\nbest for everybody else, not just me.\n\n508\n00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.300\nAnd there's a phrase I use when I teach\ntrust, and it's on one of our other\n\n509\n00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:37.640\nsessions, but I think it fits here nicely\nto sort of bring a bow around this one,\n\n510\n00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.326\nis I'm good at what I do, and\nI do it because I care about you.\n\n511\n00:26:41.326 --> 00:26:44.590\nIf I'm gonna be committed to the team,\nI need to know that the other people on\n\n512\n00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:47.760\nthe team are highly competent,\nextremely good at what they do,\n\n513\n00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.070\ngetting better every day and that they\ndo it all in service to the team, and\n\n514\n00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.010\nshared goals, and\nto all of us winning together.\n\n515\n00:26:55.010 --> 00:27:00.500\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good, now the last one on trust\nwas building trust as a team leader.\n\n516\n00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.520\nSo do we have that same building\ncommitment as a team leader?\n\n517\n00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is going to come\ndown to six key elements, and\n\n518\n00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.850\nthis is basic good solid leadership\n&gt;&gt; But when you're getting into a smaller\n\n519\n00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.180\ngroup with a team it's even more essential\nbecause you're under a microscope.\n\n520\n00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.460\nIt's one thing to lead a large\norganization where you're not\n\n521\n00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.030\ntouching people all the time, you don't\nsee them, you're not always interacting.\n\n522\n00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.720\nWith a team it's tight knit.\n\n523\n00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:31.020\nIt's close, so you're leadership\nskills are constantly being watched.\n\n524\n00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.620\nThey see everything you do,\nPeter They hear everything you say.\n\n525\n00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.700\nThey see what you don't do,\nthey hear what you don't say and\n\n526\n00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.580\nthey make up a story about and\nit's not usually a good one.\n\n527\n00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.340\nAnd on a team if the leader loses trust\n\n528\n00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.150\nthere's no way the rest of the team\nwill be committed to the leader.\n\n529\n00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.090\nSo let's go over these six key\nthings that people look for\n\n530\n00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.140\nin a leader they would willingly follow.\n\n531\n00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.720\nThe first one is vision.\n\n532\n00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.570\nI've got to have a clear\nforwarding looking vision.\n\n533\n00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.690\nAnd on a team that's what's our team\npurpose, what's our team vision,\n\n534\n00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.430\nwhat are we trying to achieve,\nwhat's our shared direction?\n\n535\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.450\nAnd you need to communicate\nthat consistently back.\n\n536\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.300\nHere's what were doing,\nthis is why it's important,\n\n537\n00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.250\nhere's where we are going together,\nthis is why we are such an effective team.\n\n538\n00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.460\nThe next one is competence,\nyou have got to be highly competent.\n\n539\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.880\nPeople on the rest of the team\nneed to look at you and\n\n540\n00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.380\nsay, this is a person that knows\nhow to do what they're doing.\n\n541\n00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.290\nAnd actually, Peer,\nI forgot the most important one.\n\n542\n00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.130\nI was jumping down and\nI want to go back up.\n\n543\n00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.540\nWe said it earlier, but\nI forgot to put it in here.\n\n544\n00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.612\nThe single most important\nthing is honesty.\n\n545\n00:28:31.612 --> 00:28:33.010\nWe said that back with trust.\n\n546\n00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.417\nWhere there's no trust,\nwhere there's no honesty there's no trust,\n\n547\n00:28:35.417 --> 00:28:37.530\nwhere there's no trust\nthere's no commitment.\n\n548\n00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.130\nIf you're gonna lead\na team effectively and\n\n549\n00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.180\nget them committed they have to\nknow you're telling the truth.\n\n550\n00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna take it as an honest mistake\nand you did not lost my trust yet.\n\n551\n00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So please go ahead.\n\n552\n00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.290\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I appreciate it.\n\n553\n00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.810\nSo we've got, you're honest,\n\n554\n00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:52.270\nyou're forward looking visionary, you're\ncompetent and the next one is inspiring.\n\n555\n00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.100\nAnd I can phrase this up real quick.\n\n556\n00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.660\nIf you're not passionate and\n\n557\n00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.520\ncommitted to the team,\nthey will not be committed to you.\n\n558\n00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.370\nIt's just that straightforward.\n\n559\n00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:04.340\nSo we're gonna look at someone who, and\nit doesn't mean you gotta be bombastic and\n\n560\n00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.540\njumping up and down and\ngiving big speeches.\n\n561\n00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.260\nThey just need to see that you're\ndeeply committed yourself.\n\n562\n00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.780\nThat you're passionate, that you're\nexcited, you love working with them,\n\n563\n00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.410\nyou respect the other people on the team.\n\n564\n00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.670\nYou see them as partners and peers.\n\n565\n00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:21.470\nAnd you're excited about what\nwe're gonna do together.\n\n566\n00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.950\nThe last two are fair and supportive.\n\n567\n00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.300\nThat if you're gonna lead the team.\n\n568\n00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.050\nAnd we've gotta treat everybody\non the team the same.\n\n569\n00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.719\nWe gotta be fair, we gotta have fair\nrules, fair work hours, fair work loads.\n\n570\n00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.230\nAnd that I'm there to coach my people,\nsupport them,\n\n571\n00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.100\ntrain them, be there when they need me.\n\n572\n00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.850\nWhen something goes wrong, when they're\nstruggling, I'm there to support them,\n\n573\n00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.070\nhelp them, get them coaching,\nmore training, more resources.\n\n574\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.320\nSo roughly,\nwhat we've put together here, and\n\n575\n00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.910\nthis is based on a large research project\nby two of my colleagues, and Pozner.\n\n576\n00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:56.420\nLet me take all that research and boil it\ndown to these six things that people look\n\n577\n00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.840\nfor in a team leader they\nwould willingly follow.\n\n578\n00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.280\nI want someone who will tell me the truth,\nwho has a clear idea where the team is\n\n579\n00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:08.370\ngoing, is excited to go there with all of\nus, is really good at what they do and\n\n580\n00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:13.310\nthey're passionate about it, they treat\nme fairly and support me along the way.\n\n581\n00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.590\nif you've got a leader as a team\nleader that does those things,\n\n582\n00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:20.220\nyou've got one that people will\nbe strongly committed to and\n\n583\n00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.610\nbecause they are committed to the team\nleader they are committed to the team.\n\n584\n00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.720\n&gt;&gt; Makes a lot of sense and\nthat sounds like the basis for\n\n585\n00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.030\na really strong team if\nyou have that trust and\n\n586\n00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.720\nthat commitment from everyone\nfrom the top all the way down.\n\n587\n00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.700\nAny final thoughts on this topic?\n\n588\n00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think we can summarize\nthis entire topic to two key ideas,\n\n589\n00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.620\nno trust, no commitment.\n\n590\n00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.930\nIts that simple.\n\n591\n00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:40.585\n&gt;&gt; That works for me.\n\n592\n00:30:40.585 --> 00:30:42.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that's a great place for\n\n593\n00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:43.930\nus to end for this episode.\n\n594\n00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:47.800\nI know we've got a lot more great content\ncoming you way on building these teams.\n\n595\n00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.440\nBut that's gonna do it for this one so\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n596\n00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.050\nI've been your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n597\n00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.040\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n598\n00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.378\n&gt;&gt;

Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n4\n00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.765\nAnd today we are continuing our series\nabout leading technology teams.\n\n5\n00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:15.375\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're going to talk about, and\n\n6\n00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.345\nI'm gonna look at my notes,\nthis one's a tongue twister,\n\n7\n00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:21.015\nfostering effective team communication and\ncollaboration.\n\n8\n00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.568\nAnd here to help us with that, we have\nan expert on all of those things I assume.\n\n9\n00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:25.461\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I hope.\n\n10\n00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:26.547\nMr. John Spence.\n\n11\n00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:27.247\nJohn, how are you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:27.247 --> 00:00:28.227\n&gt;&gt; Great, Pete, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:28.917\n&gt;&gt; I'm fantastic.\n\n14\n00:00:28.917 --> 00:00:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\n\n15\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.134\n&gt;&gt; So what are we talking about today,\n\n16\n00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:34.377\nwith fostering communication\ncollaboration?\n\n17\n00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:35.887\n&gt;&gt; The communication topic is one,\n\n18\n00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:39.747\nthat's pretty in-depth,\nI got a lot to cover in this session.\n\n19\n00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:42.677\nBut I wanna say the very beginning,\nthat this isn't something you learn\n\n20\n00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:46.077\nby just watching one of my sessions,\nor one of our sessions.\n\n21\n00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:47.840\nThis takes practice.\n\n22\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.090\nI've been teaching these things for\nover two decades, and\n\n23\n00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.380\non a scale of 1 to 10 of being\nan excellent communicator,\n\n24\n00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.450\nI give myself about a 7,\nmaybe not so much other days.\n\n25\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.660\nThis is hard stuff that\nyou gotta practice.\n\n26\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.365\nA couple of reasons, that people don't\nrealize is, roughly from the research and\n\n27\n00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:09.600\nstuff I've seen,\nabout 93% of communications is nonverbal.\n\n28\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.240\nIt's your tone of voice,\nit's your body language, it's eye contact.\n\n29\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.600\nWe're going to be going to all this.\n\n30\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.272\nBut realize that the words that\nactually come out of your mouth,\n\n31\n00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:21.202\nare a small fraction of\nthe actual communication.\n\n32\n00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:23.301\nAnd you might be able to\nsay the right thing, but\n\n33\n00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:27.070\nif everything else isn't working,\nthen the message isn't delivered.\n\n34\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.940\nWhich is another important\nidea around that,\n\n35\n00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.350\nis it doesn't matter what you say,\nit matters what they heard.\n\n36\n00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.130\nIf I can communicate something, and\nI think I got it, I'm strong and\n\n37\n00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.680\nI know it, and the other person heard it\na different way, didn't understand it,\n\n38\n00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.550\nwas confused, didn't understand the terms,\nthat's not their fault, that's your fault.\n\n39\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.520\nThat means you have to be\na better communicator.\n\n40\n00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.810\nAnd the other big thing around this, and\nwhy we're gonna spend so much time on it\n\n41\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.790\nis, I don't think most people, me\nincluded, are constantly monitoring their\n\n42\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.880\nown communication styles, skills, tools,\nand just sort of take if for granted.\n\n43\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.930\nYou know?\nI was born.\n\n44\n00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.060\nI got a mouth, two ears.\n\n45\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.170\nI can talk, I can listen.\n\n46\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.280\nI'm fine.\nI don't need to work on this.\n\n47\n00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.898\nTruth is, this takes a lot of\nwork it's very challenging.\n\n48\n00:02:09.898 --> 00:02:13.908\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they may be thinking about\nwhat they're saying, but like you said,\n\n49\n00:02:13.908 --> 00:02:16.540\n93% is non-verbal, so\nyou might not be thinking about\n\n50\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.710\nhow you're saying something, or how you're\nshowing your body language at that time.\n\n51\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.380\nSo, that's definitely something that\nwe want to try to understand, so\n\n52\n00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.270\nwe can make sure we're\nsending the right message.\n\n53\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and well we're gonna\nhit that in depth today, but\n\n54\n00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.679\nI wanna start with\nthe verbal communication.\n\n55\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.120\nAnd, I did a huge research study years\nago, on, for high potential employees,\n\n56\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.900\nlooking at things that they look for\nin other people on their team,\n\n57\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.420\nwho they wanna work with, and\nthe leader they would willingly follow.\n\n58\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.110\nAnd one of the big things,\nwas communication.\n\n59\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.890\nBut it wasn't communication,\nas being able to stand up and talk and\n\n60\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.660\ntell stories and get people motivated.\n\n61\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.770\nThe two things they said\nthat were most important,\n\n62\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.970\nwere asking really good questions,\nand being an intense listener.\n\n63\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.100\nAsking just the right question, at just\nthe right time to get people talking,\n\n64\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.660\nthinking, being innovative.\n\n65\n00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.880\nAnd then being incredibly good at\nlistening and taking notes and\n\n66\n00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.930\nabsorbing that information,\nwhen someone else was speaking.\n\n67\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.930\nSo, I'm going to share with you now\nseven different types of questions.\n\n68\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.750\nAnd I'm gonna look at my notes to\nmake sure I cover all of them.\n\n69\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.100\nBut this is from years and years of\nteaching consultative sales skills.\n\n70\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.900\nAnd if there's anyone that's a master\nof asking really good questions,\n\n71\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.340\nit's sales people, consultative,\nbecause you're being a consultant.\n\n72\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.930\nIt's like being a doctor.\n\n73\n00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.580\nOr trying to understand it deeply,\nwe have to ask great questions.\n\n74\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.431\nSo, first question I'm gonna talk about,\nI think this one's fairly simple, but\n\n75\n00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:45.399\nstill important to understand,\nis open ended versus close ended.\n\n76\n00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:48.480\nAnd it's pretty easy to understand this.\n\n77\n00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.870\nA close ended question, is one that\ncould be answered by yes or no.\n\n78\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.700\nHow's everything going?\n\n79\n00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.200\nGreat.\n\n80\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.720\nDid you finish the project?\n\n81\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.220\nYes.\n\n82\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.180\nAre you on schedule?\n\n83\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.190\nNo.\n\n84\n00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.980\nA open ended question, forces the person\nto give you more information.\n\n85\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.210\nInstead of, is the project on schedule?\n\n86\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.230\nYes.\n\n87\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.550\nHelp me understand the milestones, and\n\n88\n00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.150\nwhere we stand against each one of\nthem right now, I can't just go yes.\n\n89\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.330\nI've gotta give somewhat.\n\n90\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.730\nAnd if you want to get an answer quickly,\nand you just need a yes or\n\n91\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.600\nno, you ask a closed ended question.\n\n92\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.140\nBecause if you ask\nan open-ended question there,\n\n93\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.290\nthen you get all kinds of\ninformation that was unnecessary.\n\n94\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.160\nThe reverse is, if you need more\ninformation you have to make sure that\n\n95\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.140\nyou're asking open-ended questions.\n\n96\n00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.690\nSo, let me give you a couple\nof tools around doing that.\n\n97\n00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.200\nThe first one is what I call a cushion.\n\n98\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.800\nAnd a cushion is something\nyou put on the front of,\n\n99\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.930\nand these are usually difficult or\nprobing or focused questions.\n\n100\n00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.670\nYou can't just ask one after the other.\n\n101\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.485\nIt starts to sound like\nthe Spanish Inquisition.\n\n102\n00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:52.680\n[LAUGH] So we want to ease through, it so\nit doesn't sound like an interrogation.\n\n103\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.640\nAnd one of the ways to do that,\nis what's called a cushion.\n\n104\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.250\nAnd a cushion is something you put on the\nfront of the question to say, in order for\n\n105\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.170\nme to be able to help you, so\nthat I can better understand,\n\n106\n00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.270\nto make sure that we get this\nproject done on time together.\n\n107\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.030\nThese are things that say, I'm about\nto ask you a challenging question, and\n\n108\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.200\none that I'd like a good clear answer for,\nbut I'm doing it to help you.\n\n109\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.270\nOr I'm doing it to help the team.\n\n110\n00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.720\nI'm not just interrogating you.\n\n111\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.800\nSo, in order for me to better understand,\nso that we can keep the project on.\n\n112\n00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.780\nIn order to make sure that everybody is\nin alignment, could you take a minute or\n\n113\n00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.400\ntwo and share with me x, y, z?\n\n114\n00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.030\nSo I'm doing this because I'm trying\nto help you, I'm trying to help us.\n\n115\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.230\nIt's a cushion.\n\n116\n00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.860\nThe other one is called a condition.\n\n117\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.760\nAnd a conditioning statement says,\nI saw something, I talked to someone.\n\n118\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.110\nI got new information, and\n\n119\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.770\nbecause of that new condition information,\nI have to ask you this question.\n\n120\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.750\nI was talking to one of\nthe other folks on the team, and\n\n121\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.790\nI understand you're slipping\na little bit on some of your goals.\n\n122\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.080\nTell me about that, so I can help you.\n\n123\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.930\nI looked at the report that you generated,\nand\n\n124\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.290\nI noticed there was a few\nthings missing from that.\n\n125\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.999\nCould we take a few\nminutes to discuss that?\n\n126\n00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.270\nI just met with our team sponsor, and\n\n127\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.230\nshe said that they're gonna\nneed to move up the timeline.\n\n128\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.290\nLet me ask you some questions about where\nyou stand on the project right now.\n\n129\n00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.630\nSo it's not me,\nthat wants to ask this question.\n\n130\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.580\nI have new information, I read something,\nI saw something, I talked to somebody, and\n\n131\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.900\nbecause of that,\nI am now asking you this question.\n\n132\n00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.970\nThe next one I wanna look at, and this is\na fun one, are what I call, expansion or\n\n133\n00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.760\ncontraction questions.\n\n134\n00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.790\nIf you talk to somebody who, even when\nyou ask them an open-ended question,\n\n135\n00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.240\nanswers it with yes or no or two to three\nwords, and you need more information,\n\n136\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.340\nyou ask the question in a way to\nget them to expand their answer.\n\n137\n00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.040\nIt sounds like this, Peter.\n\n138\n00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.180\nPeter, could you take the next three or\nfour minutes,\n\n139\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.220\nand in as much detail as possible,\ntell me everything you know about blah.\n\n140\n00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.840\nSo, I would say,\nhow long are you gonna talk?\n\n141\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.870\nThree or four minutes.\n\n142\n00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.870\nHow much are you gonna tell me?\n\n143\n00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.690\nEverything.\n\n144\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.580\nAnd what that does is, it earns me the\nright that if Peter just says blah, blah,\n\n145\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.810\nblah three or four things,\nI can go, what else?\n\n146\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.020\nIs there anything else?\n\n147\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.470\nOr I could say,\ncould you take the next four minutes and\n\n148\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.070\ntell me the top five\nthings you're focused on?\n\n149\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.160\nAnd if the person I'm talking\nto can only come up with three,\n\n150\n00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.080\nI have earned the right to say,\nwhat are two more?\n\n151\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.640\nSo, I have earned the right through\nasking the question to say,\n\n152\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.150\nyou’re going to talk a long time,\nyou’re going to give me detail,\n\n153\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.070\nyou’re giving me five points,\nsix points, whatever it is.\n\n154\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.930\nAnd I can push you, for more and more\ninformation, if you don’t give me enough.\n\n155\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.640\nI want you to expand your answer.\n\n156\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.396\nNow the reverse, is when you talk\nto somebody and you go, hey,\n\n157\n00:07:31.396 --> 00:07:32.340\nDave what time is it?\n\n158\n00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.037\nAnd they go, in 1643 the German's\ninvented the first and\n\n159\n00:07:36.037 --> 00:07:40.157\nthey start to tell you about how clocks\nare built, and the whole history of time,\n\n160\n00:07:40.157 --> 00:07:43.460\nand you're just like,\nI just need to know what time it is.\n\n161\n00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.136\nSo if you got somebody that gives you\na long answer to something you just\n\n162\n00:07:47.136 --> 00:07:49.332\nwant a yes or no, you give a contraction.\n\n163\n00:07:49.332 --> 00:07:54.163\nAnd the contraction says is, Stephanie,\ncould you take a minute or less and share\n\n164\n00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:58.795\nwith me the two most important things,\nI need to help you with on this project?\n\n165\n00:07:58.795 --> 00:08:03.088\nTim Could you in 130 seconds\njust give me the single most\n\n166\n00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:05.990\nimportant thing we need to talk about?\n\n167\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.585\nAll right everybody, I need everyone on\nthe team to give me their feedback but\n\n168\n00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:12.650\nI'd like each of you to take\nabsolutely no more than one minute.\n\n169\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.630\nCuz there's always one team member\nwhere this person talks for a minute,\n\n170\n00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.840\nthis person talks for 45 seconds, and\nthen this person talks for 13 minutes.\n\n171\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.540\nAnd the rest of the team is rolling\ntheir eyes and going crazy.\n\n172\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.090\nAnd they're going on and on and on.\n\n173\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.650\nSo by putting a limit on how\nlong someone can talk, or\n\n174\n00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.620\na limit on how much information they\ngive you, you can contract their answer.\n\n175\n00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.030\nThese are both very handy\ntypes of questions.\n\n176\n00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.530\nThe next one is what I call scale\nquestions, and I love these.\n\n177\n00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:44.130\nA scale question says,\non a scale of one to ten,\n\n178\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:50.530\nwith ten being extremely confident and\nzero being totally no confidence at all.\n\n179\n00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.920\nHow confident are you on being\nable to meet that deadline?\n\n180\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.680\nAnd if the person goes nine,\nyou go great, we're good, I'm happy.\n\n181\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.950\nThe person goes five, you go all right,\n\n182\n00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.940\nwhat is it gonna take\nto get it to a seven?\n\n183\n00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.450\nAnd that's the same thing about a scale\nquestion is, I can judge someone's\n\n184\n00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:11.240\nconcern, distress, emotions,\nanger, whatever it might be,\n\n185\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.810\nby saying on a scale of one to ten, or a\nscale of one to five, I know you're upset.\n\n186\n00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.600\nI can see that you're angry.\n\n187\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.030\nOn a scale of one to ten, how frustrated\nand angry you're feeling right now?\n\n188\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.620\nTen.\n\n189\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.870\nOkay, were gonna need to take sometime\nto sit down and talk about this.\n\n190\n00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.750\nI'll give you a quick story on this.\n\n191\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.330\nI've been an owner CEO of several\ncompanies and I know that when\n\n192\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.396\nI use to talk to my staff, what I would\nsay if something wasn't going right or\n\n193\n00:09:37.396 --> 00:09:39.507\na project wasn't going right,\nI was displeased.\n\n194\n00:09:39.507 --> 00:09:44.790\nI would just come to my staff,\npull them all together and say, on\n\n195\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:50.220\nthe Jones project, on a scale of one to\nten of being pleased how things are going,\n\n196\n00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.950\nI'm at a negative three.\n\n197\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.580\nAnd then everyone would jump up and run\naround, I didn't have to yell, didn't have\n\n198\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.770\nto scream, just had to say, this is where\nI sit on this rating and it's not good.\n\n199\n00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.230\nSo great way to elicit concern,\nissue, emotions.\n\n200\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.250\nScale of one to five, scale of one to ten.\n\n201\n00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.510\nThey give you a number and you say\ngreat or you say the number is low.\n\n202\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.205\nHow can we get it higher and make you feel\nbetter or get the project back on track?\n\n203\n00:10:12.205 --> 00:10:16.004\nAs you are asking all these questions,\nthere is a another one,\n\n204\n00:10:16.004 --> 00:10:18.700\na tiny little sort of question to ask.\n\n205\n00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.140\nWhich is, while people are talking or\nyou are asking questions,\n\n206\n00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.770\nwhat I call perception checking questions,\nperception checking.\n\n207\n00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.520\nAnd here's what those are.\n\n208\n00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.210\nDo you feel like we're on track?\n\n209\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.890\nWe're going along, is this a good pace?\n\n210\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.820\nAre we covering everything\nthat's important to you?\n\n211\n00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.866\nSo you can see in a team setting that\nyou could look around and say, Peter,\n\n212\n00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:34.913\neverything going good?\n\n213\n00:10:34.913 --> 00:10:36.295\nKim, are you doing all right?\n\n214\n00:10:36.295 --> 00:10:37.580\nVicky, is everything good?\n\n215\n00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.550\nTim, are you feel like we're covering\nthe things that are most important to you?\n\n216\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.050\nThose little perception check,\n\n217\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.250\nkeep everybody involve and\nthen you watch the body language.\n\n218\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.593\nIf I say, Vicky,\ndo you feel comfortable about everything?\n\n219\n00:10:47.593 --> 00:10:51.310\nAnd she goes, then I know that's not true.\n\n220\n00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:56.480\nSo, I gotta stop it and now I can tell,\nit seems to me from your body language\n\n221\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.170\nthat you're not fully excited about this,\nsomething's wrong.\n\n222\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.500\nSo, let's talk about this,\nlet me hear more.\n\n223\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.270\nSo now you see where the words and\nthe body language become really strong.\n\n224\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.711\nI can say yes, but\nif my yes is like, yeah,\n\n225\n00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:14.460\nthat's good, it's very clear from\nmy body language it is a no.\n\n226\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.660\nSo the perception checking keeps everybody\nin, you're looking at body language,\n\n227\n00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.490\nyou're looking for eye contact, you're\nmaking sure you're going at a good pace.\n\n228\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.400\nAnd then the last ones\nare relationship questions.\n\n229\n00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.290\nAnd when we talk about teams, this is\nthat team trust, team commitment, and\n\n230\n00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.750\nthese are pretty simple.\n\n231\n00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.860\nDo you feel good about this?\n\n232\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.680\nAre you comfortable?\n\n233\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.520\nAm I addressing the things that\nare most important to you?\n\n234\n00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.750\nDo all of you feel like we're\ngetting along well together on this,\n\n235\n00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.840\nthat we're all committed?\n\n236\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.320\nThose are all relationship questions\nabout how are we doing together,\n\n237\n00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.130\nhow is the team working together?\n\n238\n00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.274\nI've just given you seven,\nI'm gonna read them off my list.\n\n239\n00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:53.610\nOpen ended versus closed, cushions,\nconditions, expansion contraction,\n\n240\n00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.820\nscale questions, perception checking,\nand relationship questions.\n\n241\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.660\nThese are very powerful tools but\nyou have to practice them.\n\n242\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.090\nYou got to work on them, you got to think\nthem through, you can't do it on the fly.\n\n243\n00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:08.390\nBut here's what I will tell you,\nif you can start to build this into your\n\n244\n00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:13.340\ncommunications skills and styles,\nit will make you a superb questioner.\n\n245\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.460\n&gt;&gt; Great, so I guess, the next step\nis if someone is asking question,\n\n246\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.830\nsomeone else has to be listening to them.\n\n247\n00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.000\nWhat makes someone a good listener?\n\n248\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you bring up a really good point,\n\n249\n00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.572\ncuz usually someone else\nshould be listening to them.\n\n250\n00:12:26.572 --> 00:12:28.969\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; Because if you ask a great question and\n\n251\n00:12:28.969 --> 00:12:32.110\nthe person gives you all\nthis great information.\n\n252\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.336\nI ask an expansion question with\na cushion and a condition on it.\n\n253\n00:12:35.336 --> 00:12:39.030\nIn order for me to be able to help you,\nI was talking to our sponsor and\n\n254\n00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.230\nshe said they're gonna have to move\nthe project due date up a couple weeks.\n\n255\n00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:48.400\nI'd like for you to take 10 or 15 minutes\nand share with me all of your concerns.\n\n256\n00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.460\nI've just put a cushion, condition,\nand an expansion on that one.\n\n257\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.080\nAnd now I'm expecting this person\non my team to give me five or\n\n258\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.580\nten minutes of feedback.\n\n259\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.690\nAnd if she or he starts giving me all that\nand I'm not listening, I'm not writing\n\n260\n00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.510\nnotes, I'm not paying attention,\nyou know what you're telling them?\n\n261\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.910\nI don't care about you and\ndon't talk to me.\n\n262\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.450\nDon't give me long answers cuz I'm not\nlistening anyways and I won't remember it.\n\n263\n00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.480\nAnd then what happens the next time,\n\n264\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.090\nyou don't even bother to ask them\nthe question, or they don't even bother to\n\n265\n00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.660\nanswer your questions,\ncuz they know you're not listening.\n\n266\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.410\nSo there are five levels of listening.\n\n267\n00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.510\nWe'll go through this.\n\n268\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.720\nLevel one, not listening at all.\n\n269\n00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.006\nI'm shut off, I've got bad body language,\nI'm shaking my head.\n\n270\n00:13:28.006 --> 00:13:30.930\nI've got nothing, I'm not connected.\n\n271\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.800\nAnd unfortunately we see this\non teams where people shut down.\n\n272\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.020\nYou can see some of them pushes away from\nthe table in a meeting, they crossed their\n\n273\n00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.810\narms, they looked out the window, they've\nput on their cellphone, they're completely\n\n274\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:46.770\nout which leads me to level two\nwhich is distracted listening.\n\n275\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.260\nI'm kinda listening with a half an ear,\nI'm checking my email,\n\n276\n00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.240\nposting something on Facebook,\nputting out a Tweet, something like that.\n\n277\n00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.170\nI'm shuffling through some papers.\n\n278\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.580\nI'm looking at my watch thinking\nabout the next meeting.\n\n279\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.720\nI'm leaning in a little bit,\nI'm kind of there, but\n\n280\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.630\nI'm only about 20% there, distracted.\n\n281\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.980\nThe next level is, and\nthis is one we got a lot too,\n\n282\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.790\nis listening simply to answer,\nto give your point of view immediately.\n\n283\n00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.881\nSo I'm not listening to understand you,\nI'm just listening to reply.\n\n284\n00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:17.420\nI'm thinking about my great answer.\n\n285\n00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.834\nHow it's gonna make me look smart and\nbright and talented and innovative, and\n\n286\n00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:22.030\nall those things.\n\n287\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.980\nAnd you're asking me this great\nquestion and all I'm thinking about is,\n\n288\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.880\nas soon as he shuts up,\nthis is what I'm gonna say.\n\n289\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.670\nOr, they're angry and mad and\nthey don't hear your argument,\n\n290\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.440\nthey just think about how will I defend\nagainst this, what's my argument?\n\n291\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.670\nSo, we've got not listening at all,\ndistracted listening,\n\n292\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.460\nlistening just to answer and\nthose three are obviously unacceptable.\n\n293\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.740\nThe next one is what I\ncall engaged listening.\n\n294\n00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.740\nEngaged listening is I've\nshut down my machines.\n\n295\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.385\nI've turned off my computer.\n\n296\n00:14:49.385 --> 00:14:51.360\nI've moved the papers away.\n\n297\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.900\nI've got a clean pad out,\nI'm taking some notes.\n\n298\n00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.330\nI'm really trying to listen and\nget the information you're giving me.\n\n299\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.440\nI'm trying to understand the message\nvery clearly and I'm engaged, and\n\n300\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.100\nI've shut everything else out,\nand you've got my attention.\n\n301\n00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.590\nI am locked up and\nI am listening to gather information.\n\n302\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.870\nThis is really where you\nneed to be on a team.\n\n303\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.620\nThis shows commitment to the team.\n\n304\n00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.360\nIt shows that you care\nabout what you're doing.\n\n305\n00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.090\nIt shows that you're interested and\npassionate and\n\n306\n00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.210\nwithout this level of listening on a team,\nit's very hard to have an effective team.\n\n307\n00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.410\nSo engaged listening is\nthe level you want to get to.\n\n308\n00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.110\nThere's one level beyond that, and you've\nseen me express a little bit on this\n\n309\n00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.610\nvideo, is listening not just to understand\nthe information and what was said, but\n\n310\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.530\nlistening to hear what wasn't said, what\nwas left out, or the emotions involved.\n\n311\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.450\nI gave the example before that\nyou ask someone in the group,\n\n312\n00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.160\nyou feel good about this,\nand they go, pretty good.\n\n313\n00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.536\nWhat they have clearly told you,\neven though the words stay good,\n\n314\n00:15:48.536 --> 00:15:50.841\nthe body language says, no, I'm not good.\n\n315\n00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:54.243\nI'm upset, I'm concerned,\nI'm frustrated, I'm scared,\n\n316\n00:15:54.243 --> 00:15:56.076\nI don't think this is a good idea.\n\n317\n00:15:56.076 --> 00:16:01.034\nAnd if you're just listening, you'll take\nthe yes, go yes, okay, she's on board,\n\n318\n00:16:01.034 --> 00:16:05.657\nthat's fine If you're at the highest\nlevel, which is listening to understand,\n\n319\n00:16:05.657 --> 00:16:08.806\nnot just what they are saying but\nwhat they don't say and\n\n320\n00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:11.410\nthe emotions, then you go stop.\n\n321\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.470\nWe need to back up here for a second.\n\n322\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.390\nI can tell you're not\nfully onboard with this.\n\n323\n00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.030\nI listened to you very carefully, and\nI can see through your body language,\n\n324\n00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.270\nit seems that you're upset.\n\n325\n00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.820\nSo those are the five levels.\n\n326\n00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.350\nAnd really it's the engaged listening and\nthen the advanced listening for\n\n327\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.960\nemotion and what's not said that\nwe try to get to on a team.\n\n328\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.570\nNow how do you prove\nthat you were listening?\n\n329\n00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.610\nVery important, and\nI just started to model it there.\n\n330\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.380\nIt's summarizing and paraphrasing.\n\n331\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.450\nSummarizing says,\nI've listening to you very carefully.\n\n332\n00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.440\nTalk for about five minutes,\nand you covered five things.\n\n333\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.097\nAnd it was one, two, three,\nfour, and five, is that correct?\n\n334\n00:16:50.097 --> 00:16:52.080\nAnd then the person says, yes, you got it.\n\n335\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.850\nI got it right here on my notes, I got it.\n\n336\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.152\nAnd what that says, I heard you, and\n\n337\n00:16:55.152 --> 00:16:56.833\nI listened to the information\nvery carefully.\n\n338\n00:16:56.833 --> 00:17:01.200\nAnd I've written down the information,\nI'll remember the information.\n\n339\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.230\nThat's good, that shows that you\nare engaged and you're listening.\n\n340\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.270\nThe next level is paraphrasing.\n\n341\n00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.250\nAnd what paraphrasing says is,\nI've listened to you carefully,\n\n342\n00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.360\nyou said there were five things.\n\n343\n00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.950\nIn priority, though, you said that\nnumber four was the most important.\n\n344\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.330\nNumber two was the second most important.\n\n345\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.251\nNumber three was the third most important.\n\n346\n00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:25.450\nNumber five, I even got lost there.\n\n347\n00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.390\nBut basically say, you said A, B, C and D.\n\n348\n00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.510\nA is the most important.\n\n349\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.240\nD is the second most important.\n\n350\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.260\nB and C are about the same.\n\n351\n00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.070\nAnd from everything you said, it sounds\nto me like you're focused on this.\n\n352\n00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.119\nSo I've went from, I listened to you,\nhere's what you said.\n\n353\n00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:45.940\nTo I've listened to you and to me,\nit seems like you said this.\n\n354\n00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.030\nSummarizing shows you pay attention.\n\n355\n00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.730\nParaphrasing shows that you\nunderstood what they said well enough\n\n356\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.890\nthat you can give it back\nto them in your own words.\n\n357\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.100\nAnd they go yes,\nthat's exactly what I meant.\n\n358\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.110\nWhen you get to that level,\nyou have clearly shown, I listened to you,\n\n359\n00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.520\nI'm engaged, I took notes.\n\n360\n00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.399\nI understood what you said, and\nI understood it so well that I can tell it\n\n361\n00:18:06.399 --> 00:18:10.228\nback to you the way I understand it and\nyou agree that I have it down pat.\n\n362\n00:18:10.228 --> 00:18:11.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, great, John.\n\n363\n00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.275\nI wanna go back to something you said\nearlier on about the percentage of\n\n364\n00:18:16.275 --> 00:18:18.175\ncommunication that is non-verbal.\n\n365\n00:18:18.175 --> 00:18:20.145\nSo body language has to\nbe a huge part of that.\n\n366\n00:18:20.145 --> 00:18:21.295\nCan we talk about that a little bit?\n\n367\n00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:23.505\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, body language is huge.\n\n368\n00:18:23.505 --> 00:18:26.235\nAnd this is also one of the reasons\nit's hard to do with virtual teams\n\n369\n00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:27.885\nthat just do telephone calls.\n\n370\n00:18:27.885 --> 00:18:30.115\nCuz you could be listening\nto this information, but\n\n371\n00:18:30.115 --> 00:18:34.010\nif you don't see what someone else is\ndoing, you're missing a major part of it.\n\n372\n00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.680\nSo let's talk about both positive and\nnegative body language.\n\n373\n00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.570\nPositive body language has six or\nseven elements.\n\n374\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.430\nHere they are.\n\n375\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.130\nFirst of all, you wanna have an open\nstance towards the other person.\n\n376\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.660\nIf I'm talking to Peter, I wanna face\nhim because if I don't face Peter and\n\n377\n00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.640\nI'm talking to him like this,\nI'm clearly not fully engaged.\n\n378\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.220\nSo you wanna have an open stance, you\nwanna face the person you're talking to.\n\n379\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.240\nOr someone at the board,\nyou're at a meeting and someone's talking,\n\n380\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.210\nyou wanna turn your chair and\nlook at them and engage them.\n\n381\n00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.760\nYou wanna have a pleasant\nfacial expression.\n\n382\n00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.030\nA smile, you don't wanna, yeah, all the\ntime and scare them and freak them out.\n\n383\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.450\nYou wanna make good eye contact.\n\n384\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.190\nAgain, you don't wanna stare them down but\nyou wanna look at them.\n\n385\n00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.190\nAnd if it's uncomfortable\nto look at someone's face,\n\n386\n00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.260\nyou can look down every five,\nsix, ten seconds.\n\n387\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.400\nOf if you don't wanna look\nthem directly in the eyes,\n\n388\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.870\nyou just look in the middle of their eyes,\nor at their chin or something.\n\n389\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.150\nThey can't tell, but you wanna make\nsure that you're making eye contact.\n\n390\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.460\nAnd when you're with a group, you wanna\nmake eye contact with one person while\n\n391\n00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.640\nthey're talking, and\nthen maybe look over to another person,\n\n392\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.240\nmake eye contact with them to\nsee if they're listening and\n\n393\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.540\nthings like that to bring\nthe whole group in.\n\n394\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.120\nThe next thing is to lean in slightly\nto show that you're engaged.\n\n395\n00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.560\nCuz if you're sitting way back and\nyou're just sorta looking,\n\n396\n00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.610\neven if you're making eye contact, you're\nsmiling, I look like I'm not engaged.\n\n397\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.600\nI look like I'm not excited.\n\n398\n00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.260\nAnd then you'll wanna use some other\nnon-verbal cues like head nodding.\n\n399\n00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.080\nMake it a good point.\n\n400\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.400\nSo let's put this together.\n\n401\n00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.670\nI'm talking to someone in a meeting.\n\n402\n00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.420\nI'm one on one with them.\n\n403\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.662\nThey're chatting with me.\n\n404\n00:19:58.662 --> 00:20:03.550\nI wanna walk in that, stand or\nsit facing them, lean in so\n\n405\n00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.120\nit shows I'm paying attention.\n\n406\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.670\nSmile and make good gestures and\nhead nods.\n\n407\n00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:08.880\nTake notes.\n\n408\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.740\nMake good eye contact and show them\nthat I brought my whole self here.\n\n409\n00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.690\nYou're important to me.\n\n410\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.140\nYou're the most important\nthing in the world right now.\n\n411\n00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.220\nYou're talking, I've got total focus on\nyou, I'm looking at you, I'm engaged,\n\n412\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.320\nI'm writing notes.\n\n413\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.440\nYour message is important,\nplease keep talking.\n\n414\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.420\nNow let's look at the other side\nwith negative body language.\n\n415\n00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.180\nThere's a lot of elements to this.\n\n416\n00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.399\nA lot of people say if someone's\ngot their arms crossed,\n\n417\n00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:33.830\nthey've got negative body language.\n\n418\n00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.690\nNot always the truth, they might be cold.\n\n419\n00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.520\nThey might just be comfortable that way.\n\n420\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.490\nBut an interesting thing\nwith body language,\n\n421\n00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:43.670\nPeter, is the fact that you can't\npull it all just from one gesture.\n\n422\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.923\nYou gotta sort of read it like a book.\n\n423\n00:20:45.923 --> 00:20:46.930\nIt's not just the one page.\n\n424\n00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.510\nSo they got their arms crossed,\nthey're unhappy.\n\n425\n00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:54.006\nMaybe, maybe not, but when you see here,\narms crossed, body turned away.\n\n426\n00:20:54.006 --> 00:20:55.090\nI'm talking to Peter.\n\n427\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.510\nBut I've got my body turned away.\n\n428\n00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.930\nI'm looking at my watch or\nI'm checking my email.\n\n429\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.600\nI'm distracted, I'm nodding my head.\n\n430\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.460\nBut I got a bad facial expression.\n\n431\n00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.640\nThere's a big difference between and.\n\n432\n00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.850\nAnd if I look across and someone's got,\nthey're shaking their head no,\n\n433\n00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.340\ngot a bad thing, and\nthey're looking at their computer,\n\n434\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.490\nthey're looking at their watch, they're\nlooking out the window, I have lost them.\n\n435\n00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.242\nThey are not paying, if they're playing\nwith their glasses or something,\n\n436\n00:21:20.242 --> 00:21:22.363\nthey're looking through their glasses.\n\n437\n00:21:22.363 --> 00:21:23.755\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Obviously, I'm not paying attention.\n\n438\n00:21:23.755 --> 00:21:24.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, go on.\n\n439\n00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Got him right there.\n\n440\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.730\nNow he just makes a good point.\n\n441\n00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:29.790\nI was teasing with him.\n\n442\n00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.920\nBut if someone takes their\nglasses to clean them real quick,\n\n443\n00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.100\nputs them on and\nre-engages you immediately like Peter did,\n\n444\n00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.830\nthank you, I know they were\njust cleaning their glasses.\n\n445\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.260\nBut if they're spinning their\nglasses through the thing and\n\n446\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.180\nthey're cleaning them for five or\nsix minutes, I've lost them, they're gone.\n\n447\n00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.720\nI won't go into this in any more depth.\n\n448\n00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.650\nThere's a lot more stuff.\n\n449\n00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:47.480\nYou guys know what it looks.\n\n450\n00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.940\nBut here's the point.\n\n451\n00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.300\nThe vast majority of people do not\nmonitor their own body language.\n\n452\n00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.590\nThey don't think about it.\n\n453\n00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.520\nThey don't make an effort to improve it.\n\n454\n00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.120\nThey don't catch themselves\nwhen they're doing it poorly.\n\n455\n00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.702\n&gt;&gt; So an excellent communicator.\n\n456\n00:22:01.702 --> 00:22:03.345\nAnd especially think about this on a team.\n\n457\n00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:06.620\nThere's only five or six other,\nten people you're communicating with, you\n\n458\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.390\ncan not afford to look disengaged, like\nyou don't care, like you're not listening.\n\n459\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.880\nYou gotta look like you're there and\nyou gotta actually be there.\n\n460\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.410\nSo monitor every now and then,\nstop and look at yourself from above.\n\n461\n00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.870\nGo to the balcony, look down and\nsay, what do I look like?\n\n462\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.410\nAm I leaning in, am I smiling?\n\n463\n00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.850\nAm I head nodding, am I taking notes?\n\n464\n00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.780\nAm I making eye contact\nwith people at table?\n\n465\n00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.370\nAnd if not, catch yourself and fix it.\n\n466\n00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.030\nBecause most people,\nthe vast majority of people, again, sit or\n\n467\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:41.070\ntalk without any thinking about what\nsignal am I sending with my body language?\n\n468\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.840\nAnd because of that they can\nsend a very negative signal,\n\n469\n00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.820\neven though they truly do care and\nthey want to be engaged.\n\n470\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.220\nThey just don't look engaged.\n\n471\n00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's a great point\nbecause most people aren't aware of\n\n472\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:52.400\nthis like you said.\n\n473\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.907\nAnd if you were just crossing\nyour arms because you're cold or\n\n474\n00:22:54.907 --> 00:22:57.472\nyou're looking away because\nsomething happened over there.\n\n475\n00:22:57.472 --> 00:22:59.420\nYou're cleaning your glasses.\n\n476\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.390\nThat might be fine to you,\n\n477\n00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.160\nbut you've gotta remember how other people\nare perceiving the things you're doing.\n\n478\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.510\nSo it's good to be aware of what those\nthings are so you know how that works.\n\n479\n00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.000\nSo what are some other\ntopics we should cover here?\n\n480\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.290\n&gt;&gt; And we're digging in pretty deep here,\nPeter.\n\n481\n00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.000\nThe next thing I wanna talk\nabout is social styles.\n\n482\n00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.450\nAnd many of you watching this might have\nbeen through social styles training.\n\n483\n00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.630\nNot everybody has.\n\n484\n00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:22.790\nAnd I'll give you a quick overview.\n\n485\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:26.030\nThere's, the way I,\nthey call it a disk profile, many people.\n\n486\n00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.120\nBut I use it slightly different.\n\n487\n00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.520\nI use d as in a driver.\n\n488\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.200\nAnd that's someone who\nlikes to talk a lot and\n\n489\n00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.230\nit doesn't really care all\nthat much about people.\n\n490\n00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.660\nSo they like to give orders and they\ndon't have a strong personal connection.\n\n491\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.390\nA driver is someone that when you're\ncommunicating with them, wants facts.\n\n492\n00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.965\nThey want bullet points,\nthey want it quick, they want information.\n\n493\n00:23:49.965 --> 00:23:53.173\nThey just want the most important\ninformation, the essential information.\n\n494\n00:23:53.173 --> 00:23:57.302\nIf you come to a driver and\nyou're trying to give a big explanation,\n\n495\n00:23:57.302 --> 00:23:59.411\nbring him a stack of data that big.\n\n496\n00:23:59.411 --> 00:24:02.280\nYou are speaking in a language\nthey don't understand.\n\n497\n00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.880\nYou're communicating with them in\na way that they are not comfortable.\n\n498\n00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.020\nSo the idea here is, if you're with\na driver, you've gotta bring them short\n\n499\n00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.870\nstuff, couple of pages,\nbullet points, you gotta be quick,\n\n500\n00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.610\nyou gotta get to the point quick, you\ngotta move on, and make a decision fast.\n\n501\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.420\nThat's what a driver wants, and as I'm\nexplaining these think about what you are.\n\n502\n00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.110\nThink about how you like communication,\nso driver is one.\n\n503\n00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.120\nThe next one is expressive.\n\n504\n00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.580\nAn expressive someone that likes to\ntalk and likes to be around people.\n\n505\n00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.580\nActually they like to be\nthe center of attention.\n\n506\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.340\nThey're the person that the driver\njust wants to get stuff done.\n\n507\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.215\nThe expressive says,\nhow will it make me look?\n\n508\n00:24:38.215 --> 00:24:42.360\n[LAUGH] If it will make me look good,\nthen I'm all on board.\n\n509\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.970\nExpressive doesn't need\na ton of information.\n\n510\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.500\nThey just need to know,\nhow will it impact them?\n\n511\n00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.720\nWill it make them look good?\n\n512\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.690\nWill it or put them at risk and\npotentially make them look bad?\n\n513\n00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.070\nAn expressive is usually highly motivated,\nexcited.\n\n514\n00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.920\nSo they're the kind of person that,\npassion and\n\n515\n00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.080\nexcitement and motivation communication\nreally resonates with them\n\n516\n00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.038\nbecause they like to get\npumped up about stuff.\n\n517\n00:25:04.038 --> 00:25:05.750\nThey're slow to make a decision.\n\n518\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.670\nWhen you give them information\nuntil they figure it out,\n\n519\n00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.140\nhow it will make them look,\nhow it will impact them.\n\n520\n00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.450\nThat's your expressive.\n\n521\n00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.400\nNext one is called the amiable.\n\n522\n00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.771\nAnd the amiable is someone who\ndoesn't like to talk a lot but\n\n523\n00:25:16.771 --> 00:25:18.059\ncares a lot about other people.\n\n524\n00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:23.494\nThis is about, in most organizations,\nabout 60% of the workforce.\n\n525\n00:25:23.494 --> 00:25:28.265\nBut if you go into like medical or\nhealthcare or something like that, or\n\n526\n00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:31.286\nsocial work, it spikes up to 80 to 90%,\n\n527\n00:25:31.286 --> 00:25:37.455\nbecause these are folks that really\ncare about the team above anything else.\n\n528\n00:25:37.455 --> 00:25:40.390\nThey're the ones that you need to bring\nthem information about how will it\n\n529\n00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:41.880\nimpact the team.\n\n530\n00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.372\nThey are not as worried\nabout themselves but\n\n531\n00:25:43.372 --> 00:25:46.130\nthey're very worried about how everyone,\nwhat everybody else thinks.\n\n532\n00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.150\nHow they’ll be impacted?\n\n533\n00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.560\nWhat’s going on with them?\n\n534\n00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:54.440\nSo, when you’re communicating with a high\namiable, you got make them comfortable.\n\n535\n00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.650\nThat it’s good for the team,\n\n536\n00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.110\nit’s good for all of us,\nit’s gonna be a win for all of us.\n\n537\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.780\nAn expressive likes all\nthe attention on them.\n\n538\n00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.370\nWe're going to win an award from the boss,\nfrom the CEO.\n\n539\n00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.970\nThe amiable doesn't want\nthe personal attention.\n\n540\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.700\nOur team will win an award.\n\n541\n00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.580\nYou will not motivate or communicate well\nwith an amiable if you say you're going to\n\n542\n00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.170\ndo this, you're in charge of it, you'll\nget all the credit, you have to, you're\n\n543\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.930\ngoing to have to tell other people on the\nteam what to do, it doesn't work so good.\n\n544\n00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.562\nAnd the last one is the analytic.\n\n545\n00:26:25.562 --> 00:26:28.400\nAnd the analytic is someone\nwho doesn't ask questions and\n\n546\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.560\ndoesn't really interact with people,\nthey interact with data.\n\n547\n00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.890\nThey're always looking for\nthe right answer.\n\n548\n00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.020\nThe driver wants an answer fast.\n\n549\n00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.620\nThe expressive wants an answer\nthat makes them look good.\n\n550\n00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.710\nThe amiable wants an answer\nthat makes everybody happy.\n\n551\n00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.690\nThe analytic wants the answer\nthat's right and correct and\n\n552\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.530\nhas all the right numbers on it.\n\n553\n00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.177\nSo when you are dealing with\nsomeone who's highly analytical,\n\n554\n00:26:50.177 --> 00:26:52.588\nyou need to bring them lots of data,\nlots of information.\n\n555\n00:26:52.588 --> 00:26:56.290\nYou need to back up what you say\nwith research and other things.\n\n556\n00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.240\nBecause they need to know that I've\ngot all the information I need to\n\n557\n00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.170\nmake a good decision.\n\n558\n00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.730\nSo two things here.\n\n559\n00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.450\nNumber one, think about this\nwith everyone else on your team.\n\n560\n00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.430\nAnd people ask me all the time,\nwhat's the best communication style?\n\n561\n00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.840\nHere it is, the person you can flex.\n\n562\n00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.210\nThe person who looks around their team and\nsays Peter is an amiable.\n\n563\n00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.130\nAnd when I talk to him and\n\n564\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:21.610\ngive him information, I need to talk about\nthe team, about us, ask about his family,\n\n565\n00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:25.430\nsee how things are going and connect with\nhim personally, and make him feel safe.\n\n566\n00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.170\nJohn is a driver.\n\n567\n00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.390\nJohn doesn't wanna waste time.\n\n568\n00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.870\nJohn wants four bullet points, and\nboom, let's move on the agenda,\n\n569\n00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.710\nlet's move on the agenda,\nnext, next, next, next.\n\n570\n00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.010\nMight have somebody\nthat's highly analytical.\n\n571\n00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.360\nAnd by the way you need all\nthese people on your team,\n\n572\n00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.340\nbecause if you don't have an analytic, you\ndon't have anybody checking your facts.\n\n573\n00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.630\nAnd if you don't have an amiable,\neverybody is fighting.\n\n574\n00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.940\nI've worked with law teams where\neveryone's a driver and it ain't pretty.\n\n575\n00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.680\nSo step one is, what is everybody else\non your team, and being able to flex and\n\n576\n00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.750\nadjust your style to them.\n\n577\n00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:58.140\nAnd then two, taking a hard look in\nthe mirror and saying, what am I?\n\n578\n00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.860\nHow can I flex, and also let me share\nwith the other people on my team\n\n579\n00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.503\nwhat social style I am so\nthey know how I like to give information.\n\n580\n00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.270\nYears ago I had an assistant that worked\nfor me when I was running a large company.\n\n581\n00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.100\nWhen I'm running a company,\nI'm a driver, driver, driver.\n\n582\n00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.000\nShe was full amiable.\n\n583\n00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.446\nI would come in the morning and say,\nI do, a, b, c, d and I need them by noon,\n\n584\n00:28:19.446 --> 00:28:22.640\nand she'd go,\ndon't you wanna ask about my family?\n\n585\n00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.350\nAnd it wasn't until I realized that if I\ndidn't communicate in a style that was\n\n586\n00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.190\ncomfortable for her,\n\n587\n00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:32.030\nit was basically like I was yelling\nat her in a foreign language.\n\n588\n00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.830\nAnd if you want your team to work well,\nand I said this earlier,\n\n589\n00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:40.440\nthe responsibility for\neffective communication is always on you.\n\n590\n00:28:41.658 --> 00:28:44.850\nIf they didn't understand you, if you\ngave them the information the wrong way,\n\n591\n00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.710\nif you didn't match their social style and\n\n592\n00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:50.090\nthey don't understand,\nthat is your fault, not theirs.\n\n593\n00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.625\nWhich is why this takes so much work.\n\n594\n00:28:51.625 --> 00:28:56.930\n&gt;&gt; Sure, that, I think, helps us really\nunderstand effective communication,\n\n595\n00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.120\nbut now let's kind of shift gears and\n\n596\n00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.640\ntalk about how we can turn\nthat into collaboration.\n\n597\n00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.410\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's a couple of different\nthings to talk about with collaboration.\n\n598\n00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:09.052\nAnd the first thing I want to do is\nbriefly review again what we talked about\n\n599\n00:29:09.052 --> 00:29:12.519\nthe very first session, when we were\ntalking about launching a team,\n\n600\n00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:15.950\nis what level of collaboration\nis expected from the team?\n\n601\n00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.140\nNot all teams are highly collaborative.\n\n602\n00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.380\nYou've got some teams and\nthere was three levels if you recall.\n\n603\n00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.300\nThere was the team where\neveryone's independent.\n\n604\n00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:29.670\nI'm on the team, supposedly,\nbut my work is my own,\n\n605\n00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.050\nI work on my own time,\nI create my own work product.\n\n606\n00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.240\nThen I hand it in.\n\n607\n00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.730\nAnd my work becomes apart\nof the team's work.\n\n608\n00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.160\nAnd I use sports analogies for\nthese when we explain it the first time.\n\n609\n00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.950\nThat's like a golf team.\n\n610\n00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.240\nIt's me versus the course,\nno one else can help me.\n\n611\n00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.700\nI can have the highest score and\nI can do great but the team can lose.\n\n612\n00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.530\nThat's an independent team.\n\n613\n00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.560\nLevel two is an interdependent team, where\nwe're working together a little bit but\n\n614\n00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.700\nwe're also working apart.\n\n615\n00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.470\nI think you would see this\na lot in virtual teams.\n\n616\n00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.340\nWhere we're not always together,\nwe're working independently but\n\n617\n00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.910\nall of our stuff comes together and\nthe team, sorry.\n\n618\n00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.730\nSometimes I'm depending on\nother people on the team,\n\n619\n00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.580\nsometimes I'm working independently.\n\n620\n00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.110\nAgain, the sports analogy, baseball team.\n\n621\n00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.110\nWhen I'm out in the field I've got\nto play with the rest of the team,\n\n622\n00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.340\nI've got to help them, I've got to catch\nthe ball, throw it in, do all that, but\n\n623\n00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.530\nwhen I'm at the plate It's\njust me versus the pitcher.\n\n624\n00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.810\nNobody else can help me.\n\n625\n00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.720\nSo interdependent teams where\nsometimes I'm working alone,\n\n626\n00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.390\nsometimes I'm working in a team,\nand we're helping each other.\n\n627\n00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:31.530\nThe last one, which is what most real,\ntrue teams are, is a dependent team.\n\n628\n00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.870\nAnd a dependent team is\nwhere everybody's work\n\n629\n00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.010\nis connected to everybody else's work,\nwhere it's one group output.\n\n630\n00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:43.160\nWhere if one person on the team messes\nup it impacts everybody else negatively.\n\n631\n00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.430\nAnd my favorite example,\nsports analogy for\n\n632\n00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.270\nthat, is a Olympic four\nby four track team.\n\n633\n00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.270\nIf one of the people on the team\ndecides they're not gonna run, or\n\n634\n00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:57.320\ntosses the baton and doesn't pick it up,\nthe team, the whole team loses.\n\n635\n00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.440\nAll four people have to run,\nthey have to run their fastest, and\n\n636\n00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.230\nthey have to run for the finish line.\n\n637\n00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.150\nThey're totally dependent on each other.\n\n638\n00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.300\nSo before we can even talk\nabout collaboration on a team,\n\n639\n00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.720\nyou need to sit down with your team and\nsay, what kind of team are we?\n\n640\n00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.450\nAre we even a team or\nare we more of a work group?\n\n641\n00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:16.500\nAnd adjust the level of collaboration\nto what's appropriate for\n\n642\n00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.790\nthe kind of team you have.\n\n643\n00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:24.260\nNow I wanna talk about building a more\ncollaborative team once you understand it\n\n644\n00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.750\nis a dependent or independent team.\n\n645\n00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.260\nAnd here's the big idea\nwith collaboration.\n\n646\n00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.000\nSort of like extending trust,\nwe talked about that, you have to do it.\n\n647\n00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.280\nIf you want collaboration on the team,\nyou have to be highly collaborative.\n\n648\n00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.290\nYou want to be participatory.\n\n649\n00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.820\nYou want to see everybody else\non the team as a partner.\n\n650\n00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:45.613\nSo I've got a few ideas here that you've\ngotta do to build high collaboration on\n\n651\n00:31:45.613 --> 00:31:46.337\nyour team.\n\n652\n00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:48.101\nCouple of first ones.\n\n653\n00:31:48.101 --> 00:31:51.253\nYou've gotta be dependable,\nconsistent, and supportive.\n\n654\n00:31:51.253 --> 00:31:54.264\nDependable, another word I\nwould use there is reliable.\n\n655\n00:31:54.264 --> 00:31:55.888\nI can take your word to the bank.\n\n656\n00:31:55.888 --> 00:31:59.070\nIf I'm gonna collaborate with you,\nI need to know I can depend on you.\n\n657\n00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.338\nI don't wanna be on a team with\npeople that don't do what they say\n\n658\n00:32:01.338 --> 00:32:02.054\nthey're gonna do.\n\n659\n00:32:02.054 --> 00:32:04.015\nSo I've gotta be dependable, reliable,\n\n660\n00:32:04.015 --> 00:32:08.130\nI've also gotta be highly supportive\nof the other people on my team.\n\n661\n00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.270\nYou can not have a collaborative culture\nif people don't care about each other,\n\n662\n00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:12.980\nhelp each other,\n\n663\n00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.990\nsupport each other, celebrate together,\ngo through difficulties together.\n\n664\n00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.260\nGotta be supportive to everyone else.\n\n665\n00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.430\nAnd again, every time it makes\na rumor it starts with you.\n\n666\n00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.720\nIf you want the team to be more\ncollaborative with you, and\n\n667\n00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.540\nyou want to create\nthe collaborative culture,\n\n668\n00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.870\nyou're the on who has to be dependable and\nsupportive.\n\n669\n00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.890\nThe big one here is, easy to work with.\n\n670\n00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:40.010\nOften times on teams we get someone\nthat doesn't want to play by the rules.\n\n671\n00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.710\nAnd there is a couple of\ndifferent ways to handle this.\n\n672\n00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:47.270\nFirst of all, you want people that work\nwell with other people, that are easy to\n\n673\n00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:51.210\nwork with, they get their work done on\ntime, and you want to be that person.\n\n674\n00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:55.550\nYou want to go out of your way to not\ncause stress, not cause problems,\n\n675\n00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:59.790\nbe straightforward, be transparent,\nbring up issues as soon as they arise.\n\n676\n00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:03.570\nBe the one that holds\nthe team together and is\n\n677\n00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:08.760\nthe one that fosters lots of collaboration\nby helping people work well together.\n\n678\n00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.430\nNow, I'm gonna give you\na little bit other insight.\n\n679\n00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:15.030\nIf you've got somebody on the team\nwho is not easy to work with.\n\n680\n00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.970\nThey're difficult and challenging.\n\n681\n00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.530\nThere's a couple of different\nways to handle that.\n\n682\n00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.450\nWe're gonna talk about conflict in\na minute and how to handle conflict.\n\n683\n00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.790\nBut this is more on a structural basis.\n\n684\n00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.650\nYou go to that person and\n\n685\n00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:30.710\nsay, you're on the team, we want you\nto get on the team and get involved.\n\n686\n00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:31.880\nThat's a requirement.\n\n687\n00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.870\nNo prima donnas, no hanging out in\nthe corner, no not doing your work.\n\n688\n00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:38.690\nYou gotta be on the team.\n\n689\n00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:43.095\nIf they refuse to do that,\nthen there's two courses of action.\n\n690\n00:33:43.095 --> 00:33:46.781\nYou can go to the rest of the team and\nsay, we have somebody, Bill over here\n\n691\n00:33:46.781 --> 00:33:50.769\nwho's exceedingly talented, puts out\ngreat work, does everything on time,\n\n692\n00:33:50.769 --> 00:33:54.940\nfirst class work but you don't wanna\nhave anything to do with the team.\n\n693\n00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.810\nWe can depend that his work will be\ngreat and it will be on time but\n\n694\n00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.110\nhe doesn't want to come to meetings.\n\n695\n00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.400\nHe doesn't wanna do any of the after hour\nstuff, doesn't wanna have beer with us.\n\n696\n00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.860\nDoes not want any of that he just wants\nto do the work and turn it in and\n\n697\n00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.840\nyou go to the team and\nsay are you willing to let that happen.\n\n698\n00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.540\nAre you willing to allow one person on\nthis team to play outside of the team\n\n699\n00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.220\nrules and sometimes I will tell\nyou that teams will allow that.\n\n700\n00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.100\nThey will say he or she is so\ntalented has so much experience\n\n701\n00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.200\nbrings such quality to the team,\nwe're willing to let them break the rules.\n\n702\n00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.240\nBut all the rest of us know that we're\nmaking that agreement together and\n\n703\n00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.780\nwe're not gonna get upset about it or\nget frustrated or say it isn't fair,\n\n704\n00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:39.210\nbecause we've decided as a team to allow\nsomeone to not follow the team rules.\n\n705\n00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:43.210\nAndi n the last option is If\nthey won't get on the team and\n\n706\n00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.000\nplay with the team and the rest of the\nteam says, no, we want them on the team.\n\n707\n00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.660\nWe're not going to allow\nthem to break the rules.\n\n708\n00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.200\nThen, they are typically\nremoved from the team.\n\n709\n00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.010\nBecause if you allow one person on the\nteam to break the rules, not show up for\n\n710\n00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:58.100\nmeetings, not turn their work in,\nhave a bad attitude, refuse to cooperate,\n\n711\n00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.610\nas soon as you look the other way and\npretend that's not happening,\n\n712\n00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:06.010\nyou'll find that the whole team ends\nup there, and it will destroy the team.\n\n713\n00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:09.770\nSo that was, there’s a couple of\nmore here, I wanted to get to.\n\n714\n00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.720\nAgain, you keep your team collaborating,\n\n715\n00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.600\nkeep them on that shared goal,\nthat shared vision.\n\n716\n00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.030\nMakes sure everybody aligned.\n\n717\n00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.860\nIt’s a lot easier to have\na highly collaborative team\n\n718\n00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.660\nwhen you all care about where\nyou are going together.\n\n719\n00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.820\nYou understand where you are going\ntogether, you’re talking about,\n\n720\n00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.890\nyou’re supporting,\nyou’re excited about it.\n\n721\n00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:30.710\nWhich leads me to the last one is,\nwhen you get there, celebrate as a team.\n\n722\n00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.900\nDon't sit in your office and go yeah!\n\n723\n00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.160\nGo out and collaborate with the rest\nof the team, help each other.\n\n724\n00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.240\nThe way I like to say it is,\n\n725\n00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:43.230\nwhen there's a challenge, there's\na problem, as a team run to the problem.\n\n726\n00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:46.260\nRun to the problem, get in there shoulder\nto shoulder, roll up your sleeves,\n\n727\n00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.730\nwork hard, you know, fix that problem\ntogether as a unit, as a team,\n\n728\n00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:55.690\nas a highly collaborative group of people,\nbut when there's a win,\n\n729\n00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:59.680\nalso celebrate as a team and look at each\nother and say, we did this together.\n\n730\n00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.350\nWe did this cuz we got along,\ncuz we shared information.\n\n731\n00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:07.330\nAnd you reinforce all of the elements of\ncollaboration, trust, and teamwork, and\n\n732\n00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:11.290\nclearly show that because we did those\nthings, that's why we were successful.\n\n733\n00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, John,\nyou've alluded to it a couple of times,\n\n734\n00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:18.810\nbut what happens if we do have that\nteam that's just not getting along?\n\n735\n00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:22.040\nHow do we resolve those conflicts?\n\n736\n00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of work that's\nbeen done around how to handle conflict,\n\n737\n00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.810\nand there's a couple of models, and\nthere's one that I like very much.\n\n738\n00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.030\nI believe it came from the book\nDifficult Conversations.\n\n739\n00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.910\nIt was that or Crucial Conversations.\n\n740\n00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:35.820\nI recommend both of them because, again,\n\n741\n00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.350\nmuch like communication Peter, very rarely\nare we taught how to handle conflict.\n\n742\n00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:43.440\nMatter of fact I believe that\ncommunication skills and\n\n743\n00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.300\nconflict resolution skills should me\nmandatory in high school and college.\n\n744\n00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.000\nCuz these are two skills that\nif you don't learn them early,\n\n745\n00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.330\nyou're setting yourself up for\nsome pain later on in your life.\n\n746\n00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:56.910\nAnd these are not skills most people have,\n\n747\n00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:01.410\nso let's look at what I call\nthe five levels of confrontation.\n\n748\n00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.700\nSo you and I aren't getting along,\nwe have a little bit of an argument.\n\n749\n00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.360\nLevel one, let me just listen to you.\n\n750\n00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.500\nI'm not gonna interrupt you.\n\n751\n00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.190\nI'm not gonna say anything.\n\n752\n00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:14.430\nI would like to understand from your point\nof view, exactly what you're upset about,\n\n753\n00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.810\nhow you feel, what's wrong,\nand I'm not gonna say a word,\n\n754\n00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:21.350\nI'm just gonna sit here and listen to you.\n\n755\n00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.010\nHow often in your life\ndoes that happen to you?\n\n756\n00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not very often at all.\n\n757\n00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.150\n&gt;&gt; Not very often, no you don't\nget a lot of people to say that.\n\n758\n00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.270\nIf you can just to learn this one skill,\n\n759\n00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:31.990\nto say I can see that\nthings aren't going well.\n\n760\n00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.520\nWe're both starting to get a little angry.\n\n761\n00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.660\nLet me just stop right here and\nI wanna sit and listen to you.\n\n762\n00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.840\nIf you learn to just do this one thing,\n\n763\n00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.480\nyou'd probably be in the top 10% of\npeople that handle conflict well.\n\n764\n00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.860\nAnd it's usually not an hour of them\ntalking, it's a minute, or two, or three,\n\n765\n00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:45.790\nor five.\n\n766\n00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:49.080\nAnd very often they talk\nthemselves out of being mad.\n\n767\n00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.390\nThey realize it was a misconception,\nsomething they didn't think through or\n\n768\n00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:55.900\nthey start to explain it to themselves and\nit diffuses the situation.\n\n769\n00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.160\nLevel one, listen don't interrupt.\n\n770\n00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:02.440\nLevel two, another skill that very\nfew people get taught, I statements.\n\n771\n00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.060\nWhat an I statement says is,\n\n772\n00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.190\nlet me tell you from my point\nof view how I see things.\n\n773\n00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.670\nI'll use this great one for\nmarried couples.\n\n774\n00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:13.540\nI'm not taking out the trash.\n\n775\n00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.680\nInstead of getting mad, you say, from my\npoint of view, when you don't take out\n\n776\n00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.410\nthe trash, it feels to me like\nyou don't care about me and\n\n777\n00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:24.350\nyou don't respect me as a partner and\nI don't feel loved.\n\n778\n00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:26.846\nNow that's sounds like a lot of stuff but\n\n779\n00:38:26.846 --> 00:38:31.336\nthat's often how people feel in\na marriage or when you turn things late.\n\n780\n00:38:31.336 --> 00:38:36.770\nWhen you come to meetings late from my\npoint of view it feels disrespectful.\n\n781\n00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.540\nFeels like you don't care about he rest\nof the team and you don't care about us.\n\n782\n00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.210\nBut that's just how I see it.\n\n783\n00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:43.350\nThat may not be how it is,\nbut that's how I see it.\n\n784\n00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:46.657\nNow the reason it's so important to go\nback to that I statement is because if you\n\n785\n00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:49.530\nsay, when you come to me this late,\nyou're being disrespectful.\n\n786\n00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.640\nWhat does the other person say?\n\n787\n00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.490\nNo, I'm not.\n\n788\n00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:52.400\nYes, you are.\n\n789\n00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.100\nNo, I'm not.\n\n790\n00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.000\nI'm not disrespectful.\n\n791\n00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.510\nYes.\n\n792\n00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:58.690\nAnd you get into an argument, because\nI'm pointing the finger at you, you are.\n\n793\n00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:03.610\nThe I statement says I feel,\nI see, I think, my point of view.\n\n794\n00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.590\nSomeone can't see that when\nyou come to the meetings late,\n\n795\n00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.310\nI feel like you're being disrespectful.\n\n796\n00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.070\nI'm not.\n\n797\n00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.460\nI didn't say you were.\n\n798\n00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.360\nWhat I said is, I feel that way.\n\n799\n00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.790\nIt feels to me like you\ndon't care about the team.\n\n800\n00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:15.420\nYou can't argue with\nsomeone else's feelings.\n\n801\n00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.380\nYou can tell them they shouldn't\nfeel that way, and again you say,\n\n802\n00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.370\nwell, I probably shouldn't,\nbut that is how I feel.\n\n803\n00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.480\nAnd I just wanted to share\nmy feelings with you.\n\n804\n00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.560\nSo, level one,\n\n805\n00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.940\nlet me listen to you without interrupting\nyou at all, til I understand you.\n\n806\n00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:32.380\nLevel two, let me tell you how I feel\nfrom my point of view, how I see things.\n\n807\n00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.280\nI'm not attacking you,\nI'm just sharing my opinion, my ideas,\n\n808\n00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.530\nmy thoughts, my feelings.\n\n809\n00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:40.100\nLevel three is what I call negotiation,\nokay?\n\n810\n00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.130\nI've listened to you\nI've told you how I feel.\n\n811\n00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:44.290\nWe don't agree.\n\n812\n00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.800\nCan we agree to disagree agreeably?\n\n813\n00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.280\nCan we sit down and talk this through?\n\n814\n00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.121\nAnd this is where we hope that\nmost conflicts would be fixed.\n\n815\n00:39:53.121 --> 00:39:57.658\nA simple discussion between two people\nwho are collaborating on a team together,\n\n816\n00:39:57.658 --> 00:40:02.129\nwho respect each other That are partners\non the team, having a mature discussion\n\n817\n00:40:02.129 --> 00:40:06.440\nabout a difference of opinion, and\nnegotiating a win-win outcome.\n\n818\n00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.950\nI'll do this for you, you do this for\nme, I'll stop doing this,\n\n819\n00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:10.810\nI'll start turning stuff in on time.\n\n820\n00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.010\nI apologize, are we good?\n\n821\n00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.100\nEverything's great, let's move forward.\n\n822\n00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.080\nThat's level three.\n\n823\n00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.110\nIf that doesn't work, we're attempting\nto negotiate and things escalate.\n\n824\n00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.810\nAnd we're not getting to win-win.\n\n825\n00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:24.000\nIt's look towards going towards\nto lose-win or lose-lose.\n\n826\n00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.698\nLet me go to level four which\nis gentle confrontation.\n\n827\n00:40:27.698 --> 00:40:31.938\nAnd what gentle confrontation says is,\nI've listened to you,\n\n828\n00:40:31.938 --> 00:40:34.774\nI believe I understand your point of view.\n\n829\n00:40:34.774 --> 00:40:37.203\nI've told you how I feel\nfrom my point of view.\n\n830\n00:40:37.203 --> 00:40:40.070\nWe've discussed this and\nwe can't come to an agreement.\n\n831\n00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.010\nHere's the gentle confrontation.\n\n832\n00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.695\nIt would really be wonderful if\nyou would think this through and\n\n833\n00:40:45.695 --> 00:40:48.475\nchange your position,\nbecause if you don't,\n\n834\n00:40:48.475 --> 00:40:52.941\nit could have some serious ramifications\nto the team and nobody wants that.\n\n835\n00:40:52.941 --> 00:40:55.401\nSo it would sound like this,\nI listened to you,\n\n836\n00:40:55.401 --> 00:40:59.719\nI understand you're under a lot of stress,\nyou've got a lot of projects going on.\n\n837\n00:40:59.719 --> 00:41:04.409\nFrom my point of view, when you turn work\nin days late it impacts the whole team,\n\n838\n00:41:04.409 --> 00:41:08.399\nit's stressful for me, I feel stressed,\nI feel uncomfortable and\n\n839\n00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:11.487\nI feel angry at you and\nI don't want to feel that way.\n\n840\n00:41:11.487 --> 00:41:16.041\nI've asked you to please get things in\non time and if you don't it's gonna pull\n\n841\n00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:20.664\nthe whole team down and we're all gonna\nfail and I don't want that to happen, so\n\n842\n00:41:20.664 --> 00:41:25.043\nwould you please try in the future to\nget all of your assignments in on time.\n\n843\n00:41:25.043 --> 00:41:28.590\nI heard you, here's my point of view,\nwe can't come to an agreement.\n\n844\n00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:32.390\nI would really like it if you would\ndecide to do what I need you to do.\n\n845\n00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.713\nIf that doesn't work, then you go\nto the fifth and final final level\n\n846\n00:41:36.713 --> 00:41:40.928\nwhich is direct or firm confrontation, and\nit's got all the other stuff I just said.\n\n847\n00:41:40.928 --> 00:41:44.658\nI listened to you, I told you my point\nof view, we negotiated it didn't work,\n\n848\n00:41:44.658 --> 00:41:47.541\nI've asked you very politely to\nchange your point of view and\n\n849\n00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:51.181\nchange your actions and you won't,\nand if you don't you're off the team.\n\n850\n00:41:51.181 --> 00:41:54.317\nYou're gonna be in trouble I'm gonna\nfire you whatever it might be but\n\n851\n00:41:54.317 --> 00:41:55.930\nit's a threat.\n\n852\n00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:59.140\nYou will do it my way or it's the highway.\n\n853\n00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.862\nThere is no in between here,\nit's 100% you will do it my way.\n\n854\n00:42:02.862 --> 00:42:07.700\nPeter I have question for you, where did\nthe most people start in a confrontation.\n\n855\n00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.667\n&gt;&gt; Sadly I think they\nprobably start that last one.\n\n856\n00:42:09.667 --> 00:42:13.443\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, they start at level five and\nif you start at level five,\n\n857\n00:42:13.443 --> 00:42:15.160\nyou've got nowhere to go.\n\n858\n00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.118\nYou're at the highest\nlevel of confrontation.\n\n859\n00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:19.791\nSo, here's what I'm sharing with you and\n\n860\n00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:23.220\nI'm trying to teach you which is,\nstart at level one.\n\n861\n00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.480\nAnd it doesn't take an hour to go from\nlevel one to level five it can take two or\n\n862\n00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.080\nthree minutes it might take an hour,\nit might take two hours.\n\n863\n00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.663\nBut, generally it's only a couple of\nminutes but if you don't start at level\n\n864\n00:42:32.663 --> 00:42:36.572\none, with let me listen to you, level two,\nlet me tell you how I feel, level three,\n\n865\n00:42:36.572 --> 00:42:40.372\ncan we figure this out, and level four, it\nwould be really nice if we could, if you\n\n866\n00:42:40.372 --> 00:42:44.448\ndon't do those first four, you start five,\nyou've got nowhere to go back, it can only\n\n867\n00:42:44.448 --> 00:42:48.353\nwhether is no you've got them in a corner\nalready and it isn't gonna turn out good.\n\n868\n00:42:48.353 --> 00:42:52.593\nAnd as you mentioned Peter,\nmost people start at level five and\n\n869\n00:42:52.593 --> 00:42:54.356\nits already a huge fight.\n\n870\n00:42:54.356 --> 00:42:56.897\n&gt;&gt; Sure, its not very\nproductive at theat point then,\n\n871\n00:42:56.897 --> 00:43:00.690\nit looks like we are kinda getting\ncloser in time, any final thoughts?\n\n872\n00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, much like I said before,\nno honesty, no trust, no trust no team.\n\n873\n00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.240\nNo communication, no collaboration, and\nthe other big idea is you gotta work on\n\n874\n00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.667\nthese skills, I've just given you a ton\nof information, this is not something you\n\n875\n00:43:13.667 --> 00:43:18.157\nlearn overnight, it's something you work\non, you hone, you practice, you try,\n\n876\n00:43:18.157 --> 00:43:22.361\nyou look at other people with great\ncommunication, how can I learn from them?\n\n877\n00:43:22.361 --> 00:43:27.151\nIt takes a long time of consistent effort,\nbut I will promise you this, every step of\n\n878\n00:43:27.151 --> 00:43:31.402\nincrease you make in being a better\ncommunicator will help you in your job,\n\n879\n00:43:31.402 --> 00:43:32.973\nyour career and your life.\n\n880\n00:43:32.973 --> 00:43:34.613\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe great thing is you can go back and\n\n881\n00:43:34.613 --> 00:43:37.300\nlook at some of those points\nthat you've missed again.\n\n882\n00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:41.400\nFeel free to rewind and watch those again\nor watch the previous episodes where we\n\n883\n00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.450\ntalked about some of these\nconcepts in a little more depth.\n\n884\n00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:47.521\nSo definitely check those things out, but\nfor now I think we're at a good stopping\n\n885\n00:43:47.521 --> 00:43:50.648\npoint for this episode so\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap it up and\n\n886\n00:43:50.648 --> 00:43:53.257\nsign off, I've been your host,\nPeter VanRysdam.\n\n887\n00:43:53.257 --> 00:43:54.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n888\n00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.573\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n889\n00:43:56.573 --> 00:44:05.599\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Peter Van Rysdam and\n\n4\n00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.810\ntoday we're continuing in our series\nabout leading technology teams.\n\n5\n00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.842\nAnd specifically today we're\ntalking about motivating and\n\n6\n00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:17.454\noptimizing team performance.\n\n7\n00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.280\nAnd here to help us do that we have the\ngreat motivator and optimizer John Spence,\n\n8\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.660\nJohn, how are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.700\n&gt;&gt; Good, you feel motivated\njust getting ready for this?\n\n10\n00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.520\n&gt;&gt; I'll see, we'll see after this because\nfirst, and that's a great place to start I\n\n11\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.030\nthink we really need to understand how\nwe define motivation in this contest.\n\n12\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.560\n&gt;&gt; Cool, great way to hit it off because\nthere's, well, I have a different\n\n13\n00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.610\ndefinition than most people I just\nlooked at the word and broke it down.\n\n14\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.300\nWhat is the motive for action.\n\n15\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.360\nAnd the key idea here is it's\ndifferent for everybody.\n\n16\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.130\nWhat motivates me is not what motivates\nPeter or Margaret, or anybody else,\n\n17\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.640\nor Kim or Tim.\n\n18\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.020\nEach person is motivated for\ntheir own reasons.\n\n19\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.100\nIt breaks down to this key idea though\nis that all people are motivated\n\n20\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.840\nby one of two things,\nthe desire to gain pleasure or avoid pain.\n\n21\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.560\nAt any level, when you break it down,\nI'm either trying to move\n\n22\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.660\naway from something that I don't want,\nor towards something that I do want.\n\n23\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.760\nDo you go to the gym to lose weight or\nget in shape?\n\n24\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.843\nDo you take vitamins to stay healthy or\nnot get sick?\n\n25\n00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:23.198\nSo everyone when you look at it you\nbreak it down is, it's a desire.\n\n26\n00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:25.253\nI'm motivated to go out and\ncapture something,\n\n27\n00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:28.050\ndo something, achieve something,\nget something I want.\n\n28\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.450\nOr I'm motivated to stay away from it\nto reduce risk, to reduce pain and\n\n29\n00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.320\nmake sure that I don't take any\nchances that would make me fail.\n\n30\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.448\n&gt;&gt; All right, now John I see next on\nour outline we've got social styles and\n\n31\n00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:44.471\nI know in a previous episode which you\nshould go back and watch we talked\n\n32\n00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.890\nabout social styles as they relate\nto communication within the team.\n\n33\n00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.755\n&gt;&gt; What do we mean are social styles\ndifferent as they relate to motivation?\n\n34\n00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:56.445\n&gt;&gt; No, when we're looking at\ncommunications with social styles,\n\n35\n00:01:56.445 --> 00:02:00.015\nwe talked about drivers, expressives,\namiables and analytics and\n\n36\n00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:04.745\nthe fact of how much information they need\nto make a decision when you're on a team.\n\n37\n00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:07.335\nNow we're gonna talk about\nhow they are motivated.\n\n38\n00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:12.150\nSo drivers, you remember they\nare the ones that like to talk and\n\n39\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.040\nweren't that concerned about other people.\n\n40\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.594\nThey are motivated by making decisions,\nmaking things happen,\n\n41\n00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:22.401\ngetting things going and\nif you wanna reward a driver,\n\n42\n00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:26.458\na very high level certificate or\nthe president's award,\n\n43\n00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:31.792\nsomething prestigious to show that they\nhave achieved at a very high level.\n\n44\n00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:36.569\nCuz that's, for the typical driver,\nif you go into their office, they're gonna\n\n45\n00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.072\nhave very high level plaques works,\npicture me with the president, here is,\n\n46\n00:02:41.072 --> 00:02:45.980\npicture me walking on the moon, here is\nmy 14 diplomas from the top colleges.\n\n47\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.410\nThey're trying to show tremendous\ncompetence, that's for a driver.\n\n48\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.680\nNow an expressive, somebody like me,\nis they wanna be the center of attention.\n\n49\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.880\nThey're the ones you get up on stage.\n\n50\n00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.470\nAnd you give them the annual award,\nand you have balloons so\n\n51\n00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.720\nyou need to learn\neverything else like that.\n\n52\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.530\nYou talk about how great they are and\nwhat they accomplished, and\n\n53\n00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.700\nit's a celebration and they're the center\nof attention for the celebration.\n\n54\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.560\nThat's an expressive.\n\n55\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.070\nNow this is interesting amiable\nis almost the exact different.\n\n56\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.089\nThere's someone that doesn't talk a lot\nbut cares a lot about other people.\n\n57\n00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.694\nIf you took them up on stage and\ngave them Employee of the Year Award and\n\n58\n00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:23.422\nsingled them out as the best in\nthe organization and you had balloons and\n\n59\n00:03:23.422 --> 00:03:28.430\nsigns and everything else like that, you\nwould likely never see them do that again.\n\n60\n00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.210\nBecause you've just attempted to\nmotivate them in a way that is\n\n61\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.620\npretty much the reverse\nof their social style.\n\n62\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.993\nThey're the ones that would\nprefer their team winning, or\n\n63\n00:03:38.993 --> 00:03:42.848\nbeing part of the group,\nand not being singled out.\n\n64\n00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:45.750\nFor the expressive, they're gonna want\na picture of themselves with the CEO of\n\n65\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.190\nthe company, or something like that.\n\n66\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.992\nOr, look at me with the important people.\n\n67\n00:03:48.992 --> 00:03:52.350\nYour amiables gonna want a team picture,\noftentimes they'd just rather have\n\n68\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.900\na picture of the team\nwithout them even in it.\n\n69\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.990\nI learned a long time ago with\none of the folks that worked for\n\n70\n00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.010\nme that was highly amiable that praising\nher didn't really have much impact.\n\n71\n00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.686\nSo I wrote a letter to her husband and\nher kids saying how great she was,\n\n72\n00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:09.865\nhow much she was contributing\nto the success of the company,\n\n73\n00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:13.440\nhow much the team depended on her,\nand everybody loved her.\n\n74\n00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.154\nAnd that was probably the highest form of\nmotivation I can possibly give to her.\n\n75\n00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:22.520\nAnd then the last one the analytic, thy\njust wanna be rewarded for being right.\n\n76\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.040\nIf you give them the reward for\nnailing a project, for\n\n77\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.250\ngetting it concise, getting it on time\neverything is perfect that was great.\n\n78\n00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.230\nThe most important thing for them is\nto be recognized for being correct,\n\n79\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.490\ngiving correct data,\ngiving the right information.\n\n80\n00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.095\nThe next thing I wanna\ntalk about there so,\n\n81\n00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:44.530\na couple of ideas here is along\nthese lines, after we figured out\n\n82\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.410\nit is someone looking for\nrecognition, for team recognition,\n\n83\n00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.550\nindividual recognition, for being look at\nit that they're really highly competent.\n\n84\n00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.820\nThe best thing you can do is ask them.\n\n85\n00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.810\nAgain, when I ran companies and\n\n86\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.570\nI worked with other companies where,\ndon't guess on what motivates someone.\n\n87\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.370\nSome people are highly motivated by money,\n\n88\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.740\nsome other people are not\nmotivated by money at all.\n\n89\n00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.670\nThey might be motivated by flexibility,\nor awards, or\n\n90\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.120\na job promotions, or all kinds of things.\n\n91\n00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.273\nSo, the best thing you can do is sit\ndown with the people on your team and\n\n92\n00:05:17.273 --> 00:05:19.948\nif you're leading them and\nworking together and ask them,\n\n93\n00:05:19.948 --> 00:05:23.159\nif something went really well, and\nyou achieve something important,\n\n94\n00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.540\nwhat are three levels,\nwhat's the smaller word you might like?\n\n95\n00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.160\nSome people are gonna say candy bar,\nI love Snickers bar, I'm diabetic,\n\n96\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.271\nif you give me a candy, absolutely\n[LAUGH] the worst thing you can give me,\n\n97\n00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:34.390\nI don't need that.\n\n98\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.805\nSo what's something small that\nyou would rather appreciate.\n\n99\n00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:41.290\nMaybe it's a Starbucks gift card, maybe\nit's a go home an hour earlier something\n\n100\n00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.262\nlike that or give me a Monday off so\nI can spend a long weekend with my kids.\n\n101\n00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:48.813\nThen you ask them what's a medium\nlevel one maybe that's some money,\n\n102\n00:05:48.813 --> 00:05:52.545\nmaybe that's a chance on a project,\nmaybe that's changing the office,\n\n103\n00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:55.170\ngetting a new laptop or\nsomething like that.\n\n104\n00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.250\nAnd then last one is what\nwould be the major reward.\n\n105\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.229\nIf you on this team delivered\nsomething unbelievable.\n\n106\n00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.860\nIf you played a major role\nin helping us be successful.\n\n107\n00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.330\nWhat sort of large reward would motivate\nyou, and often times that one is money.\n\n108\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.600\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and\nwe've talked in previous episodes about\n\n109\n00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.050\nkind of a shared purpose as a company or\nas a team and\n\n110\n00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.820\nif it's a larger company, maybe your\npurpose is more minute to your team.\n\n111\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.760\nBut achieving something towards that\npurpose can be a big motivator as well.\n\n112\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we see now with the younger\ngenerations coming into the workforce that\n\n113\n00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.300\nhaving a worthy purpose,\nachieving a meaningful goal,\n\n114\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.430\nmaking a difference is one of if not\nthe highest motivator, even above pay.\n\n115\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.480\nWhen we look at it, as long as someone's\ngetting paid fairly, 10% above or\n\n116\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.310\nbelow what they would make to\ndo the same job anyplace else.\n\n117\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.891\nAs long as you get parity on pay a major,\n\n118\n00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:54.195\nmajor motivator is am I working\non something that's important,\n\n119\n00:06:54.195 --> 00:06:58.811\ndo I have a meaningful purpose to get\nme out in bed in the morning excited\n\n120\n00:06:58.811 --> 00:07:03.303\nto know that the work I'm doing is\nmaking a difference in the world.\n\n121\n00:07:03.303 --> 00:07:06.542\nAs I look at that there's a couple\nthing to think about there and\n\n122\n00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:10.757\nthere's a new idea that I actually learned\nwhen I was reserved in New Zealand doing\n\n123\n00:07:10.757 --> 00:07:14.140\nsome work with one of their sport\nteams around the idea of legacy.\n\n124\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.640\nAnd at a higher level, even above\nworthy purpose to the organization is,\n\n125\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.210\nwhat is were the purpose for\nme personally?\n\n126\n00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.340\nWhat kind of a legacy do I wanna leave?\n\n127\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.910\nAnd that's really on three levels.\n\n128\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.720\nIt's your personal\nlegacy with your family.\n\n129\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.850\nAnd the interesting is people, Peter,\nthink that legacy is after I'm gone.\n\n130\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.730\nIt's kinda hard to hope that you have\na good legacy after you're gone.\n\n131\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.040\nThe time to create a great legacy\nis while you're still here.\n\n132\n00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.540\nSo the idea around this is working towards\nsomething today so that years from now,\n\n133\n00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.310\nthat you will have left a legacy\nthat you worked on intentionally.\n\n134\n00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.780\nSo level one is your personal legacy.\n\n135\n00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.400\nWhat would you want your\nfamily to remember about you?\n\n136\n00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.530\nWhat kind of an impact do you want to have\non your spouse, your significant other,\n\n137\n00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.010\nand children if you have them?\n\n138\n00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:09.010\nThe people closest to you, your immediate\nfamily, your in-laws, things like that\n\n139\n00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.520\non a very strong, very personal level,\nwhat legacy do you wanna leave?\n\n140\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.810\nSecond level is on your friends and\ncommunity.\n\n141\n00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.502\nSo either way, I always ask about this is,\nif someone were to come into town who had\n\n142\n00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:25.718\nnever met you before, and they were\nsitting down with someone who knew you\n\n143\n00:08:25.718 --> 00:08:30.410\nwell and they said, please describe to me\nwhat John Spence is like and the impact,\n\n144\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.471\nhow he's involved in a community?\n\n145\n00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:34.940\nWhat are the words you'd like to have\ncome out of that person's mouth?\n\n146\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.070\nWhat are the things you want to\nbe known for/remembered for?\n\n147\n00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.450\nAnd then the last one\nis a leadership legacy.\n\n148\n00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.280\nWhat's a legacy you want\nto leave on your company,\n\n149\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.610\non the people you work with, on your team?\n\n150\n00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.840\nAnd again, it might be if\nyou just moved off the team.\n\n151\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.620\nIf you've been on the team for\na year or two years and\n\n152\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.560\nyou transition, what legacy will\nyou leave behind for the team?\n\n153\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.330\nNow, let's take this to\nanother level of motivation.\n\n154\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:01.220\nWhen your personal legacy, business\nlegacy, community legacy, friend legacy\n\n155\n00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.800\nall line up and they're aligned with what\nyou're doing at your organization and\n\n156\n00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.660\nyou're doing your team that's\nan extremely high level of motivation.\n\n157\n00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.170\nThat is where you are personally\nvery committed and\n\n158\n00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.750\nbeing able to achieve things on the team,\nin the company,\n\n159\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.420\nmaking great things happen is also\nvery personally rewarding to you.\n\n160\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.139\nBig idea around this, though, is it's hard\nto understand the legacy if you aren't\n\n161\n00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:27.275\nclear about a couple of other things.\n\n162\n00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.410\nThe first one is what\nare your core values?\n\n163\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.970\nAnd I've got a great phrase for this.\n\n164\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.530\nWhen values are clear decisions are easy.\n\n165\n00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.097\nIt's very hard to be motivated if\nyou don't know if you're moving in\n\n166\n00:09:38.097 --> 00:09:40.010\nthe direction of what you want to do.\n\n167\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.900\nAnd again, I said at the very beginning,\nmotivation is personal.\n\n168\n00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.000\nI can't motivate you as a leader or\nas a team person.\n\n169\n00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.560\nI have to understand what's important to\nyou, and help you to understand how being\n\n170\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.850\ngreat on the team is gonna advance your\npersonal motivation, your personal goals.\n\n171\n00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.690\nAnd a big part of that is, do you get to\nlive your values everyday on the team.\n\n172\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.290\nAnd I teach a lot of classes.\n\n173\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:06.092\nPeter, to senior executives and I'll\nget 100, 150, 200 of them in the room.\n\n174\n00:10:06.092 --> 00:10:10.860\nAnd I will ask them, how many of you have\na written list of your personal core\n\n175\n00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.626\nvalues that you use to lead your life,\nguide your life by on a daily basis and\n\n176\n00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:19.420\nto make the most important\ndecisions in your life.\n\n177\n00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.300\nAnd out of 100, only 3 or\n4 will ever raise their hands.\n\n178\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.406\nSo a big suggestion I have here\nis to think that through and\n\n179\n00:10:26.406 --> 00:10:28.030\nsay what are my core values?\n\n180\n00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:32.470\nThat leads me to one more thing,\nwhich is personal definition of success.\n\n181\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.070\nAgain, if I ask people do you have\na written down clear definition for you,\n\n182\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.710\nnot for anybody else, not society,\nnot what anybody else told you to do,\n\n183\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.780\nhave you sat down and truly decided\nwhat success looks like to you?\n\n184\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.905\nWhat would have to happen?\n\n185\n00:10:46.905 --> 00:10:48.510\nWhat would you have to have, do, be?\n\n186\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.890\nWhat would have to happen in your life for\n\n187\n00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.300\nyou to go to bed at night and\nsay I'm a very successful person?\n\n188\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.990\nAnd I wanna challenge all of you watching\nthis to do this through exercises.\n\n189\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:02.773\nSit down and list out your top five or\nsix core values what are the fundamental\n\n190\n00:11:02.773 --> 00:11:07.930\nthings that drive you as an individual,\nthe most important things in your life and\n\n191\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.867\nwhat is your personal\ndefinition of success?\n\n192\n00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:13.000\nWhat would make you feel successful?\n\n193\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.650\nAnd if you really wanna motivate somebody\non a team, it's when the team and\n\n194\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.630\nthe leader can figure out a way that\nthey can align and match the person's\n\n195\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.520\nvalues and their definition of success\nwith what they're doing on the team.\n\n196\n00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.150\nAgain, you put that with purpose,\n\n197\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.330\nyou've now got one of the highest\nlevels of motivation you can achieve.\n\n198\n00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.570\n&gt;&gt; And I bet if you went back ask those\npeople what those motivators were and\n\n199\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.480\nthose values,\nmoney's not gonna be up there on the top.\n\n200\n00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.940\nThey're talking about the experience.\n\n201\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.500\nThey're talking about impacting\npeople's lives and that type of thing.\n\n202\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.130\n&gt;&gt; Money's usually anywhere\nfrom number eight to number 13.\n\n203\n00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.748\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n204\n00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:47.611\n&gt;&gt; I mean you gotta get paid well.\n\n205\n00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:48.500\nYou gotta pay the bills.\n\n206\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.520\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Gotta take care of your family.\n\n207\n00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.340\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; But that's not your legacy,\n\n208\n00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.140\nat the end of the day it's not well\nmy legacy is I made $2 million,\n\n209\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.580\nit's I provided for my family, or\n\n210\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.870\nI was able to make a difference\nby creating this product.\n\n211\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.622\n&gt;&gt; I had lunch with a CEO this week\nthat says I've never been at a funeral\n\n212\n00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:05.710\nprocession that had a Brinks\ntruck at the end of it.\n\n213\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.336\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:12:07.336 --> 00:12:08.360\n&gt;&gt; That's a fair point.\n\n215\n00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.740\nSo I think we've covered\nmotivation pretty well.\n\n216\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:17.321\nNow let's talk about optimization and\nhow that relates back to the team.\n\n217\n00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:21.221\n&gt;&gt; We're starting to get to a place here\nwhere we're touching on a lot of the same\n\n218\n00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:24.380\nthings because motivation,\ncollaboration, commitment.\n\n219\n00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.260\nA lot of that is if you want\na highly optimized team,\n\n220\n00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.000\nthose are the things you have to have.\n\n221\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.290\n&gt;&gt; So as we look at optimization\non a team, a few key ideas.\n\n222\n00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.650\nAnd I've written a few notes here.\n\n223\n00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.930\nAnd I'm gonna say this\nin a very specific way.\n\n224\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.930\nThis comes from a big Harvard research,\nand one of the key things\n\n225\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.910\nto getting people on track and\nreally getting collaborating well is\n\n226\n00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:54.350\na sharply focused, compelling, and\nwell-communicated vision and strategy.\n\n227\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.140\nIf I'm gonna optimize my team,\nI have to sit down and\n\n228\n00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.670\nclearly explain where we're going,\nwhat does it look like,\n\n229\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.350\nwhat's most important and\nhow specifically are we gonna get there.\n\n230\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.110\nWhich brings me to number two,\nis you can't have an optimized team\n\n231\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.350\nif everybody doesn't understand\ntheir task, their role, their goal.\n\n232\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.230\nBig, big phrase I use a lot you've\nprobably heard it before in these\n\n233\n00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.580\nsessions, ambiguity breeds mediocrity.\n\n234\n00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.540\nWithout clarity on a team, it's impossible\nto have optimization on a team.\n\n235\n00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.010\nIf people are guessing at\nwhat they're suppose to do,\n\n236\n00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.260\nthis is not an optimized situation.\n\n237\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.740\nSo underneath that you've got\na constantly communicate those things.\n\n238\n00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.630\nWhat's our vision, what's our strategy,\nwhat's our major goals,\n\n239\n00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.910\nwhat are the tactics we're gonna\nuse there, who is responsible?\n\n240\n00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.770\nConstantly keeping that in front of people\nbecause it helps them prioritize their\n\n241\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.550\ntime, optimize what they're working on,\nand\n\n242\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.000\nbig thing figure out what to say no to.\n\n243\n00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:54.300\nI see a lot of teams that\noperate sub-optimally\n\n244\n00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.630\nbecause they're spending a lot of\ntime on things that don't add value.\n\n245\n00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.750\nThey're going back and making\ndecisions that have already been made.\n\n246\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.650\nThey're focusing on parts of the project\n\n247\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.380\nthat don't add any value\nto the overall project.\n\n248\n00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.480\nAnd taking away all that extra knowledge,\ntime, energy,\n\n249\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.170\neffort, money and wasting it on things\nthat aren't moving the project forward.\n\n250\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.160\nAs part of that, and we've talked\nabout this in the accountabilities,\n\n251\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.520\nyou can't have that level of focus\n\n252\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.830\nwithout people understanding where\nthe team stands against the goals.\n\n253\n00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.610\nSo the idea again of track and post.\n\n254\n00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.556\nIf I'm gonna have a highly optimized team,\nI gotta know where everyone on the team\n\n255\n00:14:32.556 --> 00:14:35.757\nneeds to know where they stand,\nwhere the rest of the team stands,\n\n256\n00:14:35.757 --> 00:14:39.699\nhow we're all doing on our goal, what\nthe timeline is, how things are measured,\n\n257\n00:14:39.699 --> 00:14:41.954\nwhat we're moving towards towards success.\n\n258\n00:14:41.954 --> 00:14:46.288\nThat's why it's so important to have those\nbinary goals that are clear, unambiguous,\n\n259\n00:14:46.288 --> 00:14:48.911\nno guessing and\nthat everybody can look at everyday.\n\n260\n00:14:48.911 --> 00:14:52.062\nSo if they start to slip off track,\nthey start to get sub-optimal,\n\n261\n00:14:52.062 --> 00:14:55.156\nwe can look at that dashboard and\nsay here's where we got to fix it,\n\n262\n00:14:55.156 --> 00:14:58.528\nhere is where the bottleneck is,\nhere is where things are slowing down,\n\n263\n00:14:58.528 --> 00:15:01.990\nthis is what we need to focus on,\nhere is where the project needs to go now.\n\n264\n00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.810\nTo keep that level of\ncommunication in focus,\n\n265\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:11.690\nyou gotta have a lot of team meetings,\nspend time together, always looking to\n\n266\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.700\nthe level of competence and\ninvolvement and expertise on the team.\n\n267\n00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.250\nAnother thing that happens with poorly\noptimized teams is I take someone who\n\n268\n00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.830\ndoesn't have a lot of experience and put\nthem on top of a project they have never\n\n269\n00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.340\ndone before, when someone else on the team\nhas done that sort of project before,\n\n270\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.980\nthis is not a good use of talent and\nresources.\n\n271\n00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:37.220\nSo, backing up and constantly\nmonitoring how is the team doing?\n\n272\n00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.080\nOr do we have people\nmeasured up with competence?\n\n273\n00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.350\nAre things moving on target?\n\n274\n00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.420\nAnd how do we move people around\nthe team to get even better outputs,\n\n275\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.350\nbetter performance?\n\n276\n00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.325\nAnd the last but not least on this one is\nif you're gonna keep the team moving you\n\n277\n00:15:52.325 --> 00:15:56.240\ngotta constantly give them feedback,\ncoaching, training,\n\n278\n00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.600\ndevelopment so that they get better and\nbetter, more component, highly effective,\n\n279\n00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.420\nhighly efficient and doing high\noptimization on the team themselves by\n\n280\n00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.370\nunderstanding from each other and the team\nleader, specifically what needs to happen.\n\n281\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.130\nAnother level of that is making sure\nthat you're using the right tools.\n\n282\n00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.710\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was gonna ask.\n\n283\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.890\nThe training that's vital,\n\n284\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.480\nbut what are some other tools\nthat we can use optimize a team?\n\n285\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.630\n&gt;&gt; The most obvious one would be agile,\nor something like that.\n\n286\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:29.900\nYou could look at Six Sigma and ISO 9000,\nbenchmarking against other companies.\n\n287\n00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:35.970\nBut look at using the tools that\nare already there, value chain management,\n\n288\n00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.340\nprocess analysis, all those sort of\nthings to find the bottle necks,\n\n289\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.570\nto find the areas where the processes\naren't effective and efficient and\n\n290\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.870\nusing those tools to improve the process,\nstreamline it and\n\n291\n00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.790\nmake the team more efficient,\nmore highly optimized.\n\n292\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:54.731\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, we're getting kind of close\non time here, John, so any final thoughts?\n\n293\n00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:58.076\n&gt;&gt; We'll bring you back to it,\nall motivation is motive for action,\n\n294\n00:16:58.076 --> 00:16:59.190\nit's unique.\n\n295\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.390\nYou can't guess at it,\nyou need to sit down and\n\n296\n00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.010\nask the person what motivates them,\nwhat gets them excited.\n\n297\n00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.640\nWhy would they buy, and figure out\na way to tie in their personal values,\n\n298\n00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.270\ntheir personal definition of success,\nthe legacy they wanna leave\n\n299\n00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.800\nwith being excellent on the team,\nachieving goals, helping each other.\n\n300\n00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.020\nSo that every day they come to work is\nmaking them more successful in their\n\n301\n00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.950\npersonal life and when they go home and\n\n302\n00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.550\nthey're successful in their personal life,\nthey bring that back to the office.\n\n303\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:29.700\nAnd then the big thing on optimization\nis use the tools, constantly work on it,\n\n304\n00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.560\nhigh focus, and track so you understand\nif you're doing what you need to do or\n\n305\n00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.030\nif you need to change things around.\n\n306\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.370\n&gt;&gt; I love that idea on motivation too.\n\n307\n00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.730\nGo back the day you hire someone and\nask those questions and\n\n308\n00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.950\nthen when you remember that down the road,\nI think that's gonna make a big impression\n\n309\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.960\non them as well that you actually paid\nattention and listened to what they've\n\n310\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.630\nsaid and done something that's specific\nto them and that's really important.\n\n311\n00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.860\nBut looking at John, I think we're\nabout wrapped up on time here so\n\n312\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.190\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nclose this episode down but\n\n313\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.720\nwe got a lot more great content coming\nyour way and check out the past episodes\n\n314\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.940\nwe've done as well on this topic, but for\nnow, signing off, I'm Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n315\n00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.360\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n316\n00:18:03.360 -->

Peter Van Risedam.\n\n4\n00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.210\nAnd today we're continuing our series\ntalking about leading technology teams.\n\n5\n00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.460\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna talk about managing virtual teams.\n\n6\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.840\nWe've talked a lot about other team\nstructures and things like that before.\n\n7\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.690\nJust wanna be a little unique,\nI'm looking forward to it, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.860\nwe have John Spence to walk us through,\nhow are you doing John?\n\n9\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.840\n&gt;&gt; Great Peter, you?\n\n10\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.510\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.126\nSo we've talked a lot about\nhow to set up a team, and\n\n12\n00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:35.853\nhow to motivate a team,\nis that any different with a virtual team?\n\n13\n00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:38.580\n&gt;&gt; About 90% of it is exactly the same.\n\n14\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.590\nSo all the things we've covered before,\nlaunching the team,\n\n15\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.880\ncreating a team charter,\nteam values, binary goals,\n\n16\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.440\ncommunication, trust,\nall that is exactly the same.\n\n17\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.650\nJust the difficulty of it is magnified.\n\n18\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.700\nThere are many different things that\nare challenging about a virtual team, but\n\n19\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.310\nat the base you have to have\nthe same good solid team structure.\n\n20\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.890\nAll the same things we've been\ntalking about to get the team\n\n21\n00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.960\nthe base built right..\n\n22\n00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.060\nNow, there are some major\nadvantages to having virtual teams.\n\n23\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.700\nYou've got a larger global talent pool.\n\n24\n00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.200\nIt's not just people in the office I\ncan bring people in if it's a large\n\n25\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.820\ncorporation from other offices from\naround the world, or I can hire somebody\n\n26\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.720\nto come in as a virtual worker\nthat's not even part of the company.\n\n27\n00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.820\nThey're just part of my team.\n\n28\n00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.730\nSo huge access to much more talent.\n\n29\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.150\nA lot more flexibility for the workers.\n\n30\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.960\nThey can work out of their homes.\n\n31\n00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.800\nThey can work out of shared spaces.\n\n32\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.040\nDon't have to come in.\n\n33\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.770\nSo especially for millennials and\nyounger generations, but for\n\n34\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.580\na lot of us having that flexibility\nmakes a job much more attractive.\n\n35\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.870\nYou could also save money.\n\n36\n00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.750\nSometimes when you're hiring\npeople in other countries,\n\n37\n00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.710\nthey've got a lower pay scale and\n\n38\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.730\nyou can bring in really top talent for\na fraction of what you've normally spent.\n\n39\n00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.150\nAnother big thing for virtual teams\nis the network they've got created.\n\n40\n00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.630\nSo if I'm bringing someone in on my\nteam from the other side of the world,\n\n41\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.230\nthey've got a whole network of connections\nand friends and help there, and\n\n42\n00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.810\npeople they know, and expertise.\n\n43\n00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.110\nAnd all that from around the world\ngets pulled in onto that team or\n\n44\n00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.100\naround the organization.\n\n45\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.076\nThey might have contacts in Chicago and\nSan Francisco and\n\n46\n00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.940\nthe different cities they're in.\n\n47\n00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.819\nAnd then, last but not least,\n\n48\n00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.500\na major advantage to a global virtual\nteam is that it chases the sun.\n\n49\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.940\nI can work all night long.\n\n50\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.130\nWe've got things going on.\n\n51\n00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.120\nWe hand it off to India.\n\n52\n00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.090\nIndia hands it off to Australia, and\nthen it keeps moving around the world so\n\n53\n00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.400\nthat we're constantly putting\nout quality work as a team.\n\n54\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.340\n&gt;&gt; Great, so\nthose are some of the advantages now.\n\n55\n00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.280\nI imagine there's kind of\na unique set of challenges as\n\n56\n00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.900\nwell that you have with the virtual team?\n\n57\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.593\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd I put together slide for\n\n58\n00:02:45.593 --> 00:02:48.870\nthis cuz I wanted to make sure\nthat we cover this in detail.\n\n59\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.650\nSo let's look about some\nof the step that happened.\n\n60\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.300\nWhen you're not close, you're not\ncommunicating together all the time,\n\n61\n00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.660\nthere's a much much larger chance for\nmiscommunication and poor communication.\n\n62\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.990\nIt's one thing where you can hop up and\n\n63\n00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.210\nwalk down the hallway and\nask somebody something.\n\n64\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.540\nOr we sit down and have lunch together.\n\n65\n00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.022\nBut if I don't see you once a year and\nwe don't get to chat and\n\n66\n00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:14.351\ntalk and\nbump in each other in the hall ways.\n\n67\n00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:17.770\nIt really makes communication\na bigger challenge.\n\n68\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.130\nYou also have according to background or\n\n69\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.580\ntechnology Incompatible\ncommunication styles and processes.\n\n70\n00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.660\nSome people love to text.\n\n71\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.490\nSome people are fine on Skype.\n\n72\n00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.590\nSome folks love to get in a big meeting\nwith everybody else on Skype, some people\n\n73\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.770\ndon't wanna do it so you've really got\nto create some structure around that and\n\n74\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.730\nwhat we call a team communication charter\nabout how we're all gonna communicate,\n\n75\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.297\nthe technology, the tools we're gonna use,\nthe times, how it's gonna rotate.\n\n76\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.600\nYou also have to realize that\nwhen you've got a virtual team\n\n77\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.030\none of the big challenges to it is that\nyou've got different levels of work ethic,\n\n78\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.800\nsome people, I've had employees like\nthis for me when I ran virtual teams,\n\n79\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.910\nI had one young lady that was\na world champion surfer and\n\n80\n00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.050\nwhen the waves were good, she was surfing.\n\n81\n00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.920\nNothing got done.\n\n82\n00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.040\nShe was off, but\n\n83\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.260\nthen she would come home and she would\nwork until 3 o'clock in the morning.\n\n84\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.530\nAnd she got her stuff done,\n\n85\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.830\nit was just at a different time\nthat was convenient for her.\n\n86\n00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.950\nAnd then, I've had other employees,\n\n87\n00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.630\nthat once you allow them to go virtual,\ntheir work quality goes way down.\n\n88\n00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.290\nCuz they get distracted, they're doing\nother stuff, they're running errands, or\n\n89\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.960\nhanging out with their family.\n\n90\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.470\nAnd you start to see\nthe quality of their work drop.\n\n91\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.810\nAlso, when you've got virtual teams,\n\n92\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.920\nbecause you're not communicating real\nwell, you don't get that bond of trust.\n\n93\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.130\nAnd because you're, you'll have\na short time on let's say Skype or\n\n94\n00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.310\non the line together or doing a Google\nHangout, and I don't really have time to\n\n95\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.530\ndig into the questions, I'm not quite\nsure we covered everything, but\n\n96\n00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.440\nwe all gotta get off\nphone go do other stuff.\n\n97\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.030\nYou end up with a lot of second guessing,\nsilos, people that run off on their own\n\n98\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.760\ntangents and don't really trust what came\nup in the meeting cuz they weren't able\n\n99\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.210\nto go all the way through it and really\nget all the details out on the table.\n\n100\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.697\nMuch the difference than a regular\nteam that's together all the time,\n\n101\n00:05:12.697 --> 00:05:16.360\nthat's doing stuff, that's meeting,\nthat's going out after work.\n\n102\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.463\nWhen you don't get to meet to spent time\ntogether big challenges of virtual team is\n\n103\n00:05:20.463 --> 00:05:24.089\nthe different level of commitment,\nI don't get to see my team members,\n\n104\n00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.019\nI don't talk to them often,\nI don't know them that well.\n\n105\n00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:29.537\nI know very little\npersonal stuff about them,\n\n106\n00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:33.800\nhard to be more challenging to be\ncommitted and excited and giving a 100% to\n\n107\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.080\na team when you don't really feel\nlike I know other people on the team.\n\n108\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.050\nCan be very hard on virtual teams\nto decide who's gonna do what work.\n\n109\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.580\nAnd again, a big factor in this\nis the communication's difficult.\n\n110\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.280\nIt's on multiple sources.\n\n111\n00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.488\nWe don't do a lot of time face to face.\n\n112\n00:05:50.488 --> 00:05:54.858\nEven the best virtual teams maybe spend\nan hour, hour and a half a day actually\n\n113\n00:05:54.858 --> 00:05:58.590\ntalking to each other on Skype or\nusing technology like that.\n\n114\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.810\nAnd the rest of the time it's emails,\ntweets, chat tools and\n\n115\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.100\nthings like that, so\nit's hard to delegate and\n\n116\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.770\ncommunicate when there's that much\nfriction in the communication system.\n\n117\n00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.527\nLet me see, that brings me to the last\none, like we were just saying is,\n\n118\n00:06:15.527 --> 00:06:19.570\nwhen I don't get to spend time around\nmy team, it's hard to really like them,\n\n119\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.490\nto get to know them, to have empathy for\nthem because it's just some person I\n\n120\n00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.966\ntalked to on a Skype thing or\non the phone once a week, once a month.\n\n121\n00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:29.842\nI don't know anything about their\nbackground, their family, their kids,\n\n122\n00:06:29.842 --> 00:06:31.780\ntheir hobbies, their sports.\n\n123\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.870\nI don't have lot of empathy for them.\n\n124\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.760\nDid you get your work in or\ndid you not get your work in?\n\n125\n00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.870\nPeter in Bangladesh.\n\n126\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.050\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n127\n00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.580\nOr Sam in San Francisco, Mary in Miami.\n\n128\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.880\nI don't really care about you as a person.\n\n129\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.050\nI just care did you get your work in for\nme so I could finish my work?\n\n130\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.670\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\nWell,\n\n131\n00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.080\nI think the first step to being successful\nthen is Identifying the problems.\n\n132\n00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.170\nAnd now we've identified them.\n\n133\n00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.940\nBut what are some of the other\nkeys to success here?\n\n134\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, a lot of keys to success\nin virtual teams are really hard\n\n135\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.120\nbecause you've got all\nthese other challenges.\n\n136\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.840\nHere's the biggest key to\nsuccess is get people together.\n\n137\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.420\nGet them together a couple times a years\nso all those challenges I was talking\n\n138\n00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.810\nabout, not knowing each other, not\nempathy, not fully committed, poor work\n\n139\n00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.210\nprocesses, a lot of that is simply\nbecause there's no personal connection.\n\n140\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.990\nAnd unfortunately many\norganizations don't have the funds\n\n141\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.200\nto fly people enter three time a year.\n\n142\n00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.680\nI work with several virtual\nteams from large corporations\n\n143\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.110\nthat get one day together a year.\n\n144\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.415\nAnd then, they wonder why there is\nfriction and there is distrust.\n\n145\n00:07:31.415 --> 00:07:34.050\nThey're not putting out that quality\nof product, they don't know each other,\n\n146\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.250\nthey don't have any personal connection so\nyou gotta get them face to face.\n\n147\n00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.890\nAnother key to success is to\nnot just clarify direction and\n\n148\n00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:49.520\ngoals and roles but actually tasks and\ntimelines and things.\n\n149\n00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.900\nSo we can get down to what is\nthe process we're gonna use to do this.\n\n150\n00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.340\nWe're all gonna follow the process.\n\n151\n00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.360\nThis is the task we're gonna do.\n\n152\n00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.522\nSo we're gonna go all the way like our\nstrategies from vision and values and\n\n153\n00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:03.640\ndirection and\nget it down now to here's the processes.\n\n154\n00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.440\nHere's the systems.\n\n155\n00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.400\nHere's the operations.\n\n156\n00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.860\nHere's the tools we're gonna use.\n\n157\n00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.070\nHere's the task that\nyou're responsible for.\n\n158\n00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:13.070\nAnd have super clarity on that cuz if\nI'm not gonna check in with you but\n\n159\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.920\nonce a week or once a month and\nhave that team meeting,\n\n160\n00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.570\nI need to really understand what\nspecifically am I responsible for.\n\n161\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.470\nWhat task must I implement and finish, and\n\n162\n00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.020\nwhat's my responsibility for the rest\nof the team with no ambiguity there.\n\n163\n00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.270\nAnd then,\nthe last thing the key to success is to\n\n164\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.820\nuse the best technology\nyou can possibly use.\n\n165\n00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.990\nTrack apps, Skype,\nGoogle Handouts, shared screens,\n\n166\n00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:45.210\nshared worksheets, things like,\nmy company uses Basecamp.\n\n167\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.620\nBut something that, we've got lots of\ncommunication, lots of information.\n\n168\n00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.410\nSo if I'm sitting some place and\nI run a virtual company now, if I'm in,\n\n169\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.830\ntravelling around the world some place,\nI need to know that I,\n\n170\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.280\nat 3 o'clock in the morning in Tokyo,\nI can look on to my stuff, and\n\n171\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.580\nI've got all the notes,\nall the communications, all the due dates.\n\n172\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.660\nEverything needs to be done.\n\n173\n00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.780\nThe processes,\nthe background information, the data,\n\n174\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:13.120\nour files, everything is there so\nI can do my work whenever I need to do it.\n\n175\n00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.940\nWhat's the same thing\non your virtual team?\n\n176\n00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.670\nYour team has to be able to hit the ground\nrunning at any hour of the day,\n\n177\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.830\nanywhere in the world.\n\n178\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.040\nWith all the information they have,\nusing the best technologies\n\n179\n00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.562\nto keep as connected and\ncommitted as you can possibly get them.\n\n180\n00:09:26.562 --> 00:09:30.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, John, we've talked in a lot\nof the other episodes in this series about\n\n181\n00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.510\nmeetings and how to run meetings\neffectively within a team.\n\n182\n00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.600\nI'm sure a lot of those\nsame things apply here.\n\n183\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.930\nBut any unique things to\nrunning a virtual team meeting?\n\n184\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a couple of standard issues here.\n\n185\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.490\nNumber one,\nyou've got to put it on the agenda.\n\n186\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.790\nYou've gotta put it on the schedule.\n\n187\n00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.920\nWe can have as we often have\nan office just a quick meeting.\n\n188\n00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.110\nHey, guys, we need to get together.\n\n189\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.390\nCan we all run down to\nthe conference room for 15 minutes?\n\n190\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.330\nThat doesn't happen on a virtual team.\n\n191\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.660\nPeople are off doing their own things.\n\n192\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.500\nThey're in different time zones.\n\n193\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.640\nThey're on their flex time.\n\n194\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.630\nYou can't just make a phone call,\nsay everybody get together in 15 minutes.\n\n195\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.600\nYou've got to plan time,\nput it on the calendar, and\n\n196\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.290\njust like any other meeting\nyou need an agenda.\n\n197\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.300\nWhenever possible in all your\nmeetings you want to do them video.\n\n198\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.570\nWe talked about it earlier\nin the communications thing.\n\n199\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:23.520\nOnly about 7% of communications is verbal,\n93% is non-verbal.\n\n200\n00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.190\nIf you try to have a virtual team meeting\nwithout being able to see each other's\n\n201\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.230\nfaces, without being able to make\neye contact through the computer or\n\n202\n00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.810\nsee when someone is nodding and smiling,\nor working on their cell phone or\n\n203\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.330\nwhatever it might be.\n\n204\n00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.650\nIt really diminishes the effect,\nthe success of the meaning,\n\n205\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.622\nif I can't see each other.\n\n206\n00:10:41.622 --> 00:10:44.660\nAnd then, again, use those tools so we can\nall work together during the meeting on\n\n207\n00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.790\nthe same documents, the same sort of\nstuff, looking at the same thing.\n\n208\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.670\nSo you don't have somebody left out.\n\n209\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.830\nSo a lot of the same stuff, but\n\n210\n00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:55.480\nyou also wanna make sure that you got\ntechnology going and you're meeting often.\n\n211\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.270\nNow, let me give some outlines for\n\n212\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.100\nonce you're in that meeting,\nhow to run it well.\n\n213\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.181\nAnd this is something I've taught for\n\n214\n00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:06.051\nyears because it's critical\nto running a meeting.\n\n215\n00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:09.840\nSo we're gonna get ready for\nthe meeting, here's what you gonna do.\n\n216\n00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.190\nClear your desk of everything,\nget everything out of your way,\n\n217\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.890\nanything that's distracting.\n\n218\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.610\nShut off all the electronics except for\nyour computer.\n\n219\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.250\nHave a copy of the agenda out so\nyou can follow it.\n\n220\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.900\nHave a pad and a pen out.\n\n221\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.300\nWhat are some other things right here?\n\n222\n00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.380\nHave a list of questions\nthat you wanna ask.\n\n223\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:30.171\nI only have a limited amount of time so\nI don't wanna go, I forgot to ask that cuz\n\n224\n00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:33.602\nI want everybody's input, so\ncreate a list of questions.\n\n225\n00:11:33.602 --> 00:11:37.616\n&gt;&gt; And it might make sense, you mentioned,\njust have your computer, also,\n\n226\n00:11:37.616 --> 00:11:39.410\njust have the programs you need.\n\n227\n00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.330\nHave the meeting software up,\nhave the agenda up maybe in a WordDoc, and\n\n228\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.415\nsomething to take your notes.\n\n229\n00:11:44.415 --> 00:11:46.425\nIt's in whatever relevant\nthings you need but\n\n230\n00:11:46.425 --> 00:11:49.615\nif you've got Facebook over in the back,\nif you've got your email opened up,\n\n231\n00:11:49.615 --> 00:11:51.595\nthose things pop up it's\nreally easy to get distracted.\n\n232\n00:11:51.595 --> 00:11:53.629\n&gt;&gt; Who in the world would've faced for\ntheir email?\n\n233\n00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:56.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry I just got another\n\n234\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.075\nnotification here.\n\n235\n00:11:57.075 --> 00:11:58.145\nGo on, go on.\n\n236\n00:11:58.145 --> 00:12:01.675\n&gt;&gt; One of the other things that I like\nthat I use a lot coz I do overtunings with\n\n237\n00:12:01.675 --> 00:12:05.010\nmy clients from all over the world is,\nI used to think I'll drag a naturally\n\n238\n00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.480\nspeaking not plugging any promo it\ncould be anyone you want, Microsoft,\n\n239\n00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.270\nApple all come with these.\n\n240\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.550\nThe second I get off a meeting, I stop\nbefore I turn anything back on or check my\n\n241\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:19.780\nFacebook or send a Tweet, I dictate\nback all of my notes from the meeting.\n\n242\n00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.300\nEverything we discussed, what I thought\nit meant, what the action steps are,\n\n243\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.860\nwhat I'm supposed to do,\nwhat my responsibility is.\n\n244\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.970\nHow I understood everything?\n\n245\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.710\nWhat's going on for the next meeting?\n\n246\n00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.100\nI dictate it all, and then you send an\nemail out to everybody else on the team.\n\n247\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.400\nHere's what I heard, this is what I\nlearned, this is what I plan to do.\n\n248\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.020\nAnd if everybody on the team does that,\nyou're gonna find out where\n\n249\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.440\nthe miscommunication are,\nwhere the disconnects are,\n\n250\n00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.060\nwhere there was misunderstanding or\noverlaps of information.\n\n251\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.310\nIt takes about two minutes and\nthe neat thing about that, too,\n\n252\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.610\nis you can go back years.\n\n253\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.860\nI have these files 10, 15 years back where\nwe had a discussion with a key client or\n\n254\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.860\nI had a team meeting with my team and\nwe made some very big decisions,\n\n255\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.740\nvery important stuff around strategy.\n\n256\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.522\nAnd I could look five years out or\nten years back and\n\n257\n00:13:02.522 --> 00:13:06.710\nsay, here's everything we had,\nit's all in Basecamp, I can get there.\n\n258\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.218\nAnother thing you wanna do is,\n\n259\n00:13:08.218 --> 00:13:12.160\nyou wanna make sure that everybody gets\ninvolved during the virtual meeting.\n\n260\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.510\nLike, we talked about earlier with\nperception checking and things like that.\n\n261\n00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.140\nThat means that one you're on the call,\nyou're saying things like,\n\n262\n00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.550\nhey, I haven't heard anything from you,\nTim, why don't you take a minute or\n\n263\n00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.510\ntwo and share with us your thoughts\non what we're discussing right now?\n\n264\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.670\nOr after you do it, hey,\nhow does that sound to you, Rob?\n\n265\n00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.680\nDo you agree with what Jinja said?\n\n266\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.890\nAnd using yourself to prompt\nto keep everybody involved.\n\n267\n00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.900\nWatching the other people on screens\nto see that they are not distracted.\n\n268\n00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.780\nKeeping a list there and making sure that\nevery single person that is on the call,\n\n269\n00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.420\nin the meeting, participates, so\n\n270\n00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.860\nif someone's sitting\nback not saying anything.\n\n271\n00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.340\nThen just turn to them and say,\nhey, in a minute here, Greg,\n\n272\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.460\nI'm gonna hand this over to you, and\nI'd like you to take about two minutes\n\n273\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.200\nsort of summarize what you've\nheard in the meeting so far, and\n\n274\n00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.410\ngive us your thoughts and ideas on what\nyou think the next step should be.\n\n275\n00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.910\nYou're not trying to get a gotcha there,\n\n276\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.460\nyou're trying to let people\nknow you better pay attention.\n\n277\n00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.350\nCuz I might call on you and you're not\ngonna be able to come to these meetings,\n\n278\n00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.940\nthese virtual meetings,\nand not participate.\n\n279\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.280\nYou're gonna have to get\neverybody participating.\n\n280\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.957\nAnd then, always,\njust like a regular meeting, but\n\n281\n00:14:15.957 --> 00:14:19.645\nthis is one of reasons I did the\nfollow-up, never get off the call without\n\n282\n00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:24.030\nclearly taking time to summarize what we\nall heard to talk about what we agreed on.\n\n283\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.350\nAbout who's gonna do it,\nand when it's due, and\n\n284\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.380\nwhat specifically the next\naction steps are.\n\n285\n00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.480\nAgain, we can't just pull each\nother back together go hey,\n\n286\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.370\nwe didn't cover this can we get back\ntogether this afternoon after lunch, and\n\n287\n00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.690\njust ten minutes re-clarify that?\n\n288\n00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.820\nYou wanna make sure you get this\nall done while you're on the call,\n\n289\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.610\ncuz you might not have another call for\na day, a week, a month.\n\n290\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.850\nAnd you can't afford to be second guessing\nyourself for other people on a team or\n\n291\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.760\nhaving miscommunications and\nnot being effective as a team.\n\n292\n00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.889\n&gt;&gt; And I assumed, John,\nthat summarization,\n\n293\n00:14:52.889 --> 00:14:55.471\nthat's the responsibility\nof the leader of the team.\n\n294\n00:14:55.471 --> 00:14:59.711\nWhat are some of the other unique things\nfor a team leader not just in a meetings,\n\n295\n00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:02.760\nbut just managing\na virtual team as a whole?\n\n296\n00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n297\n00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.760\nWhen I get to see you around the office,\n\n298\n00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.960\nwhen we get to connect,\nthat can happen by chance.\n\n299\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.680\nLeading a virtual team you\nhave to be very intentional.\n\n300\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.573\nYou need to spend more time with\npeople individually with one on ones.\n\n301\n00:15:16.573 --> 00:15:21.064\nMore time asking about what's motivating\nthem, what's discouraging them,\n\n302\n00:15:21.064 --> 00:15:25.250\nwhat their roadblocks are coaching,\ngiving more feedback.\n\n303\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.360\nReally making an extra effort\nto get that personal connection.\n\n304\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.890\nYou also need to make sure that\nthey know you're full available.\n\n305\n00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.950\nThat, no matter what time it is in the\nworld, within reason, [LAUGH] that you're\n\n306\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.830\nthere for them, you're there to help them,\nthat you're there to support them.\n\n307\n00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.500\nBecause people can feel very\nlonely on a virtual team.\n\n308\n00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.300\nAnd they can feel like their\nleader doesn't understand them,\n\n309\n00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.530\ndoesn't care about them,\nthey're not connected.\n\n310\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.980\nSo you've got to put out the extra\neffort to say, I'm here for you,\n\n311\n00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.360\nI'm on your team.\n\n312\n00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.300\nAnytime day or night, if you've got\na big problem, issue or challenge or\n\n313\n00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.320\nsomething just small you want to discuss\ndo not hesitate to give me a call,\n\n314\n00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.399\nsend me a text,\nwe'll set up a meeting one on one.\n\n315\n00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.528\nAnd again, the leader has to play it\nextra role in communicating the vision,\n\n316\n00:16:04.528 --> 00:16:08.705\nthe mission, the values, the direction,\nconstantly checking in on those binary\n\n317\n00:16:08.705 --> 00:16:12.344\ngoals, using the dashboards and\nthe technology to help people track and\n\n318\n00:16:12.344 --> 00:16:16.340\nthen reaching out immediately\nwhen something gets off track.\n\n319\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.060\nOften times, again,\nif there's something happening in your\n\n320\n00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.290\noffice we're all together as a team,\nI just watch you for a few days.\n\n321\n00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.830\nI look at when you're coming in,\nwhen you're going,\n\n322\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.040\nwhat you're working on,\nhow you're interacting with other people.\n\n323\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.540\nI get a feel for how I think you're doing.\n\n324\n00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.880\nI can't do that if you're on\nthe other side of the world.\n\n325\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.810\nSo if I have any question at all,\nany concern that you might be slipping,\n\n326\n00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.920\nyou're not fully committed,\nthings are going well,\n\n327\n00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.770\nimmediately I need to get in there and\nstart having a discussion.\n\n328\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.410\nTo get you back on the team\nplaying well with others,\n\n329\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.020\nmake sure you're delivering what you want.\n\n330\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.740\nIt takes the things we've talking\nabout Peter, around communications,\n\n331\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.360\naround coaching, and\nelevates it to a much higher level, and\n\n332\n00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.106\nthe big word here is productivity.\n\n333\n00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:56.750\nA leader's gotta be constantly reaching\nout and staying involved with their people\n\n334\n00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.840\nand making an extra effort\nto connect with them.\n\n335\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.130\n&gt;&gt; Great, it makes sense,\nyou need challenges,\n\n336\n00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:06.895\na lot of unique benefits as well\nto having that remote team,\n\n337\n00:17:06.895 --> 00:17:09.640\nbut some different things you\nwanna definitely think about.\n\n338\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.864\nSo any final thoughts\nbefore we close this one?\n\n339\n00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:15.323\n&gt;&gt; You gotta do everything you everything\nwe've covered in the other sessions.\n\n340\n00:17:15.323 --> 00:17:20.090\nT hat's why this one is a little shorter,\nbecause 90% of this is still a team.\n\n341\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.070\nBut with the virtual team or remote team,\n\n342\n00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:28.830\nit's all around communications, it's all\naround connection, and it's all around\n\n343\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.210\ntrying to make them feel like a team\neven though they're on a distance.\n\n344\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.370\nAnd that brings a whole\nanother level of transit.\n\n345\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.060\nYou said, lots of great things.\n\n346\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.160\nI've got global talent.\n\n347\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.740\nI've got chase the sun.\n\n348\n00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.370\nI've got a bigger network.\n\n349\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.120\nBut if you don't bill\nthem as a good team and\n\n350\n00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.320\ncommunicate well,\nthat's the odd stone of value, so\n\n351\n00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.040\nyou gotta get the basic stride of 100% and\nthen add in those extra things.\n\n352\n00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.970\n&gt;&gt; Definitely take the good with the bad\nfor sure, well, I think that's a great for\n\n353\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.390\nus to leave off a lot of great\ninformation there go out and\n\n354\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.300\ncheck out our other episodes for.\n\n355\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.180\nEven more information not just about\nvirtual teams but managing technology\n\n356\n00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.180\nteams from start to finish, so\ngreat stuff there, thanks, John.\n\n357\n00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:02.977\n&gt;&gt; My pleasure.\n\n358\n00:18:02.977 --> 00:18:05.600\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go ahead and\nsign off though for this episode.\n\n359\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.883\nI'm your host, Peter Van Risedam.\n\n360\n00:18:06.883 --> 00:18:07.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n361\n00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.384\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n362\n00:18:10.384 -->
