Doing fantastic, Peter, and you?\n\n10\n00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.420\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.040\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n12\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.410\n&gt;&gt; John tell us a little bit\nabout yourself to get us started.\n\n13\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.290\n&gt;&gt; More than 20 years as a leadership and\nstrategy, and business trainer,\n\n14\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.460\nand consultant.\n\n15\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.940\nI've written five books, and\nthis is what I've built my career around,\n\n16\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.960\nis trying to help people\nimprove in business.\n\n17\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.600\nFantastic, all right, so we're talking\nabout launching successful teams.\n\n18\n00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.740\nThere are so many places to start,\nwhere do we start on this?\n\n19\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.060\n&gt;&gt; Well, I like to start with what's a\npretty famous model done by Bruce Tuckman\n\n20\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.945\nabout the five stages of teams.\n\n21\n00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:56.555\nAnd that's forming, storming,\nnorming, performing, and\n\n22\n00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.910\nthen I like to say adjoining,\nbut it should be adjourning.\n\n23\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.461\n[LAUGH] Or transforming,\nyou gotta make them all rhyme.\n\n24\n00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:03.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gotta work, it's a song.\n\n25\n00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:04.625\n&gt;&gt; It still would have them all.\n\n26\n00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.615\nSo this first one's gonna\nbe around the forming.\n\n27\n00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:10.655\nAnd this is launching the team,\ngetting the team together,\n\n28\n00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:15.280\nestablishing the team and making sure\nthat we start on the right foot.\n\n29\n00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.730\nAnd the first question you want to ask\nyourself is do we even need a team?\n\n30\n00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.420\nSo the key idea there is,\nwould a workgroup do fine?\n\n31\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.320\nCould we do individual people?\n\n32\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.360\nAnd the way you handle that is you go to\nthe sponsor, who is asking for the team?\n\n33\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.230\nYou sit down and clarify, what are the\ntasks we want, what's the outcome we want,\n\n34\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.930\nwhat's the purpose of the team?\n\n35\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.860\nWhat are you trying to achieve here?\n\n36\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.240\nAnd deciding where the sponsor,\nif building a high performance team\n\n37\n00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.910\nis actually what is necessary\nto accomplish the task.\n\n38\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.110\n&gt;&gt; John, what is the difference between,\nyou mentioned a work group and a team,\n\n39\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.460\nwhat's the difference there?\n\n40\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.950\n&gt;&gt; A work group would be a group of\nindividuals that basically are doing\n\n41\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.150\ntheir projects and their tasks.\n\n42\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.320\nHanding them off to each other to\nfinish a project independently.\n\n43\n00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.120\nThere's really sort of\nthree levels of teams.\n\n44\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.900\nThere's independent teams,\ninterdependent teams, and dependent teams.\n\n45\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.350\nOn an independent team, and\nI like to use sports analogies for\n\n46\n00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.670\nthis, sort of like a golf team.\n\n47\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.970\nAnd this would be a almost close\nto a workgroup where you've got\n\n48\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.570\neach person individually\ndoing their stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.980\nOn a golf team it's me versus the course.\n\n50\n00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.890\nNo one else can prep for me.\n\n51\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.010\nNo one else can drive for me.\n\n52\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.050\nThey can give me advice, but\nI'm the only one responsible for\n\n53\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.860\nmy own score on the golf course.\n\n54\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.370\nOur team can win, and\nwe've got a team product, but\n\n55\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.690\nI can also individually do very well.\n\n56\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.130\nThen you have whats called\nan interdependent team.\n\n57\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.190\nWhere we've got folks that\nare handling things off, and\n\n58\n00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.740\nam doing some work on my own, and\nsome of it actually as a team.\n\n59\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.600\nThis is more of a hybrid\nfrom a work group coming up.\n\n60\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.590\nA good analogy for that,\nwould be a baseball team.\n\n61\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.980\nWhen am, I get to play banding\nno body else can help me.\n\n62\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.820\nThey can't hit the ball for\nme,they can't watch the pitch for me.\n\n63\n00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.370\nAgain, the coach can give me advice, but\n\n64\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.720\nam completely on my own independent\nof that part of the teamwork.\n\n65\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.100\nThen you've got when you're out in\nthe field, you're part of the entire team.\n\n66\n00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.520\nYou're interdependent.\n\n67\n00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.530\nIf somebody hits a pot fly and\nit flies by and I watch it and lands it.\n\n68\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.310\nI don't pick it up and throw it back in,\nthe team's probably not gonna win.\n\n69\n00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.620\nSo that's a different type of team,\nan interdependent team.\n\n70\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.450\nAnd finally, and this is really where\nyou go to high performance teams and\n\n71\n00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.590\nthe normal definition of a team which\nis sort of like a football team or\n\n72\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.590\na basketball team where\nit's fully dependent.\n\n73\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.520\nThat if one of the linemen doesn't block,\nthe quarterback gets sacked.\n\n74\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.040\nIf one of the people decides they\ndon't wanna pass the basketball,\n\n75\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.260\nhard to win the game.\n\n76\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.235\nMy favorite example for\nthis is like an Olympic four by four team.\n\n77\n00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.135\nIf one of the folks decides\nthey're not going to run,\n\n78\n00:03:36.135 --> 00:03:37.830\nyou're not getting a gold metal.\n\n79\n00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.068\nSo step one is clearly understanding,\nwhat kind of a team do we need.\n\n80\n00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:43.720\nWould a workgroup be fine?\n\n81\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.210\nDo we even need to put a team together?\n\n82\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.680\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good all right, and\nI got you off task a little bit.\n\n83\n00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.597\nSo let's go back to, what was the first\nstep in the Bruce Tuckman model?\n\n84\n00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:52.140\nIt's forming.\n\n85\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.280\n&gt;&gt; It's forming.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n86\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.680\n&gt;&gt; So at this stage we're just\nputting the team together.\n\n87\n00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.530\nAnother thing to look at is\nhow will the team operate?\n\n88\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.080\nIs it gonna be a departmental team?\n\n89\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.280\nIs it by function?\n\n90\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.190\nIs it cross functional?\n\n91\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.960\nIs it, maybe, interdepartmental or\nintercorporate?\n\n92\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.030\nMaybe, it's different parts of\nthe company or different companies or\n\n93\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.350\nworking with vendors.\n\n94\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.470\nSo, once you establish,\n\n95\n00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.100\nall right we do need to build a team,\nis it gonna be inside one division?\n\n96\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.349\nIs it gonna be across divisions or\nacross companies?\n\n97\n00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay and so after we're done\nforming the team, you said storming.\n\n98\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.810\nI'm assuming brainstorming?\n\n99\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.420\n&gt;&gt; No, storming is when we come together\nand we're gonna be covering a little bit\n\n100\n00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.930\nlater in this, is we come together and\nwe start working together and\n\n101\n00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.690\nthe stormy part is when people\nare starting to have some friction.\n\n102\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.640\nThey don't know each other well,\nthey haven't built up a level of trust.\n\n103\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.420\nSo it's the team sorta fighting through,\nand\n\n104\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.280\nstorming through,\ncreating a more cohesive group.\n\n105\n00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.560\nWhich, the next level is then\nthey start performing well, and\n\n106\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.910\ngetting better and better at what they do.\n\n107\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay and so I'm not gonna try to\nguess now on what norming means,\n\n108\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.910\nbut, help us out here.\n\n109\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, the norming is really the stage\nwhere that now we've created a charter,\n\n110\n00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.680\nwe've got everybody working together\nin groups, we know each other well.\n\n111\n00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.070\nAnd that is the foundation of being\nable to perform well together as a team,\n\n112\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.580\nis having the norms across the entire\ngroups, shared meaning, shared values,\n\n113\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.740\na shared purpose that gets\neveryone on the team aligned and\n\n114\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.360\nable to deliver what's necessary.\n\n115\n00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.499\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nthen finally you said, adjourning,\n\n116\n00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:20.650\nadjourning gotta make it rhyme.\n\n117\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.462\nSo what do we mean there?\n\n118\n00:05:21.462 --> 00:05:24.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, adjourning or actually\nanother word for it is transforming.\n\n119\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.360\nThere's two ways here.\n\n120\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.145\nThe team could transform,\ntransforming, it does rhyme.\n\n121\n00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:31.640\n[LAUGH] The team could transform\nto another team project and\n\n122\n00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.980\nkeep the team together.\n\n123\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.920\nBut often times what happens is\na team is broken up, it's adjourned.\n\n124\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.740\nThey disperse and then they are put on\nseparate teams or put on new teams.\n\n125\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, it sounds like at the\nbeginning when we're forming that team and\n\n126\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.050\nfiguring out what kind of team we're gonna\nbuild and what that charter is and what\n\n127\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.960\nthe norms are, we need to understand why\nthe team was created on the first place.\n\n128\n00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.650\nSo, that's going back to whoever said to,\nto build the team and\n\n129\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.750\nfiguring that out or?\n\n130\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, at this stage which\none of you take some time to really\n\n131\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.110\nwork with the sponsor, to really clarify\nwhat's the purpose of this team.\n\n132\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.610\nWhat's the outcome we want?\n\n133\n00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.630\nHow will it be measured?\n\n134\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.460\nIn other way I like to say is\nwhat does success look like?\n\n135\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.810\nIf this team operates perfectly and\ndelivers exactly what you want,\n\n136\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.490\nhow do we measure that, how will we\nknow that we've been successful?\n\n137\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Basically the same as any other\n\n138\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.790\nbusiness practice your gonna have where\nyou want to have measurable goals and\n\n139\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.280\nbe able to look back and\nsay did we hit these or not.\n\n140\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.200\nNot just kinda,\nyeah I think it kinda went well.\n\n141\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and part of that is\nis once you've got that and\n\n142\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.640\nyou're gonna be the team leader or\nyou're putting the team together,\n\n143\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.840\nis making sure you have the resources,\nthe access to people, the authority.\n\n144\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.810\nSo that once you've figured out\nwhat the purpose is where we going,\n\n145\n00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.030\nwhat are trying to achieve, making\nsure you have everything necessary for\n\n146\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.700\nyou to be successful, leading that team\nand taking them to the next level.\n\n147\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.600\n&gt;&gt; Great, I know we're in kind of\na position now where in a lot of companies\n\n148\n00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.220\nwhere people are spread out either in\ndifferent rooms in the same building, or\n\n149\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.960\neven different buildings, or\nyou've got people working from home.\n\n150\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.410\nWhat kind of challenges does that create\nwhen putting a team together that\n\n151\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.200\nmight not be all in\nthe same actual geography?\n\n152\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the biggest challenges,\nespecially to do now with virtual teams is\n\n153\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.920\ncreating a level of trust that's necessary\nto create a true high performance team.\n\n154\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.990\nYou can have teams that\nare located together,\n\n155\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.330\ncolocated at different buildings or\ndifferent groups, or completely virtual.\n\n156\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.610\nAnd what you wanna try to do is create,\nagain that's why that norming is so\n\n157\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.580\nimportant, creating shared values,\na shared system, clear goals,\n\n158\n00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.180\na clear purpose so\nthat everyone is in line working together.\n\n159\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.660\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthis in later sections, but\n\n160\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.550\nit's absolutely essential to create\nsome level of bond of trust.\n\n161\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.264\nSo that, even though we're in different\nlocations, we may not see each other that\n\n162\n00:07:49.264 --> 00:07:52.235\noften, we're still operating as\na group that trusts each other,\n\n163\n00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:53.421\nthat speaks with candor.\n\n164\n00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.366\nThat has lots of open communication,\n\n165\n00:07:55.366 --> 00:07:59.685\nthat has high levels of accountability\nto allow us to be successful as a team.\n\n166\n00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:03.145\n&gt;&gt; And that kinda comes back to\nthe norming a little bit to say Here's how\n\n167\n00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:04.409\nthis team is gonna work.\n\n168\n00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:06.383\nIt's unique for\neach kind of team you're building.\n\n169\n00:08:06.383 --> 00:08:08.431\nBut here's what we expect of you, and\n\n170\n00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:11.253\nhere's how we are holding\neach other accountable.\n\n171\n00:08:11.253 --> 00:08:12.332\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n172\n00:08:12.332 --> 00:08:15.542\nAnd it's those shared values,\nthat foundation,\n\n173\n00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:18.081\nthat keeps everybody on the same page and\n\n174\n00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:22.798\nallows you to hold people accountable\nwhen they violate one of this norms.\n\n175\n00:08:22.798 --> 00:08:26.030\nIf they violet the value of showing up\non time, turning their work in on time.\n\n176\n00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.833\nNot getting aggressive with\none of the other team members.\n\n177\n00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:34.209\nAnd we'll go into a lot more depth\non that, of figuring out as a team,\n\n178\n00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:35.850\nhow do we wanna treat each other.\n\n179\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.976\nBut before even that, we gotta back up and\ntalk about who do we want on the team?\n\n180\n00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:44.867\nAnd one of the exercises I use a lot with\nthe classes I teach is, let's create\n\n181\n00:08:44.867 --> 00:08:49.740\na model for this organization,\nthis group of an ideal team member.\n\n182\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.240\nSo for a second,\nI wanna ask you a question.\n\n183\n00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Is when you think about someone you'd\n\n184\n00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.330\nlove to bring on your team.\n\n185\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.730\nSomeone that's really, really good.\n\n186\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.050\nSomeone that's what I would\ncall an ideal team member.\n\n187\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.560\nWhat are four or\n\n188\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.040\nfive of the characteristics you'd look for\nin a perfect team member?\n\n189\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.860\n&gt;&gt; Well I think communication\nis certainly a big one.\n\n190\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.670\nWhen you're working with a team, it's very\ndifferent than working just by yourself.\n\n191\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.770\nYou've gotta be able to\ntalk with one another.\n\n192\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.680\nIt's kind of,\nI'm not sure the right way to say it.\n\n193\n00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.630\nBut without kind of sounding silly here.\n\n194\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.800\nBut being a team player,\nactually sharing ideas and\n\n195\n00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.620\nnot saying,\nI wanna take all the credit for this.\n\n196\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.000\nAnd I wanna actually work on the success\nof the team as opposed to just myself.\n\n197\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.340\nThose would be a couple good ones.\n\n198\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.583\nJust beyond that I think, trust,\nto trust that someone else is\n\n199\n00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:43.928\ngoing to do their part and so\nI don't have to worry about them.\n\n200\n00:09:43.928 --> 00:09:44.748\n&gt;&gt; Cool, well those are all good.\n\n201\n00:09:44.748 --> 00:09:48.841\nAnd this is a question I've asked hundreds\nof companies, lots of people, and\n\n202\n00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:52.066\nI actually was working with\na large organization last week and\n\n203\n00:09:52.066 --> 00:09:53.630\nwent through this with them.\n\n204\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.070\nSo I brought the actual list they created.\n\n205\n00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.550\nAnd we talked about two things.\n\n206\n00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.230\nI figured there's an interesting idea\nhere, and you said it sort of around,\n\n207\n00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.620\nbe a good team player.\n\n208\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.540\nWe also added in, what does it take to\nbe a great follower or team player?\n\n209\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.770\nNot just a team member but\nalso a great follower of the team leader.\n\n210\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.320\nSo it's a long list and I'm gonna go\nthrough and hit a couple of ideas.\n\n211\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.670\nNumber one, absolutely most important.\n\n212\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.460\nAnd this shows up in research studies\non leadership teamwork, everything,\n\n213\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.560\nis honesty, integrity,\ntell the truth all the time, period.\n\n214\n00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.910\nIf you're not honest there's no way\nanyone else on the team will trust you.\n\n215\n00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.040\nIf they don't trust you,\nyou're not a team member.\n\n216\n00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.520\nHigh energy, positive attitude,\npassion, enthusiasm, commitment,\n\n217\n00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.830\nbeing excited about being on the team.\n\n218\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.840\nAnother key one, critical,\nhighly competent.\n\n219\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.490\nYou gotta be exceedingly\ngood at what you do,\n\n220\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.230\nthere's sort of a combination\nhere of competence and concern.\n\n221\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.820\nWhen you're on the team, to build trust,\n\n222\n00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.570\npeople wanna see that you're extremely\ngood at what you do, highly competent, and\n\n223\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.130\nyou care about the team,\nyou're committed at the team.\n\n224\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.690\nHigh competence, high concern, and\nthe phrase I use there always is,\n\n225\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.540\nI'm good at what I do, and\nI do it because I care about you.\n\n226\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.380\nAnother one you almost said,\nis loyal and dependable.\n\n227\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.750\nI want someone who I can trust\non the team, who's reliable, and\n\n228\n00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.540\nwill get their work done.\n\n229\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.040\nAnother big element, absolutely,\n\n230\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.500\nand it's one of the modules we'll cover\nhere, is being a fantastic communicator.\n\n231\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.960\nAnd mostly that's about being curious,\nasking great questions, being an intense\n\n232\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.900\nlistener, and understanding when\nto offer ideas and information.\n\n233\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.670\nA couple of other ideas,\njust wanna read them here.\n\n234\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.090\nFlexible, they have an ownership\nmentality, high level of engagement.\n\n235\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.850\nThey know their role on the team,\nthey respect the leader, they're loyal,\n\n236\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.950\nhave patience, great team player,\nproactive, analytical and\n\n237\n00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.520\nthoughtful, strong work ethic, a doer.\n\n238\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.080\nAnd the reason I take the time\nto read that list is,\n\n239\n00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.490\nwhat I'm gonna challenge you to do\nis sit down and think about that.\n\n240\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:49.580\nAs you go to build a team and launch a\nteam, you need to sorta create a model of,\n\n241\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.470\nwhat would the best\nperson on this team be?\n\n242\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.720\nIf I could pick anyone in the\norganization, out of the organization, and\n\n243\n00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.170\nbring someone on this team.\n\n244\n00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.530\nWhat are the elements I would look for\nin an ideal team member?\n\n245\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.490\n&gt;&gt; So that list that you just shared.\n\n246\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.800\nYou mentioned it's for\na specific application.\n\n247\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.670\nThose seem like kind of\nuniversal things though.\n\n248\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:11.760\nAre there times when some of those traits\nwouldn't be appropriate on a team?\n\n249\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Well not really inappropriate, but\nsome of those are highly specialized.\n\n250\n00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.810\nLike competence, you're gonna look for\n\n251\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.640\nsomeone that has a specific type of\ncompetence, a level of competence.\n\n252\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.540\nSometimes you want people with experience.\n\n253\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.957\nSometimes it's great to have people that\ndon't have experience with what you're\n\n254\n00:12:27.957 --> 00:12:31.177\ndoing, cuz they'll be innovative and\ncreative, and bring new ideas because\n\n255\n00:12:31.177 --> 00:12:34.274\nthey're not trapped in the paradigm\nof having worked in that area before.\n\n256\n00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:36.002\nSo yes, there are times that\nyou wanna change it up.\n\n257\n00:12:36.002 --> 00:12:38.994\nBut trust, integrity,\nhonesty, team player,\n\n258\n00:12:38.994 --> 00:12:44.492\ncommunication, passionate, committed,\nyou want that on every single team.\n\n259\n00:12:44.492 --> 00:12:47.540\n&gt;&gt; All right John so now we've put\ntogether that list of good attributes of\n\n260\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.380\na team member, what do we do with it?\n\n261\n00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.900\n&gt;&gt; Here's a couple different suggestions,\nand\n\n262\n00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.860\nthere's different ways\nyou're forming your teams.\n\n263\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.760\nSometimes you're going external\nto bring somebody in on a team.\n\n264\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.856\nYou're gonna be hiring them.\n\n265\n00:12:57.856 --> 00:12:59.215\nOr you'll be choosing internally.\n\n266\n00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:04.050\nAnd other times, your team members are\ngiven to you, you don't get to pick them.\n\n267\n00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.290\nSo let's talk about the first two.\n\n268\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.260\nWhat I would use this model for\nis to create it and\n\n269\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.810\nthen write it down and then prioritize it.\n\n270\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.720\nHere's the A skills that\nthis person has to have.\n\n271\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.204\nIf they don't have these skills, these\ncompetencies, this sort of a committment,\n\n272\n00:13:19.204 --> 00:13:22.085\npassion, I don't want them\non my team no matter what.\n\n273\n00:13:22.085 --> 00:13:25.739\nThen you'd have maybe B level,\nnice to have, this is important.\n\n274\n00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:27.800\nIt would add a lot of value,\nand then C, nice.\n\n275\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.150\nGreat, they speak five languages,\nthat's interesting.\n\n276\n00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.270\nBut this is an American team, or\nwe're all gonna speak English.\n\n277\n00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.130\nOnce you've created that, write it down.\n\n278\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.070\nUse that as a template for\nhiring either externally or internally.\n\n279\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.830\nAnd the reason you wanna\ndo it before that is so\n\n280\n00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.270\nyou've got no emotion involved when\nyou go to pick the team member.\n\n281\n00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.500\nSometimes they're folks you like,\nyou've known them for a while,\n\n282\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.740\nyou've got a friendship.\n\n283\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.560\nAnd it might not meet all the criteria but\n\n284\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.750\nyou think they'll be\npretty good on the team.\n\n285\n00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.850\nEvery now and then you can use intuition,\nbut I strongly recommend that if\n\n286\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.190\nthey don't have those A criteria, if they\ndon't meet the ideal team member model,\n\n287\n00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.470\nthe essentials, no matter how\nnice they are, or sweet, or kind,\n\n288\n00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.500\nor loving, you don't put them on the team.\n\n289\n00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.810\n&gt;&gt; So to clarify those A level skills,\nthey can be things like attributes,\n\n290\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.110\nlike trust or certain behaviors.\n\n291\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.630\nBut they could also be\nspecific competencies.\n\n292\n00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.120\nSo if you're putting together\na programming team and\n\n293\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.518\nsay I need someone that knows JavaScript.\n\n294\n00:14:20.518 --> 00:14:22.940\nThat's an A level skill as well?\n\n295\n00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.080\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, Peter.\n\n296\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.790\nIs I'm gonna look at skills that Java,\nthey've got experience,\n\n297\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.520\nthey've done a bunch of coding,\nthey know these sort of things.\n\n298\n00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.280\nSo I wanna create a list there of\nthey've got maybe leadership experience.\n\n299\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.470\nThey've worked on teams before.\n\n300\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.520\nThey've had more than five\nyears in the industry.\n\n301\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.810\nThey've worked on a project of\nover x millions of dollars.\n\n302\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.660\nSo that I've got someone that when they\nwalk on the team they've done it before,\n\n303\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.800\nthey know what they're doing.\n\n304\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.520\nAnd I mentioned earlier, maybe I\nwant somebody that doesn't have that\n\n305\n00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.610\nexperience, but\nthey're highly creative, innovative.\n\n306\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.800\nThey've done something\nthat would be adjacent and\n\n307\n00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.400\nknow a little bit about the topic.\n\n308\n00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.670\nJust enough that they\ncould bring in new ideas.\n\n309\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.925\nSo what you wanna do is create,\nfor this specific team,\n\n310\n00:15:03.925 --> 00:15:06.890\nthey have to have all of\nthese A level things.\n\n311\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.560\nThe B is great and the C is nice,\nbut it doesn't add any extra value.\n\n312\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.455\n&gt;&gt; So I think that all sounds great but\nit sounds a little bit a perfect world.\n\n313\n00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:17.920\nAnd I know a lot of cases out there,\nyou're told who your team is.\n\n314\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.841\nAnd It might include the boss's nephew.\n\n315\n00:15:19.841 --> 00:15:21.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who maybe has some C skills.\n\n316\n00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:24.748\nSo what do you do when\nyou're given a team,\n\n317\n00:15:24.748 --> 00:15:29.220\nand kinda forced upon you and\nyou have to put it together?\n\n318\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Great question, and\none that a lot of people run into.\n\n319\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.410\nA tool I've developed years ago\nis what I call a competency grid.\n\n320\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.640\nAnd what you do is ask each\none of the team members,\n\n321\n00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.700\nput all the team members down.\n\n322\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.713\nAnd you put all the different\nskills across the top.\n\n323\n00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:45.568\nAs you said, maybe Java or\nI have leadership as I said.\n\n324\n00:15:45.568 --> 00:15:47.540\nOr I've got five years experience.\n\n325\n00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.070\nOr I know a lot about innovation,\nbrainstorming.\n\n326\n00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.350\nI've got marketing background.\n\n327\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.490\nWhatever it might be.\n\n328\n00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.312\nEvery sort of skill that you would\nwant that team member to have.\n\n329\n00:15:57.312 --> 00:16:01.456\nThen you have them rate themselves,\nself-evaluate on a scale of one to ten at\n\n330\n00:16:01.456 --> 00:16:04.410\nhow good they feel they are at\neach one of those skills.\n\n331\n00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.509\nAnd this allows you to create a matrix on\nthe team of, if you really want to, and\n\n332\n00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:12.675\nthe team knew each other well, later on\nyou could have them evaluate the other,\n\n333\n00:16:12.675 --> 00:16:15.222\nsorta do it 360, but\nthis is a good way to start\n\n334\n00:16:15.222 --> 00:16:18.331\nto allow people to tell you\nwhere they think they're good,\n\n335\n00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:21.688\nwhere their skills lie,\nwhere they're most comfortable, and\n\n336\n00:16:21.688 --> 00:16:25.209\nthat helps you build them and\nput them in the right part of the team.\n\n337\n00:16:25.209 --> 00:16:29.117\n&gt;&gt; So we've been talking a lot about\nthe team members themselves, but\n\n338\n00:16:29.117 --> 00:16:33.096\nwhat about the team leader as well\nin terms of their accountability,\n\n339\n00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:35.993\nso there's expectations there as well,\nright?\n\n340\n00:16:35.993 --> 00:16:39.600\nI need to give you the tools\nyou need to do this job, or\n\n341\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.531\nhelp remove roadblocks that are gonna\nprevent you from doing your job.\n\n342\n00:16:44.531 --> 00:16:48.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the role of the team leader,\nand here's an interesting point is that\n\n343\n00:16:48.755 --> 00:16:53.377\ncan sometimes shift, you've always got\none person that's fully accountable for\n\n344\n00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:56.810\nthe team, whoever the sponsor\nnamed as the full team leader,\n\n345\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.168\nthey're the ones that have to make sure\nthe team has the resources, the time,\n\n346\n00:17:01.168 --> 00:17:06.022\nthe budget, the people, the equipment,\nall the things necessary to be successful.\n\n347\n00:17:06.022 --> 00:17:08.755\nHandle the bureaucracy,\nget rid of the red tape,\n\n348\n00:17:08.755 --> 00:17:12.008\ngo talk to seek other sponsors\nwithin the organization, so\n\n349\n00:17:12.008 --> 00:17:15.196\nthe leader plays a big role in\nputting out the red carpet for\n\n350\n00:17:15.196 --> 00:17:19.386\ntheir team and making sure they have\neverything they need to be successful.\n\n351\n00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:22.157\nThe leader also has enough maturity and\n\n352\n00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:27.121\nconfidence to ask other people to\nlead the teams at different points.\n\n353\n00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:30.372\nSo if you've got an area of expertise\nthat's not mine, and I'm the leader,\n\n354\n00:17:30.372 --> 00:17:33.023\nI'm gonna shift leadership on\nthat part of the project to you,\n\n355\n00:17:33.023 --> 00:17:36.523\nI still take accountability for the whole\nteam, and I'm still in charge of getting\n\n356\n00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:39.774\nall the resources for them, but I'm gonna\nlet you run this part of the project\n\n357\n00:17:39.774 --> 00:17:43.058\nbecause you know a lot more about it,\nthat's why I asked you to be on the team.\n\n358\n00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:46.632\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great leader, too, knowing\nwhat you don't know and relying on those\n\n359\n00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.711\npeople, and that goes back to that\ntrust and teamwork we talked about.\n\n360\n00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:54.163\nAll right, so now that we've figured out\nwhat kind of thing we need to create,\n\n361\n00:17:54.163 --> 00:17:56.861\nhow we need to create it,\nand who is on the team,\n\n362\n00:17:56.861 --> 00:18:01.381\nwe have that first meeting when we get\neveryone in the room, what do we do there,\n\n363\n00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:05.045\ntalking expectations and roles,\nand how does that process go?\n\n364\n00:18:05.045 --> 00:18:08.734\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna go into this in\na little bit more depth later on, but\n\n365\n00:18:08.734 --> 00:18:12.057\nat that first meeting when you\nbrought everybody together, and\n\n366\n00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:15.809\nthis is really the first step of\nforming the team, I've got the people,\n\n367\n00:18:15.809 --> 00:18:19.993\nI'm bringing them together, the leader\nneeds to set some overall expectations\n\n368\n00:18:19.993 --> 00:18:24.488\nabout accountability, about work product,\nabout communication, all those sort of\n\n369\n00:18:24.488 --> 00:18:28.779\nthings about how the team will be formed\nand what the leader's expectations are.\n\n370\n00:18:28.779 --> 00:18:32.843\nAnd they also need to clarify with\neverybody what the purpose of the team is,\n\n371\n00:18:32.843 --> 00:18:36.971\nwhere they're going, what success looks\nlike, and get full commitment and\n\n372\n00:18:36.971 --> 00:18:39.068\nalignment from everybody on the team,\n\n373\n00:18:39.068 --> 00:18:43.221\nthat they understand the general\nresponsibilities and accountabilities.\n\n374\n00:18:43.221 --> 00:18:46.708\nThey understand where they're going,\nwhat the purpose is, what the goals are,\n\n375\n00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:49.790\nwhat the outcome looks like,\nthey feel comfortable they can add value,\n\n376\n00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.912\nthey believe they've got the resources,\ntime,\n\n377\n00:18:51.912 --> 00:18:54.721\nand things necessary that have\nbeen given to them by the sponsor.\n\n378\n00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:58.256\nAnd they looked at the leader of the team,\nas they begin to form the team, and say,\n\n379\n00:18:58.256 --> 00:19:01.637\nI'm 100% committed, I believe in this\nteam, I believe in these people,\n\n380\n00:19:01.637 --> 00:19:03.453\nI'm ready to get started on the project.\n\n381\n00:19:03.453 --> 00:19:07.715\n&gt;&gt; So when we're talking about\naccountability and goals, we're maybe\n\n382\n00:19:07.715 --> 00:19:12.556\nlooking at a project as a whole, so\nlet's say we're building a new mobile app,\n\n383\n00:19:12.556 --> 00:19:16.959\nthe success at the end is, did we build\nthis app, does it do what we said it\n\n384\n00:19:16.959 --> 00:19:21.901\nshould do, but should we be looking at\nthose things on a more incremental level?\n\n385\n00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:26.740\nSo when we're saying, here's our goals and\nthe expectations for you as a member of\n\n386\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.888\nthe team, John, it's not just the big\npicture looking at the end, but\n\n387\n00:19:30.888 --> 00:19:34.213\nit's here's what you're\ngonna accomplish this week,\n\n388\n00:19:34.213 --> 00:19:37.428\nhere's how we're gonna set\nup that accountability.\n\n389\n00:19:37.428 --> 00:19:42.118\nYeah, that's gonna be another one of\nthe modules in this is what are the roles,\n\n390\n00:19:42.118 --> 00:19:46.808\ngoals and accountabilities on a team, but\nwe do want to be able to break it down,\n\n391\n00:19:46.808 --> 00:19:50.098\nthe thing that I think is\ncritical with a team, though,\n\n392\n00:19:50.098 --> 00:19:54.091\nis to allow the team to have some sort\nof a say in how all that is built.\n\n393\n00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:57.749\nMany teams that are dysfunctional fail\nbecause someone gives them a goal,\n\n394\n00:19:57.749 --> 00:20:01.580\ngives them a direction, gives them\na purpose, tells them exactly what to do,\n\n395\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.178\nwhat their budget is, what their\ntimeline is, they have no say in it and,\n\n396\n00:20:05.178 --> 00:20:08.894\nthe phrase I always like to say is that\nif you don't have a say in the outcome,\n\n397\n00:20:08.894 --> 00:20:10.849\nyou don't have a stake in the outcome.\n\n398\n00:20:10.849 --> 00:20:13.304\nAnd if you don't have a committed,\npassionate,\n\n399\n00:20:13.304 --> 00:20:16.519\nengaged team that feels like\nthey've got some level of control,\n\n400\n00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:20.334\nyou will not ever get it to be a high\nlevel performance team that ships on time.\n\n401\n00:20:20.334 --> 00:20:24.913\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I love the saying you hear\na lot in agile development of a servant\n\n402\n00:20:24.913 --> 00:20:29.933\nleader, so a leader that's going to say\nperiodically throughout that process,\n\n403\n00:20:29.933 --> 00:20:34.801\nwhat can I do to help you, what skills do\nyou need, what training do you need, or\n\n404\n00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:39.672\nwhat things can I get out of your way that\nare stopping you from not being able to do\n\n405\n00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:40.369\nyour job?\n\n406\n00:20:40.369 --> 00:20:45.309\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, servant leadership comes from a\ngentleman named Greenleaf, and it's really\n\n407\n00:20:45.309 --> 00:20:49.771\nthe way leadership is changing, years\nago it used to be command and control,\n\n408\n00:20:49.771 --> 00:20:54.226\ndo as I say, not as I do, which is what I\nwas just describing with a sponsor that\n\n409\n00:20:54.226 --> 00:20:59.131\njust gives the team all of the information\nand says, go do this, it's do it or else.\n\n410\n00:20:59.131 --> 00:21:03.575\nThat doesn't really work and it especially\ndoesn't work with millennials and\n\n411\n00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:08.151\nthe new generation of workers, then it\nshifted to a lot of management by numbers,\n\n412\n00:21:08.151 --> 00:21:12.065\nand spreadsheet and project and\nall those sort of things where it was,\n\n413\n00:21:12.065 --> 00:21:15.619\ndid we meet our numbers,\nwhat does the spreadsheet look like?\n\n414\n00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:18.372\nNow it's much more gone\nto servant leadership and\n\n415\n00:21:18.372 --> 00:21:21.324\nthe big idea there is compassion,\nconnection, EQ,\n\n416\n00:21:21.324 --> 00:21:24.813\nthe ability to understand the needs and\nthe worries of others.\n\n417\n00:21:24.813 --> 00:21:27.142\nAnd then a big, big part of,\nis the leader being,\n\n418\n00:21:27.142 --> 00:21:30.249\ninstead of at the top of the pyramid,\nflipping the pyramid over and\n\n419\n00:21:30.249 --> 00:21:33.967\nbeing the one who serves the rest of the\nteam and helps them be successful because\n\n420\n00:21:33.967 --> 00:21:37.221\nthey know if the team is successful,\nI'm successful as the leader.\n\n421\n00:21:37.221 --> 00:21:37.758\n&gt;&gt; Great, John.\n\n422\n00:21:37.758 --> 00:21:41.515\nNow I think we've got a pretty good\nunderstanding of how to build a team,\n\n423\n00:21:41.515 --> 00:21:44.533\nhow to set up the different\nteam members and pick that, and\n\n424\n00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:48.413\nI know we're gonna get to some of the\nother things later in terms of now how to\n\n425\n00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:51.123\nactually worked with that\nteam on the day to day, but\n\n426\n00:21:51.123 --> 00:21:54.489\nany final thoughts on this before\nwe leave off for this episode?\n\n427\n00:21:54.489 --> 00:21:56.533\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you don't get\nstarted off on the right foot,\n\n428\n00:21:56.533 --> 00:21:58.231\nit's really hard to\nhave an effective team.\n\n429\n00:21:58.231 --> 00:22:02.271\nSo, you wanna clearly understand where\nyou're going, make sure you're in full\n\n430\n00:22:02.271 --> 00:22:06.374\nalignment with the sponsor, get the best\npeople you can possibly get on your team,\n\n431\n00:22:06.374 --> 00:22:09.653\nthe ones that are ideal team members,\nand then gain commitment and\n\n432\n00:22:09.653 --> 00:22:13.287\nalignment before the team even gets\ntogether, or as you put it together,\n\n433\n00:22:13.287 --> 00:22:16.801\nto make sure that we all start off on\nthe same page in the same direction,\n\n434\n00:22:16.801 --> 00:22:18.951\nexcited about working together as a team.\n\n435\n00:22:18.951 --> 00:22:22.016\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, and I'm excited about\nthese future episodes we have, and\n\n436\n00:22:22.016 --> 00:22:24.841\nfiguring out this whole process from here,\nso thank you, John.\n\n437\n00:22:24.841 --> 00:22:25.497\n&gt;&gt; My pleasure, Peter.\n\n438\n00:22:25.497 --> 00:22:28.723\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that is going to do\nit for this episode here on BizProTV,\n\n439\n00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:32.497\nlike I said we've got a lot more coming up\nwith a lot more information on how you're\n\n440\n00:22:32.497 --> 00:22:35.943\nactually going to work together with\nthis team, but we are going to do it for\n\n441\n00:22:35.943 --> 00:22:38.496\nthis episode, so signing off,\nI am Peter VanRysdam.\n\n442\n00:22:38.496 --> 00:22:39.274\n&gt;&gt; And I'm John Spence.\n\n443\n00:22:39.274 --> 00:22:39.949\n&gt;&gt; And we'ill see you next time.\n\n444\n00:22:39.949 --> 00:22:49.853\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
