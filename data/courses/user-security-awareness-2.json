series.\n\n3\n00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.700\nToday, we're gonna be talking\nabout safely using macros.\n\n4\n00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.850\nAnd so, Mike,\nlet's start to the beginning.\n\n5\n00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.205\nWhat exactly is a macro?\n\n6\n00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:18.978\n&gt;&gt; That's probably a good place to start,\nright?\n\n7\n00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:21.544\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A macro is basically a block of code\n\n8\n00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:25.740\nthat we can have executed automatically,\nright?\n\n9\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.800\nThis is within my office\nprograms primarily.\n\n10\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.675\nThey're written in a language known as\nVBA or Visual Basic for Applications.\n\n11\n00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:36.735\nBut it basically allows me to\nautomate repetitive tasks or\n\n12\n00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.015\nthere are things that I have to do.\n\n13\n00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:42.575\nLet's say for example, every Friday I\nget a data dump from our database.\n\n14\n00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.852\nAnd I have to format it and make it\npretty and get it ready for a report for\n\n15\n00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:48.732\nour meeting on Friday afternoon.\n\n16\n00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:50.242\nSo every Friday it's the same thing.\n\n17\n00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:54.982\nGo in, make the columns wider,\nchange the font, change the colors.\n\n18\n00:00:54.982 --> 00:00:56.312\nDo some syntax highlighting or\n\n19\n00:00:56.312 --> 00:00:59.412\nwhatever, I've got to go through\nall of these steps every Friday.\n\n20\n00:00:59.412 --> 00:01:03.262\nWhat I can do within office is\nI can record those steps right?\n\n21\n00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:06.532\nIt's just like the old school tape\nrecorder, if anybody goes back that far.\n\n22\n00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:07.777\nI know I'm dating myself here.\n\n23\n00:01:07.777 --> 00:01:10.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you basically hit record Go through\n\n24\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.120\nall those formatting steps, for\nexample, and then hit Stop.\n\n25\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.009\nAnd then any time you want\nto repeat those steps.\n\n26\n00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.237\nSo next Friday when I get that data dump,\nall I have to do is execute my macro.\n\n27\n00:01:20.237 --> 00:01:23.437\nAnd it'll go through all of those\nsteps I did that I recorded.\n\n28\n00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:27.981\nAnd I'll have my product within seconds\nrather than minutes to do all of that\n\n29\n00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:28.970\nmanually.\n\n30\n00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.367\n&gt;&gt; So great, so macros can go ahead and\nmake us more efficient office users.\n\n31\n00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:35.618\nSomething that might take us five\nto ten minutes, we can record and\n\n32\n00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:37.450\nit takes two seconds.\n\n33\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, let me show you an example\nof what we can do with macros.\n\n34\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.040\nI'm gonna open up Excel,\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n35\n00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.050\nAnd I'm gonna open up a spreadsheet\ncalled Field Day Games.\n\n36\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.610\nAnd here I can see this might be\nmy data dump that I get on Friday.\n\n37\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.350\nObviously, a very small dataset.\n\n38\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.570\nJust for examples.\n\n39\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.220\nBut every Friday I get this, and\nI have to go in and make it pretty.\n\n40\n00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.580\nWell, what I've done ahead of\ntime is I've recorded a macro.\n\n41\n00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.160\nSo now, all I have to do is run it.\n\n42\n00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.550\nI've even assigned\na keyboard shortcut to it.\n\n43\n00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.941\nSo I'm gonna run my keyboard short.\n\n44\n00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:07.175\nAnd [SOUND] it inserts a table,\nit makes the columns wider,\n\n45\n00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:09.900\nit does all my formatting on my text.\n\n46\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.190\nAnd it was pretty darn easy right?\n\n47\n00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.770\nSo macros can be very, very, cool.\n\n48\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.577\n&gt;&gt; Well that's great.\nSo you've said or\n\n49\n00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:19.680\nat least the title of this\nshow is safely using macros.\n\n50\n00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.490\nSo when I hear the word safely,\n\n51\n00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.450\nI'm assuming there's some danger\nlurking around the corner.\n\n52\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.300\n&gt;&gt; Danger, danger.\n\n53\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.580\nRight exactly.\n\n54\n00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.819\nThe macros are great I love them.\n\n55\n00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.080\nAnd we're not gonna go into how\nto create macros in this show.\n\n56\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.920\nIt's more about using them securely.\n\n57\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.780\nBut we do have other\ncourses in our library.\n\n58\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.350\nIf you're interested in\nhow to create these macros\n\n59\n00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.090\nmake sure you check those out.\n\n60\n00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.770\nBut you're right,\nthey can be dangerous and here's why.\n\n61\n00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.730\nTwo big reasons I'll say is one,\nthey can run automatically, right?\n\n62\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.470\nLet me show you an example of that.\n\n63\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.890\nLet me close down this spreadsheet.\n\n64\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.965\nAnd I'll open up another workbook called,\nlet's do Popup.\n\n65\n00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:06.110\nAll right, and as soon as I open this\nworkbook, I get a little dialog box.\n\n66\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.780\nAnd if I zoom in so\n\n67\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.630\neverybody can see that, you can see\nit's probably not a good thing.\n\n68\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.250\nIt says I've been hacked and\nthat's probably a bad thing.\n\n69\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo, you're saying that visual basic or\n\n70\n00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.670\nthat code thing that you said\nthat these macros are written in,\n\n71\n00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.310\nit can be written to not say when I\nchoose to run the macro as a user.\n\n72\n00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.920\nIt could just do it automatically.\n\n73\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.450\nThat's the potential for danger.\n\n74\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because these macros,\nagain, are very powerful.\n\n75\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.313\nAs you said VBA or Visual Basic for\n\n76\n00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:37.695\nApplications can do more than just\nmanipulate my data within the spreadsheet.\n\n77\n00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:40.867\nIt can actually access\nmy operating system and\n\n78\n00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.561\nall of the stuff on my computer as well.\n\n79\n00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:46.250\nLet me go ahead and show you what\nwould happen when I click this\n\n80\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.730\nbutton cuz you notice I\nget a spinning Cheerio.\n\n81\n00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.480\nI can't click on anything else.\n\n82\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.300\nAnd I might think, well,\nI'm not gonna click the OK button,\n\n83\n00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.910\nI'll just close this dialogue box.\n\n84\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.150\nIt doesn't matter,\nthe macro continues to run.\n\n85\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.290\nAnd what you see now is that\nall of my data is gone.\n\n86\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.110\nAnd I'm left with this jolly\nrancher staring back at me which is\n\n87\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.320\nprobably not gonna make for a good day.\n\n88\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.071\n&gt;&gt; No,\nthat wouldn't make my day happy at all.\n\n89\n00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:09.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, cuz we just lost all of our data.\n\n90\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.288\nSo that's the big danger.\n\n91\n00:04:11.288 --> 00:04:15.000\nOr one of the big dangers is the fact that\nthese macros can be configured to run\n\n92\n00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.320\nautomatically without\nany user interaction.\n\n93\n00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.735\nI didn't need to do anything.\n\n94\n00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:21.840\nLet me show you another thing\nthat makes macros dangerous.\n\n95\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.260\nI'm gonna close this workbook.\n\n96\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.680\nAnd I'm gonna open up another one that\nI've created earlier, called filelist.\n\n97\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.500\nIn here, we'll then look like what you\ndidn't notice was there was a macro that\n\n98\n00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.380\nexecuted as soon as I\nopened up this workbook.\n\n99\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.835\nAnd if I look at the data\nin this worksheet.\n\n100\n00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:44.729\nWhat that macro actually did was reach out\nto my hard drive and look at the folder\n\n101\n00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.740\ncalled Macro demo on my hard drive and\nstart listing out all of the files.\n\n102\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.410\nSo here we see an example of a macro\nthat's gone outside of Excel and\n\n103\n00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.370\nis actually touching my\nhard drive on my computer.\n\n104\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.870\nNow this one I wrote it myself and it's\nmy data so I kept it relatively benign.\n\n105\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.759\nBut just as easily as listing these files\nout that it found on my hard drive,\n\n106\n00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.527\nit might have got into my documents and\nstarted deleting files, right,\n\n107\n00:05:08.527 --> 00:05:11.956\nstarted formatting drives,\nit could do, it's very powerful.\n\n108\n00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:15.540\nIt has access to the Windows\noperating system itself.\n\n109\n00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.710\nAnd with the right programmer behind it,\n\n110\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.840\nit can do some very bad\nthings to your computer.\n\n111\n00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.037\nAnd this is why while macros\nare fantastic, we love them,\n\n112\n00:05:24.037 --> 00:05:27.112\nwe can automate a lot of our\nrepetitive tasks with them.\n\n113\n00:05:27.112 --> 00:05:31.277\nWe do have to use some caution with\nthem because they can be used for\n\n114\n00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:33.040\nmalicious purposes.\n\n115\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.060\n&gt;&gt; And this could be somewhat disastrous\nif you're losing all of your data on\n\n116\n00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.890\nyour computer, that's bad.\n\n117\n00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.600\nSo how can we keep ourselves safe?\n\n118\n00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.355\nWhat can we do to maybe\nhave this not happen to us.\n\n119\n00:05:46.355 --> 00:05:48.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\nthat's a great question, right?\n\n120\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.730\nAnd that's why all of us are here is to\nfigure out how to keep that from happening\n\n121\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.890\nbecause it would be bad.\n\n122\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.270\nIf I didn't have a back up of that\nworkbook I would've lost all that data and\n\n123\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.760\nsome how had to create all that.\n\n124\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.050\n&gt;&gt; Or even more your whole file system.\n\n125\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.935\nI don't back up my hard drive\nup as much as I probably should.\n\n126\n00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:08.210\n[LAUGH] Or maybe in a corporate\nenvironment that's not even something\n\n127\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.470\nthat I'm responsible for.\n\n128\n00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.810\nSo this could be bad.\n\n129\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they could be copying files\nout to a bad guy's computer, right?\n\n130\n00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.040\nExfiltrating data, lots of bad things.\n\n131\n00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.030\nSo how do we stay safe?\n\n132\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.690\nHow do we make sure that these\nmacros are doing good and not bad?\n\n133\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.020\nWell, actually the first thing we'll talk\nabout is the fact that Microsoft does\n\n134\n00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.370\na lot to keep us safe.\n\n135\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.390\nBy default, Office products block macros.\n\n136\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.810\nAnd they're gonna give us\na little warning that says hey,\n\n137\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.070\nthere's a macro in this document\nthat you just tried to open up.\n\n138\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.755\nDo you want it to run?\n\n139\n00:06:38.755 --> 00:06:41.269\nNow you might've noticed in\nthose spreadsheets that I just\n\n140\n00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:43.440\nshowed you as examples,\nthey ran automatically.\n\n141\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.915\nThere was no warning and you're like,\n\n142\n00:06:44.915 --> 00:06:47.025\nwell, wait, Mike,\nwhy didn't Office keep you safe?\n\n143\n00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:49.110\nWell, because I set this up for our demos.\n\n144\n00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.410\nI wanted you to see what could happen if I\nstart changing some of those defaults and\n\n145\n00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.860\nnot have to worry about\nthat at the beginning.\n\n146\n00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.800\nSo we get to see the example of\nmacros running automatically.\n\n147\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.000\n&gt;&gt; So there's somewhere that you actually\nset that, there's a Trust Center,\n\n148\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.770\nI think it's called.\n\n149\n00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.420\nOr something that you said, I'm okay to\nrun this, and you set that up somewhere.\n\n150\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.420\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nlet me show you an example of that.\n\n151\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.960\nSo I'm gonna close this workbook,\nand open up a new one.\n\n152\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.900\nAnd let's do this financial sample.\n\n153\n00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.340\nSo, when I open up this workbook,\n\n154\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.830\nthis is the default behavior of\nmy Microsoft Office products.\n\n155\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.900\nAnd what you'll see is, right across the\ntop of my spreadsheet, is this yellow bar.\n\n156\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.350\nAnd, if I zoom into that,\nyou see it says security warning.\n\n157\n00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.235\nMacros have been disabled.\n\n158\n00:07:35.235 --> 00:07:38.160\nAnd I've got a button there\nthat says enable content.\n\n159\n00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.580\nThis is Microsoft Office\ntrying to keep us safe.\n\n160\n00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.910\nIt's saying hey, there's a macro in here.\n\n161\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.420\nI don't know if you're aware of it.\n\n162\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.170\nIt might run automatically, it might not.\n\n163\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.146\nI don't know what it does.\n\n164\n00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:52.870\nBut I'm gonna let you decide whether or\nnot you wanna allow that content to run.\n\n165\n00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.840\nSo this is something that I got\nfrom Vaughn, from a coworker.\n\n166\n00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.610\nSomething that I'm expecting that I\ntrust the creator of the document.\n\n167\n00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.320\nOr maybe I know there's supposed to be\na macro in there, I can go ahead and\n\n168\n00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.140\nclick Enable Content and\nallow those macros to run.\n\n169\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.320\nIf I don't know the creator\nof this document.\n\n170\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.610\nLet's say I downloaded a template\nfrom some place online.\n\n171\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.520\nI found some really cool template that I\nwant to use to create some spreadsheet so\n\n172\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.930\nI went and downloaded it.\n\n173\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.870\nI opened it up and\nit has this yellow warning on there.\n\n174\n00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.406\nWell now I wanna think twice before I\nclick enable because if I click enable\n\n175\n00:08:29.406 --> 00:08:32.415\ncontent it is going to\nallow those macros to run.\n\n176\n00:08:32.415 --> 00:08:34.600\nAnd if I don't know who wrote these.\n\n177\n00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.930\nHow do I know what those macros are doing,\nright?\n\n178\n00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:42.981\nI don't, so I had to be really, really\ncareful about what I choose to allow.\n\n179\n00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:46.611\nNow if I go ahead, and because I know that\nthis came from somebody that I trust,\n\n180\n00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:49.060\nI can go ahead and click Enable Content.\n\n181\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.310\nAnd now the macros are gonna\nbe allowed to run.\n\n182\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.390\nSo I can do, I don't know, let's see.\n\n183\n00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.640\nI think I've got a couple in here.\n\n184\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.795\nI've got my Ctrl+G.\n\n185\n00:08:56.795 --> 00:09:00.249\nThere is a macro that I created\nthat turned all numbers greater\n\n186\n00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:02.750\nthan 100,000 green.\n\n187\n00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:07.550\nI got another one in here that\nwill turn anything under zero,\n\n188\n00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.810\nI think it was, will turn them red, right.\n\n189\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.429\nSo once I enable those macros,\nI say yes, Microsoft Office,\n\n190\n00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:18.062\nI trust this document, and\nI wanna allow those macros to run.\n\n191\n00:09:18.062 --> 00:09:19.321\nNow they're able to run.\n\n192\n00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:22.556\nIf I had closed that yellow bar\nwithout clicking the Enable Content,\n\n193\n00:09:22.556 --> 00:09:26.340\nI'd still be able to look at the data,\nstill be able to modify the data.\n\n194\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.750\nBut the macros would be disabled,\nand it wouldn't allow those to run.\n\n195\n00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.560\nAnd again, that is the default behavior\nfor your Microsoft Office products.\n\n196\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.490\nThat's how they're gonna keep us safe.\n\n197\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.140\nRight.\n\n198\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.977\nNow, once you have chosen\nto enable that content.\n\n199\n00:09:40.977 --> 00:09:43.554\nMicrosoft Office will\nremember your decision and\n\n200\n00:09:43.554 --> 00:09:46.820\nit is going to say okay,\nyou trust these document.\n\n201\n00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:54.370\nSo when I close these, let us say, I save\nmy changes, and I close my document.\n\n202\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.180\nThe next time I open that up.\n\n203\n00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.070\nAnd that was my financial sample.\n\n204\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.230\nNotice I don't get the yellow bar anymore,\nright?\n\n205\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.950\nBecause I've already told it,\nhey I know where this came from.\n\n206\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.310\nI trust it, go ahead and\nallow them to run.\n\n207\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.010\n&gt;&gt; So that's what you did with those first\nexample files as you had already saved\n\n208\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.910\nyour changes, saved your macro.\n\n209\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.780\nAnd it remembered you said,\nyep I'm good with this.\n\n210\n00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.820\nAnd so that's why it ran.\n\n211\n00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.290\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so I kinda set it up so\nthat we could see the dangers there.\n\n212\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.810\nBut normally Office is gonna do\na good job of keeping us safe\n\n213\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.880\nunless you've changed some\nof those default settings or\n\n214\n00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.980\nunless your IT department has\nmade some changes using policy.\n\n215\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.390\nThey might have adjusted that but that\nis the default out of the box behavior.\n\n216\n00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.430\nNow there is something I wanna warn\nyou about when you choose that\n\n217\n00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.970\nEnable Content, right?\n\n218\n00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.380\nIf this is a document\nthat I have created or\n\n219\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.120\nsomething that I've got from\na coworker and I trust it.\n\n220\n00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.950\nI've stored it on my local hard-drive,\nand I enabled the content.\n\n221\n00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.610\nWell from then on out again Microsoft is\ngonna or Office will remember that and\n\n222\n00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.400\nwon't prompt me every time,\nthat's a good thing.\n\n223\n00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.420\nThe danger in that though we\nwanna make sure that we were\n\n224\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.350\nconscious of what we are choosing\nto trust, all right?\n\n225\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.270\nBecause what if this document\nwas up on a shared folder,\n\n226\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.650\nwhere other people have access to it.\n\n227\n00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:13.460\nI might open that up and click enable and\nthen save it and close it,\n\n228\n00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.050\nright, and it's gonna remember my choice.\n\n229\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.490\nSo the next time I open it up,\n\n230\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.000\nit's just gonna automatically\nallow those macros to run.\n\n231\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.398\nIt's not gonna warn me again, what if\nsomebody has made changes to those macros?\n\n232\n00:11:23.398 --> 00:11:27.350\nWhat if Vaughn got really mad at me and\nshe went up there and\n\n233\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.630\nchanged the macro to do\nsomething bad to my computer.\n\n234\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.690\nWell, I've already trusted it.\n\n235\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.100\nI open it up, and\nit's gonna allow those macros to run.\n\n236\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.700\nSo something you wanna\nconsider anytime you're\n\n237\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.465\nworking with a document that's in a shared\nlocation that other people have access to.\n\n238\n00:11:43.465 --> 00:11:44.655\nThink twice about trusting it.\n\n239\n00:11:44.655 --> 00:11:46.145\n&gt;&gt; Yeah because it might not be me.\n\n240\n00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:48.920\nIt might be Bob down the hall,\nbecause I would never do that to you Mike.\n\n241\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.442\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully not.\n\n242\n00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.135\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is on a shared drive, and\n\n243\n00:11:51.135 --> 00:11:52.455\nif it's a shared drive,\n\n244\n00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:56.570\nwe might not know how many other\npeople have permission to that drive.\n\n245\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.790\nI know that I can get it, I know that you\ncan get it, but that might be something\n\n246\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.050\nthat you're IT department sets\nthe permissions for everybody.\n\n247\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.940\nAnd I might not know who's going in there.\n\n248\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.804\nSo, that's a really good point to\nknow about shared locations and\n\n249\n00:12:08.804 --> 00:12:09.841\nfiles like that.\n\n250\n00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:12.418\nIs there anything else that can indicate\n\n251\n00:12:12.418 --> 00:12:16.040\nto us if there's a macro\nin that particular file?\n\n252\n00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.620\n&gt;&gt; There are, so\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n253\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.850\nSo really when it comes to macro safety,\n\n254\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.620\nthe first thing I need to know is,\nis there a macro in this document, right?\n\n255\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.732\nSo, let's take a look at my screen.\n\n256\n00:12:24.732 --> 00:12:27.338\nAnd I'm gonna open up file explore and\n\n257\n00:12:27.338 --> 00:12:33.370\nthen I'm gonna navigate into a location\nthat has some of my spreadsheets in here.\n\n258\n00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.270\nAnd if we zoom in, you'll see I have two\nspreadsheets called Financial Sample.\n\n259\n00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.290\nThey look almost identical.\n\n260\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.760\nBut look really closely at the icon.\n\n261\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.737\nLet's see if I can zoom\nin any further here.\n\n262\n00:12:44.737 --> 00:12:46.780\n&gt;&gt; There's a little thing in the corner,\nisn't there?\n\n263\n00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.790\n&gt;&gt; There is, right?\n\n264\n00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.790\nIf I move,\nlet's see how I can get over there.\n\n265\n00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:56.780\nThat first financial sample, it has what's\nsupposed to be a little scroll, right?\n\n266\n00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.070\nThat's indicating that there's a script.\n\n267\n00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.620\nOr a macro in that document.\n\n268\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:06.100\nThe one below it has a normal Excel icon,\nthat one does not have Macro.\n\n269\n00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.744\nSo that's my first\nindicator that whether or\n\n270\n00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:11.537\nnot there are macros in this document,\nright?\n\n271\n00:13:11.537 --> 00:13:12.986\nAnd I wanna pay attention to that.\n\n272\n00:13:12.986 --> 00:13:15.324\nAnother way that we can\ndetermine whether or\n\n273\n00:13:15.324 --> 00:13:19.170\nnot there are macros is by looking\nat the file extension, right?\n\n274\n00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.620\nNow by default your Windows\noperating system might be hiding\n\n275\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.540\nwhat's known as the file extensions.\n\n276\n00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.150\nRight?\n\n277\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:31.410\nThe .XLSX for a Spreadsheet or\n.DOCX for a Word document.\n\n278\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.900\nIt's what tells the computer\nwhat application to use\n\n279\n00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.760\nwhen you double click on a document,\nwhat do I open this up with?\n\n280\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.190\nBut by default I don't\nsee those extensions.\n\n281\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.680\nSo what you can do is you can go to your\nView menu up here at the top, right?\n\n282\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.470\nAnd click on View.\n\n283\n00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.910\nAnd I can put a check mark here for\nFile Name Extensions.\n\n284\n00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.860\nWhen I do that, Windows is no\nlonger gonna hide those extensions.\n\n285\n00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.089\nAnd when I zoom in,\na little too far there.\n\n286\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.520\nNow we can see the difference\nas well in the name.\n\n287\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:06.525\nYou can see Financial Sample.xlsm and\nFinancial Sample.xlsx.\n\n288\n00:14:06.525 --> 00:14:11.463\nThe .xlsx, that's a standard workbook,\nno macros allowed.\n\n289\n00:14:11.463 --> 00:14:15.510\n.xlsm, that's a macros enabled workbook.\n\n290\n00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.780\nThat means there might or\nmight not be Macros in there.\n\n291\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.280\nSo, that's what you want to look for.\n\n292\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.590\nLet's say you're downloading\na document from, a shared location.\n\n293\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.220\nOr, you're downloading something from the\nInternet, the first thing you want to do,\n\n294\n00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.820\nbefore you open it up is look at it.\n\n295\n00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.260\nLook at that icon.\n\n296\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.757\nAre there macros in there, or not?\n\n297\n00:14:34.757 --> 00:14:38.730\nAnd, if you're not expecting macros\nto be in there, don't open it, right?\n\n298\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.590\nIf you are expecting\nmacros to be in there,\n\n299\n00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.070\nthen maybe you go ahead and\nclick on it and allow those.\n\n300\n00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.930\nSo make sure you're\nchecking that extension or\n\n301\n00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:51.480\nat least that icon to determine whether or\nnot there are macros in those documents.\n\n302\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.250\nSo in the end there is a few things\nthat we can do to keep safe and\n\n303\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.530\nsafely use these macros, right?\n\n304\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.970\nThe first one is understand whether or\nnot there are macros in the document.\n\n305\n00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.100\nWe can do that with the icon\nin Windows Explorer or\n\n306\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.400\nthe File Extension once we turn those on.\n\n307\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.940\nThe second thing is, make sure you\ntrust who you've got the document from.\n\n308\n00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.000\nIf there are macros in there,\ndid I get this from a coworker,\n\n309\n00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.900\nfrom somebody that I trust?\n\n310\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.420\nOr did I download this from the Internet?\n\n311\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.520\nAnd I have no idea who made it.\n\n312\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.490\nIf I downloaded it from the Internet and\nI don't know who made it\n\n313\n00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.990\nthen I might want to think twice\nabout double clicking on that and\n\n314\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.670\ndefinitely think twice before\nclicking that Enable Content.\n\n315\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.890\nAnd even if it comes from somebody that's\ntrusted like let's say Vaughn sent me\n\n316\n00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.320\na workbook.\n\n317\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.780\nI think it's from Vaughn.\n\n318\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.560\nThere are ways the bad guys can\nimpersonate people right, and\n\n319\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.590\nsend you emails that didn't\nreally come from Vaughn.\n\n320\n00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:49.200\nSo if she sends me a spreadsheet, and I\nsee that there's a macro in that workbook,\n\n321\n00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.880\nmaybe I'll wanna send\nVaughn a quick message,\n\n322\n00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.400\nhey Vaughn,\ndid you had a macro that workbook?\n\n323\n00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.380\nYes I did.\n\n324\n00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.360\nOkay cool, and I know,\nand now I can trust it.\n\n325\n00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.220\nBut if she says, no,\nI didn't add any macros.\n\n326\n00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.070\nI don't even know what a macro is.\n\n327\n00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.648\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n328\n00:16:01.648 --> 00:16:04.690\nWell, now I wanna think twice\nbefore opening that document.\n\n329\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.550\nSo look at the File Extensions,\npay attention to whether or\n\n330\n00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.620\nnot there are macros in there and\nknow the source.\n\n331\n00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:16.267\nMake sure you trust who they came\nfrom before enabling those macros.\n\n332\n00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:20.360\nCuz as you've seen, macros can be\nvery beneficial, very helpful.\n\n333\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.402\nThey can also be very malicious.\n\n334\n00:16:22.402 --> 00:16:25.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Mike for all that\ngreat information about keeping us safe.\n\n335\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.850\nI feel a lot safer.\n\n336\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.410\nI know we have a lot more to talk\nabout when it comes to security.\n\n337\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.862\nSo stay tuned.\n\n338\n00:16:30.862 -->

Thank you so much for\nhaving me, Mr. Pezet.\n\n16\n00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:39.779\nI'm glad to be over here in this driver's\nseat to teach you guys a little bit about\n\n17\n00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:41.251\nsome end user security today.\n\n18\n00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:45.993\nAnd today we're specifically\ngoing to talk about passwords.\n\n19\n00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:49.910\nYes, I know, you're probably going,\nnot this, not passwords, I hate passwords,\n\n20\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.492\nthey're the bane of my existence.\n\n21\n00:00:51.492 --> 00:00:54.948\nAnd yes, I have heard that many, many\ntimes from many, many users because we\n\n22\n00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:58.150\nunderstand that there are logins for\njust about everything nowadays.\n\n23\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.000\nAnd you have to create a secure\npassword and I can never remember it.\n\n24\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.680\nAnd what's a good password?\n\n25\n00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.129\nI'll just use my mom's maiden name and\nthat'll be great and\n\n26\n00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.146\nwe're off to the races.\n\n27\n00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:10.580\nSo we need to talk today about\nwhat does make up a good password.\n\n28\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.475\nSomething that you can use that will\nbe easy for you to remember and\n\n29\n00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.220\nwork with, and\nmaybe even work across the board.\n\n30\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.490\nIt will work with this sign\non as well as this sign on.\n\n31\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.790\nI know that a lot of different vendors\nwill give you a lot of different criteria\n\n32\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.280\nfor passwords, so we're gonna\ntalk about that subject as well.\n\n33\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.162\nBut we're just gonna start\noff with the basics.\n\n34\n00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:33.452\nI like to call it, Don,\nthe good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n35\n00:01:33.452 --> 00:01:35.546\nAnd unfortunately,\nwe're not going to start with the good.\n\n36\n00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:38.008\nWe're gonna start with the bad and\nthen we're going to move to the ugly.\n\n37\n00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:39.530\nAnd then we'll get to the good.\n\n38\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.569\nBecause we have to understand what a bad\npassword is first before we can understand\n\n39\n00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.217\nwhat a good password looks like.\n\n40\n00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:46.577\nSo that's where we're\ngoing to start today.\n\n41\n00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:49.957\n&gt;&gt; Now, Daniel, you mentioned like\npeople dread learning about passwords.\n\n42\n00:01:49.957 --> 00:01:52.659\nWhat's such a big deal about passwords?\n\n43\n00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.831\n&gt;&gt; The big deal is,\nis that typically in my experience,\n\n44\n00:01:55.831 --> 00:02:00.482\na lot of people hate having to come up\nwith something that meets the criteria for\n\n45\n00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:03.601\ntheir environment,\ntheir organization, right?\n\n46\n00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.729\nThey've said,\nit's gotta be x amount of characters long.\n\n47\n00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.009\nYou've gotta add this.\n\n48\n00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.049\nIt's gotta have a number.\n\n49\n00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:08.919\nIt's gotta have that.\n\n50\n00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:09.994\nIt's gotta have this.\n\n51\n00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:13.578\nAnd coming up with that can be an area\nof consternation for a lot of people.\n\n52\n00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:17.114\nAnd then, after x amount of days,\n40, 50 days.\n\n53\n00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:18.186\nMaybe 30 days.\n\n54\n00:02:18.186 --> 00:02:20.460\nThey tell you you gotta do\nit all over again, right?\n\n55\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.229\nSo this can be the hair pulling,\nthe teeth biting or\n\n56\n00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.130\nthe nail biting of passwords, right?\n\n57\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.024\nSo we're gonna try to help you be able to,\nevery time you need to create a password\n\n58\n00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:34.862\nor update a password, create something\nthat's gonna work for you and be easy to\n\n59\n00:02:34.862 --> 00:02:38.610\nremember and work with, as well as meet\nthe criteria for your organization.\n\n60\n00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.575\n&gt;&gt; And I understand that.\n\n61\n00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:42.682\nIf I gotta meet these criteria,\nit's gonna be a pain.\n\n62\n00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:45.245\nSo if the companies know that\nI'm not gonna like that,\n\n63\n00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:46.870\nwhy do they make us do that anyway?\n\n64\n00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n65\n00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.566\nThe answer to that is security, right?\n\n66\n00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.894\nPeople are actively trying to get at data.\n\n67\n00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:56.532\nThese are the hackers,\nthe bad actors, the threat actors,\n\n68\n00:02:56.532 --> 00:02:58.872\nwhatever you want to call\nthem in the security world.\n\n69\n00:02:58.872 --> 00:03:01.432\nBasically the bad guys out there that go,\nyou know what?\n\n70\n00:03:01.432 --> 00:03:03.538\nIt'd be nice to have\nDon Pezet's user name and\n\n71\n00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:05.436\npassword to gain access into the system.\n\n72\n00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:10.338\nAnd if I get access to the system, maybe\nI can find something interesting that'd\n\n73\n00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:13.260\nbe worth either money to me or prestige.\n\n74\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.800\nSo this is the whole purpose\nof keeping that data secure.\n\n75\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.820\nWe have information inside of, regardless\nof what organization you work for,\n\n76\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.440\nthere is information in there\nthat could be valuable or\n\n77\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.730\npotentially dangerous in the hands of\nsome threat out there, some bad guy.\n\n78\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.510\nSo we wanna keep those out of their hands\nand passwords are typically that first\n\n79\n00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.552\nguard, that first gate that we run\ninto as gaining access into a system.\n\n80\n00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:39.280\nSo if they can get past that,\n\n81\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.920\nthey at least have some form of\naccess if not quite a bit of access.\n\n82\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.350\nSo we have to keep our passwords secure,\nand\n\n83\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.430\nwe have to keep them out of\nthe hands of those bad guys.\n\n84\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.100\nSo doing that means coming\nup with strong passwords.\n\n85\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.267\nYou have to worry about crackers, and\n\n86\n00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:58.871\nthat is basically like trying to work your\nway through a set of predefined words or\n\n87\n00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:03.152\npasswords that they have lists of that\nmight give you access to the system.\n\n88\n00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:06.126\nOr just what we call a brute\nforce where they just okay,\n\n89\n00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:08.721\nstart with 0, okay, 0 didn't work, 00.\n\n90\n00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:12.231\nOkay, 000 and then just go through,\nand computers do this,\n\n91\n00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:13.729\nwe don't do this, right?\n\n92\n00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:14.753\nI mean, you could.\n\n93\n00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.940\nIt wouldn't be a whole lot of fun for\nthe bad guy out there, but\n\n94\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.925\nthere are tools that they have at their\nready that will allow them to basically\n\n95\n00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:26.120\nhammer at the door and hopefully find\na weak password that allows them entrance.\n\n96\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.430\nSo this is what we have to worry about.\n\n97\n00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.194\nThis is why we need to work with\npasswords to make them secure.\n\n98\n00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:32.486\n&gt;&gt; Now, I know like physical safes.\n\n99\n00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:37.890\nLike a combination has three numbers And\nif it's one through fifty, that's a lot.\n\n100\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.410\nBut in theory, a human with enough time\non their hands could sit there and\n\n101\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.400\nturn that dial and eventually hit\nthe right number to open the safe.\n\n102\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.130\nIt's the same with passwords, right?\n\n103\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.980\nBut you said computers do it\nbecause the longer a password is,\n\n104\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.350\nthe harder it would be to to guess, right?\n\n105\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.310\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n106\n00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.750\nDon hit the nail on the head.\n\n107\n00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.826\nIf the password is short enough, a human\ncould potentially just sit there and\n\n108\n00:04:57.826 --> 00:05:02.418\nguess over and over and over again, and it\nprobably wouldn't take them too much time.\n\n109\n00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:04.152\nSo obviously a three digit password,\n\n110\n00:05:04.152 --> 00:05:06.546\nthat's not gonna take you\nmuch time to get through.\n\n111\n00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:09.764\nI think I actually did the, all the four\ndigit codes on my TV remote one time.\n\n112\n00:05:09.764 --> 00:05:13.172\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It took me about an hour to figure all\n\n113\n00:05:13.172 --> 00:05:18.210\nthe codes that actually worked,\nall right, and especially from IT.\n\n114\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.500\nSo I was able to do that in one hour and\na four digit code.\n\n115\n00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.550\nThat was a human pushing\nbuttons physically.\n\n116\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.950\nImagine what your computer can do and\nthe power and the processor behind it.\n\n117\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.966\nSo they have very,\nvery strong password crackers out there.\n\n118\n00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:33.796\nSo we have to make sure that these\npasswords are nice and strong.\n\n119\n00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:34.996\nNow we don't wanna go too crazy though.\n\n120\n00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:36.052\nright?\n\n121\n00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:37.220\nCuz I could have a 100 character password.\n\n122\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.772\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'd be super secure, right?\n\n123\n00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:40.548\nSo what's the kind of recommendation?\n\n124\n00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:41.474\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n125\n00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:42.518\nThat's a great question.\n\n126\n00:05:42.518 --> 00:05:43.558\nLet's go ahead and jump on my computer.\n\n127\n00:05:43.558 --> 00:05:45.288\nLet's look at the bad and the ugly, right?\n\n128\n00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:49.918\nSo here I've got a couple of examples of\ndifferent types of passwords you could run\n\n129\n00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:52.278\nin both links and complexities, right?\n\n130\n00:05:52.278 --> 00:05:56.899\nSo you have a seven character\npassword with one upper case letter,\n\n131\n00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.798\ntwo digits, and one special character.\n\n132\n00:05:59.798 --> 00:06:03.250\nThat's an exclamation point,\na hash tag, something like that.\n\n133\n00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.480\nSo usually, you have to hit the Shift\nto get one of these things.\n\n134\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.850\nRunning that through\nan average password cracker,\n\n135\n00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.152\nyou're gonna crack the password at\n0.24 minutes, that is not very long.\n\n136\n00:06:14.152 --> 00:06:15.816\nSo that is not a good password.\n\n137\n00:06:15.816 --> 00:06:21.080\nBut as Don suggested, the longer we make\nthat password, the more secure it becomes.\n\n138\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.098\nAnd you see that with an eight character\npassword with one upper character,\n\n139\n00:06:25.098 --> 00:06:27.816\ntwo digits, and\nit's basically the same format.\n\n140\n00:06:27.816 --> 00:06:29.318\nWe're just adding length to it.\n\n141\n00:06:29.318 --> 00:06:33.030\nThat jumps to 1.11 hours.\n\n142\n00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.320\nAll right, well,\nthat seems like a whole lot better.\n\n143\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.245\nExcept, then an hour's not very long\nin the grand scheme of things, so\n\n144\n00:06:40.245 --> 00:06:42.554\nthat's really not enough time.\n\n145\n00:06:42.554 --> 00:06:48.220\nAnd then if you move to a 10 character\npassword, same criteria, 31.17 days.\n\n146\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.676\nNow that sounds strong.\n\n147\n00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:51.484\nThat sounds like we\nare actually getting somewhere.\n\n148\n00:06:51.484 --> 00:06:52.314\nAnd you know what?\n\n149\n00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:53.436\nIt might be strong enough.\n\n150\n00:06:53.436 --> 00:06:57.566\nThat might be a strong enough password\ndepending on your environment.\n\n151\n00:06:57.566 --> 00:06:59.276\n&gt;&gt; I think I see a pattern here.\n\n152\n00:06:59.276 --> 00:07:00.781\nSo when my company asks me, and says,\n\n153\n00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:03.004\nDon, you need to change your\npassword every 30 days.\n\n154\n00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:03.964\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n155\n00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:05.706\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say, that's dumb.\n\n156\n00:07:05.706 --> 00:07:07.258\nI don't want to change\nmy password every month.\n\n157\n00:07:07.258 --> 00:07:09.882\nBut, if it takes 31.17 days, right?\n\n158\n00:07:09.882 --> 00:07:13.588\nAnd somebody starts to try to break my\npassword, well, within 31.17 days I'll\n\n159\n00:07:13.588 --> 00:07:16.634\nchange my password to something new so\nthat that protects me, right?\n\n160\n00:07:16.634 --> 00:07:19.030\nIs that the reasoning\nbehind password changes?\n\n161\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.800\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly right, so\nwhen your company says, hey,\n\n162\n00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.940\nwe need you to update your password.\n\n163\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.400\nYou get a prompt on your computer\nscreen that says update your password.\n\n164\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.610\nIt's that time.\n\n165\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.780\nPlease enter a new password.\n\n166\n00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.300\nYes, I know, it's a headache.\n\n167\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.388\nYou gotta come up with something new.\n\n168\n00:07:30.388 --> 00:07:31.956\nWe'll broach that in just a minute.\n\n169\n00:07:31.956 --> 00:07:36.838\nBut this is the reason why, because these\nmodern password crackers are very fast,\n\n170\n00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:39.780\nthey're very efficient,\nand within 31 days.\n\n171\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.284\nSo if we set the threshold for 30 days,\nwell, you should be pretty safe.\n\n172\n00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:46.816\nAnd obviously the longer you go,\nthe better that's going to be and\n\n173\n00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:50.598\nthen maybe we can bother you less\nif we make the 11 characters, well,\n\n174\n00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:52.697\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n175\n00:07:52.697 --> 00:07:55.277\nIf we make that the standard,\nit's gonna make it a whole lot harder for\n\n176\n00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:56.655\nthose password crackers to nail it.\n\n177\n00:07:56.655 --> 00:07:58.048\nAlright, now let´s talk about the ugly,\nright.\n\n178\n00:07:58.048 --> 00:08:01.690\nThat's the bad, these are bad passwords,\nten characters,\n\n179\n00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.972\nit´s skirting the line, it could be good,\nbut it might be bad, right.\n\n180\n00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:10.280\nThe ugly, just like what we got up here,\nwe got default passwords.\n\n181\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.185\nSo if you are asked to install something,\nand it´s got a username and\n\n182\n00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:18.711\npassword field that you log into it,\nmaybe some new software on your computer.\n\n183\n00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:21.441\nDo not stick with the default\nthat it comes with,\n\n184\n00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:23.383\nyou need to change that password.\n\n185\n00:08:23.383 --> 00:08:27.368\nAnybody can go to Google type in\ndefault password for x software,\n\n186\n00:08:27.368 --> 00:08:32.720\ndefault password for this router,\ndefault password for this access point.\n\n187\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.580\nAnd if you have left it the default, well\nyou basically just said, I'm gonna hang\n\n188\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.060\nthe key outside of the door, and\nanybody that wants to come in come on in.\n\n189\n00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.155\nSo that's not a good idea,\nchange default passwords.\n\n190\n00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:47.881\nThat's why I call it the ugly, because\nyou've done nothing to secure that system,\n\n191\n00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:50.493\nand you basically ask\npeople to enter into it.\n\n192\n00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:55.140\nAnd then we have words associated\nwith your person and or organization.\n\n193\n00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.714\nSo this is kind of diving into what makes\na good password, obviously this does not.\n\n194\n00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:05.021\nWe don't wanna use organizational\nterms if, we're here at ITProTV,\n\n195\n00:09:05.021 --> 00:09:07.553\nI don't wanna make my password ITProTV.\n\n196\n00:09:07.553 --> 00:09:10.093\nI don't wanna make it shows rock.\n\n197\n00:09:10.093 --> 00:09:10.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n198\n00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:16.020\nanything that has to do with what I do for\nthe company, or what the company does.\n\n199\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean you could even think of\nlike geographic things that change this,\n\n200\n00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.340\nand we're in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n201\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.986\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which is the home of the University\n\n202\n00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:23.487\nof Florida, and the Florida Gaters.\n\n203\n00:09:23.487 --> 00:09:27.863\nAnd so I can guarantee probably a third of\nthe population of this city has the word\n\n204\n00:09:27.863 --> 00:09:32.523\ngaters in their password, and it sounds\nlike an exaggeration but sadly it's true.\n\n205\n00:09:32.523 --> 00:09:35.599\nI've worked at an organization where\nI saw this, Daniel you did too,\n\n206\n00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:38.941\nwhere there were tons of employees that\nwould just use various combinations\n\n207\n00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:40.940\nof the word gaters in their password.\n\n208\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.580\nAnd so\nif you knew that somebody was from here,\n\n209\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.280\nthat kinda would be your starting point,\nand shrink the amount of passwords you had\n\n210\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.550\nto try before you could guess\nsomebody's password and get in.\n\n211\n00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.810\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's exactly right.\n\n212\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.714\nSo your IT people might make\nthat part of the policy,\n\n213\n00:09:52.714 --> 00:09:56.611\nwhere you can't use specific words\nbecause they realize that right,\n\n214\n00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:59.602\nthey're trying help you out,\nmake a good password.\n\n215\n00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:01.913\nAnd that can lend to\nsome of that frustration,\n\n216\n00:10:01.913 --> 00:10:04.354\nyou're like I just want to use gators123.\n\n217\n00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:07.993\nYeah, that's easy to remember,\nbut length is not great, and\n\n218\n00:10:07.993 --> 00:10:11.645\nit is too close to something that\nsomebody could easily guess.\n\n219\n00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:17.040\nWe wanna keep that guessing ability out of\nthe picture as much as humanly possible.\n\n220\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.621\nSo those are the bad and the ugly,\nlet's finally jump into the good.\n\n221\n00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:26.272\nOkay, well we've seen bad stuff,\nwhat does a good password look like?\n\n222\n00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:29.112\nWell, let's take a look,\nif you jump to my screen you'll see here\n\n223\n00:10:29.112 --> 00:10:31.360\npasswords that aren't easily guessed or\ncracked.\n\n224\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.428\nThat's basically what it comes down,\nthe opposite of what we just saw.\n\n225\n00:10:34.428 --> 00:10:35.477\nI know that seems a little facetious, but.\n\n226\n00:10:35.477 --> 00:10:36.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like to a have\n\n227\n00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.122\na little fun with the word play.\n\n228\n00:10:38.122 --> 00:10:41.755\nSo I did jump up to that 11 character\npassword, with one uppercase,\n\n229\n00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:44.234\ntwo digits and\none special character, right.\n\n230\n00:10:44.234 --> 00:10:48.926\nAnd you'll notice that the amount of time\nthat it takes to crack that password went\n\n231\n00:10:48.926 --> 00:10:51.488\nfrom, how long was it, we had-\n&gt;&gt; 31.17.\n\n232\n00:10:51.488 --> 00:10:56.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 31.71 days to 810.36 days.\n\n233\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.150\nAt this point I could let you\nhave that password for the year.\n\n234\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.120\nTwo years, four years, well not four,\nI guess we're getting up there, right.\n\n235\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.490\nBut couple of years,\nI could allow you to keep that password,\n\n236\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.230\nif that's what we made the standard.\n\n237\n00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.820\nIs it more difficult to create a password\nthat's 11 characters, it can be.\n\n238\n00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.109\nI know that not everyone's awesome,\ncreative, right.\n\n239\n00:11:14.109 --> 00:11:17.714\nI don't run around like Picasso and create\namazing paintings every day of my life,\n\n240\n00:11:17.714 --> 00:11:18.810\nI'm not that creative.\n\n241\n00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.860\nBut I do have to be creative\nwith a password to make it long,\n\n242\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.773\nand rememorable, right.\n\n243\n00:11:24.773 --> 00:11:28.609\nSomething that meets the complexity\nrequirements, and that I can remember,\n\n244\n00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:30.479\ndon't forget the remembering part.\n\n245\n00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:32.360\nBecause I've always found that, Don,\n\n246\n00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.639\nI don't know if this is\nyour experience as well.\n\n247\n00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:38.811\nThat when I get a user they call me up and\nit's something to do with their password,\n\n248\n00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:42.319\nthey typically are complaining about,\nI can't remember this, and\n\n249\n00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:44.540\nthat's where they really get upset.\n\n250\n00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah where I usually saw it was,\nlet's say you had a 30 day password change\n\n251\n00:11:47.745 --> 00:11:50.419\nwindow, so every 30 days people\nhad to change the password.\n\n252\n00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:54.431\nThey would change it, and the next day\nsupport tickets would always go up,\n\n253\n00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:58.210\nbecause people would forget their\npassword the very next day.\n\n254\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.327\nAfter they had used it for a week of two\nthey'd kind of commit it to memory and\n\n255\n00:12:01.327 --> 00:12:02.230\nnow they've got it.\n\n256\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.169\nBut if they don't have\nsome kind of mnemonic,\n\n257\n00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:07.350\nsome kind of way to remember what that\npassword is, it's easy to forget it,\n\n258\n00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.555\nespecially on the first day, which means\nyou end up have to change it again.\n\n259\n00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:13.573\nAnd you kinda repeat the cycle,\npeople get really frustrated with that.\n\n260\n00:12:13.573 --> 00:12:16.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's totally\nunderstandable, I get that myself.\n\n261\n00:12:16.827 --> 00:12:20.988\nI have been just as frustrated as anybody\nout there about having to come up with\n\n262\n00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:21.960\npasswords.\n\n263\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.730\nAnd especially, like I've talked\nabout before where you have\n\n264\n00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.910\nmultiple different vectors\nof authentication.\n\n265\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.759\nI've got this website that I log into,\nwhich we do business with, it's not our\n\n266\n00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:35.397\nsystem, but I have to log into it\nbecause we do business with them, right.\n\n267\n00:12:35.397 --> 00:12:39.710\nTheir login credential, their\nrequirements aren't the same as ours.\n\n268\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.681\nSo I have to come up with something for\nthem, then I have to come,\n\n269\n00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:46.423\nand then the times that they change their\npasswords are different than ours, and\n\n270\n00:12:46.423 --> 00:12:49.470\nnow I'm constantly changing and\ntrying to remember passwords.\n\n271\n00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.800\nSo that's where we come in,\nhow do we make a good password?\n\n272\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.100\nA, length, length is great, we want to\nmake them all as long as we can remember.\n\n273\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.420\nBut how do we remember that long password,\nright.\n\n274\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.470\nThat's the rub.\n\n275\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.035\nWhat do we do?\n\n276\n00:13:04.035 --> 00:13:07.260\nWell we use phrases instead of words.\n\n277\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.400\nWords can be easily forgotten, or they're\ntoo short, that's typically the problem,\n\n278\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.506\nthey're just too short.\n\n279\n00:13:12.506 --> 00:13:16.390\nSo what we do, we make a phrase,\nsomething that I can easily remember.\n\n280\n00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.090\nI don't know about you Don, but I can\nremember the preamble to the Constitution,\n\n281\n00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.290\nwe the people of the United States,\nright, and so on and so forth.\n\n282\n00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.400\nThat's something that we learned,\nthat's buried into our brains.\n\n283\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.130\nMaybe the Pledge of Allegiance,\nsomething you do on regular basis.\n\n284\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.849\nThe opening to Star Trek or.\n\n285\n00:13:30.849 --> 00:13:33.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Any set of words, or a phrase that is\n\n286\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.960\ngoing to spark your memory,\nmaybe you have a favorite lyric to a song.\n\n287\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.576\nThese are great passwords, why?\n\n288\n00:13:40.576 --> 00:13:44.235\nBecause they can be long, and\nthey're easy to remember.\n\n289\n00:13:44.235 --> 00:13:49.132\nSo that gives us our length, and our\nmnemonic to make them easy to remember,\n\n290\n00:13:49.132 --> 00:13:51.211\nthat's the big important one.\n\n291\n00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:55.048\nIf you look at my screen really quickly\nyou'll see that Wethepeopleofthe, and\n\n292\n00:13:55.048 --> 00:13:57.909\nI put a 01, and then the US and\nthen an exclamation point,\n\n293\n00:13:57.909 --> 00:14:00.650\nthat meets all my complexity requirements.\n\n294\n00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.820\nI see that I have a capital W, right,\nthere's one complexity requirement.\n\n295\n00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.220\nI have plenty of length when\nit comes to this password.\n\n296\n00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.513\nWe also have 2 digits, 0 and 1.\n\n297\n00:14:11.513 --> 00:14:15.870\nAnd then I have an exclamation point at\nthe end, which is my special character.\n\n298\n00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:20.917\nThis is a great password to remember,\nI'll never forget this, it'll always be\n\n299\n00:14:20.917 --> 00:14:25.834\nstuck in my head, and I can fiddle with\nthis the next time I change my password.\n\n300\n00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:32.310\nMaybe change the 01, to 10, maybe\nchange it to 20, maybe change it to 90,\n\n301\n00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.857\nor 99, or any other combination\nof numbers that I want.\n\n302\n00:14:36.857 --> 00:14:41.521\nI can make it 001,\nI can always add more numbers if I like,\n\n303\n00:14:41.521 --> 00:14:46.931\nI don't have to stick with 2,\nI just have to have at least 2, right.\n\n304\n00:14:46.931 --> 00:14:49.041\nSo that is just good security.\n\n305\n00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:53.960\nNow if you are not required to add any of\nthe capitalization, special characters,\n\n306\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.837\nor numbers, that's okay,\nlength really helps out with those.\n\n307\n00:14:57.837 --> 00:15:00.634\nShort passwords when it comes to that,\nthose aren't going to be very good at all,\n\n308\n00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:02.380\nthey're going to be very easy to crack.\n\n309\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.368\nThe complexity helps when it comes to the,\n\n310\n00:15:05.368 --> 00:15:09.850\nwhat we call a dictionary type,\nI've got a list of words.\n\n311\n00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.612\nIf I were to use just, we the people\nof the United States, or the US,\n\n312\n00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:15.858\nthat might actually be in a dictionary.\n\n313\n00:15:15.858 --> 00:15:19.747\nSomebody might have a file that has\nsomething like that inside of it.\n\n314\n00:15:19.747 --> 00:15:24.541\nAnd that's what they call a dictionary,\nits just a file full of common phrases and\n\n315\n00:15:24.541 --> 00:15:26.706\nwords that people use as passwords.\n\n316\n00:15:26.706 --> 00:15:29.586\nSo we don't want to be inside\nof one of those files, but\n\n317\n00:15:29.586 --> 00:15:33.799\nwe might want to use stuff that would be\nin there, but we've gotta change it up.\n\n318\n00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:36.928\nSo we break it up, I put 01 before,\nI don't put it at the end,\n\n319\n00:15:36.928 --> 00:15:40.487\nI don't put it at the beginning,\nput in the middle somewhere, right.\n\n320\n00:15:40.487 --> 00:15:42.622\nCuz that keeps that from\nbeing a dictionary word.\n\n321\n00:15:42.622 --> 00:15:44.721\nIt's no longer a word to the computer.\n\n322\n00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:48.570\nIt's a word to us, and that works out\ngreat because I can remember that word,\n\n323\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.081\nbut the computer is just, this is\njust a string of a weird characters.\n\n324\n00:15:52.081 --> 00:15:55.392\nAnd now my dictionary's not\ngonna have that in there.\n\n325\n00:15:55.392 --> 00:15:59.398\nI'm gonna have to resort to that\nbrute force that, okay, let's try 0.\n\n326\n00:15:59.398 --> 00:16:04.942\nLet's try 00, let's try 000, A,\nAB, ABC, and so on, and so forth.\n\n327\n00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:09.927\nAnd we've seen the amount of time that\na password of this length would take.\n\n328\n00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:14.139\nAnd as we're looking at the actual time it\nwould take to maybe crack that password,\n\n329\n00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:17.528\nI don't know, Don,\nyou think that's a pretty secure password?\n\n330\n00:16:17.528 --> 00:16:21.136\n&gt;&gt; I thing 300 Trillion Years\nis probably fine.\n\n331\n00:16:21.136 --> 00:16:22.214\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n332\n00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:22.861\nwe could even make it more if we wanted.\n\n333\n00:16:22.861 --> 00:16:26.149\nBecause you mentioned weird characters,\nright?\n\n334\n00:16:26.149 --> 00:16:28.067\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You've got the exclamation point there.\n\n335\n00:16:28.067 --> 00:16:30.302\nYou could go ahead and\nput the spaces between the words, right?\n\n336\n00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:30.975\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n337\n00:16:30.975 --> 00:16:33.102\n&gt;&gt; And if you did that here,\nwhat we looking at, what, six more spaces?\n\n338\n00:16:33.102 --> 00:16:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n339\n00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.342\n&gt;&gt; That means your password\nwould be that much stronger.\n\n340\n00:16:36.342 --> 00:16:39.120\nI mean, you could really crank this one up\nwithout having to jump through a bunch of\n\n341\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.423\nextra hoops to be able to remember it.\n\n342\n00:16:40.423 --> 00:16:44.961\nSo the key secret here is using\na pass phrase, not a password.\n\n343\n00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:46.685\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, you hit the nail on the head.\n\n344\n00:16:46.685 --> 00:16:50.382\nEasy to remember, meets complexity and\nlength requirements for strength.\n\n345\n00:16:50.382 --> 00:16:52.130\nAnd that's what we're looking for.\n\n346\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.904\nAnd like Don said, if you have a hard\ntime typing that out without hitting\n\n347\n00:16:54.904 --> 00:16:57.742\nthe spacebar, I know, it did take\na little getting used to, for myself.\n\n348\n00:16:57.742 --> 00:17:00.960\nThat's fine, add the spaces.\n\n349\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.033\nThat way you're just typing it\nlike you normally would type.\n\n350\n00:17:03.033 --> 00:17:06.730\nYou're just typing a phrase out,\neasy to remember, I like this.\n\n351\n00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.460\nNow there's another way to create\na really strong password using length and\n\n352\n00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.970\ncomplexity requirements.\n\n353\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.700\nAnd that is to take the phrase, and\n\n354\n00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.440\njust take the first letter\nof each word in the phrase.\n\n355\n00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.780\nAgain, an easy mnemonic to remember,\nI used Little Miss Muffet as an example.\n\n356\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.426\nI don't know why that jumped into my\nhead when I was creating an example for\n\n357\n00:17:25.426 --> 00:17:26.118\nthis, but it did.\n\n358\n00:17:26.118 --> 00:17:29.964\nAnd then I have, little miss muffet sat\non her tuffet eating her curds and whey.\n\n359\n00:17:29.964 --> 00:17:32.896\n&gt;&gt; I think this says something\nabout your personal character.\n\n360\n00:17:32.896 --> 00:17:35.367\nI think we might need\nto look into this one.\n\n361\n00:17:35.367 --> 00:17:35.867\n&gt;&gt; Don't judge me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:17:35.867 --> 00:17:37.929\n&gt;&gt; Don't judge me cuz I don't like where\n\n363\n00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:39.729\nhe's going right now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:17:39.729 --> 00:17:42.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But it's a nursery rhyme, so\n\n365\n00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.289\npick something like that.\nAnd you just take that first character out\n\n366\n00:17:46.289 --> 00:17:47.254\nof each one.\nAnd\n\n367\n00:17:47.254 --> 00:17:51.131\nthat is going to make up your password.\nRight above it, you'll see I have a hash\n\n368\n00:17:51.131 --> 00:17:55.152\nsymbol, or a pound symbol, whatever\nyou like to call it, that starts mine.\n\n369\n00:17:55.152 --> 00:17:56.916\nInstead of putting it at the end,\n\n370\n00:17:56.916 --> 00:17:59.322\nI put it at the beginning this time.\nI could've put it in the middle,\n\n371\n00:17:59.322 --> 00:18:03.123\nI could put it anywhere I like.\nAnd then, little miss muffet sat on her\n\n372\n00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:07.544\ntuffet eating her curds and whey.\nAnd I could even remember that,\n\n373\n00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:08.556\nlmmsohtehcaw.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:18:08.556 --> 00:18:10.785\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I'll remember it that way after\n\n375\n00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:14.196\na few hundred times of typing it in.\n&gt;&gt; But I'll never forget\n\n376\n00:18:14.196 --> 00:18:18.911\nthe Llittle Miss Muffet nursery rhyme.\nAnd then I add my numerical complexity,\n\n377\n00:18:18.911 --> 00:18:22.593\nif I like, or if that's required\nof me by our administration.\n\n378\n00:18:22.593 --> 00:18:23.654\nNot a problem, and\n\n379\n00:18:23.654 --> 00:18:26.870\nthere you go, I put 001 at the end.\nThis is not as long\n\n380\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.744\nas the We the people one.\nAnd so unfortunately,\n\n381\n00:18:29.744 --> 00:18:33.976\nI only got 10 million years out of that.\nAnd man, I should probably think about\n\n382\n00:18:33.976 --> 00:18:37.011\nstrength increasing on that.\nBut again, easy to remember,\n\n383\n00:18:37.011 --> 00:18:40.478\nmeets the complexity requirements.\n&gt;&gt; And speaking of the time on these.\n\n384\n00:18:40.478 --> 00:18:41.835\nWe might look at it and say,\n\n385\n00:18:41.835 --> 00:18:44.939\n10 million years, that's forever, right?\nBut each year,\n\n386\n00:18:44.939 --> 00:18:48.564\ncomputers get faster and faster.\nAnd that means the people that are running\n\n387\n00:18:48.564 --> 00:18:52.738\npassword cracking utilities or the brute\nforcing utilities, they get faster and\n\n388\n00:18:52.738 --> 00:18:55.235\nfaster.\nSo today, it might be 10 million years.\n\n389\n00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:57.126\nBut a year from now it might only be one\n\n390\n00:18:57.126 --> 00:18:59.011\nmillion.\nAnd then it keeps going down, and down,\n\n391\n00:18:59.011 --> 00:18:59.820\nand down.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n392\n00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.108\n&gt;&gt; So as the years go by,\n\n393\n00:19:01.108 --> 00:19:05.205\npasswords get increasingly weaker.\nBut the reality is that the biggest\n\n394\n00:19:05.205 --> 00:19:09.486\nweakness of a password is not so much the\nbrute force side of it, it's ourselves,\n\n395\n00:19:09.486 --> 00:19:12.198\nright, Daniel?\nLike we can weaken password security\n\n396\n00:19:12.198 --> 00:19:15.218\npretty easily.\n&gt;&gt; Man, there is apparently no patch for\n\n397\n00:19:15.218 --> 00:19:18.441\nour humanity.\nAnd that is that if Don and I were working\n\n398\n00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:22.382\ntogether, this is a prime example.\nDon is hitting the nail right on the head,\n\n399\n00:19:22.382 --> 00:19:24.399\nagain, that we tend to\ngive our passwords out.\n\n400\n00:19:24.399 --> 00:19:27.180\nThis is a bad practice, this is a no.\n\n401\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.545\nWarning, warning, warning, Will Robinson,\n\n402\n00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:32.077\ndo not do this.\nDo not give out your password.\n\n403\n00:19:32.077 --> 00:19:33.793\nNo administrator is going to call,\n\n404\n00:19:33.793 --> 00:19:37.700\nworth their salt, and say, I need your\npassword to log into such and such.\n\n405\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.577\nHe's an admin, he has rights to every\nsystem that you have in your company,\n\n406\n00:19:41.577 --> 00:19:43.830\nyour organization, wherever you're at.\n\n407\n00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.748\nAnd he doesn't need yours.\n\n408\n00:19:44.748 --> 00:19:48.885\nAnd in fact, I could change your\npassword and log in as you, if I felt so\n\n409\n00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:51.040\ninclined, as an administrator.\n\n410\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.020\nI can't think of many reasons\nwhy that would come about.\n\n411\n00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.180\nBut almost invariably, if not invariably,\nthey will not ask for your password.\n\n412\n00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.276\nThey won't have you write it down and\ngive it to them.\n\n413\n00:20:02.276 --> 00:20:05.790\nSo you don't need to give\nyour password out to anyone.\n\n414\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:12.431\n&gt;&gt; And going even a step further, let's\nsay I give mine to an IT rep that calls.\n\n415\n00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:15.128\nOr even a family member, or\na co-worker, or whatever.\n\n416\n00:20:15.128 --> 00:20:19.464\nAnd so I give it to her, and\nit's the Little Miss Muffet 001.\n\n417\n00:20:19.464 --> 00:20:21.986\nAnd I think to myself, well,\nwhen she's done with it,\n\n418\n00:20:21.986 --> 00:20:24.146\nI'll just change it to make it 002, right?\n\n419\n00:20:24.146 --> 00:20:26.225\nBut now she knows the pattern.\n\n420\n00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:31.048\nShe sees like, Don uses Little Miss Muffet\n001, I bet he's going 002.\n\n421\n00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:32.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever, it, again,\n\n422\n00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.198\nminimizes the guessing pool she had to\ngo through to figure out that password.\n\n423\n00:20:36.198 --> 00:20:39.001\nSo you gotta keep that in\nmind with these passwords.\n\n424\n00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:40.704\nThat they're designed to be just for you.\n\n425\n00:20:40.704 --> 00:20:45.306\nAnd if you do give it to somebody else for\nsome particular reason.\n\n426\n00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:46.044\nHopefully, that doesn't happen,\nbut if you do.\n\n427\n00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:48.623\nYou not only need to change\nyour password afterwards,\n\n428\n00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:51.382\nyou need to change it to\nsomething completely different.\n\n429\n00:20:51.382 --> 00:20:55.237\nBecause otherwise, you've already weakened\nthe integrity by giving out a part of it.\n\n430\n00:20:55.237 --> 00:20:58.049\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you set a precedence of,\nwell, they use nursery rhymes.\n\n431\n00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:00.936\nMaybe I'll just go through\na book of nursery rhymes and\n\n432\n00:21:00.936 --> 00:21:02.710\ntry the same thing until I hit it.\n\n433\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.009\nMaybe I can create a computer\nprogram that does that for me.\n\n434\n00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:07.585\nHint, hint, that exists, okay?\n\n435\n00:21:07.585 --> 00:21:08.134\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n436\n00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:11.880\nwe don't want to be giving our passwords,\ndon't share them with anyone.\n\n437\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.122\nAlso, this has been a common practice for\nquite some time.\n\n438\n00:21:14.122 --> 00:21:17.612\nEven though it's become a bit of\na joke inside of the IT industry,\n\n439\n00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:19.967\nis that people write their passwords down.\n\n440\n00:21:19.967 --> 00:21:22.131\nAnd what do they do with it?\n\n441\n00:21:22.131 --> 00:21:24.455\nThey put it on a sticky note,\nand they put it on their monitor.\n\n442\n00:21:24.455 --> 00:21:27.111\nIf they think they're really slick,\nthey stick it underneath their keyboard.\n\n443\n00:21:27.111 --> 00:21:30.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they just, flip it up,\n\n444\n00:21:30.082 --> 00:21:31.764\nthere's my password.\n\n445\n00:21:31.764 --> 00:21:34.130\nNow you might be going, I do that,\nwell, a lot of people do.\n\n446\n00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.961\nSo we wanna get you away\nfrom that practice.\n\n447\n00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:38.950\nAnd there's a good reason for\nthat, obviously.\n\n448\n00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.380\nThen we could just look up and\ncheck it out.\n\n449\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.169\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Daniel and I,\n\n450\n00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.060\nwe used to work together at\nan insurance company years ago.\n\n451\n00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.706\nAnd you'd go in the field\nto some of the offices.\n\n452\n00:21:46.706 --> 00:21:49.547\nAnd if the person wasn't there\nwho was working on the computer,\n\n453\n00:21:49.547 --> 00:21:52.027\nit was just our general practice to say,\nyou know what?\n\n454\n00:21:52.027 --> 00:21:53.022\nLet me look under the keyboard.\n\n455\n00:21:53.022 --> 00:21:54.950\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Or let me ask their secretary,\n\n456\n00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.500\nlet me check some of the other employees.\n\n457\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.736\nSomebody'll know the password if\nit's not stuck on the monitor.\n\n458\n00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:04.336\nAnd we joke about it, but it was so\ncommon you could almost count on it!\n\n459\n00:22:04.336 --> 00:22:06.787\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That everybody in the office knew their\n\n460\n00:22:06.787 --> 00:22:11.525\npassword, or it was written somewhere\neasy to find, it was almost comical.\n\n461\n00:22:11.525 --> 00:22:16.022\nAnd the thing here is you may not mind if\nyou share your password with a coworker.\n\n462\n00:22:16.022 --> 00:22:17.062\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n463\n00:22:17.062 --> 00:22:19.306\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's a part of your normal\nworkflow that you'd do that.\n\n464\n00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:21.550\nBut if it's in an area of open display,\n\n465\n00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.240\nsomebody could be coming in to\nclean the office after hours.\n\n466\n00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.140\nYou could have customers that are in\nthe office that see the password.\n\n467\n00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.531\nAnd now they know it, now it's leaked out.\n\n468\n00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:30.517\nAnd that's why it's so\n\n469\n00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:33.442\nimportant to remember that passwords\nare designed to be kept secret.\n\n470\n00:22:33.442 --> 00:22:36.557\nThat we don't share them, and\nthat we keep them committed to memory.\n\n471\n00:22:36.557 --> 00:22:39.710\nSo like Daniel, your techniques of making\nit easy to remember these passphrases,\n\n472\n00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.163\nthat really helps with that, right?\n\n473\n00:22:41.163 --> 00:22:44.421\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly right, that way\nyou don't need to write them down.\n\n474\n00:22:44.421 --> 00:22:47.106\nIt's something you'll easily remember.\n\n475\n00:22:47.106 --> 00:22:50.356\nAnd therefore,\nit just keeps you out of those weeds,\n\n476\n00:22:50.356 --> 00:22:53.067\nout of putting them on a sticky note.\n\n477\n00:22:53.067 --> 00:22:56.482\nWatch the old 1980-something\nmovie WarGames.\n\n478\n00:22:56.482 --> 00:22:58.477\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As he sits down in his\n\n479\n00:22:58.477 --> 00:23:01.707\nprincipal's office, and\nhe sees the secretary pull a sheet down.\n\n480\n00:23:01.707 --> 00:23:04.220\nAnd there's the passwords, and\nthey're all scratched out.\n\n481\n00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.657\nAnd only the current one is available,\nwe don't wanna get into that business.\n\n482\n00:23:08.657 --> 00:23:11.514\n&gt;&gt; Now back then,\nwe typically only used one system.\n\n483\n00:23:11.514 --> 00:23:14.471\nAnd you'd log into a mainframe,\nyou had this one password.\n\n484\n00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:17.721\nBut in today's world,\nyou've got people that have email.\n\n485\n00:23:17.721 --> 00:23:19.972\nThey have network servers,\nthey have Facebook.\n\n486\n00:23:19.972 --> 00:23:22.271\nThey have all these different accounts.\n\n487\n00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:23.976\nThat is a lot of passwords to remember.\n\n488\n00:23:23.976 --> 00:23:25.969\nSo doesn't that encourage us\nto write them down on paper?\n\n489\n00:23:25.969 --> 00:23:29.624\n&gt;&gt; It does actually,\nDon is very right on this.\n\n490\n00:23:29.624 --> 00:23:32.372\nBecause we have so many different\nplaces that we're logging into,\n\n491\n00:23:32.372 --> 00:23:33.777\nmakes it really difficult for us.\n\n492\n00:23:33.777 --> 00:23:36.861\nEven if we create a really\nstrong password, well,\n\n493\n00:23:36.861 --> 00:23:40.242\nmaybe I can't use that\npassword at this login, right?\n\n494\n00:23:40.242 --> 00:23:43.259\nMaybe I can't use that\npassword over in this login.\n\n495\n00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:46.058\nSo we end up having this\nmultitude of different passwords.\n\n496\n00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:48.412\nNow we have a really good way of creating\nstrong passwords, That we can use, but\n\n497\n00:23:48.412 --> 00:23:50.026\nthey'll still be different.\n\n498\n00:23:50.026 --> 00:23:56.670\nWhich password did I use for this login?\n\n499\n00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:57.190\nI don't remember.\n\n500\n00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.060\nI'll just try them all.\n\n501\n00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.510\nWell maybe you've got seven or eight\ndifferent passwords that you want to rifle\n\n502\n00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.730\nthrough, and\nmaybe that hits a lockout threshold.\n\n503\n00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.200\nYou've tried the login too many times,\nand now your account is locked out.\n\n504\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.960\nAnd that's well,\nman the anxiety starts coming.\n\n505\n00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.580\nI know when I've typed in about three or\nfour passwords, and they are not the right\n\n506\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.390\none I'm starting to go I wonder if I'm\nabout to get locked out of this system.\n\n507\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.330\nAnd you just, you get anxious about it.\n\n508\n00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.460\nYou don't want to do that because then\nyou've got to call the help desk, and\n\n509\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.020\nsay help me unlock this thing.\n\n510\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.450\nSo we have to come up with some\nsystem that will help us with that.\n\n511\n00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.600\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nI know how to solve the problem.\n\n512\n00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.150\nI can come up with one strong password,\nuse that same password everywhere, right?\n\n513\n00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.030\n&gt;&gt; That would be nice, but\nunfortunately that's just not practical.\n\n514\n00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.970\nMaybe that will work,\nyou might be able to get away with that.\n\n515\n00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.179\nI have done a pretty good\njob in my own life of,\n\n516\n00:24:44.179 --> 00:24:47.392\nI think I have three\npasswords that I can use.\n\n517\n00:24:47.392 --> 00:24:49.826\nIf it's not this one, it's this one.\n\n518\n00:24:49.826 --> 00:24:50.902\nIf it's not that one,\nit's this one, right.\n\n519\n00:24:50.902 --> 00:24:55.875\nAnd those have worked just about\nanywhere I want to log in from email to\n\n520\n00:24:55.875 --> 00:25:01.391\nsystems that I work with to creating\nlogins for whatever purposes, right.\n\n521\n00:25:01.391 --> 00:25:04.232\nSo I've kind of boiled\nit down to about three.\n\n522\n00:25:04.232 --> 00:25:07.840\nBut not everyone wants to go\nthrough that kind of headache, so\n\n523\n00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.650\nwe've come up with what's\ncalled password managers.\n\n524\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.720\nAnd these are freely available, and\nmaybe your company will implement them or\n\n525\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.520\nmaybe they have already.\n\n526\n00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.670\nYou just need to be aware of them so\nthat you can use them.\n\n527\n00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of software out\nthere like Last Pass, and Key Pass,\n\n528\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.552\nEnd Pass, pass in the name.\n\n529\n00:25:22.552 --> 00:25:23.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n530\n00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.140\n&gt;&gt; That help you managing passwords and\n\n531\n00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:31.110\nthe key secret that they have is that they\nallow you to use a different password for\n\n532\n00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.970\nevery single system that you touch.\n\n533\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.810\nNormally that would be a nightmare, right?\n\n534\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.890\nAnd if I log into 100 sites,\nI have 100 different passwords,\n\n535\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.240\nthere's no way I can remember that.\n\n536\n00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.500\nI'm gonna write it down.\n\n537\n00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.980\nWell, these programs allow\nus to write it down,\n\n538\n00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.120\nin an encrypted database that\nis protected, that we can call.\n\n539\n00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.860\nAnd it actually improves our security.\n\n540\n00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.399\nBecause when you reuse a password\nin more than one place,\n\n541\n00:25:50.399 --> 00:25:55.045\nyou're trusting that all of those sites\nare securing your data the same way\n\n542\n00:25:55.045 --> 00:25:59.639\nwhen in reality you're gonna get\nthe weakest security out of all of them.\n\n543\n00:25:59.639 --> 00:26:01.391\nSo, your Facebook password\nis probably pretty secure.\n\n544\n00:26:01.391 --> 00:26:04.558\nThey're one of the most\nsecure networks in the world.\n\n545\n00:26:04.558 --> 00:26:07.082\nYour Apple password is pretty secure but\nthen,\n\n546\n00:26:07.082 --> 00:26:11.183\nmaybe you log in to some forum or some\nsites to find out a little information and\n\n547\n00:26:11.183 --> 00:26:13.240\nused the same password there.\n\n548\n00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.920\nAnd their security is not up to snuff.\n\n549\n00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.930\nMaybe their site is run by just one\nperson with a very limited budget.\n\n550\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.940\nAnd if that site ever gets compromised and\nthe one password that you use\n\n551\n00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:26.550\neverywhere just got obtained,\nnow they can log into Apple or\n\n552\n00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.690\nFacebook because they've got the one\npassword you use everywhere.\n\n553\n00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:33.090\nSo, you're better off using a different\npassword everywhere if you can.\n\n554\n00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.860\nBut it's too much for our human\nminds to wrap around, at least for\n\n555\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.535\nmost of us, some of you are savants and\nyou remember these.\n\n556\n00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:41.450\n[LAUGH] And so that's where these\npassword managers come in really handy,\n\n557\n00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:46.600\nis that ability to have a secure\ndatabase of passwords you can call up.\n\n558\n00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.380\nAnd you can use really complex,\n\n559\n00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.100\nreally long passwords that\nyou would never remember.\n\n560\n00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.610\nAnd different ones for every single site,\n\n561\n00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.770\nbut it's okay because it can all be\npulled right from this database.\n\n562\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.760\nSo definitely a technology you'll want to\nlook into if your company already hasn't.\n\n563\n00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\nI fully agree with you on that.\n\n564\n00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.540\nWell, around here, we like the LastPass.\n\n565\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.410\nWe work with that.\n\n566\n00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.570\nIt's very simple to install and use, so\n\n567\n00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.920\nthere's no good reason not to go ahead and\nuse something like that.\n\n568\n00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.673\nI love how it can create complex passwords\nfor you and then it stores them.\n\n569\n00:27:14.673 --> 00:27:16.736\nYou don't have to do anything about it.\n\n570\n00:27:16.736 --> 00:27:19.250\nYou just have that one\npassword to log into that.\n\n571\n00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.021\nAnd then Last Pass takes care\nof the rest of it for you.\n\n572\n00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:23.052\nAll right, very good.\n\n573\n00:27:23.052 --> 00:27:24.483\nNow let's talk about some,\njust some best practices.\n\n574\n00:27:24.483 --> 00:27:30.350\nMaybe you're wondering what happens if you\ndo try the wrong password too many times.\n\n575\n00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.878\nOr why is it that it has me\nuse a different password.\n\n576\n00:27:32.878 --> 00:27:36.520\nHow come I can't use the password I\nused last time, things of that nature.\n\n577\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.480\nThese are best practices that maybe you're\nin charge of a system that requires\n\n578\n00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.040\nthat kind of thing to occur, or\n\n579\n00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.040\nyou're just wondering what\nhappens when this does occur.\n\n580\n00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.584\nSo let's just talk about that.\n\n581\n00:27:46.584 --> 00:27:48.437\nReally quickly, we talked about this.\n\n582\n00:27:48.437 --> 00:27:50.320\nhow many attempts do we get.\n\n583\n00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.450\nWell, that varies by organization and it's\njust kind of a feel thing as I've noticed.\n\n584\n00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.570\nMaybe it's six tries and\nthen you get locked out.\n\n585\n00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.470\nMaybe it's ten tries and\nyou get locked out.\n\n586\n00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.522\nBut you do need to come up\nwith some Lockout policy.\n\n587\n00:28:03.522 --> 00:28:07.782\nYou get X amount of tries before\nthe system is locked that user out and\n\n588\n00:28:07.782 --> 00:28:12.043\nthat stops those bad guys out there\nfrom just knocking at the gate and\n\n589\n00:28:12.043 --> 00:28:13.858\ntrying to get into the door.\n\n590\n00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:15.494\nSo, that helps that.\n\n591\n00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:18.359\nIt'll put a pause on that and\nraise a flag up to the people or\n\n592\n00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:21.693\nthe powers that be that are watching\nover these things to say, hum,\n\n593\n00:28:21.693 --> 00:28:24.060\nlooks like we might have\na bad guy going on here.\n\n594\n00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.183\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and on your diagram earlier,\nyou said that if I had a seven\n\n595\n00:28:27.183 --> 00:28:30.685\ncharacter password it could be\nbroken in 0.24 minutes, right?\n\n596\n00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:31.895\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Really, really fast.\n\n597\n00:28:31.895 --> 00:28:36.228\nBut that's assuming that we have unlimited\nguesses and we can just rapidly guess.\n\n598\n00:28:36.228 --> 00:28:40.500\nSo, by having a password lockout, if your\nIT department says you get five tries then\n\n599\n00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.960\nyou're locked and then you have to call\ntech support and get unlocked, right?\n\n600\n00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.490\nThat will make it one attacker\nonly getting five guesses.\n\n601\n00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.770\nWhat are the odds of getting your password\nin only five guesses, extremely low.\n\n602\n00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.371\nSo password lock out policies can be\nannoying especially if you are the one who\n\n603\n00:28:54.371 --> 00:28:55.580\nis locked out and you are in a hurry.\n\n604\n00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.328\nBut they effectively eliminate\nbrute force attacks.\n\n605\n00:28:58.328 --> 00:28:59.123\nSo really useful thing so\ndon't be frustrated If you are locked\n\n606\n00:28:59.123 --> 00:28:59.640\nout because it is a really useful thing.\n\n607\n00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.330\nSo don't be frustrated when you see a lock\nout because it's gonna stop somebody\n\n608\n00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.410\nguessing and all you have to do\nis to call the text support and\n\n609\n00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.610\nsay hey I tried to log in this morning.\n\n610\n00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:08.540\nI got it wrong a few times.\n\n611\n00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.390\nI got locked.\n\n612\n00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.500\nOr you can say, hey,\nI came in this morning and I'm locked out.\n\n613\n00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.120\nI haven't tried to log in at all, and\n\n614\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.350\nthat alerts the IT department\nthat an attack happened.\n\n615\n00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.370\nThey know that something\nincorrect happened.\n\n616\n00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.460\nEither way, your data is protected, so\n\n617\n00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.840\nyou should really be thankful\nwhenever you see that limit.\n\n618\n00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.570\n&gt;&gt; And you have the added benefit of,\n\n619\n00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.980\na lot of times this will occur, that\nyou've got something on your mobile device\n\n620\n00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.020\nthat you log into the system with and\nnow you've updated your password.\n\n621\n00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.600\nWell you forgot to update it on your\nmobile device, so what is it doing?\n\n622\n00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.370\nIt's hammering away and\nhitting that lockout threshold.\n\n623\n00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.980\nThen you have to call the help desk and\n\n624\n00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:44.480\nthey go hum, looks like you might have\na mobile device that needs to be checked.\n\n625\n00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.340\nDid you update your password recently?\n\n626\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.400\nYeah, that's right.\n\n627\n00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.050\nI need to update it on my phone as well.\n\n628\n00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:53.384\nBecause I've had a lot of people go, I\nhaven't been getting email on my phone for\n\n629\n00:29:53.384 --> 00:29:54.544\nthe last three days.\n\n630\n00:29:54.544 --> 00:29:57.526\nWhen was the last time you changed your\npassword? That was like three days ago.\n\n631\n00:29:57.526 --> 00:30:00.588\nAh-ha.\nWell that can really help on that\n\n632\n00:30:00.588 --> 00:30:02.155\nside of things.\n\n633\n00:30:02.155 --> 00:30:04.072\nThe user end spectrum, so\nit's a really good thing.\n\n634\n00:30:04.072 --> 00:30:06.439\n&gt;&gt; And this can vary a bit from\ncompany to company as well, right?\n\n635\n00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:08.026\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I might get locked out and\n\n636\n00:30:08.026 --> 00:30:09.550\nhave to call the support desk.\n\n637\n00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.831\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; In order to get up.\n\n638\n00:30:10.831 --> 00:30:13.760\nOr some places make it a little\nmore automatic, don't they?\n\n639\n00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe they'll have a form that\nyou can go on to the internal site,\n\n640\n00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:20.611\nthe internal website of your company, and\nthen you can just maybe answer a security\n\n641\n00:30:20.611 --> 00:30:23.993\nquestion or something in that effect and\nit'll automatically unlock you.\n\n642\n00:30:23.993 --> 00:30:28.080\nThere's a lot of different mechanisms\nwhich they used to make it easy for\n\n643\n00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.770\nthe end user to get back in their system\nif it's legitimately, I just accidentally\n\n644\n00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:36.666\ntype my password wrong a few times and\nI need to get back in the system.\n\n645\n00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:37.921\nSo very good stuff there.\n\n646\n00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:39.970\nLet's also talk about password reuse.\n\n647\n00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.841\nHow many times should you allow\nsomeone to reuse a password.\n\n648\n00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:44.962\nI've seen 12,\n\n649\n00:30:44.962 --> 00:30:49.451\nyou have to have 12 new passwords\nbefore you can use the old password.\n\n650\n00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:53.956\nIt's gonna go hand in hand a lot with how\nlong before the password changes a lot\n\n651\n00:30:53.956 --> 00:30:54.589\nof times.\n\n652\n00:30:54.589 --> 00:30:57.854\nSo, maybe 12 is a lot.\n\n653\n00:30:57.854 --> 00:31:01.248\nYou know maybe you're changing\nyour password every 20 days and\n\n654\n00:31:01.248 --> 00:31:03.700\nall of the sudden that's not so much.\n\n655\n00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.106\nBut maybe you change your\npassword every 60 days.\n\n656\n00:31:06.106 --> 00:31:08.130\nAll of a sudden 12 is a better number for\n\n657\n00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.650\nyour end user experience,\nit's a whole lot easier.\n\n658\n00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.720\n&gt;&gt; And the idea here is to\nprotect people from guessing\n\n659\n00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.700\nbased on our patterns, right?\n\n660\n00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.103\nSo, if my old password was gator001,\nand I make it gator002.\n\n661\n00:31:17.103 --> 00:31:19.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Somebody could guess that, right?\n\n662\n00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.280\nSo, if it triggers a reuse, because\na lot of them are going to look for\n\n663\n00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.370\nhow many characters and it'll say you\ncan't read those five characters or\n\n664\n00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.590\nwhatever It, it would pick up by\nnot changing my password enough.\n\n665\n00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.500\nAnd that'll stop you.\n\n666\n00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.000\nAnd again it's just a, to help maintain\nthe security of your password.\n\n667\n00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.620\nThat's why that policy is in place.\n\n668\n00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.280\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n669\n00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.535\nAnd also it keeps you from going,\nokay well I'm gonna change my password.\n\n670\n00:31:37.535 --> 00:31:41.278\nI've got gator001, really like it,\nI'm gonna make it gator002 and\n\n671\n00:31:41.278 --> 00:31:44.682\nthen I'm gonna change my password and\ngo right back to gator001.\n\n672\n00:31:44.682 --> 00:31:48.825\nThere are mechanisms usually in place for\nthat as well, that keeps you from reusing\n\n673\n00:31:48.825 --> 00:31:51.916\nthose old passwords, so\nsomeone can't guess your pattern.\n\n674\n00:31:51.916 --> 00:31:52.931\nYou wanna stay away from that.\n\n675\n00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:56.150\nThat way, the bad guys stay out,\nthe good guys stay in.\n\n676\n00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.602\nAnd the last thing I wanna talk\nabout is the lockout period.\n\n677\n00:31:58.602 --> 00:32:01.585\nA lot of times there is a lockout period,\nif you do get locked out and\n\n678\n00:32:01.585 --> 00:32:05.103\nlet's say it's lunchtime or for whatever\nreason nobody's at the help desk or\n\n679\n00:32:05.103 --> 00:32:08.567\nit's super slammed and you're having\nto wait on the phone, typically we can\n\n680\n00:32:08.567 --> 00:32:13.025\ncreate a lockout period, maybe 15 minutes,\nmaybe 30 minutes, maybe 10 minutes.\n\n681\n00:32:13.025 --> 00:32:15.900\nOf just stopping that and\nthen after that time expires,\n\n682\n00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.092\nthe lockout will relinquished and the user\nwill be unlocked, allowing them to just\n\n683\n00:32:20.092 --> 00:32:23.380\nwait the timeout if they can't get to\nan administrator to get that to them.\n\n684\n00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.300\n&gt;&gt; And that might sound like a weakened\nsecurity but it really doesn't.\n\n685\n00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.840\nRemember if someone is brute\nforcing they're trying to throw\n\n686\n00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.560\nthousands of passwords\nper second at the system.\n\n687\n00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.319\nIf you hold them down for ten minutes, and\nthen they get another five guesses, and\n\n688\n00:32:35.319 --> 00:32:38.919\nthen another ten minutes, it slows them\ndown so much it becomes theoretically\n\n689\n00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:42.272\nimpossible for them to break a password\nin any realistic amount of time.\n\n690\n00:32:42.272 --> 00:32:46.906\nSo, it helps to alleviate some of the\nfrustration on our part as end-users if we\n\n691\n00:32:46.906 --> 00:32:48.371\nget the password wrong.\n\n692\n00:32:48.371 --> 00:32:50.090\nI know, I just need to wait ten minutes.\n\n693\n00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.888\nOr wait 30 minutes.\n\n694\n00:32:50.888 --> 00:32:52.657\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So, you'll have to check with your IT\n\n695\n00:32:52.657 --> 00:32:54.254\ndepartment to see what your duration is.\n\n696\n00:32:54.254 --> 00:32:57.124\nSome like high security\nenvironments won't have a duration.\n\n697\n00:32:57.124 --> 00:33:00.975\nThey'll say you are just locked out\nuntil you contact the help desk.\n\n698\n00:33:00.975 --> 00:33:02.188\nYou've got to initiate that procedure.\n\n699\n00:33:02.188 --> 00:33:06.572\nSo, it just depends so that lockout\nthresholds, the timers, are pretty common\n\n700\n00:33:06.572 --> 00:33:10.960\nand you see those pretty frequently just\nto help stop those brute force attacks.\n\n701\n00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.681\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n702\n00:33:11.681 --> 00:33:14.360\nWell passwords obviously\nare a very important thing.\n\n703\n00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.407\nAlso, I want to iterate the fact that, if\nyou are locked out and you don't know why,\n\n704\n00:33:18.407 --> 00:33:21.714\nyou haven't typed in your password\nincorrectly X amount of times and\n\n705\n00:33:21.714 --> 00:33:24.237\nyou're still locked out,\ncontact your helpdesk.\n\n706\n00:33:24.237 --> 00:33:28.041\nContact somebody in authority over that\nsystem, so that they are aware that has\n\n707\n00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:30.821\nhappened, maybe there is a bad\nguy knocking at the door and\n\n708\n00:33:30.821 --> 00:33:32.773\nthat will help raise that flag for them.\n\n709\n00:33:32.773 --> 00:33:34.481\nSo always be aware of that.\n\n710\n00:33:34.481 --> 00:33:37.507\nThen when it comes down\nto passwords length and\n\n711\n00:33:37.507 --> 00:33:40.073\ncomplexity is going to be your friend.\n\n712\n00:33:40.073 --> 00:33:44.002\nUse pass phrases it's gonna help\nyou out with that pneumonic device.\n\n713\n00:33:44.002 --> 00:33:47.882\nSo you can remember those lengthy\npasswords and if you can get away with it\n\n714\n00:33:47.882 --> 00:33:51.579\nby all means if you have the means,\nget yourself a password manager.\n\n715\n00:33:51.579 --> 00:33:54.160\nIt's gonna make your\nlife a whole lot easier.\n\n716\n00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.300\nDon, I think that's about all I\ngot on passwords for today though.\n\n717\n00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.630\nHopefully that helps you good folks out\nthere meet your complexity requirements,\n\n718\n00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.570\nmeet your length requirements and\nstay safe in your environment.\n\n719\n00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, well hopefully\nthat was a good description for\n\n720\n00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.590\nyou guys to explain away why we have\nsome of these really weird password\n\n721\n00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:12.150\nrequirements that can seem annoying,\nand frustrating and pointless.\n\n722\n00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.610\nBut they all actually have a reason.\n\n723\n00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:17.170\nThere's a reason they're there in place\nand we're the ones who help maintain that.\n\n724\n00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.060\nThe IT department can only do so much.\n\n725\n00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.470\nIt's up to us to make sure that we\nfollow proper password policies and\n\n726\n00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:23.640\nprocedures as well.\n\n727\n00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.210\nSo, that's a pretty good wrap-up.\n\n728\n00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.714\nDaniel, did you have any parting\nwords before we close up?\n\n729\n00:34:27.714 --> 00:34:30.127\n&gt;&gt; Just don't share your passwords please.\n\n730\n00:34:30.127 --> 00:34:31.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't write them on sticky notes.\n\n731\n00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:35.900\nI can't reiteratize that enough, because\nif you give someone your password and\n\n732\n00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.670\nthey login and\nthey do something that they shouldn't do.\n\n733\n00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.170\nAnd they're logged in as you,\n\n734\n00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.290\nthe only thing that we can,\nand they don't cop to it.\n\n735\n00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.010\nWhat are we supposed to assume?\n\n736\n00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.000\nIs that you did it.\n\n737\n00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.349\nSo don't share passwords, don't write\nthem down, keep them secure and safe,\n\n738\n00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:49.638\nuse those password managers.\n\n739\n00:34:49.638 --> 00:34:53.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, ladies and gentlemen\nthat is gonna wrap up our episode right\n\n740\n00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.725\nhere for enduser security awareness.\n\n741\n00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:56.088\nI do hope you guys enjoy it.\n\n742\n00:34:56.088 --> 00:34:57.849\nI've been your host, Don Pezet.\n\n743\n00:34:57.849 --> 00:34:58.897\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n744\n00:34:58.897 --> 00:35:02.089\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n745\n00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:07.712\n[MUSIC]\n\n746\n00:35:07.712 --> 00:35:13.920\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

--> 00:00:11.250\nIn this show we're going to talk\nabout creating strong passwords.\n\n4\n00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.000\nSo Mike, I've been told that I have to\ncreate a strong password for work and\n\n5\n00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.475\nI was thinking of using one, two,\nthree, four, five, six, how's that?\n\n6\n00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:23.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, on the scale\nof one to ten, ten being good,\n\n7\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.750\nI'd say that might be a negative two.\n\n8\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.780\n&gt;&gt; Man [LAUGH].\n\n9\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.350\n&gt;&gt; No, honestly though,\n\n10\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.210\nresearch has shown that is actually one of\nthe most popular passwords used out there.\n\n11\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.840\nIt is a very bad idea, right?\n\n12\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.630\nAnd I think most of us are aware\nof this but the idea here,\n\n13\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.100\nwe do want to talk about how\ndo I create a strong password.\n\n14\n00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.080\nAs you said, your work comes and\nsays look, our security policy says,\n\n15\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.580\nhey you've gotta use a strong password.\n\n16\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.980\nWhat do they mean by that,\nam I taking my password to the gym and\n\n17\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.890\nworking out with it?\n\n18\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.000\nMaking it extra strong?\n\n19\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.415\n&gt;&gt; Got to pump some iron.\n\n20\n00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:55.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah something like that and\n\n21\n00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.790\nthat's not exactly what they mean.\n\n22\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.080\nSo we're going to talk about what makes a\nstrong password, as well as how to create\n\n23\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.270\na strong password that satisfies the rules\nof my organization as far as strength and\n\n24\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.970\ncomplexity but\nat the same time is easy to remember.\n\n25\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.030\nBecause we can make some really complex,\n\n26\n00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.680\nlong passwords that are just\nnot easy to remember and\n\n27\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.380\nif you can't remember your password,\nthen it really doesn't do you any good.\n\n28\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.710\nIf you start writing it down and taping\nit to your monitor, things like that,\n\n29\n00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.750\nyou're really not increasing security.\n\n30\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.720\nYou're hurting security.\n\n31\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.684\nSo, what I really wanna focus on today is\nhow do I create a strong password that's\n\n32\n00:01:32.684 --> 00:01:37.430\ngonna satisfy my password requirements\nat work and is also easy to remember so\n\n33\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.423\nthat I can use it,\nI don't have to write it down,\n\n34\n00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:45.023\nI can remember what it is because in\nthe end we gotta use strong passwords and\n\n35\n00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:48.996\nwant to try to use different\npasswords at different locations.\n\n36\n00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:53.126\nSo, if I have crazy complex passwords\nthat are difficult to remember and\n\n37\n00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:57.540\nthen I've got 5, 10, 20 of those,\nit's just not gonna work, right?\n\n38\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.850\nIt's too much so let's talk about\nfirst what makes a strong password,\n\n39\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.910\nand then second we'll talk about how do\nI create one that's easy to remember.\n\n40\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great.\n\n41\n00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.250\n&gt;&gt; Sound like a plan?\n\n42\n00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.800\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\nSo where are we gonna start?\n\n43\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.480\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell let's start by talking about what\n\n44\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.440\nmakes a strong password, all right?\n\n45\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.000\nThere's really too big factors when it\ncomes to creating a strong password.\n\n46\n00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.960\nLength and complexity.\n\n47\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.508\nThe length, how long your password is.\n\n48\n00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:25.350\nIs it seven characters long?\n\n49\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.260\nIs it 8, is it 10,\nis it 24 characters long?\n\n50\n00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.930\nThe longer the password is the longer\n\n51\n00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.070\nit's gonna take somebody to try to\nbreak your password, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.670\nSo length is very important and\nthe the standard right now is about\n\n53\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.110\neight characters is what most\nsecurity organizations are saying,\n\n54\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.890\neight characters should be\nthe minimum on your password, right?\n\n55\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.820\nThe second factor that affects our\npassword strength is complexity.\n\n56\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.930\nNow complexity is one,\nit's like what do you mean by complexity?\n\n57\n00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.160\nIt's referring to the character sets that\nyou're using in your password, right?\n\n58\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.400\nNow, let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n59\n00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.320\nWhat I've done, I just wrote up a simple\nWord document to kinda explain what I mean\n\n60\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.620\nby these character sets.\n\n61\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.970\nThere's really four character sets\nthat I can use in my passwords.\n\n62\n00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.950\nI can use uppercase letters, right.\n\n63\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.480\nWe've got A through Z in our\nEnglish language anyway.\n\n64\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.223\nSo we got 26 uppercase letters\nthat I can use in my password.\n\n65\n00:03:24.223 --> 00:03:30.600\nI have 26 lowercase, that's a separate\ncharacter set, lowercase Letters.\n\n66\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.740\nWe've got numbers that we can use, there's\nonly ten of those, zero through nine and\n\n67\n00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.570\nthen we've got special characters,\nand there's about 32 of those and\n\n68\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.270\nyou can see them down towards\nthe bottom of my page there.\n\n69\n00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.260\nThings like the tilde or a parenthesis or\nan asterisk or an equal sign, all right?\n\n70\n00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.480\nThose are the special characters,\nas I said there's about 32 of those.\n\n71\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.510\nYou might or might not be able to use all\nof those special characters depending on\n\n72\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.510\nwhere you're creating this password,\nall right?\n\n73\n00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.080\nSome websites, for example,\n\n74\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.090\nthat you go to, might limit special\ncharacters because of the fact\n\n75\n00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.230\nthat some of those can be used in certain\ntypes of attacks against that website.\n\n76\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.360\nYou might have the term SQL injection and\nwe're not worried about that but\n\n77\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.520\nwhat I'm saying is that when\nyou go to create a password and\n\n78\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.970\nit says that password is not allowed,\nit could be because one of these special\n\n79\n00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.865\ncharacters is being blocked cuz they\ndon't want you to use it as an attack.\n\n80\n00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:23.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz I've seen websites that are\ncreating a password for maybe a bank or\n\n81\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.360\nsomething online and\nit gives you the requirements.\n\n82\n00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.060\nYou have to use an uppercase and\nlowercase letter.\n\n83\n00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.070\nI think, one time, I did use a special\ncharacter and it was like, no, you can't.\n\n84\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.550\nAnd I was like, why?\n\n85\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.290\nI thought that was a special character but\n\n86\n00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.600\nyou're saying that those are used\nmaliciously in some ways, so\n\n87\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.320\nthat's why they are saying no we\ndon't want you to put in there.\n\n88\n00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.450\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times the hyphens, the dashes\nare part of SQL injection attacks so\n\n89\n00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.300\nthey limit those.\n\n90\n00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.890\nSo if you run into that situation.\n\n91\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.250\nYou are not just picking special different\ncharacter or something like that.\n\n92\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.580\n&gt;&gt; SQL injections otherwise.\n\n93\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.100\nThings that are going to hurt\nyou cuz I've never heard that.\n\n94\n00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is when the bad guy\ntries to attack a website and\n\n95\n00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.970\nhe can use that password field to launch\nhis attack and so what they'll do is\n\n96\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.830\nthey'll block some of those things that\nthey know are part of those attacks, but\n\n97\n00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.960\nthat also prevents us from\nusing it in the password.\n\n98\n00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.390\nAll right, so we talk about\ncreating that strong password.\n\n99\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.070\nWe wanna use a mix of\nthese character sets.\n\n100\n00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.750\nNow let's talk about why, right.\n\n101\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.580\nPretend your password was\na single character, right.\n\n102\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.220\nYou just had a one character password and\nyou used an uppercase letter.\n\n103\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.725\nWell how many possibilities then\nare there for your password?\n\n104\n00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:30.065\n&gt;&gt; 26?\n\n105\n00:05:30.065 --> 00:05:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right?\n\n106\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's 26 letters,\n\n107\n00:05:33.535 --> 00:05:37.355\nupper case letters that I can use and if\nI only have a one character password and\n\n108\n00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:40.075\nit's an upper case letter that means\nthere's only 26 possibilities.\n\n109\n00:05:40.075 --> 00:05:41.665\nNow how long is a bad guy,\n\n110\n00:05:41.665 --> 00:05:44.037\nhow long will it take you to\nfigure out my password right?\n\n111\n00:05:44.037 --> 00:05:48.070\n&gt;&gt; 26 times [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you could guess A,\n\n112\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.570\nthen B, then C, then D, right?\n\n113\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.350\nAll the way through, take you 26 guesses.\n\n114\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.380\nProbably no more than a couple minutes and\nyou're gonna have my password.\n\n115\n00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.370\nNow let's say we've got uppercase and\nlowercase.\n\n116\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.240\nSo my password's still one character but\nI can use uppercase letters or\n\n117\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.110\nlowercase letters.\n\n118\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.130\nNow how many possibilities are there?\n\n119\n00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.170\n&gt;&gt; Now we're starting to get into math.\n\n120\n00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.670\n50.\n&gt;&gt; 52.\n\n121\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.170\n&gt;&gt; 52.\n\n122\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.673\n&gt;&gt; 52, yep.\n\n123\n00:06:11.673 --> 00:06:12.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n124\n00:06:12.176 --> 00:06:13.485\n&gt;&gt; 52, right, 26 uppercase and\n\n125\n00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:16.155\n26 lowercase.\nSo now it's going to take you longer to go\n\n126\n00:06:16.155 --> 00:06:19.585\nthrough all the possibilities, right?\nBecause now there's 52 possibilities.\n\n127\n00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:23.585\nIf I throw in numbers,\nthere's another ten possibilities.\n\n128\n00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:26.855\nSo even though my password is only one\ncharacter, now we've got 62 possibilities.\n\n129\n00:06:26.855 --> 00:06:29.325\nSo it's going to take you longer.\n\n130\n00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:34.275\nNow obviously, a single character password\nis silly but I'm using it as an example.\n\n131\n00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:37.880\nThe more characters that\nare possible in your password.\n\n132\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.914\nThe more guesses the bad guys\nare gonna have to do, therefore,\n\n133\n00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:43.676\nthe longer it's gonna take\nthem to crack that password.\n\n134\n00:06:43.676 --> 00:06:48.212\n&gt;&gt; And if you have a lot of those, then\nit's gonna take even longer and that's\n\n135\n00:06:48.212 --> 00:06:53.184\nwhat makes the strong force field for the\nbad guys to try to not penetrate through.\n\n136\n00:06:53.184 --> 00:06:57.665\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, Yvonne, you've got 32\nspecial characters, if I throw in special\n\n137\n00:06:57.665 --> 00:07:02.100\ncharacters as a possibility and,\nupper case and, lower case and, numbers.\n\n138\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.520\nWell now all of a sudden we've\ngot like 94 possibilities, right.\n\n139\n00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.140\nIt's gonna take a lot longer\nthan when there was 26.\n\n140\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.870\nNow multiply that out over eight or\n\n141\n00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.490\nnine or ten characters long and\nif you wanted to do the math you could.\n\n142\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.120\nYou could say 94 to the power\nof however many characters.\n\n143\n00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.010\nLike 94 to the seventh or 94 to the eighth\nbut who wants to do that math, right?\n\n144\n00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.410\n&gt;&gt; We'll just say a lot.\n\n145\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a lot.\n\n146\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.450\nSo that's why using a mix of characters\nmakes you password stronger is because\n\n147\n00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.100\nyou're increasing the number of\npossibilities that your password could be.\n\n148\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.020\nThe bad guy doesn't know\nwhat your password is.\n\n149\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.451\nHe is trying to guess what your password\nis or is using some tool that's automating\n\n150\n00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:44.515\nthe guessing process but it still has\nto go through all the possibilities.\n\n151\n00:07:44.515 --> 00:07:49.193\nSo the more possibilities there are,\nthe longer it's going to take him.\n\n152\n00:07:49.193 --> 00:07:53.616\nAnd if we're using all four character\nsets and we're making this password ten\n\n153\n00:07:53.616 --> 00:07:58.389\ncharacters long, all of a sudden it's\ngonna take the bad guy 100 years to crack.\n\n154\n00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:01.156\nAnd if we're changing\nour password every so\n\n155\n00:08:01.156 --> 00:08:04.913\noften, as long as you're\nchanging it before that 100.\n\n156\n00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:05.763\nYou get the idea, right?\n\n157\n00:08:05.763 --> 00:08:07.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the longer it takes,\n\n158\n00:08:07.525 --> 00:08:08.779\nthe better off we are.\n\n159\n00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:10.797\nAll right, now.\n\n160\n00:08:10.797 --> 00:08:14.190\nSo, let's talk about how we can go\nabout creating a strong password.\n\n161\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.850\nI'm gonna show you\nthe traditional way that we've\n\n162\n00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.260\nalways learned over the last few years.\n\n163\n00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.360\nOn how to create a strong password, and\nthen I'm gonna show you a really cool,\n\n164\n00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.320\neasy way to make a strong password\nthat's also very easy to remember.\n\n165\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.920\nBecause that's the key, right?\n\n166\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.716\nWe can make a really complex,\nstrong password, but\n\n167\n00:08:33.716 --> 00:08:36.746\nif I can't remember it, I can't log in.\n\n168\n00:08:36.746 --> 00:08:39.898\nOr I have to write it down and\nnow somebody can find that and\n\n169\n00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:43.820\nknows my password, so\nwe wanna try to avoid that kind of thing.\n\n170\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.870\nSo let's do this.\n\n171\n00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.870\nLet's take a look at what I've got here,\n\n172\n00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.480\nI'm gonna type out some\nstuff on my Word document.\n\n173\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.340\nAnd open up, go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen again.\n\n174\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.170\nThis is Gibson Research Corporation and\nwhat this is, it's a password,\n\n175\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.550\nit's not a strength meter,\nI do wanna be careful with that.\n\n176\n00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.170\nBut the idea is this website is gonna\nshow me about how long it would\n\n177\n00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.800\ntake to search through the number\nof possibilities, all right?\n\n178\n00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.692\nI was just saying that if we were\nonly using upper case letters,\n\n179\n00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:14.331\nthere's 26 possibilities, and\n\n180\n00:09:14.331 --> 00:09:18.580\nit would probably take me about .5 seconds\nto go through all those possibilities.\n\n181\n00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.750\nThat's what this website is gonna show me.\n\n182\n00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.720\nDepending on what you use for your\npassword, how long would it take to go\n\n183\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.330\nthrough all the possibilities and\neventually crack your password.\n\n184\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.990\nSo it gives you an idea of\nhow strong your password is.\n\n185\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.240\nBecause it's showing me how long it\nwould take the bad guys to crack it.\n\n186\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.610\nSo we're gonna use this to\nkinda see how we're going,\n\n187\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.810\nhow we're progressing from a very weak\npassword to a very strong password.\n\n188\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.850\nAgain, this is\nGibson Research Corporation,\n\n189\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.300\nfantastic folks out there\nthat make this available.\n\n190\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.802\nThere are others available out there\non the web as well that you might find.\n\n191\n00:09:50.802 --> 00:09:52.430\nAll right, so\nback over to this Word document.\n\n192\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.076\nWhat I wanna do is, let's start\nwith how about the word complex?\n\n193\n00:09:56.076 --> 00:09:58.700\nThat oughtta be a good one.\n\n194\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.710\nLet's say I wanted to use\ncomplex as my password.\n\n195\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.370\nIt's all lowercase letters.\n\n196\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.290\nAll right?\n\n197\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.806\nSo if we go back over to that\nGibson research page and\n\n198\n00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:13.725\nwe type in complex, we would see that.\n\n199\n00:10:13.725 --> 00:10:16.700\nWell, now the way this\nwebsite breaks it down,\n\n200\n00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.270\nthey're doing what's\ncalled an online attack.\n\n201\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:23.409\nAnd they're saying that if somebody,\na bad guy, was doing an online attack,\n\n202\n00:10:23.409 --> 00:10:27.819\nit might take about, they could probably\ndo about 1,000 guesses per second.\n\n203\n00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:32.200\nAnd so, it would take them\n3.19 months to crack that.\n\n204\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.080\nBut that's not the normal\nattack methodology.\n\n205\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.400\nThey're probably gonna be\ndoing an offline attack,\n\n206\n00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.820\nwhich means they can do 100\nbillion guesses per second.\n\n207\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.420\nYes, that's right,\n100 billion guesses per second.\n\n208\n00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.130\nThis is why we need many,\nmany possibilities, right?\n\n209\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.770\nCuz if there's only 26 possibilities, and\nthey're doing 100 million guesses per\n\n210\n00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.630\nsecond, they're gonna crack your password\nin less than a millisecond, right?\n\n211\n00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.950\nSo that's what we're\ntrying to determine here.\n\n212\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.040\nSo complex would not be\na very good password,\n\n213\n00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.740\nbecause it can be cracked\nin under a second.\n\n214\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.285\nWe can go through every possibility\nin less than a second, and\n\n215\n00:11:07.285 --> 00:11:09.177\nyour password has to be one\nof those possibilities.\n\n216\n00:11:09.177 --> 00:11:14.258\nSo, all right, well Mike, you told us that\nwe could use a mix of character sets.\n\n217\n00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:17.190\nLet's add to this and kinda mix it up.\n\n218\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.134\nLet's say we change that c to a capital C,\n\n219\n00:11:21.134 --> 00:11:25.323\nnow we're using upper case and lower case.\n\n220\n00:11:25.323 --> 00:11:28.937\nAnd take a look,\nit increased my time from 0.08 seconds or\n\n221\n00:11:28.937 --> 00:11:31.380\nsomewhere around there to 10 seconds.\n\n222\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.058\nNot the biggest jump in the world and\nstill not a very good password, but\n\n223\n00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:39.115\nyou can see it is progressing\nin the right direction, right?\n\n224\n00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.425\n&gt;&gt; You can definitely see the iterations.\n\n225\n00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:42.990\nI mean, even though you said it's small,\n\n226\n00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.065\nthat's a big jump in a sense with\nthat one character being changed.\n\n227\n00:11:47.065 --> 00:11:47.615\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n228\n00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:50.075\nLet's take a look at that again and\nshow you what Vonne is talking about.\n\n229\n00:11:50.075 --> 00:11:55.295\nIf we go back to all lower case,\nlook at how many possibilities there are.\n\n230\n00:11:55.295 --> 00:11:57.985\nJust over 8 million possibilities.\n\n231\n00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.310\nThat's a lot.\n\n232\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.230\nBut if your computer can do\na hundred million per second,\n\n233\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.690\nthen eight million is not that long,\nor not that many.\n\n234\n00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:12.370\nLet's go back to my capital C, and all of\na sudden, we went up to, what is that?\n\n235\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.430\nThousands, millions, billions,\none trillion possibilities.\n\n236\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.120\n&gt;&gt; Between those exponents, aren't we?\n\n237\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n238\n00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.980\n&gt;&gt; Exponentially.\n\n239\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.160\n&gt;&gt; We're getting the much bigger numbers.\n\n240\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.830\nStill not enough,\nbecause we can do 100 billion per second,\n\n241\n00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.360\na trillion is not that much.\n\n242\n00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.300\nBig number for us.\n\n243\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.594\nFor computers,\na trillion is nothing to them, right?\n\n244\n00:12:32.594 --> 00:12:34.760\nAll right, so we'll keep going.\n\n245\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.170\nWe got upper case, we got lower case.\n\n246\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.280\nLet's add in,\nwhat's our other character set, Vonne?\n\n247\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.566\n&gt;&gt; We have the special characters.\n\n248\n00:12:40.566 --> 00:12:41.830\n&gt;&gt; Special characters, all right.\n\n249\n00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.442\nLet's add a, well, before I change length,\n\n250\n00:12:46.442 --> 00:12:50.360\nlet's change the, what you wanna do?\n\n251\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.750\nLet's change the e to an @,\nor a three, right?\n\n252\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.440\nOr no, an @.\nYou said special character.\n\n253\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.280\nSo we'll put a special character in there.\n\n254\n00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.370\nNow special characters,\nthere's 32 possible characters.\n\n255\n00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.420\nSo look what that did to\nmy number of possibilities.\n\n256\n00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.630\nThe length has not changed yet, right,\nwe're still at seven characters.\n\n257\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.620\nBut the number of possibilities,\nby adding those other character sets,\n\n258\n00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.270\nhas increased dramatically,\nnow we're up to thousands.\n\n259\n00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:18.860\nMillions, billions, 32 trillion and\nmy time is up to five minutes.\n\n260\n00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.710\nStill not great but\na lot better than ten seconds, right?\n\n261\n00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.890\nWe know we're moving in\nthe right direction.\n\n262\n00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.870\n&gt;&gt; Or 0.01 seconds that we have\nwith just a regular complex.\n\n263\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:27.708\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, all right?\n\n264\n00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:29.426\nSo what else can we add to this, Vonne?\n\n265\n00:13:29.426 --> 00:13:30.297\n&gt;&gt; We could add numbers.\n\n266\n00:13:30.297 --> 00:13:32.320\n&gt;&gt; We could do numbers.\n\n267\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.558\nLet's change that o to a zero, right?\n\n268\n00:13:36.558 --> 00:13:44.410\nStill seven characters but now look, we're\nup to 70 trillion and eleven minutes.\n\n269\n00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.283\nWoohoo!\n\n270\n00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:48.272\nWe're really getting up there now, right?\n\n271\n00:13:48.272 --> 00:13:49.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n272\n00:13:49.975 --> 00:13:53.100\nwe see that complexity will get us so far.\n\n273\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.630\nBut it won't get us to\nwhere we need to be.\n\n274\n00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.930\nComplexity on its own is not enough.\n\n275\n00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:01.250\nWe still need that other factor,\nthe length portion, right?\n\n276\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.300\nLet's try adding another character.\n\n277\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.607\nSo from a set of seven,\nwe're going to eight.\n\n278\n00:14:07.607 --> 00:14:10.088\nWe're already using all four\ncharacter sets, right, but\n\n279\n00:14:10.088 --> 00:14:12.115\nnow we're gonna try making it longer.\n\n280\n00:14:12.115 --> 00:14:14.885\nLet's just add an exclamation\npoint to the end of it, right?\n\n281\n00:14:16.235 --> 00:14:18.973\nEight characters, and look what happened,\n\n282\n00:14:18.973 --> 00:14:23.526\nwe went from trillions to thousands,\nmillions, billions, trillions.\n\n283\n00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:24.327\nComes after trillions, Vonne?\n\n284\n00:14:24.327 --> 00:14:27.289\n&gt;&gt; A lot [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\n\n285\n00:14:27.289 --> 00:14:29.620\na lot of numbers up there, right?\n\n286\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.160\nWe're moving way out there and\nlook at my time.\n\n287\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.290\nWe went from, what were we at\n10 minutes or so, to 18 hours.\n\n288\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.190\nHm, now we're-\n&gt;&gt; This is really demonstrating\n\n289\n00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.300\nthe whole concept of just\nchanging just a few characters.\n\n290\n00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.530\nWith the time that it would take for\npeople to maybe crack this.\n\n291\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.960\nSo this is fascinating.\n\n292\n00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.628\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it?\nAnd\n\n293\n00:14:50.628 --> 00:14:54.971\nit's really not that difficult to\nmake a strong password, right?\n\n294\n00:14:54.971 --> 00:14:58.370\nNow, there are some caveats, and\nI'll come back to that in just a second.\n\n295\n00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.056\nLet's add one more character.\n\n296\n00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:05.064\nLet's add anothe one to the end of it.\n\n297\n00:15:05.064 --> 00:15:08.144\nGet up to nine characters now,\nlook at that number.\n\n298\n00:15:08.144 --> 00:15:10.633\nWay beyond my math skills, and\n\n299\n00:15:10.633 --> 00:15:16.393\nit's gonna 2.43 months to go\nthrough every possibility, right?\n\n300\n00:15:16.393 --> 00:15:20.863\nNow most of us in our corporate\nenvironments have a password change policy\n\n301\n00:15:20.863 --> 00:15:26.340\nthat says hey every 30 days or every 60\ndays you need to change your password.\n\n302\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.188\nSo now I'm getting to the point were\nmy password will survive longer than my\n\n303\n00:15:30.188 --> 00:15:31.421\npassword change rate.\n\n304\n00:15:31.421 --> 00:15:32.574\nI hope that make sense, right?\n\n305\n00:15:32.574 --> 00:15:35.197\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I've never have\nworked in somewhere were we,\n\n306\n00:15:35.197 --> 00:15:37.480\nI think we had to do it every two months?\n\n307\n00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.320\nEvery three months or\nsomething around that time period.\n\n308\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.040\nIt's like,\nwhy do I have to keep doing this?\n\n309\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.590\nAnd this totally to me explains why\nthey are requiring us to do that.\n\n310\n00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.754\n&gt;&gt; Because your password,\nit doesn't need to be bulletproof.\n\n311\n00:15:49.754 --> 00:15:52.546\nIt doesn't need to to be crack proof\nbecause there is no crack proof password.\n\n312\n00:15:52.546 --> 00:15:54.664\nEvery password is crackable.\n\n313\n00:15:54.664 --> 00:15:56.929\nIt's just a matter of time.\n\n314\n00:15:56.929 --> 00:15:58.364\nIs it gonna take me two months?\n\n315\n00:15:58.364 --> 00:16:00.234\nIs it gonna take me two years?\n\n316\n00:16:00.234 --> 00:16:03.324\nIf it's 15 characters,\nit might take me a million years,\n\n317\n00:16:03.324 --> 00:16:05.761\nand obviously,\nI'm not gonna live that long.\n\n318\n00:16:05.761 --> 00:16:10.366\nSo your password just needs to be strong\nenough to get through your security\n\n319\n00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:11.320\npolicy.\n\n320\n00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.530\nIf you're changing your password\nevery 60 days, if hopefully your\n\n321\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:20.910\npassword would take six months to crack,\nyou're changing it every two months.\n\n322\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.500\nSo by the time they crack it,\nit's not your password anymore, right?\n\n323\n00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.330\nSo that's what we've gotta try to do, is\njust make sure that my password is strong\n\n324\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.550\nenough to get me through my\npassword change policy, all right?\n\n325\n00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.740\nSo we're getting up there,\nwe're up to 2.43 months.\n\n326\n00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.445\nLet's just add one more character\njust to see what it does, right?\n\n327\n00:16:38.445 --> 00:16:41.155\nWe'll do a one-two, and now, yeah,\n\n328\n00:16:41.155 --> 00:16:46.343\nwe need two lines to show the number\nof possibilities, 19.24 years.\n\n329\n00:16:46.343 --> 00:16:48.264\nI'm up to 10 characters.\n\n330\n00:16:48.264 --> 00:16:52.264\nSo, this is why we say 8\nis the bare minimum, right?\n\n331\n00:16:52.264 --> 00:16:58.043\nBut 9 or 10 is really nice,\n15 or 16 is super nice.\n\n332\n00:16:58.043 --> 00:17:01.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, what you're saying\nis the complexity and the length.\n\n333\n00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.880\nThe length is what's really taking\nthe exponent level up another notch.\n\n334\n00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.185\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's test that theory\nbecause remember what I said,\n\n335\n00:17:08.185 --> 00:17:10.590\nit's really both of them combined.\n\n336\n00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.620\nLet's try long, but not complex and\nsee how it affects us, all right?\n\n337\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.060\nLet's do, I'm gonna copy that out,\nso we can put it back if we need it.\n\n338\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:25.168\nAnd let's just say I have a long password,\nwe'll say complex, that's 7,\n\n339\n00:17:25.168 --> 00:17:30.020\npass, we'll 10 to match our last one,\nall right?\n\n340\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.700\nSo that last one we did that said\n19 years was 10 characters long.\n\n341\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.961\nBut it was also complex, here,\nI've got 10 characters long,\n\n342\n00:17:37.961 --> 00:17:41.537\nbut it's only 24 minutes,\nwhat happened, right?\n\n343\n00:17:41.537 --> 00:17:44.060\n&gt;&gt; It's not just one or the other.\n\n344\n00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, not just length,\nnot just complexity, but\n\n345\n00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.350\nboth of those combined are what\nmake a strong password.\n\n346\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.060\nSo we've got to use both, all right?\n\n347\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.612\nNow, I think at this point,\n\n348\n00:17:55.612 --> 00:17:59.514\nwe probably all have a pretty good\nidea of how to make a strong password.\n\n349\n00:17:59.514 --> 00:18:03.802\nBut remember the beginning I told you\nI would show you a way to make us easy\n\n350\n00:18:03.802 --> 00:18:05.985\nto remember strong password.\n\n351\n00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:08.359\nBecause that, to me, is not easy.\n\n352\n00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:13.374\nCompl@x!12, yeah, try and\nremember that at 7:30\n\n353\n00:18:13.374 --> 00:18:19.503\nin the morning on a Monday morning\nafter a nice long weekend at the beach.\n\n354\n00:18:19.503 --> 00:18:21.846\nAnd you're like, wait,\nwas that an o or an a?\n\n355\n00:18:21.846 --> 00:18:23.295\nDid I switch that @?\n\n356\n00:18:23.295 --> 00:18:25.511\nWhich a did I switch?\n\n357\n00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:26.543\nAah.\n\n358\n00:18:26.543 --> 00:18:30.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly, and the word\ncomplex to me, it doesn't mean anything.\n\n359\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.605\nSo should I use some of my personal\ninformation, like my last name and\n\n360\n00:18:35.605 --> 00:18:39.035\nmy birthday, or\nis that something I should try?\n\n361\n00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.585\n&gt;&gt; That is a great question,\n\n362\n00:18:40.585 --> 00:18:44.053\nand let's talk about a couple don'ts\nwhen making strong passwords.\n\n363\n00:18:44.053 --> 00:18:45.465\nNow we talked about a few of the do's,\n\n364\n00:18:45.465 --> 00:18:47.695\nthings we need to do,\ncomplexity and length.\n\n365\n00:18:47.695 --> 00:18:50.655\nBut let's talk about a couple of\nthe don'ts, all right, when we talk about\n\n366\n00:18:50.655 --> 00:18:54.245\ncreating strong passwords, there's\na few things that you just cannot do.\n\n367\n00:18:54.245 --> 00:18:59.040\nOne is, use a single word that's\nfound in a dictionary, right,\n\n368\n00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.220\nlike the word password, or\nthe word book, or the word mother.\n\n369\n00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.155\nThe bad guys use what we call dictionary\nfiles, which is just a list of all words,\n\n370\n00:19:09.155 --> 00:19:09.930\nright?\n\n371\n00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.500\nAnd they can run through that\nlist 100 billion at a time.\n\n372\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.715\nSo they can go through the entire\nWebster's Dictionary in under a minute.\n\n373\n00:19:17.715 --> 00:19:24.280\nAnd so using a single word is\nnot gonna be a good idea, right?\n\n374\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.310\nEven if you make it complex,\n\n375\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.940\nit's not still a good idea\nbecause the bad guys know, right?\n\n376\n00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.012\nUs humans, we fall into these patterns,\nand when we tell somebody to make\n\n377\n00:19:34.012 --> 00:19:38.083\na complex password, most people put\na capital letter at the beginning and\n\n378\n00:19:38.083 --> 00:19:40.660\na number 1 at the end or\nan exclamation point.\n\n379\n00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.990\nWell, guess what?\n\n380\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.020\nThe bad guys know this, so they're\ngonna take their dictionary file, and\n\n381\n00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.950\nthey'll run through every\nword in the dictionary.\n\n382\n00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.061\nThen they're gonna uppercase\nthe first letter of every word and\n\n383\n00:19:50.061 --> 00:19:53.470\nappend a 1 to every word and\nrun through the entire dictionary again.\n\n384\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.340\nIt's not gonna take them long,\nyou think, gosh, they'd never do that.\n\n385\n00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.240\nWe're talking about minutes here,\nit would not take them long at all.\n\n386\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.401\nSo using a simple word,\neven if you make it semi-complex,\n\n387\n00:20:03.401 --> 00:20:05.826\nis not really gonna be a good idea.\n\n388\n00:20:05.826 --> 00:20:10.922\nIf I took this, right,\nlet's say we took the word password,\n\n389\n00:20:10.922 --> 00:20:14.270\nwe're looking at 2.17 seconds.\n\n390\n00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.240\nMike, you showed me some great techniques.\n\n391\n00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:23.827\nWe're gonna make it complex,\ncapital P@$$w0rd!\n\n392\n00:20:23.827 --> 00:20:28.492\nAt 2.43 months, whew, we're right\nback up there where we wanna be.\n\n393\n00:20:28.492 --> 00:20:32.110\nNo, because the bad guys know\nthis is a commonly used password,\n\n394\n00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.602\nso they're gonna add that to\ntheir dictionary file, right?\n\n395\n00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:39.986\nSo even though according to this website,\nthere is a lot of possibilities for\n\n396\n00:20:39.986 --> 00:20:42.600\na 9 character complex password.\n\n397\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600\nIf it's something that everybody uses or\n\n398\n00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.990\nthe bad guys know,\nit's still not gonna do you any good.\n\n399\n00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.770\nSo, you can't use words that\nare found in dictionaries,\n\n400\n00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.190\neven if you try to make them complex.\n\n401\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.580\nAnd you can't use personal information.\n\n402\n00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.900\nBecause that is publicly or maybe not\npublicly, but it's attainable information.\n\n403\n00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.384\nWell, and\nI can find out your spouse's name, right?\n\n404\n00:21:04.384 --> 00:21:07.080\nI'm sure somewhere on the web,\nI can look that up.\n\n405\n00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.643\nIf I really wanted to,\nI can get a public record, right?\n\n406\n00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:13.034\nIf you are the CEO of a company and\nI wanted to attack you, I wouldn't mind\n\n407\n00:21:13.034 --> 00:21:17.037\nspending a little effort, going to public\nrecords, looking at marriage licenses,\n\n408\n00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:20.180\nlooking at birth certificates,\nfinding your kids' names.\n\n409\n00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.920\nI could talk to your co-workers\nwhen I run into them\n\n410\n00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.780\naccidentally at the restaurant or\nthe club down the street, right?\n\n411\n00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.120\nI can bump into you accidentally and\nthen start talking about dogs.\n\n412\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.425\nI have a dog, blah blah blah,\nwhat's your dog's name?\n\n413\n00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:37.031\nAnd start finding out personal information\nthat I can use to try to guess your\n\n414\n00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:37.940\npasswords.\n\n415\n00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:42.853\nSo using any personal information,\nbirthdays, kids' names, anniversaries,\n\n416\n00:21:42.853 --> 00:21:46.444\nwhere you work, things like that,\nnot gonna be a good idea.\n\n417\n00:21:46.444 --> 00:21:50.172\nBecause this is information that the bad\nguys can obtain, add to their dictionary\n\n418\n00:21:50.172 --> 00:21:53.850\nfile, what they use to crack your\npasswords, and crack those passwords.\n\n419\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:59.700\nSo even though a site like this might\ntell you that your son's name and his\n\n420\n00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.010\nbirthday makes a complex password, it's\ngonna take a long time, it's really not.\n\n421\n00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.310\nThat's why I wanna make\nsure we understand.\n\n422\n00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.020\nThis is not a password strength meter.\n\n423\n00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.650\nThis is just telling you how\nmany possibilities there are.\n\n424\n00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.310\nIf it's a weak password, if it's\ncommonly used words, no matter how long,\n\n425\n00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.900\nit's still gonna be a weak password,\nright?\n\n426\n00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.640\nSo two of the big don'ts are going to be,\n\n427\n00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.450\ndon't use words that\nare found in the dictionary.\n\n428\n00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.890\nAnd I don't just mean English words,\nright?\n\n429\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.800\nYou can't use French words either,\n\n430\n00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.300\nbecause I have a French dictionary\nthat I can run through.\n\n431\n00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.790\nYou can't use Spanish words,\nbecause guess what?\n\n432\n00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.120\nI have a Spanish dictionary\nthat I can run through.\n\n433\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.560\nYou can't use Klingon words, right?\n\n434\n00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.190\nI know a lot of you geeks out there\nare thinking yeah, nobody knows Klingon.\n\n435\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.870\nThe bad guys are geeks,\ntoo, and we can find this,\n\n436\n00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:47.700\nElvish dictionaries, Klingon dictionaries,\nJar Jar Binks dictionaries, I don't know.\n\n437\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.330\nAll of these can be found,\nI can create my own.\n\n438\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.610\nSo don't think you're gonna get away\nfrom that by using a foreign word.\n\n439\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.665\n&gt;&gt; So I can't use any words in the\ndictionary, so what am I supposed to do?\n\n440\n00:22:57.665 --> 00:23:00.575\n[LAUGH] How can I make\na password without words?\n\n441\n00:23:00.575 --> 00:23:02.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, so\n\n442\n00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.180\nlet's get back to what we\noriginally wanted to do,\n\n443\n00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:09.050\nis make a strong password that's easy\nto remember, and here's the key.\n\n444\n00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.120\nWhen I said you can't use\nwords that are dictionary,\n\n445\n00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.466\nyou can't use a single word\nthat's in a dictionary.\n\n446\n00:23:13.466 --> 00:23:15.057\n&gt;&gt; Key phrase, single word.\n\n447\n00:23:15.057 --> 00:23:16.053\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n448\n00:23:16.053 --> 00:23:16.793\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n449\n00:23:16.793 --> 00:23:20.631\n&gt;&gt; If we start creating what\nis known as a pass phrase,\n\n450\n00:23:20.631 --> 00:23:23.499\nnow we're gonna be talking, right?\n\n451\n00:23:23.499 --> 00:23:26.500\nWe're gonna take multiple words and\nput them in our password.\n\n452\n00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.828\nA pass phrase is simply, instead of\na single word, it's a phrase of some kind.\n\n453\n00:23:30.828 --> 00:23:32.468\nLike-\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n454\n00:23:32.468 --> 00:23:33.191\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n455\n00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:34.632\n&gt;&gt; Or-\n&gt;&gt; Maybe more than that.\n\n456\n00:23:34.632 --> 00:23:36.180\n&gt;&gt; Hello, how are you?\n\n457\n00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:36.708\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n458\n00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:37.607\n&gt;&gt; That's a phrase.\n\n459\n00:23:37.607 --> 00:23:41.160\n&gt;&gt; Or my favorite color is blue, right?\n\n460\n00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.190\nThat would be a pass phrase.\n\n461\n00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:46.612\nAnd you think well, all those are simple\nwords, but the bad guys aren't gonna\n\n462\n00:23:46.612 --> 00:23:50.512\nhave a dictionary file with that\ncombination of words in it, right?\n\n463\n00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:51.636\nThat's the key here.\n\n464\n00:23:51.636 --> 00:23:54.910\nLet's go back to my website and\nsee what something like that would do.\n\n465\n00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:55.648\nWhat did I say?\n\n466\n00:23:55.648 --> 00:24:02.686\nMy favorite color is,\nooh, I can't type today.\n\n467\n00:24:02.686 --> 00:24:03.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hard not to\ndo the spaces [LAUGH].\n\n468\n00:24:03.739 --> 00:24:06.190\n&gt;&gt; Is blue, yes, it is, all right.\n\n469\n00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:12.089\n21 characters long,\n1.71 billion centuries.\n\n470\n00:24:12.089 --> 00:24:13.600\n&gt;&gt; Billion centuries [LAUGH].\n\n471\n00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.525\n&gt;&gt; To crack, all right.\n\n472\n00:24:15.525 --> 00:24:18.510\n1.71 billion centuries to crack.\n\n473\n00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.319\nAnd is that easy to remember?\n\n474\n00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:21.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n475\n00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.015\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nmy favorite color is blue, right?\n\n476\n00:24:24.015 --> 00:24:27.393\nYou could take your\nfavorite quote from a book,\n\n477\n00:24:27.393 --> 00:24:32.850\nyour favorite lyric from a song and\nyou could use this as your password.\n\n478\n00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:38.958\nNow, what I would recommend, most places\nare going to require complexity, right?\n\n479\n00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:41.261\nThey're gonna want you to put\nin a mix of characters, so\n\n480\n00:24:41.261 --> 00:24:44.595\nthey wouldn't even accept that as\na password, which they should technically.\n\n481\n00:24:44.595 --> 00:24:46.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you there's a shift in\n\n482\n00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:49.549\nsecurity going on right now, but\nthat's another show, another day.\n\n483\n00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:52.562\nAll right, so what would I do if I\nwanted to use something like this, but\n\n484\n00:24:52.562 --> 00:24:54.470\nthey're requiring complexity?\n\n485\n00:24:54.470 --> 00:25:00.340\nSimply change that to a capital,\nmaybe change one of these to a number,\n\n486\n00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:05.290\nadd an exclamation point on the end, or\nmaybe not something so obvious, right.\n\n487\n00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.440\nThe exclamation point, everybody does.\n\n488\n00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.765\nSo maybe I'll put a close\nparenthesis at the end of it.\n\n489\n00:25:09.765 --> 00:25:15.674\n1.04 hundred billion trillion centuries.\n\n490\n00:25:15.674 --> 00:25:16.773\n&gt;&gt; That's a long time.\n\n491\n00:25:16.773 --> 00:25:19.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is a long time and\n\n492\n00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.835\nit's relatively easy to remember,\nall right.\n\n493\n00:25:23.835 --> 00:25:26.125\nThat's the trick, is I wanna make a long,\n\n494\n00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:29.505\nstrong complex password,\nthat's easy to remember.\n\n495\n00:25:29.505 --> 00:25:32.115\nSo using a phrase like that\nmakes it a lot easier.\n\n496\n00:25:32.115 --> 00:25:36.210\n&gt;&gt; And if we have where we have to use\na special character, maybe it's something\n\n497\n00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.864\nlike, in my mind I always for\nsome reason, instead of using a three,\n\n498\n00:25:39.864 --> 00:25:44.044\nif I do an e, I sometimes do the number\nsign, just right above the character.\n\n499\n00:25:44.044 --> 00:25:45.554\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So it's something that\n\n500\n00:25:45.554 --> 00:25:46.890\nI remember how to do.\n\n501\n00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:50.248\nSo if you can kinda take something that,\nin your brain,\n\n502\n00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:53.183\nI know that I'm using my\nfavorite color is blue.\n\n503\n00:25:53.183 --> 00:25:58.039\nBut I know I'm using the b as a 6 or\na different character that might\n\n504\n00:25:58.039 --> 00:26:02.135\nnot have any correlation but\nit makes sense in my brain.\n\n505\n00:26:02.135 --> 00:26:03.680\nAnd so I'll remember it.\n\n506\n00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.160\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Just one or two changes in the letter.\n\n507\n00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.430\n&gt;&gt; And that's the trick.\n\n508\n00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.345\nTo make it complex, you don't have\nto have five special characters,\n\n509\n00:26:11.345 --> 00:26:13.790\nyou don't have to have three\ndifferent numbers are in there.\n\n510\n00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.730\nJust one is enough,\nbecause the bad guy doesn't know\n\n511\n00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.250\nif you've used one special character or\nten special characters, right?\n\n512\n00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.230\nHe still has to try all of\nthe possibilities because you've put\n\n513\n00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.210\nat least one in there,\nhe has to try them all.\n\n514\n00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.136\nAnd that's the key here.\n\n515\n00:26:28.136 --> 00:26:31.110\nSo we don't have to make it\nincredibly hard to remember,\n\n516\n00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:34.740\nwe just need to make it long and complex.\n\n517\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.832\nAnother way to do it is\nmaybe just words that\n\n518\n00:26:39.832 --> 00:26:47.053\ndon't normally go together like car,\nbaseball, and cat.\n\n519\n00:26:47.053 --> 00:26:48.270\nThat's 21 years.\n\n520\n00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.487\n&gt;&gt; And those are things that\nmaybe correlate to your life.\n\n521\n00:26:51.487 --> 00:26:55.647\nI'm thinking, fuego, pants, cat,\ncuz we call them fuego pants.\n\n522\n00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:57.855\nSo that's why fuego, pants, cat.\n\n523\n00:26:57.855 --> 00:27:01.506\nSo those are simple words, and\nthere's a spanish word, but\n\n524\n00:27:01.506 --> 00:27:03.710\nI can remember that pretty easily.\n\n525\n00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:08.570\nCapitalize the f, maybe do an @ for the\ncat and I have a really strong password.\n\n526\n00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:09.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n527\n00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.030\nCar, baseball, cat says 21 years.\n\n528\n00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.190\nThat's really strong.\n\n529\n00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:17.030\nIt's not complex, so it won't meet any\nrequirements if your system is, but\n\n530\n00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.420\na simple change.\n\n531\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.618\nAnd you might not do the first character,\nmaybe the second character or\n\n532\n00:27:23.618 --> 00:27:26.650\nthe second word has the capital letter and\n\n533\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:31.945\nthen I may be change the l to a 1,\nand I'm up to 40,000 centuries.\n\n534\n00:27:31.945 --> 00:27:36.020\nI don't have any special characters\nin there, so maybe cat gets the @.\n\n535\n00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.880\nIt rhymes in my head, the cat gets the @,\nso that would make it easy to remember,\n\n536\n00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.385\nright?\n\n537\n00:27:41.385 --> 00:27:47.103\nAnd there I have a password\nthat's 15.67 million centuries.\n\n538\n00:27:47.103 --> 00:27:49.310\nWhich is way strong, right?\n\n539\n00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:53.532\nThat's on a scale of 1 to 10,\nnow we're in instead of at negative 1,\n\n540\n00:27:53.532 --> 00:27:56.430\nwe're up to 25, we're way beyond strong.\n\n541\n00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:03.040\nSo hopefully this is giving you an idea\nof one, what a strong password is, right?\n\n542\n00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.973\nAnd two, how I can create a strong\npassword that's easy to remember,\n\n543\n00:28:07.973 --> 00:28:11.582\nand three,\nwhat not to do with passwords, right?\n\n544\n00:28:11.582 --> 00:28:12.894\nSo hopefully, this will help you guys.\n\n545\n00:28:12.894 --> 00:28:16.994\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've learned so much just right\nnow, and I think I'm gonna go home and\n\n546\n00:28:16.994 --> 00:28:18.899\nchange all my passwords right now.\n\n547\n00:28:18.899 --> 00:28:20.420\nAnd change them to things\nthat I can remember.\n\n548\n00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.440\nSo thank you so much for that information.\n\n549\n00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.302\nI hope you all enjoyed it, I know I did.\n\n550\n00:28:24.302 --> 00:28:28.313\nSo stay tuned for\nmore on end user security awareness.\n\n551\n00:28:28.313 --> 00:28:31.780\n[SOUND]\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.684 --> 00:00:08.222\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.222 --> 00:00:12.019\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.089\n&gt;&gt; All right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n7\n00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.554\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:18.095\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n9\n00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:22.501\nBack again with another episode of\nend user security awareness and\n\n10\n00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.554\nthis is gonna be a fun episode.\n\n11\n00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:28.756\nWe've got some really neat stuff lined up\ntalking about social engineering which is\n\n12\n00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:31.198\njust a fun, fun topic, so\nbe ready for this one.\n\n13\n00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.812\nAnd here in the studio to help\nme I've got Mr Daniel Lowrie.\n\n14\n00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:34.973\nDaniel, thanks for joining us.\n\n15\n00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:35.979\n&gt;&gt; Not a problem.\n\n16\n00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:37.781\nAlways a pleasure to be in the studio and\n\n17\n00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:40.530\ntalking about security,\nit's one of my favorite topics.\n\n18\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.021\nAs you know and today, as Don alluded to,\nwe are doing social engineering and\n\n19\n00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:46.069\nit is a lot of fun.\n\n20\n00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:51.510\nAnd you're thinking, social engineering,\nI may have heard that term before.\n\n21\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.101\nAnd there is a more proper use for\nthat term,\n\n22\n00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:58.600\nit was defined as influencing society\nin a certain way to do certain things.\n\n23\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.745\nAnd that is kind of the idea of\nwhat we're moving into today,\n\n24\n00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:07.962\nsocial engineering, but for nefarious\npurposes instead of little halos.\n\n25\n00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:09.851\n&gt;&gt; I was about to say, it sounds\nlike you're describing politicians.\n\n26\n00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:10.362\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.451\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So politicians are hackers?\n\n28\n00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:14.781\n&gt;&gt; You know what, they actually kinda are.\n\n29\n00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:17.541\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're social engineers, in any case,\n\n30\n00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:21.763\ncuz they're trying to influence you into\nvoting for them, or thinking their way.\n\n31\n00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:27.502\nAnd that is what from a IT security\nstandpoint, what a social engineer does.\n\n32\n00:01:27.502 --> 00:01:32.609\nBasically, we like to boil it down to\nthe definition of, this is human hacking.\n\n33\n00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.196\nWe are going after the human\nelement of the system\n\n34\n00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:37.795\ninstead of the technical\nelement of the system.\n\n35\n00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:41.254\nSo not that we don't still use\ntechnical aspects, cuz it is IT,\n\n36\n00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:45.497\nyou're gonna have to deal with a computer\nor something, or the hacker would.\n\n37\n00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:49.367\nBut they're more focused in on trying\nto get the user to do something they\n\n38\n00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:51.405\nshouldn't instead of the computer.\n\n39\n00:01:51.405 --> 00:01:54.598\n&gt;&gt; Well, a lot of hackers are using\nlike sophisticated tools and\n\n40\n00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:58.777\nexploiting software bugs and really just\na ton of computer know-how to get in and\n\n41\n00:01:58.777 --> 00:01:59.894\nbreak into a system.\n\n42\n00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:03.410\nAnd I think that would be preferred\nbecause it be harder to notice if you\n\n43\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.151\ninvolve a human, isn't it easy.\n\n44\n00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:09.014\nYou're like, why would they target\na human as oppose to a computer?\n\n45\n00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:09.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n46\n00:02:09.904 --> 00:02:11.920\nWhy would they go after people?\n\n47\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.352\nBecause people have inherent proclivities.\n\n48\n00:02:14.352 --> 00:02:17.005\nActually, let's go to\nmy screen really quick.\n\n49\n00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:20.060\nLet me show you a little\ndefinition I worked up.\n\n50\n00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.735\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Social engineering,\n\n51\n00:02:21.735 --> 00:02:25.956\ntaking advantage of human proclivities,\nsocial norms, presuppositions, etc.,\n\n52\n00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:28.980\nthrough deception to gain access\nto sensitive information.\n\n53\n00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.667\nThe reason they go through the human is\nbecause, as our little [LAUGH] couple of\n\n54\n00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:38.569\nfolks here that we have going on will show\nyou, it's a whole lot easier than doing\n\n55\n00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.340\nthose highly technical types of\nhacking to get into a system.\n\n56\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.207\nAs you can see here, we've got a lady.\n\n57\n00:02:43.207 --> 00:02:47.801\nI've made her in red because she's\nthe attacker, right, she's the bad person.\n\n58\n00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:51.570\nAnd then we've got out Joe Schmoe\nworker who's going into the building.\n\n59\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.051\nAnd it's just, could you hold the door for\nme, I forgot my badge today.\n\n60\n00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.813\nAnd we've all kinda experience this,\nand what does he do?\n\n61\n00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:59.675\nSure, because what, social norms say,\n\n62\n00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:04.673\nyou hold the door for someone who needs\nyour help, we want to be helpful.\n\n63\n00:03:04.673 --> 00:03:07.987\nIt's something that we do and\nit's something we wanna do,\n\n64\n00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.120\nit's part of the make up of humanity.\n\n65\n00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.492\nWe try to encourage the being of helpful\nand to be courteous to people, right?\n\n66\n00:03:14.492 --> 00:03:18.138\nSo the hacker, therefore,\ntakes advantage of those systems so\n\n67\n00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:21.326\nthat he can gain access to\nthat sensitive information.\n\n68\n00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.996\nAnd all this person does\nis hold the door open.\n\n69\n00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:27.769\nAnd now someone who doesn't have\nauthorization through guile and\n\n70\n00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.674\ndeception has gained access to\na certain area that probably don't or\n\n71\n00:03:31.674 --> 00:03:33.310\nshouldn't have access to.\n\n72\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.733\n&gt;&gt; And this type of attack is\ncalled a tailgating attack, right?\n\n73\n00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:38.812\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And you see it not just with doors on\n\n74\n00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:42.294\na building but even the arms inside\nof a gated-access community or\n\n75\n00:03:42.294 --> 00:03:44.420\nyour parking lot might have gates on it.\n\n76\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.033\nAnd when the arm goes up your car,\nyour authorized vehicle drives through.\n\n77\n00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:52.260\nAnd if the gate stays up long enough,\nsomebody else can follow right behind you.\n\n78\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.534\nAnd while it's not the crazy computer\nhacking that we normally think of, it is\n\n79\n00:03:56.534 --> 00:04:01.094\na form of hacking cuz, normally, they\nwouldn't be able to get through that door.\n\n80\n00:04:01.094 --> 00:04:04.570\nBut since it's already open,\nthey can come through right with you, and\n\n81\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.374\nnow they get in.\n\n82\n00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:09.937\nAnd this type of thing is easy to defeat,\nright, it's easy to stop.\n\n83\n00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:13.788\nBut the social norms get in the way,\nright, so I can say, you know what?\n\n84\n00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:16.187\nOnly one person can go\nthrough a door at a time.\n\n85\n00:04:16.187 --> 00:04:19.495\nSo if I open a door and I go through it,\nI've gotta close it behind me,\n\n86\n00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:22.478\neven if somebody's standing\nright there behind me to get in.\n\n87\n00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:24.416\nThey've gotta swipe their badge, right?\n\n88\n00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:25.883\nWe do it here at our building,\n\n89\n00:04:25.883 --> 00:04:29.304\nwe've got our little key cards that\nwe wave to get into the building.\n\n90\n00:04:29.304 --> 00:04:32.486\nSo I might use mine, open the door, and\nthen pull the door closed behind me.\n\n91\n00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:35.909\nWell, imagine what that's like if\nsomebody's standing there holding boxes in\n\n92\n00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.687\ntheir hands, they're trying to get in.\n\n93\n00:04:37.687 --> 00:04:39.662\nNope, sorry,\nI've got to pull this door closed on you,\n\n94\n00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:40.910\nright, and people don't do that.\n\n95\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.342\n&gt;&gt; And the look on the face of the person,\n\n96\n00:04:43.342 --> 00:04:46.162\nare you really gonna not\nlet me in this door?\n\n97\n00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:47.467\nI've got all these boxes.\n\n98\n00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:50.983\nThey're falling over and\nI just need you to hold the door for me.\n\n99\n00:04:50.983 --> 00:04:55.059\nAnd security says, no, I can't help you.\n\n100\n00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:59.172\nGo around the front and\nsomebody there should be able to help you.\n\n101\n00:04:59.172 --> 00:05:01.537\nThis is an access door only for employees.\n\n102\n00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:05.053\nYou're bringing in a delivery or if you're\nan employee and you have a large delivery,\n\n103\n00:05:05.053 --> 00:05:06.786\nmaybe that's the best place to go anyway,\n\n104\n00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:08.730\nbecause there will be\npeople there to help you.\n\n105\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.421\nAnd you don't need to tailgate\nin to get in the system.\n\n106\n00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:17.088\nAnd that's the important part, is that you\ndon't allow for those security breaches.\n\n107\n00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:21.343\nEven though what seems extremely\nminute and small, it's not a big deal.\n\n108\n00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:25.122\nI shouldn't let you in,\nespecially if I don't know who you are.\n\n109\n00:05:25.122 --> 00:05:28.046\nThat's the main thing to go,\na lot of this happens.\n\n110\n00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:32.277\nMaybe I've heard a lot of pen tester\nthat specialize in penetration.\n\n111\n00:05:32.277 --> 00:05:35.852\nPeople who attack your system\nto find the weak spots so\n\n112\n00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:37.924\nthat they can inform you of it.\n\n113\n00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:40.976\nThey'll say that a cigarette\nis a pen tester's best friend,\n\n114\n00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:43.453\nbecause they just go hang\nout in the smoking area.\n\n115\n00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:47.642\nAnd they just act like another employee,\nand they're finishing their cigarette.\n\n116\n00:05:47.642 --> 00:05:48.645\nMan, can you hold that door for\nme real quick.\n\n117\n00:05:48.645 --> 00:05:50.967\nAnd somebody lets them in,\nand that's how they get in.\n\n118\n00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:55.529\nNow they have access into the system\nwhere they shouldn't, unauthorized,\n\n119\n00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:56.871\nthat's the bad part.\n\n120\n00:05:56.871 --> 00:06:00.076\n&gt;&gt; So these aren't the traditional\ncomputer hacker that we think of.\n\n121\n00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:02.848\nThese are really it's almost\nmore like a con man, right?\n\n122\n00:06:02.848 --> 00:06:03.908\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n123\n00:06:03.908 --> 00:06:04.799\nThese people are great actors.\n\n124\n00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:07.929\nThey have studied the human condition,\n\n125\n00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:12.726\nthey have looked at body language,\nand facial expressions.\n\n126\n00:06:12.726 --> 00:06:17.576\nThings that they're studying hacking\npeople probably, or if not as much,\n\n127\n00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:20.319\nif not more or so\nthan the computer itself.\n\n128\n00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.517\nBecause they understand the human\nelement a lot of times can be\n\n129\n00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.032\nthe weakest link inside the system.\n\n130\n00:06:27.032 --> 00:06:31.713\nSo it's up to us as users or\nas people that work for an organization or\n\n131\n00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:35.922\ninside of some organization to\nbecome as hard and as strong.\n\n132\n00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:39.611\nBasically kind of patching ourselves as\nwe have computer patches and updates.\n\n133\n00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:44.066\nWe need to update ourselves, understand\nlike what we're doing right now taking and\n\n134\n00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:46.150\nuse the security awareness training.\n\n135\n00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.907\nThat allows you to understand what kind\nof vectors of attack that are coming.\n\n136\n00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:52.916\nNow that tailgating attack might\nnot come to fruition with you on\n\n137\n00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:57.307\nthe scene because you,\nI don't know who you are and you're not.\n\n138\n00:06:57.307 --> 00:06:59.152\nYou don't have any kinda\nidentification on you.\n\n139\n00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.589\nSo I'm gonna direct you somewhere else,\nand\n\n140\n00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:05.452\nthen I'm gonna inform someone that\nthere was someone trying to get in.\n\n141\n00:07:05.452 --> 00:07:07.104\nI didn't know who they were.\n\n142\n00:07:07.104 --> 00:07:09.465\nSo just keep on the look out for\nthat kinda person.\n\n143\n00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:12.902\n&gt;&gt; Now, the type of attack we just\ndescribed, the tailgating attack,\n\n144\n00:07:12.902 --> 00:07:15.162\nthat's a physical presence type of attack.\n\n145\n00:07:15.162 --> 00:07:17.980\nThe attacker is there,\nthey're walking through a door.\n\n146\n00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.775\nBut they're not all like that,\n\n147\n00:07:19.775 --> 00:07:24.103\nright, a lot of them do actually leverage\na computer and an online presence.\n\n148\n00:07:24.103 --> 00:07:24.869\nSo we don't see a person, right?\n\n149\n00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:26.293\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly right,\n\n150\n00:07:26.293 --> 00:07:30.283\na lot of times, you won't have\na physical person walking around,\n\n151\n00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:34.789\ntrying to gain access to the building\neven though that can and does happen.\n\n152\n00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:39.243\nThey still employ that technological\nside of things, they are tech people,\n\n153\n00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:41.242\nand we are looking at IT security.\n\n154\n00:07:41.242 --> 00:07:42.872\nThe physical security is a part of that.\n\n155\n00:07:42.872 --> 00:07:47.180\nSo we wanna take a look at some of the\nways in which they employ to gain access\n\n156\n00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.326\nto the actual technical\nrealm of your organization.\n\n157\n00:07:50.326 --> 00:07:54.816\nA lot of times,\nit comes through what's called phishing.\n\n158\n00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:58.281\nAnd we're not talking about going to\nthe pier with your rod and wheel and\n\n159\n00:07:58.281 --> 00:07:59.793\na bucket and having a nice day.\n\n160\n00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:01.415\nMaybe pulling in a nice red, right.\n\n161\n00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:02.807\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not what we're talking\n\n162\n00:08:02.807 --> 00:08:03.310\nabout here.\n\n163\n00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.265\nTalking about P-H phishing, right?\n\n164\n00:08:05.265 --> 00:08:09.824\nThis comes back from, P-H started getting\nused back with the old phone freaks,\n\n165\n00:08:09.824 --> 00:08:13.244\npeople that were hacking phone networks,\nso they used ph for\n\n166\n00:08:13.244 --> 00:08:14.804\nphone, same kind of idea.\n\n167\n00:08:14.804 --> 00:08:17.123\nNow we have phishing, P-H phishing,\n\n168\n00:08:17.123 --> 00:08:21.552\nwhich is email that looks like it's\nfrom a legitimate entity, right, but\n\n169\n00:08:21.552 --> 00:08:26.407\nit's crafted for the purposes of tricking\nusers to divulge personal information\n\n170\n00:08:26.407 --> 00:08:31.401\nsuch as credit card numbers, user names\nand passwords, social security numbers,\n\n171\n00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:36.361\netc, any kind of sensitive information\nthat would give them access to the system.\n\n172\n00:08:36.361 --> 00:08:38.503\nA lot of times that is what\nphishing is going for.\n\n173\n00:08:38.503 --> 00:08:42.420\nWe also have a spear phishing,\nwhich is a targeted attack.\n\n174\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.291\nI have a specific target in mind.\n\n175\n00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:48.658\nMaybe there's a low-level IT worker,\nmaybe someone on the help desk.\n\n176\n00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:53.588\nI'm gonna target them because they have\nsome access and they're probably not\n\n177\n00:08:53.588 --> 00:08:57.631\nas up to speed in security as\nthe higher-level people might be.\n\n178\n00:08:57.631 --> 00:08:59.210\nOr, I go after an executive.\n\n179\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.691\nAll right, because their business\nis looking at bottom lines,\n\n180\n00:09:02.691 --> 00:09:07.083\nand things we're going to do in the next\nfiscal year, and things of that nature.\n\n181\n00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:07.705\nSo I'm going to target them.\n\n182\n00:09:07.705 --> 00:09:10.549\nThey're not computer people,\nthey're executive people.\n\n183\n00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:12.803\nThey don't have that\nlevel of understanding.\n\n184\n00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:17.173\nSo that's what we're trying to do is up\neverybody's game, so that when you see\n\n185\n00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:21.738\nthese types of attacks, you'll notice\nthem, spot them, and be able to avoid them\n\n186\n00:09:21.738 --> 00:09:26.199\nwhen they do occur because it happens\nwith a lot of regularity, unfortunately.\n\n187\n00:09:26.199 --> 00:09:29.096\nSo we have to be on the look out for this.\n\n188\n00:09:29.096 --> 00:09:32.017\n&gt;&gt; And I know regular phishing,\nbecause email is free, right?\n\n189\n00:09:32.017 --> 00:09:35.089\nIf I send one email or\nif I send one million emails,\n\n190\n00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:37.149\nit doesn't cost any different.\n\n191\n00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:41.057\nThat they can craft an attack like this\nand just blast it out to the entire\n\n192\n00:09:41.057 --> 00:09:45.053\nInternet if they can, whoever's\nemail addresses they happen to have.\n\n193\n00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:47.920\nAnd if even one 1% of the people fall for\nthat trick,\n\n194\n00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.397\nthat could be hundreds of thousands of\npeople, and they gather that information.\n\n195\n00:09:52.397 --> 00:09:56.378\nBut spear fishing has really taken off in\nrecent years because if you compromise\n\n196\n00:09:56.378 --> 00:10:00.192\nthe mailroom clerk's account, there's\nonly so much you can get out of it.\n\n197\n00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:05.020\nBut if you compromise the CEO's account,\nthe value is so much better.\n\n198\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.953\nAnd when they do spear fishing,\nthey really kick things up a notch.\n\n199\n00:10:06.953 --> 00:10:09.993\nThey learn about that person.\n\n200\n00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:12.380\nThey craft the e-mail to make it\nspecifically tailored to that person\n\n201\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.153\nthey're targeting.\n\n202\n00:10:13.153 --> 00:10:15.341\nThat's why they say it's spear fishing.\n\n203\n00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:16.520\nYou're targeting that one.\n\n204\n00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.582\nAnd those are turning out\nto be way more effective.\n\n205\n00:10:19.582 --> 00:10:23.991\nJust a generic phishing attempt, if you've\nbeen educated, if you've seen examples,\n\n206\n00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:25.533\nthey're pretty easy to spot.\n\n207\n00:10:25.533 --> 00:10:29.067\nBut if it's a spear phishing one,\nif it's one crafted just to you,\n\n208\n00:10:29.067 --> 00:10:30.497\nit becomes even trickier.\n\n209\n00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:32.486\nAnd they really get sophisticated,\n\n210\n00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:35.510\nfinding out things like if\nyou've got a Facebook page.\n\n211\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.282\nAnd they can figure out\nwho you're friends with,\n\n212\n00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:39.656\nthey can craft an email as if it was\ncoming from one of your friends.\n\n213\n00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:43.007\nNow it's not a generic, hey,\nI'm so and so with your bank.\n\n214\n00:10:43.007 --> 00:10:44.831\nIt's hey, it's me,\nyour friend from college, or whatever.\n\n215\n00:10:44.831 --> 00:10:47.446\nAnd so\nnow it becomes that much more believable.\n\n216\n00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:50.688\nYou kind of let your guard down because\nthis is your friend emailing you or\n\n217\n00:10:50.688 --> 00:10:53.198\na family member, your husband or\nwife, emailing you.\n\n218\n00:10:53.198 --> 00:10:55.275\nAnd you let your guard down and\nyou fall for it.\n\n219\n00:10:55.275 --> 00:10:59.123\nAnd if it's an executive now\nthe damage can really be done.\n\n220\n00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:00.616\nAnd unfortunately,\nthis is happening all too often.\n\n221\n00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:04.505\nThere's some pretty big examples of it\nout there in the real world right now.\n\n222\n00:11:04.505 --> 00:11:07.854\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can definitely just go\nonto Google and search phishing emails,\n\n223\n00:11:07.854 --> 00:11:08.981\nspear phishing emails.\n\n224\n00:11:08.981 --> 00:11:12.657\nYou'll see this kind of thing,\njust example after example after example.\n\n225\n00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:15.772\nAnd speaking of examples, I wanna\ngive you a bit of a context of this,\n\n226\n00:11:15.772 --> 00:11:17.021\nwhat might this look like.\n\n227\n00:11:17.021 --> 00:11:21.749\nSo I've worked up just a demonstration,\nit's not gonna be perfect or one to one.\n\n228\n00:11:21.749 --> 00:11:24.832\nBut for our intents and purposes should\ngive you a pretty good idea of what this\n\n229\n00:11:24.832 --> 00:11:25.885\nkind of thing looks like.\n\n230\n00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:27.173\nSo let's take a look at my machine.\n\n231\n00:11:27.173 --> 00:11:28.930\nI'm opening my email account.\n\n232\n00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.185\nAnd I look, Daniel Lowrie has\nsent me a very important email.\n\n233\n00:11:33.185 --> 00:11:34.442\nSays Facebook Security Alert,\nREAD IMMEDIATELY.\n\n234\n00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:36.862\nI know Daniel, he's a great guy, man.\n\n235\n00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:39.722\nHe's probably passing along some\nreally good information about some\n\n236\n00:11:39.722 --> 00:11:40.602\nFacebook security.\n\n237\n00:11:40.602 --> 00:11:42.261\nMaybe I haven't heard of this.\n\n238\n00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:43.470\nSo I'm gonna check that out.\n\n239\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.839\nLet's go ahead and click on that and\nopen up the email and see what it says.\n\n240\n00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:49.105\nThere we go, Facebook.\n\n241\n00:11:49.105 --> 00:11:52.811\nDear valued Facebook user, we regret\nto inform you that our systems have\n\n242\n00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:57.483\nexperienced a security breach which has\nresulted in user data theft and deletion.\n\n243\n00:11:57.483 --> 00:12:03.632\nNo, symptoms of data deletion include\nloss of photos, videos and posts.\n\n244\n00:12:03.632 --> 00:12:06.249\nThat's not good,\nnot on my watch, buddy, right?\n\n245\n00:12:06.249 --> 00:12:07.484\nSo what does it say to do?\n\n246\n00:12:07.484 --> 00:12:09.597\nIt says please log in to your account and\n\n247\n00:12:09.597 --> 00:12:11.976\nverify any loss of data\nat our support page.\n\n248\n00:12:11.976 --> 00:12:14.378\nSo if I've had data loss,\nI need to let Facebook know.\n\n249\n00:12:14.378 --> 00:12:16.359\nI've gotta log in and check this out.\n\n250\n00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:19.077\nAnd they've conveniently given\nmy a link that I can do that.\n\n251\n00:12:19.077 --> 00:12:22.228\nI can either go to their support page or\nI can just login and\n\n252\n00:12:22.228 --> 00:12:23.816\ncheck my Facebook account.\n\n253\n00:12:23.816 --> 00:12:25.153\nI'm going to go ahead and do that.\n\n254\n00:12:25.153 --> 00:12:26.368\nLet me hit that link.\n\n255\n00:12:26.368 --> 00:12:30.288\nAnd it's telling me that I'm\nbeing redirected out of my email.\n\n256\n00:12:30.288 --> 00:12:30.801\nA lot of email systems to do that.\n\n257\n00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:32.492\nOkay, well,\nI guess I need to log into Facebook.\n\n258\n00:12:32.492 --> 00:12:34.261\nMaybe I logged out last time I was in.\n\n259\n00:12:34.261 --> 00:12:42.015\nSo I'm gonna say, I'm daniel@,\nyeah, sure, ITProTv.\n\n260\n00:12:42.015 --> 00:12:45.659\nITProTv, it helps if autocomplete works.\n\n261\n00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:50.361\nAnd I'll type in my super secret password,\nsuper secret password.\n\n262\n00:12:50.361 --> 00:12:51.995\nAnd I'll log in.\n\n263\n00:12:51.995 --> 00:12:58.107\nWeird, had a little trouble there,\nbut no matter.\n\n264\n00:12:58.107 --> 00:12:59.096\nI wonder why I had trouble.\n\n265\n00:12:59.096 --> 00:13:01.337\nI know it's my password, and I'll\nprobably try this a couple of times and\n\n266\n00:13:01.337 --> 00:13:01.929\nthen I'll log in.\n\n267\n00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:07.118\nI notice up here I'm at the Facebook\nlogin page, interesting.\n\n268\n00:13:07.118 --> 00:13:09.025\nBut, nefariousness has been afoot.\n\n269\n00:13:09.025 --> 00:13:11.110\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n270\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.951\nIf I come over here to this\nvirtual machine I have going,\n\n271\n00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:17.413\nI am also acting as my own attacker.\n\n272\n00:13:17.413 --> 00:13:22.880\nI have a spear phishing,\ncredential grabbing utility running.\n\n273\n00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.540\nAnd when I crafted that email I made\nsure that it actually pointed to my evil\n\n274\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.806\nwebsite that looks like Facebook.\n\n275\n00:13:29.806 --> 00:13:32.249\nEven had a login page.\n\n276\n00:13:32.249 --> 00:13:36.089\nI saw no problem there.\nBut if you'll notice here,\n\n277\n00:13:36.089 --> 00:13:38.462\nthere's my email.\n\n278\n00:13:38.462 --> 00:13:40.061\nBasically my user name, and\nthere's my password, right there.\n\n279\n00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:45.038\nThis was able to actually garner\nmy username and password.\n\n280\n00:13:45.038 --> 00:13:48.966\nAnd once I'm finished I hit Ctrl+C and\nit generates a report for me so\n\n281\n00:13:48.966 --> 00:13:52.354\nthat I can at my leisure peruse\nthrough all the usernames and\n\n282\n00:13:52.354 --> 00:13:55.917\npasswords that I was able to\ngather using this type of attack.\n\n283\n00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:57.769\nAnd we saw another difference.\n\n284\n00:13:57.769 --> 00:14:00.377\nAnd if we go back here,\nyou'll see this is Facebook.\n\n285\n00:14:00.377 --> 00:14:03.318\nI could literally log in with my\nactual Facebook account from here.\n\n286\n00:14:03.318 --> 00:14:05.828\nOnce it actually grabbed my credentials,\n\n287\n00:14:05.828 --> 00:14:08.904\nit redirected me to\nFacebook's actual login page.\n\n288\n00:14:08.904 --> 00:14:11.743\nAnd as you can see,\nthere's no difference in the two.\n\n289\n00:14:11.743 --> 00:14:15.492\nIt cloned that website so that I would be\nfooled by it, very, very smart attack.\n\n290\n00:14:15.492 --> 00:14:19.294\n&gt;&gt; And most users wouldn't have\neven notice this happened, right?\n\n291\n00:14:19.294 --> 00:14:21.794\nThey try to log in once, it failed,\ngoes to the login page again,\n\n292\n00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.670\nthey log in again and\nthis time it would succeed.\n\n293\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.721\nYou would actually go into Facebook and\nget your page.\n\n294\n00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:28.205\nBut show them real quick,\nDaniel, back up and\n\n295\n00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:30.575\nshow them how they could\nhave spotted that.\n\n296\n00:14:30.575 --> 00:14:33.294\nHow they would have known that that\nwas not where they were actually\n\n297\n00:14:33.294 --> 00:14:33.987\nsupposed to be.\n\n298\n00:14:33.987 --> 00:14:36.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do that.\n\n299\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.290\nLet's take a look back at the email.\n\n300\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.779\nAnd if I go back down to these links\nthat they gave me and I hover over them.\n\n301\n00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:44.575\nIf you'll, I wish I could,\nwell, I guess I can.\n\n302\n00:14:44.575 --> 00:14:47.070\nLet me see here.\n\n303\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.221\nNo, I can't stay hovered in and\nlook at the bottom.\n\n304\n00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.588\nIf you look at the bottom of my page.\n\n305\n00:14:51.588 --> 00:14:53.620\n&gt;&gt; It's so tiny.\n&gt;&gt; It is super tiny.\n\n306\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.262\nBut there is a link, let's do this,\nlet's just click on the link, and\n\n307\n00:14:57.262 --> 00:14:59.097\nlet's see where the link takes us.\n\n308\n00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:00.461\nThis will help.\n\n309\n00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:04.175\nHovering over them, a lot of times it'll\npop up sometimes at the bottom of your\n\n310\n00:15:04.175 --> 00:15:07.292\nscreen, but if you look here,\nthis does not say facebook.com.\n\n311\n00:15:07.292 --> 00:15:08.355\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n312\n00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:12.485\n&gt;&gt; Now this can be crafted to look\nmore like Facebook, that is possible,\n\n313\n00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:15.084\nbut it doesn't hurt to\nlook in your URL box.\n\n314\n00:15:15.084 --> 00:15:17.489\n&gt;&gt; Verify,\ndoes that look like Facebook.com?\n\n315\n00:15:17.489 --> 00:15:19.799\nNo, that's not Facebook.com at all.\n\n316\n00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:25.646\nOr maybe it's, if it says anything\nreally other https://www.facebook.com or\n\n317\n00:15:25.646 --> 00:15:28.988\n/login, you're probably\nat the wrong place.\n\n318\n00:15:28.988 --> 00:15:31.434\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou can see right there, I mean,\n\n319\n00:15:31.434 --> 00:15:33.761\nit's got an IP address instead of a name.\n\n320\n00:15:33.761 --> 00:15:34.556\nThat's a red flag.\n\n321\n00:15:34.556 --> 00:15:35.945\nIt's not secure.\n\n322\n00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:39.520\nIt doesn't even have, who would have\na login form that was not secure?\n\n323\n00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.212\nThat's another red flag.\n\n324\n00:15:41.212 --> 00:15:45.275\nA misspelling in the name, a lot of times\nyou might be trying to go to Facebook and\n\n325\n00:15:45.275 --> 00:15:47.111\nit's just spelled slighty wrong.\n\n326\n00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:49.929\nInstead of B-O-O-K,\nit's B-O-A-K or something.\n\n327\n00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:51.437\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You might glance across and\n\n328\n00:15:51.437 --> 00:15:52.649\nnot even notice that.\n\n329\n00:15:52.649 --> 00:15:55.238\nBut they've registered\na name that's very similar.\n\n330\n00:15:55.238 --> 00:15:58.606\nA lot of attacks take that form, so\nby floating your mouse over the link,\n\n331\n00:15:58.606 --> 00:16:00.386\nyou can see where you're about to go.\n\n332\n00:16:00.386 --> 00:16:02.973\nWithout actually going there,\nthat's the best way to do it,\n\n333\n00:16:02.973 --> 00:16:05.014\nbecause sometimes you can\npull up the website and\n\n334\n00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:08.022\nthere can be other malicious tabs that\nare just part of the page itself.\n\n335\n00:16:08.022 --> 00:16:12.428\nBut here, we've already clicked on it,\nwe still get a few indicators,\n\n336\n00:16:12.428 --> 00:16:16.341\na few warning signs to let us know\nthat this is not the right site.\n\n337\n00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:19.127\nAnd so here, when you punch in\nyour user name and password,\n\n338\n00:16:19.127 --> 00:16:21.772\nthat's what's making it go\nto Daniel's evil server.\n\n339\n00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:24.997\nAnd he just has the evil server set up,\nso that once it fails,\n\n340\n00:16:24.997 --> 00:16:27.163\nit just takes you to the real page again.\n\n341\n00:16:27.163 --> 00:16:30.543\nSo that's why, after he logged in, the\naddress bar did say Facebook, and it did,\n\n342\n00:16:30.543 --> 00:16:33.176\nactually I didn't pay attention,\nwas it secure at that point?\n\n343\n00:16:33.176 --> 00:16:34.134\n&gt;&gt; Yea, it was secure.\n\n344\n00:16:34.134 --> 00:16:36.660\nIt was the actual Facebook\nlogin page at that point.\n\n345\n00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.237\nSuper smart of the attacking system\nto redirect once it's gathered\n\n346\n00:16:40.237 --> 00:16:41.248\nthe credentials.\n\n347\n00:16:41.248 --> 00:16:42.693\nWhat does it need you for anymore?\n\n348\n00:16:42.693 --> 00:16:46.021\nJust go ahead and login to your Facebook\npage, and you're none the wiser.\n\n349\n00:16:46.021 --> 00:16:49.812\nIt actually helps them continue in\nthe deception, because you feel like,\n\n350\n00:16:49.812 --> 00:16:53.671\nI must have just typed my password in\nincorrectly, or something to that effect.\n\n351\n00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:55.986\nSo you do it again and\nyou log in and you're good to go.\n\n352\n00:16:55.986 --> 00:16:59.050\nEven if you did actually type\nyour password in incorrectly,\n\n353\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.651\nI've got a pretty good idea of what\nit's supposed to be and then I can use\n\n354\n00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:06.759\nthe computer to try iterations of your\npassword if what you typed was incorrect.\n\n355\n00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:07.268\nSo.\n\n356\n00:17:07.268 --> 00:17:08.623\n&gt;&gt; And for companies like Facebook,\n\n357\n00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:11.340\nthe real challenge here is that\nthey can control their environment.\n\n358\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.810\nThey can make sure their log\nin fields are secure and\n\n359\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.562\nthat your passwords are stored safely,\nbut they don't control your email.\n\n360\n00:17:17.562 --> 00:17:19.432\nThey'd love to, but they don't.\n\n361\n00:17:19.432 --> 00:17:22.747\nSo, when you get an email\nthat says it's from Facebook,\n\n362\n00:17:22.747 --> 00:17:24.831\nFacebook's not involved in that.\n\n363\n00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:27.011\nIt's between you and that email.\n\n364\n00:17:27.011 --> 00:17:30.524\nSo as an end user, you've gotta get\nin the habit of being cautious,\n\n365\n00:17:30.524 --> 00:17:34.302\nbeing doubtful of an email's authenticity\nand being able to verify it.\n\n366\n00:17:34.302 --> 00:17:36.902\nAnd there are ways out there to\ndo like digital signatures and\n\n367\n00:17:36.902 --> 00:17:40.167\nways to test whether an email is\nauthentic, but they're all very complex.\n\n368\n00:17:40.167 --> 00:17:43.399\nAnd so talk to your IT department about\nwhether you can leverage those, but\n\n369\n00:17:43.399 --> 00:17:46.220\neven if you don't have those methods,\nif you just take a moment,\n\n370\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.630\ndo a little scrutiny,\napply a little doubt to an email,\n\n371\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.487\na lot of times you can determine\nwhether it's legitimate or not.\n\n372\n00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:56.066\nAnd that's really important, because this\nis a extremely common form of attack.\n\n373\n00:17:56.066 --> 00:18:00.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of my favorite things to do\nis, anytime someone sends me a link to any\n\n374\n00:18:00.035 --> 00:18:03.184\nkind of page, especially when\nit looks like, please log in.\n\n375\n00:18:03.184 --> 00:18:05.956\nMaybe it's your bank, maybe it's DHL,\n\n376\n00:18:05.956 --> 00:18:10.805\nor UPS log in to verify tracking\ninformation, we see those a lot as well.\n\n377\n00:18:10.805 --> 00:18:15.768\nI will actually go to my browser, type\nit in instead of following links because\n\n378\n00:18:15.768 --> 00:18:18.490\nthose links can be very, very dangerous.\n\n379\n00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.362\nA lot of systems will just not allow\nyou to follow links inside of them.\n\n380\n00:18:22.362 --> 00:18:25.762\nBut if you're using your own personal\nmail, something like that, was a web mail\n\n381\n00:18:25.762 --> 00:18:29.077\nsystem, there's no administration\nprobably will stop you from doing that.\n\n382\n00:18:29.077 --> 00:18:30.573\nSo that's where we gotta be careful.\n\n383\n00:18:30.573 --> 00:18:32.379\nHover to discover over to those links.\n\n384\n00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:35.149\nTry to see if they take you\nanywhere that looks suspicious.\n\n385\n00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:37.404\nBe very scrutinous when\nyou're looking at them.\n\n386\n00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:41.231\nAnd if at all possible, just type in\nthe URL to where you're supposed to go, or\n\n387\n00:18:41.231 --> 00:18:42.744\nwhere you think you should go.\n\n388\n00:18:42.744 --> 00:18:43.696\nLog in and see if there's any trouble.\n\n389\n00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:44.237\nRight?\n\n390\n00:18:44.237 --> 00:18:47.493\nAnd you can also just Google,\nhas Facebook had issues?\n\n391\n00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:51.479\nThere actually were, maybe there is\na fishing attack that's happening\n\n392\n00:18:51.479 --> 00:18:55.807\nis very common and a Google search would\ndefinitely show that up very quickly.\n\n393\n00:18:55.807 --> 00:18:58.094\nHey, be on look out for\nthis Facebook attack.\n\n394\n00:18:58.094 --> 00:19:04.384\nLet's talk about actual physical\ncontact with a social engineer.\n\n395\n00:19:04.384 --> 00:19:08.312\nThis is something that, as we said,\nprobably not happening a ton but\n\n396\n00:19:08.312 --> 00:19:09.278\nit does happen.\n\n397\n00:19:09.278 --> 00:19:12.536\nSo we do want to make sure that\nwe are on the look out for that.\n\n398\n00:19:12.536 --> 00:19:17.037\nAnd this can come in the arena of maybe\nthrough voice, or actual physical,\n\n399\n00:19:17.037 --> 00:19:21.192\nhuman, you're standing in the room\nwith them having interaction.\n\n400\n00:19:21.192 --> 00:19:23.360\nSo we wanna take a look\nat both of those things.\n\n401\n00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.410\nThis can come through phone contact.\n\n402\n00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.831\nI can call you up and\nsay I'm with such and such organization or\n\n403\n00:19:29.831 --> 00:19:35.455\nmaybe a business that you do business\nwith, maybe its that kind of company.\n\n404\n00:19:35.455 --> 00:19:38.989\nYeah, you are our provider for\ninternet service.\n\n405\n00:19:38.989 --> 00:19:41.950\nAnd I call and say, yes,\nI'm your ISP provider.\n\n406\n00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.995\nWe seem to be having a little trouble\nwith your connection specifically.\n\n407\n00:19:44.995 --> 00:19:48.709\nWant to make sure that you have the\nhighest quality of connection possible.\n\n408\n00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:52.054\nSo we're gonna do some test and we're\ngonna need you to log in this system and\n\n409\n00:19:52.054 --> 00:19:55.420\nI need to log in from this side too just\nto verify everything is looking good.\n\n410\n00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.201\nAnd give me your username and password\nreally quickly, let me just login as you,\n\n411\n00:19:59.201 --> 00:20:01.716\nso that everything looks as\nit would if you were here.\n\n412\n00:20:01.716 --> 00:20:03.978\nJust wanna make sure\nthat stuff is happening.\n\n413\n00:20:03.978 --> 00:20:07.474\nIt's a real easy way,\nyou saw how subtle it was and\n\n414\n00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:12.565\nhow easily I just kind of spoke with\nauthority, I spoke with knowledge.\n\n415\n00:20:12.565 --> 00:20:17.100\nI seem to have all the right words and\nno flubbing of my voice.\n\n416\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:22.438\nThere was no hint of deception, I just\neasily threw it out there, and I might\n\n417\n00:20:22.438 --> 00:20:28.127\nget one out of 100 users that would say,\nyeah, let me give you my username.\n\n418\n00:20:28.127 --> 00:20:31.628\nIt's Diana@ourcompany.com.\n\n419\n00:20:31.628 --> 00:20:33.975\nPassword is superpass123.\n\n420\n00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:35.380\nOkay, great, thanks.\n\n421\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.980\nYes.\nPerfect, Diana.\n\n422\n00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:37.803\nEverything was looking fantastic.\n\n423\n00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:39.658\nWe are logged in.\n\n424\n00:20:39.658 --> 00:20:40.767\nYour connection is secure.\n\n425\n00:20:40.767 --> 00:20:41.637\nI'm gonna move onto the next one.\n\n426\n00:20:41.637 --> 00:20:42.664\nThank you so much for your time.\n\n427\n00:20:42.664 --> 00:20:43.405\nHave a great day.\n\n428\n00:20:43.405 --> 00:20:45.092\nAnd off to the races.\n\n429\n00:20:45.092 --> 00:20:46.121\nNow I have a username and password.\n\n430\n00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:47.396\nI can log into this system.\n\n431\n00:20:47.396 --> 00:20:50.732\nAnd like I said if I got 1 out of 100,\nI got 1 out of a thousand.\n\n432\n00:20:50.732 --> 00:20:51.883\nI have access.\n\n433\n00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:56.506\nIt doesn't matter as long as one person\nfalls for the lure I get in, I can get in,\n\n434\n00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:58.793\nso that's how you've gotta look out.\n\n435\n00:20:58.793 --> 00:21:02.162\nMake sure that those phone conversations\nno one is ever gonna ask you for\n\n436\n00:21:02.162 --> 00:21:05.488\na user name or password to log into\nanything as you admins have access.\n\n437\n00:21:05.488 --> 00:21:07.794\n&gt;&gt; You know, they can even get\na little more sophisticated.\n\n438\n00:21:07.794 --> 00:21:09.861\nBecause people are becoming more educated,\nand they know,\n\n439\n00:21:09.861 --> 00:21:11.330\n'I shouldn't be sharing my password'.\n\n440\n00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.946\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n441\n00:21:11.946 --> 00:21:15.707\n&gt;&gt; I've seen one, or heard one where what\nthey did was that you walk up to the lobby\n\n442\n00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:18.857\nof a business, and people had\ntheir business cards in the lobby.\n\n443\n00:21:18.857 --> 00:21:20.607\nSo you just grab a business card for\nan employee,\n\n444\n00:21:20.607 --> 00:21:22.022\nwhoever it is that you're targeting.\n\n445\n00:21:22.022 --> 00:21:24.367\nAnd you can go back out to your car and\nyou can call their number.\n\n446\n00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:28.132\nAnd when you call you just say,\nhi, I'm with the IT department and\n\n447\n00:21:28.132 --> 00:21:32.505\nwe've noticed some what looks like\nmalicious activity with your account and\n\n448\n00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:34.873\nwe need to make sure your account is safe.\n\n449\n00:21:34.873 --> 00:21:38.298\nWe want to verify, now don't tell me your\npassword, because you shouldn't be handing\n\n450\n00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:40.750\nthat out, but I just need to verify\nthat your account is okay and\n\n451\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.823\ncan you verify what's your\nmother's maiden name?\n\n452\n00:21:42.823 --> 00:21:43.441\nRight.\n\n453\n00:21:43.441 --> 00:21:45.503\nA lot of accounts have a password reset.\n\n454\n00:21:45.503 --> 00:21:48.467\nAnd when you do a password reset,\nit'll ask you for a verification question.\n\n455\n00:21:48.467 --> 00:21:50.254\nWell, if an attacker can\nreset your password,\n\n456\n00:21:50.254 --> 00:21:52.005\nthey don't need to know\nwhat the password is.\n\n457\n00:21:52.005 --> 00:21:54.786\nBut if they can figure out\nyour verification question,\n\n458\n00:21:54.786 --> 00:21:56.864\nthat will give them the answer they need.\n\n459\n00:21:56.864 --> 00:21:58.879\nAnd so they might call and ask for that.\n\n460\n00:21:58.879 --> 00:22:00.816\nYou don't wanna hand that\nout on the phone either.\n\n461\n00:22:00.816 --> 00:22:04.162\nAnd where we really get a challenge on\nthose verification questions is when we\n\n462\n00:22:04.162 --> 00:22:05.820\npick ones that are easy to figure out.\n\n463\n00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.741\nIf you have a public Facebook page,\nthen people can find who your mother is or\n\n464\n00:22:09.741 --> 00:22:10.967\nyour wife or whatever,\n\n465\n00:22:10.967 --> 00:22:14.724\nthey start to get that information\nthey can use to guess the right value.\n\n466\n00:22:14.724 --> 00:22:18.426\nAnd it's all a part of giving\nout too much information.\n\n467\n00:22:18.426 --> 00:22:23.529\nI actually received a fishing call a few\nyears ago where the call went like this.\n\n468\n00:22:23.529 --> 00:22:29.282\nThey said, hello I'm, I can't remember\nthe name, but I'm Tina I'm a 911 operator.\n\n469\n00:22:29.282 --> 00:22:31.835\nI'm calling in response to\na call that you just placed.\n\n470\n00:22:31.835 --> 00:22:34.916\nAnd I said well I didn't call 911.\n\n471\n00:22:34.916 --> 00:22:39.140\nAnd they said you must have accidentally\ncalled because cell phones have that\n\n472\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.187\nemergency thing.\n\n473\n00:22:40.187 --> 00:22:44.086\nAnd I said, I don't think so,\nand she said no, we need find\n\n474\n00:22:44.086 --> 00:22:48.924\nout whether we need to dispatch police or\nnot, can you verify who you are?\n\n475\n00:22:48.924 --> 00:22:51.434\nAnd I said, well you called me,\nyou know who I am.\n\n476\n00:22:51.434 --> 00:22:52.916\nAnd she said sir, this is 911.\n\n477\n00:22:52.916 --> 00:22:54.500\nYou know you need to verify who you are,\n\n478\n00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.329\ncan you give me your\nsocial security number?\n\n479\n00:22:56.329 --> 00:22:58.845\nAnd that's when I knew\nimmediately that it was a scam,\n\n480\n00:22:58.845 --> 00:23:01.648\nbecause 911 doesn't need\nyour social security number.\n\n481\n00:23:01.648 --> 00:23:05.247\nBut by doing that,\nby creating that false sense of urgency.\n\n482\n00:23:05.247 --> 00:23:08.822\nWe're 911,\nyou need to tell us what we need or\n\n483\n00:23:08.822 --> 00:23:13.464\nwe're sending police or fire or\nwhoever it is out to that area.\n\n484\n00:23:13.464 --> 00:23:16.620\nThat's what a good social engineer can\ndo to create that sense of urgency,\n\n485\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.341\nmaking you feel rushed,\nlike you need to get that information.\n\n486\n00:23:19.341 --> 00:23:21.075\nSo it's a very sophisticated attack.\n\n487\n00:23:21.075 --> 00:23:24.383\nEven though it doesn't\nnecessarily involve a computer,\n\n488\n00:23:24.383 --> 00:23:27.835\nit's still very sophisticated and\nincredibly effective.\n\n489\n00:23:27.835 --> 00:23:29.491\n&gt;&gt; And Don, you hit on a very\nimportant part of this topic,\n\n490\n00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:30.631\nwhen it comes to social engineering.\n\n491\n00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:33.222\nWhat do they impersonate,\nwho do they pretend to be?\n\n492\n00:23:33.222 --> 00:23:38.692\nPeople of authority, people in the know,\npeople that have the ability to,\n\n493\n00:23:38.692 --> 00:23:41.944\nlike Don said,\nimply that sense of urgency.\n\n494\n00:23:41.944 --> 00:23:42.682\nWe need to do this.\n\n495\n00:23:42.682 --> 00:23:43.425\nWe need to do this now.\n\n496\n00:23:43.425 --> 00:23:44.452\nWe need to get this done.\n\n497\n00:23:44.452 --> 00:23:45.192\nThis is very important.\n\n498\n00:23:45.192 --> 00:23:47.741\nAnd they'll use a threat or\nreprise, maybe.\n\n499\n00:23:47.741 --> 00:23:53.759\nAny kind of anxiety that they can build\ninside of you to just be compliant,\n\n500\n00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:56.296\nthey will attempt to use that.\n\n501\n00:23:56.296 --> 00:24:00.164\nAnd it's very hard because\nthat anxiety does build up.\n\n502\n00:24:00.164 --> 00:24:01.020\nYou do feel it.\n\n503\n00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.799\nIt is real, because they are They're\nframing it, they're building it inside of\n\n504\n00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:08.761\nyou, so that you'll just go, just make one\nmistake, just need to make one mistake.\n\n505\n00:24:08.761 --> 00:24:11.639\nSo if you can stay cool, look for\nbuzzwords, like Don said.\n\n506\n00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:13.204\nSomebody asks for\na Social Security number,\n\n507\n00:24:13.204 --> 00:24:14.858\nwhat do you need my social\nsecurity number for?\n\n508\n00:24:14.858 --> 00:24:16.548\nThat's a very sensitive\npiece of information.\n\n509\n00:24:16.548 --> 00:24:18.032\nCuz what are they after?\n\n510\n00:24:18.032 --> 00:24:19.303\nSensitive information.\n\n511\n00:24:19.303 --> 00:24:23.930\nIf someone contacts you and starts\nasking you about sensitive information,\n\n512\n00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.697\nyou need to verify that they are who they\nsay they are before any information ever\n\n513\n00:24:28.697 --> 00:24:29.717\ngets given out.\n\n514\n00:24:29.717 --> 00:24:33.876\nSo if you have any doubt at all, if\nthere's any even modicum of doubt in your\n\n515\n00:24:33.876 --> 00:24:37.787\nmind, say, okay, it sounds like\nyou really need this information.\n\n516\n00:24:37.787 --> 00:24:42.554\nI'm going to verify who you are by asking\nsomeone above me in authority that would\n\n517\n00:24:42.554 --> 00:24:46.987\nknow that this is somebody that I need\nto be giving that information out to.\n\n518\n00:24:46.987 --> 00:24:49.975\nOtherwise, I'm not giving you anything,\nbecause, and\n\n519\n00:24:49.975 --> 00:24:52.846\nyou should encourage me to do\nthat to verify who you are.\n\n520\n00:24:52.846 --> 00:24:57.795\nBecause people that are legitimate go,\nyes, we understand that this is personally\n\n521\n00:24:57.795 --> 00:25:02.430\nidentifiable information, maybe\nhealthcare information, bank information.\n\n522\n00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.969\nAnd that's not something that you\nshould readily be giving out.\n\n523\n00:25:05.969 --> 00:25:09.142\nUsernames and passwords, not something\nyou should ever readily be giving out.\n\n524\n00:25:09.142 --> 00:25:12.933\nWanna keep those under lock and\nkey, so definitely go verify me.\n\n525\n00:25:12.933 --> 00:25:16.507\nIf you don't hear those types of words\ncoming out of those mouths, you should\n\n526\n00:25:16.507 --> 00:25:20.430\nhave red flags going off all over your\nbrain, saying warning, warning, warning.\n\n527\n00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.473\nThere might be something off,\nand maybe there's not.\n\n528\n00:25:23.473 --> 00:25:26.488\nBut that verification sure as heck\nain't gonna hurt you to go and try and\n\n529\n00:25:26.488 --> 00:25:28.461\ndo to make sure they are who they are,\nverify.\n\n530\n00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:32.903\n&gt;&gt; All right, now if I get an email,\nI got tons of time to verify,\n\n531\n00:25:32.903 --> 00:25:34.277\nI can take my time.\n\n532\n00:25:34.277 --> 00:25:36.131\nI can send the email to\nmy IT department and\n\n533\n00:25:36.131 --> 00:25:38.737\nget them to look at it just to\nget a second opinion, right?\n\n534\n00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:39.490\nYou can do that with email.\n\n535\n00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.830\nWhen you're on the phone,\n\n536\n00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.395\nit's not like you can go grab a second\nperson while you're on the phone.\n\n537\n00:25:44.395 --> 00:25:47.165\nTime is a little more of the essence but\nyou can still do your due diligence.\n\n538\n00:25:47.165 --> 00:25:48.693\nCuz worst case scenario, you just hang up.\n\n539\n00:25:48.693 --> 00:25:50.039\nAnd you say, you know what?\n\n540\n00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:51.442\nLet me call you back.\n\n541\n00:25:51.442 --> 00:25:53.647\nYou said you're from the IT department,\nlet me hang up and call you back.\n\n542\n00:25:53.647 --> 00:25:57.018\nBecause you can fake caller ID very easy.\n\n543\n00:25:57.018 --> 00:26:00.230\nBut if you call the IT department and\nthat person's not there,\n\n544\n00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.750\nthen you just defeated that.\n\n545\n00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:02.781\nSo by phone, it's easy.\n\n546\n00:26:02.781 --> 00:26:04.847\nBut what about in person?\n\n547\n00:26:04.847 --> 00:26:08.226\nWhat if I've got a person physically\nstanding in front of me, and\n\n548\n00:26:08.226 --> 00:26:10.259\nwe're running through this routine?\n\n549\n00:26:10.259 --> 00:26:11.372\nWhat does that look like?\n\n550\n00:26:11.372 --> 00:26:15.022\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question,\nbecause when it is in person,\n\n551\n00:26:15.022 --> 00:26:19.228\nthis is where it can become so much of\na social anxiety to you that you cave.\n\n552\n00:26:19.228 --> 00:26:23.719\nAnd this is where we want you to be\nstrong, because these people will go so\n\n553\n00:26:23.719 --> 00:26:26.903\nfar as to, you can go online and\nbuy a police badge.\n\n554\n00:26:26.903 --> 00:26:30.533\nYou can have a fake badge made online and\nhave it shipped to your house.\n\n555\n00:26:30.533 --> 00:26:34.468\nEven if it's not perfect, I don't\nknow what a perfect badge looks like,\n\n556\n00:26:34.468 --> 00:26:36.510\nbecause I'm not in law enforcement.\n\n557\n00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.487\nI don't deal with law enforcement.\n\n558\n00:26:38.487 --> 00:26:42.524\nThey will buy uniforms, and\ncome up and say, we're with your ISP.\n\n559\n00:26:42.524 --> 00:26:46.764\nAnd they've got Cox, or\nClear Channel, or Broad, whoever,\n\n560\n00:26:46.764 --> 00:26:51.723\nlocal ISP that you guys deal with cuz\nthey've done their due diligence and\n\n561\n00:26:51.723 --> 00:26:54.287\nresearch, who is their ISP company?\n\n562\n00:26:54.287 --> 00:26:59.505\nMaybe they work with Iron Mountain\nto send offsite backups.\n\n563\n00:26:59.505 --> 00:27:00.581\nThey'll get an Iron Mountain coat.\n\n564\n00:27:00.581 --> 00:27:04.530\nJust buy the same coat and\ngo have the logo embroidered.\n\n565\n00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.962\nGet a van, stick a sticker on the side,\none of those magnetic jobs.\n\n566\n00:27:07.962 --> 00:27:10.385\nAnd they'll pull up, man, looking legit.\n\n567\n00:27:10.385 --> 00:27:14.083\nBut what's the telltale sign?\n\n568\n00:27:14.083 --> 00:27:18.917\nIf everything from head to toe is looking\nspot-on, and they start asking, hey,\n\n569\n00:27:18.917 --> 00:27:21.240\nI've got all this network equipment.\n\n570\n00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.724\nI'm with your ISP, I need to come in.\n\n571\n00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:24.287\nCould you key me into the closet?\n\n572\n00:27:24.287 --> 00:27:27.908\nI would go, remember our tailgating\nattack from the beginning of the show?\n\n573\n00:27:27.908 --> 00:27:30.626\nThey still employ the same tactics.\n\n574\n00:27:30.626 --> 00:27:35.650\nThey ask for sensitive access and\nthey ask for sensitive information without\n\n575\n00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:40.448\nany real authentication to who they are,\nother than what they seem to be.\n\n576\n00:27:40.448 --> 00:27:43.673\nThey'll never try to\nactually verify themselves.\n\n577\n00:27:43.673 --> 00:27:45.761\nIt's up to us to go, that's great.\n\n578\n00:27:45.761 --> 00:27:48.525\nLet me walk you over\nhere to the front desk.\n\n579\n00:27:48.525 --> 00:27:52.353\nAnd let's get somebody that can get\nyou that access because I don't have\n\n580\n00:27:52.353 --> 00:27:53.997\nthe authorization to do that.\n\n581\n00:27:53.997 --> 00:27:57.986\n&gt;&gt; There was a high-profile case a few\nyears ago where a guy would be basically\n\n582\n00:27:57.986 --> 00:28:01.025\ndressed up in one of those\none-piece service uniforms,\n\n583\n00:28:01.025 --> 00:28:03.191\nkind of like what a mechanic would wear.\n\n584\n00:28:03.191 --> 00:28:06.020\nAnd he had a little name badge worked\nup that had his picture on it.\n\n585\n00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.653\nAnd he said that he was\nwith Dell Computer.\n\n586\n00:28:09.653 --> 00:28:13.844\nAnd he would go to businesses,\nbig skyscrapers, right, large enterprises.\n\n587\n00:28:13.844 --> 00:28:15.446\nHe would go at lunchtime.\n\n588\n00:28:15.446 --> 00:28:17.306\nAnd he would walk up to the front and\nhe'd say,\n\n589\n00:28:17.306 --> 00:28:19.272\nI've got to go fix a computer\non the fifth floor.\n\n590\n00:28:19.272 --> 00:28:22.230\nAnd he'd go up to the fifth floor,\nor the 50th floor, or wherever.\n\n591\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.957\nAnd it was lunch time, people would leave.\n\n592\n00:28:23.957 --> 00:28:26.021\nAnd so most of the offices were empty.\n\n593\n00:28:26.021 --> 00:28:29.647\nAnd he would walk around and he would\njust grab laptops right off of the desks.\n\n594\n00:28:29.647 --> 00:28:30.677\nThey've got video footage of this.\n\n595\n00:28:30.677 --> 00:28:31.893\nThe guy is just walking around.\n\n596\n00:28:31.893 --> 00:28:33.173\nHe would get ten laptops.\n\n597\n00:28:33.173 --> 00:28:35.518\nHe had a little cart, and\nhe'd stack them up and he'd walk out.\n\n598\n00:28:35.518 --> 00:28:38.436\nAnd if anybody stopped and asked,\nhe would say, I'm with Dell.\n\n599\n00:28:38.436 --> 00:28:39.626\nI have to do these warranty repairs.\n\n600\n00:28:39.626 --> 00:28:41.771\nWe'll get them fixed and\nget them sent back.\n\n601\n00:28:41.771 --> 00:28:42.602\nIt was during lunch, so\n\n602\n00:28:42.602 --> 00:28:45.318\nthe people who actually owned the\nequipment weren't there to challenge it.\n\n603\n00:28:45.318 --> 00:28:48.712\nAnd everyone else in the hallway just\nassumed that somebody else was doing\n\n604\n00:28:48.712 --> 00:28:51.847\nthe verification, like somebody\nelse must have cleared this guy.\n\n605\n00:28:51.847 --> 00:28:53.737\nAnd he would walk out.\n\n606\n00:28:53.737 --> 00:28:56.863\nHe would take the laptops, format them,\nand then sell them on eBay.\n\n607\n00:28:56.863 --> 00:28:59.293\nHe'd usually steal them\nwithout the power adapter, so\n\n608\n00:28:59.293 --> 00:29:01.888\nhe was just bulk-buying power adapters and\nselling them.\n\n609\n00:29:01.888 --> 00:29:06.261\nAnd they finally caught him because\nthere was a company that had LoJacks, so\n\n610\n00:29:06.261 --> 00:29:09.212\nlittle tracking devices\nin each of their laptops.\n\n611\n00:29:09.212 --> 00:29:11.890\nA lot of newer laptops\nhave that functionality.\n\n612\n00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.941\nAnd when he took them back to his\napartment to format them, well,\n\n613\n00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:18.821\nthey would reach out to the Internet for\nupdates, and the LoJack would phone home,\n\n614\n00:29:18.821 --> 00:29:20.329\nand they were able to catch him.\n\n615\n00:29:20.329 --> 00:29:24.219\nHe had over 100 laptops in his apartment,\nhad already sold thousands.\n\n616\n00:29:24.219 --> 00:29:26.109\nThis guy was really just a machine.\n\n617\n00:29:26.109 --> 00:29:29.484\nAnd it was all based on the idea that\nwhen you're walking down the hallway and\n\n618\n00:29:29.484 --> 00:29:31.716\nyou're wearing a uniform\nnobody questions you.\n\n619\n00:29:31.716 --> 00:29:34.300\nIf you're wearing a UPS uniform and\nyou're carrying boxes,\n\n620\n00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.892\nthose boxes might have been empty when you\ncame in, and they're full on your way out.\n\n621\n00:29:37.892 --> 00:29:40.097\nBut nobody asks because\nyou're the UPS guy, right?\n\n622\n00:29:40.097 --> 00:29:41.902\nBut we've got to make sure\nthat we verify that and\n\n623\n00:29:41.902 --> 00:29:43.808\nthat we know those people\nare who they say they are.\n\n624\n00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:46.516\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that would be my\nlast piece of advice here for\n\n625\n00:29:46.516 --> 00:29:49.067\nthis show is don't be afraid\nto challenge someone.\n\n626\n00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:52.130\nIf you see someone in your area,\nyou know your job,\n\n627\n00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:56.047\nyou know who's going to be around\nyour specific piece of business\n\n628\n00:29:56.047 --> 00:29:59.200\nthat you do inside of your company or\norganization.\n\n629\n00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.734\nIf you see somebody that you're\nnot familiar with, walk up, hey,\n\n630\n00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:03.668\nhow's it going?\n\n631\n00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:06.070\nWho are you, and what are you here for?\n\n632\n00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.268\nAnd they'll say, I'm with UPS.\n\n633\n00:30:07.268 --> 00:30:12.407\nI'm here to pick up some of these laptops,\nor drop this off, or whatever the scam is.\n\n634\n00:30:12.407 --> 00:30:15.694\nAnd you go, great, let me just\ncall the front desk and verify.\n\n635\n00:30:15.694 --> 00:30:17.488\nDo you have a visitor's pass?\n\n636\n00:30:17.488 --> 00:30:21.764\nDo you have any kind of verification that\nyou should be where you're at right now?\n\n637\n00:30:21.764 --> 00:30:24.891\nBecause if you don't, we need to contact\nsomebody and you need to stay right here.\n\n638\n00:30:24.891 --> 00:30:26.415\nSo don't be afraid to challenge them.\n\n639\n00:30:26.415 --> 00:30:28.883\nPeople that are legitimate,\nthey'll say, yeah, no problem.\n\n640\n00:30:28.883 --> 00:30:30.569\nHere's my visitor's pass right here.\n\n641\n00:30:30.569 --> 00:30:33.524\nOr, please go ahead, call the front desk.\n\n642\n00:30:33.524 --> 00:30:36.375\nOr, go ahead, talk to Suzy,\nshe's your boss, she's right over there.\n\n643\n00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:38.516\nGreat, yeah, let me go, all right.\n\n644\n00:30:38.516 --> 00:30:40.076\nSuzy, is that person?\n\n645\n00:30:40.076 --> 00:30:42.161\nSure is, they're here to do such and such.\n\n646\n00:30:42.161 --> 00:30:44.435\nFantastic, so\ndon't be afraid to challenge.\n\n647\n00:30:44.435 --> 00:30:48.830\nIt's our human nature to not want to\nthrow a rock in the pond of still waters.\n\n648\n00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.723\nAnd that's how it can feel.\n\n649\n00:30:50.723 --> 00:30:53.241\nAnd that's the environment\nthat they want to create,\n\n650\n00:30:53.241 --> 00:30:56.373\nis that you don't want to do that,\nand that those waters are still.\n\n651\n00:30:56.373 --> 00:30:58.401\nWhen really they are as crashy and\n\n652\n00:30:58.401 --> 00:31:01.961\nwavy as a thunderstorm happening\non the open sea, right?\n\n653\n00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:05.116\nSo be on the lookout,\ndon't be afraid to challenge.\n\n654\n00:31:05.116 --> 00:31:09.237\nLook out for people asking for\nsensitive information, and\n\n655\n00:31:09.237 --> 00:31:11.551\ndon't judge a book by its cover.\n\n656\n00:31:11.551 --> 00:31:12.672\nAlways make sure and\n\n657\n00:31:12.672 --> 00:31:16.770\nverify people are who they say before\ngiving out any kind of information.\n\n658\n00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you're not\ncomfortable challenging somebody,\n\n659\n00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:20.897\nreach out to somebody else, right?\n\n660\n00:31:20.897 --> 00:31:22.542\nYou can always get your\nIT department to verify.\n\n661\n00:31:22.542 --> 00:31:24.073\nIf you have a security department,\nreach out to them.\n\n662\n00:31:24.073 --> 00:31:26.218\nJust find somebody else,\nget a second person.\n\n663\n00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:29.600\nYou might see that UPS guy\nwalking down the hall.\n\n664\n00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.721\nAnd so you call up your boss, your\nsupervisor, or somebody else, and you say,\n\n665\n00:31:33.721 --> 00:31:36.075\nI just saw a UPS person,\ncan you verify them?\n\n666\n00:31:36.075 --> 00:31:39.205\nAnd let somebody else, but\ndon't just ignore it, right?\n\n667\n00:31:39.205 --> 00:31:42.122\nCuz if enough people ignore it,\nthen the attack succeeds.\n\n668\n00:31:42.122 --> 00:31:45.131\nThat's what social engineering is all\nabout, is people not challenging.\n\n669\n00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:47.606\nAll right, well, Daniel, I think\nthat's probably a pretty good spot for\n\n670\n00:31:47.606 --> 00:31:48.246\nus to wrap this up.\n\n671\n00:31:48.246 --> 00:31:48.989\nDid you have any parting words?\n\n672\n00:31:48.989 --> 00:31:50.722\nI think you really summed\nthings up pretty well.\n\n673\n00:31:50.722 --> 00:31:53.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was it,\njust make sure anybody's asking for\n\n674\n00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:56.938\nsensitive information, don't give it out\nwithout verification of who they are.\n\n675\n00:31:56.938 --> 00:31:58.752\nAnd look out for those phishing emails.\n\n676\n00:31:58.752 --> 00:32:01.621\nRemember, hover to discover,\nlook for those actual URLs.\n\n677\n00:32:01.621 --> 00:32:05.631\nWhen in doubt, type it in,\ndon't follow links.\n\n678\n00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:09.112\nAnd again, don't be afraid to challenge,\neither directly or indirectly.\n\n679\n00:32:09.112 --> 00:32:14.394\nThis will help us stay out of\na social engineer's crosshairs.\n\n680\n00:32:14.394 --> 00:32:16.735\n&gt;&gt; All right, ladies and gentlemen,\nwell, that's a good spot for\n\n681\n00:32:16.735 --> 00:32:17.553\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n682\n00:32:17.553 --> 00:32:19.698\nIn this episode, we got a chance to\nlearn a bit about social engineering.\n\n683\n00:32:19.698 --> 00:32:22.790\nWe saw the forms that it can take and\nthe ways that we can detect and\n\n684\n00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:23.778\nhelp prevent that.\n\n685\n00:32:23.778 --> 00:32:26.480\nIt is very important that we\npay attention to this one,\n\n686\n00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.908\ncuz it is such a hot button\nof security right now.\n\n687\n00:32:28.908 --> 00:32:31.836\nThis is a preferred attack method,\nso we got a good chance to see that.\n\n688\n00:32:31.836 --> 00:32:33.322\nDaniel, thank you for\nhelping us with all that.\n\n689\n00:32:33.322 --> 00:32:37.121\nAnd thank you all out there in TV land for\nwatching, I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n690\n00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:40.657\nStay tuned because we've got more\nend user security coming up.\n\n691\n00:32:40.657 --> 00:32:43.740\nBut for right now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet,\n\n692\n00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.770\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Daniel Lowrie.\n\n693\n00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.165\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n694\n00:32:46.165 --> 00:32:52.690\n[MUSIC]\n\n695\n00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:56.600\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You know I think that\nwould gonna be okay.\n\n5\n00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:15.939\n&gt;&gt; I wanna be a dolphin.\n\n6\n00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:16.715\n&gt;&gt; You can be a dolphin if you want.\n\n7\n00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:17.276\n&gt;&gt; Yes, swim around.\n\n8\n00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:21.048\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe definitely don't wanna be a phish.\n\n9\n00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:22.350\nWhat the heck am I talking about?\n\n10\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.947\nWhy is this spell like that, right.\n\n11\n00:00:23.947 --> 00:00:26.940\nYou might have seen this in the news or\nyour,\n\n12\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.660\nhopefully your organization has talked to\nyou about it, but phishing is a trick that\n\n13\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.010\nthe bad guys are gonna use to try\nto get you to submit information.\n\n14\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.430\nTry to steal information from you, or\ninfect your computer with a malware,\n\n15\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.330\nsome type of virus or worm that they\ncan then use to attack your company,\n\n16\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.600\nsteal your data or\nattack other machines on your network.\n\n17\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.470\nSo, in this episode what we want to\ntalk about is what phishing is, and\n\n18\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.740\nhow I can protect myself.\n\n19\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.750\nHow can I not be a phish, right?\n\n20\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.825\nSo, first let's talk about phishing.\n\n21\n00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:02.710\nThere's are actually\ndifferent levels of phishing.\n\n22\n00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.250\nWe were talking about\nthis before this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.370\nVonne thought I was just\nmaking this stuff up.\n\n24\n00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.740\nThere's phishing.\n\n25\n00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.000\nThere's spear phishing.\n\n26\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.740\nThere's whaling.\n\n27\n00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.610\nThese are all different\ntypes of phishing attacks.\n\n28\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.370\n&gt;&gt; I was waiting for\nyou to crack and start laughing.\n\n29\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.420\nI'm like no, you're serious.\n\n30\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.653\nYou're not kind of breaking\nout into a smile yet.\n\n31\n00:01:22.653 --> 00:01:23.840\nAnd I'm like, this is real.\n\n32\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is real, unfortunately.\n\n33\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.080\nWhen we talk about phishing,\nwhen they just use the word phishing,\n\n34\n00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.940\nit's a technique that the bad guys use.\n\n35\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.420\nThey just send out generic blanket\nemails to as many people as they can,\n\n36\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.580\nno care of who is actually\ngetting the emails.\n\n37\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.880\nIt's like sending out a cast net and\nthrowing it out there, pulling it back in,\n\n38\n00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.670\nand just seeing what you catch.\n\n39\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.760\nThat's general fishing, right?\n\n40\n00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.365\nThrowing out your hook, and yeah, I might\ncatch a bass, I might catch a brim,\n\n41\n00:01:49.365 --> 00:01:51.695\nI don't know what I'm gonna catch,\nbut hey, I'm fishing.\n\n42\n00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:55.225\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I remember one of those\nlike I'm a prince in another country and\n\n43\n00:01:55.225 --> 00:02:00.015\nI need money or I'm a relative in here and\nI need, send me money because I need help.\n\n44\n00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:00.575\nIs that something?\n\n45\n00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:03.525\n&gt;&gt; The Nigerian Prince was one of\nthe first ones, I think, that got a lot of\n\n46\n00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:07.915\nnotoriety and it woke people up to\nthe fact that this was going on.\n\n47\n00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:09.190\nSo that's phishing.\n\n48\n00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.890\nAnd then there's also something\nknown as spear phishing.\n\n49\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.060\nSpear fishing, if you think about it,\nright, if somebody is spear fishing\n\n50\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.110\nthey're being a little more particular\nabout what they're going after.\n\n51\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.220\nThey're not just throwing out a cast net.\n\n52\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.310\nNow they've got a spear and\n\n53\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.810\nthey're gonna find their target and\nthey're gonna go for it, right?\n\n54\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.510\nThis is when the bad guys\nare targeting maybe an organization.\n\n55\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.860\nThey're gonna send all these phishing\nemails, but only to ITProTV.\n\n56\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.180\nRight, they're focused on\none particular target.\n\n57\n00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.360\nIt could even be a subset of\nindividuals within an organization.\n\n58\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.560\nBut it's a much more focused attack.\n\n59\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.640\nAnd that the reason it's different\nit's usually the body of the email.\n\n60\n00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.030\nThe information will be a little more\nspecific to your organization or\n\n61\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.670\nto that subset of people\nwithin your organization.\n\n62\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.210\nCuz the end the goal is trying to get\nyou to click on something in the email.\n\n63\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.210\nSo if I can be a little more specific,\nmaybe I can get you.\n\n64\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.970\nYou might recognize that\ngeneric Nigerian prince.\n\n65\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.730\nI don't have any relatives over there,\nso it's probably not for me.\n\n66\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.720\nBut when you get one that says hey,\nyou need to update your password for\n\n67\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.699\nyour company portal.\n\n68\n00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.620\nThat's sound a little more realistic,\nright?\n\n69\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because we're an IT organization\nand they're talking about IT and\n\n70\n00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.470\nit might even look like it's from us,\nor for\n\n71\n00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.340\nsome organizations we might work with or\nbe associated with.\n\n72\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.740\nSo I would be more apt to maybe\nclick on something or read it or\n\n73\n00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.780\ndo whatever it's telling me to do.\n\n74\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, they're playing on your trust\nand they're trying to get you to say,\n\n75\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.670\nthis looks legitimate or not pay attention\nand even bother checking, right?\n\n76\n00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.590\nSo that's spear phishing,\nand then there's whaling.\n\n77\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.240\nAnd whaling is a technique where you're\ngoing after a whale, the big fish.\n\n78\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.391\nThese are the CEOs,\nthe C-level executives.\n\n79\n00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:52.150\nThe men and women that have a lot\nof money or the deep pocketbooks or\n\n80\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.980\nhave access to the corporate resources.\n\n81\n00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.590\nThose are the ones that might know\nthe company's account numbers, and\n\n82\n00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.330\nthings like that.\n\n83\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.740\nSo that's called whaling, when you're\ngoing after the big, big, targets,\n\n84\n00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.860\nup at the top of these organizations.\n\n85\n00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.270\nLittle more, even more specific,\nthan just the organization.\n\n86\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.220\nFewer targets, right?\n\n87\n00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.620\nYou don't have as many.\n\n88\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.410\nI have an organization, I might have\n10,000 employees, but only 50 or\n\n89\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.530\nso C-level execs.\n\n90\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.730\nSo it's a much more targeted attack and\nyou're looking for bigger targets.\n\n91\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.250\n&gt;&gt; So I guess the, like captain Ahab\nlooking for the elusive white whale.\n\n92\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.860\nLike a really wanna get that guy.\n\n93\n00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.370\nIt sounds familiar to me that way.\n\n94\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.150\n&gt;&gt; It does, it does.\n\n95\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.020\nAnd that's exactly right.\n\n96\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.900\nSo those are the different\ncategories of phishing, phishing,\n\n97\n00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.990\nspear phishing, whaling.\n\n98\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.100\nThere's a few others, again.\n\n99\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.470\nBut we're not too worried about that.\n\n100\n00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.450\nWhat I wanna teach you is how do you keep\nyourself safe from any of these attacks,\n\n101\n00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.990\nwhether you're just an employee and\nyou're getting spear phished or whether\n\n102\n00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.770\nyou're part of a generic phishing scam or\nyou're one of those C level execs, right?\n\n103\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.830\nAnd you're getting whaled,\n\n104\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.020\nyou're getting targeted because\nyou are one of those higher ups.\n\n105\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.330\nHow do I keep myself safe?\n\n106\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.200\nHow do I not fall victim\nto these phishing scams?\n\n107\n00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.070\nAnd it all comes down to you paying\nattention to what is going on, right?\n\n108\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.910\nSlowing down and thinking about\nthe email or what's in the email, right?\n\n109\n00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.335\nAnd I've got a few examples that I'm\ngonna show you here in just a second.\n\n110\n00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:23.829\nBut when we get emails, emails are a\ngreat, when we talk about fishing emails\n\n111\n00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:27.870\nare primary method for\ngetting people to click on things.\n\n112\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.020\nThere is other types\nof phishing as I said.\n\n113\n00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.490\nThere is SMS phishing or smishing.\n\n114\n00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.870\nThere's also-\n&gt;&gt; Smishing?\n\n115\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, There's vishing,\n\n116\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.130\nwhich is voice over IP phishing.\n\n117\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.680\nThere's a lot of different\ntypes of phishing.\n\n118\n00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.650\nBut that's just a different media, right?.\n\n119\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.666\nInstead of sending you an email and\ndoing phishing,\n\n120\n00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:49.553\nI send you a text message and\nI'm doing Smishing.\n\n121\n00:05:49.553 --> 00:05:52.470\nOr I-\n&gt;&gt; I think I've had a few of those before.\n\n122\n00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.130\nI'm like, no, I'm no doing that one.\n\n123\n00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.530\n&gt;&gt; I don't know who this is from.\n\n124\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.260\nAnd what should you do, Vonne?\n\n125\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.710\n&gt;&gt; You should delete it and\nnot click on anything.\n\n126\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.360\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n127\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.280\nDon't click on it, right?\n\n128\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.480\nAnd that's really what it comes down to.\n\n129\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.100\nWhether it is smishing or\nphishing, or vishing, or\n\n130\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.230\nwhatever the case may be, we just need\nto pay attention to what's going on.\n\n131\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.610\nIf you get an email from\nsomebody that you don't know,\n\n132\n00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.550\ndon't click on links within the email\nwithout verifying something first.\n\n133\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.338\nEven if you get emails from somebody\nthat you know, but weren't expecting it.\n\n134\n00:06:21.338 --> 00:06:23.580\nYou know, Vonne sent me an email and\nit had an attachment on there.\n\n135\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.500\nWell, I know Vonne, I trust Vonne, but\n\n136\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.130\nshe never mentioned anything about\nsending me some file with a PDF on it.\n\n137\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.330\nBefore I open it up,\nI'm gonna do one of two things.\n\n138\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.218\nI'm either gonna scan it myself,\nand see if it might be a virus, or\n\n139\n00:06:34.218 --> 00:06:37.585\nI'm gonna call Vonne up and I'm gonna say,\nhey Vonne, did you send me a PDF?\n\n140\n00:06:37.585 --> 00:06:40.400\nShe's gonna say,\nyeah that was me and okay, great.\n\n141\n00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.490\nNow I'll open it.\n\n142\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.730\nIt took me an extra second or two to\ndo this, but I kept my computer safe.\n\n143\n00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.240\nI kept my network safe,\nall of my data is safe.\n\n144\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.160\nSo we've got to take that extra step.\n\n145\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, I actually had\nsomething like this happen to me.\n\n146\n00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.470\nI had a friend, it was a legit friend,\nand it was through text message.\n\n147\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.640\nAnd it's like, so and so has shared a song\nwith you and it looked like an iTunes\n\n148\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.920\nemail address or a website, so\nI clicked it and it went to iTunes, but\n\n149\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.050\nI started getting scared because the URL,\nit didn't say Apple or iTunes.\n\n150\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.190\nIt was kind of a shortened URL and\nI'm like my gosh I clicked on this.\n\n151\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.150\nMy gosh they got my password,\nand I started freaking out.\n\n152\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.683\nBut then I Googled it and I made sure,\nno that is actually how people can go into\n\n153\n00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:24.540\niTunes and send you a song and\nit shortens the URL.\n\n154\n00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.871\nIt's like the Bitly types\nof web addresses, but\n\n155\n00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:32.176\nit did scare me enough to where I\nwent in and changed my iTunes and\n\n156\n00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:36.094\nmy Apple ID account passwords and\nI deleted some things.\n\n157\n00:07:36.094 --> 00:07:40.820\nBut it wasn't until I researched\nit that I was like, no, I'm okay.\n\n158\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.520\nBut I just went in and clicked it.\n\n159\n00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.041\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And it could have been,\n\n160\n00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:47.584\njust cuz I hadn't talked to this\nperson in a long time, and I'm like,\n\n161\n00:07:47.584 --> 00:07:48.864\nmaybe this is not right.\n\n162\n00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:51.146\nMaybe somebody got her phone or\nher account and\n\n163\n00:07:51.146 --> 00:07:53.261\nwas sending this out\nto all of her friends.\n\n164\n00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:57.221\nSo I got a little bit scared but\nI did a little research.\n\n165\n00:07:57.221 --> 00:07:58.627\nAnd I found out it was okay, so.\n\n166\n00:07:58.627 --> 00:08:01.108\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm glad you're safe and\nyour computer is safe.\n\n167\n00:08:01.108 --> 00:08:03.570\nBut that's exactly what they're\npreying on, the bad guys.\n\n168\n00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.710\nThey want you to just, so that's from Joe,\nand click on any link in there.\n\n169\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.980\nAnd the bad guys can get that information,\nright, it's very easy for\n\n170\n00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.010\na bad guy to fake emails.\n\n171\n00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.610\nTo change who is in the from field, to\nit looks like it's from your friend, but\n\n172\n00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.930\nit's far really from your friend.\n\n173\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.971\nThey might have compromised your friend's\ne-mail account, their yahoo account,\n\n174\n00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:24.667\nyour aol account and what have you.\n\n175\n00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:26.440\nAnd gotten into the address book and\n\n176\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.010\nused their address box as who\nthey're gonna try to fish.\n\n177\n00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.910\nSo, it does look like it's from\nyour friend, but it's not, right?\n\n178\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.610\nThis is why you have\nto do that extra step.\n\n179\n00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.240\nAnd hey, did you send me a song?\n\n180\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.270\nVery cool, but\nare you sure this is from you?\n\n181\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.870\n&gt;&gt;

Yes, we'll give you a hard time.\n\n187\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you would.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n188\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.290\nthat's part of the learning process,\nright?\n\n189\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.030\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat some actual phishing e-mails.\n\n190\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.520\nTake a look at my screen here.\n\n191\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.860\nAnd I'm over at University of\nCalifornia Berkeley's website.\n\n192\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.330\nThey have a great\nsecurity team over there.\n\n193\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.225\nAnd what they've done is,\nwhen any of their employees or\n\n194\n00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:18.945\nwhat have you have gotten a scam or\none of these phishing scams.\n\n195\n00:09:18.945 --> 00:09:24.215\nThey've posted on this website so\nother employees can go, I saw that email.\n\n196\n00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:27.425\nOr hey, if I ever see that email,\nI'll know that that's a phishing scam.\n\n197\n00:09:27.425 --> 00:09:30.865\nSo it's a great little site for\ntheir employees.\n\n198\n00:09:30.865 --> 00:09:34.055\nIt's also a great place where\nwe can see some actual scams\n\n199\n00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:36.495\nthat have been used in the real world,\nall right?\n\n200\n00:09:36.495 --> 00:09:40.080\nSo this is UC Berkeley's webpage and\nthey call it The Phish Tank.\n\n201\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.280\nAppropriate enough.\n\n202\n00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.670\nAnd let's just kinda go through\nsome of these examples.\n\n203\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.190\nI'll try to zoom in a little\nbit on my browser here so\n\n204\n00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.490\nwe can get a little bit more\nof this message, there we go.\n\n205\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.810\nAll right, and\nlet's just take a look at this first one.\n\n206\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.680\nThis is a message from human resources and\nI'm gonna scroll down and\n\n207\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.786\nthen we'll kinda look back up.\n\n208\n00:09:59.786 --> 00:10:06.110\nAnd again great site, so you guys could\ngo check this out as well berkely.edu.So\n\n209\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:11.000\nhere's an email from HR at berkeley.edu\n\n210\n00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.980\nfrom human resources to and then it\ntells somebody's name there, Dear so and\n\n211\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.010\nso berkeley.edu and information\ndocument has been sent to you by\n\n212\n00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.900\nthe human resources department, click\nHere to log in and View the document.\n\n213\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.910\nThank you!\n\n214\n00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.090\nAnd then some copyright information for\nBerkley University of California.\n\n215\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.000\nSo, is this a phish or\nis this not a phish?\n\n216\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.340\nWhat kind of things do I look for in here?\n\n217\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.240\nAnd I tell you that the first thing\nthat I would notice from this\n\n218\n00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.550\nis that it's from relatively\ngeneric email address, right?\n\n219\n00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.036\nIt's from HR@Berkley.\n\n220\n00:10:43.036 --> 00:10:47.250\nNot susan@berkeley.eud,\nnot george@berkekely.edu,\n\n221\n00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.070\nnot an employee in the HR, but\nfrom the HR department itself.\n\n222\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.650\nAnd that's the first indicator.\n\n223\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.140\nNow, it can be done, right?\n\n224\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.900\nWe can create groups within Outlook and\nExchange and do that kind of thing,\n\n225\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.470\nbut typically,\nemails are sent to groups like that.\n\n226\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.280\nIf I want to get everyone in HR.\n\n227\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.370\nBut, usually don't come\nfrom groups like that.\n\n228\n00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.760\nSo, that's my first indicator.\n\n229\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.960\n&gt;&gt; And that could always be something\nthat would look legit to you.\n\n230\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.570\nBecause I know at the university I used to\nwork at, we would have help@cjc.ufl.edu.\n\n231\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.750\nAnd we would have like an actual email.\n\n232\n00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.250\nAnd so, I know that that could exist.\n\n233\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.630\nSo, it could potentially be something\nthat At first glance, like,\n\n234\n00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.090\nthat would totally be okay.\n\n235\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.330\n&gt;&gt; But a lot of times with those help\ndesk scenarios and things like that,\n\n236\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.317\nlike help@itpro.tv or support@dell.com.\n\n237\n00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:36.040\nYou might e-mail that address and\nthey can reply to you from there, but\n\n238\n00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.610\nusually you don't get\nthe beginning e-mail from that.\n\n239\n00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.640\nRight?\nIt's one of the things I was looking at.\n\n240\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.970\nAnd like Vonne said though,\nthis could very well be legitimate.\n\n241\n00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.310\nIt's just an indicator,\nsomething that's gonna make me go Hm,\n\n242\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.960\nI need to think a little bit\nbefore I click on the link.\n\n243\n00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.260\nThat's all.\nIt's not saying, this is a scam.\n\n244\n00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.500\nIt's just saying, hey think about it.\n\n245\n00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it could be that you think\nit's legit, but it's something like,\n\n246\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.560\nthey wouldn't name it HR.\n\n247\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.610\nOr they wouldn't name it Hello\ncomes in a generic name.\n\n248\n00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.210\nIt's like I know that they have\na different name in convention on how they\n\n249\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:13.710\ndo their kinda group catch all type email\nthat comes from a certain organization.\n\n250\n00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.080\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nI next thing I would see in this email is\n\n251\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.870\nthe grammar's maybe a little bit off and\n\n252\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:25.400\ninformation document has been sent to\nyou by the human resources department.\n\n253\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.040\nI don't know,\nsomebody could definitely type that,\n\n254\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.820\nbut It does seem a little off, right?\n\n255\n00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.910\nAn information document,\nwhat is an information,\n\n256\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.980\nI mean people say, hey we sent you this\nform or we sent you this document.\n\n257\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.450\nI've never had anything by\ncalling it information document.\n\n258\n00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.765\nAnother little indicator that\ndoesn't Say it's phishing, but\n\n259\n00:12:43.765 --> 00:12:46.155\njust makes me go hm, right?\n\n260\n00:12:47.195 --> 00:12:51.705\nThen the biggest tell is the link itself,\nright?\n\n261\n00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:55.210\nBecause it says click here to\nlog on to view the document.\n\n262\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.770\nThank you.\nAnd this capital O, right, again,\n\n263\n00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.930\nthat could be a typo, could be the way\nsomebody set up their signature.\n\n264\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.400\nBut it is something that makes me go hmph,\nthat's odd a little different,\n\n265\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.070\nthan what I normally see.\n\n266\n00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:11.730\nAnd it's all these things together,\nthat make me think this might be a scam,\n\n267\n00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.540\nit's not just one or the other.\n\n268\n00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.790\nBut the last technique is to\nhover over the link itself.\n\n269\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.790\nAnd let me see if I can zoom in and\nshow you the tools up there.\n\n270\n00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.700\nAs you gonna let me do this,\nlet's try one more technique here.\n\n271\n00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.400\nSee if it will let me-\n&gt;&gt; Is it zooming kinda of like?\n\n272\n00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the zooming take away\nthe ability to hover and see that.\n\n273\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.370\nThere it is.\n\n274\n00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.400\n&gt;&gt; You got it?\n&gt;&gt; I got it\n\n275\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.450\n&gt;&gt; Let's click in here to get some focus.\n\n276\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.170\n&gt;&gt; When you're hovering over it,\nit doesn't say UC Berkley,\n\n277\n00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.350\nit doesn't say an EDU email address.\n\n278\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.650\nIt's something that is completely not\nfrom the University of California.\n\n279\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n280\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.270\nI wish I could freeze that.\n\n281\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.660\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Good job!You got it!\n\n282\n00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.220\nYou got it!\n&gt;&gt; Yes, real quick on that one!.\n\n283\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.300\n&gt;&gt; So yes, when I hover over the link\nthat it wants me to click on,\n\n284\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.210\n&gt;&gt; Your application typically,\n\n285\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.630\nusually it's down in\nthe bottom left hand corner.\n\n286\n00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.280\nNow, Berkeley has disabled all of\nthese links, so that we don't go and\n\n287\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.350\ninfect ourselves as we're trying to learn\nabout phishing for their employees and\n\n288\n00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.310\nthings like that.\n\n289\n00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.820\nBut they've added a tool tip that shows\nwhat would have showed up normally.\n\n290\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.900\nIn that bottom left-hand corner when\nyou hover over a link like that.\n\n291\n00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:26.830\nAnd if we look closely it says,\nhttp://www.jsanchezc.com/,\n\n292\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.115\nand then it kinda looks real.\n\n293\n00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:32.620\nAuth.Berkeley.edu/cache/login, yadda\nyadda yadda.\n\n294\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're being sneaky right there.\n\n295\n00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.680\nThere is the actual Berkeley.edu in there.\n\n296\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.190\n&gt;&gt; They are, exactly right.\n\n297\n00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:42.810\nBut Well we have to understand is what we\nreally need to pay attention to is what\n\n298\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:48.570\noccurs between those http:// and\nthe first slash after that.\n\n299\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:53.000\nEverything else we can kind of ignore\nat this point, we really gotta focus on\n\n300\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.570\nbetween the double slash\n&gt;&gt; In that first slash,\n\n301\n00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.880\ncuz that is where you're going.\n\n302\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.045\nNow I don't wanna get technical and\nsilly about domains but, to the right of\n\n303\n00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:08.240\nthat, zc.com/, to the right of that,\n\n304\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.950\nthat's subdomain information and\nsub-pages and things like that.\n\n305\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.790\nBut the first part,\nthat tells me where I'm going.\n\n306\n00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:19.880\nI'm not going to anything berkeley.edu,\nI'm going to jsanchezc.com.\n\n307\n00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:25.390\nThat is probably not where I want\nto go to update my password for\n\n308\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.860\nmy Berkeley logon, right?\n\n309\n00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.020\nThat is what we've got to look for,\n\n310\n00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.350\nwe've got to pay attention to the links\nthat we're getting ready to click on.\n\n311\n00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:33.990\nSo just hover over it, right?\n\n312\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.870\nAnd if it looks suspicious,\nDon't click on it.\n\n313\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.550\nIf anything,\nopen up a separate browser window, and\n\n314\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.730\ngo to your logon page for Berkley.edu.\n\n315\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.210\nAnd if you really need to update your\npassword, they're gonna tell you there.\n\n316\n00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.470\nAll right?\n\n317\n00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:50.567\nIt's very doubtful that any respectable\norganization is ever gonna send you\n\n318\n00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:53.285\nan email with a link to go and\nupdate your password.\n\n319\n00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.942\n&gt;&gt; This would happen all\nthe time at the university, and\n\n320\n00:15:55.942 --> 00:15:59.898\nwe would get our IT department would be\nsending out emails like, this is a scam,\n\n321\n00:15:59.898 --> 00:16:01.865\ndon't do this, don't click on this.\n\n322\n00:16:01.865 --> 00:16:04.130\nPlease don't click on this,\nand it was almost daily.\n\n323\n00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.460\nAnd it got to where they would make\njokes like, here's another one.\n\n324\n00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.500\nAnd they would make some little\nkind of funny joke off to the side.\n\n325\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.390\nSo they were trying really hard to say,\nthis is going out.\n\n326\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.655\nWe are aware of this, do not click on it.\n\n327\n00:16:17.655 --> 00:16:21.210\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly, now let's take a look\nat a couple more that we can look at.\n\n328\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.520\nI think they got one for\ntheir library account.\n\n329\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.688\nThis one, and if we hover over this link,\nlet's see what we got.\n\n330\n00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:33.530\nHere's a good one, let's see if I can show\nyou, oops, a little too slow on that.\n\n331\n00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:37.040\n&gt;&gt; Almost.\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n332\n00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.402\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Come on,\nlet's cast it out, let's catch it.\n\n333\n00:16:40.888 --> 00:16:42.380\n&gt;&gt; I'll try it, there it is.\n\n334\n00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes, success!\n\n335\n00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.425\n&gt;&gt; Right as it was getting ready to fade.\n\n336\n00:16:44.425 --> 00:16:45.286\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n337\n00:16:45.286 --> 00:16:47.854\ntake a close look at this one,\nremember what I told you.\n\n338\n00:16:47.854 --> 00:16:54.940\nhttp or https://, those first double\nslashes and the first slash after that.\n\n339\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.203\nWhat's in between there?\n\n340\n00:16:56.203 --> 00:17:01.388\nauth.berkeley.edu.lbna.ml, so again,\n\n341\n00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:05.808\nthey're really trying trick you here.\n\n342\n00:17:05.808 --> 00:17:12.790\nThey've got berkeley.edu in the URL, but\nwhat's the last thing before that slash?\n\n343\n00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.428\nThat's where you're going, so\nyou're really going to libna.ml.\n\n344\n00:17:16.428 --> 00:17:19.390\nNow .ml, that's a Malaysian website.\n\n345\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.780\nOr a site that's been registered\nunder the country code of Malaysia.\n\n346\n00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.194\nI believe it's Malaysia.\n\n347\n00:17:24.194 --> 00:17:28.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you see those country\ncodes like .uk, I know that's one.\n\n348\n00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:32.458\nAnd so that's not a US website,\nit is another country.\n\n349\n00:17:32.458 --> 00:17:38.175\nBut .ml, I might not know every single\ndots for the different countries.\n\n350\n00:17:38.175 --> 00:17:42.985\nSo I would, honestly, if I was looking at\nthat, I would think that this was legit.\n\n351\n00:17:42.985 --> 00:17:47.857\n&gt;&gt; And see the trick here is that slash\nshould come right after berkeley.edu.\n\n352\n00:17:47.857 --> 00:17:53.127\nThere should be nothing between the site\nyou're going to and that first backslash.\n\n353\n00:17:53.127 --> 00:17:54.497\nSo if it's yahoo.com,\n\n354\n00:17:54.497 --> 00:17:58.027\nit should be yahoo.com/ and\nthen a bunch of other stuff.\n\n355\n00:17:58.027 --> 00:18:02.470\nIt should never be yahoo.com\nother stuff and then a slash.\n\n356\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:07.424\n&gt;&gt; Because the berkeley.edu,\nthat's like the top domain, so\n\n357\n00:18:07.424 --> 00:18:11.434\nthe extra lbna.ml,\nthat should never be there.\n\n358\n00:18:11.434 --> 00:18:12.308\n&gt;&gt; Yes, never.\n\n359\n00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:18.406\n&gt;&gt; Cuz the .ml indicates the end of\nthat particular top-level domain.\n\n360\n00:18:18.406 --> 00:18:23.206\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and again, it's okay\nif you don't understand the URLs, and\n\n361\n00:18:23.206 --> 00:18:27.360\ndomains, and different levels,\nand stuff like that.\n\n362\n00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.490\nIt's easy, look at that first slash.\n\n363\n00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.720\nAnd if the place you're trying to go to is\nnot bumped up against that first slash,\n\n364\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:39.120\nthat is probably a bad link that\nyou do not want to click on.\n\n365\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.576\n&gt;&gt; That's really, really good information.\n\n366\n00:18:41.576 --> 00:18:42.728\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n367\n00:18:42.728 --> 00:18:44.640\n&gt;&gt; Now I know to look at that.\n\n368\n00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n369\n00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:46.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n370\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.690\nhere's another, look at the link\nthat I was going to click on.\n\n371\n00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.788\nIt says auth.berkeley.edu/.\n\n372\n00:18:51.788 --> 00:18:54.736\n&gt;&gt; And\nthey left it out in the actual text, so\n\n373\n00:18:54.736 --> 00:18:57.390\nyou're thinking it is the website.\n\n374\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.610\n&gt;&gt; It looks legit right?\n\n375\n00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.170\nIf it says click here, a lot of people\nknow, I should hover over that and\n\n376\n00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.080\nsee where it's actually going.\n\n377\n00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.800\nBut here it's showing me the entire link,\nso I think.\n\n378\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.640\nSo there's no reason to really pay\nattention to it and double-check it.\n\n379\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.330\nBecause it says berkley.edu/, so\nI'm just gonna go ahead and click on it.\n\n380\n00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.612\nBut you can put anything\nyou want in the email and\n\n381\n00:19:16.612 --> 00:19:18.908\nchange the link of where\nit's actually going.\n\n382\n00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.360\nAnd I'll show you in a second.\n\n383\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.411\nSo when you hover over, you realize,\nhey, it's not berkley.edu/.\n\n384\n00:19:24.411 --> 00:19:28.880\nIt's berkley.edu.lbna.ml/,\nsomething isn't right here.\n\n385\n00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the same principle as\nthey're making a link out of click here.\n\n386\n00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.750\nThey show the words,\nclick here, there is a link.\n\n387\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.326\nHere they're doing the same thing, but\n\n388\n00:19:37.326 --> 00:19:41.056\nthey're using text that looks\nlike the website address.\n\n389\n00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:45.482\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and they're even showing you cuz\nthey know the tricks that we try to teach\n\n390\n00:19:45.482 --> 00:19:47.480\nour end users to stay safe.\n\n391\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.650\nDon't click on a link in an email,\nopen up your browser and go to the site.\n\n392\n00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.031\nAnd what do they say, copy or paste it in.\n\n393\n00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:57.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I copy this link,\n\n394\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.987\nI might as well just click on\nthe link in the first place, right?\n\n395\n00:20:00.987 --> 00:20:05.280\nYou don't copy it and then paste it into\nyour browser because now whatever they're\n\n396\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.370\ntrying to get you to do,\nyou're still doing it.\n\n397\n00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.982\nWhat you do is you go to your browser and\nyou manually type it in.\n\n398\n00:20:11.982 --> 00:20:18.630\nauth.berkley.edu/cache/login, you\ndon't copy and paste it over there.\n\n399\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.000\nOtherwise, there's no point in\ndoing that step, all right?\n\n400\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.680\nLet's take a look at\na couple more examples.\n\n401\n00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.710\nDropbox, very,\nvery popular one to try to do.\n\n402\n00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.680\nHello, you just received a file\nthrough Dropbox Share Application.\n\n403\n00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.580\nPlease click below and log in to\nview the file, and look at all this.\n\n404\n00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.460\nEvery time you invite a friend and\nyou get extra space.\n\n405\n00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.401\nThis is stuff that makes\nthe email look legitimate, right?\n\n406\n00:20:40.401 --> 00:20:42.820\nCuz I've seen this before from Dropbox.\n\n407\n00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it has their logo,\nit even has their cute little sayings.\n\n408\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.750\nHappy Dropboxing, you're like,\nyep, this is definitely Dropbox.\n\n409\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.090\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nit really does look legit.\n\n410\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.714\nBut if we hover over this link,\n[SOUND] too slow again.\n\n411\n00:20:53.714 --> 00:20:54.754\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] got it!\n\n412\n00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:55.618\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whoops,\n\n413\n00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:56.797\nnow it opened up my favorites over there.\n\n414\n00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:59.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's try that one more time,\n\n415\n00:20:59.035 --> 00:21:03.000\nwe'll get ready, hover, zoom, there we go.\n\n416\n00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.090\nSo it's authberkeleyedu.atwebpages.com.\n\n417\n00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:13.530\nAgain, right, look at that first slash\nthat comes after the double slash.\n\n418\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.679\nAnd we're actually going to\natwebpages.com, all right?\n\n419\n00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:19.321\nThey even throw in the authberkeleyedu.\n\n420\n00:21:19.321 --> 00:21:22.077\nBut notice there are no dots\nbetween auth.berkeley.edu,\n\n421\n00:21:22.077 --> 00:21:25.430\nwhich we normally see when we go to\nthose legitimate Berkeley sites.\n\n422\n00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.000\nNow if I was an employee at Berkeley,\n\n423\n00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.700\nthose are the kind of things\nthat I would start to recognize.\n\n424\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.504\nLike, we never push everything together,\nit's always .berkeley.edu.\n\n425\n00:21:33.504 --> 00:21:36.864\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthese are examples from UC Berkeley.\n\n426\n00:21:36.864 --> 00:21:39.578\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So they're showing actual examples that\n\n427\n00:21:39.578 --> 00:21:40.570\nthey've got.\n\n428\n00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:45.685\nSo if this was coming to you at ITProTV or\nmy Gmail, it would try to kind of\n\n429\n00:21:45.685 --> 00:21:50.633\nmask it that way of using my organization,\nor Gmail, or something to that effect.\n\n430\n00:21:50.633 --> 00:21:55.118\n&gt;&gt;

of\n\n7\n00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.130\nEnd User Security Awareness where you\nbecome aware of our end users, and\n\n8\n00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.696\nthe security they should be doing, and\nhere to help us do exactly that is Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:28.510\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n10\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.020\nDaniel, thanks for\njoining us in the studio.\n\n11\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Not a problem,\nI'm glad to be back in the studio,\n\n12\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.410\nit's always a good time to come\nin here and talk about security,\n\n13\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.070\nbecause as you well know,\nI love that subject.\n\n14\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.732\nAnd today, we're going to be talking about\nphysical security, physical security.\n\n15\n00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:45.351\nWe're gonna get bodyguards, no that's\nnot too far from the truth actually.\n\n16\n00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:48.536\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We might talk about some guards, but\n\n17\n00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:53.181\nwe're going to talk about what we can\ndo around things we can touch, tangible\n\n18\n00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:57.920\nitems and things that are tertiary to\ntangible items and keeping them secure.\n\n19\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.690\nBecause we do have an area\nof security which says that,\n\n20\n00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.260\nwhat if someone steals my laptop?\n\n21\n00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.010\nWhat if some one grabs my mobile phone?\n\n22\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.130\nIs there sensitive data on it?\n\n23\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.441\nAnd if so, what do we do?\n\n24\n00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:15.212\nWell, the best thing to do is to try\nto prevent any access to that even\n\n25\n00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:18.830\nif it was stolen or\ntaken from your person, right?\n\n26\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.500\nSo, that's what we're\ngonna look out today.\n\n27\n00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.400\nPhysical security and\nalso even around your building.\n\n28\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.920\nWhat are the things around our buildings\nthat we could be doing to help\n\n29\n00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.370\nensure more of that physical security.\n\n30\n00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.490\nSo that's what we\nare gonna dive in to today.\n\n31\n00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.240\nSo the first topic we're gonna jump\ninto is our workstation, right?\n\n32\n00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.220\nThis is our desk, right?\n\n33\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.230\nThere is probably a computer sitting\non it of some sort, kind or spec.\n\n34\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.060\nLaptops, we have desktops, monitors,\nkeyboards, mouse, my, so much fun.\n\n35\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.240\nHow do we keep those secure, or\n\n36\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.580\nhave you even thought about\nthe security of those items?\n\n37\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.980\nWell, we need to be doing that.\n\n38\n00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.870\nAnd one of first things you can\nreally jump on, is the screen, right?\n\n39\n00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.980\nThe screen is allowing people to view\ndata, because that's it's purpose in life.\n\n40\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.770\nI have data on the computer,\nI want to be able to view it for\n\n41\n00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.860\nmy modification pleasure, my informational\npleasure, and that's what it needs to do.\n\n42\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.250\nSo what are we talking about when\nit comes to security in that realm?\n\n43\n00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.340\n&gt;&gt; I know about this one\nbecause it's a real problem for\n\n44\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.630\nanybody working in IT where you've got\nsensitive information up on your screen.\n\n45\n00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.910\nBut even if you're not the IT person,\nlike, you work in a hospital and you're on\n\n46\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.240\nyour desk, you got patient records pulled\nup, well you need to be able to see them.\n\n47\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.020\nBut there's an attack, a well known\nattack called, shoulder surfing.\n\n48\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.960\nAnybody who walks behind you can look and\nsee what's on your screen, and if you've\n\n49\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.300\ngot sensitive data, you're now effectively\nleaking it out, not on purpose.\n\n50\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.810\nIt's a monitor, you need to be able to\nsee it, and how do we prevent that?\n\n51\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.561\nWe can't throw a blanket over our head and\nknow where the-\n\n52\n00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.238\n&gt;&gt; Well, I guess you could.\n\n53\n00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:48.979\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n54\n00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.392\n&gt;&gt; So how do we make sure that we\nkeep that data safe when we're using\n\n55\n00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:52.204\nthe computer, Dan?\n\n56\n00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:53.080\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n57\n00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.496\nWe all go out and we buy blankets, right?\n\n58\n00:02:54.496 --> 00:02:55.807\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No,\n\n59\n00:02:55.807 --> 00:02:59.029\nwe don't need to run to Costco and\ngrab bulk blankets.\n\n60\n00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.020\nThere's a cool little\ndevice that you can buy.\n\n61\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.360\nIt's relatively inexpensive, so if you\nneed it to outfit your entire company.\n\n62\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.370\nMaybe you're a bank and\nyou have loan officers.\n\n63\n00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.850\nWhat's gonna be on their screens?\n\n64\n00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.200\nSensitive customer information,\n\n65\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.670\ntheir financial info that I'm sure\nthat no one wants to get leaked out.\n\n66\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.280\nLike Don says, you've got medical records.\n\n67\n00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.570\nThings that if someone were just to be in\nthe correct angle at the right vicinity.,\n\n68\n00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.490\nthey would be able to see that screen and\nmaybe glean some information.\n\n69\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.040\nSo the blanket option\nreally not being the best.\n\n70\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.770\nThey have invented a cool little thing,\nI've got one right here, called a screen\n\n71\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.630\nfilter and this is a cool little\ndevice that you pop over your screen.\n\n72\n00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.360\nThis one is built for\na very small like laptop screen, but\n\n73\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.580\nyou can get them in just about any size or\nshape for all different types of monitors.\n\n74\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.210\nAnd basically you just stick\nthis over your screen.\n\n75\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.300\nAnd when it's in front you\ncan see through it, right?\n\n76\n00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.250\nBut if I'm at an angle it\ngoes completely blacked out.\n\n77\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.760\nAnd it gives you a very small viewing\nangle on which to actually see through it.\n\n78\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.690\nSo shoulder surfing then\nbecomes much more difficult\n\n79\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.080\nthan it would be if you\ndidn't have one of these.\n\n80\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.520\nSo, if you do have sensitive information\nfor customers, or whatever, and you don't\n\n81\n00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.260\nwant people to be able to easily shoulder\nsurf that info, buying one of these,\n\n82\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.030\nand putting them on those desktops,\nwould be a great way to stop that.\n\n83\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.550\n&gt;&gt; And these are great for anytime you\nhave a desktop that's in an area where you\n\n84\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.790\nmight have customers nearby.\n\n85\n00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.822\nSo, in banks,\nyou have mortgage officers, right?\n\n86\n00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:22.783\nAnd they always take whoever the customer\nis, and walk them into their office, and\n\n87\n00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:25.200\nthey sit down, and\nthe computer's right there in the room.\n\n88\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.600\nBut they're also great on airplanes,\nright?\n\n89\n00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.519\nYou're sitting on an airplane.\n\n90\n00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.260\nYou've got your laptop.\n\n91\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.680\nYou're trying to get work done.\n\n92\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.120\nMeanwhile, the people sitting next to\nyou have full view of your laptop.\n\n93\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.690\nBut you saw how when Daniel turned\nthat filter, the screen went black so\n\n94\n00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.870\nthe people sitting to your left and\nright, they just see a black screen.\n\n95\n00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.790\nMeanwhile, you looking straight\non actually see your screen and\n\n96\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.320\ncan work with it.\n\n97\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.530\nSo that's a great example of physical\nsecurity right there that we\n\n98\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.100\nare preventing people that\nare physically near us.\n\n99\n00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.230\nThis is not a hacker coming\nin over the internet or\n\n100\n00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.770\nsomething, it's people in\nour physical proximity.\n\n101\n00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.720\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n102\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.472\nAnd not that everybody out there\nis a nefarious person, but\n\n103\n00:04:59.472 --> 00:05:03.280\nwe have to be prepared for\nthat to be happening.\n\n104\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.180\nSo better to have it and\nnot need it than need it and not have it.\n\n105\n00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.380\nIt's one of my favorite mottos.\n\n106\n00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.680\nRight, so moving on from there,\nscreen filters,\n\n107\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.580\nrelatively cheap, easy to install.\n\n108\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.367\nIf you've got the budget for\nit, I highly suggest going out,\n\n109\n00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:17.368\nespecially if you have that type\nof sensitive information, or for\n\n110\n00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:20.690\nyour own personal use, like what Don\nwas talking about, on an airplane,\n\n111\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.662\nbus, sitting in a restaurant somewhere,\nsomething like that.\n\n112\n00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:27.577\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, that takes care of\nit as far as people to the side, right?\n\n113\n00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:31.538\nBut if I get up and walk away from my\ndesk, anybody could come sit down and\n\n114\n00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:33.070\nlook right at the monitor.\n\n115\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.838\nIt's right there, right?\n\n116\n00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:34.972\nSo how do we prevent that.\n\n117\n00:05:34.972 --> 00:05:36.654\nDo we stick another filter on it?\n\n118\n00:05:36.654 --> 00:05:38.157\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As you know, well, we go out and\n\n119\n00:05:38.157 --> 00:05:38.904\nwe grab those blankets again, right?\n\n120\n00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:40.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n121\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.856\nthen when your computer catches fire,\nthen no one can get the information.\n\n122\n00:05:42.856 --> 00:05:43.365\nIt's safe [LAUGH].\n\n123\n00:05:43.365 --> 00:05:45.017\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess you wouldn't have\nall the thief problems [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:46.614\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it might be an issue.\n\n125\n00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:47.860\nBut no, he's right.\n\n126\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.340\nBecause not always is it gonna be\nthat you're sitting at your desk and\n\n127\n00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.310\nyou can see someone that's right\nbehind you that might be trying to\n\n128\n00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.930\nshoulder surf your information.\n\n129\n00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.750\nSometimes you have to get up and\ngo take a bathroom break.\n\n130\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.090\nMaybe you're a smoker,\nyou take a cigarette break.\n\n131\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.740\nIt's lunch time.\n\n132\n00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.610\nYou get up and you walk away from your\ndesk to go eat in the cafeteria or\n\n133\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.090\nat a restaurant.\n\n134\n00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.680\nWhat do you do?\n\n135\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.380\nOr any time that you are away\nfrom your keyboard or desk?\n\n136\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.320\nHow do you secure that data?\n\n137\n00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.053\nWell there's actually some easily\nbuilt-in features to secure that.\n\n138\n00:06:15.053 --> 00:06:16.680\nThey're called lock screens.\n\n139\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.203\nNow typically your IT department will\nprobably have some sort of policy\n\n140\n00:06:20.203 --> 00:06:23.548\nin place for any computer that's\nowned by the company and connected\n\n141\n00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:27.672\nto their network that will lock the screen\nout after x amount of time of inactivity.\n\n142\n00:06:27.672 --> 00:06:31.840\nRight, so you've got 10 minutes of\ninactivity and the lock screen happens.\n\n143\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.280\nBut what if I, I've just finished\nwriting up this document,\n\n144\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.660\nI hit save, and you know what,\nI've gotta go to the bathroom.\n\n145\n00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.730\nAnd I push away from my desk and\nI walk away.\n\n146\n00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.530\nWell somebody's got a 10 minute window in\nwhich they could walk over to my desk and\n\n147\n00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.280\nactively use my computer, get any kind of\ninformation that they need logged in as me\n\n148\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.260\nand do that attack, right?\n\n149\n00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.920\nThat was what we wanna avoid.\n\n150\n00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.470\nSo what can we do?\n\n151\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.640\nWell we can lock the screens ourselves and\n\n152\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.770\nthis is a great thing that you\nshould be doing all the time.\n\n153\n00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.250\nAny time you walk away from your desk\nyou should be doing this technique.\n\n154\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.460\nAll you have to do is\nhit your lock screen.\n\n155\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.320\nSo let me show you a couple of\nways in which you can do that.\n\n156\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.725\nLet's go to my computer.\n\n157\n00:07:12.725 --> 00:07:14.740\nAll right, so\nI'm running a Windows machine here.\n\n158\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.410\nNot untypical in any desktop environment\nor laptop environment as you might find.\n\n159\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.090\nAnd to get to the lock all you have to do\nis do the old three finger salute as we\n\n160\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.440\nlike to call it in the IT business.\n\n161\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.040\nCtrl+Alt+Delete and\nthen enter will get you there.\n\n162\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.911\nSo I can do that now.\n\n163\n00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:33.280\nJust Ctrl+Alt+Delete,\nit helps if I hit Alt for Alt+Delete.\n\n164\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.660\nYou'll notice this lock screen comes up.\n\n165\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.170\nIf I just hit enter,\nthe default is to hit lock this computer.\n\n166\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.581\nI can also obviously use\nmy mouse to do that.\n\n167\n00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:42.020\nThat's a very nice way to do it.\n\n168\n00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.883\nAnother way in which you can\ndo it is do Windows Key+L.\n\n169\n00:07:44.883 --> 00:07:46.140\nI don't know if that, yep, there we go.\n\n170\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.840\nAnd it's immediately locked.\n\n171\n00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.637\nThis is probably the most preferred\nmethod, because it's the easiest.\n\n172\n00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.311\nYou don't have to do any extra things or\n\n173\n00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:55.356\nmaybe you didn't hit\nthat Enter key very well.\n\n174\n00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:58.724\nBut either one of those ways\nwill get you to a lock screen.\n\n175\n00:07:58.724 --> 00:07:59.973\nAnd that's what we want to see.\n\n176\n00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:01.973\nI also have a Linux machine up as well.\n\n177\n00:08:01.973 --> 00:08:06.054\nJust about every operating system will\nhave some sort of locking mechanism\n\n178\n00:08:06.054 --> 00:08:09.510\nbecause we understand\nthis is a security thing.\n\n179\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.760\nIt will vary by distribution.\n\n180\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.480\nIf you are, some reason,\nyou are using Linux as your desktop.\n\n181\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.440\nYou just got to try to\nfind around the gooey.\n\n182\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.380\nMaybe ask your IT person\nwhere is that lock feature so\n\n183\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.250\nthat I can lock my machine, at will.\n\n184\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.300\nHere is just in system and then I have\nthis lock screen ability right here and\n\n185\n00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.030\nthen there we go.\n\n186\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.870\nI have my own lock out.\n\n187\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.140\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of Linux systems\nactually mirror the Windows side.\n\n188\n00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.100\nAnd you can do Windows key L.\n\n189\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.760\nYou might be on a Linux system but there's\nstill a Windows key on the keyboard\n\n190\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can do Windows key L.\n\n191\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.990\nAnd the lock as well, it's pretty common.\n\n192\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n193\n00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.610\nAnother feature that you might\nfind in your systems is that there\n\n194\n00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.760\nis encryption on them.\n\n195\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.870\nTypically, this is not\nsomething that is set by you.\n\n196\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.590\nThis will probably be set by your IT but\nif it's not or if you're all wondering\n\n197\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.590\nabout it or if they've mentioned that your\ndisk might be encrypted, maybe have to put\n\n198\n00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.050\npassword in to access certain things\nThat's probably due to encryption.\n\n199\n00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.840\nYou see this with BitLocker.\n\n200\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.830\nI know that I've had a lot of people call\nme and say, I have this, it's asking for\n\n201\n00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.570\na BitLocker password.\n\n202\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.880\nIf you do encounter it,\nthat's what it's all about.\n\n203\n00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.750\nIs that your system is being protected\nby encryption, of the actual drive.\n\n204\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.310\nThat way, if someone snatches\nyour laptop and runs away,\n\n205\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.800\nand then they try to log into it.\n\n206\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.210\nOr they try to put the drive in on\nanother computer and access it through\n\n207\n00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.880\nthose means, they would need that, an\nunencrypting password, to get to the data.\n\n208\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.710\nSo you'll see that in a lot of systems.\n\n209\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.430\n&gt;&gt; A lot of people don't realize this,\nbut if you lock your screen, right,\n\n210\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.450\nthat stops somebody from sitting down\nat your computer and using it and\n\n211\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.580\ngetting at your data, right?\n\n212\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.440\nSo we're obviously safe.\n\n213\n00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.970\nAnd if they rebooted the computer\nthey've gotta log in,\n\n214\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.150\nif they don't have the password\nthey can't get in so you're safe.\n\n215\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.440\nBut if they've physically\nremoved the hard drive,\n\n216\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.080\nthey can add it as a secondary hard\ndrive to one of their own computers.\n\n217\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.610\nAnd now they have access\nto all of that data.\n\n218\n00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.430\nAnd that's where this encryption\nreally comes in handy.\n\n219\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.600\nAnd it's typically already set up for you.\n\n220\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.880\nIt's set up when the operating\nsystems are installed.\n\n221\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.540\nYou ask your IT Department about it.\n\n222\n00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.570\nIf you use a laptop, you really need to\nmake sure you've got that because the odds\n\n223\n00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.700\nof losing a laptop are really high.\n\n224\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.380\nOn a desktop it's less likely but\n\n225\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.410\nwhat are somebody physically breaks into\nthe building and steals all the computers.\n\n226\n00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.090\nIf you had customer client data on that\nmachine now you're at risk, right?\n\n227\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.130\nSo that's where that disc level encryption\nis really handy, so if you've ever powered\n\n228\n00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.230\non a computer and it immediately asks for\na password before you can get to\n\n229\n00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.430\nthe operating system, a lot of times that\nis the unlock key for the disk encryption.\n\n230\n00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.620\nThen that's what's providing\nyou that protection.\n\n231\n00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.470\nAnd if you don't see that, there may\nbe some system that's automating that.\n\n232\n00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.500\nThere's a few different\nones that will do that.\n\n233\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.120\nOr it may mean that you\ndon't have encryption.\n\n234\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.000\nSo if you're not sure, ask your IT\ndepartment and they can let you know.\n\n235\n00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.700\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nLet's talk about laptops because,\n\n236\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.605\nwell, they do tend to go walk about.\n\n237\n00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:42.290\nAnd that's the bigger problem when it\ncomes to mobile devices in general is that\n\n238\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.950\nThey're mobile.\n\n239\n00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.980\nSomeone would have to break in the\nbuilding like Don was saying to get at my\n\n240\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.520\ndesktop.\n\n241\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:54.290\nIt's kind of wired down, because of\nthe power, they're big and they're bulky.\n\n242\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.270\nThey're not really good for mobility.\n\n243\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.070\nThe laptops, tablets,\neven phones are meant for that.\n\n244\n00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.660\nThey're designed to do that.\n\n245\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.130\nSo the problem is we take them out of\nthe building and we get forgetful.\n\n246\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.050\nWe set them down.\n\n247\n00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.350\nI've done it my own self.\n\n248\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.120\nI've left my phone at\na guitar center one time.\n\n249\n00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.500\nRush back to get it and\nit was gone, buddy.\n\n250\n00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.570\nIt didn't last the two minutes before\nI realized it was not on my person.\n\n251\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.330\nIt was, I went in there, it was just gone.\n\n252\n00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.440\nSomeone had picked it up.\n\n253\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.320\nSo this is the problem.\n\n254\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.510\nSo what can we do?\n\n255\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.740\nLet's start talking about\nlaptops really quickly.\n\n256\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.920\nWith laptops, you can have\nwhat's called a Kensington lock.\n\n257\n00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.660\nAnd if you remember back in our other\nepisode, we talked about social\n\n258\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.180\nengineering, and Don mentioned a person\ncoming in dressed as a UPS man.\n\n259\n00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.460\nLoading up, or an IT person,\nloading up Dell laptops and\n\n260\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.870\nsaying, I'm here to do Dell repair\nwarranty work and taking them out.\n\n261\n00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.470\nWell, there could have been a great way\nyou could have stopped that type of\n\n262\n00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.660\nattack, and\nusing something called a Kensington lock.\n\n263\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.740\nLet's take a look at my\nscreen really quickly.\n\n264\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.470\nHere's photo of what a Kensington\nlock might look like.\n\n265\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.950\nSome of them use these\nbarrel-type combination locks.\n\n266\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.480\nSome of them use keys but as you can see,\nit physically attaches to the laptop.\n\n267\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:12.319\nAnd a lot of laptops nowadays come from\nthe manufacturer with a Kensington lock.\n\n268\n00:12:12.319 --> 00:12:16.218\nAnd then we'll notice this,\nwhich is a steel braided cable.\n\n269\n00:12:16.218 --> 00:12:17.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Running of the back,\n\n270\n00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.540\nwhich is chained to probably the desk or\nmaybe even the floor.\n\n271\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.380\nMaking it very, very secure.\n\n272\n00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.950\nSomeone would have a very\nhard time just picking up and\n\n273\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.230\nwalking away with this laptop.\n\n274\n00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.880\nAnd that's what these\nlocks are designed to do.\n\n275\n00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.630\nYou can take one with you even.\n\n276\n00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.370\nSo if you're out at a Starbucks and you're\nsitting there using their free Wi-Fi and\n\n277\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.770\nyou have your laptop, you could chain\nthat to the table that you're sitting at.\n\n278\n00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.950\nThat way, someone just couldn't come and\ndo a snatch and grab and\n\n279\n00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.250\nrun off with your stuff.\n\n280\n00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.970\nOr if you did go to the restroom and\nyou wanted to leave your stuff there,\n\n281\n00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.810\nyou could do that,\ncuz it'd be whole lot more difficult for\n\n282\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.800\nthem to just pick it up and\nwalk away with it.\n\n283\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.150\n&gt;&gt; And I know I've gotten questions\nfrom people in the past saying hey,\n\n284\n00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.730\nI bought this new laptop and there's a\nlittle port here that doesn't do anything.\n\n285\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.510\nWhat is this port?\n\n286\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.180\nAnd it's not a port, it's actually\nthe spot where that lock fits in,\n\n287\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.930\nand the name Kensington comes\nfrom the company that created it.\n\n288\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.070\nIt's Kensington,\nthey sell locks all over the place.\n\n289\n00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.830\nBut you'll see this on desktops, laptops,\neven some mobile phones have it.\n\n290\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.080\nAnd if you go to your local electronic\nstore and they got laptops on display,\n\n291\n00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.620\nthey're typically wired into that.\n\n292\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.160\nUniversities do it in their labs.\n\n293\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.670\nIt's an easy solution.\n\n294\n00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.430\nAnd you can sit down in the morning,\nlock your device, use it all day long.\n\n295\n00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.880\nAnd when you're ready to leave at the end\nof the day you unlock it and walk away.\n\n296\n00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.460\nYou make sure that you're the only\none who can take that device away.\n\n297\n00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.910\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's easy insurance,\nit's relatively cheap, so\n\n298\n00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.000\njust throw one of these in your bag,\nso that you have one wherever you go.\n\n299\n00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.560\nIf you're a company it might\nbe a good investment for\n\n300\n00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.170\nyou to make sure that just keeps\nthe theft down to a bare minimum,\n\n301\n00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.610\nthat's what they're all about and\nthey're very effective at that.\n\n302\n00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:51.940\nLet's talk about more mobile systems,\nthings like, well Tablets and\n\n303\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.170\nphones, typically is what pops to\nthe mind when someone says mobile device.\n\n304\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.550\nNow, the cool thing is there's a lot of\ntechnology built into those devices to\n\n305\n00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:04.570\nhelp keep them secure in case of thief,\nand we should be employing that.\n\n306\n00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.670\nThese are things like PIN numbers,\nfacial recognition,\n\n307\n00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.290\neven iris scanning software that will\n\n308\n00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.940\nuse the camera on your phone to look at\nyour face to make sure you're the person.\n\n309\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:20.040\nFinger print scanners, biometrics that\nare inserted into the system as well,\n\n310\n00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.960\nso that only the authorized\nperson has access to it.\n\n311\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.150\nSo even if someone does pick up and\nrun away with my phone,\n\n312\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:32.220\nsitting at a table It's actually just\nlike I am right now, if on our desk is my\n\n313\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.060\nphone, if we were in a public area,\nsomeone could easily just run by and\n\n314\n00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.125\ngrab it and run off, and\nmaybe they're fast as Usain Bolt.\n\n315\n00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:39.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n316\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.980\nI'm not gonna be able to catch them,\nright?\n\n317\n00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.950\nNow that device would be gone, but\nthe good news is is if I have one of those\n\n318\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.510\nsecurity implementations implemented,\nwell guess what,\n\n319\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.880\nthey got themselves a phone that really\nisn't gonna do a whole for them.\n\n320\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.190\nMaybe they can wipe it, but they're not\ngetting at my data, they could have\n\n321\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.350\nthe physical device, resell it,\ndo whatever they want with that.\n\n322\n00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:02.370\nBut that's fine, it's the data that's\nimportant on it, I'm gonna insure\n\n323\n00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.670\nsome of the fund that will replace that\nform me that data is irreplaceable.\n\n324\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.180\nI don't know which one is more shocking,\nhow easy boats can be stolen or\n\n325\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.105\nthe fact that you're saying boats\neven want to steal your phone.\n\n326\n00:15:12.105 --> 00:15:13.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm a fast man, Don Pezet.\n\n327\n00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:14.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n328\n00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.890\nsome of the carriers have\nactually gone a step further.\n\n329\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:24.082\nLike AT&amp;T and Verizon have, and even\nApple Where Apple has iCloud lock now.\n\n330\n00:15:24.082 --> 00:15:24.595\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n331\n00:15:24.595 --> 00:15:25.900\n&gt;&gt; If your phone is stolen,\n\n332\n00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.420\neven if factory resets it, they can't\nconnect it to iCloud again unless\n\n333\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.760\nyou release it from your account and\n\n334\n00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.750\nwith AT&amp;T and Verizon if a phone is stolen\nthey can immediately disable that SIM and\n\n335\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.340\nbasically blacklist that phone,\nthe phone can't be used anymore.\n\n336\n00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.650\nThat really deterred theft\nof mobile devices a lot.\n\n337\n00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.920\nBut that doesn't mean we\ncan just ignore security.\n\n338\n00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.786\nThat if you've got your email on\nthere you might have sensitive data,\n\n339\n00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:52.284\nyou might have corporate\ndata on that phone.\n\n340\n00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:55.218\nAnd if somebody steals it\nwe can't prove whether or\n\n341\n00:15:55.218 --> 00:15:57.410\nnot they were able to get at that data.\n\n342\n00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.893\nAnd so we may have to do\na disclosure to our customers and\n\n343\n00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.574\nsay Hey, we lost a phone.\n\n344\n00:16:02.574 --> 00:16:03.969\nIt had customer data on it.\n\n345\n00:16:03.969 --> 00:16:06.580\nHere's the risk,\nyour data may have been leaked.\n\n346\n00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.580\nYou don't wanna do that, right?\n\n347\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.630\nSo that's the big risk with mobile\ndevices, we've gotta keep them secure.\n\n348\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.970\nAnd so having a pin number on them, having\na locked screen, it can be annoying.\n\n349\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.600\nI know a lot of people hate having those\nlock screens on there, but the moment you\n\n350\n00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.610\nlose your phone, boy will you appreciate\nhaving that lock screen in place.\n\n351\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.360\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Don is dead on.\n\n352\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.320\nBecause typically, this will probably\nhappen if you work in this business for\n\n353\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.260\nany length of time.\n\n354\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.460\nIt just happens, you're on the go,\nyou're doing things and you got so\n\n355\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.640\nmany things on your phone.\n\n356\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.400\nIt's just, use some form of lock screen.\n\n357\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.760\nI don't care which one it is, just use it.\n\n358\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.930\nA couple of options\navailable to us as well.\n\n359\n00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.520\nThere are third party softwares that can\ndo disk encryption on those, so maybe get\n\n360\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.460\nwith your IT department if that's not\nalready something that is being done.\n\n361\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.120\nYou can talk to them and get their\nrecommendation for a disk encryption for\n\n362\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.220\nyour mobile device.\n\n363\n00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.600\nYou also have remote wiping ability,\nit's like Don was was talking about Apple,\n\n364\n00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.750\nyou have the ability to track and\nnot release it until such and\n\n365\n00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.800\nsuch an activity has happened.\n\n366\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.290\nYou also have things like Find my iPhone,\nwhich has remote-like feature.\n\n367\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.710\nI think Keys or Smart Switch or\nsomething for Samsung or\n\n368\n00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.570\nAndroid devices is available.\n\n369\n00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:16.970\nThere's another one,\nLook Out is on Android as well, Air Droid.\n\n370\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.270\nAll these types of software will allow\nyou to have that level of control.\n\n371\n00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.596\nSo if someone for whatever reason,\nUsain Bolt's having a hard time-\n\n372\n00:17:24.596 --> 00:17:25.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n373\n00:17:25.103 --> 00:17:25.950\n&gt;&gt; Snatching phones.\n\n374\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.960\n[LAUGH] He takes off with yours,\nwell you just get on your laptop, and\n\n375\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.880\nuse your wipe feature, and\njust wipe the phone out.\n\n376\n00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.260\nThat way no matter what they do,\nthey at least not getting at the data,\n\n377\n00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.010\nwhich is the most important thing.\n\n378\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.210\n&gt;&gt; And if it's a company phone,\n\n379\n00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.390\nthe odds are your IT department\nhas already set up some system.\n\n380\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.790\nThey call it a mobile device management,\n\n381\n00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.270\nan MDM solution,\nwhere they can remote wipe it.\n\n382\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.850\nIf you have your company's exchange email\nor something like that on the phone,\n\n383\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.480\nthey likely already have a remote wipe.\n\n384\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.990\nSo you don't necessarily need\nto install something yourself.\n\n385\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.550\nSo check with your IT department though.\n\n386\n00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.790\nSee what they've got on there.\n\n387\n00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.840\nAnd if they don't have anything,\nthere's plenty of options for\n\n388\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.850\nyou to deploy your own.\n\n389\n00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:59.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n390\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.510\nSo now let's move on here.\n\n391\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.680\nLet's talk about data on the desk.\n\n392\n00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.180\nAnd we're not talking about\nthe laptops and the mobile devices.\n\n393\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.200\nWe're talking about things like this,\n\n394\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.120\nactual documentation that might have\nsensitive information on it, right.\n\n395\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.650\nThis could be possibly if I just leave\nit laying on my desk what could happen?\n\n396\n00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.670\nSomeone could walk over,\nthe good old shoulder surfing atack works,\n\n397\n00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.480\njust as well against as physical media\nas it does against your laptop or\n\n398\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.030\nyour desktop screen.\n\n399\n00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:33.120\nSo we have to be aware of our desk\nenvironment as much as our workstation.\n\n400\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.890\nRight?\nSo\n\n401\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.540\nthis is something we\nhave to take a look at.\n\n402\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.200\nLet's start talking about leaving\nthings like this laying around.\n\n403\n00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.300\nThis is a declassified document,\nby the way, I just found online and\n\n404\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.675\nprinted it out 'cause I\nthought it looked cool.\n\n405\n00:18:43.675 --> 00:18:46.470\n[LAUGHTER] It kind of gives\nus that context, right.\n\n406\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.890\nIf I just left this on my desk,\nnow I leave it open.\n\n407\n00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.190\nDon, do you think you could see that\nstanding right here next to me?\n\n408\n00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.960\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n409\n00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And not just me, the cleaning crew or\n\n410\n00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.120\nanybody else that came by,\nit's right there.\n\n411\n00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.130\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n412\n00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.310\nIt's easy enough that if I was working\nwith document, say I'm on my computer,\n\n413\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.400\nI've got the document printed out,\nit's sitting right next to me,\n\n414\n00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.840\nit's confidential.\n\n415\n00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.160\nAnd Don comes walking over to ask me\nsomething about a show we're gonna do.\n\n416\n00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.930\nAll I have to do is take that and\nturn it over, like that.\n\n417\n00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.460\nHe doesn't even think anything of it,\nit's not a slight to Don.\n\n418\n00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.250\nSo don't worry about offending someone,\nit's confidential data.\n\n419\n00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:26.260\nAnybody that is in your business should\nbe aware that it's nothing against their\n\n420\n00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.240\nperson, it's just policy and\n\n421\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.130\nprocedure to make sure that\nconfidential data does not get viewed.\n\n422\n00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.450\n&gt;&gt; But that turnover technique,\n\n423\n00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.620\nthat only works when you're\nsitting right there, right?\n\n424\n00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.230\nSo I can get up to get some coffee,\nnow that's not Not so,\n\n425\n00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.920\nthat's practically a blanket\nover our monitor, right?\n\n426\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.550\n&gt;&gt; We're going back to the blanket\n\n428\n00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.151\ntechnique, and\nwhy is Don's desk covered in blankets?\n\n429\n00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:46.408\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is he building a fort,\n\n430\n00:19:46.408 --> 00:19:47.091\nwhat's going on, right?\n\n431\n00:19:47.091 --> 00:19:47.595\n&gt;&gt; It gets very cold.\n\n432\n00:19:47.595 --> 00:19:50.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We keep it freezing in\n\n433\n00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.225\nhere, right?\n\n434\n00:19:51.225 --> 00:19:54.085\nBut yes, the turnover technique\nis only gonna get you so far,\n\n435\n00:19:54.085 --> 00:19:58.995\nthere are other techniques,\nthings like one of these, right?\n\n436\n00:19:58.995 --> 00:20:03.887\nThat way we just take that little\ndocument, and we stick it inside of here.\n\n437\n00:20:03.887 --> 00:20:08.337\nAnd hey look at that, Dan can you now\nsee this document in any way I turn it?\n\n438\n00:20:08.337 --> 00:20:10.377\n&gt;&gt; That is an amazing advancement\nin security right there.\n\n439\n00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.577\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n440\n00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:12.807\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just an easy thing for\n\n441\n00:20:12.807 --> 00:20:14.007\nus to start doing it.\n\n442\n00:20:14.007 --> 00:20:18.887\nMake sure that any king of sensitive\ndocuments get returned some sort of\n\n443\n00:20:18.887 --> 00:20:22.880\na covering so that it can't be seen,\nand then what do we do with this Dan?\n\n444\n00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.420\nWe stick them in a file cabinet,\nwhich probably, or at least should,\n\n445\n00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.910\nhopefully, have a lock on it lock.\n\n446\n00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.770\nIf you take this, I'm done with it,\n\n447\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.600\nI put it inside that locked cabinet,\nlock the cabinet.\n\n448\n00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.260\nI can walk away to my heart's content,\nand then only authorize people with\n\n449\n00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.140\nan actual key to that cabinet,\ncan access that information.\n\n450\n00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.530\nThat sounds like common sense but\nthe hard part,\n\n451\n00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.550\nthe hard part to beat in\npeople's minds is that\n\n452\n00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.070\nyou need to put these documents\naway anytime you leave your desk.\n\n453\n00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.860\nAnytime you leave your office unsecured.\n\n454\n00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.765\nSo if you're going to get some coffee or\ngonna go use restroom,\n\n455\n00:20:56.765 --> 00:21:00.315\nyou need to lock your office when you\nleave, and that secures the whole office.\n\n456\n00:21:00.315 --> 00:21:03.455\nOr if you need to leave your office open,\nmaybe you share an office with other\n\n457\n00:21:03.455 --> 00:21:06.955\npeople, then you do need to collect your\npapers, lock them in the cabinet, and\n\n458\n00:21:06.955 --> 00:21:09.485\nthen go and use the restroom or whatever.\n\n459\n00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:12.355\nYou've gotta maintain\nthat level of security.\n\n460\n00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:16.065\nIf you have other employees that all\nhave the same level of security as you,\n\n461\n00:21:16.065 --> 00:21:17.495\nthen it might be okay to leave things out.\n\n462\n00:21:17.495 --> 00:21:20.470\nBut you'll need physical security\non the building to ensure that\n\n463\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.220\nthe cleaning crew or\nsome outside vendor, or\n\n464\n00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.510\na customer can't get into the area\nwhere these documents are exposed.\n\n465\n00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.340\nSo it's a lot of work having to put away\ndocuments, get out documents and stuff.\n\n466\n00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.800\nBut it's all a part of our\nresponsibility for protecting that data.\n\n467\n00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.750\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nnow as we've probably alluded to,\n\n468\n00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.810\ndata is not always printed out.\n\n469\n00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.760\nA lot of times it can also be on\nwhat's known as removable media.\n\n470\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.870\nUsually things like removable hard\ndrives that attach through a USB cable.\n\n471\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.460\nUSB thumb drives, right?\n\n472\n00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.970\nI've got a couple of examples.\n\n473\n00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.000\nHere's a hard drive\nthat I have at my desk.\n\n474\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.010\nHere's a very nice thumb drive that I have\nand a very small thumb drive for just\n\n475\n00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.070\ntransferring files or Don comes over, hey\ndo you have a thumb drive I can borrow?\n\n476\n00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.340\nI can slam him that one.\n\n477\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.500\nBut all of these things\nneed to be secured,\n\n478\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.830\nI can't just leave them in my change tray,\nsitting on my desk or\n\n479\n00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:11.220\njust that hard drive\nattached to my docustation.\n\n480\n00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.180\nWhen I walk away,\nwhen I leave for the day,\n\n481\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.610\nanybody could come up as Donna said,\nthe cleaning people, some one, the social\n\n482\n00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.050\nengineer would probably try to get\nhimself on the cleaning crew, or herself.\n\n483\n00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.840\nOn the cleaning crew so\nthey could have that after hours access\n\n484\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.580\nwithout a lot of prying eyes\nwatching what they're doing.\n\n485\n00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.680\nSo we need to also lock these things\naway when they're not in use.\n\n486\n00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.930\nAnd there's something to be said about not\nputting sensitive data on these types of\n\n487\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.210\ndevices because of their mobility,\nbut we have a lot of the same\n\n488\n00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.960\ntypes of security measure in place,\nthat you can put in place, should I say.\n\n489\n00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.970\nFor them if you do put\nsensitive data on them.\n\n490\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.020\nThis is disk encryption.\n\n491\n00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.050\nAnd you can use things,\nagain, like BitLocker.\n\n492\n00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.440\nMacOS is actually pretty easy, you just\nright-click on the drive and hit encrypt.\n\n493\n00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.770\nAsks you for a password and\n\n494\n00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.120\nthen it encrypts the drive,\nso it's very cool that way.\n\n495\n00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.270\nSo just ask your IT department.\n\n496\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.010\nSay, you know what?\n\n497\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.150\nI do work with a lot of\nremovable types of media,\n\n498\n00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.820\nand specifically hard drives and\nthumb drives maybe.\n\n499\n00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.870\nAnd I would like to use some\nsecurity measures to encrypt those,\n\n500\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:09.960\ncould we use that?\n\n501\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.900\nThis is also talking about optical media,\nmaybe you've got sensitive information on\n\n502\n00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.050\na CD-Rom, a DVD, they're not as\nprevalent as they once were.\n\n503\n00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.210\nBut they still are out there and\nyou might be using them.\n\n504\n00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.490\nNow just remember,\nput that inside of a CD case and\n\n505\n00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.950\nthen stick that inside of a locked area.\n\n506\n00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:30.720\nDo that with all these types of physical\npieces of data, whether they be paper,\n\n507\n00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.530\nwhether they be digital,\nand plastic and metal.\n\n508\n00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.660\nJust make sure that when you're not using\nthem they are locked away to where only\n\n509\n00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.110\nauthorized people can get access to them.\n\n510\n00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.783\nAll right Don,\nthat moves us to securing our building.\n\n511\n00:23:44.783 --> 00:23:48.667\nWow, we're gonna have\na lot of fun here because,\n\n512\n00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:54.136\ntypically not the place that the end\nuser is responsible for, per se.\n\n513\n00:23:54.136 --> 00:23:56.145\nBut we do have responsibilities, right?\n\n514\n00:23:56.145 --> 00:23:58.035\nI do have access to the building.\n\n515\n00:23:58.035 --> 00:24:01.235\nSo it is up to me to make sure that\nwhen I do access the building,\n\n516\n00:24:01.235 --> 00:24:04.437\nI don't give access to anybody else,\nespecially if they're\n\n517\n00:24:04.437 --> 00:24:08.470\nnot an authorized person that's\nsupposed to be inside the building.\n\n518\n00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.010\nWe talked a little bit about this,\nback in our social engineering show,\n\n519\n00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.660\nbecause typically that's a good way for\n\n520\n00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.810\nsomeone to get access to sensitive data is\nby hey can you hold that door open for me.\n\n521\n00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.490\nWell that's against our policy to\nallow that tailgating technique so\n\n522\n00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.330\nI'm not going to do that.\n\n523\n00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.390\nPlease go around to the front and\n\n524\n00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.620\nhave the person at the front desk allow\nyou to log in and get into the system.\n\n525\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.370\nThat's typically how you\nwanna work with this.\n\n526\n00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.980\nBut locks are what typically\nkeeps people out, right?\n\n527\n00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:43.410\nWe have some sort of access mechanism\nto our physical building area so\n\n528\n00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:48.250\nthat unauthorized access is not allowed.\n\n529\n00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:52.246\nBrewing up just some ideas of different\ntypes of locks that you may walk\n\n530\n00:24:52.246 --> 00:24:57.070\nthrough,we have biometric\nclocks like this.\n\n531\n00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:01.251\nVery cool this is something we have,a lot\nof this pictures I took my self my phone.\n\n532\n00:25:01.251 --> 00:25:03.130\nThis is something we have in our building.\n\n533\n00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:07.210\nIt is for our-\n&gt;&gt; Time clock\n\n534\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's our time system,but\n\n535\n00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.140\nthis could've been easily\nhas been access to the door.\n\n536\n00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.850\nSome sort of magnetic lock, right.\n\n537\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.320\nI put my finger on it and\nit scans my fingerprint and\n\n538\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.760\nit says, I recognize that fingerprint.\n\n539\n00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.700\nI'll give you access.\n\n540\n00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.430\nOpen the lock to the door.\n\n541\n00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.520\nWe also have, let's take a look here.\n\n542\n00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.100\nRemember we talked about cabinets,\nlocking them away.\n\n543\n00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.080\nPhysical locks.\n\n544\n00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.910\nRight there I can take those paper\ndocuments,I can take that hard drive.\n\n545\n00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.590\nI can stick them in this cabinet and\nlock it and\n\n546\n00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.090\nI'm the only one who has access to it\ncuz I'm the only one who has keys to it.\n\n547\n00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.970\nSomeone needs it they have to\ncome to me or break this down.\n\n548\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:47.766\nAnd I'm gonna really know,really\nquickly someone has, [LAUGH] bad things\n\n549\n00:25:47.766 --> 00:25:52.430\nare afoot and I need,I start looking\naround for the culprit right.\n\n550\n00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.760\nSo, another great thing.\n\n551\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.710\nWhat else do we have, as far as locks go?\n\n552\n00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.910\nCombination locks.\n\n553\n00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.470\nYou'll notice where we have\nthis combination lock.\n\n554\n00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.800\nIt's the kind that you\npress in a series of keys.\n\n555\n00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.690\nAnd then it unlocks the door,\nand gives you access to it.\n\n556\n00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.850\nAlso has a physical lock as well.\n\n557\n00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.140\nAnd you'll see this is in\nour electrical telecom,\n\n558\n00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.990\nthis is basically our server closet.\n\n559\n00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.670\nWhere all of our servers or\nrouters or things of that nature are.\n\n560\n00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.340\nWe don't want to just give anyone\naccess to that it is a sensitive area.\n\n561\n00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.580\nSo not only do we have locks\non the outside building but\n\n562\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.320\non the inside of the building as well.\n\n563\n00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.712\nJust a couple of others that I have,\nwe have electronic entry, magnetic type\n\n564\n00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:33.220\ncards, you walk up it reads the magnetic\nfield off the card as you swipe it.\n\n565\n00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.680\nThis is how we gain access to our doors.\n\n566\n00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.440\nAgain, could be a metal key that\neveryone just has a key to the building,\n\n567\n00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.550\nand you can walk over and\nyou can get that.\n\n568\n00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:46.200\nTypically metal keys are for high level\npersonnel, for emergency purposes,\n\n569\n00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.010\nif the magnetic locks they're not working\ncorrectly and they can keep people in.\n\n570\n00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:51.230\nBut this is something you may see.\n\n571\n00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:55.690\nYou also have keypads as well, and\nthey look a little something like this.\n\n572\n00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.160\nYou type in a key combination and\nit releases the magnetic lock and\n\n573\n00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.470\nyou gain entry to the system.\n\n574\n00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.030\nYou wanna put these on all sensitive\nareas, and not only that, but\n\n575\n00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.020\nwe also want to be watching\nover our physical area.\n\n576\n00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.170\nWe employ things like cameras,\nI got cameras in great areas,\n\n577\n00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:15.090\non this we have CCTV cameras, this right\nhere is an infrared type of camera, so\n\n578\n00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.490\nit has night vision.\n\n579\n00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.100\nSo if it's at night, and\nit's not a well lit area,\n\n580\n00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.310\nyou can still see and\nrecord what's going on.\n\n581\n00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:26.520\nPeople are, these, even when they're\nnot connected to a recording system,\n\n582\n00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.070\nthey're very good deterrents to people\ntrying to gain unauthorized access\n\n583\n00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.590\nto your building cuz they\nthink they are being.\n\n584\n00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:38.270\nNow you should connect this to some sort\nof recording media, don't get me wrong,\n\n585\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:42.319\njust sticking the sign outside that you\nare being recorded yes it does have it's\n\n586\n00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:48.170\neffect, whatsoever so it's a good idea to\nactually be recording what is going on.\n\n587\n00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.750\nPut those in strategic areas,\nmake sure they don't have any blind spots.\n\n588\n00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.918\nOr that they have as few\nbrown spots as possible, and\n\n589\n00:27:53.918 --> 00:27:55.412\nthose brown spots are small spots.\n\n590\n00:27:55.412 --> 00:27:59.633\nSo again, this is gonna be something\nthat your building operations people\n\n591\n00:27:59.633 --> 00:28:03.385\nare gonna be a part of, and\nnot you per say, but if you see a camera,\n\n592\n00:28:03.385 --> 00:28:08.075\nand it's been covered with something,\nor a limb is blocking, inform them, hey,\n\n593\n00:28:08.075 --> 00:28:12.660\ndid you know the camera on the back\ndoor is being covered by a tree branch?\n\n594\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.890\nSomething we can do as\nend users to inform them.\n\n595\n00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.880\nMaybe they didn't know that.\n\n596\n00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.800\nThat's, thank you so much.\n\n597\n00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.960\nAnd they'll go trim that tree branch back.\n\n598\n00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.050\nWe wanna make sure that these things\nas end users because they're for\n\n599\n00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:24.570\nour safety as much as it is for\nour building's safety.\n\n600\n00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.560\nSo good stuff to do.\n\n601\n00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.910\nYeah.\nThat goes down to biometrics.\n\n602\n00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.550\nWe kinda saw a bit of that\nwith the locking mechanisms.\n\n603\n00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.490\nThey can be, again, iris,\nfacial recognition,\n\n604\n00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.840\nfingerprint scans, I saw in a movie\none time they had a breath scanner,\n\n605\n00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.330\nI don't think that's [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n606\n00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:44.080\n&gt;&gt; Probably very practical, but-\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it was a breathalyzer.\n\n607\n00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.862\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are our employees drunk?\n\n608\n00:28:45.862 --> 00:28:47.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n609\n00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.990\nBut no for real it's gonna be\nfingerprint scanner's probably is what\n\n610\n00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.120\nyour typically gonna be seeing, though,\nwhen it comes to biometrics, anyway.\n\n611\n00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.560\nThe last thing I wanna\ntalk about is guards.\n\n612\n00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.930\nHopefully you can afford some guards.\n\n613\n00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.570\nIf not it's not the end of the world.\n\n614\n00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:05.040\nIf you know something is coming up where\nyou might have more random people at\n\n615\n00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.380\nyour building than necessary, maybe you'll\nhire some temporary guards for that event.\n\n616\n00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:13.390\nCould be very helpful, just to make\nsure everything stays on the up and up.\n\n617\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.780\nGuards can be very helpful.\n\n618\n00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.510\nThey can be used as first responders.\n\n619\n00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.280\nEspecially after hours,\nhave a night guard or something like that.\n\n620\n00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.190\nTo where, if something does occur,\nthey can inform the right people and\n\n621\n00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.540\nalready be on site.\n\n622\n00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.840\nHey someone tried to\nbreak in the building.\n\n623\n00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.770\nI have them apprehended.\n\n624\n00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:27.540\nThe police are on their way.\n\n625\n00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.250\nI thought you should know about that.\n\n626\n00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.630\nThey can be very helpful, so\nif you have a large enough budget for\n\n627\n00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.970\nthat, I would highly recommend it.\n\n628\n00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:37.200\n&gt;&gt; And the most important feature\nthat a security guard brings is that\n\n629\n00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.280\nif you ever see something that you\nidentify as a security risk, but you're\n\n630\n00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.510\nnot comfortable addressing it yourself,\nthey're the person you can go to.\n\n631\n00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.530\nSo, you might see a stranger\nin the hallway, but\n\n632\n00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:49.535\nyou don't want to mess with a stranger,\nright, so they look like Daniel.\n\n633\n00:29:49.535 --> 00:29:50.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n634\n00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.030\ninstead, you go to the security\nofficer and you say I saw such and\n\n635\n00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.970\nsuch person in the hallway,\ncan you go and check it out?\n\n636\n00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.590\nAnd it's their job, they go and do that.\n\n637\n00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.160\nOr after hours, when you're not there.\n\n638\n00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.940\nNow if you're a small company,\nyou probably don't need that,\n\n639\n00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.880\nsmall company everybody who's in the\nbuilding, you don't necessarily need it.\n\n640\n00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.830\nBut in a large company,\nif you're in a multi-tenant building,\n\n641\n00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.480\nthere's always gonna be people in\nthe hall that you don't recognize.\n\n642\n00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.260\nAnd security officers help to shore that\nup and make sure that you're protected and\n\n643\n00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.300\nthe physical security's maintained.\n\n644\n00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.040\nAnd going back to Daniel's point that,\n\n645\n00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.860\nwith all these last couple of physical\nsecurity things that he talked about,\n\n646\n00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.310\nthey're not things that you're expected to\nimplement, the things that your company,\n\n647\n00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:29.190\nyour security officers,\nyour IT department will implement but,\n\n648\n00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:33.430\nwhile they implement it, you actually have\nit well within your ability to defeat it.\n\n649\n00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:37.140\nSo, there might be a locked door with\nkey card access and you could say,\n\n650\n00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.883\nI'm gonna run these boxes out to my car so\nlet me prop the door open.\n\n651\n00:30:39.883 --> 00:30:43.920\nAnd you just need to inadvertently,\nwell not inadvertently,\n\n652\n00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.830\nyou have defeated\nthe security of that door.\n\n653\n00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.110\nAnd while you're running\nthose boxes to your car,\n\n654\n00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.960\nany number of people coming in and out\nof that building without a key card and\n\n655\n00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.600\nthen you come back and\nremove the door prop.\n\n656\n00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.210\nSo we need to understand that\nit's all about participation.\n\n657\n00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:02.040\nWhen the security measures are put\nin place, we need to participate and\n\n658\n00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.590\ndo you know what's expected of us\nto maintain that level of security.\n\n659\n00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.190\nWell Daniel I think that's a pretty good\nrundown of all the different physical\n\n660\n00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.880\nsecurity features.\n\n661\n00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.250\nWe're gonna talk more in some of\nthe other episodes about some of this and\n\n662\n00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.450\nhow we can address it.\n\n663\n00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.440\nBut for right now, I think it's\na pretty good spot for us to wrap up.\n\n664\n00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.200\nDid you have any final words for\nour viewers?\n\n665\n00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.240\n&gt;&gt; I did remember one last thing, and\nit was the disposal of documentation.\n\n666\n00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.720\nYou wanna do that in\na secure manner as well.\n\n667\n00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.460\nBut we're gonna have a full\non episode about that.\n\n668\n00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.230\nI just wanted to mention that here.\n\n669\n00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.600\nAs you're working with the document,\n\n670\n00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.030\nyes when you're done with it you\nput it away in that locked area.\n\n671\n00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:35.370\nBut if you're done done with it, you want\nto destroy in a very safe manner as well.\n\n672\n00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.660\nAnd I know we're gonna get into that,\nbut I just wanted to mention that here.\n\n673\n00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.430\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n674\n00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.990\nAll right.\nWell, Daniel, thank you for your time.\n\n675\n00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.370\nAs always I really do appreciate it.\n\n676\n00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.160\nAnd for the viewers out there,\nwe thank you guys for watching.\n\n677\n00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.690\nBut for right now we're gonna sign this\none off, so signing off for ITProTV,\n\n678\n00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.310\nI've been your host Don Pezet.\n\n679\n00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.146\n&gt;&gt; I'm Daniel Lowry.\n\n680\n00:31:50.146 --> 00:31:50.929\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n681\n00:31:50.929 --> 00:31:58.760\n[MUSIC]\n\n682\n00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.010\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:07.403\n[SOUND] Hello, and welcome back to our\nEnd User Security Awareness series.\n\n2\n00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:12.570\nIn this episode, we're going to be\nasking the question, is this site safe?\n\n3\n00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.600\nThat is the $100,000 question,\nisn't it, Mike?\n\n4\n00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.805\nAnd I'm so\nglad you're here to tell us the answer.\n\n5\n00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:18.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It really is, right.\n\n6\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.740\nI mean, we all use the Web for everything,\nfrom personal use to work use.\n\n7\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.940\nYeah, we're going into these websites and\nwe're filling our forms.\n\n8\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.390\nMaybe we're buying something or\npurchasing something for\n\n9\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.740\nthe company or putting in usernames and\npasswords to log in to sites.\n\n10\n00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.670\nAnd so what we really have to\nask our self, is that safe?\n\n11\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.200\nShould I be putting personal information\nin this site, or financial information?\n\n12\n00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.620\nHow can I make sure that my data\nIs safe as it travels out there\n\n13\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.630\nacross the Internet?\n\n14\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.200\nSo there's a couple of\nthings we could look at.\n\n15\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.400\nReal, simple things we can use to make\nsure that our data isn't gonna be stolen.\n\n16\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.085\nThat the bad guys cannot see that\ninformation as we're working on the Web.\n\n17\n00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:01.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so like I said from the very\nbeginning is what we should look for\n\n18\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.940\nto make sure we're on a safe site.\n\n19\n00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.891\n&gt;&gt; That's right and now when we\ntalk about web pages, web pages and\n\n20\n00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:09.196\nwe're not gonna get into\nthe technical details.\n\n21\n00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:14.259\nBut a web page uses something known\nas hypertext transfer protocol or\n\n22\n00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.350\nHTTP to transmit pages.\n\n23\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.510\nLike when you go to google for example,\nyour computer send out a request, and\n\n24\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.370\ngoogle responds with that web page and\nit opens up in your browser.\n\n25\n00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.570\nNow you can do your search for\nwhatever it is you're looking for.\n\n26\n00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.210\nWell, that information,\nif it's using HTTP, all right?\n\n27\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.800\nThat means the information is plain text.\n\n28\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.210\nIn other words,\nit's not encrypted in any way.\n\n29\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.860\nAnybody that receives that\ncould read the information.\n\n30\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.460\nSo what the bad guys try to\ndo is get in between you and\n\n31\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.560\nwhatever site you're connecting to, right?\n\n32\n00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.920\nFor example,\nlet's say you're going to your bank.\n\n33\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.840\nIf they can connect, if they can get\nin between you and your bank and\n\n34\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.280\nthey're not encrypting that data.\n\n35\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.350\nIf they're just using HTTP to send\nthat information back to you,\n\n36\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.090\nthen the bad guy can steal\nthat information, right?\n\n37\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.980\nAnd they can see\neverything you're sending.\n\n38\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.230\nYour passwords that\nyou're using to log in.\n\n39\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.740\nYour bank information\nthat's coming back to you.\n\n40\n00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.600\nThis is why websites use\nsomething known as HTTPS which is\n\n41\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.080\nhypertext transfer protocol secure or\nsecure hypertext transfer protocol.\n\n42\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.670\nSome of you might have heard\nlook at your browser bar.\n\n43\n00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.190\nLook for that HTTPS at\nthe beginning of the address,\n\n44\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.080\nwhat's known as the URL,\nthat you're typing into the browser.\n\n45\n00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.400\nThat's our first clue is making sure\nthat it's not just HTTP, but HTTPS.\n\n46\n00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.110\nBecause that is gonna tell us that the\ninformation, at least, is being encrypted.\n\n47\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.450\nSo if somebody intercepts it,\nthey won't be able to read it.\n\n48\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.850\nIt'll look like gobbledy gook.\n\n49\n00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's like in a language or\nsome type of thing that\n\n50\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.080\nthe bad guys couldn't read, because it\nis made it all into blips and blobs.\n\n51\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.490\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Blips and blobs.\n\n52\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, changes it into this.\n\n53\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.250\nIt's like our old decoder rings.\n\n54\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.927\nYou're gonna need some information\nto be able to decode that and\n\n55\n00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:03.162\nthat information is private between me and\nwhatever side I'm visiting.\n\n56\n00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:06.103\nThe bad guy's not gonna have\nthat same decoder ring, so\n\n57\n00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:10.800\nhe's not gonna be able to decrypt my\ninformation and it's going to be private.\n\n58\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.610\nSo when we see that HTTPS, we can feel\nconfident that the information that we're\n\n59\n00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.800\nsending between the website and\nus is encrypted.\n\n60\n00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.430\nAnd if anybody intercepts it,\nit's not going to be visible.\n\n61\n00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.490\nThey're not gonna be able to read it.\n\n62\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.500\nSo if I'm logging in, what I wanna do is\nmake sure before I type in my username and\n\n63\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.890\npassword, I see that HTTPS up\nthere in that address bar.\n\n64\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.370\nThat way I know it's safe.\n\n65\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.360\nIf I don't see that we're not\ngonna type in our password.\n\n66\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.930\nBecause that means somebody could\npotentially intercept that information.\n\n67\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I've seen on my browsers,\nthere's almost like a little icon,\n\n68\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.220\nlike a little lock sometimes,\nto indicate that this is safe.\n\n69\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nour browsers try to help us out.\n\n70\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.920\nThis is all on Edge,\nInternet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox.\n\n71\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.620\nThey all have a way of trying to help us\nstay safe and then try to indicate to us,\n\n72\n00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.080\nhey, use connection is going to be secure.\n\n73\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.276\nAll right, now, there is one more thing or\n\n74\n00:04:05.276 --> 00:04:08.030\ncouple of other things we\nreally need to worry about.\n\n75\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.112\nBecause making sure my data is encrypted\nas it travels across the Internet,\n\n76\n00:04:12.112 --> 00:04:15.390\nthat public infrastructure out there,\nthat's good.\n\n77\n00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.250\nI wanna make sure that\nmy data is encrypted.\n\n78\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.470\nBut the other thing I need\nto do is make sure that\n\n79\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.040\nwho I'm talking to on the other end\nis actually who I think it is, right?\n\n80\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.710\nI want sure, hey, is the other\nend actually Bank of America, or\n\n81\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.660\nis it some bad guy pretending\nto be Bank of America.\n\n82\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.450\nBecause If it's a bad guy pretending to\nbe Bank of America, encrypting my data\n\n83\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.140\nis great, nobody can intercept it, but I'm\nstill talking to the wrong person, right?\n\n84\n00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.750\nI don't want the bad guy\nto get my information, so\n\n85\n00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.350\nthere's a second part to this.\n\n86\n00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.933\nYes, we have to make sure that\nwe're using secure languages,\n\n87\n00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:52.869\nthat we're encrypting that traffic\nas it travels across the network.\n\n88\n00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:56.150\nWe also have to verify the other\nend of the conversation.\n\n89\n00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.562\n&gt;&gt; So there could be some imposters out\nthere that are like, hey, I'm here,\n\n90\n00:04:59.562 --> 00:05:00.870\ngive me your stuff.\n\n91\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.858\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n92\n00:05:01.858 --> 00:05:05.950\nAnd they are all over the place and\nthey've got some really fancy tricks to\n\n93\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.108\ntry to fool us to submitting our\ninformation, to think we're at PayPal and\n\n94\n00:05:10.108 --> 00:05:12.060\nupdate our password, right.\n\n95\n00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.120\nAnd they're just sitting there\ncollecting that information.\n\n96\n00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.840\nSo let's see some other ways or\nwhat in addition what we need to do\n\n97\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.030\nbesides just looking for\nthat HTTPS, right.\n\n98\n00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.510\nNow when we create that secure connection,\n\n99\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.650\nwe do this by identifying the other end,\nlike Bank of America or\n\n100\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.530\nPayPal and they send back\nwhat's known as a certificate.\n\n101\n00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.070\nA certificate is an electronic document\nthat proves the identity of the other end,\n\n102\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.360\nmuch like your driver's license or\na passport would, right?\n\n103\n00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.180\nIf you need to prove your identity,\nyou can pull out your driver's license and\n\n104\n00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.140\nit has all your information on there.\n\n105\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.530\nThe police officer or the bartender or\nwhomever can look at that ID and validate\n\n106\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.480\nthat you are actually who you say you\nare and your address and all that stuff.\n\n107\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.960\nA certificate is the same thing for\nweb servers.\n\n108\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.580\nThey can present that to your computer and\n\n109\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.948\nsay look, I really am Bank of America,\nyou can trust me.\n\n110\n00:06:08.948 --> 00:06:12.870\nLet's set up a secure connection so that\nyou can access your private information.\n\n111\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.980\nThat's known, again,\nas a digital certificate.\n\n112\n00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.650\nNow, yes, go ahead, sorry.\n\n113\n00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.010\n&gt;&gt; I was just saying, so these\ncertificates, a company has to apply to,\n\n114\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.780\nlike there's some sort of governing\nbody that issues these certificates,\n\n115\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.020\njust like a contractor goes to\na governing body and here's my contract.\n\n116\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.210\nI'm a real licensed contractor so\n\n117\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.010\nthere's some type of organization that\ndoes that for websites and companies.\n\n118\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, there are what's known\nas certificate authorities that we\n\n119\n00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.490\ncan talk to like VeriSign or\nThought or GTE.\n\n120\n00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.640\nThere are several organizations\nthat issue these certificates.\n\n121\n00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.800\nAnd you go and apply for one.\n\n122\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.271\nIf you're Bank of America or\nyou wanna set up a secure website so\n\n123\n00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:54.954\npeople can buy your product.,\nyou can go out and\n\n124\n00:06:54.954 --> 00:06:58.573\nbuy a certificate from these vendors,\napply it to your website.\n\n125\n00:06:58.573 --> 00:07:01.470\nAnd now, when you're visitors come,\nthey can set up a secure connection.\n\n126\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.770\nThey'll get the green lock and\nthey can be assured,\n\n127\n00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.840\nI guess,\nthat their information is being encrypted.\n\n128\n00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.050\nBut there's one more issue that we have\nto deal with nowadays, because what's\n\n129\n00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.070\nhappened is, more and more companies\nhave started issuing certificates.\n\n130\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.810\nEverybody wants to get in\nthe business of selling certificates.\n\n131\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.630\nWell, they got really lax in validating\nthe information that's required.\n\n132\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.420\nWhen you go to get a driver's license,\nyou have to do what?\n\n133\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.680\nYou have to prove your identity,\nyou've gotta bring a birth certificate,\n\n134\n00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.090\nsome utility bills, like if you\napply a passport here in the US,\n\n135\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.090\nyou've gotta provide all\nkinds of information.\n\n136\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.570\nAnd they're gonna verify all of that\nbefore they issue you the birth\n\n137\n00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.080\ncertificate.\n\n138\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.460\nBirth certificate, the passport or\nthe drivers license.\n\n139\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.366\nWell, the same thing is supposed\nto happen with websites.\n\n140\n00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:50.800\nWhen they request a certificate for their\nsite, they're supposed to be validated,\n\n141\n00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.003\nthe company that's issuing\nthe certificate should make sure\n\n142\n00:07:54.003 --> 00:07:55.437\nthat hey you actually are.\n\n143\n00:07:55.437 --> 00:07:58.429\nI can't go apply for a certificate,\nand say, hey, I'm Microsoft.\n\n144\n00:07:58.429 --> 00:07:59.284\nCan I have a certificate?\n\n145\n00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:00.209\nOr I'm PayPal.\n\n146\n00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:04.331\nCan I have a certificate and\nthen set up my own PayPal site, right?\n\n147\n00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:06.398\nThat shouldn't happen.\n\n148\n00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:08.810\nBut what happen is these vendors\nare getting laxed, more laxed,\n\n149\n00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.670\nand more laxed about their\nverification process.\n\n150\n00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.210\nAnd it got to the point where you can go,\nget certificates really inexpensively.\n\n151\n00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.520\nAnd because they're so inexpensive,\nthe vendors are doing a,\n\n152\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.310\nthey're not spending much time on it.\n\n153\n00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.870\nThey're not putting\na lot of effort into it.\n\n154\n00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.740\nAnd they'll make sure that the domain is\nat least registered and that's about it.\n\n155\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.370\nThis is what we call domain verification,\nall right?\n\n156\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.800\nAnd the problem with that is I could\ngo to one of these companies and\n\n157\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.494\npotentially request a certificate\nin the name of PayPal.com.\n\n158\n00:08:39.494 --> 00:08:42.730\nBut I'm gonna spell it P-A-Y-P-A-L-L.\n\n159\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.470\nI'll put two Ls in there.\n\n160\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.960\nThis certificate vendor is gonna say,\nsure.\n\n161\n00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.770\nHere's a certificate in the name\nof PayPall, with two Ls, .com.\n\n162\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.150\nI can now attach that to my website,\nand when you come to my website,\n\n163\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.520\nif you're not paying attention,\nyou'll see the green lock.\n\n164\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.060\nEverything looks safe and\nyou're gonna put your password in.\n\n165\n00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.640\nThe problem is you're\nnot at the real PayPal.\n\n166\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.000\nYou're at the fake PayPal, all right?\n\n167\n00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.960\nWe'll talk about phishing\nin other episodes.\n\n168\n00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.940\nThis is a part of that process there.\n\n169\n00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.963\nSo in order to prevent that type\nof attack, what these vendors\n\n170\n00:09:15.963 --> 00:09:21.278\nI've started doing is what's\nknown as extended verification or\n\n171\n00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:24.771\nextended validation, EV certificates.\n\n172\n00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:28.767\nAnd now if you wanna spend a little more\nmoney, you can go through an extended\n\n173\n00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:33.267\nvalidation process where they don't just\nmake sure the domain exists like PayPall,\n\n174\n00:09:33.267 --> 00:09:37.890\nwith two Ls,.com, they're gonna check\nwith, say, the Better Business Bureau, or\n\n175\n00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.543\nwhatever country you're in.\n\n176\n00:09:39.543 --> 00:09:42.751\nThey're gonna check and make sure\nthat this is a legitimate business,\n\n177\n00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.090\nit's actually registered and all of that.\n\n178\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.325\nThen they're going to look at\nthe contact information and verify, hey,\n\n179\n00:09:48.325 --> 00:09:52.580\nMike's requesting a certificate, does\nMike actually work at this organization?\n\n180\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.860\nThey're gonna call and they're gonna say,\ndoes Mike have the authority within your\n\n181\n00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.990\norganization to request\nthe certificate in the first place?\n\n182\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:05.700\nThey're gonna do a much deeper thorough\ncheck on that certificate you request.\n\n183\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.910\nAnd now when I get that certificate back,\nit's gonna be displayed\n\n184\n00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.370\na little bit differently in my browser and\nI've got a much higher assurance level,\n\n185\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.880\nnot only that my data\nis being encrypted but\n\n186\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.300\nthat I'm actually talking to the right\nwebsite, PayPal not PayPall with two Ls.\n\n187\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.715\n&gt;&gt; And so that's good for everybody.\n\n188\n00:10:24.715 --> 00:10:28.860\nThe company makes sure that\nto the customers that I am\n\n189\n00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.960\nvery much legit here and\nyou are talking to the right person.\n\n190\n00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.830\nI'm sure, for the vendors,\n\n191\n00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.460\nas well, it's like, we are issuing\na legit certificate, as well.\n\n192\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n193\n00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.790\n&gt;&gt; So how are we going to notice how we're\nin the extended verification or the other\n\n194\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.180\nverification, just like the normal-\n&gt;&gt; The domain verifications?\n\n195\n00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what do we need to look for?\n\n196\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's take a look.\n\n197\n00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.580\nI've got several browsers open up here.\n\n198\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:54.960\nAnd I've got some pages that we'll use\nto show you how the browser helps you,\n\n199\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.850\nor can help you, in determining whether or\nnot your connection is safe and\n\n200\n00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:03.000\nyou're talking to the actual website that\nyou want to be talking to, all right?\n\n201\n00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.530\nSo, first off, I've got Edge,\neverybody's favorite browser, right?\n\n202\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.710\nAnd we'll take a look here,\nI'm on google.com.\n\n203\n00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.620\nAnd if I look at my address bar,\nI can see a couple things.\n\n204\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.420\nI see google.com and\nI see a little gray lock.\n\n205\n00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.120\nOf course, Microsoft is not\ngonna follow everybody else,\n\n206\n00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.910\nthey like to do things their own way.\n\n207\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.700\nSo it's not green, it's gray,\nbut that's okay, all right?\n\n208\n00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.930\nSo I've got that lock up there,\nand if I hover over this, or\n\n209\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.890\nif I click on this lock,\nI'll see this website identification.\n\n210\n00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.440\nGeoTrust, that's the name of the people\nthat are issuing the certificate.\n\n211\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.080\nHave identified the site as google.com.\n\n212\n00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.710\nAnd it says my connection to\nthe server is encrypted, right?\n\n213\n00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.170\nSo this is the basic validation, right?\n\n214\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.550\nThis is what we call domain validation.\n\n215\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.850\nIt's telling me that, yes, my data is\nencrypted but it's not doing any other\n\n216\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:56.240\nchecks of, I could be at Google with two\nLs or Google with three Os or zero Os.\n\n217\n00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.500\nYeah, three Os in there and\nit wouldn't tell the difference.\n\n218\n00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.290\nIt would just say, yes,\n\n219\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.020\nthere's a certificate, and\nyes your information is encrypted.\n\n220\n00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.045\nBut I'm not telling you whether\nyou're actually at Google or not.\n\n221\n00:12:06.045 --> 00:12:08.740\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, and it looks like they're trying\nto give us a little help there with\n\n222\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.120\na link, should I trust this site?\n\n223\n00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.510\nSo, Microsoft is trying\nto educate us as well of,\n\n224\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.140\nhey, let's go and\ntell you about what this all means.\n\n225\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.760\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and I'm not gonna click\non it because I'm gonna tell you, but\n\n226\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.360\nyou guys feel free to click on that.\n\n227\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.070\nYou really should, when you are going to\na secure website, click on that lock.\n\n228\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.430\nMake sure it is who you think it is,\nall right?\n\n229\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.540\nAll right, so that's the basic\ndomain verification in Edge.\n\n230\n00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.800\nLet's take a look at\nthe extended validation and\n\n231\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.170\nhow that displays in the Edge browser.\n\n232\n00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.930\nSo I'm over here at PayPal.\n\n233\n00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:45.170\nAnd if I zoom into my address bar, notice\nit looks a little bit different, right?\n\n234\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.170\nI've got the lock, and the lock is green.\n\n235\n00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.380\nAnd then I have some words\nnext to it that are green and\n\n236\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.570\nthen my URL, paypal.com which is\nwhere I'm trying to go, right?\n\n237\n00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.490\nThis is the extended\nvalidation view in Edge.\n\n238\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.240\nAnd what it's showing me,\nthe lock is telling me, yes, it's HTTPS so\n\n239\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.670\nyour data is encrypted.\n\n240\n00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:08.860\nAnd then it's also showing\nme this is PayPal, Inc [US].\n\n241\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.800\nIt's verifying the identify of the website\n\n242\n00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.490\nas well as the fact that\nmy data is being encrypted.\n\n243\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.600\nSo now I've got a little\nadditional verification,\n\n244\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.210\nthat's the extended validation.\n\n245\n00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.360\nIf I come over here and\n\n246\n00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.790\nhover on it, it gives me even more\ninformation than the other one did, right?\n\n247\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.750\nIt says VeriSign has identified the site,\njust like before, that it's PayPal.\n\n248\n00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.040\nBut notice it says San Jose,\nCalifornia, US.\n\n249\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.520\nIt's got a little more information.\n\n250\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.340\nIt's not telling me just that\nmy connection is secure.\n\n251\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.090\nIt's also telling me who I'm connected to.\n\n252\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.470\nThat's that extended validation\nthat we wanna look for\n\n253\n00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.540\nwhen we are connecting\nto these secure sites.\n\n254\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:49.160\nAll right, now let's check out another\nbrowser and see how it shows up.\n\n255\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.690\nThis is good old Internet explorer 11.\n\n256\n00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:56.930\nSo if anybody is still running this\nbrowser, it is actually still available in\n\n257\n00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:02.130\nWindows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7,\nthe support will end soon, but anyway.\n\n258\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.750\nA lot of people still\nuse Internet Explorer.\n\n259\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.330\nSo let's take a look at\nhow it displays things.\n\n260\n00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.950\nWith Internet Explorer and\nthe domain validation,\n\n261\n00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.670\nthe basic one, I can see HTTPS\nat the beginning of my URL, and\n\n262\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.440\nI can also see a little lock to\nthe far right of that address bar.\n\n263\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.430\nAnd if I click on that lock, it will tell\nme that GeoTrust has identified the site\n\n264\n00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.370\nas google.com, all right?\n\n265\n00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.630\nSo that's that basic validation.\n\n266\n00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.370\nIf we take a look at the extended\nvalidation in Internet Explorer 11,\n\n267\n00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.450\nI'll see that the entire\naddress bar turns green,\n\n268\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.650\nreally giving me that\nvisual indicator that, hey,\n\n269\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:43.160\nthis is even more validated,\nif that's proper English, right?\n\n270\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.840\nYou should feel ever safer.\n\n271\n00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.210\nLet's go and\nlook at what it says up there.\n\n272\n00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.700\nNot only do I get my lock and\nthe address bar is green, I also see\n\n273\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.990\na little more information identified by\nand what that should say is verify there.\n\n274\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.990\nBut I can see, hey,\nthis is PayPal Incorporated.\n\n275\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.110\nSo they've actually gone and talked\nto PayPal and said, hey, is this you?\n\n276\n00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.210\nDid you request this certificate?\n\n277\n00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.250\nWho's requesting it?\n\n278\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.460\nAre you sure you want this?\n\n279\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.790\nAll right,\nthey're doing a lot more verification.\n\n280\n00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.250\nAnd I can see here,\nagain, more information\n\n281\n00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.580\nin that little window than I did\nwith just the domain validation.\n\n282\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it looks like all of these\ndifferent browsers are doing the same\n\n283\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.220\nthing, but they have their own flavor\nof how they want to look with like,\n\n284\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.320\nhighlight the whole thing or\nnot highlight the thing.\n\n285\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.020\nOr the left or the right,\nall those different things.\n\n286\n00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.390\n&gt;&gt; And that's really what I wanted to\npoint out here is there's no standard,\n\n287\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.940\nunfortunately, for\nhow they should do this in their browser.\n\n288\n00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.970\nWe all know we need to\nshow that information but\n\n289\n00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.650\nthey can choose to do it\nhowever they want to do it.\n\n290\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:41.720\nThere is no standard.\n\n291\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.410\nSo what you need to do is go,\nokay, how does my favorite browser\n\n292\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.960\ndisplay this information so\nthat I know what to look for?\n\n293\n00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.467\nLet's take a look at Chrome,\nanother popular browser out there.\n\n294\n00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:56.998\nAnd I can see at Google,\nI get secure, and a lock.\n\n295\n00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.576\nAgain, this is the domain validation,\nthe basic one.\n\n296\n00:15:59.576 --> 00:16:02.474\nAnd I see the HTTPS And it's in green.\n\n297\n00:16:02.474 --> 00:16:06.060\n&gt;&gt; I should hope that the Google site on\nChrome browser should be somewhat secure\n\n298\n00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:06.840\nthere, right?\n\n299\n00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.500\nThey are the same people [LAUGH].\n\n300\n00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.000\n&gt;&gt; It is an interesting one side story.\n\n301\n00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000\nIt's like why am I securing my search?\n\n302\n00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.370\nDo I care if people see\nwhat I'm searching for?\n\n303\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.360\nBut it does add a little bit of privacy,\nwhich is something we all worry about.\n\n304\n00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.450\nIf I click on this, Google displays it,\nor Chrome, I should say,\n\n305\n00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.160\ndisplays it a little bit differently.\n\n306\n00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.810\nBut this is their basic validation.\n\n307\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.290\nIt says, secure and HTTPS.\n\n308\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.420\nNow, if we go to PayPal, again,\nwe'll see a slight difference.\n\n309\n00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:36.190\nA little more information,\nshowing that more in-depth validation.\n\n310\n00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.914\nSo I've got the green lock, but\nI also see PayPal, Inc [US].\n\n311\n00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.740\nAnd if I click on it,\n\n312\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.870\nit really doesn't look a whole\nlot different here, all right?\n\n313\n00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:50.120\nBut I am seeing more information\nup there in that address bar.\n\n314\n00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.680\nLast one I wanna show here is Firefox.\n\n315\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.150\nAnd Firefox and Chrome are very similar.\n\n316\n00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.110\nSo you can see that it\nlooks a lot kinda the same.\n\n317\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.280\nBut we can see the green lock up there for\nthe basic validation.\n\n318\n00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.780\nI have to go with the PayPal,\nwith the extended validation,\n\n319\n00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.360\nI can see the lock and\na little more information, all right?\n\n320\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.020\nSo those are the different browsers and\n\n321\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.440\nhow we can tell, one,\nif my connection is secure and then,\n\n322\n00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.690\ntwo, if they have gone at the next\nstep and done the extended validation.\n\n323\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.105\nNow there's nothing wrong with\njust domain validation and\n\n324\n00:17:21.105 --> 00:17:22.860\nI'm not saying that's a bad thing.\n\n325\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:26.120\nAnd that if they're not doing extended\nyou shouldn't go to the site.\n\n326\n00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.770\nWhat I am saying is if it's\nnot extended validation,\n\n327\n00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.610\nyou need to use a little more caution.\n\n328\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:37.540\nBecause it's easy for the bad guys to fake\nyou out with the basic domain validation.\n\n329\n00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.610\nWith the extended validation, much more\ndifficult because they're gonna call and\n\n330\n00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.850\nverify information.\n\n331\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.650\nWith a basic domain validation,\nit's a lot easier for\n\n332\n00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:50.620\nthe bad guys to set up fake sites that\nlook really similar to PayPal and\n\n333\n00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.840\ntry to get you to submit your information.\n\n334\n00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.560\nAnd even though it's encrypted,\nit's not actually PayPal and\n\n335\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.110\nthey're stealing whatever\ninformation you're typing in.\n\n336\n00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.120\nYour username, your password, your account\nnumbers, what have you, all right?\n\n337\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.580\nSo, again,\nnothing wrong with domain validation, but\n\n338\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.670\nyou have to be on your toes a little bit\nmore with the simple domain validation.\n\n339\n00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we need to be our own\ndetectives in making sure that we're\n\n340\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.280\nhunting down the bad guys and\nnot talking to them.\n\n341\n00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and the bad guys are smart, right?\n\n342\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.008\nThey know what is the most common typo for\nGoogle,\n\n343\n00:18:20.008 --> 00:18:24.937\nyou know leaving out the E and so\nthey will host a site that is Googl,\n\n344\n00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:29.606\nG-O-O-G-L,.com knowing a lot\nof people make that typo,\n\n345\n00:18:29.606 --> 00:18:34.388\nand or PayPal with two Ls,\nthey know that's a very common typo.\n\n346\n00:18:34.388 --> 00:18:37.908\nSo they are hoping that somebody\ntypes in PayPal.com with two Ls and\n\n347\n00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:40.934\nnotices the green lock and\njust goes about logging in, and\n\n348\n00:18:40.934 --> 00:18:45.230\nthey don't pay attention to that they're\nnot actually at the real PayPal.com.\n\n349\n00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.560\nThat's what the bad guys are hoping for.\n\n350\n00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.020\n&gt;&gt; And these sites,\nthey have the company logo on there,\n\n351\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.460\nit looks exactly like the real site.\n\n352\n00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.960\nI've been to sites where it's like,\nthis is it.\n\n353\n00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.868\nAnd like, wait,\nthat's slightly off on the logo or\n\n354\n00:18:57.868 --> 00:19:00.600\nthere's just maybe a little\nbit different green.\n\n355\n00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.990\nBut they're really good at making\nyou think that this is PayPal, or\n\n356\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.500\nthis is Google because it\nlooks exactly like it.\n\n357\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.260\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I mean,\n\n358\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.660\nI can go get those images that PayPal\nputs on their page, I can get those.\n\n359\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.600\nThe bad guys can steal the entire website,\nbasically, all the graphics, and\n\n360\n00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.410\nmake it look exactly the same.\n\n361\n00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:22.610\nMaybe the links don't work on some of\nthem, but it is easy for them to do.\n\n362\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.430\n&gt;&gt; So are there some other indications\nthat we are on a bad site?\n\n363\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.430\nLike don't do this?\n\n364\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:32.150\nDo our browsers kind of give us\nother warning besides the green for\n\n365\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.520\ngood, is there something like red for bad?\n\n366\n00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nlet's take a quick look at that, as well.\n\n367\n00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.640\nThese are, hopefully,\nmost of you out there, if you see this,\n\n368\n00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.080\nyou're gonna go something is wrong,\nit's pretty obvious within the browsers.\n\n369\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.170\nThat domain validation, that's the tricky\none because it can look really good but\n\n370\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.610\nit's not the actual site.\n\n371\n00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.530\nThe bad sites, though,\nif the certificate is invalid.\n\n372\n00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:59.830\nLike let's say that I handed Vonne's\ndrivers license to the police officer.\n\n373\n00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.710\nHe's looking at the drivers license,\nhe's looking at me.\n\n374\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:07.065\nHe's looking and he's like,\nsomething is wrong here, right?\n\n375\n00:20:07.065 --> 00:20:09.035\nAnd our browsers can do the same thing.\n\n376\n00:20:09.035 --> 00:20:11.435\nIf you're going to paypal.com and\n\n377\n00:20:11.435 --> 00:20:15.965\nthat website returns a certificate\nto your computer that says,\n\n378\n00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:21.655\nI am hulu.com, your browser is gonna say,\nwait a second, something is wrong.\n\n379\n00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:22.705\nYou're going to PayPal but\n\n380\n00:20:22.705 --> 00:20:26.410\nthe certificate says your Hulu,\nthis isn't adding up, all right?\n\n381\n00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.200\nSo the same way the police officer go,\n\n382\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.840\nthat's not you in this picture, you're\nobviously not 45, or something like that.\n\n383\n00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.270\n&gt;&gt; Your hair looks different.\n\n384\n00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.546\nDid you do something with your hair?\n\n385\n00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:37.575\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not to say that you are that old,\n\n386\n00:20:37.575 --> 00:20:39.217\nI'm just saying-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Thanks.\n\n387\n00:20:39.217 --> 00:20:41.939\n&gt;&gt; Back when I was using my fake ID,\nnot that I've ever done that.\n\n388\n00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.370\nSo, let's take a look here,\nI've got, which one am I on now?\n\n389\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.100\nEdge, and this is a site, badssl.com.\n\n390\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.920\nIt's publicly available, you guys can go\nout there and visit it, and it's safe.\n\n391\n00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.780\nYou can take a look at what these\ndifferent certificates might look\n\n392\n00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.350\nlike if they're bad.\n\n393\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.210\nAnd I'm just going to\nshow you a quick example.\n\n394\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:03.930\nHere's Edge and this is telling me,\nhey, this is not secure, something is\n\n395\n00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.990\nwrong with this website's certificate,\ndoesn't give me a lot of information.\n\n396\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.090\nIf I click details,\n\n397\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:14.130\nI can see the host name is different\nfrom the site you're trying to visit.\n\n398\n00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.300\nThis would be an example of me going to\nPayPal, but getting a certificate for\n\n399\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.250\nHulu, or PayPal blah, blah, blah.\n\n400\n00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.440\nSomething that wasn't actually PayPal.\n\n401\n00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.580\nAnd I'm not too worried\nabout the details here.\n\n402\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.750\nWhat I am worried about\nis if you see this,\n\n403\n00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.920\ndon't click go to page instead, right?\n\n404\n00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.020\nYour browser is telling\nyou something is wrong.\n\n405\n00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.480\nPay attention to it.\n\n406\n00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.800\nCheck your typing.\n\n407\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.220\nMaybe you mistyped the URL.\n\n408\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.840\nClose your browser, open it up again,\nand trying going back to that site.\n\n409\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.170\nBut something is not right.\n\n410\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.390\nAnd if you do go to the site,\nyou can get infected immediately or\n\n411\n00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.560\nthey could be capturing your information.\n\n412\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.340\nSo, again, don't go to that site.\n\n413\n00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.260\nLet's take a quick look,\nif we go to Internet Explorer,\n\n414\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.830\nwe'll see the same kind of thing.\n\n415\n00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.560\nThis site is not secure.\n\n416\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.880\nClose this tab or\nyou can get more information.\n\n417\n00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.810\nIf we go to Chrome and\nwe go to that same page,\n\n418\n00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:13.910\nyou'll see a big red up here, not secure,\nand HTTPS has a line through it.\n\n419\n00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.610\nAnd then the same information\nout there in the middle.\n\n420\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.980\nYour connection is not private.\n\n421\n00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.616\nDon't go to this site.\n\n422\n00:22:20.616 --> 00:22:23.637\nAll right, so it has a big button\nthat says, back to safety.\n\n423\n00:22:23.637 --> 00:22:25.737\nAll right, to get me back home.\n\n424\n00:22:25.737 --> 00:22:26.248\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Go back, go back.\n\n425\n00:22:26.248 --> 00:22:30.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] and\nthat last one would be Firefox here.\n\n426\n00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:36.251\nAnd again, if I click on it, you'll see\nit really doesn't do anything to my URL.\n\n427\n00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:40.820\nIt doesn't cross out the HTTPS, but\nthere is no lock up there, right?\n\n428\n00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.520\nThere's no green bar.\n\n429\n00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.200\nAnd I can see right here,\nyour connecting is not secure.\n\n430\n00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.760\nThe owner is identifying him properly.\n\n431\n00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.940\nHe doesn't like it.\n\n432\n00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.980\nGo back, don't go to this webpage,\n\n433\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.890\nI get this yellow bar going across,\nat the top here.\n\n434\n00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.000\nAnd you can see up at the top,\ninsecure connection.\n\n435\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it seems that they're using\nsome of those commonly known colors and\n\n436\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:06.785\nsymbols of green, go, red, stop,\nthe triangle with warnings.\n\n437\n00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:12.080\nSo they're trying to give us\nthose commonly known symbols.\n\n438\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.340\nIt's like, don't go here, stop.\n\n439\n00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so in the end, what I want you\nto get out of this is a couple of things.\n\n440\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.570\nWe have to be on guard,\nthe bad guys are trying to fake us out,\n\n441\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.990\nthey're trying to get us\nto submit information,\n\n442\n00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:29.370\nthey want your credit card numbers,\nthey want your log in information.\n\n443\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.260\nAnd the best way for them,\none of the easiest way for them to do it,\n\n444\n00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.600\nI should say,\nis to have you give it to them.\n\n445\n00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.873\nSo they're gonna set up fake sites that\nlook like what you wanna go to and\n\n446\n00:23:38.873 --> 00:23:43.645\nthey're going to just wait for you to type\nthe information in, collect it up and\n\n447\n00:23:43.645 --> 00:23:46.584\nthen sell it or\nuse it to buy things, or to log on.\n\n448\n00:23:46.584 --> 00:23:49.076\nAnd you might have used that\npassword in other sites and\n\n449\n00:23:49.076 --> 00:23:52.560\nnow they're gonna try that to log in,\nso it's not gonna be good day for you.\n\n450\n00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.700\nSo we've got to pay attention to that\naddress bar, we've got to look for\n\n451\n00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.110\nthat HTTPS to make sure\nour connection is secure.\n\n452\n00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.770\nWe've got to look for the validation.\n\n453\n00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.380\nIf it's simple domain validation, okay,\nwell, I know my connection is secure, but\n\n454\n00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.430\nI've got to verify that URL myself.\n\n455\n00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:11.080\nI've got to make sure that I really am on\nPayPal, and that I didn't make a typo,\n\n456\n00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.550\nand this is the actual PayPal site.\n\n457\n00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.991\nIf it's the extended validation then\neither my entire address bar turns\n\n458\n00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:21.501\ngreen or I get the extra\ninformation up there on the lock.\n\n459\n00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:26.152\nAnd that's telling me that, that\ncertificate vendor did a lot more in-depth\n\n460\n00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:30.240\nvalidation of this company before\nthey issue that certificate, and\n\n461\n00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.143\nI can feel safe putting\nmy information in there.\n\n462\n00:24:33.143 --> 00:24:36.351\nBut again,\nyour browsers are trying to help

00:24:47.305\nI feel like I've learned a lot of very\nsimple tips and tricks that I can look for\n\n466\n00:24:47.305 --> 00:24:51.265\nand be my own detective, and make sure\nthat the bad guys aren't there to get me\n\n467\n00:24:51.265 --> 00:24:54.845\nand that I know how to be secure, so\nthank you so much for all of that.\n\n468\n00:24:54.845 --> 00:24:55.775\nI hope you all enjoyed.\n\n469\n00:24:55.775 --> 00:25:01.311\nAnd stay tuned for more episodes on our\nend user security awareness series.\n\n470\n00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:04.610\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It is going great, Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:30.526 --> 00:00:33.640\nI'm excited to jump in and\ntalk about, well, trash, really.\n\n16\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.140\nWe're gonna gonna talk about\ntrash in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.432\n&gt;&gt; Garbage.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] When our data is done,\n\n18\n00:00:37.432 --> 00:00:39.396\nwe no longer need our data.\n\n19\n00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:42.407\nIt's time to ditch it and\nget rid of it and unfortunately,\n\n20\n00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:44.815\nthere is a whole lot of process and\nprocedure.\n\n21\n00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:48.761\nAnd we're gonna talk about what's kind of\nimportant to us right here in this episode\n\n22\n00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:50.274\nas we go through data disposal.\n\n23\n00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:54.018\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, I guess that brings\nup our first question, well,\n\n24\n00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:56.715\nwhat does data disposal\nmean in IT security?\n\n25\n00:00:56.715 --> 00:00:57.578\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n26\n00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:01.439\nSo the data that we possess has what's\ncalled a useful lifetime, right?\n\n27\n00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:02.377\nAll data does.\n\n28\n00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:06.668\nIf I send Daniel email and it says,\nhey, do you wanna go to lunch today?\n\n29\n00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:11.092\nWell, that email has relevance\nright up until lunchtime.\n\n30\n00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:14.265\nAfter lunchtime that email is no\nlonger relevant at all, right?\n\n31\n00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:16.067\nSo it's usefulness has expired and\n\n32\n00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:18.776\nI could delete that email\nnobody would care, right?\n\n33\n00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:21.811\nI might have patient medical records,\nthough.\n\n34\n00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:25.759\nAnd those I might need to keep for\nyears and years and years, but eventually,\n\n35\n00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.068\nthose become no longer relevant and\nthey need to be disposed of.\n\n36\n00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:32.352\nAnd when we say disposed of that\nmeans eliminated, gotten rid off,\n\n37\n00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:35.130\ndisappeared, or\nany mafia euphemism you can think off.\n\n38\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We eliminate that data.\n\n39\n00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.804\n&gt;&gt; It swims with the fishes, right?\n\n40\n00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:40.403\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n41\n00:01:40.403 --> 00:01:42.613\nAll data runs out of useful lifetime.\n\n42\n00:01:42.613 --> 00:01:45.205\nNow, you have collectors or hoarders.\n\n43\n00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:45.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n\n44\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.623\n&gt;&gt; People that just don't\nwanna get rid of anything.\n\n45\n00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:49.306\n&gt;&gt; So you mean normal end users.\n\n46\n00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:53.544\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a large amount and\nyou would be surprised.\n\n47\n00:01:53.544 --> 00:01:55.970\nBut the reality is that a lot\nof data isn't necessary and\n\n48\n00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.062\nthat we can get rid of it.\n\n49\n00:01:57.062 --> 00:02:00.933\nAnd when we get rid of it we have a number\nof different ways to go about it and\n\n50\n00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:05.311\nthat's really what data disposal is all\nabout is choosing the right way to destroy\n\n51\n00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:05.961\nthat data.\n\n52\n00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:09.754\nAnd doing it in a way where\nit's nonrecoverable, right?\n\n53\n00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.647\nData disposal should be permanent.\n\n54\n00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:15.872\nThat data is gone and it cannot come\nback and that's the end of it, right?\n\n55\n00:02:15.872 --> 00:02:16.762\n&gt;&gt; The zombie data.\n\n56\n00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:20.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like that song the cat\ncame back the very next day.\n\n57\n00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.060\nSo you don't want your data to come back.\n\n58\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.895\nIt needs to go away and be gone and\nnot just gone for you but gone for\n\n59\n00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:30.588\neverybody else because data passed its\nuseful lifetime becomes a liability,\n\n60\n00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:31.672\na legal, right?\n\n61\n00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:36.447\nSo, for example, let's say that I\nam really really good about killing\n\n62\n00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:39.083\noff data that I no longer need, right?\n\n63\n00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.441\nSo I might have\na historical customer data.\n\n64\n00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:43.145\nI don't need anymore, I get rid of it.\n\n65\n00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:47.532\nAnd somebody hacks into my site and\nthey steal all my customer information.\n\n66\n00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:51.359\nOkay, well, they got all of my\ncurrent customer information.\n\n67\n00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.036\nBut I didn't have the old customer\ndata anymore, I disposed of that.\n\n68\n00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:58.760\nSo my current customers, yeah,\nI have just leaked their data, that's bad.\n\n69\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.481\nBut at least it was kept\nto that smaller group.\n\n70\n00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.244\nIf I had been a data hoarder and kept\ndata for years and years and years ago,\n\n71\n00:03:05.244 --> 00:03:08.948\nnow when the hacker breaks in not only\ndo they get my current customers but\n\n72\n00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:11.338\nthey got all my historical\ncustomers as well.\n\n73\n00:03:11.338 --> 00:03:14.880\nAnd the attack just became\nthat much more significant.\n\n74\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.093\nI've got to inform a lot more people.\n\n75\n00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:20.413\nWhen it comes to medical records,\nfinancial records,\n\n76\n00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:23.246\nall of those it opens you\nup to a bigger lawsuit.\n\n77\n00:03:23.246 --> 00:03:26.767\nIf the data is somehow compromised\nit's more people affected.\n\n78\n00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.081\nSo we need to keep that to a minimum.\n\n79\n00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:28.776\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\n\n80\n00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:32.711\nis there a standard set of time in which\nwe should keep data laying around?\n\n81\n00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.016\nThat varies, right?\n\n82\n00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:36.127\nSo there's a concept called\ndata retention, right?\n\n83\n00:03:36.127 --> 00:03:41.425\nAnd data retention if it's your personal\ndata it'll usually isn't a defined period,\n\n84\n00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:45.879\nbut depending on the industry you work in,\nit is very common to have that.\n\n85\n00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.699\nSo for example, Daniel and I,\nwe used to work at an insurance company.\n\n86\n00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:54.577\nAnd at the insurance company any insurance\nclaim, we had to maintain that data for\n\n87\n00:03:54.577 --> 00:03:55.432\nseven years.\n\n88\n00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:58.204\nSo after seven years, we didn't have\nto maintain that claim data anymore,\n\n89\n00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:59.342\nwe could get rid of it, right?\n\n90\n00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:02.236\nBut we had a whole warehouse\nthat contained paper documents.\n\n91\n00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:03.492\nI don't know if you ever went in that,\ndid you?\n\n92\n00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:04.400\n&gt;&gt; I've been there many, many times.\n\n93\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.344\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fun building.\n\n94\n00:04:06.344 --> 00:04:06.963\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n95\n00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:09.173\n&gt;&gt; It's like the end of Indiana Jones\nwhere you've got the giant boxes\n\n96\n00:04:09.173 --> 00:04:11.212\neverywhere and the Ark of\nthe Covenant is in there somewhere.\n\n97\n00:04:11.212 --> 00:04:15.473\nBut that data we kept, but\nas soon as that data was no longer needed\n\n98\n00:04:15.473 --> 00:04:18.584\nit was destroyed,\nit was eliminated, right?\n\n99\n00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:22.458\nThat was defined by the government\nbecause it was a regulated industry.\n\n100\n00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:24.355\nYour medical records may be the same way.\n\n101\n00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:26.116\nBut even in a non-regulated industry,\n\n102\n00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:28.927\nthere's another scenario where\nyou might have to retain data.\n\n103\n00:04:28.927 --> 00:04:32.043\nAnd that's if there's litigation,\npending litigation.\n\n104\n00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:36.142\nThat as long as there's a lawsuit\nsurrounding a certain set of data,\n\n105\n00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:39.266\nyou've got to keep the data and\nmaybe even forever.\n\n106\n00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:43.174\nAnd I remember the bank that I worked at,\nanytime that we had a mortgage or\n\n107\n00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:45.928\nsomething like that,\nthat was out for somebody and\n\n108\n00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:48.382\nthey went through a bankruptcy proceeding.\n\n109\n00:04:48.382 --> 00:04:50.926\nWell, that bankruptcy could last years and\nyears and years.\n\n110\n00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:54.716\nSo their data, we might have only been\nrequired to keep it for three years but\n\n111\n00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:58.113\nbecause there was a lawsuit,\nwe kept it until the lawsuit was over.\n\n112\n00:04:58.113 --> 00:05:00.361\nSo it was an indeterminate\nretention period,\n\n113\n00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:01.982\nyou keep it as long as you need it.\n\n114\n00:05:01.982 --> 00:05:05.086\nSo there's exceptions,\nthere's changes, there's variations.\n\n115\n00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:07.950\nYou need to talk to your supervisor,\nyour IT department, and\n\n116\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.055\nthey will let you know\nwhat that interval is.\n\n117\n00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:13.300\nIf you don't know and they don't know,\nthen that's where you need to get your\n\n118\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.710\nlegal department involved, that your\ncounsel for the company or organization.\n\n119\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.249\nThey will tell you what your\nresponsibility is cuz you may have a legal\n\n120\n00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.655\nresponsibility and if you're not doing it,\nyou could be held liable for that, too.\n\n121\n00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:27.460\nIf you're supposed to be keeping\nrecords for seven years and\n\n122\n00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.929\nyou're destroying them after three years,\nyou could go to jail for that.\n\n123\n00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:32.465\nThat could be obscuring justice.\n\n124\n00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.473\nThey could be all,\nnot obscuring, obstructing.\n\n125\n00:05:34.473 --> 00:05:35.038\n&gt;&gt; Obstructing.\n&gt;&gt; Obstructing.\n\n126\n00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:36.469\n&gt;&gt; Obstructing justice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.035\n&gt;&gt; We're just not gonna mess\n\n128\n00:05:37.035 --> 00:05:37.656\naround with it a little bit.\n\n129\n00:05:37.656 --> 00:05:39.532\n&gt;&gt; There was justice,\nwe just can't see it very well.\n\n130\n00:05:39.532 --> 00:05:42.259\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that could be obstructing and\n\n131\n00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.758\nyou don't want that, right?\n\n132\n00:05:43.758 --> 00:05:45.384\nSo we need to understand\nwhat our responsibility is.\n\n133\n00:05:45.384 --> 00:05:48.877\nAnd you wanna do, this is one of those\ncases where you wanna do the bare minimum.\n\n134\n00:05:48.877 --> 00:05:50.586\nNormally, I wanna give 110%.\n\n135\n00:05:50.586 --> 00:05:51.091\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n136\n00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:53.848\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna retain data for\n110% of the period.\n\n137\n00:05:53.848 --> 00:05:56.828\nYou just wanna do the minimum and\nthen get rid of that data.\n\n138\n00:05:56.828 --> 00:05:58.609\nThat's our responsibility to our company.\n\n139\n00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:02.257\n&gt;&gt; So Don, we've talked about different\ntypes of data, paper data, digital data.\n\n140\n00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:06.509\nAnd when it comes to IT, they only\ncare about the digital data, right?\n\n141\n00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.073\nWell, you think that, right?\n\n142\n00:06:08.073 --> 00:06:10.633\nIn IT, in information technology\nwe care about computers and\n\n143\n00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:11.774\nthe data in the computers.\n\n144\n00:06:11.774 --> 00:06:16.685\nBut the real weakness in an organization\nusually comes down to paper data.\n\n145\n00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:20.137\nThat most people cannot exist\nin a digital only world.\n\n146\n00:06:20.137 --> 00:06:23.843\nEven millennials that are getting out\nthere if you're in the financial industry\n\n147\n00:06:23.843 --> 00:06:27.111\nyou will end up printing receipts,\nyou will end up printing invoices,\n\n148\n00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:28.925\npurchase orders, that kind of stuff.\n\n149\n00:06:28.925 --> 00:06:33.215\nWe print a lot of data that contains\naccount numbers, that contains sensitive\n\n150\n00:06:33.215 --> 00:06:36.532\nor personal identifiable information,\nthings like that.\n\n151\n00:06:36.532 --> 00:06:41.267\nSo that paper data becomes a big risk for\nan organization.\n\n152\n00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:44.542\nAnd so, we need to make sure that\nthat's being properly disposed of.\n\n153\n00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:48.031\nAnd when I say properly,\nI don't mean you crumbled up in a ball and\n\n154\n00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.342\nyou pitch a three pointer into\nthe nearest trashcan, right?\n\n155\n00:06:51.342 --> 00:06:52.383\n&gt;&gt; That's one is that maybe.\n\n156\n00:06:52.383 --> 00:06:53.856\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And well,\n\n157\n00:06:53.856 --> 00:06:56.669\nI guess I should clarify\nbecause sometimes that's okay.\n\n158\n00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:01.700\nYour company might actually leverage\na commercial shredding service.\n\n159\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.816\nNow, document shredders,\nthey've been around a long time.\n\n160\n00:07:03.816 --> 00:07:07.337\nIf I have a paper document like this one\nand I don't want anybody to get the data\n\n161\n00:07:07.337 --> 00:07:10.007\nthat's on this,\nI can run it through a shredder, right?\n\n162\n00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:12.644\nAnd that'll dice it up, and\nturn it into little pieces.\n\n163\n00:07:12.644 --> 00:07:14.072\nI mean, I've got a little image here.\n\n164\n00:07:14.072 --> 00:07:17.085\nSo what you see here is a shredder,\na heavily used one.\n\n165\n00:07:17.085 --> 00:07:20.819\nAnd they're feeding paper\ninto the slots here, right?\n\n166\n00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.133\nAnd you'll see all those little\nblades inside of that slot.\n\n167\n00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:27.001\nThe lid has actually been removed from\nthe shredder so you can see the blades.\n\n168\n00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:29.348\nAnd it cuts the paper into strips.\n\n169\n00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:32.582\nAnd when that happens the data\nis still there, right?\n\n170\n00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:36.263\nIt's just really hard to put that data\nback together again cuz it's diced into\n\n171\n00:07:36.263 --> 00:07:37.337\nthese little pieces.\n\n172\n00:07:37.337 --> 00:07:41.012\nAnd in fact, a lot of newer shredder's\ndo what's called, cross shredding, where\n\n173\n00:07:41.012 --> 00:07:44.760\nbeneath these blades, there's another set\nof blades going in the other direction.\n\n174\n00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.357\nSo instead of cutting it into strips,\nit's cutting into little tiny squares.\n\n175\n00:07:48.357 --> 00:07:51.055\nAnd the reason they do\nthat is that somebody,\n\n176\n00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:55.173\nactually a couple of different people,\nwrote a program where you can\n\n177\n00:07:55.173 --> 00:07:58.446\ntake all of these strips and\nscam them into a computer.\n\n178\n00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:01.552\nAnd the computer could then reassemble\nthem, and rebuild the document,\n\n179\n00:08:01.552 --> 00:08:04.050\nran a little algorithm,\nput it all back together.\n\n180\n00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.130\nSo if somebody goes and does what\n\n181\n00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.520\nDaniel talked about in the social\nengineering episode, dumpster diving.\n\n182\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.450\nSomebody goes to the trash bins\nthrough your company after hours.\n\n183\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.510\nWho has a security camera\npointing at their trash cans?\n\n184\n00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, who cares about the trash right?\n\n185\n00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.150\nBut it's a great place\nto gather information,\n\n186\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.600\nthat people may have thought\nwas innocuous even, right?\n\n187\n00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n188\n00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.430\na lot of times I tell people\njust shred everything, right?\n\n189\n00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.510\nJust get shredders.\n\n190\n00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.810\nIt's too hard for us now there's\ncross shredders to be able to\n\n191\n00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.190\nrecompile them into the actual\nobject that it once was,\n\n192\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.750\nunless you have something\nlike that digital thing.\n\n193\n00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so if somebody can get that\nout of your trash can, they can then take\n\n194\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.730\nit back to their warehouse, or whatever,\nand take their time and lay it out.\n\n195\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.440\n&gt;&gt; At their leisure.\n\n196\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Scan it and then let\nthe computer try and reassemble and\n\n197\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.180\nput that data back together.\n\n198\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.780\nThat's the type of thing that happens.\n\n199\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.388\nNow, if you don't even shred,\nthe paper is just there in the trash can.\n\n200\n00:08:53.388 --> 00:08:58.150\nthey can dig through, pull out, look at\nit, so we need that to be done in a more\n\n201\n00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.310\nsecure manner and commercial shredding\nservices are great for that.\n\n202\n00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.580\nYour company may have that,\n\n203\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.040\nspecial trash cans that are actually\nlabeled as shredded documents.\n\n204\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.720\nThey're usually locked, you know\nhave a little pad lock on them, and\n\n205\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.860\na big slot across the top that\nyou drop the papers in, so\n\n206\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.210\nyou can't get the papers back\nout once they're in there.\n\n207\n00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.760\nAnd the companies will come around and\npick them up once a week, and\n\n208\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.970\nthey'll shred them or\nthey'll incinerate them.\n\n209\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.730\nThat's a great way, it's just really hard\nto put something back together again once-\n\n210\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.586\n&gt;&gt; That would be difficult.\n\n211\n00:09:22.586 --> 00:09:26.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know if it's\nimpossible, it probably is impossible.\n\n212\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.530\n&gt;&gt; It probably is impossible.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n213\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.890\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n214\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.520\nput my money on impossible.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.790\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, I'm not a genius\n\n216\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.700\nby any stretch of the imagination,\nbut I think I've come up\n\n217\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.080\nwith a solution to our problem.\nWe just stop printing documents, right?\n\n218\n00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.050\n&gt;&gt; That would really help, right?\n\n219\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.560\nIf we don't print the documents that\nsolves the paper problem, right?\n\n220\n00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.840\nBut the reality is,\nyou're gonna need to print.\n\n221\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.220\nSo make sure that if your company\nhas a secure shredding service,\n\n222\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.300\nthat you are using it.\n\n223\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.790\nThat you're using the marked and\n\n224\n00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.580\ndesignated trash cans that\nyou're supposed to use.\n\n225\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.560\nIf you don't have a shredding service you\nmight want to look into getting one, or\n\n226\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.690\nat least get a personal shredder for\nyour area.\n\n227\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.790\nBut really, this is a company-wide policy.\n\n228\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.500\nYour company needs to be doing this.\n\n229\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.890\nIf you wanna play it safe and\njust don't distribute data by paper,\n\n230\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:09.770\nyou can certainly do that.\n\n231\n00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.030\nIf you can go all digital, you're helping\nthe environment which is nice, but\n\n232\n00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.380\nyou're also making it much\neasier to protect privacy.\n\n233\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.990\nWell, that's true,\n\n234\n00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:23.370\nalthough as a society we have this habit\nof getting new computers all the time,\n\n235\n00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.838\nwe get new computers every\ncouple of years, hopefully.\n\n236\n00:10:25.838 --> 00:10:27.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.006\n&gt;&gt; And so, you\n\n238\n00:10:28.006 --> 00:10:29.650\nstay with a nice new computer.\n\n239\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.132\nWell what happens to your old computer?\n\n240\n00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.730\nYour old computer has a hard drive in it.\n\n241\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:38.200\nThe hard drive stores data,\nand that data is accessible.\n\n242\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.234\nAnd so, if I just take my computer and\nthrow it in the trash,\n\n243\n00:10:41.234 --> 00:10:44.638\nsomebody could dumpster dive,\nthey could get that computer out,\n\n244\n00:10:44.638 --> 00:10:47.883\nthey could pull the hard drive and\nlift data right out off of it.\n\n245\n00:10:47.883 --> 00:10:50.736\nEven in a networked environment where\nyou say all my documents are in\n\n246\n00:10:50.736 --> 00:10:53.660\nthe Network Share,\nmy documents aren't on the computer.\n\n247\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.290\nWell your computer caches copies of those\ndocuments while you're editing them.\n\n248\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.130\nYou're not actually working from\nthe network the whole time.\n\n249\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.090\nAnd then, when you save it,\nthen it's saving it to the network.\n\n250\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.220\nSo they can recover those cache files.\n\n251\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.520\nAnd they can actually get the data\nright off of those drives.\n\n252\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.570\nSo when you have an old\ncomputer that's going away,\n\n253\n00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.460\nyou shouldn't just throw it in the trash.\n\n254\n00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.740\nIf you have a full sized IT department,\n\n255\n00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.280\nthey'll have a asset\nmanagement system in place.\n\n256\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.050\nSo the computers they don't\njust go in the trash, right?\n\n257\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.020\nThey gotta go clear it with\nthe accounting department,\n\n258\n00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.620\ncuz they do depreciated values and\n\n259\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.640\nalso accounting stuff with it and they-\n&gt;&gt; I just have in my mind a picture\n\n260\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.480\nof well, I've got my new computer, Bob, so\n\n261\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.190\nI'm just gonna drop this\nin the garbage bin.\n\n262\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.360\nProbably not what's happening,\neven in most businesses, right?\n\n263\n00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.375\n&gt;&gt; Well, sometimes they allow employees\nto keep their old computers, right?\n\n264\n00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:41.000\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n265\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.390\n&gt;&gt; Or they do an employee garage sale, and\nemployees have the option to buy the old\n\n266\n00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.140\ncomputers and people take them and turn\nthem into computers for their kids, right?\n\n267\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.320\nWhich will last for a year or\n\n268\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.158\ntwo and then when that's done,\nthen they get thrown in the trash.\n\n269\n00:11:54.158 --> 00:11:54.820\nCuz now you're at home,\n\n270\n00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.020\nyou don't have an IT department\nto help you dispose of that data.\n\n271\n00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.024\nMaybe there's a recycling program\nin your town for E-waste, right?\n\n272\n00:12:03.024 --> 00:12:06.290\nWell is that recycling firm or\ne-waste company,\n\n273\n00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.110\ndo they care about your data privacy?\n\n274\n00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.910\nNot one bit.\n\n275\n00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.490\nThey just take the computer and\neither destroy it, recycle it,\n\n276\n00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.090\nor ship it off to, unfortunately ship it\noff to China and India a lot of times.\n\n277\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n278\n00:12:16.665 --> 00:12:20.525\nAnd so the junk that was here\nbecomes junk over there.\n\n279\n00:12:20.525 --> 00:12:23.845\nSo if an attacker wants,\nthey can go to these giant junkyards and\n\n280\n00:12:23.845 --> 00:12:24.945\njust start pulling hard drives.\n\n281\n00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:27.915\nHard drives will actually take\na pretty good beating from weather and\n\n282\n00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:31.585\nstill be readable, so it could be sitting\nout there rusting in the rain for\n\n283\n00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:34.915\na year and they could still recover\ndata off of it pretty easily,\n\n284\n00:12:34.915 --> 00:12:37.110\nnot even putting forth a lot of effort.\n\n285\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.440\nSo that data that's on our computer,\nthat needs to be purged.\n\n286\n00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.100\nIt needs to be cleaned, and\nit needs to be done in a proper manner.\n\n287\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:49.280\nNow the odds are, you are not gonna\nbe the one expected to do that.\n\n288\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.040\nYour IT department should be doing it.\n\n289\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.070\nThey clean the machines, right?\n\n290\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.510\nBut let me explain the process\nthat happens here, so\n\n291\n00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.000\nyou guys understand why that's done,\nright?\n\n292\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.200\nComputers and hard drives,\nthey write using magnetic media, right?\n\n293\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.140\nWe have some that are using flash drives\nnow, which are a little bit different, but\n\n294\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.970\nmost of the computers that businesses use\ntoday are still working on spinning disks,\n\n295\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:14.170\ntraditional hard drives are hard\ndrives that look like this.\n\n296\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.350\nSo, this is what a normal spinning\ndisk looks like inside of a computer.\n\n297\n00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.400\nAnd its got a metal platter or\nsometimes it's glass coated in metal but\n\n298\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.470\nit is a metal platter and\nwhen we write 1s and 0s to it,\n\n299\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.620\nit's little magnetic charges\nthey can put on the disk, okay?\n\n300\n00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.950\nWhen you delete a file, the file\ntechnically still exists on the disk,\n\n301\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.590\nit just has a little marker\non it that says it's deleted.\n\n302\n00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.550\nThe file name is gone but\nthe file's data is still there.\n\n303\n00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:42.460\nAnd a forensics expert or\na social engineer,\n\n304\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.370\nan attacker can still lift that data off\nthe disk even if the data's been deleted,\n\n305\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.120\neven if the computer hard drive\nhas been formatted, right?\n\n306\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.290\nAnd let me explain how that works.\n\n307\n00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.550\nYou might have done this as a kid.\n\n308\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.480\nI know like my sister,\nshe would write notes on a notepad,\n\n309\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.540\nand then she'd tear the paper off,\ntear the top sheet of paper off.\n\n310\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.040\nSo when I grabbed the notepad,\nit looked like this.\n\n311\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.770\n&gt;&gt; Blank as the driven snow, right?\n\n312\n00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.973\n&gt;&gt; But you can take a black crayon,\nand slide across the top of it, or\n\n313\n00:14:06.973 --> 00:14:10.178\nsome graphite powder, or whatever and\nsprinkle it on there, and\n\n314\n00:14:10.178 --> 00:14:13.520\nall of a sudden the words that she\nhad written would show up, right?\n\n315\n00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.610\nSo she had written the word dictionary,\npow it pops up.\n\n316\n00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.980\nBecause I can see the imprint\non the paper, okay?\n\n317\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.750\nWell that's how these hard drives are.\n\n318\n00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.380\nIt's not a true imprint,\nit's a magnetic signature, right?\n\n319\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.240\nBut it works the same way.\n\n320\n00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.600\nA forensic expert or a hacker can look at\nyour old hard drive, and even if it's been\n\n321\n00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.926\nformatted to a nice white slate, they can\nsprinkle digital graphite powder, right?\n\n322\n00:14:34.926 --> 00:14:36.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They can run a forensic\n\n323\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.440\nutility across it and\nstart to recover that data.\n\n324\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.230\nOkay, and these tools are freely\navailable that are out there.\n\n325\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.120\nFor example,\nthere's one tool called Foremost.\n\n326\n00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.530\nThis is an example of it right here.\n\n327\n00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.570\nWe can run the Foremost\nutility against the drive.\n\n328\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.730\nThey can scan across it and\n\n329\n00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.890\nhelp us to recover files based on\nsignatures that are found on the disk.\n\n330\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.780\nThere's another tool,\none that I've used before,\n\n331\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.620\ncalled Scalpel,\nwhich is very similar, right?\n\n332\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.300\nScalpel will actually say just\ntake this chunk of the drive and\n\n333\n00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.460\npull any data off of it you can.\n\n334\n00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.300\nYou can go chunk by chunk, and that way if\nthere's corrupt data you can skip past it.\n\n335\n00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.050\nIt's a really neat tool.\n\n336\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.010\nNot neat,\nif you're the one leaking the data, right?\n\n337\n00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.210\nNeat if you're the person\ntrying to recover the data.\n\n338\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.050\nThese tools are free and\nregularly available.\n\n339\n00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.620\n&gt;&gt; And what's funny is even if you have\nput this in the recycling bin, and\n\n340\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.750\nthen emptied your recycling bin,\n\n341\n00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.740\nthese tools are able to still\nget that data a lot of the time.\n\n342\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.200\nSo don't think that just because you\nemptied your recycling bin you think it's\n\n343\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.460\ngone, not necessarily.\n\n344\n00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.190\nAlso makes me think just because you put\nsomething in the recycling bin does not\n\n345\n00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.120\nmean that it's gone.\n\n346\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.130\nSo remember to empty your\nrecycling bin in case somebody has\n\n347\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.150\naccess to that hard drive and they spin\nit up, go to the recycling bin and\n\n348\n00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.640\nthere's a bunch of data right there.\n\n349\n00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.270\n&gt;&gt; All right so how do we protect\nourselves from this, right?\n\n350\n00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.926\nYour IT department should know how.\n\n351\n00:15:45.926 --> 00:15:48.285\nIf this is your own\npersonal computer though,\n\n352\n00:15:48.285 --> 00:15:50.347\nyou're kind of left up to it on your own.\n\n353\n00:15:50.347 --> 00:15:53.099\nAnd there are techniques to fix this,\nright?\n\n354\n00:15:53.099 --> 00:15:54.882\nWhen I go back to that notepad example.\n\n355\n00:15:54.882 --> 00:15:58.290\nSo my sister wrote on a piece of paper and\nleft an imprint.\n\n356\n00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.860\nI ran a crayon across it and\nnow I can see what she wrote.\n\n357\n00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.590\nWell, what if she had used\nanother piece of paper and\n\n358\n00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.400\nwrote again, another word on top of it?\n\n359\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.450\nSo this is the word dictionary,\n\n360\n00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.640\nwhat if she wrote the world\nencyclopedia on top of it?\n\n361\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.370\nIt becomes harder to read.\n\n362\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.720\nWhat if she did it again,\nwrote another word like the word library?\n\n363\n00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.460\nNow it becomes even harder to read.\n\n364\n00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.260\nAnd then another word like philosopher.\n\n365\n00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.980\nNow, I can't tell any of the words.\n\n366\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.440\nAs they stack on top of each other,\n\n367\n00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.120\nit becomes impossible to differentiate\nthe words that are underneath.\n\n368\n00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.199\n&gt;&gt; This is like Cyrilic.\n\n369\n00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:32.055\n[LAUGH] It looks like a crazy language.\n\n370\n00:16:32.055 --> 00:16:34.718\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just some cursive font\nthat I found before the show.\n\n371\n00:16:34.718 --> 00:16:37.265\n[LAUGH] l try to write it by hand.\n\n372\n00:16:37.265 --> 00:16:40.043\n&gt;&gt; I mean now it looks like\na foreign language to me.\n\n373\n00:16:40.043 --> 00:16:43.813\nYou completely can't read it.\n\n374\n00:16:43.813 --> 00:16:44.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it does, it's kind of like\na J.R.R. Tolkien elf thing or something.\n\n375\n00:16:44.775 --> 00:16:47.081\n&gt;&gt; Elven [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So the point is, though,\n\n376\n00:16:47.081 --> 00:16:48.750\nthat this is now defeated.\n\n377\n00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:53.550\nAnd it was defeated because it\nwas written over more than once.\n\n378\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.143\nAnd that's what we can\ndo with our hard drives.\n\n379\n00:16:55.143 --> 00:16:59.970\nThat when you no longer need that\ncomputer you can take the hard drive and\n\n380\n00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:04.081\noverwrite the data multiple times,\nand that protects you.\n\n381\n00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:05.677\nNow, how do you do that, right,\n\n382\n00:17:05.677 --> 00:17:08.730\ncuz how am I gonna write to\nmy whole disk multiple times?\n\n383\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.670\nYou're not gonna do it by hand,\nyou're gonna use an automated system.\n\n384\n00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.740\nSo for example,\nhere's a program that's called DBAN.\n\n385\n00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.200\nDBAN is a very commonly used program.\n\n386\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.015\nIt's free,\nwhich is why it's commonly used.\n\n387\n00:17:19.015 --> 00:17:21.600\n[LAUGH] There are commercial programs too.\n\n388\n00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.630\nBut what it allows you to do is take\na hard drive and erase it by writing data\n\n389\n00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:31.620\non it, writing all zeros, or\nall ones, or random zeros and ones.\n\n390\n00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.216\nAnd not just doing it once,\nyou can do it more than once.\n\n391\n00:17:34.216 --> 00:17:37.693\nIf you look, see how there's several\ndifferent levels of the DOD,\n\n392\n00:17:37.693 --> 00:17:41.851\nthe Department of Defense method that we\ncan use, or OPS 2, The Gut Men, PRNG.\n\n393\n00:17:41.851 --> 00:17:44.140\nThere's all sorts of different techniques.\n\n394\n00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.420\nAnd some of them might just do one pass,\nwhere they just overwrite it one time.\n\n395\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.295\nWell, going back to my example, if I just\noverwrite it one time I can probably\n\n396\n00:17:53.295 --> 00:17:57.496\nlook at that and I see the word\nencyclopedia pretty clearly there.\n\n397\n00:17:57.496 --> 00:18:00.542\nThe word dictionary is harder to tell but\nI might be able to figure that out.\n\n398\n00:18:00.542 --> 00:18:01.958\n&gt;&gt; I can still make it out, yeah.\n\n399\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:06.360\n&gt;&gt; So one pass is decent, but not perfect.\n\n400\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.970\nIt's not like here where\nI had four things.\n\n401\n00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.340\nNow it's really, really, really good.\n\n402\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.440\nSo when they run programs\nlike these they can tell it,\n\n403\n00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.060\nI want you to overwrite\nthe disk seven times.\n\n404\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.838\nAnd they can sit there and do this.\n\n405\n00:18:18.838 --> 00:18:20.956\nSeven times, writing ones and\nzeroes, overwriting it.\n\n406\n00:18:20.956 --> 00:18:24.604\nAnd now if anybody were to recover this\ndisk, they wont be able to get any data\n\n407\n00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:28.480\noff it, anything useful, just this\ngeneric data that's been written.\n\n408\n00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.430\nSo this is part of the technique\nthat your IT department will use\n\n409\n00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.620\nwhen properly disposing of a computer.\n\n410\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.830\nSo if you ever see a really old computer\nin your company, and you're like man,\n\n411\n00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.170\nI could take that home for the kids, and\n\n412\n00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.240\nthe IT department says no,\nthis is usually why.\n\n413\n00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.410\nThey need to sanitize it.\n\n414\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.370\nThey need to clear the data off of it.\n\n415\n00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.360\nAnd if the data is really sensitive,\nthey might not even trust this.\n\n416\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.626\nBecause remember with the shredder example\nhow I said that if we shred the document,\n\n417\n00:18:53.626 --> 00:18:56.752\npeople have gotten really\nsophisticated and they find ways so\n\n418\n00:18:56.752 --> 00:18:59.900\nthey can reassemble this,\nsay use a computer to do it.\n\n419\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.320\nThat there are ways where like the NSA,\nthe big guys.\n\n420\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.815\nThey can sometimes recover data even\nwhen it's been multiple erased.\n\n421\n00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.900\nAnd multiple erasing\nlike this it takes time.\n\n422\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.150\nIt can take 24 hours, it can take two to\nthree days sometimes to do these passes.\n\n423\n00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.170\nOn a really large hard drive\nthat can take days to erase it.\n\n424\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.940\nSo a lot of IT departments have\nstarted to say you know what,\n\n425\n00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.410\nwe just don't have time for that.\n\n426\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.690\nSo instead they leverage\nmechanical shredders.\n\n427\n00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.690\nThis shredder is a lot different\nthan a paper shredder.\n\n428\n00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:29.872\nLook at the size of\nthe teeth on those wheels.\n\n429\n00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:31.040\n&gt;&gt; Don't get your hands\ncaught in that [LAUGH].\n\n430\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.070\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah, that would not end well.\n\n431\n00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.500\nAnd they'll just put the whole hard drive\nin here, or even the whole computer,\n\n432\n00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.090\nif it's big enough.\n\n433\n00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:37.840\nThis one's not big enough.\n\n434\n00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.300\nThis is big enough for a hard drive.\n\n435\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.700\nBut they can drop the whole hard drive\nin there and it'll just destroy it.\n\n436\n00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.440\nBy destroying the drive they can\nguarantee that there's no data on it.\n\n437\n00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.480\nAnd this is why when you go on eBay and\nyou try and look for\n\n438\n00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.930\nused computers, you'll find tons of\ncomputers for sale with no hard drive.\n\n439\n00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.820\nAnd that's why, is it'll be some bank or\nhospital, that they're done with\n\n440\n00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.670\nthe computer, they just wanna sell it and\nget whatever money they can out of it.\n\n441\n00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:03.940\nThey destroy the hard drive and so\nnow they know they're not leaking data.\n\n442\n00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.590\nWhen you buy a laptop or something on\neBay, you'd be surprised if you run a data\n\n443\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.590\nforensic's utility on it, you can recover\nall sorts of data from the previous owner\n\n444\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.160\nif they didn't take some\nbasic steps to protect it.\n\n445\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.350\nSo that's kind of a key thing when\nwe deal with disposing of our data,\n\n446\n00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.840\nsaying we no longer need this,\nit's time to get rid of it.\n\n447\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.060\nSometimes the best way to get\nrid of it is destruction.\n\n448\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, is there any other ways\nthat we might be leaking data out of our\n\n449\n00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.200\norganization?\n\n450\n00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.310\n&gt;&gt; You'd be surprised, right?\n\n451\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.080\nSo you mentioned in the last episode,\nUSB keys.\n\n452\n00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.390\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; Right, USB keys are really common.\n\n453\n00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.598\nAnd if I have a big file, and\nI wanna give it to you I can't email,\n\n454\n00:20:37.598 --> 00:20:39.330\nit's too big, right?\n\n455\n00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.780\nSo I might be able to use some\nfile service out there, but\n\n456\n00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.840\nwhy don't I just copy it to a USB key and\ngive it to you by hand?\n\n457\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.480\nIt's fast, it's easy,\nthese things are cheap.\n\n458\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.390\nThey give them away at\nconventions like crazy.\n\n459\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.510\nYou walk around a convention and\n\n460\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.820\nthe people are just sticking\nthem in your pockets.\n\n461\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.992\n&gt;&gt; This is Don's personal\ncollection [LAUGH].\n\n462\n00:20:53.992 --> 00:20:56.615\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Actually, this was from\na Wikimedia Commons, or whatever.\n\n463\n00:20:56.615 --> 00:20:58.567\n&gt;&gt; Found all of these in the parking lot,\nright?\n\n464\n00:20:58.567 --> 00:21:02.225\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's an attack factor\n\n465\n00:21:02.225 --> 00:21:05.750\nthere where people can basically-\n&gt;&gt; Load malware, yeah.\n\n466\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.560\n&gt;&gt; Make you think you found a USB key,\nbut it's got malicious software on there.\n\n467\n00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.390\nBut we can put our own legitimate data\non there and we give it to somebody.\n\n468\n00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:12.640\nWell now that's our data.\n\n469\n00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.080\nIt's like a paper cup in it\nwe've just let leave our hands.\n\n470\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.980\nAnd very few people encrypt their usb\nkeys cuz it makes difficult to read\n\n471\n00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.999\nthe data off from another computer.\n\n472\n00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:25.633\nSo here's these unencrypted data,\nhow do I protect these?\n\n473\n00:21:25.633 --> 00:21:28.420\nWell, they can be erased.\n\n474\n00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:33.340\nThey typically use flash media,\nwhich is mush easier to overwrite and\n\n475\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.940\nmake non-recoverable.\n\n476\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.210\nBut they can also be destroyed,\njust like a hard drive.\n\n477\n00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.400\nIf we don't need the USB key anymore,\n\n478\n00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.960\ndon't say I'll just give it to my\nkid to use for their homework.\n\n479\n00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.920\nWell if it had corporate data on there,\nthat data could be recovered.\n\n480\n00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.340\nSo it needs to be cleaned or\nit needs to be destroyed.\n\n481\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.560\nThese things are cheap.\n\n482\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.695\nIt's easy to enough to get new ones and\nnot jeopardize your company's data and\n\n483\n00:21:51.695 --> 00:21:52.610\nhave that destroyed.\n\n484\n00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.250\nBut there's other devices,\nreally any device that can store data and\n\n485\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.260\na great example of that might be printers.\n\n486\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.994\nA lot of printers these days\nactually have extra memory in them.\n\n487\n00:22:04.994 --> 00:22:07.600\nThey'll have RAM,\nprinters always have RAM to work with.\n\n488\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.170\nBut a lot of them have hard drives or\nflash memory.\n\n489\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.059\nSo when you send the print\njob to the printer,\n\n490\n00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:15.590\nthe print job actually gets stored on the\ndisk and then it prints out on the paper.\n\n491\n00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Is this how I can go back and\ngo man, I need to reprint this.\n\n492\n00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.530\nAnd instead of actually sending\nthe print job again, I just walk over to\n\n493\n00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:27.040\nthe printer and go through the memory,\nand there's my print job, and hit print?\n\n494\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.020\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, and\nit makes your life easier, doesn't it?\n\n495\n00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does, I love that feature.\n\n496\n00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.140\n&gt;&gt; And if you wanna print 50 copies of\nsomething, it just holds it once, and\n\n497\n00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.745\nthen it makes those 50 copies.\n\n498\n00:22:34.745 --> 00:22:38.855\nBut for an attacker,\nagain you can go dumpster diving.\n\n499\n00:22:38.855 --> 00:22:41.245\nTake a look at the company dumpster and\nfind a printer.\n\n500\n00:22:41.245 --> 00:22:43.415\nAnd you can take that printer home and\nopen it up and\n\n501\n00:22:43.415 --> 00:22:44.975\nfind the flash memory inside of it.\n\n502\n00:22:44.975 --> 00:22:49.135\nAnd if you read that flash memory you can\nfind the last documents that were printed,\n\n503\n00:22:49.135 --> 00:22:50.115\nthey're right there.\n\n504\n00:22:50.115 --> 00:22:55.040\nSo when w get rid of a printer,\nthose need to be cleaned just like PCs,\n\n505\n00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.740\njust like mobile phones,\njust like laptops.\n\n506\n00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.930\nAnything that has storage in\nit can retain that storage.\n\n507\n00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.450\nAnd an attacker will take the time\nto recover that information.\n\n508\n00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.890\nSo, when we talk about data disposal,\nwe're talking about paper stuff,\n\n509\n00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.500\nphysical stuff, that's important, but\nwe're talking about digital as well.\n\n510\n00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.020\nAnd your IT department will\ntypically supervise both.\n\n511\n00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.730\nYou might have an operational\nsecurity department that handles just\n\n512\n00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:20.970\nthe paper side.\n\n513\n00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.430\nBut that's getting to be less and\nless common.\n\n514\n00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.350\nNormally the IT department is running\nboth areas, the digital side and\n\n515\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.210\nthe paper side.\n\n516\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.070\nSo they'll have a policy, they'll\nhave a set of requirements for you.\n\n517\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.650\nYou need to make sure you follow those.\n\n518\n00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.975\nBut even in your personal life,\neven at home,\n\n519\n00:23:32.975 --> 00:23:37.400\nyou need to be thinking about your\nown computer, how that data is used.\n\n520\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.020\nAnd when you get rid of that laptop,\nwhen you give it to a friend,\n\n521\n00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.110\nwhen you sell it on eBay,\nthat next person or\n\n522\n00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.830\nmaybe the next person after them\ncould potentially scan that machine,\n\n523\n00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:52.310\ndig through the disk, find information and\nnow your private data got out.\n\n524\n00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.180\nAnd you don't even know how because\nyou formatted the computer,\n\n525\n00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.010\nyou saw the operating system, it's fine.\n\n526\n00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.360\nYou'd be surprised how sticky data can be.\n\n527\n00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.420\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely true and\nDon has brought to light the fact that,\n\n528\n00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.520\njust because we've erased data doesn't\nmean that it might actually be gone.\n\n529\n00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.120\nIt could still be lingering around there.\n\n530\n00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.810\nDon, it's been a fascinating look at data\ndisposal, the techniques and tips that we\n\n531\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:18.520\ncan use to make sure the data,\nwhen we are done with it, is truly done.\n\n532\n00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.110\nAny parting words for\nour audience before we call this a show?\n\n533\n00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.531\n&gt;&gt; Don't let this deter you from\ngiving computers to other people.\n\n534\n00:24:25.531 --> 00:24:27.958\nIt's always a nice thing if\npeople do benefit from that.\n\n535\n00:24:27.958 --> 00:24:30.670\nBut again, be sensitive to the data.\n\n536\n00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.850\nIf you don't know how to erase\nthe data then you can take it\n\n537\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.790\nto your IT department,\nto the local computer companies.\n\n538\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.020\nA lot of them can help\nyou with erasing it.\n\n539\n00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.930\nPrograms like DBAN like I showed earlier,\nthey're actually pretty hard to use.\n\n540\n00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:48.540\nThey're not very user friendly so don't be\nashamed to go out there and ask for help.\n\n541\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.260\nIt might cost you a few bucks to do it but\n\n542\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.040\nit is worth it cuz you know\nthat your data is safe.\n\n543\n00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.110\nBut USB keys, definitely pay attention\nto those cuz they're easy to lose, and\n\n544\n00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.890\nif your datas on there,\nnow somebody else has that data.\n\n545\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.130\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n546\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.210\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don, thanks so\nmuch for dropping by, and\n\n547\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.730\ntalking data disposal with us.\n\n548\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.700\nWe do thank our audience out there for\nwatching as well.\n\n549\n00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.890\nBut it is that time for\nus to call it a day.\n\n550\n00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:09.770\nThanks for watching everyone.\n\n551\n00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.650\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n552\n00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:13.310\n&gt;&gt;

another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.300\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.400\nin today's episode we're back with more in\nour End User's Security Awareness series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.348\nJoining us yet again in the studio,\nlending his expertise to us,\n\n9\n00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:26.804\nour good friend Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:29.360\nDon, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.890\n&gt;&gt; It is going great Daniel, ready to\njump into end user security awareness and\n\n12\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.320\ncover a really important topic,\nwhich is understanding\n\n13\n00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.820\nwhen you're on a safe network, and\nunderstanding when you're on a not so\n\n14\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.760\nsafe network, really a dangerous network\n&gt;&gt; As we use computers more and\n\n15\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.180\nmore for our daily activities,\nand as they become more mobile,\n\n16\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.480\nas we travel more, we get exposed to\nmore networks than most people realize.\n\n17\n00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.509\nIn the olden days,\nyou had one network, a work network.\n\n18\n00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:56.370\nAnd it's not like that anymore.\n\n19\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.210\nNow we connect to any number of\nnetworks throughout our given day.\n\n20\n00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.770\nSo we as end users need to be able to\nrecognize when we're on a safe and\n\n21\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.820\ntrusted network.\n\n22\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.430\nVersus one that is not safe and\ntrusted, and\n\n23\n00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.500\nwhat we should be doing to help make our\ndata as safe and secure as possible.\n\n24\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.170\nEven when we're on those\nun-trusted networks.\n\n25\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.740\nSo that's what we're gonna take a look at,\nright here in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.310\n&gt;&gt; All right, Donald.\n\n27\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.670\nI always like to start at the beginning,\ncuz that makes logical sense to me,\n\n28\n00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.340\nwhat would you say\nconstitutes a safe network?\n\n29\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, so a safe network\nis a network that you trust.\n\n30\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.770\nIt all comes down to that word, trust.\n\n31\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.280\n&gt;&gt; When I'm at work, I have an IT\ndepartment that brings the network up,\n\n32\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.280\nthat they get me connected\nto that network.\n\n33\n00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.180\nI trust that network, I trust the IT\ndepartment, I know who they are, right?\n\n34\n00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.382\nI know where they work.\n\n35\n00:01:37.382 --> 00:01:38.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n36\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.570\n&gt;&gt; So we can trust that network.\n\n37\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.660\nWhen I'm at home, my home network,\nI set it up, right?\n\n38\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.780\nSo I got a connection from the cable\ncompany and popped in a router and\n\n39\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380\nI trust that network,\nI'm the one who built it.\n\n40\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.610\n&gt;&gt; That is a trusted, safe network.\n\n41\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.780\nI know who made it,\nI know who controls it.\n\n42\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.510\nI know the other people\nthat are on the network.\n\n43\n00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.420\nThere's no strangers on those networks.\n\n44\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.310\nI know that I can trust them.\n\n45\n00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.030\nAnd so, in a trusted network, It's okay to\nlet your guard down a little bit, right?\n\n46\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.280\nNot a ton because you can still\nhave compromises there, but\n\n47\n00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.104\nyou're in a safe place, right?\n\n48\n00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:12.237\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n49\n00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:13.860\n&gt;&gt; Just like when you're at home and\nyou've got the doors locked, right?\n\n50\n00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.200\nSo, that's what I mean when\nI talk about a safe network.\n\n51\n00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.960\nThe problem is,\nthe network that you're on might be safe.\n\n52\n00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.209\nBut as you pass from one\nsafe place to another,\n\n53\n00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.335\nyou might actually be crossing\nthrough several unsafe places.\n\n54\n00:02:27.335 --> 00:02:30.075\n&gt;&gt; Because the internet is\ntechnically just a bunch of networks\n\n55\n00:02:30.075 --> 00:02:32.020\nthat are connected to each other, right?\n\n56\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.910\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and there's a ton of\nnetworks that you don't know about.\n\n57\n00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.920\nLet me give you an example,\n\n58\n00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.390\nso let's say on my computer that I\nwant to go to Adobe's website right?\n\n59\n00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.310\nAdobe they make graphic\nsoftware like Adobe Photoshop,\n\n60\n00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.900\nthey're a trusted company,\nthey've been around a long time.\n\n61\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.870\nWe know Adobe, I trust their website.\n\n62\n00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.240\nI trust my computer and\nI trust my network as well.\n\n63\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.840\nSo when I go in and I do something\nlike I fire up a web browser, and\n\n64\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.970\nI go to www.adobe.com, right?\n\n65\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.100\nI trust my computer.\n\n66\n00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.070\nI trust my network.\n\n67\n00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.960\nI go to Adobe.\n\n68\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.830\nI get their server and their web page.\n\n69\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.110\nAnd I trust that, too.\n\n70\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.681\nI'm very trusting today.\n\n71\n00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:12.986\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But what I don't see-\n\n72\n00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:13.615\n&gt;&gt; Feeling the love, Don.\n\n73\n00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:17.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] in fact, I don't see\nall the stuff that happened in between.\n\n74\n00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.170\nSo if I go, let me just kinda drop\ndown here to a command prompt.\n\n75\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.990\nNow in order to get there,\nI didn't just go straight there.\n\n76\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.080\nDaniel mentioned the internet is made\nup of a number of different networks.\n\n77\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.140\nIf I do what's called a traceroute, I can\nsee the path that I took to get there.\n\n78\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.520\nAnd if I follow that to Adobe.com,\nI'm gonna see that I actually\n\n79\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.910\npassed through a number of\ndifferent systems on my way there.\n\n80\n00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.135\nAnd as we look at the data I can see my\nnetwork, right here at the very beginning\n\n81\n00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:49.770\nis these stars, we have a firewall\nhere that's blocking that detection.\n\n82\n00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.518\nAnd then,\nI see my internet service provider,\n\n83\n00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:53.543\nwe get our internet service\nfrom a company called GRU.\n\n84\n00:03:53.543 --> 00:03:54.575\nAnd so there's GRU.\n\n85\n00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:56.260\nI know GRU.\n\n86\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.690\nTheir offices are not far from here, and\nwe've been their customer for a long time,\n\n87\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.650\nI trust GRU.\n\n88\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.060\nBut not long after passing through GRU,\nwe jumped to ntt.net.\n\n89\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.942\nNow, NTT is one of the Internet\nbackbone providers.\n\n90\n00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:16.080\nThey're a big organization, but if I don't\nknow that, then who are these people?\n\n91\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.419\nAnd even now that I know it, right,\nI know NTT is a backbone provider,\n\n92\n00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.085\nI couldn't name a single employee at NTT.\n\n93\n00:04:23.085 --> 00:04:24.970\nI don't know any.\n\n94\n00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.620\nI don't know where their offices are.\n\n95\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.490\nI know they're a big company, but\nI don't really know anything about them.\n\n96\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.770\nThey could have employees that are\nwatching the network that are seeing this\n\n97\n00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.020\ntraffic, they could be intercepting\nthat data, and that's not so\n\n98\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.800\ntrusted anymore, right?\n\n99\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.860\nSo while my network at the very\nbeginning here was trusted, and\n\n100\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.120\nat the very end of this journey,\n\n101\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.680\nwhen I get down here, to where Adobe's\nwebsite is stored, that might be trusted.\n\n102\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.260\nBut all this stuff in between,\nI don't know that anymore.\n\n103\n00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.920\nThat's not what I can call\na safe network anymore.\n\n104\n00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.160\nThe internet is not a safe place.\n\n105\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.240\nThe internet is a very dangerous place.\n\n106\n00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.710\nBut we do have safe pockets,\nsafe areas like our homes and\n\n107\n00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.290\nlike our office, that's what I mean when\nI talk about a safe or a trusted network.\n\n108\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.862\n&gt;&gt; Well Don like a friend who never\npays you back, by the way you owe me $5.\n\n109\n00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:11.783\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n110\n00:05:11.783 --> 00:05:13.936\n&gt;&gt; What could break that trust inside\n\n111\n00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:15.230\nof those networks?\n\n112\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.260\n&gt;&gt; Well there's a number of things,\nit could be a malicious employee, right?\n\n113\n00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.830\nAn employee on any one of those networks\nin between me and the destination, or\n\n114\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.500\neven a malicious employee on\nmy trusted network, right?\n\n115\n00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.670\nAt work, you have somebody who is\na disgruntled employee, they start to\n\n116\n00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.560\nhate the company, and they just start\nlooking for ways to get at data, right?\n\n117\n00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.620\nThat could be the source of an attack, and\n\n118\n00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.890\nall of a sudden your trusted network\nis no longer trusted anymore, right?\n\n119\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.420\nIt could be a compromised network,\nwhere it's not an internal employee but\n\n120\n00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.660\na hacker from the outside, that's\nmanaged to get into that network and\n\n121\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.110\ncompromise that data.\n\n122\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.330\nThat happens all too often.\n\n123\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.780\nThe attackers, when they break in,\nif they just go into surveillance mode,\n\n124\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.700\nthey start capturing data,\nrecording information.\n\n125\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.240\nWe don't necessarily see that they're\ndoing anything because they're not\n\n126\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.160\nactually changing anything.\n\n127\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.670\nSo we might not even know they're there.\n\n128\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.614\nBut meanwhile, they're intercepting our\ndata, trying to grab personal details and\n\n129\n00:06:05.614 --> 00:06:07.882\nthen now you got a broken trust in,\nbetween you and\n\n130\n00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:10.200\nwhoever it is that you're talking to.\n\n131\n00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.875\nSo those are some examples.\n\n132\n00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:14.737\nThere's also networks that are run\nby bad actors which would be\n\n133\n00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:16.304\nlike state governments, right?\n\n134\n00:06:16.304 --> 00:06:19.730\nA lot of governments these days\nare getting involved in cyber warfare.\n\n135\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.930\nAnd then networks that we cross might\nlook like networks that we know, but\n\n136\n00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.120\nactually be impersonated by various\ngovernments that are collecting data.\n\n137\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.010\nAnd I know,\nit sounds like spy thriller novel.\n\n138\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.555\n&gt;&gt; It's cloak and dagger stuff, man.\n\n139\n00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:32.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sadly, it's real.\n\n140\n00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.020\nIt happens.\n\n141\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.737\nIt's something that's going on right now.\n\n142\n00:06:34.737 --> 00:06:39.110\nAnd this isn't me saying it's other\ncountries doing it, it's our own country.\n\n143\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.360\nThe United States does\nthis on a regular basis.\n\n144\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.040\nSo in those cases, we can't really\neven trust those networks anymore.\n\n145\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.820\n&gt;&gt; I believe they call\nthat a Tu quoque argument.\n\n146\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.452\nWell, he's doing it, so I get to do it.\n\n147\n00:06:49.452 --> 00:06:51.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's not how this works.\n\n148\n00:06:51.415 --> 00:06:52.210\n[LAUGH] Well, Don,\n\n149\n00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.810\nhave you ever encountered these\ntypes of networks out in the wild?\n\n150\n00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.760\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.\n\n151\n00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.380\nAnd there's well-documented\ncases of this stuff.\n\n152\n00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.300\nWhen we talk about a network that you\nshould be able to trust that you can't.\n\n153\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.880\nThink about like a hotel, right?\n\n154\n00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.960\nYou go to a hotel, almost every\nhotel has free WiFi these days.\n\n155\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.330\nAll right, great, I'm in my hotel room,\nI paid to be here,\n\n156\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.870\nI trust the hotel, they've got a wireless\nnetwork, certainly I can trust that.\n\n157\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.200\nWell, a lot of hotels don't\nisolate the guests, right?\n\n158\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.420\nSo while, we might trust the hotel,\n\n159\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.690\nthere might be other guests staying at\nthe hotel, that aren't trustworthy.\n\n160\n00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.420\nAnd so now, your laptop or your phone\nthat's on the hotel wireless is being\n\n161\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.760\nattacked by other guests,\nright there inside of the hotel.\n\n162\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.820\nOr it could be any other malicious actor.\n\n163\n00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.450\nLaw enforcement does this quite a bit.\n\n164\n00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.927\nThe NSA, they have what are called\nstingray devices that simulates\n\n165\n00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:40.950\ncell towers.\n\n166\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.690\nAnd so your cellphone thinks that it's\nconnected to a regular cell tower, but\n\n167\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.220\nit's actually connected\nto one of their boxes.\n\n168\n00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.773\nWell, the NSA aren't the only people\nwho have access to that technology.\n\n169\n00:07:47.773 --> 00:07:49.724\nThere's plenty of bad actors,\n\n170\n00:07:49.724 --> 00:07:54.501\nmalicious people that have that same\ntechnology and can intercept that data.\n\n171\n00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:56.870\nAnd it looks like you're on an AT&amp;T tower.\n\n172\n00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.565\nBut, you actually aren't.\n\n173\n00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:02.850\nBut let me tell you about the number\none place where I see this, airports.\n\n174\n00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.260\nEvery time I'm at an airport,\n\n175\n00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.200\nI do a WiFi scan and I look to see\nwhat wireless networks are there.\n\n176\n00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.830\nA lot of airports do have either free or\npaid WiFi access.\n\n177\n00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.130\nBut anybody,\nanybody who just takes a few moments\n\n178\n00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.952\ncan bring a wireless hotspot and\nname it, airport free WiFi.\n\n179\n00:08:18.952 --> 00:08:19.594\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n180\n00:08:19.594 --> 00:08:22.090\n&gt;&gt; And so now,\nnow you fire up your laptop and\n\n181\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.670\nthen you see airport free\nWiFi that must be it, right.\n\n182\n00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.190\nEspecially if it's a connection to\na city you've never been in before,\n\n183\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.750\nyou don't know what the WiFi is called.\n\n184\n00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.380\nHere's airport free WiFi,\nit's open and it's free, sweet.\n\n185\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.150\nI'm gonna get on that and\nplay fantasy football, right.\n\n186\n00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.180\nWell, meanwhile, you're connecting\nto somebody's compromised hotspot.\n\n187\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.320\nAnd they're able to record your data and\neven tamper with the data.\n\n188\n00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.190\nYou try and\ngo to your banking web site and\n\n189\n00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.170\nthey redirect you to a site\nthat just looks like it.\n\n190\n00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.500\nLike what Daniel in an earlier episode.\n\n191\n00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.240\nBy masquerading as another site\nthey can collect your details,\n\n192\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.540\ncollect your information.\n\n193\n00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.730\nThey can do identity theft.\n\n194\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.550\nAnd that's a real problem.\n\n195\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.360\nJust because the network\nis called airport free WiFi\n\n196\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.790\ndoesn't mean the airport set it up.\n\n197\n00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.950\nIt just means somebody could\nbuy a $50 wireless router.\n\n198\n00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.990\nThat's all it means.\n\n199\n00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.510\n&gt;&gt; And type in a name for\na wireless, right?\n\n200\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, cuz there's not a whole\nlot of authentication that goes on there\n\n201\n00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.500\nwith most wireless networks, especially\nthe public ones, where they're free.\n\n202\n00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.010\nYou log in.\nMaybe you don't even log in.\n\n203\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.100\nMaybe you just connect and\nthat's it, right?\n\n204\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.910\nSometimes you connect and you get\na screen that says you got to log in.\n\n205\n00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.070\nBut that can be faked very, very easily.\n\n206\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.210\nIt is a trivial thing to fake these pages,\n\n207\n00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.190\nso we have to really be on our guard when\nwe're in public areas like the airport.\n\n208\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, if it's just so\ndang easy for people to set this kind of\n\n209\n00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.820\nmalfeasance up and trick us,\nhow do we know what's safe and what's not?\n\n210\n00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.350\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, let's use the example\nof a coffee shop, all right, Starbucks.\n\n211\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.365\nI don't know,\nare we allowed to say a brand name?\n\n212\n00:09:40.365 --> 00:09:43.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, we're going to use a-\n\n213\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.025\n&gt;&gt; Lucky Stars.\n\n214\n00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:48.514\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You go to any Starbucks, I'm\ngonna do that, I'm gonna pick on them, and\n\n215\n00:09:48.514 --> 00:09:49.950\nthey've got free WiFi.\n\n216\n00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.740\nIt's a nice service.\n\n217\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.270\nYou go, sip some coffee,\nand get on their free WiFi.\n\n218\n00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.250\nWell when you go there,\nyou expect the WiFi to be there.\n\n219\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.390\nSo I had this expectation of it existing,\nbut\n\n220\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.950\nI have no idea what it's\ngoing to be called.\n\n221\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.480\nSo I just look for a wireless network\nthat's named something like Starbucks.\n\n222\n00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.280\nSo how do I actually know it's them?\n\n223\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.090\nWell, I could ask an employee, I can ask\na barista, or whatever they call them.\n\n224\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And say hey,\n\n225\n00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.700\nwhat's the name of your wireless network?\n\n226\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.260\nAnd they could say well it's actually\ncalled Starbucks Free and now when I look\n\n227\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.880\nand I see five different options, I know,\nit's someone that says Starbucks Free.\n\n228\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.270\nThese other ones are fake.\n\n229\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.250\nThat's one way to go about it.\n\n230\n00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.510\nBut, people can impersonate even that.\n\n231\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.840\nAnd let me just show you an example,\nlike here on my laptop.\n\n232\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.260\nHere, we have a wireless\nnetwork called ITProTV.\n\n233\n00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.210\nAnd so if I look at my little\nwireless network list here,\n\n234\n00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.770\nI can see that ITPRoTV wireless\nnetwork that I'm connected to.\n\n235\n00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:46.420\nBut you can have more than one antenna\nwith the same name, and we have that here.\n\n236\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.150\nWe have like eight antennas\nthat all have that same name.\n\n237\n00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:54.270\nIf I pull up a full list, I'm gonna\npull a wireless monitor here real quick.\n\n238\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.080\nAnd what this is gonna do is it's gonna\nshow me every single wireless network\n\n239\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.330\nin the area.\n\n240\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.500\nAnd when it starts to pull up,\nthese are all the antennas.\n\n241\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.660\nAnd you can see I've got\nITProTV right here at the top.\n\n242\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.760\nThat's the one I'm connected to,\nnice and big.\n\n243\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.510\nBut if we keep looking down,\nthere's another ITProTV.\n\n244\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.590\nAnd if I keep going down beyond that,\n\n245\n00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.660\nthere's another ITProTV down there\nover and over and over again.\n\n246\n00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.580\nYou can have multiple wireless\nnetworks with the same name.\n\n247\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.490\nSo the barista telling me,\nit's called Starbucks Free,\n\n248\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.890\nthat's not enough because now that I\nknow maybe I'm the malicious person.\n\n249\n00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.230\nAnd so I go sit down with my cappuccino\nand I bring up my own travel router.\n\n250\n00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.095\nAnd I create a network called,\nStarbucks Free.\n\n251\n00:11:32.095 --> 00:11:35.500\n[LAUGH] Now some people connect to me,\nsome people connect to the real one, but\n\n252\n00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.000\nnow I'm intercepting that data.\n\n253\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.180\nSo the real answer to this problem\nis not just trusting a name,\n\n254\n00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.400\nbut actually authenticating.\n\n255\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.540\nHaving a user name and password to\nconnect to the wireless network, or\n\n256\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.050\nto have a certificate to connect\nto that wireless network.\n\n257\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.490\nBut the problem with doing authentication\nlike that is it's difficult.\n\n258\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.430\nIt's difficult to set up, so\nIT departments don't like to do it.\n\n259\n00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.010\nIt's difficult for the end user.\n\n260\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.730\nWhen I'm in Starbucks,\nI'm only going to be there 15 minutes.\n\n261\n00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.400\nI don't want to go wait in line for\n\n262\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.730\na barista to issue me a security\ncertificate to get my laptop on.\n\n263\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.670\nAnd if I want my laptop and my phone,\nnow I need to get two certificates.\n\n264\n00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.000\nIt's a hassle.\n\n265\n00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.840\nAnd so, while that's the actual\nsolution to the problem,\n\n266\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.440\nnot many organizations do it.\n\n267\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.190\nYour workplace might do it.\n\n268\n00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.950\nSo at your office,\n\n269\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.730\nyour IT department might be\nactively issuing you certificates.\n\n270\n00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.672\nAnd if they are,\nthey're doing a great job.\n\n271\n00:12:27.672 --> 00:12:30.060\nRight, cuz that is the way\nto solve this problem.\n\n272\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.840\nIf you connect to a network that\nhas the same name, but doesn't\n\n273\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.520\nhonor your certificate, it's not the real\nthing then you know that it's bad.\n\n274\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.930\nYour computer will know that it's bad.\n\n275\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.460\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n276\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.990\nBut if you're not using certificates, then\nyou don't have a great way of verifying\n\n277\n00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.270\nthe network you're on is\nactually the real network.\n\n278\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.120\nAnd so you can very easily fall\ninto these kinda pits where\n\n279\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.720\nyou're not able to trust what\nyou're actually connecting with.\n\n280\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.380\nSo that's one problem.\n\n281\n00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.940\nAnother thing is location, right?\n\n282\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.460\nDepending on where you're at,\n\n283\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.440\nif I'm at the office, I expect to see\na wireless network with a certain name.\n\n284\n00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.808\nBut if I go traveling and\nI'm at the airport and\n\n285\n00:13:10.808 --> 00:13:14.272\nsomebody happens to brought up\na network with that same name there,\n\n286\n00:13:14.272 --> 00:13:17.100\nmy laptop however might\nautomatically connect to it.\n\n287\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.150\nAnd then again that's creates\na bit of a challenge too.\n\n288\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.730\nSo in those scenarios, I've gotta be\nvery proactive about paying attention to\n\n289\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.700\nthe wireless network and being able\nto figure out if we can trust it.\n\n290\n00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.430\nIf I see The ITProTV wireless\nnetwork at the airport,\n\n291\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.870\nI know not to trust that,\nthat's not the real one.\n\n292\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.020\nThe real one is here in my building so\n\n293\n00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.580\nI can kinda apply a little\nbit of logic to it.\n\n294\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.930\nBut if it were a certificate based network\nthen I wouldn't have that problem.\n\n295\n00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.100\nI would know immediately my laptop\nknow not to connect to that network.\n\n296\n00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Well Don you've really\npainted a picture of doom and\n\n297\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.190\ngloom with my tin foil hats\nare being produced as we speak.\n\n298\n00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.720\nWhat do we do if this is\nthe landscape we're dealing with?\n\n299\n00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.744\n&gt;&gt; All right, well option number one,\ndon't use wireless networks, all right?\n\n300\n00:14:01.744 --> 00:14:03.160\nDon't use public networks, right?\n\n301\n00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.540\nSo when you're at Starbucks,\ndon't use their network.\n\n302\n00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.930\nWhen you're at the airport,\ndon't use their network.\n\n303\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.080\nWhen you're at your office,\nuse your network.\n\n304\n00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.590\nWhen you're at home, use your network.\n\n305\n00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:17.480\nNow, that's an easy solution, but\nit's not a realistic solution.\n\n306\n00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.301\n&gt;&gt; Very practical.\n\n307\n00:14:18.301 --> 00:14:20.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We travel for ITProTV quite a bit and\n\n308\n00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.830\nyou go to a convention.\n\n309\n00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.960\nAnd you might be gone for days.\n\n310\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.347\nWhat are you supposed to not\ncheck your email the whole time?\n\n311\n00:14:25.347 --> 00:14:26.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n312\n00:14:26.043 --> 00:14:28.438\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Actually it'd be kind of nice,\n\n313\n00:14:28.438 --> 00:14:29.420\nnow that I think about it.\n\n314\n00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.820\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like where you're\n\n315\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.710\ngoing with this, Pezet.\n\n316\n00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.170\n&gt;&gt; But the reality is, when we travel,\nwe need access to those networks.\n\n317\n00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.000\nAnd when we're at a coffee shop or\nsomewhere,\n\n318\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.400\nit would be nice to be able to use it.\n\n319\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.220\nAnd just saying I'm not gonna use it,\nthat's not really a great option there.\n\n320\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.100\nSo option number two,\nuse the cellular networks.\n\n321\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.930\nThe cellular networks are much\nmore difficult to fake.\n\n322\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.865\nAnybody with a $50 router and five minutes\nof Google experience can fake a WiFi\n\n323\n00:14:56.865 --> 00:15:00.920\nnetwork for\nregular wireless Internet, all right.\n\n324\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.180\nBut to fake a cellular network\nrequires special equipment.\n\n325\n00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.040\nThose stingray devices\nthat I mentioned earlier,\n\n326\n00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.780\nthey cost thousands upon thousands\nof dollars, very expensive.\n\n327\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.960\nAnd if you order the parts for them you're\nimmediately put upon an NSA watch list so\n\n328\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.980\nthey keep an eye on that stuff.\n\n329\n00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.940\nThe FCC regulates a lot of that so\nit is a difficult thing to do.\n\n330\n00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.940\nIt's not impossible.\n\n331\n00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.530\nThat's why we can't completely\ntrust the cellular networks.\n\n332\n00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:29.490\nBut it is much more trustworthy than it\nis being on just a regular WiFi network.\n\n333\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.560\nSo if you're on your cell phone and\n\n334\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.480\nyou're at Starbucks, you don't\nhave to connect to their wireless.\n\n335\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.200\nYou could just stay on\nyour cellular data plan.\n\n336\n00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.750\nAnd yeah, your data plan costs some money.\n\n337\n00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.600\nBut you get security out of that.\n\n338\n00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.030\nSo there is an added benefit.\n\n339\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.910\n&gt;&gt; It's like paying for insurance, right?\n\n340\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:45.616\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n341\n00:15:45.616 --> 00:15:48.265\n&gt;&gt; So, you know that you're not gonna be\ncompromised because it is your network.\n\n342\n00:15:48.265 --> 00:15:52.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and usually like if I'm at an\nairport I will tether my laptop to my cell\n\n343\n00:15:52.365 --> 00:15:55.502\nphone, so that my laptop will\nstart to use my cell phone for\n\n344\n00:15:55.502 --> 00:15:58.920\nInternet access, and\nit's going over the cellular network.\n\n345\n00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.250\nI never connect to airport Wi-Fi,\nwell mostly because it's usually slow.\n\n346\n00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.080\nBut also, you just can't trust it, right?\n\n347\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.110\nSo that's a second option.\n\n348\n00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.169\nBut the third option, the one that I want\nyou all to be aware of, the one we're\n\n349\n00:16:11.169 --> 00:16:15.564\ngonna talk about the rest of this episode,\nis a virtual private network, or a VPN.\n\n350\n00:16:15.564 --> 00:16:19.046\nA VPN let's you take an untrusted network,\nand\n\n351\n00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:23.495\nbasically convert it into\nsomething that we trust, right?\n\n352\n00:16:23.495 --> 00:16:26.020\nTo make it where we can rely upon it.\n\n353\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.970\nAnd, so now, I can connect to Starbucks\nknowing full well that I have no\n\n354\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.490\nidea who set up that network,\nwhether it's real or not,\n\n355\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.840\nwhether an attacker is\nrecording all my stuff.\n\n356\n00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.340\nI can go in there with that all in mind.\n\n357\n00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.756\nThen I can build up a tunnel and\nknow my data is safe, right?\n\n358\n00:16:41.756 --> 00:16:43.360\nSo let me explain how that works, right?\n\n359\n00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.817\nI've got a fancy diagram here,\nnow I am not an amazing artist,\n\n360\n00:16:46.817 --> 00:16:48.656\nthis is the best I could do [LAUGH].\n\n361\n00:16:48.656 --> 00:16:49.958\n&gt;&gt; You're no Picasso [LAUGH].\n\n362\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Although it does\nlook a little abstract.\n\n363\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.662\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n364\n00:16:53.662 --> 00:16:55.420\n&gt;&gt; Let's say I'm at home, right?\n\n365\n00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.700\nAnd I'm on my laptop, and I wanna\nconnect to a computer at work, right?\n\n366\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.400\nI trust my home, and I trust my work,\nbut in between is the Internet.\n\n367\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.650\n&gt;&gt; The old, wild west, right?\n\n368\n00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.340\n&gt;&gt; And so, maybe that's ISPs or backbone\nproviders, maybe it's Starbucks or\n\n369\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.340\nMcDonald's, maybe it's the airport,\nwhoever it is that I'm connecting through.\n\n370\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.865\nAll those other networks,\nremember when I ran the trace route,\n\n371\n00:17:14.865 --> 00:17:16.468\nall those other routers that showed up.\n\n372\n00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:19.300\nAll of that is the Internet.\n\n373\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.710\nAnd my data is gonna\ncross over that Internet.\n\n374\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.597\nSo even though I'm on a trusted network,\nand I'm going to a trusted network,\n\n375\n00:17:25.597 --> 00:17:27.670\nall of the in between stuff is untrusted.\n\n376\n00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.530\nSo anybody in between can be\ngathering my data and compromising.\n\n377\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:36.280\nSo the way a VPN tunnel works,\nis we take all of our data and\n\n378\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.090\ninstead of just throwing it out there on\nthe Internet where it can be messed with,\n\n379\n00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.110\nwe encapsulate it, all right?\n\n380\n00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.820\nAnd encapsulate just means we wrap it up,\nokay?\n\n381\n00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.841\nAnd the example here that I give is,\nand it's kinda gross, but\n\n382\n00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:49.219\nyou'll remember this one.\n\n383\n00:17:49.219 --> 00:17:51.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it's gross, candy bars.\n\n384\n00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Everybody loves candy bars.\n\n385\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Who doesn't?\n\n386\n00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.070\n&gt;&gt; You go to the grocery store, you're\nstanding there at the cash register, and\n\n387\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.778\nthey've got the, what's it called,\nthe last minute, high pressure sales?\n\n388\n00:18:00.778 --> 00:18:01.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the-\n&gt;&gt; Impulse buy.\n\n389\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.090\n&gt;&gt; Impulse buy, yeah.\n\n390\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.480\n&gt;&gt; They've got the impulse buy thing set\nup right there with all the candy bars.\n\n391\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.620\nAnd, I might look at it and go, [SOUND],\nTwix bar, I could really go for a Twix.\n\n392\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.063\nWe were doing all sorts of product\nplacement in this episode.\n\n393\n00:18:11.063 --> 00:18:11.908\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know [LAUGH].\n\n394\n00:18:11.908 --> 00:18:17.051\n[LAUGH] So I grab that Twix bar, and\nI buy it, get in the car, I unwrap it, and\n\n395\n00:18:17.051 --> 00:18:22.330\nthere is a clean, pristine Twix bar\njust like it came out of the factory.\n\n396\n00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.270\nBecause at the factory, they wrapped\nit up in a nice little foil wrapper.\n\n397\n00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.525\nNow, here's the gross part.\n\n398\n00:18:26.525 --> 00:18:28.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Imagine for\n\n399\n00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.440\na minute they didn't wrap it up.\n\n400\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that probably wouldn't\nbe very appetizing [LAUGH].\n\n401\n00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Imagine they\nmade the candy bar at\n\n402\n00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.232\nthe factory-\n&gt;&gt; And they just shipped it?\n\n403\n00:18:37.232 --> 00:18:39.618\n&gt;&gt; And they just shipped it\nout with no wrapper, right?\n\n404\n00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It goes in a truck,\n\n405\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.780\nit gets shipped across the country,\n\n406\n00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.240\nit's gets to the store, the employees have\nto pick it up, they stick it on a shelf.\n\n407\n00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.290\nEvery third kid in the cash register\naisle is picking it up saying\n\n408\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:49.970\nmommy, I want this.\n\n409\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:50.570\nNo, put it back.\n\n410\n00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.780\nAnd they put it back.\n\n411\n00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.450\nAnd now you walk up.\n\n412\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.800\nAre you gonna but that candy bar?\n\n413\n00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.490\nAbsolutely not.\n\n414\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.306\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna sue that store for\neverything it owns [LAUGH].\n\n415\n00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:01.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] At a minimum it's gonna\nhave shelf dust on it, right?\n\n416\n00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:02.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n417\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.086\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you don't want that.\n\n418\n00:19:03.086 --> 00:19:04.730\n&gt;&gt; That's the best case scenario.\n\n419\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.610\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's how our data is on the Internet.\n\n420\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.512\nYour data is like a dirty Twix bar.\n\n421\n00:19:08.512 --> 00:19:13.264\n[LAUGH] So we want to wrap it up and-\n&gt;&gt; Keep it safe.\n\n422\n00:19:13.264 --> 00:19:14.190\n&gt;&gt; And keep it safe.\n\n423\n00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.300\nAnd that's exactly what a VPN tunnel does.\n\n424\n00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.259\nSo if we take my diagram here, and we\nmodify it a little bit like this, right?\n\n425\n00:19:21.259 --> 00:19:23.240\nWe create a tunnel.\n\n426\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.104\nAnd the tunnel says, here's my data, and\nI'm gonna wrap it up in this green tunnel.\n\n427\n00:19:28.104 --> 00:19:30.480\nAnd the green tunnel is encryption.\n\n428\n00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.970\nWe encrypt our data, and\nthe data becomes what's called ciphertext.\n\n429\n00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.400\nCiphertext is meaningless jumbles\nof letters and numbers that,\n\n430\n00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.060\nunless you have the security key,\ndon't mean anything to you.\n\n431\n00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.440\nAnd it crosses the Internet\nin this tunnel,\n\n432\n00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.240\nall the way over to\nthe other trusted network.\n\n433\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.670\nAnd when the data exits the tunnel,\nthey have the key on the other side.\n\n434\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.406\nThey can unravel the mystery of what\nthat data is and it makes sense.\n\n435\n00:19:57.406 --> 00:20:00.978\nBut anybody in between,\nanybody out here in the Internet,\n\n436\n00:20:00.978 --> 00:20:04.416\nif they see that traffic,\nthey just see encrypted data.\n\n437\n00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:07.600\nAnd if they try and mess with it,\nit breaks the data instantly.\n\n438\n00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.120\nSo now the data's no good,\nand it doesn't work.\n\n439\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.100\nSo at a maximum, the damage they could do\nto me, is just stop me from communicating.\n\n440\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.700\nThey couldn't read my data, they couldn't\ntamper with the data or change it,\n\n441\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.487\nthey couldn't steal my credentials.\n\n442\n00:20:20.487 --> 00:20:22.120\nThey could just prevent me from talking.\n\n443\n00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.890\nAnd believe me,\n\n444\n00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:27.350\nnot talking is way better than having\nyour data get compromised, right?\n\n445\n00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.818\nAnybody whose had their data leaked would\nknow that, that is absolutely the truth.\n\n446\n00:20:30.818 --> 00:20:33.450\nI would much rather just not\nbe able to send that data.\n\n447\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.960\nSo, that's what a VPN tunnel does.\n\n448\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.810\nNow, the way I've described\nit here is really simplified.\n\n449\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.968\nAnd from a technical perspective, it's\nactually a pretty amazing technical feat\n\n450\n00:20:42.968 --> 00:20:45.700\nthat goes on behind the scenes\nto get this to work.\n\n451\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.600\nYour IT department will be\nthe ones who set this up.\n\n452\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.500\nAnd so once it's configured for\n\n453\n00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.800\nyou, it's usually just a matter\nof flipping the switch.\n\n454\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.190\nThat in your operating system,\nif you are in Mac or Windows or\n\n455\n00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.210\nLinux, you'll usually have a graphical\nuser interface element, a button.\n\n456\n00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.990\nAnd your IT department can\nshow you how this works.\n\n457\n00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:07.960\nThat you click and run it, and it'll start\nthe VPN, it'll build that connection up.\n\n458\n00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.190\nAnd now, you're going out and\ncommunicating to that secure tunnel,\n\n459\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.080\nall right?\n\n460\n00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.450\nSo let me do a quick demonstration\nof how that works here on my system.\n\n461\n00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:21.146\nSo a few moments ago,\nI ran a trace route, and\n\n462\n00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:25.855\nthat trace route was to Adobe.com, right?\n\n463\n00:21:25.855 --> 00:21:31.553\nAnd so whoops, I know I spelled it wrong,\nI can't spell .com, there we go.\n\n464\n00:21:31.553 --> 00:21:34.072\n[SOUND] Faster trip this time,\ninteresting.\n\n465\n00:21:34.072 --> 00:21:37.030\nSometimes you go different routes\nacross the Internet to get places,\n\n466\n00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.593\nthis one was apparently a fast trip.\n\n467\n00:21:38.593 --> 00:21:43.460\nBut if you look, you can see\nwhere I went to my ISP, GRU.net.\n\n468\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.212\nGRU then sent me to some random server.\n\n469\n00:21:46.212 --> 00:21:49.600\nI have no idea what it is, it has no name,\nbefore finally sending me to Akamai.\n\n470\n00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.400\nAkamai is the company that\nactually hosts Adobe's webpage,\n\n471\n00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.580\nI just went through four servers.\n\n472\n00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.082\nSo that's an insanely short trip.\n\n473\n00:21:55.082 --> 00:21:56.420\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You don't normally have a trip\n\n474\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.790\nthat short, normally it's a lot longer.\n\n475\n00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:03.250\nOn the Internet, most trips will\nusually take you either 11 to 14 hops,\n\n476\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.470\nit can be quite a few to get to\nwherever it is you're going.\n\n477\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.480\nWell, even Microsoft was only 6 hops.\n\n478\n00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.000\nSo here looking at my trip to Microsoft,\nI went through GRU.\n\n479\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.786\n&gt;&gt; Google\n&gt;&gt; Sorry,\n\n480\n00:22:12.786 --> 00:22:14.380\nGoogle\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n481\n00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.300\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking Microsoft and\n\n482\n00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.190\nI'm going to Google, they're like\nthe same company am I right [LAUGH]?\n\n483\n00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.130\nSo I went to google here and\nI went through a couple of ones.\n\n484\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.106\nI went through my ISP, and then a couple\nof random routers, again, I don't know\n\n485\n00:22:24.106 --> 00:22:28.180\nthese routers, and then got to wherever\nGoogle's webpage happens to be hosted.\n\n486\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.965\nNow, as I went through that path,\n\n487\n00:22:30.965 --> 00:22:35.681\nI exit my network with a public\nIP on the Internet, right?\n\n488\n00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:42.786\nAnd if I pull that up,\nlet me just show you guys real quick,\n\n489\n00:22:42.786 --> 00:22:48.441\nwe'll use a website called Showmemy.info.\n\n490\n00:22:48.441 --> 00:22:52.265\nAll right, so when I went out,\nI've basically had to go out with a public\n\n491\n00:22:52.265 --> 00:22:55.480\naddress, and that public address\nis tied to this building.\n\n492\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.327\nYou know, let's actually take a moment,\nlet me do whatismyip.com.\n\n493\n00:23:00.327 --> 00:23:02.069\nSomebody will tell me my IP.\n&gt;&gt; More than one way to skin a cat, right?\n\n494\n00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:04.645\nI know, I just want to know my IP,\nhere we go.\n\n495\n00:23:04.645 --> 00:23:10.030\nSo here's my IP 209.251.131.98,\nthat's my identity on the Internet.\n\n496\n00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.690\nAnd anybody on the Internet is\nseeing me as this IP right now.\n\n497\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.360\nBut if I build up a tunnel, all my data\ngets hidden as it crosses the tunnel to\n\n498\n00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.238\nthe other side, and\nthe Internet doesn't see that anymore.\n\n499\n00:23:22.238 --> 00:23:25.049\nAnd so if I had a tunnel up,\nthey wouldn't see this IP,\n\n500\n00:23:25.049 --> 00:23:27.676\nthey would see the IP at\nthe other end of the tunnel,\n\n501\n00:23:27.676 --> 00:23:32.180\ncuz all of my data was hidden all the way\nup until the exit point of that tunnel.\n\n502\n00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:36.460\nSo let me show if I bring up a tunnel,\nwhat that's going to look like, okay?\n\n503\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.953\nAnd I'm going to keep this trace route\nhere that I did to Google open, and\n\n504\n00:23:40.953 --> 00:23:45.315\nin another window, I'm gonna to just\nfire up a VPN tunnel real quick.\n\n505\n00:23:45.315 --> 00:23:50.534\nAnd I'm going to route my data through\nMiami, just for fun, there we go, okay.\n\n506\n00:23:50.534 --> 00:23:53.160\nSo now, hang on let me make\nsure that actually came up.\n\n507\n00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.100\nThere we go, all right.\n\n508\n00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.584\nSo now my traffic,\nI told it to route it through Miami,\n\n509\n00:23:56.584 --> 00:23:58.804\nI'm doing a VPN tunnel\ndown to a server in Miami.\n\n510\n00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:02.265\nAnd if I rerun this trace\nroute to Google and\n\n511\n00:24:02.265 --> 00:24:08.340\nI take a look at where I go,\nI'm getting a different path this time.\n\n512\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.140\nA much longer path.\n\n513\n00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.657\nCuz I took a longer route,\na circuitous route to get there.\n\n514\n00:24:13.657 --> 00:24:14.448\nThat's my big word of the day.\n\n515\n00:24:14.448 --> 00:24:17.501\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I can see where I hit a gateway,\n\n516\n00:24:17.501 --> 00:24:19.280\nwhat is that gateway?\n\n517\n00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.950\nWell, that's actually the VPN tunnel.\n\n518\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:26.250\nI'm not seeing GRU anymore,\nI'm seeing this tunnel.\n\n519\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.730\nAnd from there,\nI'm bouncing through Cogent, right?\n\n520\n00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.819\nCogent Communications are another\nInternet backbone provider.\n\n521\n00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:34.423\nAnd it looks like we're bouncing around\nCogent's network quite a bit before\n\n522\n00:24:34.423 --> 00:24:37.650\nfinally dumping off at where\nGoogle's server is actually sitting.\n\n523\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.002\nAnd they've got a Miami server,\nwhich is interesting cuz I went through so\n\n524\n00:24:40.002 --> 00:24:40.759\nmany hops to get there.\n\n525\n00:24:40.759 --> 00:24:44.090\nBut you've got a long tunnel to get there.\n\n526\n00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.117\nSo I'm now going a different\npath than I was before.\n\n527\n00:24:47.117 --> 00:24:52.084\nAnd if I take a look at my IP address,\nlet me just refresh this,\n\n528\n00:24:52.084 --> 00:24:55.834\nit was 209.251.131.whatever.\n\n529\n00:24:55.834 --> 00:24:57.836\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n530\n00:24:57.836 --> 00:25:00.885\n&gt;&gt; It's gone, now it's 196.52.22.238.\n\n531\n00:25:00.885 --> 00:25:03.590\nThat's the end of the tunnel.\n\n532\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.674\nAll of my data between me and the end of\nthe tunnel is encrypted and secured, and\n\n533\n00:25:06.674 --> 00:25:08.004\nthat kind of becomes invisible.\n\n534\n00:25:08.004 --> 00:25:12.299\nAnd if I'm crossing an untrusted network,\nnow it is trusted,\n\n535\n00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:14.170\nat least until the tunnel.\n\n536\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.758\nAnd if I go back to my diagram, what I'm\nactually doing here is I'm going from home\n\n537\n00:25:17.758 --> 00:25:20.056\nto a server, and\nthat's the part that's secured.\n\n538\n00:25:20.056 --> 00:25:23.418\nBut from the server, I'm then going\nback out to the Internet, and\n\n539\n00:25:23.418 --> 00:25:25.050\nthat part is not trusted.\n\n540\n00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:29.010\nBut if it was me talking to a work\ncomputer, it's now safe and secure and\n\n541\n00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:29.738\nprotected.\n\n542\n00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:33.408\nVPN tunnels like these really\nare the best solution for\n\n543\n00:25:33.408 --> 00:25:35.930\nusing networks you don't trust.\n\n544\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.930\nAnytime that I'm not at my office,\nwhen I'm at the office,\n\n545\n00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.710\nI can talk to servers directly.\n\n546\n00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.450\nBut when I'm at home, when I'm at a hotel,\nwhen I'm on an airport wireless,\n\n547\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:49.930\nwhen I'm traveling,\nI always use a VPN tunnel like this.\n\n548\n00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.810\nSo the best way to be\nable to trust a network,\n\n549\n00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:59.320\nto not have your data get compromised, to\nnot be on some kind of rogue fake network,\n\n550\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.930\nis to go ahead and connect,\nand bring up a VPN tunnel.\n\n551\n00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.190\nSo if you don't have one,\ntalk to your IT department,\n\n552\n00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.730\nthey can help you get set up with it.\n\n553\n00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:11.140\nIf they don't have a VPN technology,\nthen it usually means one of two things.\n\n554\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.006\nEither, one, they just haven't\ngotten to it yet, and they need to.\n\n555\n00:26:13.006 --> 00:26:15.120\nSo definitely ask for it.\n\n556\n00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.650\nOr two, maybe you're not supposed to\nbe using that data while traveling.\n\n557\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.260\nMany companies have a policy like that\nthat says look, while you're traveling,\n\n558\n00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.400\nyou don't have access\nto corporate resources.\n\n559\n00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.910\nAnd they have very good reason for\ndoing that.\n\n560\n00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.490\nSo make sure you understand your\ncompany's security policy, because\n\n561\n00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.760\nif you're not supposed to be accessing\ndata remotely, then you shouldn't be.\n\n562\n00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.790\nBut in this day and age of always-on,\nalways-connected email, at a minimum,\n\n563\n00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.530\nyou wanna access your company email.\n\n564\n00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:40.909\nAnd so for that, having secure\nconnections are the key way to do that.\n\n565\n00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:43.806\nAnd there's ways to do\nemail without a VPN, but\n\n566\n00:26:43.806 --> 00:26:47.580\na VPN is the way to make sure that\nall of your data is protected.\n\n567\n00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.801\nSo that's kind of the lesson of\nthis whole story, in the episode,\n\n568\n00:26:50.801 --> 00:26:54.827\nis we get a chance to see what an unsecure\nnetwork is, what an untrusted network is,\n\n569\n00:26:54.827 --> 00:26:58.565\nand how there's not really a way that we\ncan truly identify that without going\n\n570\n00:26:58.565 --> 00:27:02.513\nthrough all the hoops of authentication,\nwhich most companies just don't do.\n\n571\n00:27:02.513 --> 00:27:05.101\nSo a VPN is how we solve that.\n\n572\n00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:07.060\nThat's really the best\nsolution that's available.\n\n573\n00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.170\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwise words from our good friend, Mr.\n\n574\n00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.520\nDon Pezet, here,\nabout using untrusted networks.\n\n575\n00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.470\nSometimes, they are our only options.\n\n576\n00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:17.600\nBut that doesn't mean we don't have a way\naround to circumnavigate that little\n\n577\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.430\npitfall that we could fall into,\nwe wanna keep our data safe.\n\n578\n00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.830\nBut if you can, always use either a\ntrusted home network or a work network and\n\n579\n00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.740\ntry to stay off of those nasties out\nthere that are looking to steal and\n\n580\n00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.130\ntake from us in bad, bad ways.\n\n581\n00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.813\nDon, thanks for joining us today,\nwe appreciate your time and\n\n582\n00:27:32.813 --> 00:27:33.400\neffort in this show.\n\n583\n00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.995\nIs there any parting words\nof wisdom before we go?\n\n584\n00:27:35.995 --> 00:27:39.497\n&gt;&gt; If you've never used a VP,\nthe one that I used,\n\n585\n00:27:39.497 --> 00:27:42.574\nit kind of looked a little intimidating.\n\n586\n00:27:42.574 --> 00:27:43.793\n&gt;&gt; It did [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH].\n\n587\n00:27:43.793 --> 00:27:45.023\n&gt;&gt; I'm a-\n&gt;&gt; The techie.\n\n588\n00:27:45.023 --> 00:27:47.993\n&gt;&gt; Security instructor, a techie, and so\nI need to be able to choose which city I\n\n589\n00:27:47.993 --> 00:27:50.350\nconnect to, so that's why I\nhave that little script set up.\n\n590\n00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:54.130\nFor you, when you're company sets it up,\nit's literally a button you double-click\n\n591\n00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.016\non, or\nsometimes a switch you flip [LAUGH].\n\n592\n00:27:56.016 --> 00:27:58.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's really just a GUI element,\n\n593\n00:27:58.713 --> 00:28:01.770\nthey're super easy to use\nonce they're configured.\n\n594\n00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.750\nSo just talk to your IT department,\nthey can get it set up,\n\n595\n00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.280\nit's really not a big deal.\n\n596\n00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.767\nAnd it gives you that piece of mind\nthat you know you can trust the network.\n\n597\n00:28:07.767 --> 00:28:09.550\nSo definitely something\nyou wanna look into.\n\n598\n00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.050\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff.\n\n599\n00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.750\nWell, Don, thanks for joining us today,\nwe do appreciate your time and effort.\n\n600\n00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:16.410\nWe appreciate our audience out there\nwatching and hopefully learning, and\n\n601\n00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:18.320\nbeing entertained maybe\na little bit as well.\n\n602\n00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.130\nBut looking at the clock, it is that time\nfor us to call it a day, at least for\n\n603\n00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:21.990\nthis episode.\n\n604\n00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.580\nWe do thank you again for joining us, but\n\n605\n00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.620\nsigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n606\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.895\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n607\n00:28:27.895 -->

It is going great, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.680\nGlad to be back on the show and\n\n15\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.390\nin this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at malicious software.\n\n16\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.205\n&gt;&gt; Dun dun dun.\n\n17\n00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:38.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know it\n\n18\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.553\nsounds bad because it is bad right?\n\n19\n00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:41.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Malicious software,\n\n20\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.060\nthis is software that does\nbad stuff to your computer.\n\n21\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.280\nSo obviously you don't want it.\n\n22\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.372\nSo we're gonna talk a little bit about\nhow to identify it, ways to not get it.\n\n23\n00:00:48.372 --> 00:00:49.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.920\n&gt;&gt; Or a ways to identify that you've\n\n25\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.210\nalready gotten it, because unfortunately\nall too off to goes undiagnosed.\n\n26\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.890\nSo it's the silent killer.\n\n27\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n28\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.170\nwe need to be able to recognize that and\n\n29\n00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.190\nhopefully you avoid stumbling into\nthis kind of problem on our own.\n\n30\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.870\nSo that's what we're gonna take\na look at right here in this episode.\n\n31\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.807\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don,\nI've taken many of these calls.\n\n32\n00:01:06.807 --> 00:01:10.093\nI feel that I'm gonna talk to the people\nin the end of the phone and they're\n\n33\n00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:13.755\ndesperate and saying, something's wrong\nwith my computer, I take a look at it.\n\n34\n00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:17.997\nAnd they're infected with some malicious\nsoftware and then almost invariably,\n\n35\n00:01:17.997 --> 00:01:20.750\nthe number one question is,\nhow did I get this?\n\n36\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.805\nSo, Don, how do they get this?\n\n37\n00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:24.695\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n38\n00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:28.785\nyou go to look at, as an IT guy,\nyou go to look at somebody's computer and\n\n39\n00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:32.705\nthen one of the first questions that we'll\nask is what have you changed recently?\n\n40\n00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.385\nHave you installed anything new and\n\n41\n00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:38.175\nthe answer is always the same nope,\nI didn't do anything.\n\n42\n00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:42.505\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, innocent your honor [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Turns out they usually have but\n\n43\n00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:45.770\nit isn't always that cut and dry, right.\n\n44\n00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.050\nWhen you browse the Internet,\nthere are websites that you know and\n\n45\n00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.790\nyou trust, right?\n\n46\n00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.640\nThere are sites, like Microsoft.com and\nAdobe.com, Apple.com.\n\n47\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.570\nThese are big companies that\nhave very secure websites.\n\n48\n00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.650\nBut every now and then,\nyou have a question about something.\n\n49\n00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.625\nLike, I wonder how many\ndifferent colors horses come in?\n\n50\n00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:04.880\n[LAUGH] And so I'll go and\ndo a Google search.\n\n51\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.023\nAnd this is outside of my area of\nexpertise, I don't know much about horses.\n\n52\n00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:09.122\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Four legs and a big head,\n\n53\n00:02:09.122 --> 00:02:10.170\nthat's all I know.\n\n54\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.040\nSo I go on Google and do a search.\n\n55\n00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.230\nHorse colors,\nI don't even know how you search that.\n\n56\n00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.470\nI didn't know it is in my head but\nwe search for\n\n57\n00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.880\nit and\nyou get a list of sites with the answers.\n\n58\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.510\nBut these are sites that\nyou've never heard of, right?\n\n59\n00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.090\nMaybe they're trustworthy,\nmaybe they aren't.\n\n60\n00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.890\nGoogle doesn't do the greatest job,\n\n61\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.790\nit's not really their job to disseminate\nwhich site is good and which site is bad.\n\n62\n00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.200\nAnd so we click a link,\n\n63\n00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.920\nwe go maybe we learn what colors\nhorses come in maybe we don't.\n\n64\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.600\nAnd in the meantime,\nwe get what's called drive by malware,\n\n65\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.960\nmalware that gets installed\nfrom these malicious websites.\n\n66\n00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.930\nIt can actually be\nembedded in the website.\n\n67\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.320\nThat's one way that we can get it.\n\n68\n00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.810\nYou might not even see it when it happens.\n\n69\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.410\nIt happens in the background,\nunbeknownst to you.\n\n70\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.990\nIt might be very obvious.\n\n71\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.490\nYou get a fake warning that\npops up on the screen saying,\n\n72\n00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.770\nwarning your computer is infected\nwith a virus even though it isn't.\n\n73\n00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.520\n&gt;&gt; They love that one.\n\n74\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.140\n&gt;&gt; And then, click here, install our\nsoftware will help you get it clean.\n\n75\n00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.880\nAnd what you're actually installing\nis the malware, is the bad software.\n\n76\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.840\nThey trick you.\n\n77\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.470\nIt's social engineering at it's finest,\nreally.\n\n78\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.690\nBecause it's very effective.\n\n79\n00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.350\nThat's one way.\n\n80\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.590\nBut it's not necessarily just websites.\n\n81\n00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.370\nIt could be removable media, right?\n\n82\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.190\nMaybe Daniel wants to give me a file.\n\n83\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.240\nSo, you put the file on the USB key and\ngives me the USB key\n\n84\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.140\nwell if his machine is infected,\nthe USB key could be infected.\n\n85\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.900\nAnd now I put it in my computer,\nI get infected thanks to this USB key.\n\n86\n00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.745\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna say that I have\ndone that but I have done that.\n\n87\n00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:32.437\n[LAUGH] I was an annoying guy in college.\n\n88\n00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:34.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It certainly can happen right?\n\n89\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.810\nIt can happen in purpose\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n90\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.400\n&gt;&gt; It could be attackers\nspecifically attack me that way.\n\n91\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.530\nOr it could be an accident\njust like unknown to Daniel.\n\n92\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.626\nIt happens,\nmaybe not hopefully to you Daniel.\n\n93\n00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:45.906\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, [LAUGH] so\n\n94\n00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:48.130\nthat's another way that we can get it.\n\n95\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.430\nEmail, email is like the number one way of\nmoving this malicious software right now.\n\n96\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.230\nYou get an email from somebody,\nmaybe somebody you know.\n\n97\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.490\nRight, so now somebody you trust.\n\n98\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.320\nDaniel just sent me an email, it's got\nthis attachment on and I need to read it.\n\n99\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.720\nAnd I go and I open it, and now that\nattachment has infected my machine.\n\n100\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.920\nNow that´s an especially tricky one cuz,\n\n101\n00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.250\nwhat if your job requires you to\nopen attachments from strangers?\n\n102\n00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.170\nWhat if you work in a HR department,\nhuman resources?\n\n103\n00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.190\nAnd as part of your job responsibility,\nyou have to look at resumes.\n\n104\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.370\nPeople are sending you\nresumes every single day.\n\n105\n00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.890\nI wanna a job, here's my resume.\n\n106\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.932\nI think I will be a great fit for\nthis job, here is my resume.\n\n107\n00:04:23.932 --> 00:04:27.730\nYou're getting word documents and\nPDFs and you have to open them.\n\n108\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.480\nYou can't just say, well,\nwhy aren't you coming for an interview?\n\n109\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.300\nI am not gonna open your resume.\n\n110\n00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You can't do that, right?\n\n111\n00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.490\nSo, if it's your job,\nif you have to open these documents.\n\n112\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.200\nBut you're worried about\nthere being viruses or\n\n113\n00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.440\nmalicious software embedded in that.\n\n114\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.094\nThat creates a real conundrum.\n\n115\n00:04:43.094 --> 00:04:45.044\nI'm gonna bring my big\nword to this episode.\n\n116\n00:04:45.044 --> 00:04:47.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it creates a problem, right?\n\n117\n00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.100\nBut that's another great way, is that\nemail attachments are great carriers for\n\n118\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.130\nmalicious software.\n\n119\n00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.810\nIf you're the attacker, it's great.\n\n120\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.830\nIf you're the recipient,\nit's not so great.\n\n121\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.070\nIt's pretty frustrating, really.\n\n122\n00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.910\nAnd then just Office documents in general.\n\n123\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.790\nThose documents like PDFs and\nWord documents, they can contain malware.\n\n124\n00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.910\nAnd it's possible that somebody had\na laptop or desktop that got infected.\n\n125\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.590\nThey infected a file and the file is\nnow put on your company's storage.\n\n126\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.440\nAnd so all the machines in the company\nare now able to access this file.\n\n127\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.010\nAnd if they do, they become infected too.\n\n128\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.700\nThose are all different vectors that\na malware can use to get installed in\n\n129\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.730\nyour machine.\n\n130\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.370\nSometimes you can see it and if you're\nsmart, if you know what you're doing,\n\n131\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.930\nyou can avoid it, right?\n\n132\n00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.200\nOther times,\nit's almost completely hidden and secret,\n\n133\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.000\nand even if you're doing your due\ndiligence, you're doing your best,\n\n134\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.140\nyou can still have been infected\nwith malware via these sources.\n\n135\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.810\nAnd that's what makes\nthis such a challenge,\n\n136\n00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.720\nit is a difficult thing to identify,\nespecially when you receive an email or\n\n137\n00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.220\nsomething from someone you trust,\nfrom somebody you know.\n\n138\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.970\nThat the idea of their being malware\ninside of there isn't even in your\n\n139\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.130\nmind at that point.\n\n140\n00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.300\nBut it very well could be.\n\n141\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.590\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, now that we know like kinda\nhow these things get on to our systems,\n\n142\n00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.970\nwhat kinda fallout can we expect if we\ndo get infected with malicious software?\n\n143\n00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.310\nIs that what we're talking firecrackers or\nare we going nuclear here?\n\n144\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.964\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's kind of all across the board.\n\n145\n00:06:06.964 --> 00:06:11.869\nSome malware is so minor and so barely\nnoticeable that you could be infected for\n\n146\n00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:15.140\nyears and not even realize it's there.\n\n147\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.775\nI've seen malware variants where all they\ndo is display an extra advertisement at\n\n148\n00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:22.003\nthe bottom of every web page you visit.\n\n149\n00:06:22.003 --> 00:06:23.772\nOkay, well, if I go to a website,\n\n150\n00:06:23.772 --> 00:06:26.580\nusually I don't even make it\nto the bottom of the page.\n\n151\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.000\nIt doesn't really matter to me.\n\n152\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.740\nBut if I do make it to the bottom,\nI see an ad,\n\n153\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.930\nI'll just assume it's part\nof the web page, right?\n\n154\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.050\nI don't know what ads different pages run.\n\n155\n00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.460\nSo I'm browsing the internet\nnot even realizing it.\n\n156\n00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.960\nMeanwhile, every time that ad is displayed\nat the bottom of the page that I don't\n\n157\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.350\neven see, whoever made that malware\nis getting half a penny or whatever,\n\n158\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.190\nit's a small amount.\n\n159\n00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.110\nBut when it's done million of times,\nit equals out to a lot of money.\n\n160\n00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.635\nThat type of malware is not\nreally intrusive, right?\n\n161\n00:06:54.635 --> 00:06:56.205\nIt's just kinda sitting there by the side.\n\n162\n00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:59.395\nBut it's there and\nit is eating up memory on your system.\n\n163\n00:06:59.395 --> 00:07:04.790\nIt's making you display ads that might\nnot be workplace appropriate or whatever.\n\n164\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.033\nIt's doing something that\nyou don't want to do.\n\n165\n00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:09.423\nThat's why they call it malware,\nmalicious software,\n\n166\n00:07:09.423 --> 00:07:11.680\nmalware is just an amalgam\nof those two words.\n\n167\n00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.930\nAnd it's software that's doing something\nthat you don't want it to do right.\n\n168\n00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.200\nBut that's a really low key example,\nlet's go worse right.\n\n169\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.600\nIt can delete your documents.\n\n170\n00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.150\nSo you might have pictures,\n\n171\n00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.390\nyour family pictures all the way\nback to when you started a family.\n\n172\n00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.900\nAnd you get malware installed and\n\n173\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.960\nit just deletes them all and\nthey're gone and that's that.\n\n174\n00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.380\nAnd if you got a backup, great.\n\n175\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.467\nBut if you don't have a backup,\nyou just lost those photos and\n\n176\n00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:37.204\nthose photos aren't\nsomething you can recreate.\n\n177\n00:07:37.204 --> 00:07:39.245\nI guess you could get the family,\nget them to repose.\n\n178\n00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:41.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you got your kids growing up,\n\n179\n00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.060\nobviously you're not gonna\nbe able to repose that,\n\n180\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.343\nwell you get new kids I guess.\n\n181\n00:07:46.343 --> 00:07:47.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we don't want that to happen.\n\n182\n00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.236\n&gt;&gt; Malware hit me, honey, we're gonna have\nto have more kids, what are we gonna do?\n\n183\n00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:50.324\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What are you gonna do?\n\n184\n00:07:50.324 --> 00:07:53.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It could be even worse, though.\n\n185\n00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.954\nSome malware will start doing what's\ncalled thrashing the hard drive.\n\n186\n00:07:56.954 --> 00:08:00.684\nWhere it starts hitting your hard drive,\nreading it as hard as it can over and\n\n187\n00:08:00.684 --> 00:08:03.308\nover and over again,\nreading the same sector over and\n\n188\n00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:05.390\nover again trying to cause a failure.\n\n189\n00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.510\nAnd it can actually cause your hard\ndrive to fail or your CPU to burn up.\n\n190\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.290\nThere's different types of attacks\nthat are actually focused on\n\n191\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.240\nburning out the hardware in your computer.\n\n192\n00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.950\nThese are far less common,\nbut they are real.\n\n193\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.090\nThey are out there.\n\n194\n00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.940\nAnd it causes actual physical\ndamage to your system.\n\n195\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.970\nIf it's just bad software and\nyou're getting extra ads,\n\n196\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.700\nyou can always format your computer and\nreinstall it.\n\n197\n00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.130\nYour IT department can help\nyou do that easy, right?\n\n198\n00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.484\nBut if it burns out the hard drive or\nit burns out the CPU,\n\n199\n00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:32.544\nthen now it's an actual mechanical\nfailure that's gotta be replaced,\n\n200\n00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:34.740\nthat's a much more difficult thing to do.\n\n201\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.884\nSo that's a type of a very\naggressive type of malware.\n\n202\n00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:41.028\nBut it could also be even worse, which is,\n\n203\n00:08:41.028 --> 00:08:44.975\nit's silent malware that runs in\nthe background, you don't even notice it.\n\n204\n00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:47.449\nAnd meanwhile,\nit's collecting all your keystrokes,\n\n205\n00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:49.340\nthey have what are called keyloggers.\n\n206\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.055\nThey record every key that\nyou push on the keyboard and\n\n207\n00:08:52.055 --> 00:08:55.220\nit sends it to an offsite server.\n\n208\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.380\nNow somebody off site can wait\nuntil they see you login.\n\n209\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.366\nThey see me go to gmail.com and\nprovide a username and a password.\n\n210\n00:09:02.366 --> 00:09:05.010\nNow they've got a record, now they\nknow my username and password, right?\n\n211\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.010\nSo I'm now leaking data,\nI'm leaking credentials out.\n\n212\n00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.760\nMalware can do that,\nthey're trying to grab your information.\n\n213\n00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.187\nMalware can make it where when\nyou go to a particular web page,\n\n214\n00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:17.720\nyou're actually seeing a fake\nform of that web page, again, so\n\n215\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.990\nthey can harvest your credentials.\n\n216\n00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.750\nWe saw that in one of\nthe earlier episodes.\n\n217\n00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.440\nBut all of these are just different\napproaches that malware can take.\n\n218\n00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.110\nBut almost all of them do have\none characteristic in common.\n\n219\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.480\nIn addition to all that\nother stuff they can do,\n\n220\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.690\nthey almost always turn your\nsystem into a transmitter.\n\n221\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.450\nWhere you are now trying to\ninfect other machines, right?\n\n222\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.850\nSo you're infected and\n\n223\n00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.340\nnow your computer starts attacking\nthe other machines on your network.\n\n224\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.910\nSo your corporate network\nmight have 1,000 computers.\n\n225\n00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.940\nAnd if even one machine gets infected,\n\n226\n00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.510\nnow it tries to infect the other\n1,000 that are right there.\n\n227\n00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.427\nAnd that's the real challenge of malware,\nstopping it from spreading.\n\n228\n00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:58.933\nIt can really get in there and\nstart to infect all of your machines,\n\n229\n00:09:58.933 --> 00:10:00.729\nreally causing a bigger outage.\n\n230\n00:10:00.729 --> 00:10:04.820\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\nI'm gonna throw this word out, ransomware,\n\n231\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.350\nthis is the big buzz word of the day\nwhen it comes to malicious software,\n\n232\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.400\nprobably see it all the time in the news.\n\n233\n00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.670\nIt's happening more and more.\n\n234\n00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.140\nWhere does that fit into this picture?\n\n235\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.665\n&gt;&gt; Okay, ransomware's a tricky one.\n\n236\n00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:17.862\nAnd it is probably the most\npopular attack right now.\n\n237\n00:10:17.862 --> 00:10:20.731\nIt used to be that when\nhackers would write a virus,\n\n238\n00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:24.084\nthat a lot of the times they did it for\nnotoriety, for fame.\n\n239\n00:10:24.084 --> 00:10:25.520\nLook what I did, right?\n\n240\n00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.885\nAnd if you get a virus on your computer\nand it deletes all your files,\n\n241\n00:10:28.885 --> 00:10:30.550\nwhat good did that do the hacker?\n\n242\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.648\nNothing, I mean, they get to say they did\nit, look, I messed with all these people.\n\n243\n00:10:35.648 --> 00:10:39.010\nBut ransomware takes a different approach.\n\n244\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.391\nRansomware says,\nwe're not gonna delete your files,\n\n245\n00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.220\nwe're gonna encrypt your files.\n\n246\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.980\nThe malware gets installed on your\nsystem and it encrypts all of your data.\n\n247\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.393\nNow once encrypted, you can't get at it.\n\n248\n00:10:49.393 --> 00:10:53.217\nBut the data is still there,\nthe data is there, it's just ciphered and\n\n249\n00:10:53.217 --> 00:10:55.910\nyou can't read it without the key.\n\n250\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.300\nAnd the attacker can\nthen request a ransom.\n\n251\n00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:06.532\nThey can say, hey, if you pay me $1,000\nI'll decrypt your files for you.\n\n252\n00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:08.784\nAnd now you've got a choice, right?\n\n253\n00:11:08.784 --> 00:11:12.946\nEither you give up on all those files or\nyou pay the $1,000 and\n\n254\n00:11:12.946 --> 00:11:15.910\nthey unlock your files, well, sometimes.\n\n255\n00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.252\nSometimes they don't, sometimes they\ntake the $1,000 and that's that, right?\n\n256\n00:11:18.252 --> 00:11:20.494\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now you get nothing.\n\n257\n00:11:20.494 --> 00:11:23.379\nThese aren't trustworthy people\nthat you're dealing with.\n\n258\n00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:26.708\nBut a lot of times, they actually do give\nyou the key and they decrypt the data and\n\n259\n00:11:26.708 --> 00:11:29.710\noff you go until the next time it\nhappens [LAUGH] cuz it'll happen again.\n\n260\n00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.380\nThat's what ransomware does.\n\n261\n00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.050\nRansomware has become so popular,\nbecause it's monetized, right?\n\n262\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.220\nThe attacker can actually\nmake money on it.\n\n263\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.380\nAll the old viruses,\nthe ones that used to make the news about\n\n264\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.260\nflooding the Internet with traffic, or\ntaking Microsoft's website down, or\n\n265\n00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.370\ndeleting your files,\nthose were just for fame.\n\n266\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.160\nBut most people would pick\nto be fabulously rich over\n\n267\n00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.690\nbeing fabulously popular.\n\n268\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.980\nAnd hackers are no different,\nthey would love to have that money.\n\n269\n00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.020\nAnd so that's why ransomware has really\ngrown to be the number one threat\n\n270\n00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.570\nthat's out there.\n\n271\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.250\nI mean it is a big deal.\n\n272\n00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.820\nAnd you read about it all the time,\nhospitals,\n\n273\n00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.510\nbanks, schools, where their\ncorporate servers get encrypted.\n\n274\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.790\nAnd they've gotta pay the ransom\nto get that data back.\n\n275\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.105\nIf they had good backups,\nthat wouldn't be a problem, right?\n\n276\n00:12:15.105 --> 00:12:16.844\nThey'd go, all right,\nwell, forget your ransom,\n\n277\n00:12:16.844 --> 00:12:18.550\nI'll just go restore from my backups.\n\n278\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.050\nBut most home users don't do backups.\n\n279\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.370\nAnd so now they've got no choice but\nto pay to get that data back.\n\n280\n00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.812\nAnd so that's really the big challenge.\n\n281\n00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:29.180\nBut that's where ransomware fits in,\nis it's taking the old attack models and\n\n282\n00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.390\njust moving it a step further so\nthe attackers can actually make money.\n\n283\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.320\n&gt;&gt; So, Don, is it super obvious\nwhen we've been infected with\n\n284\n00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.950\nsomething like ransomware?\n\n285\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.015\n&gt;&gt; It can be, right?\n\n286\n00:12:39.015 --> 00:12:41.643\nIn the example of a keylogger,\nthat I mentioned earlier,\n\n287\n00:12:41.643 --> 00:12:43.300\nyou wouldn't notice that.\n\n288\n00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.289\nIt's just running in the background,\nand that's that.\n\n289\n00:12:45.289 --> 00:12:46.630\nNo big deal.\n\n290\n00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:51.203\nBut if it's something more insidious,\nlike ransomware, it's very obvious,\n\n291\n00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:54.784\ncuz they'll throw a ransom note\nright on your screen, right?\n\n292\n00:12:54.784 --> 00:12:56.300\nOther times, it can be more subtle, right?\n\n293\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.420\nI mentioned the little advertisement\nat the bottom of the page.\n\n294\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.314\nThere was one going around for a while.\n\n295\n00:12:59.314 --> 00:13:02.154\nSome of you might remember this.\n\n296\n00:13:02.154 --> 00:13:04.520\nYou won a free dinner at Red Lobster.\n\n297\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.470\nDid you ever see that one, Daniel?\n\n298\n00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.191\n&gt;&gt; No, I didn't see that one.\n\n299\n00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:10.187\n&gt;&gt; There was a period of like a year and\na half on the Internet, where every time\n\n300\n00:13:10.187 --> 00:13:14.320\nyou closed your web browser, there were\npop-under ads that would be there.\n\n301\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.622\nYou won a dinner for free.\n\n302\n00:13:15.622 --> 00:13:16.790\nI can't tell you how many times I've won.\n\n303\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.963\nI must be the luckiest person on Earth,\nRed Lobster.\n\n304\n00:13:19.963 --> 00:13:22.023\n&gt;&gt; For the seafood lover in you.\n\n305\n00:13:22.023 --> 00:13:23.263\n&gt;&gt; I guess so [LAUGH].\n\n306\n00:13:23.263 --> 00:13:25.850\n&gt;&gt; Those cheddar-baked biscuits,\ndivine [LAUGH].\n\n307\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.703\n&gt;&gt; So these ads, they weren't really\nobvious while you were browsing\n\n308\n00:13:28.703 --> 00:13:32.321\nthe Internet, it was when you closed your\nbrowser and you saw all these pop-unders.\n\n309\n00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:33.740\nSo sometimes, it's like that.\n\n310\n00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.336\n&gt;&gt; It's funny they chose Red Lobster.\n\n311\n00:13:35.336 --> 00:13:38.831\nI mean, obviously, there's a huge user\nbase going to Red Lobster [LAUGH].\n\n312\n00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:42.081\n&gt;&gt; I guess, yeah, you gotta pick\na national chain or something.\n\n313\n00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:45.811\nBut since ransomware is so popular and\nbecause they have to demand that ransom,\n\n314\n00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:47.360\nit is very obvious, okay?\n\n315\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.260\nSo let me walk you through a little bit\nof an example of how this can work.\n\n316\n00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.762\nI've got a Windows 7 machine,\n\n317\n00:13:52.762 --> 00:13:55.442\nwhich is really the most\ncommon business desktop today.\n\n318\n00:13:55.442 --> 00:13:56.485\nSo if you're watching this video,\n\n319\n00:13:56.485 --> 00:13:59.020\nyou're probably watching on\na Windows 7 machine like this.\n\n320\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.561\nAnd I've got just a few documents on here.\n\n321\n00:14:01.561 --> 00:14:04.919\nLike here, I've got the full text of\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland,\n\n322\n00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:07.010\nwhich I pulled from Project Gutenberg.\n\n323\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.430\nSo we can see that that whole text\nright here is a standard document.\n\n324\n00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.405\nThis is my data.\n\n325\n00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:14.705\nNow, on your business machine, you might\nhave hundreds of documents in here.\n\n326\n00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:17.795\nYears worth of work all\nstored right on this system.\n\n327\n00:14:17.795 --> 00:14:19.960\nBut in my case, I just have this one file.\n\n328\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.885\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there's my data.\n\n329\n00:14:21.885 --> 00:14:25.143\nAnd I wanna install some software,\nso I go to a website.\n\n330\n00:14:25.143 --> 00:14:29.525\nMaybe I need to modify a PDF, but I don't\nwanna go out and buy Adobe Acrobat,\n\n331\n00:14:29.525 --> 00:14:31.665\ncuz it's several hundred dollars.\n\n332\n00:14:31.665 --> 00:14:35.439\nSo I go and I find some free version of\nsome PDF editor somewhere that I've never\n\n333\n00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:37.890\nheard of before, and\nI go and I download it.\n\n334\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.930\nWell, when you download software,\nnormally it looks something like this,\n\n335\n00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:41.480\nlike an archive.\n\n336\n00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.170\nSo here's the software installer.\n\n337\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:48.037\nAnd I can open that up, and\ninside of it there's a setup file, right?\n\n338\n00:14:48.037 --> 00:14:49.543\nSo I run the setup file.\n\n339\n00:14:49.543 --> 00:14:52.410\nAnd when I run that,\nit installs the software, right?\n\n340\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.175\nOr it doesn't.\n\n341\n00:14:55.175 --> 00:14:56.010\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's broken.\n\n342\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.115\n&gt;&gt; Nothing's happening, right?\n\n343\n00:14:57.115 --> 00:14:59.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, wait, something happened.\n\n344\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.570\nMy wallpaper just went all crazy.\n\n345\n00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.590\n&gt;&gt; Whoa.\n\n346\n00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.730\n&gt;&gt; What's going on here, okay?\n\n347\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.150\nWhat's going on is,\nthis is all in real-time, right?\n\n348\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.310\nSo in the matter of 15 seconds,\n20 seconds.\n\n349\n00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.794\nThe malware installed itself on my system,\n\n350\n00:15:14.794 --> 00:15:19.130\nit seized administrative rights to\ngain full control of my system.\n\n351\n00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.540\nAnd now it's encrypting my data.\n\n352\n00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.000\nIn fact, it's probably already done\ncuz I don't have a lot of data.\n\n353\n00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.949\nThe more data you have,\nthe longer it can take to encrypt.\n\n354\n00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:29.930\nBut it's encrypting the data,\nand now here's my ransom note.\n\n355\n00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.756\nHere's the note saying, ha ha, I got you.\n\n356\n00:15:32.756 --> 00:15:34.570\nNot necessarily in those words.\n\n357\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.870\nBut close, right?\n\n358\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.990\nIt's telling me, hey,\ncan't you find the necessarily files?\n\n359\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.095\nIs the content of your files not readable?\n\n360\n00:15:41.095 --> 00:15:42.678\nI love how their questions-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:15:42.678 --> 00:15:44.184\n&gt;&gt; They just encrypted our data and\nthey know.\n\n362\n00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:49.703\nAnd then it goes on to say, hey,\nyou have been You've been encrypted and\n\n363\n00:15:49.703 --> 00:15:52.614\nwe're now holding your data ransom.\n\n364\n00:15:52.614 --> 00:15:58.500\nThe only way to decrypt your files is\nto buy the special decryption software.\n\n365\n00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.760\nYou gotta buy this software from them.\n\n366\n00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.189\n&gt;&gt; Let me get out my Visa card Don.\n\n367\n00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:05.210\n&gt;&gt; I know, and well this is where it\ngets tricky cuz this is illegal, right?\n\n368\n00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.328\nSo they won't just take a credit card.\n\n369\n00:16:06.328 --> 00:16:08.257\nThey make you pay in BitCoin,\n\n370\n00:16:08.257 --> 00:16:12.280\nBitCoin which is I'm gonna call\nit an untraceable currency.\n\n371\n00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.400\nIt actually is traceable, but\nit's more of an anonymous currency.\n\n372\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.576\nBut they'll go on to give instructions\non how much money they want and\n\n373\n00:16:18.576 --> 00:16:19.523\nwhere to send it to.\n\n374\n00:16:19.523 --> 00:16:22.362\nHere, they're making you\ninstall a special web browser\n\n375\n00:16:22.362 --> 00:16:26.840\nto be able to get on an anonymous network,\nto be able to relay the payment to them.\n\n376\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.655\nAnd so all this is telling me that\nmy data is now being held ransom.\n\n377\n00:16:30.655 --> 00:16:33.815\nAnd if I close out of that,\nhere is another ransom note just in case\n\n378\n00:16:33.815 --> 00:16:37.959\nI didn't see that one, here's this one and\nit's saying basic instructions right.\n\n379\n00:16:37.959 --> 00:16:41.865\nAnd if I close out of that they've\nactually estimate this software installed\n\n380\n00:16:41.865 --> 00:16:43.739\nproperly, I think it probably did.\n\n381\n00:16:43.739 --> 00:16:45.041\n&gt;&gt; I think it did LAUGH].\n\n382\n00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:49.467\n&gt;&gt; I'll just cancel that but they even\nchange my wallpaper to let me know, and\n\n383\n00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:53.692\nif I look, it's really that same\nmessage again, just being relayed.\n\n384\n00:16:53.692 --> 00:16:56.832\nThis is ransomware, your documents,\nyour photos, databases and\n\n385\n00:16:56.832 --> 00:16:58.936\nother important files have been encrypted.\n\n386\n00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:02.946\nThe only way is to send us some money and\nthen there is the instructions like\n\n387\n00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:06.902\nthey really want you to know how you\ncan send them money, it's all here.\n\n388\n00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:09.120\n&gt;&gt; It's like they want money [LAUGH].\n\n389\n00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's almost like they want money\nand that's the trick of ransom right.\n\n390\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.436\nThey've got a monetization path,\nit drops some files here on my desktop,\n\n391\n00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:18.331\none is just a text file which\nis the first ransom note.\n\n392\n00:17:18.331 --> 00:17:22.139\nThe other one is actually a program which\nnormally I would say you don't wanna run\n\n393\n00:17:22.139 --> 00:17:25.458\nthat program but what's it gonna hurt\nat this point if you [CROSSTALK].\n\n394\n00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:28.633\nYeah so that was the other ransom\nnote the one that's launch in its own\n\n395\n00:17:28.633 --> 00:17:32.219\nlittle window, but if I ignore all that\nand just browse back to my documents.\n\n396\n00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:37.842\nRemember I had the text of Alice in\nWonderland, not anymore, right,now when\n\n397\n00:17:37.842 --> 00:17:43.960\nI look I can see that there's the read\nthis files, which are the ransom notes.\n\n398\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.606\nAnd what used to be Alice in\nWonderland is now GY0TJDE, blah,\n\n399\n00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:50.983\nblah, it's renamed the file.\n\n400\n00:17:50.983 --> 00:17:55.217\nAnd it's not just renamed,\nit's actually been encrypted.\n\n401\n00:17:55.217 --> 00:17:59.020\nAnd I didn't pay attention to the file\nsize earlier, but it is different.\n\n402\n00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.957\nThis file is no longer\nthe file that it used to be.\n\n403\n00:18:01.957 --> 00:18:07.013\nIf I come in and try and rename it right\nso if I just call it Alice.Txt cuz\n\n404\n00:18:07.013 --> 00:18:12.413\nit was just a text file before,so if I\nrename it that right, its not magic,\n\n405\n00:18:12.413 --> 00:18:18.210\nif I come in here, actually you know it\nhasn't had a chance to fully encrypt it.\n\n406\n00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.865\nIf I look, I can still read\nsome of the text right, but\n\n407\n00:18:20.865 --> 00:18:24.287\nnotice these extra characters that\nhave kind of been thrown in here,\n\n408\n00:18:24.287 --> 00:18:27.956\nthe encoding is being changed and\nit's still, [CROSSTALK] there it goes.\n\n409\n00:18:27.956 --> 00:18:31.086\nSo, the header of the file\nI can still see but\n\n410\n00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:34.481\nas I scroll down all of\na sudden it becomes this.\n\n411\n00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:36.526\nAnd if you've never read this,\n\n412\n00:18:36.526 --> 00:18:40.180\nmost of you seen the Disney\ncartoon I'm sure the book is.\n\n413\n00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.013\n&gt;&gt; Not much different\nthan what you're seeing.\n\n414\n00:18:41.013 --> 00:18:41.722\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n415\n00:18:41.722 --> 00:18:43.074\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's long and\n\n416\n00:18:43.074 --> 00:18:45.592\nit's crazy but\nthis is even crazier, right?\n\n417\n00:18:45.592 --> 00:18:46.844\nThis is the data that's been encrypted.\n\n418\n00:18:46.844 --> 00:18:50.760\nSo, they left the header alone so\nI could see that it was the actual data.\n\n419\n00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.343\nIt´s almost like a tease.\n\n420\n00:18:51.343 --> 00:18:52.649\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then, bonk.\n\n421\n00:18:52.649 --> 00:18:56.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, it's not going to do you any good.\n\n422\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:01.354\nMy data is now compromised and, if I've\ngot a backup, I'm not worried about this.\n\n423\n00:19:01.354 --> 00:19:04.454\nI´m like, well that stinks that I allowed\nthat to happen but let me go to the IT\n\n424\n00:19:04.454 --> 00:19:08.005\ndepartment, we can format the machine,\nthey restore from backup, there's my data.\n\n425\n00:19:08.005 --> 00:19:10.850\nBut if I don't have a backup,\nwhat do I do?\n\n426\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.815\nI just lost my data,\nI have to make a choice.\n\n427\n00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:17.356\nCan I get rid of this data or\ndo I pay the ransom?\n\n428\n00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:20.416\nNow if this is just Alice in Wonderland,\nI can go and get that again,\n\n429\n00:19:20.416 --> 00:19:21.830\nnot a big deal, right?\n\n430\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.013\nBut if it's my family photos, if it's\nthe secret formula to Coca Cola, right?\n\n431\n00:19:26.013 --> 00:19:29.562\nIt depends on who you work for, what data\nis important to you then you might not\n\n432\n00:19:29.562 --> 00:19:31.978\nhave that choice and\nyou might have to pay the bribe.\n\n433\n00:19:31.978 --> 00:19:35.563\nNow, some ransomware has been\nbroken by security researchers,\n\n434\n00:19:35.563 --> 00:19:39.794\nthey found out how to decrypt it, but a\nlot of it comes out and it's very new and\n\n435\n00:19:39.794 --> 00:19:43.000\nit's not able to be broken,\nnot able to be reversed.\n\n436\n00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.585\nAnd so you end up with lost data,\nwhat I'm actually looking at right here.\n\n437\n00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:52.030\nNow, I showed this example here for\nthe show because it's very fast.\n\n438\n00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.240\nA lot of ransomeware is not as fast this,\nright?\n\n439\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n440\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.090\n&gt;&gt; I ran and it was a matter of seconds\nbefore my system was encrypted and\n\n441\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.600\nnow my data is lost.\n\n442\n00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.296\nA lot of them will do what's called,\n\n443\n00:20:01.296 --> 00:20:04.163\npre staged encryption where\nthey'll run in the background.\n\n444\n00:20:04.163 --> 00:20:09.017\nAnd they'll encrypt your data in a special\nfolder somewhere that you don't see and\n\n445\n00:20:09.017 --> 00:20:14.160\nwhen only it's encrypted a 100% of your\ndata does it then make it self known.\n\n446\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.822\nBecause if you can catch it during\nthe encryption, you can stop it,\n\n447\n00:20:17.822 --> 00:20:19.438\njust shut your computer off.\n\n448\n00:20:19.438 --> 00:20:22.610\nAnd then you can recover data\nthat hasn't encrypted yet.\n\n449\n00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:23.612\nSo sometimes they'll\nencrypt in the background.\n\n450\n00:20:23.612 --> 00:20:27.230\nIt's called a staged encryption, and\nthat's becoming very popular as well.\n\n451\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.542\nSo by the time you're notified,\nyour data's already fully encrypted, and\n\n452\n00:20:31.542 --> 00:20:33.210\nit's too late at that point.\n\n453\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:33.861\nSo that's another example.\n\n454\n00:20:33.861 --> 00:20:37.917\nOther ones will not only encrypt your\ndata, but they'll start doing whats called\n\n455\n00:20:37.917 --> 00:20:42.209\nBitcoin mining in the background, they'll\nactually start using CPU cycles to try and\n\n456\n00:20:42.209 --> 00:20:45.297\ngenerate some of this anonymous\ncurrency for the attackers.\n\n457\n00:20:45.297 --> 00:20:47.565\n&gt;&gt; It's like they want money.\n\n458\n00:20:47.565 --> 00:20:50.321\n&gt;&gt; It comes back to money, that's\nthe motivation behind this type of attack.\n\n459\n00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:53.354\nAnd there's also, we saw this on a Mac,\n\n460\n00:20:53.354 --> 00:20:57.290\na lot of users out there\nrun Macs these days, right?\n\n461\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.830\nAnd if you're a Mac user,\nyou might be laughing right now, saying,\n\n462\n00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.540\nthat was a Windows 7 machine.\n\n463\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.440\nBut it was just a few months ago that\nthere was the KeRanger ransomware that\n\n464\n00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:11.960\ncame out for Mac OS and it was even more\ninsidious cuz it would get installed and\n\n465\n00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.650\nit would sit quite for three days.\n\n466\n00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.530\nAnd only after three days,\nwould it then start encrypting.\n\n467\n00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.450\nSo by the time it was encrypting,\nyou might think,\n\n468\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.430\nI didn't install anything today.\n\n469\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.500\nBut it was three days ago\nthat it was installed and\n\n470\n00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.690\nit sat there IO and it did exactly\nwhat we just saw right here.\n\n471\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.689\nSo this can work on a MAC,\nit can work on a Windows machine,\n\n472\n00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.047\nit can work on a Linux box.\n\n473\n00:21:32.047 --> 00:21:33.549\nSo it is pervasive like that,\n\n474\n00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:38.120\ndon't feel like you're safe just because\nyou run a particular operating system.\n\n475\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.927\nThese types of attacks\nare very sophisticated and\n\n476\n00:21:39.927 --> 00:21:41.869\nthey're very effective cuz\nthey generate revenue.\n\n477\n00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:44.802\nBecause they generate money,\nthe hackers are motivated by cash and\n\n478\n00:21:44.802 --> 00:21:45.943\nthat's a big motivator.\n\n479\n00:21:45.943 --> 00:21:49.699\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, if they're not OS prejudice,\nwhat can we do to defend against this,\n\n480\n00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:51.114\nhow do we protect ourselves?\n\n481\n00:21:51.114 --> 00:21:53.139\n&gt;&gt; All right well, in the olden days,\n\n482\n00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:56.860\nthis is where I would say you need\nto run antivirus on your system.\n\n483\n00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:01.510\nRight, antivirus can detect these\nfiles and stop them from infecting.\n\n484\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:06.200\nAnd many organizations, yours hopefully\ntoo will have some kind of antivirus.\n\n485\n00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.470\nMaybe Symantec Antivirus, or\nSophos Endpoint Security or\n\n486\n00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.370\nsomething like that that's installed\non your machines that can help.\n\n487\n00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.847\nBut much like doctors,\nsometimes you need a second opinion.\n\n488\n00:22:17.847 --> 00:22:22.480\nSometimes a virus can go\nundiagnosed by one antivirus and\n\n489\n00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.290\na second one might have caught it.\n\n490\n00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.068\nBut you don't want to run two\nanti-viruses on your same computer.\n\n491\n00:22:27.068 --> 00:22:29.173\nIt doesn't work very well, so\nyou normally just run one.\n\n492\n00:22:29.173 --> 00:22:34.500\nSo if you're a person who is dealing\nwith things like file attachments.\n\n493\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.190\nIf you work in human resources.\n\n494\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.580\nYou need a second opinion,\n\n495\n00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.740\nyou need somebody to look at\na file before you open it right.\n\n496\n00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.375\nI just opened this blindly and\nI got infected right,\n\n497\n00:22:44.375 --> 00:22:48.880\nif I had taken the time to run it\nthrough a second opinion somewhere.\n\n498\n00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.444\nI could have found out a little\nbetter here know not to do it.\n\n499\n00:22:51.444 --> 00:22:53.810\nSo let me show you on my desktop\nsince I hosed up the other one.\n\n500\n00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:57.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a website called VirusTotal,\n\n501\n00:22:57.029 --> 00:23:01.091\nVirusTotal it's virustotal.com, It doesn't\nshow it here like with the logo but\n\n502\n00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:02.800\nit is actually owned by Google.\n\n503\n00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.090\nThey were a standalone company and\nGoogle acquired them and\n\n504\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.673\nwhat they do is they allow\nyou to upload a file.\n\n505\n00:23:08.673 --> 00:23:13.959\nAnd they'll scan it with not one, but with\nmany different anti-virus programs, so you\n\n506\n00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:19.051\ndon't have to buy them, you can just rely\non Google, Google buys everything right.\n\n507\n00:23:19.051 --> 00:23:23.138\nSo I could have taken that file and\nI just received this file from Daniel or\n\n508\n00:23:23.138 --> 00:23:27.426\nI received it as a resume attached to\nan email and I wanna open it, but before I\n\n509\n00:23:27.426 --> 00:23:32.190\nopen it, it let me just run it through\nVirusTotal here and see what they say.\n\n510\n00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.062\nAnd so I can come to their\nwebsite it's completely free,\n\n511\n00:23:34.062 --> 00:23:35.005\nit doesn't cost you a dime.\n\n512\n00:23:35.005 --> 00:23:39.935\nYou can go to their website, anybody\ncan use it, work, home,doesn't matter,\n\n513\n00:23:39.935 --> 00:23:42.220\nand you can upload and scan a file and so\n\n514\n00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.597\nI'm gonna upload that file that I just\nsetup.exe And so I'm gonna upload it.\n\n515\n00:23:47.597 --> 00:23:50.185\nIt's computing a hash which\nis like a signature for\n\n516\n00:23:50.185 --> 00:23:53.992\na file tho help it identify it, and\nthen it's gonna tell me about the file.\n\n517\n00:23:53.992 --> 00:23:58.258\nAnd notice what it did,\n54 engines detected this file.\n\n518\n00:23:58.258 --> 00:24:02.115\nThat means 54 different\nantivirus products, okay,\n\n519\n00:24:02.115 --> 00:24:05.170\nwhat antivirus am I\nrunning on my computer?\n\n520\n00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.650\nI'm actually not, on that Windows\nmachine it was Windows Defender but\n\n521\n00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.300\non my Linux Box I'm not\nrunning antivirus at all.\n\n522\n00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.839\nBut here I just got 54 software packages\nthat were able to identify this,\n\n523\n00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:21.090\nand it actually ran against more,\nit ran it against 63 all said and done.\n\n524\n00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.960\nThat means that nine products\ndidn't find the virus.\n\n525\n00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd not wanna be running\nthat virus product right now.\n\n526\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.370\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's easy to say that.\n\n527\n00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna run one of those nine.\n\n528\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:32.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are horrible.\n\n529\n00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.030\n&gt;&gt; Those stink.\n\n530\n00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:36.370\n&gt;&gt; But the reality is,\njust like doctors in real life, right,\n\n531\n00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.060\nyou might have a great doctor who\nhas saved your life five times.\n\n532\n00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.200\nBut the sixth time,\nmaybe they just didn't see something,\n\n533\n00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.030\nand another doctor might have seen it.\n\n534\n00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.390\nNobody's perfect, right?\n\n535\n00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.720\nAnd these antivirus softwares,\nthey each work a different way.\n\n536\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.200\nAnd none of them are perfect,\nthey're not gonna catch them all.\n\n537\n00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.746\nIt's not like Pokemon, right?\n\n538\n00:24:52.746 --> 00:24:53.844\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna catch them all.\n\n539\n00:24:53.844 --> 00:24:57.624\nWe gotta really kind of hedge\nour bets across all of them and\n\n540\n00:24:57.624 --> 00:24:59.720\nthat's what virus total does.\n\n541\n00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.020\nThat's why it's so effective.\n\n542\n00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.690\nAnd so I can look down this list, and\n\n543\n00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:06.390\nsome of these products you'll recognize\nreally quick, like AVG and Avast.\n\n544\n00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:11.308\nThose are two big ones, Bit Defender,\nCylance is another big one,\n\n545\n00:25:11.308 --> 00:25:12.810\nESET, F-Secure.\n\n546\n00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.440\nSymantec will be in here,\nI think I just went past McAfee.\n\n547\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.510\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] I'm gonna trust them.\n\n552\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.200\n&gt;&gt; I've never heard of these,\nright, and you're right,\n\n553\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.800\nmaybe I would never even consider\ninstalling software called TheHacker.\n\n554\n00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.660\nBut sure enough if I had, it would've\nrecognize this as a virus, right.\n\n555\n00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.770\nSo, if you're in an HR role, if you're\nin a role where you're dealing with\n\n556\n00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.270\nfile attached or\neven if it's just you at home and\n\n557\n00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.890\npeople send you pictures of\nthe grandkids or something like that.\n\n558\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.780\nIt doesn't hurt to have your\nown antivirus to scan it, but\n\n559\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.800\nthen to get a second opinion.\n\n560\n00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.710\nAnd sites like virustotal.com or\nhousecall.antivirus.com,\n\n561\n00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:04.060\nbecause sites allows you to do scans\nthat gives that second opinion.\n\n562\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.760\nI'm a big fun of VirusTotal myself\njust because it uses so many engines.\n\n563\n00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.700\nAnd when something like ClamAV,\n\n564\n00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:15.200\nthat's a big name,\nit didn't pick up the virus in this file.\n\n565\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.160\nAnd I'm using a well known\nransomware the ClamAV should pick,\n\n566\n00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.090\nbut it didn't pick it up.\n\n567\n00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:25.090\nSo these guys,\nit's not that they're necessarily bad,\n\n568\n00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:30.240\njust in this scenario they weren't\nable to detect that type of exploit.\n\n569\n00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.050\nSo, definitely leverage\nsoftware like this or\n\n570\n00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.760\nsites like this to get\nthat second opinion.\n\n571\n00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.785\nThat's how you're going to be protected.\n\n572\n00:26:36.785 --> 00:26:40.446\nThe easiest way to be protected is\njust not to open these files at all.\n\n573\n00:26:40.446 --> 00:26:42.889\nSomebody sends you an attachment,\nyou just don't open it, right.\n\n574\n00:26:42.889 --> 00:26:47.513\nBut if it's your job, if I have to look at\nthat resume, here's my chance, I can run\n\n575\n00:26:47.513 --> 00:26:51.830\nit to this site and now I get, 63\ndifferent engines, that all looked at it.\n\n576\n00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.400\nI didn't have to pay for\nany of them, right,\n\n577\n00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.410\nbecause I'm taking advantage of everyone.\n\n578\n00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.910\nYou might be wondering,\nhow does Google benefit from this.\n\n579\n00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.620\nWell, they have Gmail,\nthey have Google Drive,\n\n580\n00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.612\nthey have all these other,\nthe Google Suites,\n\n581\n00:27:03.612 --> 00:27:07.970\nwith their Google Docs solution,\nwhere they're looking for viruses in that.\n\n582\n00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.410\nAnd if I submit to them a new virus and\n\n583\n00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.780\nthey find it, that helps them to become\nstronger, so that's how they benefit.\n\n584\n00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.530\nSo it's a win, win for everybody and\n\n585\n00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.870\nthat's really why these solutions\nhave kind of come about.\n\n586\n00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.337\nBut that's the best way to\nprotect yourself from Ransomware,\n\n587\n00:27:21.337 --> 00:27:22.690\nis run against this.\n\n588\n00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:26.230\nThe other side is keep your\nsystems up to date ,your IT\n\n589\n00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.320\ndepartment should be maintaining\nsecurity updates on your system.\n\n590\n00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.064\nSo you ever notice like when you go\nto shut down Windows and it says,\n\n591\n00:27:32.064 --> 00:27:33.199\nwe gotta install updates.\n\n592\n00:27:33.199 --> 00:27:36.352\nOr you come in, in the morning, and your\nsystems rebooted over night because it\n\n593\n00:27:36.352 --> 00:27:39.230\ninstalled updates, and\nit's kind of annoying, right?\n\n594\n00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.070\nBut the next time it happens,\ndon't get annoyed, think I'm so\n\n595\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.630\nglad that my system is up\nto date because that means\n\n596\n00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.370\nall these ransomware products that are out\nthere are now protected from them.\n\n597\n00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.130\nIf you're not updating, you're vulnerable\nright, you need to be up to date.\n\n598\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.060\nSo make sure your system stays up to date.\n\n599\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.740\nAnd make sure you always get a second\nopinion before opening a file attachment\n\n600\n00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.280\neven from people you trust.\n\n601\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.550\nYou'll be glad that you did.\n\n602\n00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don you've done\na great job of giving us night sweats and\n\n603\n00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:09.810\nterrors yet again about the craziness\nthat is out there on the world wide web.\n\n604\n00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.300\nBut you have also given us a bastion\nof hope that there´s ways to avoid this\n\n605\n00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:18.982\npitfalls, and things that we can do\nas en -users to keep out those weeds.\n\n606\n00:28:18.982 --> 00:28:21.650\nDon, as I always like to at the end\nof the show, make sure there's\n\n607\n00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.460\nanything that you want to add on top,\nthe cherry on the cake, as it were?\n\n608\n00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.000\n&gt;&gt; If your machine does get compromised,\nit's embarrassing, right,\n\n609\n00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.520\na lot of people don't wanna report it.\n\n610\n00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.030\nBut time is of the essence,\n\n611\n00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.380\nyou wanna report it as quickly as you can,\nall right.\n\n612\n00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.570\nReport it to the IT\ndepartment because one,\n\n613\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.980\nthey can help find out what\nyour options are for restoring.\n\n614\n00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.910\nMaybe they have a backup,\nmaybe they can get your data back.\n\n615\n00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:47.400\nBut two, they can ensure that your\nmachine doesn't infect other people.\n\n616\n00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.150\nThey can stop it from spreading.\n\n617\n00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.340\nAnd the trick to stopping a spread is\nto know about it very, very early.\n\n618\n00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.345\nIt's the same as like CDC's protocols for\ninfectious disease.\n\n619\n00:28:55.345 --> 00:28:58.681\nThese viruses work the same\nway,Ransomware works the same way.\n\n620\n00:28:58.681 --> 00:29:01.994\nIt spreads across the computers,\nso the sooner the IT department is\n\n621\n00:29:01.994 --> 00:29:05.439\naware the better response they can\ncome to protect the other systems.\n\n622\n00:29:05.439 --> 00:29:13.000\nSo set aside any kind of bravado or\nwhatever that you might have.\n\n623\n00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:13.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n624\n00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.162\njust make sure you report it as quickly\nas you can so they can take that action.\n\n625\n00:29:17.162 --> 00:29:19.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Don, thanks so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n626\n00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.620\nThanks so much for walking us down\nthe road of malicious software so\n\n627\n00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.400\nwe can understand what it looks like,\nhow we get affected by it,\n\n628\n00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.790\nhow we might avoid it, which is\nthe most important portion of this.\n\n629\n00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.480\nAnd it was really well Don,\nwe appreciate your time.\n\n630\n00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.460\nWe do appreciate you out\nthere watching as well.\n\n631\n00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.330\nHopefully, this has been very\ninformational for you, very helpful for\n\n632\n00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.730\nyou, and maybe even a little fun.\n\n633\n00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.650\n[LAUGH] But it does look like it\nis that time for us to sign off.\n\n634\n00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:44.000\nThanks again, for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n635\n00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.040\n&gt;&gt;
