You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.411\n&gt;&gt; All right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening, and\n\n7\n00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:18.133\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.457\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\n\n9\n00:00:19.457 --> 00:00:22.945\nhere again with another episode of\nsecurity awareness training, right?\n\n10\n00:00:22.945 --> 00:00:24.970\nWe wanna make sure\neverybody is prepared and\n\n11\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.597\nunderstands their responsibility of\nproviding good IT security practices.\n\n12\n00:00:28.597 --> 00:00:30.169\nThat's what we're gonna take a look at.\n\n13\n00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.121\nAnd here in the studio to help me is Mr.\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n14\n00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:34.391\nDaniel, thanks for joining us.\n\n15\n00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:35.955\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for\nhaving me, Mr. Pezet.\n\n16\n00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:39.779\nI'm glad to be over here in this driver's\nseat to teach you guys a little bit about\n\n17\n00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:41.251\nsome end user security today.\n\n18\n00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:45.993\nAnd today we're specifically\ngoing to talk about passwords.\n\n19\n00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:49.910\nYes, I know, you're probably going,\nnot this, not passwords, I hate passwords,\n\n20\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.492\nthey're the bane of my existence.\n\n21\n00:00:51.492 --> 00:00:54.948\nAnd yes, I have heard that many, many\ntimes from many, many users because we\n\n22\n00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:58.150\nunderstand that there are logins for\njust about everything nowadays.\n\n23\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.000\nAnd you have to create a secure\npassword and I can never remember it.\n\n24\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.680\nAnd what's a good password?\n\n25\n00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.129\nI'll just use my mom's maiden name and\nthat'll be great and\n\n26\n00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.146\nwe're off to the races.\n\n27\n00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:10.580\nSo we need to talk today about\nwhat does make up a good password.\n\n28\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.475\nSomething that you can use that will\nbe easy for you to remember and\n\n29\n00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.220\nwork with, and\nmaybe even work across the board.\n\n30\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.490\nIt will work with this sign\non as well as this sign on.\n\n31\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.790\nI know that a lot of different vendors\nwill give you a lot of different criteria\n\n32\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.280\nfor passwords, so we're gonna\ntalk about that subject as well.\n\n33\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.162\nBut we're just gonna start\noff with the basics.\n\n34\n00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:33.452\nI like to call it, Don,\nthe good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n35\n00:01:33.452 --> 00:01:35.546\nAnd unfortunately,\nwe're not going to start with the good.\n\n36\n00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:38.008\nWe're gonna start with the bad and\nthen we're going to move to the ugly.\n\n37\n00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:39.530\nAnd then we'll get to the good.\n\n38\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.569\nBecause we have to understand what a bad\npassword is first before we can understand\n\n39\n00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.217\nwhat a good password looks like.\n\n40\n00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:46.577\nSo that's where we're\ngoing to start today.\n\n41\n00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:49.957\n&gt;&gt; Now, Daniel, you mentioned like\npeople dread learning about passwords.\n\n42\n00:01:49.957 --> 00:01:52.659\nWhat's such a big deal about passwords?\n\n43\n00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.831\n&gt;&gt; The big deal is,\nis that typically in my experience,\n\n44\n00:01:55.831 --> 00:02:00.482\na lot of people hate having to come up\nwith something that meets the criteria for\n\n45\n00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:03.601\ntheir environment,\ntheir organization, right?\n\n46\n00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.729\nThey've said,\nit's gotta be x amount of characters long.\n\n47\n00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.009\nYou've gotta add this.\n\n48\n00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.049\nIt's gotta have a number.\n\n49\n00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:08.919\nIt's gotta have that.\n\n50\n00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:09.994\nIt's gotta have this.\n\n51\n00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:13.578\nAnd coming up with that can be an area\nof consternation for a lot of people.\n\n52\n00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:17.114\nAnd then, after x amount of days,\n40, 50 days.\n\n53\n00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:18.186\nMaybe 30 days.\n\n54\n00:02:18.186 --> 00:02:20.460\nThey tell you you gotta do\nit all over again, right?\n\n55\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.229\nSo this can be the hair pulling,\nthe teeth biting or\n\n56\n00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.130\nthe nail biting of passwords, right?\n\n57\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.024\nSo we're gonna try to help you be able to,\nevery time you need to create a password\n\n58\n00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:34.862\nor update a password, create something\nthat's gonna work for you and be easy to\n\n59\n00:02:34.862 --> 00:02:38.610\nremember and work with, as well as meet\nthe criteria for your organization.\n\n60\n00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.575\n&gt;&gt; And I understand that.\n\n61\n00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:42.682\nIf I gotta meet these criteria,\nit's gonna be a pain.\n\n62\n00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:45.245\nSo if the companies know that\nI'm not gonna like that,\n\n63\n00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:46.870\nwhy do they make us do that anyway?\n\n64\n00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n65\n00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.566\nThe answer to that is security, right?\n\n66\n00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.894\nPeople are actively trying to get at data.\n\n67\n00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:56.532\nThese are the hackers,\nthe bad actors, the threat actors,\n\n68\n00:02:56.532 --> 00:02:58.872\nwhatever you want to call\nthem in the security world.\n\n69\n00:02:58.872 --> 00:03:01.432\nBasically the bad guys out there that go,\nyou know what?\n\n70\n00:03:01.432 --> 00:03:03.538\nIt'd be nice to have\nDon Pezet's user name and\n\n71\n00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:05.436\npassword to gain access into the system.\n\n72\n00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:10.338\nAnd if I get access to the system, maybe\nI can find something interesting that'd\n\n73\n00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:13.260\nbe worth either money to me or prestige.\n\n74\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.800\nSo this is the whole purpose\nof keeping that data secure.\n\n75\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.820\nWe have information inside of, regardless\nof what organization you work for,\n\n76\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.440\nthere is information in there\nthat could be valuable or\n\n77\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.730\npotentially dangerous in the hands of\nsome threat out there, some bad guy.\n\n78\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.510\nSo we wanna keep those out of their hands\nand passwords are typically that first\n\n79\n00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.552\nguard, that first gate that we run\ninto as gaining access into a system.\n\n80\n00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:39.280\nSo if they can get past that,\n\n81\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.920\nthey at least have some form of\naccess if not quite a bit of access.\n\n82\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.350\nSo we have to keep our passwords secure,\nand\n\n83\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.430\nwe have to keep them out of\nthe hands of those bad guys.\n\n84\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.100\nSo doing that means coming\nup with strong passwords.\n\n85\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.267\nYou have to worry about crackers, and\n\n86\n00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:58.871\nthat is basically like trying to work your\nway through a set of predefined words or\n\n87\n00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:03.152\npasswords that they have lists of that\nmight give you access to the system.\n\n88\n00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:06.126\nOr just what we call a brute\nforce where they just okay,\n\n89\n00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:08.721\nstart with 0, okay, 0 didn't work, 00.\n\n90\n00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:12.231\nOkay, 000 and then just go through,\nand computers do this,\n\n91\n00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:13.729\nwe don't do this, right?\n\n92\n00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:14.753\nI mean, you could.\n\n93\n00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.940\nIt wouldn't be a whole lot of fun for\nthe bad guy out there, but\n\n94\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.925\nthere are tools that they have at their\nready that will allow them to basically\n\n95\n00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:26.120\nhammer at the door and hopefully find\na weak password that allows them entrance.\n\n96\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.430\nSo this is what we have to worry about.\n\n97\n00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.194\nThis is why we need to work with\npasswords to make them secure.\n\n98\n00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:32.486\n&gt;&gt; Now, I know like physical safes.\n\n99\n00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:37.890\nLike a combination has three numbers And\nif it's one through fifty, that's a lot.\n\n100\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.410\nBut in theory, a human with enough time\non their hands could sit there and\n\n101\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.400\nturn that dial and eventually hit\nthe right number to open the safe.\n\n102\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.130\nIt's the same with passwords, right?\n\n103\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.980\nBut you said computers do it\nbecause the longer a password is,\n\n104\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.350\nthe harder it would be to to guess, right?\n\n105\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.310\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n106\n00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.750\nDon hit the nail on the head.\n\n107\n00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.826\nIf the password is short enough, a human\ncould potentially just sit there and\n\n108\n00:04:57.826 --> 00:05:02.418\nguess over and over and over again, and it\nprobably wouldn't take them too much time.\n\n109\n00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:04.152\nSo obviously a three digit password,\n\n110\n00:05:04.152 --> 00:05:06.546\nthat's not gonna take you\nmuch time to get through.\n\n111\n00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:09.764\nI think I actually did the, all the four\ndigit codes on my TV remote one time.\n\n112\n00:05:09.764 --> 00:05:13.172\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It took me about an hour to figure all\n\n113\n00:05:13.172 --> 00:05:18.210\nthe codes that actually worked,\nall right, and especially from IT.\n\n114\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.500\nSo I was able to do that in one hour and\na four digit code.\n\n115\n00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.550\nThat was a human pushing\nbuttons physically.\n\n116\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.950\nImagine what your computer can do and\nthe power and the processor behind it.\n\n117\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.966\nSo they have very,\nvery strong password crackers out there.\n\n118\n00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:33.796\nSo we have to make sure that these\npasswords are nice and strong.\n\n119\n00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:34.996\nNow we don't wanna go too crazy though.\n\n120\n00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:36.052\nright?\n\n121\n00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:37.220\nCuz I could have a 100 character password.\n\n122\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.772\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'd be super secure, right?\n\n123\n00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:40.548\nSo what's the kind of recommendation?\n\n124\n00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:41.474\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n125\n00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:42.518\nThat's a great question.\n\n126\n00:05:42.518 --> 00:05:43.558\nLet's go ahead and jump on my computer.\n\n127\n00:05:43.558 --> 00:05:45.288\nLet's look at the bad and the ugly, right?\n\n128\n00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:49.918\nSo here I've got a couple of examples of\ndifferent types of passwords you could run\n\n129\n00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:52.278\nin both links and complexities, right?\n\n130\n00:05:52.278 --> 00:05:56.899\nSo you have a seven character\npassword with one upper case letter,\n\n131\n00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.798\ntwo digits, and one special character.\n\n132\n00:05:59.798 --> 00:06:03.250\nThat's an exclamation point,\na hash tag, something like that.\n\n133\n00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.480\nSo usually, you have to hit the Shift\nto get one of these things.\n\n134\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.850\nRunning that through\nan average password cracker,\n\n135\n00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.152\nyou're gonna crack the password at\n0.24 minutes, that is not very long.\n\n136\n00:06:14.152 --> 00:06:15.816\nSo that is not a good password.\n\n137\n00:06:15.816 --> 00:06:21.080\nBut as Don suggested, the longer we make\nthat password, the more secure it becomes.\n\n138\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.098\nAnd you see that with an eight character\npassword with one upper character,\n\n139\n00:06:25.098 --> 00:06:27.816\ntwo digits, and\nit's basically the same format.\n\n140\n00:06:27.816 --> 00:06:29.318\nWe're just adding length to it.\n\n141\n00:06:29.318 --> 00:06:33.030\nThat jumps to 1.11 hours.\n\n142\n00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.320\nAll right, well,\nthat seems like a whole lot better.\n\n143\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.245\nExcept, then an hour's not very long\nin the grand scheme of things, so\n\n144\n00:06:40.245 --> 00:06:42.554\nthat's really not enough time.\n\n145\n00:06:42.554 --> 00:06:48.220\nAnd then if you move to a 10 character\npassword, same criteria, 31.17 days.\n\n146\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.676\nNow that sounds strong.\n\n147\n00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:51.484\nThat sounds like we\nare actually getting somewhere.\n\n148\n00:06:51.484 --> 00:06:52.314\nAnd you know what?\n\n149\n00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:53.436\nIt might be strong enough.\n\n150\n00:06:53.436 --> 00:06:57.566\nThat might be a strong enough password\ndepending on your environment.\n\n151\n00:06:57.566 --> 00:06:59.276\n&gt;&gt; I think I see a pattern here.\n\n152\n00:06:59.276 --> 00:07:00.781\nSo when my company asks me, and says,\n\n153\n00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:03.004\nDon, you need to change your\npassword every 30 days.\n\n154\n00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:03.964\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n155\n00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:05.706\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say, that's dumb.\n\n156\n00:07:05.706 --> 00:07:07.258\nI don't want to change\nmy password every month.\n\n157\n00:07:07.258 --> 00:07:09.882\nBut, if it takes 31.17 days, right?\n\n158\n00:07:09.882 --> 00:07:13.588\nAnd somebody starts to try to break my\npassword, well, within 31.17 days I'll\n\n159\n00:07:13.588 --> 00:07:16.634\nchange my password to something new so\nthat that protects me, right?\n\n160\n00:07:16.634 --> 00:07:19.030\nIs that the reasoning\nbehind password changes?\n\n161\n00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.800\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly right, so\nwhen your company says, hey,\n\n162\n00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.940\nwe need you to update your password.\n\n163\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.400\nYou get a prompt on your computer\nscreen that says update your password.\n\n164\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.610\nIt's that time.\n\n165\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.780\nPlease enter a new password.\n\n166\n00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.300\nYes, I know, it's a headache.\n\n167\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.388\nYou gotta come up with something new.\n\n168\n00:07:30.388 --> 00:07:31.956\nWe'll broach that in just a minute.\n\n169\n00:07:31.956 --> 00:07:36.838\nBut this is the reason why, because these\nmodern password crackers are very fast,\n\n170\n00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:39.780\nthey're very efficient,\nand within 31 days.\n\n171\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.284\nSo if we set the threshold for 30 days,\nwell, you should be pretty safe.\n\n172\n00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:46.816\nAnd obviously the longer you go,\nthe better that's going to be and\n\n173\n00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:50.598\nthen maybe we can bother you less\nif we make the 11 characters, well,\n\n174\n00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:52.697\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n175\n00:07:52.697 --> 00:07:55.277\nIf we make that the standard,\nit's gonna make it a whole lot harder for\n\n176\n00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:56.655\nthose password crackers to nail it.\n\n177\n00:07:56.655 --> 00:07:58.048\nAlright, now let´s talk about the ugly,\nright.\n\n178\n00:07:58.048 --> 00:08:01.690\nThat's the bad, these are bad passwords,\nten characters,\n\n179\n00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.972\nit´s skirting the line, it could be good,\nbut it might be bad, right.\n\n180\n00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:10.280\nThe ugly, just like what we got up here,\nwe got default passwords.\n\n181\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.185\nSo if you are asked to install something,\nand it´s got a username and\n\n182\n00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:18.711\npassword field that you log into it,\nmaybe some new software on your computer.\n\n183\n00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:21.441\nDo not stick with the default\nthat it comes with,\n\n184\n00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:23.383\nyou need to change that password.\n\n185\n00:08:23.383 --> 00:08:27.368\nAnybody can go to Google type in\ndefault password for x software,\n\n186\n00:08:27.368 --> 00:08:32.720\ndefault password for this router,\ndefault password for this access point.\n\n187\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.580\nAnd if you have left it the default, well\nyou basically just said, I'm gonna hang\n\n188\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.060\nthe key outside of the door, and\nanybody that wants to come in come on in.\n\n189\n00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.155\nSo that's not a good idea,\nchange default passwords.\n\n190\n00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:47.881\nThat's why I call it the ugly, because\nyou've done nothing to secure that system,\n\n191\n00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:50.493\nand you basically ask\npeople to enter into it.\n\n192\n00:08:50.493 --> 00:08:55.140\nAnd then we have words associated\nwith your person and or organization.\n\n193\n00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.714\nSo this is kind of diving into what makes\na good password, obviously this does not.\n\n194\n00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:05.021\nWe don't wanna use organizational\nterms if, we're here at ITProTV,\n\n195\n00:09:05.021 --> 00:09:07.553\nI don't wanna make my password ITProTV.\n\n196\n00:09:07.553 --> 00:09:10.093\nI don't wanna make it shows rock.\n\n197\n00:09:10.093 --> 00:09:10.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n198\n00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:16.020\nanything that has to do with what I do for\nthe company, or what the company does.\n\n199\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean you could even think of\nlike geographic things that change this,\n\n200\n00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.340\nand we're in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n201\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.986\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which is the home of the University\n\n202\n00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:23.487\nof Florida, and the Florida Gaters.\n\n203\n00:09:23.487 --> 00:09:27.863\nAnd so I can guarantee probably a third of\nthe population of this city has the word\n\n204\n00:09:27.863 --> 00:09:32.523\ngaters in their password, and it sounds\nlike an exaggeration but sadly it's true.\n\n205\n00:09:32.523 --> 00:09:35.599\nI've worked at an organization where\nI saw this, Daniel you did too,\n\n206\n00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:38.941\nwhere there were tons of employees that\nwould just use various combinations\n\n207\n00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:40.940\nof the word gaters in their password.\n\n208\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.580\nAnd so\nif you knew that somebody was from here,\n\n209\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.280\nthat kinda would be your starting point,\nand shrink the amount of passwords you had\n\n210\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.550\nto try before you could guess\nsomebody's password and get in.\n\n211\n00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.810\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's exactly right.\n\n212\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.714\nSo your IT people might make\nthat part of the policy,\n\n213\n00:09:52.714 --> 00:09:56.611\nwhere you can't use specific words\nbecause they realize that right,\n\n214\n00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:59.602\nthey're trying help you out,\nmake a good password.\n\n215\n00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:01.913\nAnd that can lend to\nsome of that frustration,\n\n216\n00:10:01.913 --> 00:10:04.354\nyou're like I just want to use gators123.\n\n217\n00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:07.993\nYeah, that's easy to remember,\nbut length is not great, and\n\n218\n00:10:07.993 --> 00:10:11.645\nit is too close to something that\nsomebody could easily guess.\n\n219\n00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:17.040\nWe wanna keep that guessing ability out of\nthe picture as much as humanly possible.\n\n220\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.621\nSo those are the bad and the ugly,\nlet's finally jump into the good.\n\n221\n00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:26.272\nOkay, well we've seen bad stuff,\nwhat does a good password look like?\n\n222\n00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:29.112\nWell, let's take a look,\nif you jump to my screen you'll see here\n\n223\n00:10:29.112 --> 00:10:31.360\npasswords that aren't easily guessed or\ncracked.\n\n224\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.428\nThat's basically what it comes down,\nthe opposite of what we just saw.\n\n225\n00:10:34.428 --> 00:10:35.477\nI know that seems a little facetious, but.\n\n226\n00:10:35.477 --> 00:10:36.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like to a have\n\n227\n00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.122\na little fun with the word play.\n\n228\n00:10:38.122 --> 00:10:41.755\nSo I did jump up to that 11 character\npassword, with one uppercase,\n\n229\n00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:44.234\ntwo digits and\none special character, right.\n\n230\n00:10:44.234 --> 00:10:48.926\nAnd you'll notice that the amount of time\nthat it takes to crack that password went\n\n231\n00:10:48.926 --> 00:10:51.488\nfrom, how long was it, we had-\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah where I usually saw it was,\nlet's say you had a 30 day password change\n\n251\n00:11:47.745 --> 00:11:50.419\nwindow, so every 30 days people\nhad to change the password.\n\n252\n00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:54.431\nThey would change it, and the next day\nsupport tickets would always go up,\n\n253\n00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:58.210\nbecause people would forget their\npassword the very next day.\n\n254\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.327\nAfter they had used it for a week of two\nthey'd kind of commit it to memory and\n\n255\n00:12:01.327 --> 00:12:02.230\nnow they've got it.\n\n256\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.169\nBut if they don't have\nsome kind of mnemonic,\n\n257\n00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:07.350\nsome kind of way to remember what that\npassword is, it's easy to forget it,\n\n258\n00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.555\nespecially on the first day, which means\nyou end up have to change it again.\n\n259\n00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:13.573\nAnd you kinda repeat the cycle,\npeople get really frustrated with that.\n\n260\n00:12:13.573 --> 00:12:16.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's totally\nunderstandable, I get that myself.\n\n261\n00:12:16.827 --> 00:12:20.988\nI have been just as frustrated as anybody\nout there about having to come up with\n\n262\n00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:21.960\npasswords.\n\n263\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.730\nAnd especially, like I've talked\nabout before where you have\n\n264\n00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.910\nmultiple different vectors\nof authentication.\n\n265\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.759\nI've got this website that I log into,\nwhich we do business with, it's not our\n\n266\n00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:35.397\nsystem, but I have to log into it\nbecause we do business with them, right.\n\n267\n00:12:35.397 --> 00:12:39.710\nTheir login credential, their\nrequirements aren't the same as ours.\n\n268\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.681\nSo I have to come up with something for\nthem, then I have to come,\n\n269\n00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:46.423\nand then the times that they change their\npasswords are different than ours, and\n\n270\n00:12:46.423 --> 00:12:49.470\nnow I'm constantly changing and\ntrying to remember passwords.\n\n271\n00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.800\nSo that's where we come in,\nhow do we make a good password?\n\n272\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.100\nA, length, length is great, we want to\nmake them all as long as we can remember.\n\n273\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.420\nBut how do we remember that long password,\nright.\n\n274\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.470\nThat's the rub.\n\n275\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.035\nWhat do we do?\n\n276\n00:13:04.035 --> 00:13:07.260\nWell we use phrases instead of words.\n\n277\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.400\nWords can be easily forgotten, or they're\ntoo short, that's typically the problem,\n\n278\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.506\nthey're just too short.\n\n279\n00:13:12.506 --> 00:13:16.390\nSo what we do, we make a phrase,\nsomething that I can easily remember.\n\n280\n00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.090\nI don't know about you Don, but I can\nremember the preamble to the Constitution,\n\n281\n00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.290\nwe the people of the United States,\nright, and so on and so forth.\n\n282\n00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.400\nThat's something that we learned,\nthat's buried into our brains.\n\n283\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.130\nMaybe the Pledge of Allegiance,\nsomething you do on regular basis.\n\n284\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.849\nThe opening to Star Trek or.\n\n285\n00:13:30.849 --> 00:13:33.860\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You've got the exclamation point there.\n\n335\n00:16:28.067 --> 00:16:30.302\nYou could go ahead and\nput the spaces between the words, right?\n\n336\n00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:30.975\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n337\n00:16:30.975 --> 00:16:33.102\n&gt;&gt; And if you did that here,\nwhat we looking at, what, six more spaces?\n\n338\n00:16:33.102 --> 00:16:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n339\n00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.342\n&gt;&gt; That means your password\nwould be that much stronger.\n\n340\n00:16:36.342 --> 00:16:39.120\nI mean, you could really crank this one up\nwithout having to jump through a bunch of\n\n341\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.423\nextra hoops to be able to remember it.\n\n342\n00:16:40.423 --> 00:16:44.961\nSo the key secret here is using\na pass phrase, not a password.\n\n343\n00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:46.685\n&gt;&gt;

I think this says something\nabout your personal character.\n\n360\n00:17:32.896 --> 00:17:35.367\nI think we might need\nto look into this one.\n\n361\n00:17:35.367 --> 00:17:35.867\n&gt;&gt; Don't judge me.\n&gt;&gt;

And speaking of the time on these.\n\n384\n00:18:40.478 --> 00:18:41.835\nWe might look at it and say,\n\n385\n00:18:41.835 --> 00:18:44.939\n10 million years, that's forever, right?\nBut each year,\n\n386\n00:18:44.939 --> 00:18:48.564\ncomputers get faster and faster.\nAnd that means the people that are running\n\n387\n00:18:48.564 --> 00:18:52.738\npassword cracking utilities or the brute\nforcing utilities, they get faster and\n\n388\n00:18:52.738 --> 00:18:55.235\nfaster.\nSo today, it might be 10 million years.\n\n389\n00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:57.126\nBut a year from now it might only be one\n\n390\n00:18:57.126 --> 00:18:59.011\nmillion.\nAnd then it keeps going down, and down,\n\n391\n00:18:59.011 --> 00:18:59.820\nand down.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n392\n00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.108\n&gt;&gt; So as the years go by,\n\n393\n00:19:01.108 --> 00:19:05.205\npasswords get increasingly weaker.\nBut the reality is that the biggest\n\n394\n00:19:05.205 --> 00:19:09.486\nweakness of a password is not so much the\nbrute force side of it, it's ourselves,\n\n395\n00:19:09.486 --> 00:19:12.198\nright, Daniel?\nLike we can weaken password security\n\n396\n00:19:12.198 --> 00:19:15.218\npretty easily.\n&gt;&gt; Man, there is apparently no patch for\n\n397\n00:19:15.218 --> 00:19:18.441\nour humanity.\nAnd that is that if Don and I were working\n\n398\n00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:22.382\ntogether, this is a prime example.\nDon is hitting the nail right on the head,\n\n399\n00:19:22.382 --> 00:19:24.399\nagain, that we tend to\ngive our passwords out.\n\n400\n00:19:24.399 --> 00:19:27.180\nThis is a bad practice, this is a no.\n\n401\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.545\nWarning, warning, warning, Will Robinson,\n\n402\n00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:32.077\ndo not do this.\nDo not give out your password.\n\n403\n00:19:32.077 --> 00:19:33.793\nNo administrator is going to call,\n\n404\n00:19:33.793 --> 00:19:37.700\nworth their salt, and say, I need your\npassword to log into such and such.\n\n405\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.577\nHe's an admin, he has rights to every\nsystem that you have in your company,\n\n406\n00:19:41.577 --> 00:19:43.830\nyour organization, wherever you're at.\n\n407\n00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.748\nAnd he doesn't need yours.\n\n408\n00:19:44.748 --> 00:19:48.885\nAnd in fact, I could change your\npassword and log in as you, if I felt so\n\n409\n00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:51.040\ninclined, as an administrator.\n\n410\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.020\nI can't think of many reasons\nwhy that would come about.\n\n411\n00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.180\nBut almost invariably, if not invariably,\nthey will not ask for your password.\n\n412\n00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.276\nThey won't have you write it down and\ngive it to them.\n\n413\n00:20:02.276 --> 00:20:05.790\nSo you don't need to give\nyour password out to anyone.\n\n414\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:12.431\n&gt;&gt; And going even a step further, let's\nsay I give mine to an IT rep that calls.\n\n415\n00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:15.128\nOr even a family member, or\na co-worker, or whatever.\n\n416\n00:20:15.128 --> 00:20:19.464\nAnd so I give it to her, and\nit's the Little Miss Muffet 001.\n\n417\n00:20:19.464 --> 00:20:21.986\nAnd I think to myself, well,\nwhen she's done with it,\n\n418\n00:20:21.986 --> 00:20:24.146\nI'll just change it to make it 002, right?\n\n419\n00:20:24.146 --> 00:20:26.225\nBut now she knows the pattern.\n\n420\n00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:31.048\nShe sees like, Don uses Little Miss Muffet\n001, I bet he's going 002.\n\n421\n00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:32.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever, it, again,\n\n422\n00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.198\nminimizes the guessing pool she had to\ngo through to figure out that password.\n\n423\n00:20:36.198 --> 00:20:39.001\nSo you gotta keep that in\nmind with these passwords.\n\n424\n00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:40.704\nThat they're designed to be just for you.\n\n425\n00:20:40.704 --> 00:20:45.306\nAnd if you do give it to somebody else for\nsome particular reason.\n\n426\n00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:46.044\nHopefully, that doesn't happen,\nbut if you do.\n\n427\n00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:48.623\nYou not only need to change\nyour password afterwards,\n\n428\n00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:51.382\nyou need to change it to\nsomething completely different.\n\n429\n00:20:51.382 --> 00:20:55.237\nBecause otherwise, you've already weakened\nthe integrity by giving out a part of it.\n\n430\n00:20:55.237 --> 00:20:58.049\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you set a precedence of,\nwell, they use nursery rhymes.\n\n431\n00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:00.936\nMaybe I'll just go through\na book of nursery rhymes and\n\n432\n00:21:00.936 --> 00:21:02.710\ntry the same thing until I hit it.\n\n433\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.009\nMaybe I can create a computer\nprogram that does that for me.\n\n434\n00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:07.585\nHint, hint, that exists, okay?\n\n435\n00:21:07.585 --> 00:21:08.134\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n436\n00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:11.880\nwe don't want to be giving our passwords,\ndon't share them with anyone.\n\n437\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.122\nAlso, this has been a common practice for\nquite some time.\n\n438\n00:21:14.122 --> 00:21:17.612\nEven though it's become a bit of\na joke inside of the IT industry,\n\n439\n00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:19.967\nis that people write their passwords down.\n\n440\n00:21:19.967 --> 00:21:22.131\nAnd what do they do with it?\n\n441\n00:21:22.131 --> 00:21:24.455\nThey put it on a sticky note,\nand they put it on their monitor.\n\n442\n00:21:24.455 --> 00:21:27.111\nIf they think they're really slick,\nthey stick it underneath their keyboard.\n\n443\n00:21:27.111 --> 00:21:30.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they just, flip it up,\n\n444\n00:21:30.082 --> 00:21:31.764\nthere's my password.\n\n445\n00:21:31.764 --> 00:21:34.130\nNow you might be going, I do that,\nwell, a lot of people do.\n\n446\n00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.961\nSo we wanna get you away\nfrom that practice.\n\n447\n00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:38.950\nAnd there's a good reason for\nthat, obviously.\n\n448\n00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.380\nThen we could just look up and\ncheck it out.\n\n449\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.169\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Daniel and I,\n\n450\n00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.060\nwe used to work together at\nan insurance company years ago.\n\n451\n00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.706\nAnd you'd go in the field\nto some of the offices.\n\n452\n00:21:46.706 --> 00:21:49.547\nAnd if the person wasn't there\nwho was working on the computer,\n\n453\n00:21:49.547 --> 00:21:52.027\nit was just our general practice to say,\nyou know what?\n\n454\n00:21:52.027 --> 00:21:53.022\nLet me look under the keyboard.\n\n455\n00:21:53.022 --> 00:21:54.950\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Or let me ask their secretary,\n\n456\n00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.500\nlet me check some of the other employees.\n\n457\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.736\nSomebody'll know the password if\nit's not stuck on the monitor.\n\n458\n00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:04.336\nAnd we joke about it, but it was so\ncommon you could almost count on it!\n\n459\n00:22:04.336 --> 00:22:06.787\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That everybody in the office knew their\n\n460\n00:22:06.787 --> 00:22:11.525\npassword, or it was written somewhere\neasy to find, it was almost comical.\n\n461\n00:22:11.525 --> 00:22:16.022\nAnd the thing here is you may not mind if\nyou share your password with a coworker.\n\n462\n00:22:16.022 --> 00:22:17.062\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n463\n00:22:17.062 --> 00:22:19.306\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's a part of your normal\nworkflow that you'd do that.\n\n464\n00:22:19.306 --> 00:22:21.550\nBut if it's in an area of open display,\n\n465\n00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.240\nsomebody could be coming in to\nclean the office after hours.\n\n466\n00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.140\nYou could have customers that are in\nthe office that see the password.\n\n467\n00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.531\nAnd now they know it, now it's leaked out.\n\n468\n00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:30.517\nAnd that's why it's so\n\n469\n00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:33.442\nimportant to remember that passwords\nare designed to be kept secret.\n\n470\n00:22:33.442 --> 00:22:36.557\nThat we don't share them, and\nthat we keep them committed to memory.\n\n471\n00:22:36.557 --> 00:22:39.710\nSo like Daniel, your techniques of making\nit easy to remember these passphrases,\n\n472\n00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.163\nthat really helps with that, right?\n\n473\n00:22:41.163 --> 00:22:44.421\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly right, that way\nyou don't need to write them down.\n\n474\n00:22:44.421 --> 00:22:47.106\nIt's something you'll easily remember.\n\n475\n00:22:47.106 --> 00:22:50.356\nAnd therefore,\nit just keeps you out of those weeds,\n\n476\n00:22:50.356 --> 00:22:53.067\nout of putting them on a sticky note.\n\n477\n00:22:53.067 --> 00:22:56.482\nWatch the old 1980-something\nmovie WarGames.\n\n478\n00:22:56.482 --> 00:22:58.477\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As he sits down in his\n\n479\n00:22:58.477 --> 00:23:01.707\nprincipal's office, and\nhe sees the secretary pull a sheet down.\n\n480\n00:23:01.707 --> 00:23:04.220\nAnd there's the passwords, and\nthey're all scratched out.\n\n481\n00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.657\nAnd only the current one is available,\nwe don't wanna get into that business.\n\n482\n00:23:08.657 --> 00:23:11.514\n&gt;&gt; Now back then,\nwe typically only used one system.\n\n483\n00:23:11.514 --> 00:23:14.471\nAnd you'd log into a mainframe,\nyou had this one password.\n\n484\n00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:17.721\nBut in today's world,\nyou've got people that have email.\n\n485\n00:23:17.721 --> 00:23:19.972\nThey have network servers,\nthey have Facebook.\n\n486\n00:23:19.972 --> 00:23:22.271\nThey have all these different accounts.\n\n487\n00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:23.976\nThat is a lot of passwords to remember.\n\n488\n00:23:23.976 --> 00:23:25.969\nSo doesn't that encourage us\nto write them down on paper?\n\n489\n00:23:25.969 --> 00:23:29.624\n&gt;&gt; It does actually,\nDon is very right on this.\n\n490\n00:23:29.624 --> 00:23:32.372\nBecause we have so many different\nplaces that we're logging into,\n\n491\n00:23:32.372 --> 00:23:33.777\nmakes it really difficult for us.\n\n492\n00:23:33.777 --> 00:23:36.861\nEven if we create a really\nstrong password, well,\n\n493\n00:23:36.861 --> 00:23:40.242\nmaybe I can't use that\npassword at this login, right?\n\n494\n00:23:40.242 --> 00:23:43.259\nMaybe I can't use that\npassword over in this login.\n\n495\n00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:46.058\nSo we end up having this\nmultitude of different passwords.\n\n496\n00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:48.412\nNow we have a really good way of creating\nstrong passwords, That we can use, but\n\n497\n00:23:48.412 --> 00:23:50.026\nthey'll still be different.\n\n498\n00:23:50.026 --> 00:23:56.670\nWhich password did I use for this login?\n\n499\n00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:57.190\nI don't remember.\n\n500\n00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.060\nI'll just try them all.\n\n501\n00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.510\nWell maybe you've got seven or eight\ndifferent passwords that you want to rifle\n\n502\n00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.730\nthrough, and\nmaybe that hits a lockout threshold.\n\n503\n00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.200\nYou've tried the login too many times,\nand now your account is locked out.\n\n504\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.960\nAnd that's well,\nman the anxiety starts coming.\n\n505\n00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.580\nI know when I've typed in about three or\nfour passwords, and they are not the right\n\n506\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.390\none I'm starting to go I wonder if I'm\nabout to get locked out of this system.\n\n507\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.330\nAnd you just, you get anxious about it.\n\n508\n00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.460\nYou don't want to do that because then\nyou've got to call the help desk, and\n\n509\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.020\nsay help me unlock this thing.\n\n510\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.450\nSo we have to come up with some\nsystem that will help us with that.\n\n511\n00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.600\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nI know how to solve the problem.\n\n512\n00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.150\nI can come up with one strong password,\nuse that same password everywhere, right?\n\n513\n00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.030\n&gt;&gt; That would be nice, but\nunfortunately that's just not practical.\n\n514\n00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.970\nMaybe that will work,\nyou might be able to get away with that.\n\n515\n00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.179\nI have done a pretty good\njob in my own life of,\n\n516\n00:24:44.179 --> 00:24:47.392\nI think I have three\npasswords that I can use.\n\n517\n00:24:47.392 --> 00:24:49.826\nIf it's not this one, it's this one.\n\n518\n00:24:49.826 --> 00:24:50.902\nIf it's not that one,\nit's this one, right.\n\n519\n00:24:50.902 --> 00:24:55.875\nAnd those have worked just about\nanywhere I want to log in from email to\n\n520\n00:24:55.875 --> 00:25:01.391\nsystems that I work with to creating\nlogins for whatever purposes, right.\n\n521\n00:25:01.391 --> 00:25:04.232\nSo I've kind of boiled\nit down to about three.\n\n522\n00:25:04.232 --> 00:25:07.840\nBut not everyone wants to go\nthrough that kind of headache, so\n\n523\n00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.650\nwe've come up with what's\ncalled password managers.\n\n524\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.720\nAnd these are freely available, and\nmaybe your company will implement them or\n\n525\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.520\nmaybe they have already.\n\n526\n00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.670\nYou just need to be aware of them so\nthat you can use them.\n\n527\n00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of software out\nthere like Last Pass, and Key Pass,\n\n528\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.552\nEnd Pass, pass in the name.\n\n529\n00:25:22.552 --> 00:25:23.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n530\n00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.140\n&gt;&gt; That help you managing passwords and\n\n531\n00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:31.110\nthe key secret that they have is that they\nallow you to use a different password for\n\n532\n00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.970\nevery single system that you touch.\n\n533\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.810\nNormally that would be a nightmare, right?\n\n534\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.890\nAnd if I log into 100 sites,\nI have 100 different passwords,\n\n535\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.240\nthere's no way I can remember that.\n\n536\n00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.500\nI'm gonna write it down.\n\n537\n00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.980\nWell, these programs allow\nus to write it down,\n\n538\n00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.120\nin an encrypted database that\nis protected, that we can call.\n\n539\n00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.860\nAnd it actually improves our security.\n\n540\n00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.399\nBecause when you reuse a password\nin more than one place,\n\n541\n00:25:50.399 --> 00:25:55.045\nyou're trusting that all of those sites\nare securing your data the same way\n\n542\n00:25:55.045 --> 00:25:59.639\nwhen in reality you're gonna get\nthe weakest security out of all of them.\n\n543\n00:25:59.639 --> 00:26:01.391\nSo, your Facebook password\nis probably pretty secure.\n\n544\n00:26:01.391 --> 00:26:04.558\nThey're one of the most\nsecure networks in the world.\n\n545\n00:26:04.558 --> 00:26:07.082\nYour Apple password is pretty secure but\nthen,\n\n546\n00:26:07.082 --> 00:26:11.183\nmaybe you log in to some forum or some\nsites to find out a little information and\n\n547\n00:26:11.183 --> 00:26:13.240\nused the same password there.\n\n548\n00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.920\nAnd their security is not up to snuff.\n\n549\n00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.930\nMaybe their site is run by just one\nperson with a very limited budget.\n\n550\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.940\nAnd if that site ever gets compromised and\nthe one password that you use\n\n551\n00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:26.550\neverywhere just got obtained,\nnow they can log into Apple or\n\n552\n00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.690\nFacebook because they've got the one\npassword you use everywhere.\n\n553\n00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:33.090\nSo, you're better off using a different\npassword everywhere if you can.\n\n554\n00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.860\nBut it's too much for our human\nminds to wrap around, at least for\n\n555\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.535\nmost of us, some of you are savants and\nyou remember these.\n\n556\n00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:41.450\n[LAUGH] And so that's where these\npassword managers come in really handy,\n\n557\n00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:46.600\nis that ability to have a secure\ndatabase of passwords you can call up.\n\n558\n00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.380\nAnd you can use really complex,\n\n559\n00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.100\nreally long passwords that\nyou would never remember.\n\n560\n00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.610\nAnd different ones for every single site,\n\n561\n00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.770\nbut it's okay because it can all be\npulled right from this database.\n\n562\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.760\nSo definitely a technology you'll want to\nlook into if your company already hasn't.\n\n563\n00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don,\nI fully agree with you on that.\n\n564\n00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.540\nWell, around here, we like the LastPass.\n\n565\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.410\nWe work with that.\n\n566\n00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.570\nIt's very simple to install and use, so\n\n567\n00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.920\nthere's no good reason not to go ahead and\nuse something like that.\n\n568\n00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.673\nI love how it can create complex passwords\nfor you and then it stores them.\n\n569\n00:27:14.673 --> 00:27:16.736\nYou don't have to do anything about it.\n\n570\n00:27:16.736 --> 00:27:19.250\nYou just have that one\npassword to log into that.\n\n571\n00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.021\nAnd then Last Pass takes care\nof the rest of it for you.\n\n572\n00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:23.052\nAll right, very good.\n\n573\n00:27:23.052 --> 00:27:24.483\nNow let's talk about some,\njust some best practices.\n\n574\n00:27:24.483 --> 00:27:30.350\nMaybe you're wondering what happens if you\ndo try the wrong password too many times.\n\n575\n00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.878\nOr why is it that it has me\nuse a different password.\n\n576\n00:27:32.878 --> 00:27:36.520\nHow come I can't use the password I\nused last time, things of that nature.\n\n577\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.480\nThese are best practices that maybe you're\nin charge of a system that requires\n\n578\n00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.040\nthat kind of thing to occur, or\n\n579\n00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.040\nyou're just wondering what\nhappens when this does occur.\n\n580\n00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.584\nSo let's just talk about that.\n\n581\n00:27:46.584 --> 00:27:48.437\nReally quickly, we talked about this.\n\n582\n00:27:48.437 --> 00:27:50.320\nhow many attempts do we get.\n\n583\n00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.450\nWell, that varies by organization and it's\njust kind of a feel thing as I've noticed.\n\n584\n00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.570\nMaybe it's six tries and\nthen you get locked out.\n\n585\n00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.470\nMaybe it's ten tries and\nyou get locked out.\n\n586\n00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.522\nBut you do need to come up\nwith some Lockout policy.\n\n587\n00:28:03.522 --> 00:28:07.782\nYou get X amount of tries before\nthe system is locked that user out and\n\n588\n00:28:07.782 --> 00:28:12.043\nthat stops those bad guys out there\nfrom just knocking at the gate and\n\n589\n00:28:12.043 --> 00:28:13.858\ntrying to get into the door.\n\n590\n00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:15.494\nSo, that helps that.\n\n591\n00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:18.359\nIt'll put a pause on that and\nraise a flag up to the people or\n\n592\n00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:21.693\nthe powers that be that are watching\nover these things to say, hum,\n\n593\n00:28:21.693 --> 00:28:24.060\nlooks like we might have\na bad guy going on here.\n\n594\n00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.183\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and on your diagram earlier,\nyou said that if I had a seven\n\n595\n00:28:27.183 --> 00:28:30.685\ncharacter password it could be\nbroken in 0.24 minutes, right?\n\n596\n00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:31.895\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Really, really fast.\n\n597\n00:28:31.895 --> 00:28:36.228\nBut that's assuming that we have unlimited\nguesses and we can just rapidly guess.\n\n598\n00:28:36.228 --> 00:28:40.500\nSo, by having a password lockout, if your\nIT department says you get five tries then\n\n599\n00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.960\nyou're locked and then you have to call\ntech support and get unlocked, right?\n\n600\n00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.490\nThat will make it one attacker\nonly getting five guesses.\n\n601\n00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.770\nWhat are the odds of getting your password\nin only five guesses, extremely low.\n\n602\n00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.371\nSo password lock out policies can be\nannoying especially if you are the one who\n\n603\n00:28:54.371 --> 00:28:55.580\nis locked out and you are in a hurry.\n\n604\n00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.328\nBut they effectively eliminate\nbrute force attacks.\n\n605\n00:28:58.328 --> 00:28:59.123\nSo really useful thing so\ndon't be frustrated If you are locked\n\n606\n00:28:59.123 --> 00:28:59.640\nout because it is a really useful thing.\n\n607\n00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.330\nSo don't be frustrated when you see a lock\nout because it's gonna stop somebody\n\n608\n00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.410\nguessing and all you have to do\nis to call the text support and\n\n609\n00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.610\nsay hey I tried to log in this morning.\n\n610\n00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:08.540\nI got it wrong a few times.\n\n611\n00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.390\nI got locked.\n\n612\n00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.500\nOr you can say, hey,\nI came in this morning and I'm locked out.\n\n613\n00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.120\nI haven't tried to log in at all, and\n\n614\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.350\nthat alerts the IT department\nthat an attack happened.\n\n615\n00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.370\nThey know that something\nincorrect happened.\n\n616\n00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.460\nEither way, your data is protected, so\n\n617\n00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.840\nyou should really be thankful\nwhenever you see that limit.\n\n618\n00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.570\n&gt;&gt; And you have the added benefit of,\n\n619\n00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.980\na lot of times this will occur, that\nyou've got something on your mobile device\n\n620\n00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.020\nthat you log into the system with and\nnow you've updated your password.\n\n621\n00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.600\nWell you forgot to update it on your\nmobile device, so what is it doing?\n\n622\n00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.370\nIt's hammering away and\nhitting that lockout threshold.\n\n623\n00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.980\nThen you have to call the help desk and\n\n624\n00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:44.480\nthey go hum, looks like you might have\na mobile device that needs to be checked.\n\n625\n00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.340\nDid you update your password recently?\n\n626\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.400\nYeah, that's right.\n\n627\n00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.050\nI need to update it on my phone as well.\n\n628\n00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:53.384\nBecause I've had a lot of people go, I\nhaven't been getting email on my phone for\n\n629\n00:29:53.384 --> 00:29:54.544\nthe last three days.\n\n630\n00:29:54.544 --> 00:29:57.526\nWhen was the last time you changed your\npassword? That was like three days ago.\n\n631\n00:29:57.526 --> 00:30:00.588\nAh-ha.\nWell that can really help on that\n\n632\n00:30:00.588 --> 00:30:02.155\nside of things.\n\n633\n00:30:02.155 --> 00:30:04.072\nThe user end spectrum, so\nit's a really good thing.\n\n634\n00:30:04.072 --> 00:30:06.439\n&gt;&gt; And this can vary a bit from\ncompany to company as well, right?\n\n635\n00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:08.026\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I might get locked out and\n\n636\n00:30:08.026 --> 00:30:09.550\nhave to call the support desk.\n\n637\n00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.831\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; In order to get up.\n\n638\n00:30:10.831 --> 00:30:13.760\nOr some places make it a little\nmore automatic, don't they?\n\n639\n00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe they'll have a form that\nyou can go on to the internal site,\n\n640\n00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:20.611\nthe internal website of your company, and\nthen you can just maybe answer a security\n\n641\n00:30:20.611 --> 00:30:23.993\nquestion or something in that effect and\nit'll automatically unlock you.\n\n642\n00:30:23.993 --> 00:30:28.080\nThere's a lot of different mechanisms\nwhich they used to make it easy for\n\n643\n00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.770\nthe end user to get back in their system\nif it's legitimately, I just accidentally\n\n644\n00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:36.666\ntype my password wrong a few times and\nI need to get back in the system.\n\n645\n00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:37.921\nSo very good stuff there.\n\n646\n00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:39.970\nLet's also talk about password reuse.\n\n647\n00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.841\nHow many times should you allow\nsomeone to reuse a password.\n\n648\n00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:44.962\nI've seen 12,\n\n649\n00:30:44.962 --> 00:30:49.451\nyou have to have 12 new passwords\nbefore you can use the old password.\n\n650\n00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:53.956\nIt's gonna go hand in hand a lot with how\nlong before the password changes a lot\n\n651\n00:30:53.956 --> 00:30:54.589\nof times.\n\n652\n00:30:54.589 --> 00:30:57.854\nSo, maybe 12 is a lot.\n\n653\n00:30:57.854 --> 00:31:01.248\nYou know maybe you're changing\nyour password every 20 days and\n\n654\n00:31:01.248 --> 00:31:03.700\nall of the sudden that's not so much.\n\n655\n00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.106\nBut maybe you change your\npassword every 60 days.\n\n656\n00:31:06.106 --> 00:31:08.130\nAll of a sudden 12 is a better number for\n\n657\n00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.650\nyour end user experience,\nit's a whole lot easier.\n\n658\n00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.720\n&gt;&gt; And the idea here is to\nprotect people from guessing\n\n659\n00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.700\nbased on our patterns, right?\n\n660\n00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.103\nSo, if my old password was gator001,\nand I make it gator002.\n\n661\n00:31:17.103 --> 00:31:19.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Somebody could guess that, right?\n\n662\n00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.280\nSo, if it triggers a reuse, because\na lot of them are going to look for\n\n663\n00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.370\nhow many characters and it'll say you\ncan't read those five characters or\n\n664\n00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.590\nwhatever It, it would pick up by\nnot changing my password enough.\n\n665\n00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.500\nAnd that'll stop you.\n\n666\n00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.000\nAnd again it's just a, to help maintain\nthe security of your password.\n\n667\n00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.620\nThat's why that policy is in place.\n\n668\n00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.280\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n669\n00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.535\nAnd also it keeps you from going,\nokay well I'm gonna change my password.\n\n670\n00:31:37.535 --> 00:31:41.278\nI've got gator001, really like it,\nI'm gonna make it gator002 and\n\n671\n00:31:41.278 --> 00:31:44.682\nthen I'm gonna change my password and\ngo right back to gator001.\n\n672\n00:31:44.682 --> 00:31:48.825\nThere are mechanisms usually in place for\nthat as well, that keeps you from reusing\n\n673\n00:31:48.825 --> 00:31:51.916\nthose old passwords, so\nsomeone can't guess your pattern.\n\n674\n00:31:51.916 --> 00:31:52.931\nYou wanna stay away from that.\n\n675\n00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:56.150\nThat way, the bad guys stay out,\nthe good guys stay in.\n\n676\n00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.602\nAnd the last thing I wanna talk\nabout is the lockout period.\n\n677\n00:31:58.602 --> 00:32:01.585\nA lot of times there is a lockout period,\nif you do get locked out and\n\n678\n00:32:01.585 --> 00:32:05.103\nlet's say it's lunchtime or for whatever\nreason nobody's at the help desk or\n\n679\n00:32:05.103 --> 00:32:08.567\nit's super slammed and you're having\nto wait on the phone, typically we can\n\n680\n00:32:08.567 --> 00:32:13.025\ncreate a lockout period, maybe 15 minutes,\nmaybe 30 minutes, maybe 10 minutes.\n\n681\n00:32:13.025 --> 00:32:15.900\nOf just stopping that and\nthen after that time expires,\n\n682\n00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.092\nthe lockout will relinquished and the user\nwill be unlocked, allowing them to just\n\n683\n00:32:20.092 --> 00:32:23.380\nwait the timeout if they can't get to\nan administrator to get that to them.\n\n684\n00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.300\n&gt;&gt; And that might sound like a weakened\nsecurity but it really doesn't.\n\n685\n00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.840\nRemember if someone is brute\nforcing they're trying to throw\n\n686\n00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.560\nthousands of passwords\nper second at the system.\n\n687\n00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.319\nIf you hold them down for ten minutes, and\nthen they get another five guesses, and\n\n688\n00:32:35.319 --> 00:32:38.919\nthen another ten minutes, it slows them\ndown so much it becomes theoretically\n\n689\n00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:42.272\nimpossible for them to break a password\nin any realistic amount of time.\n\n690\n00:32:42.272 --> 00:32:46.906\nSo, it helps to alleviate some of the\nfrustration on our part as end-users if we\n\n691\n00:32:46.906 --> 00:32:48.371\nget the password wrong.\n\n692\n00:32:48.371 --> 00:32:50.090\nI know, I just need to wait ten minutes.\n\n693\n00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.888\nOr wait 30 minutes.\n\n694\n00:32:50.888 --> 00:32:52.657\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So, you'll have to check with your IT\n\n695\n00:32:52.657 --> 00:32:54.254\ndepartment to see what your duration is.\n\n696\n00:32:54.254 --> 00:32:57.124\nSome like high security\nenvironments won't have a duration.\n\n697\n00:32:57.124 --> 00:33:00.975\nThey'll say you are just locked out\nuntil you contact the help desk.\n\n698\n00:33:00.975 --> 00:33:02.188\nYou've got to initiate that procedure.\n\n699\n00:33:02.188 --> 00:33:06.572\nSo, it just depends so that lockout\nthresholds, the timers, are pretty common\n\n700\n00:33:06.572 --> 00:33:10.960\nand you see those pretty frequently just\nto help stop those brute force attacks.\n\n701\n00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.681\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n702\n00:33:11.681 --> 00:33:14.360\nWell passwords obviously\nare a very important thing.\n\n703\n00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.407\nAlso, I want to iterate the fact that, if\nyou are locked out and you don't know why,\n\n704\n00:33:18.407 --> 00:33:21.714\nyou haven't typed in your password\nincorrectly X amount of times and\n\n705\n00:33:21.714 --> 00:33:24.237\nyou're still locked out,\ncontact your helpdesk.\n\n706\n00:33:24.237 --> 00:33:28.041\nContact somebody in authority over that\nsystem, so that they are aware that has\n\n707\n00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:30.821\nhappened, maybe there is a bad\nguy knocking at the door and\n\n708\n00:33:30.821 --> 00:33:32.773\nthat will help raise that flag for them.\n\n709\n00:33:32.773 --> 00:33:34.481\nSo always be aware of that.\n\n710\n00:33:34.481 --> 00:33:37.507\nThen when it comes down\nto passwords length and\n\n711\n00:33:37.507 --> 00:33:40.073\ncomplexity is going to be your friend.\n\n712\n00:33:40.073 --> 00:33:44.002\nUse pass phrases it's gonna help\nyou out with that pneumonic device.\n\n713\n00:33:44.002 --> 00:33:47.882\nSo you can remember those lengthy\npasswords and if you can get away with it\n\n714\n00:33:47.882 --> 00:33:51.579\nby all means if you have the means,\nget yourself a password manager.\n\n715\n00:33:51.579 --> 00:33:54.160\nIt's gonna make your\nlife a whole lot easier.\n\n716\n00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.300\nDon, I think that's about all I\ngot on passwords for today though.\n\n717\n00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.630\nHopefully that helps you good folks out\nthere meet your complexity requirements,\n\n718\n00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.570\nmeet your length requirements and\nstay safe in your environment.\n\n719\n00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, well hopefully\nthat was a good description for\n\n720\n00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.590\nyou guys to explain away why we have\nsome of these really weird password\n\n721\n00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:12.150\nrequirements that can seem annoying,\nand frustrating and pointless.\n\n722\n00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.610\nBut they all actually have a reason.\n\n723\n00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:17.170\nThere's a reason they're there in place\nand we're the ones who help maintain that.\n\n724\n00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.060\nThe IT department can only do so much.\n\n725\n00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.470\nIt's up to us to make sure that we\nfollow proper password policies and\n\n726\n00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:23.640\nprocedures as well.\n\n727\n00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.210\nSo, that's a pretty good wrap-up.\n\n728\n00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.714\nDaniel, did you have any parting\nwords before we close up?\n\n729\n00:34:27.714 --> 00:34:30.127\n&gt;&gt; Just don't share your passwords please.\n\n730\n00:34:30.127 --> 00:34:31.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't write them on sticky notes.\n\n731\n00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:35.900\nI can't reiteratize that enough, because\nif you give someone your password and\n\n732\n00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.670\nthey login and\nthey do something that they shouldn't do.\n\n733\n00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.170\nAnd they're logged in as you,\n\n734\n00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.290\nthe only thing that we can,\nand they don't cop to it.\n\n735\n00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.010\nWhat are we supposed to assume?\n\n736\n00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.000\nIs that you did it.\n\n737\n00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.349\nSo don't share passwords, don't write\nthem down, keep them secure and safe,\n\n738\n00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:49.638\nuse those password managers.\n\n739\n00:34:49.638 --> 00:34:53.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, ladies and gentlemen\nthat is gonna wrap up our episode right\n\n740\n00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.725\nhere for enduser security awareness.\n\n741\n00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:56.088\nI do hope you guys enjoy it.\n\n742\n00:34:56.088 --> 00:34:57.849\nI've been your host, Don Pezet.\n\n743\n00:34:57.849 --> 00:34:58.897\n&gt;&gt;
