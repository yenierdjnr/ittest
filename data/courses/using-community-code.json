So this course is about,\n\n6\n00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.820\nwell, the reaching out to the community,\nseeing what has already been made so\n\n7\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.770\nyou don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n8\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.160\nAnd most of this time is gonna spend\naround the tooling, because, well,\n\n9\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.110\nthe community is vast, it's expansive.\n\n10\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.080\nWe can't take all the time to see every\nlittle library module or package.\n\n11\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.270\nSo it's about using the tooling to acquire\n\n12\n00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.470\nthat community code to solve\nproblems that you may have so\n\n13\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.100\nyou don't have to build it from scratch.\n&gt;&gt; Now\n\n14\n00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.245\nwho should be watching this course?\n&gt;&gt; So this course is aimed at\n\n15\n00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:49.907\nsomeone who's, you've been playing\naround with Python a little bit,\n\n16\n00:00:49.907 --> 00:00:51.820\nyou've been learning how to program.\n\n17\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.310\nYou're decently versed\nin the standard library.\n\n18\n00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.700\nYou don't have to know everything,\nthe standard library is giant.\n\n19\n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.770\nBut now you're like, well, I need to\nreally do x, I need to maybe plot a graph.\n\n20\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.788\nOr, I really wanna build a web server,\nor, I really want to just,\n\n21\n00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:10.300\nI wanna do x or y or z, right?\n\n22\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.960\nSomething new that you can't\nfind in the standard library and\n\n23\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.620\nseems like a very large undertaking.\n\n24\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.240\nOr, you're like, well, I wanna do x but\n\n25\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.170\nin order to do that I have to\nbe able to read CSVs easily.\n\n26\n00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.390\nWell, I don't wanna do\nthe whole CSV thing by myself.\n\n27\n00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.850\nI wonder if there's somewhere in\nthe community that already has that\n\n28\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.290\ntaken care of for me.\n\n29\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.750\nAnd then you go, yeah, there it is.\n\n30\n00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.120\nAnd now you can utilize that to further\nyour own project without having to\n\n31\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.150\ncontinue to build everything\nfrom absolute ground up.\n\n32\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.190\n&gt;&gt; Is this a certification-based course?\n\n33\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.160\n&gt;&gt; It is not a certification.\n\n34\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.260\nIt's more about powering up your skills.\n\n35\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:54.370\nAbout seeing how working together as\na community throughout this Python and\n\n36\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.190\nthe feel, a lot of times other programming\nlanguages have similar communities.\n\n37\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.190\nAnd seeing, well,\ncan I take what maybe Aubri has done or\n\n38\n00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.910\nsomeone else has done and build upon that\nto power up my own understanding and\n\n39\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.380\nprogramming skills.\n&gt;&gt; What topics are we gonna cover in these\n\n40\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.950\nup coming episodes?\n&gt;&gt; So more specifically, we're going to be\n\n41\n00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.790\ntalking about how to use pip and how to\nlook at PyPi the Python Package Index.\n\n42\n00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.930\nTo search out for certain packages\nthat solve a particular problem.\n\n43\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.040\nSome of these are small like,\nhey where can I find URLs for cat images?\n\n44\n00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.660\nWell that might be on PyPi or\nit might be something more expansive where\n\n45\n00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.426\nyou're like, hey I need to figure out how\nto communicate between multiple computers.\n\n46\n00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:39.340\nIs that on PyPi?\n\n47\n00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.790\nSo that's our first step.\n\n48\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.870\nBut then we take a look that\npip has some shortcomings,\n\n49\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.110\nwe gotta figure out how\nto not mess things up.\n\n50\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.640\nSo we look into virtual environments.\n\n51\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.150\nVirtual environments are a way to kind\nof sandbox where you install these.\n\n52\n00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:02.000\nThen we realize that virtual environments\nstill have a little bit of a headache.\n\n53\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.530\nSo we looked at a brand new\ntool called pipenv, and\n\n54\n00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.620\nit's kinda hard to say, that allows\nus to track what we've installed and\n\n55\n00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.520\nmanage our virtual environments\nin a little more intuitive way.\n\n56\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.320\nAnd then as an added bonus, if you really\nwanna get crazy with your python packages\n\n57\n00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.710\nthen there's another tool that is\nmore scientific data analyst bent,\n\n58\n00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.830\ncalled Conda,\nthat we'll finish up the show with.\n\n59\n00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.740\nIt does the exact same thing as pipenv, or\n\n60\n00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.790\nVirtual Environments, but\nit manages a few other things for\n\n61\n00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.080\nthese very specialty libraries that are,\nsometimes, hard to install.\n\n62\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.710\nAnd, well when we take a look\nat both on Mac OS and Linux.\n\n63\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.860\nThat's predominantly where we are but\n\n64\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.510\nalso take a little detour to how we get to\nsetup on Windows so you can follow along.\n\n65\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.480\nSo, those are the high level topics.\n\n66\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.680\nWe're pretty deep into a few of them.\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n67\n00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.610\nWell, thank you, Justin.\n\n68\n00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.240\nThank you all for joining us.\n\n69\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.110\nIf using community code sounds like\nsomething that you're interested in,\n\n70\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.120\nbe sure to watch every single episode.\n\n71\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.926\nYou'll become one step closer\nto being a Python Pro.\n\n72\n00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:04.581\nThanks for watching.\n\n73\n00:04:04.581 --> 00:04:09.469\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
