After an overview of various version control systems, Justin dives into the use of git and GitHub to manage projects. Justin pays particular attention to the version control system and less on the programming portion for the first part. He explores creating a git repository, cloning repositories from GitHub, committing changes to a repository, using branches, collaborating with git, and more. If you are looking to get started with version control, specifically git, then join us there.",

So the main goal of version control,\nand this is one of those idols that\n\n7\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.380\nmay lead you astray so\nI'm going to set you straight right now.\n\n8\n00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.440\nWe're first going to look at some\nother version control systems,\n\n9\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.740\nkind of a survey initially, but\nthen we're going to choose Git.\n\n10\n00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.790\nGIT, as our version control system to\nkind of utilize and work through and\n\n11\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.500\nsee how it comes into play, so we're gonna\ninstall git, we're gonna set it up and\n\n12\n00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.350\nconfigure it locally on a machine, we're\nalso gonna great a GitHub account, and\n\n13\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.870\nthere are alternatives to that but we've\njust chosen GitHub because it's something\n\n14\n00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.590\nI know and ti's still very relevant and\nthen we're gonna learn about, well,\n\n15\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.660\nhow do I create a Git repo?\n\n16\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.440\nHow do I commit changes or\nadd things to a repo?\n\n17\n00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.540\nHow do I collaborate?\n\n18\n00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.415\nWhat are effective practices?\n\n19\n00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:10.130\nHow does this all work in software,\nand does it have to be just software?\n\n20\n00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.006\nAnd some of it is ultimately up to you,\nthose decisions.\n\n21\n00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:18.965\nBut will talk about those at length\n&gt;&gt; And who is this show targeted towards?\n\n22\n00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:22.758\n&gt;&gt; So this is someone who is maybe is\nlike I know a little bit about a version\n\n23\n00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:27.004\ncontrol or I have never heard a control,\nwhat are you talking about before what\n\n24\n00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:31.313\nare the possible options, I wanna get\nstarted right, I'm trying to break in to\n\n25\n00:01:31.313 --> 00:01:35.790\nprograming and I've heard a lot that I\nneed to know Version Control Systems.\n\n26\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.790\nAnd so we teach you one but\nalong with practices kind of map over.\n\n27\n00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.038\nSo used to get you start,\n\n28\n00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:44.315\nget you comfortable with employing\nVersion Control Practices.\n\n29\n00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:46.579\n&gt;&gt; Now is there a certification\navailable for this course?\n\n30\n00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.900\nThere is not a certification available for\nthis course.\n\n31\n00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.300\nThis is about leveling up your skills.\n\n32\n00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.010\nGetting comfortable with a new tool and a\nnew set of practices.B That allow you to,\n\n33\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.740\nnumber one,\nkeep track of things that you've done.\n\n34\n00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.800\nBut also collaborate\nwith other individuals.\n\n35\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.660\nAnd I've chosen Git,\n\n36\n00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.880\nbecause it seems to be the more pervasive\nof the technologies at current time.\n\n37\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.470\nThat doesn't mean that you\nwill encounter other ones.\n\n38\n00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.144\nBut, you know, as I said before,\nthose ideas and\n\n39\n00:02:13.144 --> 00:02:17.095\npractices and\nskills kind of map over fairly easily.\n\n40\n00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:20.370\n&gt;&gt; Now, you've already touched on it,\nso what topics are covered?\n\n41\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.770\n&gt;&gt; So, initialization of a repo,\nsetting up a remote repo,\n\n42\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.410\nconnecting a remote and local repos.\n\n43\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.530\nNow, when I say repos,\n\n44\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.530\nthose ultimately end up being\nfolders with Special structures.\n\n45\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.280\nAnd then what is a branch?\n\n46\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.230\nHow do I branch?\n\n47\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.340\nHow do I collaborate?\n\n48\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.550\nHow do I collaborate with a single repost?\n\n49\n00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.420\nHow do I collaborate with\nmultiple copies of repost?\n\n50\n00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.200\nHow do I sync changes to\na remote repost on GitHub?\n\n51\n00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.910\nHow do I bring those changes down?\n\n52\n00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.930\nHow do I bring these\nbranched back together?\n\n53\n00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.400\nAnd what happens when things go wry?\n\n54\n00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.499\nNow that's just a touch of things.\n\n55\n00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:58.127\nThere's still a lot more\nthat I haven't talked about.\n\n56\n00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:00.174\nThe ultimate goal, is to give you a,\n\n57\n00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:03.220\nhere are the core concepts\nthat you need to know right.\n\n58\n00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.410\nAnd those are the things\nI just talked about.\n\n59\n00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.610\nAnd then every once in a while\nwe'll add in a little extra right,\n\n60\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.500\nthat is maybe a more advanced feature but\n\n61\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.090\nis very applicable in the context of\nthe situation that we're exploring.\n\n62\n00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.720\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Justin, that sounds great now\nif version control sounds like something\n\n63\n00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.297\nyou might be interested in and you should,\nmake sure you watch all the episodes in\n\n64\n00:03:21.297 --> 00:03:23.732\nthe course library and\nthanks for watching DevProTV.\n\n65\n00:03:23.732 --> 00:03:29.466\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
