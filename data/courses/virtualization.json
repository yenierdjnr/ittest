series,\nVirtualization Technologies.\n\n4\n00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.600\nAnd Ronnie,\nwhat can we expect to see in this?\n\n5\n00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.980\n>> When we start taking a look at\nvirtualization technologies, what we're\n\n6\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.040\ngonna do of course is make sure that you\nunderstand what the basics really are.\n\n7\n00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.218\nWe're gonna talk about some different\nterminologies that you're gonna encounter.\n\n8\n00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:29.776\nWe're gonna actually make sure that\nyou understand why we actually use\n\n9\n00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:33.450\nvirtualization, as well as take a look\nat just the basic concepts between\n\n10\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.088\nthe technologies, such as type one and\ntype two high providers as well.\n\n11\n00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:39.090\nSo, we're gonna introduce you that way.\n\n12\n00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.130\nAnd then, you're gonna see in this series\nthat we're going to be walking you through\n\n13\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.680\nsome of the most popular virtualization\ntechnologies you are likely to see,\n\n14\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.573\nsuch as Oracle's VirtualBox.\n\n15\n00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:54.999\nWe're gonna take you through,\nof course, Microsoft's Hyper V,\n\n16\n00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.882\nwe're also gonna take a look\nat VMwares Workstation 2, or\n\n17\n00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:03.795\nWorkstation 11 I should say, and\nthen of course VMwares ESX or VSphere.\n\n18\n00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:07.908\nAnd lastly we're gonna take a look at\none that is a little bit more unusual,\n\n19\n00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:12.482\nespecially if you're just starting out\nin virtualization, one called KVM Kernel\n\n20\n00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:16.590\nbased virtual machines,\nthat normally runs off of Linux as well.\n\n21\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.355\nSo we'll be taking a look at all those\ndifferent technologies for us, and\n\n22\n00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:21.701\nintroducing you to them.\n\n23\n00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:23.789\nWell see, the idea here is fairly simple,\n\n24\n00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.577\nwe want you to actually feel\nlike that you can install it.\n\n25\n00:01:26.577 --> 00:01:29.337\nWe want you to be able to\ncreate a virtual machine in it,\n\n26\n00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:32.250\nas well as be able to manage\nthat virtual machine.\n\n27\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.300\nBe able to do some of the basic things\nthat anybody in the IT industry\n\n28\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.490\nwould actually be able to say hey,\nI can work with that technology.\n\n29\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.810\n>> Ronnie, now speaking of maybe just\nstarting out in a virtualization\n\n30\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.090\ntechnology, is this gonna be\nsomething that's exam based,\n\n31\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.470\nmaybe targeted towards a certain exam or\ncertification?\n\n32\n00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.560\n>> This particular set of shows that\nwe're gonna be doing are not really gonna\n\n33\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.360\nbe exam based, but they're more towards\nhelping you develop as an IT worker.\n\n34\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.090\nThe whole goal is simple, let's just\ntake for an example as a scenario,\n\n35\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.990\nthat you're getting hired for\na company and you wanna learn more about\n\n36\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.250\nvirtualization technology, because you're\ngonna be expected to know about it.\n\n37\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.845\nWell this series is perfect for you,\n\n38\n00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.930\nsince you will get an introduction\nto the basic terminology.\n\n39\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.690\nYou will also end up seeing all of those\ndifferent technologies that we've just\n\n40\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.970\nmentioned here, and show you how to\nactually work in them a little bit, so\n\n41\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.660\nthat you can feel confident\nthat as you go into a job,\n\n42\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.110\nto a production network somewhere,\nthat you're not gonna be completely lost.\n\n43\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.180\nAnd you actually have seen some\nof the very technical sides\n\n44\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.080\nof the way that we install it,\nas well as get a virtual machine up and\n\n45\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.810\nrunning and even getting rid\nof virtual machines as well.\n\n46\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.920\nSo this is actually a very good and\n\n47\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.355\nvery hands on type of series\nyou're gonna eventually see.\n\n48\n00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:51.360\n>> Now, Ronnie, if somebody is getting\ninto virtualization technologies, and\n\n49\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.068\nthey're gonna be watching our series\non virtualization technologies,\n\n50\n00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:57.236\nwho is the targeted audience for this one?\n\n51\n00:02:57.236 --> 00:03:00.881\n>> The targeted audience is really\nthe person that needs to understand more\n\n52\n00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.144\nabout virtualization.\n\n53\n00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:06.309\nWhether you're just somebody that's saying\nhey, I want to know about virtualization,\n\n54\n00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.200\nor whether you're actually somebody that\nis now working on staff at some production\n\n55\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.654\nnetwork and they're telling you you're\nabout to actually get introduced\n\n56\n00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:17.910\nmore to the virtualization technologies,\nor they want you to learn more about it.\n\n57\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.630\nWell here's where you will get a bit of a\ndive into the different technologies, and\n\n58\n00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.490\nregardless of what shop that you're\nworking in, you'll probably see one,\n\n59\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.250\nif not more than one of these\ntechnologies that we will be diving into.\n\n60\n00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.530\nSo if your goal of course is to become\na better IT worker in your skills,\n\n61\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.480\nif your goal is hey, my job is going\nto require it in the near future,\n\n62\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.670\nI need to learn more about it, or\nI'm just interested in the technology,\n\n63\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.630\nit will range every where\nin that different range.\n\n64\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.620\nIt doesn't get in to the most technical\naspects of every single virtualization\n\n65\n00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.200\ntechnology, but a good well-rounded\napproach to how you install it,\n\n66\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.120\nhow do you actually create a VM?\n\n67\n00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.120\nWhere do you actually get\nthe installation files from, and\n\n68\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.510\nof course,\nhow do you get it up and running?\n\n69\n00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.246\nAnd we'll actually show you all\nof that in this new series.\n\n70\n00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.411\n>> Great, and if that sounds something\nlike you might be interested in,\n\n71\n00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:10.915\nvirtualization technologies,\n\n72\n00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:13.986\nstick around cuz we've got a lot\nof great episodes coming your way.\n\n73\n00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:19.409\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:18.130\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.080\ntoday we're gonna be looking at\nvirtualization technologies.\n\n5\n00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.808\nNow virtualization is one of those things\nthat If you're in the IT field you're\n\n6\n00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:25.596\ngonna run into.\n\n7\n00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:30.794\nJust about every organization out there\nis using virtualization in one form or\n\n8\n00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:31.840\nanother.\n\n9\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.160\nSo it's very important that we're\nfamiliar with the technologies and\n\n10\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.730\nthe terminologies that go\nalong with virtualization.\n\n11\n00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.318\nSo we get out in that work place or\nas we move up in our company.\n\n12\n00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:45.581\nWe understand these technologies and\nwe can work with them and\n\n13\n00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:47.158\nimplement them if we have to.\n\n14\n00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:49.933\nAnd here with me to help us\nexplain this is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n15\n00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:50.920\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n16\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.336\n>> I am doing fine.\n\n17\n00:00:52.336 --> 00:00:57.276\nThere's no doubt, Mike is completely right\nabout the very fact that virtualization\n\n18\n00:00:57.276 --> 00:01:00.637\nis a technology that everybody\nworks in IT is going to end up\n\n19\n00:01:00.637 --> 00:01:04.090\nhaving to deal with in some fashion,\nin some form.\n\n20\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.250\nAnd this means that if\nyou're an IT worker,\n\n21\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.900\nyou have to at least be familiar with\nthose concepts and those terminologies.\n\n22\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.691\nBecause if you're not, you're going\nto find yourself so behind the curve,\n\n23\n00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:15.102\nit's not going to be funny.\n\n24\n00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:16.817\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, virtualization is,\n\n25\n00:01:16.817 --> 00:01:19.223\nif you ask the majority of the people,\nright.\n\n26\n00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:24.018\nIn the last ten years or so,\nvirtualization may be, if you read enough\n\n27\n00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:28.917\narticles, the most important IT\nconcept that has come along in years.\n\n28\n00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:32.597\nSo much so that they're saying, look,\nwithout virtualization we would be so\n\n29\n00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:36.720\nfar behind the bell curve even now, that\nit's actually straining us to a point.\n\n30\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.996\nSo we need to at least kind\nof be familiar with that, and\n\n31\n00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:41.175\nthis episode is actually\ngoing to help us to do that.\n\n32\n00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:43.839\n>> Now Ronnie,\nlet's start with the basics and\n\n33\n00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:48.677\nI hear the term virtualized environment\nand at first I'm picturing 3D goggles or\n\n34\n00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:51.220\nsomething, and big gloves with sensors.\n\n35\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.577\nBut that's really not what we're talking\nabout here when we talk about virtualized\n\n36\n00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:55.770\nenvironments, right?\n\n37\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.900\n>> A lot of times we do think about\nthe idea of virtual reality, and\n\n38\n00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.010\nto a point you could say\nsomething like that.\n\n39\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.160\nBut in the field of IT what\nwe're really referring to,\n\n40\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.480\nof course, is the ability to\ntake what we have physically and\n\n41\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.210\nbe able to represent it in\nsoftware more than anything else.\n\n42\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.530\nNow you're probably wondering why\nin the world we need [INAUDIBLE].\n\n43\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.280\nLet me kind of give you an example here.\n\n44\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.973\nSo let's go to my computer so I can show\nyou a diagram that I've made to try and\n\n45\n00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:23.131\nexplain something right at the beginning.\n\n46\n00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:25.625\nThe first thing we have to understand,\nof course,\n\n47\n00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:29.580\nis the physical environment that we work\non inside the IT environment everyday.\n\n48\n00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.270\nWhich is going to be some\ntype of computer, right?\n\n49\n00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.150\nWhether we're working in servers or\nwhether we're working on workstations,\n\n50\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.840\nthe PC is kind of\na representation of what we have.\n\n51\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.100\nAnd so when we sit there at a PC,\nat a computer or Mac or\n\n52\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.530\nwhatever it might be,\nwe have a piece of hardware, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.980\nSo that hardware of course includes\nthings like the CPU, the RAM,\n\n54\n00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.210\nthe storage, the network,\nthe graphics card.\n\n55\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.010\nYou name it, it has all of that stuff.\n\n56\n00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.856\n>> And then, so that you and I can\nhave the ability to interact with it,\n\n57\n00:02:57.856 --> 00:03:02.400\nwe add in things like an operating system\nthat allows us access to the hardware.\n\n58\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.387\nBut then when we need\nto accomplish things,\n\n59\n00:03:04.387 --> 00:03:06.230\nwe add in things like applications.\n\n60\n00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.200\nSo if you're doing a word processor,\nyou load up an application on top of that.\n\n61\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.560\nYou're working with a spreadsheet,\nyou load up a spreadsheet application.\n\n62\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.410\nAnd you begin to work right there.\n\n63\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.630\nAnd that's kinda the basis of what we're\ntalking about right here at the beginning,\n\n64\n00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.710\nin that physical environment when\nwe start to take a look here.\n\n65\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.750\nNow when you start to take a look at that,\nwell what is the overall result here?\n\n66\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.750\nWell, you have a single operating system,\nand\n\n67\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.200\nreally only one user gets\nto use it right then.\n\n68\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.900\n>> And then the same thing, Ronnie,\ngoes on in my server closet.\n\n69\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.990\nI've got that physical piece of hardware,\nit's the same concept, right?\n\n70\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.590\nI've got RAM and I've got processor and\nI've got hard drives.\n\n71\n00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.370\nAnd I install my operating system,\nsay, Server 2012 R2.\n\n72\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.710\nAnd then I throw some applications\nlike DNS or DHCP on there,\n\n73\n00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.600\nand we're good to go.\n\n74\n00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.378\n>> That's pretty much it.\n\n75\n00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:58.298\nAnd this is where it becomes a nice\nidea for the IT world, right?\n\n76\n00:03:58.298 --> 00:04:01.979\nMost of the time what ends up happening\nis now that we have that workstation or\n\n77\n00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.430\nthat server running, we do.\n\n78\n00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.630\nWe end up actually only using a very small\npercentage of what that device can do.\n\n79\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.372\nWell, let me kind of give you an example,\nright?\n\n80\n00:04:10.372 --> 00:04:14.690\nSo let's say that the last laptop that I\nhad before the one that I have right here.\n\n81\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.533\nAnd an i7, and it had 8 gigs of RAM.\n\n82\n00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:25.789\nIt had a 256 gig solid state drive in it,\na graphics card with a gig of RAM on it.\n\n83\n00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.971\nMike, do you know what kind\nof games I played on it?\n\n84\n00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:31.094\n>> I hope a lot, because I'm\npretty jealous right now [LAUGH].\n\n85\n00:04:31.094 --> 00:04:32.649\n>> Yeah, I played Freecell.\n\n86\n00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:36.794\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So I played Freecell on it.\n\n87\n00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:39.076\n>> Way to maximize your hardware there,\n\n88\n00:04:39.076 --> 00:04:39.970\nRonnie\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.320\n>> Yeah, it is amazing, right?\n\n90\n00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.234\nThe majority of the time when users\nare using their own workstations,\n\n91\n00:04:46.234 --> 00:04:50.625\nthey're really not using any more\nthan 15% or 20% of that workstation.\n\n92\n00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:53.144\nNow don't get me wrong, those of\nyou that are power users out there.\n\n93\n00:04:53.144 --> 00:04:54.130\nYou use the heck out of it.\n\n94\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.240\nFine and that's dandy, and\nthat's what it's designed for.\n\n95\n00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.170\nBut most of us, if you're like me\nyou're working on a word processor or\n\n96\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.875\na spreadsheet, or browsing the Internet or\ndoing research on it.\n\n97\n00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:06.634\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You're really using very little bit of\n\n98\n00:05:06.634 --> 00:05:07.730\nthat machine.\n\n99\n00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.170\n>> So does the same thing happen\nthen in my server closet?\n\n100\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.040\nCuz I know if I go out and\nbuy a server right now,\n\n101\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.188\nI'm probably gonna get dual quad\ncore processors and 64 gigs of RAM.\n\n102\n00:05:17.188 --> 00:05:19.750\nTons of hard-drive space, and\n\n103\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.090\nI'm going to run DNS and DHCP, so I'm\nkind of doing the same thing, aren't I?\n\n104\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.141\n>> That's exactly what's happening\nright now in that server world, right?\n\n105\n00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:31.720\nThe very fact is that's how we\nused to actually build servers.\n\n106\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.270\nYou'd kind of realize and go, look,\nI know I need an extra domain controller.\n\n107\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.920\nSo what would you do?\n\n108\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.149\nYou'd go out and you'd buy a machine\nlike what Mike spec'ed out there, and\n\n109\n00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:42.080\nyou'd install your base operating system.\n\n110\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.450\nAnd at this point here,we'd do\nsomething like Windows Server 2012.\n\n111\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.570\nWe'd install that on there, and\n\n112\n00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.890\nthen go ahead and install and\nconfigure the role right on there.\n\n113\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.190\nBut the domain controller\nthat we're talking, the DNS.\n\n114\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.780\nIt's not really using the entire power\n\n115\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.840\nof 64 gigs of RAM and\nactually dual processors on that machine.\n\n116\n00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.740\nIt's really only using just a bit of it.\n\n117\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.292\nBut that's the way that those\nmachines are designed, right?\n\n118\n00:06:10.292 --> 00:06:15.657\nNobody in past really envisioned that,\nlook, a single operating system with\n\n119\n00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:21.039\na couple of roles on it is not that it\ncan't actually be ran on a smaller device.\n\n120\n00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.900\nBut because technology and hardware\ncontinue to move toward the future,\n\n121\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.085\neven a regular desktop machine day is\nprobably more than enough to do all those.\n\n122\n00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:32.460\nBut now, we're actually installing\nindividual roles like what Mike is\n\n123\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.241\ntalking about.\n\n124\n00:06:33.241 --> 00:06:35.544\nWell now, we actually have\nto buy another one for DHTP,\n\n125\n00:06:35.544 --> 00:06:38.560\nwe have to buy another one for\nanother service that's running.\n\n126\n00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.270\nAnd this is where you end up with\nthe big gigantic data center.\n\n127\n00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.110\nA rack full of these servers, and then\nyou actually start labeling each one and\n\n128\n00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.350\nyou realize something.\n\n129\n00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.230\nThat man, it'd be nice if all of those\nrolls could kind of run on two or\n\n130\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.280\nthree of these devices instead of\na stack of 16 different devices here.\n\n131\n00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.760\nSo in that physical environment,\nthis is our basic limitation here.\n\n132\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.579\nIs the very fact is that one operating\nsystem that we install on there,\n\n133\n00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:08.129\nreally has access to all that hardware,\nbut we never really use all that hardware.\n\n134\n00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.566\nSo in the world of IT,\nwe call it over provisioning.\n\n135\n00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:12.147\nRight?\n\n136\n00:07:12.147 --> 00:07:14.666\nThe very fact is that we\nonly run a little bit.\n\n137\n00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:18.738\nWe only really use just a small fraction\nof the power that's available either to\n\n138\n00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:21.004\nthat workstation, and most users only do.\n\n139\n00:07:21.004 --> 00:07:23.736\nAnd even most servers out there\nthat are only running one or\n\n140\n00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:26.320\ntwo roles that are only\nusing a small bit of it.\n\n141\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.150\nBut yet, let's say if you go out\nto one of those server vendors.\n\n142\n00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.190\nAnd they're like well\nhere's our base model, and\n\n143\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.460\nyou're still dealing with\ndual core processors.\n\n144\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.420\nAnd at least 4GB of RAM,\n\n145\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.480\nif not 8 at the minimum, and\nthen solid state drives today are that.\n\n146\n00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.730\nAnd that's still just overpowering.\n\n147\n00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.050\nYou're providing so much power, and on\ntop of that, even things like electricity\n\n148\n00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.430\nthat you're providing for\nthat device to actually be able to run.\n\n149\n00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.335\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n150\n00:07:52.335 --> 00:07:55.316\nit's great, but the very fact is\nwe're not really using that power.\n\n151\n00:07:55.316 --> 00:07:59.356\nAnd so in that particular sense, it's\na lot more expenditure of money as well.\n\n152\n00:07:59.356 --> 00:08:02.862\nSo virtualized environments Help\nus to do something different.\n\n153\n00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:03.682\n[LAUGH] You go wow,\n\n154\n00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:07.077\nyou spend a lot of time describing\nthe physical, but we have to understand\n\n155\n00:08:07.077 --> 00:08:11.050\nthe physical first before we understand\nwhat that virtual environment does.\n\n156\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.850\nSo when we talk about\na virtualized environment,\n\n157\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:19.130\nwhat we're saying is there's a way that\nwe can take that hardware and actually be\n\n158\n00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.410\nable to allow multiple operating systems\nto share that same physical hardware.\n\n159\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.490\nSo that's really kind of the basis\nof what we're talking about\n\n160\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.010\nwhen we end up creating things\nlike virtual machines as well.\n\n161\n00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.910\nSo that's what the virtual environment\nreally helps us to do is say,\n\n162\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.010\nlook even though all that\nhardware is available, what\n\n163\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.530\nif I wanted to actually make it available\nto more than one machine at a time, or\n\n164\n00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.310\nvirtualized machine,\na software-based machine.\n\n165\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.788\nAnd this is where terminology will\nget you as you read on the Internet,\n\n166\n00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:48.010\nI want to point that out.\n\n167\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.650\nWhenever you hear the term, hardware\nabstraction, hardware abstraction.\n\n168\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.280\nThat's a weird term, Mike.\n\n169\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.090\n>> Right.\n>> I keep reading it like,\n\n170\n00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.950\nwhat the heck is a hardware abstraction?\n\n171\n00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.140\nWhen they start talking about this stuff,\nwell, it's really saying, look,\n\n172\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.520\nwe're taking that hardware, and we're\ngoing to represent it by software somehow.\n\n173\n00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.250\nWe're abstracting.\n\n174\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.840\nWe're not actually using the real\nhardware, but we're gonna actually take\n\n175\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.900\nthat hardware, and we're going to\nrepresent it in software somehow so\n\n176\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.000\nthat the applications that I run, so that\nthe operating system that I run, looks at\n\n177\n00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.870\nit and goes, yeah, I know it's software,\nbut you're telling me it's hardware?\n\n178\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.920\nI can work with that.\n\n179\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.110\nAnd I'll be able to use it.\n\n180\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.180\nSo it really is kind of a neat\nterminology that you hear.\n\n181\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.769\nWe need to hear about the term virtualized\nenvironment, and that's what it is.\n\n182\n00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:33.368\nIt's actually lying to the other\nsoftware that it's actually hardware.\n\n183\n00:09:33.368 --> 00:09:35.458\n>> And it's not really a new concept.\n\n184\n00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:39.590\nIt's just done in a new way, because\nif you studied computers in the past\n\n185\n00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:44.180\nyou remember the hardware abstraction\nlayer, or the HAL that we get.\n\n186\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.990\nSo this is just now taking\nit to that next step.\n\n187\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.036\nSo Ronnie, when you say I can\nrun multiple operating systems,\n\n188\n00:09:51.036 --> 00:09:54.482\nnow I've set up a dual-boot system\nbefore where I've had more than one\n\n189\n00:09:54.482 --> 00:09:57.012\noperating system installed\non that hard drive, and\n\n190\n00:09:57.012 --> 00:09:59.910\nI can pick which one I wanted\nwhen I started that machine up.\n\n191\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.860\nBut that's not what you're\ntalking about here.\n\n192\n00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.511\n>> No.\nNo,\n\n193\n00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:05.885\nthe way that Mike is actually describing\nit, in a dual-boot environment or\n\n194\n00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:09.470\nwhat you might hear the term multi-boot\nenvironment, allows us to be able to use\n\n195\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.820\nmultiple operating systems, so\nMike is on the right track here.\n\n196\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.150\nBut the problem the way that\nMike is describing it is simple,\n\n197\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.510\nis that we can only use it one at a time.\n\n198\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.230\nSo if Mike actually installed,\nI don't know why he would, but\n\n199\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.370\nlet's say that he chooses to do this.\n\n200\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.090\nIf he wanted to install Windows 98 and\n\n201\n00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.750\nWindows 10 together on the same machine,\nthat may be possible.\n\n202\n00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.740\nI don't know if it is or not, but he could\ninstall them both on that same machine,\n\n203\n00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.800\nbut he can't use them both simultaneously.\n\n204\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.280\nWhat he can do though, is actually\nreboot from one into the other and\n\n205\n00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.050\npick what what operating\nsystem he wants to launch.\n\n206\n00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.220\n>> So in the end,\nwith a solution like that,\n\n207\n00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.010\nI still only have one operating system\nhaving access to all that hardware.\n\n208\n00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.300\nSo I've still got a lot of resources\nthat aren't being utilized.\n\n209\n00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.710\n>> There is no doubt that\nthat is kind of the issue.\n\n210\n00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:55.095\nBut it does get us to that point where we\nstarted to think about something here,\n\n211\n00:10:55.095 --> 00:10:59.481\nespecially in the PC world, that maybe\nthere's a way that we can actually have\n\n212\n00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:01.624\nboth of them running at the same time.\n\n213\n00:11:01.624 --> 00:11:05.701\nNow when we mentioned the idea\nof virtualization technologies,\n\n214\n00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:10.446\nit really did begin actually in the 60s\nand 70s on mainframe computers,\n\n215\n00:11:10.446 --> 00:11:12.537\nbeing able to do stuff like that.\n\n216\n00:11:12.537 --> 00:11:16.125\nBut then it was really about 2000,\n2001, and\n\n217\n00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:20.571\na company called VMware is really\nthe first ones to reintroduce it.\n\n218\n00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:24.143\nSay look, we don't all have to\nvirtualize certain components and\n\n219\n00:11:24.143 --> 00:11:26.480\ncertain portions of this stuff.\n\n220\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.750\nWe can actually virtualize the entire\nmachine that Ronnie is working on\n\n221\n00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.260\nas his workstation, and\nallow him to actually run\n\n222\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.530\na simultaneous computer without him having\nto go out and buy another computer on it.\n\n223\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.670\nThey were really the first ones to kind of\nbring that back in in the early stages,\n\n224\n00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.930\nand they're still at the top of the heap\nof a lot of technologies that we're\n\n225\n00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:45.940\ntalking about.\n\n226\n00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.010\nSo we really owe them a big matter\nof thanks in the world of IT,\n\n227\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.700\nbecause virtualization helps\nus to do exactly that.\n\n228\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.686\nIt allows us to build and\n\n229\n00:11:54.686 --> 00:11:58.670\nrun multiple operating systems\nsimultaneously, sharing the hardware.\n\n230\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.050\nLet me show you what we're talking about\nwhen we do something like that here.\n\n231\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.670\nSo with virtualization, so\nover on the left-hand side,\n\n232\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.390\nI have the kind of model that we were\ntalking about right before here.\n\n233\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:13.920\nBut we have one operating system, single\nset of hardware, and then applications\n\n234\n00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.340\nthat run on top of that one operating\nsystem, works the way that we want to.\n\n235\n00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.240\nWe've never had a problem with it.\n\n236\n00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.410\nThe utilization though, of the hardware\nthat we have available, is really scant.\n\n237\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.940\nIn other words, we're not ever\ngoing to actually utilize that way,\n\n238\n00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.750\nor all of it, I should say.\n\n239\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.500\nBut now when we introduce\nthe idea of virtualization,\n\n240\n00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.400\nthere's a couple of pieces\nof software involved in it.\n\n241\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.580\nBut overall,\nlet's take a look at the differences here.\n\n242\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.740\nI've tried to stack them side by side so\nthat we could compare and\n\n243\n00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.330\nsee what we're talking about.\n\n244\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.270\nSo we can take that same idea of PC1 and\n\n245\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.220\nactually run it on another machine,\nand what we add in\n\n246\n00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.970\nis another layer of software now that\nwe call a Virtual Machine Monitor.\n\n247\n00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.550\nI normally use the term\nVirtual Machine Manager,\n\n248\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.300\nI think that the technical term\nis Virtual Machine Monitor.\n\n249\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.809\nI always say manager, and the reason why\nis that type of software allows me to\n\n250\n00:13:03.809 --> 00:13:06.209\nnow be able to create virtual machines.\n\n251\n00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:08.467\nIt allows me to be able to manage them,\n\n252\n00:13:08.467 --> 00:13:12.362\nto configure them to actually to\nchange what I want in them to run.\n\n253\n00:13:12.362 --> 00:13:18.412\nAnd what that machine does is really\nessentially take all of this hardware and\n\n254\n00:13:18.412 --> 00:13:19.351\nabstract.\n\n255\n00:13:19.351 --> 00:13:23.037\nIn other words,\nrepresent it in software, and\n\n256\n00:13:23.037 --> 00:13:27.410\nthen I can take an operating system and\ninstall it.\n\n257\n00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.490\nWhen the operating system takes a look\nat a software, that software says, hey,\n\n258\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.500\nlook at that.\n\n259\n00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.845\nYou're actually telling me it's hardware,\nand\n\n260\n00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:37.340\nit actually installs in that environment,\nand then I can put whatever\n\n261\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.780\noperating system I want in it, then I can\ninstall my apps just like normal into it.\n\n262\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.960\nAnd now notice that here I'm representing\njust two different operating systems, but\n\n263\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.030\nwe can actually have more\nof them if we choose to.\n\n264\n00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.650\nIt depends, of course, on our hardware.\n\n265\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.200\nBut notice in theory here,\nhere's one operating system,\n\n266\n00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.886\nhere's another operating system,\neach of them either running the same exact\n\n267\n00:13:58.886 --> 00:14:02.306\nthree apps we want to, or\neven different applications.\n\n268\n00:14:02.306 --> 00:14:05.013\nAnd now because it's\nrunning on my machine,\n\n269\n00:14:05.013 --> 00:14:09.215\nI should be able to access both of them\nif I choose to, one in one side and\n\n270\n00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:12.940\none in the other side should be\nable to do that perfectly fine.\n\n271\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.830\nSo it allows me to actually\nuse that hardware much better.\n\n272\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.900\n>> Very good.\nAnd so these would be both running\n\n273\n00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.940\nat the same time, giving us access or\nproviding services at the network\n\n274\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.260\nat the same time, it's just sharing,\nbasically, that hardware.\n\n275\n00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.610\n>> And that's really the key.\n\n276\n00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.850\nIt's the idea of sharing the hardware.\n\n277\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.330\nSo Don actually has a great analogy for\n\n278\n00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.020\nthe idea of use of\nvirtualization technology.\n\n279\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.660\nHe says think about it as carpooling for\ncomputers.\n\n280\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.696\nThat's what he says.\n\n281\n00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:44.370\nThe idea is fairly simple,\nin carpooling, one guy has the car, and\n\n282\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.700\neverybody else loads\ninto it to go to work.\n\n283\n00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.860\nAnd then they're all using the wheels,\nthey're all using the door,\n\n284\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.440\nthe cab, the radio, everything in that\ncar, but they're all individuals.\n\n285\n00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.940\nIf I'm not carpooling, I'm actually\nthe only one using that car, and so\n\n286\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.490\ndon't get me wrong, I like that idea.\n\n287\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.660\nBut a lot of times carpooling does work\nvery well for us, and that's what happens\n\n288\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:10.420\nhere in a virtualized environment for\nwhat we're talking about at this point.\n\n289\n00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.270\nNow believe it or not, we've been\nusing virtualization for a long time.\n\n290\n00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.583\n>> Absolutely right, this is really cool.\n\n291\n00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:18.104\nSo now I know I can take advantage of\nall of those resources that I have,\n\n292\n00:15:18.104 --> 00:15:21.107\nI can just share it amongst\nthese other operating systems.\n\n293\n00:15:21.107 --> 00:15:25.854\nNow I guess the next step then is,\nI'm going to be installing more than one\n\n294\n00:15:25.854 --> 00:15:29.931\noperating system, how do I do that,\nwhat am I creating there?\n\n295\n00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:31.596\n>> When we starting taking a look right,\n\n296\n00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:33.947\nwe're creating exactly what\nwe were talking about.\n\n297\n00:15:33.947 --> 00:15:37.587\nThe very fact is we're going to take\nessentially the hardware that we have and\n\n298\n00:15:37.587 --> 00:15:38.880\nrepresent it in software.\n\n299\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.530\nLet me show you an example here.\n\n300\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:45.740\nSo if you didn't catch it in the slide\nright before this that I made,\n\n301\n00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.940\none of these is actually considered\na VM or a virtual machine.\n\n302\n00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.177\nNow, this is a fairly important concept,\nand here's another one for us.\n\n303\n00:15:55.177 --> 00:15:57.893\nBecause when we normally refer\nto VMs in the IT world, and\n\n304\n00:15:57.893 --> 00:16:00.110\nthat's what we're talking about right now.\n\n305\n00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:05.042\nIn the IT world, We are normally referring\nto taking that entire computer, and\n\n306\n00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:07.913\nthe hardware that's represented there, and\n\n307\n00:16:07.913 --> 00:16:12.070\nmaking up multiple copies of\nthat to run on the same machine.\n\n308\n00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.710\nAnd because each operating system and all\nthose applications are really only taking\n\n309\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.930\nup a little portion of what this\nhardware can actually run and\n\n310\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.700\ndo, it's perfectly fine for\nus to be able to do that.\n\n311\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.340\nSo a VM,\na Virtual Machine is essentially that.\n\n312\n00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.810\nIt's a copy of what we have\nas a hardware a lot of times.\n\n313\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.480\nAnd then,\nwe can represent that in software,\n\n314\n00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.382\nthe operating system that we choose\nto install in there through that\n\n315\n00:16:36.382 --> 00:16:39.749\nVirtual Machine Monitor allows\nus to be able to access it.\n\n316\n00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:44.865\nAnd actually use software representation\nof things like a DVD player or\n\n317\n00:16:44.865 --> 00:16:45.809\na CD player.\n\n318\n00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:50.857\nAnd say all right, you're gonna load up\nan ISO and be able to actually run it.\n\n319\n00:16:50.857 --> 00:16:53.952\nThe operating system just sees it as\nanother physical piece of machinery even\n\n320\n00:16:53.952 --> 00:16:55.310\nthough it's really not.\n\n321\n00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:56.895\nSo it can lie to it.\n\n322\n00:16:56.895 --> 00:16:59.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> So a virtual machine then is a virtual\n\n323\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.730\nrepresentation of a physical machine.\n\n324\n00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.779\nIt would include everything that I\nwould expect in a physical machine.\n\n325\n00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:08.298\nAn operating system,\naccess to resources, hardware,\n\n326\n00:17:08.298 --> 00:17:13.830\napplications that we're gonna install,\nbut all contained, or self contained.\n\n327\n00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:18.740\nAnd then I can run more than one virtual\nmachine on that physical hardware.\n\n328\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.860\n>> And that's actually some terminology\nwe're gonna be getting into as well.\n\n329\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.171\nThe very fact is the idea\nof the virtual machine.\n\n330\n00:17:25.171 --> 00:17:29.190\nIt does see itself as being\nan independent machine.\n\n331\n00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:33.550\nIt doesn't see itself as being tied to the\nphysical hardware that we're seeing right\n\n332\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.370\nhere, or an underlying virtual\nmachine manager, even though it is.\n\n333\n00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.380\nIt sees itself as being\njust another computer.\n\n334\n00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.641\nAnd so that's where it becomes key for\n\n335\n00:17:42.641 --> 00:17:46.670\nus that now if we do have applications\nthat are actually out there for\n\n336\n00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.148\nus to run and we go,\nno we want to run it alone, well we can.\n\n337\n00:17:50.148 --> 00:17:53.540\nWithout actually having to buy a whole\nother machine, se simply go ahead and\n\n338\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.540\nuse that virtual machine manager.\n\n339\n00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.810\nTell it the specifications that we wanna\ncreate an it abstracts the hardware,\n\n340\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.440\nit represents the hardware again and\nwe can do that.\n\n341\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.140\nAnd the nice thing is\nwe can control the way\n\n342\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.010\nthat the abstraction happens with\nour virtual machine monitor.\n\n343\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.311\nWe can tell it how much RAM we have.\n\n344\n00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:09.270\nHow big the hard drive is.\n\n345\n00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.870\nOf course, there's that limitation of\nhow much physical RAM that you have and\n\n346\n00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.970\nhow much physical hard drive that you\nhave, but it gives us that ability.\n\n347\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.000\nAnd because it is actually isolated,\nit has individual machines on this one,\n\n348\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.510\ntwo separate machines, we can say,\nlook, I don't want the machine on\n\n349\n00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.920\nthe left to actually communicate\nwith the machine on the right.\n\n350\n00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.640\nI don't want the machine on\nthe right to actually do this.\n\n351\n00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.700\nSo it doesn't matter.\n\n352\n00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.870\nYou can actually control\nit however you want to.\n\n353\n00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.980\nThe other thing about it\nis it's actually portable.\n\n354\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:38.419\nWe can actually move it from one virtual\nmachine manager that's running the same\n\n355\n00:18:38.419 --> 00:18:39.017\ntype one.\n\n356\n00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:43.160\nTo actually run that same virtual machine\nover on another machine if we wanted to.\n\n357\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.440\nSo it's really a neat technology,\n\n358\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.470\nat least on the surface of what\nwe're actually seeing right now.\n\n359\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.890\nSo virtual machines are really kind\nof the base in what we're seeing.\n\n360\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.630\nNow like I said, Mike, we've actually\nbeen using virtualized technology for\n\n361\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:57.450\na long time.\n\n362\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.530\nAn example of that,\nI just forgot to mention,\n\n363\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.460\nI wanna mention it now, is that if you've\nbeen using a Windows operating system,\n\n364\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.970\nyou've actually been virtualizing, believe\nit or not, something like your RAM.\n\n365\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.080\nA long time, we've been virtualizing RAM.\n\n366\n00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.767\nYou like, gonna how do we virtualize\nphysical RAM chips, yeah.\n\n367\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.760\n>> I'm thinking the page file.\n\n368\n00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.450\n>> Mm hm.\n\n369\n00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:18.450\n>> How about that.\n\n370\n00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:22.150\n>> Yeah, that page file if you remember,\nexactly, right?\n\n371\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.990\nThe very fact is, in that day and\n\n372\n00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:27.010\nage when we ran those machines with,\nwe laugh about this.\n\n373\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.500\nBut 256 megabytes of RAM used to be,\nit used to be a lot.\n\n374\n00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.480\nAccording to Windows it\nwasn't really a lot.\n\n375\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.590\nSo what they actually had to do was say,\nlook we're going say 256 is a lot,\n\n376\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.420\nbut the operating system really\ndoesn't consider it a lot.\n\n377\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.000\nSo what we're going to do is anything\nwe need to actually have as more RAM,\n\n378\n00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.620\neven though we weren't selling\nany more RAM at that point.\n\n379\n00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.420\nWe're gonna actually just spill\nit over onto the hard drive.\n\n380\n00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.380\nAnd so the operating system went ahead and\n\n381\n00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:58.750\nessentially virtualized your physical hard\ndrive and made it represent itself as RAM.\n\n382\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.950\nSo that's an example of\nwhere we've been using it.\n\n383\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.100\nBut there's so\nmany other ones that are out there.\n\n384\n00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.440\nSo it's not a new technology\nlike we were saying.\n\n385\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.067\nBut that's kind of an example of some\nvirtualization that's not a virtual\n\n386\n00:20:09.067 --> 00:20:09.593\nmachine.\n\n387\n00:20:09.593 --> 00:20:12.880\nBut what we're really talking about in\nthe IT world a lot of times is right here.\n\n388\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.382\nIs that we need these types\nof machines to run, so\n\n389\n00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.650\nthat we can take advantage\nof the hardware.\n\n390\n00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.919\nBut we also need the isolation\nthat's also there, and\n\n391\n00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:21.360\nthat's why we might choose this.\n\n392\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.340\nSo, VMs are a very important concept,\nand really kind of the base concept\n\n393\n00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.010\nof all the virtualization\ntechnology we're talking about.\n\n394\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.010\n>> Alright, so\nI think we've got the concept running,\n\n395\n00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.210\nwe've got this physical machine that\nhas just a lot of resources on it.\n\n396\n00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.800\nAnd installing a single\noperating system and\n\n397\n00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.390\na couple applications is not going\nto utilize our hardware fully.\n\n398\n00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.730\nSo I like this concept,\nwe're going to create virtual machines and\n\n399\n00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.184\ngive each one of them\na slice of those resources.\n\n400\n00:20:46.184 --> 00:20:48.930\nAnd now I can run multiple\nvirtual machines and\n\n401\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:54.550\nbetter utilize the hardware that I have\nwhich is always going to be a good thing.\n\n402\n00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.560\nBut I'm probably missing something there.\n\n403\n00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.920\nI've got this virtual machines,\nI've got this physical hardware.\n\n404\n00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.820\nYou keep talking about\nthis layer in-between and\n\n405\n00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.980\nI think that's the piece\nI'm still missing.\n\n406\n00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.400\n>> The piece that we're talking about is\nreally that kind of pink piece that we\n\n407\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.610\nwere actually looking at.\n\n408\n00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.725\nWhich is that virtual machine monitor is\nwhat we're talking, let's go ahead and\n\n409\n00:21:12.725 --> 00:21:13.549\ntake a look and this.\n\n410\n00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:18.110\nAnd I'll get rid of these kind\nof spray paint bottles there.\n\n411\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.500\nGet rid of my own graffiti.\n\n412\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.600\nThe virtual machine monitor, this layer.\n\n413\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.320\nNow remember that this is software.\n\n414\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.190\nSo nothing that we're talking about here\nexcept for the physical hardware right,\n\n415\n00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.080\nrepresents any hardware at all.\n\n416\n00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.380\nThat virtual machine monitor though,\n\n417\n00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.420\ndoes kind of the most\namazing thing in the world.\n\n418\n00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.960\nIt can then take one of\nthose virtual machines and\n\n419\n00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.050\nwhen that virtual machine says I\nneed access to the hard drive.\n\n420\n00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.370\nWell it doesn't actually\nhave a hard drive.\n\n421\n00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:46.110\nIt really, you know it's like,\noh, there's no real hard drive.\n\n422\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.130\nSo what happens is that virtual machine\nmonitor, it takes that and says, look,\n\n423\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.810\nyou need to write to some place?\n\n424\n00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:56.570\nLet me talk to the hardware, and then\nlet's find out how we can get this done.\n\n425\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.390\nAnd then, it actually accesses\nthe hardware to make that\n\n426\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.550\nrepresentation for us.\n\n427\n00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.970\nAnd then sends that information\nback up to that VM that we're on,\n\n428\n00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:04.980\nthe Virtual Machine.\n\n429\n00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.070\nYou'll hear the term VM more\noften than Virtual Machine.\n\n430\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.290\nAnd sends that translation back.\n\n431\n00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.110\nSo it allows for the communication.\n\n432\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.170\nIt's the communication and control piece.\n\n433\n00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.970\nIt translates instructions from\nthis virtualized environment\n\n434\n00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.760\nthat Windows is running on into\nthe physical environment and\n\n435\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.290\nthen sends the control down\nto be able to do that.\n\n436\n00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.620\nThat layer in between is very important.\n\n437\n00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.560\nThe technical term here is\na virtual machine monitor.\n\n438\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.240\nYou may also hear the term\nhypervisor as well.\n\n439\n00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.910\nThose two terms really do go hand in hand,\ndepending on who you're talking to.\n\n440\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.620\nSo don't get picky.\n\n441\n00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.550\nDon't sit there and go,\n\n442\n00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:45.570\nwell Ronnie said it was a virtual\nmachine monitor not a hypervisor.\n\n443\n00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.630\nI didn't say that.\n\n444\n00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.170\nAnd then all of a sudden your\nboss is gonna look at you like,\n\n445\n00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.580\nyeah maybe you shouldn't\nlisten to Ronnie too much.\n\n446\n00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.000\nBut overall just kinda realize\nit really means the same thing.\n\n447\n00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.330\nSo and the technology behind each\nof those is a little bit different\n\n448\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.130\ndepending on when you got into\nthe virtualization world.\n\n449\n00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:08.280\nThe reason why we also worry about\nthis particular slice in between\n\n450\n00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.730\nis because the earlier editions of\nthis thing didn't really do that.\n\n451\n00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.980\nIt essentially lied to those machines.\n\n452\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.960\nIn this way, it would actually be\nable to do exactly what I told you.\n\n453\n00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.890\nBut it had to do it in\na round about process.\n\n454\n00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:26.040\nAnd it did it in a way of modifying what\nwas actually right here inside of that\n\n455\n00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.180\nvirtual machine saying,\nyeah let's just go ahead and\n\n456\n00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.510\npretend like you're doing it, and\nI'll handle the rest in the background.\n\n457\n00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.930\nAnd that actually caused\na lot of extraneous overhead.\n\n458\n00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.580\nAnd now it's stuff that just had to run.\n\n459\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.410\nAnd it took up more resources than it\nneeded to on the physical hardware.\n\n460\n00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:45.150\nAnd so it really did end up translating\nit into different tables that then got\n\n461\n00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.760\ntranslated onto the hardware.\n\n462\n00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.730\nSo it had to do it twice, so\n\n463\n00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.080\nthere was a lot of overhead in\nearly virtual machines here.\n\n464\n00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.962\nSo the newer ones, though, don't do that.\n\n465\n00:23:52.962 --> 00:23:57.749\nThey actually take advantage of the way\nthat hardware vendors have also\n\n466\n00:23:57.749 --> 00:24:00.311\ngiven access to the CPU's and stuff.\n\n467\n00:24:00.311 --> 00:24:05.300\nTo be able to make this much, much faster,\nbut older virtual machines used to really\n\n468\n00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.467\nbe, well, insanely slow,\nis what they used to be compared to today.\n\n469\n00:24:09.467 --> 00:24:13.862\nThey're at what we call near physical\nperformance, is what we have,\n\n470\n00:24:13.862 --> 00:24:18.250\nso, or parity, near parity\nperformance is what you also hear.\n\n471\n00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.190\n>> So HyperVisor or virtual machine\nmonitor, that's really where the magic\n\n472\n00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:26.260\nhappens, that's what allows us\nto virtualize that hardware and\n\n473\n00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.000\nexpose it to the different virtual\nmachines that we're gonna create.\n\n474\n00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.100\nNow, some other terms, Ronnie, that I've\nheard thrown about that I want you to\n\n475\n00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.650\nclear up for me, I hear host machines,\nand I hear guest machines.\n\n476\n00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.430\nWhat are they talking about there?\n\n477\n00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.380\n>> Yeah, whenever you hear\nthe term host OS, and guest OS,\n\n478\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.200\nespecially when you start reading articles\nabout this, what they're referring to of\n\n479\n00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:54.030\ncourse is the relationship between that\nvirtual machine and the physical hardware.\n\n480\n00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:57.990\nNow there's a lot of times, especially in\nthe very beginnings that we talked about,\n\n481\n00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.770\nwhat used to happen was simple,\n\n482\n00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:06.680\nyou'd load on that operating\nsystem onto the physical hardware.\n\n483\n00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.900\nAnd then you would take your\nvirtual machine monitor and\n\n484\n00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.060\nyou'd load it on there as an application.\n\n485\n00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.880\nAnd then inside that is where you\nwould build your virtual machines.\n\n486\n00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.440\nOkay?\n\n487\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.030\nNow being able to do something like that,\n\n488\n00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.780\nthey had to be able to distinguish,\nwell which machine are you referring to?\n\n489\n00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.920\nSo in other words,\nare you referring, like,\n\n490\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.750\nif I need to do a configuration change.\n\n491\n00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.870\nWell when I'm running let's\nsay on my physical hardware,\n\n492\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.140\nlet's say I'm running Windows 8.\n\n493\n00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:38.120\nAnd then I add in a VMM,\na virtual machine monitor on there, and\n\n494\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.610\nthen I run a virtual machine that's also\nrunning Windows 8, well if I tell you to\n\n495\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.430\ngo and configure something,\nwhere are you gonna configure it?\n\n496\n00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.400\nAre you gonna configure on\nthe machine that's the hardware?\n\n497\n00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.660\nOr are you gonna configure\nit inside of the VM?\n\n498\n00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.130\nSo in the terminology inside the\nvirtualization, they decided to refer to\n\n499\n00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.240\nit in two different ways\ndepending on how this happens.\n\n500\n00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.790\nThe host OS okay, when you hear\nthat term host operating system,\n\n501\n00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:06.086\nis the one that's directly running on\nthe physical hardware itself okay?\n\n502\n00:26:06.086 --> 00:26:09.680\nSo if you actually do need to make\nconfiguration changes to the host,\n\n503\n00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.690\nthat's what they're referring to.\n\n504\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.900\nBut if you say in the guest OS,\nyou're normally referring to that\n\n505\n00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.640\nvirtual machine operating system that's\nrunning inside of that virtual machine.\n\n506\n00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.240\nAnd any of them can actually be guest or\nhost OSs today.\n\n507\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.970\nAnd most of the operating systems that we\ntend to see running, especially in 2015,\n\n508\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.280\nso it doesn't matter.\n\n509\n00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.078\nBut you do need to know that terminology.\n\n510\n00:26:34.078 --> 00:26:39.710\nSometimes though, you end up seeing that,\nwhether it's the guest or the host OS, it\n\n511\n00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.330\ncan become a little bit tricky as we get\ninto the different types of virtualization\n\n512\n00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.990\ntechnologies that are out there a little\nbit more, because they can be a little bit\n\n513\n00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.860\ntricky out there and then, but\nthat's what it's normally referring to.\n\n514\n00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.510\nIs it the one on the physical machine or\nis actually inside of the VM?\n\n515\n00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.250\n>> So I've got my host OS for now.\n\n516\n00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.470\nWe're going to say the host OS is what's\nbeen installed on the physical hardware\n\n517\n00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:05.420\nand then each one of those VMs that I\ncreate is my guest operating system and\n\n518\n00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.378\nso I can have multiple guests but I'm\ngoing to have one host operating system.\n\n519\n00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:12.350\n>> Normally that's exactly what\nwould end up happening and\n\n520\n00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.410\nwe're going to end up seeing\nsome other technologies.\n\n521\n00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.317\nIt's going to be a little\nbit more confusing.\n\n522\n00:27:16.317 --> 00:27:17.885\n>> Oh no.\n>> Yeah, as you get in there,\n\n523\n00:27:17.885 --> 00:27:22.241\nbecause then you actually, you'll see\nlater on like when we get into hyper V,\n\n524\n00:27:22.241 --> 00:27:25.547\nthere's actually going to be\na parent OS versus a child OS.\n\n525\n00:27:25.547 --> 00:27:29.167\nAnd so yeah, they're all virtualized at\nthat point, and you're like why, why, but\n\n526\n00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:32.704\nit's just the way the technology develops,\nand that's what you have to deal with.\n\n527\n00:27:32.704 --> 00:27:34.400\nSo you can't just sit there and\ngo, I don't like that.\n\n528\n00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.027\nWell you can,\nyou can pick a different product, but\n\n529\n00:27:37.027 --> 00:27:39.570\nyou just have to get\nused to the terminology.\n\n530\n00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.690\nAnd Mike, you and I being in the IT\nworld right, we learn new terminology.\n\n531\n00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.720\nAs much as we don't like them,\n\n532\n00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.718\nyou still have to use them cuz\nthat's what the industry uses.\n\n533\n00:27:46.718 --> 00:27:47.867\n>> Yeah.\n>> So that's what we're doing here today.\n\n534\n00:27:47.867 --> 00:27:49.760\n>> Absolutely.\n\n535\n00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.340\nNow Ronnie, so I love it.\n\n536\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:56.080\nI wanna get into this virtualization,\nI've got a laptop or I've got a server\n\n537\n00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.730\nsitting at home, or a desktop sitting\nthere, I want to do virtualization, can I?\n\n538\n00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.200\nDoes it matter what hardware I have?\n\n539\n00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.950\n>> Hardware is a very important part\nof what we are actually needing to do.\n\n540\n00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.460\nAnd you'll actually end up seeing\nthat most of the time in today's\n\n541\n00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.980\nenvironment, right?\n\n542\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.730\nYou go, hey, I want to get started.\n\n543\n00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.360\nYou can go out there and\ndo your favorite search engine and\n\n544\n00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.620\njust type in virtualization.\n\n545\n00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.420\nOr how do I create VMs?\n\n546\n00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.830\nAnd you'll get a myriad of\nproducts that are out there.\n\n547\n00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.800\nThe key though, for you running the we're\nactually gonna see later on, in episodes,\n\n548\n00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.350\nwe're gonna pick kind of the most\npopular ones and show them.\n\n549\n00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.560\nBut there's tons of them out there, okay?\n\n550\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.740\nThe key is, can your machine run it?\n\n551\n00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.170\nOkay, and that's really the key.\n\n552\n00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.700\nSo you do need to look at those hardware\nrequirements that are on that machine.\n\n553\n00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.750\nAnd one of the big hardware\nrequirements that you're gonna find out\n\n554\n00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:45.430\nis what we call hardware\nassisted virtualization.\n\n555\n00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.840\nSo this is a terminology that you just\ndefinitely have to be able to know\n\n556\n00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.990\nwhen you do this.\n\n557\n00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.900\nSome virtualization technology doesn't\ncare, it does not care at all whether or\n\n558\n00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.950\nnot it does hardware\nassisted virtualization.\n\n559\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.070\nBut those are normally\nthe older technologies.\n\n560\n00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.120\nMost of the new ones today say yes,\nyou have to have it.\n\n561\n00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.710\nSo what the heck does that do for\nus and why do we really care?\n\n562\n00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.970\nIf you remember just a moment ago I\nhad described to you that the earlier\n\n563\n00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.960\nvirtualization technology,\nwell it was a very slow process.\n\n564\n00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.490\nIt did exactly what we needed to do.\n\n565\n00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.220\nIt allowed us to do the virtualization\nwhich was the coolest thing in the world.\n\n566\n00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.570\nBut the performance hit on some of\nthose machines really did make it\n\n567\n00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.970\nkinda of not actually\nviable in some situations.\n\n568\n00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.627\nSo in the earliest days, we used to say\nokay we'll use it in a test environment\n\n569\n00:29:29.627 --> 00:29:33.176\nbut no, we don't ever wanna count on\nproduction environment where we're\n\n570\n00:29:33.176 --> 00:29:36.910\ndepending on that machine because it's so\nslow by comparison.\n\n571\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.490\nHardware assisted\nvirtualization changes that.\n\n572\n00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.910\nIt changed it because\na hardware vendor said, man,\n\n573\n00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.740\nwe like this idea of\nthe virtualization technology.\n\n574\n00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:50.400\nSo what we'll do is we'll allow for\nthat VMM, that virtual machine monitor, to\n\n575\n00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.790\nreally be able to translate instructions\nalmost directly into the hardware itself.\n\n576\n00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.270\nSo it is amazing in what it does.\n\n577\n00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.400\nIt actually allows for\naccess into the CPU, into the RAM, and\n\n578\n00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.750\nevery place that allows\nhim to be able to do so.\n\n579\n00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.410\nSo let me give you an example\non why this is important.\n\n580\n00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.260\nWith something like the hardware\nassisted virtualization,\n\n581\n00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.440\nexample of RAM is actually\nthe easiest thing to do.\n\n582\n00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.350\nWithout it here's what happens right.\n\n583\n00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.240\nInside of that VM,\nwell where is your RAM actually located?\n\n584\n00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.130\nWell it's actually inside of that VM and\n\n585\n00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.490\nthat virtual machine manager is\njust lying to the virtual machine.\n\n586\n00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.110\nIt's saying,\nyeah you have access to this RAM\n\n587\n00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:30.790\nas translating into whatever\nthe language is on the VMM.\n\n588\n00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.690\nThe VMM then has to take some time and\nthen go,\n\n589\n00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:38.270\nokay now that I've translated from that\nVM, I need to translate it back into\n\n590\n00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.540\nsome type of binary code that\nthe CPU is going to understand.\n\n591\n00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.360\nAnd then that actually writes it into CPU,\n\n592\n00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.530\nCPU then gets to access RAM,\nchanges it back.\n\n593\n00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:49.910\nComes back to the VM, or the VMM, the\nvirtual machine monitor says here you go,\n\n594\n00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:50.910\nhere's all the binary code.\n\n595\n00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:55.300\nOh, crud, I gotta translate it back in for\nthat VM that should be able to run.\n\n596\n00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.470\nSo you think about it,\nthat's a two step process.\n\n597\n00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.785\nThat's why even accessing RAM took\na long time when you did that.\n\n598\n00:31:01.785 --> 00:31:04.370\nHardware assisted virtualization says,\noh, no, no, no.\n\n599\n00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.110\nLet's do this.\n\n600\n00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.700\nOkay?\n\n601\n00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.920\nWe'll actually make the code\navailable inside of the VMM so\n\n602\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.060\nthat the VMM can say, hey,\nwhen that virtual machine writes it,\n\n603\n00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.580\nyou're actually writing to\nthis table that I've created.\n\n604\n00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.070\nBut the table directly maps\nto the physical hardware.\n\n605\n00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.020\nSo that way, when you are writing that,\n\n606\n00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.620\nit literally is actually able to\ntranslate it directly into that physical.\n\n607\n00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.560\nAnd then the physical can send it back,\nand the VM says, oh, look at that.\n\n608\n00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.640\nThis is exactly what I was\ngonna tell you anyways.\n\n609\n00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.250\nSo I hand it back, and\nit makes it so much faster.\n\n610\n00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.110\nAnd this is true of the CPU,\nof the RAM and\n\n611\n00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:35.700\neven of hard drive space\nthat it needs to access.\n\n612\n00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.630\nSo that's what gives us the near\nphysical performance, or the idea of\n\n613\n00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.170\nparity performance that we would have and\nthat's why you wanna have it.\n\n614\n00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.500\nSo what does that mean for\nyou getting started?\n\n615\n00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.192\nWell, one, you want to make sure that\nyour CPU of course has that technology\n\n616\n00:31:48.192 --> 00:31:49.179\navailable, okay.\n\n617\n00:31:49.179 --> 00:31:53.221\nAnd the way that you see that is if\nyou're running an Intel based computer,\n\n618\n00:31:53.221 --> 00:31:57.735\nyou can look for something that's called\nIntel VT, virtualization technology.\n\n619\n00:31:57.735 --> 00:31:59.418\nAnd it's easy enough, right?\n\n620\n00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:04.830\nIf you need to, just do a Google search\nlike I did, and see your processor name.\n\n621\n00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:09.760\nAnd type in hardware assisted\nvirtualization, and see if it comes up.\n\n622\n00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.210\nIntel has a list of all of their\nCPUs that support this, so\n\n623\n00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.790\nyou can go to Intel and\nfind that list, as well.\n\n624\n00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.610\nBut what about AMD?\n\n625\n00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:22.460\nAMD also has the ability to do it, and\n\n626\n00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:27.460\ntheir technology is called AMD-V for\nvirtualization.\n\n627\n00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.890\nNow, their particular list is\na little bit more unusual,\n\n628\n00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.801\nthey literally separated it out by the\ntype of virtualization that you're doing.\n\n629\n00:32:35.801 --> 00:32:37.436\nAnd it's not as easy to find.\n\n630\n00:32:37.436 --> 00:32:44.206\nIntel just says, you wanna see all the\nones that support, or is Intel VT enabled?\n\n631\n00:32:44.206 --> 00:32:45.520\nYou can go and do that.\n\n632\n00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.260\nThat's what I did,\nlist of Intel VT enabled CPUs,\n\n633\n00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.510\nand it came right up with the first or\nsecond link there.\n\n634\n00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.259\nOn AMD, though, it gave me a list, but\n\n635\n00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:56.811\nonly the ones that are actually\nable to run on Windows 8.\n\n636\n00:32:56.811 --> 00:32:59.527\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm not criticizing AMD, I'm saying\n\n637\n00:32:59.527 --> 00:33:03.883\nthat theirs is kind of broken out\na little bit more categorically, I guess.\n\n638\n00:33:03.883 --> 00:33:04.881\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n639\n00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:05.580\n>> A little bit more.\nBut yeah,\n\n640\n00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.340\nyou wanna make sure that it\nsupports that right away, as well.\n\n641\n00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.670\nThere's some other things\nthat are out there, but\n\n642\n00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:13.510\nit just depends on how advanced\nyou get into virtualization.\n\n643\n00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.530\nBut that's kind of the main component.\n\n644\n00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.620\nAnd even if you do have it,\nwhere do you actually enable it?\n\n645\n00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.310\nYou have to go into BiOS,\nturn those features on, and\n\n646\n00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:24.170\nthen you're ready to go for whatever\nvirtualization technology you wanna run.\n\n647\n00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.340\n>> So that hardware systems virtualization\nsounds like it's really streamlining\n\n648\n00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.100\nthe access that the virtual machines\nare getting to that physical hardware,\n\n649\n00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:37.890\njust making it a little smoother, a little\nmore transparent and more efficient.\n\n650\n00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.080\n>> By far, and that's the key behind this.\n\n651\n00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.040\nCan you actually turn that off and\nmake it run?\n\n652\n00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.200\nSome of the technologies you can, but\nthe majority of them, not anymore.\n\n653\n00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.500\nAnd it goes into a lot of other issues,\nand\n\n654\n00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.310\nwe're just trying to get used to the\nterminology right now, but we'll probably\n\n655\n00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.880\nsee some of those issues as we go along,\nas we start introducing you to some of\n\n656\n00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.420\nthe more popular technologies that you'll\nend up seeing inside a virtualization or\n\n657\n00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.880\nrunning virtualization for\nan IT shop of some sort.\n\n658\n00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.310\n>> Fantastic Ronnie love it.\n\n659\n00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:08.350\nReally think we're getting\na grips on virtualization.\n\n660\n00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:12.940\nA lot of the important terminology that\nwe need to get started, hypervisor, and\n\n661\n00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.800\nvirtual machine, monitor.\n\n662\n00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.670\nWe talked about the operating system.\n\n663\n00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.650\nYou got the host operating system.\n\n664\n00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.180\nYou got the guest operating system.\n\n665\n00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:24.830\nThe concept of a virtual machine and\nwhat it's doing, how it's virtualizing\n\n666\n00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:29.570\naccess to that physical hardware so that\nwe can take advantage of these resources.\n\n667\n00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:33.150\nWe're buying machines and\nbuilding machines nowadays that can do so\n\n668\n00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.390\nmuch more than run a single operating\nsystem and a few applications.\n\n669\n00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:41.290\nYou're just not gonna take advantage of\nall the resources you have available, so\n\n670\n00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.438\nthis virtualization really\ngives us that ability.\n\n671\n00:34:44.438 --> 00:34:46.360\nAnd we talked about that.\n\n672\n00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.840\nHardware system virtualization, that's\nkind of streamlining that access that\n\n673\n00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.490\nthe VMs have to the physical hardware,\nwhich is making the performance on these\n\n674\n00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:59.450\nVMs comparable to what I would\nget out of a physical machine.\n\n675\n00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.870\nSo it's getting to the point now, or it is\nto the point I should say, it's been that\n\n676\n00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:07.950\nway, to the point where, I mean, these\nvirtual machines, they're just as good\n\n677\n00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:12.380\nin most respects as a physical machine\nand, in many respects, they're better.\n\n678\n00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.650\nThey have a lot of advantages that we\ndon't get with that physical hardware.\n\n679\n00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:21.080\nSo thanks, Ronnie, for that great look,\nthe explanation of all those terms.\n\n680\n00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.750\nI think we got a good handle on it.\n\n681\n00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.370\nLooking forward to more episodes\nwhere you can dive even deeper\n\n682\n00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:30.070\ninto the world of virtualization and\nsee how all of this stuff works, and\n\n683\n00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.930\nwe can take advantage of it and\nwork with it in our workplace.\n\n684\n00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.980\nSo thanks for that, Ronnie, but\nfor this one we are out of time.\n\n685\n00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.800\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n686\n00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.645\n>> And I'm Ronny Wong\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n687\n00:35:41.645 --> 00:35:46.170\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:20.840\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're looking virtualization technologies.\n\n4\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.560\nAnd, specifically, we're gonna take\na look at some of the benefits\n\n5\n00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.630\nas well as the limitations\nof virtualization.\n\n6\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.350\nVirtualization is a fantastic thing,\n\n7\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.570\nit's something that you're gonna see in\njust about every Enterprise environment.\n\n8\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.660\nThere are a lot of benefits\nthat go on with virtualization,\n\n9\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.840\nbut there are also some limitations\nthat we have to consider.\n\n10\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.893\nAnd with me today to help us work through\nthe benefits and limitations, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:44.730\nRonnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.750\nHow are you doing, Ronnie?\n\n13\n00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.840\n>> I am doing fine.\n\n14\n00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.060\nThere's no doubt that in\na previous episode we really did,\n\n15\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.780\nwe talked up like VM it was the greatest\nthing in the world since sliced bread, and\n\n16\n00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.800\nyou heard us saying this is what you want\nto do, and hopefully you got excited and\n\n17\n00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.400\ngo, man, I really want to try that.\n\n18\n00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.010\nAnd you're probably gonna end up seeing\nthat as you work in the IT world, right,\n\n19\n00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.400\nfor any particular company\nthat you work for,\n\n20\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.520\nyou're probably gonna hear people\nreferring to virtualization.\n\n21\n00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.560\nAnd the good thing is you can,\nyou can try it right at home,\n\n22\n00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.346\nyou can also see it in your workplace.\n\n23\n00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:17.480\nBut even so, right, as neat as it sounds,\nwe do actually have to discuss those\n\n24\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.500\nbenefits a little bit more,\nlearn a little bit more technology, but\n\n25\n00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.290\nalso understand that it's not\na cure-all for everything, right?\n\n26\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.910\nAnd that we also have some\nlimitations behind them.\n\n27\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.000\nAnd all that, of course,\n\n28\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.080\ndeals in terms of the way that we\nuse the virtualization technology.\n\n29\n00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.540\nI know, like me,\nthe very first time I tried it, I for\n\n30\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.670\nsome reason did not understand the idea\nthat there had to be limitations.\n\n31\n00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.630\nAnd so you keep building the machines,\nyou keep building, and\n\n32\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.900\nthen you go and build one more cuz you\nthink I can build another one, and\n\n33\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.060\nit tells you there's not enough resources\navailable for what you have in mind.\n\n34\n00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.406\nAnd then you're like, okay and then you\ntry and run all of them and then you go,\n\n35\n00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:59.060\noh look, there's not enough resources\nin mind for you to be able to do that.\n\n36\n00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.550\nAnd you also run into those issues\nwhere you turn it on and realize, oh,\n\n37\n00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.090\nI gotta do more to get them ready.\n\n38\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.140\nSo we do need to make\nsure that we understand,\n\n39\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.940\nin terms of virtualization, what are those\nbenefits that we'll find in the personal\n\n40\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.830\nworld as well as in the business world?\n\n41\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.390\nAnd then we also wanna talk about\nthose different types of usage\n\n42\n00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.500\nlimitations as well.\n\n43\n00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.530\n>> All right, Ronnie, well let's start\noff talking about some of the benefits,\n\n44\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.230\nsome of the reasons that we\nwant to use virtualization.\n\n45\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.610\nAnd what are some of the things\nthat drive these organizations\n\n46\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.485\nas well as the home user or\nmaybe the home user to virtualization?\n\n47\n00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:36.220\nWhenever we start taking a look\nat the idea of virtualization and\n\n48\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.310\nwhy we choose to use it,\n\n49\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.880\nI think that home use is actually\nprobably the way to start right away.\n\n50\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.106\nNow, let me go ahead and give you\nan example of how I started using it and\n\n51\n00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:46.360\ngetting understanding into it, as well.\n\n52\n00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.550\nSo as I started doing training and\nlearning how to do some of the things in\n\n53\n00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.470\nthe IT world so\nI could get a job in the IT world,\n\n54\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.290\nI kept hearing from my instructors, hey,\nyou need to have this machine running,\n\n55\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.930\nyou need to be able to actually do this,\nyou need to do this.\n\n56\n00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.980\nAnd I was like, that sounds like a lot\nof hardware that I'd have to buy.\n\n57\n00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.982\nAnd then you start planning it out and you\nrealize you've got a hardware budget of 0.\n\n58\n00:03:06.982 --> 00:03:07.764\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For\n\n59\n00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:09.920\nyou to be able to do stuff like this.\n\n60\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.160\nAnd that's when you kind of realize,\nwhat would be great is if I could do that.\n\n61\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.680\nAnd that was one of the neatest\nthat I remember during my schooling\n\n62\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.250\nis one of my instructors\nactually bringing it up here and\n\n63\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.650\nsaying, hey, here's how you can actually\nrun two machines at the same time.\n\n64\n00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.370\nAnd I was like oh, that's intriguing cuz\nthat now actually allowed me to have\n\n65\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.080\ntwo computers running on the very\nsame computer at one time.\n\n66\n00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.700\nAnd so now I had some benefit that I\ncould now justify and spend a little\n\n67\n00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.225\nbit of money, and buying virtualization\ntechnology to help me do so.\n\n68\n00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:42.570\n>> Yeah, I remember going through\nthose same things, Ronnie,\n\n69\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.740\nespecially with like beta\nversions of operating systems.\n\n70\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.180\nAs an instructor or trainer,\nwe had to be ready when\n\n71\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.095\nthat new operating system came out,\nwe couldn't wait for it to roll out and\n\n72\n00:03:53.095 --> 00:03:56.915\nit's gold, we had to be playing with\nit early on, as it's coming out.\n\n73\n00:03:56.915 --> 00:04:01.220\nI remember installing a beta\noperating system on your computer and\n\n74\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.530\nnot everything works and\nyou get little glitches here and there.\n\n75\n00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.690\nWith virtualization,\nI was able to take those beta versions,\n\n76\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.050\nthrow them in a VM,\nrun them, play with them.\n\n77\n00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.040\nBut when the day was done, I could shut\nthat VM down, and I was still running\n\n78\n00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.280\na good stable operating system on my\nlaptop so I could do the rest of the work.\n\n79\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.790\nSo it was a really big\nhelp in that respect.\n\n80\n00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.720\n>> I also saw the same thing when I\nactually ended up getting a job and then\n\n81\n00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.990\nall of a sudden someone said, hey, here's\na piece of software we've been using for\n\n82\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.990\nten years now, and I can't get it\nto install on Vista, it won't work.\n\n83\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.020\nWhat can I do to keep it running?\n\n84\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.050\nAnd one of the benefits that I\nactually started realizing is,\n\n85\n00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.230\nwith the use of virtualization,\nI can bring up that old XP system or\n\n86\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.000\neven that Windows 2000 system, that that\nparticular application was running on, and\n\n87\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.890\nthen I could install that application\nin that Windows 2000 system and\n\n88\n00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.800\nit didn't interfere with the Windows Vista\nsystem that was running.\n\n89\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.980\nSo it gave me the ability to bring in\nthings like legacy applications so that I\n\n90\n00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.310\ncould actually run that one application\nthat needed running that wouldn't actually\n\n91\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.650\nfit in with the rest of the shop that had\nactually upgraded all the way to Vista.\n\n92\n00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.840\nAnd you're probably saying, why in\nthe world would you upgrade to Vista?\n\n93\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.587\nWell, it's what we did.\n\n94\n00:05:11.587 --> 00:05:13.326\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It wasn't like,\n\n95\n00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:15.220\nI think we should forgo this.\n\n96\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.270\nIt was like okay,\n\n97\n00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.580\nyou're working that shop, and then that's\nwhen you realize that the application\n\n98\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.950\nthat you thought would run perfectly\nis no longer being supported.\n\n99\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.700\nSo legacy applications for someone,\neven in the personal world, right?\n\n100\n00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.980\nYou might have older application\nthat you have at home,\n\n101\n00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.820\nsay it doesn't run on my new Windows 10.\n\n102\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.540\nWell, you have that ability to bring\nup a virtualization platform, and\n\n103\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.760\nthen be able to install an older operating\nsystem on it and get it running, and\n\n104\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.520\nbe able to use it,\njust like you did in the past.\n\n105\n00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.910\n>> And that's a great thing cuz now I\ndon't have to maintain that older piece of\n\n106\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.040\nhardware that might be hard to\nfind parts for at this point.\n\n107\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.900\nI have to support that older hardware,\nthat older operating system.\n\n108\n00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.500\nWe can now kinda consolidate,\nwe can run that new operating system, yet\n\n109\n00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.370\nstill provide an environment for\nthat older application to run.\n\n110\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.270\nSo we can consolidate stuff.\n\n111\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.600\nAnd then, Ronnie,\nI know going through, you and\n\n112\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.610\nI both have done a lot of\nofficial Microsoft training.\n\n113\n00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.030\nAnd I remember the first few classes\nthat came out where, back in the day,\n\n114\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.210\nwe had to set up physical hardware for\neach student to sit at.\n\n115\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.970\nAnd then all of a sudden we were able to\nstart creating these virtual machines\n\n116\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.760\nwhere each student had their own\ndomain controller and DNS server and\n\n117\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.500\nDHCP server, and that was all thanks to\nvirtualization, so it was a training aid.\n\n118\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.790\n>> It really was.\n\n119\n00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.780\nThe idea of being able to use this in\ntraining, just like what Mike said,\n\n120\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.700\nwhether we're talking about beta operating\nsystems that we're just trying to get\n\n121\n00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.850\nfamiliar with or whether we're doing some\ntype of official training, instead of\n\n122\n00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.210\nsplitting up resources and classes and\nsaying, Mike, you're gonna actually only\n\n123\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.390\nbe able to do this portion of the lab\nthat we're gonna be doing together.\n\n124\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.053\nOh, yeah, that's right, Titus, you're\nonly gonna be able to do this portion.\n\n125\n00:06:52.053 --> 00:06:55.160\nI'm sorry it's kind of like at the very\nend and shutting down the machines,\n\n126\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.910\nbut sometimes you had to do that with that\nphysical machine if you didn't have that.\n\n127\n00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.820\nBut now, with the advent of virtualization\ntechnologies for stuff like that,\n\n128\n00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.540\nwe were actually able to, and\nMike can testify to this, if we had 10,\n\n129\n00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.880\n12 students in our classes, each one would\nactually have access to the full entire\n\n130\n00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.710\nlab of equipment that we would\nhave to set up those machines for.\n\n131\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.230\nAnd that way every student felt like that\nthey weren't only doing a portion or\n\n132\n00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.272\njust seeing what the portions were,\nor just figuring out a portion of it,\n\n133\n00:07:23.272 --> 00:07:26.210\nthey were actually able to do\neverything that they needed to do.\n\n134\n00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.470\nAnd that really does help out when\nyou start talking about the ideas of\n\n135\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.730\ntraining here, to be able to do so.\n\n136\n00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.810\nAnd even if nothing else,\nright, along with that,\n\n137\n00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.440\nthere's things like testing\nenvironment that, you go, hey,\n\n138\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.940\nanybody have an extra machine that I can\ngo ahead and start testing this out cuz\n\n139\n00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.610\nwe're really having some issues\nwith this application on the floor?\n\n140\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.370\nAnd there's not a machine available.\n\n141\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.847\nBeing able to put it into a virtual\nmachine may be a way that you can test out\n\n142\n00:07:51.847 --> 00:07:54.185\nconfigurations, stuff like that,\nas well, so\n\n143\n00:07:54.185 --> 00:07:57.392\nthere are quite a few different\nbenefits that we can take a look at.\n\n144\n00:07:57.392 --> 00:08:01.361\n>> Absolutely, and we talk about when\nyou're testing, you want to roll out a new\n\n145\n00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:05.211\napplication or some configuration changes\nthat you want to do on a machine or\n\n146\n00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:06.974\non a network with an application.\n\n147\n00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:08.920\nYou try to mimic your\nproduction environment.\n\n148\n00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.350\nAnd that would mean\nhaving separate hardware\n\n149\n00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.630\nthat mimicked what we had in\nour production environment,\n\n150\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.370\nand that can be really expensive, and\na lot of small shops can't afford that.\n\n151\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:24.260\nWith virtualization, now I can set up\nthat copy of my production environment,\n\n152\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.640\nand I can try that change out before\nI go and roll it into production.\n\n153\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.450\nSo really nice benefits there.\n\n154\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.910\n>> Yeah, so in the personal side you\ncan see where one individual could take\n\n155\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.560\nadvantage of virtualization in multiple\nways, depending on how it's implemented.\n\n156\n00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.860\nNow, when we start moving into\nthe business environment though,\n\n157\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.270\nthis is where we might not have\nyou know a lot of experience in.\n\n158\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.260\nSo if you've already built\nvirtual machines and\n\n159\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.890\nyou're using it in a testing\nenvironment like we've done, great.\n\n160\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.130\nThat's exactly what some of our benefits\nare, and that's why we do end up\n\n161\n00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.190\nloving it, and the very fact that we can\nquickly bring up multiple machines and\n\n162\n00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.680\nget them networked together, and\nget them actually running what we want to.\n\n163\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.180\nBeing able to see that,\nlike what Mike said, is absolutely great.\n\n164\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.090\nBut what about in a business environment?\n\n165\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.280\nThat's what we'd really\nwanna focus in on as well.\n\n166\n00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.880\nSo, why in the world would a business\nchoose to do something like that is what\n\n167\n00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.080\nwe're talking about here.\n\n168\n00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.660\n>> Right, now Ronnie,\nwhat about if I've got one machine or\n\n169\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.290\nan application maybe that is just busy?\n\n170\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.730\nIt uses a lot of resources.\n\n171\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.180\nCan virtualization help me there?\n\n172\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.660\n>> It really can because a lot of times\nthe reason why it's actually doing that is\n\n173\n00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.600\nbecause that application is competing for\nresources\n\n174\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.240\nwith another application that's competing\nfor resources, with other applications\n\n175\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.520\nthat are running in the background, that's\nactually using that same shared resources.\n\n176\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.630\nInstead with the virtualization,\nwe can bring up a new virtual machine and\n\n177\n00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.600\nthen take that one application,\nand essentially isolate it so\n\n178\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.380\nit runs by itself, and it sees\nitself as being the only thing using\n\n179\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.850\nthe resources available\nto that virtual machine.\n\n180\n00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.118\nIn other words, it sees itself as\nbeing no competition at all and\n\n181\n00:09:58.118 --> 00:10:00.185\nit can gain access to whatever it can do.\n\n182\n00:10:00.185 --> 00:10:04.256\nNow there are some limitations there,\nwhich we'll talk about in a little bit,\n\n183\n00:10:04.256 --> 00:10:08.143\nbut overall though it really can help us\nto do that, that idea of isolating so\n\n184\n00:10:08.143 --> 00:10:11.303\nthat an application can get\naccess to all those benefits, and\n\n185\n00:10:11.303 --> 00:10:13.530\nwe'll talk about that as well in a moment.\n\n186\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.258\nSo you're actually hearing some\ndifferent terms that we're using, but\n\n187\n00:10:16.258 --> 00:10:18.290\njust realize of that, and\nwe'll go over these terms.\n\n188\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.230\nThe isolation and consolidation that\nwe're talking about in a moment.\n\n189\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.390\n>> And what about from\nthe administrative standpoint?\n\n190\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.120\nDo I see any benefits there?\n\n191\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.510\n>> You definitely can.\n\n192\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.200\nThe big benefit is what Mike\neven told you about as well.\n\n193\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.190\nLet's say that Mike wants to implement\na change throughout the entire network.\n\n194\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.490\nBut he's not sure if there is actually\ngonna be some different effects.\n\n195\n00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.810\nWell, Mike can at least take a small\nportion of his network and actually mimic\n\n196\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.440\nhow he believes that that change is gonna\npopulate and migrate all the way through.\n\n197\n00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.750\nAnd he instead can actually implement\nit in an isolated environment,\n\n198\n00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.720\nadministratively.\n\n199\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.170\nThat way he goes, look, I wanna implement\nthis, but I don't wanna do it and\n\n200\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.610\nthen cause so many different changes,\nand crash so many machines.\n\n201\n00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.040\nLet me take the time to actually\nrun through the process here and\n\n202\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.570\nbe able to do that.\n\n203\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.760\nThat turns into a testing bed that\ngives him that ability to do isolation.\n\n204\n00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.650\nThe other thing that's also beneficial for\n\n205\n00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.605\nMike at this point, especially with\nthe way that the virtualization works say,\n\n206\n00:11:10.605 --> 00:11:15.300\nis if he gets it perfect, it does\nexactly what he wants to do, he can\n\n207\n00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.790\nsimply take those changes and literally\nmigrate them to the physical world.\n\n208\n00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.650\nIn other words, he might actually be able\nto bring that virtual machine up and\n\n209\n00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.950\nconnect it to the network, and say, watch\nthis, let me run this script and watch\n\n210\n00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.430\nit actually happen without him having\nto go, let me re-copy everything over.\n\n211\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.430\nLet me do all these instructions back.\n\n212\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.623\nHe might actually, and usually we do,\nwhere we actually run that.\n\n213\n00:11:35.623 --> 00:11:38.826\nWe just go, okay, everything looks like\nit worked in that test environment,\n\n214\n00:11:38.826 --> 00:11:40.475\nlet me just switch the network adapter,\n\n215\n00:11:40.475 --> 00:11:42.867\nput it over onto the physical network and\nrun that change.\n\n216\n00:11:42.867 --> 00:11:46.565\nAnd see what also ends up happening there\nafter everything is actually up and\n\n217\n00:11:46.565 --> 00:11:48.374\nrunning the way we want it to as well.\n\n218\n00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:52.142\nSo there's a lot of benefits with\nsomething like that, that we can\n\n219\n00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:56.470\nadministratively, especially in a big\nnetwork, that we can take care of.\n\n220\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.380\n>> Ronnie,\nyou kind of gave me an idea there.\n\n221\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.610\nWhen you talk about just\nmoving that machine over.\n\n222\n00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.650\nThat sounds like it might even\nhelp with fault tolerance or\n\n223\n00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.140\nfailures that I might run into.\n\n224\n00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.470\n>> Well you gotta expect that these\nthings are gonna end up happening,\n\n225\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.360\nregardless of whether they're physical\nmachines or not, or virtual machines.\n\n226\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.670\nThe problem is fairly simple, right?\n\n227\n00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.720\nThey're all tied to some\ntype of physical machine.\n\n228\n00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:22.580\nSo it could be that in one particular\nserver the power supply ends up dying out,\n\n229\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.330\nand you still have things\nthat are running there.\n\n230\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.720\nWell what you can do though is,\n\n231\n00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.120\nif they're all virtualized machines, you\nmight be able to actually bring up that\n\n232\n00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.710\nparticular machine briefly enough to where\nyou can copy that virtual machine off\n\n233\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:39.230\nto another virtual machine environment,\nand then run that machine again.\n\n234\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.440\nAnd it gives you that ability to not\nhave to go, god, I need to rebuild that.\n\n235\n00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.180\nOr if you have a recent backup, you just\nback it up and ready to restore it and\n\n236\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.070\nready to go right away.\n\n237\n00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.210\nWith this idea, you can actually take\nyour entire physical environment,\n\n238\n00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.580\njust like what Mike was saying, and\nwe literally duplicate it in that virtual\n\n239\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.160\nenvironment and have your own\nvirtualized disaster recovery center.\n\n240\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.400\nIdeally of course, it would be offsite,\nbut at the same time,\n\n241\n00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.570\nit at least is virtualized onto\nanother machine at that point.\n\n242\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.210\nAnd that way, you can actually\ncontinue to have that machine up and\n\n243\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.870\ngoing while you rebuild your other one,\n\n244\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.270\nas that one is now taking over\nin that virtualized environment.\n\n245\n00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.340\nAnd then you might realize that hey,\nthat runs so\n\n246\n00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:21.080\nwell that you might choose to actually\nrecreate that virtual environment back\n\n247\n00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.520\nonto your physical environment, and\nbe running all virtual machines too.\n\n248\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.400\nSo it really is a neat process.\n\n249\n00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.190\n>> And Ronnie, another thing I think of,\nwe've talked a couple of times about\n\n250\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.240\nbeing able to take full\nadvantage of these resources.\n\n251\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.190\nWe buy one of these servers, and\n\n252\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.690\nif we virtualize, we can really\nmake a good, efficient use of that.\n\n253\n00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.610\nSo it sounds like cost might be\nanother big benefit of virtualization.\n\n254\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.800\n>> Cost is the number one benefit.\n\n255\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.040\nI know that sounds strange.\n\n256\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.630\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n257\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:51.060\nall the stuff that we talked about,\ngreat benefits in technology.\n\n258\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.520\nBut the reasons why businesses love\nit is because it really does reduce\n\n259\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.200\nthe cost of multiple machines.\n\n260\n00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.760\nA lot of times you can essentially\nend up taking ten to 15 servers,\n\n261\n00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.410\nand then virtualizing those servers,\nand run them all on one server.\n\n262\n00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.140\nThink about that in terms of electricity.\n\n263\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.040\nThe very fact that you can do that.\n\n264\n00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.200\nThat you can say, man,\nmy electricity cost just went down by\n\n265\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.270\nseveral hundred dollars this year,\ncuz I'm not running 15 servers.\n\n266\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.590\nI'm running one.\n\n267\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.470\nYou can also take advantage of\nthe very fact that you can say look,\n\n268\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.230\nhere's what I'm gonna do.\n\n269\n00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.200\nI know that we would normally have to be\nreplacing these servers on a three year\n\n270\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.480\nschedule at the end of its life and\nstuff like that.\n\n271\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.070\nWell it might be where you go,\nyou know what I want to do?\n\n272\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.230\nI want to go ahead and\nspend a little bit more money and\n\n273\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:39.120\nget a super high performance server,\na beefy server that has\n\n274\n00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.370\nthe CPUs I want and the maximum\namount of memory that I can get.\n\n275\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.150\nLarger hard drives, or\nI might even go to a storage of plans.\n\n276\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.610\nAnd you might start right there and\n\n277\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.150\nyou virtualize all of those existing\nmachines onto that one, get rid of those,\n\n278\n00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.790\nand then you're only replacing\none machine each year.\n\n279\n00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.690\nI mean just, where it's like well that one\nwill probably run for a couple of years.\n\n280\n00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.370\nBut you want to duplicate it,\nyet you duplicate it and\n\n281\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.190\nmake that actually a part of\nthe disaster recovery between the two.\n\n282\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.390\nBut then you're only replacing\nagain one server every other year.\n\n283\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.190\nInstead of going yeah, we've got five\nservers we've got to replace this year on\n\n284\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.770\nthe schedule that we were on.\n\n285\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.130\nAnd so you're reducing cost\nlike crazy when you do that.\n\n286\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.960\nLittle bit more in terms of\nlearning about the technology.\n\n287\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.930\nBut once people learn\nabout the technology,\n\n288\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.790\nit's just as easy as maintaining what we\nnormally have in the physical environment\n\n289\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.560\nin the virtual environment as well.\n\n290\n00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.490\n>> Yeah, it sounds like the cost savings\ntrickles throughout the entire picture.\n\n291\n00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.980\nYou talk about one or two physical\nservers now using less electricity.\n\n292\n00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.900\nThat means I have fewer UPSs,\nuninterruptible power supplies,\n\n293\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.840\nto maintain.\n\n294\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.830\nI'm probably generating a lot less heat\nif I've reduced the number of physical\n\n295\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.370\nservers, which means I've got less cooling\ncosts to deal with in that server closet,\n\n296\n00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.100\nso it just seems to,\nthe savings compound on themselves.\n\n297\n00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.910\n>> They really do.\n\n298\n00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.212\nNow, this actually brings us back to that\nterminology though that we really have to\n\n299\n00:15:57.212 --> 00:15:59.677\nget in, because you will hear\nthis throughout the industry.\n\n300\n00:15:59.677 --> 00:16:02.627\nNow, don't get me wrong,\neverybody uses terminology differently.\n\n301\n00:16:02.627 --> 00:16:06.357\nIf you're like me, you actually change the\nterminology, and then people go Ronnie,\n\n302\n00:16:06.357 --> 00:16:08.008\nyou know that's really not correct.\n\n303\n00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:09.668\nBut I do it anyways.\n\n304\n00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:11.140\nBut let me introduce you.\n\n305\n00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.240\nSo all the benefits that\nwe've been talking about so\n\n306\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.960\nfar really have to deal with three or\nfour different, let me make sure I'm done,\n\n307\n00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.590\nthree different things here.\n\n308\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:25.900\nConsolidation, isolation, and even\nmigration is what we're normally talk of.\n\n309\n00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.134\nSo let me kind of give you\nan example here on my screen so\n\n310\n00:16:28.134 --> 00:16:29.936\nthat we can see what we're talking about.\n\n311\n00:16:29.936 --> 00:16:33.860\nSo here is a basic machine\nthat's been virtualized, right?\n\n312\n00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.430\nAnd we've been using this diagram\nthroughout our series so far.\n\n313\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.550\nThat's not a lot up to this point.\n\n314\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.710\nBut we've been using this diagram and\nshowing us the base model, right?\n\n315\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:47.480\nOur physical hardware, on top of that,\nrunning a Virtual Machine Monitor, or\n\n316\n00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.030\nsome type of Hypervisor, and then being\nable to virtualize our environment\n\n317\n00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:57.060\nup here, our different machines that we\ncan run, right on top of that as well.\n\n318\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.010\nNow when you and I start to take\na look at consolidation, okay?\n\n319\n00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.850\nNow, you're probably thinking, Ronnie,\nthat's exactly identical to what I showed.\n\n320\n00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.000\nExactly, notice that instead of\nrunning one operating system on\n\n321\n00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.970\ntop of the physical hardware,\nI'm actually running two.\n\n322\n00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.060\nIf I wanted to be able\nto duplicate this and\n\n323\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.570\ndepending on the hardware resources\nthat are available, I can actually\n\n324\n00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:24.390\ncontinue to build more machines.\n\n325\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:29.270\nAnd here it is,\nwe now have a machine that is running,\n\n326\n00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:35.025\nreally for separate computers\nat the same time, on top of one.\n\n327\n00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:39.630\nWell that's the idea of consolidation is\nthat we're experiencing those benefits.\n\n328\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.500\nConsolidation is one of\nthe greatest benefits that we have\n\n329\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.430\nbecause it does a couple of things for us.\n\n330\n00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.260\nOne is what we call high optimization.\n\n331\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.810\nNow I'm emphasising these terms\nlike we're about to take an exam,\n\n332\n00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.780\nwe're not, but that's usually what\nwe call a benefit term, right.\n\n333\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:18:00.810\nHigh optimization means your not buying\nthat super beefy Xeon dual processor\n\n334\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.950\nmother board with 64 gigs of RAM,\nand solid state drives.\n\n335\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.880\nYou know enough to make me cry.\n\n336\n00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.280\nI would die if I had one of\nthose machines, I'd love it.\n\n337\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.430\nBut you know, doing that, but\n\n338\n00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.160\nyou're actually being able to take\nadvantage of all that hardware.\n\n339\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.600\nAnd you're not just running\nlike a domain controller or\n\n340\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.370\njust a DNS server I'm gonna go.\n\n341\n00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:25.230\nWell, I know that that is a $4,000 DNSer,\nbut Mike you did a good job\n\n342\n00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.580\nof picking that hardware out\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n343\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.600\n>> We are actually using it to\n\n344\n00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.160\nbe able to maximize and use all of\nthose resources that are there and\n\n345\n00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.780\nthat’s what consolidation does for\nus, is to be able to do that.\n\n346\n00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.772\nWe not only use that example that we were\ntalking about with multiple machines\n\n347\n00:18:37.772 --> 00:18:38.517\nthat are running.\n\n348\n00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:42.233\nAlso with older hardware that exists and\nthat continues to cost us so\n\n349\n00:18:42.233 --> 00:18:45.220\nmuch more in electrical power and\neverything.\n\n350\n00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.160\nConsolidating into one gives us those\nother benefits that we have as well.\n\n351\n00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.860\nThe other one that we also talked\nabout is the idea of isolation, right?\n\n352\n00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.180\nBeing able, as Mike suggested here,\nan application that really is\n\n353\n00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.340\nresource intensive, and then running other\napplications in the background on top of\n\n354\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.156\nthat may also of course be causing issues\nwith the performance of that one machine.\n\n355\n00:19:08.156 --> 00:19:11.500\nBeing able to actually create\na virtualized machine environment for\n\n356\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.420\nus gives us that ability to separate\nout that one application and\n\n357\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.840\nallow it to run on its own.\n\n358\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.810\nThe other notion of course behind this\ntoo is the isolation allows us to be\n\n359\n00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.190\nable to do exactly that, if we're doing\nthings like testing purposes as well.\n\n360\n00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:30.510\nIt doesn't actually get pushed out onto\nour production network, we can isolate and\n\n361\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.800\nmake that thing run\nthe way that we want to.\n\n362\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.010\nWe can break it, we can do everything\nthat it doesn't affect anything else.\n\n363\n00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.920\nSo isolation is another great benefit\nwhen we start taking a look, and\n\n364\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.910\nthen of course the idea of migration\nlike what Mike was suggesting.\n\n365\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:44.500\nSo let's take for\n\n366\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.320\nan example in this particular environment\nhere that what happens of course is that\n\n367\n00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.040\none of these machines has that\nsomething that begins to happen to it.\n\n368\n00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.090\nAnd what we realize is that we need\nto move one of these machines.\n\n369\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:02.490\nWell I can simply take my\nWindows OS virtual machine and\n\n370\n00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.040\nsimply be able to migrate it over to\nanother machine that is actually running\n\n371\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.370\nthe same thing, be able to turn\nthat thing back on and ready to go.\n\n372\n00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.120\nAnd so it gives us that ability\nto do it very quickly and\n\n373\n00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.050\neasily without having to go, well,\nlet me order another server.\n\n374\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.500\nDon't get me wrong, you may come\nto a point where you have to, but\n\n375\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.090\nat this point,\nif there's actually room available,\n\n376\n00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.870\nwe can actually take advantage and\ndo things like that.\n\n377\n00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.130\nSo regardless of whether we're talking\nabout personal or whether we're talking\n\n378\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:31.980\nabout a business world, there's no\ndoubt that virtualization is by far\n\n379\n00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:37.380\nan incredibly beneficial technology\nthat you're not going to get away from.\n\n380\n00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.352\nSo learning it is key.\n\n381\n00:20:39.352 --> 00:20:41.170\n>> Now, Ronnie,\na lot of good benefits there,\n\n382\n00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.710\nbut I'm assuming with our benefits we've\ngot some limitations as well, right?\n\n383\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.670\nSo we better hit those also.\n\n384\n00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.400\n>> Whenever we start talking\nabout the idea of limitations,\n\n385\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.720\nthe big limitation that\nwe have in virtualization\n\n386\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.850\nreally does wrap up into well,\nthe hardware limitations that we have.\n\n387\n00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.920\nAnd this is something that most of\nus do not understand when we're\n\n388\n00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.230\nfirst getting started in virtualization.\n\n389\n00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.040\nJust like I said at the very beginning\nof the episode, it was very easy for\n\n390\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.790\nme to say, man,\nthis is the coolest technology ever.\n\n391\n00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.974\nAnd then realize something, I don't have\nenough RAM to run something I don't have\n\n392\n00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:17.801\nenough hard drive space to\nactually build another one.\n\n393\n00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:23.600\nI don't have enough CPU power to make it\nactually perform the way that I want to.\n\n394\n00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.370\nYou name it,\nthere's always these limitations.\n\n395\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:31.920\nAnd the problem that we have today\nis that there is no way to say how\n\n396\n00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.250\nmany VMs are too many VMs for one machine?\n\n397\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.220\nNow don't get me wrong,\nis there a limitation?\n\n398\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.180\nIt depends on who you talk to,\nit really does.\n\n399\n00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.880\nSo there's a couple of\ndifferent limitations here, and\n\n400\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:49.100\nthis is what we call a consolidation\nratio, that's the technical term for it.\n\n401\n00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.860\nThat ratio is the physical machine\nversus how many virtual machines\n\n402\n00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.050\ncan a single machine host.\n\n403\n00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:01.470\nSo, it's like how many licks to get to the\ncenter of that lollipop thing, who knows?\n\n404\n00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.090\nIt just depends on what\nyou have available.\n\n405\n00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.920\nAnd that's really some of the key\nlimitations there, right?\n\n406\n00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.950\nSo what do I mean by that?\n\n407\n00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.670\nWell, it really is,\nit's on the basis of your hardware, okay?\n\n408\n00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:18.000\nIt really does depend on how much RAM, how\nmuch hard drive space you have available,\n\n409\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.750\nand your CPU as well.\n\n410\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.710\nMaking sure that it can handle everything,\nas well as your Graphics Processor Unit.\n\n411\n00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.750\nIf it actually needs to do\nperformance in that sense too.\n\n412\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.620\nSo there is what we call\na consolidation ratio.\n\n413\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.920\nNow, the consolidation ratio, like I said,\ndepends on two things, and I said,\n\n414\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.240\nhardware is the first one.\n\n415\n00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.880\nSo what does that mean as far as hardware?\n\n416\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.240\nWell, the more hardware that you have,\nthe better.\n\n417\n00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.420\nI mean, that's the overall\nperformance consolidation\n\n418\n00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.980\nratio that you have to think about.\n\n419\n00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:52.230\nSo if I have a beefier dual processor,\nor multiple core processors, absolutely.\n\n420\n00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.860\nYou're gonna be able to\nrun more virtual machines.\n\n421\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.360\nIf I have more RAM, you're gonna be\nable to run more virtual machines.\n\n422\n00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.890\nMore storage space,\nmore virtual machines on that one machine.\n\n423\n00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.420\nThat is clearly the key, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.320\nWhat is the second part of\nthis consolidation ratio?\n\n425\n00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.460\nThe second part is what technology\nare you going to end up running?\n\n426\n00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.940\nAnd that is that virtual machine monitor,\n\n427\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.180\nthat pink layer that we're\ntalking about right there.\n\n428\n00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.320\nAnd the reason why you actually have\nto pay attention to this is because\n\n429\n00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.720\nevery single one of them will\nactually do differently.\n\n430\n00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.800\nAnd it'll actually say\nthe differences here.\n\n431\n00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.890\nAnd the probably that you have\nis you don't know which one\n\n432\n00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.140\nIs absolutely telling you everything.\n\n433\n00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.780\nAnd you might be saying,\nwhy do you say that?\n\n434\n00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.470\nWell remember they're actually\ncompeting in a market place.\n\n435\n00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:41.250\nSo if one vendor says I can do 20 to 1,\nwhat is the other vendor going to say?\n\n436\n00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.805\nI can do five, five to one.\n\n437\n00:23:42.805 --> 00:23:45.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, he's gonna say what,\n\n438\n00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.220\nI can do near 20 to 1,\nor I can do 21 to 1.\n\n439\n00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:56.256\nSo, it's a marketplace, and that's where\nthe literature that's out there on it.\n\n440\n00:23:56.256 --> 00:24:00.050\nDon't get me wrong, they may be able\nto do it, but it really does depend.\n\n441\n00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.310\nLike physically, once you get everything\ninstalled on there and you turn on all 21\n\n442\n00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:08.214\nof those virtual machines, and then\nyou actually see the performance here.\n\n443\n00:24:08.214 --> 00:24:10.285\nSo those are the two things\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n444\n00:24:10.285 --> 00:24:17.040\nSo normally depending on that virtual\nmachine monitor, that will tell you.\n\n445\n00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.570\nOn a regular desktop machine,\nyour big limitation is the hardware,\n\n446\n00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.800\nnot normally the virtual machine\nmonitor that you're running.\n\n447\n00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.110\nBut once you get into the business\nenvironment where you're running this for\n\n448\n00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.870\nyour entire organization,\nboth of them really do factor in.\n\n449\n00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.530\nIt is not uncommon to see 10 or 15 to 1.\n\n450\n00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:40.080\nIn other words, 15 virtual machines to 1,\nbut remember when you start talking about\n\n451\n00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.930\nthat, now you're saying, well,\nwhat am I going to get for each machine?\n\n452\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:47.410\nWell, normally today, at least for me,\nit's probably going to be 2 gigs of RAM,\n\n453\n00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.264\nso you're going to be running at\nleast 30 gigs of RAM on that machine.\n\n454\n00:24:51.264 --> 00:24:55.892\nAnd then each one you're giving\nprobably a 64 gig hard drive or larger.\n\n455\n00:24:55.892 --> 00:24:58.010\nNow you start adding it up.\n\n456\n00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.510\nYeah, I can't even do it in my head so\nI'm not even gonna try, but\n\n457\n00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:05.350\nyou have to kind of worry about stuff\nlike that when you start dealing with it.\n\n458\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.480\nSo remember that it's probably gonna come\nmore into play in the business world,\n\n459\n00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.600\nand that's where you have\nto set those limitations.\n\n460\n00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.319\nOnce you turn them on, and\nthen go, yeah, that 20 to 1, nope,\n\n461\n00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:17.640\nand then you turn off 5 virtual machines,\nand now everything runs like a whiz, and\n\n462\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.960\nnow you're all, yeah,\n15 to 1 may be the way to go.\n\n463\n00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.840\n>> It really seems like it'd be\nhard to put a set number on that,\n\n464\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.513\ncuz a lot of it has to do with what\nyou're doing with the VMs themselves.\n\n465\n00:25:27.513 --> 00:25:33.320\nAnd if you're creating a VM that is\nrunning a memory intensive application,\n\n466\n00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.070\nyou might have to give more to that\none VM than you did to the others, so\n\n467\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.620\nit's really hard to say ahead of time.\n\n468\n00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.950\nIt depends on how you're gonna\nbe using those virtual machines.\n\n469\n00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.840\nAs you said, if each one of your\nVMs only needs 2 gigs of RAM, heck,\n\n470\n00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.490\nI can divide that up and\ncount up and see how many I've got.\n\n471\n00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.620\nBut if a couple of them need 4 gigs or\n8 gigs, now I can't run\n\n472\n00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.370\nnearly as many virtual machines, unless\nI add more RAM to that physical machine.\n\n473\n00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.020\nNow Ronnie, what about security?\n\n474\n00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.730\nWe haven't really talked about that yet.\n\n475\n00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.020\nDoes that differ a little bit when it\ncomes to the world of virtualization?\n\n476\n00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.580\n>> Yes, you've got to remember this.\n\n477\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.460\nThe problem that I had at the very\nbeginning was simple, right?\n\n478\n00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.330\nIt's a test lab environment, in other\nwords, it's a place, it's a sandbox for\n\n479\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:20.480\nme, is what we normally thought about in\nthe very beginning of virtualization.\n\n480\n00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.050\nYou didn't run it for\nanything in a production environment.\n\n481\n00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.710\nSo when you actually did\nrun it on your machines,\n\n482\n00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:31.170\nyou always thought of it as being really\na play toy more than anything else.\n\n483\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.180\nAnd that, of course,\n\n484\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.480\nstarted, of course, to carry forward\ninto the future when we started actually\n\n485\n00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.200\nthinking about the idea of running\nthis into a production environment.\n\n486\n00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.400\nSo there's two things that\nnormally ended up happening.\n\n487\n00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.700\nOne, we would end up securing\nevery virtual machine.\n\n488\n00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.070\nYou go in there, and you do all the things\nthat you would do to a standard,\n\n489\n00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.060\nregular machine.\n\n490\n00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.280\nBecause it's isolated, it thinks of itself\nas actually being a regular machine.\n\n491\n00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.521\nAnd you have to treat it like that.\n\n492\n00:26:55.521 --> 00:26:56.719\nYou have to give it the antivirus.\n\n493\n00:26:56.719 --> 00:26:58.400\nYou have to make sure\nit's got all its updates.\n\n494\n00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.940\nGotta make sure it's doing everything\nthat it can do to protect itself, okay?\n\n495\n00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.050\nSo you've gotta do that.\n\n496\n00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.850\nAnd this is what would happen,\nis that you do that, and you go,\n\n497\n00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.460\nall right everything's good.\n\n498\n00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.640\nBut then,\nthe host machine would get attacked.\n\n499\n00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.230\nAnd Mike, if it attacks the host machine,\nwhat happens?\n\n500\n00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:18.650\n>> Well I'm thinking all the VMs on\nthat host machine are now good targets.\n\n501\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:21.650\n>> Yeah,\ngood targets is not even the term.\n\n502\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.670\nIt is a ripe, it is a big target,\nit's this gigantic target.\n\n503\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.480\nWhen they realize hey,\n\n504\n00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.820\nthere's these gigantic files here,\nthey've gotta be important.\n\n505\n00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.000\nAnd they start trying\nto infect those files,\n\n506\n00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000\nor they start trying to erase those files,\nthose things are actually very possible.\n\n507\n00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.650\nSo then you have to go back and you also\nhave to not only take care of those VMs\n\n508\n00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.950\ninside, you also have to think about\nof course, then, the host machine.\n\n509\n00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.920\nMaking sure that that machine\nalso is protected as well.\n\n510\n00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.340\nAnd so you make sure that you actually\nhave all those things in place too.\n\n511\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.670\nThat is updating,\nit's doing its antivirus scans,\n\n512\n00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:58.710\nit's actually doing everything that\nwe need to do, behind the firewall.\n\n513\n00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.720\nYou name it, it's gotta have everything\nthat you would normally have, so\n\n514\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.350\nyou need to protect not only the host\nmachine, which is also essential.\n\n515\n00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.720\nAnd maybe even more important\nthan even inside of that\n\n516\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.470\nvirtual machine environment.\n\n517\n00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.490\nOn top of that, you also have to be\ncareful of the networking technology\n\n518\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.190\nthat's also in there, too.\n\n519\n00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:18.150\nAnd you want to make sure that you\nhave your entire network protected.\n\n520\n00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.510\nDon't just think that, hey it's on\nthe network, what's the big deal?\n\n521\n00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:27.180\nMake sure it actually is, doing what\nyou need to do and its connections that\n\n522\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.830\nwhere it needs to go, that it is protected\nthe way that you want it to as well.\n\n523\n00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.620\nAll that, that connects in,\nhas to be protected at every single layer\n\n524\n00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.530\nwhen we start to do\nstuff like this as well.\n\n525\n00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:43.010\nSo, security is a big benefit,\nthat you have security, right?\n\n526\n00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.650\nBut it is a limitation when you don't\nunderstand that you have to protect\n\n527\n00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:46.510\neverything.\n\n528\n00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:49.920\nBecause now, remember,\nif you only leave virtual machine and\n\n529\n00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.940\nit's connected to all those other virtual\nmachines inside of your little test bed,\n\n530\n00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.280\ninfections can get around there.\n\n531\n00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.200\nAnd then if that machine is now\nconnected to your host machine,\n\n532\n00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.560\nyou can infect it as well.\n\n533\n00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.510\nAnd that host machine then is connected\nto your physical environment,\n\n534\n00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.320\nyou're toast as well.\n\n535\n00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.640\nSo you have to remember that the whole\npackage also needs protection.\n\n536\n00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.740\nSo that's another limitation\nthat you also have to face,\n\n537\n00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.840\ntoo, is you can't think about it as\nvirtual machines versus physical.\n\n538\n00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.600\nIt's all around.\n\n539\n00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.010\nYou've gotta consider everything.\n\n540\n00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:19.340\n>> It does add a whole\nother layer of complexity.\n\n541\n00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.160\nIf I can get onto one of those VMs and\nmake it extremely busy, remember,\n\n542\n00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.230\nit's shared resources.\n\n543\n00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.590\nSo if that one VM starts\nsucking up all the resources\n\n544\n00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.090\nI can cause performance hits\non all of your other VMs.\n\n545\n00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.200\nThat local admin account\non that host machine,\n\n546\n00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.150\nI know we're gonna talk about\nthis later on in other episodes.\n\n547\n00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.790\nBut a lot of times it's not part\nof the domain, or maybe it is.\n\n548\n00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.405\nBut that local admin account\non that physical machine,\n\n549\n00:29:43.405 --> 00:29:45.870\nthey might not be able to log\non to your virtual machines and\n\n550\n00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:49.500\naccess your directory and\nDNS and things like that.\n\n551\n00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.350\nBut if I can get on that physical machine\nand start shutting virtual machines down,\n\n552\n00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.030\nthat's a pretty good\ndenial of service attack.\n\n553\n00:29:55.030 --> 00:30:00.190\nSo security becomes a little more complex\nwhen we start doing this consolidation and\n\n554\n00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.728\nthis virtualization.\n\n555\n00:30:01.728 --> 00:30:04.800\n>> Yeah, the known last limitation I want\nto mention here is remember that it does\n\n556\n00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.230\ntake time to understand how\nthe virtualization technology does work.\n\n557\n00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.700\nAnd there can be a lot\nof configuration issues.\n\n558\n00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.145\nIn other words, when we get into some\nof the different technologies we'll be\n\n559\n00:30:15.145 --> 00:30:19.067\ndealing with, we'll see that not everybody\nactually has things in the standard format\n\n560\n00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:20.130\nthe way that we have to.\n\n561\n00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.913\nSo you have to search around and see the\nsettings that are actually there for us,\n\n562\n00:30:23.913 --> 00:30:25.721\nto be able to manipulate and change and\n\n563\n00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:29.030\nmake sure the security is going to\nbenefit us the way they want to.\n\n564\n00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.930\nAnd just even getting it ready to go,\nright,\n\n565\n00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.030\nall of our virtualization technology.\n\n566\n00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.630\nGetting it up and working,\n\n567\n00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.780\nit can be a little bit challenging\nas well if we don't understand.\n\n568\n00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.400\nAnd that's what hopefully\nthis show is there to\n\n569\n00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.090\nbenefit you as well as myself as\nwe actually go through this and\n\n570\n00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.220\nsee some of the different ones\nwe're more likely to encounter.\n\n571\n00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.960\nAnd understand the basic configurations\nand getting something up and running and\n\n572\n00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.130\nseeing how you normally manage it, too.\n\n573\n00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:53.980\n>> Very good, Ronnie.\n\n574\n00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.590\nAll right, a lot of great information,\n\n575\n00:30:55.590 --> 00:31:00.690\nwe see that virtualization has some great\nbenefits that we can take advantage of.\n\n576\n00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:04.240\nAs well as some limitations that we've\ngotta consider if we're thinking about\n\n577\n00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.950\nmoving into the world of virtualization or\n\n578\n00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.890\nwe're starting to work in a place\nthat uses virtualization.\n\n579\n00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.026\nImportant that we understand\nthose limitations as well.\n\n580\n00:31:12.026 --> 00:31:14.613\nAnd then, of course,\nsecurity always a concern.\n\n581\n00:31:14.613 --> 00:31:18.103\nSo we've got to understand how moving\nto that virtual environment and\n\n582\n00:31:18.103 --> 00:31:22.008\nworking with virtual machines, how that\nimpacts security, how that makes us\n\n583\n00:31:22.008 --> 00:31:25.870\nrethink some of our decisions or\nsome things that we might have to do.\n\n584\n00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.520\nA little bit differently now that we\nbring virtualization into the picture.\n\n585\n00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.210\nSo great information Ronnie,\nthanks for all of that.\n\n586\n00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:33.710\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n587\n00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.410\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n588\n00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.170\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n589\n00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.565\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n590\n00:31:39.565 --> 00:31:44.130\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:20.280\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're looking at virtualization.\n\n4\n00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.810\nAnd specifically, we're gonna take\na look at some of the technologies that\n\n5\n00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.915\nallow us to do virtualization.\n\n6\n00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:30.060\nWe've spent the previous episodes kind of\ngoing over some of the terminology and\n\n7\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.340\nthat foundational knowledge that\nwe need to have to be able to\n\n8\n00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.700\nwork with some of these\nvirtualization technologies.\n\n9\n00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.740\nAnd we've mentioned a couple of them,\na little bit, Ronnie, there.\n\n10\n00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.630\nBut today I've got Ronnie Wong with me,\nand\n\n11\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.150\nhe's gonna help us go over some of those\nchoices that we have to make when we get\n\n12\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.680\nready to dive into the world\nof virtualization.\n\n13\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.570\n>> There is no doubt that what ends\nup happening a lot of times is that\n\n14\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.560\nyou hear about it, and\nnow you're ready to get started, and\n\n15\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.460\nthen you go, you wanna know something?\n\n16\n00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.029\nI really don't know, I know a little bit\nabout virtualization and what it does.\n\n17\n00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.270\nHow is it that I really get started and\nwhat do I need to know so\n\n18\n00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.810\nI can begin to build my\nvery first virtual machine?\n\n19\n00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.740\nWhat we want to do is talk about\nsome of those details right now and\n\n20\n00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.508\nthen what we're going to see\nin later episodes, of course,\n\n21\n00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:15.034\nis we're going to end up picking up and\ntaking a look at some of the more popular\n\n22\n00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:17.810\nvirtualization technologies\nthat are out there.\n\n23\n00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.490\nSo that you can actually get a little bit\nmore hands on feel of what it actually\n\n24\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.930\nlooks like to create a virtual machine for\nthe very first time as well.\n\n25\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.940\nSo when we start talking about the initial\nthing that we have to think about, right.\n\n26\n00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.510\nWell it comes down to what are you gonna\nput your virtualization technology on and\n\n27\n00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.930\nthen having to choose between some of the\ndifferent technologies that are out there\n\n28\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.420\nand why we would make those choices.\n\n29\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.110\n>> It really makes a difference,\nlike you said.\n\n30\n00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.740\nOne, what am I gonna run it on?\n\n31\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.420\nAnd two, what do I plan to do with it?\n\n32\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.970\nLike you told us yesterday, I might be\ndoing this just for testing purposes,\n\n33\n00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.100\nfor developing an application outside\nof my production environment.\n\n34\n00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.200\nOr I might be providing servers for the\nenterprise network that have to be up and\n\n35\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.170\nrunning all the time and have that level\nof full tolerance and things like that.\n\n36\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.882\nSo it really depends on where we're gonna\nrun it and what we intend to do with it.\n\n37\n00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:08.173\nSo yeah, let's go ahead and\ntake a look then.\n\n38\n00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:12.170\nLet's just say that this is our very\nfirst time, and we're about to get hired\n\n39\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.090\nsomewhere, but we really don't\nknow much about virtualization.\n\n40\n00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.000\nSo I actually have to choose a product.\n\n41\n00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.105\nNow depending on what\nproduct you choose right,\n\n42\n00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:22.117\nit can actually be\na little bit overwhelming.\n\n43\n00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:25.213\nIf all of a sudden somebody says oh yeah,\n\n44\n00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:29.240\nMike all you need to do is\nactually use VMware, ESX.\n\n45\n00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.360\nAnd Mike says, yeah,\nlet me go ahead and do that.\n\n46\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.880\nAnd he starts researching it.\n\n47\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.792\nMike, we're gonna realize something right\naway if that's the first time we have.\n\n48\n00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:39.130\nThat is a little bit more complicated than\njust saying, let me download that and\n\n49\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.350\ninstall it, right?\n\n50\n00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.060\n>> It definitely is.\n\n51\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.080\nSo, maybe, Ronnie,\n\n52\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.750\nthere's a couple of introductory-type\napplications we could use.\n\n53\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.735\nStart smaller.\n\n54\n00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:49.760\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, there's definitely that.\n\n55\n00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.940\nSo, when it breaks down to the types of\nvirtualization technology that you and\n\n56\n00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.330\nI are gonna encounter, for\n\n57\n00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.430\ncreating virtual machines, it really\nfalls into two different categories.\n\n58\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.876\nAnd the good thing is that\nthe terminology gets much simpler.\n\n59\n00:03:01.876 --> 00:03:06.510\nWe had talked about things like\nconsolidation and isolation and migration\n\n60\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.660\nand consolidation ratios a little bit\nbefore, that wasn't to confuse you.\n\n61\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.380\nIt was just to let you feel\nfamiliar with those terminologies.\n\n62\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.020\nBut now when we start to\npick a technology, right,\n\n63\n00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.760\nthey make it fairly simple.\n\n64\n00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.210\nWe're gonna either pick what we\ncall a type I hypervisor, or\n\n65\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.460\nthat virtual machine monitor, or\nwe're gonna pick a type II hypervisor,\n\n66\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.550\nis what we have to actually\nthink about when we pick.\n\n67\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.580\nNow when it first starts\noff you might think okay.\n\n68\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.298\nType I had to precede type II hypervisors,\n\n69\n00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:37.920\ntherefore we should start\nwith a type I hypervisor.\n\n70\n00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.122\nYou would be absolutely, 100% wrong.\n\n71\n00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:42.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That is what it comes down to.\n\n72\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.560\nAnd I don't know why the terminology\ngot stuck the way that it did, but\n\n73\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.830\nwhat we're gonna start off with\nis we're gonna talk about and\n\n74\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.327\ndescribe the differences between this.\n\n75\n00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:53.710\nSo let me go ahead and jump to my screen.\n\n76\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.320\nAnd let's make sure we\nremember just a few things.\n\n77\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.481\nI know that this was just\na couple of episodes ago.\n\n78\n00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.474\nBut let's make sure that we remember\nthat when we talk about the idea\n\n79\n00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.421\nof virtualization,\n\n80\n00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:05.854\nwe have to understand the physical idea\nfirst over here on the left hand side.\n\n81\n00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:09.515\nThat this is normally the way that we\nwould have our regular desktop computer\n\n82\n00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:13.516\nset up, our workstations and setting\nthis up, hardware, one operating system,\n\n83\n00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:16.740\nmultiple applications running on\ntop of that, great, way to go.\n\n84\n00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.860\nWhen we talk about the idea\nof virtualization,\n\n85\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.090\nwe're gonna actually have the hardware and\nthen we also add in that extra component\n\n86\n00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.200\nthat we call the virtual machine monitor,\nor in our case here a hyper visor.\n\n87\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.890\nFrom that point, we can now actually take\nthat physical machine, virtualize it, and\n\n88\n00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.890\nrun them on top of the hypervisor.\n\n89\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.040\nSo that makes sense, but\nthere's a couple of different ways\n\n90\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.990\nhow we do this virtual machine system,\nover here on the left-hand side.\n\n91\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.065\nSo, we wanna start off with what\nwe call this idea of a Type II\n\n92\n00:04:47.065 --> 00:04:51.140\nhypervisor to help us to understand,\nand why this is actually easier for\n\n93\n00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.400\nus to understand right at the beginning.\n\n94\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.020\nThe reason why this is easier\nto understand is that you and\n\n95\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.420\nI have already been running a machine,\nright?\n\n96\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.160\nWe have an operating system.\n\n97\n00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.660\nSo I might have a laptop that I'm\nrunning something like Windows 10 on it.\n\n98\n00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.500\nSo there it is.\n\n99\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.870\nSo there's my physical\nhardware on my laptop.\n\n100\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.060\nAnd there it is, I've installed\nWindows 10 on it, at that point.\n\n101\n00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.610\nThat's really good because this actually\nmakes it seamless and a little bit easier.\n\n102\n00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.390\nIt allows us to be able\nto treat the hypervisor\n\n103\n00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.160\nas just another application\nthat we end up running.\n\n104\n00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.250\nSo it's at this point, we go out and\nwe find ourselves what we call a virtual\n\n105\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.100\nmachine monitor or a hypervisor to\ninstall on the operating system as well.\n\n106\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.860\nSo when you take a look at what we're\nactually doing here in terms of\n\n107\n00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.120\nthe way that we layer things.\n\n108\n00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.000\nOver here on the left-hand side, we\nhave our hardware, really at the bottom.\n\n109\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.660\nWe have our operating system, remember\nthe operating system allows me as a user\n\n110\n00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.170\nto be able to communicate with\nthe hardware and tell it what to do.\n\n111\n00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.750\nAllows the application to also\nbe able to send commands and\n\n112\n00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.330\ntranslates it into what\nthe hardware can do,\n\n113\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.140\nand sends the information also\nback into the application as well.\n\n114\n00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.960\nBut now we have another layer in\nbetween which is this hypervisor\n\n115\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.730\nthat is now virtualizing these\noperating systems as well.\n\n116\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.420\nSo it really does run on top of the host\noperating system is what we have.\n\n117\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.910\nAnd there's another terminology that we\nhad picked up on a little bit earlier.\n\n118\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.350\nSo if you take a look, there's actually\ntwo layers here of abstraction.\n\n119\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.610\nRemember that term?\n\n120\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.410\nYou're like, oh Ronnie, Ronnie's trying\nto throw around that terminology again.\n\n121\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.760\nBetween a virtual machine and\n\n122\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.680\nthe physical hardware now,\nwe have two layers of abstraction.\n\n123\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.140\nThat virtual machine monitor and\n\n124\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.410\nof course the host operating system,\nwhat's underlying it.\n\n125\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.360\nAnd then we can create our\nown VMs within that as well.\n\n126\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.940\nSo, when you're actually\ndoing something like that,\n\n127\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.950\nthat's probably the easiest way.\n\n128\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.390\nThat's the way that I first started out,\nMike, is I said, all right,\n\n129\n00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.060\nhow do I get started, and somebody said,\nwell, just go and download this and\n\n130\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.130\ninstall it and try and figure it out.\n\n131\n00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.910\nAnd that's exactly what I did.\n\n132\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.640\nThe very first one that I ran,\n\n133\n00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.680\nand I didn't even know it's\ncalled a Type II hypervisor then.\n\n134\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.200\nBut it's actually good cuz you'll\nknow that it's called this.\n\n135\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.040\nIs that mine was actually this Virtual PC,\nand even though\n\n136\n00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.670\nthe official one is a Virtual PC 2007,\nit wasn't 2007 when I first ran it.\n\n137\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.210\nSo I know it's a little\nbit earlier than that.\n\n138\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.180\nBut Virtual PC 2007, and it was,\n\n139\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.620\nit was just an application that\nwe would install right on.\n\n140\n00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.720\nBut what it does is it gives us that\nability now to create virtual machines and\n\n141\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.960\nto manage virtual machines,\nconfigure virtual machines, and\n\n142\n00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.390\nallows us to do it all from what\nlooks like a simple application.\n\n143\n00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:36.350\nSo any of these over here on the left hand\nside, not left hand side, right hand side.\n\n144\n00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.470\nLeft, right, who really actually\nknows the difference there?\n\n145\n00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.090\nApparently I don't.\n\n146\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.000\nBut examples of type II hypervisors.\n\n147\n00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.170\nThe earliest one I remember would be\nthis Virtual PC from Microsoft 2007.\n\n148\n00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.847\nNow the nice thing about a lot of these,\nthough,\n\n149\n00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.343\nis that they're absolutely 100% free.\n\n150\n00:07:55.343 --> 00:07:59.333\nSo when we start talking about something\nlike that, yes, the technology is free,\n\n151\n00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:03.038\nbut what you're gonna see is that when\nyou start building virtual machines,\n\n152\n00:08:03.038 --> 00:08:04.297\nit may not always be free.\n\n153\n00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:08.385\nEspecially when it comes to the guest OSs,\nand we'll talk about that in a moment too.\n\n154\n00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:12.140\nThe other ones that are out there,\nof course, is Oracle's VirtualBox.\n\n155\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.910\nThat's another system that's\nbeen out there for a long time.\n\n156\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.120\nBefore, it was just VirtualBox.\n\n157\n00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.080\nOracle at some point had bought them out.\n\n158\n00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.410\nAnd it really is, I'm gonna say,\n\n159\n00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.370\none of the most supported virtual\nmachine technologies that's out there.\n\n160\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.770\nAnd when I say it's actually so\n\n161\n00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.970\nsupported, it is amazing how much\npeople love this technology.\n\n162\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.990\nThey really don't make\na ton of money off of it.\n\n163\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.670\nOracle doesn't.\n\n164\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.670\nIt's out there for free.\n\n165\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.460\nThey give it away completely.\n\n166\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.060\nAnd even though they own the technology,\nthis didn't, it comes out with updates,\n\n167\n00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.940\nI'm gonna say every six months,\nevery year.\n\n168\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.990\nAnd that's because the community\nkeeps saying, we wanna improve it,\n\n169\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.240\nwe wanna make it better.\n\n170\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.650\nAnd you can actually see that and\nthey continue to do that.\n\n171\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:51.070\nThere are companies like Microsoft that\nstill has that, but that product is\n\n172\n00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.230\nreally old, and only supports a couple\nof different types of machines here.\n\n173\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.050\nSo it just really depends\non what you need.\n\n174\n00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.210\nYou'll probably not run that one, you can,\n\n175\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.770\nyou can still get it, but\nit's not, there not advertising.\n\n176\n00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.420\nIt doesn't have a big sign that\nsays come and download it here.\n\n177\n00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.950\nYou go to Oracle's VirtualBox site.\n\n178\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.880\nYou'll see there's a big gigantic brick\nright in the middle of the webpage\n\n179\n00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.120\nthat says, download 5.0 now!\n\n180\n00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.760\nCuz they really want you to download.\n\n181\n00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.108\nBut there's other ones\nthat are out here too.\n\n182\n00:09:19.108 --> 00:09:23.096\nVMWare Workstation is another one,\nfrom VMWare, and they are again,\n\n183\n00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:26.170\nthe gorilla that's in\nthe market right now.\n\n184\n00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.310\nThe very fact is that they\nhave their own Hyper V,\n\n185\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:35.780\nnot Hyper V that's a product,\nHypervisor technology out there for\n\n186\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.210\npeople that are running, like you and\nme on our desktop specifically here.\n\n187\n00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.260\nIt's called VMWare Workstation.\n\n188\n00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.010\nAnd there's even an old\nproduct that Mike and\n\n189\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.590\nI are actually very familiar with\nthat you can still download.\n\n190\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.320\ni dont know if you really want\nto be able to use this, but\n\n191\n00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.320\nyou can still download it,\ncalled Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 R2.\n\n192\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.090\nNow this was our, I think for Mike too.\n\n193\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.700\nBut my first foray into actually\na product that was designed to\n\n194\n00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.330\nbe a real emulating an actual server.\n\n195\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.128\nWhereas this one,\nMicrosoft Virtual PC was emulating my PC.\n\n196\n00:10:08.128 --> 00:10:12.190\nThis one was designed to emulate\nserver-based hardware instead.\n\n197\n00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.041\nAnd then of course, if you're in\nthe Mac world, there's VMWare Fusion,\n\n198\n00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:18.808\nand there's also Parallels\nthat's also out there.\n\n199\n00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:21.388\nAll of these are this type of Hypervisor,\n\n200\n00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:24.348\nwhere they run on top of\nyour operating system.\n\n201\n00:10:24.348 --> 00:10:28.968\nThe nice thing about that, I'm not having\nto format my machine, and say, all right,\n\n202\n00:10:28.968 --> 00:10:30.628\nI'm starting all over again.\n\n203\n00:10:30.628 --> 00:10:35.070\nIt really is an application that\nyou run directly on the machine.\n\n204\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.710\nAnd in that sense it really\ndoesn't disturb much.\n\n205\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.648\nYou don't like it.\n\n206\n00:10:39.648 --> 00:10:42.800\nYou can simply uninstall it and it's gone.\n\n207\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.620\n>> Yeah I think that's a great thing about\nthese type II hypervisors is it's a great\n\n208\n00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.560\nplace to get your feet wet,\nstart into the world of virtualization if\n\n209\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.290\nyou've got the time and\nyou're not being forced to jump right in.\n\n210\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.758\nIt's an application and\nas you said many of them are free.\n\n211\n00:10:56.758 --> 00:11:01.370\nSo I can just download it, install it,\ncreate some virtual machines and\n\n212\n00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.359\ngive me a chance to kind of play around\nand learn about virtualization with that\n\n213\n00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:10.998\nhands-on without having to blow\naway my machine, install something.\n\n214\n00:11:10.998 --> 00:11:14.100\nVery easy to use,\nvery user friendly I think.\n\n215\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.600\n>> Yeah the term user friendly,\nI think, is a great term.\n\n216\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.020\nIt didn't take me very long,\nand I really mean it.\n\n217\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:24.200\nIt did not take me very long after I\ninstalled it to launch the program.\n\n218\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.820\nAnd then I simply saw a button\non the right hand side,\n\n219\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.810\nif I remember correctly,\nMike it said New and I clicked on that and\n\n220\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.550\nthey are like do you want to actually\ncreate a new virtual machine?\n\n221\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.570\nI simply followed the steps on through\n\n222\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.920\nto make sure that I could\nactually create one.\n\n223\n00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.640\nIt was actually fairly easy in that user\nfriendly term, it is what you will see.\n\n224\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.540\nEach of these have of course\nhave developed over time and\n\n225\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.000\nthey have added in more and\nmore features to them.\n\n226\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.498\nNow Virtual PC, probably not so much so.\n\n227\n00:11:51.498 --> 00:11:56.339\nBut the other ones that are out here that\nare active like the Oracle's VirtualBox,\n\n228\n00:11:56.339 --> 00:11:59.400\nVMWare Workstation, Fusion and Parallels.\n\n229\n00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.510\nThese are technologies that\nare actually normally out there for\n\n230\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.790\nyou to be able to try.\n\n231\n00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.840\nNow some of them are just a trial basis,\nso\n\n232\n00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.380\nin other words you might\nsee a 30 day trial.\n\n233\n00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.320\nAnd after a while, they'll say hey, if\nyou want to actually be able to use this,\n\n234\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.170\nyou'll continue to pay more.\n\n235\n00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.180\nSome of them are just full out\nblown products where you have to\n\n236\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.500\noutright buy them.\n\n237\n00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.780\nAnd you might say,\nwell why the heck would I do that?\n\n238\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.840\nWell, it's actually worth it.\n\n239\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.060\nIf you think about the idea of you\nbringing up another machine that you want\n\n240\n00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.330\nto run some tests on.\n\n241\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.550\nYou'd have to go out and buy the hardware,\nand then the operating system, and\n\n242\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.410\nthen get everything installed on there.\n\n243\n00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.930\nI can spend maybe 100 bucks\nmaybe a little bit more,\n\n244\n00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:39.090\nI don't remember how much they are, maybe\na little bit more on each one of them, and\n\n245\n00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.530\nactually have a machine up and going for\njust a couple hundred dollars.\n\n246\n00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:47.000\nWhereas the other one may be 600,\n$700 minimum to get started.\n\n247\n00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.400\nSo using these type\nII Hypervisors that are out there\n\n248\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.040\nare really good at this point right,\nfor things like a test lab environment.\n\n249\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.286\nIf you wanna be able to\nrun on your machine and\n\n250\n00:12:57.286 --> 00:13:00.158\njust try to see if it's actually\ngonna do what you want.\n\n251\n00:13:00.158 --> 00:13:04.461\nAnd this is the way that I tend to do a\nlot of the shows that we do right here on\n\n252\n00:13:04.461 --> 00:13:09.332\nITprotv is we build up the machines that\nwe're using inside of our virtual machine\n\n253\n00:13:09.332 --> 00:13:10.198\ntechnology.\n\n254\n00:13:10.198 --> 00:13:14.282\nAnd the one that I'm actually running is\none called VMWare Fusion right now because\n\n255\n00:13:14.282 --> 00:13:16.720\nit's the way we like to\ndo our shows on these.\n\n256\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.420\nAnd we're running Mac Book, so\nit really does help you choose that.\n\n257\n00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.430\nSo remember that right at the beginning\nwhen you want to get started,\n\n258\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.220\nthis is probably the easiest\nway to get your feet wet\n\n259\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.160\nin the world of virtualization is to take\na look at one of these technologies.\n\n260\n00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.140\nNow, are there other\nones that are out there?\n\n261\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.000\nYou better believe it.\n\n262\n00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.140\nThere's tons of them that are out there.\n\n263\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.740\nBut some of them may require you to\nactually do a little bit more on\n\n264\n00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.580\ncommand line basis as well, especially\nif you head into the Linux realm.\n\n265\n00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.060\nYou actually end up seeing\nthat there's a lot more of\n\n266\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.740\nsome of the smaller\nvirtualization technologies.\n\n267\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.670\nBut they're all, you know,\n\n268\n00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.720\nin that way where you do have to\nlearn a lot more command line.\n\n269\n00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.520\nAnd don't get me wrong can you do some\nof these other ones in command line?\n\n270\n00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.410\nYes, you can still do that.\n\n271\n00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.130\nSo there's plenty of technology out there,\nat least for\n\n272\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.780\nType II, but the key here is to\nremember the layering here, right.\n\n273\n00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.180\nIs that we have an host OS and then we\ninstall the Hypervisor on top of that and\n\n274\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.120\nit runs as another application.\n\n275\n00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.100\nSo just knowing that basis and\nthen we're going to see,\n\n276\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.750\nwe're gonna pick a couple of these\nto actually do examples with and\n\n277\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.660\ndo the same thing so you can see how\nthey end up working in another episode.\n\n278\n00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.685\n>> All right, so\nwe have these Type IIs and\n\n279\n00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:25.645\nthat leaves then our Type I that\ncame after the Type IIs right?\n\n280\n00:14:25.645 --> 00:14:26.545\n>> It really did.\n\n281\n00:14:26.545 --> 00:14:32.095\nI know it's kind of funny,\nremember the hype, the virtualization.\n\n282\n00:14:32.095 --> 00:14:34.983\nI want to keep saying Hyper V,\nbut that's actually a product.\n\n283\n00:14:34.983 --> 00:14:38.617\nHypervisor technologies\nhave been out there for\n\n284\n00:14:38.617 --> 00:14:42.523\na little time in the realm\nthat we work in an IT today.\n\n285\n00:14:42.523 --> 00:14:45.143\nSo it's really about 2000, 2001.\n\n286\n00:14:45.143 --> 00:14:48.386\nVirtualization has been around\nreally since the 60s and\n\n287\n00:14:48.386 --> 00:14:51.043\n70s as main frames had\nactually been around.\n\n288\n00:14:51.043 --> 00:14:55.901\nBut in the way that you and I understand\nvirtualization really it's foundation\n\n289\n00:14:55.901 --> 00:14:58.680\nreally begins around 2000, 2001.\n\n290\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.460\nRight there as we start saying\nlook we need to emulate more than\n\n291\n00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.480\njust a component.\n\n292\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.750\nWe need to be emulate or\nbe able to virtualize,\n\n293\n00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.980\nexcuse me, an actual entire system.\n\n294\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.870\nSo, when we first started, it was the idea\nhere that, hey, we want to virtualize,\n\n295\n00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.020\nbut it's complex to do things.\n\n296\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.190\nSo what did they start off with?\n\n297\n00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.060\nA regular PC, right?\n\n298\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.710\nA single stand alone workstation.\n\n299\n00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.620\nWe would virtualize some of that and it\nwas a little bit more involved than that.\n\n300\n00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.140\nBut that's where it started.\n\n301\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.000\nBut then when they started\nactually thinking like,\n\n302\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.890\nhey, we actually want this technology.\n\n303\n00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.650\nBecause they started seeing those\nbenefits of the high optimization,\n\n304\n00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:39.540\nreducing the cost, being able to do\nmore and more with those systems.\n\n305\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.740\nThat's when they starting talking about,\nwell, how can we make this or\n\n306\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.240\nget that near native,\n\n307\n00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.800\nnear parity performance with the hardware\ninstead of all of the actual over heard.\n\n308\n00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.960\nRemember with the Type II right?\n\n309\n00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.120\nYou have to go through the operating\nsystem, it has to translate into hardware,\n\n310\n00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.110\nhardware has to translate\nback to the operating system.\n\n311\n00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.633\nOperating system then\ntalks to the Hypervisor.\n\n312\n00:15:57.633 --> 00:16:02.009\nThat's a lot of talking that has to go\non in between to get performance and\n\n313\n00:16:02.009 --> 00:16:04.468\na lot of times it did lack and really did.\n\n314\n00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:06.889\nMost of the modern ones today\nhave taken care of that.\n\n315\n00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:10.426\nBut when they started they were like,\nlook what we need to do,\n\n316\n00:16:10.426 --> 00:16:13.897\nis we need to actually be able\nto do this virtualization, but\n\n317\n00:16:13.897 --> 00:16:18.320\nhave it where the hyper visor is\nactually on the hardware itself.\n\n318\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.870\nAnd that's what we talk about in\nterms of type one hyper visors.\n\n319\n00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.880\nSo here's my diagram on\nthis type one hyper visor.\n\n320\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.870\nAnd notice the same thing,\nhardware is actually still down here.\n\n321\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.720\nBut now notice that I am missing\nthat host operating system.\n\n322\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.550\nNow that doesn't mean that it can't\nbe there, what it means is that now\n\n323\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.960\nthe virtual machine monitor\nruns underneath everything.\n\n324\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.540\nSo that every machine I bring up, whether\nI consider it the host operating system or\n\n325\n00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:50.360\nwhether it's a guest VM that I have,\nit's actually on top of the hypervisor,\n\n326\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.550\nand so you will see this and\nthis now allows for what?\n\n327\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:59.100\nOne layer of abstraction in between\nthose VM's and the hardware.\n\n328\n00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.500\nWell, one instead of two means what?\n\n329\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.710\nA lot less docking,\n\n330\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:08.140\na lot more direct access in that hardware\nmeans better performance for each VM and\n\n331\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:13.010\nbeing able to actually split up the\nresources here is really the key, right.\n\n332\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.110\nDividing up more resources that are\navailable, instead of doing the idea here\n\n333\n00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.500\nof saying, I've got to remember that\nthere's a host operating system, and\n\n334\n00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.080\nit also needs to run at the same time,\nand we'll still talk about that,\n\n335\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.700\nthere's still a little bit more for\nus to understand than that.\n\n336\n00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.390\nBut here, when we start seeing it, so\nnotice that it is missing a layer right\n\n337\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.590\nhere and here are some of the examples\nthat you'll see in today's world as well.\n\n338\n00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.030\nSo of course, the popular ones that\nare out there is Microsoft's Hyper-V.\n\n339\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:44.300\nNow, this one is second or third place\nin comparison when you talk about\n\n340\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.090\nwhat do people run in businesses and\nwhat do they run on server hardware.\n\n341\n00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.990\nNow remember that when we\ntalk about server hardware.\n\n342\n00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.290\nIf you're not familiar with it,\nthe difference between that and a PC?\n\n343\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.350\nMuch more powerful.\n\n344\n00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.140\nOkay?\n\n345\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.640\nMuch faster access.\n\n346\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.410\nHigher performance.\n\n347\n00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.520\nMuch more powerful.\n\n348\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.350\nPeople always make fun of me.\n\n349\n00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.335\nI use the term it's a beefier hardware.\n\n350\n00:18:01.335 --> 00:18:02.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay?\n\n351\n00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.490\nIs what I use.\n\n352\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.370\nAnd that's really the best\nway to describe it.\n\n353\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:09.040\nInstead of one processor on\nyour motherboard, there's two.\n\n354\n00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.310\nOkay.\nSo you may have even more than that.\n\n355\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.410\nAnd even inside of those,\nthere's actually multiple cores.\n\n356\n00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.590\nAnd instead of the maxed out machine\nthat you might have at a workstation,\n\n357\n00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.650\nlet's say 16 gigs of RAM, heck,\nthis thing might not max out.\n\n358\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.160\nSo let's say that on that motherboard\nyou can have up to 64 gigs of RAM, or\n\n359\n00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.450\n128 gigs, that's a lot more.\n\n360\n00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:31.980\nAnd instead of me being able to max\nout my hard drive at one terrabyte or\n\n361\n00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.400\nyou know a terrabyte and\n\n362\n00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.740\na half, we're talking about multiple\nterabytes that are in there.\n\n363\n00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.910\nMaybe even hundreds of terabytes\nthat we can add in there.\n\n364\n00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.980\nSo it's designed to be super beefy and\n\n365\n00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.110\nwe need to take advantage\nof all that hardware.\n\n366\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.790\nAnd that's what this type\none type of hypervisor does.\n\n367\n00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.660\nSo when you talk about Microsoft HyperV,\n\n368\n00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.030\nthis is Microsoft's version of\ndoing what they need to do.\n\n369\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.640\nAnd that's a very popular version out\nthere, but it's not the most popular.\n\n370\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.800\nThe most popular one that's still out\nthere in the business world right now and\n\n371\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.650\ntoday is of course VMWare's ESX.\n\n372\n00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:03.760\nAnd then there's ESXi,\n\n373\n00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.272\nwhich is a free edition that you and I can\nactually download and use we're actually\n\n374\n00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:08.080\ngoing to be doing that one--\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.570\n>> because it's free and\n\n376\n00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.120\nthat's something that we can do.\n\n377\n00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.100\nAnd then, of course, Linux has their\nbases and divisions here based off of\n\n378\n00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.730\nwhat we call KVM, the Kernel Virtual\nMachine manager that's out there as well.\n\n379\n00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.280\nAnd so\nRed Hat runs kind of a version of this.\n\n380\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.340\nIBM runs some different\nones that are out there.\n\n381\n00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.200\nA KVM is kind of\nthe beginning basis as well.\n\n382\n00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.370\nAnd are there much more on that?\n\n383\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.470\nThere probably are.\n\n384\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.610\nThere's plenty of them.\n\n385\n00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.880\nBut when it comes down to this.\n\n386\n00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.650\nYou may hear this, you may also hear the\nterm Citrix Zen server and believe it or\n\n387\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.530\nnot, that's the one that we actually\nuse right here at ITPro TV.\n\n388\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.880\nThat's because it's a very\nstable environment for us.\n\n389\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.100\nIt didn't really cost us\nmuch to bring it up as well.\n\n390\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.660\nBut all of these have\ntheir benefits to it.\n\n391\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.040\nThe goal behind this, of course, is a 24\nhour a day, always up and running network\n\n392\n00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.530\nthat's completely virtualized just about,\nbesides the base hardware that we're on.\n\n393\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.110\nAnd we really do like it because it\ndoes give us those advantages too.\n\n394\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.910\nSo if you're beginning, right?\n\n395\n00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.250\nIf this is your first time doing it,\nI'm not saying you can't start here, but\n\n396\n00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.030\nusually it does require\na bit more knowledge and\n\n397\n00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.300\nlearning to be able to do so.\n\n398\n00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.430\nBut, we'll being doing a couple of\nexamples throughout the series as well.\n\n399\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.030\n>> Very good.\nSo,\n\n400\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.560\nwe've got a couple of choices then\nto make when we're looking at our\n\n401\n00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.530\nvirtualization technologies.\n\n402\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:22.390\nWe got those type ones that\nare a little more robust and do not\n\n403\n00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.250\nhave that underlying operating system, so\nwe get a lot more performance out of them,\n\n404\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.520\nbecause really, the virtualization is\ngetting direct access to that hardware.\n\n405\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.350\nAnd then we've got our type twos which do\nhave that underlying operating system.\n\n406\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.200\nThey're more like an application\nthat you would go and download.\n\n407\n00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.450\nLike when you install Office,\nyou install Virtual Box.\n\n408\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.290\nIt's just like any other program.\n\n409\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.940\nYou launch it off of your start menu,\nit runs like another application.\n\n410\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.860\nSo it's a great place if I'm just doing\ntesting or some kind of development, or\n\n411\n00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.400\njust want to play around\nwith virtualization.\n\n412\n00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.770\nSo decisions to make there.\n\n413\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.820\nSo how do we get started Ronnie?\n\n414\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:00.390\nWhat's our first big step now that\nwe've got all this information?\n\n415\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:04.800\n>> Well, we really have to begin back with\nthe hardware that we have and how much of\n\n416\n00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.520\na commitment are we willing to make and\nto learning this technology, right?\n\n417\n00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.730\nSo let's go back to my screen just for\na moment as I make sure that you\n\n418\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.540\nsee that comparison here, once again\nbetween type one and type two, so\n\n419\n00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.450\nhere's the first, I say one, it's one\nof the decisions you have to make,\n\n420\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.390\nwhich one are you going to commit to,\nright?\n\n421\n00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.110\nIf you're going to commit to a type one,\n\n422\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.880\nand you're gong to day can\nI run it on my machine?\n\n423\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.870\nWell, more than likely you can.\n\n424\n00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.740\nYou have to look at\nthe minimum requirements for\n\n425\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.860\ninstalling that type one hype advisor,\nyou've just got to.\n\n426\n00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.660\nSo you go to each one of those programs,\nyou do a little bit of web research, and\n\n427\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.150\nyou type in, hey, here's my type one\nhyper visor I'm going to choose.\n\n428\n00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.800\nJust take a look and see if there\nare any minimum requirements for them.\n\n429\n00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.580\nAnd if there is a minimum\nhardware requirement,\n\n430\n00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.850\nyour machine has to be able to do that,\nso first and foremost,\n\n431\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.050\nyou have to understand\nthat minimum requirement.\n\n432\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:58.690\nThe nice thing about it is that as you\ninstall it, your type one hyper visor,\n\n433\n00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.710\nright, once you get it installed, it means\nyour virtual machines can share in all\n\n434\n00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.560\nof the RAM, hard-drive space, and\n\n435\n00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.450\neverything that it actually needs\nbesides those minimum requirements.\n\n436\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.295\nSo let me give you an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n437\n00:22:11.295 --> 00:22:15.760\nBecause this was one of the first ones\nthat I dealt with which is a zen server,\n\n438\n00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.960\nwhere I installed a type one hypervisor.\n\n439\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.970\nAnd I said, I've got to run four virtual\nmachines on this older server here.\n\n440\n00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:28.130\nBut I had a limitation of RAM, I had\na limitation of hard drive space, and\n\n441\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:32.610\nso I didn't realize how little\nthis hypervisor could run on.\n\n442\n00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:38.470\nSo when I ended up looking it up,\nit only required 200 megabytes\n\n443\n00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:43.700\nof free space on the hard drive, and\nit really only required a little bit, like\n\n444\n00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:48.820\n128 megabytes of RAM to be able to run,\nand that's in a production environment.\n\n445\n00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.774\nSo that meant that I could take\nthe remaining of those four gigs or\n\n446\n00:22:51.774 --> 00:22:56.330\neight gigs, I can't even remember,\nI should, but I can't remember, but\n\n447\n00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:00.860\nI could actually put as many virtual\nmachines on there and use all of that RAM\n\n448\n00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.290\nthat was available, and not have to worry\nabout that underlying operating system.\n\n449\n00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.220\nNow, when we talk about\na type two hypervisor,\n\n450\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.370\nit really doesn't require as\nmuch commitment from you.\n\n451\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:12.690\nLike Mike said, you go out and\n\n452\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.580\nyou go let me take a look at the\nrequirements, yeah my machine has that.\n\n453\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.310\nBut now you have to add on top of that.\n\n454\n00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.380\nWhat am I adding?\n\n455\n00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.480\nIf I'm running, let's say for an example,\nWindows 10 on my PC, well, you\n\n456\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.540\nhave to go and find out what's the minimum\noperating requirement for Windows 10.\n\n457\n00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:33.610\nSo if it says I can install on\na 60 gig hard drive, perfectly\n\n458\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:38.860\ngreat as long as you have greater than\na 60 gig hard drive to actually install.\n\n459\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.120\nIf it says I need a minimum\nof two gigs of RAM,\n\n460\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.660\nwell, you know you have to have at\nleast two gigs to run on there.\n\n461\n00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.900\nBut now if you pick the type\ntwo hypervisor that says,\n\n462\n00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.160\nhey, we actually say that you need\na minimum of four gigs of RAM, and\n\n463\n00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.510\nyou only have two gigs available, well\nnow you're actually in trouble, right?\n\n464\n00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.592\nBecause you can still install.\n\n465\n00:23:56.592 --> 00:24:00.143\nLet's say you have four gigs, but\nremember that all that's left them for\n\n466\n00:24:00.143 --> 00:24:02.434\nyour Hypervisor and\nyour type two Hypervisor,\n\n467\n00:24:02.434 --> 00:24:04.968\nis you're splitting those two gigs,\nbecause why?\n\n468\n00:24:04.968 --> 00:24:09.740\nYour host operating system is\ngonna require the 2 gigs of RAM.\n\n469\n00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.430\nIt's gonna require the 60 gig hard drive.\n\n470\n00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.850\nAnd you only have a 256 gig hard drive.\n\n471\n00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.870\nRemember that you can't\nmake a 128 gig hard drive,\n\n472\n00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.810\nyou have four virtual machines to run.\n\n473\n00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.194\nSo you do have to think about\na combination of things when you\n\n474\n00:24:25.194 --> 00:24:29.675\nchoose the idea of which one of these to\nrun, just at the basic hardware level.\n\n475\n00:24:29.675 --> 00:24:31.703\nAnd if you're gonna be running type II,\n\n476\n00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:35.285\nyou have to consider not only\nthe minimum Hypervisor requirement, but\n\n477\n00:24:35.285 --> 00:24:39.301\nalso the minimum of the underlying\noperating system, and there's even more.\n\n478\n00:24:39.301 --> 00:24:42.870\nRemember that on your guest VMs as well,\nright?\n\n479\n00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.610\nEach one of them that says yeah,\n\n480\n00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:49.480\nI need 2 gigs of RAM run, that means\nthat's the minimum it's gonna require.\n\n481\n00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.759\nSo if you go I wanna run two extra VMs and\nyou only have 4 gigs of memory.\n\n482\n00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:54.267\nWell, and\n\n483\n00:24:54.267 --> 00:24:58.172\nyou're running a host machine like Windows\n10 over here on the righthand side.\n\n484\n00:24:58.172 --> 00:25:01.605\nThat's 2 gigs, now each of my\nVMs actually require 2 gigs.\n\n485\n00:25:01.605 --> 00:25:05.960\nThat's 6 gigs of RAM, and so if you\nhave 8, that's great, but if you have 4,\n\n486\n00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.210\nyou're only gonna run one of them,\nbecause you have to divide it all up.\n\n487\n00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.570\nSo there is a little bit of math\nthat you have to be able to do,\n\n488\n00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.870\nbut hopefully not complicated.\n\n489\n00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.160\nIf I can do it, Mike, I think anybody\nelse on this planet can do it.\n\n490\n00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.610\nI can count to ten most days.\n\n491\n00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:20.381\n>> Most of the time, right?\n\n492\n00:25:20.381 --> 00:25:21.801\nEspecially when I take my shoes off.\n\n493\n00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:23.222\n>> Yeah, if I take my shoes off, I'm good.\n\n494\n00:25:23.222 --> 00:25:23.844\nThat's right.\n\n495\n00:25:23.844 --> 00:25:28.105\n>> I mean I guess that's the big thing,\nRonnie, then that we have to remember,\n\n496\n00:25:28.105 --> 00:25:33.180\nis these virtual machines are just like a\nphysical machine, they require resources.\n\n497\n00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.680\nJust like my machine in\norder to start it up and\n\n498\n00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.410\nrun my operating system and\ndo my daily job, I need CPU.\n\n499\n00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.240\nI need RAM and I need disk space.\n\n500\n00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:49.450\nSo if I go and create virtual machines,\nwell they need CPU and RAM and disk space.\n\n501\n00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.548\nAnd the only place they're gonna\nget it is from my machine.\n\n502\n00:25:52.548 --> 00:25:56.560\nSo I've gotta start dividing\nup what resources I have\n\n503\n00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.210\namongst my physical machine and\nall the VMs that I wanna create.\n\n504\n00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.650\nSo it's those physical resources\nthat are really gonna limit\n\n505\n00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:05.850\nhow many machines I can make.\n\n506\n00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.935\nCuz, as you were saying,\nI'll try to do your math again there.\n\n507\n00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:11.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I have 8 gigs of RAM on my laptop\n\n508\n00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:17.190\nand my host OS requires, let's say 2,\nall right, well now, I'm down to 6 left.\n\n509\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.886\nSo if each one of my VMs needs 2,\nthen I've got 6 divided by 2,\n\n510\n00:26:20.886 --> 00:26:23.840\nthat means I can make three more VMs and\nthat's it.\n\n511\n00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.384\nI'm out of RAM, I can't make any more.\n\n512\n00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:30.131\nSo it's all about when we're talking\nabout picking our platform and\n\n513\n00:26:30.131 --> 00:26:32.585\ndeciding how we wanna go and\nwhat we wanna do,\n\n514\n00:26:32.585 --> 00:26:36.410\nthe first place is thinking about\nwhat resources do I have available?\n\n515\n00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.460\nBecause that's going to\nbe a big limiting factor.\n\n516\n00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.140\n>> It really is.\n\n517\n00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.833\nOn top of that,\nalso the idea of disk space, right?\n\n518\n00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:47.543\nWe go okay, so I can actually make 64 gigs\non each one of those virtual machines and\n\n519\n00:26:47.543 --> 00:26:49.762\nnow you start to think about it.\n\n520\n00:26:49.762 --> 00:26:54.674\nI've got 256,\nI've got four 256 files there that\n\n521\n00:26:54.674 --> 00:26:57.753\nare now jamming up the whole thing.\n\n522\n00:26:57.753 --> 00:27:01.296\nYou don't have any free space left for\nyour host operating system to run.\n\n523\n00:27:01.296 --> 00:27:04.745\nYou're gonna see that it's gonna become\nvery terrible for you to try and run.\n\n524\n00:27:04.745 --> 00:27:08.885\nThe good thing is most of them\nwill give you a warning that says,\n\n525\n00:27:08.885 --> 00:27:12.995\nlook, you really don't have the resources\nto be able to create what you want to.\n\n526\n00:27:12.995 --> 00:27:16.005\nSo they do help you out in that sense.\n\n527\n00:27:16.005 --> 00:27:18.320\nBut it's a hard way for\nyou to learn, right?\n\n528\n00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:18.970\nIt really is.\n\n529\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:23.160\n>> I remember first starting getting into\nvirtualization, and I made a few VMs.\n\n530\n00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.470\nAnd you install the operating system on\nthose VMs, you do all the updates for\n\n531\n00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.610\nthose VMs.\n\n532\n00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.160\nYou install a couple applications\non those VMs, and then one day I'm\n\n533\n00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.950\nusing my laptop and I'm out of disk space,\nI'm like, what the heck is going on?\n\n534\n00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.090\nWhere is all my disk space?\n\n535\n00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:42.140\nOh yeah, I've got those three Windows\nvirtual machines that are each eating up\n\n536\n00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.390\na good chunk of space, so\nit's easy to kind of forget about it.\n\n537\n00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.870\nYou gotta think about what\nresources you have and\n\n538\n00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.120\nthen divide them up amongst\nthe VMs that you're creating.\n\n539\n00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.304\nAnd then there's other things beside\n\n540\n00:27:52.304 --> 00:27:53.980\nresources that we have to deal with,\nright?\n\n541\n00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.940\n>> There are different things that\nwe have to worry about as well.\n\n542\n00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.810\nOnce we start saying we wanna\ncreate these virtual machines,\n\n543\n00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:01.450\nyou know the way that\nwe're talking about it,\n\n544\n00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.150\nit doesn't cost you any money right now,\nI mean it really doesn't.\n\n545\n00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.340\nOh yeah, I'll create this, I'll do this,\n\n546\n00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.720\nI'll run Windows server 2012,\nI'll run Windows 10.\n\n547\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.750\nYou can do all that, but the limitation\nthough is where it starts costing you at\n\n548\n00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.510\ntimes is gonna be in terms of licensing.\n\n549\n00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:22.230\nSo even though you're running this in\na test environment maybe for yourself, or\n\n550\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.990\nyou're running it in\na production environment.\n\n551\n00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.130\nThat's where we normally\nhave to worry about it more,\n\n552\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.630\nis in a production environment.\n\n553\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.780\nEach one of those VMs also\nhas to be licensed to do so.\n\n554\n00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.500\n>> Wait, what?\n\n555\n00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.190\n>> Yeah.\n>> So just because I put it in virtual\n\n556\n00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.500\nmachine, that doesn't mean it's free and\nI can do whatever I want.\n\n557\n00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.750\n>> That's exactly right, so your single\nretail copy that says it's good for\n\n558\n00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.930\none install doesn't mean that\nyou get to reuse that and\n\n559\n00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:48.570\nsay I'm gonna create ten different VMs off\nof it and not worry about licensing it.\n\n560\n00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.100\nIn a production environment,\nthat's a big no-no.\n\n561\n00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.980\nAnd actually, even in a testing\nenvironment, it should be a big no-no for\n\n562\n00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.930\nyou, as well.\n\n563\n00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.740\nNow, the good thing is there's a lot\nof the operating systems that we're\n\n564\n00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.500\ntalking about that are free, like Linux.\n\n565\n00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.380\nLinux distros that are out there that are\nfree for you to be able to install, but,\n\n566\n00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.460\nlike, the Windows ones, not really.\n\n567\n00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.933\nRight?\nSo you do have to pay attention.\n\n568\n00:29:07.933 --> 00:29:11.280\nThat is to say, if you're running it\nin a virtual machine environment, yeah,\n\n569\n00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.740\nyou still have to actually license it.\n\n570\n00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.030\nAnd it means that you have to go out and\ndo it.\n\n571\n00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.950\nBut the good thing is, even from Windows,\n\n572\n00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.800\nif you do your favorite search engine,\nright.\n\n573\n00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.670\nAnd do a search for like Windows 10\neval copy or Windows 8 eval copies,\n\n574\n00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.260\nyou're actually likely to find those.\n\n575\n00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.000\nNow those will help you out to a point,\nright?\n\n576\n00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.960\nThey'll give you like a 30 day evaluation,\nthat you can download the software and\n\n577\n00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.870\ninstall it in there, but\nthat means after 30 days,\n\n578\n00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.130\nyou need to delete it and\nactually start all over.\n\n579\n00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.380\nIt's not really harmful,\nit's actually a great way for\n\n580\n00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.480\nyou to get more familiar with\nthe virtualization technology.\n\n581\n00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.340\nBut at the same time, if you're gonna\nrun this and you're gonna say, oh no,\n\n582\n00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.130\nI want this to be my other machine.\n\n583\n00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.670\nSo if I'm running Windows 10,\n\n584\n00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:52.190\nI still want my Windows 8 machine, well\nyou do need to license those things too.\n\n585\n00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.900\nSo it can be expensive.\n\n586\n00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.870\nMost corporations, of course, end up with\nvolume licensing, so it's not so bad.\n\n587\n00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:02.790\nBut for you and me, you do have to be\ncareful with that issue of licensing, and\n\n588\n00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:07.230\nit is something that we should as\nIT professionals really respect.\n\n589\n00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:10.300\n>> Absolutely, we don't wanna be\nthe one that gets our organization in\n\n590\n00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.540\ntrouble because we're running\nfive servers that are unlicensed.\n\n591\n00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.850\nWe get audited by Microsoft.\n\n592\n00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.797\nThey come in and\nwe end up paying fines or what have you.\n\n593\n00:30:17.797 --> 00:30:21.126\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So [LAUGH] and that's in the mild case,\n\n594\n00:30:21.126 --> 00:30:21.714\nright?\n\n595\n00:30:21.714 --> 00:30:22.215\n>> Yeah.\n\n596\n00:30:22.215 --> 00:30:25.980\n>> So we gotta make sure we're licensing\nthese, just like any other machine.\n\n597\n00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.370\nWe've gotta make sure that the vendors\nare getting their money we're paying for\n\n598\n00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.550\nthose applications or\nthose operating systems.\n\n599\n00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.420\nAnd then we gotta choose, right,\nbetween the Type I and Type II.\n\n600\n00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.050\n>> We really do.\n\n601\n00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:37.039\nAnd we need to make that particular\nchoice, and once we do so,\n\n602\n00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:38.310\nwe're pretty much fine.\n\n603\n00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.340\nNow there's a little bit more hardware\nrequirement I wanna point out some details\n\n604\n00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.130\nto, so let me show what I'm also\nhaving to worry about as well.\n\n605\n00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.440\nSo here on my screen,\nI just made a simple list.\n\n606\n00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.498\nNow, I know it's not the prettiest list\nin the world but it's fairly simple.\n\n607\n00:30:52.498 --> 00:30:53.912\nIf you're gonna run a Hypervisor,\n\n608\n00:30:53.912 --> 00:30:56.130\nremember that you will see\nthose minimum requirements so\n\n609\n00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.370\nthese are things you definitely\nwanna make sure that you point out.\n\n610\n00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:03.041\nMost of the systems today that you run\neven like laptops and desktops and\n\n611\n00:31:03.041 --> 00:31:06.224\neverything, they're gonna\nbe 64 bit processors, okay,\n\n612\n00:31:06.224 --> 00:31:09.428\nwhich is really good because\nthat's what you really do want.\n\n613\n00:31:09.428 --> 00:31:13.699\nIt allows you to take advantage of more\nRAM on your system, whereas 32 bit,\n\n614\n00:31:13.699 --> 00:31:17.724\nespecially in the realm of Windows,\nlike Windows 7 and Windows Vista.\n\n615\n00:31:17.724 --> 00:31:20.962\nEven though they said that they\ncould recognize 4 gigs RAM,\n\n616\n00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:25.341\nmost of them end up recognizing about 3 at\na max, that was just a limitation of that\n\n617\n00:31:25.341 --> 00:31:27.770\noperating system in\nthe way that they did so.\n\n618\n00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.260\nBut 64 gig machine, or a 64 bit machine,\nI'm going to say it wrong,\n\n619\n00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:35.310\nis what actually allows you to\nrecognize a little bit more,\n\n620\n00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.670\nso you wanna make sure that\nyou're running that too.\n\n621\n00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.550\n>> And really it is a must,\n\n622\n00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:45.336\nbecause most of our OSs today would\nlove to get 4 gigs themselves, right?\n\n623\n00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:47.595\nSo I can't think about taking 4 gigs and\n\n624\n00:31:47.595 --> 00:31:50.262\nsplitting it up between\nten virtual machines.\n\n625\n00:31:50.262 --> 00:31:53.344\nThat's just not gonna work most likely.\n\n626\n00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:55.223\nSo 64 bit so we can access lots of RAM.\n\n627\n00:31:55.223 --> 00:31:56.431\nWhat else do we need?\n\n628\n00:31:56.431 --> 00:32:02.385\n>> We also need to make sure, and this is\nnot necessarily a technology requirement.\n\n629\n00:32:02.385 --> 00:32:04.797\nI wanna make sure I emphasize that.\n\n630\n00:32:04.797 --> 00:32:06.887\nBut there is that Intel VT right.\n\n631\n00:32:06.887 --> 00:32:10.180\nThe virtualization or\nthe hardware assisted virtualization.\n\n632\n00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.810\nOr AMD V, is the other one.\n\n633\n00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.850\nNow remember that this actually allows\nus to take advantage of the hardware,\n\n634\n00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.850\nminimizing a lot of that\noverhead that we used to have\n\n635\n00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.720\ninside a machine to be able to work.\n\n636\n00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.480\nAnd I'm saying this is\na personal requirement for me.\n\n637\n00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.130\nIf you wanna actually be able\nto take advantage of that and\n\n638\n00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:28.910\nmake your virtual machines work faster and\n\n639\n00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.700\nhigher performance,\nyou wanna make sure that this goes on.\n\n640\n00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.420\nBut there are some of those\nhypervisors that we've talked about\n\n641\n00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.620\nthat allow you to uncheck something and\nsay, don't take advantage of it.\n\n642\n00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.140\nAnd at that point you may be wondering\nlike why the heck would I do that.?\n\n643\n00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.210\nThat's a good question,\n\n644\n00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.830\nI don't have a clue why you would\nactually choose to do that.\n\n645\n00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.670\nBut normally what happens is if you're on\nan older machine and it doesn't have that,\n\n646\n00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:52.180\nthen of course you would actually not be\nable to take advantage of that as well.\n\n647\n00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:57.178\nBut there are, to give you\nan example here of virtual box,\n\n648\n00:32:57.178 --> 00:33:03.300\nthe earlier edition could only\nrun on 32-bit machines, okay.\n\n649\n00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.900\nBut inside of it, they could take\nadvantage and actually allow\n\n650\n00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.360\nyou to run a 64-bit machine which was\nsomething that we'd never heard of before.\n\n651\n00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.220\nAnd so virtual box got\nreally popular in the 32-bit\n\n652\n00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.200\ndays when their CPUs could actually say,\nall right, here's a 32-bit CPU but\n\n653\n00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.590\nyou're allowing me to\nvirtualize a 64-bit processor.\n\n654\n00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:25.190\nAnd it really did, because it\nactually emulated processor hardware.\n\n655\n00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.990\nNow, that's the difference.\n\n656\n00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.440\nIt didn't virtualize it, it didn't say,\n\n657\n00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.960\nhere's the hardware on the computer,\nlet me virtualize that.\n\n658\n00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.980\nIt just said,\nlet me lie to the operating system and\n\n659\n00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:37.010\ntell it I'm running a 64-bit processor,\nand it took it and it worked just fine.\n\n660\n00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.130\nSo I don't wanna say that this\nis a minimum requirement, but\n\n661\n00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.040\nit's a Ronnie minimum requirement there.\n\n662\n00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.380\nAnd then, of course,\nthere is this execution bit too.\n\n663\n00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.831\nIt's about the way we actually use RAM,\nand so a lot of this is about, and more\n\n664\n00:33:48.831 --> 00:33:53.714\nthan likely your CP already handles this\nstuff, and then of course, BIOS support.\n\n665\n00:33:53.714 --> 00:33:55.297\nYou have to make sure it's enabled.\n\n666\n00:33:55.297 --> 00:34:00.339\nSometimes you may go and install\na hyper V, or a hypervisor, hyper V.\n\n667\n00:34:00.339 --> 00:34:02.349\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you install a hypervisor onto your\n\n668\n00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:03.508\nmachine and it tells you,\n\n669\n00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:06.620\nthis machine doesn't support your\nvirtualization technology, and\n\n670\n00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.610\nyou go, wait a minute, I know it does,\nI know what the specs are on my machine.\n\n671\n00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:16.131\nBut a lot of it's disabled by default, so\ngo into RAM, not RAM, go into the setup.\n\n672\n00:34:16.131 --> 00:34:20.297\n[LAUGH] I'm not gonna be able to use any\nof the right words, Mike, forget it.\n\n673\n00:34:20.297 --> 00:34:23.271\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] Into BIOS And\nmake sure you go in and\n\n674\n00:34:23.271 --> 00:34:27.007\nfind where the virtualization is and\nenable that technology and\n\n675\n00:34:27.007 --> 00:34:28.750\nmake sure it actually works.\n\n676\n00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.037\nIt's very easy the first time, because you\ncan a little bit mixed up where you go,\n\n677\n00:34:32.037 --> 00:34:35.297\nhere's my specs and you go and install it\nand it tells you it doesn't support it.\n\n678\n00:34:35.297 --> 00:34:39.180\nIt's easy, you can go, well,\nmaybe I don't need to mess with this then.\n\n679\n00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.460\nGo in and check out your setup and\nsee if it actually is in there.\n\n680\n00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.380\nIf it is, turn it on and you'll see that\nyou'll probably be able to install it and\n\n681\n00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.930\nget started right away.\n\n682\n00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:48.860\nBut those are the basic things\nto really get us started,\n\n683\n00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.750\nis understanding we gotta\nmake those choices.\n\n684\n00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.890\nWe gotta understand those\nhardware requirements, and\n\n685\n00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:54.390\nthen we're about ready to go.\n\n686\n00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:54.950\n>> Very good.\nWell,\n\n687\n00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:57.560\na lot of great information there\ngetting us started down the road of\n\n688\n00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.360\nvirtualization.\n\n689\n00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:03.300\nWe've gotta make sure that we're running\nthat 64 bit system so we can get access to\n\n690\n00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:07.170\nthe large amounts of RAM that we're going\nto need to divide up amongst there.\n\n691\n00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.770\nWe've got to make sure our machine\nhopefully supports that Intel VT or\n\n692\n00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.660\nthe AMD V, we've gotta check our BIOS.\n\n693\n00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.825\nIt might support it, but\nit might not be turned on.\n\n694\n00:35:15.825 --> 00:35:17.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just go into your setup and\n\n695\n00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.510\njust turn a check mark on.\n\n696\n00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:21.040\nEverything should be good there.\n\n697\n00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.880\nWe talked about that no execute option\nto try to keep our machines safe,\n\n698\n00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.390\nbeing able to block up parts of memory and\nprevent things from actually being\n\n699\n00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:31.340\nexecuted from there, so\nwe need that level of support.\n\n700\n00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.300\nThen we talked about the different\ntypes of hypervisors that we're\n\n701\n00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:34.890\ngoing to run into.\n\n702\n00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.130\nWe've got the, remember,\n\n703\n00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:40.570\nwe've got the type two which actually\nare the lower versions, right?\n\n704\n00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.410\nThese are the ones that install\nmore like an application.\n\n705\n00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.620\nThey run on top of their operating\nsystem so the performance isn't\n\n706\n00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.010\nquite there because we've got\na lot of extra overhead with the.\n\n707\n00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:54.930\nWhat was the word used for it as it\ngoes down through the operating system?\n\n708\n00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:55.862\nThe-\n>> Abstraction?\n\n709\n00:35:55.862 --> 00:35:56.570\n>> Abstraction.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n710\n00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:57.180\n>> There we go.\n\n711\n00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.100\nSo you've got a lot more of that\ngoing on which is gonna, of course,\n\n712\n00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.310\nhamper performance.\n\n713\n00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:05.310\nThen you've got the type ones,\nwhich get installed right on the hardware.\n\n714\n00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:11.110\nThere is no operating system between that\ntype one hypervisor, and your hardware.\n\n715\n00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:15.310\nSo you don't have the same\nabstraction layers to go through.\n\n716\n00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.520\nSo you're gonna get a lot better\nperformance out of something like that,\n\n717\n00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.430\nbut it is a little\nbigger of a committment.\n\n718\n00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.230\nBecause now I'm blowing away\nmy operating system, and\n\n719\n00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:25.940\nI'm installing this hypervisor\ndown underneath there.\n\n720\n00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.890\nWell, I shouldn't say blowing\naway the operating system.\n\n721\n00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:29.630\nBut we're gonna go over installing it.\n\n722\n00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:32.670\nBut it is slipping down between\nthe operating system and\n\n723\n00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.480\nthe underlying hardware.\n\n724\n00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.860\nSo a lot of things we gotta think about,\nRonnie.\n\n725\n00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.390\nThanks for all that information.\n\n726\n00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.680\nAnd in future episodes we're\nactually gonna take a look\n\n727\n00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.900\nat some of these technologies.\n\n728\n00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.230\nIf you've never seen VirtualBox and\nFusion and HyperV and\n\n729\n00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:49.300\nsome of those, stay tuned because we're\ngonna break them all down for you.\n\n730\n00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.430\nBut for this one Ronnie,\nwe are out of time.\n\n731\n00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.780\nSo signing off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n732\n00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:54.673\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n733\n00:36:54.673 --> 00:36:56.213\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n734\n00:36:56.213 --> 00:37:02.060\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.466\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:21.100\nAnd today we're looking at\nvirtualization technologies.\n\n5\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.160\nAnd, specifically,\nwe're gonna be installing one of those.\n\n6\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.357\nOne called Virtual Box.\n\n7\n00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.960\nAnd here to help us with that,\nis Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.700\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.990\n>> It is going well today.\n\n10\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.440\nAs we continue to take a look at some\nof these virtualization technologies,\n\n11\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.700\nwe're gonna begin relatively simply,\nright?\n\n12\n00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.010\nIf you are in the field of IT, and\nnow you're really starting and somebody's\n\n13\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.198\ntalking about virtualization technology,\nyou need to be familiar with it.\n\n14\n00:00:44.198 --> 00:00:48.050\nSo, we're gonna actually introduce you to\none of these tools that's very popular,\n\n15\n00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.090\nsomething that you can install right onto\nyour own desktop and get it working so\n\n16\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.110\nthat you can see what we're talking about.\n\n17\n00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.420\nSo, this particular tool\nis actually from Oracle.\n\n18\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.850\nCalled Oracle's VirtualBox.\n\n19\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.220\nAnd it's been out there for a long time.\n\n20\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.460\nI remember using it years and years ago.\n\n21\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.000\nAnd it's pretty much still one of\nthe tools that I really like to use\n\n22\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.350\neven today because it\nis a solid foundation.\n\n23\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.180\nAnd there's so\nmany different features on it.\n\n24\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.100\nEven though a lot of times when you\nactually talk about feature rich\n\n25\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.150\nenvironments, it does,\neven though it's a type two hypervisor,\n\n26\n00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.290\nwhich we've also talked about,\nwhich we normally think as just running on\n\n27\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.550\nthe desktop, there are some features in\nthere that are comparable to things that\n\n28\n00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.580\nyou would see running inside of\na production environment as well.\n\n29\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.620\nSo, what we wanna take a look\nat right now, of course,\n\n30\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.690\nis just making sure that\nwe can get it installed.\n\n31\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.950\nAnd so, we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand some of the things that we have\n\n32\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.060\nto understand, of course,\nto make sure it's installed.\n\n33\n00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.450\nWhere do you go and get it, and\nthe installation process of it, and\n\n34\n00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.730\nwhat do we have to consider when we do so.\n\n35\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.850\nSo, let's go ahead and talk about that\nidea of what we need to make sure of\n\n36\n00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.130\nwhen we talk about getting something\nlike Virtual Box installed here.\n\n37\n00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.850\nSo, let's go to my machine right away.\n\n38\n00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.020\nAnd let's make sure we understand what\nthe goal of what we're trying to do.\n\n39\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.950\nSo, in previous episodes we've\nalready taken a look at just a generic\n\n40\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.400\nidea of the virtualization process.\n\n41\n00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.860\nAnd now, we're at installing this\nType 2 Hypervisor over here on\n\n42\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.240\nthe left-hand side.\n\n43\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.320\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and name it.\n\n44\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.790\nI'm gonna be running a Windows 10 machine\nas my host machine in the background.\n\n45\n00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.770\nAnd then, we're gonna install that\nHypervisor, that virtual box.\n\n46\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.510\nAnd then we're gonna build a VM,\nis what we're gonna end up doing.\n\n47\n00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.130\nAnd maybe even a couple of VMs.\n\n48\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.480\nBut that is our goal in\nwhat we're gonna be doing.\n\n49\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.330\nAt least at the beginning.\n\n50\n00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.280\nWe'll create one at the beginning here.\n\n51\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.490\nSo, when we talk about the idea of getting\ninstalled, just like anything else,\n\n52\n00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.560\nwhether we're talking an operating system\nor talking about applications, we've gotta\n\n53\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.440\nremember that sometimes these applications\nare gonna actually install perfectly fine.\n\n54\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.370\nSometimes they may not.\n\n55\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.150\nAnd, with the Hypervisor,\nyou do have to be careful about whether or\n\n56\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.690\nnot your machine is gonna\nbe able to support it.\n\n57\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.120\nThe good thing is most machines today,\nokay, with the way that we have them\n\n58\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.770\nspecced out even on regular desktop\nmachines, they're not low-end machines.\n\n59\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.960\nEven, I hate to say it, even kind of the\neconomy-class machines are fairly beefy.\n\n60\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.100\nThey're fairly high performing\nmachine compared to when the code for\n\n61\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.090\na lot of these hypervisors were written.\n\n62\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.300\nSo, hardware wise, we're probably\nnot gonna have to worry too much.\n\n63\n00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.500\nThe only requirement that we\nhave to actually think about for\n\n64\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.980\nmost of these Type 2 Hypervisors is does\nit support that idea of Intel VT or AMD-V?\n\n65\n00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.180\n>> The good thing about\nVirtualBox is it doesn't care.\n\n66\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.780\nRight?\n\n67\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.280\nVirtualBox was written in a day before\nthis technology really got popular\n\n68\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.350\nto allow for lessening of the overhead and\nbeing able to directly map\n\n69\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.990\nto the physical hardware\nthrough that Intel VT or AMD-V.\n\n70\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.190\nSo, it doesn't really matter.\n\n71\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.180\nSo, VirtualBox is okay with it.\n\n72\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.510\nAnd more than likely, hardware wise,\nyou're not gonna have to be concerned.\n\n73\n00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.030\nThe only concern for you, then,\nis do you have enough of it\n\n74\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.825\nto run the number of virtual\nmachines you want to run.\n\n75\n00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:57.740\nAnd that means do you have enough RAM?\n\n76\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.440\nDo you have enough hard drive\nspace to be able to do it?\n\n77\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.210\nAnd of course,\neverything else taken into consideration,\n\n78\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.100\nare you actually gonna be ready\nto do that, also with licensing?\n\n79\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.140\nSo, what else do we have to consider,\n\n80\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.042\nthen, when we install\nsomething like VirtualBox?\n\n81\n00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:20.490\nWell, remember that, because we're running\non top of this guest operating system,\n\n82\n00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.750\nwe have to concerned with that.\n\n83\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.220\nAnd that's where the requirement also for\nHyper-V, or\n\n84\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.690\n[LAUGH] Oracle's VirtualBox comes in.\n\n85\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.460\nI'm gonna use that no matter what.\n\n86\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.830\nApparently, I'm in love with that\ntechnology is what it comes down to.\n\n87\n00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.470\nSo, we have to worry\nabout stuff like that.\n\n88\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.890\nAnd that's what we need to take a look at.\n\n89\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.500\nOkay?\nSo,\n\n90\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.410\nwhen it comes down to some installation,\nnow this list is a little bit hefty here.\n\n91\n00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.210\nAnd I wanted you to see it in this format.\n\n92\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.950\nBecause you're looking like I'm not going\nto be able to read that whole thing.\n\n93\n00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.580\nI don't want you to.\n\n94\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.042\nWhat I want you to read realize is\nVirtualBox will just about install on\n\n95\n00:04:51.042 --> 00:04:51.725\nanything.\n\n96\n00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:52.615\nThat is the key.\n\n97\n00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:53.215\nOkay?\n\n98\n00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:56.015\nSo, when you go, oh, no,\nit only runs on Windows ME.\n\n99\n00:04:56.015 --> 00:04:58.265\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n100\n00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:01.873\nIt absolutely runs on just\nabout everything else.\n\n101\n00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:06.075\nSo, you actually see anywhere from\nVista with Service Pack 1 and later.\n\n102\n00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:10.190\nIt covers the whole gamut if you're\ntalking about desktop operating systems.\n\n103\n00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.250\nBut notice that we can even run it\non server operating systems as well.\n\n104\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.270\nSo, it really does cover a whole\nline of those operating systems.\n\n105\n00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.010\nSo, there's no limitation there.\n\n106\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.280\nIf you go, hey, what about Mac OS?\n\n107\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.525\nIt runs on older Max OS editions, too.\n\n108\n00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:27.930\nOkay?\n\n109\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.770\nAnd, of course, even the newest one.\n\n110\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.960\nI just checked out in\nVirtualBox's website, and\n\n111\n00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.160\nthey even support the latest one,\nEl Capitan.\n\n112\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.520\nSo, the one that I'm running.\n\n113\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.310\nI don't recommend it, but you\nabsolutely can run it if you choose to.\n\n114\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.350\nBut, yes,\nyou can even install VirtualBox on that.\n\n115\n00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.503\nSo, even though you might find some of\nthese Hyper-V, or Type 2 Hypervisors.\n\n116\n00:05:48.503 --> 00:05:52.460\nI told you I'm gonna use\nHyper-V no matter what [LAUGH].\n\n117\n00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.420\nHypervisors, okay,\n\n118\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.685\nmight end up telling you that it only\nruns on Windows operating systems.\n\n119\n00:05:57.685 --> 00:06:01.480\nVirtualBox, the great choice\nis regardless, right?\n\n120\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.190\nWhether you're actually on a Mac or\n\n121\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.450\nwhether you're on a regular Windows PC,\nyou can run it.\n\n122\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.850\nAnd Mike, between the both of us,\nwe actually use both.\n\n123\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.490\nSo, we can see why it's actually\na great system for us to deal with.\n\n124\n00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.140\n>> Absolutely.\n\n125\n00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.060\nIt's fantastic to find a program that I\ncan use on any one of my laptops no matter\n\n126\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.670\nwhat they're running.\n\n127\n00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.000\nAnd in the bottom of that list, Ronnie,\nI even see the Linux distro down there.\n\n128\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.820\nSo, I can install it on my\nLinux machines as well.\n\n129\n00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.570\nIf I need a virtualization technology\nthat I can move between base platforms,\n\n130\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.810\nthis is the way to go.\n\n131\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.830\n>> This one really is.\n\n132\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.340\nSo, it's a great starting point.\n\n133\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.610\nAnd that's why I wanted\nto choose it as one\n\n134\n00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.400\nof the technologies that we demonstrate.\n\n135\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.960\nI was about to say one\nof the ones we don't.\n\n136\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.080\nAs one of the technologies that\nwe really wanna demonstrate here.\n\n137\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.270\nBecause it is diverse.\n\n138\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.960\nSo, if you love running Linux,\nyou got one that you can use.\n\n139\n00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.000\nAnd the good thing is the steps that\nwe'll show you here, they translate over.\n\n140\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.120\nI think, as far as I remember,\nthe interface is actually identical.\n\n141\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.680\nAnd this is true whether you're on a Mac,\n\n142\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.530\nwhether you're on a Windows machine,\nwhether you're on a Linux based distro,\n\n143\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.860\nyou'll be able to actually run it and\nbe able to see how it's done.\n\n144\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.750\nSo, it is a great technology.\n\n145\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.840\nI've been using this thing for\nyears and years.\n\n146\n00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.030\nAnd I really do, I like it.\n\n147\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.920\nIt's consistent.\n\n148\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.100\nIt's solid.\n\n149\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.400\nThere's very little flakiness\nto the newer editions.\n\n150\n00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.930\nNow, there have been a couple of editions\nin the past where it was completely flaky.\n\n151\n00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.330\nAnd the nice thing about Virtual Box\nis that when they realize\n\n152\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.300\nthat they immediately, even on the website\nsaying look any issues that you're having\n\n153\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.160\nright now just go back and\nrevert to the previous one and\n\n154\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.890\nwe'll fix it in the next\nedition up from that.\n\n155\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.230\nAnd they did it within months.\n\n156\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.910\nIt didn't take years and\nyears and ignoring stuff.\n\n157\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.170\nThese guys really do.\n\n158\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.420\nThey care about the community, and\nthey put time and effort in doing it.\n\n159\n00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.640\nSo, here's the base requirement.\n\n160\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.019\nIs whatever operating system\nyou want to run, it set.\n\n161\n00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:48.040\nSo, VituralBox will say, hey,\n\n162\n00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.630\nif you can install on here,\nit meets the hardware requirements.\n\n163\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.056\nIt meets at least a base operating\nsystem requirements that we want to\n\n164\n00:07:55.056 --> 00:07:56.975\nconsider when we take a look.\n\n165\n00:07:56.975 --> 00:07:59.986\nBut there's also other considerations,\nright,\n\n166\n00:07:59.986 --> 00:08:02.514\nwhen we go back to that\nType II Hypervisor.\n\n167\n00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:07.266\nWe've got to remember that we have\nto consider that this base operating\n\n168\n00:08:07.266 --> 00:08:12.200\nsystem is going to consume a portion\nof these physical resources.\n\n169\n00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.400\nAnd what that means is, now that I've\ninstalled a hypervisor on it, that means\n\n170\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.380\nwhatever is left, right, is the remaining\npool that I can actually choose from.\n\n171\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.510\nSo I need to be careful and think about\nlike the number of VMs I'm going to\n\n172\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.190\ncreate, and how much resources we're\ngoing to assign to them as well.\n\n173\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.140\nSo we do have to think about stuff like\nthat, so do remember as we take a look.\n\n174\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.800\nSo here's kind of the breakdown\ngraphically of what I'm talking about.\n\n175\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.660\nSo remember that when you\ntake a look at the pool of\n\n176\n00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.340\nhardware resources that are available,\nright?\n\n177\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.680\nThat we have to remember that Windows 10\nwill have its own requirement, at least in\n\n178\n00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.880\nour system here, and on this one virtual\nbox doesn't have to have its own,\n\n179\n00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.940\nbecause Windows 10 will\nprobably meet it for us.\n\n180\n00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.120\nBut then each VM here, will also\nhave to have it's own as well, and\n\n181\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.350\nthat's what you have to consider.\n\n182\n00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.270\nIt's not just,\nif I create three Windows 10 VMs, and\n\n183\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.740\ngo oh yeah, that only counts for one.\n\n184\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.040\nNo, each VM will have\nit's own requirement, so\n\n185\n00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.440\nwe also need to consider\nthat together as well.\n\n186\n00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.600\nSo let's just kind of make sure that\nwe understand that example, right.\n\n187\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.570\nSo when we come down to\nthe host requirement then for\n\n188\n00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.020\nWindows 10, here's the basic.\n\n189\n00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.550\nNow, as far as the CPU goes, we're not\ngoing to worry about that one too much.\n\n190\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.440\nIt's going to virtualize,\nit's going to be fine.\n\n191\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.090\nBut what we're really worried\nabout are things like the RAM and\n\n192\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.160\nof course the hard drive space, is clearly\nthe things that we have to worry about.\n\n193\n00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.910\nBecause those are the resources that\nare going to be sliced up, right.\n\n194\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.160\nThe CPU is kind of sliced up,\nbut not in a way that you and\n\n195\n00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.040\nI are going to be able\nto control very easily.\n\n196\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.330\nBut this stuff we have to actually worry\nabout, because these will essentially\n\n197\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.650\nbecome diced up to the point where as\nlong as that VM is running and on and\n\n198\n00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.040\neven when it's saved, we got to worry it's\ngoing to take up some of those resources\n\n199\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.850\nthat are available, and so\nwe have to actually say hey,\n\n200\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.200\nhere I have to take a look at my overall\ncomputer here, and I have to make sure\n\n201\n00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.340\nthat I do not eat into these resources\nwhen I build my virtual machines, okay.\n\n202\n00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.510\nSo then every OS from that point on,\nif I'm going to be, let's say,\n\n203\n00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:18.110\ninstalling a Windows 2012 machine,\nwell that's also going to be required too.\n\n204\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.820\nAnd if I make multiple ones of those, each\none of those VMs is going to have that.\n\n205\n00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.670\nI have to be careful, if I eat up too much\nhard drive space where it doesn't allow my\n\n206\n00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.140\nhost operating system, of course,\nto be able to move some stuff around.\n\n207\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.450\nWell, then it's going to be problematic,\nif I actually use too much RAM.\n\n208\n00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.380\nVirtualBox is actually really good at\nthis, and this is one of those strange\n\n209\n00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.900\nthings where it's a free product and\nhas always been free.\n\n210\n00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.060\nAnd for all I know,\nit's always going to be free.\n\n211\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.630\nIt allows you to do over allocation,\n\n212\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.393\nwhich we normally don't find\nin type two hypervisors.\n\n213\n00:10:49.393 --> 00:10:53.100\nType one you generally do, but\nin type one hypervisor now,\n\n214\n00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.530\nwhat the heck is that about?\n\n215\n00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.810\nThat means you can over assign\nthe amount of RAM that you'd have, okay?\n\n216\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.575\nSo even if you only have eight gig,\neight gigs is kind of pretty hefty still.\n\n217\n00:11:02.575 --> 00:11:03.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's say that you\n\n218\n00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.290\nonly have four gigs of RAM, and\n\n219\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.280\nyou still need to actually do well like\ntwo or three gigs on each virtual machine.\n\n220\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.330\nThen let's say you come close to nine,\nit won't allow you to do that.\n\n221\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.880\nIt won't allow you to\nactually over assign that,\n\n222\n00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.790\nbecause what it knows is that it can\nkind of park one of those VMs and go,\n\n223\n00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.170\nlet me rob some of that space there and\nlet's assign that to this active VM and\n\n224\n00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.540\nthen when you go active on the other one\nit knows how to pull back and forth.\n\n225\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.687\nAnd this sub,\nI think we see that with like Hyper-V,\n\n226\n00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:29.990\nthe one that I keep mentioning.\n\n227\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.495\nBut on a Type two hypervisor Mike,\nthat's pretty hefty, so\n\n228\n00:11:33.495 --> 00:11:38.099\nyou can even do that inside a VirtualBox,\nand a lot of times when I start thinking\n\n229\n00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:42.910\nabout needing to build another lab, I go,\nI could bring up a Hyper-V machine, but\n\n230\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.485\nwhy not just do it in VirtualBox, because\nit allows me to do some of this stuff.\n\n231\n00:11:47.485 --> 00:11:52.319\nSo those are the basic\nconsiderations that at least we have\n\n232\n00:11:52.319 --> 00:11:56.240\nto be familiar with as\nwe get started here.\n\n233\n00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.830\nSo remember, the math,\nit is very important.\n\n234\n00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.520\nAnd if we're going to be doing this for\na living we've got to understand that, or\n\n235\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.050\nwe're going to be tripped up at times.\n\n236\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.840\n>> Yeah, and it's really up to us, right?\n\n237\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.280\nWe could take a machine that has two gigs\nof RAM on it and install Virtual Box.\n\n238\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.508\nBut then the problem is I have no RAM left\nover to give to the virtual machines.\n\n239\n00:12:15.508 --> 00:12:17.420\nIt's going to let me install Virtual Box,\n\n240\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.440\nI'm just going to fail when it comes\ntime to actually creating a VM.\n\n241\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.754\nSo, you know the hardware requirements\nsome of it just to get it installed you've\n\n242\n00:12:24.754 --> 00:12:28.750\ngot to have, but then the rest of\nit is what VMs do I want to create,\n\n243\n00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.340\nwhat am I going to be able to create,\n\n244\n00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.160\nhow many resources do I have left after\nwe take into what Ronnie told us?\n\n245\n00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.033\nWe've got to think about that host\noperating system needs resources to run\n\n246\n00:12:39.033 --> 00:12:40.220\nVirtualBox.\n\n247\n00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.560\nWhatever is left,\n\n248\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.850\nwe can divide up amongst the virtual\nmachines that we want to create.\n\n249\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.370\n>> And that is really kind of the key,\nat least in the basic understanding.\n\n250\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.220\nSo let's go ahead and get started,\n\n251\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.150\nand let's take a look at how we do\nthe installation process as well.\n\n252\n00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.690\nAnd you can see it's not very difficult,\nbut we at least want to get started here.\n\n253\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.620\nSo let's go to my computer and\nthat will help us out.\n\n254\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.370\nSo there it is.\nI'm running a Windows 10 machine, but\n\n255\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.180\nyou don't know what the specs are,\nso let's go and\n\n256\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.390\nat least show you some of the basic\nspecifications here for my machine.\n\n257\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:16.010\nIf I right click on the Windows button,\nand then I go to.\n\n258\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.740\nWhere is My computer icon?\n\n259\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.310\nOh!\n\n260\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.150\nIt's not here anymore.\n\n261\n00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.770\nI forgot.\n[LAUGH] It's under system.\n\n262\n00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.900\nI always say computer, and it's actually\nunder the word system is what I\n\n263\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.920\nhave to remember, so right here you can\ntake a look and see what I have access to.\n\n264\n00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.720\nIt's Windows 10, everything is\nactually good, and also the licensing,\n\n265\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.090\nnotice says activated, and that's what we\nwant to make sure of, and there it is.\n\n266\n00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:40.190\nI've got a Xeon processor,\nand it's pretty decent.\n\n267\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:45.350\nI've got eight gigs of RAM and let's\ntake a look at the storage basics here.\n\n268\n00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.260\nI'm going to bring up explorer and\nas far as the storage goes,\n\n269\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.890\nI've got a couple of different\ndevices connected to this.\n\n270\n00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.170\nIt is right here, I've got about\na terabyte of storage space.\n\n271\n00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.980\nSo, as far as the machine goes,\nthis is a fairly beefy machine for\n\n272\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.950\nme to at least get started on.\n\n273\n00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.550\nSo I know something, I know that\nhardware-wise I am perfectly fine,\n\n274\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.690\nnow I need to go and\nget a copy of VirtualBox.\n\n275\n00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.670\nNow the easiest way to do this, and\nI've already downloaded it, but\n\n276\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:17.140\nI want to show you where you can get\nit from, is to bring up your browser.\n\n277\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.056\nAnd I'm actually using Microsoft Edge,\nooh, that makes a difference.\n\n278\n00:14:20.056 --> 00:14:24.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's VirtualBox.org\n\n279\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.630\nis what you want to remember, and\nhere is what I'm talking about.\n\n280\n00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.450\nI don't know, Mike, I think that\nthey're trying to hint that there's\n\n281\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.060\na place I can download VirtualBox from,\nbut I'm not sure.\n\n282\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.950\n>> I hate it when they hide\nthat download button amongst\n\n283\n00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.460\na myriad of other buttons there.\n\n284\n00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.334\nI mean, I've got to search through that\nentire page to figure out how to download\n\n285\n00:14:42.334 --> 00:14:43.240\nVirtualBox.\n\n286\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.950\n>> Yeah, I'm hoping that that's not true\nin this case, I can even see it without\n\n287\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.960\nusing my readers, which is pretty amazing\nto tell you the truth, of where you\n\n288\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.150\ngoing to, but this is where you want to\ndownload it from, so that makes it easier.\n\n289\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.770\nYou do want to check the site out, right,\nif you become, you know, like I am,\n\n290\n00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.280\nthat after a while you start using and\nyou want to learn more about technology,\n\n291\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.590\nthis is a great resource, so\nmake sure you keep this in mind.\n\n292\n00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:08.110\nThe only, I say the only annoying thing\nabout VirtualBox at times is once you\n\n293\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:12.440\ndownload it and you install it, it is\nchecking when it needs to be updated.\n\n294\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.000\nOkay, and that's not a bad thing.\n\n295\n00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.050\nUpdates are very important,\nthey're something that we need to do.\n\n296\n00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.979\nBut it annoyingly checks for updates.\n\n297\n00:15:18.979 --> 00:15:20.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know?\n\n298\n00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.160\nIt tells you, hey here's a new one.\n\n299\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.140\nAnd you're in the middle of working.\n\n300\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.980\nYou're like, wait a minute,\nI just turned on six VMs.\n\n301\n00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.510\nAnd now you're telling me\nthat I need to do an update?\n\n302\n00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.612\nWell you can't do that\nbecause it's going to reboot,\n\n303\n00:15:30.612 --> 00:15:32.270\nit's going to do all that stuff.\n\n304\n00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.450\nBut where you actually find them out,\nright, is this little RSS feed over here\n\n305\n00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.160\non the right-hand side it will\ntell you when it updates.\n\n306\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.900\nAnd when I say that they\nupdate constantly here.\n\n307\n00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.800\nSo notice that there is November\n10th that released one, and\n\n308\n00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.870\nthen in July 5th it also released one.\n\n309\n00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.140\nSo you're actually seeing that\nthey're constantly doing this.\n\n310\n00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.950\nAnd so\nyou will find different versions of them.\n\n311\n00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.870\nAnd this is the greatest place to go when\nyou do have problems with the installation\n\n312\n00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.680\nor something not functioning perfectly.\n\n313\n00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.267\nComing here is one of the best things.\n\n314\n00:15:59.267 --> 00:16:02.044\nClick on the big blue box,\nwe're not going to do that right now,\n\n315\n00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:03.595\nbut select that one, download it.\n\n316\n00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:06.255\nIt's gonna be in my downloads folder.\n\n317\n00:16:06.255 --> 00:16:08.309\nAnd there's just a couple\nof other things too.\n\n318\n00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:11.950\nI'm gonna click on the downloads link\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n319\n00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.490\nAnd there's one other thing that I\nnormally want you to do as well.\n\n320\n00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.500\nSo if you go ahead and you download that,\nthe other thing that you want is right\n\n321\n00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.560\nhere where it says\nVirtualBox Extension Pack.\n\n322\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.980\nThe Extension Pack is not the most\nessential thing in the world, but\n\n323\n00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.730\nit really does enhance\nthe capabilities of you VM.\n\n324\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.250\nFor example, it gives you the ability\nto actually run USB 3.0 if you need to.\n\n325\n00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.420\nIt actually virtualizes\nyour USB adapter so\n\n326\n00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.960\nthat now your virtual machine\ncan actually use USB 3.0.\n\n327\n00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.571\nMost traditionally the would virtualize\nlike USB 1., or whatever, well, 1.1.\n\n328\n00:16:48.571 --> 00:16:49.410\n>> [CROSSTALK].\n\n329\n00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.525\nSee I always forget that.\n\n330\n00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:56.230\n1.1, but USB 2.0 finally came along\nyears afterwards, but before that.\n\n331\n00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.925\nYeah, you can do USB, but\n\n332\n00:16:57.925 --> 00:17:02.105\ngood luck at making it work at any\n[LAUGH] speed that you wanted to.\n\n333\n00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:07.108\nUSB 3.0 came along, but now USB 2.0,\nUSB 3.0, it does stuff like that.\n\n334\n00:17:07.108 --> 00:17:10.370\nAlso if your laptop,\n\n335\n00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:15.080\nlike what I have, if yours has a built\nin camera, it will do a pass through.\n\n336\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.910\nSo in other words,\neven inside of my virtual machine,\n\n337\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.670\nI can use the physical camera that's\nactually attached right here and say,\n\n338\n00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.030\nhey look,\nI'm gonna actually use that instead.\n\n339\n00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.120\nSo having these extensions, and they keep\nadding more and more of those features in.\n\n340\n00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.800\nSo you always wanna make sure that\ndepending on the version that you're\n\n341\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.080\nchoose to download.\n\n342\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.278\nSo this one is actually that one for\nthe 5.0.10.\n\n343\n00:17:38.278 --> 00:17:43.930\nYou wanna make sure that you get that\nproper edition as well right up here too.\n\n344\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.720\nNow, this is the only time I've ever\nseen this where these extension packs,\n\n345\n00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.860\nit says supported on all platforms.\n\n346\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.440\nSo regardless of whether\nyou're running Mac, Linux, or\n\n347\n00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.780\nWindows this is a file that can\nactually go across all of them.\n\n348\n00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.020\nI don't know how that works but\nwhatever it is,\n\n349\n00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.780\nthe magic that they've actually\nworked out to make that happen,\n\n350\n00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.160\nthat's what you want to do and\nit tells you right here.\n\n351\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.550\nSupport for USB 2.0 and\n3.0 devices, VirtualBox.rdp,\n\n352\n00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.350\nit becomes an actual server for\nremote desktops.\n\n353\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.610\nSo almost like what we have.\n\n354\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.180\nIt also allows for\nus to do Intel Pixie Boot, you name it.\n\n355\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.960\nA lot of the stuff that we\nfind in type one hypervisors,\n\n356\n00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.040\nVirtualBox is saying,\nnow we've got it covered.\n\n357\n00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.070\nWe've got it covered,\nand so it really does.\n\n358\n00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:28.040\nAll of a sudden now you're why would\nI ever choose a type 1.0 provider?\n\n359\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.830\nLater on we'll get to that, and\nwe'll show why you wanna choose that.\n\n360\n00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.020\nBut overall though,\n\n361\n00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.220\nthose are really the two main files\nthat you want to make sure you get.\n\n362\n00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.930\nGet, of course, the installer, and\nthen of course get this one too.\n\n363\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.153\nAnd that way you'll have full function and\nfeatures,\n\n364\n00:18:42.153 --> 00:18:44.145\nespecially if you have\na new system on you hands.\n\n365\n00:18:44.145 --> 00:18:47.918\nTo be able to take advantage of all\nthose features really is handy.\n\n366\n00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.500\nAnd again totally free.\n\n367\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.140\nI've been amazed at over the years,\nI used to tell our buddy Don,\n\n368\n00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.730\nthey're gonna actually start charging for\nthat thing.\n\n369\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.220\nAnd they still haven't,\neven after all this time.\n\n370\n00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.230\nSo you're always amazed.\n\n371\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.885\nBut its the community of people as\nwell as Oracle employees that keep\n\n372\n00:19:05.885 --> 00:19:07.443\nadding to this thing.\n\n373\n00:19:07.443 --> 00:19:11.020\nAnd they just keep developing, and\nmaking it better and better each year.\n\n374\n00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.470\nSo getting those two is\nkind of the very beginning\n\n375\n00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.540\nof the installation\nprocess when we do that.\n\n376\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.700\nLet me go ahead and close that out.\n\n377\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.000\nI already told you I downloaded before,\nyou know how to download.\n\n378\n00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.950\nYou don't need to see me download it and\ndo all that stuff, but\n\n379\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.020\nit's actually inside of\nmy downloads folder.\n\n380\n00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.140\nSo let me go and\nfind my downloads folder here.\n\n381\n00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.230\nAnd then we'll just do a simple install.\n\n382\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.890\nSo here it is,\nI've also pulled in a couple of ISOs for\n\n383\n00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.840\nus to be able to do some installs here.\n\n384\n00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.533\nSo there's both those.\n\n385\n00:19:38.533 --> 00:19:41.310\nThere's that VM extension\npack that we talked about.\n\n386\n00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.160\nAnd here is\nthe Oracle VirtualBox installer.\n\n387\n00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.870\nAnd all I need to do is actually go ahead\nand lauch that from right there, and\n\n388\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:49.820\nI just double-clicked on it.\n\n389\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:55.040\nAnd it's gonna give me an installer as\nwell as a warning here in just a moment.\n\n390\n00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.550\nIt's taking a moment to come in,\nbut you could do this.\n\n391\n00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.890\nNow if you wanted to, believe it or\n\n392\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.190\nnot, they've already designed\nit in the background,\n\n393\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.850\neverything that you do right here can\nalso be done from the command prompt.\n\n394\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.260\nSo they have it where they've got a full\nlanguage scripted out and everything.\n\n395\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.460\nWhere if you go,\nI do not like the Windows 10 GUI,\n\n396\n00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.120\nI wanna launch it from a complete shell,\nyou can do it.\n\n397\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.580\nSo if you wanted to, for those of you\nthat actually like running things from\n\n398\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.700\nServer Core, it absolutely has\nscripting and ready to go and\n\n399\n00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.940\nas long as you can figure out their\ncoding, which is not really bad.\n\n400\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.620\nYou can direct everything and\n\n401\n00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.790\ncontrol everything from that\ncommand line if you wanted to.\n\n402\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:40.062\nBut they made it for, they really did,\nthey thought about every process and\n\n403\n00:20:40.062 --> 00:20:42.614\nhow people wanted to install it,\nvery neat.\n\n404\n00:20:42.614 --> 00:20:46.950\n>> And we can script it if we need to for\ninstalling this on multiple work stations?\n\n405\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.930\n>> Yes, and that is really the key.\n\n406\n00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.860\nThis particular VirtualBox product even\nthough we use it for testing in labs,\n\n407\n00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.080\nthere's a lot of companies that really\nare using this for their production.\n\n408\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.840\nSo I'm simply going to\nfollow this through, and\n\n409\n00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.830\nthis is just a wizard step-by-step, right.\n\n410\n00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.860\nSo it's not really complex, but notice how\neverything is automatically selected here.\n\n411\n00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.890\nSo, it does actually allow us be able to\npick-and-choose the features that we want\n\n412\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.220\nby using these little\ndrop-downs of course.\n\n413\n00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.870\nBut it's really about the entire\napplication and the support that we need.\n\n414\n00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.920\nSo of course there's USB support and\nnetworking support,\n\n415\n00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.662\nwhich is really important.\n\n416\n00:21:23.662 --> 00:21:28.180\nAnd VirtualBox Python support as well,\ncause it's based off of some Python too.\n\n417\n00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.930\nSo you want to make sure that you\nactually install everything that you can,\n\n418\n00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.490\nand it's going to install\nin its default location.\n\n419\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.650\nNow, more than likely, this is probably\nwhere we're gonna all install it if we're\n\n420\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.290\njust doing this on our own.\n\n421\n00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.510\nBut if somebody says,\nand Mike says, hey, no,\n\n422\n00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.830\nwe don't want you installing VirtualBox\nthere, you can always click Browse and,\n\n423\n00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.340\nof course,\ninstall it somewhere else on your system.\n\n424\n00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.340\nThen, click Next here and,\nof course, you can choose.\n\n425\n00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.020\nNow, notice that it really doesn't\nrequire us to do much else.\n\n426\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.080\nWe don't have to make any other\nreal decisions at this point.\n\n427\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.130\nIt's just saying, do I wanna\ncreate a shortcut on the desktop?\n\n428\n00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.770\nDo I wanna create a shortcut\nin the quick launch bar?\n\n429\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.850\nI wanna register the file associations.\n\n430\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.400\nI'm just gonna choose the shortcut\non the desktop for right now.\n\n431\n00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.800\nAnd I'm gonna leave this\nregister to file associations.\n\n432\n00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.200\nRemember that when VirtualBox creates\n\n433\n00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.399\nthe files that it's gonna use for\nthe VMs, right.\n\n434\n00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:25.030\nIt's gonna be like .vdi's, and some other\nfile extensions that it might create.\n\n435\n00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.180\nThis is just telling you Windows, yes,\n\n436\n00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.944\nyou should be able to recognize that,\nassociate it with VirtualBox here.\n\n437\n00:22:29.944 --> 00:22:33.920\nAll right, click next and\nnow it gives us this warning.\n\n438\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.850\nAnd we do need to pay\nattention right here.\n\n439\n00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.460\nThe nice thing is I'm actually\ncabled in where my video\n\n440\n00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.150\nadapter's actually not\nthrough the network adapter.\n\n441\n00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.870\nBut if I were trying to send this out,\n\n442\n00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.720\nin other words if I were streaming\nthis out so that you could see it.\n\n443\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.220\nIf I were to do this right\nnow it would disconnect and\n\n444\n00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.090\nyou'd be left with a black screen.\n\n445\n00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.880\nSo it depends on your machine, right?\n\n446\n00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.730\nOn my regular desktop, Mike,\nthis is no big deal if I click next and\n\n447\n00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.220\nit has to reboot, and\nmy network adapter drops.\n\n448\n00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.460\nBut Mike what about on\na production system?\n\n449\n00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.440\n>> Yeah, if you're in the middle of\na file transfer in the background or\n\n450\n00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.080\nif it's on a server that's\nproviding services to the network,\n\n451\n00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.230\nyou can't just disable the network\nadapter anytime you want.\n\n452\n00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.560\nSo that's basically what its gotta do,\n\n453\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.300\nits gotta temporarily\ndisable the network adapter.\n\n454\n00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.230\nSo that it can get access to it, and\nit's something you gotta think about.\n\n455\n00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.770\n>> Yeah,\nthis is one of those important things, and\n\n456\n00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.610\nthat's why they also put it in red.\n\n457\n00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.970\nMost people don't think about it,\nand if they're in a production mode,\n\n458\n00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.420\nit's like oh, yeah, I'm just gonna\nvirtualize this server right now.\n\n459\n00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.610\nClick, click, click, click, and\n\n460\n00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:35.050\nnow they've dropped off their particular\nserver off the network right then.\n\n461\n00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.830\nLet's say a backup transfer\nwas happening right then.\n\n462\n00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.820\nThat delays everything\nbefore it comes online.\n\n463\n00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.720\nSo it's gotta actually do something\nto reset the network adapter so\n\n464\n00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.030\nit can recognize the network\nadapter as well.\n\n465\n00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.980\nAnd that's important because, remember,\nthe network adapter is more than likely\n\n466\n00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:57.300\nhow we are going to connect whatever\nVMs we make to the rest of the world.\n\n467\n00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.630\nSo that's why it's very important\nthat it does what it needs to do.\n\n468\n00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.595\nSo normally, if you're doing something\nlike this, you wanna make sure that all\n\n469\n00:24:04.595 --> 00:24:08.564\nthose other processes in the background\nare finished if they're very important\n\n470\n00:24:08.564 --> 00:24:12.381\nto you They're not important to you,\nit's not going to be that big of a deal.\n\n471\n00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:15.817\nClick next, and then it says\neverything is ready to install, and\n\n472\n00:24:15.817 --> 00:24:18.360\nwe simply select install at this point.\n\n473\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.770\nAnd I need to follow the UAC prompt and\nlet it install and\n\n474\n00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.720\ndo what we need as well.\n\n475\n00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.510\nNow there are some other ways\nthat you can install Virtual Box.\n\n476\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.700\nWe're not gonna get too much into it, but\nthere are some advanced ways that you can\n\n477\n00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.830\ninstall Virtual Box to where\nyou don't see it at all.\n\n478\n00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.890\nIt's what they call\na headless installation, so\n\n479\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.900\nthat there's no graphical interface,\nthere's nothing like that.\n\n480\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.670\nBut all you're gonna be doing is you're\nactually gonna be connecting into it\n\n481\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.030\nusing command line to build your VM's and\ndo all that stuff.\n\n482\n00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.940\nAnd then people are just\ngonna see the VM's.\n\n483\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.550\nIt's about trying to reduce the overhead\nthat you actually see here so\n\n484\n00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.440\nit can actually run a little bit smoother.\n\n485\n00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.170\nSo there's different ways\nthat you can do this and\n\n486\n00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.040\nthat's one of the nice\nthings about Virtual Box.\n\n487\n00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.170\nThey really did, they've try to\nmake it actually be appealing,\n\n488\n00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.800\nnot only to people like me,\nthe very simple user.\n\n489\n00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.520\nBut even to the person that says man,\nwe really want to take advantage of\n\n490\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.240\nthe hardware, and we don't need anybody\never coming in and modifying and\n\n491\n00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.590\ndoing those virtual machines, except for\nthe guy that's building them.\n\n492\n00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.610\nAnd that way they make the headless\nserver to be able to do that.\n\n493\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.440\nSo, there are a lots of neat features.\n\n494\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.230\nNow, this one looks like it's stuck for\na moment, but it's not.\n\n495\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.800\nIt just takes a little bit of time.\n\n496\n00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.030\nBefore it finishes its installation.\n\n497\n00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:30.590\nOnce it's done, it may ask me to\nreboot the machine, it may not.\n\n498\n00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.630\nI can't remember exactly\nwhat it's going to do.\n\n499\n00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.930\nBut once it's done you'll see that there\nis this, got my little icon now going up.\n\n500\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.040\nAnd it has, it's kind of locked up\nmy machine here just for a moment.\n\n501\n00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.430\nBut we'll see what ends up happening.\n\n502\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.820\nSo usually at the end it just tells\nme that it's installed successfully.\n\n503\n00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.210\nAnd at that point,\nI am gonna be ready to create a VM.\n\n504\n00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.060\nThere it goes,\nit's now actually unfrozen again, and\n\n505\n00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.830\nso we can actually pick up right here and\ntake a look.\n\n506\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.510\nSo as you see, it's actually finished its\ninstallation here, oracle has actually\n\n507\n00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.520\nbeen set, ready to go, and it's giving\nme whether or not I'm actually gonna do\n\n508\n00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.490\na start Oracle after the installation and\nwe'll go ahead and select that.\n\n509\n00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.836\nAnd that way it will go ahead and start,\nso I didn't have to really re-boot.\n\n510\n00:26:10.836 --> 00:26:13.316\nIt did lock up my network adapter for\na moment and\n\n511\n00:26:13.316 --> 00:26:17.240\nonce everything kind of cleared\nout we were back and ready to go.\n\n512\n00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:22.290\nSo here's the basic interface that you and\nI will be using.\n\n513\n00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:25.390\nSo notice that it really is even\nthough it actually that hyper-visor\n\n514\n00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.730\nthat we've been talking about,\nit runs as an application.\n\n515\n00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.960\nAnd I've got this shortcut right here.\n\n516\n00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.510\nAnd then I can actually launch it and\nwe're ready to go.\n\n517\n00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.719\nIt gives me a nice little welcome and you\nsee where it's actually got the little.\n\n518\n00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.830\nMSN butterfly over here, and\n>> [LAUGH] The Linux Penguin there.\n\n519\n00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.520\n>> Linux Penguin and\n[INAUDIBLE] this is the VirtualBox icon.\n\n520\n00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.540\nWhere there can show were we can literally\nrun them all together if we choose to.\n\n521\n00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.220\nSo the next thing that we would\nnormally do, of course, is go ahead and\n\n522\n00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.050\njust create a VM.\n\n523\n00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.670\nSo the nice thing once again\nin the interface, right?\n\n524\n00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:03.850\nEven though this is called the manager, is\nthis blue button over here that says new.\n\n525\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:08.050\nAnd then I'm simply gonna select that and\nit will give me a wizard to walk through.\n\n526\n00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:10.410\nAnd I simply start paying\nattention to the wizard.\n\n527\n00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:14.900\nNow I do have a Windows Server\n2012 VM that we're gonna create.\n\n528\n00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.290\nBut notice it gives me the actual type and\nlist and\n\n529\n00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:22.040\nalso the versions that I can\nchoose from in what I can install.\n\n530\n00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.880\nSo if I chose a Linux distro,\nnotice it goes to Ubuntu, and\n\n531\n00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.970\nit gives me a list of some\nof the different ones.\n\n532\n00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.830\nNow what is this doing?\n\n533\n00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.930\nThis is actually going ahead and\ngiving us a preconfigure,\n\n534\n00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.800\na configuration of what it believes that,\nthat machine would need to run.\n\n535\n00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.410\nSo, remember, we talked about the basic\nrequirements to get the machine to run?\n\n536\n00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.060\nIt's sort of saying,\nwell, let me go ahead and\n\n537\n00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.560\nI've got some that I already know and\nwe're just gonna list them right\n\n538\n00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.710\nhere instead of you trying to figure\nout which one, and let's do that.\n\n539\n00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.100\nSo I'm gonna give it a name.\n\n540\n00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.180\nAnd this is probably one of\nthe more important things,\n\n541\n00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.880\nis to make sure that you\ngive this thing a name here.\n\n542\n00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:04.950\nSo I am going to call this one\nserver_2012r2 and just as an example,\n\n543\n00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:10.050\nand my typing skills,\nstopping me, select Windows 2012.\n\n544\n00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.936\nNow I can scroll down and select,\noh there it is Windows 2012.\n\n545\n00:28:13.936 --> 00:28:16.127\nSo in the background,\nit's actually saying,\n\n546\n00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:19.270\nhere's what we're gonna\nconfigure things like RAM for.\n\n547\n00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.280\nAnd that way I don't have to worry\nabout how much I wanna give it\n\n548\n00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.000\nif I wanna leave it at the defaults.\n\n549\n00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.040\nAt this point, if I do this,\nI can actually zip through here and just\n\n550\n00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.080\nkeep going and not have to worry about\nit because it's already preconfigured.\n\n551\n00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.600\nBut we'll take a look at some\nof this other stuff right here.\n\n552\n00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.340\nSo normally you'd have\nto choose a memory size.\n\n553\n00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.550\nI'm gonna leave it at the default for\nright now.\n\n554\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.890\nAnd then a hard disk.\n\n555\n00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.840\nThis is probably one of the harder\nthings to actually think about here.\n\n556\n00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.760\nCuz it's gonna store at someplace,\n\n557\n00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.990\nsome location that you don't\nknow about at this point.\n\n558\n00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.140\nSo it's saying, hey, look how big your\nhard drive is gonna be at the beginning.\n\n559\n00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.990\nI don't have to add one right now.\n\n560\n00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.840\nI can create one.\n\n561\n00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.100\nOr if I have already one that I've\nalready created, I can use that one.\n\n562\n00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.140\nI'm just gonna tell it to create,\nwe can go back and\n\n563\n00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.940\nmodify the size even though\nit says 25 gigs later on.\n\n564\n00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.630\nI select create, and\nnow I choose the file type.\n\n565\n00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.630\nNow this may be important.\n\n566\n00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:12.050\nThis is actually saying hey, what do\nyou want the extension to end with, and\n\n567\n00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.340\nthese are some of the different\nvirtualization technologies that you can\n\n568\n00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.040\nend it with as well.\n\n569\n00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.770\nSo if you think that there's a possibility\nin the future that you can import it into\n\n570\n00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:25.300\nanother one, you might choose\nanother technology here to do that.\n\n571\n00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.880\nBut virtual box recognizes all these,\n\n572\n00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.390\nwhich again is a feature that you might\nsee on some of the type one Hyper-visors.\n\n573\n00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.600\nRarely do you see it on\nthe type two Hyper-visor,\n\n574\n00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.030\nvirtual box is trying to be very\nwell rounded in what it does.\n\n575\n00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.460\n>> That's very impressive.\n\n576\n00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.370\nThat really is.\n\n577\n00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:44.970\nSo yeah, should get Virtual Box, the VMDK\nis actually for VM ware, VHD's is for\n\n578\n00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:49.990\nthe Hyper-V, and then parallels,\nand then of course QEMU's.\n\n579\n00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.310\nYou name it, there's a lot of them, and\n\n580\n00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.170\nI'm gonna leave it at the native VDI for\nright now.\n\n581\n00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.480\nClick next, and\n\n582\n00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.810\nthen how do I want that hard drive to\nactually be in terms of the installation?\n\n583\n00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.140\nDynamically allocated, so\n\n584\n00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.430\neven though I've got a 25 gig hard drive\nthat we're creating at the beginning,\n\n585\n00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:09.120\nit will actually allow me to\nexpand it up to that 25 gigs, or\n\n586\n00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:14.260\nif I've only used five gigs of it, it\nwill actually only save five gigs of it.\n\n587\n00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.870\nIf I do fixed size, and I say it's 25\ngigs, it's gonna create that hard drive\n\n588\n00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:23.320\nand make it 25 gigs on my hard drive\nright now, so you do have to think about\n\n589\n00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.160\nstuff like that, in a testing environment,\ndynamically allocated is the way to go.\n\n590\n00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.720\nIn a production environment,\nfixed is the way to go.\n\n591\n00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.950\nSo that's going to be the delineation\nthat i'm going to give you, and\n\n592\n00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.440\nlater on when somebody says,\nshould I choose that or not?\n\n593\n00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.310\nJust remember that.\n\n594\n00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.550\nThat that's what you wanna do.\n\n595\n00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:45.480\nLike you don't ever wanna use dynamically\nallocated in a production environment.\n\n596\n00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.350\nIt's gonna slow down stuff because it has\nto recalculate the size of that hard drive\n\n597\n00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.870\nevery time it accesses it\nto do what it needs to.\n\n598\n00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:55.890\nWhereas fixed, you say okay, it's 25 gig\nhard drive, then the machine doesn't have\n\n599\n00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.620\nto actually go, is it gonna be\nstored here, or somewhere else?\n\n600\n00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.380\nAnd it continues to shrink or grow.\n\n601\n00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.990\nSo we're gonna do dynamically allocated,\nclick next, and\n\n602\n00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.880\nnow I can choose where\nit's gonna be located.\n\n603\n00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.790\nThere's a little icon over\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n604\n00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:12.660\nSays, choose a location.\n\n605\n00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:13.990\nAnd then I can choose a location.\n\n606\n00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.310\nAnd you see that it has this folder.\n\n607\n00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.820\nIf I click here,\nyou can actually see the entire path.\n\n608\n00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.780\nUnder my user profile,\nvirtual box VMs, and server.\n\n609\n00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:27.410\nIf I wanted it someplace different,\nI could select another location.\n\n610\n00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.210\nAnd now I can even create a new folder for\nit, and I will.\n\n611\n00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:35.930\nI'll call it VMs here, and then I can\nput it inside of that folder, and tell\n\n612\n00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:41.030\nit to save it there, and now notice that\nthe link, or the file path, will change.\n\n613\n00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:45.850\nAnd this is where I can choose\nhow big I want that drive to be.\n\n614\n00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.230\nOr if I wanted to,\nI could actually just type it in.\n\n615\n00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:52.300\nAnd just say 25 gigs here,\nor 25 I should say.\n\n616\n00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.610\nLet's see if that allows me to do that.\n\n617\n00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.440\nOops.\nMaybe not.\n\n618\n00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.780\nThere we go.\n\n619\n00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.430\nYeah I can do it, but\njust, I didn't need to.\n\n620\n00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.974\nChange it that way.\n\n621\n00:32:00.974 --> 00:32:02.971\nI need it to do 25.\n\n622\n00:32:02.971 --> 00:32:03.971\nOops!\n\n623\n00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:05.257\n25.\n\n624\n00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:09.017\nAnd then change this to gigabytes instead.\n\n625\n00:32:09.017 --> 00:32:11.100\nNot 25 megabytes.\n\n626\n00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.804\n>> That'd be a little small.\n\n627\n00:32:11.804 --> 00:32:12.633\n>> Yeah a little bit small.\n\n628\n00:32:12.633 --> 00:32:14.250\nSo 25 gigabytes.\n\n629\n00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.810\nClick Create.\n\n630\n00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.820\nAnd there it is, I've just created a VM.\n\n631\n00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:23.280\nNow the VM is not actually installing the\nentire operating system, it is it's just\n\n632\n00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.430\ncreating that file that's now\nrepresenting that entire virtual machine.\n\n633\n00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:32.060\nSo at this point,\nthe only thing that's really left, is for\n\n634\n00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.230\nme to install an operating\nsystem on that VM.\n\n635\n00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.690\nAnd it's actually fairly\neasy to begin the process.\n\n636\n00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:44.120\nSo I'm gonna click Settings here, and\nI'm gonna right-click on that VM.\n\n637\n00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.960\nAnd click settings, and\nthen I can go down to storage.\n\n638\n00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.990\nAnd I have to actually\nmount an actual image, so\n\n639\n00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:57.500\nI'm going to choose an optical file there.\n\n640\n00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.960\nSelect the,\nactually its in my downloads folder,\n\n641\n00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.880\nand want to do this Windows sever 2012,\nand add that in there.\n\n642\n00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:10.970\nSo now I've added in essentially\na DVD of the 2012 operating system,\n\n643\n00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.820\nand now I simply go ahead and start it.\n\n644\n00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:18.100\nAnd from this point here, we should\nsee the installation process begin.\n\n645\n00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.060\nAnd it's gonna give a whole bunch of\ndifferent warnings that you have to\n\n646\n00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.100\npay attention to.\n\n647\n00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:26.080\nBut we'll at least get this process\nstarted as we take a look here.\n\n648\n00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.470\nAnd you'll see there it is.\n\n649\n00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:31.890\nNow I'm on Windows 10, and we're about\nto see an installation, at least part,\n\n650\n00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.080\nlet me full screen it.\n\n651\n00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.960\nAnd you're now seeing that\nwe are installing Windows\n\n652\n00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.400\n2012 inside of Windows 2010.\n\n653\n00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.540\nIf you haven't seen it before,\nit is kind of an amazing process as now we\n\n654\n00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.960\ngo through, and we simply click\nthe defaults on installing it, so\n\n655\n00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.180\nwe can get the process\nbeginning in its installation.\n\n656\n00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:54.280\nFrom that point once it reboots, I should\nnow have a running virtual machine,\n\n657\n00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.540\nand I simply pick\nthe addition that I want.\n\n658\n00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.450\nI want to make sure I do it\nwith the GUI interface, and\n\n659\n00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.270\nso you go and\nyou pick those options there.\n\n660\n00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:08.660\nAnd you are ready and on your way, and\nthere it is, there are your first steps\n\n661\n00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:14.130\nat beginning your process of\ncreating a VM inside of virtual box.\n\n662\n00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.340\nNow, there's a lot more to go.\n\n663\n00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.180\nJust creating a VM isn't enough.\n\n664\n00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.660\nThere's still some configuration for\nus to do.\n\n665\n00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.430\nThat's really the basic process\nin the very beginnings here,\n\n666\n00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:24.590\nwhen you start talking\nabout creating a VM.\n\n667\n00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.800\n>> Yeah, that's very good stuff Ronnie,\nand really easy.\n\n668\n00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.920\nI mean, in the end, we downloaded\nan application, we fired it up.\n\n669\n00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.580\nI likened it to building a machine.\n\n670\n00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.380\nYou have to decide how much RAM\nyou want to put in that machine.\n\n671\n00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.710\nHow much hard drive space you\nwant to put in that machine,\n\n672\n00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.410\nwhat kind of processor\nyou want to put in there,\n\n673\n00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:45.290\nand then when you click finish you\nnow have this bare metal machine.\n\n674\n00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:48.380\nThere's no operating system installed yet\nor anything like that.\n\n675\n00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.930\nWe still have to do that, but\njust like the build process, right.\n\n676\n00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:52.610\nThen we'd have to go get our disk.\n\n677\n00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.080\nAnd install our operating system,\nwhatever we have a license for.\n\n678\n00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.760\nSo fantastic stuff there Ronnie.\n\n679\n00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.100\nLove that look at Virtual Box.\n\n680\n00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.380\nIt's one of those type two hypervisors,\n\n681\n00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.270\na great place to get your feet wet if\nyou wanna play with virtualization.\n\n682\n00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:07.070\nIt's a free one from Oracle.\n\n683\n00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.410\nTry that out,\nfollow Ronnie's steps there, and\n\n684\n00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.370\nyou'll be running a virtual\nmachine before you know it.\n\n685\n00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.370\nAll right, any parting words for\nour viewers?\n\n686\n00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.250\n>> Just remember that\nthe installation process,\n\n687\n00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.300\nrelatively simple,\nthere's still a lot more to go.\n\n688\n00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.650\nSo in future episodes that we'll have,\nwe'll talk about going in there and\n\n689\n00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.690\nwhat do we need to do to get it running,\nand then also of course to get it\n\n690\n00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:30.280\nconnected to the network and\nconfigure it the way that we want to.\n\n691\n00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.724\nSo you do want to make sure that\nyou stay tuned for those episodes.\n\n692\n00:35:33.724 --> 00:35:36.790\nCuz that's really where some of\nthe I won't say hard stuff, but\n\n693\n00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.770\nsome of the detail stuff that\nwe need to make sure of.\n\n694\n00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.476\nIf were gonna be working on\na virtualized environment.\n\n695\n00:35:41.476 --> 00:35:44.340\n>> Very good, all right, well ladies and\ngentlemen that's gonna do it for this one,\n\n696\n00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.850\nwe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n697\n00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:47.060\nSigning off for IT pro tv.\n\n698\n00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.250\nI'm Mike Roderick,\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n699\n00:35:49.250 -->

--> 00:00:20.210\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're looking at virtualization, and\n\n4\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.420\nspecifically, we're going to continue\non with a program called VirtualBox.\n\n5\n00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.490\nNow, in a previous episode Ronnie,\nwe have setup VirtualBox and\n\n6\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.300\nwe got our first virtual machine created,\nbut now we wanna take a look at,\n\n7\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.700\nyou know,\nwhat we can do with that machine.\n\n8\n00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.610\nSome of the options and\nsettings that we can do to configure\n\n9\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.480\nthe virtual machine to get it ready for\nuse in whatever we're doing,\n\n10\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.320\nour development environment or maybe\neven in a small production environment.\n\n11\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.690\nSo Ronnie, got Ronnie Wong\nhere to help us out with that.\n\n12\n00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.930\nHe's gonna guide us through.\n\n13\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.670\nRonnie, where do we go next?\n\n14\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.580\n>> Right, when we start taking a look\nat using virtualization technology,\n\n15\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.970\ncreating that very first VMS\nwe did in the previous episode\n\n16\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.790\nis what we have to begin with, right?\n\n17\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.470\nAnd even though it's a fairly\nsimple configuration\n\n18\n00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.790\nin everything that we're doing well, we\nactually have to start at least somewhere.\n\n19\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.400\nAnd what we did in that previous episode\nis we created the virtual machine.\n\n20\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.040\nAnd then we began\nthe installation process for\n\n21\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.570\ninstalling of course an operating\nsystem inside of that virtual machine.\n\n22\n00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.950\nSo, we really started\ntwo separate processes.\n\n23\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.650\nActually began and finished one, which\nis creating that virtual machine, and\n\n24\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.380\nthen we started the install process.\n\n25\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.600\nAnd the rest of that process is pretty\nmuch the same standard that you\n\n26\n00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.060\nactually do everywhere,\neven though we didn't finish everything.\n\n27\n00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.350\nBut remember that, once we actually\ninstall and operate system into a physical\n\n28\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.330\nmachine, a lot of times, Mike,\nit's not ready to go right away as well.\n\n29\n00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.900\nAnd there's some other things\nthat we have to tweak.\n\n30\n00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.850\nAnd that's what we're really trying\nto focus in on for this episode.\n\n31\n00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.600\n>> Yeah, so a lot of it is gonna\nbe very similar to what we see\n\n32\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.350\nIf we're installing it\nin a physical machine.\n\n33\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.590\nWe saw you putting in the ISO,\njust like you would on a physical machine.\n\n34\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.700\nYou pop that disk in there and\nyou follow those on-screen prompts, and\n\n35\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.320\nyou install your operating system.\n\n36\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.640\nJust cuz it's virtualized,\nthere's no difference there.\n\n37\n00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.741\nOnce the operating system gets installed,\nyou're still gonna have your basic\n\n38\n00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:07.241\nconfiguration to do, just like you\nwould with a physical machine.\n\n39\n00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:10.573\nGot to get it on the network,\nyou gotta set your time zone,\n\n40\n00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:14.938\nall of that fun stuff, but visualization\nadds a little bit to that, right?\n\n41\n00:02:14.938 --> 00:02:18.432\nWe can't just, there's more to it\nthan just setting an IP address and\n\n42\n00:02:18.432 --> 00:02:22.285\nname there's settings within\nthe virtualization application we're using\n\n43\n00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:24.585\nthat we wanna configure as well, so.\n\n44\n00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:25.835\n>> Yeah, and that's a great point Mike.\n\n45\n00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:28.885\nThe very fact is that when you do\nthis with a regular physical machine,\n\n46\n00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:32.065\neven after installing the operating\nsystem, there's still stuff for\n\n47\n00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:36.845\nyou to do before you get it ready for\nsomebody to be able to use, right?\n\n48\n00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:40.655\nSo there's a lot of times we have to go in\nand configure the operating system itself\n\n49\n00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:43.810\nand with a virtual machine, you still\nhave to do all that stuff, right?\n\n50\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.930\nAnd the good thing is we do have other\nepisodes in our library that will\n\n51\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.760\nreally help you to configure\nthat operating system itself.\n\n52\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.460\nBut we wanna take a look at is that\nonce you've got that virtual machine now\n\n53\n00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.880\ncreated and you have an operating\nsystem on it, that there are still\n\n54\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.640\nsome configurations that we have to\nmake ask people using the virtualization\n\n55\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.080\ntechnology so that we can get it\nfunctioning the way that we need to.\n\n56\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.930\nSo if we were to turn it on right now.\n\n57\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.270\nDon't get me wrong we're\nactually going to do that.\n\n58\n00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.280\nWhen we turn it on it will work and we can\nbegin some of the process that we actually\n\n59\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.330\nneed to but it's not going to function\nas smoothly or the way that we want to.\n\n60\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.850\nSo I wanted to show you some of\nthe different tools that are actually\n\n61\n00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.310\navailable inside of VirtualBox\nto help make this configuration\n\n62\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.370\na little bit easier.\n\n63\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.270\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look on my machine, and\n\n64\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.610\nthen we'll get started right here as well.\n\n65\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.160\nSo here it is.\n\n66\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.760\nIt is the Oracle VM Virtual Box Manager.\n\n67\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.610\nAnd here is the VM that we did create,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.190\nAt the very beginning when we did this,\nwe simply created.\n\n69\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.360\nThere was no operating system installed.\n\n70\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.890\nBy the end of one of those episodes,\nwe also went ahead and\n\n71\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.670\nbegan the installation process.\n\n72\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.500\nAnd now it's powered off.\n\n73\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.820\nSo before we start up,\nbefore we turn on the power.\n\n74\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.980\nJust like a regular physical machine.\n\n75\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.880\nI wanna show you just a few\nconfiguration settings\n\n76\n00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.360\nthat you do want to make sure\nthat you get installed on there.\n\n77\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.910\nNow we could have done this at any time,\nI just wanted to do it right now.\n\n78\n00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.910\nBut one of those things that we had\ntalked about at the very beginning,\n\n79\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.780\nright, is that when we\ndownload the installer for\n\n80\n00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.660\nOracle VirtualBox, was we also downloaded\na file that we had extension packs.\n\n81\n00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.210\nWhich can figure the actual kind of\nvirtualized hardware to do what we want to\n\n82\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.840\ndo an add a little bit\nmore compatibility and\n\n83\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.700\nadd a little bit more\nextra enhancements to it.\n\n84\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.163\nWell, I had that downloaded but\n\n85\n00:04:33.163 --> 00:04:35.990\nI didn't do anything with it\nwhen we did the initial install.\n\n86\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.634\nSo if I now I'm gonna be creating\nadditional virtual machines,\n\n87\n00:04:39.634 --> 00:04:43.210\nwhat I want to do is I wanna get\nthe extension pack installed, so\n\n88\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.664\nthat when I do create additional virtual\nmachines and also flow to this one that\n\n89\n00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:52.388\nI've already created here, it will have\nthose extra enhancements like being able\n\n90\n00:04:52.388 --> 00:04:57.750\nto access USB 3.0, being able to do\nthe PXE boot stuff, a few more features.\n\n91\n00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.120\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here\ninside our Oracle VirtualBox, and the way\n\n92\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.870\nthat we do that is we click on file and\nthen we go to what we call preferences\n\n93\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.020\nright here, right at the beginning\nas we select this preference box.\n\n94\n00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.570\nAnd it is, in this virtual machine\nour virtual box preferences\n\n95\n00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.460\nthat these are what we call global type\nsettings, and that means it should apply.\n\n96\n00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.740\nIf I actually apply these settings here,\n\n97\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.330\nit should apply to every VM that I\ncreate inside of Virtual Box as well.\n\n98\n00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.630\nSo we can actually do this, so\nlet's take for example, general,\n\n99\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.790\nright, ,here's the default\nvirtual machine folder.\n\n100\n00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.660\nSo if I did not configure it any\ndifferently at this point it would go into\n\n101\n00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.790\nmy user profile and there would be\na folder there that's called virtual box\n\n102\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.860\nVS and we also have the ability of\ncourse to change that locations\n\n103\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.560\nif we wanted to change\nthat location as well.\n\n104\n00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.040\nI just left it.\n\n105\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.570\nOn the input you also end up seeing,\nespecially in working inside\n\n106\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.300\nof virtual box, is that not every key\ncombination is gonna work the same way and\n\n107\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.060\nyou might be wondering why\nis it not going to work?\n\n108\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.320\nWell, remember I'm on\na Windows 10 machine.\n\n109\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.510\nMike, if I do control alt delete\nright now on my machine and\n\n110\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.960\nI might think, hey, that's good, but\n\n111\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.770\nwhat it normally kicks me out to is that,\nkind of, security screen, right?\n\n112\n00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.240\n>> Yeah, it, it's gonna apply to\nyour host, the physical machine,\n\n113\n00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.210\nyou're gonna end up logging off of there.\n\n114\n00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.390\nGetting to that security screen which\nis not what you're trying to do.\n\n115\n00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.260\n>> Yeah, and\nif you think about that right.\n\n116\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.910\nIf I now have two machines\nrunning on the same machine.\n\n117\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.820\nA virtual box VM that's running a windows\nmachine, and I'm now also running it\n\n118\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.950\non Windows 10 if I hit control alt delete\nwell which one is it gonna apply to?\n\n119\n00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.670\nVirtual box says we've got to be\nable to distinguish that because\n\n120\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.690\nthere are some things that you, Ronnie,\nwant to go to do on your host machine but\n\n121\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.730\nyou don't really want to do them\ninside of the virtual machine.\n\n122\n00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.270\nAt the same time, there may be things that\nyou want to do in the virtual machine\n\n123\n00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.300\nthat you don't really want happening\nin your host machine at the same time.\n\n124\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.630\nWhat they do right here on the keyboard or\n\n125\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.850\non the input, as they create special\nshortcuts for us to take a look at them.\n\n126\n00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.012\nYou can see right here in the Virtual Box\nmanager, if I wanted to do the advanced\n\n127\n00:07:05.012 --> 00:07:08.546\nconfiguration power interface shutdown for\na virtual machine, I\n\n128\n00:07:08.546 --> 00:07:12.665\ncan do a control H and that would actually\ndo it inside of the Virtual Machine.\n\n129\n00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:16.287\nAnd not for, won't my machine,\nwhich is something that's good.\n\n130\n00:07:16.287 --> 00:07:18.887\nThat's equivalent to us holding\ndown the power button for\n\n131\n00:07:18.887 --> 00:07:20.790\nfive seconds is what we're seeing.\n\n132\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.400\nAnd you'll actually see there's a couple\nof different ones that are listed here,\n\n133\n00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.670\nwe're not going to go through all of them\nbut you will see that they've gone ahead\n\n134\n00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.670\nand configured that and if you want\nto change them you simply click on\n\n135\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.190\none of them and then it gives you that\nability to erase the current settings and\n\n136\n00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.870\nthen what you can do is you can\ngo ahead and let's say select.\n\n137\n00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.290\nI'm going to try and just delete that,\nlet me erase the settings, there we go.\n\n138\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.580\nLet me just erase those settings and\n\n139\n00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.700\nthen I can actually hit\nwhatever combination I want to.\n\n140\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.970\nThere, I just hit the space bar.\n\n141\n00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.143\nAnd I know this is a little\nbit difficult to see but\n\n142\n00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:51.635\nyou can see right there where\nit says space, to do that.\n\n143\n00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:55.661\nIf I wanna reset it back to its default,\nI simply click on that u-turn and\n\n144\n00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:56.925\nthen we are also back.\n\n145\n00:07:56.925 --> 00:07:59.872\nAnd if I wanna adjust it\nin every virtual machine.\n\n146\n00:07:59.872 --> 00:08:02.327\nNotice I can click on that\nVirtual Machine tab, and\n\n147\n00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:05.820\nI can see that there's a bunch\nof these different combinations.\n\n148\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.080\nOne of the most important ones,\nof course, is this Insert Ctrl+Alt+Del.\n\n149\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.170\nWell, if I go ahead and launch up\nthis virtual machine in a moment,\n\n150\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.160\nyou'll see that one of the first things,\ncuz it's Server 2012,\n\n151\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.490\nis the screen says press what,\nCtrl+Alt+Del to enter that.\n\n152\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.270\nWell if I do that on my machine it's\ngonna do it for the Windows 10 machine,\n\n153\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.990\nwhat I'm running it on, it's not\ngonna do it for that virtual machine.\n\n154\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.200\nSo it gives me the actual\nproper shortcut that I need.\n\n155\n00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.200\nI need to hold down that Host key and\nthen press the Ctrl key as well.\n\n156\n00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.950\nAnd then once I do that,\nthen I'm ready to go, or\n\n157\n00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.770\nDelete, sorry, is what this one says.\n\n158\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.950\nNow there's also, of course,\nhere it is, here's that weird update\n\n159\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.490\nthing that I was telling you,\nthat VirtualBox is constantly updating.\n\n160\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.250\nI mean, it updates faster and\nmore often than, actually,\n\n161\n00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.610\nmost of the virtual machine\nproducts that are out there, or\n\n162\n00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.060\nvirtualization products that\nare out there, and you can see why.\n\n163\n00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.030\nIt's actually constantly checking for\nupdates.\n\n164\n00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.540\nThis one checks it once per day, you can\nchange this up if you want to as well.\n\n165\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.290\nAnd notice it gives you the ability\nto do stable releases versus\n\n166\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.870\nall releases as well,\nand even pre-releases.\n\n167\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.010\nNow, this is up to you,\ninside of a production environment,\n\n168\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.740\nwe will only pick stable releases,\nand I mean that.\n\n169\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.210\nDo not ever say, yeah, no let's go ahead\nand run these every single release and\n\n170\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.505\nwhatever the newest and latest one is.\n\n171\n00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:21.945\nThat's usually never a best bet for\n\n172\n00:09:21.945 --> 00:09:25.175\nanybody in the IT world saying,\nlet's go ahead and do that right away.\n\n173\n00:09:25.175 --> 00:09:28.422\nNow, I say that, yet\nat ITProTV that's what I'm always doing.\n\n174\n00:09:28.422 --> 00:09:29.139\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n175\n00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:31.585\nthat's because we're trying to make\nsure that we learn the newest and\n\n176\n00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:32.257\nlatest features.\n\n177\n00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:33.184\nBut overall though,\n\n178\n00:09:33.184 --> 00:09:36.585\nin a regular production environment where\nyou're doing this day after day and\n\n179\n00:09:36.585 --> 00:09:39.650\nyour business is depending on it,\ndon't go ahead and switch.\n\n180\n00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.300\nWait at least until those stable releases,\nand even then check with somebody.\n\n181\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.160\nIf everything's working fine you may go\nI'm not going to mess around with this.\n\n182\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.410\nWait a little bit of time,\nsee what release notes come out,\n\n183\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.492\nif it actually affects you.\n\n184\n00:09:50.492 --> 00:09:53.092\nThen of course you could\nupgrade from that point.\n\n185\n00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.810\nBut just kinda realize that\nyou do have those options.\n\n186\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.268\nAnd of course, language settings, default\nit to the language that's best for you.\n\n187\n00:10:00.268 --> 00:10:04.342\nI, of course, am here in the States,\nand even though I'm Chinese,\n\n188\n00:10:04.342 --> 00:10:09.180\nEnglish is really my primary language,\nso I'm gonna actually choose English.\n\n189\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.490\nAnd here's one that's a little bit,\nwhich is a good thing for\n\n190\n00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.370\nus, the idea of displays.\n\n191\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.670\nDisplays are very important\nin this day and age, right?\n\n192\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.610\nAt one time we were all just kinda\nsubject to the very matter in fact that\n\n193\n00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.710\nwhatever display we get is\nwhatever display we get.\n\n194\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.480\nAnd it wouldn't matter if you were\nhappy about it, you were okay with it.\n\n195\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.640\nIt was just, here's what you have, so\nyou either deal with it, or you don't.\n\n196\n00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.050\nWell, the good thing is VirtualBox,\nit can actually take a look.\n\n197\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.430\nMaximum guest screen display, notice\nyou can do automatic, and you can even\n\n198\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.840\nadjust the height and width if you change\nthis, instead, to do other things.\n\n199\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.320\nSo it can actually adjust it for\nyou if you want to.\n\n200\n00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.460\nAnd then you can go in, and\n\n201\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:56.490\nbecause VirtualBox actually has that\nhardware-assisted virtualization and\n\n202\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.570\nthose extension packs, it can read and,\nI keep wanting to say emulate.\n\n203\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.845\nBut it virtualizes, a lot of times,\nthe graphics adapter that you also have.\n\n204\n00:11:05.845 --> 00:11:08.283\nAnd it doesn't give you\naccess to everything, but\n\n205\n00:11:08.283 --> 00:11:10.663\nit gives you access to a lot\nof those features, and\n\n206\n00:11:10.663 --> 00:11:13.345\na little slice of it to be able\nto work the way it needs to.\n\n207\n00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:14.248\nSo the good thing is,\n\n208\n00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:17.520\neven in VirtualBox, if I had multiple\ndisplays, it can emulate, or\n\n209\n00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.220\nit can actually display multiple displays\nif that operating system will support it.\n\n210\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:21.942\n>> Take advantage of that.\n\n211\n00:11:21.942 --> 00:11:24.711\nI mean, who wants to have three displays\nsitting their on their monitor, and\n\n212\n00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:27.270\nthey open VirtualBox and you're\nworking with that virtual machine and\n\n213\n00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.610\nyou're limited to that one window.\n\n214\n00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.660\nSo it's fantastic, I can stretch it out.\n\n215\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.360\nSo these are a lot of the settings that\nreally help me interact with the machine,\n\n216\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.860\nthey're not really like operating\nsystem settings, right.\n\n217\n00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.502\nThey're not involving Server 2012 or\nWindows 10 in a virtual machine.\n\n218\n00:11:42.502 --> 00:11:46.912\nYou see, these are settings that allow me\nto interact with the virtual machine, or\n\n219\n00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:49.060\nthe other virtual machines that I have.\n\n220\n00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.454\nAnd that's an important part of\nany virtualization technology,\n\n221\n00:11:53.454 --> 00:11:57.219\nis being able to get around and\nget to these settings, and\n\n222\n00:11:57.219 --> 00:12:02.750\nmake my keyboard work properly when I'm\nin that virtual machine and I hit Ctrl+C.\n\n223\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.160\nIs it copying what's inside\nmy virtual machine or\n\n224\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.350\nis it doing something on the host?\n\n225\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.080\nSo, important that we familiarize\nourselves with all of these\n\n226\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.770\noptions that we have available, and\nthose additions, really important, right?\n\n227\n00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.900\nI wanna be able to, if I want to be able\nto shut that machine down gracefully\n\n228\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.160\nfrom outside of the virtual machine,\nwell now VirtualBox can do that.\n\n229\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.990\nBecause it's got those additions that\nallow it to tie into that operating\n\n230\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.610\nsystem, and\nit knows how to trigger a shutdown\n\n231\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.127\ninstead of just pulling the plug on it.\n\n232\n00:12:28.127 --> 00:12:31.260\n>> There's no doubt that these\nare some of the important features.\n\n233\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.275\nBut let's go ahead and\nget into these additions here.\n\n234\n00:12:33.275 --> 00:12:35.263\nI keep talking about it,\nsaying we're gonna get it but I'm like, oh\n\n235\n00:12:35.263 --> 00:12:36.553\nthere's a whole list of stuff that we can-\n>> We're finally there!\n\n236\n00:12:36.553 --> 00:12:37.296\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n237\n00:12:37.296 --> 00:12:38.759\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So here it is.\n\n238\n00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.525\nIf we need to add in those extensions, and\n\n239\n00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:43.077\nwe really do recommend that you do that,\nright?\n\n240\n00:12:43.077 --> 00:12:46.017\nYou always wanna make sure you have\nthe latest editions that match up\n\n241\n00:12:46.017 --> 00:12:48.887\nto your version of VirtualBox\nthat your running.\n\n242\n00:12:48.887 --> 00:12:50.469\nAnd so\nif you download the latest editions,\n\n243\n00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:52.017\nmake sure you get\nthe latest ones of these.\n\n244\n00:12:52.017 --> 00:12:54.977\n>> Is there any reason I wouldn't\nwanna put these editions on there?\n\n245\n00:12:54.977 --> 00:12:56.227\n>> No, not really, right?\n\n246\n00:12:56.227 --> 00:13:00.470\nThe very fact is, if you know that\nyour gonna be, newer hardware\n\n247\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.742\nis always gonna be better, as you actually\nput VirtualBox on newer hardware.\n\n248\n00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:09.900\nThese VirtualBox extensions, the extension\npacks that you have, really do insure that\n\n249\n00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.370\nthe latest features that it knows about,\nit can recognize as much as it can, and\n\n250\n00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.538\nbe able to give you the benefits of\naccessing that type of hardware.\n\n251\n00:13:17.538 --> 00:13:19.240\nBut there's sometimes where you go,\n\n252\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.430\nlook, I don't care if I\naccess that hardware or not.\n\n253\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.880\nThen yeah,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n254\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.530\nBut if you say look, I'm gonna buy a brand\nnew server, I'm going to run VirtualBox\n\n255\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.650\non it, and they might have later drivers,\nmore updated drivers.\n\n256\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.490\nThese extension packs really\ndo give you that advantage of\n\n257\n00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.010\nmaking sure their recognized.\n\n258\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.680\n>> Now what about, when they come out\nwith a new version of VirtualBox,\n\n259\n00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.190\ndoes that also update those extensions?\n\n260\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.950\n>> Yes and no, okay, and I know that's\nfunny, like why would you say that?\n\n261\n00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.509\nWell, a lot of times they tell you,\nsome of these things, right,\n\n262\n00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:51.678\nwill work perfectly fine even\nwith the old extensions.\n\n263\n00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:55.220\nCuz there's really not a ton\nof changes between them.\n\n264\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.145\nBut what you wanna do,\n\n265\n00:13:56.145 --> 00:13:59.526\nis you wanna make sure that they match up\nto the version of VirtualBox, is the key.\n\n266\n00:13:59.526 --> 00:14:03.512\nSo if it's 5.0.10,\nwhich I think is what this one is,\n\n267\n00:14:03.512 --> 00:14:07.690\nI want to go to VirtualBox and\nmake sure I get the 5.0.10.\n\n268\n00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:12.360\nThe good thing is, when you update it,\nif you do end up updating your VirtualBox\n\n269\n00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.020\nsetting and you need those latest\nextensions, it will tell you.\n\n270\n00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.430\nWhen you update it, it says hey look,\nthere's a newer extension pack out there\n\n271\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:25.450\nthat should work better with the version\nof VirtualBox that you're on.\n\n272\n00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.670\nSo it really is a nice\nsystem to help you out.\n\n273\n00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.960\nNow if you try and\nrun it with the old one, is it gonna run?\n\n274\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.890\nIt probably will, or it'll actually\ndisable some of those features\n\n275\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.880\nthat says I don't\nrecognize that older pack.\n\n276\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.280\nAnd I've seen that on kind of, I think\ntwo or three previous versions ago.\n\n277\n00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.430\nBut the latest ones that I've downloaded,\nit seemed like it just\n\n278\n00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:47.070\nkept the older one in the background\nuntil I chose to do this manually.\n\n279\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.270\nSo, here it is, here's the extensions.\n\n280\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:53.623\nAnd if I want to add those in, I can click\non this little drop-down right here, and\n\n281\n00:14:53.623 --> 00:14:59.290\nit automatically went to my downloads\nfolder and it sees that extension pack.\n\n282\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:03.450\nNow you can also, because I think it\nmay be an EXE, I don't think so, but\n\n283\n00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.830\nwhatever the pack is, it depends on\nwhat system that you're operating.\n\n284\n00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.710\nSometimes, like in a Linux system,\nyou actually do have\n\n285\n00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.910\nto kind of double-click on it and\nthen it gives you the options.\n\n286\n00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:17.240\nOf course, inside of a Mac, you also have\nto do something a little bit different\n\n287\n00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.150\nwith it, but this one's fairly simple.\n\n288\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.280\nYou select it, and\nthen you go ahead and click Open.\n\n289\n00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.280\nAnd in a moment here it says,\nhey what do you wanna do,\n\n290\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.080\nand we'll actually go ahead and\nsay let's go ahead and install this.\n\n291\n00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.560\nIt tells you all the stuff here,\n\n292\n00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.920\nso there's the webcam that we had\ntalked under previous edition.\n\n293\n00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:37.740\nIt also gives us the ability to run\na remote desktop server, the PXE boot.\n\n294\n00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.230\nIt can even allow us to do AES\ndisk encryption if we choose to.\n\n295\n00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.974\nSo I mean, that's an added feature because\nof that extension pack inside of your\n\n296\n00:15:46.974 --> 00:15:50.971\nvirtual machine that you probably\ndidn't have before without it.\n\n297\n00:15:50.971 --> 00:15:53.430\nOf course and\nthen there's USB features as well.\n\n298\n00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:58.295\nWe click Install and we have to agree\nto the end user licensing agreement.\n\n299\n00:15:58.295 --> 00:16:00.023\nWe have to scroll all the way down.\n\n300\n00:16:00.023 --> 00:16:01.303\nAnd then, we click agree.\n\n301\n00:16:01.303 --> 00:16:05.575\nAnd then we let it install and there is\ngoes, it begins that process, and this\n\n302\n00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:09.917\nwill really go ahead and fundamentally\nadd in those different extensions, so\n\n303\n00:16:09.917 --> 00:16:13.490\nthat your machine can work\nwith them a little bit better.\n\n304\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.120\nSo those are some of the global\nsettings that we have and\n\n305\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.590\nnotice I haven't even\nstarted up the VM yet.\n\n306\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:24.010\nSo at this point on the VM ,this is\nwhere it gets a little bit tricky.\n\n307\n00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.290\nYou start seeing all these other\nfeatures that area available over here\n\n308\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.240\non the right hand side,\nthese are the details of the machine.\n\n309\n00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.590\nNow notice we're not talking about\nthe operating system, I know.\n\n310\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.370\nEverybody's all excited about operating\nsystems, but I'm excited about the virtual\n\n311\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:40.080\nbox here, but look at all\nthe feature that you have access to.\n\n312\n00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:45.220\nYou can see what operating system you're\nworking on, and then the system itself.\n\n313\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:50.200\nI've got 2 gigs of ram, and even though I\ndidn't ask for it, I have a floppy drive,\n\n314\n00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.748\nan optical drive, a hard disc drive.\n\n315\n00:16:51.748 --> 00:16:57.810\nI've got my Intel VT extensions turned on,\n\n316\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.680\nmy nested paging, that's the same as what\nwe're talking about there, Hyper V and\n\n317\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.850\nthen, even this other word down\nhere that says Paravirtualization.\n\n318\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.200\nNow those are fancy,\nfancy terms when you get into them, but\n\n319\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.700\nParavirtualization is saying look,\nI can deal with this old school way.\n\n320\n00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.620\nIf you didn't have that Intel VT, I could\nstill do it, I can still virtualize and\n\n321\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.110\ndo a lot of different things.\n\n322\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.920\nIt's just an older terminology for\n\n323\n00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.640\nus, but it absolutely is\na system that can handle that.\n\n324\n00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.950\nAnd then, here's the regular default\ndisplay and then of course storage and\n\n325\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.040\nyou see that right now it sees my\nhard drive right here, and then,\n\n326\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.495\nit sees my ISO where I installed\nthat operating system,\n\n327\n00:17:36.495 --> 00:17:40.440\nan equivalent to of course,\na DVD and basic audio.\n\n328\n00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.060\nAnd here's some of the things that it\ndoesn't technically virtualize right\n\n329\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.930\nhere at the bottom and this is where we\nget into what we call emulation, right.\n\n330\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.385\nThe very fact is that\nsometimes because there are so\n\n331\n00:17:51.385 --> 00:17:55.390\nmany different vendors that are out there,\nit doesn't actually have the drivers for\n\n332\n00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.890\nevery single of vendor of hardware\nthat's out there on the planet.\n\n333\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.660\nSo, some of the things that are very\ngeneric to every system like audio, right.\n\n334\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.690\nInstead it says look,\n\n335\n00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:06.720\nlet me just emulate this software\npack that runs inside of Windows.\n\n336\n00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.450\nSo there's the Windows\ndirect sound drivers,\n\n337\n00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.860\nand it's got an Intel\naudio driver right there.\n\n338\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.890\nSo instead of actually going through your\nsystem and finding like Mike has exclusive\n\n339\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.960\nall tech lansing, some incredible\nsound system on his laptop there,\n\n340\n00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.770\nit says, yeah, we're just gonna give\nyou the AC97 audio sound something.\n\n341\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.950\nAnd it's just because it's easy, right?\n\n342\n00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.560\nThey don't have to go out and\n\n343\n00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.360\ntry to convince every vendor that\nthis is what it wants to do.\n\n344\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.960\nSo, there's some of it it does emulate\nat the end that may not be perfect.\n\n345\n00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.100\nSo if you wanted to do an audio file and\n\n346\n00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.270\nlisten to every single bass note\nit's probably not going to do it.\n\n347\n00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:47.846\n>> Yeah, typically in our VM's we really\ndon't need to have high fidelity, right.\n\n348\n00:18:47.846 --> 00:18:50.840\n[LAUGH] We're hearing beeps and\nerror codes and things like that.\n\n349\n00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.980\nThat's pretty much all we need.\n\n350\n00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.880\n>> That really is, so there are just\nsome of those different settings.\n\n351\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.260\nNow, just when you say that and\nyou see that, right?\n\n352\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.330\nThat's a good way to actually know\nwhat your system should perform\n\n353\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.050\nlike right there, and then,\nif I select that virtual machine,\n\n354\n00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.890\nI can click on Settings, and notice that\nthis gives me a whole 'nother list, right?\n\n355\n00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:15.390\nWe previously saw the entire list for\neverything that's inside of the virtual\n\n356\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:19.450\nmachine monitor, but now we're actually\nseeing this one for the specific server,\n\n357\n00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.630\nand we're actually gonna go through this\nin a later episode and talk about some of\n\n358\n00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.300\nthese other details here, but we wanna\ngo ahead and get started at this point.\n\n359\n00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.050\nI know I've talked long enough and showed\nyou a few things, but let's get this\n\n360\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:33.750\nmachine started and show you what it\nfunctions just after a basic install.\n\n361\n00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:38.270\nSo as it boots up here, you'll actually\nsee some of the stuff that's going on and\n\n362\n00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.740\nI'll see if I can full screen it so\nthat we can see it a little bit more.\n\n363\n00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.960\nNotice that at the top up here,\nwe're starting to get warnings, right?\n\n364\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.180\nSo, it's very difficult for\nus to be able to see.\n\n365\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.060\nIt says you have the auto capture\nkeyboard option turned on.\n\n366\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.509\nThis will cause the virtual machine to\nautomatically capture the keyboard every\n\n367\n00:19:54.509 --> 00:19:57.020\ntime the VM window is activated and\n\n368\n00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.490\nmake it unavailable to other applications\nrunning on your host machine.\n\n369\n00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.810\nSo in other words, it can capture\nyour keyboard, so you think you're\n\n370\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.880\ntyping in host machine and\nyou're inside the VM is, what's going on?\n\n371\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.580\nSo it says it's automatically turned on\nand then I got a second one right here\n\n372\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.400\nthat said the same thing\nabout the mouse as well.\n\n373\n00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.040\nSo the VirtualMachine reports guest OS\nsupports mouse pointer integration,\n\n374\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.660\nmeans you don't have to capture\nit to move in and out and so,\n\n375\n00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.500\nthat's a nice feature inside of 2016.\n\n376\n00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.020\nIt says look, I support this where\n\n377\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.540\nit shouldn't actually lock itself\ninside of the VM with your mouse.\n\n378\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.320\nIn earlier editions of Windows, you might\nhave actually seen that where my mouse\n\n379\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.100\nis not letting me escape and I've done\nthat before too, it's frustrating.\n\n380\n00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.350\n>> Extremely annoying, you click once\ninside that virtual machine to make it\n\n381\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:47.070\nthe active window and now your key strokes\nand your mouse clicks should apply to that\n\n382\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.880\nvirtual machine, but you want to go click\non something on your physical desktop and\n\n383\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.720\nyour mouse stops at the edge of\nthat virtual machine window and\n\n384\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.920\nyou have to do some keyboard\ncombination to get the mouse out.\n\n385\n00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.890\nNow it's smart enough to know hey, when\nthe mouse is hovering over the virtual\n\n386\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.010\nmachine window, then any click should\nbe applied to the virtual machine.\n\n387\n00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:08.240\nBut if that mouse moves outside of\nthe virtual machine window and I click,\n\n388\n00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.730\nthen apply the click to that physical host\nmachine without any interaction from us.\n\n389\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.600\nThat's fantastic.\n\n390\n00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.220\n>> That really is because, Mike, I think\nyou remember when we were in Virtual PC\n\n391\n00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.890\n2007, it would be very easy, and then,\nthe first time you're using like, so\n\n392\n00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:26.300\nnow how do I actually get outside of that\nto click on the link that I need to,\n\n393\n00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.810\nand you just had to sit there and\ngo, okay.\n\n394\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.340\nSo, you went to another machine,\nlike I did,\n\n395\n00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.001\nused a mouse to do a Google search and\nyou had to figure out what you had to do.\n\n396\n00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then, try to figure out exactly,\n\n397\n00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.810\ncuz every virtualization program\nhad a different key combination to\n\n398\n00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.920\nrelease the mouse from\nthe virtual machine.\n\n399\n00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.460\nBut if you couldn't get out of\nthe virtual machine, yeah, it was a pain.\n\n400\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.620\n>> It was one of the biggest\npains in the world, but\n\n401\n00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.800\nthe nice thing is this operating\nsystem says, I'll support it and\n\n402\n00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.980\nso, you can see it over here\non the right-hand side.\n\n403\n00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.390\nI was trying to make sure I could see it.\n\n404\n00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.390\nSo, notice that now the mouse is actually\ninside of that virtual machine window.\n\n405\n00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:03.050\nIf I now move out, well now of course,\nthere it goes, I was trying to show both,\n\n406\n00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.950\nyeah [LAUGH] I was like, it was\nworking just a moment ago, now you can\n\n407\n00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:10.150\nactually see where that mouse is no\nlonger moving inside of that window, but\n\n408\n00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.490\noutside the window, I'm actually moving\nmy mouse so that we can see that as well.\n\n409\n00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:14.490\nThat's what they're talking about.\n\n410\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.750\nIt gives us the ability to freely\nmove in and out and between there.\n\n411\n00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.530\nNow, we want to start\nthis virtual machine, or\n\n412\n00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.133\nI want to get access into it, and\nat the top of that screen there,\n\n413\n00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:26.640\nand it says right here,\npress Ctr+-Alt+Delete to sign in.\n\n414\n00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.140\n>> Do it.\n\n415\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.580\n>> So, if I do a Ctrl+Alt+Delete,\nlet's see if I can do this.\n\n416\n00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.395\nControl, let me try it here.\n\n417\n00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:37.770\nCtrl+Alt+Delete oh,\nnothing is happening there, yep.\n\n418\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:43.260\nNothing actually happening at that point,\nso it's not really allowing me to do that.\n\n419\n00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.500\nSo, they normally have of course,\na host key combination.\n\n420\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.380\nIf I go up to input and\n\n421\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.520\nkeyboard, you can see right here\nwhere it says what the host key is.\n\n422\n00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.420\nNow if you're on a Windows machine,\nyou normally\n\n423\n00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.690\nhave on virtual boxes the right control\nkey and then you hit the delete key.\n\n424\n00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.975\nSo, I always do my thumb\non the control and\n\n425\n00:23:01.975 --> 00:23:05.960\nthen I use one of those up there\nto actually hit delete and\n\n426\n00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.810\nthat normally sends the command that\nallows me to be able to get in there.\n\n427\n00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.880\nNow the challenge that I have Mike\nis a little bit different here.\n\n428\n00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:19.020\nI'm actually on a Mac machine using\nremote desktop into a Windows machine.\n\n429\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.455\n>> [LAUGH] I'm looking Ronny, and\nI do not see that right control key.\n\n430\n00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:25.550\n>> Yeah, there is no right\ncontrol key on the Mac and\n\n431\n00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.530\nso, you have to go in there and\nre-assign those settings, right?\n\n432\n00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.220\nSo you can click on keyboard settings and\n\n433\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.000\nthis is where it brings you back to those\npreferences that we were talking about.\n\n434\n00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.500\nAnd then, I can scroll down\ninside of that virtual machine.\n\n435\n00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:44.440\nI scroll down, I look for\nthe insert, Ctrl+Alt+Delete here and\n\n436\n00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.530\nI can get rid of that, and\nthen, I can do my command key\n\n437\n00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.185\n>> See, now it's actually locked in there.\n\n438\n00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:57.617\nSo, let me do a, see, it won't actually\nlet me do it from right there.\n\n439\n00:23:57.617 --> 00:24:01.066\nSo there's a lot of times where you can do\nthat, let me just get it out of that and\n\n440\n00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.076\ntry to do that, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:02.076 --> 00:24:06.220\nNow because I'm not actually able to\ndo it very easily right here, right?\n\n442\n00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.223\nThe good thing is I can go up to input,\nI can do keyboard, and\n\n443\n00:24:10.223 --> 00:24:13.439\nselect this link, and\nthat now gets me inside.\n\n444\n00:24:13.439 --> 00:24:17.266\nAnd then I type in my password,\nand we are ready and\n\n445\n00:24:17.266 --> 00:24:20.562\nable to get started here and\nget access in.\n\n446\n00:24:20.562 --> 00:24:24.456\n>> And it's really nice that it lets you\nremap those keystrokes because you might\n\n447\n00:24:24.456 --> 00:24:27.938\nhave other things like in the case\nof Windows that Ctrll+Alt+Delete\n\n448\n00:24:27.938 --> 00:24:31.596\nworks against the host machine so\nI can map that to something else as Ronnie\n\n449\n00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:34.975\nfound out on his Mac he found out\nhe didn't have a right control key.\n\n450\n00:24:34.975 --> 00:24:38.944\nBut the program allows me to go in and\nreconfigure that to something that I\n\n451\n00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:42.340\ndo have, something that's not\nbeing used by anything else.\n\n452\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.310\nI can change it to whatever I want.\n\n453\n00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.148\nJust another FYI,\nbecause I know this got me first, Ronnie-,\n\n454\n00:24:47.148 --> 00:24:49.948\nthere is a difference between\nright control and left control.\n\n455\n00:24:49.948 --> 00:24:50.920\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n456\n00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.740\n>> We're used to seeing it as well,\nit doesnt matter what hand I use,\n\n457\n00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.420\nI've got a control and an alt on\neither side of the space bar, and for\n\n458\n00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.680\nmost situations they're exactly the same.\n\n459\n00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.780\nBut just keep in mind when you hit\nthat key and it sends that command to\n\n460\n00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.800\nthe computer, there is a different\naskey code for each one of those keys.\n\n461\n00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.610\nAnd when they say right Alt Alt or\nright Control, it means not the correct\n\n462\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.500\ncontrol but the one on the right side\nof the space bar on your keyboard.\n\n463\n00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.460\nSo it's just really cool that they\nallow me to remap those keystrokes so\n\n464\n00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.480\nthat I can use something that's easy for\nme.\n\n465\n00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.450\nMaybe that's a pain the way\nmy keyboard is laid out.\n\n466\n00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.530\nThat particular combination is hard to do,\nall right?\n\n467\n00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.720\nOr maybe I have trouble\nwith one of my hands, and\n\n468\n00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.720\nI can't do that stretching that they want\nme to do with that keystroke combination.\n\n469\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.480\nChange it to something that works for you.\n\n470\n00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.870\nIt's that easy and then as you've said,\nwe always have the failback\n\n471\n00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.160\nof the menus up at the top if\nwe don't like the keystrokes.\n\n472\n00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.548\n>> And sometimes it does\nwork in that particular way.\n\n473\n00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:54.090\nSo I'm kinda doing a little bit\nof some jumping around because of\n\n474\n00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.140\nthe machine I'm on and then having\nto be able to run this as well.\n\n475\n00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.250\nNow there's another thing that you're\nalso seeing right here on my screen too\n\n476\n00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.590\nwhich is, Mike, even though this is\nactually a working virtual machine\n\n477\n00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.510\nnotice these wide bars over here on\nthe side, and I have to use this\n\n478\n00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.760\nscroll to be able to actually access\nthe fullness of this machine.\n\n479\n00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.920\nWell, that's actually part of that\nlock-in inside that virtual machine, but\n\n480\n00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.590\nwe can actually fix this a lot of times.\n\n481\n00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.257\n>> Good, because I don't wanna have\nto scroll to see my Start Menu.\n\n482\n00:26:22.257 --> 00:26:24.640\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true,\nthat's pretty bad.\n\n483\n00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.810\nSo the good thing is when you actually do\nlaunch up a virtual machine we have what\n\n484\n00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:33.810\nwe call a virtual box additions and\nwhat is that?\n\n485\n00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:39.200\nThat is another pack that makes this\nvirtual machine run better, okay?\n\n486\n00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.330\nIt makes the screen actually adjust and\ndo all the things that it needs to.\n\n487\n00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:47.120\nIt allows for integration into the machine\nitself so that my virtual machine.\n\n488\n00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.680\nAs well as the host machine we can even\nshare files between them which I can't do\n\n489\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.310\nright now for this machine.\n\n490\n00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.380\nSo, the way that we normally do that\ninside of virtual box is fairly simple is,\n\n491\n00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.340\nI go up to the word devices.\n\n492\n00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.220\nI'm about to say the wrong one and then,\n\n493\n00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.970\nnotice there's a link here that\nsays insert guest edition's CD.\n\n494\n00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:12.300\nAnd there is never a time, I cannot\nactually even think of a time, when you\n\n495\n00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.710\nwould not choose to run this, because this\nis absolutely something that really does\n\n496\n00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.950\nmake the machine work better, and actually\neven make the machine work faster.\n\n497\n00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.350\nBecause it really does give it access\ninto that host machine as well.\n\n498\n00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:25.140\n>> In all fairness,\n\n499\n00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.970\nsome people like to work with slow\nmachines that are difficult to work with.\n\n500\n00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.003\nSo maybe they don't want\nthose additions in there.\n\n501\n00:27:31.003 --> 00:27:35.228\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, the day that you\nchoose that may be the day that you.\n\n502\n00:27:35.228 --> 00:27:38.698\nYou go maybe we should just work\nwith the physical machine and\n\n503\n00:27:38.698 --> 00:27:40.690\nnot worry about this thing.\n\n504\n00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.350\n>> Well Ronnie, this is unlike the\nextensions that we added those were global\n\n505\n00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.370\nto virtual box so I did it once and\n\n506\n00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:51.850\nit applied to all of the virtual machines\nI have and ones I create in the future.\n\n507\n00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.182\nThis doesn't look like\nit's that way though.\n\n508\n00:27:53.182 --> 00:27:56.488\n>> No,\nthis one only effects this one machine so\n\n509\n00:27:56.488 --> 00:28:01.012\nevery VM you build if you have\na machine that can host 15 VMs.\n\n510\n00:28:01.012 --> 00:28:04.293\nYou're gonna wanna do this for\nevery single one of these VMs here, but\n\n511\n00:28:04.293 --> 00:28:06.530\nthis is really what gives\nit that integration.\n\n512\n00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:10.360\nThat mouse thing that we talked about, if\nit wasn't for the operating system itself\n\n513\n00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.910\nalready handling it,\nthis also turns that feature on.\n\n514\n00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:18.050\nIt gives us the ability to\nuse the video adaptor, so\n\n515\n00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.440\nit allows for the stretching of the screen\nto actually look like it's full screen.\n\n516\n00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.000\nYou name it,\n\n517\n00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.970\nit really is one of the features that\nallows the network adapter to work better.\n\n518\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.650\nI mean anything else here,\n\n519\n00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.130\nthis is an enhancement that you absolutely\nwanna add into every single one.\n\n520\n00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.050\nThe nice thing is, it's a simple wizard.\n\n521\n00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.300\nMost of the time, I just go ahead and\nI click through and\n\n522\n00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.830\nthere are only two boxes.\n\n523\n00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.750\nOne made me read and say here's what\nyou're doing and then the next one\n\n524\n00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:44.020\nactually said here are the features you\nwant to install and was just grayed out.\n\n525\n00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.830\nIt said install them all,\nis what it really did.\n\n526\n00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.630\nNow you do have to actually adjust here,\nit says hey, we'd like to install this,\n\n527\n00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:51.130\nare you sure?\n\n528\n00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.440\nAnd that's because Windows does\nrequire driver signing a lot of times\n\n529\n00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.530\nwhen you're installing.\n\n530\n00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.560\nSo just go ahead and\nI always put a check mark here.\n\n531\n00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.910\nAnd just tell it to install, cuz it may\nactually have to add in more than one.\n\n532\n00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.530\nSo sometimes you may\nend up seeing that too.\n\n533\n00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.810\nAnd then from that point at the end,\nit's gonna ask me to reboot.\n\n534\n00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.323\nAnd if I'm still doing other stuff,\nI can reboot manually later on.\n\n535\n00:29:10.323 --> 00:29:13.659\nI'm not, I'm gonna allow it to reboot and\nonce we reboot,\n\n536\n00:29:13.659 --> 00:29:17.151\neverything should,\nI have to use the operative word should.\n\n537\n00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:18.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because on this show,\n\n538\n00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.950\nI never know what's\ngonna end up happening.\n\n539\n00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.790\nEverything should end up\nworking perfectly fine.\n\n540\n00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.930\nNow I went ahead and\nre-adjusted a size down or\n\n541\n00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.130\nrestored down the setting because I\nwant you to see what happens, right?\n\n542\n00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.480\nWhen you saw me do it earlier,\nwhen at full-screen it popped out and\n\n543\n00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.376\nhad those white bars on the side, right?\n\n544\n00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:37.407\nYeah, and so.\n>> The old letter boxing or what have you.\n\n545\n00:29:37.407 --> 00:29:39.050\n>> Yeah, the letter boxing and so\n\n546\n00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:43.820\nnow you see still like that really\ndoesn't look much different here.\n\n547\n00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.630\nNow if I go ahead and\n\n548\n00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.070\nfull screen this, Ronnie,\nnothing really much is different yet.\n\n549\n00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:52.790\nBut let's see this time when\nI log in to help us out.\n\n550\n00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.650\nSo usually it takes\na little bit of time here.\n\n551\n00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:00.160\nBut this should now end up, if everything\nis actually working correctly here,\n\n552\n00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.700\nit's gonna make me\na liar here in a moment.\n\n553\n00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.240\nBut we should see it does\na little bit configuration and\n\n554\n00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.335\nafter a moment here it should change and\nreadjust on the size.\n\n555\n00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.535\nThere it goes, see,\nI was beginning to worry Mike.\n\n556\n00:30:13.535 --> 00:30:15.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I know I've done this\n\n557\n00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.776\n100 times, but\nwhen you are sitting there on the show and\n\n558\n00:30:17.776 --> 00:30:20.105\nyour like oh this should\nwork perfectly not well.\n\n559\n00:30:20.105 --> 00:30:21.607\n>> Yeah, we've got those HD cameras,\n\n560\n00:30:21.607 --> 00:30:24.647\nI don't know if you can see the sweat\nforming on his forehead there, but.\n\n561\n00:30:24.647 --> 00:30:25.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n562\n00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.840\nit just takes a minute to load everything\nup and then all of a sudden, bada-bing,\n\n563\n00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.270\nit stretches out,\ntakes up your entire monitor,\n\n564\n00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.430\nno more scrolling to get down\nto your taskbar, that's perfect.\n\n565\n00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.540\nNow it really feels like you're\nsitting at that server machine.\n\n566\n00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.110\n>> Well, even more right,\nyou kind of get a hint up here at the top.\n\n567\n00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.570\nThat you are actually\nsitting on something else,\n\n568\n00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.230\nbecause you're starting to see where\nit still says, Oracle VirtualBox.\n\n569\n00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.800\nBut notice I can go up to View here and\nalso select that Full Screen Mode if I\n\n570\n00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.260\nwant to, Seamless Mode and Scaled and\nbe able to do some of the stuff like that.\n\n571\n00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.180\nNow I could go ahead and\nselect that right now,\n\n572\n00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.970\nbecause I'm having\nissues with my keyboard.\n\n573\n00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.641\nI don't know if I can ever get out of\nthat Full Screen Mode for right now.\n\n574\n00:31:04.641 --> 00:31:07.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you can.\n\n575\n00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.070\nYou can adjust that to where\nit really does look like it is\n\n576\n00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.650\nactually the machine that\nyou're sitting on and\n\n577\n00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:17.510\nthat you don't have a hint that\nit's a virtual machine at all.\n\n578\n00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.040\n>> I tell you what Ronnie, we're just\nabout out of time for this episode.\n\n579\n00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.190\nSo why don't you go ahead,\nand let's full screen it.\n\n580\n00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.783\nWe'll just stay in that machine for\nthe rest of the show.\n\n581\n00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:23.711\n>> Let's do it.\n\n582\n00:31:23.711 --> 00:31:25.128\nOkay, all right.\n\n583\n00:31:25.128 --> 00:31:27.194\nSo if I go ahead and click on view and\n\n584\n00:31:27.194 --> 00:31:29.917\nthen I can select this\nfull screen mode here.\n\n585\n00:31:29.917 --> 00:31:32.680\nNow this is going to\ntell me hey here it is.\n\n586\n00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.450\nI need to be able to press that\nhost key and that letter F and\n\n587\n00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:40.270\nthen once I do that I can go ahead and\nclick switch.\n\n588\n00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.880\nAnd so now if you take a look,\nthere it is.\n\n589\n00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.760\nIt is now full screen.\n\n590\n00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.730\nAnd there's only a small hint that we're\nactually not in that machine that sitting\n\n591\n00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:50.945\nthere physically.\n\n592\n00:31:50.945 --> 00:31:53.729\nLet's see if we can full-screen\nthat just for a moment so\n\n593\n00:31:53.729 --> 00:31:56.694\nthat we can tell what's going\non here all the way over to the.\n\n594\n00:31:56.694 --> 00:31:59.397\nThe corner, so we'll full-screen this.\n\n595\n00:31:59.397 --> 00:32:01.280\nWe'll be able to see that.\n\n596\n00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.780\n>> Yeah.\n\n597\n00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.170\n>> So now, notice there it is.\n\n598\n00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:07.440\nI can now manage this server,\njust like everything else that we can do.\n\n599\n00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.580\nSo there's a server manager.\n\n600\n00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.900\nIf I reduce that down,\nand I'm on Server 2012.\n\n601\n00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.460\nI was on Windows 10.\n\n602\n00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:17.690\nBut you might see down here at the bottom\nedge this kind of white, a little bar.\n\n603\n00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.740\nAnd if I hover over that,\n\n604\n00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:24.790\nthat is where I can still access all those\nsettings that we were looking at before.\n\n605\n00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.630\nThere's the Preference,\nhere's the virtual machines.\n\n606\n00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:31.960\nThe view, I can still change it from here\nand get out of the full screen mode, so\n\n607\n00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.550\nnotice we can do that.\n\n608\n00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:36.140\nThere are a bunch of these\ndifferent sizes, and\n\n609\n00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.380\neven be able to move the menu bar.\n\n610\n00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.700\nThere are just so many options that\nare right here that are available to us\n\n611\n00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.210\nthat really allow us to be able to\ndo all the things that we need to.\n\n612\n00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.890\nSo just being able to work\nwith that virtual machine at\n\n613\n00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.880\nthis particular point in time\nis really going to be helpful.\n\n614\n00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.730\nYou know, because it can.\n\n615\n00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:59.050\nWe can set this up for somebody being\nas their own desktop environment.\n\n616\n00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:02.190\nThere's been times where I\nhave been absolutely fooled,\n\n617\n00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.080\nas I've worked through this thing and\nthen realized oh,\n\n618\n00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.860\nI did that on that machine and\nnot my real machine.\n\n619\n00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.840\nSo it's really amazing\nwhen you start seeing\n\n620\n00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.690\nsome of those settings\nthat you can actually do.\n\n621\n00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:16.670\nNow once we get used to that, and\neverything is actually working just about\n\n622\n00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:21.380\nthe way that we want, there are still some\nother settings that we need to take a look\n\n623\n00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.536\nat, and what we'll talk about things\nlike cloning and even how to export and\n\n624\n00:33:26.536 --> 00:33:30.740\nimport a virtual machine, and\neven some other settings that we can do\n\n625\n00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.780\nthat may help improve the performance\nof our machine, as well.\n\n626\n00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.005\nBut Mike,\nit looks like I talked a long time.\n\n627\n00:33:36.005 --> 00:33:36.960\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, well I tell you what,\n\n628\n00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.610\nthere's a lot of great\ninformation there Ronnie.\n\n629\n00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:42.180\nYou know, we got that machine installed\nthe other day, or in a previous episode,\n\n630\n00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.026\nnow I feel like we're getting\nused to that interface, you know,\n\n631\n00:33:45.026 --> 00:33:46.292\ngetting everything set up.\n\n632\n00:33:46.292 --> 00:33:48.473\nWe had to install the extension packs,\n\n633\n00:33:48.473 --> 00:33:52.750\nwe can get some of the neat functionality\nthat virtual box provides us.\n\n634\n00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.850\nAnd then we've got a lot of\nglobal settings that we can do\n\n635\n00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.980\nthat apply to all the virtual machines.\n\n636\n00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.750\nAnd then more importantly we\nsaw some settings that apply to\n\n637\n00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:04.110\nthat individual machine,\nwe got it launched up, we got in there,\n\n638\n00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.740\nwe saw we can change those keyboard\nshortcuts so that, you know,\n\n639\n00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.900\nif our keyboard layout's a little\nbit different, then we can\n\n640\n00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.740\nremap those keystrokes or those keyboard\nshortcuts to something that we like.\n\n641\n00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.500\nWe saw that installing those additions\nthat gives us the ability to go full\n\n642\n00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:24.640\nscreen and almost hide the fact that\nwe're even working inside a VM.\n\n643\n00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.300\nAlso important to note that you have\nto have those keystrokes to get back\n\n644\n00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.600\nout of that, sometimes that's the trick.\n\n645\n00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.970\nBut as Ronnie showed us,\nthe menu doesn't go away, it hides it.\n\n646\n00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:37.166\nBut it kinda moved it down to the bottom\nof the screen in like an autohide thing.\n\n647\n00:34:37.166 --> 00:34:40.202\nSo as soon as I hover over it,\nworst-case scenario,\n\n648\n00:34:40.202 --> 00:34:43.709\nI forget the keystroke combination\nto get out of full screen,\n\n649\n00:34:43.709 --> 00:34:46.550\nI can go down to that menu and\nI can get out that way.\n\n650\n00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.130\nSo lots of great information.\n\n651\n00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.290\nI know we got more to go,\nRonnie, but you are right.\n\n652\n00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.710\nWe are out of time for this one.\n\n653\n00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.240\nSo those are gonna have to\nwait until the next episode.\n\n654\n00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.597\nSo make sure you come back and\ncheck that out.\n\n655\n00:34:55.597 --> 00:34:59.250\nFor now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n656\n00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.879\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n657\n00:35:00.879 --> 00:35:07.560\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.454\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.288\ntoday we're looking at virtualization\ntechnologies and specifically we're\n\n5\n00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:25.050\ngoing to continue on our exploration\nof an application known as VirtualBox.\n\n6\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.930\nNow we've already seen some basic\nconfiguration we can do with it.\n\n7\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.600\nWe got it installed,\nwe got our first VM created.\n\n8\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.880\nNow we're gonna take a look at some of\nthe more advanced configuration options\n\n9\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.780\nwe can do with VirtualBox.\n\n10\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.710\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nRonnie, Wong how is it going Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.380\n>> It's going well today, as we\ncontinue to take a look at VirtualBox.\n\n12\n00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.440\nThere are some things that we can\ndo inside a virtual box that you\n\n13\n00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.920\nmay not know about.\n\n14\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.850\nAnd the reason why we want to point\nthis out is because it really can mimic\n\n15\n00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.920\njust about a physical machine in a lot of\ndetails and I want to also show you that\n\n16\n00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.410\nas well, because it is important that we\nget the full functionality that we can out\n\n17\n00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.180\nof a VirtualBox, because a lot of times\nwe need more than what we start off with\n\n18\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.510\nwith that basic kind of wizard driven\nconfiguration that we start off with.\n\n19\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.170\n>> Absolutely.\nYou know,\n\n20\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.080\none of the first things I think of Ronnie\nis when we created that virtual machine it\n\n21\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.890\nhad a single hard drive.\n\n22\n00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.400\nAnd when we're talking about\nserver operating systems or\n\n23\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.570\nproduction environments, or\n\n24\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.480\neven a high end workstation,\nwe typically want more than one drive.\n\n25\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.670\nI have one drive for\nmy operating system and applications, but\n\n26\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.430\nI usually put all my data and\nother things on a separate physical\n\n27\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.670\ndisk because that way I can have\nseparate backup strategies for\n\n28\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.320\nthat data, if I have to\nreinstall the operating system.\n\n29\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.210\nI don't have to worry about\nthe re-doing of all my data.\n\n30\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.580\nCan I do that in VirtualBox?\n\n31\n00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.560\n>> You really can.\n\n32\n00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.330\nIt allows you to be able\nto add in multiple drives.\n\n33\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.390\nNow when we talk about that, it's not\nthat you go out to your box store and\n\n34\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.540\nyou pick up a terrabyte hard drive and go.\n\n35\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.150\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n36\n00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.890\nWhat do I do with this?\n\n37\n00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.860\nHow do I jam it into VirtualBox?\n\n38\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.280\nWell, we can actually create what\nare called virtual drives as well\n\n39\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.080\nto attach it into our\nstorage that we have.\n\n40\n00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.520\nSo, let me show you an example with the\nway that Windows is seeing it right now,\n\n41\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.860\nand then we'll show you how you can\nadd in an additional storage device.\n\n42\n00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.400\nSo, here it is.\n\n43\n00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.260\nHere's the basic virtual machine we\ncreated a couple of episodes ago.\n\n44\n00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.442\nAnd if we take a look.\n\n45\n00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:11.330\nI'm gonna open up our windows explorer and\nyou can see, there it is.\n\n46\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.120\nThere is that local disk C that we have,\nand\n\n47\n00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.640\nremember this is just a VirtualBox\nhardware drive file, it's called a .vdi.\n\n48\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.410\nWell we have a virtual disk, it's what the\nactual file format ends up standing for.\n\n49\n00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.710\nAnd we also have this\nVirtualBox guest editions.\n\n50\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.190\nIf I wanted to,\nI can actually eject that and\n\n51\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.540\nthat will leave me now with\nmy CD on a drive instead.\n\n52\n00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.640\nNow, remember all of this is virtualized.\n\n53\n00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.280\nSo if I now needed what\nMike was saying here,\n\n54\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.720\nwhich is look, this drive is fine but\nit is a small hard drive.\n\n55\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.300\nAnd I have, let's say,\nmore data, right, so\n\n56\n00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.350\nlet's say I have a couple of\nhundred gigabytes of data instead.\n\n57\n00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.430\n>> Or just following best practices,\nlike if we're running a web server,\n\n58\n00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.610\nI don't want my web sites on the same\ndrive as my operating system.\n\n59\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.940\nSimple contingent things.\n\n60\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.880\nIf you're accessing databases,\n\n61\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.920\nyou might not want those on the same\ndrive as your operating system drive.\n\n62\n00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.930\nHeck, If it's a high end server or\n\n63\n00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.880\na high end workstation, you might want\na separate drive just for your page file.\n\n64\n00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.800\nSo being able to add another drive,\nvery handy.\n\n65\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.520\n>> Very handy.\n\n66\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.850\nSo the way that we do that right\nbecause now that we're in Windows,\n\n67\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.890\nyou'd have to do kind of\nthe same things here.\n\n68\n00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.020\nWhich is one, on a physical machine I'd\nhave to turn everything off and then have\n\n69\n00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.360\nto go and put the hard drive in, attach\nthe cables, make sure we have power.\n\n70\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.690\nAnd we're ready to go.\n\n71\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.380\nWell the neat thing about VirtualBox\nis that, you can do that and sometimes,\n\n72\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.120\ndepending on the technology you choose,\nyou may not have to.\n\n73\n00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.850\nSo let me go ahead and minimize the actual\nvirtual machine for a moment, and\n\n74\n00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.500\nlet's see if I can bring up\nthat VirtualBox manager, right?\n\n75\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.680\nSo here it is, here's our VMM,\n\n76\n00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.840\nour VirtualBox manager, our monitor,\nI'm gonna say it wrong.\n\n77\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.090\nAnd, I want to actually add in\nan additional drive to this machine.\n\n78\n00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.900\nI can go up here and select the gear,\nand click on settings, and\n\n79\n00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.960\nthen go down to storage, and\nthis where we can actually start.\n\n80\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.710\nNow, you'll notice that this one does\nnot actually give me the ability to do\n\n81\n00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.910\nwhat I was saying, which is just\nto add in another drive live.\n\n82\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.540\nRight now and that's because we're\nactually using the Serial ATA controller.\n\n83\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.790\nIf it gave me the ability to do so, one of\nthese options would actually lit up but\n\n84\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.630\nthey're actually grayed out right now.\n\n85\n00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.120\nSo what's telling me is first,\nI need to actually\n\n86\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.870\nfollow the procedure I was telling you,\nwhich is to shut down this machine.\n\n87\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.190\nSo I am going to find my shut down here,\nI'm gonna right click,\n\n88\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.980\nno, maybe if I would do it\nwith a little more care,\n\n89\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.750\nby right clicking on the Windows button,\nthen I can select shutdown,\n\n90\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.090\nand now it's gonna tell us,\nit's gonna be a planned system here and\n\n91\n00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.070\nclick on Continue, and this machine\nwill shutdown relatively, quickly.\n\n92\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.520\nFrom here, I select the settings again.\n\n93\n00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.420\nAnd I go down here to storage, and\n\n94\n00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.710\nnow you can see where the controller's\nactually set here to Serial ATA.\n\n95\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.390\nNow it does, depending on the way that\nyou set this up at the beginning,\n\n96\n00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.680\nyou can actually change some of\nthese controller settings here and\n\n97\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.100\ngives you a different\ncontroller if you want to.\n\n98\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.420\nAnd to be able to add in more.\n\n99\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.610\nAnd so notice that we also have these\nbuttons out here to add in a new storage\n\n100\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.100\nattachment.\n\n101\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.540\nAnd also this one of course,\na new storage controller.\n\n102\n00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.650\nSo if I wanted to add in an additional\ncontroller, I could select that and\n\n103\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.850\nyou see a list.\n\n104\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.800\nIt gives me the ability,\nlet's say I that i wanted to actually say,\n\n105\n00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.580\nI had an old machine, Mike, that ran\nWindows XP and I need it as close as\n\n106\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.207\npossible to that machine, and that\nmachine was running an IDE hard drive.\n\n107\n00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:45.800\nWell, notice I can actually go and add\nin an IDE hard drive, now the advantage\n\n108\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.400\nof this is because there's no real old\ntechnology, it only emulates it, it\n\n109\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.480\ndoesn't emulate the speed which is great,\nit actually is very fast by comparison.\n\n110\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.260\nBut we can emulate that\nhardware in that way.\n\n111\n00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.370\nI can do another scuzzy controller,\nif I knew that I was actually trying to,\n\n112\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.600\nagain, do that where now that, whatever\nI'm actually running requires scuzzy,\n\n113\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.030\nwe can do that as well.\n\n114\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.130\nSerial attach scuzzy instead\nof using parallel technology.\n\n115\n00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.370\nAnd then USB controller for\na USB controller, a floppy, you name it.\n\n116\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.220\nThe default here is gonna be Serial ATA,\nis what it's gonna be.\n\n117\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.230\nAnd we're gonna leave it at\nit's default for right now.\n\n118\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.060\nAnd all I want to do is add\nin an additional drive, so\n\n119\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.140\nI don't need another controller.\n\n120\n00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.700\nAll I have to do is come up\nhere to the top and then,\n\n121\n00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.320\nI can actually select what I want.\n\n122\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.880\nDo I want to add in another\noptical drive or a hard drive?\n\n123\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.940\nI now click add a hard drive and then,\nI can either create a new one or\n\n124\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.050\nI can actually attach an existing one.\n\n125\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.050\nYou might wonder, like, why would I ever\nattach and existing VDI or VHD file.\n\n126\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.690\nWell what if you already backed up all\nof your data to one of these files, and\n\n127\n00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.240\nnow you wanted to attach it there.\n\n128\n00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.960\nIn other words, it's already preexisting.\n\n129\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.680\nYou wanna do that.\n\n130\n00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.580\nThis is a perfect opportunity for\nyou to do that and\n\n131\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.070\nbe able to access it inside your VM.\n\n132\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.330\n>> So just like with a physical machine,\nif I had a drive that I needed to move\n\n133\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.590\nfrom one server to another\nbecause they contained data.\n\n134\n00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.890\nMaybe I'm building up a new web server or\ndatabase server, something like that.\n\n135\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.120\nI can simply move,\nwe're not doing it physically,\n\n136\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.540\nwe're just going into the options here,\nand\n\n137\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.720\ndisconnecting it from one machine, and\nthen connecting it to another machine,\n\n138\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.480\nwhich would be just like\nmoving it in a physical world.\n\n139\n00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.290\n>> It really is.\n\n140\n00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.810\nAnd so we can do something like that.\n\n141\n00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.770\nAnd of course,\nwe can actually create a new one, and\n\n142\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.490\nthat's what we're gonna do right here.\n\n143\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.270\nSo, over here on the left hand side,\nI can select create a new disk and\n\n144\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.320\nthen I would choose the hard\ndrive disk file type that I want.\n\n145\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.596\nNow, this is probably not so\nimportant in what we're doing right now,\n\n146\n00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:41.405\nwhich is just to attach another drive.\n\n147\n00:07:41.405 --> 00:07:46.173\nBut if you do know that you might be\nactually using this disk to transfer,\n\n148\n00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:52.055\ndata from, let's say, this machine here,\nthat's, I've done inside a VirtualBox.\n\n149\n00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.755\nBut then, you might have a chance\nwhere you're saying, well,\n\n150\n00:07:54.755 --> 00:07:56.013\nsince I'm only moving data.\n\n151\n00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:58.683\nI might attach it to,\nlet's say, a Hyper-V machine.\n\n152\n00:07:58.683 --> 00:08:03.562\nYou might instead choose to actually\ndo it under the native file format for\n\n153\n00:08:03.562 --> 00:08:05.240\nHyper-V instead.\n\n154\n00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.880\nAnd that way you can go to Hyper-V and\nactually do the same thing and\n\n155\n00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.405\npull that in.\n\n156\n00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:12.220\nSays hey, I recognize that native drive,\nlet me go ahead and add that in there,\n\n157\n00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.540\nand it should work as well.\n\n158\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.132\n>> [CROSSTALK] So, Virtual Box actually\nsupports all the different formats for\n\n159\n00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:21.804\nthese virtual drives from all\nthe different applications.\n\n160\n00:08:21.804 --> 00:08:22.885\nFour of the big ones.\n\n161\n00:08:22.885 --> 00:08:26.700\nVMWare and Hyper-V and all of that.\n\n162\n00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.270\nFantastic.\n\n163\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.510\n>> It really does.\n\n164\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.290\nThen I can go ahead and click Next.\n\n165\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.750\nNow it's gonna ask what type that I want.\n\n166\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.890\nNow remember what we talked about\nthis in another episode I should say,\n\n167\n00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.690\nwe talk at when we would choose one or\nthe other.\n\n168\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.270\nThe basic idea, if you're in IT work and\nyou're not familiar with it, is simple.\n\n169\n00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.120\nIn a testing environment,\ndynamically allocated is perfectly fine.\n\n170\n00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.410\nThat's what I would choose each and every\nday, and I'm running a testing machine.\n\n171\n00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:57.270\nIn a production environment, my suggestion\nis to use this fixed sides instead.\n\n172\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.130\nAnd that will go ahead and\nallocate that space, and\n\n173\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.490\nthat space will not have to change.\n\n174\n00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.710\nAnd then that means VirtualBox\ndoesn't have to try and\n\n175\n00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.260\nfigure out where data's actually\ngoing to be located, as it grows, and\n\n176\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.590\nas it shrinks, and adds in more and more.\n\n177\n00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.980\nSo, I recommend that if you're gonna\ncreate an additional hard drive especially\n\n178\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.320\nfor the production network make sure\nyou do this one on a fixed size here.\n\n179\n00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.520\nNow, whatever that means.\n\n180\n00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.110\nIf you choose to create like a 200 gig\nhard drive, most of us go, 200 gigs?\n\n181\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.400\nThat's tiny.\n\n182\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.820\nWell, remember, that's what's\ngonna do is make a file that big.\n\n183\n00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.670\nAnd then it has to go through and\nformat that file.\n\n184\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.730\nIt can take a long time in doing that.\n\n185\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.230\nAnd 200 gigs, not so big.\n\n186\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.220\nBut I've seen it on like\nfour terrabyte drives.\n\n187\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.370\nIt can take days.\n\n188\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.450\nSo be careful.\n\n189\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.170\n>> So\nwith that dynamically expanding drive\n\n190\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.000\nI don't have to have all\nthe disk space available.\n\n191\n00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.210\nI can make a 250 gigabyte\ndrive even if I only have\n\n192\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.690\n50 gigabytes of available space, it's just\nnot gonna be able to grow to that max.\n\n193\n00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.940\nWhereas if I do a fixed, it's gotta\nclaim all that space when I make it.\n\n194\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.640\nSo I need that space available but\nas you said, an advantage is there\n\n195\n00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.700\nto not having the space and\nbeing able to make a drive that big.\n\n196\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.150\nDisadvantage performance with those\ndynamically expanding drives.\n\n197\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.040\nYou don't get the performance\nas much because sometimes it\n\n198\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.350\nhas to stop what it's doing,\nand expand that drive.\n\n199\n00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.990\nAnd if there's other files on\nthat hard drive in its way,\n\n200\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.520\nit now has to fragment and\nput it somewhere else on the drive.\n\n201\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.185\nSo, great for testing, not good for\nproduction environments.\n\n202\n00:10:22.185 --> 00:10:23.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n203\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.540\nthe other thing of course we\nneed to name that drive and\n\n204\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.520\nit's very important that you name a drive\nsomething that you're gonna recognize.\n\n205\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.990\nI know it always sounds good to just\nname it something like data, I named so\n\n206\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.069\nmany drives data, the problems is\ni've also so done it, multiple times.\n\n207\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.500\nAnd just even between machines,\nthen now all of a sudden I'm like \"Oh,\n\n208\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.700\nwhich drive did that actually belong to?\n\n209\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.980\nAnd which machine did that belong to?\n\n210\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.530\nSo always try to name it something\na little bit more descriptive.\n\n211\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.960\nAnd then you have the ability, of course,\nto put it where it actually belongs.\n\n212\n00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.370\nSo here it says Virtual Server 2012.\n\n213\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.800\nI'm gonna actually change\nthe location because I can and\n\n214\n00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.000\nI believe I've actually got,\noh maybe I didn't.\n\n215\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.160\nI thought I had changed the location.\n\n216\n00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.180\nI'm gonna leave it at the default then so\nI don't lose track of it.\n\n217\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.810\nWhat we normally wanna do of course,\nwe wanna keep all those drives together,\n\n218\n00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.940\njust organizationally right?\n\n219\n00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.310\nSo that way you're like, all right,\n\n220\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.180\nI know I moved this entire\nfolder that said Server 2012.\n\n221\n00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.770\nR2 and I have my VHDs in.\n\n222\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.550\nBut where's my second drive?\n\n223\n00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.630\nWhy didn't that move?\n\n224\n00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.650\nSo, just make sure you know where that's\ngonna be located is all I'm saying.\n\n225\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.770\n>> So, I like to name them whatever the\nname of the virtual machine is and then I\n\n226\n00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.610\ncan underscore zero for that first drive\nand underscore one for that second drive.\n\n227\n00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.520\nJust kinda gives me a way\nto keep track of them all.\n\n228\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.680\n>> It really does.\n\n229\n00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.290\nSo, there it is.\n\n230\n00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.920\nI've just went ahead and\n\n231\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.270\nclicked through the rest It's gonna\nmake a 25 gig hard drive for me.\n\n232\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.040\nAnd notice that it attached\nit to the controller,\n\n233\n00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.100\nthat's attached to that virtual machine.\n\n234\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.580\nNow there's still a couple selections\nyou want to be aware of though, okay?\n\n235\n00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.370\nSo now that this is on port number two,\nwhich is fine.\n\n236\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.580\nNotice it also gives me\nthe ability to say whether or\n\n237\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.330\nnot I am on a solid-state\ndrive physically.\n\n238\n00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.840\nNow that is important for us because if\nI'm actually running this on a solid state\n\n239\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.310\ndrive, it does treat it\na little bit differently.\n\n240\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.680\nIt actually allows it to do trim and\n\n241\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.890\nallows it to do a little bit of\naccess in different ways here.\n\n242\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.630\nSo that I know that I'm on solid state\ndrive, I wanna make sure that that's\n\n243\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:16.600\nalso checked, and physically and that way\nalso the Virtual Machine can see that.\n\n244\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.440\nAnd be able to go ok I know I need\nto treat this just a little bit\n\n245\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.660\ndifferently though.\n\n246\n00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.780\nAnd you can also make this hot pluggable.\n\n247\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.210\nNow on Serial ATA you can do that as long\nas it's not on the Operating System drive.\n\n248\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.790\nMake sure you remember that.\n\n249\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.170\nEverybody thinks oh Serial ATA\nit is hot pluggable.\n\n250\n00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:36.374\nYes you can actually a data disk off and\n[INAUDIBLE] put another one in place.\n\n251\n00:12:36.374 --> 00:12:37.938\nWithout actually turning off the power.\n\n252\n00:12:37.938 --> 00:12:40.724\nI've never seen people actually\nsay that's what I do all the time.\n\n253\n00:12:40.724 --> 00:12:42.764\nBut the technology does support it, but\n\n254\n00:12:42.764 --> 00:12:46.010\nnormally what we're gonna do is\nwe're going to leave it as is.\n\n255\n00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.600\nBut i'm gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n256\n00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.880\nFrom that point, what do I have to do?\n\n257\n00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.950\nNow, I just simply startup the machine.\n\n258\n00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.510\nAnd now when I startup the machine here,\nas everything turns back on.\n\n259\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.370\nNow what will happen of course is\nWindows will recognize the hardware.\n\n260\n00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.780\nIt will see that second drive there and\nready to go.\n\n261\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.190\nAnd then all we have to do is make\nsure that Windows can see that.\n\n262\n00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.260\nAnd that's just actually just going into\nDisk Manager and telling it to initialize\n\n263\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.930\nthe drive but let's see if it actually\nappears here as what we want.\n\n264\n00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.790\n>> So at this point here, it really just\nlike the physical environment right.\n\n265\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.146\nIf you shut a machine down and throw a new\ndrive in there and you boot it back up.\n\n266\n00:13:21.146 --> 00:13:25.555\nWell now you've gotta go let the operating\nsystem know that that drive is there.\n\n267\n00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:29.248\nAll right, so, have to go into\ncomputer management, initialize it,\n\n268\n00:13:29.248 --> 00:13:32.580\ncreate your volume, format it,\nall that good stuff.\n\n269\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.500\n>> Now,\nthat's exactly what we're gonna see here.\n\n270\n00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.220\nAt least, that's what we should see.\n\n271\n00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.020\nLet me put it that way.\n\n272\n00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.940\nThat's what we should end up seeing.\n\n273\n00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.060\nAnd I'm gonna give of the server\nmanager here just a moment.\n\n274\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.710\nIt tends to complain when you don't\nallow the server manager to finish\n\n275\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.260\n>> Yeah it does.\n\n276\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.450\n>> Doing all the stuff\nthat it wants to do here.\n\n277\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.110\nSo then I'm gonna close down\nthat server manager and\n\n278\n00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.650\ni'm gonna get into that computer manager.\n\n279\n00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.740\nOr at least I'm gonna try and\nget all that.\n\n280\n00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.520\nSee that's what it's complaining like\nI'm not ready to close out [LAUGH].\n\n281\n00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.540\nSo that's one of those features.\n\n282\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.760\nSo if I right-click on that Windows logo,\nand then I go and put on my glasses,\n\n283\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.170\nso I can actually read this list here-\n>> Disk Management.\n\n284\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.052\n>> Okay, yep.\n\n285\n00:14:10.052 --> 00:14:11.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n286\n00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.170\nthat's why the glasses work.\n\n287\n00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.965\nYou'll notice right here there is\na saying, initialize the disk.\n\n288\n00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:21.253\nAnd that's because it already sees that\nI have that basic disk in there and\n\n289\n00:14:21.253 --> 00:14:23.406\nnow it sees this unknown partition.\n\n290\n00:14:23.406 --> 00:14:27.080\nAnd is now saying, Windows sees a hard\ndrive but I don't know how to use it yet.\n\n291\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.160\nSo I'm gonna select that disk and\nI'm gonna leave it at the MBR.\n\n292\n00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.260\nYou can choose whatever you want to.\n\n293\n00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.779\nClick OK.\n\n294\n00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:37.138\nAnd now the disc is online but\nit's still not accessible.\n\n295\n00:14:37.138 --> 00:14:41.500\nIf it was accessible inside of my Windows\nexplorer I would see it right here but\n\n296\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.850\nto make it accessible.\n\n297\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.900\nI simply wanna right-click and\ncreate a new simple volume.\n\n298\n00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.110\nAnd then I'm gonna let it format the whole\nthing and leave the defaults here except\n\n299\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:56.865\nfor this one we'll call ITProTV data.\n\n300\n00:14:56.865 --> 00:14:59.150\nLets do that.\n\n301\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.978\nPerform a quick format.\n\n302\n00:14:59.978 --> 00:15:04.101\nCuz a full format, if you start making\nfull format on this it will take long time\n\n303\n00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:06.880\njust like it does on the physical drive.\n\n304\n00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.540\nNow notice that drive E is now available.\n\n305\n00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.800\nIf I go back to My Explorer.\n\n306\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.050\nThere it is.\nDrive E 25 gig hard drive ready to go.\n\n307\n00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.000\nSo, very easy to be able to\nattach additional storage.\n\n308\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.990\nAnd this is true whether you are creating\nan additional storage device.\n\n309\n00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.760\nOr whether you're\nactually bringing one in.\n\n310\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.320\nSo, if somebody says, hey, I need you to\nto attach this to that VM in VirtualBox.\n\n311\n00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.930\nWell, now you actually have an example.\n\n312\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.520\nYou simply bring that in.\n\n313\n00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.400\nYou go in to that controller and\nyou click on that plus sign for\n\n314\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.840\nhard disk, you say create, connect,\nor attach an existing one.\n\n315\n00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.897\nAnd simply follow\nthe instructions through.\n\n316\n00:15:41.897 --> 00:15:44.000\nShould come on through inside of your VM.\n\n317\n00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.555\nRemember you have to shut it down first,\nbut besides that though.\n\n318\n00:15:46.555 --> 00:15:49.122\nEverything looks good and ready to go.\n\n319\n00:15:49.122 --> 00:15:49.923\n>> Very good.\n\n320\n00:15:49.923 --> 00:15:53.000\nAll right Ronnie, now the next thing I\nthink we might wanna take a look at.\n\n321\n00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.860\nPerformance-wise for our VM.\n\n322\n00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.970\nWe chose a lot of the default options as\nwe went through, and created our first VM.\n\n323\n00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.260\nBut something actually might be easier\nin the virtual environment than it is in\n\n324\n00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.320\nthe physical one,\n\n325\n00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.040\nwe can actually affect the performance\nof our machine by changing that CPU.\n\n326\n00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.560\n>> You really can, and\nthe way that this really works, though,\n\n327\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.230\nis not when you have a single-core CPU.\n\n328\n00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.100\nAnd the good thing is,\n\n329\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.550\nin today's world, You shouldn't running on\na machine that has just a single core CPU.\n\n330\n00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.380\nSo, even though you have\na CPU on your motherboard,\n\n331\n00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.530\nit's also of course divided up inside of\nthe cores to allow us to actually have\n\n332\n00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.730\nmore power on a single\ndie is what it's done.\n\n333\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.580\nSo, when we are running\nsomething like that,\n\n334\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.290\nVirtualBox recognizes that as actually\nbeing a multiple core processor.\n\n335\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.930\nAnd what we can do is we can also send\nthat in to the initial environment there\n\n336\n00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:47.710\nso that applications that say I can take\nadvantage of multiple core processors\n\n337\n00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.730\nthat then, those applications will\nactually get that reported to them and\n\n338\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.430\nthey'll try to take advantage\nof that multiple core processor.\n\n339\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.070\nNow, let's go ahead and\n\n340\n00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.790\ntake a look at what I have showing\nup here on this machine so far.\n\n341\n00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:05.000\nSo, right now if I go into my system\nproperties here, you can see that\n\n342\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.200\nhere is the processor, this Intel Xeon and\nit's got this processor right here.\n\n343\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.410\nXeon is a multiple core\nprocessor at this point.\n\n344\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:18.030\nAnd so what I can do is I can\ntake advantage of that inside of\n\n345\n00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.810\nthe VM by actually saying hey,\nI need them to do that.\n\n346\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.300\nNow, if I right click and\n\n347\n00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.530\ngo to task manager,\nthis is where I want to take a look here.\n\n348\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:31.140\nAnd then go under more details and take\na look at the performance of that CPU.\n\n349\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.730\nAnd see, and it's actually only showing\nup as, it looks like one, yeah.\n\n350\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.970\nSo, there it is, it's actually\nshowing up as a single socket,\n\n351\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.490\nsingle virtual core processor,\nbut we can change that.\n\n352\n00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.140\nSo, let me go ahead and\nsee if I can do this live.\n\n353\n00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.510\nI'm gonna click on Machine and\ngo to Settings.\n\n354\n00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.330\nAnd it's, no, it's not right here,\n\n355\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.320\nI thought the settings\nwould do it right there.\n\n356\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.300\nLet me go ahead and shut this thing down.\n\n357\n00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.990\nEven though I think I'm gonna do this\nright but let me shut this down and\n\n358\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.430\nthat way we'll go to gain\naccess to all the menus.\n\n359\n00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.410\n>> And for the most part I find with most\nof these virtualization technologies,\n\n360\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.340\nRonnie that if you have to shut\nthe physical machine down to perform\n\n361\n00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.310\nan operation.\n\n362\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.900\nYou're going to have to shut the virtual\nmachine down to perform the operation\n\n363\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.700\nas well.\n\n364\n00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.200\nSo, like adding a new hard drive,\nadding ram, messing with the cpu\n\n365\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.970\nThose are the kinda things that you would\nnormally shut the physical machine down.\n\n366\n00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.300\nSo, you're also gonna be shutting\nthat virtual machine down.\n\n367\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.890\nChanging a network adapter\nfrom one cable to the other.\n\n368\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't shut the physical\n\n369\n00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:26.700\nmachine down.\n\n370\n00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.370\nYou probably don't have\nto shut the VM down.\n\n371\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.660\nSo something to keep in mind.\n\n372\n00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.520\n>> Right.\n\n373\n00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.100\nSo, here it is.\n\n374\n00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.290\nI went ahead and\nshut the actual virtual machine down.\n\n375\n00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.860\nAnd then I went to Settings and\nthen clicked on System.\n\n376\n00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.250\nAnd notice I can adjust settings here for\nthe motherboard the processor itself and\n\n377\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.670\nthat's the one we're taking a look at.\n\n378\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.090\nAnd there's that acceleration stuff that\nwe're talking about with the Intel VT.\n\n379\n00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.610\nIf you don't need that stuff\nyou can turn it off but\n\n380\n00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.060\nmost of us are going to leave it.\n\n381\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.130\nIf I want to adjust for\n\n382\n00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:56.210\nprocessor cores notice I actually\nhave the processor tab and\n\n383\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:02.120\nnow this one says I can go up to actually\nfour, without going in this red zone here.\n\n384\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.440\nSo, this means that more than likely that\nthis particular CPU is probably a quad\n\n385\n00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.220\ncore processor.\n\n386\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.640\nAnd it said look, I can really allow\nyou to adjust this up to four and\n\n387\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.420\nreport that to the machine itself.\n\n388\n00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.530\nAnd it gives us the ability to it really\ndoes it actually allows me to go up\n\n389\n00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.480\nto eight here.\n\n390\n00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.470\nBut notice it says, hey I invalid the so\n\n391\n00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.820\nthat's actually a a maximum limit\nof the virtual box right now.\n\n392\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.530\nAt least for\n\n393\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.890\nthis machine is that A core is that gonna\nbe the max of what it ends up seeing.\n\n394\n00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.680\nSo, if I wanted to I could say I need\na dual core processor or a triple core or\n\n395\n00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.440\neven all four cores to show up.\n\n396\n00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.491\nLet's go ahead and do all four.\n\n397\n00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:40.233\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Go all out.\n\n398\n00:19:40.233 --> 00:19:41.146\n>> We can do, yeah.\n\n399\n00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:44.478\nYeah so we can go all out here and\nbe able to do that.\n\n400\n00:19:44.478 --> 00:19:49.200\nNow, when you do something like this you\ndo have to be a little bit weary, okay?\n\n401\n00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.890\nSo, even if your virtual machine shows\nthat you can adjust it up to four cores\n\n402\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.360\nYou can actually end up in a performance\nbottle neck at the same time when you do\n\n403\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.630\nsomething like this.\n\n404\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.310\nRemember, this is a vitalized.\n\n405\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.060\nSo, that means even though it\ncan actually show four cores,\n\n406\n00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.380\nit doesn't always give\nyou the best performance.\n\n407\n00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.540\nDual core, when you need it., and\nthis is what you have to pay attention to.\n\n408\n00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.790\nIf your applications need\nmultiple core processors.\n\n409\n00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.430\nTo take advantage of it then use it.\n\n410\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.980\nBut if you have applications and\n\n411\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.810\nthe only thing they're saying is\nI need a single core processor.\n\n412\n00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.310\nI'm probably not gonna use a dual\ncore processor then turning it on\n\n413\n00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.170\nis really just gonna become\na performance hit for you.\n\n414\n00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.610\nSo, there are trade offs.\n\n415\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.090\nYou just have to actually determine what\napplications you're running whether or\n\n416\n00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.900\nnot you're gonna do this and\nwe're only doing this for\n\n417\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.900\ndisplay so I'm not gonna worry about.\n\n418\n00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.760\nThe other thing that you also have\nto adjust here Is what we call this\n\n419\n00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.500\nexecution cap.\n\n420\n00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.620\nThe execution cap is saying hey,\non each of those CPUs,\n\n421\n00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.520\nhow much of the virtual machine do you\nwant it to eat up on the processor?\n\n422\n00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.700\nSo, if you say 100%, it can lock up\nyour host machine because you're saying,\n\n423\n00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:58.690\nno, I can give up to 100% of\na core on this vm here so\n\n424\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.220\nit actually takes that away from your\nhost machine well you do that on all\n\n425\n00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.100\nfour course and I'm physically\nrunning four course well that can\n\n426\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.890\nalso be a hinderance as well were it locks\nit up too, so you do have to be careful.\n\n427\n00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.890\nThere is good documentation and theres a\nbit of art behind it, that's the only way\n\n428\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.220\nI can describe it right Not every\nsetting's gonna be perfectly the same,\n\n429\n00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.370\nif I set it and go Oh,\nI always run into that dual core!\n\n430\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.300\nAnd then you run it and like that's\nlike the slowest thing in the world!\n\n431\n00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.870\nYou turn it down to single core,\nit works perfectly fine.\n\n432\n00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:29.650\nSo, you do have to kind of pay\nattention to what you're doing there.\n\n433\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.250\n>> And you have to remember\nthese are shared resources, so\n\n434\n00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.130\nif you're running more than one VM\n>> You give\n\n435\n00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.950\none the ability to take\nover that entire CPU, your\n\n436\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.910\nother VMs are going to suffer performance\nwise as well as your physical machine.\n\n437\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.500\n>> That is true.\nYep, there's no doubt about that.\n\n438\n00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.820\nAll right.\nSo, lets go ahead and set that,\n\n439\n00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.090\nI'm not going to change any of\nthe other settings right now.\n\n440\n00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:46.950\nClick okay.\n\n441\n00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.730\nNow, lets turn the machine back on and\nlets see if the task manager\n\n442\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:55.510\nshows up as being multiple\ncords here when we take out.\n\n443\n00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.470\nSo, it should But sometimes,\n\n444\n00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.610\nyou know again I have to use\nthat cover word there should.\n\n445\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.240\nSo, once everything shows up\nremember that that means now\n\n446\n00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.600\nyour machine can take\nadvantage of those cores.\n\n447\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.140\nAnd the key there is\nthe applications that you run to\n\n448\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.240\nbe able to do something like this.\n\n449\n00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.480\nSo, you know,\nI don't know how else to stress that.\n\n450\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.670\nIf your machines don't really need it,\n\n451\n00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.730\nthen there's probably no real\ngood reason to turn it on.\n\n452\n00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.840\nIf all the applications you run\nare only gonna work with a single core,\n\n453\n00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.690\nit's probably perfectly fine that\nyou leave it at one instead.\n\n454\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.910\n>> I've noticed a little bit of\nan improvement, even just for\n\n455\n00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.470\nthe operating system itself,\ngiving it two cores.\n\n456\n00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:40.240\nAnd that's because what, well, that\noperating system normally can handle that,\n\n457\n00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.180\nand it normally does that, too.\n\n458\n00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.900\nBut most of the operating systems today,\nand they really do,\n\n459\n00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.810\nthey love those multiple core processors.\n\n460\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:52.790\nBut all the applications that you run,\nif you're only running Word or Excel and\n\n461\n00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.250\nit's only gonna take advantage of one,\nIs probably just gonna do that.\n\n462\n00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.440\nAll right, so let's take a look at our\nperformance there, and on this one it\n\n463\n00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.980\nonly shows one, but I'm wondering if it's\nbecause of some setting totalled up.\n\n464\n00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.940\nOh, there it goes, yeah, yeah,\n\n465\n00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.600\nI was gonna say I'm used to seeing that\ninside of the clients where you actually\n\n466\n00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.620\nsee the individual little CPUs there,\nso but you can see now it actually says\n\n467\n00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.320\nfour virtual processors instead of\nthe single one that we're seeing.\n\n468\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.740\nSo, now anything that's actually inside\nof my machine now can take advantage\n\n469\n00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.390\nof each one of those\nprocessors if we need to.\n\n470\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.220\n>> That's fantastic.\n\n471\n00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.620\nAnd Ronnie, I'm gonna guess that RAM\nis probably a very similar process.\n\n472\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.890\nWe know what RAM is,\nmy random access memory.\n\n473\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.770\nThe more the better,\nalmost always, with RAM, but\n\n474\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.740\nit is gonna be something you have\nto shut it down for it to adjust?\n\n475\n00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.092\n>> It is something you're gonna\nhave to actually shut it down for\n\n476\n00:23:38.092 --> 00:23:38.823\nto adjust as well.\n\n477\n00:23:38.823 --> 00:23:43.589\nI simply went back in system properties\nand showed here, here's the 2 gigs of RAM\n\n478\n00:23:43.589 --> 00:23:47.733\nand if I start realizing it's becoming\nsluggish, giving it more RAM is\n\n479\n00:23:47.733 --> 00:23:51.901\nabsolutely gonna make a machine\nperform better So, let me do the same.\n\n480\n00:23:51.901 --> 00:23:54.536\nI keep wanting to do the old way of-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n481\n00:23:54.536 --> 00:23:55.966\n>> Going out there and\n\n482\n00:23:55.966 --> 00:23:59.090\nshutting everything down to do this.\n\n483\n00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.930\nSo I'm gonna shut the machine down,\nand now it's telling me, there it is,\n\n484\n00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.380\nit doesn't like the way that\nI'm shutting stuff down.\n\n485\n00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:09.530\nIt gave me a memory fault error, which\nis fine, it's not a big deal right now.\n\n486\n00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.770\nAnd go back to Settings, and System.\n\n487\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.299\nAnd this one is that easy here,\nif I can actually, there it is.\n\n488\n00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:16.510\nI was gonna say, I'm looking for the RAM.\n\n489\n00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.250\nIt's right here, it's base memory.\n\n490\n00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:21.190\nSo it will actually allow\nyou to go up to this one.\n\n491\n00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:25.180\nIt looks like about 6 gigs, or\nabout 5.5 gigs, and a little bit more.\n\n492\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.210\nAnd so notice that this one actually has 3\ndifferent colors, a green, an orange, and\n\n493\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.290\na red?\n\n494\n00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:33.120\nIt doesn't want me to take up\nthe red because that's kind\n\n495\n00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.740\nof the memory that it's saving for the\nbase operating system, the host machine.\n\n496\n00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.190\nRight here,\nit's giving me the orange thing.\n\n497\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:43.590\nYou can use that if you want to, but\nthat's probably not a great idea.\n\n498\n00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:48.072\nBut I can also go in there and\nphysically adjust those to 4,096.\n\n499\n00:24:48.072 --> 00:24:49.810\nWell, maybe not.\n\n500\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.110\nMaybe I can't type, maybe that's my fault.\n\n501\n00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.240\n4,096, there we go.\n\n502\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:59.120\nFor 4 gigs of RAM and also we can change\nthe boot order unit, there are so\n\n503\n00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.542\nmany different things we can put in\nhere to make the machine speed up.\n\n504\n00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:07.745\nI'm gonna adjust the processor back down\ninstead to two cores here, and do that.\n\n505\n00:25:07.745 --> 00:25:13.550\nAnd then I simply restart and now we'll\ngive more RAM to that virtual machine.\n\n506\n00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.510\nAnd the limitation, right,\nis the physical RAM and that's the key.\n\n507\n00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.910\nSo Mike, if we have 16 gigs of RAM,\n\n508\n00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.590\neasy to assign 4 gigs to my 3\nvirtual machines, no big deal.\n\n509\n00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.780\nBut if I only have 4 gigs of RAM,\nassigning 3 gigs to that virtual machine\n\n510\n00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.980\nmay actually slow us down more than we\nrealize cuz we're only leaving 1 gig for\n\n511\n00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.080\nour host machine.\n\n512\n00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.010\n>> It's important to remember\nthat if the host slows down,\n\n513\n00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.410\nwe think well I'm not using the host,\nright?\n\n514\n00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.830\nI'm in the virtual machine so\nI don't care.\n\n515\n00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.730\nBut the host is what's\nrunning the virtual machines.\n\n516\n00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.440\nSo if you have three or\nfour virtual machines that are running and\n\n517\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.140\nthey're taking up all the memory.\n\n518\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.640\nAnd the host is short on resources,\n\n519\n00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.080\nwell every one of your virtual\nmachine's performance is gonna suffer.\n\n520\n00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.320\nSo you've gotta remember\nthis is shared resources.\n\n521\n00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.210\nThe host, as well as the VMs, need their\nlittle slice to make them run well, but\n\n522\n00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.510\nyou can't give them so\nmuch that the others suffer.\n\n523\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.460\n>> And\nthat is really difficult at times because\n\n524\n00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.500\nif you get a lot of virtual machines,\n\n525\n00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.520\nit's hard to remember sometimes what you\ndid assign to another virtual machine.\n\n526\n00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.966\nThen the neat thing is you can do over\nallocation as long as you're not running\n\n527\n00:26:17.966 --> 00:26:19.930\nall of them simultaneously.\n\n528\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:24.435\nSo if you do have 8 gigs, you can\nafford to assign this one 4 gigs and\n\n529\n00:26:24.435 --> 00:26:28.547\nassign another one 2 gigs to\nactually run as long as you don't\n\n530\n00:26:28.547 --> 00:26:33.243\nactually run them both at the same time,\nand jam up your host machine.\n\n531\n00:26:33.243 --> 00:26:36.340\nSo as long as you are only running one\nat a time, you can end up doing that.\n\n532\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.980\nAnd sometimes,\nthe virtual machine manager itself,\n\n533\n00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.670\ndepending on what you\nend up running there.\n\n534\n00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.870\nIt may tell you like, look, you're running\nmore than one virtual machine and so,\n\n535\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.510\nyou'll probably not want to do that.\n\n536\n00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:52.830\nBut you can see there's 4 gigs of RAM for\nus, right there and ready to go.\n\n537\n00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.630\n>> So Ronnie, I guess the next thing we'd\nwant to do, we've made sure that we've got\n\n538\n00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.930\nenough processing power,\nwe've got enough memory, we've got enough\n\n539\n00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.570\nhard drive space to install and\ndo all the things we need to do.\n\n540\n00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.240\nNext thing I need to do is\nconnect it to the network, right.\n\n541\n00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.500\nIf I'm gonna put it in my environment,\nit's gotta connect to other machines.\n\n542\n00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.360\nPeople might need to connect to it.\n\n543\n00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.340\nSo I guess that would be our next step?\n\n544\n00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.510\n>> It really is, right.\n\n545\n00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:17.220\nNetworking is one of the features\nthat has actually continued to\n\n546\n00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.120\nactually become more enhanced and\nbetter each and\n\n547\n00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.110\nevery iteration of a virtual\nmachine technology, as well.\n\n548\n00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.650\nAnd the problem that we have here is\nthat there's a lot of different options.\n\n549\n00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.481\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n550\n00:27:28.481 --> 00:27:31.307\nIf I click on Machines and Settings here,\n\n551\n00:27:31.307 --> 00:27:36.635\nI can go down to where it says Networking\nand right away, inside a virtual box,\n\n552\n00:27:36.635 --> 00:27:42.850\nit actually gives you the ability to have\nup to, by default, four network adapters.\n\n553\n00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:46.229\nNow it's on a virtual box though, if you\nare willing to configure the command line,\n\n554\n00:27:46.229 --> 00:27:48.900\nyou can actually put up to eight\nnetwork adapters in there.\n\n555\n00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.682\nIt only allows you the other four if\nyou actually do it by the command\n\n556\n00:27:51.682 --> 00:27:52.350\nline, though.\n\n557\n00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.190\nNow I've never had a machine\nwhere I've needed eight, but\n\n558\n00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.840\nI can see the use of them,\nespecially if you're gonna\n\n559\n00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.950\nbe attaching something like a SAN at\nsome point where you actually need that.\n\n560\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.620\nBut overall though,\nit starts off with one, right.\n\n561\n00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.530\nSo when we do the basic configuration and\nwe do the install, it says,\n\n562\n00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.590\nhey, how do you want to connect and we'll\njust start off with one for right now.\n\n563\n00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.830\nIf you wanna add in another one,\nyou have to shut the machine down.\n\n564\n00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:15.890\nAnd then you can actually go ahead and\nyou just simply put another check box on\n\n565\n00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.540\nadapter number two when it's all\nshutdown and you're ready to go.\n\n566\n00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.520\nBut we need to take look at\nthese options just briefly.\n\n567\n00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.514\nNAT is, of course,\n\n568\n00:28:23.514 --> 00:28:27.450\nmeaning that it actually runs its\nown network address translation.\n\n569\n00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.130\nAnd what that actually says is that\nyour VM is on its own network.\n\n570\n00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.120\nAnd then your host machine\nessentially is another network.\n\n571\n00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.800\nSo it's kinda strange but\nthat's what happens.\n\n572\n00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.120\nBut because you're actually using\nnetwork address translation,\n\n573\n00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.438\nit's taking your machine,\ntranslating the address into, well,\n\n574\n00:28:44.438 --> 00:28:47.655\nyour host network there, and\nthen it can get out to the Internet.\n\n575\n00:28:47.655 --> 00:28:50.200\nAnd that's exactly what's\nhappening on this one right here.\n\n576\n00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.950\n>> And that's very advantageous.\n\n577\n00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.880\nI've got a lab environment I'm setting up,\nand I wanna duplicate a particular\n\n578\n00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.430\naddress range or something like that,\nmy laptop's not part of that network.\n\n579\n00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:02.920\nSo I can isolate it.\n\n580\n00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.830\nIt can still use that\nparticular address range, and\n\n581\n00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.740\nnot interfere with my production network,\nright?\n\n582\n00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.870\nBecause those IP addresses\nare gonna get translated\n\n583\n00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.050\nas they go out to the host machine and\non of the physical network.\n\n584\n00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:19.110\nSo it allows me to do any IP address\nrange within my virtual environment and\n\n585\n00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.640\nnot interfere with the physical network.\n\n586\n00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.420\n>> It really is, and\nthis is the default, right,\n\n587\n00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.460\nbecause most people that just\nwanna bring up a virtual machine,\n\n588\n00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.070\nget connected to the Internet,\nperfectly fine, works very well.\n\n589\n00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.900\nThis is the slowest network\nadapter that we have, though,\n\n590\n00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.890\nbecause it normally does\nwhat we call double NATing.\n\n591\n00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.520\nAnd that's just the way it is, right.\n\n592\n00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.700\nIf it gets translated one time\ninto the network that I'm on,\n\n593\n00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.900\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n594\n00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.570\nTo get connected out to the Internet,\nit has to go through NAT again,\n\n595\n00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.640\nand that means a translation\ncoming back also is done twice.\n\n596\n00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.702\n>> Cuz your physical machine is\nconnected to our private network here,\n\n597\n00:29:48.702 --> 00:29:50.810\nwhich is NATed on the way\nout to the Internet, so\n\n598\n00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.948\nyou are going through a NAT twice on\nthe way out, twice on the way back.\n\n599\n00:29:53.948 --> 00:29:57.960\n>> And so a lot of extra overhead there,\nbut it's the easiest default.\n\n600\n00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.660\nAnd normally, when I create one, I leave\nit at this unless I have a good reason not\n\n601\n00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.210\nto, because it gives me that ability to\ngo out and get updates from the Internet.\n\n602\n00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:10.110\nAnd I'm not worried about speed so\nmuch at this point, but you have that.\n\n603\n00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.290\nNow they also, of course,\n\n604\n00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.850\nhave what they call Nat Network,\nthat one is experimental.\n\n605\n00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:16.780\nIf you wanted to literally\nmanually create your\n\n606\n00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.510\nown Nat Network to do something special\nwith it, then it gives you that.\n\n607\n00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.738\nBut that one, they call it experimental so\nwe're not going to worry about it.\n\n608\n00:30:23.738 --> 00:30:28.420\nBridge network adapter, if you wanted your\nvirtual machine to have an IP address\n\n609\n00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.710\non the network that you're on.\n\n610\n00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.970\nSo Mike, right now, on ITProTV network,\nif I wanna take this and say, hey, I wanna\n\n611\n00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:38.620\nactually give it an IP address from the\nITProTV network, I simply turn on bridge.\n\n612\n00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.110\nAnd it actually allows this\nmachine to connect out and\n\n613\n00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.940\nget a DHCP address, ready to go.\n\n614\n00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.930\n>> So it would behave just like a physical\nmachine that I plugged into the one of\n\n615\n00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.750\nports on the wall,\nit would look like another machine to\n\n616\n00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.090\nall the other machines that\nare already on that network.\n\n617\n00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.650\nIt would have access to the network\njust like anybody else.\n\n618\n00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:57.650\n>> Yeah, and\nthis is nice if you really do need that.\n\n619\n00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:01.290\nBut you do wanna be careful because\nthat means anybody else can also\n\n620\n00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.680\nreach that machine too.\n\n621\n00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.239\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n622\n00:31:03.239 --> 00:31:06.661\n>> And if you're not monitoring, if you're\nnot being careful with it, that means this\n\n623\n00:31:06.661 --> 00:31:09.846\nmachine can be attacked very easily from\nsomeone else sitting on your network,\n\n624\n00:31:09.846 --> 00:31:10.860\nso you gotta be careful.\n\n625\n00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.550\nYou still gotta monitor all of them,\nso now that you go, oh no,\n\n626\n00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:14.720\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n627\n00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.200\nIt's NATed behind this and doing all that.\n\n628\n00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.440\nAnd even though that's not\na super security feature,\n\n629\n00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.770\nit is something that really does\noffer a little bit of protection.\n\n630\n00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.960\nInternal means you're cutting it off\nfrom the rest of the world, right?\n\n631\n00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.270\nWhat you can do there is you can\ncreate your own internal network.\n\n632\n00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.340\nIt's like plugging into its own switch.\n\n633\n00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.480\nLike if I had mine, this virtual machine,\nand Mike had one working.\n\n634\n00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.860\nActually, I shouldn't say Mike.\n\n635\n00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.670\nIf I had three or four on my own machine,\n\n636\n00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.950\nI should say, then I can actually\nconnect them to that internal network.\n\n637\n00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:43.248\nAnd I can name it whatever I want to and\nthat's like me actually taking a little\n\n638\n00:31:43.248 --> 00:31:46.618\nfive port switch and just plugging each\none of those virtual machines into it.\n\n639\n00:31:46.618 --> 00:31:49.743\nWithout any other Internet connection,\nit's not gonna go anywhere else.\n\n640\n00:31:49.743 --> 00:31:51.617\n>> I love that option,\nthat's what I use for\n\n641\n00:31:51.617 --> 00:31:54.940\nall my little sandbox environments cuz\nall Whip up three or four servers,\n\n642\n00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.905\ncreate a little domain real quick,\nI need to test something out.\n\n643\n00:31:57.905 --> 00:32:00.020\nI don't need to worry\nabout Windows updates,\n\n644\n00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.170\nI'm not running antivirus software.\n\n645\n00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.860\nI don't want them reaching out, but\nthey need to talk to each other.\n\n646\n00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.400\nSo I can put them on\nthat internal network,\n\n647\n00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.730\nall those virtual machines\ncan talk to each other, and\n\n648\n00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.060\nI have no fear of them reaching out and\nmessing with my physical network.\n\n649\n00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.440\nOr anybody on my physical network\ncoming in and messing with them.\n\n650\n00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.000\n>> And then one of the other options that\nwe have here, of course is the host only.\n\n651\n00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.500\nAnd this really creates a network between\nyou or your host, excuse me and of\n\n652\n00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.120\ncourse your virtual machine that they're\nactually on that same network together.\n\n653\n00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.900\nBy default, remember NATs actually\nput itself on a different network.\n\n654\n00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.650\nThis one's put itself on the same network.\n\n655\n00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.480\nAnd you might be wondering\nwhat's the big difference here?\n\n656\n00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.791\nIt's the way that it actually\ngoes through doing this.\n\n657\n00:32:35.791 --> 00:32:42.990\nWell there's other things like\nthe bridge adapter especially, right?\n\n658\n00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.600\nWhat it does is it creates\na loopback adapter,\n\n659\n00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.910\na virtual network adapter\non your host machine.\n\n660\n00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:50.430\nAnd that's how it actually\ndoes that communication,\n\n661\n00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.720\ngetting assigned another IP address there.\n\n662\n00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.950\nWith the host only though, what it's doing\nis sharing your physical network adapter\n\n663\n00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:01.510\nitself so it can communicate between\nthe host and the virtual machine instead.\n\n664\n00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:04.210\nAnd you might be wondering why, what's\nthe big deal with then with bridge and\n\n665\n00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.100\nhost only?\n\n666\n00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.840\nThe nice thing is, if you actually\nlike doing network monitoring right,\n\n667\n00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.605\nusing something like wire shark.\n\n668\n00:33:10.605 --> 00:33:12.288\nI can't recall what the name\nof that program is.\n\n669\n00:33:12.288 --> 00:33:15.490\nIf you wanna do that,\nyou can then actually go ahead and\n\n670\n00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.880\nsay hey, I wanna run that, I wanna run\nthat off of that loopback adapter and\n\n671\n00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.940\nyou can see that the traffic\ngoing across it.\n\n672\n00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.470\nYou can do the same thing with the host\nonly if you think something else is going\n\n673\n00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.350\non there and be able to monitor that.\n\n674\n00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:26.234\nWith the NAT you can't.\n\n675\n00:33:26.234 --> 00:33:29.767\nYou can't do any of that, so even though\nit's actually cool you'd actually have to\n\n676\n00:33:29.767 --> 00:33:30.930\ndo one of those two things.\n\n677\n00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.210\nSo it gives you that ability to\nactually monitor real network traffic\n\n678\n00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.090\nby using one of those two options.\n\n679\n00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.730\nNow the last one there is generic driver.\n\n680\n00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.700\nThis is if the network adapter is so\n\n681\n00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.820\nold on your machine that\nyou can't do anything else.\n\n682\n00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.170\nThis is what you would actually choose\nto do instead to make a representation\n\n683\n00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.330\nof some type of network\nadapter that's out there.\n\n684\n00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.370\nHopefully you're not having\nvirtual machine use that.\n\n685\n00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.220\nThey really don't recommend\nyou use it at all.\n\n686\n00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.140\nSo those are your choices, and\nnormally once you actually choose that,\n\n687\n00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.660\nall you have to do is make sure that\nyou select this cable connected, and\n\n688\n00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.890\nthen it should work for you.\n\n689\n00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:02.801\nYou still have to actually understand\nthe basic principles of networking, okay,\n\n690\n00:34:02.801 --> 00:34:03.559\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n691\n00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:07.043\nYou still have to know and understand IP\naddresses, subnet masks, default gateway,\n\n692\n00:34:07.043 --> 00:34:08.100\nstuff like that.\n\n693\n00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.120\nBut that is actually\nnot the virtualization.\n\n694\n00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.120\nThat's you being a better IT\ntechnician is that what actually is.\n\n695\n00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.882\nSo yeah, there's a lot more to this.\n\n696\n00:34:16.882 --> 00:34:19.178\nAnd then Mike,\nit looks like I talked a lot again.\n\n697\n00:34:19.178 --> 00:34:20.896\n[LAUGH]\n>> I loved every minute of it though.\n\n698\n00:34:20.896 --> 00:34:22.394\nYou had me hanging on the edge of my seat.\n\n699\n00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:25.772\nAnd hey, if you need help with those\nnetworking skills, we've got episodes for\n\n700\n00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:28.320\nthose in the library as well so\nmake sure you check those out.\n\n701\n00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.610\nBut, yes, Ronnie, we are running out\nof time, but that was a great episode\n\n702\n00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.280\nwe got to see some of those\nadvanced configurations we can do.\n\n703\n00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.200\nWe got the machine up and\n\n704\n00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.770\nrunning, now how do I get it set\nup to perform the way I need?\n\n705\n00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.980\nAdd that extra storage if I need it?\n\n706\n00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.310\nNow we know how, I feel like we're on our\nway to setting up our little sandbox.\n\n707\n00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.980\nGreat stuff, but\nwe are out of time for this one.\n\n708\n00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.980\nBut we got more coming your way,\nso stay tuned for more episodes.\n\n709\n00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.300\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick\n\n710\n00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.050\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n711\n00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:56.293\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n712\n00:34:56.293 --> 00:35:02.660\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.500\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.170\nAnd today we're looking at\nvirtualization technologies.\n\n5\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.950\nAnd in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.500\nwe're going to be continuing our\nexploration of some of the advance\n\n7\n00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.560\nconfiguration options we have with\nthe virtual machine within Virtual Box.\n\n8\n00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.690\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Mr Ronnie Long.\n\n9\n00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.450\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.490\n>> It is going great.\n\n11\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.670\nThere are a few extra features\nthat we need to pay attention to,\n\n12\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.350\nas we continue to work with Virtual Box.\n\n13\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.780\nAnd that is because it's not enough just\nto get an operating system installed.\n\n14\n00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.040\nWe have to be able to configure it.\n\n15\n00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.830\nIt has to be able to do\nthe things that we want it to do.\n\n16\n00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.500\nSo in the previous episode,\n\n17\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.070\nwe had taken a look at how we can adjust\nRAM, how we can add in additional drives.\n\n18\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.800\nWe can even adjust the virtual core CPUs,\nand make it see what it can see.\n\n19\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.450\nAnd so\nthere's a lot of different configurations.\n\n20\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.820\nAnd I forgot we even talked\nabout networking with it and\n\n21\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.860\nchoosing the right type of networking.\n\n22\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.620\nSo, that it actually fits\nthe needs that we have.\n\n23\n00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.800\nThere are a few other options\nthat we need to take care of and\n\n24\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.140\none of the easiest things right away and\none of the most frustrating things that I\n\n25\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.700\nhave when I first started out was now\nthat I have my virtual machine up and\n\n26\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.120\ngoing I am now ready to\ninstall applications, Mike.\n\n27\n00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.940\nWhen I talk about installing applications,\na lot of them were applications that\n\n28\n00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.680\nI already had inside of\na folder on my host machine.\n\n29\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.080\nThen, now I have my VM,\nand I'm like, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.780\nSo, now I need to move files.\n\n31\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.750\n>> Can't you just drag and\n\n32\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.450\ndrop it from your host machine\nonto that virtual machine?\n\n33\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.350\n>> Well, believe it or not,\na lot of the newer ones you can't,\n\n34\n00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.380\nespecially when you add in those\nvirtual machine additions.\n\n35\n00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.800\nYou can actually do that.\n\n36\n00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.790\nBut sometimes they don't work as\nwell as you think that they are.\n\n37\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.100\nAnd it's not because they're not trying,\nright.\n\n38\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.760\nIt's just because the technology is\nnot really caught up in the way that\n\n39\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.290\nthings actually do work and\nmove a lot of times.\n\n40\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.690\nAnd so it seems to be more of a,\nwe'll get to it when we get to it.\n\n41\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.058\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] If they do.\n\n42\n00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:02.688\nAnd it's also a security thing, right?\n\n43\n00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:05.369\nI mean, you can't just drag things\nfrom one desktop to another.\n\n44\n00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.052\nIt's a machine.\n\n45\n00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:07.290\nIt's on the network.\n\n46\n00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.340\nAnd you're gonna have to follow the same\nthings if you wanna make a file available\n\n47\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.430\nfrom one machine to another on\nthe network, what do you do?\n\n48\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.330\nYou share folder.\n\n49\n00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.840\nRight.\n\n50\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.520\nAnd that's really what we're gonna do\nhere with our virtual machines as well.\n\n51\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.480\n>> It really is.\n\n52\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.570\nSo, we of course can't access network\nshares over the network as long as we\n\n53\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.170\nhave the proper network adapter created\nand everything as you can see each other.\n\n54\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.360\nBut if I just need to do it between\nmy host machine and, of course,\n\n55\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.900\nmy VM,\nwell that one we can do a network share.\n\n56\n00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.630\nWe can actually create that thing,\nand that's really what's gonna end up\n\n57\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.400\nhappening but we're actually using Virtual\nBoxes internal technology to do it.\n\n58\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.560\nAnd it actually does work out to be\nthe regular and same way as now working.\n\n59\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.480\nBut it actually becomes a little bit\neasier cause we get the graphical user\n\n60\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.530\ninterface to help us.\n\n61\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.080\n>> Nice.\nYes.\n\n62\n00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.530\nSo, this virtualization technology,\n\n63\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.930\nVirtual Box can has\na built-in shared feature.\n\n64\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.810\nIt knows that most likely, you're gonna\nwanna get some of your files off your\n\n65\n00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.500\nphysical host on these virtual machines.\n\n66\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.390\nAnd rather than have to,\nput on the same network,\n\n67\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.500\nmake sure they can see each other.\n\n68\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.410\nGo through all the formal process\nof creating a network share\n\n69\n00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.480\nwhich exposes it everybody\non the network and\n\n70\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.430\nthen you gotta worry about your\npermissions and things like that.\n\n71\n00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.070\nVirtual Box has an internal feature\nthat says, Hey I'll go ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.780\ncreate folder just that you can\nuse to share between that host and\n\n73\n00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.750\nthose virtual machines\n>> And the nice thing is in your VM,\n\n74\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.150\nit does end up looking like an actual\nnetwork share that you access and so\n\n75\n00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.180\nit really does look like hey, I did all\nthe formal creation that I needed to, but\n\n76\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.730\nis virtual box doing for us.\n\n77\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.740\nWell, let's go and show you how to\ncreate something like that as well.\n\n78\n00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.230\nSo when we take a look inside\nof our virtual box machine,\n\n79\n00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.490\nhere's the one that we created.\n\n80\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.120\nWhat I wanna take a look at is\nin the lower right hand corner.\n\n81\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.010\nSo, if we full screen this,\nwe'll be able to see some of the icons\n\n82\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.900\nthat are actually down here in our\nlower right hand corner of the screen.\n\n83\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.030\nAnd you'll see that outside of\nthe edge of Windows Server 2012.\n\n84\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.440\nI see some different icons.\n\n85\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.320\nThere's a hover over them.\n\n86\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.900\nThey tell me a lot about\nthe machine itself.\n\n87\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.910\nThere's my ETA.\n\n88\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.600\nThere's my virtual CD driver.\n\n89\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.430\nHere, of course,\nis my network adapter and the cable.\n\n90\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.378\nAnd this is USB.\n\n91\n00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:09.660\nIf I right-click on each of these,\nof course, I can affect that.\n\n92\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.600\nThe one that I'm looking at actually\nlooks grayed out which is the one\n\n93\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.830\nthat says Shared Folder.\n\n94\n00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.570\nAnd it says, indicates the activity\nof this machine's Shared Folder.\n\n95\n00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.750\nAnd right now there is no shared folder.\n\n96\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.900\nAnd there are a few\nother options over here.\n\n97\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.710\nVideo Memory,\nVideo Capture is currently disabled.\n\n98\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.540\nThe actual Intel VT, some of these other\nfiles that we've actually seen listed.\n\n99\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.440\nBut if I right-click\nover to that gray one.\n\n100\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.630\nI can actually see were it\nsays Shared Folder Settings.\n\n101\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.010\nAnd then I can select that.\n\n102\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.380\nAnd that brings me up inside\nof my preferences right here.\n\n103\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.750\nNow, I like using that because I'm\ngenerally right-clicker type of guy\n\n104\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.950\nthat I actually know exactly where it is.\n\n105\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.760\nIf you go, man, [INAUDIBLE] that.\n\n106\n00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.640\nIf you go up to File and Preferences,\nit will bring you to the same place.\n\n107\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.030\nAnd then, from here.\n\n108\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.740\nWell, I wanna do.\n\n109\n00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.950\nI thought it was actually right there.\n\n110\n00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.100\nI thought it was actually in the\npreferences or let me show you again okay?\n\n111\n00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.860\nOh, it's actually in\nthe actual other settings.\n\n112\n00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.730\nMy fault I'm just cheating settings\nlike okay, I am lying to you.\n\n113\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.570\nThere you go.\n\n114\n00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.300\nSo from right here you can see\nwhere it says Shared Folders and\n\n115\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.490\nhere's the two things that you have to\nkind of be able to distinguish between.\n\n116\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.290\nThe good thing is that inside of\nVirtual Box, if you hover over anything,\n\n117\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.670\nthey've been really gracious at\nall of the extra documentation.\n\n118\n00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.640\nSo, they give you a nice screen tip that\nsays, hey, here's what you actually see\n\n119\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.950\nright here and how you actually\nwould get access to these.\n\n120\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.960\nMost of them are things that\nwe call machine folders and\n\n121\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.020\nalso transient folders as well.\n\n122\n00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.440\nMachine folders are the same as what\nwe would consider persistent folders.\n\n123\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.190\nAnd what that means of course is that,\nwhen the machine boots up,\n\n124\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.210\nit automatically connects that network\nshare and then we will have access to it.\n\n125\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.670\nThe idea of the transient folder is\nthe same as somebody logging on and\n\n126\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.850\nhaving created that map network drive.\n\n127\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.870\nWhere it only actually appears\nwhen that person logs on.\n\n128\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.850\nSo if you had multiple logging into this\nmachine well it might actually appear for\n\n129\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.970\nMike, but it might not appear for me.\n\n130\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.910\nSo you can do stuff like that\ndepending on what you need.\n\n131\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.560\nSo if I wanted to make this available and\nI select machine folders notice that I\n\n132\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.800\nhave this little plus sign over on\nthe right hand side that allows me to add\n\n133\n00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.680\na new share, and then from this point,\nI can actually choose the folder path.\n\n134\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.660\nNow, what is that folder path about?\n\n135\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.560\nThe folder path is actually saying go and\n\n136\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.950\nfind the folder that you\nactually want to list right here.\n\n137\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.590\nSo I can click on the drop down and\nthen select Other.\n\n138\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.200\nAnd when I select Other, it is now\ntaking a look at my physical machine,\n\n139\n00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.800\nmy host machine.\n\n140\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.320\nAnd it's from in here I can now browse,\nand\n\n141\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.240\ntake a look inside of the folders, and\nthen I can choose the folder that I want\n\n142\n00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.830\nto go ahead and create a link to,\nor that's shared to.\n\n143\n00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.870\nI'm gonna select this one,\nthe one that I created in the background.\n\n144\n00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.030\nI didn't share this folder\nout on my host machine.\n\n145\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.840\nI simply selected the folder, and\nthen right here I select the folder again.\n\n146\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.840\nI made the folder.\n\n147\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.370\nAnd then I actually select it here.\n\n148\n00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.840\nI click OK, and now I have of\ncourse these three options right?\n\n149\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.420\nI have the ability to do read only.\n\n150\n00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.210\nIf I want to be able to share this out so\n\n151\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.440\nthey can not modify anything inside\nof that folder, perfectly fine.\n\n152\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.670\nI can do the Auto-mount, which is probably\nsomething that's actually very good, and\n\n153\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.800\nthen make permanent if we want to as well.\n\n154\n00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.150\nSo you want it to actually be there all\nthe time, automatically, there you go.\n\n155\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.320\nAnd then make sure it's\nactually permanently there,\n\n156\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.790\nyou can do that as well.\n\n157\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.790\nSo most of those options\nare pretty good for me.\n\n158\n00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.740\nI can click OK, and\nnow it allows me to do that.\n\n159\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.545\nNotice the full access\nwhich means full control.\n\n160\n00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:40.830\nAuto-Mount, yes.\n\n161\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.530\nIt's gonna automatically do\nthis when the machine boots up.\n\n162\n00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.360\nAnd you are ready to go.\n\n163\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.890\nAnd because it's the Machine folder.\n\n164\n00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.840\nIt is.\nRegardless of whoever logs in,\n\n165\n00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.590\nit's gonna actually be there as well.\n\n166\n00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.830\nAnd then I click OK.\n\n167\n00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.760\nNow once I do that, it doesn't look\nlike anything's changed, Mike.\n\n168\n00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.160\nSo big deal.\n\n169\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.925\n>> I guess it didn't work.\n\n170\n00:07:57.925 --> 00:07:59.557\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm thinking we should go check\n\n171\n00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:00.776\nout File Explorer and see what shows up.\n\n172\n00:08:00.776 --> 00:08:05.057\n>> Yeah, if we go ahead and\ncheck out File Explorer at this point, and\n\n173\n00:08:05.057 --> 00:08:10.192\nthen I click on Network here, Notice\nthat it's actually showing V box server.\n\n174\n00:08:10.192 --> 00:08:15.710\nAnd this isn't the UMC path name that's\nalready given to that connection instead.\n\n175\n00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.990\nIf I select that and there it is.\n\n176\n00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.370\nThere is my V box server lab at ITProTV.\n\n177\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.090\nAnd that folder is now empty.\n\n178\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.950\nIf I right-click and I go to New.\n\n179\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.396\nAnd we're just gonna create\na fake document here, maybe.\n\n180\n00:08:27.396 --> 00:08:29.120\nI thought I was.\n\n181\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.820\nLet's try it again.\n\n182\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.214\nThere we go, rich text document,\nand this is gonna be ITProTV.\n\n183\n00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:38.640\nRight there.\n\n184\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.100\nSo there's a document that\nI've now put into that folder.\n\n185\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.874\nNow, if I minimize this, and I go and\nfind that photo on my host machine.\n\n186\n00:08:47.874 --> 00:08:50.393\nAnd see I can that I find it here.\n\n187\n00:08:50.393 --> 00:08:52.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There it is so\n\n188\n00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.728\nI actually did create a new text\ndocument for one reason or another,\n\n189\n00:08:55.728 --> 00:08:59.045\nI didn't see it on the other one, but\nthere it is there is the ITProTV.\n\n190\n00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:01.504\n>> All right.\n>> So I can go ahead and do that and\n\n191\n00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:07.920\nshare that between and the same thing on\nthis and let me get back into that folder.\n\n192\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.860\nI hid it from myself, I didn't mean to.\n\n193\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:16.060\nI was thinking too fast, or thinking too\nslow and working too fast I guess is.\n\n194\n00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.740\nSo let me add in a bitmap image and\nsay this is a picture of Mike right there.\n\n195\n00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.240\n>> Oh no.\n\n196\n00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.220\n>> And\nthen I go back into my Virtual Machine.\n\n197\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.780\nWe find that same network\nlocation folder here.\n\n198\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.691\nLet it refresh a little bit.\n\n199\n00:09:29.691 --> 00:09:30.829\nAnd there it is.\n\n200\n00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:35.040\nSo, we can actually now share\nfiles between those machines.\n\n201\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.300\nAnd that really makes it easy.\n\n202\n00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.230\nIt really is a great thing to have.\n\n203\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.090\n>> Extremely handy.\n\n204\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.400\nAs I said I use this for a lot of\nsandbox test environment type things.\n\n205\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.790\nAnd there's times, I download something.\n\n206\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.650\nI wanna install it in this VM but, again I\ndon't want to give my VMs Internet access.\n\n207\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.970\nBecause I don't patch them,\nI don't run anti virus.\n\n208\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.090\nIt's a sandbox.\n\n209\n00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.990\nSo I can simply download it to my host\nmachine, dump it in that shared folder,\n\n210\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.300\ngo log into my VM and there it is.\n\n211\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.350\nAnd I don't have to worry about going\nthrough all that other trouble.\n\n212\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.770\nSo, extremely handy.\n\n213\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.010\nAll right, Ronnie, so\nwe've got these shared folders.\n\n214\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.680\nWhat else do you have for us?\n\n215\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.530\n>> Yeah, Mike.\nWhat we also have the ability to do\n\n216\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.200\nis what we call snapshots.\n\n217\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.380\nNow, what in the world\nare snapshots about?\n\n218\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.360\nWhen we start taking a look at this, we\ncan actually build our virtual machine up\n\n219\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.700\nto a point and go, I wanna make sure that\nany changes that I have up at this point,\n\n220\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.950\nI'm gonna make sure I can come back to.\n\n221\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.190\nSo snapshots really give us that ability\nto take a picture of the machine in\n\n222\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.710\nthe state that it's in.\n\n223\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.730\nAnd then anything that I actually\nhave changing up at that point,\n\n224\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.780\ndon't get me wrong those changes\ncan actually stay there.\n\n225\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.770\nBut if I realize something, that I've made\na mistake, I can always revert it back to\n\n226\n00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.120\nthat snapshot and\nhave that state there ready to go.\n\n227\n00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.090\n>> Love snapshots.\n\n228\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.060\nAgain, I use this a lot for\nthat sandbox environment, for\n\n229\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.580\ntesting things outside of\nmy production environment.\n\n230\n00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.300\nSo that means I'm gonna be doing\nthings that I'm not sure about it.\n\n231\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.520\nI don't know if it's gonna work or not.\n\n232\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.540\nI could hose things up completely.\n\n233\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.680\nAnd if I do,\nI don't wanna have to start all over and\n\n234\n00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.260\nbuild new virtual machines and install the\noperating system and do all that stuff and\n\n235\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.440\nreconfigure all my services.\n\n236\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.150\nI can take a snapshot right\nbefore I do something crazy.\n\n237\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.320\nAnd then I can do something crazy,\nand if it hoses things up\n\n238\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.990\nI just go back to that point in time and\nit's like it never happened.\n\n239\n00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.650\nMagic.\n\n240\n00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.660\n>> It really is kind of one of the neatest\nthings about using virtual machines\n\n241\n00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.100\nthat you can do.\n\n242\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.080\nBecause it does save you a lot of\ntime instead of having to rebuild\n\n243\n00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.280\neverything again.\n\n244\n00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.680\nIf you know that you've got a perfectly\nconfigured up in that point in time.\n\n245\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.123\nDo that add in whatever you actually\nneed to and all of a sudden it breaks?\n\n246\n00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:33.390\nGo back and you're ready to go.\n\n247\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.470\n>> I use this,\njust one more thing I'll throw in there,\n\n248\n00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.180\nwhen I build my sandbox environment, I'm\ntypically setting up a domain controller,\n\n249\n00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.330\na memory server or two,\nand a client or two.\n\n250\n00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.700\nI will build all those machines, and\n\n251\n00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.580\nI'll snapshot each one of them at that\npoint in time and call it initial setup.\n\n252\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.730\nAnd I can do whatever I want with\nthose machines, a week later,\n\n253\n00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.560\nI can roll them all back\nto the initial setup.\n\n254\n00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.750\nAnd I've got a pristine domain with just\nthose computer counts and that's it.\n\n255\n00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.060\n>> It really is a very nice feature for\neverything that we're doing.\n\n256\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.270\nSo let's show you how to create one.\n\n257\n00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.817\nSo let's say here it is, we've been\nrunning the server 2012 machine.\n\n258\n00:12:05.817 --> 00:12:09.968\nAnd I go ahead and I say,\nI want to add in a new server role, but\n\n259\n00:12:09.968 --> 00:12:14.210\nI'm not sure how's gonna work and\nhow's gonna do that.\n\n260\n00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.130\nSo which one do you is\ngoing to create a snapshot.\n\n261\n00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.420\nSo, we can create a snapshot in\na couple of different ways here.\n\n262\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.100\nI can do it while the machine\nis actually on if I want to.\n\n263\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.590\nBut if I do so, it's also gonna create a\nsnapshot of whatever's residing in memory\n\n264\n00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:33.210\nand that can actually be a lot of\ninformation if I'm not careful.\n\n265\n00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.256\nSo, what I normally do instead\nis I shut this machine down.\n\n266\n00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.420\nAnd I again have made that mistake for\n\n267\n00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.820\ngoing to the wrong location to shut\ndown the machine I mean, why not?\n\n268\n00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.930\nSo let me shut this machine down.\n\n269\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.100\nSo if you shut it down right,\nthere's not anything inside of RAM, and\n\n270\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.190\nthen your snapshot's a lot smaller.\n\n271\n00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.220\nIf you have a large hard drive,\nprobably not so essential.\n\n272\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.118\nBut, if you have a small one, it can help.\n\n273\n00:12:56.118 --> 00:13:00.468\n>> If you've given that virtual machine\n4GB of RAM in your snapshot now.\n\n274\n00:13:00.468 --> 00:13:03.940\nBecause that snapshot's that point in\ntime, that means it's going to have to\n\n275\n00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.890\nrestore the machine and what was in\nRAM when you took that snapshot.\n\n276\n00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.210\nSo there's another four gigs that you're\nincreasing the size of that snapshot.\n\n277\n00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.680\n>> That really is true.\n\n278\n00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.270\nSo this is the way that we do that.\n\n279\n00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.300\nSo I just select the server\nnow that it's powered off.\n\n280\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.860\nOver here on the upper right-hand\nside I can click on Snapshots.\n\n281\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.800\nAnd then you can see where\nit says its current state.\n\n282\n00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.950\nSo at the current state right now,\n\n283\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.790\nwith no roles installed,\nI have a little tiny camera.\n\n284\n00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.170\nIt says Take a Snapshot of\nthe Current Virtual Machine State.\n\n285\n00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:35.310\nI go and do this, and\nI name it Before Adding, let's say, DHCP.\n\n286\n00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.080\nAnd of course, you wanna actually add\nin whatever description that you want.\n\n287\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.040\nSo I'm gonna be very generic here,\n\n288\n00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.430\nBefore additional roles added.\n\n289\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.570\nAnd then click OK.\n\n290\n00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.640\nIt will go ahead and\ncreate that snapshot for me.\n\n291\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.620\nSo there it is, Before Adding the DHCP.\n\n292\n00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.890\nNow we can do that crazy thing that\nMike was talking about here and\n\n293\n00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.935\nadd in and change a configuration.\n\n294\n00:14:01.935 --> 00:14:03.790\nThat's probably where it is most helpful,\nright?\n\n295\n00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.170\nIf you know that you are going\nto be changing configurations.\n\n296\n00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.690\nGo look, I know that it worked\nup until this point and time.\n\n297\n00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.330\nIt's been working like a charm.\n\n298\n00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.350\nBut, I read something and I want to try\nthis setting, and now you can go in and\n\n299\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.810\nmake those configuration changes and\n\n300\n00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.570\ngo all right,\nas long as everything works we're fine.\n\n301\n00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.330\nEven weeks later like Mike was saying,\n\n302\n00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.530\nif I find out that it's actually\nstarting to get flakey on me.\n\n303\n00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.680\nI can always say well I'm going to roll\nthat thing back to that previous snapshot.\n\n304\n00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:35.010\nSo, let me go ahead and\nget access in and be able to do that.\n\n305\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.460\nSo once I log in I'm going to allow\nthe service manger to kick up.\n\n306\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.780\nWe're going to install\nthat DHCP server role.\n\n307\n00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.260\nShould be relatively quickly.\n\n308\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.050\nWe try to find a small one\nthat we could do here.\n\n309\n00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.020\nAnd let's say that we actually get\nit installed, get it configured, and\n\n310\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.400\nthen we realize something\nwe don't want it to work.\n\n311\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.980\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nroll it back after that point in time.\n\n312\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.720\nSo, here's the server manager.\n\n313\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.410\nWe're waiting for\n\n314\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:59.110\nthat little blue bar to finish doing\nits little dance across the screen.\n\n315\n00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.005\nI think, nope,\nit's still going there for a moment.\n\n316\n00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:05.789\nAnd then I'm going to select this number\ntwo here to add roles and features,\n\n317\n00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:07.975\nand that will bring up the wizard.\n\n318\n00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:12.404\nClick Next and we're actually going\nto use that first default there, and\n\n319\n00:15:12.404 --> 00:15:14.476\nthen leave it at the default name,\n\n320\n00:15:14.476 --> 00:15:18.203\nterrible I actually didn't\nchange the name of that machine.\n\n321\n00:15:18.203 --> 00:15:22.351\nAnd then I'm just going to select DHCP\nserver, tell it to add in whatever\n\n322\n00:15:22.351 --> 00:15:26.990\nfeatures it needs to, and it's going\nto say, hey, I found problems here.\n\n323\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.160\nOh, it doesn't have a static\nIP to be able to do that.\n\n324\n00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.400\nAt this point,\nI just need to add in a static IP, and\n\n325\n00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.850\nI can do that really quickly.\n\n326\n00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.745\nI say I can.\n\n327\n00:15:37.745 --> 00:15:41.360\nWe'll change it up here very quickly,\nand then I'll be able to do this.\n\n328\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.100\n>> So again, the whole idea\nis he's getting ready to make\n\n329\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.160\na change on this machine, and he's not\nsure if he wants to keep that change.\n\n330\n00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.900\nSo create the snapshot, then make your\nchange, if you need to roll back you can.\n\n331\n00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.549\nOne thing you do wanna keep in mind with\nsnapshots though, is they do affect your\n\n332\n00:15:56.549 --> 00:15:59.989\nperformance, because it's creating\nthis basically in the background.\n\n333\n00:15:59.989 --> 00:16:02.949\nIt's creating a second hard drive for\nthat machine,\n\n334\n00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:07.354\nwhat we call a differencing drive, and\nany changes that you make to that machine\n\n335\n00:16:07.354 --> 00:16:10.727\nafter the snapshot Are going\ninto this differencing drive.\n\n336\n00:16:10.727 --> 00:16:12.545\nThat way if you ever decide to roll back,\n\n337\n00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:15.030\nit can just throw away\nthe differencing drive.\n\n338\n00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.770\nYou're back to the original drive.\n\n339\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.250\nAnd if you take more than one Snapshot,\n\n340\n00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.260\nwhat's happening is when you\ngo to access that machine.\n\n341\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.910\nIt's having to read all\nthose different drives.\n\n342\n00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.110\nAnd it can't really hamper performance.\n\n343\n00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.200\nOne Snapshot, maybe not so much.\n\n344\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.410\nBut couple of Snapshots.\n\n345\n00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.260\nIt's gonna hurt.\n\n346\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.070\nSo it's something we don't typically\ndo in a production environment\n\n347\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.700\nunless it's a temporary thing.\n\n348\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.590\nTake a snapshot, do something,\neverything works.\n\n349\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.540\nDelete the snapshot.\n\n350\n00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.040\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.940\n>> I don't need to roll back\n\n352\n00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.240\nto that point in time.\nSo keep that in mind really for Sandboxes,\n\n353\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.420\ntest environments, not production.\n\n354\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.030\n>> Yeah, I went ahead and\nassigned it a static IP address.\n\n355\n00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.960\nIt complained again just briefly.\n\n356\n00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.560\nBut now it's actually installing that\nrole, and so we should be ready to go.\n\n357\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.920\nNow, we're not actually\ndoing anything with this.\n\n358\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.600\nWe're just actually making it install and\ndo what we want it to.\n\n359\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.350\nBut let's say that after\nit finishes installing,\n\n360\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.330\nwe realize we really don't want it there.\n\n361\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.430\nWell, I could go in and uninstall\nthe role and take all that stuff.\n\n362\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.230\nBut, remember a lot of times\nwhen we're doing this,\n\n363\n00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.084\nwe might've made other\nconfiguration changes.\n\n364\n00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:14.760\n>> Mm-hm\n>> We might have done something that we\n\n365\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.640\ndidn't mean to.\n\n366\n00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.090\nWe've configured something\nelse as it went along.\n\n367\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.080\nAnd especially this after weeks and\nweeks of doing this.\n\n368\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.420\nWe might find out that it's\nsomething we don't want.\n\n369\n00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.880\nSo once we do that, there we go,\nwe have now changes, and\n\n370\n00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.990\nthen we realize later on at some\npoint we really don't want those.\n\n371\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.960\n>> It's very advantageous.\n\n372\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.640\nYou know, what if you installed something,\na role, a service,\n\n373\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.050\nsome other third-party application.\n\n374\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.400\nAnd sure, you could uninstall\nthe application, but what if it changed\n\n375\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.980\nstartup types on some services, or created\nfolders somewhere, stored data somewhere?\n\n376\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.440\nAnd when you uninstall the application,\nthat doesn't move any of that back.\n\n377\n00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.610\nSo that Snapshot is a way to go back\nbefore the change ever occurred, and\n\n378\n00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.000\nno trace of that application or\nof service.\n\n379\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.345\nEver being on that machine.\n\n380\n00:17:56.345 --> 00:17:59.130\n>> Yeah I use it at same\nway that Mike does right.\n\n381\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.630\nI do my install,\nI do everything that I want to.\n\n382\n00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.550\nAnd then I have the base configuration\nI know that I mess over everything.\n\n383\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.910\nWe can go back to the original.\n\n384\n00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.730\nBut let's say right here,\nwe tried that the setting for\n\n385\n00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.720\na couple of days, and\nnow everything is going haywire and wrong.\n\n386\n00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.040\nI know the point in time that\nI was working before that.\n\n387\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.270\nI simply select that Snapshot.\n\n388\n00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.970\nAnd then I can actually restore the\nselected Snapshot of the Virtual Machine.\n\n389\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.010\nNow when I do that right.\n\n390\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.980\nIt's gonna actually lose all of those\nchanges that I'm actually proceeded,\n\n391\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.990\nsince that time.\n\n392\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.350\nLet me cancel this for a moment.\n\n393\n00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.910\nAnd you can see where it\nsays four minutes ago.\n\n394\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.570\nSo in other words, it's losing\nfour minutes of changes [LAUGH].\n\n395\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.020\n>> It's important to understand too\nthat you're not really back just that\n\n396\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.610\none change you wanna undo.\n\n397\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.140\nRight?\n\n398\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.760\nIt's everything that's\nhappened to that machine.\n\n399\n00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.280\nSince that Snapshot was created.\n\n400\n00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.000\nYou can't just roll back\nthe installation of DHCP, but\n\n401\n00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.200\nnot roll back the Windows updates that\noccurred, within the last couple minutes.\n\n402\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.760\nSo it's rolling everything back.\n\n403\n00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.600\n>> So if I go and select that and\nthen select Restore,\n\n404\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.610\nnow notice it has me create a Snapshot\nof the current machine state.\n\n405\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.320\nNow you can do that.\n\n406\n00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.630\nThat means,\nwell just in case I like the changes,\n\n407\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.530\nI don't wanna lose those possibilities.\n\n408\n00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:10.790\nYou can always create that as well.\n\n409\n00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.080\n>> You're making me dizzy here, Ronnie.\n\n410\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.193\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now I can make a Snapshot,\n\n411\n00:19:14.193 --> 00:19:16.102\nbefore I roll back to the Snapshot.\n\n412\n00:19:16.102 --> 00:19:21.020\nSo if I wanna roll back to the point\nbefore I rolled back, I can do that.\n\n413\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.170\n>> That is true.\n\n414\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.450\nYes.\n>> Okay, just making sure, all right.\n\n415\n00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.200\n>> Just about, I think the reasoning\nactually is correct there.\n\n416\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.180\nSo that's a good kind\nof stopping point for\n\n417\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.750\nyou to think about when\nyou start doing this.\n\n418\n00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.440\nYou do have to be careful cuz easy just\nto click click click click, and then go.\n\n419\n00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.240\nWhy do I still have another Snapshot there\nand then you can choose the wrong one.\n\n420\n00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.480\n>> Well, like I said,\nwhat if what Ronnie said was true?\n\n421\n00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.980\nWhat if you had gone a week?\n\n422\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.290\nAnd now we wanted to undo\nthat installation of DHCP.\n\n423\n00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:52.110\nWe roll it back, and what we don't\nrealize is that somebody else\n\n424\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.300\nduring that week has made some other\nimportant changes that I wanted to keep.\n\n425\n00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.570\nAnd I just rolled it back to before\nthose changes were ever made.\n\n426\n00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.230\nWell, now with that,\nit's kind of a safety net.\n\n427\n00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.960\nI can go, oops!\n\n428\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.490\nI didn't mean to roll it back!\n\n429\n00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.025\nAnd I can go back to that\noriginal point in time.\n\n430\n00:20:07.025 --> 00:20:07.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Very twisty.\n\n431\n00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.000\nI mean, it does get a little\nmentally twisty there.\n\n432\n00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.570\n>> Yeah.\n\n433\n00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:17.780\nAnd it is yeah, you do have to make sure\nyou follow the logic, and that's the key.\n\n434\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.040\nThere are people that use these\nSnapshots incredibly masterfully,\n\n435\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.670\nthe way that they want to, right?\n\n436\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.270\nBeing I'll say, here's what I wanna save.\n\n437\n00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.330\nAnd here's a branch of a change of\nsomething else that I wanna save,\n\n438\n00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.950\nto be able to do that.\n\n439\n00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.950\nFrankly for me it's over my head, it\nreally is, it can actually be confusing.\n\n440\n00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.440\nSo something in selected store and\nnow notice that other change and\n\n441\n00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.340\nnow experiencing the current Snapchat\nis actually the one before that DHCP.\n\n442\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.090\nLet's hopefully I didn't save that one,\nand\n\n443\n00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:48.210\nthen I restart this I should come back in\nand now those changes should disappear.\n\n444\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.420\nI should have DHCP installed.\n\n445\n00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:55.460\nAll right, so the machine is now rebooted\nafter selecting that Snapchat to restore.\n\n446\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.200\nAnd then now we just have to verify\nthat everything is actually back.\n\n447\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.650\nAnd the original order unlike except for\n\n448\n00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:07.590\nmy typing ability,\nlet's back to sad sorry state.\n\n449\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.770\nNo matter what I do,\n\n450\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.930\nI don't think I can Snapchat that to\nprevious addition about one and two.\n\n451\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.890\nI would really like to\nif there were times,\n\n452\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.330\nto get it actually to a better state but.\n\n453\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.170\nSo there we go.\n\n454\n00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.250\nSo let's see the Server Manager\nshould pop-up and\n\n455\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:24.200\nas long as don't see that DHCP role and\neither of those changes I should fine.\n\n456\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.950\nAnd we'll wait here for\njust a moment to help us out.\n\n457\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.460\nSo, looks like they were fine.\n\n458\n00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.140\nAll servers that are located the.\n\n459\n00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.600\nNothing actually looks down here.\n\n460\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.790\nSo there is we have now actually\nrestored ourselves successfully.\n\n461\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.680\nSo you can use a Snapchat to your\nability to your advantage, right?\n\n462\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.250\nIt's actually working on this difference\nmachine, yep and nothing is actually there\n\n463\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:51.980\nbesides this standard file and\nyeah, storage services ready to go.\n\n464\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.430\nAnd so it is an advantage and\n\n465\n00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.810\na future that you should understand if\nyou're working with virtualization.\n\n466\n00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:57.810\nReally cool stuff.\n\n467\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:58.920\n>> Very good.\nAll right now, Ronnie,\n\n468\n00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.860\nwhat if I want to copy the entire machine?\n\n469\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.830\nWhat if I want another\nWindows Server 2012 installation?\n\n470\n00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.880\n>> You absolutely can\ncopy the whole thing.\n\n471\n00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.820\nAnd there's a couple ways you can do it,\nright?\n\n472\n00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:15.220\nYou can actually just copy the VHD,\ncreate a new VM, and launch it again.\n\n473\n00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.350\nBut there's issues with\ndoing stuff like that, too.\n\n474\n00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:22.520\nSo what we wanna do instead is wanna\ndo what we call a clone of the machine.\n\n475\n00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.200\nAnd this is important for us.\n\n476\n00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.860\nRight?\nSometimes we may start off where we go\n\n477\n00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.890\nlook I like this machine as it is.\n\n478\n00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.030\nI like it so much that I've got it set up\nthe way that I would want this throughout\n\n479\n00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:33.110\nmy organization.\n\n480\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:37.160\nThat I rather clone this machine to\nhave everybody build their images or\n\n481\n00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.570\ntheir VMs images.\n\n482\n00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.715\nTheir VMs off of this VM.\n\n483\n00:22:42.715 --> 00:22:44.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess it's just the easiest way\n\n484\n00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.230\nto think about it.\n\n485\n00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.870\nSo you actually can get a VM\nsetup the way that you want to.\n\n486\n00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:49.730\nAnd then clone it.\n\n487\n00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.360\nNow you might say, why don't you just\ncopy the file that you talked about.\n\n488\n00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.850\nBecause now if you actually put those\nsame two files exact same copy of\n\n489\n00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.690\nthose two files or those VHDs and\nthe VMs on the network.\n\n490\n00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.240\nIt's gonna have conflicting stuff.\n\n491\n00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.830\nLike IP addresses, names, you name it.\n\n492\n00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.920\nIt's even gonna have those\ncharacteristics that make it unique,\n\n493\n00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.290\nactually be identical.\n\n494\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.600\nAnd machines don't like that.\n\n495\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.346\n>> It's like matter and\nanti-matter coming together.\n\n496\n00:23:13.346 --> 00:23:14.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're gonna create some kind\n\n497\n00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.910\nof black hole and suck everything in.\n\n498\n00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.920\nBut yeah there's some unique information\nthat identifies that machine to\n\n499\n00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.000\nthe network.\n\n500\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.680\nThat all has to be changed, right if we\nwant to run them both at the same time.\n\n501\n00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.700\nSo that's where cloning comes in\nbecause it knows about that stuff.\n\n502\n00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.590\nIt can strip it out, regenerate that\ninformation that's unique to that clone,\n\n503\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.090\nand when I'm setting up those test\nlabs I don't wanna install a server.\n\n504\n00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.880\nFive times to create five\nservers in my little test lab.\n\n505\n00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.450\nInstall it once and\nthen just clone it from there, and\n\n506\n00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.730\nthen I got five separate machines\nthat I can configure individually.\n\n507\n00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.890\n>> It really is fairly easy to do so.\n\n508\n00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:51.590\nJust like we did Snapshots,\ncloning is kind of along that same line.\n\n509\n00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.950\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n510\n00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.310\nSo here it is, on my VirtualBox Manager.\n\n511\n00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.347\nI went in and powered down the machine,\nas Mike was talking.\n\n512\n00:24:00.347 --> 00:24:03.635\nAnd then all we do is we select it,\nand we go up to Snapshots, and\n\n513\n00:24:03.635 --> 00:24:06.941\nthis is the only tricky part,\nis where the cloning is located.\n\n514\n00:24:06.941 --> 00:24:10.634\nYou select Snapshots, And then you'll see\nthat not only do we have the ability to\n\n515\n00:24:10.634 --> 00:24:12.917\nhave those little cameras for\nour snapshots, but\n\n516\n00:24:12.917 --> 00:24:17.080\nover here on the right-hand side, they\nactually made a little sheep right there.\n\n517\n00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.316\nAnd you might be wondering why it was,\ncuz Dolly, the-\n\n518\n00:24:19.316 --> 00:24:20.303\n>> The first cloned sheep.\n\n519\n00:24:20.303 --> 00:24:21.580\nShe was the first successful clone.\n\n520\n00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:26.060\n>> Yeah, it was the first successful clone\nand VirtualBox wanted to recognize that,\n\n521\n00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:30.560\nand so if I hover over that, it says\nClone the Selected Virtual Machine.\n\n522\n00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.160\nI simply select that and notice that it's\ntelling me right away, hey, even if you're\n\n523\n00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.310\ngonna clone this we need to recognize\nit differently right here, right away.\n\n524\n00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.140\nSo it added in the extension of clone,\nand we're gonna leave it as default\n\n525\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.030\nbecause I'm too lazy to rename\nit something else here.\n\n526\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.940\nThe other thing that you want is right\nhere where it says reinitialize the mac\n\n527\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.510\naddress of all network cards.\n\n528\n00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.640\nRemember if you cloned this, right,\nthe entire VM is cloned, and\n\n529\n00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.490\nthat even includes\nthe virtual network adapter.\n\n530\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.380\nSo Mike, what that means is if I were\nto actually just directly clone it,\n\n531\n00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.650\nI would still get a duplicate MAC address,\nand that on a network can cause problems.\n\n532\n00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.630\nSo what it says instead is, hey, instead\nof this, when you clone this, go ahead and\n\n533\n00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.400\nactually reinitialize.\n\n534\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.700\nIn other words, generate a brand new\nMAC address for my NIC instead, so\n\n535\n00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.990\nwhen it does go onto network it's\nnot gonna cause any issues at all.\n\n536\n00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.020\nSomebody really thought\nabout this cloning process.\n\n537\n00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.760\n>> Absolutely, there are times when\nmaybe you don't want to do that.\n\n538\n00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.410\nMaybe you're trying to\nduplicate an environment, and\n\n539\n00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.050\nyou're gonna put it on a separate network,\nand\n\n540\n00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:29.810\nyou don't have to worry about conflicting\nIP addresses or MAC addresses.\n\n541\n00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.840\nIn fact,\nyou want an exact copy of those servers.\n\n542\n00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.330\nSo you can test it out in an isolated,\nhost only network or private network or\n\n543\n00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.520\nsomething like that.\n\n544\n00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.450\nBut most of the time,\nif I'm gonna bring those onto the network\n\n545\n00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.840\nwith the other machines, I'm going\nto have to change that information.\n\n546\n00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.410\nSo, that gives me the ability\nto quickly make it unique.\n\n547\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.180\nWon't have any of those conflicts.\n\n548\n00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:48.792\n>> And that is key.\n\n549\n00:25:48.792 --> 00:25:49.953\nAnd we'll click Next here.\n\n550\n00:25:49.953 --> 00:25:54.140\nAnd then it's gonna ask about, hey do we\nwanna full clone or do we want it linked?\n\n551\n00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.050\nNow the full close is it's gonna\nduplicate everything, like you said.\n\n552\n00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.790\nThe VM as well as the hard drive and\neverything at once.\n\n553\n00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.140\nAnd it becomes a standalone machine.\n\n554\n00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.880\nBut you can create what\nwe call a linked clone.\n\n555\n00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.360\nA new machine won't be created, but\n\n556\n00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.330\nthe Virtual Disc files will be tied to\nthe original files of the machine, so you\n\n557\n00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:15.820\njust kinda realize that you can do both of\nthem depending on what you actually need.\n\n558\n00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.930\nI normally like just creating this full\nclone because I want it to be standalone.\n\n559\n00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.480\nI don't want that worry about moving\nfiles and changing them some other way.\n\n560\n00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.320\nAnd do I want to actually go ahead and do\njust a current state of the machine, and\n\n561\n00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.910\nI was including in a clone, do I want\na Snapchat, or do I want everything?\n\n562\n00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.210\nNormally I like doing everything,\nthat way.\n\n563\n00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.370\nIf I lose something I'm not gonna,\n\n564\n00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.160\noh maybe I could get it\nback from the other one.\n\n565\n00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.480\nSo like cloning the whole thing and\njust click Clone.\n\n566\n00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.910\nAnd from that point on,\n\n567\n00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.210\nis gonna take little bit of time to\ngo through the cloning process here.\n\n568\n00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.900\nAnd in the end,\n\n569\n00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.360\nit will end up showing that over here in\nthe left-hand side as a cloned machine.\n\n570\n00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.900\nIt says that it's gonna take us several\nminutes for us to be able to do this.\n\n571\n00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.760\nSo, we actually wait for\na little bit of time here.\n\n572\n00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.480\nAnd through the magic of television,\n\n573\n00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.580\nactually come back when\nit's actually ready.\n\n574\n00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.541\nIt's now actually done, and it went\nfrom 21 minutes to like that, to zero,\n\n575\n00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:06.503\nin just three of four minutes.\n\n576\n00:27:06.503 --> 00:27:10.428\nSo the result is that here's\nthe original machine, and\n\n577\n00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:13.300\nnow here is the clone that we have.\n\n578\n00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.330\nAnd both of them are now ready for us to\nactually be able to take advantage of.\n\n579\n00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.770\nAnd so now with that cloned machine, if I\nwanted to I could start up either one or\n\n580\n00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.220\nI could start up both of them, and\nwe'd be ready and off and running, and\n\n581\n00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.590\nhave the duplicate identity,\nnot duplicate identity.\n\n582\n00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.790\nBut the duplicate machines and\n\n583\n00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.210\nthe configuration that we want to,\nready to roll and do whatever we need.\n\n584\n00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.832\n>> Yeah, just something to keep in mind\nis, the bigger the hard drives are,\n\n585\n00:27:34.832 --> 00:27:37.950\nif you get two or\nthree hard drives attached to that VM,\n\n586\n00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.680\nthat cloning process might take a little\nlonger, so something to keep in mind.\n\n587\n00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.740\nAll right, Ronnie, so\nwe've got this machine cloned.\n\n588\n00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:49.070\nSomething we haven't really\ntalked about yet is security.\n\n589\n00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:50.860\nAnd you know I love security, so\n\n590\n00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.260\nlet's talk about that\na little bit with these VMs.\n\n591\n00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:57.880\n>> So, just remember that anything that\nyou do to a physical machine for security,\n\n592\n00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.790\nyou need to do the same thing\ninside of your VMs as well.\n\n593\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.530\nSo when we kind of left this\nkind of really at the end here.\n\n594\n00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:05.190\nBecause it's just a reminder, right?\n\n595\n00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:09.090\nThat even though it looks like a toy, and\nI know sometimes it can, a little toy,\n\n596\n00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.360\na little test environment.\n\n597\n00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.430\nIf it's gonna be connected\nto the internet at all,\n\n598\n00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.390\nyou need to make sure you\nhave the same things.\n\n599\n00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.900\nRight, we're doing updates, we're doing\nour antivirus, we're making sure that we\n\n600\n00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.610\nactually are keeping up with everything\nthat we need to secure that machine.\n\n601\n00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.520\nFollow the principle of least privilege,\nright.\n\n602\n00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.370\nDon't give everybody access to\nthe thing if you don't need to.\n\n603\n00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.850\nMake sure that you are actually\nfollowing those same principles for\n\n604\n00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.900\na physical machine as you are on\nthose virtual machines, and\n\n605\n00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.710\nthat will help keep you\nas safe as possible.\n\n606\n00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.510\nAnd if you don't need to\nrun it 24 hours a day,\n\n607\n00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:42.290\ndon't run it 24 hours a day,\njust leave it on all the time.\n\n608\n00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.180\nCuz that's another\nconnection into a machine\n\n609\n00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.430\nthat really you don't need to have.\n\n610\n00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.950\n>> Absolutely.\n\n611\n00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.080\nIt can become a huge\nhole in your security.\n\n612\n00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.187\nIf you're thinking,\noh it's a virtual machine,\n\n613\n00:28:52.187 --> 00:28:55.225\nI don't have to worry about patching\nit and running antivirus software.\n\n614\n00:28:55.225 --> 00:28:57.351\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if it's connected to the Internet,\n\n615\n00:28:57.351 --> 00:28:58.779\nthat means the bad guys can get to it.\n\n616\n00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:01.541\nAnd if it's also connected\nto your work network,\n\n617\n00:29:01.541 --> 00:29:05.440\nthat becomes a portal then to the rest\nof the machines on your network.\n\n618\n00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.544\nSo extremely important, but you secure it\njust like you would any other machine.\n\n619\n00:29:09.544 --> 00:29:14.887\nAnd then Ronny, we've got to think\nalso that the host has to be secured,\n\n620\n00:29:14.887 --> 00:29:19.269\nbecause that local admin account\nhas access to all the VMs so\n\n621\n00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:22.440\nthey could start shutting machines down.\n\n622\n00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.780\nThey could cause a denial of\nservice on your networks.\n\n623\n00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.107\nSo another layer of security that we\nhave to add when we talk about virtuals.\n\n624\n00:29:28.107 --> 00:29:31.536\n>> Just like we've talked\nabout in previous episodes,\n\n625\n00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:36.257\nthe very fact is that is also the\nforgotten layer of security on VMs, too,\n\n626\n00:29:36.257 --> 00:29:39.170\nis that you have to\nsecure that host machine.\n\n627\n00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:43.690\nAnd you want to make sure that one is also\nthe same way, up to date, secured and\n\n628\n00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.990\neverything else they want, and,\nof course, connected and ready to go.\n\n629\n00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.780\nDo regular scans, do monitoring.\n\n630\n00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.380\nAnd this is important, right?\n\n631\n00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.070\nMonitor that particular machine,\n\n632\n00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:57.880\nmonitor your VMs, making sure that\neverything is running the way needs to.\n\n633\n00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.870\n>> Now Ronnie we clone that machine,\nI used it to test something out.\n\n634\n00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:02.528\nI'm done with it.\n\n635\n00:30:02.528 --> 00:30:04.630\nIt's taking up a lot of disk space.\n\n636\n00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:05.460\nDo I have to keep it?\n\n637\n00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.350\nCan I get rid of it?\n\n638\n00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.655\n>> You should absolutely get rid of it if\nyou're not using it anymore Even a machine\n\n639\n00:30:10.655 --> 00:30:11.885\nthat's off, right?\n\n640\n00:30:11.885 --> 00:30:14.476\nIf it has sensitive data on it,\nit still has sensitive data on it, and\n\n641\n00:30:14.476 --> 00:30:16.910\nyou're not the only one that knows\nhow to use a virtual machine.\n\n642\n00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:21.190\nSo one of the best things you can do of\ncourse is to remove that virtual machine,\n\n643\n00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.100\nfrom of course your virtual\nmachine console, and\n\n644\n00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.790\nmake sure that it's\nactually completely gone.\n\n645\n00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.820\nOr you don't have to\nmake it completely gone.\n\n646\n00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:28.720\nThere's a couple of options.\n\n647\n00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.750\nLet me show you what we're talking about.\n\n648\n00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.400\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake an example here,\n\n649\n00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.300\nnow that we have two of these machines.\n\n650\n00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.290\nI really don't need both of them.\n\n651\n00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.410\nBut if I needed to remove one, and\nthat's saying I'm done with this.\n\n652\n00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.230\nI've decommissioned it, everything else.\n\n653\n00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.650\nI wanna right-click and select Remove.\n\n654\n00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:45.070\nWhen I do so, there's two options right?\n\n655\n00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.770\nSo do you wanna delete the files\ncontaining the virtual machine from\n\n656\n00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.210\nthe hard drive as well?\n\n657\n00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.920\nDoing this will also remove the files\ncontained in the machines virtual hard\n\n658\n00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.720\ndisk if they're not actually in use.\n\n659\n00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.370\nSo I can actually remove this only.\n\n660\n00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.590\nNow when I remove it,\nI'm removing the virtual machine file.\n\n661\n00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.670\nSo that's the representation of what?\n\n662\n00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:05.200\nOf that machine, but\nthe hard drive is still there.\n\n663\n00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.130\nIf I delete all the files, right,\nI'm deleting that virtual machine\n\n664\n00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:13.900\nas well as that VHD or VDI file, whatever\nit is that represents the hard drive.\n\n665\n00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.000\nSo if you want to make sure it's\ncompletely gone, you want to do that one.\n\n666\n00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.010\nIf you just go,\nI don't wanna see it anymore but\n\n667\n00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:22.300\nI wanna recreate that virtual\nmachine at some point in, and\n\n668\n00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.230\njust attach that as a new hard drive,\nor as another hard drive.\n\n669\n00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.060\nYou can do that as well.\n\n670\n00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.820\nAnd you may have to do that sometimes.\n\n671\n00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.740\nEvery once in awhile these virtual\nmachine files they do corrupt.\n\n672\n00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.370\nThey can get it to the point where all\nyou're seeing is errors every time\n\n673\n00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.430\nyou click on one.\n\n674\n00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:39.990\nYou can simply just delete that machine,\nleave the hard drive alone,\n\n675\n00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.930\nrecreate that virtual machine,\ninstead of creating a new hard drive, say,\n\n676\n00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:48.295\nattached the one I had before, and\nthat will now give it a new machine feel.\n\n677\n00:31:48.295 --> 00:31:50.805\nThe hard drive will go,\noh yeah, that seems good.\n\n678\n00:31:50.805 --> 00:31:51.635\nI like that.\n\n679\n00:31:51.635 --> 00:31:52.485\n>> Yeah, I use that a lot.\n\n680\n00:31:52.485 --> 00:31:56.402\nI've had a virtual machine that had\na second hard drive attached to it.\n\n681\n00:31:56.402 --> 00:32:00.372\nAnd that's where I put on my tools and\ndata files and things like that.\n\n682\n00:32:00.372 --> 00:32:02.272\nAnd when I wanted to remove that machine,\n\n683\n00:32:02.272 --> 00:32:04.948\nwell I might need those tools\non another virtual machine.\n\n684\n00:32:04.948 --> 00:32:09.916\nSo, I'll delete the VM, the configuration\nfile, save the VHD or VDR or whatever\n\n685\n00:32:09.916 --> 00:32:14.812\nformat we have that could be using, then\nI can build up a new machine and go, hey,\n\n686\n00:32:14.812 --> 00:32:19.130\nI'm gonna attach that existing\ndrive as a second drive and bang.\n\n687\n00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.560\nThere's all my tools that I need and\nI'm good to go.\n\n688\n00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.310\nSo, very handy.\n\n689\n00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:25.270\nSometimes you do want to keep\nthe actual hard drive file,\n\n690\n00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.890\njust delete the virtual machine.\n\n691\n00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.269\n>> So there's no doubt,\nyou simply pick one.\n\n692\n00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:32.750\nI'm going to select Delete All Files since\nI actually made a complete clone of this.\n\n693\n00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.840\nOnce it does that,\nit is actually gone from those locations.\n\n694\n00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.680\nI don't know if I can\nfind it really quickly.\n\n695\n00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.300\nLet's see if I can here.\n\n696\n00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.052\nAnd it was in my profile.\n\n697\n00:32:43.052 --> 00:32:44.950\nI'm just trying to remember\nwhere I actually have it.\n\n698\n00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.165\nSo, let's see.\nUsers and it was Ronnie, and\n\n699\n00:32:48.165 --> 00:32:51.460\nthere it is dot, dot, actually down here.\n\n700\n00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.490\nVirtual Box and\n\n701\n00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:57.380\nyou'll see it doesn't actually have that\nServer_2012R2 with the clone beside it.\n\n702\n00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.328\nIs actually gone from here.\n\n703\n00:32:58.328 --> 00:33:00.435\nI probably should have\nshowed you that before, but\n\n704\n00:33:00.435 --> 00:33:02.262\nthe it would have\nactually been right here.\n\n705\n00:33:02.262 --> 00:33:03.580\nSo that is where the clone\nwould have been.\n\n706\n00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.030\n>> That freed up that disk space\nassociated with that virtual machine?\n\n707\n00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.650\n>> Yeah so there really is.\n\n708\n00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:13.122\nThere's a lot of technology that's right\nthere inside of Virtual Box for us to be\n\n709\n00:33:13.122 --> 00:33:17.395\nable to use, but you gotta remember that\nthe very fact is that even though this\n\n710\n00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:21.975\nis one of them and it's a great one to\nuse, there's plenty of more technologies.\n\n711\n00:33:21.975 --> 00:33:24.102\nAnd throughout the rest of the series,\n\n712\n00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:27.270\nwe'll be examining some\nof those other ones here.\n\n713\n00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.670\nAnd this is my favorite.\n\n714\n00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:30.204\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n715\n00:33:30.204 --> 00:33:33.030\ncompared to the ones that are out\nthere that you'll probably use,\n\n716\n00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:36.210\nwe'll be seeing kind of some the same\nfeatures, but we'll see it from that\n\n717\n00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.220\nperspective, cuz you do, you need\nto be familiar with more than one.\n\n718\n00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.650\n>> Absolutely but when it comes to needing\na simple, quick virtualization technology,\n\n719\n00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.018\nRonnie, you're the one that turned\nme on to this a few years ago.\n\n720\n00:33:46.018 --> 00:33:48.996\nVirtual Box, you just need to\ninstall something really quick,\n\n721\n00:33:48.996 --> 00:33:53.310\nso you can get up and run with some type\nof virtualization, this is the way to go.\n\n722\n00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.760\nGreat for test environments.\n\n723\n00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.700\nGreat for getting your feet in\nthe world of virtualization.\n\n724\n00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:58.680\nAnother great episode, Ronny.\n\n725\n00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.610\nWe thank you for all of those great\nexplanations and demonstrations.\n\n726\n00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.305\nWe saw a lot of the advanced\nconfigurations in this\n\n727\n00:34:05.305 --> 00:34:10.115\nepisode we worked with adjusting the CPU\nand the RAM for a virtual machine.\n\n728\n00:34:10.115 --> 00:34:14.565\nWe saw adding additional drives\nto give us more storage space.\n\n729\n00:34:14.565 --> 00:34:16.446\nWe looked at our networking options and\n\n730\n00:34:16.446 --> 00:34:18.676\nsharing a folder between the host and\nthat VM.\n\n731\n00:34:18.676 --> 00:34:21.568\nAnd then we got into snapshots and\ncloning,\n\n732\n00:34:21.568 --> 00:34:25.555\nwhich gives me the ability to\ntake that point in time image and\n\n733\n00:34:25.555 --> 00:34:29.560\nroll back to it if I need to,\nor duplicate an entire machine.\n\n734\n00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.240\nSo, a lot of great information, Ronnie.\n\n735\n00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.420\nWe appreciate that.\n\n736\n00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.000\nHope you guys enjoyed watching.\n\n737\n00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.550\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n738\n00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.180\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n739\n00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.941\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n740\n00:34:39.941 -->

00:00:16.375\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:20.335\ntoday's episode we're going to be moving\nthrough virtualization technologies, and\n\n5\n00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:23.755\nwe're going to be looking at\ninstalling VMWare workstation.\n\n6\n00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:26.685\nNow one of the things that we have\nto discuss here is the fact that,\n\n7\n00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:29.185\nremember we've touched base\non what a hypervisor is, and\n\n8\n00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:32.655\nwhat a type one hypervisor is and\nwhat a type two hypervisor is.\n\n9\n00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.215\nKeep in mind that this is\na type two hypervisor,\n\n10\n00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:37.970\nwhich means you're going to\nhave a host operating system.\n\n11\n00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.200\nAnd inside of that host operating system,\n\n12\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.260\nyou're gonna install the software\nthat will be running the hypervisor,\n\n13\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090\nmanaging the communication between\nthe hardware itself and the VMs.\n\n14\n00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.640\nNow who do we have to help us with\nthis today, but Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n15\n00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.730\nHow are you doing today, Ronnie?\n\n16\n00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.350\n>> I'm doing fine, as we continue to\nlook at virtualization technologies.\n\n17\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.330\nNow, what Wes just told us is\nsomething that's very important.\n\n18\n00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.400\nWe have, in previous episode\ntaken a look at of course using\n\n19\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.500\nsomething like Oracle's Virtual Box.\n\n20\n00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.230\nWe also saw using\nMicrosoft Hyper V as well.\n\n21\n00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.510\nAnd now we're going back and\n\n22\n00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.890\nwe're taking a look at another\ntype two Hypervisor for a moment.\n\n23\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.740\n>> Which is gonna be VMware Workstation.\n\n24\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.870\nIt's actually one of the more\npopular types of Type two\n\n25\n00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.360\nhypervisors that are out there, and let's\nreview just what Wes was talking about.\n\n26\n00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.840\nOn my screen, I went ahead and just pulled\nup a diagram that I'd used in the past,\n\n27\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.110\njust to make sure that we have\nthe concrete notion in our mind here,\n\n28\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.010\nof what we're working with, right?\n\n29\n00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.820\nSo when we talk about the idea of the type\ntwo hypervisor, remember that this is\n\n30\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.130\nprobably more like what somebody would\nnormally use on a physical work station.\n\n31\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630\nYou go and end up downloading\nthe hypervisor type of technology.\n\n32\n00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.320\nIn our instance here it's\ngonna be VMWare Workstation.\n\n33\n00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.620\nWe install it like an application\nright on the machine that we're using.\n\n34\n00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.540\nAnd then we can build the virtual\nmachines directly on top of that, and\n\n35\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.190\nit just looks like applications inside\nthe workstation that I'm normally on.\n\n36\n00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.560\nIn a type one hypervisor, which we will\nalso be getting back to as well too,\n\n37\n00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.630\nis that it actually works\na little bit differently.\n\n38\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.410\nIn this one, well,\nthe hypervisor, or the VMM,\n\n39\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.260\nthe virtual machine monitor, it depends\non who talks about the technology,\n\n40\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.180\nthat is installed directly\non top of the hardware.\n\n41\n00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.190\nSo remember over here on the type two,\nwe have the operating system and\n\n42\n00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.930\nthen we have that VMM, or\nthat virtual machine monitor, or\n\n43\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.460\nHypervisor, and\nlook at the actual VMs on top of that,\n\n44\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.170\nand that provides the two\nlayers of abstraction, right.\n\n45\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.200\nThe software layers in between you and\nthe hardware,\n\n46\n00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.990\nwhereas the operating system itself is\nnot directly running on top of that.\n\n47\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.880\nAnd notice over here, we really only have\none layer of abstraction between us and\n\n48\n00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.490\nthe virtual machines.\n\n49\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.330\n>> And what we're focusing in on today,\nof course,\n\n50\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.630\nis going to be the VMware workstation is\nthe one that we're going to focus in on.\n\n51\n00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.160\nAnd you might be wondering why,\n\n52\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.550\nthere are so many of these out there,\nwhy choose VMware workstation?\n\n53\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.320\nWell remember that VMware itself,\nis really who popularized and\n\n54\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.330\nreintroduced the IT world to\nthe world of virtualization again.\n\n55\n00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.380\nSo even though we had it back in\nthe days of mainframe computers, and\n\n56\n00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.360\nbeing able to virtualize\ndifferent types of technologies,\n\n57\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.380\nit's really that company VMware that said,\nlook, we can go beyond.\n\n58\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.860\nWe can go beyond virtualizing\nthings like network adapters and\n\n59\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.990\neven small storage devices here.\n\n60\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.350\nWhat we want to do, is we can say that we\ncan virtualize an entire machine itself,\n\n61\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.310\nso that includes of course sharing\nthings like RAM as well as CPU,\n\n62\n00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.040\nwhich we couldn't do before.\n\n63\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.550\nAnd so\nwe really do owe it to the VMware a team\n\n64\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.480\n>> Right out there at the very beginning,\n\n65\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.040\nbecause without that we would probably\nstill just be dealing with the idea of\n\n66\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.700\nphysical installations instead.\n\n67\n00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.750\n>> So it seems like,\nif I understand this right, Ronnie,\n\n68\n00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.150\nthe Type two Hypervisor,\ninstalling it on a single work station,\n\n69\n00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.390\nit seems like you might do something for\ntesting and maybe a small environment.\n\n70\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.280\nBut where the Type one hypervisor,\n\n71\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.070\nlooks like you get a little\nbit better performance.\n\n72\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.560\nSo that might be something that you see\nin a more enterprise level industry.\n\n73\n00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.390\nNow, I know that I've got an older laptop.\n\n74\n00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.360\nIf I've got this older laptop,\n\n75\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.140\ncan I install something like\nVMware Workstation on it?\n\n76\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.190\n>> Well, there are some minimal\nrequirements that we have to get\n\n77\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.220\ninto, right?\n\n78\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.540\nJust like what we saw with\nanother type two Hypervisor show,\n\n79\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.580\nwe also need to talk about that\nbriefly here for VMware workstation.\n\n80\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.150\nNow there are many different\nadditions of VMware workstation,\n\n81\n00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.520\nwe're going to be using\nthe VMware workstation 11.\n\n82\n00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.380\nSome of you all are going to be like,\nwhy did we choose 11?\n\n83\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.620\nAs you search there out on the net as of\nthis point as the recording of the show.\n\n84\n00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.010\nVMware Workstation 12 has really\nkinda made its introduction, but\n\n85\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.550\nwe have the actual licensing for\n\n86\n00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.010\nVMware 11, and it's gonna show us\nall the functionality that we need.\n\n87\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.850\nAnd that's why we stuck with that one.\n\n88\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.750\nBut when it comes down to it, right,\nwhat we've gotta understand is that\n\n89\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.440\nthere's gonna always be these minimum\nrequirements that we have to worry about.\n\n90\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.340\nAnd of course, those minimum\nrequirements revolve around the host\n\n91\n00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.380\noperating system that we're gonna\nbe installing the workstation on.\n\n92\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.610\nAnd then also of course the hardware\n\n93\n00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.780\nthat we have to worry about\nat the same time as well.\n\n94\n00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.480\nSo you do have to have a combination of\nthem, and believe it or not, the minimum\n\n95\n00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.390\nrequirements for installing an operating\nsystem is just not going to be enough.\n\n96\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.510\n>> So let me kinda give you an example\nhere of what I'm talking about.\n\n97\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.960\nLet me switch on over to my machine\nthat we'll be using at this point.\n\n98\n00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.600\nSo let's say that here it is, I have a\nWindows 10 work station that I have here.\n\n99\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.930\nThe physical components in it,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n100\n00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.010\njust show you the physical\ncomponents here.\n\n101\n00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.210\nIn Windows 10 I'm going to right click\non the Windows button and select system.\n\n102\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.720\nYou can see at least some of\nthe system processes right here.\n\n103\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.260\nThis has got a fairly strong processor.\n\n104\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.390\nIt's got a Xeon PU in it that\nruns at 2.672.66 gigahertz.\n\n105\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.666\nSo this is actually a fairly\nwell made processor.\n\n106\n00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:08.750\nWe've got about eight gigs of ram for\nit's memory,\n\n107\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.510\nand then the hard drive itself, if I bring\nup the file explorer and click on this PC.\n\n108\n00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.160\nI can see on the local storage,\nthat's the one we're gonna be using.\n\n109\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.180\nIt's gonna be about a gig of storage,\na little bit less than a gig,\n\n110\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.361\ncuz 900 megabytes, gigabytes,\nnot megabytes [LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:26.460\n>> [LAUGH] Gracious.\n\n112\n00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.490\n>> Yeah, 900 gigabytes of storage, so\nI have plenty of what I want to do.\n\n113\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.470\nI know that for Windows 10, having\nthe minimum installation requirements for\n\n114\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.930\nthat will allow me to run Windows 10,\n\n115\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.060\nand may even allow me to install\nVMware work station on it.\n\n116\n00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.760\nBut Wes, after I install the work station,\nI'm probably expecting to build some VMs,\n\n117\n00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.830\nso that's why the minimum requirements\nare not going to be enough.\n\n118\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.200\nAfter that you should\nthink about planning for\n\n119\n00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.710\nresources, that will be shared\nnot only with host VM, or\n\n120\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.920\nnot the host VM,\nthe host OS that is running on my machine.\n\n121\n00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.610\nAnd also, of course, the guest OSs\nthat are gonna be running in the VMs.\n\n122\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.400\nI need to consider both if\nI'm going to be doing this.\n\n123\n00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.010\n>> All right, now,\none of the things I do know,\n\n124\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.130\nknowing a little bit\nabout the Xeon processor.\n\n125\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.180\nNow, that processor is\ndefinitely pretty beefy.\n\n126\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.570\nIt's what we find in servers and stuff.\n\n127\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.220\nI also know that the Xeon\nprocessor is a 64-bit processor.\n\n128\n00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.990\nIs that something that we have to take\ninto consideration when when we're gonna\n\n129\n00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.800\nimplement some kind of hypervisor,\nor virtualization for that matter?\n\n130\n00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.190\n>> It really is,\nespecially with VMware workstation.\n\n131\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.700\nVMware workstation wants to allow\nyou to be able to run 32 bit,\n\n132\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:40.880\nas well as 64 bit virtual machines,\nVMs, inside of the workstation.\n\n133\n00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.760\nBut the way that,\nof course, that they do it,\n\n134\n00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.860\nis that one of those hardware\nrequirements is that the CPU\n\n135\n00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.990\nis gonna be able to support\nthat 64-bit processing as well.\n\n136\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.598\nSo, in other words,\nif you only have a 32-bit machine, and\n\n137\n00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:54.287\nit's almost difficult to find one Dan.\n\n138\n00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:58.249\nI'm not gonna say it's impossible, but\nit's almost very difficult to even buy\n\n139\n00:07:58.249 --> 00:08:01.861\na pre-built machine that doesn't\nactually have a CPU to support that But\n\n140\n00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:04.967\nif you are going to be installing that,\nthat's what you want.\n\n141\n00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:09.115\nYou want to actually have one\nthat's 64 bit processor, and\n\n142\n00:08:09.115 --> 00:08:13.200\nat least 1.3 gigahertz or\nfaster is what they recommend.\n\n143\n00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.590\nNow, does that mean it won't run if\nit's actually a slower processor?\n\n144\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.595\nI'm not gonna say it's not going to run,\nbut you'll see that the performance is not\n\n145\n00:08:21.595 --> 00:08:24.418\ngoing to be acceptable to what\nyou'll actually say, hey,\n\n146\n00:08:24.418 --> 00:08:26.750\nI'll actually be able to run VMs on that.\n\n147\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.280\nSo that is the minimum that\nthey actually require.\n\n148\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.130\nNow the better, right, the faster and\n\n149\n00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.530\nthe more cores that you have is\ngoing to be better for you, too.\n\n150\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.170\nAnd that actually leads\nus to another aspect of\n\n151\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.720\nthe CPU that we need to think about, too.\n\n152\n00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.950\nSo the way that VMware Workstation works\nis something that's also incredibly nice,\n\n153\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.550\ntoo, is that it can take\nadvantage of multiple cores and\n\n154\n00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.370\neven multiple processors.\n\n155\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.050\nNow there's a lot of applications that\nyou and I run just on a regular PC or\n\n156\n00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:01.470\na laptop of sorts that it\nreally doesn't take advantage.\n\n157\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:06.920\nSo even though your CPU may actually\nhave a quad core processor in it,\n\n158\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.180\nyou might find out that a lot of the\napplications that you run on a daily basis\n\n159\n00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.110\nonly takes advantage of one of\nthose quad core processors.\n\n160\n00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.292\nSo, in other words,\n\n161\n00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:20.367\neven though you have four that actually\nruns on the dye of your CPU, well,\n\n162\n00:09:20.367 --> 00:09:24.084\na lot of times those applications\nwill only take advantage of one.\n\n163\n00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:28.438\nThe way that the VMware Workstation\nends up working is that it can take\n\n164\n00:09:28.438 --> 00:09:32.660\nadvantage not only of a single\nprocessor that has multiple cores.\n\n165\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.440\nSo your dual core and quad core,\nit can take advantage of that.\n\n166\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.530\nBut it can also take advantage\nof multiple processors.\n\n167\n00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.340\nAnd I think on the workstation\nit can take advantage of two.\n\n168\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.430\nI think, I don't think it\nactually takes advantage of more.\n\n169\n00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.880\nI may be mistaken on that one.\n\n170\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.930\nSo I'd have to look up the specs on that,\nand you can look up those specs as well.\n\n171\n00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.650\nBut I think at least at the basis\nhere on the workstation side,\n\n172\n00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.640\nit will actually allow you to actually run\nit on a machine that has two processors.\n\n173\n00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.829\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhen in the world would I ever find a PC,\n\n174\n00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:04.899\na personal computer, with two?\n\n175\n00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:07.190\nWell, if you build your own,\nyou'll probably find one.\n\n176\n00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.140\nBut most of the time, where Wes and\n\n177\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.270\nI are gonna find them are gonna\nactually be inside of servers, right?\n\n178\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:17.988\nInside of a production type of network\nwhere we have these super beefy,\n\n179\n00:10:17.988 --> 00:10:24.278\nsuper high performance types of machines\nthat are designed to be on 24/7,\n\n180\n00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:28.586\nrunning at full speed as fast\nas it can for days on end.\n\n181\n00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.440\nThat's where we'll probably find it.\n\n182\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.470\nSo this leads you to understand something\nhere, as far as the actual software goes,\n\n183\n00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.460\nis that it can take\nadvantage of that hardware,\n\n184\n00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.980\nespecially those multiple core processors.\n\n185\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.960\nAnd when it takes advantage of that, that\nmeans also in the VMs that you and I will\n\n186\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.580\ncreate, it can also, those VM can take\nadvantage of those processers as well.\n\n187\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.610\nSo it's a pretty neat software and\nthat Hypervisor that comes along with it,\n\n188\n00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.960\nthat allows us to be able to do that.\n\n189\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.570\n>> So\nbasically kind of like a multitasker.\n\n190\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.620\nIf we've got more than\none processor on there,\n\n191\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.045\nyou take advantage of more than one\nmachine running at the same time now.\n\n192\n00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:05.830\nOne of the things that I was\nalso thinking there Ronnie,\n\n193\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.680\nbuilt into the instruction set is\nthere another characteristic or\n\n194\n00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.360\nany other characteristics built into\nthe CPUs that we might need to be aware of\n\n195\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.970\nbefore we're gonna be able to support\neven virtualization in general?\n\n196\n00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.966\n>> You're definitely gonna\nsee that technology.\n\n197\n00:11:17.966 --> 00:11:20.057\nAnd we've mentioned it\nbefore in other shows, but\n\n198\n00:11:20.057 --> 00:11:22.090\nit's a great place to mention it again.\n\n199\n00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.573\nThe very fact is on AMD and\non Intel processors,\n\n200\n00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:30.016\nwhat we see there is technology\nthat's actually designed so\n\n201\n00:11:30.016 --> 00:11:34.653\nthat VMs, virtual machines,\ncan take advantage of the CPUs.\n\n202\n00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:39.141\nNow, what we're talking about here is,\nof course, Intel VT, or what we call\n\n203\n00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:44.410\nthe virtualization technology on the Intel\nprocessors and then AMDV has it as well.\n\n204\n00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.780\nNow, inside of VMware though,\nthey also use an older term, and\n\n205\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.500\nlet me make sure I tell you right, LAHF.\n\n206\n00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.060\nAnd then of course there's an SAHF.\n\n207\n00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.370\nAnd that, just for us,\nis an older term that says,\n\n208\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.340\nlook you can take advantage of some of\nthese virtualization features here.\n\n209\n00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:06.470\nBut if your Intel processor or\nyour AMD processor,\n\n210\n00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.750\nif it does support the Intel VT or the AMD\nV, more than likely it also supports this.\n\n211\n00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.960\nAnd we wanted to mention that because\nsometimes what ends up happening is that\n\n212\n00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.950\nyou read different documentation.\n\n213\n00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.451\nOne will refer to the newer stuff and\none will refer to the old one.\n\n214\n00:12:20.451 --> 00:12:23.881\nBut just kind of know this, if you go to\nVMware and you go, well I see this and\n\n215\n00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:26.892\nit says it requires this, but\nhow do I know that it supports that?\n\n216\n00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:28.790\nI don't see it on any other place.\n\n217\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:34.440\nWell if you're using AMD or\nAMD V or Intel VT,\n\n218\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.780\nmore than likely it also supports that\nolder mentioning of that standard.\n\n219\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.565\n>> So it's an instruction basically\nbuilt into the x86 architecture that's\n\n220\n00:12:42.565 --> 00:12:44.412\nbeen around for a little bit.\n\n221\n00:12:44.412 --> 00:12:49.099\nAnd I am aware of the VT and the V,\ndepending on if you're in Intel and AMD,\n\n222\n00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:50.780\nso very good to know.\n\n223\n00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.930\nNow that we've got our hardware, or\nat least we've got the requirements for\n\n224\n00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.250\nour hardware, are we ready to start\nbuilding a machine, or not a machine, but\n\n225\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.320\ninstalling the software itself?\n\n226\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.680\n>> Yeah, to a point, right?\n\n227\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.520\nBut we wanna make sure that we\nemphasize something right here.\n\n228\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.332\nBecause it's very easy at the beginning,\nespecially if you're an IT worker and\n\n229\n00:13:09.332 --> 00:13:12.582\nyou're unfamiliar with this,\nthat you can run into some issues when\n\n230\n00:13:12.582 --> 00:13:15.180\nsomebody says yeah,\njust go ahead and download this.\n\n231\n00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.150\nAnd install it on a machine, and it works.\n\n232\n00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.550\nWell in the installation part, right, one\nof the things that we have to be aware of\n\n233\n00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.030\nare these basic requirements\nthat have to be met.\n\n234\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.280\nThat intel VT and AMD V, these are two\n\n235\n00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.090\nof the most important things that we\ncan actually run in today's hardware.\n\n236\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.610\nNow you actually see that some type\ntwo hypervisors and a lot of type one\n\n237\n00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:41.920\nhypervisors will require that technology,\nbut not every single one will.\n\n238\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.834\nYou just have to do a little bit\nof research to see whether or\n\n239\n00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:45.971\nnot it actually will.\n\n240\n00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:49.515\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwell if I have a choice between them,\n\n241\n00:13:49.515 --> 00:13:51.920\nhow do I know which one I should choose?\n\n242\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.570\nYou should always choose the ones that\ndo support this, Intel VT or AMDV, and\n\n243\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.020\nthat is because it actually\ndoes provide for better and\n\n244\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.420\nmore efficient use of the hardware itself.\n\n245\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.550\nBefore this time,\n\n246\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.150\nif you actually end up with\na hypervisor that says, we don't care.\n\n247\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.252\nAnd you can put it on any machine\nthat you want to, and you install it.\n\n248\n00:14:11.252 --> 00:14:15.771\nWell, even though that hypervisor will\nwork for you as a type two hypervisor,\n\n249\n00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:20.380\nwhat you're also gonna see is that it's\ngonna bring out tremendous overhead.\n\n250\n00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.930\nAnd where that will actually turn out for\n\n251\n00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.730\nyou as the end result is that it\nwill be slower in its function.\n\n252\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.790\nYour CPU's gonna heat up quite a bit.\n\n253\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.750\nAnd that's because it has\nto translate the software\n\n254\n00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.810\ninto an unusual language\nbefore the CPU gets it.\n\n255\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.970\nAnd then that CPU has to translate\nit back into that unusual language\n\n256\n00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.060\nbefore your VMs get it, as well.\n\n257\n00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.840\nIntel VT AMDV essentially say, look,\nI can read those instructions and\n\n258\n00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.790\nit passes it right through the hardware.\n\n259\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.950\nHardware passes it back up.\n\n260\n00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.520\nThe instruction set's the same.\n\n261\n00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.500\nAnd that's why we wanna\ntake advantage of it.\n\n262\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.020\nAnd so it's very important that we\nhave that right at the beginning.\n\n263\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.242\nAnd the reason why is that,\neven though Wes mentioned the idea of\n\n264\n00:14:57.242 --> 00:15:00.056\ntype two hypervisors for\nmaybe a testing environment.\n\n265\n00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:02.964\nAnd then type one you'll generally end up\nseeing that of course in the production\n\n266\n00:15:02.964 --> 00:15:04.030\nenvironment.\n\n267\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.271\nThere are still, even today,\neven though that's where we all began was\n\n268\n00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:12.719\nkind of a test bed environment on type\ntwo hypervisors, the majority of us,\n\n269\n00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:14.753\nthough, might not ever see this.\n\n270\n00:15:14.753 --> 00:15:18.721\nBut there are companies out there\nthat are actually using stuff like\n\n271\n00:15:18.721 --> 00:15:23.160\nVMware Workstation as their\nproduction type of hypervisor.\n\n272\n00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.748\nThere are still people out there using\nthings like VirtualBox as their production\n\n273\n00:15:26.748 --> 00:15:27.428\nhypervisors.\n\n274\n00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:28.623\nWell, why?\n\n275\n00:15:28.623 --> 00:15:30.920\nWell, it's the idea of familiarity, right?\n\n276\n00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.860\nThe very fact is, I know VirtualBox,\nI know VMware Workstation..\n\n277\n00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:36.610\nI'm sticking with it.\n\n278\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.320\nWhy would I stick with a technology,\nthat now I've got to figure out again?\n\n279\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.220\nWell the reason why is that we take\nadvantage better of the hardware.\n\n280\n00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.448\nBut if I feel comfortable with it,\nI might stick with this instead and\n\n281\n00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:47.460\njust use it anyways.\n\n282\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.758\nAnd most of them today are so rock solid.\n\n283\n00:15:50.758 --> 00:15:54.463\nEven though they are gonna take\na bit more overhead, and they will,\n\n284\n00:15:54.463 --> 00:15:58.171\nit's just easier for most people to\nuse and so why not stick with it?\n\n285\n00:15:58.171 --> 00:16:02.459\n>> Yeah, and I do know in a situation\nwhere you have a small office, home office\n\n286\n00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:06.747\nwhere you only got a handful of computers\nand maybe the company can't really\n\n287\n00:16:06.747 --> 00:16:11.370\nAfford to buy a server, and then have\nthe server maintained, and specifically,\n\n288\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.591\nthis one small company, again,\njust a handful of operating systems, and\n\n289\n00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:19.285\nthey were moving from Windows 7,\nmoving into Windows 8.1.\n\n290\n00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:21.660\nSome people still needed to\nbe able to use Windows 7.\n\n291\n00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.830\nAnd they still wanted to\ndeploy the operating system.\n\n292\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.980\nSo this was a way that they can kind\nof have the best of the both and\n\n293\n00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.620\nget used to it.\n\n294\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.970\nSo, very good now.\n\n295\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:28.530\nYep.\n\n296\n00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.830\n>> Yeah.\n>> So when we start seeing this, right, so\n\n297\n00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.890\nwhat we have now is we understand\nthe hardware is actually the key.\n\n298\n00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.700\nAnd we've already talked about\nthe very fact that we need,\n\n299\n00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.450\nof course, the hardware for both.\n\n300\n00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.110\nAnd we need to count all those up.\n\n301\n00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.630\nAnd the reason why that is important\nis I am going to run VMs, and\n\n302\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.770\nI'm gonna run a host operating system,\n\n303\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.910\nI need to make sure I have\nresources to be able to do both.\n\n304\n00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.270\nSo my guest operating system is\ngonna require at least the minimum.\n\n305\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.001\nNow, if I'm running any\nother applications there,\n\n306\n00:16:55.001 --> 00:16:58.410\nI got to make sure that I provide for\nthat as well.\n\n307\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.700\nSo on a system let's say like mine,\nthat has eight gigs of RAM.\n\n308\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:08.000\nAnd I have almost a terabyte\nhard drive space that I can use.\n\n309\n00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.770\nAnd of course the idea the CPU is\n\n310\n00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.220\ndouble the actual processing\nminimum requirements gonna be.\n\n311\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.100\nI have all the minimum\nrequirements that I need.\n\n312\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.390\nNow what I also need to do is I need\nto take a little bit of time and\n\n313\n00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.190\nalso go well,\nhow many VMs am I planning to run?\n\n314\n00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:27.600\nNow if you're just doing this test for the\none time, you just need to go ahead and\n\n315\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.070\nfigure out what operating\nsystem you're gonna put on it.\n\n316\n00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.700\nAnd then make sure you actually\nhave enough RAM that you can spare\n\n317\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.450\nto be able to assign that to that VM.\n\n318\n00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:41.590\nSo multiple VMs, though, will actually\nrequire their own set of hardware.\n\n319\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.280\nSo for example if I create three VMs,\nlet's say Windows 8.1 VMs,\n\n320\n00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.550\neven though I might be able to run\nthem on a single gigabyte of ram,\n\n321\n00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.950\nthe performance may not be as good.\n\n322\n00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.120\nSo, I may choose I want to\nrun it on two gigs each, but\n\n323\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.330\nthat means I have to have at\nleast six gigs for my VMs to run.\n\n324\n00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:04.560\nEach one of them is going to require at\nleast 40 gigabytes of hard drive space.\n\n325\n00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.740\nSo there's another 120\ngigs of hard drive space.\n\n326\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.000\nIf I don't have that and\n\n327\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.380\nI don't have that ready to go,\nwell, then I'm gonna be in trouble.\n\n328\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.320\nAnd I also have to think about then,\nthe host operating system, so\n\n329\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.610\nyou do want to take a little bit\nof time in getting this right,\n\n330\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:22.630\nbecause starting off right at the\nbeginning is gonna save a lot of headaches\n\n331\n00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.140\neven if you're testing it out, so you\nwant to at least plan that out right now.\n\n332\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.710\nBut yes, after that,\n\n333\n00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.310\nwhat else do we need then to get\nstarted now that we have the hardware?\n\n334\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.760\nWe of course we need a copy of\nthe actual workstation software.\n\n335\n00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.730\nWe're gonna need a valid license for\nus on that VMware workstation.\n\n336\n00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.290\nWe're also then as we get started here and\n\n337\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.670\nwe start thinking about the future\nof building virtual machines.\n\n338\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.740\nWhich we're gonna have an operating\nsystem on, is we'll need a copy\n\n339\n00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.230\nof that operating system that we'll\nbe installing on it in the future.\n\n340\n00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.170\nAnd even that copy will have\nto be licensed as well, and\n\n341\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.680\nwe'll talk about that in the future too.\n\n342\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.390\nBut that what we'll actually need.\n\n343\n00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.430\nSo, where in the world do you get this,\n\n344\n00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.850\nand what is actually\ngonna be happening here?\n\n345\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:09.070\nWell, you can always go out and do\na search out on the Internet for VMware.\n\n346\n00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:14.295\nLet me show you what, doing here, and so\nif I just type in that search bar here,\n\n347\n00:19:14.295 --> 00:19:18.450\nVMware, it actually comes\nup with .com right away.\n\n348\n00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.760\nI can go directly to their site and\nthis is something that's nice for\n\n349\n00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.160\nyou if you're trying this out.\n\n350\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.350\nNow I have a licensed edition of it.\n\n351\n00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.660\nBut you can go out and they actually\nhave trial versions of this that you can\n\n352\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.000\ndownload and try it out for\nabout 30 days or so.\n\n353\n00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.830\nSo I recommend you do that\nif you're brand new to this.\n\n354\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.380\nYou'll have to register, you know\nyou'll sign in, you'll register, and\n\n355\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.830\nthen you'll get a link to download.\n\n356\n00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.820\nNow once you actually get that downloaded,\n\n357\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.070\nsave it to a location that you\nwant to be able to find that in.\n\n358\n00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.510\nSo I wanted at least show you right here,\nbut\n\n359\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:51.110\njust remember you'll have to register and\nthen you can go and download that copy.\n\n360\n00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.290\nAnd once you do that,\nI put it in my downloads folder I believe.\n\n361\n00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.228\nSo if I select downloads, here it is.\n\n362\n00:19:58.228 --> 00:20:02.760\nThe latest edition is at 12 and\nthis is actually an evaluation copy of it.\n\n363\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.870\nIt's that 12 one and\n\n364\n00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.990\nthat gives you 30 days like I said\nfrom the time you install it.\n\n365\n00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.100\nBut then you have the VMware Work Station\nand I have the 11 here for\n\n366\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.350\nus just as a demonstration.\n\n367\n00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.890\nI downloaded it.\n\n368\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.980\nIt's right there inside of my folder.\n\n369\n00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.630\nAnd once I do that, all I have to do is\nsimply double click on that installation,\n\n370\n00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:21.700\nand we'll see the process.\n\n371\n00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.900\nNow we're not gonna install it directly\nhere, because it does take a little bit of\n\n372\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.470\ntime and it can actually drop\nmy network connection here.\n\n373\n00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.830\nBut I'm just showing you at\nleast the basics here, and\n\n374\n00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.240\nthe installation process will go fairly\nquickly when we start taking a look here.\n\n375\n00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.660\nSo it brings up a nice little wizard for\nus.\n\n376\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.010\nAnd normally I just leave the defaults.\n\n377\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:44.430\nLet's take advantage, and take a look at\nsome of these defaults here, just quickly.\n\n378\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.440\nAnd notice we have that same ability,\n\n379\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.280\nbecause we are using their installer\nprogram, to repair if something happens,\n\n380\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.510\nin other words, all of a sudden,\nVMware workstation doesn't work anymore.\n\n381\n00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.100\nAfter I've installed it,\nI can come back and do a repair.\n\n382\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.430\nI can modify and change, in other words,\nI can add or remove elements,\n\n383\n00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.730\nI may not have done so before.\n\n384\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.590\nAnd so here, because I already installed\nit, you see where is has core components\n\n385\n00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.940\nand the VIX applications\nprogramming interface,\n\n386\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.800\nif you want to Script out some stuff.\n\n387\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.508\nEnhance keyboard utility\nas well as visual studio.\n\n388\n00:21:13.508 --> 00:21:16.610\nIf you're gonna be doing\nsome additional programming,\n\n389\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.690\nyou can add those components in too.\n\n390\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.300\nNow for me, I'm not actually\nworried about any of that stuff.\n\n391\n00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.610\nLet me go back here.\n\n392\n00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.570\nAnd just select Next.\n\n393\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.170\nAnd I don't wanna actually\nchange anything, so\n\n394\n00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.660\nI'm not gonna go through\nthat installation.\n\n395\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.740\nLet's go through here and then we'll see.\n\n396\n00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.590\nSo at this point,\nit's gonna take a look and\n\n397\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.930\nit's gonna see some of the systems here,\nand we're gonna cancel this in a moment.\n\n398\n00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.980\nCuz like I said,\nI already got it installed.\n\n399\n00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.810\nBut it's just gonna go through and\nthen once we actually click on it,\n\n400\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.960\nand this might reboot and might drop\nmy connection here for a moment.\n\n401\n00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.120\nIt's installing certain\npackages that we have.\n\n402\n00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.890\nWe'll see that we'll get a full\nproduct in the end if I can\n\n403\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.350\nactually get it to stop there.\n\n404\n00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.310\n>> And that's the point too during\nthe installation if I understand it right.\n\n405\n00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.940\nThat it's gonna put that software layer\nthat you were showing in that diagram\n\n406\n00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.240\nbetween the virtual machines and the\nsoftware that's running within the hosts.\n\n407\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.860\nSo, that's why it could interrupt some\nof those network communications and\n\n408\n00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.320\nstorage and stuff like that, right?\n\n409\n00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.720\n>> That is absolutely gonna be\ntrue as it's doing that and\n\n410\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.670\nthat's exactly what\nhappened to my machine.\n\n411\n00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.970\nLet me see if I can kick out of that and\nget back into my machine again.\n\n412\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.990\nSo that I can reconnect here.\n\n413\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.250\nSo let's see if it actually gives me that\nability to reconnect and there it is.\n\n414\n00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.090\nIn the end,\nit tells me that I was successful and\n\n415\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.270\nthe reason why is that I\nhad already done that.\n\n416\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:36.020\nNow after everything is actually done,\nyou're still not completely finished.\n\n417\n00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.340\nIf you're gonna be using this\nin a production environment, or\n\n418\n00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.540\nif you're gonna be using this full-time,\nall the time, past that 30-day trial,\n\n419\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.770\nyou make sure, of course, that from\nVMware, you get the proper licensing, and\n\n420\n00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.210\nthen, when you first launch this up,\nyou have a choice.\n\n421\n00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.440\nAnd you'll actually see that\nthe beginning, it'll ask you to activate.\n\n422\n00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.280\nBut, all you have to do\nis click on help and\n\n423\n00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.190\nthen you can enter an actual license key.\n\n424\n00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:02.590\nIt's a 25 key character,\nI've already got mine installed on here.\n\n425\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.190\nAnd then from that point it'll be\nactive and it'll be ready to go.\n\n426\n00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.340\nSo this is normally the environment that\nyou will see after the installation.\n\n427\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.522\nNow, here I've already created\nsome virtual machines.\n\n428\n00:23:12.522 --> 00:23:15.390\nWe're gonna be creating\none in just a moment here.\n\n429\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.322\nBut right at the beginning, we actually\nsee this nice little interface,\n\n430\n00:23:19.322 --> 00:23:21.760\nit's a tab interface as well.\n\n431\n00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.110\nSo here's what it normally looks like,\nright?\n\n432\n00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.370\nBecause VMware wants you to be\nable to get started very quickly,\n\n433\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:31.290\nit gives you these buttons right here, and\nit's actually ready to connect in multiple\n\n434\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.540\ndifferent ways to different\ntypes of machines.\n\n435\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.900\nYou wanna create a new one?\n\n436\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.960\nThis is what I would select\nright away is right here\n\n437\n00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.600\nto create a new virtual machine.\n\n438\n00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.850\nIf I wanted to open one.\n\n439\n00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:45.730\nIf I already had Virtual Machines\nthat I had created in the past and\n\n440\n00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.720\nI wanted to go ahead and also add it in\nmy console over on the left-hand side,\n\n441\n00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.580\nI could select that one.\n\n442\n00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.341\nI can also connect to another\nVMware workstation or even EXS,\n\n443\n00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:58.380\nin other words\nthe VMware Professional Edition,\n\n444\n00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.653\nto be able to actually connect\nout to a remote server.\n\n445\n00:24:01.653 --> 00:24:05.009\nAnd of course there's\nactually a VMware vCloud for\n\n446\n00:24:05.009 --> 00:24:08.921\na cloud storage and\ncloud VMs that are also up there as well.\n\n447\n00:24:08.921 --> 00:24:11.390\nThey're not actually\nstored on my location, but\n\n448\n00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.200\nactually out on VMware's premises, too.\n\n449\n00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.980\nAnd all the VMs that I end up creating,\neach one will essentially end up with\n\n450\n00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.230\na tab and some of the actual\nstuff that is installed on there.\n\n451\n00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.560\nIn the upper right hand corner, of course,\n\n452\n00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.160\nwe have what controls the entire\nwindow and the program itself.\n\n453\n00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.300\nSame type of menu that you and\nI have seen in Windows all along here.\n\n454\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.260\nWith file being able to\ncreate a new VM from here.\n\n455\n00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.870\nCreating a new window.\n\n456\n00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.570\nBeing able to actually edit, view.\n\n457\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.600\nGoing on through and seeing some of\nthe different ones that we have.\n\n458\n00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.500\nSo, what do we wanna do here?\n\n459\n00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.292\nIt's fairly simple.\n\n460\n00:24:47.292 --> 00:24:51.280\nWe wanna go ahead and create just a brand\nnew VM, and see how, remember that when we\n\n461\n00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.570\nsay a brand new VM, okay, is we're not\ntalking about a fully operational thing.\n\n462\n00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.380\nWhat we're talking about is\nvirtualizing the hardware itself.\n\n463\n00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.670\nSo, that is the first step in creating\na VM, especially in VMware Workstation.\n\n464\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.650\nSo, I'm gonna click on this plus sign and\nit's gonna give me this wizard.\n\n465\n00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:12.060\nNow, typically, if you're in a hurry\nyou select this typical option and\n\n466\n00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:17.110\nit sets pre-configurations,\ndefaults for you to actually say,\n\n467\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:21.150\noh, we'll build the hardware\nbasis off of this configuration.\n\n468\n00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:25.120\nBut this time, we're gonna go ahead and\nselect custom for a moment.\n\n469\n00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.310\nSays it's gonna create a Virtual Machine\nwith advanced options.\n\n470\n00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.860\nSuch as a SCSI controller type,\n\n471\n00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.710\nvirtual disk type compatibilities\nwith older products.\n\n472\n00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.030\nAnd I'm gonna click Next.\n\n473\n00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.960\nNow, this is something that's also\nimportant inside of VMWare that\n\n474\n00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.490\nthey want you to be aware of,\nis that VMWare has a ton of products.\n\n475\n00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:48.320\nAnd what it doesn't want to do is allow\nyou to create a VM in the newest VM stuff\n\n476\n00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.710\nthat they actually have out there and it\nnot be compatible with some of the other\n\n477\n00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:55.790\nthings that might be on your production\nnetwork that may not have upgraded yet.\n\n478\n00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.190\nSo, what they do is that they go ahead and\nthey actually go ahead and\n\n479\n00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.450\nset some of these presets here.\n\n480\n00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:04.610\nSo, if I select VM Ware Workstation,\nyou see the limitations here.\n\n481\n00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.110\n64 gigabytes of memory is what\nit's saying is the limitation.\n\n482\n00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.620\nNow, that's a lot.\n\n483\n00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.040\nI can't even imagine\nhaving 64 gigs of memory.\n\n484\n00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.840\nEach VMware Workstation VM\nhas a possibility,\n\n485\n00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.300\nthen, of supporting up to 16 processors.\n\n486\n00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.490\nNow, this is what we\ncall logical processors.\n\n487\n00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:30.500\nSo, in theory, right, if you have four\nquad core processors on your computer.\n\n488\n00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.240\nAnd so, each of them is actually,\n\n489\n00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.940\neach of those four processes,\neach are four quad cores.\n\n490\n00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.600\nIt can do this.\n\n491\n00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.380\nSo, the processor number is what we\ncall 16 logical processors are possible.\n\n492\n00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.600\nSo, when I told you two earlier,\nI was mistaken.\n\n493\n00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.280\nSo, here it's more than likely being\nable to support up to 16 of them.\n\n494\n00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.390\nBy default,\nit can support ten network adapters.\n\n495\n00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:57.170\nNow, that's actually a big jump\nthat we have compared to the other\n\n496\n00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.770\ntype II Hypervisor that we\nwere looking at as well.\n\n497\n00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.170\nAnd they've gone ahead and\nwent ahead and put this in there.\n\n498\n00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:03.780\nAnd, normally,\n\n499\n00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.760\ninside of a virtual box you have four by\ndefault that you can actually create.\n\n500\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.950\nBut if want to actually\nto do an additional four,\n\n501\n00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.545\nyou have to actually break\ndown into the command line and\n\n502\n00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:17.650\nthat VM box command language to be\nable to add an additional four.\n\n503\n00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:19.540\nHere they go ahead and give you ten.\n\n504\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.820\nOf course, then a maximum terrabyte,\neight terrabyte disk size.\n\n505\n00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.420\nSo, when I think about a test machine,\n\n506\n00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.300\nthat would be insane if I could\nactually do something like that.\n\n507\n00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.360\nCuz I have really big machine\nto be able to work in.\n\n508\n00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.530\nSo, by default, they go ahead and\n\n509\n00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:39.210\nthey actually put two different\ncompatibility versions here.\n\n510\n00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.990\nOne is for VMWare Fusion 7.0.\n\n511\n00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.980\nAnd the other one here is for\nWork Station 11.\n\n512\n00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.414\nAnd you might say Fusion?\n\n513\n00:27:46.414 --> 00:27:49.120\nFusion?\nWhat is this Fusion thing about?\n\n514\n00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.540\nWell, inside of VMware,\nthere's two type two products, and\n\n515\n00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.890\nmaybe even a little bit more.\n\n516\n00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:57.020\nBut the one that you and I would actually\nend up being familiar with, is if we're\n\n517\n00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:02.300\nrunning Windows, or a Linux operating\nsystem, VMware Work Station is the way for\n\n518\n00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.280\nus to go if we're interested\nin the type two Hypervisor.\n\n519\n00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:05.920\nOkay?\n\n520\n00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.575\nBut what if you're running\na MacBook Pro like I'm running?\n\n521\n00:28:09.575 --> 00:28:12.610\nWell, what you want to actually run\ninstead is the one that's designed for\n\n522\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.850\nthe MacBook, which is gonna\nbe one called VMware Fusion.\n\n523\n00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.520\nSo, it's kinda the equivalent product for\nMac,\n\n524\n00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.510\nis what you're actually gonna see here.\n\n525\n00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:25.730\nWhereas Workstation is actually designed\nfor Windows and, of course, Linux users.\n\n526\n00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.600\nOn both of them, you're gonna\nactually need a 64-bit processor,\n\n527\n00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.920\nis what you're gonna need here.\n\n528\n00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.370\nSo, I'm just gonna leave it at\nthe default and then click Next here.\n\n529\n00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.620\nNow, at this point, it also gives\nme the ability to go ahead and\n\n530\n00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.510\nadd in my installation disk for whatever\noperating system I wanna put on it.\n\n531\n00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.660\nI'm gonna do that a little bit later,\npossibly in another show.\n\n532\n00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.630\nSo, I'm gonna select this third option\nthat says I'll install that later on.\n\n533\n00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.160\nAnd click Next from here.\n\n534\n00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.270\nAnd now, it's gonna ask me what operating\nsystem I want to be able to install.\n\n535\n00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.540\nNow, it does support Windows\noperating systems, Linux,\n\n536\n00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:01.380\nDistros, Novell network, for those of you\nthat absolutely wanna be able to do that.\n\n537\n00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:08.167\nEven Solaris, and, of course,\nE X, why can't I say it?\n\n538\n00:29:08.167 --> 00:29:10.180\nESX.\n\n539\n00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.220\nThe VMware type one hypervisor,\nthey're saying you can go in and\n\n540\n00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.170\ninstall that on here if you want to.\n\n541\n00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.900\nAnd the reason why you and\nI might do that is just for testing.\n\n542\n00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.730\nWe can't run VMs in that.\n\n543\n00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.430\nBut we can at least install\nthat if we want to.\n\n544\n00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.900\nBecause it does function\nlike an operating system.\n\n545\n00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.260\nAnd then, if there's another possibility\nof another one that's also different, too.\n\n546\n00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.380\nSo, I'm just gonna select this Linux one.\n\n547\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.190\nWe're gonna install Set OS\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n548\n00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.110\nIn the virtual box, we installed\na Windows 10 or, no, a Server 2000.\n\n549\n00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.890\nI couldn't remember which one.\n\n550\n00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.900\nWe installed a server in 2008.\n\n551\n00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.940\nBut here we're gonna install a CentOS.\n\n552\n00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.950\nI already installed a Windows operating\nsystem, so what we'll choose is CentOS.\n\n553\n00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.660\nAnd it's gonna be 64 bit.\n\n554\n00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.660\nClick next.\n\n555\n00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.560\nAnd now it's gonna ask me for a name.\n\n556\n00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.420\nAnd we'll call this one lab zero three.\n\n557\n00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.230\nAnd you can see on the left-hand\nside I don't have that.\n\n558\n00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.810\nSo, this is gonna be brand new.\n\n559\n00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.130\nAnd now it's gonna ask me\nwhere I'd like to store these.\n\n560\n00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.800\nI can leave it at the default\nif I remember it.\n\n561\n00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.330\nBut if I click browse,\n\n562\n00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.810\nI can also leave it in a folder\ninstead in where I want it to be.\n\n563\n00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.549\nAnd so, I had a folder that\nI've made that was called VM's.\n\n564\n00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:16.412\nAnd then, I'm gonna click there,\nand I'm gonna make a new folder.\n\n565\n00:30:16.412 --> 00:30:19.730\nI I''ll call this one lab zero three.\n\n566\n00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:23.050\nClick okay.\nAnd then click next there.\n\n567\n00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.520\nAnd now,\nit's gonna ask me about my processors.\n\n568\n00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.790\nI can always change this\na little bit later on.\n\n569\n00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.430\nSo, I'm gonna do that later on instead.\n\n570\n00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.270\nI'm gonna leave it at its default.\n\n571\n00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.480\nClick next.\n\n572\n00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.344\nHow much RAM?\n\n573\n00:30:33.344 --> 00:30:35.922\nIt has recommendations for me, as well.\n\n574\n00:30:35.922 --> 00:30:40.353\nThe minimum, the guess is recommended,\nit's 512 even for the CentOS.\n\n575\n00:30:40.353 --> 00:30:41.982\nRecommend is about a gig.\n\n576\n00:30:41.982 --> 00:30:45.270\nMaximum I could get looks\nlike about 6 gigs or so.\n\n577\n00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:45.850\nOkay?\n\n578\n00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:49.970\nSo, I'm gonna leave it at its\nrecommended memory instead.\n\n579\n00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:55.140\nI can adjust it by, of course, using this\ntoggle, or by using the spin up box here.\n\n580\n00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.640\nSo, it just depends on what you\nactually want to be able to do.\n\n581\n00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.900\nI'm gonna leave that at the recommended.\n\n582\n00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.920\nClick next.\n\n583\n00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.960\nAnd now, there's some network adapters.\n\n584\n00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.650\nWe're gonna leave this at the default.\n\n585\n00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.720\nOr actually I can choose, let's just\nchoose not to connect it for right now and\n\n586\n00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.260\nwe'll configure that one also\nlater one once we actually\n\n587\n00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.150\nget in some configuration here.\n\n588\n00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.180\nClick next.\n\n589\n00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.360\nAnd now, it's also asking me about,\nof course,\n\n590\n00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.910\nmy input output controller\nto the hard drive.\n\n591\n00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.400\nit has a standard recommendation\nhere which is this LSI logic.\n\n592\n00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.780\nIf I had to serial attach SCSI,\nI could also do that.\n\n593\n00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.040\nAnd this is where we're trying to\nactually mimic the software or\n\n594\n00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.170\nthe hardware controller\nthat we really want.\n\n595\n00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:35.410\nI'm gonna leave it at the LSI logic,\njust as a default.\n\n596\n00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:39.780\nAnd it also recommends\na SCSI driver as well.\n\n597\n00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.930\nNow, we can do that.\n\n598\n00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.690\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n599\n00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:46.900\nThis is what WorkStation really likes,\nand it's not gonna hurt anything.\n\n600\n00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.900\nIf you really like serial ATA,\nyou'll do this.\n\n601\n00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.450\nIf you're trying to mimic an older\nWindows machine for the IDE controllers,\n\n602\n00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.330\nyou can also do that.\n\n603\n00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.420\nOr I'm gonna leave it\nin default right here.\n\n604\n00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.420\nAnd it's gonna ask me if I wanna create\na new one or actually add in one.\n\n605\n00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.680\nWe're gonna create a new\nvirtual hard drive.\n\n606\n00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.390\nAnd now, it's asking about the size.\n\n607\n00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.620\nPerfectly fine.\n\n608\n00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.591\nWe're gonna leave the size here.\n\n609\n00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:10.720\nNow, the only other thing that we have\navailable to us is whether or not we\n\n610\n00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.275\nactually want this particular hard drive\nto allocate all of the disk space now.\n\n611\n00:32:15.275 --> 00:32:16.597\nNow, what is that actually about?\n\n612\n00:32:16.597 --> 00:32:19.990\nIf you actually use something this, this\nis what we call creating a static drive.\n\n613\n00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.960\nAnd that means this is gonna\nactually create a file that's gonna\n\n614\n00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.780\nrepresent the hard drive.\n\n615\n00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.820\nAnd it's gonna be a 20 gig file, okay.\n\n616\n00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.700\nSo, is there anything on it?\n\n617\n00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.620\nNo, but\nit's gonna actually be 20 gigs in size.\n\n618\n00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:37.050\nBy leaving it at this one, store\nthe virtual hard disk as a single file,\n\n619\n00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.020\nit can expand and it can contract.\n\n620\n00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.550\nAs it actually needs it.\n\n621\n00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.490\nThe maximum size of this\nthing would be 20 gigs.\n\n622\n00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.870\nSo, in a testing environment\nthis is the way to go,\n\n623\n00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:51.580\nin a production environment\nallocating the disk space now so\n\n624\n00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.230\nthat actually becomes a static\nfile is the way to go.\n\n625\n00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.010\nThat's an easy delineation that you and\nI can make right now.\n\n626\n00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.920\nAnd then click Next.\n\n627\n00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.860\nAnd now it's gonna say is this actually\ngonna be the name of the file that I want.\n\n628\n00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.420\nAnd that's fine for me.\n\n629\n00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.770\nI'm gonna click Next here and\nthen click Finish.\n\n630\n00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.180\nNow, as underwhelming as it is.\n\n631\n00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.830\nWes, I have just created\nmy virtual machine\n\n632\n00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.250\nright here inside of VMWare work station.\n\n633\n00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:23.000\nNow, it's not a fully operational\nmachine in terms of me turning it on and\n\n634\n00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.260\njumping right on it and\ngetting on to the internet.\n\n635\n00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:25.850\nOkay.\n\n636\n00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:29.480\nBut I can do some of those\nvery simple things here.\n\n637\n00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:34.120\nSo, I can selected that Lab03 and right\nhere right next to it you can see where it\n\n638\n00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.515\nsays power on this virtual machine and\nI can select that link here, maybe.\n\n639\n00:33:39.515 --> 00:33:42.470\nAnd if my machine there it goes.\n\n640\n00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:46.380\nIt's now turning on just like I pushed\nthe power button for the first time and\n\n641\n00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:52.678\nit's gonna find something that we expect\nto see Operating system not found.\n\n642\n00:33:52.678 --> 00:33:53.310\nOkay?\n\n643\n00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.000\nBut what is actually found then?\n\n644\n00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.850\nSo, if I go ahead, and let me get back\non the lab station here and take a look,\n\n645\n00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:06.100\noh let me close that out, I turn off, I'm\ngonna power off this thing for a moment.\n\n646\n00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:08.620\nOn this tab.\n\n647\n00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.710\nI can see all the specifications for this.\n\n648\n00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:18.840\nSo, remember that the VM than,\nin VM workstation is a file and\n\n649\n00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.570\nit's giving me all of\nthe specs of the hardware.\n\n650\n00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:26.780\nIt also of course immolates that and gives\nme a file that represents the hard drive.\n\n651\n00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.640\nSo, that when I get ready to install an\noperating system, what's gonna happen is\n\n652\n00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.640\nthat the operating system's gonna\nbegin this installation process.\n\n653\n00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.710\nIt's gonna look for the hardware, and\n\n654\n00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:38.690\nthis file's gonna report this\nhardware that we see over here to it.\n\n655\n00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.510\nAnd it's also gonna look for\nhard drive, and\n\n656\n00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.530\nit's gonna point it to that hard drive.\n\n657\n00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:47.220\nAnd it will essentially fool\nthe operating system during the install\n\n658\n00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.770\nprocess into thinking that this is an\nactual machine that it can actually run.\n\n659\n00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:58.350\nSo, there it is, that is actually\nour VM even without an operating\n\n660\n00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:03.120\nsystem on it at some point, but\nwe're not so worried about that and\n\n661\n00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.530\nthe reason why is because well, you\nknow how to install an operating system.\n\n662\n00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.490\nAnd that's gonna be the key.\n\n663\n00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:11.480\nAnd we're actually gonna show at least\nthe beginning process of that, but\n\n664\n00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.460\nin another show.\n\n665\n00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.230\nAnd the reason why is, Wes,\nyou let me talk too long.\n\n666\n00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.210\n>> Oh, yeah.\nWell, thank you, Ronnie, very much.\n\n667\n00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:20.890\nAnd we've looked in this episode at\ninstalling VMWare Workstation on\n\n668\n00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:21.910\nyour machines.\n\n669\n00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.110\nWe've looked at what the requirements are\nfor the software, VM Workstation itself.\n\n670\n00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:30.490\nWe've also looked at what the requirements\nare for the hardware in the host operating\n\n671\n00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:34.220\nsystem as well as what you might need for\nthe guest operating systems.\n\n672\n00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.760\nKeep in mind that you do\nhave to do your research.\n\n673\n00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.450\nWhatever virtualization\nplatform you're gonna use.\n\n674\n00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.790\nIncluding something like\nVMware workstation.\n\n675\n00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.010\nMake sure that you're aware\nwhat the software itself takes.\n\n676\n00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.870\nThe host operating system,\nwhat's gonna be require to run.\n\n677\n00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:51.180\nAnd the gonna be contingent on how many\nvirtual machines you're gonna run.\n\n678\n00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.490\nAnd then also look what the requirements\nare for the operating systems.\n\n679\n00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.980\nRemember, minimum is not best.\n\n680\n00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.530\nEspecially when you're testing software.\n\n681\n00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.660\nWell Ronnie, anything else for\nus on this one?\n\n682\n00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.730\n>> Well, I just kinda remember.\n\n683\n00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:02.610\nThis is at least the basics right?\n\n684\n00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.870\nAnd even though we took a little bit of\na painstaking process to walk through it,\n\n685\n00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:09.820\nit's very important that we at least\nunderstand that at the very beginning.\n\n686\n00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.730\nThat it does require a little bit\nof planning and getting it right.\n\n687\n00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:17.200\nYou know, the first time is some of the\ndetails that we need to pay attention to.\n\n688\n00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.560\nIt's easy to get a VM up and running and\nget an operating system installed on it.\n\n689\n00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.360\nSo we still have a lot to go because,\n\n690\n00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.590\neven though we install an operating system\ndoesn't mean that it's ready to go.\n\n691\n00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.280\nAnd we've still got episodes we're\ngonna talk about configuring that, and\n\n692\n00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.020\nthen even more advanced options.\n\n693\n00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.520\nSo you should stay tuned for\nour future episodes here.\n\n694\n00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.560\n>> All right, very good.\n\n695\n00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.180\nWell, Ronnie, thanks for that information.\n\n696\n00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.610\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n697\n00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.410\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n698\n00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.170\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n699\n00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:41.865\n>> And we'll see ya next time.\n\n700\n00:36:41.865 --> 00:36:48.800\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.265\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.400\nwe're gonna be moving along in\nvirtualization technologies.\n\n5\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.140\nAnd in the previous episode,\nwe showed you how to\n\n6\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.010\nconfigure the virtualized hardware that\nyou can find in a VMware workstation VM.\n\n7\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.710\nBut that VM by itself really\nisn't gonna do us any good in our\n\n8\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.808\nproduction environment.\n\n9\n00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:32.500\nSo in today's episode,\n\n10\n00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.150\nwhat we're gonna to be looking at\nis how to configure the VM itself.\n\n11\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.090\nAnd who do we have here to\nshow us this process here?\n\n12\n00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.300\nWe got Ronnie Wong.\n\n13\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.280\nHow you doing Ronnie?\n\n14\n00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.330\n>> I'm doing fine.\n\n15\n00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.460\nWes is right.\n\n16\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.620\nThe very fact that we\nhave a VM ready to go,\n\n17\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.990\ndoesn't mean that it's\nactually gonna do us any good.\n\n18\n00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.250\nIt is like if we built our own PC and\njust okay, we're done.\n\n19\n00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.237\nWell the problem that we have of course\nthen, is that we need to configure and\n\n20\n00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:58.879\nwe need to actually get it up and running.\n\n21\n00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.906\nAnd that's what we're going to actually\ntake a look at as we get started here,\n\n22\n00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:04.625\nis getting our VM up and running.\n\n23\n00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:08.183\nAnd some of the things we need to make\nsure of before we even get started, and\n\n24\n00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:11.740\nthen we'll take a look a little\nbit at the installation process.\n\n25\n00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.150\nBut then also,\n\n26\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.280\nsome of the other things what we can do\nonce we have a VM configured there on.\n\n27\n00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.350\nSo let's go and jump right in so\nwe understand what we're seeing here.\n\n28\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.110\nSo here it is.\n\n29\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.510\nI'm running VMware workstation 11.\n\n30\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.200\nAnd what we did in the previous episode\nis that we created this Lab03 VM.\n\n31\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.960\nRemember that the VM itself is just a\nconfiguration file that essentially says,\n\n32\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.930\nhere's the hardware that I'm actually\ngoing to tell you to go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.160\nvirtualize, right?\n\n34\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.099\nSo it's gonna give me a gigabyte of RAM,\n\n35\n00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.211\nit's gonna give me a single processor,\na 20 gig hard drive as well.\n\n36\n00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:52.646\nAnd then we're actually going to take\na look at this CD here in a moment,\n\n37\n00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:56.930\nand then some other hardware that I can\nactually say is present or not present.\n\n38\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.770\nAnd here inside of VMware Workstation,\n\n39\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.070\nit gives me the ability to also detect\nif I have that stuff connected too.\n\n40\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.355\n>> Now in that last episode, and if you\nhaven't seen that episode go check it out,\n\n41\n00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:09.150\ncuz it does show you how\nto get this up and running.\n\n42\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.910\nRonny, can we make any\nconfiguration to the hardware?\n\n43\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.110\nIf I create one of these virtual machines,\n\n44\n00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.450\nam I just gonna be stuck\nwith where that hardware is?\n\n45\n00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.421\nFor instance, let me give you an example\nwhat if I decide that I give it\n\n46\n00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:23.036\na gig of RAM and I'm looking at\nthe software requirements for\n\n47\n00:02:23.036 --> 00:02:25.923\na piece of software that I'm\ninstalling and it says you know what?\n\n48\n00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:29.175\nIt's not going to run on 1 gig of ram,\nit's going to run on 2 gigs of ram.\n\n49\n00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.752\nCan we make, let's say,\npost configurations?\n\n50\n00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:33.980\n>> You are going to be able\nto actually make changes,\n\n51\n00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.586\nnot only where we're going to do it right\nnow, we're also going to be able to do it\n\n52\n00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:40.272\neven after we get the virtual\nmachine up and running, too.\n\n53\n00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:42.950\nSo one of the first things\nthat we want to do, of course,\n\n54\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.500\nis I need to be able to get\nan operating system on that VM,\n\n55\n00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.070\nand get it powered up and\nready to run, is what I want to do.\n\n56\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.450\nAnd then we'll make some changes later\non as to what Wes was talking about\n\n57\n00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.380\nto give us what we need as well.\n\n58\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.530\nIf we figure out that we\ndidn't actually give it\n\n59\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.100\nenough of the hardware requirement.\n\n60\n00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.410\nSo the way that we do that, is now I\nneed to actually be able to do that.\n\n61\n00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.530\nNow, on a physical\nmachine how do I do that?\n\n62\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.258\nWell, I can go out to Microsoft, and\n\n63\n00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:12.837\nI can download an ISO file of\nthe operating system that I want.\n\n64\n00:03:12.837 --> 00:03:17.127\nIf I'm running Windows, I can go out\nto any of the Linux distro sites,\n\n65\n00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:21.271\nbe able to download a torrent if I\nwant that will also give me the ISO or\n\n66\n00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:24.410\nmaybe even directly an ISO itself as well.\n\n67\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.240\nAnd I have two options once I\ndownload that installation source.\n\n68\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.260\nI can go ahead and\nburn it to a physical DVD if I want to.\n\n69\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.256\nSo I can take any of my software burning,\nISO burning software,\n\n70\n00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:41.178\nburn that to an actual ISO,\nput it in the physical machine, and\n\n71\n00:03:41.178 --> 00:03:45.026\nthe nice thing is if the VMware\nis actually up and running, you\n\n72\n00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:49.863\nactually notice that in mine here it says\nthat the CD and DVD is on auto detect.\n\n73\n00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:51.222\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n74\n00:03:51.222 --> 00:03:55.000\nThat means that it can actually\ntake a look at the physical CD and\n\n75\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.633\nverify that there is something that is\nbootable on that drive and be able to use\n\n76\n00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:04.740\nit when I go ahead and turn the machine\non to install the operating system.\n\n77\n00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.950\nNow even though that's actually one way\nwe can do it, it's not the only method.\n\n78\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.320\nThe favorite method that I like doing, the\nonly one that I've been actually doing for\n\n79\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.790\nyears and\nyears is directly off the file itself.\n\n80\n00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.760\nSo now if I go ahead and\nI have a couple of option that I can do.\n\n81\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.190\nNotice if I hover over it, I can actually\nclick and select that option itself.\n\n82\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.050\nOr I can right click on lab03,\ngo down to Settings, and\n\n83\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.020\nalso choose this option, too.\n\n84\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.090\nBut this is what it does by actually\njust clicking on that CD DVD itself.\n\n85\n00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.630\nIt brings up my virtual machine settings,,\nand it's right here, notice that all of\n\n86\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.530\nthese option's on the right hand side of\nthe hardware options are configurable.\n\n87\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.950\nAnd you can see all of them,\nthey're all highlighted,\n\n88\n00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.780\nnone of them are actually grayed out.\n\n89\n00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.840\nAnything that you see right here\nis actually going to be well\n\n90\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.940\nreadily available for you to change.\n\n91\n00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.754\nNow the caveat here though,\nis fairly simple, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:56.754 --> 00:05:00.072\nWhen we talk about the idea of\nchanging some of this stuff,\n\n93\n00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:04.070\nwhat you've gotta realize is that\nsometimes this will be grayed out,\n\n94\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.800\nsome of these options will be grayed out.\n\n95\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.930\nYou might be wondering like why\nwhen in the world are these options\n\n96\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.633\ngonna be grayed out?\n\n97\n00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:10.585\nWhy can't I change it?\n\n98\n00:05:10.585 --> 00:05:14.855\nIf you have the actual VM running, I was\ntrying to figure out what I was gonna say\n\n99\n00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:17.184\nthere, if you have the actual VM running,\n\n100\n00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:21.740\nyou may see where it won't give you that\noption to be able to change configuration.\n\n101\n00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.790\nSo the rule of thumb is fairly simple.\n\n102\n00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.120\nIn a physical machine, if Wes were to say\nI need to add in a couple of gigs of RAM,\n\n103\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.520\nright, and he knows that the standard\nprocedure is to power down that physical\n\n104\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.270\nmachine so that he can install that RAM,\nwell normally you would take that same\n\n105\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.240\nbest practice in the VMware as well,\nwhere you shut down that machine.\n\n106\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.580\nAnd then once you shut it down,\nthen you can come in here and\n\n107\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.500\nchange that RAM like what\nWes was talking about.\n\n108\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.770\nSame thing with the processor, and\n\n109\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.050\nsometimes even with the hard drive\nas well, and we're going to get into\n\n110\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.900\nanother episode there about some\nof these configurations too.\n\n111\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.060\nBut the one that I wanna focus in on\nright now is actually going to be the CD\n\n112\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.420\nand DVD.\n\n113\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.360\nIf I want to install an operating\nsystem I have to actually be able to\n\n114\n00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.610\nput in another bootable device, that\nwill then allow me to connect to it and\n\n115\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.340\ninstall an operating system.\n\n116\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.500\nSo notice that this one is actually\nconnected at power on, and\n\n117\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.580\nthen I can use the physical\ndrive to auto-detect.\n\n118\n00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.995\nNow if I had one it'd be simple enough,\njust put in there and\n\n119\n00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:29.870\nit auto detects it and you'll see\nthe name of that DVD listed right there.\n\n120\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.230\nThe other one is what I talked\nabout in using an ISO image.\n\n121\n00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.940\nNow, I already have a little\nportable USB drive attached\n\n122\n00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.300\ninside of a folder called ISO there.\n\n123\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.478\nAnd I'm gonna click on that drop down and\nyou can actually see that there's many.\n\n124\n00:06:42.478 --> 00:06:47.080\nIf I clicked on browse, you can see I've\ngot a lot of different ISOs listed here\n\n125\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.838\nand I can choose any of those.\n\n126\n00:06:48.838 --> 00:06:53.633\nThe one that I've already chosen though,\nhas already been prepopulated here,\n\n127\n00:06:53.633 --> 00:06:59.370\nwhich is that CentOS 6.5 edition and it's\nactually just a DVD of this entire thing.\n\n128\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.012\nSo I'm actually saying that I'm going\nto use that for my installation files.\n\n129\n00:07:03.012 --> 00:07:07.719\nIf I click on this advance button, it also\ngive me a chance to actually configure\n\n130\n00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:13.170\nsome of these other additional setting on\nthe controller that I want this going to.\n\n131\n00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.930\nThe standard default for\nall of the physical CD and\n\n132\n00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.420\nDVD drives is going to be IDE.\n\n133\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.737\nSo I'm just going to leave it as is and\nthat should normally work for\n\n134\n00:07:22.737 --> 00:07:24.586\nanything that we need it to work for.\n\n135\n00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:29.242\nSo by simply putting that in, that is\nequivalent to me saying in this virtual\n\n136\n00:07:29.242 --> 00:07:34.550\nmachine I've just pushed the eject button\non the DVD player and it's ejecting out.\n\n137\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.470\nI've now inserted the ISO, which\n\n138\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.310\nthe file that acts as a DVD, and\nI've now closed the door on that.\n\n139\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.860\n>> All right, so, the other thing\nI need to do now is go ahead and\n\n140\n00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.750\npower this machine on now that I\nhave my installation media inside.\n\n141\n00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.820\nSo I simply power the machine on and\nyou can see it turn on here.\n\n142\n00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.614\nAnd it's starting to give\nme a little bit of warning.\n\n143\n00:07:54.614 --> 00:07:58.385\nThere it is,\nthe CentOS install is continuing on here.\n\n144\n00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:00.359\nAnd I, of course, would chose this,\n\n145\n00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:04.002\nand this is just a normal operation\nthat as I click inside that window,\n\n146\n00:08:04.002 --> 00:08:07.706\nI'm now just using my arrow key so\nthat I can actually be able to navigate\n\n147\n00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:11.770\nthrough them, I'm gonna do a simple\ninstall, and it's beginning to load.\n\n148\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.380\nSo here is where VMware Workstation\n\n149\n00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.460\nis really lying to\nthe operating system install.\n\n150\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.350\nIt's reporting all that hardware,\nCentOS is now taking a look and\n\n151\n00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.150\nactually expanding out\nthe files that it needs to.\n\n152\n00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.120\nAnd it is, it's actually saying,\nhey, I see a physical machine.\n\n153\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.030\n>> You talk about that hypervisor\nlying to the operating system.\n\n154\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.400\nIf you think about it, this is really\nnothing more than a legal root kit.\n\n155\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.310\nI mean essentially that's\nwhat a root kit does, right?\n\n156\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.710\nIt lies to the operating\nsystem that controls it, so\n\n157\n00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.360\nthe hypervisor almost sounds\nlike a legal form of a root kit.\n\n158\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.640\nNow, Ronnie, one of the things that\nI've noticed about the install is\n\n159\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.590\nonce you've got the machine configured,\nthe installation really just looks like\n\n160\n00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.090\na basic installation of\nan operating system, no different.\n\n161\n00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.430\n>> That's exactly what's\ngonna end up happening here,\n\n162\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.830\nso you do want to make sure that you\njust follow along the process here.\n\n163\n00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.760\nNow at this point, notice it's actually\ngonna ask if I want to test this.\n\n164\n00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.800\nIn a production environment,\n\n165\n00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.260\nyou definitely would go through the test\nto verify that all your hardware is good.\n\n166\n00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.250\nIn our testing environment,\nwe're simply going to skip it.\n\n167\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.830\nAnd then it should actually finish\nthe rest of the install process\n\n168\n00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.650\nas it goes through.\n\n169\n00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.720\nAnd there it is, it's found\nthe local installation media and\n\n170\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.822\nnow as it actually goes on through it\nis now going to take it's sweet time.\n\n171\n00:09:20.822 --> 00:09:25.710\nAnd then it actually requires me to follow\nalong the steps here, the language that\n\n172\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.695\nI'm gonna end up choosing to install,\nand then where is it gonna install to.\n\n173\n00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:35.510\nAnd if I'm actually wiping out any of the\ndata, or am I keeping some of that data?\n\n174\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.370\nI'm gonna discard it all, and then a name,\nand we'll call this one Lab03.\n\n175\n00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.629\nAnd I'm just hitting the Enter key\nas it's already selected that.\n\n176\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:51.390\nAnd so you see where this is that\nprocess that we would go through\n\n177\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.120\neven if it was a physical machine here.\n\n178\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.220\nI'll just use a simple fake password, and\n\n179\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.650\nhow am I gonna partition the hard\ndrive is what it's asking me about.\n\n180\n00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.170\nAnd then I'm hitting Next, and\ntelling it to make those changes.\n\n181\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.650\nFrom this point on, it is,\nit's just a regular install.\n\n182\n00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.380\nNow even though it's sent CentOS and\nit's a fairly light install process,\n\n183\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.670\nthere's gonna come a time when it adds\npackages in and what the selections are.\n\n184\n00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.790\nI'm just gonna leave the default here.\n\n185\n00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:22.420\nTell it to install the entire\ndesktop system and everything.\n\n186\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.950\nBut it's like over a thousand packages,\n\n187\n00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.160\nso it's gonna take a bit of time as it\nactually goes through the install process.\n\n188\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.280\nSo what should happen though in the end,\nis this.\n\n189\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.220\nSo I went ahead and\nset this up as another operating system.\n\n190\n00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.190\nIt's the same thing, but\nit's now fully done and ready to go.\n\n191\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.030\nSo it's gonna reboot here, and\n\n192\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.050\nthat's what you'll see at the end of\nthat process is that it will reboot.\n\n193\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.840\nYou may still have to actually add in\na little bit of configuration in the end,\n\n194\n00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.930\nbut it should install and you should\nsee something that looks like this\n\n195\n00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.030\nas it goes through\nthe installation process.\n\n196\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:11:00.538\nAnd we should be done, and ready to go\nonce the operation system is up, right.\n\n197\n00:11:00.538 --> 00:11:05.400\nEven so, right, once the operating system\nis up, we are not completely done.\n\n198\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.520\nThere are still some things that\nwe need to pay attention to,\n\n199\n00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.310\nthat we need to make sure\nthat we do follow through on,\n\n200\n00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.510\nduring the install to make it\nwork the way that we need to.\n\n201\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.040\nVirtual machines, and\nthey are, they're wonderful,\n\n202\n00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.650\nthey do just about everything\nthat we want them to do.\n\n203\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.510\nBut it does take a little bit of time\nbefore they're actually ready for\n\n204\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.160\ntrue operational use here.\n\n205\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.143\nSo let's go back to my machine\nhere in just a moment.\n\n206\n00:11:29.143 --> 00:11:34.415\nAnd so you end up giving it a name\nthat you're going to log in as,\n\n207\n00:11:34.415 --> 00:11:37.710\nand then, of course, your password.\n\n208\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.588\nAnd it's gonna build a profile\nthe first time you end up logging in so\n\n209\n00:11:41.588 --> 00:11:44.308\nit may take a little bit\nlonger that first time,\n\n210\n00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:48.930\nbut every other time should actually\nbe perfectly fine and ready to go.\n\n211\n00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.700\nNow, if everything is actually done and\n\n212\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.570\ncomplete, this is what\nit should look like.\n\n213\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:58.540\nAnd from this point on,\nyou should end up being able to use it,\n\n214\n00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.060\nat least at the beginning,\nto explore around.\n\n215\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.375\nBut then there's still some other\nconfiguration options that we need to\n\n216\n00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:05.472\nthink about, as well.\n\n217\n00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:10.498\nAnd one of the most important\nconfiguration options is what\n\n218\n00:12:10.498 --> 00:12:15.538\nwe call installing the actual VM Tools,\nis what we call it.\n\n219\n00:12:15.538 --> 00:12:19.441\nAnd, Wes, we've talked about this idea\nbefore that even though virtual machines\n\n220\n00:12:19.441 --> 00:12:22.114\nare created and\nwe can install an operating system on it,\n\n221\n00:12:22.114 --> 00:12:25.513\nthere is times where it was doing\nexactly what it did during the install,\n\n222\n00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:28.660\nwhere it locked my mouse up and\nI couldn't get it out of the screen.\n\n223\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.935\nBut there's ways we can take care of that,\nright?\n\n224\n00:12:30.935 --> 00:12:35.635\n>> Yeah, definitely, now, so when I think\nabout post-installation tasks after\n\n225\n00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:38.757\ninstalling the operating system,\nI think of, in a Window's environment,\n\n226\n00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:40.642\nright, you think about activation and\nyou think about updates.\n\n227\n00:12:40.642 --> 00:12:44.992\nBut now the VMware tools here are gonna\nmanage things like communication,\n\n228\n00:12:44.992 --> 00:12:46.687\nmaybe the drivers.\n\n229\n00:12:46.687 --> 00:12:51.192\nCuz one of the things that I've noticed,\nfor instance, if you install a VM, or\n\n230\n00:12:51.192 --> 00:12:56.046\ncreate a VM inside of the the VMware\nFusion, right, I can go in there and\n\n231\n00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:58.816\nI can look at all my drivers and\ndevice manager inside of Windows, and\n\n232\n00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:00.236\nI got question marks everywhere.\n\n233\n00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:03.286\nAnd it seems like the hypervisor,\neven though it is to some degree,\n\n234\n00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:06.923\nit's managing the communication between\nthe hardware and the the operating system,\n\n235\n00:13:06.923 --> 00:13:11.033\nitself, it kind of seems like, without\nthe VMware tools, it still falls a little\n\n236\n00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:13.833\nbit short on its performance in\nmanaging that communication.\n\n237\n00:13:13.833 --> 00:13:15.083\nIs that what we're looking at here?\n\n238\n00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:16.113\n>> It really is.\n\n239\n00:13:16.113 --> 00:13:19.217\nIf you've heard us actually mention,\nlike in VirtualBox,\n\n240\n00:13:19.217 --> 00:13:21.863\nthey called them VMware additions.\n\n241\n00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:25.440\nIn Microsoft's Hyper-V,\nthey call them the integration tools.\n\n242\n00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.510\nAnd it was really designed to\nenhance the performance of your VM,\n\n243\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.250\nworking on that system.\n\n244\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.070\nAnd normally what is does\nis it includes in drivers,\n\n245\n00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.258\nit includes in things like\nthe ability to do PXE booting,\n\n246\n00:13:37.258 --> 00:13:41.580\nit includes in some other things that\nyou and I would normally take for\n\n247\n00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.480\ngranted that aren't gonna appear\nin the virtual machine right away.\n\n248\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.290\nInside of VMware they call\nthem the VMware Tools.\n\n249\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.480\nAnd these really do add in some\nenhancements to the functionality.\n\n250\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.270\nAnd one of those enhancements\nis that ability to move in and\n\n251\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:14:00.490\nout of that VM without having to push\nmy host key, which is the Ctrl and\n\n252\n00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:05.000\nthe Alt key, in this instance here,\nso I can get out of that machine.\n\n253\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.110\nNow on this one it's went ahead and\nit's been installed on here.\n\n254\n00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.650\nI'm gonna check back at this lab machine\nand see, and there it goes it's still\n\n255\n00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.290\ninstalling, I wasn't sure if we\nwere actually able to see that.\n\n256\n00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.590\nSo when we do this for Windows,\nit's fairly simple, right.\n\n257\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:25.188\nIf I need to install in the VMware Tools,\nI just right-click, oops well maybe.\n\n258\n00:14:25.188 --> 00:14:28.290\nI just right-click on\nthat virtual machine, and\n\n259\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.210\nthen you can select where it says right\nhere, like Reinstall VMware Tools,\n\n260\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:37.060\nor if it's our first time it would\nactually be install the Vmware Tools here.\n\n261\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.788\nSo, there it is,\nit actually mounts a virtual CD and\n\n262\n00:14:39.788 --> 00:14:43.860\nit's gonna actually allow\nme to install them again.\n\n263\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.020\nNow remember that inside of Windows\nit's fairly easy, it's an executable,\n\n264\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.200\nyou'll actually see an ISO mount.\n\n265\n00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.620\nAnd then you'll run the executable and\n\n266\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.820\nit will actually run through that little\nwizard system and you'll install.\n\n267\n00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.650\nInside of Linux systems,\nit may be a little bit more challenging.\n\n268\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.110\nAnd this is a good time for\nus because, at least for you,\n\n269\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:04.480\nright, is if you've now seen if\nyou've gone through VirtualBox and\n\n270\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.210\neven the Hyper-V, you've seen us actually\nuse a couple of Windows operating systems\n\n271\n00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:14.370\nto install these tools, and\nit works fine and it's fairly seamless.\n\n272\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.280\nHere, a little bit more challenging, but\n\n273\n00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.340\nit's something you've gotta actually\nknow and understand how to do it.\n\n274\n00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.290\nSo a lot of times when you do this,\n\n275\n00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.340\nit does kind of take\na little bit of skill here.\n\n276\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.460\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n277\n00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:32.250\nI'm not the best person in the world\nat doing everything that we see, but\n\n278\n00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:37.440\nwhen I selected that, it automatically\nmounted up this VMWare Tools for us.\n\n279\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.880\nAnd what I need to do is, I need to\nget access to this tar here, okay.\n\n280\n00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.569\nTar stands for tape archive, and\nit's also got a GZ which stands for\n\n281\n00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:49.953\nthat G-Zip that it's also in, so\n\n282\n00:15:49.953 --> 00:15:54.578\nthis particular file is archived and\nis zipped up at the same time.\n\n283\n00:15:54.578 --> 00:15:59.013\nAnd normally if you are a power user,\nokay, like Don Pezet and\n\n284\n00:15:59.013 --> 00:16:04.229\nDaniel Lowrie, right, two of the guys\nthat work right here at ITProTV.\n\n285\n00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:08.004\nAnd you're one of those guys, you just\nopen up the terminal, zip, zip, zip, zip,\n\n286\n00:16:08.004 --> 00:16:11.590\ntype in a couple of command line\nutilities, and you'd be ready to go.\n\n287\n00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:15.480\nThe good thing is, inside of sent OS,\nit makes it relatively easy for us.\n\n288\n00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.900\nIf I right click on that\nparticular folder here,\n\n289\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:24.280\nthat tar.gz,\nI can open with this archive manager.\n\n290\n00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.060\nIs what I can do.\n\n291\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.280\nAnd so I'll give it a moment here to\nopen that with the archive manager and\n\n292\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.330\nthen I'm going to extract it\nis what I'm going to do there.\n\n293\n00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.300\nAnd it's going to ask me where\nI want to extract it to.\n\n294\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.410\nI'm going to select this desktop so\nthat we can see it.\n\n295\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.060\nAnd then extract is\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n296\n00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.160\nSo, you'll see a folder just appeared\nover here and we can extract it.\n\n297\n00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.670\nAll right, so I'm gonna click Close and\n\n298\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.020\nclose out of this archiver right here,\nokay.\n\n299\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.780\nSo, this is what you'd\nnormally have to do.\n\n300\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.380\nNow, remember, I've already installed,\nI'm just reinstalling it so\n\n301\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.570\nwe can see the process here too.\n\n302\n00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.770\nSo, once you're here the good\nthing is I can ahead and\n\n303\n00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.980\nget access to that folder\na couple of different ways.\n\n304\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.690\nI could double-click on it, but\nthe problem is I need to run this.\n\n305\n00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.320\nThis file right here, but\n\n306\n00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.410\nit's not like Windows where you just\ndouble-click on it and it runs.\n\n307\n00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.090\nSo, what I need to do is\nI need to right-click and\n\n308\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:24.860\nthen select Open in terminal and\nthat will bring up for\n\n309\n00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.590\nus in the Windows world what we\ncall a command line utility.\n\n310\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.050\nThat will allow us to do that.\n\n311\n00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.700\nLet me zoom in a little bit so\nthat we can see a little bit more.\n\n312\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.750\nAnd this in here, I know just enough\ncommand line to be dangerous,\n\n313\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.480\nis what it comes down to.\n\n314\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.300\nSo, once we get this,\nI need to able to run that green file,\n\n315\n00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.310\nthat type file right there.\n\n316\n00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.240\nNow, you have to do it as the super user.\n\n317\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:56.080\nSo, I simply type in su and then I\ntype in my super secret lab password\n\n318\n00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:04.060\nand now that I'm here I can now\ngo ahead and ensure that I run\n\n319\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:09.880\nvmware dot install pl and press enter.\n\n320\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.730\nAnd now you have to answer a lot\nof different questions that\n\n321\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.010\nare going to come up.\n\n322\n00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.740\nAnd the most of these are actually\njust gonna be hitting enter.\n\n323\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.780\nSo, it's asking do I really\nwant to install this?\n\n324\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.860\nYes, I'm gonna go ahead and\nactually let it install.\n\n325\n00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.710\nNow, it went ahead and uninstalled\nthe version that I already have on there\n\n326\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.540\nbefore and that's perfectly fine.\n\n327\n00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.710\nCuz we can actually use that.\n\n328\n00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.040\nAnd it's going through and\nit's telling me what it's doing.\n\n329\n00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.310\nAnd now it's actually uninstalling.\n\n330\n00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.900\nIt's trying to make sure that everything\nis actually uninstalled before it actually\n\n331\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.330\nreinstalls again.\n\n332\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.290\nSo, it's gonna go through this\nprocess of doing that for\n\n333\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.730\nus, is what's gonna end up happening.\n\n334\n00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.500\nSo, it'll go through, and then you'll have\nto actually install everything again.\n\n335\n00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.650\nAnd once everything is actually installed,\n\n336\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.470\nnow you'll see that the mouse will\nbe actually able to move in and\n\n337\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:58.520\nout through that machine without us\nhaving to press the actual host keys.\n\n338\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.780\nYou'll also see that then when\nyou fullscreen the machine,\n\n339\n00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.960\nit will actually fullscreen and\nuse your video adapter card to fullscreen.\n\n340\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.670\nIf you're doing things like pixie booting,\n\n341\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.770\na lot of times it will also support\nthings like that as well and\n\n342\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:16.260\nso here its asking me what folders that I\nwant to actually be able to do so I'm just\n\n343\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.270\ngoing to hit yes through all these, leave\nit at the default is what its going to do.\n\n344\n00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.490\nNow do I recommend that you take the time\nto read these to take the time to learn\n\n345\n00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.950\na little more about Linux?\n\n346\n00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:25.540\nYes.\n\n347\n00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.300\nOkay, I do recommend that you do that.\n\n348\n00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.260\nBut for right now we just want to see this\nprocess through is what we want to see.\n\n349\n00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.760\nAnd there it goes, it's actually\ninstalling and making things up and\n\n350\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.510\navailable to go.\n\n351\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.450\nAnd there it is.\n\n352\n00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.650\nI'm just gonna hit enter\na couple more times.\n\n353\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.810\nAnd in a moment, everything will actually\nget installed here and you will,\n\n354\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.250\nyou'll be able to move everything in and\nout of that machine.\n\n355\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:49.230\nSo, if you do happen to experience that\nlocking up of the machine where your mouse\n\n356\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:54.460\nis now gone, try this first and\nthen also your network adapters will also\n\n357\n00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.940\nfunction a little bit better and the video\nwill function a little bit better and\n\n358\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.060\ndo just about everything that we need\nto do have a nice integrated machine,\n\n359\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.850\nwe can even at that point run RDP through\n\n360\n00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:11.580\nour connection to our virtual machines as\nwell, especially for Windows machines.\n\n361\n00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.100\nYou can do your VNC connections,\n\n362\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.580\nif you're running anything else,\nto be able to do that.\n\n363\n00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.820\nAnd so it's a lot of information but\n\n364\n00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.750\nthis is one of the essential elements To\ngetting a virtual machine up and running\n\n365\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:28.990\nthe way that we actually want to and need\nto for it to actually be able to operate.\n\n366\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:32.420\nSo, once everything is actually\ndone installing there and\n\n367\n00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.940\nI'm trying to see if I can\nscroll down to see that.\n\n368\n00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.370\nAnd that's one of the unusual things here\nof course is that without it, right,\n\n369\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.930\nI have to use a scroll bar pretty.\n\n370\n00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.820\nSo, now it's actually telling\nme that it's actually going to.\n\n371\n00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.920\nI need to manually start this or\n\n372\n00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.090\nI can restart the session log out log\nback in before everything takes place.\n\n373\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:55.360\nThe easiest thing now is to\nsimply just restart the machine,\n\n374\n00:20:58.895 --> 00:21:01.680\nSo there it is,\nI'm just restarting the machine here.\n\n375\n00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.000\nAnd you'll see something there it is, I'm\nactually stopping all these services and\n\n376\n00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.450\nprocesses in the background, you're also\ngoing to see here in just a moment there\n\n377\n00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:14.490\nis a stopping VM tool services in\nthe virtual machine so it did install and\n\n378\n00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.170\nnow it's stopping it to build reboot and\nonce everything reboots and\n\n379\n00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:22.880\nsets back in those VM ware tools will now\nbe a part of it and this is something\n\n380\n00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.090\nthat's going to actually be important for\nus as I'm running VMWare Workstation 11,\n\n381\n00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.180\nthe VM Ware Workstation 11\ntools are actually installed.\n\n382\n00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.400\nIf you do happen to upgrade to a newer\nversion, the recommendation and\n\n383\n00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.310\nthe best practice is to\ninstall the latest tools.\n\n384\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:41.590\nSo, a lot of times you'll also have to go\nback in and uninstall the older tools and\n\n385\n00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.440\nthen reinstall the newer ones.\n\n386\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.250\nThe good thing is the process will\nprobably tell you right away.\n\n387\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.760\nEspecially if you go to\nVMware Workstation 12,\n\n388\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.140\nit'll tell you something like\nthe VMware tools need to be updated.\n\n389\n00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.580\nAnd you'll go in, you'll be able to update\nthat process and that tool as well.\n\n390\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.670\nAnd that's what you want.\n\n391\n00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.050\nYou want all those things\nto be ready to go.\n\n392\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:03.260\nSo, once we have that, and we now have\na machine that is ready to function.\n\n393\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.980\nAt this point,\nwe install our operating systems.\n\n394\n00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.700\nNot our operating systems,\nour applications,\n\n395\n00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.090\nI couldn't remember what we call them.\n\n396\n00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:13.800\nThe applications that we want to run,\nbut we also now have to check out and\n\n397\n00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.280\nverify that everything did show up\nthe way that we expected it to.\n\n398\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.090\nSo, let's see what we're\ntalking about here.\n\n399\n00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.940\nSo, I'm simply gonna log\nback into this machine so\n\n400\n00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.600\nthat we can actually adjust\nconfigurations if we need to.\n\n401\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.880\nSome of the things that Wes mentioned\nright at the beginning of the show, right?\n\n402\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.860\nIf we now install an application and\n\n403\n00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.730\nthat application is not functioning\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n404\n00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.090\nAnd then we look and we see, I'm just\ngonna pull that into the trash folder.\n\n405\n00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.120\nWe look and see the actual specs here.\n\n406\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.310\nIf they're not right, we can go back\nin now, shut the machine down, and\n\n407\n00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.230\nchange those specifications.\n\n408\n00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.330\nSo, let's say that we actually have just\nabout everything running the way that we\n\n409\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:57.580\nwant to here on this machine and\nlet's verify a couple of other things.\n\n410\n00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.070\nSo, one of the things that we\nmay want to check out of course\n\n411\n00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:04.420\nis going to be let's say the networking.\n\n412\n00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.180\nSo, if I do an I F Config here.\n\n413\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:13.640\nI can check and see if I have the actual\nnetwork addresses that I'm expecting.\n\n414\n00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.280\nSee and this one I don't, so\nit may be where I need to go in and\n\n415\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.310\ncheck out the network adapter and get that\nthing configured the way that I need to.\n\n416\n00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:26.100\nSo, if we now go and try and\nchange some of those machines Settings,\n\n417\n00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.210\nif I right click on those settings.\n\n418\n00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.830\nWell I now notice that some of them,\n\n419\n00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.490\nactually will allow us to\ncontinue to change them.\n\n420\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.830\nSo, like this one, it's not grayed out.\n\n421\n00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:39.830\nSo in theory, it's saying Ronnie, I can\nchange the RAM, here on this machine,\n\n422\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:40.530\nand then not work.\n\n423\n00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.960\nNow, when we were doing this inside of\nvirtual box, we weren't able to do that,\n\n424\n00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.430\nall this stuff was grayed out.\n\n425\n00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.730\nBut here workstation says, if you want to,\n\n426\n00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.630\nlook at that it looks like I\ncan manually adjust the RAM.\n\n427\n00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.190\nNow, I don't know what\nthat does to the machines,\n\n428\n00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.030\nI've never rally tried it but\nyou can see that.\n\n429\n00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.260\nBut notice the processors here,\n\n430\n00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.250\nnothing I can do to actually\nchange that number right then.\n\n431\n00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.297\nOn the hard drive,\nagain all the stuff is grayed out,\n\n432\n00:24:04.297 --> 00:24:06.820\nI can't add an additional hard drive here.\n\n433\n00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.963\nThe CD definitely can, I can reconnect it.\n\n434\n00:24:09.963 --> 00:24:13.558\nNetwork adapter, is something we were\ngonna get to, but normally we won't\n\n435\n00:24:13.558 --> 00:24:17.290\nactually see this if we're gonna be\nconnected to the network anywhere.\n\n436\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.110\nBut we wanna talk about\nthese configurations here,\n\n437\n00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.710\nwe don't really have enough time right\nnow to talk about each one of these, so\n\n438\n00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.740\nwe'll probably save that for\na later episode, as well.\n\n439\n00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.000\nBut each one of these, we can go in and\nwe can actually change and\n\n440\n00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.780\nadjust the settings to.\n\n441\n00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.390\nTo give the hardware\nconfiguration that we need\n\n442\n00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:37.310\nto make sure that our virtual machine is\nrunning the way that we want to, okay.\n\n443\n00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:41.000\nSo once we actually check all that out,\nis everything right?\n\n444\n00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.720\nDo we have the hardware\nconfiguration that we need?\n\n445\n00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.150\nDo we have everything operating\nthe way that we need?\n\n446\n00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.980\nThen we have an operational,\nvirtual machine.\n\n447\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.210\nThere's still a few other things that we\ncan do with it but that's the key here.\n\n448\n00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.330\n>> That's very good.\n\n449\n00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:57.220\nOne of the things that I was thinking,\nRonnie, sometimes, I would like to build\n\n450\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.796\na virtual machine, and let's just say, for\ninstance, I'm building a server, right?\n\n451\n00:25:00.796 --> 00:25:04.480\nAnd I've got the operating system\nserver 2012 R2 on there, and\n\n452\n00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.190\nI've got my base configuration, but\n\n453\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:10.610\nthen I wanna go through the process\nof maybe Installing Active Directory.\n\n454\n00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.572\nInstalling Active Directory\ncan take a while,\n\n455\n00:25:12.572 --> 00:25:16.370\nit detects if it's present it checks\nDNS names and stuff like that.\n\n456\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.700\nAnd then the moment that it's done\nyou always have all the post stuff,\n\n457\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.680\nyou know the post installation task that\nyou have to perform in Active Directory.\n\n458\n00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.270\nNow, if I'm just testing Active Directory,\nright?\n\n459\n00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:30.570\nAnd then I wanna move to a next server and\ntest Active Directory there,\n\n460\n00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:36.200\nI don't wanna have to keep going back over\nthe same Active Directory installation,\n\n461\n00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.780\npromoting the domain controller.\n\n462\n00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.010\nIs there a way that I could\nsave a little time so\n\n463\n00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:44.170\nI don't have to keep doing those\nsame steps over, and over again?\n\n464\n00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.310\n>> There definitely is,\n\n465\n00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.490\nit's not a virtual machine regardless\nof what hypervisor your using.\n\n466\n00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.360\nWe have what we're calling\nthe ability to do snapshots.\n\n467\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.210\nSnapshots essentially take a picture\nin time and as she takes a picture and\n\n468\n00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:01.420\nshe freezes that particular configuration\nthat we have right then and there.\n\n469\n00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.590\nNow the key for us though is what\nWes is talking about is that,\n\n470\n00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.230\nis to understand this that\neven though Wes may say oh,\n\n471\n00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.070\nI just wanted to see if it was okay to do\nthis or not, in other words testing it.\n\n472\n00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.120\nBut then saying look I don't want to\nlose all the other changes that I made\n\n473\n00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.080\nhe can create a snapshot\nbefore he makes those changes.\n\n474\n00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.340\nAnd then make the changes and\nlater on if you realize is,\n\n475\n00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.330\nlook I don't like those changes.\n\n476\n00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.950\nHe can reverse himself and\ngo back to a snapshot again.\n\n477\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:30.000\nAnd that's what actually\nable to do even here.\n\n478\n00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.680\n>> That's great too.\n\n479\n00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.100\nSo when you're testing Active Directory\nand you're importing, I don't know,\n\n480\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.568\n500 clients and\nyou make the wrong PowerShell Script.\n\n481\n00:26:37.568 --> 00:26:40.880\nOr you just type the wrong syntax and\n\n482\n00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.300\nit completely hoses up your\nactive directory database.\n\n483\n00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.720\nSo basically this gives me\nthe ability to undo those changes,\n\n484\n00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.690\nkind of like that get\nout of jail free card.\n\n485\n00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.445\n>> It really does, it allows you to be\nable and that's a nice feature not only\n\n486\n00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:55.788\nfor testing environments but\neven in production environments.\n\n487\n00:26:55.788 --> 00:26:58.988\nThe key here though in a production\nenvironment is you don't substitute\n\n488\n00:26:58.988 --> 00:27:01.110\nthe idea of snapshots for true backups.\n\n489\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.340\nSnapshot are good if you want\nto try configuration change\n\n490\n00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.150\nin the production network and\nyou're not sure how it goes.\n\n491\n00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.570\nAnd so you go in and you take a snapshot\nof how everything was actually done well,\n\n492\n00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:16.750\nthe way that you wanted too right away and\nthen you make your configuration changes.\n\n493\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.030\nAnd if everything explodes on you,\nyou can always reverse that snapshot.\n\n494\n00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.330\nSo how do you do that?\n\n495\n00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.320\nWell there's a couple of\nways you can do this.\n\n496\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.690\nYou can do this when the machine\nis actually live and on.\n\n497\n00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:30.010\nSo if I wanted to take a snapshot,\nI could right-click on that machine,\n\n498\n00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:35.700\ngo down where it says snapshot, and\nright here I can select Take a Snapshot.\n\n499\n00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.270\nNow there is a bit of\noverhead when you do this.\n\n500\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.770\nWhatever's in RAM will also\nbe captured at that point.\n\n501\n00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.600\nSo those of you that actually put 4\ngigs of ram on your virtual machines,\n\n502\n00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.880\nyou'll have at least a minimum\nof 4 gig snapshot and\n\n503\n00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.040\nthen everything else on the configuration\nchanges it will also happen here.\n\n504\n00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.300\nIdeally if you can,\n\n505\n00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.310\nis what you wanna do to save\nstorage if storage is a premium for\n\n506\n00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.620\nyou is to simply shut down this machine\nand I'm simply gonna shut this down.\n\n507\n00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.766\nAnd then once the machine is\nfully shut down, then we can\n\n508\n00:28:08.766 --> 00:28:12.670\nright-click on it and\n\n509\n00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.350\nthen we can select Snapshot once\neverything is fully down, okay?\n\n510\n00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:21.670\nAnd that will then reduce what's\never inside of RAM to want nothing.\n\n511\n00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.720\nAnd then whatever snapshotting\nis really tiny by comparison\n\n512\n00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.340\nwhen you actually do this.\n\n513\n00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.820\nAnd once you do that,\nthen you go in and make your changes.\n\n514\n00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.175\nI'm not sure if this is\nit's almost done here.\n\n515\n00:28:33.175 --> 00:28:36.065\nOnce everything is done,\nwe now take that snapshot,\n\n516\n00:28:36.065 --> 00:28:38.335\nwe make the configuration changes.\n\n517\n00:28:38.335 --> 00:28:40.175\nYou of course want to give\na descriptive name, so\n\n518\n00:28:40.175 --> 00:28:44.785\nwe'll say before, install,\nof something, I don't know.\n\n519\n00:28:46.165 --> 00:28:48.485\nSo I don't have anything I'm\nactually installing here.\n\n520\n00:28:48.485 --> 00:28:52.295\nI simply take the snapshot, and\nnow I will have a history of it.\n\n521\n00:28:52.295 --> 00:28:54.900\nIf I right click and go to snapshots, and\n\n522\n00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.890\nthen select Snapshot Manager, you can see\nhere where I had already created this\n\n523\n00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:05.230\nsnapshot here earlier where VMware\ntools was installed before that.\n\n524\n00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.980\nAnd then you can see right here\nbefore something is ready to go, so\n\n525\n00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.300\nanything here.\n\n526\n00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.390\nSo now I restart the machine,\nI install that application,\n\n527\n00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:18.840\nI realize it hosed me up, I can't\nget access to this, I can't do that.\n\n528\n00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.780\nWell now with that snapshot in place,\nall I have to do then is I would shut\n\n529\n00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.450\nthe machine down again, and\nthen I could come back here and\n\n530\n00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:31.230\ngo back to Snapshots and\nthen select revert here.\n\n531\n00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.630\nAnd I can actually revert\nit to before something.\n\n532\n00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:38.120\nAnd then at that point It\nwould actually go ahead and\n\n533\n00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.570\nremove all those changes that have\nhappened up until that point and time and\n\n534\n00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:44.900\nthat would revert me right back to then.\n\n535\n00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.420\nSo I can do that,\nI do have a previous snapshot here.\n\n536\n00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.360\nSo if I select this one instead I can\nclick yes, and there it goes it actually\n\n537\n00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.550\npowered off and it went back to\nthe earlier edition of the snapshot.\n\n538\n00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:59.440\nAnd we are now ready to be\nable to roll everything back.\n\n539\n00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.180\nNow, this doesn't tend to\ncause a lot of problems right?\n\n540\n00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.020\nBut remember, any, I mean, any little\nchange that you made in that operating\n\n541\n00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.630\nsystem, not just the active\ndirectory that he was talking about.\n\n542\n00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.150\nIt's not just gonna move that.\n\n543\n00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.960\nAny changed, so if you made 16, 17\ndifferent changes in there and you think\n\n544\n00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.180\nrolling back the snapshots only gonna\nremove the one that caused the problem,\n\n545\n00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.240\nno it's gonna remove everything\nbecause it's a snapshot of time.\n\n546\n00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.730\nAnd so this is one of the most important\nthings that we can have available to us\n\n547\n00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.300\nfor the testing as well as in production\nnumbers to be able to create a Snapshot,\n\n548\n00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.780\nand then to revert that Snapshot, or\nrestore a snapshot back in time as well.\n\n549\n00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.054\nNow another thing that we can also\ndo right is something else that's\n\n550\n00:30:39.054 --> 00:30:39.750\nreally neat.\n\n551\n00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.350\nLet's say that this particular\nvirtual machine right here,\n\n552\n00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.850\nthe Sun OS1 that we created,\nwe're saying look its perfect.\n\n553\n00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.800\nIt's got all the utilities\non it that I wanted.\n\n554\n00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.860\nIts got the perfect configuration\nthat I want to be used for\n\n555\n00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.150\nthis, whatever it is that\nI want this set aside for.\n\n556\n00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.570\nAnd I wanna deploy this virtual machine.\n\n557\n00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.950\nIn other words, I have six or\n\n558\n00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:04.440\nseven branch offices, here is the one that\nI want to be the basis of what they do.\n\n559\n00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.120\nWell, Wes has an option at this point,\nhe can run VMware Workstation.\n\n560\n00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.150\nAnd Wes,\nyou can begin the whole process again.\n\n561\n00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.280\nStart all over,\ncreate a brand new virtual machine for\n\n562\n00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.550\neach of my six offices Start\ninstalling CentOS on it, and\n\n563\n00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.870\ninstall those applications on it\nsix times, over and over again.\n\n564\n00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.860\nAfter a while that's gonna get tedious,\nright Wes?\n\n565\n00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:25.220\n>> Absolutely, some of the things that\nI've also had to do is you set up\n\n566\n00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.200\nthings like complex networking topologies.\n\n567\n00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.850\nAny time you're working with some\nkind of server-based application or\n\n568\n00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.630\nserver technology,\nyou typically need more than one server.\n\n569\n00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.540\nAnd I know that one of the things\nthat I struggle with is having to set\n\n570\n00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.060\nup another server, right?\n\n571\n00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.420\nMost of the servers have\nsome base configuration but\n\n572\n00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.500\nI have to find the media,\nI have to make the virtual machine,\n\n573\n00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.160\nI have to install the virtual machine.\n\n574\n00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.899\nAnd the installation of these operating\nsystems isn't really tedious, but\n\n575\n00:31:49.899 --> 00:31:53.477\nwhere I find the problem here Ronnie,\nis that I have to do all the updates.\n\n576\n00:31:53.477 --> 00:31:57.152\nAnd depending on how old the ISO is you\nmight be all day in just doing your\n\n577\n00:31:57.152 --> 00:31:59.766\nupdates to get that server\nwhere it needs to go, or\n\n578\n00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:03.213\nwhere it needs to be in order to\nhave it patched up appropriately.\n\n579\n00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:07.405\nBut then the next time I create the next\nmachine, now I've gotta wait again.\n\n580\n00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:10.378\nSo you got something that can Save\nme a little bit of that burden and\n\n581\n00:32:10.378 --> 00:32:11.958\nease some of the administration.\n\n582\n00:32:11.958 --> 00:32:13.860\n>> We've got something\nthat saves everything.\n\n583\n00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.730\nAnd this is what we really mean.\n\n584\n00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.550\nIf Wes gets the machine up the way that\nhe wants to and has all those updates,\n\n585\n00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:22.600\nWes can simply clone that virtual machine.\n\n586\n00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.150\nThe nice thing about\ncloning the virtual machine\n\n587\n00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.750\nis that it can happen very quickly,\nbut it can also take some time.\n\n588\n00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.650\nBecause it's a true clone, that's\nactually almost a sector by sector copy,\n\n589\n00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:37.090\nof everything that we do and\nthen also that configuration file as well.\n\n590\n00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:41.010\nNow that can also be problematic,\nespecially on same networks here.\n\n591\n00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.520\nAnd the reason why is that we actually\nduplicate things like MAC addresses and\n\n592\n00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.200\nwe duplicate things like\nSIDs inside of Windows.\n\n593\n00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.600\nWe will cause problems on the network.\n\n594\n00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.780\nSo, VMware Workstation is very smart.\n\n595\n00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.790\nIt knows how to actually\nduplicate everything, but\n\n596\n00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.980\nthen change the important\nthings that it needs to.\n\n597\n00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.154\nSuch as universal identifier,\nthe MAC address,\n\n598\n00:33:03.154 --> 00:33:06.490\nit knows that it needs to actually\ngenerate a brand new MAC address.\n\n599\n00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.720\nIt knows it needs to actually\nmake it a little bit different.\n\n600\n00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.950\nSo we don't have to worry about things\nlike duplicates and it's fairly simple.\n\n601\n00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:13.900\nLet me show you.\n\n602\n00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.380\n>> So you're telling that I don't\nhave to turn around and run sysprep?\n\n603\n00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.760\nAnd prep the machine to get ready for\ndeployment?\n\n604\n00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.390\nNow you're really gonna\nhelp me out on this one.\n\n605\n00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.720\n>> Well in theory, right?\n\n606\n00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.510\nEverything that, of course,\nhappens through it.\n\n607\n00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.260\nYou do have to do a little bit\nof testing and see whether or\n\n608\n00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.190\nnot it works, but it should.\n\n609\n00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.040\nSo let me show you how to do that here.\n\n610\n00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.538\nSo, fairly easy.\n\n611\n00:33:31.538 --> 00:33:36.020\nIf I right-click on that machine,\nand then I go down to Snapshots and\n\n612\n00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:40.960\nselect the Snapshot Manager, I can see\nright here I have an option called clone.\n\n613\n00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.580\nAnd at this point it actually walks\nme through creating this clone.\n\n614\n00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.770\nNow you do have to worry about it,\n\n615\n00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.960\nin Windows machines that\nare generally 15 to 20 gigs.\n\n616\n00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.380\nIt takes a while to actually clone\nthat much amount of information.\n\n617\n00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.580\nYou can also create what we call\na full clone, or a link clone.\n\n618\n00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.780\nIdeally I would say always\ncreate a full clone by itself,\n\n619\n00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.360\nbecause that means it doesn't depend on\nthe other parent virtual machine that\n\n620\n00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.400\nyou're cloning it off of to be\nthere before it can actually run.\n\n621\n00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.420\nAnd then you click Next and now you tell\nit hey, where are you gonna place it?\n\n622\n00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.660\nI'm gonna leave it at its defaults for\nright now, and click Finish, and\n\n623\n00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.830\nit will now begin that\nprocess of cloning it.\n\n624\n00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:22.010\nAnd then I can go back through and\nclone it again, and again and again.\n\n625\n00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.120\nAnd allow it to actually make\nas many as I want to, and\n\n626\n00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.220\nit will have that perfect configuration.\n\n627\n00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:31.080\nEverything that I want right there,\nready to go and do what I need to do here.\n\n628\n00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.030\nSo now, do you still have to be\ncareful on certain things if you're\n\n629\n00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.830\ndoing this, right?\n\n630\n00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.510\nYou do, you still have to worry about\nthings like licensing on the operating\n\n631\n00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:42.760\nsystems if your operating system\nlicense model requires a license for\n\n632\n00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.650\nevery one, even if it's a clone.\n\n633\n00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.390\nSo this doesn't get you\naround things like that.\n\n634\n00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:48.610\nAnd same thing with your applications too.\n\n635\n00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.060\nSo if you do have a 500 user\nlicense of something and\n\n636\n00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.160\nyou're now cloning 600 of these.\n\n637\n00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.890\nYes, it means you still need to actually\nbe able to update that license as well.\n\n638\n00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.710\nSo it doesn't get you out of that\nparticular issue on your own.\n\n639\n00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.170\nSo once that's actually done,\n\n640\n00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.710\nwe'll see a clone hopefully appear\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n641\n00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.980\nBut from that point on, right,\nbecause it actually can run and\n\n642\n00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.020\ncan do everything else in this,\nwe deploy it to where we need to.\n\n643\n00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.580\nAt that point, it should run and\nshould do whatever we need as well.\n\n644\n00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.110\nThe last thing that we really wanna\ntalk about is the idea of removing it.\n\n645\n00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:25.500\nSo it's taking its sweet time here\ncloning, is the removal of a machine.\n\n646\n00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.970\nSo in the background and it's not gonna\nallow me to do it while this thing is\n\n647\n00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.970\nrunning here, but in the background, all\nwe have to do is we have to right-click.\n\n648\n00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:36.060\nWe can go down into settings and\nselect remove that machine.\n\n649\n00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.220\nAnd you might be wondering\nwhy the heck would I do that.\n\n650\n00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.380\nWell, we can run out of hard\ndrive space very quickly\n\n651\n00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.470\nif we don't remove those machines.\n\n652\n00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:48.590\nLeaving just a regular machine on your\nphysical and on your host machine, right?\n\n653\n00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.350\nDoes not even running,\nit's not gonna be an any harm except it\n\n654\n00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.950\ndoes reduce the resources\nyou have available.\n\n655\n00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.790\nThe other thing of course is that\nit's got sensitive information on it,\n\n656\n00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.140\nyou don't want to just leave it.\n\n657\n00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.950\nYou wanna be able to store\nit somewhere else or\n\n658\n00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.390\nyou wanna be able to get rid of it.\n\n659\n00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:02.320\nSo simply removing,\n\n660\n00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.260\nit a lot times you can actually just hide\nthe information, or you can remove it and\n\n661\n00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.570\nalso delete that virtual hard drive and\nall those configuration files as well.\n\n662\n00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:15.650\nSo those are fairly simple things that\nyou can do, that will really help you\n\n663\n00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:19.110\nwhen you talk about stuff that you need\nto do to get that machine running.\n\n664\n00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.460\nAnd actually get more\nmachines running by cloning.\n\n665\n00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.790\nAnd what do you do with\nmachines you don't use anymore?\n\n666\n00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:24.990\nYou remove them, too.\n\n667\n00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.830\nSo there's a lot of information right\nhere as far as the configuration.\n\n668\n00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.200\nOh, and there it is,\nmine's actually just done now.\n\n669\n00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.320\nSo now that that's done, we should\nsee over here on the left hand side,\n\n670\n00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.270\nthere is that clone, that centOS machine.\n\n671\n00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.970\nAnd if I don't need that one\nanymore I can right-click,\n\n672\n00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.450\nlike I said we don't even have to go\ndown Settings, we can go to Remove.\n\n673\n00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:48.360\nAnd this is where it actually\nwill delete just that VM, but\n\n674\n00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.120\nit's not gonna delete the hard drive.\n\n675\n00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.170\nThere's another place that you can go\nif you do a little bit of searching\n\n676\n00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.780\nthat will go and\nthen actually remove all the files.\n\n677\n00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.100\nWhen you do that, that actually removes\nevery trace of that virtual machine and\n\n678\n00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.930\nnow it's actually completely gone.\n\n679\n00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:01.510\n>> Thank you Ronnie.\n\n680\n00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.710\nSo we've talked about a lot of\ninformation within this episode.\n\n681\n00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:08.430\nWe're talking about some of the\npre-installation tasks that you need to\n\n682\n00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.530\nhave in place to configure a VM.\n\n683\n00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.810\nYou know, for instance the media.\n\n684\n00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:13.002\nWhat are you gonna install?\n\n685\n00:37:13.002 --> 00:37:15.980\nWhat are the line of business\napplications you need to install?\n\n686\n00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.420\nAnd remember to do your research on the\nprerequisites for what the machine needs.\n\n687\n00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.670\nWe've looked at things like for\ninstance, a cloning VM.\n\n688\n00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:27.770\nSo if you need to make more than one VM\nout of maybe something that you've got set\n\n689\n00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.600\nexactly the way you need it.\n\n690\n00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.250\nHow about being able to undo\nchanges that maybe go unexpectedly.\n\n691\n00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.900\nOr maybe you're just testing your VM and\nyou're done with that software,\n\n692\n00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.890\nbeing able to revert back to an earlier\npoint in time to those snapshots.\n\n693\n00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.420\nRonnie, you got anything else for us?\n\n694\n00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.030\n>> Well, just remember that\nthere's still a bit to be done\n\n695\n00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:48.570\nafter we install an operating\nsystem just to get it ready to go.\n\n696\n00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:52.330\nBut there are still some advanced\nconfigurations that we need to look at,\n\n697\n00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.340\nbut once again, Wes,\nyou've let me talk to long.\n\n698\n00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.550\nAnd that means we need another episode.\n\n699\n00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.140\n>> All right, well we're going to go\nahead and sign off here at IT Pro TV for\n\n700\n00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:00.970\nthis episode.\n\n701\n00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:02.180\nI've been your host Wes Bryant.\n\n702\n00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.110\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n703\n00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.573\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n704\n00:38:04.573

00:00:18.803\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode, we're gonna be moving along in\n\n4\n00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:22.340\nvirtualization technologies,\ncontinuing in VMware Workstation.\n\n5\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.690\nIn some of the previous episodes,\n\n6\n00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.050\nwe showed you some of the basic\nconfigurations on how to get a VM up and\n\n7\n00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.200\nrunning, and prepared for your\nenvironment inside a VMware Workstation.\n\n8\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.310\nNow what we're gonna be diving into is\nsome of the more advanced features and\n\n9\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.220\nwe have for us none other than Mr.\nRonnie Wong to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.050\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.120\n>> I'm doing fine.\n\n12\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.710\nWe wanna take a look at some of the\nadvanced feature that we can also do with,\n\n13\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.100\nof course,\nVMware Workstation types of VMs too.\n\n14\n00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.860\nNow sometimes, what ends up happening,\nof course, with the VMs\n\n15\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.850\nis that we configure them, and\nwe create them, and we get them working.\n\n16\n00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.510\nAnd then we realize that we\nhaven't actually put enough stuff,\n\n17\n00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.010\nhowever we want to describe it,\nattached to that VM.\n\n18\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.060\nWell the good thing is,\nsince it is a virtual machine,\n\n19\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.100\nit doesn't really require much of us\nto actually be able to add in more and\n\n20\n00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.200\nmore stuff that we actually need to\nmake it work a little bit better.\n\n21\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.300\nAnd to make it work\nthe way that we want to.\n\n22\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.540\nSo we wanna take a look, of course,\n\n23\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.630\nthen about making sure that we can add\nin the additional storage that we need\n\n24\n00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.920\ninside of VMware Workstation,\nit gives us that ability to do so.\n\n25\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.744\nAnd we also wanna talk some other\nadvanced features that we can increase\n\n26\n00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:27.177\nits overall resources\nthat it has access to.\n\n27\n00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:30.715\nAnd then we'll see some other\nfeatures that may just help out,\n\n28\n00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:34.510\nespecially when you need to\nget information onto your VM.\n\n29\n00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.970\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in and\n\n30\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.280\nlet's talk about that first option which\nis attaching additional storage, right?\n\n31\n00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.070\nSo let's say I'm gonna actually end up\nusing a Windows 8 VM to help us out here.\n\n32\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.855\nBut let's say that what I have is\na simple Windows 8 machine and\n\n33\n00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:54.150\nthere's a single hard drive\nattached to the 60 gig hard drive.\n\n34\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.320\nIt's got a basic Windows 8.1 install on it\nbut then I realize that I want to attach,\n\n35\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.670\nlet's say for an example,\na data drive to my VM.\n\n36\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.070\nAnd at this point here,\nwhat would we do with a physical machine,\n\n37\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.910\nif I needed to add an additional storage,\nI would power the machine down.\n\n38\n00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.320\nI would make sure I have an additional\nhard drive, need to find a cable,\n\n39\n00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.980\nmake sure that there's a power\nadaptor to go along with it.\n\n40\n00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.510\nPut it in the machine,\nplug my cables in, boot the machine up,\n\n41\n00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.774\nand what we would see is,\nhopefully inside of that Windows\n\n42\n00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:27.258\n8 machine is that we'd have\na hard drive there, ready to go.\n\n43\n00:02:27.258 --> 00:02:30.658\nBut we would still need to\ninitialize it and then format it so\n\n44\n00:02:30.658 --> 00:02:34.800\nit can be used by the machine,\nby the operating system itself.\n\n45\n00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.670\nSo, the good thing is,\nhere inside of VMware Workstation,\n\n46\n00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.690\nwe can just about do the same\nthing without having to worry\n\n47\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.190\nabout the additional cables, and of\ncourse, another hard drive that we'd buy.\n\n48\n00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.860\nAs long as we have access and space to be\nable to create an additional storage space\n\n49\n00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.040\nor a storage drive, we can do so.\n\n50\n00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.340\nSo, how do we do that?\n\n51\n00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.668\nWell, what I'm going to do is right here\non my Windows 8 machine, I'm going to\n\n52\n00:02:58.668 --> 00:03:04.780\nright-click in VMware Workstation where it\nsays Windows 8, and go down to Settings.\n\n53\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.410\nAnd inside of the Settings here,\nI'm going to look for my hard disk option.\n\n54\n00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.020\nAnd right now,\n\n55\n00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.790\nyou can see in the hard disk where\nmy hard drive is actually located.\n\n56\n00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.595\nYou can see the current size of this\nright here, it's only really using about\n\n57\n00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:22.870\n10 gigs, even though it has\na maximum capacity of about 60.\n\n58\n00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.300\nAnd so we have the ability to actually\nexpand out a little bit further but\n\n59\n00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.510\nI want to attach another hard drive.\n\n60\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.100\nWell the way that I do that\nis select Hard Disk, and\n\n61\n00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.530\nthen down at the bottom of the screen\nwhere it says Add, I click Add,\n\n62\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.320\nand now it's gonna ask what type of\nadditional hardware do I want to add in.\n\n63\n00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.330\nWell I'm gonna leave it at\nthe default where it says Hard Disk.\n\n64\n00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.820\nSelect Next, and then it's gonna\nask how I want to attach this.\n\n65\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.900\nYou can choose any\nmethod that you want to.\n\n66\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.610\nThe default was SCSI, so\nI'm gonna leave it as SCSI as well, and\n\n67\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.420\nnow, I have a couple of\ndifferent modes here.\n\n68\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.590\nIndependent mode says it's\nnot affected by snapshots, so\n\n69\n00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.850\non this one, if I create a snapshot\nthat's perfectly fine but\n\n70\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.740\nthe very fact is snapshots\nare not gonna help here, okay.\n\n71\n00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.030\nAnd so it's not gonna allow me to\nsnapshot this additional drive\n\n72\n00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.700\neven though I create a snapshot,\nit's not gonna roll it back.\n\n73\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.840\nSo, if I go and\nselect independent, I can do that.\n\n74\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.730\nAnd now, it says,\nsince we're not actually affected,\n\n75\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.010\nI have persistent,\nchanges are immediate and\n\n76\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.730\npermanent written to the disk, so\nanything that on here is done, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.540\nI can also do non-persistent and\nthis is saying, look,\n\n78\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.250\nwe're gonna wait until you shut down,\npower off, or\n\n79\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.530\nrestore this snapshot to see whether or\nnot changes are gonna be discarded.\n\n80\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.960\nSo notice that it doesn't allow me\nactually to revert back to a snapshot.\n\n81\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.630\nIt just says, hey, any changes that\nyou write to this additional disk\n\n82\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.520\nwhen it comes down time for it actually\nto do this idea of restoring a snapshot,\n\n83\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.590\nthose changes are gonna be lost, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.590\nSo I can either have it save everything\nthat you've changed immediately or\n\n85\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.300\nwhen it comes down time to\nthat major change here.\n\n86\n00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.850\nWhen you say, hey,\n\n87\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.370\nwe're gonna restore this snapshot, this is\ngonna be that disk that says I'm gonna get\n\n88\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.970\nrid of information that's changed\nsince this snapshot as well.\n\n89\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.440\nSo you can actually select\nthat mode if you want to.\n\n90\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.200\nI'm just gonna leave that off by default,\ncuz it is.\n\n91\n00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.450\nClick Next here, and it's gonna ask\nme if I wanna create a new one, or\n\n92\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.580\nadd an existing one, or\neven use a physical disk here.\n\n93\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.530\nCreating a new one is the one\nthat we're going to do, but\n\n94\n00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.590\nwhy would we actually choose\nto add an additional drive.\n\n95\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.070\nWell let's say that you end up moving\n\n96\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.320\nanother virtual machine's\ndata drive to your machine.\n\n97\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.430\nIf you want to be able to do that, that's\nexactly what you would do right here.\n\n98\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.652\nYou'd go through the process\nof creating a new one, and\n\n99\n00:05:37.652 --> 00:05:40.737\ninstead of choosing create a new one,\ngonna actually attach that other one.\n\n100\n00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:44.242\nAnd that should attach right in,\ngives you access to the data as\n\n101\n00:05:44.242 --> 00:05:47.087\nlong as you have the same\nformatting that you need,\n\n102\n00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:51.950\nthe compatible formatting that you need to\nbuild a read off of that drive as well.\n\n103\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.010\n>> Yeah, one of things I was thinking is\nI tried to, if I'm creating a virtual\n\n104\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.550\nmachine, I try to be as minimalistic on\nthe current storage in the host machine.\n\n105\n00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.116\nAnd then of course,\nI under shoot the runway.\n\n106\n00:06:01.116 --> 00:06:04.088\nAnd I always install one\nkind of application and\n\n107\n00:06:04.088 --> 00:06:07.840\nit takes way more storage\nspace than I ever planned for.\n\n108\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.990\nSo now I've got a virtual machine that\neither have to have another drive or\n\n109\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.480\nI just can't add any more data on it.\n\n110\n00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.550\nSo this looks like this might help\nme out in a situation like that.\n\n111\n00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.770\n>> It definitely can because it does allow\nyou to be able to continue to take those\n\n112\n00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.870\ndrives, right?\n\n113\n00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.910\nAnd do a little bit more, and we'll\nactually see maybe even in another episode\n\n114\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.490\nwhere we can take an existing\ndrive that's too small.\n\n115\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.650\nAnd this is something that's also needed\ninside the virtual machine world,\n\n116\n00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.530\nis that we can take a drive that we\ngo crud, I need another 10 gigs or\n\n117\n00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.580\nI need another 200 gigs.\n\n118\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.080\nWe can actually increase that by\nexpanding out that virtual machine hard\n\n119\n00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.210\ndrive as well.\n\n120\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.250\nSo it's this really neat on some\nof the options that we have.\n\n121\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.200\nAnd then there's also this other\noption that you see where it say's,\n\n122\n00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.970\nuse a physical disk and what this\nconsiders is now a pass through disk here.\n\n123\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.570\nWhere what we're saying is there is a way\nthat you can take a virtual machine and\n\n124\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.010\ntell it to write directly on\nto the hard drive itself.\n\n125\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.550\nAnd this is not something that you and\nI would normally do in a VM like this.\n\n126\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.540\nCan you?\n\n127\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.647\nTo a point, right, but\nif you were attaching this, let's say,\n\n128\n00:07:06.647 --> 00:07:09.710\nto what we call a virtual SAN,\nthis is exactly what you would do.\n\n129\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.481\nIt allows for\n\n130\n00:07:10.481 --> 00:07:15.150\nyou to actually read from that disk in\nblocks rather than simple files, okay.\n\n131\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.810\nBut we're not actually into that point for\nVMware Workstation.\n\n132\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.040\nSo instead, but\nit actually let you know that you can.\n\n133\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.697\nYou can take your VM and actually\nattach it to a SAN if you need to.\n\n134\n00:07:24.697 --> 00:07:26.330\nI'm gonna click Next here.\n\n135\n00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.910\nAnd now, do I want to actually use\nthe fully allocated disk space,\n\n136\n00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.550\nor do I want it to be dynamic?\n\n137\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.565\nI can store it as a single file,\nor I can even split it here.\n\n138\n00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:38.010\nNow the idea of splitting this\ndisk allows us to split it into,\n\n139\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.050\nI think 2 GB files, right.\n\n140\n00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.250\nSo that way, if I know I don't\nhave large enough drives,\n\n141\n00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.120\nI can actually divide it\nup among smaller drives.\n\n142\n00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.787\nAnd essentially have my virtual hard drive\nhere, split up among those smaller drives,\n\n143\n00:07:50.787 --> 00:07:53.577\nand still be able to actually\nuse that same storage.\n\n144\n00:07:53.577 --> 00:07:57.498\nSo you had a premium on storage, and\nyou know you have two or three drives,\n\n145\n00:07:57.498 --> 00:08:00.991\nthat has a little bit of space on it,\nyou can also do this here too.\n\n146\n00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:01.664\nAll right.\n\n147\n00:08:01.664 --> 00:08:04.885\nAnd click next and\nthat's going to ask me for this file name.\n\n148\n00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:06.170\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n149\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:11.390\nActually I'm going to change this\nI'm going to call this one data disk\n\n150\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.040\nzero one for my file name.\n\n151\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.640\nTo make it a little bit\ndistinguishing from there.\n\n152\n00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.480\nAll right.\nSo, now that we've got that done.\n\n153\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.890\nOkay, notice that I now\nhave two drives attached.\n\n154\n00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.630\nThere is the regular hard disk, and here\nis the new hard disk that I have as well.\n\n155\n00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.500\nSo, notice that I have that\nability to be able to do that.\n\n156\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.660\nAnd I can even rename them\nat some point if I want to.\n\n157\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:42.590\nSimply, I can go and\nlaunch this virtual machine, power it on.\n\n158\n00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.590\nAnd now see if I can get\nit recognize inside of 8.1.\n\n159\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.320\nIf I do, I'm now successfully created\nas well as attached conditional\n\n160\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.710\nstorage drive in the my vm and\nit's off and ready to go.\n\n161\n00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.510\nIt is an important aspect of something\nthat we've got to be able to do.\n\n162\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:04.010\nEspecially we're moving around lot of data\nInside of VM's is one of the most neat\n\n163\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.230\nthings that we can do because it really\ndoes allow us to build access so\n\n164\n00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.560\nmuch more data and\nnot have to worry about in mind\n\n165\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.720\nmoving it from one machine to other\ndropping physical hard drives off.\n\n166\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.440\nIf I need to expand it or\ncompact it which we'll see in another\n\n167\n00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.990\nepisode here as well probably as we\ncontinue to move on through this.\n\n168\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.750\nWe'll see that there's a lot of features\nthat are built into VMWare Workstation\n\n169\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:33.337\nthat we may not have found in\nother types of that are out there.\n\n170\n00:09:33.337 --> 00:09:37.280\nYou might be wondering, wow,\nwhy all these extra features?\n\n171\n00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.380\nWell, remember,\nyou're paying at this point, right?\n\n172\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.550\nSo, you're actually paying\nout of pocket money\n\n173\n00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.020\nto get something like\nVMWare Workstation to work for you.\n\n174\n00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.660\nAnd so there's a lot more features to it,\nwhereas some of the free ones, you may see\n\n175\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.330\nthat they actually do work, but some of\nthe stuff that they actually do make work,\n\n176\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.490\nsome of it does work,\nsome of it doesn't and\n\n177\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.270\nthat's because they're actually relying\non the good will of people doing it.\n\n178\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.880\nNow, Virtual Box is\na little bit different,\n\n179\n00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.920\nbut even they don't have some of these\nfeatures that we're seeing here.\n\n180\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.220\nOkay, all right, so there it is.\n\n181\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.850\nHere's my Windows 8 workstation Let\nme log on in and I need to get access\n\n182\n00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.850\nto my disk management once I get access\nherein, so I can initialize the disk.\n\n183\n00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.390\nSo, I'm gonna go to my desktop and\nselect file explorer.\n\n184\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.250\nInside of file explorer,\nwe're only seeing one hard drive list and\n\n185\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.580\nthat is because even though I have\na hard drive attached to that VM, right.\n\n186\n00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.980\nThe operating system\nitself is saying look,\n\n187\n00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.090\nthere's probably a hard drive\nattached here, but I can't access it.\n\n188\n00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.090\nAnd so what I can do from here.\n\n189\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.770\n>> So at this point, it's really no\ndifferent than a physical installation.\n\n190\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.600\nLike me opening a physical box up and\n\n191\n00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.090\nsaying hey,\nI need to slave in another hard drive.\n\n192\n00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.490\nAnd like you mentioned,\nwe don't need cables.\n\n193\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.190\nBut in a physical situation you would.\n\n194\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.740\nNow, I've shut the case and\nI push power on that box.\n\n195\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.140\nNow, we've got to make the operating\nsystem actually recognize it, right?\n\n196\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.320\n>> That's what we're gonna do here.\n\n197\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.610\nWent ahead and take a look.\n\n198\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.520\nWe'll actually see that here it is.\n\n199\n00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.950\nI've got Disk Management up and going.\n\n200\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.130\nI simply right-clicked on the Windows\nlogo here and selected Disk Management.\n\n201\n00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.440\nAnd you're seeing right here where\nit says Initialize the Disk,\n\n202\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.740\nwhich means Windows can see it, and\nI can actually take a look here and\n\n203\n00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.070\nthere it is on Disk Number 1 down there.\n\n204\n00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.830\nIt says unknown right there.\n\n205\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.310\nWell, I can see that it's actually\nright there and ready to go.\n\n206\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.440\nLet me get something so\nI can do that, there we go.\n\n207\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.330\nAnd then I can click OK, and that will\nallow the operating system to initialize,\n\n208\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.080\nin other words,\nto be able to see it a little bit better.\n\n209\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.180\nAnd if I can stop double clicking here.\n\n210\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.890\nThis number one is right there and\nready to go for\n\n211\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.340\nme to make it operational, I right click,\n\n212\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.420\nmake a simple volume, click next and I'm\njust gonna leave it at all it's defaults.\n\n213\n00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.610\nI'm gonna change this one\nI'm gonna call it DataDisk1.\n\n214\n00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.570\nTell it to perform a quick format so\n\n215\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:58.260\nthat it can be recognized by\nthe operating system and click finish.\n\n216\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.220\nAnd then it should assign\na drive letter as well.\n\n217\n00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.780\nThere it is.\n\n218\n00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.960\nData disk one is drive e and\nI can see it right here.\n\n219\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.350\nThere's that 60 gig drive.\n\n220\n00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.360\nAnd let me No.\n\n221\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.780\nLet me remind me later.\n\n222\n00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.560\nAnd so that take a little bit\nthrough the file explorer.\n\n223\n00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.110\nThere it is.\n\n224\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.430\nThere's the two hard drives\n[INAUDIBLE] have ready to go.\n\n225\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.230\nAnd it is.\n\n226\n00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:26.270\nIt's just a feature that we should as\npeople working in the IT industry.\n\n227\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.740\nWe need to add additional storage into\nour VM's, we should be able to do this.\n\n228\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.070\n>> So, it looks like it supports all the\nstandard disk operations that you have on\n\n229\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.340\nany physical drive here.\n\n230\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.950\nNow, you know in keeping in that\nidea of minimalistic approach,\n\n231\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.030\nthat's one of the things that I\ntry to take if I'm just, you know,\n\n232\n00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:45.380\ntesting software, and let's say that\nI've got, you know, a pretty intensive\n\n233\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.650\napplication that I'm testing and\nI am taking that minimalistic approach.\n\n234\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.160\nRight?\n\n235\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.480\nAnd all of a sudden, I need a little\nbit more horsepower under there, right?\n\n236\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.860\nFor instance, maybe I need\na little bit more CPU strength.\n\n237\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.380\nMaybe in testing that application, and if\nI'm in Windows, I open up task manager and\n\n238\n00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.910\nI see that thing's pegged at 98%, is\n\n239\n00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.380\nthere a way that we can increase a little\nbit of the performance of the machine too?\n\n240\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.120\n>> There really is.\n\n241\n00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.170\nLet's take a look here\non this workstation so\n\n242\n00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.140\nthat we can see what Wes is talking about.\n\n243\n00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.582\nIf I right click and bring up my tak\nmanager inside of windows 8.1 and\n\n244\n00:13:15.582 --> 00:13:18.910\nlet me see if I can get access to it so\nwe can see it here.\n\n245\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.990\nBring in a little more details and\ngo to the performance tab.\n\n246\n00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:30.250\nI can see my CPU right here and\nit's at 9% or 2%, 2.7 gighertz,\n\n247\n00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.040\nbut what I'm looking for is down here,\nright here in this area right.\n\n248\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.910\nYou see that there's one\nsocket in other words,\n\n249\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.000\none processor and\nit's got two virtual processors on it.\n\n250\n00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.530\nSo, if I do have an application that can\nactually use more than one processor,\n\n251\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.850\nwell I can go ahead and re-assign\na little bit more processing power to it.\n\n252\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.340\nI'm going to shut down the VM first\n\n253\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.980\nbecause that's normally what I would think\nof if I was doing this for a real PC.\n\n254\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:04.730\nAnd once that machine is now shut down,\nI can now go into\n\n255\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:10.180\nmy Windows 8 machine and on processors,\nI'm gonna select it right here.\n\n256\n00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.760\nNotice that I have this\nability to actually\n\n257\n00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.970\nselect the number of\ncores that are available.\n\n258\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.670\nNow, Inside of VM ware workstation this\none will allow me to select up to 16.\n\n259\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:24.050\nThe rule of thumb though is simple,\neven though I could in theory select 16 it\n\n260\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.710\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nthat I will read all 16.\n\n261\n00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.770\nSo, the recommendation is\nwhat we would do here.\n\n262\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.420\nIf you know how many cores\nyou have in your CPU\n\n263\n00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.390\nthat is probably the maximum\namount you want to do here.\n\n264\n00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:41.300\nLet's take for an example that this is\na quad core Xeon processor that I have.\n\n265\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.950\nI have one socket in it and I can have\nup to a maximum of four cores here to be\n\n266\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.590\nable to turn on and do what I need to.\n\n267\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:53.060\nYou may say, no, technically it is a duel\ncore processor but it has hyper threading.\n\n268\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.910\nRemember VM ware looks at\nlogical processors so for\n\n269\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.000\nthem it's actually saying,\nhey it's 4 cores here.\n\n270\n00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.060\nNow, there are times though, that even\nthis can work and you think this is going\n\n271\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.050\nto give you more processing power, it can\nalso hinder your performance as well.\n\n272\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:14.570\nDepending on the load on your host\nmachine as well on inside the VM And\n\n273\n00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.370\nalso dependent upon what.\n\n274\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.680\nWhether or not that application\ncan take advantage of four cores.\n\n275\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.880\nSome applications can,\nsome applications can't.\n\n276\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.530\nIt doesn't matter if you throw 16 cores\non there, if it says look I only use one\n\n277\n00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:33.620\ncore, it's not gonna actually go beyond\nthat instance here and be able to actually\n\n278\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.060\nuse all four of those cores or all 16\nof those core processors to do that.\n\n279\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.620\nSo, you do have to do a little\nbit of kind of experimentation\n\n280\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.340\nwhen you talk about the idea of actually\nadding in more virtual cores here.\n\n281\n00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.997\nSometimes it does benefit,\nsometimes it may not, but\n\n282\n00:15:50.997 --> 00:15:55.063\nfor example on the base operating\nsystem it definitely can.\n\n283\n00:15:55.063 --> 00:15:59.938\nIf you do have a base operating system\nthat says look, I absolutely like running\n\n284\n00:15:59.938 --> 00:16:04.594\non dual core processors Then give it that\ndual core processor for it to run and\n\n285\n00:16:04.594 --> 00:16:05.713\ndo what it needs.\n\n286\n00:16:05.713 --> 00:16:09.725\nIf it absolutely says it can actually\nrecognize an i7 with a quad core\n\n287\n00:16:09.725 --> 00:16:12.920\nprocessor, then that's\nexactly what you want to do.\n\n288\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.800\nAll right, let's go ahead and log in and\n\n289\n00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.222\nlets verify that this machine\nnow sees all four cores, okay.\n\n290\n00:16:20.222 --> 00:16:21.603\nAlright, so, there it is.\n\n291\n00:16:21.603 --> 00:16:23.879\nI'm on my desktop here.\n\n292\n00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.238\nLet me go back to my desktop.\n\n293\n00:16:25.238 --> 00:16:27.884\nI'm going to get back into Task Manager.\n\n294\n00:16:31.076 --> 00:16:35.690\nAnd inside of Task Manager, I'm going\nto go back to the Performance tab.\n\n295\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.910\nAnd I like it a lot better when I could\nactually see like multiple cores up there.\n\n296\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.430\nThis one gives me this one.\n\n297\n00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.889\nBut look right here where I can\nsee Virtual processors, and\n\n298\n00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:46.490\nit absolutely says 4 now.\n\n299\n00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.126\nSo that means that whatever is running on\nthis system has that advantage to be able\n\n300\n00:16:50.126 --> 00:16:52.109\nto take advantage of four core processors.\n\n301\n00:16:52.109 --> 00:16:55.936\nBut remember that this is actually not\nonly a limitation of this machine,\n\n302\n00:16:55.936 --> 00:17:00.280\nthe virtualizing that's actually here,\nbut even the applications that run.\n\n303\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.560\nSo they all have to work hand-in-hand for\n\n304\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.970\nus to be able to take\nadvantage of that extra power.\n\n305\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.960\n>> All right, and what if we need, here's\nanother one I was thinking about, right.\n\n306\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.590\nWe talk about RAM being that temporary\nworkbench, the more of it you have,\n\n307\n00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.750\nthe more work you can do at one time.\n\n308\n00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.730\nThere again you might have to, I just keep\nthinking of the minimalistic approach\n\n309\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.660\nhere because I don't want a utilize all\nof the resources on my host machine.\n\n310\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.020\nBecause I might be running something on my\nhost machine that I need those resources.\n\n311\n00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.993\nSo the other thing that comes to mind is,\ncan we expand that workbench?\n\n312\n00:17:27.993 --> 00:17:30.470\nAnd what I mean by that is,\ncan we add more memory?\n\n313\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.210\n>> You definitely can.\n\n314\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.950\nJust like a physical machine,\nyou can add in more memory.\n\n315\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.540\nA virtual machine you can as well.\n\n316\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:40.700\nThe only limitation is what your host\nmachine can actually manually support.\n\n317\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.403\nSo if you can have a host machine that\nwill allow you to install 64 gigs of RAM,\n\n318\n00:17:45.403 --> 00:17:48.290\nin theory,\nyou can also do the same thing here.\n\n319\n00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.960\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n320\n00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.460\nSo I went ahead and powered down that\nWindows 8 machine while we were talking,\n\n321\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.650\nand all I need to do now is select Memory.\n\n322\n00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.148\nAnd when I do so,\nnotice that I have this memory slider.\n\n323\n00:17:59.148 --> 00:18:01.286\nAnd we had mentioned it in\na previous episode before.\n\n324\n00:18:01.286 --> 00:18:06.618\nBut I can give it a max of up to, it says,\n\n325\n00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:12.941\n6,392 megabytes of RAM, if I choose to.\n\n326\n00:18:12.941 --> 00:18:16.041\nI have it set at a standard 2.\n\n327\n00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:18.320\nLet's go ahead and\ngive it up to, let's do 4.\n\n328\n00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.050\nI don't wanna go overboard here.\n\n329\n00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.420\nSo I can use that slider and\ngive it 4 gigs of RAM if I want to.\n\n330\n00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.690\nNow when you start doing this,\n\n331\n00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.600\nremember that this really does\nrob a couple of things here.\n\n332\n00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.686\nOne, if your host's virtual machine is\nrunning something in the background and\n\n333\n00:18:35.686 --> 00:18:40.396\nyou turn this virtual machine on,\nright, there's 8 gigs of physical RAM\n\n334\n00:18:40.396 --> 00:18:45.359\nleft in this virtual, or 8 gigs of\nphysical RAM left in the physical machine.\n\n335\n00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:47.055\nI was about to say virtual machine here.\n\n336\n00:18:47.055 --> 00:18:49.412\n8 gigs left in this physical machine, and\n\n337\n00:18:49.412 --> 00:18:52.299\nright now it's actually using,\nwell a little bit.\n\n338\n00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:54.842\nLet me see how much this thing is using.\n\n339\n00:18:54.842 --> 00:19:02.170\nRight here for performance, we're using\nabout 2.6 gigs here, so let's say about 3.\n\n340\n00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.215\nWe'll just round up to make it easy.\n\n341\n00:19:04.215 --> 00:19:09.630\n3, and here is another 4\nI'm giving to this machine.\n\n342\n00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:14.082\nWhen I turn this machine on, it's going\nto take up all 4 gigs fairly quickly,\n\n343\n00:19:14.082 --> 00:19:18.265\nespecially when everything's\ninstalling and getting recognized, and\n\n344\n00:19:18.265 --> 00:19:20.299\ndoing everything that it needs to.\n\n345\n00:19:20.299 --> 00:19:23.227\nBut once it idles out, it may kind\nof idle out on two or three even,\n\n346\n00:19:23.227 --> 00:19:24.538\nright around there.\n\n347\n00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:29.200\nBut that's 6 gigs of ram out of 8, that\nI'm now using between these two machines.\n\n348\n00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.531\nSo if you forget that and now Wes starts\na third virtual machine that requires\n\n349\n00:19:34.531 --> 00:19:39.543\n2 gigs, he may find the machine\nrunning insanely sluggishly as well.\n\n350\n00:19:39.543 --> 00:19:41.870\nAnd you do have to pay attention to this.\n\n351\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.960\nSo it's always better to like what Wes is\ntalking about taking a minimalist type\n\n352\n00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.190\nof approach where you only want\nto give as much RAM as you need.\n\n353\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.230\nIf that particular machine does need\nmore RAM, that's perfectly fine.\n\n354\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.359\nBut realize that there has to be that\nupper limit that we've got to be aware of\n\n355\n00:19:57.359 --> 00:19:59.170\nwhen we start doing this.\n\n356\n00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.654\nEven though our host machines\nmay not be doing much,\n\n357\n00:20:01.654 --> 00:20:05.776\na lot of times when we're doing something\nlike a type two hypervisor, we're probably\n\n358\n00:20:05.776 --> 00:20:09.354\nusing that host machine at the same time\nto do quite a bit in the background.\n\n359\n00:20:09.354 --> 00:20:11.040\nAnd that's why we have to be careful.\n\n360\n00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.914\nAnd I can even see like\nright now on my machine,\n\n361\n00:20:13.914 --> 00:20:17.178\nit is taking a little bit\nlonger to actually load up.\n\n362\n00:20:17.178 --> 00:20:20.700\nAnd Wes, I don't know if you kind\nof get the same feeling here.\n\n363\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.280\nAnd what's happening,\nit's now saying look.\n\n364\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.570\nHey, that host machine, you're limited by\nhow much ran I can expand in there now\n\n365\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.020\nbecause now, I'm actually having 4 gigs.\n\n366\n00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.330\nAnd let's see if we get in there and\n\n367\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.310\nwe can see those 4 gigs of\nRAM being reported now.\n\n368\n00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:40.095\nI'll log in, and to me it even feels\nlike that the login is slower.\n\n369\n00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:44.436\nAnd it's not that big of a login so\nthat's what I see.\n\n370\n00:20:44.436 --> 00:20:46.120\nI'll go back to Task Manager.\n\n371\n00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.910\nThere's probably multiple\nways you can see the RAM,\n\n372\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.875\nbut Task Manager is a good one for\nus to be able to see this.\n\n373\n00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:55.670\n40% of the memory is being taken\nup right at the loading, and\n\n374\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.780\nI just gave it 4 gigs there, Wes.\n\n375\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.208\nIf I click on Performance, and\nthere it is, 1.6 out of 4.\n\n376\n00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:06.590\nDuring the install,\nit does tend to spike up a bit.\n\n377\n00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.379\nAnd you can see it's actually resting\nright around that 40% right now\n\n378\n00:21:10.379 --> 00:21:11.770\nof those 4 gigs.\n\n379\n00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.730\nAnd I don't have another application\nrunning in the background of this, Wes.\n\n380\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.690\nSo the more applications I run,\nthe more I'm probably gonna see that hey,\n\n381\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.980\nthis thing's gonna eat up a lot.\n\n382\n00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.280\nAnd you can see right here,\n1.3 and use 2.5 that's available.\n\n383\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.250\nThe commitment's a little bit higher.\n\n384\n00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.180\nAnd even paging, not so big,\nand that's perfectly fine.\n\n385\n00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:31.840\nBut yes,\n\n386\n00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.620\nthis actually does give you a little bit\nbetter performance inside of the VM.\n\n387\n00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.430\nBut it only helps if it doesn't overwhelm\n\n388\n00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.270\nwhat's actually on that\nhosted machine as well.\n\n389\n00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.980\nSo there is a balance that\nwe have to play off of.\n\n390\n00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.230\n>> So we got to keep in mind\nthings like in the background.\n\n391\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.020\nJust because this host machine happens\nto have 4 gigs, happens to have 6 gigs,\n\n392\n00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.727\nbigger machine you might be\nrunning it on has 8 gigs.\n\n393\n00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:54.496\nWe've got to keep in mind that the host\nmachine is still doing stuff in\n\n394\n00:21:54.496 --> 00:21:55.221\nthe background.\n\n395\n00:21:55.221 --> 00:21:58.000\nAnd then we also have the hypervisor,\nif I understand it right,\n\n396\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.807\nthat's communicating between the VMs.\n\n397\n00:21:59.807 --> 00:22:02.575\nSo there's a lot of stuff going on in\nthe background that we got to take\n\n398\n00:22:02.575 --> 00:22:03.209\ninto account.\n\n399\n00:22:03.209 --> 00:22:07.693\nAnd then by the opposite side of the,\nor the coin if you will, you had,\n\n400\n00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:10.795\nin one of our previous shows,\nyou showed Cent.\n\n401\n00:22:10.795 --> 00:22:14.450\nCent could run on as\nminimalistic as 512 megs of RAM.\n\n402\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:19.342\nSo what we're seeing here is even from\na small standpoint, all the way up to 4\n\n403\n00:22:19.342 --> 00:22:23.630\ngigs, you could still have a painful\nexperience inside of the VM.\n\n404\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:28.710\n>> You really can, especially when you're\nrunning multiple VMs on a smaller machine.\n\n405\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.588\nIt still may end up doing that.\n\n406\n00:22:30.588 --> 00:22:33.420\nSo you still have to kind of match up and\n\n407\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.570\nrealize what's going\nto be that sweet spot.\n\n408\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.503\nSo normally what I do is I\ndo about 2 gigs per machine.\n\n409\n00:22:38.503 --> 00:22:43.073\nAnd that tends to work out as long as\nI remember that I also need at least 2\n\n410\n00:22:43.073 --> 00:22:47.750\ngigs for the host machine to be able\nto run as well if I'm doing this.\n\n411\n00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:52.200\nSo, that's some of the other options that\nyou can also set up as well when you start\n\n412\n00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.920\ntalking about configuring that machine and\nsome of the advanced configurations too.\n\n413\n00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.710\n>> Now,\nsome of the post installation tasks,\n\n414\n00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.890\nI know that we have to do\na lot of times in the VMs.\n\n415\n00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.100\nIf you want an accurate test on your VMG,\nyou certainly don't have to update them,\n\n416\n00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.370\nif you're isolating them.\n\n417\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.370\nBut, one of the things that I know that\nI have to do is if when I'm bringing up\n\n418\n00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.620\na VM, a lot of times the installation\nmedia, it could be six months out of date.\n\n419\n00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.890\nAnd the first thing that we need\nto do is we need to update the VM.\n\n420\n00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.210\nSo is there a way that if we are going\nto configure this virtual machine,\n\n421\n00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.630\nwe've been virtualizing all the other\nhardware, how about the network adapters?\n\n422\n00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.650\nCan we set it up in a way, different ways\nmaybe even that they can communicate?\n\n423\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.620\n>> You really can.\n\n424\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.380\nRemember that the default\nthat we get right,\n\n425\n00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.370\nis actually just connecting data and\ntrying to get us a network connection.\n\n426\n00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.480\nBut depending on what you need and\nhow you want it set up,\n\n427\n00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.960\nthere are multiple ways you can\nchange the network connections.\n\n428\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:44.310\nSo let me show you how to do that inside\nof a virtual VM workstation here.\n\n429\n00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:48.218\nSo, if I right-click\non my Windows 8 VM and\n\n430\n00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:53.516\ngo back to Settings, then,\nI can select Network Adapter.\n\n431\n00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:58.307\nNow by default, the Network Adapter\nis set on what we call NAT.\n\n432\n00:23:58.307 --> 00:24:03.247\nAnd I like the way that they describe\nthis, when you choose that NAT setting,\n\n433\n00:24:03.247 --> 00:24:04.159\nthe default,\n\n434\n00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:09.410\nit essentially says hey we're actually\ngoing to use to share the host IP address.\n\n435\n00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.237\nNow, what the heck does that mean?\n\n436\n00:24:11.237 --> 00:24:14.319\nWell, NAT is network\naddress translation and\n\n437\n00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:18.516\nwhat this does is it creates\na virtual network adapter, okay?\n\n438\n00:24:18.516 --> 00:24:23.187\nThat allows for\nthis machine to essentially use your host\n\n439\n00:24:23.187 --> 00:24:28.490\nnetwork adapter as a router,\nis what ends up happening.\n\n440\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.870\nSo you end up actually\ngetting an IP address\n\n441\n00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.270\nin this network that doesn't\nmake any sense at all.\n\n442\n00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.980\nIt's a private IP address.\n\n443\n00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:41.230\nAnd then it uses your host machine to get\nout to the network that says connected on.\n\n444\n00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:45.420\nWhich also allows it to get out,\nof course, to well, the world, as well,\n\n445\n00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.740\nif it's actually also\nconnected out to the Internet.\n\n446\n00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.590\nNow, when we use something like that, this\nis the slowest type of network connector\n\n447\n00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.170\nadapter we have, but it's also one of\nthe defaults that we have, as well.\n\n448\n00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:56.765\nBecause it ends up doing something we\ncall double-NATing, is what happens.\n\n449\n00:24:56.765 --> 00:24:59.438\nNetwork address translation\ntakes private IP address and\n\n450\n00:24:59.438 --> 00:25:01.188\ntranslates it into another address.\n\n451\n00:25:01.188 --> 00:25:04.112\nAnd then when it's on your physical\nnetwork, wherever you are,\n\n452\n00:25:04.112 --> 00:25:07.617\nsuch as you're on the ITProTV network,\nwell for us to get out to the Internet,\n\n453\n00:25:07.617 --> 00:25:11.310\nwe're also the behind a router\nwhich we're also do NATing, again.\n\n454\n00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.200\nSo it has to translate the address\ninto a public IP address out there and\n\n455\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.440\nthen when traffic comes\nback it takes that public,\n\n456\n00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.330\ntranslates is a back\ninto the ITProTV network.\n\n457\n00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.690\nAnd then the ITProTV network\ngets translated back into, well,\n\n458\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.740\nthe virtual box NAT network here.\n\n459\n00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.700\nThe network address translation here too.\n\n460\n00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.890\nThat's the default and\nit works incredibly well.\n\n461\n00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:38.290\nIt hides that virtual machine behind your\nhost machine so that nobody can actually\n\n462\n00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:43.750\nget access to it from the physical network\nexcept for well, whoever is on the host.\n\n463\n00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.490\nUnless they know how to get access inside\nthat virtual machine, which they can't.\n\n464\n00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.420\nSo this is probably\nthe standard way to do this.\n\n465\n00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.540\nBut notice that we have what we\ncall a bridge connection and\n\n466\n00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.370\nwe also have some other ones here.\n\n467\n00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:59.684\nThe bridged network adaptor gives\nus the ability to expose our\n\n468\n00:25:59.684 --> 00:26:05.750\nvirtual machine's network\nadapter to the physical network.\n\n469\n00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.970\nSo even though my own host machine,\nthe one that I'm on right now,\n\n470\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.790\nhas an IP address on my network, and\nif I use NAT, my virtual machine doesn't.\n\n471\n00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:17.120\nIt just uses me as being that gateway out.\n\n472\n00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.837\nBridged allows that virtual machine\nto also get an IP address on my\n\n473\n00:26:21.837 --> 00:26:23.568\nphysical network too.\n\n474\n00:26:23.568 --> 00:26:27.631\nAnd the way that we do that is\nwe simply select this one, so\n\n475\n00:26:27.631 --> 00:26:31.722\nlet's say that mine's 172.16.95.101.\n\n476\n00:26:31.722 --> 00:26:35.850\nWell if I select bridge,\nthat one can become .102 or .103 or\n\n477\n00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.550\nwhatever's actually available for us.\n\n478\n00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:42.990\nBut the only way to do that is to make\nsure that we replicate the physical\n\n479\n00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.810\nnetwork connection state.\n\n480\n00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.610\nIf I leave this check mark off,\n\n481\n00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:52.350\nI have to statically assign an IP\naddress in this virtual machine.\n\n482\n00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:56.100\nIf I replicate my physical\nnetwork connection,\n\n483\n00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:00.680\nmy physical network adapter\nis running on a DHCP address.\n\n484\n00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.110\nSo that means what?\n\n485\n00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.300\nThis will also what?\n\n486\n00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.140\nReplicate that too, and\n\n487\n00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:09.520\nthen it will also be able to respond\nback to a DHTP server as well.\n\n488\n00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.360\nSo those are actually the two that you\nwould need to make sure you check.\n\n489\n00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.030\nA lot of times people go oh I don't need\nto replicate it because that will just\n\n490\n00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.450\nduplicate the addresses.\n\n491\n00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:18.470\nThat's not what it's doing.\n\n492\n00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.740\nYou need to do that If you want\nit to actually use DHCP, if not,\n\n493\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.130\nyou'll not get an address.\n\n494\n00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.320\nSo you wanna make sure that you know that,\nokay?\n\n495\n00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.430\nThe host only creates a virtual\nnetwork between your physical machine,\n\n496\n00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:36.170\nyour host machine, and your VM and\nputs it on its own separate network.\n\n497\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.080\nSo I can communicate between the host and,\nof course,\n\n498\n00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.900\nthe VM but on a separate network.\n\n499\n00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:46.164\nAnd it also ends up creating a virtual\nnetwork adaptor for us here too.\n\n500\n00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:49.090\nAnd you might be wondering\nwhy does it need to do that?\n\n501\n00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.621\nWhy can't it just send\ninformation back and forth?\n\n502\n00:27:51.621 --> 00:27:52.350\nBecause it can't.\n\n503\n00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.680\nIt's actually seeing itself\nas being a separate machine.\n\n504\n00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.256\nSo, this actually allows for a private\nnetwork connection just between those two.\n\n505\n00:28:00.256 --> 00:28:04.573\nI wonder why in the world would I need\nsomething like that to actually work and\n\n506\n00:28:04.573 --> 00:28:05.730\ndo what I need to do.\n\n507\n00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:10.372\nIf you've ever used some type of network\nmonitoring software like Wireshark,\n\n508\n00:28:10.372 --> 00:28:12.935\nthe reason why you want\nthat is because now,\n\n509\n00:28:12.935 --> 00:28:17.578\nyou can actually scan that traffic and\nbe able to actually do the packet sniffing\n\n510\n00:28:17.578 --> 00:28:21.902\noff that virtual network adapter\nbetween your host machine and your VMs.\n\n511\n00:28:21.902 --> 00:28:25.660\nOkay, so it's very important that you\nmight actually choose to do something like\n\n512\n00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.910\nthat as well.\n\n513\n00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:32.110\nYou can also create your own custom\nnetworks if you wanted to attach a single\n\n514\n00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.230\nVM to multiple networks at the same time.\n\n515\n00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.110\nSo, you can also do that, and\nthen you also have a LAN segment.\n\n516\n00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:42.420\nA LAN segment allows you to make\na customized type of virtual switch\n\n517\n00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.520\nthat you can attach only other VMs to.\n\n518\n00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.280\nSo, it's very easy for\n\n519\n00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.870\nyou to actually become a little bit\nmore confused about these things, but\n\n520\n00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.910\neven in this explanation,\nright, it's not enough detail.\n\n521\n00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:59.400\nThere's plenty more of documentation\nthat's out there from VMware as well,\n\n522\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.180\nbut a lot of us, we're probably\ngonna leave it at this NAT, or\n\n523\n00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.380\nwe're actually at the bridged if we need\nto expose it to the physical network.\n\n524\n00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.060\nAnd you might think,\nwhen would I ever do that?\n\n525\n00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.190\nIf you're running a server,\nif you're running a web server and\n\n526\n00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.630\nyou were wanting to do testing and\nyou gotta look.\n\n527\n00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.130\nWes, I need to test this out.\n\n528\n00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.130\nIt's on the VM on my,\nwell, what can Wes do?\n\n529\n00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.810\nWes would have to actually be allowed\nphysically to come to my machine\n\n530\n00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.350\nto be able to run a test, or I could\nactually simply set it up as bridge.\n\n531\n00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.180\nPut that check mark there and\ntell Wes what the IP address is,\n\n532\n00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.860\nthen Wes can go and check that machine\nout, by himself by connecting network.\n\n533\n00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.240\nNow what would be incumbent upon\nme though is after I'm done,\n\n534\n00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.600\nright, is to make sure that I remove\nthat and put it back onto NAT.\n\n535\n00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.000\nOr even one of these constant networks,\nthat he wouldn't be able to find.\n\n536\n00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.830\nNow in the whole time behind the whole\nthing, we mentioned also DHCP.\n\n537\n00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.860\nWhen you're using NAT, and\n\n538\n00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:55.010\nthese custom networks,\nit sets up its own DHCP server as well.\n\n539\n00:29:55.010 --> 00:30:00.020\nSo it can actually assign IP addresses to\nanybody that's also connected to this.\n\n540\n00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.310\nI can actually take all these other\nmultiple virtual machines over here and\n\n541\n00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.840\nset them up to the same custom network,\nand\n\n542\n00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.020\nit will also get IP addresses\non that network as well.\n\n543\n00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:13.430\nSo that way I can actually create my\nown test bed environment if I wanted to\n\n544\n00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.200\nto make sure that\neverything was going well.\n\n545\n00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.380\nThey would get assigned\nthe same DHCP addresses,\n\n546\n00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.290\nthey'd be on the same network,\nand that way we can actually have\n\n547\n00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.370\nall the testing that we want\nset up the way that we want it.\n\n548\n00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.330\nAnd it really is,\nit's a very neat structure for\n\n549\n00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:31.320\nus to be able to provide a very\ndiverse network change that we can.\n\n550\n00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.510\nInside of a Windows machine I think\nwe're limited to ten network adapters\n\n551\n00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.860\nthat we can attach.\n\n552\n00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.790\nIf you're running a Linux\nbased machine I think\n\n553\n00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.460\nit's 255 networks are actually possible.\n\n554\n00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.620\nI don't know why you would do that, but\nit's possible if I remember correctly.\n\n555\n00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.903\n>> Just in case you wanna communicate with\neverybody in the world from one single\n\n556\n00:30:48.903 --> 00:30:49.468\nworkbench.\n\n557\n00:30:49.468 --> 00:30:51.569\nIt can just be your own ISP at that point,\nright?\n\n558\n00:30:51.569 --> 00:30:52.950\n>> At some point, yeah.\n\n559\n00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.007\nThere's no doubt.\n\n560\n00:30:54.007 --> 00:30:57.150\nSo just kinda realize that there\nare plenty of network options for us.\n\n561\n00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:01.290\n>> Well we have talked about a lot of\ndifferent advanced features, remember if\n\n562\n00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.190\nyou do have to reconfigure a virtual\nmachine, you have that capabilities.\n\n563\n00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.210\nWe've showed you how to add\nan additional storage, so\n\n564\n00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.138\nif you're like me, and\nI'm taking the minimalistic approach,\n\n565\n00:31:10.138 --> 00:31:13.330\nacross the whole entire board, and\nI need more storage, we can do that.\n\n566\n00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.270\nWe've looked at adding more horsepower,\nright?\n\n567\n00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.690\nAdding some more CPUs in case you do\nneed that computational power, and\n\n568\n00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.600\nwhen you initially set up that machine,\nyou just didn't allocate it enough.\n\n569\n00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.350\nWe've looked at how you can add more RAM,\nin case you need a bigger workbench,\n\n570\n00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.330\nmore applications running at one time.\n\n571\n00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.663\nWe've also looked at networking and\nsome of the different options for\n\n572\n00:31:31.663 --> 00:31:32.970\nconfiguring networking.\n\n573\n00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.476\nAnd depending upon how you\nneed it to communicate,\n\n574\n00:31:35.476 --> 00:31:38.271\nkeep in mind that if you\nare attaching it to your network,\n\n575\n00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:42.057\nit's gonna be vulnerable to all the\nnetwork attacks just like we talked about\n\n576\n00:31:42.057 --> 00:31:45.170\nin some of those security episodes,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n577\n00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.510\nRonnie, you got anything else\nyou'd like to tell us about?\n\n578\n00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.010\n>> Well, remember that even\nwith all this right, and\n\n579\n00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:52.210\ngiving it configured,\nthese advanced configurations,\n\n580\n00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.640\nthere's still probably other\noptions that we need to look at.\n\n581\n00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.660\nBut that goes into more\nmanaging of the VMs as well.\n\n582\n00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.750\nWhen we have multiple networks\nthat we can actually do.\n\n583\n00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.360\nBut because Wes also let\nme talk too long again,\n\n584\n00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.750\nwe're actually going to have to\npush this to another episode.\n\n585\n00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:06.728\n>> [LAUGH] All right, very good.\n\n586\n00:32:06.728 --> 00:32:10.560\nWell, we've come to the end of\nanother episode here at

Bryan.\n\n3\n00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:20.703\nAnd today's episode we're gonna be moving\nalong in Virtualization Technologies.\n\n4\n00:00:20.703 --> 00:00:22.359\nNow over the last couple of episodes,\n\n5\n00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.920\nwe've been talking about\nthe VMware Workstation.\n\n6\n00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.170\nWe showed you how to\nconfigure the software,\n\n7\n00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.970\nget VM software installed on the machines.\n\n8\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.570\nWe also showed you how to bring a virtual\nmachine online and then get it configured.\n\n9\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.770\nNow one of the things that's gonna be\nessential to virtualization technologies\n\n10\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.670\nis once you have your virtual\nmachines up and running.\n\n11\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.320\nThere is gonna be some ongoing\nmaintenance that you're gonna have to do.\n\n12\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.280\nTo make sure that they stay efficient\ninside of your environment and\n\n13\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.550\nwe have Mister Ronnie Wong\nhere to help us out with that.\n\n14\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.410\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n15\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.420\n>> It's going well.\n\n16\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.370\nAs we continue to take a look\nat VMware Workstation,\n\n17\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.250\nwhat we wanna do now is talk\nabout managing VMs, right?\n\n18\n00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.720\nThe very fact is getting\nthe VMware Workstation installed and\n\n19\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.630\neven getting a virtual machine up and\nrunning, it takes a little bit of time.\n\n20\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.890\nBut once you do one, well,\n\n21\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.040\nyou tend to follow the same pattern and\nit becomes easy.\n\n22\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.890\nOne of the things that ends up happening\nthough is that we start making assumptions\n\n23\n00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.830\nabout the idea of the VMs.\n\n24\n00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.800\nThat once we get it up and\n\n25\n00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.630\nrunning, we don't really tend to\nhave to worry about them after that.\n\n26\n00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.780\nAnd the problem that you have is that they\ncan actually end up doing something that\n\n27\n00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.000\nwe don't want them to do.\n\n28\n00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.310\nAnd I've done this before myself,\nWes, which is I've gone ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.440\nI've installed it.\n\n30\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.270\nAnd I've left them actually up and\nrunning in the background for\n\n31\n00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200\n24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n32\n00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.660\nRunning on my own workstation\nPC that I've had,\n\n33\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.830\ngoing on in the background, just because I\nwanted to, actually I forgot about them.\n\n34\n00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.635\nIs what ended up happening and\nafter awhile some things can actually\n\n35\n00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:50.235\nend up happening and I wanna talk\nabout things like that as well.\n\n36\n00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.135\n>> Now one of the things that you\nshowed us in a previous episode\n\n37\n00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:56.695\nare how the virtual machines\nhave virtual hardware, right?\n\n38\n00:01:56.695 --> 00:01:59.625\nVirtual hardware, as well as something\nknown as your virtual hard drives, or\n\n39\n00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:00.990\nvirtual hard disk.\n\n40\n00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.950\nAnd one of the things that the virtual\nhard disk support are all of the normal\n\n41\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.920\ndisk operations.\n\n42\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.265\nNow Ronnie, one of the things I know with\nphysical drives is that you do have to\n\n43\n00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:10.995\nmaintain them.\n\n44\n00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:12.409\nBecause as you use them more,\n\n45\n00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.360\nwe could start to see some\nperformance degradations on them.\n\n46\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.650\nAnd we know that we have host\nmachines that these virtual machines\n\n47\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.300\nare running on.\n\n48\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.250\nSo I can only imagine that that's\ngonna effect the host machine too,\n\n49\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.200\nis that the case here?\n\n50\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.940\n>> It really is,\n\n51\n00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.140\nit's gonna effect the actual VMs\nthat we end up using a lot of times.\n\n52\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.780\nJust in the same way that if you\nuse your PC everyday for work.\n\n53\n00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.270\nAfter awhile what's gonna end up\nhappening is you're gonna feel it kind of\n\n54\n00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.720\nfeel a little bit sluggish.\n\n55\n00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.600\nYou're gonna feel some of the things\nactually not work as quickly as the way\n\n56\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.410\nthat they did.\n\n57\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.960\nSuch as after a fresh install\nof the operating system and\n\n58\n00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.140\neverything is put back brand new on it.\n\n59\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.720\nWell, inside of a VM the same\nthings can also end up happening.\n\n60\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.110\nNow, we don't think\nabout it in those terms.\n\n61\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.960\nAnd the reason why is because\nwe're not actually concerned about\n\n62\n00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.320\na physical hard drive, a lot of times.\n\n63\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.020\nWe're not concerned about files being\nmoved around because we actually only\n\n64\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.100\nthink about them as being virtualized.\n\n65\n00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.060\nAnd when you actually do that,\nthat's perfectly fine, but\n\n66\n00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.690\nremember the operating system really is.\n\n67\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.030\nIt's treating that file\nthat it create as a VHD or\n\n68\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.770\na virtual hard disk here\nas an actual hard drive.\n\n69\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.870\nAnd so it can actually read and\nwrite to that file and\n\n70\n00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.940\ndo all the things that it would\nnormally do on a regular hard drive.\n\n71\n00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.510\nAnd it still has actually\ndo stuff like that.\n\n72\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.820\nSo there is a point in time that\nwhen you actually start doing that\n\n73\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.460\non the physical drive and\neven inside of your VMs.\n\n74\n00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.260\nThat things can slow down.\n\n75\n00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.980\nSo it's important for us to actually\nunderstand that there are some managing\n\n76\n00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.940\ntechniques that you and\nI have to be aware of.\n\n77\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.440\nSometimes it's gonna happen of course,\nwithin the VM itself.\n\n78\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.820\nSometimes though, we also have to take\ncharge of it and go outside of the VM.\n\n79\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.238\nInto the VMware Workstation to be able to\ncontrol these hard drives and help us out.\n\n80\n00:03:48.238 --> 00:03:51.150\nSo we wanna take a look at some of\nthe maintenance stuff that we can do.\n\n81\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.920\nSo one of the first things that we\nwanna talk about of course is just\n\n82\n00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.540\ncompacting the actual drive as well.\n\n83\n00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.440\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of compacting the drive,\n\n84\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.230\nwhy is that actually important?\n\n85\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.430\nWell, as Asi Hablo said,\ndynamically created hard drive\n\n86\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.350\nthat's a virtual file, that's a file,\nexcuse me, that's a virtual hard drive.\n\n87\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.360\nWhen I create one of those, remember that\nI can expand it and it can contract.\n\n88\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.020\nIf I use it and\n\n89\n00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.270\nthen I continue to add in more and\nmore data to that virtual hard drive.\n\n90\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.240\nWell, that file can grow, it can change\nand it adds in more and more information.\n\n91\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.450\nIf I delete files off it, it can actually\nend up using less space inside of it.\n\n92\n00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.940\nAnd this is actually very important,\nespecially when you have a limited amount\n\n93\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.556\nof hardware on your machine that you're\nusing for hosting all those VMs.\n\n94\n00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:42.560\nSo, all of the sudden, what ends up\nhappening is that you keep creating\n\n95\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.888\nmore and\nmore VMs inside of VMware Workstation.\n\n96\n00:04:44.888 --> 00:04:47.370\nAnd all of the sudden you\nstart realizing something,\n\n97\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.590\nyou're running low on the physical\ndisk space on the host machine.\n\n98\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.290\nWell, what are some of\nthe things that you can do, so\n\n99\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.790\nthat you may actually be able to\ntake advantage of those machines?\n\n100\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.700\nWell, one of them is compacting\nthe actual virtual machines,\n\n101\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.620\nessentially limiting the size of that\nhard drive whatever it might be.\n\n102\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.360\nSo that we can say look, I'm gonna\ncreate another virtual machine instead.\n\n103\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.440\nAnd what that's gonna end up doing for\nus is give me some room so I can do that.\n\n104\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.820\nSo let me show you how to\nactually do that here.\n\n105\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.330\nSo here it is.\n\n106\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.850\nI'm on my workstation and we're\nrunning VMWare Workstation over here.\n\n107\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.260\nAnd I've just got it up and running,\nI've got all these VMs running here.\n\n108\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.650\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at these things.\n\n109\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.490\nNow, if I select this, the only way I can\ndo this is if I shutdown the machine.\n\n110\n00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.197\nSo let's take for an example this\nparticular Windows 8 VM that I have.\n\n111\n00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:38.687\nIf I click on Settings,\n\n112\n00:05:38.687 --> 00:05:43.800\nnotice that I have these two 60 gig\nhard drives that are available for us.\n\n113\n00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.930\nNow with these two 60 gighard drives,\n\n114\n00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.646\nIf I'm using them fully\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n115\n00:05:48.646 --> 00:05:51.840\nBut let's say that what ends up\nhappening though, is that I've only\n\n116\n00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.750\nbeen able to use let's say about 20\ngigs of the 120 gigs that I've given it.\n\n117\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.580\nWell, I can instead actually end\nup compacting these drives, so\n\n118\n00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.760\nI can shrink down what the maximum size\nof these drives is going to end up being.\n\n119\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.390\nSo the first thing that I need to do\nis shut down this machine here, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.190\nOops, let me see if I can\nactually stay on that machine and\n\n121\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.500\nlet me shut this machine down.\n\n122\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.430\n>> Now this is, Ronnie,\napparently another one of those operations\n\n123\n00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.460\nlike we've looked in some\nof the previous episodes.\n\n124\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.400\nWhere certain functionalities or\n\n125\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.710\nfunctions operations cannot happen\nuntil the machine's offline.\n\n126\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.170\n>> That's definitely true here, because\nyou don't want anything going on like this\n\n127\n00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.220\nwhen there's a possibility\nthat you're still reading and\n\n128\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.990\nwriting to that virtual drive.\n\n129\n00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.720\nOr you might end up possibly losing data.\n\n130\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.370\nSo now that we've got it shut down,\nwe need to get into some of these\n\n131\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.600\nutilities and we're gonna go into\nthe compacting utility first.\n\n132\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.220\nSo, I've got the access to\nthese drives right here.\n\n133\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.550\nIf I go and select that first virtual\ndisks that I have, I just clicked on it.\n\n134\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.810\nAnd then I verified that\nI have it access here.\n\n135\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.860\nNow notice that I have this disk\nutilities I actually opened available for\n\n136\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.060\nme to be able to use.\n\n137\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.594\nSo what I'm talking about the idea\nof compacting the disk to reclaim\n\n138\n00:07:02.594 --> 00:07:03.700\na new space.\n\n139\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.080\nSo this is a very good utility for\nus inside of that virtual machine.\n\n140\n00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.364\nBecause if I know that it looks like that\nthis machine is only gonna stay this big,\n\n141\n00:07:12.364 --> 00:07:14.391\nwhy did I give it a 60 gig hard drive?\n\n142\n00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:17.724\nWell, that's because at the beginning when\nI used a kind of template to be able to\n\n143\n00:07:17.724 --> 00:07:18.580\ncreate this.\n\n144\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.200\nIt said you need a 60 gig drive so\nit automatically assigned it to me.\n\n145\n00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.050\nBut all I have to do now is select\nCompact and it will go ahead and\n\n146\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.280\ncompact this disk.\n\n147\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.900\nNow, it might happen\nalmost instantaneously.\n\n148\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.850\nAnd you might be wondering like wow, that\nshould be cool and it normally is, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.680\nIt normally is gonna be that easy and\n\n150\n00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.880\nthat fast, a lot of times especially if\nyou're not interacting with that drive.\n\n151\n00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.280\nBut if this particular machine was\nactually in heavy usage all the time.\n\n152\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.210\nYou might actually find it\ntaking a little bit more time.\n\n153\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.390\nBecause more and\n\n154\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.740\nmore data has actually been spread\nout over to that virtual hard drive.\n\n155\n00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.900\nSo what does that mean that\nwe actually really need to do\n\n156\n00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.828\nbefore I do something like this?\n\n157\n00:07:57.828 --> 00:08:02.321\nWell, just like everything else, right,\nthat you actually have virtualized.\n\n158\n00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:04.628\nWell inside of the operating system,\n\n159\n00:08:04.628 --> 00:08:09.560\nyou also have access to the ability\nto put things in the proper order.\n\n160\n00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.820\nAnd, when you actually do\nsomething like that, right,\n\n161\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.490\nyou're actually lining up all those files\nin the order they need to be, and putting\n\n162\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.280\nthem inside of that virtual hard drive in\nthe order that they should be on as well.\n\n163\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.890\nYou're essentially\ncompacting it there too.\n\n164\n00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.830\nSo, best practice is this.\n\n165\n00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.140\nBefore you run something like this, you're\ngonna open up that Virtual Machine and\n\n166\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:33.130\nyou're gonna run that disk defragmenter\ninside of the Virtual Machine.\n\n167\n00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.810\nOne, that will actually help you on the\nperformance inside that Virtual Machine.\n\n168\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.740\nTwo, that will essentially move all\nthe files to one side of the hard drive,\n\n169\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.170\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n170\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.180\nThe closest compaction\nthat it can actually be.\n\n171\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.100\nSo that you have plenty of free space and\nthat way when it does the compacting says,\n\n172\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.860\noh look, Ronnie has already gone ahead and\nrun the disk defragmenter and\n\n173\n00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.190\nmoved all the stuff over so\nthat I can now reclaim this space.\n\n174\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.640\nIf you don't do that,\n\n175\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.430\neven though VM Ware Workstation may\nbe able to work around that right?\n\n176\n00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.710\nUsually what ends up happening is,\n\n177\n00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.840\nit sees that last little piece that you\nleft at the furthest regions outside.\n\n178\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.350\nIt says I'll compact up onto that point,\nbut I'm not gonna go any further, when\n\n179\n00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.130\nall you had to do was actually go inside\nof your disk utility and compact it.\n\n180\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.200\nAnd that actually moves\nthings a little bit nicer and\n\n181\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.430\nprobably gives you more\ncontiguous free space.\n\n182\n00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.660\n>> There we go.\nI was gonna say so\n\n183\n00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.160\nif I understand it right now\nyou're talking about going in\n\n184\n00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.900\nnot the host operating system at first.\n\n185\n00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.420\nWe're talking about going\ninto the guest machine,\n\n186\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.250\nthe virtual machine, rearranging those\nfiles in a contiguous fashion and\n\n187\n00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.280\nthen moving out to the virtual\nmachine platform itself.\n\n188\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.940\n>> That would be the best practice, right?\n\n189\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:38.980\nEspecially on those machines.\n\n190\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.710\nNow, I didn't worry about it too\nmuch on this one, the reason why,\n\n191\n00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.520\nis I just installed it\nin a previous episode.\n\n192\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.490\nSo it wasn't that long ago.\n\n193\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.600\nBut yes, if you have been\nusing the virtual machine for\n\n194\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.870\na while, you may want to do that.\n\n195\n00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.500\nIf you go, look,\n\n196\n00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.740\nI'm not really using all that space, it's\nkind of actually useless for me to have.\n\n197\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.050\nThose 60 GIGS they're unavailable when I\ncould possibly be using that space for\n\n198\n00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.290\nanother virtual machine that I need to.\n\n199\n00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.140\nBut once that's done that's what\nyou actually have the ability.\n\n200\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.960\nSo, the compacting of it is really\na very good thing that we can do,\n\n201\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.460\nespecially when we actually are running\nout of the space to do that.\n\n202\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.720\nAnd you may wonder like,\nis that ever gonna really happen?\n\n203\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.290\nIt does happen in a production environment\nand I've actually been a part of this.\n\n204\n00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.730\nWe actually had a XenServer.\n\n205\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.190\nNow, this is another virtualization\nproduct across three different machines\n\n206\n00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.240\nand we very easily started running out\nof hard drive space on those machines.\n\n207\n00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.450\nAnd it wasn't that we were\nbeing overly generous,\n\n208\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.230\nwith every single one of\nthose virtual machines.\n\n209\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.670\nBut there were some that we\nmade in the very beginning.\n\n210\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.360\nWe were overly generous but\nthen once we had those up we\n\n211\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.200\nstarted realizing we're eating\nthrough some disk space\n\n212\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.530\nthen we starting becoming more mindful\nof how big we made the drive after that.\n\n213\n00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.950\nBut at the beginning we used\nthe standard templates.\n\n214\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.350\nThose standard templates\nare incredibly generous.\n\n215\n00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.570\nWell then, you might have to go\nback a little bit latter on and\n\n216\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.250\nreclaim some of that space so we can\nactually create more virtual machines and\n\n217\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.110\nwe've actually had to do that\na couple of times before.\n\n218\n00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.850\nBut here inside of VM Ware Workstation\nsince you might be running this on a desk\n\n219\n00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.970\ntop environment like what I am.\n\n220\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.200\nYeah, you may actually go ahead and\n\n221\n00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.040\ndo that and that will help you especially\nwhen you start running out of those\n\n222\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.270\nresources unavailable\nthat you have as well.\n\n223\n00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.170\nSo at least take a look at\nthe idea of compaction.\n\n224\n00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.910\nNow, the other one that\nwe have here is this one.\n\n225\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.830\nAnd I'm gonna throw Wes off just for\na moment here.\n\n226\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.180\nThere's one that say expand.\n\n227\n00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.400\nSo this is the opposite right.\n\n228\n00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.490\nThe very fact is, you may be like me that\nafter you get stung a couple of times\n\n229\n00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.370\nwhere you've actually said, man we were\nway too generous at the beginning,\n\n230\n00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:47.670\nall of a sudden, now you're going the last\ntime I installed it took about 3 gigs.\n\n231\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.850\nSo let me only give it 4 gigs of space,\n\n232\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.390\ninstead of the standard eight that\nit normally is going to give you.\n\n233\n00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.300\nYou can actually use something\nlike this to help you.\n\n234\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.020\n>> It has bitten me too, because as we've\ntalked, and you guys have probably seen,\n\n235\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.590\nI take the minimalistic approach and\nI say, well you know,\n\n236\n00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:09.130\nwe know what the minimum requirements for\ninstalling Windows, around 40 gigs or so.\n\n237\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.100\nBut then I have to install\nthings like Office,\n\n238\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.110\nthen I have to install\nother products out there.\n\n239\n00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.840\nMaybe I have to install the creative\nsuite, and all of a sudden those 40 gigs,\n\n240\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.690\nor even 60 gigs, aren't cutting it and\nthen unfortunately now you're in a bind.\n\n241\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.280\nAnd if it's a production\nenvironment type machine,\n\n242\n00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.990\nnow we gotta have some techniques and\nutilities to make sure that we don't have\n\n243\n00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.030\nto bring the whole machine offline and\nthen start the whole process.\n\n244\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.720\nSo, it kind of takes me back to what\nyou said in an earlier episode,\n\n245\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.010\nthat when you build your machines,\nstart right first.\n\n246\n00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.870\nPlan for what the machine is gonna do.\n\n247\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.588\n>> Yeah, you do.\n\n248\n00:12:37.588 --> 00:12:40.900\nAnd that's a great thing for\nWes to remind us about as well.\n\n249\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.210\nThe very fact is, even when we start out\nwith that template that it gives us,\n\n250\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.210\nwe have to take a look at maybe our\nproduction machines that we're going to\n\n251\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.940\nreally be mimicking what our virtual\nmachines are gonna be based off of.\n\n252\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.190\nAnd gotta look I know\nthat on this machine,\n\n253\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.940\n100 gigs is probably about standard.\n\n254\n00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.440\nWell if you have to do\nthat it's perfectly fine.\n\n255\n00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.720\nRemember that if your creating that inside\nof the VM ware work station and you're\n\n256\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.000\ndoing that dynamically expanding drive,\nyou're just setting the upper limit to it.\n\n257\n00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.045\nYou're not actually going\nto use all 100 gigs,\n\n258\n00:13:09.045 --> 00:13:12.580\nunless you statically\nset that drive to do so.\n\n259\n00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:18.640\nSo, do take advantage of those features\nthat really don't end up costing\n\n260\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.000\nyou too much space but also remember that\nin the end you may also have to expand it.\n\n261\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.400\nNormally the reason why we do have to\nexpand it is if we did set that static\n\n262\n00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.000\nvirtual disc.\n\n263\n00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.670\nI want to call it a VHD but\nthat's a proprietary Microsoft thing,\n\n264\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.000\nand so I need to quit calling it that\neven though that makes sense here.\n\n265\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.170\nI can actually expand that file out so\n\n266\n00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:43.380\nI can actually add in additional\nstorage space if I need to as well.\n\n267\n00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.160\nSo it's fairly simple.\n\n268\n00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.750\nYou go ahead and\nclick on Expand at this point.\n\n269\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.710\nAnd once you do so, notice you're\nactually now telling it, hey,\n\n270\n00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.000\nwhat is the maximum size\nthat you're gonna do.\n\n271\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.700\nSo here it's giving you that\nability to increase that,\n\n272\n00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.660\nto be able to do what you want to do here.\n\n273\n00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.570\nBut remember you also have to be careful,\nright?\n\n274\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.530\nIf you have multiple virtual machines,\n\n275\n00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.900\nthat means you also have to take a look\nat the physical drive itself, and\n\n276\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.910\nsee whether or not you're gonna\nrun into other issues too.\n\n277\n00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.970\nNow, I'm not trying to make\nit overly complicated.\n\n278\n00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.960\nI'm just trying to give you\nthe realistic sense that\n\n279\n00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.640\nwe might go we'll just\ngive it another 200 gigs.\n\n280\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.020\nWell what if you only had 300\ngigs that were free space?\n\n281\n00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.480\nAnd now you're giving this Virtual Machine\n200 gigs and you still have five or\n\n282\n00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.660\nsix Virtual Machines\nthat you want to expand.\n\n283\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.760\nThat's when you start having issues again.\n\n284\n00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.920\nSo do be careful with the expansion part.\n\n285\n00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:36.670\nDoing the compacting is really kind of\na neat thing, because it really will save\n\n286\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.950\nyou space, and will help you\nout if you need to add in more.\n\n287\n00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:44.320\nBut expanding can really reduce your\nperformance if you're not careful.\n\n288\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.120\nAnd of course, there's what we call the\ndefragment, now you might wanna, Ronnie,\n\n289\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:55.580\ndidn't you just talk about defragmenting\ninside the actual Virtual Machine itself?\n\n290\n00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.840\nYes I did.\n\n291\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.020\nAnd you might be wondering like okay,\nso, from redefragmenting it,\n\n292\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.520\nyou're telling that VMware\nwill also defragment for you?\n\n293\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.330\nWell yeah, it really would.\n\n294\n00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.785\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think I understand this right, and\n\n295\n00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:10.595\nhelp me out here.\n\n296\n00:15:10.595 --> 00:15:14.375\nYou're talking about the operating system\nhas its native disk defragmenters.\n\n297\n00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:17.965\nBut now what we're talking about is\nessentially what the hypervisor sees,\n\n298\n00:15:17.965 --> 00:15:19.065\nthe hypervisor software.\n\n299\n00:15:19.065 --> 00:15:22.455\nSo we have that double\ndefragmentation we gotta worry.\n\n300\n00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:23.895\nNow that gets a little bit twisty, Ronnie.\n\n301\n00:15:23.895 --> 00:15:25.845\n>> It does, and there's a reason for this.\n\n302\n00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:30.140\nAnd when we think about it, it actually\ndoes make sense in the way that VMware\n\n303\n00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.570\nreally does expect you to use this.\n\n304\n00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:37.255\nIf you've set a static file, okay, so if,\nif you're using, let's say my Windows\n\n305\n00:15:37.255 --> 00:15:41.000\n8.1 as your production machine that you're\ngonna base other people's work station off\n\n306\n00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.180\nof, and you give it that 60 GIG drive and\nit's actually a static file.\n\n307\n00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.830\nThe recommendation, of course, is if\nyou're using conventional hard drives.\n\n308\n00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:54.770\nTo use the actual defragmenter that's\nactually inside of Windows 8.1.\n\n309\n00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:55.360\nOkay?\n\n310\n00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.484\nOr all the Windows operating\nsystems that you're doing.\n\n311\n00:15:58.484 --> 00:16:01.969\nSo if it's a static file,\nit recommends that you use that.\n\n312\n00:16:01.969 --> 00:16:09.530\nBut if you though,\nare using that dynamic sized drive, right?\n\n313\n00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.860\nThe one that expands to the ultimate\nsize that we give it, or\n\n314\n00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:18.120\nit doesn't ever really\nhave to use all that\n\n315\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.740\nsize I can't say what I want to,\nthe rest of that volume, right.\n\n316\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.850\nSo in other words, if it's dynamically\nable to expand as well as contract,\n\n317\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:32.130\nthen the recommendation by VMware is to\nset a regular schedule that you come in,\n\n318\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:36.520\nyou shut down that machine, and\nyou use the defragment tool here.\n\n319\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.900\nSo dynamically expanding hard drive,\n\n320\n00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.490\nthis is the one that they\nrecommend that you use.\n\n321\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.280\nIf you actually have that static file,\n\n322\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.780\nrecommend that you use the one inside\nof the virtual machine itself.\n\n323\n00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.960\nNow, just when we think that we're\ndone and we're finished, we are not.\n\n324\n00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.770\nEspecially on the defragment.\n\n325\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.750\nAnd the reason why that we're not done,\nis because even though that actually does\n\n326\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.830\nthat for those files and it actually makes\nit better because VMware Morrison look I\n\n327\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:08.750\ncan manage this a lot better than\nyou can if it's dynamic here.\n\n328\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.710\nWe also have to worry\nabout the host machine and\n\n329\n00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.050\nwe also want to make sure that we are de\nfragmenting on the host machine as well.\n\n330\n00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.870\nSo make sure you also run\nthat defragmenter too\n\n331\n00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:21.160\nbecause all that goes into performance.\n\n332\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.780\nIt goes into being able to actually\nsave the space that we need to and\n\n333\n00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:30.300\nit's very important when we start taking\na look at whether we need to compact or\n\n334\n00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.090\nexpand, but we definitely need a specially\nproduction environment if we're gonna be\n\n335\n00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.790\nrelying on these machines.\n\n336\n00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:41.140\nTo do that type of regular maintenance for\nthose VMs as well.\n\n337\n00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.490\nThe other things that we also\nwant to point out, of course,\n\n338\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.170\nare some of the other management features\nthat we'll also see inside of VMware.\n\n339\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:53.640\nBut really managing those VHD is actually\nvery important for us and a lot of times\n\n340\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.970\nif you are actually that manager, some of\nthe things that I kinda skip over because,\n\n341\n00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.970\nI really don't think about them that way,\ncuz I'm constantly making them, and\n\n342\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.340\nthen getting rid of them, cuz we're doing\nmultiple shows and what we're doing that.\n\n343\n00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.140\nBut in a production environment, one of\nthe most important things that you can do,\n\n344\n00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.600\nfor managing, is just making sure\nyou know a couple of things, right?\n\n345\n00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.970\nWhere in the world these\nfiles are gonna be located?\n\n346\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.840\nI guarantee you that's going\nto be one of the things that\n\n347\n00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.560\nhaunts you at the beginning and then,\nof course, a proper naming convention.\n\n348\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.110\nSo that you're not actually constantly\nnaming them the same thing and\n\n349\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.330\nthen every single VM that you create and\n\n350\n00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.140\nyou're wondering, did this actually come\noff of this VM or this one over here?\n\n351\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.500\nMake you get a good, descriptive filename.\n\n352\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.760\nThat's part of the management stuff that\nwe have to be able to actually understand\n\n353\n00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.090\nand do and we also wanna look at\nthe utilities that are built in here to\n\n354\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.850\nhelp us to manage the virtual machines.\n\n355\n00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:46.163\n>> One of the things that I have noticed\nthere Ronnie is working in a clustered.\n\n356\n00:18:46.163 --> 00:18:49.940\nVirtualized environment [LAUGH]\nit probably shouldn't have been\n\n357\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.710\ndone this way but\nthe virtual machines were actually stored,\n\n358\n00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:57.230\nthe hard drives were stored on\na different, I think it was a SAN, and\n\n359\n00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.280\nthey lost network connectivity between\nthe cluster with the virtual machines.\n\n360\n00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.395\nThe hardware itself was what was being\nhosted versus where the drives themselves\n\n361\n00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:09.755\nwere being hosted and I can tell you,\nonce you lose that network connectivity,\n\n362\n00:19:09.755 --> 00:19:11.915\nit doesn't matter what virtual machines\nyou're gonna have in that cluster,\n\n363\n00:19:11.915 --> 00:19:15.625\ndoesn't matter what fault tolerance,\nredundancy, performance consideration,\n\n364\n00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:17.825\nthe whole entire cluster goes down and\nnow,\n\n365\n00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:20.965\nif you're in production environment,\nyour production environment goes down too.\n\n366\n00:19:20.965 --> 00:19:23.915\n>> It really can, so just knowing about\nsome of this management features.\n\n367\n00:19:23.915 --> 00:19:25.750\nThis is why it's good for you, right?\n\n368\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.610\nEven with these type two hypervisors at\nthe very beginning, getting to know them\n\n369\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.600\nis gonna help you out as we move into some\nof the type one hypervisors that may be\n\n370\n00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.930\na little bit more technically challenging,\nespecially about what we're talking about.\n\n371\n00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.930\nCuz that's where we'll tend\nto manage them more often.\n\n372\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.000\nBut at least understanding it here\nin this environment is gonna help.\n\n373\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.140\nSo let's take a look at some of\nthose management features that I was\n\n374\n00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.700\ntalking about here.\n\n375\n00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.420\nSo, in the background, right,\nwe're talking about managing VMs.\n\n376\n00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:53.040\nWe're not talking about managing the\nWindows 8 work station here that I have,\n\n377\n00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.980\nbut the actual entire VMs themselves and\nover here on the left hand side\n\n378\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.090\nis a navigation pane that we tend to have,\nor what we they call their library.\n\n379\n00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.300\nThe ability to be able to see what\nvirtual machines are actually running on\n\n380\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.530\nmy machine is actually gonna be key.\n\n381\n00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.200\nSo they give us this feature over here.\n\n382\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:13.040\nAlso, inside of VM workstation I can\naccess also what we call shared VMs, too.\n\n383\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.210\nWhich means from a remote host I\ncan access them right here and\n\n384\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:17.850\nbe able to manage them as well.\n\n385\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:22.140\nIf I click on this home tab you see\nthose different ways of connecting.\n\n386\n00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.200\nI'm either going to create a new one or\nI'm going to open one up that's actually\n\n387\n00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.610\nexisting on my machine and it may\nhave actually been out of my library.\n\n388\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.430\nNotice here I can connect\nto a remote server,\n\n389\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.190\none that's actually\nrunning somewhere else.\n\n390\n00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.910\nWe're inside of VMware's work cloud\nthat they have available to us\n\n391\n00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.130\nthat we can run VMs from there.\n\n392\n00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.500\nSo the management itself,\n\n393\n00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.900\nit has a great little management console\nthat you need to be aware of too.\n\n394\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.490\nAnd so just by following the instructions\nafter this will get you connected in and\n\n395\n00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.870\nyou'll actually start seeing more and\nmore features appear over here.\n\n396\n00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.930\nNow one of the other things that we didn't\ntake a look at at the beginning were what\n\n397\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.760\nwe called preferences.\n\n398\n00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.640\nIf I click on Edit, excuse me.\n\n399\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.270\nI always think it's View.\n\n400\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:07.370\nEdit and then underneath where\nit says virtual network editor,\n\n401\n00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.730\nI can select these preferences.\n\n402\n00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.310\nIn the preferences remember what I was\ntelling you, that you need to actually\n\n403\n00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:18.460\nknow where your location for\nyour virtual machines are going to be.\n\n404\n00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.700\nNow by default it shows you,\n\n405\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.460\nthat when it first installs here's\nthe location it's going to choose.\n\n406\n00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:30.290\nIf you do not want it right here, you\nsimply browse to the directory you want to\n\n407\n00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.180\nput it in and then you select it and\nthen you click OK.\n\n408\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.320\nAnd it's from here that you can\neither create subdirectories for each\n\n409\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.930\none of your virtual machines if you want\nto, or dump them all in this one location.\n\n410\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.070\nIt all just depends on you.\n\n411\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.070\nThe whole idea behind this\nis to not make it harder.\n\n412\n00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.680\nBut it's to make it easier for you if\nyou are now gonna move virtual machines.\n\n413\n00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.900\nSo I know that I like keeping all of\nmine inside of a folder called VMs, and\n\n414\n00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.510\nbecause I like it tied to my profile,\n\n415\n00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.580\nI know that that normally means I simply\nhave to go to documents and there it is.\n\n416\n00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.770\nThere's my folder of VMs, and all\nthe VMs I created and all of the actual\n\n417\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.530\nrelevant information normally is\ngoing to be stuck right here now.\n\n418\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:19.870\nThis one's a bit messy I didn't\nactually bother to create subfolders.\n\n419\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.410\nI don't know why I came up with\nthat word but I sure as heck did.\n\n420\n00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.780\n>> Okay, we'll make our own contributions\nto the English language around here that's\n\n421\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.500\nperfectly fine.\n\n422\n00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.200\nI do it all of the time.\n\n423\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.510\n>> So here I just dumped\nthem all in this folder and\n\n424\n00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:35.260\nyou're actually starting to see,\nhere's the actual VMware machines and\n\n425\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.230\nall the files that are actually\nassociated with some of these and\n\n426\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.850\nthen some of them I did create\nsubfolders in, and so that way,\n\n427\n00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.030\nif I wanted to move everything, I know\nexactly where my VMs are going to be.\n\n428\n00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.120\nI even have some right here\nthat's actually in the default.\n\n429\n00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.530\nA location that it gave me at\nthe beginning, because I wasn't paying so\n\n430\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.680\nmuch attention.\n\n431\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.910\nWell, that can become bothersome, right?\n\n432\n00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.350\nAs now, I go look,\nI'm gonna get a new machine.\n\n433\n00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.360\nLet's say that we decide to upgrade\nour machines here, and now,\n\n434\n00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.360\nall of the sudden, I need to move\nall those VMs to my new machine.\n\n435\n00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.500\nWell, if I grab that VM folder,\nthat's perfectly fine, but\n\n436\n00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.240\nwhat about those that were\nactually in the default location?\n\n437\n00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.380\nSo you also want to make sure that you\ncheck that out too when you start talking\n\n438\n00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.720\nabout the workspace of\ncourse the input as well.\n\n439\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.310\nNotice that you can control the mouse and\nthe keyboard, as well as the cursor and\n\n440\n00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.690\nwhat happens to it.\n\n441\n00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.480\nSo these are things that if you're\nexperiencing kind of some squirrely\n\n442\n00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.920\nbehavior that you're unsure of and\nyou try one thing and go,\n\n443\n00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.540\nI don't know if that really works.\n\n444\n00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.480\nCheck out some of the things\nlike the imput here.\n\n445\n00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.450\nWhere it says grab keyboard and\nmouse and then put on the mouse click.\n\n446\n00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:38.170\nSo what does that mean?\n\n447\n00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.580\nThat means when, I click inside\nthe VM my keyboard and my mouse, and\n\n448\n00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.480\ninput are now gonna be\nfocused right there, or\n\n449\n00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.240\nit says I can have the same things\nhappen when I press key instead.\n\n450\n00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.992\nSo, I can actually go ahead and say look,\nwhen I press the control key that's gonna\n\n451\n00:23:52.992 --> 00:23:56.530\nswitch the focus and now my keyboard and\nmy mouse are gonna be in there as well and\n\n452\n00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.180\nyou can also do some other\nthing's here with your cursor.\n\n453\n00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.251\nIf you want a change the default\nkind of control keys that you have.\n\n454\n00:24:03.251 --> 00:24:08.360\nYou have the ability to also be able\nto create your own hotkeys, as well.\n\n455\n00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.150\nSo, a lot of times,\n\n456\n00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:12.770\nour Ctrl+Alt is actually what releases\nme from that virtual machine.\n\n457\n00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:18.520\nIf I don't have the VMWare tools installed\non there, that will also end up helping.\n\n458\n00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.640\nBut, I can also create my own\ncombination of keys if I want to.\n\n459\n00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:26.120\nI just need to be careful when I do so,\nso I'm not overriding some other one.\n\n460\n00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.290\nOr actually, not overriding,\n\n461\n00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:32.410\nbut replacing something I didn't mean\nto replace is what I should say.\n\n462\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.530\nAlso on the displays this is\nactually very important as well,\n\n463\n00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.920\ndepending on what you need to see.\n\n464\n00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:44.420\nSo everything that we're doing right now\nin our VM, access to our VMs, right?\n\n465\n00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.900\nIt's a little small tiny window and I left\nit there on purpose because the focus is\n\n466\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.300\nnot on making them look the best possible.\n\n467\n00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.640\nThose are things you can do on your own,\nbut\n\n468\n00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.790\nthis is actually to let you know there\nare plenty of different options.\n\n469\n00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.540\nI can actually have it auto fit so\nit automatically says\n\n470\n00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.520\nhey I'm gonna take a look at\nthe resolution that's on your screen and\n\n471\n00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.370\ninside the VM I can match it up.\n\n472\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:07.320\nNow that normally only works when you\nhave those VMware tools installed.\n\n473\n00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.690\nBut just kind of realize that too.\n\n474\n00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.750\nOther things can also happen\nas the autofit guessed.\n\n475\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.850\nSame thing here that we want to fit\ninto a window size or we actually want\n\n476\n00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:22.130\nto expand out to what the guest VM can\nactually maximize to in the extension.\n\n477\n00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.390\nFull screening, how do I want this to go?\n\n478\n00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.970\nThere are plenty of options\nthat are available.\n\n479\n00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.780\nOne of the neat things inside of\nVMWare that really is something that\n\n480\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.890\ndoesn't really seem like a great big deal\n\n481\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.400\nwhen you're on a Windows machine but\nit can be when you're actually on a Mac.\n\n482\n00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.710\nThis is something I do to\nkind of fool Mike here,\n\n483\n00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.260\nthere's something we call Unity.\n\n484\n00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.710\nNow what the heck is Unity?\n\n485\n00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:51.280\nIt's a display mode that allows\nme to run on a MacBook, but\n\n486\n00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.270\nI can run Internet Explorer on a MacBook,\nWes.\n\n487\n00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.490\nI literally can and I actually opened\nup a window and I showed Mike here.\n\n488\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.820\nI was like, look, Internet Explorer\nruns perfectly on a MacBook Pro and\n\n489\n00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.270\nhe was kinda surprised.\n\n490\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.350\nI showed him how I could open up a Windows\nControl Panel inside of a Macbook,\n\n491\n00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.570\nnow what is that about?\n\n492\n00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:09.480\nIt's this Unity mode.\n\n493\n00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.900\nIt allows me to create a little window,\nactually just for\n\n494\n00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.580\na particular application.\n\n495\n00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.910\nAnd then I can actually\nrun that one application\n\n496\n00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.000\ninside of my host on my Macbook.\n\n497\n00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.580\nNow you may be wondering why\nis that important inside of\n\n498\n00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.610\na Windows machine then?\n\n499\n00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.720\nWhy would they actually include\nthis in VMware Workstation,\n\n500\n00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.520\nwhich obviously works with Windows and\nLinux.\n\n501\n00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.970\nBut on a Linux machine I can still\nrun a Windows program on it.\n\n502\n00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.130\nBut what it's doing, it's actually\nfeeding through the VM that's on\n\n503\n00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.330\nin the background instead and doing that.\n\n504\n00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.030\nSo it's kind of a joke.\n\n505\n00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:45.500\nNot a joke,\na lie to what you're actually running on.\n\n506\n00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.080\nSo even though you think you're\nrunning natively inside of Linux or\n\n507\n00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.940\ninside of Windows, You may actually be\nrunning inside of another addition.\n\n508\n00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.830\nAnd we had something like this natively\ninside of Microsoft before that we\n\n509\n00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:59.140\ncalled like the Windows XP mode, it can\ndo something fairly similar for us here.\n\n510\n00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:02.080\n>> I could see where that could come in\nhandy because we've been talking about\n\n511\n00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.050\nsome of the purposes of\nusing virtualization and\n\n512\n00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.950\nwhy it would even setup one of\nthese machines in the beginning.\n\n513\n00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.750\nIt might just be to test out\na specific piece of software.\n\n514\n00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.510\nMaybe I'm just testing a software that\nmaybe doesn't run on Mac at this point.\n\n515\n00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:18.350\nMaybe they're testing further development\nfor Mac but we know it runs on Windows and\n\n516\n00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.660\nI have to see how it runs on Windows.\n\n517\n00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.030\nWouldn't it be nice to just take the\nvirtual machine experience if that's not\n\n518\n00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.000\nwhat your really focused on and\nnot just really wiping out but\n\n519\n00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.570\njust making it transparent to yourself and\njust show the application natively in\n\n520\n00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:33.710\nthe environment in the computer in this\ncase Mac, that your used to working on.\n\n521\n00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.890\nSo I can see where you would get\na lot of benefit out of that.\n\n522\n00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.630\n>> There's no doubt that there's plenty\nof thing's that we can do there with it.\n\n523\n00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.630\nNow we also have updates, of course.\n\n524\n00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.320\nSo remember that even though\nVMware Workstation Pro 11, right,\n\n525\n00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.460\nis actually on this particular version,\n\n526\n00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.940\nyou always want to make sure that\nyou check for updates as well.\n\n527\n00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.770\nSo make sure you do that.\n\n528\n00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.000\nAnd that's right here in these\npreferences too, as well.\n\n529\n00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.110\nAnd then, of course you have\nsome of these other options.\n\n530\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.570\nNow most of these other ones I\nreally haven't actually used before.\n\n531\n00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:00.410\n>> And don't get me wrong,\n\n532\n00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.080\nthey may actually be something\nyou wanna choose here.\n\n533\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.260\nBut they're really not gonna affect\nthe overall nature of managing the VMs,\n\n534\n00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.790\nthey're all just about exactly\nlike it says, preferences here.\n\n535\n00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.730\nNow, there is one other feature that\nI wanted to make sure that I got\n\n536\n00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.810\nto before the end of our time here.\n\n537\n00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:21.120\nSo, let me launch up this, actually,\nbefore I launch up this a virtual machine\n\n538\n00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.480\nis the idea of what we call shared folder,\nright?\n\n539\n00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.360\nSo, here enough,\nI'm running on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n540\n00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.620\nAnd if I wanted to install an application\ninto my VM, I have a couple of options.\n\n541\n00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.230\nI can open up my VM,\n\n542\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.770\ngo out to the Internet,\ndownload the application if I want to.\n\n543\n00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:38.860\nBut what if I've already downloaded it and\nit's on my Windows 10 machine instead and\n\n544\n00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.170\nI need to install it?\n\n545\n00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:45.580\nWell, I need a way to be able to transfer\na file from my Windows 10 host machine\n\n546\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.650\ninto my guest VM.\n\n547\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.390\nI could probably create that bridge\nnetwork connection if I wanted to.\n\n548\n00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.200\nCreate a shared folder and do that.\n\n549\n00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.150\nOr, I can use a tool that's\nnatively built into VMWare and\n\n550\n00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.550\nthat's the one that we\nwant to get access to.\n\n551\n00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:04.550\nSo if I let's see right click on that\nWindows 8 machine and go down to settings.\n\n552\n00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.980\nAnd then inside of settings this is where\nit gets tricky cause I'm looking for\n\n553\n00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.150\nit right here on this hardware tab.\n\n554\n00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.860\nBut I would need to select the options\ntag and you'll see that there are several\n\n555\n00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.340\nother options that are available to us,\nincluding managing power.\n\n556\n00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.020\nAnd you do wanna take a look at\nsome of these other ones here, and\n\n557\n00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.510\nyou'll see that some of these also\nwere inside of that Preference tab.\n\n558\n00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.350\nSnapshots, Auto Protect as well.\n\n559\n00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.840\nAnd there it is,\nthe one that's called Shared Folders.\n\n560\n00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.440\nIt's currently disabled.\n\n561\n00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.170\nI can select where it says\nalways enabled here, or\n\n562\n00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.550\nenable until the next power suspend.\n\n563\n00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:43.550\nAnd at this point I can go ahead and click\nadd and then run through this wizard.\n\n564\n00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.740\nAnd it's gonna actually take a look on\nmy host path and ask me what I want.\n\n565\n00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:52.040\nI'm gonna select that lab-Itprotv\nhere on that machine.\n\n566\n00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.841\nLet me make sure I'm actually\ntelling you right, yeah, that one.\n\n567\n00:29:58.627 --> 00:30:01.280\nAnd give it that name, click Next.\n\n568\n00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.638\nAnd I'm gonna enable this share,\nI'm not gonna mark it as read-only, and\n\n569\n00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:06.535\nclick Finish.\n\n570\n00:30:06.535 --> 00:30:11.134\nFrom that point, I don't wanna map it as\na drive, sure, let's map it as a drive,\n\n571\n00:30:11.134 --> 00:30:12.060\nwhy not?\n\n572\n00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.810\nThat makes it easy.\n\n573\n00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.400\nAnd then I will power on\nthis virtual machine and\n\n574\n00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.010\nwhat that will do is give me the ability\nto create a folder on my host machine and\n\n575\n00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.540\nthen from my host machine, I can just\ndrop things into that folder and\n\n576\n00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.680\nthey'll be accessible\ninside of my guest vm.\n\n577\n00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.360\nNow, you do have to be\ncareful here though, right.\n\n578\n00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.100\nFor example, I run a MacBook Pro.\n\n579\n00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.650\nWell, remember files that\nare actually designed for\n\n580\n00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.910\nthis Windows machine, those are the only\nones that you're really gonna be able to\n\n581\n00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:43.300\nuse in that Windows machine so don't think\nthat you can take a Mac application and\n\n582\n00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.170\nbe able to install them inside a Windows.\n\n583\n00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.030\nBut that's what you can\nalso do right here.\n\n584\n00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.330\nSo we're getting ready to take and\n\n585\n00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.140\nlook at this more inside of\nVirtualBox where we got it to run.\n\n586\n00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.740\nThis one's actually taking a little\nbit of time to start up here.\n\n587\n00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.270\nBut overall, though, when I log in\nI should be able to end up seeing.\n\n588\n00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.370\nThe installation doesn't look like it's\ngonna take too much time from there.\n\n589\n00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.780\nNow while we're actually\ntalking about this and\n\n590\n00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.670\nwe're getting close to the end of our\nsegment here, we do want to actually kinda\n\n591\n00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.360\nput a bow on the top of everything and\nthen we'll show you this last thing.\n\n592\n00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.440\nRemember that security is of utmost\nimportance at this point too.\n\n593\n00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.270\nWhen you're running virtual machines,\nyou cannot treat them as a toy.\n\n594\n00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.690\nThey need to essentially be treated\nlike another physical machine.\n\n595\n00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:25.590\nSo if you're running 10 or 15 of these,\nyou need to treat each one as if they're\n\n596\n00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.950\nactually a virtual machine and there's\nseveral things we wanna talk about.\n\n597\n00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:29.816\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n598\n00:31:29.816 --> 00:31:34.060\nI figure one of the things you might think\nof is, hey this is a virtual hard disk.\n\n599\n00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.720\nThis is a virtual machine that\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n600\n00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.320\nit really is nothing more than a file and\njust like any other file,\n\n601\n00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.520\nany other folder that we would have,\nyou have to govern it, right?\n\n602\n00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.530\nWe have to have some kind of access\ncontrol that says just not anybody\n\n603\n00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.040\ncan access that file or folder.\n\n604\n00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.219\nAnd I'm sure, Ronnie, just like any other\noperating system we're gonna have to apply\n\n605\n00:31:55.219 --> 00:31:59.286\nupdates too, cause I'm sure that there's\ngonna be some kind of Security exploits,\n\n606\n00:31:59.286 --> 00:32:01.622\nsecurity vulnerabilities,\nbugs in software.\n\n607\n00:32:01.622 --> 00:32:04.594\nIt's not a matter of if there are bugs\nin software, it's just a matter of when\n\n608\n00:32:04.594 --> 00:32:07.385\nthey're found and when' they are found\nI'm sure that we are gonna wanna\n\n609\n00:32:07.385 --> 00:32:10.820\nclose any kind of loophole there that\nmight lead to some kind of exploitation.\n\n610\n00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.960\n>> We also want to make sure that we're\nvery careful when we create virtual\n\n611\n00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.800\nmachines and\nwho can gain access to them, right.\n\n612\n00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.920\nWe would make sure that we do what we\ncall the principle least privilege here.\n\n613\n00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.720\nSo we don't wanna just\ngive everybody access,\n\n614\n00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.420\nwe wanna be able to limit that access.\n\n615\n00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.320\nSome of that time of limiting the access\nmay just be that we put the virtual\n\n616\n00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.790\nmachine behind our own network adapter\nto where it's not actually available on\n\n617\n00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:37.010\nthe physical network that we're on\nat least from just browsing to it.\n\n618\n00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.800\nOther times it may be controlling\naccess by not actually\n\n619\n00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.210\nallowing somebody to log in, or\nto do remote desktop into that machine\n\n620\n00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.310\nif they're not actually\nsupposed to be there as well.\n\n621\n00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.440\nRemember to always think about\nthe idea of updating, and\n\n622\n00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.940\nof course, anti-virus solutions, too.\n\n623\n00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.950\nIf they can actually run on\nthe host machine for anti virus and\n\n624\n00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.590\nupdates out there,\nyou also need to do it here too.\n\n625\n00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.520\nAnd remember to always protect\nthat host machine as well,\n\n626\n00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.340\nbecause that's actually very important for\neverything that we do.\n\n627\n00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.200\nIf we get compromised in one\nvirtual machine, it's bad enough,\n\n628\n00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.660\nbecause it is that virtual machine,\nand whatever data's there is lost.\n\n629\n00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.825\nBut, remember, if we get compromised on\nour host machine that we're running, well,\n\n630\n00:33:14.825 --> 00:33:17.150\nthey'll have access to every\nvirtual machine that we have.\n\n631\n00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.490\nAnd that's something we don't want to do,\nas well.\n\n632\n00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:21.650\nSo, just thinking about\nthe idea of security,\n\n633\n00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:24.220\nin terms of virtual machines\nis very important, okay?\n\n634\n00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.360\nAll right, now, my machine is\nfinally logged in, and everything.\n\n635\n00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.850\nSo let's go ahead and take a look and\nsee if we can do these shared folders, and\n\n636\n00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:35.060\nthen we'll have a great show here, right.\n\n637\n00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.893\nSo here it is,\nI'm logged into my Windows 8 machine,\n\n638\n00:33:37.893 --> 00:33:39.938\nI'm gonna click on the file explorer.\n\n639\n00:33:39.938 --> 00:33:44.780\nAnd there it goes, it automatically\nnow shows up as a shared folder here.\n\n640\n00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:50.010\nSo it says Vmware-host and if I double\nclick in there and go in my lab.itprotv,\n\n641\n00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:54.425\nhere are some of the files that I actually\nhad shared out in that folder all ready.\n\n642\n00:33:54.425 --> 00:33:56.450\nSo now if I go to my host machine,\n\n643\n00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.380\nlet me see if I can do this\nrelatively quickly here.\n\n644\n00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.710\nThere it is, my host, sorry.\n\n645\n00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:07.430\nLet me click on that host machine and\nthen I try and\n\n646\n00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:12.130\nfind that folder here.\n\n647\n00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.680\nLet me see if I can find that folder.\n\n648\n00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.140\nWell, give me a second.\n\n649\n00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.400\nI'm gonna try to find it here.\n\n650\n00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.980\nAnd where did I put that folder?\n\n651\n00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.940\nDid I put it in here?\n\n652\n00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.050\nThere it is, Lab.itprotv.\n\n653\n00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.520\nSo this one is actually\non my host machine.\n\n654\n00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.730\nIf I right click,\nI create a new bit map image here.\n\n655\n00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.540\nAnd we'll say, this is Wesley.\n\n656\n00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.310\nAll right, so let's say that that\nactually is a pretend picture of Wes.\n\n657\n00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:43.510\nIn a moment if I kind of refresh\nthis thing here, there we go.\n\n658\n00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:47.130\nIt's now also available\ninside of my VMware too.\n\n659\n00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.670\nThat's not too difficult of a thing to do,\nbut it is actually something that makes\n\n660\n00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:54.910\nmanaging your VMs much easier, especially\nif you and I know that I've had to do\n\n661\n00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:59.360\nthis, is actually built to add in a print\ndriver to all of my virtual machines.\n\n662\n00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.230\nInstead of me going to every\nsingle virtual machine and\n\n663\n00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.810\ngoing out to the website and downloading\nit, I just simply downloaded it once and\n\n664\n00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.710\nput it inside of a shared folder,\nevery single machine had a shared folder,\n\n665\n00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.290\nI was now able to click and drag and\n\n666\n00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.610\ninstall that in those virtual machines so\nthat they could actually do printing.\n\n667\n00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:15.040\nIt really does help.\n\n668\n00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.100\nSo managing VMs just as important as\neverything else that we've done but\n\n669\n00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.740\nreally kinda some of the features\nthat we tend to forget about so\n\n670\n00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.440\nit's good that we actually\nreview them here.\n\n671\n00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.930\n>> Yeah.\nGood, great information Ronnie.\n\n672\n00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:29.630\nSo we've talked a lot of managing your\nVMs inside the VMWare work station.\n\n673\n00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.390\nKeep in mind that one of\nthe most important parts,\n\n674\n00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.520\ncomponents within your virtual\nmachines are the Virtual disks.\n\n675\n00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.510\nRemember the virtual disks,\njust like any other physical drive,\n\n676\n00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.010\nthey have to be managed to maintain.\n\n677\n00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:44.280\nSo we've looked at things like\ncompacting the disk, defragmentation.\n\n678\n00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.240\nWe've looked at some of the preferences\nthat you can set after you've already got\n\n679\n00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.820\nthe virtual machine created.\n\n680\n00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.570\nWe've also looked at how you can share\nfiles between the host machine and\n\n681\n00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.400\nthe guest machine as well.\n\n682\n00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.350\nAnd last but not least, we've also\ntalked about some of the security.\n\n683\n00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.440\nSo remember, make sure that\nyou have any virus software.\n\n684\n00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.540\nMake sure that if the software\nthat the hypervisor is using,\n\n685\n00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.880\nmake sure that software's\nup to date as well.\n\n686\n00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.840\nRonnie, any other information for\nus on this one?\n\n687\n00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.800\n>> Well, not with VMware Workstation,\nbut just kind of realize\n\n688\n00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.145\nthat if you've already been following\nalong in our previous episodes, right?\n\n689\n00:36:15.145 --> 00:36:17.270\nYou're not really seeing\nvery much of a difference.\n\n690\n00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.400\nYou are seeing differences in products and\n\n691\n00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.420\nfor VMware work stations it's one\nof the best that's out there.\n\n692\n00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.250\nPeople trust it like crazy and\nit is worth the value and\n\n693\n00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:28.350\nthe money that you put behind it,\nbecause this is a product that will\n\n694\n00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.040\ncontinue to support you\nway into the future.\n\n695\n00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.860\nEven though all the products we're looking\nat, by far the most popular products,\n\n696\n00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.540\nyou're going to pick one.\n\n697\n00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.785\nYou're probably going to stick with that\n\n698\n00:36:35.785 --> 00:36:37.931\none cause that's the one you're\ngoing to feel most comfortable with.\n\n699\n00:36:37.931 --> 00:36:40.781\nThe VMware workstation should\nbe something that you as an IT\n\n700\n00:36:40.781 --> 00:36:43.850\nprofessional should feel right\nat home being able to use.\n\n701\n00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:44.920\n>> Ronnie, thank you very much.\n\n702\n00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.650\nIt looks like we have come to\nthe end of another episode.\n\n703\n00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:50.680\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nsign off here at itpro.tv and\n\n704\n00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.880\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n705\n00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.988\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n706\n00:36:53.988 --> 00:37:00.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:17.150\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan and\nin this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.750\nwe're gonna be continuing\nalong in virtualization.\n\n6\n00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.770\nAnd what we're gonna be looking at today\nis none other than Microsoft's Hyper-V.\n\n7\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.130\nAnd we're gonna show how\nto do the installation of\n\n8\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.320\nthe Hyper-V role that you can\nfind inside of Server 2012, and\n\n9\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.130\nwe have Ronnie Wong on hand\nto help us out with that.\n\n10\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.030\nRonnie, how you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.460\n>> I'm doing fine.\n\n12\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.310\nAs we take a look at Microsoft Hyper-V\nwhat we're actually taking a look at now\n\n13\n00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.120\nis what we call a Type-1 hypervisor.\n\n14\n00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.370\nAnd I wanna make sure that we\nunderstand the difference between them.\n\n15\n00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.800\nIf you don't go back and take a look\nat our previously recorded episodes\n\n16\n00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.770\nas we discuss the basics or the\ngeneralizations of virtualization here.\n\n17\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.630\nBut I have a diagram to help us to make\nsure that we make the distinction and\n\n18\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.548\nthat's what we wanna\ntake a look at right now.\n\n19\n00:00:57.548 --> 00:01:01.950\nSo on my machine, let's take a look\nhere and maybe this will help us to\n\n20\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.720\nremind ourselves of some of the concepts\nwe have covered in a previous episode.\n\n21\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.770\nRemember that when we talk about\nthe differences between virtualization\n\n22\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.260\ntechnologies, there's really\ntwo major varieties for us.\n\n23\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.330\nAnd one is what we'll\ncall a Type-1 hypervisor,\n\n24\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.300\none is what we'll call\na Type-2 hypervisor as well.\n\n25\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.691\nSo when you look at things\nlike Oracle's VirtualBox or\n\n26\n00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:25.380\nVMware Workstation whether it's 11 or\n12 or whatever version that you have.\n\n27\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.670\nThose are examples of what\nwe call Type-2 hypervisors.\n\n28\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.520\nAs well you may hear about\nthings like VMWare fusion, or\n\n29\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.690\neven parallels on the Mac computer.\n\n30\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.490\nThat will allow you to be\na Type-2 hypervisor as well.\n\n31\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.660\nThat distinguishing characteristic\nof a Type-2 hypervisor\n\n32\n00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.170\nwould actually be what we call\nthis OS here, this host OS.\n\n33\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.180\nSo remember that when you and\nI actually go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.400\nwe run a regular machine that\nwe use each and every day.\n\n35\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.920\nWell we go ahead and normally we have our\nhard ware, we install an operating system,\n\n36\n00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.620\nthen we normally install\napplications on top of that.\n\n37\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.470\nWith those applications running\nthat's perfectly fine because\n\n38\n00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.190\nthat's what it's designed to do.\n\n39\n00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.280\nWell we can then go out and\nget whatever hypervisor that we want to.\n\n40\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.030\nWhether it's Oracle's VirtualBox or like\nI said, VMware Workstation or whatever it\n\n41\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.050\nmight be, and we install it as a regular\napplication in that operating system.\n\n42\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.850\nFrom there, we can create and build our\nown virtual machines on top of that, and\n\n43\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.830\nthat can actually be any operating system\nthen that runs its own applications.\n\n44\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.440\nSo whether it's Linux or Windows here,\n\n45\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.370\nwe can actually build on top\nof that if we choose to.\n\n46\n00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.360\nSo that is what we've talk\nabout in a Type-2 hypervisor.\n\n47\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.840\n>> Now Ron, it looks like the Type-2\nhypervisor's adding you know more layers\n\n48\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.690\nof abstraction.\n\n49\n00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.170\nAnd I can only guess and assume and\nhopefully the assumption's right, that if\n\n50\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.620\nyou add more layers of abstraction,\nif I can say that word right [LAUGH],\n\n51\n00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.290\nthat you could see a potential for\nmaybe a performance degradation.\n\n52\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.460\nAnd so it looks like this would be\nsomething that maybe you would use\n\n53\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.620\nmore as in testing rather than\nin production environment.\n\n54\n00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.110\n>> You generally end up seeing\nthat to be true more often.\n\n55\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.950\nThe reason why you end up getting some\nperformance hits is fairly simple.\n\n56\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.870\nRemember that you're actually having\nto split some resources, right?\n\n57\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.050\nThe underlying operating system has to\nhave its set of resources that it can use\n\n58\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.170\nto continue to do the things that's\ndemanded of it to do on the machine as\n\n59\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.200\nwell, and then your VMs also\nhave their resources too.\n\n60\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.770\nOn top of that the abstraction that Wes\nis talking about, is the two layers of\n\n61\n00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.900\nsoftware that we have to go through\nbetween the virtual machine and of course,\n\n62\n00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.970\nthe hardware.\n\n63\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.560\nSo if we need to send instructions\nlets say, for example,\n\n64\n00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.430\nfrom the Windows OS right here, well\nfirst it actually has to translate into\n\n65\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.810\nthe language that that Type-2\nhypervisor actually translates it into.\n\n66\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.230\nAnd then from that point that has to be\npassed down into the operating system.\n\n67\n00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.690\nThen the operating system passes\nthat down into the hardware as well.\n\n68\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.460\nAnd now when instructions come\nback it has to do the same thing.\n\n69\n00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.910\nIt comes back from the hardware.\n\n70\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.510\nHas to change it into whatever\nthe operating system knows.\n\n71\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.270\nThe operating system then has to change\nit into whatever Oracle's VirtualBox here\n\n72\n00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.370\nknows and then it can pass it back on\nthrough to our Type-2 hypervisors.\n\n73\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.440\nNow they've made some very\ngood advances in Type-2\n\n74\n00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.150\nhypervisors that really do reduce\nthis translation down, and\n\n75\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.920\nthis is when we use what we call\nhardware-assisted virtualization.\n\n76\n00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.510\nThat allows for that underlying\nlayer of this Oracle VirtualBox,\n\n77\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.570\nthe pink layer here,\nto be able to map addresses or\n\n78\n00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.720\nmap whatever it is directly\nto the underlying hardware.\n\n79\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.380\nAnd that means it doesn't have to\nchange it into one language and\n\n80\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.850\nthen change it into another one.\n\n81\n00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.910\nIt says, if the hardware says, here's what\nthe addresses are that we need to get to,\n\n82\n00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.862\nwell then inside of that\nOracle VirtualBox layer,\n\n83\n00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:43.110\nit says, I would just mimic that up here.\n\n84\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.330\nSo that when the Widows OS says, I need it\nright here, it doesn't have to actually\n\n85\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.705\ntranslate it into what they\nactual real hardware's saying.\n\n86\n00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:53.710\nIt's ready right there in\nthe VirtualBox essentially now\n\n87\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.690\nsending it directly along without any\nchanges and makes it much more efficient.\n\n88\n00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.230\nBut still where we tend to see this\nmore often is that we rely on this and\n\n89\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.260\nthat testing environment.\n\n90\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.960\n>> So this is an application, Ronnie,\n\n91\n00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.770\nthat is running pretty much like some\nof the other applications side by side.\n\n92\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.670\nSo even though we do have a hypervisor\nmanaging resources in between the virtual\n\n93\n00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.430\nmachines and\nthe hardware on that platform.\n\n94\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.620\nIt seems like an application,\n\n95\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.320\nmaybe another application that might\nbe running side by side is also gonna\n\n96\n00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.000\nbe in contention with the resources\nthat's on that machine.\n\n97\n00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.740\nAnd that's where the Type 1\nhypervisor comes in, right, and\n\n98\n00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.080\nyou're gonna help us out with that.\n\n99\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.203\n>> Right, so when we take a look at\nthe idea of the Type 1 hypervisor,\n\n100\n00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:36.510\nnotice as I pull them a little bit closer,\nyou can see that there's clearly a layer\n\n101\n00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.780\nmissing right, which is gonna be\nthe underline host operating system.\n\n102\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.870\nAnd what does means, is that directly\non top of the physical hardware,\n\n103\n00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.148\nwe instead can install this\nvirtualization layer instead.\n\n104\n00:05:50.148 --> 00:05:53.890\nNow, Microsoft's Hyper-V,\nthe one that we're really getting into,\n\n105\n00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.530\nwe'll talk about this a little\nbit more in detail, but\n\n106\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.290\nthis also has a special\nway of doing this too.\n\n107\n00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.910\nSo, not only do you have these guest VN's\nhere that we normally see represented this\n\n108\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.050\nway, but even when you actually start\noff as a Type 2 kind of install,\n\n109\n00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.690\nand that's what normally happens,\n\n110\n00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.910\nit actually has the ability to change\nthis into a Type 1 hypervisor,.\n\n111\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.720\nSo Microsoft Hyper-V is actually\na Type 1 hypervisor, but\n\n112\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.510\neven though it actually begins as\na Type 1 way of doing the install.\n\n113\n00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.310\nSo it's a very unusual\nway of doing things, but\n\n114\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.620\nit's actually something that's designed to\nhelp you as whether you're actually brand\n\n115\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.040\nnew to virtualization or whether\nyou're an experienced administrator,\n\n116\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.840\nto not have to really\nchange up a lot of stuff.\n\n117\n00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.720\nIn other words, as you're upgrading\nto your newer operating system or\n\n118\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.800\nyou're actually installing Windows Server\n2012, you can install it as normal and\n\n119\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.490\nthe nice thing is that this hypervisor\nthen installs as a role that you and\n\n120\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.360\nI would normally just see.\n\n121\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.410\nSo it is different by comparison,\nif you take a look\n\n122\n00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:07.300\nsuch as VMare's ESXi, and you take a look\nat that comparison, what you'll see there\n\n123\n00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.220\nis that we directly install a hypervisor\non the hardware right then and there.\n\n124\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.870\nWhereas in this Windows Server 2012 you\ndo install the operating system and\n\n125\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.240\nthen you pick how it actually\ninstalls its hypervisor.\n\n126\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.830\nAnd we'll talk about that process cuz\nit's a neat process as we go through.\n\n127\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.510\nBut this is what we're focusing in on.\n\n128\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.440\nNow what are the actual\nadvantages here then?\n\n129\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.790\nWell notice that we aren't actually having\nto worry about the contention of resources\n\n130\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.920\nbetween the host operating system,\nas well as those VM's,\n\n131\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.080\nthose virtual machines that\nare actually up and running.\n\n132\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.730\nNow we can essentially take all of our\nresources that we have, the RAM, the hard\n\n133\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:48.110\ndrive space, the CPU, and really allow\nthem to focus in on the VM's themselves.\n\n134\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.070\nNow there's a little bit of a difference\nhere inside of Microsoft Hyper-V.\n\n135\n00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.114\nAnd that is because there is also\nwhat we call a management partition.\n\n136\n00:07:55.114 --> 00:07:59.771\nAnd that is now that the underlying\nhost operating system becomes another VM\n\n137\n00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:00.361\ninside.\n\n138\n00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:03.291\nAnd you do have to worry about actually\nmaking sure that there's resources\n\n139\n00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:03.856\nfor that one.\n\n140\n00:08:03.856 --> 00:08:06.800\nBut overall though,\nit's a great system for us, and\n\n141\n00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.080\nit's one that we absolutely want to\nget to learn and understand as well.\n\n142\n00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.870\nAll right, so\nhere I am on my virtual machine.\n\n143\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.690\nI need to bring up the Server Manager\nif I want to install the role.\n\n144\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.579\nSo I'm gonna now click on\nthe Server Manager on the taskbar.\n\n145\n00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:23.519\nAnd that should take a moment here and\nlaunch up and\n\n146\n00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.420\ngive me the options that I need.\n\n147\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.180\nNow the important thing here\nis actually being patient.\n\n148\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.260\nAnd this is probably my\nworst virtue that I have.\n\n149\n00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.430\nPatience is not always my thing.\n\n150\n00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.610\nBut you may see a little kind\nof blue bar that kind of\n\n151\n00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.780\nstrobes across the top here\nunderneath this gray one.\n\n152\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.760\nYou need to let it finish doing that.\n\n153\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.462\nIf not, it doesn't complain, but\n\n154\n00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:48.220\nit just doesn't keep up with what\nyou're actually trying to do.\n\n155\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.410\nWith this area right here in the middle,\nif I'm gonna configure this local server,\n\n156\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.740\nI'm gonna go ahead and select step 2,\nwhich is to add a role and feature.\n\n157\n00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.700\nNow, most of the time\nwith your servers you\n\n158\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.050\nwill probably have a static IP\naddress already set for you.\n\n159\n00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.700\nSo that way, that virtual machine now\nbecomes a server in the background and\n\n160\n00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.662\nthe host machine for us,\nand that's what we want.\n\n161\n00:09:11.662 --> 00:09:14.940\nNow remember what I said, even though\nthis is going to be a type I hypervisor,\n\n162\n00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.010\nwe're starting off like\nit's a type II hypervisor.\n\n163\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.950\nAnd the very fact that the operating\nsystem is installed and yet\n\n164\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.350\nthe hypervisor doesn't exist yet.\n\n165\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.310\nSo what I wanna do,\nis I wanna walk through this role and\n\n166\n00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.820\nfeature wizard and select Next.\n\n167\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.671\nAnd then we're gonna leave it at the role\nbased or feature based installation.\n\n168\n00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:38.670\nAnd we're gonna click Next here,\nand it's gonna ask me what machine?\n\n169\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.100\nAnd that's because of course, well,\nMicrosoft's virtual server and\n\n170\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.380\nthe manager here says, look, if you\nhave multiple things of these servers,\n\n171\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.660\nwhy are you gonna need to go\naround to multiple locations?\n\n172\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.100\nIf I can find it,\nI'll add in all the servers right here and\n\n173\n00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.040\nwe can install the roles at\nthe same time if you want to.\n\n174\n00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.050\nBut since I only have one,\nwe're actually gonna just do this one.\n\n175\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.825\nAnd so, there is the name of my server.\n\n176\n00:09:58.825 --> 00:10:06.640\nHyper-V01, and I'm gonna click Next, which\nis actually this machine that I'm on.\n\n177\n00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.730\nAnd then, as I scroll down through here,\nthe server option that we're looking for,\n\n178\n00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.810\nor the role that I'm looking for,\nis gonna be the one that says Hyper-V.\n\n179\n00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.110\nProvides the services that you can use to\ncreate and manage virtual machines and\n\n180\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.320\ntheir resources.\n\n181\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.174\nEach virtual machine is a virtualized\ncomputer system that operates as\n\n182\n00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:26.530\nan isolated execution.\n\n183\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.400\nIn other words,\nit operates as its own PC, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.660\nThis allows you to run multiple\noperating systems simultaneously.\n\n185\n00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.260\nThat is the option that we want.\n\n186\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.370\nAnd if there's any supporting\nfeatures that it needs,\n\n187\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.820\nMicrosoft is very good at saying hey,\nthis is what we need to add in here.\n\n188\n00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.564\nSo now we're gonna include\nthe management tools as well,\n\n189\n00:10:46.564 --> 00:10:49.030\ncuz those are good things for\nus to be able to manage.\n\n190\n00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:53.290\nSo we'll see where it's checked,\nand we'll click Next.\n\n191\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.150\nAnd if we actually have any other\nadditional features we wanna install,\n\n192\n00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.740\nI'm just going to leave it at\nthe bare minimum for right now.\n\n193\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.410\nAnd click Next here.\n\n194\n00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.450\nAnd then, click Next again.\n\n195\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.060\nAnd now it's asking about creating\nwhat we call a virtual switch.\n\n196\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.395\nNow, this doesn't\nnecessarily have to be done,\n\n197\n00:11:09.395 --> 00:11:13.640\ncuz you can see where it says Next right\nnow, I can go and recreate this later.\n\n198\n00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.400\nWell, what in the world is a virtual\nswitch and why do I need to create one?\n\n199\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.380\nA virtual switch is\nexactly like it sounds,\n\n200\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.040\nit takes a switch that we would\nnormally use in hardware and\n\n201\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.210\ngoes and plugs in the network adapter for\nmy virtual machines.\n\n202\n00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.780\nAnd you may say why do I need to do that?\n\n203\n00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.100\nBecause it's gonna connect\nout to somewhere, so\n\n204\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.260\nit's already giving us that ability\nto create a connection there.\n\n205\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.450\nWhen we create more VMs, I can tell it\nto attach it to this virtual switch.\n\n206\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.932\nAnd that allows them to automatically get\na connection into the network that my\n\n207\n00:11:42.932 --> 00:11:44.790\noriginal Hyper-V is actually gonna do.\n\n208\n00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.750\nSo I'm gonna select this network\nadapter and then click Next, again.\n\n209\n00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.740\nAnd then if I wanted to allow for\nother migrations.\n\n210\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.350\nNow, we're probably not\ndoing that right now.\n\n211\n00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.530\nThat's a little bit more\nadvanced of a feature.\n\n212\n00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.474\nIt allows us to be able to ask,\nafter we get Hyper-V installed,\n\n213\n00:12:00.474 --> 00:12:05.600\nif I had other Hyper-V servers out there,\nMicrosoft Server Hyper-Vs out there.\n\n214\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.117\nAnd they had virtual machines, and\nI wanted to cluster them together,\n\n215\n00:12:10.117 --> 00:12:14.407\nI could have them where they\nautomatically move or can move a virtual\n\n216\n00:12:14.407 --> 00:12:19.170\nmachine from one Hyper-V server to\nanother one without shutting it down.\n\n217\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.160\nRight now if I were to do that, let's\nsay on a type II hypervisor, and Wes and\n\n218\n00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.900\nI were running the same\ntype II hypervisor, and\n\n219\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.140\nI said, Wes,\nyou need this machine on yours.\n\n220\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.280\nWell, I'd have to shut it down,\nput it onto a drive somewhere.\n\n221\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.440\nWes would then connect that\ndrive onto his laptop.\n\n222\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.260\nCopy that over to his machine.\n\n223\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.720\nAnd then he'd turn it back on.\n\n224\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.440\nAnd it would be back on.\n\n225\n00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.620\nLive migration allows the actual\nHyper-V to manage that process,\n\n226\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.370\nwhere it actually does look like\nit is actually live and available.\n\n227\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.487\nBut it essentially shuts it down very\nquickly, moves the process over, and\n\n228\n00:12:55.487 --> 00:12:57.239\nturns it on very quickly again.\n\n229\n00:12:57.239 --> 00:13:00.440\nSo this is as close to live as you and\nI can get.\n\n230\n00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.720\nThe idea behind this is so\nthat if one machine fails,\n\n231\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.750\nthose machines then can start migrating\nthemselves to another machine,\n\n232\n00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.208\nhopefully before the time\nthe failure ends up happening.\n\n233\n00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:12.705\nSo if we wanted to,\nwe're not gonna worry about that.\n\n234\n00:13:12.705 --> 00:13:14.588\nIt's not a default right now,\nso I'm not gonna change it.\n\n235\n00:13:14.588 --> 00:13:18.790\nAnd then it's asking me\nabout the default location.\n\n236\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.760\nNow anything that we've actually set up so\n\n237\n00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.510\nfar, we can change at a later time and\ndate.\n\n238\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.310\nSo, at this point it says we're\ngonna actually be under users,\n\n239\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.470\npublic folders, Hyper-V and\nvirtual hard disks.\n\n240\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.450\nAnd I can change it right\nhere during the install,\n\n241\n00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.520\nwe're gonna change it\na little bit later on.\n\n242\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.640\nAnd we're gonna leave the configuration\nfiles also at its default.\n\n243\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.630\nAnd then I'm gonna put in\nthis checkbox that says,\n\n244\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.310\nrestart the destination\nserver automatically.\n\n245\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.355\nAnd click Yes, okay?\n\n246\n00:13:45.355 --> 00:13:49.938\nNow, what you're gonna see is when I click\non Install, it's gonna go through and\n\n247\n00:13:49.938 --> 00:13:54.620\ninstall all of the software that needs to,\nto do the installation process.\n\n248\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.584\nAnd then you might see that\nthe Hyper-V server now is actually\n\n249\n00:13:57.584 --> 00:13:59.130\ngonna change a couple of times.\n\n250\n00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:03.850\nThe first time that it might reboot\nis just to install the role, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.486\nTo make sure that the Hyper-V\nelement is actually installed and\n\n252\n00:14:07.486 --> 00:14:09.180\nworking on Server 2012.\n\n253\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:13.569\nBut it might go ahead and\nalso reboot a second time too.\n\n254\n00:14:13.569 --> 00:14:17.160\nNow you might be wondering\nwhat's happening there.\n\n255\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.201\nWell, remember that right\nnow when we take a look,\n\n256\n00:14:19.201 --> 00:14:21.440\nlet me going to go back to this\ndiagram here for a moment.\n\n257\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.661\nThat what we're really seeing is this\nkinda this install, which says Ronnie,\n\n258\n00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:28.970\nyou're actually creating\na type II hypervisor.\n\n259\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.810\nWell, during that second install,\n\n260\n00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:35.730\nwhat's going to end up happening is that\nthe underlying host operating system.\n\n261\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.920\nI don't know if I can move all this stuff\nor not, it doesn't look like I can.\n\n262\n00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.310\nIs it's gonna actually flip.\n\n263\n00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.200\nIn other words, this Windows 10 layer,\nor Windows Server 2012, I should say.\n\n264\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.610\nLet me change that up and\nthen we can see it.\n\n265\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:56.015\nThis Windows Server 2012 Layer\nis actually going to flip,\n\n266\n00:14:56.015 --> 00:14:59.700\nand it's gonna become essentially\nanother virtual machine.\n\n267\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.592\nOops, it's not letting me\nmove it the way I want to.\n\n268\n00:15:04.592 --> 00:15:09.640\nIt's gonna become another virtual machine,\nright up here,\n\n269\n00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:15.950\nin this environment instead, and\nthat will be called our parent partition.\n\n270\n00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:22.080\nSo, even the host machinewWill actually\nbe a virtualized machine for us.\n\n271\n00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.970\nAnd I don't know why it's\ntacking everything to it.\n\n272\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.810\nI don't wanna move it anymore\nmake it a little more junky.\n\n273\n00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:27.820\nBut that's what it's gonna do,\n\n274\n00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.070\nit's actually going to flip that,\nis what we're gonna end up seeing.\n\n275\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.940\nSo that even when I log\nback in to that machine,\n\n276\n00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.240\nif I can actually get back to it now.\n\n277\n00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.760\nLet me see if I can.\n\n278\n00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.430\nNow, my machine.\n\n279\n00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.930\nCome on.\n\n280\n00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.890\nGet back over there to this machine.\n\n281\n00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:48.706\nIt actually disconnected.\n\n282\n00:15:48.706 --> 00:15:50.633\nThat's why I couldn't get back into it.\n\n283\n00:15:50.633 --> 00:15:54.775\nSo, if it's now rebooting it might not\nallow me to come back into that machine\n\n284\n00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:57.019\nyet, but it may reboot a couple of times.\n\n285\n00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:59.494\nAnd that's what's happening right now, so\n\n286\n00:15:59.494 --> 00:16:01.976\nwe may end up seeing\nthat is what will happen.\n\n287\n00:16:01.976 --> 00:16:05.221\nSo in a moment it should reboot,\nand once it finishes like I said,\n\n288\n00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:09.370\nyou may see it reboot a couple of times,\nI should be able to log back into it.\n\n289\n00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.430\nNow my machine's actually rebooted\nthe couple of times it needed to, and\n\n290\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.860\nif we take a look here,\n\n291\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.550\nonce it actually rebooted it\nautomatically logged me back in.\n\n292\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:22.700\nAnd I can see that now I have\nthe Hyper V role here installed.\n\n293\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.230\nAnd everything is actually done.\n\n294\n00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.040\nI can also check this flag\non the notifications.\n\n295\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.260\nAnd I can see where it says installation\nsucceeded on the Hyper v01, and so\n\n296\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.400\nnow everything is actually good and ready\nfor us to actually do what we need to do.\n\n297\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.030\nNow at this point,\n\n298\n00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.650\nremember what has happened has made\nit into the type on hypervisor,\n\n299\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.030\nis that it flips so that the hypervisor\nis actually directly underneath.\n\n300\n00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.210\nThis host operating system is\nwhat it's gonna look like.\n\n301\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.030\nBut now everybody has access to it and\n\n302\n00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:57.040\nthey're all really only one layer of\nabstraction away, let me get rid of that.\n\n303\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.000\nInstead, so everything is riding on\ntop of just that hypervisor itself.\n\n304\n00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.910\nSo we're no longer actually dealing with\nthose two layers like what we had before.\n\n305\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:11.360\nLet me copy that and see,\nI can't even do that.\n\n306\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.480\nLet me try it again here.\n\n307\n00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.780\nOh, it's not going to let me do it,\nfor one reason or another,\n\n308\n00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.770\nwhatever it might be.\n\n309\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.900\nSo I'm gonna copy that back down,\nbut that's fine.\n\n310\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.890\nSo when you actually end up seeing\nthat here, that's what's going on and\n\n311\n00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.300\nthat's what makes it\na type one hypervisor.\n\n312\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.030\nYou may get fooled by that, because of\nthe way that it actually happens, but\n\n313\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.290\nthe good thing is Microsoft\ntakes care of it for us.\n\n314\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.040\nNow, let me put in one more\ncaveat here when we start\n\n315\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.360\ntalking about the Microsoft Type-1\nhypervisor as well, okay.\n\n316\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.490\nThere's a couple of different products\nthat go by the name hypervisor.\n\n317\n00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:46.100\nOr HyperV I should say, and this what\nI need to make sure that we point out.\n\n318\n00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.720\nSo with the Windows Server 2012 HyperV,\nright?\n\n319\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.640\nThis is a type one hypervisor which\ninstalls, which is a role in the feature\n\n320\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.800\nthat gets installed when you\ninstall it in Windows Server 2012,\n\n321\n00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.210\nand then you can choose to install or not.\n\n322\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:06.970\nBut Microsoft actually has a stand-alone\nMicrosoft HyperV, a product itself.\n\n323\n00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:12.780\nAnd that is all 100% command line,\nthat you can actually have instead.\n\n324\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.400\nNow, we're not really getting in to\nthat particular server right now.\n\n325\n00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.430\nThis is probably the most popular\nimplementation of Hyper V,\n\n326\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.600\nand the reason why is it gives you\nthat nice graphical user interface.\n\n327\n00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.010\nAnd instead of you having to do everything\nthrough Power Shell or Net SH, or\n\n328\n00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.860\nwhatever the command language may be.\n\n329\n00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.950\nYou know you can actually use this, and\nthis is probably the one that we're\n\n330\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:37.880\nprobably gonna be more familiar with,\nand encounter more often is write here.\n\n331\n00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.590\nOkay.\n\n332\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.880\nSo if you are actually starting to work\ninside of the virtualization environment,\n\n333\n00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.860\nand they tell you that you're\ngonna actually use Hyper-V,\n\n334\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.480\nyou're gonna see that.\n\n335\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.560\nThe other place that you'll also\nend up seeing the Hyper-V install,\n\n336\n00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.320\nis also what you hear about is what\nwe call the client Hyper-V as well.\n\n337\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.510\nAnd then client Hyper-v,\nwe saw this really in Windows 8, yeah,\n\n338\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.140\n8, 8.1 and now in Windows 10.\n\n339\n00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.090\nAnd that means on your operating systems\nthat you have at home as long as their\n\n340\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.000\nnot the, what is it, the Home Edition.\n\n341\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.920\nThe lower edition,\n\n342\n00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.460\nthe lower end edition of those machines,\nof that operating system,\n\n343\n00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.470\nthen you'll probably see that you can\ninstall Hyper-V directly in there as well.\n\n344\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.540\nAnd that will allow you to run it on\nyour own Windows 10 machine, too.\n\n345\n00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.900\n>> Yeah, that was a really,\nreally good feature and you're right,\n\n346\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.860\nit's kinda interesting how their\nnaming conventions did change.\n\n347\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.330\nSo I believe it's\nthe Professional edition and\n\n348\n00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.310\nthen the Enterprise edition which\ntoday requires volume licensing.\n\n349\n00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.560\nAnd you might be asking yourself,\n\n350\n00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.360\nwell why would I want to use\nsomething like client Hyper-V?\n\n351\n00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.870\nYou know when we've got the server\nHyper-V, well think about it this way.\n\n352\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.410\nIf you wanna test, or if you wanna do\nmaintenance on one of the VMs that\n\n353\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.480\nare running within your\nproduction environment.\n\n354\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.860\nOf course you don't want to disrupt\nyour production environment, so\n\n355\n00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.425\nyou can always pause the stated machine,\nshut the machine down, take a snapshot.\n\n356\n00:19:54.425 --> 00:19:59.450\nOr clone if you will, and then explore it\ndown to the client you can work on it.\n\n357\n00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.650\nTest it out,\nsee if its gonna do what you need to do.\n\n358\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.470\nOr even build the virtual machine\nall from the client side Hyper-V and\n\n359\n00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.530\nthe important back up to the production\nenvironment And there you go.\n\n360\n00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.340\nNo downtime,\n\n361\n00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.560\nyou still get the ability that you can\ndo a moderate amount of configuration.\n\n362\n00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.980\nI'm sure it's missing some of the bells\nand whistles at the server side would\n\n363\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.780\nhave, but it is nice I would say to be\nable to work with those, and take them\n\n364\n00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.570\nout of the production environment,\nrather than bringing it to its knees.\n\n365\n00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.370\n>> Well let's go and\ntake a look at this Hyper-V role, and\n\n366\n00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:31.210\nwe'll talk about the basics\nof creating that VM, right?\n\n367\n00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.650\nRemember, that we're not talking about\ninstalling the operating system yet.\n\n368\n00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.220\nWe're really just saying,\nlet's go and visualize some hardware.\n\n369\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.170\nSo, we're going to create our first VM.\n\n370\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:42.380\nNow, this is one of the funnest things, at\nleast for me, when we went to serve 2008.\n\n371\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.910\nIt was not as easy as\nright clicking on stuff.\n\n372\n00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:50.660\nSo, I'm right clicking out here in\nHyper-V and Wes, I can't do anything.\n\n373\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.360\nSo, it's a little bit tricky,\n\n374\n00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.260\nwhere you have to come inside of\nhere after you select a grouping.\n\n375\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.210\nAnd then when I select the server,\nnotice I can right click there, and\n\n376\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.991\nwhat I'm looking for\nis what we call the Hyper-V Manager.\n\n377\n00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:06.870\nNow, Wes is correct here that\neven though on the client side,\n\n378\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:12.890\nit's actually designed to run on\na desktop, on a desktop operating system.\n\n379\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.250\nThe management tool is actually the same.\n\n380\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.250\nNow, you don't have every single\nfeature that you have inside of\n\n381\n00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.830\nthe server edition.\n\n382\n00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:20.820\nBut on the client side,\n\n383\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.540\nyou have most of the features that will\nallow you to create and manage BMs.\n\n384\n00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.540\nAnd the reason why they wanted you to have\nthat especially for the enterprise, right?\n\n385\n00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.800\nIs what Wes was talking about, the very\nfact is, somebody may come to you and say,\n\n386\n00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.570\nhey we needed to create this VMs, and you\ngo all right, I need to access the server.\n\n387\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.510\nThey're saying no, do it on your machine.\n\n388\n00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.490\nWell, you can do it and\nit actually is paired.\n\n389\n00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.090\nIn other words,\na VM that you create on your own desktop,\n\n390\n00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.830\nis actually one that you can take and\nimport or export, and\n\n391\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:51.110\nthen it can get imported into\na Hyper-V production server.\n\n392\n00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.390\nAnd because you natively\ncreated it on Hyper-V,\n\n393\n00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.160\nand you're actually importing on Hyper-V,\nshould work fine.\n\n394\n00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.990\n>> And that's great, I mean what\nbetter to have from the clients side.\n\n395\n00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.250\nIf you're not familiar,\nsay oh, I'm on a server now.\n\n396\n00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.070\nWell guess what,\nif you're on the client and\n\n397\n00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.300\nyou're dealing with Hyper-V,\nthe interface is identical.\n\n398\n00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.990\nIt's just missing some of the bells and\n\n399\n00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.930\nwhistles that you normally need\nin a production environment,\n\n400\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:14.300\nlike application level virtualization,\nRemoteFX isn't gonna be on the client.\n\n401\n00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.230\nBut the interfaces, identical.\n\n402\n00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:17.670\nSo if you use it on the client,\n\n403\n00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.300\nyou should be pretty familiar with it\nmoving over to the server, right Ronnie?\n\n404\n00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.010\n>> You should,\nit should just look exactly the same here.\n\n405\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.119\nSo it makes it easy that if you do that,\n\n406\n00:22:26.119 --> 00:22:29.050\nright, you're not learning\na different interface for the client.\n\n407\n00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.160\nYou're not learning a different interface\nfor the server manager as well.\n\n408\n00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.600\nSo let's go ahead and get into this.\n\n409\n00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.652\nSo when you take a look at\nthe server manager pane,\n\n410\n00:22:36.652 --> 00:22:41.087\nall these manager panes kind of go\nahead and give you the manager itself,\n\n411\n00:22:41.087 --> 00:22:43.790\nkind of give you the same outlook, right.\n\n412\n00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.410\nOver here on the left hand side\nnavigation, in the center details, and\n\n413\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.080\nover on the right hand side of course,\n\n414\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.350\nactions that you can perform\non whatever you select on.\n\n415\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.980\nSo for example, if I click on\nthe Hyper-V01, notice that the actions\n\n416\n00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.460\nchange and then the details in\nthe center here change as well.\n\n417\n00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.990\nIt can show us the list of\nvirtual machines that we create.\n\n418\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.804\nAnd of course Microsoft doesn't\ncall them snapshots, okay.\n\n419\n00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:14.150\nWhereas everything else that we've\nlooked at as far as technologies go,\n\n420\n00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:19.540\nvirtual box and VMWare work station and\nVMWare ESX and stuff.\n\n421\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.250\nWe called them snapshots.\n\n422\n00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.530\nMicrosoft of course has to change it,\nand they call them checkpoints.\n\n423\n00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:29.590\nCheckpoints and snapshots essentially\nare the same type of idea.\n\n424\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.950\nAt least I don't just want to tell you\nthey are actually done all the same, but\n\n425\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:36.160\nthat they really do at least\nhelp you do the same thing.\n\n426\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.130\nThen over here on the right hand side,\nnotice it is a contextual menu,\n\n427\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:44.350\nwhich says for Hyper-V01,\nlook at all the things I can do.\n\n428\n00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.370\nI can import in a Virtual Machine.\n\n429\n00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.220\nI can change to Hyper-V settings.\n\n430\n00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.260\nSo right now all of these other things\nthat we're seeing beside the words New\n\n431\n00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.998\nat this point, is what we would call\na global configuration setting.\n\n432\n00:23:55.998 --> 00:23:59.784\nAnd that means it changes\nit on the Hyper-V itself.\n\n433\n00:23:59.784 --> 00:24:02.462\nThat means that any\nvirtual machine I change,\n\n434\n00:24:02.462 --> 00:24:06.110\nwill also end up getting some\nof this information too.\n\n435\n00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.780\nAnd it even shows how\nto connect in here too.\n\n436\n00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.840\nOkay, so editing the disk, stopping\nthe service, all that will also effect,\n\n437\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.920\nof course, virtual machines inside.\n\n438\n00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.210\nThe one that we're actually gonna focus\nin on right now, is gonna select and\n\n439\n00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.300\ncreate a new virtual machine.\n\n440\n00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.210\nSo all I have to do is click on new,\nand then I can select virtual machine.\n\n441\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:28.070\nNotice it can allow me to virtualize\na hard drive, and even a floppy disk.\n\n442\n00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.630\nNow you may be wondering like, why in\nthe world would they have a floppy disk?\n\n443\n00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.610\nWell, in production environments,\nstill, they're still,\n\n444\n00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.470\nokay, this unusual thing in which\nthey're not normally early adopters.\n\n445\n00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:45.030\nThe idea behind a production environment,\nis about stability and about reliability.\n\n446\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.420\nAnd so you may still find that\nthere is software out there\n\n447\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.780\nthat requires you to boot up to a floppy\ndisk, and that's because it's really old.\n\n448\n00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.707\nAnd so instead,\nif you needed to devirtualize that, and\n\n449\n00:24:55.707 --> 00:25:00.520\nthat server would still did require that,\nyou can virtualize that floppy disk, and\n\n450\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.450\nthen have it treated like the floppy that\nthat software is gonna look for as well.\n\n451\n00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.570\nWe are gonna focus in\non a virtual machine.\n\n452\n00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.960\nIn a virtual machine environment,\nof course, most of them,\n\n453\n00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.640\njust like we saw in the type\ntwo hypervisors, and some of\n\n454\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.840\nthe type one hypervisors, it actually\njust gives us a nice little wizard.\n\n455\n00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.600\nAnd that's the same thing that\nwe're gonna see right here.\n\n456\n00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.510\nAnd I'm simply gonna click next from here,\nand then we would give it a name.\n\n457\n00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.680\nNow, the key here, of course, is a nice\ndescriptive name that you can identify\n\n458\n00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:33.213\nthis with for us, and\nwe'll just call this one Hyper-V,\n\n459\n00:25:33.213 --> 00:25:37.100\nand I'm going to do test, 0, 1.\n\n460\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.610\nAnd notice I can actually store\nin a different location from\n\n461\n00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.910\nthe actual default folder, if I wanted to.\n\n462\n00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.810\nSo I'm going to click on\nbrowse right here, and\n\n463\n00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:52.335\nthen let's say I wanna put this into this,\ngo to PC and document too.\n\n464\n00:25:52.335 --> 00:25:57.440\nSelect new folder and\nI'll call this one VMs, and in general.\n\n465\n00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.840\nAnd then if I wanted to, I could\neven create a sub-folder inside, and\n\n466\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.280\nwe'll call this one Hyper-V,\n\n467\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.398\nI didn't even know how to\nspell Hyper-V earlier here,\n\n468\n00:26:11.398 --> 00:26:15.700\nHyper-V test 0, 1, and let's say I\nwant to store everything in here.\n\n469\n00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.440\nI'm going to select that folder,\nand that will work for us.\n\n470\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.540\nOh I did pretty good, click next.\n\n471\n00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.120\nWhether I'm going to do a generation\none or generation two type of VM.\n\n472\n00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.690\nNow, this one actually\ndoes specify which one.\n\n473\n00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.120\nThis virtual machine provides the same\nvirtual hardware to the virtual machine as\n\n474\n00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.270\nin previous editions of Hyper-V.\n\n475\n00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:40.230\nSo if you actually have other,\nlet's say it this way.\n\n476\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.686\nIf you are running Hyper-V, let's say\nyou're running server 2008 Hyper-V and\n\n477\n00:26:43.686 --> 00:26:47.745\nyou're running server 2012,\nmake sure you select generation 1.\n\n478\n00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.920\nIf you know that you're all\ngonna be on server 2012,\n\n479\n00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.620\nmake sure you select generation 2.\n\n480\n00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.585\nIf you know that there's a possibility\nwhere you're actually using older\n\n481\n00:26:56.585 --> 00:26:59.050\nHyper-Vs, that's the key.\n\n482\n00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.870\nSo let's just go ahead and\nmake a generation 2 here by default,\n\n483\n00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.060\ncuz that's the one that we're gonna do.\n\n484\n00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.380\nAnd oh, here's the warning, right.\n\n485\n00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.670\nOnce a virtual machine has been created,\nyou cannot change its generation.\n\n486\n00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.490\nSo that means if you have a chance of\nbelieving that you're gonna try and\n\n487\n00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:19.630\nmove this to an older Hyper-V server,\nyou might want to create a generation 1.\n\n488\n00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.120\nI'm not, so\nI'm gonna leave it at generation 2.\n\n489\n00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.240\nClick Next.\n\n490\n00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.550\nHow much memory do I want to\ngive this machine at startup?\n\n491\n00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.580\nAnd whether or not I'm gonna\nuse dynamic memory here, okay.\n\n492\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.500\nSo the bare minimum for this machine\nat startup is 512 megs of RAM.\n\n493\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.630\nIf I wanted to, I could tell it go\nahead and claim, let's say all 2 gigs\n\n494\n00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:46.310\nof the RAM, oops, 248 here, and\nthen I can also use dynamic memory too.\n\n495\n00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.120\nDynamic memory says don't\nhog the 2 gigs around.\n\n496\n00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.460\nIf you don't need it after the start up,\nchange it.\n\n497\n00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.400\nIn other words, reduce the amount\nof RAM that you're using, and\n\n498\n00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.340\nthen take more as you want\nto up to about 2 gigs.\n\n499\n00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.040\nOkay?\n\n500\n00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.760\nSo that is good inside of\na testing environment.\n\n501\n00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.860\nInside of an environment in which\nthe virtual machine itself is not\n\n502\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.310\nmission critical for your organization.\n\n503\n00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.891\nIf it is actually a machine that you\nknow that people are gonna hit every\n\n504\n00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:10.950\nonce in a while.\n\n505\n00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.180\nWell then use the dynamic.\n\n506\n00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.500\nIf it's a machine that you're gonna\nbe testing on, use a dynamic.\n\n507\n00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.350\nIf you're using this as\na production machine,\n\n508\n00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:21.800\none that's gonna be mission critical like\nan email server or a web server, then yes,\n\n509\n00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.090\nmake sure you go ahead and\ndon't check that as well.\n\n510\n00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.290\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and use\nthe dynamic here, cuz we don't need it.\n\n511\n00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.290\nAnd then the connection that I want, and\nnotice that there's that virtual switch\n\n512\n00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:36.190\nthat we created right from the very\nbeginning when we installed the role.\n\n513\n00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:41.910\nSo here is virtualizing a switch that\nit can plug this VM into automatically.\n\n514\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.670\nAnd then click next, and\n\n515\n00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.540\nfrom here it's asking me, do I want to\ngo ahead and create this hard drive?\n\n516\n00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.720\nAnd it's giving me a maximum, so\nI'm gonna do 64 here instead.\n\n517\n00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.860\nAnd there it is, it actually went\nahead and found my direct location.\n\n518\n00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.910\nSo not only am I gonna ask you\nhow the configuration file for\n\n519\n00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.350\nthis Hyper-V server in there, but\nalso of course the virtual hard disk.\n\n520\n00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.760\nThe virtual hard disk is representing the\nhard drive that I would normally have in\n\n521\n00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.050\na physical machine.\n\n522\n00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.240\nBut now it's gonna save\nit as a file instead.\n\n523\n00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.550\nI can use an existing one if I wanted to.\n\n524\n00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:18.240\nIn other words, if I were pulling\nin another virtual hard disk, and\n\n525\n00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.512\nI needed to attach it here, I could do\nthe same thing by actually attaching, or\n\n526\n00:29:22.512 --> 00:29:24.488\nI can actually attach one later on.\n\n527\n00:29:24.488 --> 00:29:27.172\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\ncreate one right here,\n\n528\n00:29:27.172 --> 00:29:30.100\njust really kind of the default as well.\n\n529\n00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.060\nAnd then on installing an operating\nsystem, I'm gonna choose that for\n\n530\n00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.130\nlater on.\n\n531\n00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.280\nBut notice I can actually continue\nall the way through, and at the end,\n\n532\n00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.200\nit will begin the process\nof trying to load that up.\n\n533\n00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:45.050\nIn an environment in which you're actually\ntrying to do this as quickly as you can,\n\n534\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.320\nyou're actually going to go ahead and\n\n535\n00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.250\ninstall the operating system\nfrom a bootable image.\n\n536\n00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:52.170\nOr even from a network based\ninstallation server as well,\n\n537\n00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.980\nwhere it can do some pixie booting.\n\n538\n00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.110\nSo you have the ability.\n\n539\n00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.390\nI'm just gonna leave that for\nlater on so that we can configure it.\n\n540\n00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.780\nAnd we'll do that another episode\nto install the operating system.\n\n541\n00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.310\nAnd click Next here.\n\n542\n00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.920\nAnd then in the end there it is.\n\n543\n00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.040\nIt's giving me all the details for me to\ntake a look at and to create a summary of.\n\n544\n00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.569\nAnd at that point I'm gonna click Finish.\n\n545\n00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.390\nSo once everything is actually done,\nthere it is,\n\n546\n00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.962\nthere is my first virtual\nmachine in Hyper-V 2012.\n\n547\n00:30:17.962 --> 00:30:22.404\nRemember, that it doesn't have an\noperating system, but now it actually has\n\n548\n00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:26.981\na representation of, well all of the\nmemory, the networking, the virtual hard\n\n549\n00:30:26.981 --> 00:30:31.492\ndrive that actually allows me to\ncreate a hard drive that size as well.\n\n550\n00:30:31.492 --> 00:30:34.840\nAll of that is now represented\non this virtual machine.\n\n551\n00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.040\nNext thing that I have to do,\n\n552\n00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.380\nis just go back through that, verify\nthat it's everything that I want to.\n\n553\n00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.890\nAnd then I can begin the process\nof installing an operating system.\n\n554\n00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.480\nBut Wes, you let me talk too long and\nthat means, we need another episode here.\n\n555\n00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.800\n>> Well that's great information,\n\n556\n00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.570\nI'm certainly not gonna interrupt you\nwhen we got such good information.\n\n557\n00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.900\nSo thank you for that Ronnie.\n\n558\n00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.550\nKeep in mind some of the things that\nwe have looked at in this episode.\n\n559\n00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:58.972\nWe've looked at the installing\nthe Hyper-V role in server 2012R2.\n\n560\n00:30:58.972 --> 00:31:01.852\nWe've looked at what it takes,\nsome of the requirements,\n\n561\n00:31:01.852 --> 00:31:05.490\nthe hardware requirements in order to\nget this hypervisor up and running.\n\n562\n00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.600\nWe've also looked at what the host\nrequirements for the machine.\n\n563\n00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.680\nAs well as the guest requirements.\n\n564\n00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.110\nKeep in mind that when you are going\nto build one of the virtual machines,\n\n565\n00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.310\nthe virtual hardware, do your research.\n\n566\n00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.800\nIf you're gonna be testing out a piece of\nsoftware, keep in mind that anything that\n\n567\n00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.920\nit says, you know, hardware related for\nthe requirements to test that software,\n\n568\n00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.760\nis gonna be what you're gonna wanna set\nthat up inside of Hyper-V beforehand.\n\n569\n00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.730\n>> All right, just remember that\nthis is really the beginning, right?\n\n570\n00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:34.820\nWhen we start taking a look\nat working with Hyper-V.\n\n571\n00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.900\nUnderstanding the install process\nis something that we need to be\n\n572\n00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.890\nable to at least have seen here.\n\n573\n00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.600\nRight?\n\n574\n00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.100\nRemember that it might actually\nreboot a couple of times, and\n\n575\n00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:49.070\nthat normally is where it wears\non your patience a little bit.\n\n576\n00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.860\nSo just be a little bit patient.\n\n577\n00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.930\nMake sure you actually get it up and\nrunning, and then take a few minutes and\n\n578\n00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.450\nexplore the interface.\n\n579\n00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.630\nYou saw that creating a virtual\nmachine is really not that difficult.\n\n580\n00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:01.510\nIt does require you to take\na little bit of time and effort and\n\n581\n00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.390\nunderstand some of\nthe settings that are there.\n\n582\n00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.150\nBut use the guide that we actually\njust kind of showed you, and\n\n583\n00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:10.200\ntake some time here and build that first\nvirtual machine, and then come back and\n\n584\n00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.390\njoin us for our second episode,\nas we start installing a VM as well.\n\n585\n00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:16.990\n>> Well thank you for all that\ninformation, and it does look like we've\n\n586\n00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.400\ncome to the end of another exciting\nepisode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n587\n00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.640\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and sign out for\nus, and I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n588\n00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.310\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n589\n00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.691\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n590\n00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:31.850\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Then Mike shows some of the different settings that we might want to consider customizing before creating a VM in Hyper-V.  Since most Type I Hypervisors are used in a production environment they mention that taking the time to make the customization is worth the time and effort to be more efficient later as we produce more VMs on Hyper-V.",

00:00:16.756\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:20.570\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look\nat virtualization technologies.\n\n5\n00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.660\nVirtualization of course is a technology\nthat all IT workers should be\n\n6\n00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.641\nfamiliar with.\n\n7\n00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.625\nSo we want to make sure that we\nhave a great understanding and\n\n8\n00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:32.683\nright now we're gonna actually take a look\nat one those technologies that we call\n\n9\n00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:34.270\nMicrosoft HyperV.\n\n10\n00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.130\nAnd who better to help us than, well, Mr.\nMicrosoft himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.350\nMike, when we talk about\nthe idea of virtualization,\n\n12\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.050\nMicrosoft really does have a solid\nsolution for us, don't they?\n\n13\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.750\n>> Absolutely.\n\n14\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.060\nHyper V has gone through many evolutions,\nand Microsoft was maybe,\n\n15\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.850\nconsidered a little behind the game\nwhen Hyper V first came out,\n\n16\n00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.750\nif you did a feature to feature comparison\nbut they've definitely caught up.\n\n17\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810\nThey are right there in the forefront.\n\n18\n00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.180\nIt's a great product to use, and it's one\nthat we see used a lot in enterprise,\n\n19\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.000\nprimarily because we're already\nrunning Server 2012, 2012 R2,\n\n20\n00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.170\nand we can install Hyper V on that, right?\n\n21\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.630\nIt's just a role we have to install.\n\n22\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.260\nIt's not an additional license\nthat I have to go out and get, so\n\n23\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.540\nit's a very common solution for\nenterprises that are moving\n\n24\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.530\ninto virtualization, because it's like\nI said it's something we already have.\n\n25\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.970\nAnd a lot of companies use it\nas virtualization solution.\n\n26\n00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.790\n>> Now, Mike, in a previous episode we\nalready took a look at looking something\n\n27\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.950\nlike VirtualBox, as well as one of the\ntechnologies that we've been diving into.\n\n28\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.910\nSo Mike,\nwhat is it that's really different about\n\n29\n00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.940\nMicrosoft's Hyper V versus\nsomething like Virtualbox?\n\n30\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.650\n>> Virtualbox is a fantastic application,\nI love it.\n\n31\n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.610\nIn fact, you're the one that turned\nme on to that a few years ago, and\n\n32\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.420\nit's great for testing, for\ncreating little sandboxes on your PC.\n\n33\n00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.000\nIt's not an enterprise solution though,\nit's a type two hypervisor,\n\n34\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.980\nmeaning that it runs as an application\non your desktop operating system or\n\n35\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.950\non your server operating system,\nit can do that.\n\n36\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.920\nBut Hyper V is one of those type one\nhypervisors we talked about that\n\n37\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.940\nin previous episodes.\n\n38\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.500\nRonnie had some great drawings and when we\ncompared type two or type one, remember\n\n39\n00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.000\ntype two had that operating system\nthat I installed on my computer, and\n\n40\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.770\nthen we had that hypervisor on top of that\nand then our guest OS is on top of that.\n\n41\n00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.680\nSo we were going through\ntwo layers of emulation or\n\n42\n00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.710\nvirtualization I should say,\nas we go down through this.\n\n43\n00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.950\nSo performance is not quite the same,\nwhereas with a A type I hypervisor,\n\n44\n00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.210\nthat hypervisor gets installed\nunderneath everything,\n\n45\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.290\nright on top of the bare metal.\n\n46\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.650\nAnd then what we would call\nour host operating system,\n\n47\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.320\nthe one that we deal with when we login to\nthe physical machine, is actually running\n\n48\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.520\nas what they call a parent partition,\nso it's It's actually going through\n\n49\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.610\nthe hypervisor as well, even though it's\ninstalled physically on that machine.\n\n50\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.410\nSo it's a little bit different in\nthat respect when you look at it\n\n51\n00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.745\nunder the hood.\n\n52\n00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:08.570\nPerformance-wise it's a lot better.\n\n53\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.690\nBecause we've lost one layer\nof distraction, right.\n\n54\n00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.250\nThat hypervisor has direct\naccess to the physical hardware.\n\n55\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.020\nAnd then our virtual machines that we\ninstall on top of that are only going\n\n56\n00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.970\nthrough one layer of abstraction when they\nneed to talk to that physical hardware.\n\n57\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.810\nSo performance wise, it's fantastic.\n\n58\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.040\nThere's other things too,\nthat we've gotta consider.\n\n59\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.800\nWhereas, with VirtualBox, you're\nrunning that as an application right?\n\n60\n00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.900\nSo when you log on,\nyou're launching virtual box and\n\n61\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.590\nthen you're launching\nyour virtual machines.\n\n62\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.440\nWhat happens when you log off?\n\n63\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.100\nAny application that you\nare running is now ended, right?\n\n64\n00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.130\nSo in order to have those virtual machines\navailable to the network all the times,\n\n65\n00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.590\nyou'd have to remain logged\non to that server or\n\n66\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.502\nwhatever you're running at on and\nthat's not an elegant solution, right?\n\n67\n00:03:58.502 --> 00:04:02.840\nWhereas Hyper V,\nthese virtual machines that we create\n\n68\n00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.270\nreally run like a service\nin the background.\n\n69\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.210\nI don't have to log on in the machine or\nanything.\n\n70\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.810\nOnce I start those machines up,\nthey're running.\n\n71\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.255\nI log off the machine,\n\n72\n00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:15.217\nthose virtual machines are still\nrunning in the background.\n\n73\n00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:19.517\nIn fact, we set it up to where if that\nmachine ever reboots the physical machine,\n\n74\n00:04:19.517 --> 00:04:22.682\nthose virtual machines start\nup automatically as well, so\n\n75\n00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:24.157\nit's more like a service.\n\n76\n00:04:24.157 --> 00:04:28.609\nAnd that's really what we need if we're\ngoing to be using virtual machines for\n\n77\n00:04:28.609 --> 00:04:32.725\nproviding services to our enterprise\nwe need to make sure those machines\n\n78\n00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:34.690\nare running all the time.\n\n79\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.630\n>> All right Mike.\nSo let me give you a small scenario here.\n\n80\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.360\nLet's say this sounds great and something\nthat I really would like to do as an IT\n\n81\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.470\nworker to learn a little\nbit more about Hyper V.\n\n82\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.743\nSo I need at least Server 2008 probably or\nServer 2008 I think and Server 2012.\n\n83\n00:04:51.743 --> 00:04:55.350\nI even can do it on some of\nthe client operating system as well.\n\n84\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.730\nBut if I need Hyper V is that an extra\nproduct that I to purchase from\n\n85\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.820\nMicrosoft then.\n\n86\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.922\n>> No, that's the great thing about\nHyper V is it's part of the server\n\n87\n00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:03.857\noperating system.\n\n88\n00:05:03.857 --> 00:05:05.738\nIt's a role that I have to install.\n\n89\n00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:09.942\nSo if I've already paid for the license\nfor that server operating system,\n\n90\n00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:12.140\nI could install Hyper V on there.\n\n91\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.990\nNow we still need to worry about licensing\nfor the virtual machines, right.\n\n92\n00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.350\nThat doesn't change, but Windows Server\n2012 R2 has some great licensing options.\n\n93\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.141\nIf you go into, if you pay for\n\n94\n00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:28.188\ndata center which is gonna be\na more expensive license upfront.\n\n95\n00:05:28.188 --> 00:05:32.519\nYou can get enterprise and you can get\ndata center, or I should say standard and\n\n96\n00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.310\ndata center.\n\n97\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.660\nThere really isn't an enterprise anymore.\n\n98\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.520\nStandard gives you a license to\ninstall it onto a physical machine and\n\n99\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.780\nthen you can create two virtual\nmachines with that standard license.\n\n100\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.620\nSo you could really get three\ninstalls of Server 2012, 2012 R2,\n\n101\n00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.110\nout of that one license.\n\n102\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.610\nBut if you need more\nvirtual servers than that,\n\n103\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.390\nthen you're gonna have to\nbuy additional licenses.\n\n104\n00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.270\nAnd if I'm starting with a data center,\n\n105\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.130\ndata center gives you the license to\ninstall at once on a physical machine and\n\n106\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.880\nthen unlimited virtual machines\nthat you can create on there.\n\n107\n00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.580\nSo if you take that one physical license,\nand you install Hyper V,\n\n108\n00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.920\nnow I've got licenses for\nan unlimited number of virtual servers.\n\n109\n00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.210\nSo yeah, it's a bigger expense initially,\nright, to get that data center license.\n\n110\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.590\nBut if I plan on rolling out 10,\n12, 20, 50 virtual machines,\n\n111\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.310\nand it really might be cost effective\nto fork out the extra money for\n\n112\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.080\nthat data center license up front and\nthen not have to worry about buying\n\n113\n00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.860\nan individual license for\neach one of my virtual machines.\n\n114\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.825\nBut yeah, as far as it goes whether is\nstandard of data center it's just a role\n\n115\n00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:43.289\nthat we're gonna install.\n\n116\n00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:47.919\nNow I've already got Hyper V installed and\nI did that because it's not that it takes\n\n117\n00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.910\na long time, but\nit does require a couple of reboots.\n\n118\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.480\nRemember, this is a type one hypervisor\nwhich means it gets laid right across\n\n119\n00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.180\nthat physical hardware,\nunderneath even my host operating system,\n\n120\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.050\nwhich is going to require two\nreboots to finish that process.\n\n121\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.770\nSo I didn't want to go through that, but\n\n122\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.860\nlet me show you where you would go if\nyou were getting ready to install it.\n\n123\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.270\nSo I've got here an installation of Server\n2012 R2, and just like any other role,\n\n124\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.790\nI'm simply gonna go to my dashboard on\nserver manager and choose add roles and\n\n125\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.230\nfeatures to launch the add Roles and\nFeatures Wizard.\n\n126\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.210\nI'll click Next a couple of times to get\npast the role based installation, make\n\n127\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.240\nsure I've got the right physical server\nthat I want to install this role on and\n\n128\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.680\nthen I get to the list of roles and\nyou can see I have already checked or\n\n129\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.600\nit's already installed but\nthat's where I would choose it.\n\n130\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.662\nI would just simply put\na check mark there for\n\n131\n00:07:41.662 --> 00:07:46.490\nHyper V, it's gonna ask me if I want\nto include the management consoles and\n\n132\n00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.960\nthe power shell modules and all of that\ngood stuff, of course I'm gonna say yes.\n\n133\n00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.501\nClick Next, Next, Next, and\nInstall and you're good to go.\n\n134\n00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:55.754\nAgain, it is gonna require a reboot.\n\n135\n00:07:55.754 --> 00:07:57.369\nIt'll warn you of that in the end,\n\n136\n00:07:57.369 --> 00:08:00.121\nyou got the little check mark\nthat you can choose to do the.\n\n137\n00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:03.863\nAutomatic reboot if you want\nto after that role installs.\n\n138\n00:08:03.863 --> 00:08:07.293\nAnd then once it comes back up,\nI'll go ahead and cancel this,\n\n139\n00:08:07.293 --> 00:08:10.130\nyou'll see that I have Hyper-V installed.\n\n140\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.180\nAnd then I've got my Hyper-V console.\n\n141\n00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.452\nI can go to tools, and\nthen Hyper-V manager.\n\n142\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.760\nAnd here is a nice fresh\ninstall of Hyper-V.\n\n143\n00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.080\n>> And now, Mike, let's make sure\nthat as we get started here,\n\n144\n00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.620\nwe understand what's happening.\n\n145\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.940\nA lot of times when we take a look at it,\nfor example,\n\n146\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.022\nwhen we're doing a type two hypervisor,\nit's what we're normally used to, right?\n\n147\n00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:34.286\nThe very fact is we have our\noperating system, we go ahead and\n\n148\n00:08:34.286 --> 00:08:36.270\nwe install our hypervisor, right?\n\n149\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.380\nWhatever that type two\nhypervisor's gonna be.\n\n150\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.980\nIt runs as an application.\n\n151\n00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.110\nWell, what Microsoft did to make it\neasier, right, is to give us that\n\n152\n00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:48.060\nability to go and install that operating\nsystem and turn that role feature on, but\n\n153\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.650\ninstead during that installation process,\nthis has the ability to slide\n\n154\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.960\nthe hypervisor, where Microsoft slips\nit underneath the operating system so\n\n155\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.260\nthat now the host operating system is\nnow running actually as a host, or\n\n156\n00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.000\nwhat we call a parent partition\nas a guest VM in there.\n\n157\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.480\nSo it's a really slick process because in\nother type one hypervisors which we're\n\n158\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.570\nalso gonna seeing in the series, we're\ngoing to see that we actually have to\n\n159\n00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.700\ninstall the hypervisor first\nbefore we install anything else.\n\n160\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.150\nBut now, if you already know how to\ninstall something like the base operating\n\n161\n00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.140\nsystem, it makes it very\neasy to run hypervisor.\n\n162\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.970\n>> Absolutely,\nit's just very simple to do.\n\n163\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.010\nAnd it is a little bit of a twisty\nconcept to think that my,\n\n164\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.740\nthe operating system that\nI'm logging into, right,\n\n165\n00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.010\nmy desktop and all of that, is actually\nvirtualized as this point, right?\n\n166\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.380\nEven though it's not showing up\nas a virtual machine in here,\n\n167\n00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.250\nit is now a parent operating system, and\n\n168\n00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:45.120\nit really is a virtual machine\nrunning on top of that hypervisor.\n\n169\n00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.720\nAnd when you think about this Hyper-V\nmanager, it's not an application, right?\n\n170\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.452\nThis is just a console to allow me to\naccess virtual machines that I'm running.\n\n171\n00:09:54.452 --> 00:09:58.760\nThis isn't, if I close this,\nany virtual machine, oh sorry,\n\n172\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.540\nyou guys can't see that.\n\n173\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.440\nLet me bring that back up.\n\n174\n00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.130\nThis is, again,\njust my management console.\n\n175\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.200\nIf I close this, virtual machines\nthat I had started or were created or\n\n176\n00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.460\nrunning, they're still running, right?\n\n177\n00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.550\nThey're running more like,\n\n178\n00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.930\nagain, more like you would think\nof a service in the background.\n\n179\n00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.745\nAnd I just need a tool to get in there,\nand manage them, all right?\n\n180\n00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:20.600\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n181\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.730\nSo let's take a look at some of the\nbasics, once you get Hyper-V installed,\n\n182\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.010\nthere are a few things that you're gonna\nwanna look at before you dive into\n\n183\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.140\ncreating your virtual machines.\n\n184\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.750\nAnd so I'm gonna open up the Hyper-V\nsettings over here on the right hand side.\n\n185\n00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:41.050\nI've got some, these again, are settings\nfor the Hyper-V server itself, all right?\n\n186\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:46.850\nAnd a few things I know I like to\nchange is the default locations for\n\n187\n00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.760\nmy virtual hard drives as well as\nthe virtual machines themselves.\n\n188\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.080\nRemember it kinda gets split up, just like\nit did in the type two that we looked at\n\n189\n00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.840\nwith VirtualBox, there's really\ntwo parts to a virtual machine.\n\n190\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.360\nYou've got the virtual\nmachine configuration and\n\n191\n00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.790\nthen you've got the virtual hard drives.\n\n192\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.530\nThe hard drives are where\nthe operating system gets installed,\n\n193\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.840\nall the data resides,\ndrivers and things like that.\n\n194\n00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.920\nThe configuration file is\ninformation about the machine.\n\n195\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.090\nHow much RAM I've assigned to that\nvirtual machine, how much hard drives or\n\n196\n00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.320\nwhat hard drives are attached,\nwhat connection methods,\n\n197\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.550\nif I've added serial ATA or\nparallel ATA CD-ROM drive,\n\n198\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.560\nwhat processors, all of that\nresides in that configuration file.\n\n199\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.550\nAnd you can see with Hyper-V,\nit kind of splits it up.\n\n200\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.740\nWe can store them by default,\nit puts them in two different locations.\n\n201\n00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.196\nThe virtual hard drives\nby default going to\n\n202\n00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:42.830\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Hyper-V\\Virtual\nHard Disks, right, and\n\n203\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:48.270\nthat's the location that anybody that logs\non to this machine would have access to.\n\n204\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.948\nThe configurations, the actual\nvirtual machine configuration files,\n\n205\n00:11:52.948 --> 00:11:57.670\ngo into\nC:\\ProgramData Microsoft\\Windows\\Hyper-V.\n\n206\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.300\nThese files don't\ntypically get very large.\n\n207\n00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.610\nI'm still not a big fan of\nputting them on to C Drive.\n\n208\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.360\nAnd I definitely don't want my\nvirtual hard drives on that C Drive.\n\n209\n00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.750\nSo, in the real world,\nI would have a second or\n\n210\n00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.850\nthird hard drive installed\non this physical server, and\n\n211\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:21.090\nI would change this location to\npoint to those other drives.\n\n212\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.510\nI'm gonna change them anyway,\n\n213\n00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.440\nwhat I'm gonna do is make it a little\nbit easier for us to work with.\n\n214\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.040\nI'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna create a new folder.\n\n215\n00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.990\nMaybe, if the windows will let me.\n\n216\n00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.900\nAnd I'm gonna call this one Hyper-V, and\n\n217\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:44.238\nthen inside there,\nI'm gonna create another folder called,\n\n218\n00:12:44.238 --> 00:12:49.240\nI'll call it drives, all right?\n\n219\n00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.300\nAnd now I'm gonna go back over there to\nmy settings, and I'm gonna change this.\n\n220\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.490\nFor the virtual machines, I'm gonna browse\nand find that folder that I just created.\n\n221\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.194\nSo C:\\Hyper-V, and\nthen select that folder.\n\n222\n00:13:03.194 --> 00:13:08.498\nAnd then for my virtual hard disks,\nI'm gonna change that,\n\n223\n00:13:08.498 --> 00:13:14.331\nto that C:\\Hyper-V\\Drives,\nand I'll click select folder.\n\n224\n00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:17.238\nNow as you're making theses\nchanges to the configuration,\n\n225\n00:13:17.238 --> 00:13:19.100\nyou notice they turn blue over here?\n\n226\n00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.950\nHopefully you can see that on screen.\n\n227\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.100\nThat's letting me know that\nI've made changes, but\n\n228\n00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.520\nthey haven't been applied yet,\nthey haven't been committed.\n\n229\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.930\nI can either click okay if I'm done making\nchanges, or I can click apply to have\n\n230\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:35.750\nthose changes applied, and then go back\nand create or make additional changes.\n\n231\n00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.380\nNow, those default settings that\nwe've created there or where I\n\n232\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.300\nchanged those pads as I create new VMs,\nthat is where it's gonna be default to.\n\n233\n00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.700\nBut I'm not stuck with it, if I want\nto make a new virtual machine and\n\n234\n00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.420\nput it in a completely different location,\nmore than welcome to do that, right?\n\n235\n00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.060\nAs I go through the wizard\nto create new VM,\n\n236\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.300\nit's gonna ask me where I wanna keep\nthe files associated with the VM.\n\n237\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.780\nIt will default to these\nlocations that I'd just set,\n\n238\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.410\nbut I'm free to change\nthat to whatever I want.\n\n239\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.410\n>> Now Mike,\nyou've made two separate folders,\n\n240\n00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.420\none for that configuration file and\none for the drives.\n\n241\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.846\nIs that absolutely necessary or\nis it just something you like to do?\n\n242\n00:14:12.846 --> 00:14:13.916\n>> It's something that I like to do.\n\n243\n00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:14.866\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:15.997\n>> Honestly, for\n\n245\n00:14:15.997 --> 00:14:19.480\nme I kinda like to\norganize them like that.\n\n246\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.100\nA lot of people would rather make\nindividual folders for each machine,\n\n247\n00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.990\nand then in each machine configuration\nfile and drives might get stored in there,\n\n248\n00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.890\nand you'll see that Hyper-V does\nsome funky things sometimes.\n\n249\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.880\nIt can duplicate or\nit can double up on some of my paths,\n\n250\n00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.690\nI'll show you what I mean\nwhen I create some of these.\n\n251\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.240\nSo something that you're\ngotta play around with, and\n\n252\n00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.640\nwhatever you're comfortable with,\nlike I said, one nice thing about putting\n\n253\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.040\nthe configuration in the drives and\nits own folder is the fact that\n\n254\n00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.180\nwhen it comes to moving them or backing\nthem up or something like that, it can\n\n255\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.490\nbecome a little bit easier to back up an\nindividual machine if you do it that way.\n\n256\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.810\nAwesome, all right, now couple other\nthings that we should be familiar with.\n\n257\n00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.580\nIf you're gonna be doing\nanything really fancy,\n\n258\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.750\nlike remote desktop virtualization you\nmight wanna make, if your physical machine\n\n259\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:17.260\nhas a GPU that supports remote effects,\nyou can turn that on in here.\n\n260\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.110\nThe others I don't think\nwould worry about just yet,\n\n261\n00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.850\nthose are a little more\nadvance options right now.\n\n262\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.710\nWe just wanna get familiar\nwith Hyper-V itself, so\n\n263\n00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.510\nwe're not gonna go into live migrations,\nor storage migrations.\n\n264\n00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.830\nA couple of settings down here though\nthat we did see, on those type twos,\n\n265\n00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.040\nwe saw them in VirtualBox,\nsame stuff available here.\n\n266\n00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.420\nKeyboard shortcuts, what's gonna happen?\n\n267\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.280\nIf I'm logged into this machine, but if I\nhave one of the virtual machines up and\n\n268\n00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.790\nrunning and visible on my screen,\nwhere do my keyboard shortcuts go?\n\n269\n00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:50.384\nIf I do an Alt + Tab, is that gonna\nbe fired to the operating system in\n\n270\n00:15:50.384 --> 00:15:54.271\nthe virtual machine or\nto that parent operating system?\n\n271\n00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:56.963\nYou see the default is to\nuse on the virtual machines.\n\n272\n00:15:56.963 --> 00:15:58.513\nSo if that window has focus,\n\n273\n00:15:58.513 --> 00:16:02.840\nand I do an Alt + Tab, The Alt+Tab will\nbe send to the virtual machine itself and\n\n274\n00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.570\nI'll flip through applications\nin the virtual machine.\n\n275\n00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.140\nIf I choose the physical computer,\n\n276\n00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.090\nthen Alt+Tab would flip through\napplications on my physical machine, or I\n\n277\n00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:16.180\ncan say only do it in the virtual machine\nif it's running full screen, right?\n\n278\n00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.800\nIf I got a full screen, then yes,\n\n279\n00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.820\nI want the keyboard shortcuts\nto go to the virtual machine.\n\n280\n00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.840\nIf it's not full screen, then I want my\nkeyboard shortcuts to go to the parent OS,\n\n281\n00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.840\neven if one of the virtual machines\nis the active window, right?\n\n282\n00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.390\nI'll leave it on the default there for\nnow.\n\n283\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.410\nI've also got that mouse release key.\n\n284\n00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:39.295\nRemember, for installing an operating\nsystem that doesn't have the guest\n\n285\n00:16:39.295 --> 00:16:44.120\nintegration tools installed or integration\nservices, or hasn't been configured yet,\n\n286\n00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.150\nI can end up getting my mouse stuck,\nif you will, inside that virtual machine.\n\n287\n00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.770\nI've seen this happen, it happens all\nthe time when you're installing that\n\n288\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.980\noperating system, you click inside\nthe window for that virtual machine.\n\n289\n00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.570\nAnd then when you go to move your\nmouse it's stuck, and I can't get out.\n\n290\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.920\nThe default is Ctrl+Alt+Left Arrow.\n\n291\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.660\nI could change that to one\nof these other options here.\n\n292\n00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.520\nI'll leave the default.\n\n293\n00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.248\nWe can also do reset check boxes,\n\n294\n00:17:09.248 --> 00:17:12.889\nthere's another one I'd like to show\nwhen we're first learning HyperV-.\n\n295\n00:17:12.889 --> 00:17:17.673\nYou know how Microsoft is, they love the\npop up dialog boxes that warn you about\n\n296\n00:17:17.673 --> 00:17:20.150\nthings or inform you about things.\n\n297\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.710\nMost of them have a check mark that says,\ndon't show this message again.\n\n298\n00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.840\nWell, if you want all those to come back,\nif somebody has gone through and\n\n299\n00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.020\nchecked all those,\nyou're not gonna see any of them.\n\n300\n00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.360\nIf you're learning Hyper-V,\nyou might wanna see those messages again.\n\n301\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.700\nI can come click here on reset and\nthat will reset all those check marks so\n\n302\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.950\nthat they're no longer selected and\n\n303\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:44.611\nnow all of those dialog boxes\nwill pop up all over again.\n\n304\n00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.920\nFor the most part, those are the setting\nthat we deal with, with Hyper-V and\n\n305\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.880\nnow we've got our Hyper-V installed,\nwe've got our base configuration done to\n\n306\n00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.970\nthe Hyper-V console itself, and it's just\nabout time to start creating machines.\n\n307\n00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.420\n>> All right, Mike, so\nif we want to start creating a machine,\n\n308\n00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.170\nwhat are some of the considerations\nthat we have to think about\n\n309\n00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.700\nwhen we actually start building them?\n\n310\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.740\nI know there are some hardware limitations\nthat we've got to worry about.\n\n311\n00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.180\nBut it's actually good for\nus to make sure that we understand that.\n\n312\n00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.260\n>> It is, the first thing you've gotta\nworry about is the, as Ronnie said,\n\n313\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.990\nthe specifications, right?\n\n314\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.650\nAnd Server 2012 R2 is\nactually pretty light.\n\n315\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.550\nWe're talking, they recommend\n512 as the minimum requirements,\n\n316\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.805\n512 megabytes of RAM,\nrandom access memory.\n\n317\n00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:31.470\n[LAUGH] Right now.\n\n318\n00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.360\nI will tell you that I've never\ntried to do that with a server.\n\n319\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.540\nI shouldn't say I never have.\n\n320\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:40.450\nI have done it in some virtual machines,\nbut that's not gonna do us any good.\n\n321\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.340\nRemember the way virtualization works.\n\n322\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.970\nYou've got your parent\nOS in this type one, and\n\n323\n00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.140\nyou've got your physical hardware.\n\n324\n00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.350\nAnd you have to divide the resources\nup amongst that parent OS and\n\n325\n00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.260\nall the virtuals that you're creating.\n\n326\n00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.030\nSo, if I have a physical\nmachine that has 512MB of RAM,\n\n327\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.260\nI might be able to get Server 2012\ninstalled and install the Hyper-V role.\n\n328\n00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.850\nI'm not gonna be creating\nany virtual machines,\n\n329\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:08.740\nthere's no memory left to give to\nthe virtual machines themselves, right?\n\n330\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:13.060\nSo, while 512 is\nthe minimum requirement for\n\n331\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:18.080\ninstalling Server 2012 R2, it's not gonna\nwork if I'm setting up a Hyper-V server.\n\n332\n00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.670\nI've gotta have enough resources to\ngive to the parent operating system,\n\n333\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.640\nthe one that's installed on the physical\nmachine, as well as the virtual.\n\n334\n00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.570\nSo, that's up to you, right?\n\n335\n00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.740\nHow many do you plan on\nrunning on this machine?\n\n336\n00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.910\nOr it might be the other way around.\n\n337\n00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.140\nYour physical memory might limit\nhow many you can create, right?\n\n338\n00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.560\nBut that's something\nyou've got to think about.\n\n339\n00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.860\nSo if you're installing 2012 R2, well\nthere's 512 megs at least that I need.\n\n340\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.638\nAnd then if I want to install 2012 R2 in\na virtual machine to create a virtual\n\n341\n00:19:46.638 --> 00:19:48.860\nserver, there's another 512.\n\n342\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.553\nSo I just start adding this up and\n\n343\n00:19:50.553 --> 00:19:54.780\nthat's going to tell me how much\nRAM I need in that physical machine.\n\n344\n00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.460\nSame thing when it comes\nto hard drive space.\n\n345\n00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.950\n32 GB is the minimum for\ninstalling Server 2012 R2.\n\n346\n00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:06.470\nSo if I'm gonna, my parent\noperating system, that needs 32 GB.\n\n347\n00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.250\nIf I go to create a virtual machine,\nI'm gonna need to get a virtual hard drive\n\n348\n00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.240\nthat's at least 32 gigabytes in size,\nright?\n\n349\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.390\nAnd Ronnie, you and I both know that\nthose minimum requirements are just that.\n\n350\n00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.100\nThat'll get it installed, but\nit's really not gonna help you do much.\n\n351\n00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.800\nI mean if you install a service pack or\n\n352\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.550\na few updates,\nyou're gonna go beyond that 32 gigs.\n\n353\n00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.450\n>> There's no doubt that\nwhat we have to realize,\n\n354\n00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.400\nright, is that we have to understand\nthat when we create virtual machines,\n\n355\n00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.730\nthat we can't just say, all right.\n\n356\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.000\nI've got Server 2012\nrunning on that machine,\n\n357\n00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.950\nI've got Hyper-V installed We also have to\nhave enough resources for the number of\n\n358\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.050\nvirtual machines that we have, and then we\nhave to part that out between that parent\n\n359\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:48.150\npartition as well as all of those child\npartitions or child VMs that we have.\n\n360\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.010\nIt's very easy to overlook, especially\nif this is your first time doing it.\n\n361\n00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:54.600\nAnd it's also very easy to\nover-allocate if you're not careful,\n\n362\n00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.650\nso you do want to be careful of that.\n\n363\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:01.270\nIt also depends, of course, on how many\nyou're choosing to run at any one time.\n\n364\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.200\nSo just kind of be aware when\nyou start looking at it.\n\n365\n00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.770\nSo remember that every parent partition\nthen has to have its requirements, and\n\n366\n00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.750\nthen every child VM as well.\n\n367\n00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:13.680\nAnd so you'll see that different operating\nsystems will require different ones too.\n\n368\n00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.520\nThe nice thing about it is, Mike,\n\n369\n00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.490\nis that we can actually install whatever\noperating system that we want, just about.\n\n370\n00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:19.540\n>> Just about, right.\n\n371\n00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.440\nLet's take a look at that list here.\n\n372\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.400\nBecause once we've got our\nphysical resources allocated,\n\n373\n00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.560\nwe've got a machine that has enough RAM,\nthat has enough hard drive space,\n\n374\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.390\ngot enough processing power to\ninstall Hyper-V and create our VMs.\n\n375\n00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:35.310\nWe start creating the VMs,\n\n376\n00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.885\nwhat operating system are we installing in\nthe virtual machines that we're creating?\n\n377\n00:21:38.885 --> 00:21:41.270\nHyper-V is pretty flexible.\n\n378\n00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.630\nI've got a list here, when it comes\nto Windows operating systems,\n\n379\n00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:49.560\nwe can really go all the way back\nto Windows XP and Server 2003.\n\n380\n00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:55.007\nSo if I need a Server 2003 machine\nbecause I've got some application\n\n381\n00:21:55.007 --> 00:22:01.971\nthat won't run on 2008, or 2012,\nwell I can take my 2012 R2 Hyper-V server,\n\n382\n00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:06.368\nand I can create a new VM\nthat's running 2003 server.\n\n383\n00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:08.562\nAll right, I can't go any further back.\n\n384\n00:22:08.562 --> 00:22:14.970\nI can't get to Windows 2000 server or\nWindows 2000, or Windows 95, 98.\n\n385\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.329\nNot supported anyway.\n\n386\n00:22:16.329 --> 00:22:21.770\nI've actually gone and put 95 in a virtual\nmachine, but not going to be supported.\n\n387\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.240\nThere's others though, outside of Windows.\n\n388\n00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.580\nWindows isn't the only operating system.\n\n389\n00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.760\nWe might want to play with some or\nneed some Linux machines.\n\n390\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:37.810\nMaybe our web developers, they prefer\nLinux as their web server of choice.\n\n391\n00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:42.110\nWell I can do that, I can take my\nServer 2012 R Hyper-V Server, and\n\n392\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:47.410\nI can install CentOS or Debian or\nOracle or Suse or Ubuntu.\n\n393\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.290\nYou can see the list there, FreeBSD.\n\n394\n00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.390\nSo, quite a few variants\nof Linux would be allowed.\n\n395\n00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.790\nAnd again, these are supported,\nyou might find\n\n396\n00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.810\nthat you can take one that's not on this\nlist, and install it, and it might work.\n\n397\n00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.755\nIt's just no guarantees, these operating\nsystems they're saying will run,\n\n398\n00:23:05.755 --> 00:23:10.940\nHyper-V is designed to support\nthese operating systems.\n\n399\n00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.630\nIf you try anything else,\nit might or might not work.\n\n400\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.940\nUse it at your own risk.\n\n401\n00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.620\nAll right,\nit's kinda the way they look at it.\n\n402\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.380\n>> All right, Mike.\n\n403\n00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.010\nSo it sounds like that what we have in\n\n404\n00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.630\nplace is everything that we need to\nto begin to create a virtual machine.\n\n405\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.565\nSo Mike, what are we actually gonna\ncreate as a virtual machine now?\n\n406\n00:23:26.565 --> 00:23:29.285\n>> Well, I tell you, there is one\nmore thing that I kinda wanna go into\n\n407\n00:23:29.285 --> 00:23:32.925\nyou before we go to create the VMs and\nthat's networking.\n\n408\n00:23:32.925 --> 00:23:35.825\nBecause we're gonna wanna network\nthese machines, most likely.\n\n409\n00:23:35.825 --> 00:23:37.610\nYou might have a test environment that,\n\n410\n00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.087\nwhere the machine is\nisolated from everything.\n\n411\n00:23:40.087 --> 00:23:44.107\nAnd you don't need any networking at all,\nbut most likely if this is your production\n\n412\n00:23:44.107 --> 00:23:47.207\nenvironment, obviously it's\ngonna need connectivity.\n\n413\n00:23:47.207 --> 00:23:51.567\nIf your web developers need to access\nthose web servers for testing or\n\n414\n00:23:51.567 --> 00:23:54.527\nif that's your production web server,\nwe're gonna need connectivity.\n\n415\n00:23:54.527 --> 00:23:56.403\nSo that's something that\nwe're gonna have to do.\n\n416\n00:23:56.403 --> 00:24:02.147\nSo let me flip over to, where is my,\nthere we go, back over to Hyper-V.\n\n417\n00:24:02.147 --> 00:24:04.846\nAnd take a look at some of\nthe networking settings.\n\n418\n00:24:04.846 --> 00:24:08.882\nTo do the networking in Hyper-V,\nover here in my actions pane,\n\n419\n00:24:08.882 --> 00:24:11.510\nI have my virtual switch manager.\n\n420\n00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.980\nAnd really what you're doing is\nyou're creating a virtual switch,\n\n421\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.280\nsomething to plug your\nvirtual machines into.\n\n422\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.560\nNow that virtual switch that you create,\n\n423\n00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.520\nthere's three options I can use\nwhen I create that virtual switch.\n\n424\n00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.630\nYou can see my list here.\n\n425\n00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.360\nI've got new virtual switch\nselected over here on the left.\n\n426\n00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.130\nAnd then what type of virtual\nswitch do I want to create?\n\n427\n00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.160\nI've got external, internal, and private.\n\n428\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.470\nExternal is gonna give me\naccess to the physical network.\n\n429\n00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:49.270\nSo if I connect a virtual machine to\nthis external virtual switch, it's gonna\n\n430\n00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.290\nbe able to see other virtual machines\nthat are connected to that switch.\n\n431\n00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.970\nIt's gonna be able to see\nthe host operating system.\n\n432\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:00.664\nAs well as anything else on the physical\nnetwork that that host machine is\n\n433\n00:25:00.664 --> 00:25:01.462\nconnected to.\n\n434\n00:25:01.462 --> 00:25:04.509\nSo if that host machine has\ninternet access, then so\n\n435\n00:25:04.509 --> 00:25:08.910\nwill my virtual machine that's\nconnected to that external switch.\n\n436\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.340\nIf I'm running DHCP on the external\nnetwork, on the physical network,\n\n437\n00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.390\nmy VMs can now pick up an IP\naddress from that DHCP server.\n\n438\n00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:21.910\nThey could use a DNS server that's\nlocated on the physical network.\n\n439\n00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.830\nSo it's just like the virtual\nmachine was plugged in\n\n440\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.830\nto that switch in your server closet.\n\n441\n00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.140\nJust like any other machine.\n\n442\n00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.070\nI'd have to give it an IP address,\nor have it obtain an IP address,\n\n443\n00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.950\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n444\n00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:38.140\nAlso means that I've got to protect\nthat machine a little bit better\n\n445\n00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.260\nthan I might with some of my other\noptions because it has internet access.\n\n446\n00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.519\nI need to be doing my, and\nwe need to do these anyway, but\n\n447\n00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:48.300\nI've really gotta worry about updates,\nrunning anti virus software and\n\n448\n00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.240\nthings like that and protecting it\nfrom other people in the network.\n\n449\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.010\nCuz anybody that comes in and\nplugs into that network,\n\n450\n00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.176\nthe physical network,\nwould be able to see that virtual machine.\n\n451\n00:25:57.176 --> 00:26:00.870\nSo if they were trying to do something\nmalicious, they can see that machine.\n\n452\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.000\nNext option down is my internal network.\n\n453\n00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.360\nAnd what this is gonna do is\nanything that's plugged into the.\n\n454\n00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.800\nIf I create a virtual internal switch,\nand I plug a VM into that switch,\n\n455\n00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.480\nit will be able to talk to any other\nvirtual machines that are plugged into\n\n456\n00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:23.690\nthat same internal switch, as well as\nthe host or the parent operating system.\n\n457\n00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:24.540\nBut that's it.\n\n458\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.350\nThat's where it stops.\n\n459\n00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.400\nSo the switch would be, it would, again,\ngive access to other virtual machines that\n\n460\n00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.080\nplugged into the same switch, and\nthe host OS, and nothing more.\n\n461\n00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.520\nNo access beyond that physical server.\n\n462\n00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.670\nSo you could have multiple VMs\nattached to that switch and\n\n463\n00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.740\nthey could talk to each other.\n\n464\n00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.480\nThey could even talk to the host\noperating system, but that's it.\n\n465\n00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.450\nNo Internet access, no access to external\nresources on the physical network.\n\n466\n00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.865\nThen you've got private, and\nprivate is the most limited switch of all.\n\n467\n00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:59.480\nThis, any virtual machine\nthat's connected to that\n\n468\n00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.250\nprivate switch will be able to\ntalk to any other virtual machine\n\n469\n00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.380\nthat's connected to that same\nprivate switch and that's it.\n\n470\n00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.750\nNot even the host operating system.\n\n471\n00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.270\nNow keep in mind when I\nsay not even the host or\n\n472\n00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:16.410\nthe parent OS, yes,\nI can still log into the parent OS, and\n\n473\n00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:21.930\nI can still manage my virtual\nmachines through hyperview manager.\n\n474\n00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.690\nBut when it comes to the Windows\noperating system and\n\n475\n00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:28.030\ntrying to connect to a share maybe\nthat was located on the parent OS.\n\n476\n00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.150\nIt's not gonna happen.\n\n477\n00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.450\nIt's like they're in their\nown little subnet and\n\n478\n00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.740\nthey can't talk to anybody else.\n\n479\n00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.280\nAnd so which one do you choose?\n\n480\n00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.710\nWell, depends on what your needs are for\nyour virtual machine.\n\n481\n00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:43.540\nAre these virtual machines you're creating\ngonna provide services to the network,\n\n482\n00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.710\nlike DNS or DHCP?\n\n483\n00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.680\nWell then it would need connections\nto the physical network.\n\n484\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.540\nYou'd need that external switch.\n\n485\n00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.560\nIf this is my test environment, and I\nwanna keep it completely isolated from my\n\n486\n00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.320\nphysical environment because\nI'm duplicating names and\n\n487\n00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:03.265\nduplicating IP addresses, so I can test\nthings in a copy of my physical network.\n\n488\n00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:05.425\nI've gotta make sure that\nthey can't connect, and\n\n489\n00:28:05.425 --> 00:28:07.325\nI don't what any duplication errors.\n\n490\n00:28:07.325 --> 00:28:09.105\nSo I would use that internal, most likely,\n\n491\n00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:13.445\nto make sure it's completely isolated\nfrom anything on my physical network.\n\n492\n00:28:13.445 --> 00:28:15.465\nSo it's all about what you need.\n\n493\n00:28:15.465 --> 00:28:18.565\nAnd then one more thing I do wanna\nmention, when you create internals and\n\n494\n00:28:18.565 --> 00:28:21.200\nprivates, you can create as\nmany of these as you need.\n\n495\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.740\nSo I can create an internal network for\nthis test environment and a private\n\n496\n00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.210\nnetwork for another test environment and\na separate internal network for\n\n497\n00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.760\nmy developers test environment or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n498\n00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.920\nI can create as many of those as I want.\n\n499\n00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.300\nThe external, I can create one\nper physical network adapter.\n\n500\n00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:45.030\nCuz the external switch gets bound\nto the physical network adapter.\n\n501\n00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.060\nSo that I can get access\nto the physical network.\n\n502\n00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:52.310\nSo you can only create\none per network adapter.\n\n503\n00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.960\nTwo, second thing I wanna mention,\nwhen you do create that external virtual\n\n504\n00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.300\nswitch, you will lose connectivity to\nthe host or parent operating system\n\n505\n00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.820\ntemporarily because it's gotta bind\nto that physical network adapter.\n\n506\n00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.960\nIt basically has to disable and\nre enable the physical nyetwork adapter.\n\n507\n00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.130\nSo just something to keep in mind,\nif that machine was doing other things on\n\n508\n00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.180\nthe network,\npeople are gonna lose connectivity to it.\n\n509\n00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.470\nIf you're remoted into it like I am.\n\n510\n00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.020\nIf I go and\n\n511\n00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.937\ncreate this external virtual switch,\nI would lose my remote desktop connection.\n\n512\n00:29:20.937 --> 00:29:21.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's gonna,\n\n513\n00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.205\nagain, reset that network adapter.\n\n514\n00:29:24.205 --> 00:29:26.390\nSo something to think about.\n\n515\n00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.070\nMost of the time in the real world,\nbest practice is\n\n516\n00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:33.940\nhave at least two network adapters in your\nHyper-V server and that physical machine.\n\n517\n00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.830\nYou want one that I can\nattach my VMs to and\n\n518\n00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.000\nthey can get Internet\naccess if I need them to.\n\n519\n00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.318\nI want a separate network adapter for\nmanagement purposes so I can always\n\n520\n00:29:44.318 --> 00:29:49.298\nconnect to it and my bandwidth will not be\naffected by whatever the VM\"s are doing.\n\n521\n00:29:49.298 --> 00:29:52.119\nI can still connect to\nthat Hyper-V server and\n\n522\n00:29:52.119 --> 00:29:55.830\ndo my management tasks over\nthat separate network adapter.\n\n523\n00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:00.620\nSo not too bad getting that Hyper-V server\nconfigured, just a few basic things.\n\n524\n00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.714\nCheck your default path,\nmaybe they're fine for you.\n\n525\n00:30:02.714 --> 00:30:04.118\nMaybe you wanna change those.\n\n526\n00:30:04.118 --> 00:30:09.820\nAnd then set up your virtual switches\nto support your connectivity.\n\n527\n00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.560\nNow, Ronnie, you really\n\n528\n00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.300\ncan do the switches after\ncreate the virtual machines.\n\n529\n00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.800\nI prefer to do it ahead of time,\nso that way when I go and\n\n530\n00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.320\ncreate the virtual machines.\n\n531\n00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.770\nThe networks are there to pick from.\n\n532\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.650\nAnd in a future episode,\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n533\n00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.990\nAs you go through creating a VM, you get\nto pick what virtual network adapter or\n\n534\n00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.270\nvirtual switch you wanna\nconnect that VM to.\n\n535\n00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.330\n>> All right, Mike.\n\n536\n00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.170\nEven though,\nI'd asked you about creating a VM.\n\n537\n00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.250\nIt looks like that we are out of time,\nand that means.\n\n538\n00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.420\n>> I learned from you, I talk too much.\n\n539\n00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:35.920\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n540\n00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.610\n>> And what that means is you'd like to\n\n541\n00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.220\ncome back and actually show us how\nto create one in Hyper-V, as well.\n\n542\n00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.480\nWell, take a look at this episode\nagain as you go back through.\n\n543\n00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.760\nRemember that what we saw here is\nthat we saw the very beginning of\n\n544\n00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.530\ntaking a look at Microsoft's Hyper-V\ninside a virtual server.\n\n545\n00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.560\nWe've talked about the basic requirements.\n\n546\n00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.340\nIf you can actually get it installed using\nthe minimum hardware requirements on that\n\n547\n00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.770\nmachine for Windows Server 2012,\n\n548\n00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:04.220\nyou'll probably also be able to install\nHyper-V, but that's not enough.\n\n549\n00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.430\nThe very fact is, if were gonna\nbe creating virtual machines,\n\n550\n00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:09.990\nit also means we need to consider\nthe requirements, of course, for each and\n\n551\n00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.850\nevery VM that we create.\n\n552\n00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.410\nNow, the episode also showed us here,\nat least what Mike did, is he showed us\n\n553\n00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:21.200\nthe basic configuration after we\nactually get Hyper-V installed there.\n\n554\n00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.640\nAnd some of the things we wanna consider\nbefore we even create our very first\n\n555\n00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.770\nvirtual machine.\n\n556\n00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:30.371\nSuch as being able to relocate the path\nof where those virtual machines are gonna\n\n557\n00:31:30.371 --> 00:31:31.020\nbe stored.\n\n558\n00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.490\nAnd also some of those other configuration\nsettings that we saw, as well.\n\n559\n00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.540\nAnd then of course, the network adapters.\n\n560\n00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.030\nBeing able to pick and\nchoose what you need.\n\n561\n00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.020\nOne of the more confusing things about,\nof course,\n\n562\n00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.090\nvirtualization, is understanding\nthat we're working with software.\n\n563\n00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.400\nAnd then choosing the right\nnetwork adapter that we need to.\n\n564\n00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.060\nAnd so\nwe also saw that in this episode as well.\n\n565\n00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.792\nBut Mike, you're gonna come back and\nhelp us in another episode here,\n\n566\n00:31:51.792 --> 00:31:55.833\nas we create more virtual machines and\nthen show how to get them also ready to be\n\n567\n00:31:55.833 --> 00:31:58.338\nused in the environment that we want,\nas well.\n\n568\n00:31:58.338 --> 00:31:59.070\n>> Absolutely.\n\n569\n00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.694\n>> So signing off for ITProTV.\n\n570\n00:32:01.694 --> 00:32:03.376\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n571\n00:32:03.376 --> 00:32:04.479\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n572\n00:32:04.479

00:00:17.296\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:17.296 --> 00:00:21.993\ntoday, we're gonna be taking a look at\nvirtualization technology or specifically\n\n5\n00:00:21.993 --> 00:00:26.571\nhave me diving back into Microsoft Hyper-V\nrunning on Windows server 2012.\n\n6\n00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:30.391\nIn the previous episode, we already\ntalked about the basic configurations.\n\n7\n00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:34.469\nAnd now, we're actually gonna get started\nand take a look at what it takes for\n\n8\n00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.810\nus to go ahead and\ncreate a virtual machine.\n\n9\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.051\nWho better to help us than Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:42.004\nNow Mike, even though we've\nactually got the basics created,\n\n11\n00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.737\nthere's still a lot more for us to do\nbefore that virtual machine's ready to go.\n\n12\n00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:46.608\n>> There really is.\n\n13\n00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:50.282\nIt's gonna be similar to what we saw\nwith that type two when we looked at\n\n14\n00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:54.916\nVirtual Box, but there are some additional\nsettings that we can deal with in Hyper-V.\n\n15\n00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:58.343\nAnd so I want to go through the process\nof creating a virtual machine and\n\n16\n00:00:58.343 --> 00:01:01.830\nthen configuring the settings\nassociated with that virtual machine,\n\n17\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.710\ncuz you can use the default settings.\n\n18\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.437\nYou can just run through the wizard very\nquickly, create a default virtual machine.\n\n19\n00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:10.878\nAnd if it's a sandbox environment or\ntesting are something like that,\n\n20\n00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:12.034\nthat might be perfect.\n\n21\n00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:15.652\nBut most of the time,\nyou're gonna wanna go back in and\n\n22\n00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:18.651\ndo some additional\nconfiguration to the VM.\n\n23\n00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:21.378\nSo that's what I wanted to show you, some\nof the different options available there.\n\n24\n00:01:21.378 --> 00:01:23.515\n>> Now Mike,\nI think you bring up a really good point.\n\n25\n00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:27.360\nIn a regular testing environment,\ngetting the defaults, in other words,\n\n26\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.543\ngetting started is pretty much\nthe thing that we want to do, but\n\n27\n00:01:30.543 --> 00:01:33.083\nthen we have to go back and\nchange those settings.\n\n28\n00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:35.916\nIf we're actually working in\na production environment,\n\n29\n00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:39.958\nit really does actually benefit us to slow\ndown in that process, to make sure that we\n\n30\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.944\nset that thing up the way that we need to\ninstead of actually building everything,\n\n31\n00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:47.354\ngetting that operating system installed\nand then having to go back and\n\n32\n00:01:47.354 --> 00:01:49.783\ngo, oh, yeah,\nI need to change all this stuff.\n\n33\n00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:53.345\nSo, slowing down in the process,\nespecially with something as technically\n\n34\n00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:57.097\ndetailed as Hyper-V is really something\nwe should actually take the time to do.\n\n35\n00:01:57.097 --> 00:01:57.851\n>> Absolutely.\n\n36\n00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:02.971\nSo let's dive in and take a look at it,\nwe'll create our first VM using Hyper-V.\n\n37\n00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:07.255\nAnd of course, with Microsoft, it's wizard\ndriven if I'm going to this console.\n\n38\n00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:11.469\nThere are power show commands that you\ncan use to create these virtual machines.\n\n39\n00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.842\nIf you wanna automate this process,\nif you wanna try to script it out,\n\n40\n00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:19.711\nyou can go out and\nthere's a power shell module for Hyper-V.\n\n41\n00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:22.974\nAnd it exposes all the commands\nthat we will using in the wizard\n\n42\n00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:27.454\nthrough that PowerShell console, so you\ncan script this to your heart's content.\n\n43\n00:02:27.454 --> 00:02:28.014\nAnd heck,\n\n44\n00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:32.016\nyou could write a script that whipped\nout a dozen servers if you needed it to.\n\n45\n00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:34.315\n>> And so Mike, that's not what\nyou're showing us right now.\n\n46\n00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:36.358\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No,\n\n47\n00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:37.229\nwe're not gonna do that right.\n\n48\n00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.804\n>> As we're getting started, maybe Mike,\n\n49\n00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:40.607\nwe should kind of dial it\nback just a little bit.\n\n50\n00:02:40.607 --> 00:02:41.176\n>> Right.\n\n51\n00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:44.032\n>> And start in the simplest,\nbut no, don't get us wrong here.\n\n52\n00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:46.776\nIt's not that we're\nsaying to leave that off.\n\n53\n00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:49.660\nWhat we're saying is right at\nthe beginning If you're actually getting\n\n54\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.542\nstarted here, we wanna show you,\nof course, how you can get started and\n\n55\n00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:53.977\nsome the things that you have to do.\n\n56\n00:02:53.977 --> 00:02:57.827\nThat PowerShell stuff is an awesome stuff\nand it really does save time later on, but\n\n57\n00:02:57.827 --> 00:03:01.632\nthat's something you can learn on growing\nafter you understand the technology.\n\n58\n00:03:01.632 --> 00:03:04.853\nBut right now, Mike, if you're doing\nme I think I might just go, wow,\n\n59\n00:03:04.853 --> 00:03:05.731\nthat's amazing.\n\n60\n00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:07.867\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But not exactly know what to do.\n\n61\n00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:12.097\n>> Yeah, that the PowerShell is helpful\nif you're rolling out many machines,\n\n62\n00:03:12.097 --> 00:03:12.753\nanything.\n\n63\n00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:15.705\nWhen we talk about scripting or\nautomating something,\n\n64\n00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:18.732\nit's because I have to do it over and\nover and over again.\n\n65\n00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:21.205\nAnd I want consistency,\nI want to be able to do it quickly.\n\n66\n00:03:21.205 --> 00:03:25.531\nBut when you're first getting started with\nHyper-V and we're learning about this,\n\n67\n00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:29.679\nwe're in small environments where you're\nonly creating a virtual machine here or\n\n68\n00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.118\nthere every once in a while.\n\n69\n00:03:31.118 --> 00:03:34.032\nHonestly, it's more overhead\nto learn PowerShell and\n\n70\n00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:38.317\nwrite the script than it is to just go\nNext, Next, Next, Next and use the wizard.\n\n71\n00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:40.777\nSo that's what we're gonna\nfocus on here today.\n\n72\n00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:45.375\nSo let's take a look at my screen,\nI've got the Hyper-V console opened up and\n\n73\n00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:48.163\nwe're gonna go over here\nto the Actions pane and\n\n74\n00:03:48.163 --> 00:03:52.717\nI'm gonna click on New Virtual Machine and\nthat's gonna start the process.\n\n75\n00:03:52.717 --> 00:03:55.032\nIt'll launch my handy dandy wizard and\n\n76\n00:03:55.032 --> 00:03:58.821\nit's gonna make me click Next on\nthe little intro screen here and\n\n77\n00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:03.192\nthe first thing I want to know is what's\ngonna be the name of this machine.\n\n78\n00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:07.359\nNow keep in mind, this name is not\nthe name inside the operating system.\n\n79\n00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.952\nThis is the name for the virtual\nmachine in the Hyper-V console, so\n\n80\n00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:14.137\nyou can get creative with this.\n\n81\n00:04:14.137 --> 00:04:17.039\nYou don't have to follow your,\n\n82\n00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.981\nmaybe you've got a naming\nconvention that you use with\n\n83\n00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:27.257\nyour machines like gmv-srv01 or\nsomething like that.\n\n84\n00:04:27.257 --> 00:04:28.620\nYou don't have to do that here,\n\n85\n00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.808\nyou're gonna be able to rename\nthe machine through the operating system.\n\n86\n00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:35.997\nWhat I recommend here is that you get\na little descriptive like this might be\n\n87\n00:04:35.997 --> 00:04:37.860\nsomething I'm gonna call this,\n\n88\n00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.667\nI might include what I plan to name\nthe machine and a little bit more.\n\n89\n00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:47.872\nI might do something like gmv-svr01-\n\n90\n00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:53.021\n2K12R2 something like that.\n\n91\n00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:57.341\nSo, I know what operating system this\nparticular machine is running or\n\n92\n00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:01.600\nI might list out some of the services\nI plan on running on this machine.\n\n93\n00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.633\nSo whatever you want to do, again,\nthis isn't the OS name this is the name of\n\n94\n00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:08.484\nthe virtual machine that'll\nshow up in the console.\n\n95\n00:05:08.484 --> 00:05:10.237\nYou can see down below there.\n\n96\n00:05:10.237 --> 00:05:14.411\nRemember, we change in that previous\nepisode, we changed the default locations,\n\n97\n00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:17.817\nI made a full recall Hyper-V and\nyou can see it has that listed there,\n\n98\n00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:18.790\nit's grayed out.\n\n99\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.634\nIf I wanted to change that and\nI typically do.\n\n100\n00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:22.926\nWell, like I said,\n\n101\n00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:26.878\nI create that base folder like\nwe did in the previous episode,\n\n102\n00:05:26.878 --> 00:05:32.351\nthen what I'm going to do is come in here\nand I'm going to call this gmv-svr01, cuz\n\n103\n00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:38.470\nthat's gonna create that subfolder within\nthat Hyper-V folder for this machine.\n\n104\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.829\nNow if you follow defaults,\n\n105\n00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:43.854\nMicrosoft dumps all the virtual machine\nconfiguration files into a single folder.\n\n106\n00:05:43.854 --> 00:05:46.977\nSo you do not have to create\nsubfolders for each one.\n\n107\n00:05:46.977 --> 00:05:51.714\nI like to do it, just cuz I'm a little bit\nOCD when it comes to things like that.\n\n108\n00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:55.858\nSo we'll go ahead and click Next,\nit does give you a nice warning here.\n\n109\n00:05:55.858 --> 00:05:59.539\nIf you plan on taking checkpoints,\nwhich are like snapshots,\n\n110\n00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.532\nyou're gonna need the disk\nspace to support that.\n\n111\n00:06:02.532 --> 00:06:05.969\nSo make sure this location\nhas enough free disc space.\n\n112\n00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.930\nAnother reason I don't like\nto keep these on the C drive.\n\n113\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.616\nIf this was a production server, I would\ndefinitely have another hard drive in\n\n114\n00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:16.174\nthere to store these virtual machines on.\n\n115\n00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:18.386\nSo we'll go ahead and click Next and\n\n116\n00:06:18.386 --> 00:06:23.140\nthen I've got a choice of either\ngeneration one or generation two.\n\n117\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.603\nImportant decision here,\nbecause I can't change it after the fact.\n\n118\n00:06:27.603 --> 00:06:30.947\nSo that's why,\nas far as which one you choose?\n\n119\n00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:36.588\nWell, generation two adds support for some\nnew features like Windows secure boot.\n\n120\n00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:40.361\nBeing able to check those system\nfiles as that system is booting up.\n\n121\n00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:45.226\nYou can boot to a scuzzy drive,\nyou can do the pixie boot.\n\n122\n00:06:45.226 --> 00:06:50.101\nIt supports that with that\nnetwork adapter with the guest.\n\n123\n00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:54.657\nIt says here, guest operating systems\nmust be running at least 2012,\n\n124\n00:06:54.657 --> 00:06:58.797\nsurf Windows Server 2012,\n64-bit versions of Windows 8.\n\n125\n00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:02.860\nSo if I'm doing anything less than that,\nGeneration 1 is my only choice.\n\n126\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.396\nIf I'm doing 2012 or 64-bit Windows 8 or\nlater, I can choose Gen 1 or Gen 2.\n\n127\n00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:12.785\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust leave it on Gen 1.\n\n128\n00:07:12.785 --> 00:07:14.817\nWell, no, let's do Gen 2.\n\n129\n00:07:14.817 --> 00:07:18.394\nHonestly, if I'm installing\nanything later than 2012,\n\n130\n00:07:18.394 --> 00:07:22.037\nI'm gonna do Gen 2 to take advantage\nof those features I might or\n\n131\n00:07:22.037 --> 00:07:25.356\nmight not use them, but\nI can't change it after the fact.\n\n132\n00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:28.853\nSo I'm gonna choose that now,\nso that when later on,\n\n133\n00:07:28.853 --> 00:07:33.076\nif I wanna add a scuzzy drive and\nput the OS on that, I can do that.\n\n134\n00:07:33.076 --> 00:07:37.952\nAnd I will click Next and then you're\ngonna give it the stored up RAM\n\n135\n00:07:37.952 --> 00:07:42.653\nis this how much memory he want to\nassign to that machine you see it\n\n136\n00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:47.383\nfalls to 512 there that's the minimum for\nServer 2012.\n\n137\n00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:51.610\nYou can give it as much as you want,\nremember your limitation, how much RAM do\n\n138\n00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.050\nyou have in the physical machine and what\nother machines do you plan on creating?\n\n139\n00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.804\nCuz you've gotta divide it up equally.\n\n140\n00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:04.160\nI like to give this guy at least\n2 gigs for that startup memory.\n\n141\n00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.570\nAnother option that they give me\nhere is to use dynamic memory.\n\n142\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.670\nNow Ronnie had mentioned in previous\nepisode the ability to over-allocate RAM,\n\n143\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.470\nand that's really what dynamic\nmemory will let me do in a way.\n\n144\n00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.840\nNow we might have it to,\n\n145\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.960\ndynamic memory says Hyper-V can\nadjust the amount of memory.\n\n146\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.160\nWhen I start up the server,\nit's gonna get whatever I assign here.\n\n147\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.390\nIn this case, 2 GB of RAM.\n\n148\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.900\nBut once that server's up and running and\nit's loaded up all its drivers,\n\n149\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.970\nit's done all of that, it's probably\nnot using 2 gigs of RAM, right?\n\n150\n00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.400\nIf it's just running DNS or\nDHCP, maybe it's only using 800,\n\n151\n00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.000\na GB of RAM at that time.\n\n152\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.299\nWhat Hyper-V can do is say, all right,\nsince you're only using 600,\n\n153\n00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:51.045\n800 MB of RAM, I'm gonna adjust that down.\n\n154\n00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:54.193\nI'm gonna say, I know I gave you,\nit's gonna take some back again,\n\n155\n00:08:54.193 --> 00:08:55.440\nas a way to say it.\n\n156\n00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.650\nIt'll give you the 2 GB to start up and\nonce it's started up and\n\n157\n00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.580\nit's running,\nit's gonna scale it back to say a GB or\n\n158\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.270\nwhatever the virtual machine\nneeds to do what it's doing.\n\n159\n00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.450\nWhich frees up that memory to\ngive to other virtual machines.\n\n160\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.120\nNow if you start some intensive process\non there, it will grab that memory back,\n\n161\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.230\nassuming that it hasn't been\ngiven again to another machine.\n\n162\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:22.310\nSo dynamic memory allows Hyper-V\nto adjust the amount of RAM\n\n163\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.330\nthat that machine is\nusing at any given time.\n\n164\n00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.248\nThere is a buffer that we'll assign.\n\n165\n00:09:27.248 --> 00:09:32.210\nSo if Hyper-V says you're only\nusing 800 MB of RAM right now,\n\n166\n00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.160\nit won't scale it all the way back to 800,\n\n167\n00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.355\nwhat it'll do is it'll do 800 plus 20%,\nthat's the default buffer there.\n\n168\n00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:42.190\n[COUGH] Excuse me, so\nI like to do the dynamic memory.\n\n169\n00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.990\nIf this is a production environment,\nthough, you might find that that\n\n170\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.790\ncauses some performance issues\nas it has to adjust that memory.\n\n171\n00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.150\nSomething that you'll have to\njust monitor and see how it goes.\n\n172\n00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.620\n>> Now Mike,\nis that one adjustable afterwards, or\n\n173\n00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.510\nis that set after we create it?\n\n174\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.040\n>> It's actually\nadjustable after the fact.\n\n175\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.010\nSo we can go back in the settings and\nwe can change our mind.\n\n176\n00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.901\nIn fact, I have done it where\nI have done like 4,096,\n\n177\n00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:10.094\nif I've got enough memory in the physical\nmachine for the install process, right.\n\n178\n00:10:10.094 --> 00:10:14.510\nI can make that install go really\nfast if I give this a ton of RAM.\n\n179\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:19.340\nIt can load all those files up there, it\ncan install the OS just fine very quickly\n\n180\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.620\nand then I can scale it back\ndown once I've got it installed.\n\n181\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.440\nI'm not sure how much this\nphysical machine has.\n\n182\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.080\nIt looks like about 8 GB, but\nI'm gonna scale that back\n\n183\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.320\njust a little bit cuz we're not actually\ngonna do the installation here.\n\n184\n00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.020\nAll right, I'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n185\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.190\nThen I've got my networking.\n\n186\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.920\nSo you can choose not connected\nwhich is a good option sometimes.\n\n187\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.490\nIf I've got other things I\nwanna do to this machine\n\n188\n00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.210\nbefore I connect it to the network,\nI might leave it as not connected, or\n\n189\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.070\nmaybe I haven't decided what\nI want to connect it to.\n\n190\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.440\nWhether it's gonna be internal or\nexternal, so\n\n191\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.430\nmaybe I leave it as not connected.\n\n192\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.480\nOr I can hit my drop down list and\nI can see if there's any virtual switches\n\n193\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.450\nalready created and\nI can choose from that.\n\n194\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.810\nI created a couple earlier, one called\nSandbox, that's an internal one, that has\n\n195\n00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.520\naccess to the VMs that are connected to\nit, as well as the host of the parent OS.\n\n196\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.900\nWe got another one called Isolated, which\nis VMs only, whoever is connected to that.\n\n197\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.980\nI'll just use Sandbox there.\n\n198\n00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.880\nI'll click Next and then here, I've got\nto create the Virtual Hard Disk, right.\n\n199\n00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.217\nI've got to have somewhere to\ninstall the operating system,\n\n200\n00:11:27.217 --> 00:11:30.361\nstore all of the,\njust like a physical machine would, and\n\n201\n00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:33.783\nby default, wants to create\na new Virtual Hard Drive, right.\n\n202\n00:11:33.783 --> 00:11:35.800\nYou can see what it's gonna name it.\n\n203\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.310\nIt's gonna name it whatever name\nI gave the virtual machine and\n\n204\n00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.650\nit's gonna add that extension .dhdx.\n\n205\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:49.010\nI like to change this, I like to put\na little underscore zero out there,\n\n206\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:53.410\njust because the way disks are numbered,\nit's a zero index numbering system.\n\n207\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.420\nAnd I plan on adding more\nhard drives to this machine.\n\n208\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.650\nAnd so I can keep track of them, all my\nhard drives for this particular VM or\n\n209\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.020\ngonna start with that.\n\n210\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.000\nAnd then I've got that index there\nthat all use an increment as I add\n\n211\n00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.920\nadditional hard drives.\n\n212\n00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.550\nThose location, it's gonna create\nthat subfolder there because I\n\n213\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.490\nset that up on that, first page of\nthe wizard, but then you see what I mean.\n\n214\n00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.500\nAnd I was gonna double it up, and\ncreate another folder underneath there\n\n215\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.080\nbased on the name I gave\nthe virtual machine.\n\n216\n00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.940\nI like to do a way with that and\nthat's just the way I'm gonna do it.\n\n217\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.510\nSo now, what's gonna happen,\nI'll show you the end result here.\n\n218\n00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.710\nYes, I'm gonna have a folder that\ncontains the configuration files and\n\n219\n00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.900\na subfolder for the Virtual Hard Disks,\nand I'll show you again later on.\n\n220\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.470\nAnd then you can see it's gonna\ndefault to 127 GB in size, and\n\n221\n00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.980\nit is gonna be a dynamically\nexpanding Virtual Hard Drive.\n\n222\n00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.510\nNow remember what we said about\nthat in previous episodes.\n\n223\n00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.800\nDynamically expanding drives are cool\nbecause they're not gonna take up\n\n224\n00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.070\nthe entire, there not gonna need to\ngrab that space, like this is 120 GB.\n\n225\n00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.810\nIf there was a fixed drive,\n\n226\n00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.722\nI would need 127 GB of free space that\nit could allocate to this hard drive.\n\n227\n00:13:06.722 --> 00:13:12.200\nBecause it's dynamically expanding,\nit's gonna start out as like 5 MB and\n\n228\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.690\nas I install the operating system and\nother things, it can grow and grow and\n\n229\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:20.100\ngrow, up to a maximum of 127.\n\n230\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.740\nAll right, great for\ntest environments and things like that.\n\n231\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.900\nYou really wanna go fixed drives\nwith your production servers.\n\n232\n00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.460\nNotice this doesn't give me\nthe option to do a fixed drive.\n\n233\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.740\nSo something that you've gotta keep in\nmind, if you're setting these up for\n\n234\n00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:40.390\nproduction, what you really need to\ndo is create the blank VHD first.\n\n235\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.180\nWhen you go through that VHD Wizard,\n\n236\n00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.470\nnow I'll show you that in a little bit,\nyou can choose to create that fixed drive.\n\n237\n00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.130\nThen when you create your virtual machine,\ninstead of saying\n\n238\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.570\ncreate a Virtual Hard Disk, you're gonna\nsay use an existing Virtual Hard Disk,\n\n239\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.090\nyou would browse and\nfind that disk and select it there.\n\n240\n00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.330\nSo just remember that if\nyou wanna use a fixed drive\n\n241\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.890\ncreated before you create\nthe virtual machine.\n\n242\n00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.510\nYou can also attach the disk later.\n\n243\n00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:10.270\nMaybe I forgot [LAUGH] to create that\nfixed size drive before I started this,\n\n244\n00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.080\nand now I'm like, oh, smack.\n\n245\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.980\nSo I can just choose attach later,\ngo create the fixed drive,\n\n246\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.350\nand then go back and attach it, and\nI'll show you where to do that.\n\n247\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.900\nWe'll just use by defaults for\nnow, and click Next.\n\n248\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.970\nAnd then what about my operating system?\n\n249\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.652\nI can do it later,\nonce I've finished this process but\n\n250\n00:14:26.652 --> 00:14:29.877\nI know that I'm gonna be installing\nServer 2012 on this guy.\n\n251\n00:14:29.877 --> 00:14:34.420\nAnd I've already got the ISOs\nstored on this physical server.\n\n252\n00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.781\nSo what I'm gonna do is say install\nan operating system from a bootable image\n\n253\n00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:45.331\nfile and then I'm simply gonna browse and\nfind my ISO for Server 2012 R2.\n\n254\n00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:47.302\nSelect that, and we're good to go.\n\n255\n00:14:47.302 --> 00:14:49.380\nNow I could do this later.\n\n256\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.210\nAll you're doing is taking the ISO and\n\n257\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.870\nputting it into the virtual CD-ROM drive,\nright?\n\n258\n00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.718\nSo, it's gonna be there\nwhen that server boots up.\n\n259\n00:14:56.718 --> 00:15:00.220\nYou could also do network\nbased installation.\n\n260\n00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.258\nMaybe you've got a WSUS server set up.\n\n261\n00:15:02.258 --> 00:15:04.405\nDid I say WSUS?\n\n262\n00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:05.543\n>> Yes, you did.\n[LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:15:05.543 --> 00:15:07.004\n>> We might need one of those too,\n\n264\n00:15:07.004 --> 00:15:08.280\nto do our updates.\n\n265\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.580\nIf we want to put an image out there,\n\n266\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.430\nwe're gonna need\na Windows Deployment Server or\n\n267\n00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.340\na WDS server, which this will do.\n\n268\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.737\nRight, remember that Gentoo\nsupports PXE boot, so\n\n269\n00:15:16.737 --> 00:15:19.570\nI can boot this virtual\nmachine to the network.\n\n270\n00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.990\nAssuming I added a virtual network that\nhas access to the external network and\n\n271\n00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:29.580\nit could PXE boot, find that deployment\nserver, pull down an image, and\n\n272\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.380\nI'm good to go, right.\n\n273\n00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.145\nI'll go ahead and\njust leave it on that bootable image,\n\n274\n00:15:33.145 --> 00:15:36.160\nI'll click Next, it gives me my summary,\n\n275\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.710\na chance to review all of my choices that\nI made if I didn't like any of them.\n\n276\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.390\nI click Back or Previous and\ngo back to the appropriate screen.\n\n277\n00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.930\nIf I like what I've got,\nI'll click Finish, and then whir and\n\n278\n00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:48.860\ngrind for a second.\n\n279\n00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.055\nAnd now I have my new virtual machine.\n\n280\n00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:57.053\nSo relatively straightforward wizard\nthat we can walk through to at least do\n\n281\n00:15:57.053 --> 00:15:58.807\nthe initial creation of that VM.\n\n282\n00:15:58.807 --> 00:16:02.223\n>> Now remember that when we take the look\nat the idea of creating the virtual\n\n283\n00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:06.700\nmachine it doesn't necessarily mean that\nthere is an operating system image on it.\n\n284\n00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.690\nIt means now what Mike\nhas actually done for\n\n285\n00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.080\nus is virtualize that\nmachine that he's on.\n\n286\n00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.660\nIn other words, he's created that file\nthat shows all the configurations.\n\n287\n00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.988\nAnd now, as an installation process,\nif I actually go ahead and try and\n\n288\n00:16:19.988 --> 00:16:24.245\nattach an iso to it, it now I takes\na look at that configuration file and\n\n289\n00:16:24.245 --> 00:16:25.569\nsees it as hardware.\n\n290\n00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:29.202\nAnd so, the operating system doesn't\nreally know much different as it begins\n\n291\n00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:32.710\nto install, and it should see it\nas another machine at that point.\n\n292\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.230\nAnd then we can begin that\ninstall process as well.\n\n293\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.640\nBut even know we've created it, and Mike's\nactually gone through some of those steps,\n\n294\n00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.920\nthere may still be some other\nconfigurations we need to do.\n\n295\n00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.950\n>> Yeah, you're exactly right, Ronnie.\n\n296\n00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.520\nThere's many things we still\nwant to take a look at.\n\n297\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.700\nAnd you bring up a good point.\n\n298\n00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.050\nWhat I want to do real quick is go into\nthe settings for this virtual machine.\n\n299\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.000\nNow that it's created,\nI can go to my settings.\n\n300\n00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.890\nRemember during the wizard\nI said to use that ISO,\n\n301\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.700\nI'm gonna take that away real quick.\n\n302\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.160\nAnd I'll show you this a little.\n\n303\n00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.520\nI'm just gonna say none for\nthe virtual DVD and click OK.\n\n304\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.950\nWe'll go through those\nother settings in a minute.\n\n305\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.340\nAnd now I'm gonna try\nto start this machine.\n\n306\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.990\nCuz I wanna show you what\nRonnie was saying there.\n\n307\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.750\nI'm gonna connect to it.\n\n308\n00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.810\nAnd then I'm gonna click start, right.\n\n309\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.090\nAnd let's just see what happens.\n\n310\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:20.230\nWhat do you expect to happen there,\nRonnie?\n\n311\n00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.010\n>> Not really much.\n\n312\n00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.330\nBut it's gonna actually look like what at\nleast what I hope is gonna look like that\n\n313\n00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:28.730\nis gonna go through the boot up process,\nand what it shouldn't find, of course,\n\n314\n00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.960\nis some bootable system,\neven though we have hard drive attached.\n\n315\n00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.900\n>> That's right, and there you go.\n\n316\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.930\nBoot Failed.\n\n317\n00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:38.508\nEFI SCSI Device PXE Network Boot, and\nnow trying to reach out to the network.\n\n318\n00:17:38.508 --> 00:17:43.068\nBut I put it on an internal network, so\nit's not gonna find a deployment server,\n\n319\n00:17:43.068 --> 00:17:45.027\nso the boot process is gonna fail.\n\n320\n00:17:45.027 --> 00:17:48.592\nThink about it, if you are building\na physical server, you get your case,\n\n321\n00:17:48.592 --> 00:17:51.817\nyour motherboard, your processor,\nyour RAM, your hard drives,\n\n322\n00:17:51.817 --> 00:17:54.887\nyou put it all together,\nyou boot it up, what's gonna happen?\n\n323\n00:17:54.887 --> 00:17:56.070\nWell, boot's gonna fail.\n\n324\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.240\nThere's no bootable media,\n\n325\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.690\nthere's no operating system installed,\njust like we have here.\n\n326\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.000\nSo just like a physical machine,\nonce you build it,\n\n327\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.730\nyou still have to install\nthe operating system, all right.\n\n328\n00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.580\nAnd it's mad cuz I'm forcing it to shut\ndown, but we can pretty much ignore that.\n\n329\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.849\nI'll go ahead and close that.\n\n330\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.574\nAnd we'll just, not something you would\nnormally do to a machine, I'm basically\n\n331\n00:18:17.574 --> 00:18:21.228\npulling the power plug on it right here,\nbut there's no operating system installed,\n\n332\n00:18:21.228 --> 00:18:24.300\nthere's really nothing to corrupt,\nso I'm not that worried about it.\n\n333\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.316\n>> We used to use that term graceful shut\n\n334\n00:18:26.316 --> 00:18:27.059\ndown-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:28.460\n>> We did not gracefully shut it down.\n\n336\n00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.040\nMike simply held the power down for five\nseconds, or just unplugged the machine.\n\n337\n00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.560\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n338\n00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.510\n>> Virtually, at this point, and\nso that's why it's complaining.\n\n339\n00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.110\nBecause if there was\nan operating system on it,\n\n340\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:42.380\nthere is a possibility of corruption, but\nfor right now, it doesn't really matter.\n\n341\n00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.880\nBut, yeah, if you see those errors,\n\n342\n00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.990\nand there are other shows that\nITProTV content library does have.\n\n343\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.440\nIt goes a little bit more in depth\ninto it, but overall, though, yeah,\n\n344\n00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.672\nthat's what we're actually\ntaking a look at.\n\n345\n00:18:52.672 --> 00:18:53.974\n>> Yeah.\n>> When we see some of those\n\n346\n00:18:53.974 --> 00:18:54.680\nunusual errors.\n\n347\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.150\n>> All right, so,\nnow let's go back into those settings and\n\n348\n00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.440\ntake a closer look at them.\n\n349\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.385\nSo, do be careful here.\n\n350\n00:19:00.385 --> 00:19:01.315\nEasy to get confused.\n\n351\n00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:05.575\nThese are HyperV settings up\nat the top of my actions pane,\n\n352\n00:19:05.575 --> 00:19:09.507\nand if Jason could bring us out full\nscreen and then I can show you the bottom.\n\n353\n00:19:09.507 --> 00:19:12.825\nNotice here I've got HyperV and\na bunch of options.\n\n354\n00:19:12.825 --> 00:19:15.935\nThen down below I've got g and v sbr01.\n\n355\n00:19:15.935 --> 00:19:19.005\nThat's because I have that\nmachine selected there, right?\n\n356\n00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:23.020\nSoon as I select that, I get settings that\nhave to do with that virtual machine.\n\n357\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.020\nThose are the settings that you want\nif you're working with the machine\n\n358\n00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.170\nitself, right?\n\n359\n00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.125\nSo there we go, so there's my settings.\n\n360\n00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:33.665\n[COUGH] And you'll see that I can\nadd additional hardware, right.\n\n361\n00:19:33.665 --> 00:19:37.856\nWe'll talk about that if I wanna\nadd a second network adapter,\n\n362\n00:19:37.856 --> 00:19:41.424\nI wanna multi-home this device,\nI can do that here.\n\n363\n00:19:41.424 --> 00:19:46.106\nIn fact, I'll go ahead and click add,\nand I'll connect to a different network.\n\n364\n00:19:46.106 --> 00:19:50.980\nSo, now I'll have one connected just\nisolated and one connected to Sandbox.\n\n365\n00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.880\nIf you wanna do VLAN ID, we've got\nshows where we cover this in-depth.\n\n366\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.420\nI'll go over here and\nclick apply and add new hardware.\n\n367\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.050\nBut this is the time to do it, right?\n\n368\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.530\nWhile the machine is shut down.\n\n369\n00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.385\nIf I powered up, I can't do things like\nadd hard drives, add network adaptors,\n\n370\n00:20:06.385 --> 00:20:07.850\ncuz just like a physical machine,\n\n371\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:13.260\nyou need to shut it down before you start\npulling cards in and out of that machine.\n\n372\n00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.330\n>> Now, Mike, when you said that,\n\n373\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.070\nit actually reminded me\nof something you said.\n\n374\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.250\nThat if you're not sure whether or not\nyou can do this when the machine is on,\n\n375\n00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.540\nyou got to think about that\nphysical process, right?\n\n376\n00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:27.520\nIf you're actually on a machine and you\ngo, look, if I wanted to add in a second\n\n377\n00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.400\nhard drive or a second network adaptor,\nand I had to physically power it off,\n\n378\n00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.090\nwell, then, I need to power it off, even\nin the virtual environment a lot of times.\n\n379\n00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.350\nAnd if it's grayed out, then you know that\noption, especially when the machine's on\n\n380\n00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.080\nand you go,\nI'll just adding another network adapter.\n\n381\n00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.270\nIf it doesn't give you that option, make\nsure you do power down the machine and\n\n382\n00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.758\nthen you'll see those\nsettings are waiting for us.\n\n383\n00:20:45.758 --> 00:20:48.310\nCuz sometimes it's easy just to forget.\n\n384\n00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.240\nYou're in the middle of doing something,\nyou're trying to work very quickly, and\n\n385\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.260\nthen you forget and it's just that easy.\n\n386\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.970\nSo that's a great rule of thumb to follow.\n\n387\n00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.218\n>> Absolutely.\nAll right,\n\n388\n00:20:56.218 --> 00:20:58.780\nif we keep working our\nway down this list here,\n\n389\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.910\nyou can see what firmware it's running.\n\n390\n00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.460\nThis is where I can make sure\nthat secure boot is enabled.\n\n391\n00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.600\nMemory wise, Ronnie was asking about this.\n\n392\n00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.790\nCould I change it?\n\n393\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.640\nAbsolutely.\n\n394\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.330\nThere's the startup RAM that I assigned\nduring the creation of the machine.\n\n395\n00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.640\nIf I wanna change that,\nI'm free to do so here.\n\n396\n00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.040\nI also enabled dynamic memory.\n\n397\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.310\nIf I decided I don't wanna use that\nanymore, I could simply uncheck that.\n\n398\n00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.320\nIf I wanna change the minimum,\nwhat it's allowed to drop it down to, or\n\n399\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.920\nwhat it's allowed to grow to,\nnotice I've got,\n\n400\n00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.530\nwhat are we looking at there,\none million, yeah, that's a lot of RAM.\n\n401\n00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.380\nI don't have that much RAM in there.\n\n402\n00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.300\nSo maybe I want to control the max.\n\n403\n00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.660\nSome applications like SQL,\nvery memory intensive, and\n\n404\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:43.086\nit will grab all the memory that it\ncan to increase its performance.\n\n405\n00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:46.121\nI don't want this machine\ntaking over all the RAM and\n\n406\n00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:48.820\nleaving other virtual\nmachines little to none.\n\n407\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.660\nSo, maybe I wanna set\na maximum on this guy.\n\n408\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.023\nThere's that memory buffers\nI was talking about, 20%.\n\n409\n00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:59.180\nSo, if it sees the machine is only\nusing 800 MEGS of RAM at the time,\n\n410\n00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.209\nit'll drop the RAM allocation down,\nbut not all the way to 800.\n\n411\n00:22:03.209 --> 00:22:06.406\nIt's gonna give a little bit of a buffer\nso, if I start an application or\n\n412\n00:22:06.406 --> 00:22:09.520\nsomething comes up, it's got a little\nmemory to play with it there.\n\n413\n00:22:10.555 --> 00:22:13.830\nProcessor-wise, it defaults\nto one processor, but\n\n414\n00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.090\nnow that I've created the machine,\nI can come back in here and\n\n415\n00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:21.492\nchange those numbers,\ngive it a little more processing power.\n\n416\n00:22:21.492 --> 00:22:24.320\nWe won't get in to the slicing and\n\n417\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.260\ndicing of the processor power in this\nparticular show, but just know you can.\n\n418\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.369\nYou can come back in here and adjust how\nmany cords it's getting, or how many\n\n419\n00:22:33.369 --> 00:22:38.380\nprocessors it's getting, and if you wanna\nkeep one machine from taking over all of\n\n420\n00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.230\nthe processing power of the host machine,\nyou can control that here as well.\n\n421\n00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.430\n>> Now, Mike,\nwhat's the limitation on that?\n\n422\n00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.300\nLet's say that on your machine\nthat we actually do have let's say\n\n423\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.900\na dual core processor.\n\n424\n00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.740\nIs it okay if I assign eight processors?\n\n425\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.090\n>> No,\nit's gonna limit you to what you have.\n\n426\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.630\nIt can virtualize what you have, but\nit's not gonna go beyond that, right?\n\n427\n00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.840\nSee I've got a four core\nprocessor in there.\n\n428\n00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.240\nIt's gonna let me do up to\nfour virtual processors.\n\n429\n00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.462\nAnd we'll drop that back down to two.\n\n430\n00:23:07.462 --> 00:23:08.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n431\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.830\nthere's my hard drive that was\ncreated during the installation.\n\n432\n00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:17.420\nI could change what connector or\nwhat controller it was connected to,\n\n433\n00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.420\nI could change what disk was attached,\nI could go in and edit the disk.\n\n434\n00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.363\nAt this point, I can come back here and\nmaybe change the size of it if I want.\n\n435\n00:23:25.363 --> 00:23:32.180\nBut notice I can't change it to.\n\n436\n00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:36.140\nWith convert I can actually go back and\nchange it to fixed,\n\n437\n00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.312\nif I want to go fixed versus expanding,\nI'm gonna leave that alone for now.\n\n438\n00:23:39.312 --> 00:23:41.540\nDVD drive.\n\n439\n00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.054\nI need to put that image file back\nin there if we're gonna install\n\n440\n00:23:44.054 --> 00:23:45.440\nan operating system.\n\n441\n00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.879\nSo I'm gonna browse and\ngrab that ISO for 2012.\n\n442\n00:23:48.879 --> 00:23:54.644\nNow, there's my network adapter, it's the\nsecond one I added connected to isolated.\n\n443\n00:23:54.644 --> 00:23:57.174\nNotice the changes I'm making are in blue,\nright.\n\n444\n00:23:57.174 --> 00:24:00.446\nUntil I apply them,\nthe changes aren't committed and\n\n445\n00:24:00.446 --> 00:24:04.170\nif I click Cancel those\nchanges would go away.\n\n446\n00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.980\nDown below that, under management\nI've got the name of the machine.\n\n447\n00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.130\nAgain that's not the OS name, that's\nwhat shows up in my console over here so\n\n448\n00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.770\nif I wanna rename that.\n\n449\n00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.710\nIntegration services, this is where we've\nseen this, even those type twos, right?\n\n450\n00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:22.090\nThis allows my computer to synchronize\nits time with the host machine.\n\n451\n00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.748\nAllow the operating system shutdown.\n\n452\n00:24:25.748 --> 00:24:28.440\nI can right-click on a VM over here and\n\n453\n00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.275\nchoose shutdown and\nstill have a graceful shutdown.\n\n454\n00:24:31.275 --> 00:24:32.900\nNot just pull a plug on it, right?\n\n455\n00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.040\nIt can send a command to\nthe operating system that says, hey,\n\n456\n00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.380\nit's time to power down.\n\n457\n00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.600\nAnd just like I would, if I went\nto my Start menu and shut it down.\n\n458\n00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.070\nServices are gonna shut down properly,\neverything unloads, and\n\n459\n00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.400\nthen the operating system shuts down.\n\n460\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.017\nYou can change the locations of where\nyou wanna store your checkpoints.\n\n461\n00:24:49.017 --> 00:24:51.400\nAlso, down here at the bottom,\nsmart paging, again,\n\n462\n00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.580\nis a little bit beyond\nthe scope of this one.\n\n463\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.800\nWe'll deal with that in our\nhyper V classes, or episodes,\n\n464\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.060\nthen we've got these two down here.\n\n465\n00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.600\nNow, I do wanna point these out.\n\n466\n00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.380\nAutomatic Start Action and\nAutomatic Stop Action,\n\n467\n00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.370\nthis has do with let's say the physical\nmachine, the HyperV host reboots.\n\n468\n00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.940\nWhat happens to the virtual machine,\ndoes it reboot or\n\n469\n00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.720\ndoes it stay shut down, right?\n\n470\n00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.163\nAutomatically start if it was\nrunning when the service stopped.\n\n471\n00:25:19.163 --> 00:25:23.985\nSo if this VM was running and\nthe host machine had a power failure,\n\n472\n00:25:23.985 --> 00:25:28.720\nand it rebooted or\nupdate caused that machine to reboot.\n\n473\n00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:34.010\nWell, the virtual machines will shut down,\nthe host machine would reboot,\n\n474\n00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:38.010\nand once it finish booting up it would\nrelaunch my virtual machines for\n\n475\n00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.010\nme, if they were running, right?\n\n476\n00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.480\nIf they weren't running it's\nnot gonna start them up or\n\n477\n00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.430\nyou can say always start them up or\ndon't do anything.\n\n478\n00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.890\nIf it was shut down, leave it shut down,\nif it was running and\n\n479\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:52.020\nthen it rebooted, don't start it up, I'll\ncome in and turn it on when I'm ready.\n\n480\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.910\nI'll leave it on the default,\nsame thing with the stop actions.\n\n481\n00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.020\nWhat happens when you power down the host?\n\n482\n00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.500\nIf the virtual machine was running,\ndoes it save state,\n\n483\n00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.560\ndoes it send a power shut down command\nfirst before it shuts down the host?\n\n484\n00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:10.500\nOr do I do shut down, just shut down\nthe guest or turn off the virtual machine?\n\n485\n00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.030\nRemember the difference there,\nturn off versus shut down.\n\n486\n00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.190\nShut down is what Ronnie\ncalls the graceful process,\n\n487\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.490\nturn off is pulling the power plug.\n\n488\n00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.500\nYou don't really wanna do that, all right.\n\n489\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.460\nSo lot of different settings\nthat I can go back and\n\n490\n00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.550\nconfigure on this virtual machine.\n\n491\n00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.190\nI'll go ahead and click okay to apply it,\n\n492\n00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.020\noh, maybe wanna show you one cool\nthing about this properties.\n\n493\n00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.100\nI know when I first started playing with\nHyperV it took me a while to find this.\n\n494\n00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.500\nI'd work with one virtual machine.\n\n495\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.190\nI'd click OK.\n\n496\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.680\nI'd go to the next one and\nI would pull up its properties and\n\n497\n00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.110\nthen I'd do whatever I wanted to and\nclick OK.\n\n498\n00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.684\nYou can actually change which machine\nyou're working with right up here,\n\n499\n00:26:47.684 --> 00:26:49.567\nI only have one machine to choose from.\n\n500\n00:26:49.567 --> 00:26:53.010\nBut I can click Apply\nto apply these changes.\n\n501\n00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.730\nThen I can go to my next machine\nusing these navigation tools or\n\n502\n00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.000\nthis drop down list and work with\nsettings on that machine as well.\n\n503\n00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.320\nSo pretty cool little options right there.\n\n504\n00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.150\nAll right, last thing I wanna show you\nRonnie, and we'll fire this guy up,\n\n505\n00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.305\nis creating a new virtual hard drive.\n\n506\n00:27:08.305 --> 00:27:11.230\nWhat if you wanted to create\nthat fixed drive before you\n\n507\n00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.850\ncreated the Virtual Machine or\n\n508\n00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.510\nyou wanna add a second drive to\nan existing Virtual Machine?\n\n509\n00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.990\nWell, we can go to New and then Hard disk.\n\n510\n00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.440\nAnd it's gonna be a limited wizard.\n\n511\n00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.130\nInstead of going through the whole\nprocess of creating a VM,\n\n512\n00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.830\nI'm just creating a hard drive.\n\n513\n00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.030\nSo I can choose my format.\n\n514\n00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:32.160\nWe're gonna do VHDX cuz that\nsupports up to 64 terabytes in size.\n\n515\n00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.090\nAnd now I can choose that\nfixed drive if I want to.\n\n516\n00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.875\nRemember, that is going to claim\nthe disk space when you create it.\n\n517\n00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:42.218\nSo I'm gonna create a very small one,\nRonnie, so it doesn't take all day.\n\n518\n00:27:42.218 --> 00:27:45.458\n[LAUGH] And I'll give it a name and\n\n519\n00:27:45.458 --> 00:27:50.739\nthis is where if I follow\nmy naming convention here,\n\n520\n00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:56.142\nI'm gonna call it gnv-svr01-2k12r2_1,\n\n521\n00:27:56.142 --> 00:28:01.676\nthis gives me the second disk\nin this virtual machine.\n\n522\n00:28:01.676 --> 00:28:03.025\nWhere do I wanna store it?\n\n523\n00:28:03.025 --> 00:28:05.280\nWell, the same place I\nstored that other one.\n\n524\n00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.730\nSo I'm gonna browse back over here.\n\n525\n00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:14.810\nGMV server one, virtual hard disks and\nwe'll dump it in there, we'll click Next.\n\n526\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:20.662\nAnd then, what size do I want, well,\n147 would take it a little while to format\n\n527\n00:28:20.662 --> 00:28:23.457\nthat so,\nlet's just do a ten gigabytes for now.\n\n528\n00:28:23.457 --> 00:28:25.908\n>> And Mike, I think that's\na very good point for us to make,\n\n529\n00:28:25.908 --> 00:28:29.860\nat the beginning is to realize that when\nwe create this virtual drives, right.\n\n530\n00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.990\nOnce it actually creates it,\n\n531\n00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.610\nit still really is actually\ncreating a file that big.\n\n532\n00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.710\nOr actually is doing that dynamic\nthing which is perfectly fine.\n\n533\n00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:39.660\nBut it has to format it.\n\n534\n00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.390\nAnd if you actually say look here\nit is fixed size is 127 gigs\n\n535\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.880\nit's gonna create a file that big and\nthen have to go back and format it.\n\n536\n00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.270\nAnd that can take a lot of time.\n\n537\n00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.700\nSo the first time you do it you\nmight be wondering like, man,\n\n538\n00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.920\nis this session normal?\n\n539\n00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.530\nIt really is.\n\n540\n00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.840\nIt's normal in times, in the time that\nyou're actually gonna take to do that.\n\n541\n00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.630\nSo just be aware of that when\nyou do create something.\n\n542\n00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.750\nSo, but don't always so,\nI need my smallest hard drive I can.\n\n543\n00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.430\nYou need to make the size hard drive you\nneed, is what you need to be able to do.\n\n544\n00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.600\nBut just kind of realize that you have\nto pay attention to that timing or\n\n545\n00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.790\nyou're gonna get frustrated just trying\nto go It should be done by now, because\n\n546\n00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:17.960\nthere's nothing on it, but it really is\ncreating the file that is insanely large.\n\n547\n00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.150\n>> Think if you ever go buy\na couple terabyte USB hard drive.\n\n548\n00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.780\nYou plug it in to your system, and\nyou format it, how long does that take?\n\n549\n00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.700\nThat's what it's doing here.\n\n550\n00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.790\nSo, we'll go 10 gigabytes.\n\n551\n00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.620\nWe'll click Next, and then Finish.\n\n552\n00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.910\nNotice, the wizard itself, pretty simple.\n\n553\n00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.240\nNow you see how long it's gonna\ntake even to do this small one.\n\n554\n00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:43.150\nIf I had chosen dynamic and made a two\nterabyte drive, it would already be done\n\n555\n00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:47.640\nbecause it doesn't have to claim\nthat disk space and format it out.\n\n556\n00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.830\nFor the fixed drive it is gonna go\nthrough the entire process here.\n\n557\n00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.350\nNow once it finishes we'll go back,\nand we'll attach it.\n\n558\n00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.040\nAnd I'm gonna show you,\none how to attach it.\n\n559\n00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.630\nWe can go look at the drives as well and\n\n560\n00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.800\nI'll show you the difference\nin the file size here.\n\n561\n00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.690\nSo it's slowly running.\n\n562\n00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.950\n>> You know what,\nwhen you start taking look at this, right,\n\n563\n00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:10.080\nthis is part of that process of\nunderstanding what has to go on and\n\n564\n00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.980\nsometimes you're doing just like we are,\nright?\n\n565\n00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.190\nWe've always kinda make a joke.\n\n566\n00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.652\nA lot of our IT career is actually\nwatching what little bars that go across\n\n567\n00:30:17.652 --> 00:30:20.460\nthe screen but\nwe do have to actually patiently wait.\n\n568\n00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.540\nBut Mike's showing us a lot of information\nright here at the beginning, right?\n\n569\n00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.932\nThe very fact that we now have a VM,\nand what we may need to go back and do,\n\n570\n00:30:27.932 --> 00:30:29.742\nespecially in a production network,\n\n571\n00:30:29.742 --> 00:30:32.702\neven though we might be very\ncareful in the initial creation.\n\n572\n00:30:32.702 --> 00:30:35.847\nThere are times where we wanna go back and\ntake a look at the settings for\n\n573\n00:30:35.847 --> 00:30:38.883\nthat VM and make sure they're actually\nthe way that we want them to,\n\n574\n00:30:38.883 --> 00:30:42.590\nbefore we start it up,\nespecially in that production network.\n\n575\n00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.720\n>> So that guy finished up so\nI'm gonna pull up the settings for\n\n576\n00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.970\nthe virtual machine.\n\n577\n00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.423\nAnd I'm gonna go over here\nto my Scuzzy controller and\n\n578\n00:30:51.423 --> 00:30:53.427\nI'm gonna add another hard drive.\n\n579\n00:30:53.427 --> 00:30:55.478\nSo I'm gonna click Add and then for\n\n580\n00:30:55.478 --> 00:30:59.016\nthe virtual disk I could launch\nthe wizard form right here,\n\n581\n00:30:59.016 --> 00:31:03.289\nI didn't have to do it from that other\nmenu but I'm gonna click browse.\n\n582\n00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.570\nAnd I'm going to go\nback out to my Hyper V.\n\n583\n00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:11.280\nGNV, SVR01, virtual disks.\n\n584\n00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.120\nAnd there's my disk zero and disk one.\n\n585\n00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.765\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nattach that guy and click OK.\n\n586\n00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.660\nAnd now I've got two hard drives for\nthat machine.\n\n587\n00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.360\nNow let's go take a peek\nat those guys real quick.\n\n588\n00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.510\nI did SQL and Hyper V.\n\n589\n00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.330\nSort of a one virtual hard disks.\n\n590\n00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.270\nAnd look at the file size over here.\n\n591\n00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.970\nFor that one that we just\ncreated I said 10 gigabytes\n\n592\n00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.520\nthe file size is 10 gigabytes.\n\n593\n00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.470\nEven though it's an empty file right?\n\n594\n00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.860\n10 gigabytes in size.\n\n595\n00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.600\nNow my operating system drive\nthat was dynamic, four megs.\n\n596\n00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.528\nNow of course when I install the operating\nsystem it's gonna start to grow,\n\n597\n00:31:49.528 --> 00:31:52.850\nbut it starts out teeny tiny and\nit grows as needed.\n\n598\n00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:54.100\nSo at this point Ronnie,\n\n599\n00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.990\nwe've got everything set up the way\nwe wanted on our virtual machine.\n\n600\n00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:02.820\nWe've got everything configured for\nour settings, RAM, processor.\n\n601\n00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:07.030\nWe attached a second hard drive to store\ndata on, or whatever the case may be.\n\n602\n00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.750\nWe've put the ISO into\nthe virtual DVD drive.\n\n603\n00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.590\nSo the only thing that leaves\nus is to actually start it up.\n\n604\n00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.590\nSo let's take a look at it and\nsee what happens.\n\n605\n00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.090\n>> Awesome.\n\n606\n00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.520\n>> I'm going to connect to that machine.\n\n607\n00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.230\nUse as remote desktop protocol to\nconnect over to that machine, and\n\n608\n00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.720\nI'll click the power on button.\n\n609\n00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.470\nAnd remember,\n\n610\n00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:29.840\njust like a physical machine would,\nlet me press a key to boot to the DVD.\n\n611\n00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.550\nI almost forgot to do that.\n\n612\n00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:36.560\nAnd now we should see,\nif I can scroll down, there it goes.\n\n613\n00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.585\nIt is actually starting\nthe install process.\n\n614\n00:32:38.585 --> 00:32:42.910\nSo just like a physical machine, depending\non my bios settings and the boot order.\n\n615\n00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.403\nIt looked at that hard drive,\nnothing bootable on there.\n\n616\n00:32:46.403 --> 00:32:49.280\nSo it looked at the CD drive,\nor the DVD drive, and said oh,\n\n617\n00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.460\nhere's a bootable disc,\nand it booted to that.\n\n618\n00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.320\nAnd now I start the installation process.\n\n619\n00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.760\nAnd we don't have to sit here and watch\nthis, this is just like installing server\n\n620\n00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.890\non a physical machine,\nthere's no difference at this point.\n\n621\n00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.575\n>> Now Mike, you actually showed\nattaching that second hard drive,\n\n622\n00:33:04.575 --> 00:33:07.330\nwould that show up here during\nthe installation process?\n\n623\n00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.730\n>> Well let's go over there and\nfind out Ronnie.\n\n624\n00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.100\nLet's click next.\n\n625\n00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:16.270\nSo I'm going to select that guy,\nright click on it and choose connect.\n\n626\n00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:20.300\nYou can start it up without connecting\nto it, I kinda like to see it.\n\n627\n00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.120\nEspecially during this install part,\n\n628\n00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.180\nbecause just like a physical machine,\nit's going to look at the hard drive,\n\n629\n00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.000\nsee that there's nothing bootable there,\nit's gonna go to that DVD drive.\n\n630\n00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.440\nNow I gotta press the good old any key,\n\n631\n00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.100\nif I can find it, and\nchoose to boot to the DVD.\n\n632\n00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.440\nAnd that should begin\nthe installation process.\n\n633\n00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.440\nSo there we go,\nit's now booting to that DVD.\n\n634\n00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.970\nOne cool thing you'll notice\nabout HyperV and 2012R2,\n\n635\n00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:49.490\nit's actually aware that it's\ngoing inside a virtual machine,\n\n636\n00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.020\nand it has some of the integration\ntools already installed.\n\n637\n00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.040\nNotice I can move my mouse in and\nout of that virtual machine.\n\n638\n00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.640\nThere it's active in the virtual machine,\nwithout hitting a special key,\n\n639\n00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.570\nI can flip over to my\nhost machine as well.\n\n640\n00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:08.350\nAnd that's again, just because it's one of\nthose later operating systems that's aware\n\n641\n00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.960\nof and has some of those integration\ntools already installed.\n\n642\n00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.210\nSo we're gonna click next on here,\nI'll choose install now.\n\n643\n00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.290\nI'll punch in my product key hopefully.\n\n644\n00:34:19.798 --> 00:34:22.720\nJust thinking about it,\nwhat did we give it, Ronnie, two gigs?\n\n645\n00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.000\nIt should be relatively quick\non the install process, but\n\n646\n00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.400\nwe don't have to got\nthrough the whole thing.\n\n647\n00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:33.450\nYou see setup is starting,\nI'll input my product key and we'll\n\n648\n00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:39.380\nclick next, cuz we want to try to find\nout if that second hard drive is visible.\n\n649\n00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.420\nI'll do server with a GUI,\nthat's fine, we'll click next.\n\n650\n00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:51.180\nI'll accept my EULA, I'll do a custom\ninstall, and there is that second drive.\n\n651\n00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:52.890\nNow unfortunately it's not big enough,\nright?\n\n652\n00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:56.080\nBut you can see that it is\ngonna show up in there and\n\n653\n00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.150\nI would be able to install to\nit if it was large enough.\n\n654\n00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:02.410\n>> So it's very amazing that once\nwe do this, especially in something\n\n655\n00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.190\nlike a type one hypervisor,\nbecause we're normally running this\n\n656\n00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:09.250\ninside our production network, that is\nreally what we want to pay attention to.\n\n657\n00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:12.410\nDefaults are perfectly fine when you\nactually just need to get something up and\n\n658\n00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:13.670\nrunning right away.\n\n659\n00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.050\nBut when you're doing this for\nwork and that machine's got to be up\n\n660\n00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:20.900\n24 hours a day, seven days a week, you\nwanna take the time at the very beginning.\n\n661\n00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.080\nAnd this little kind of mini\nseries on HyperV, we did,\n\n662\n00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.400\nwe took a look at some of those different\nsettings that we want to make sure that we\n\n663\n00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.875\nadjust to the way that we want them to be,\nso we don't have to go back and\n\n664\n00:35:32.875 --> 00:35:36.680\nre-adjust them over and\nover again to tweak it in that manner.\n\n665\n00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.440\nSo Mike, thank you again for\nactually giving us\n\n666\n00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.270\nall those demonstrations about\nworking with Microsoft HyperV and\n\n667\n00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.630\nalso giving a start on\nthat installation process.\n\n668\n00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:50.200\nThe rest of the process is just like\na regular install on a physical machine,\n\n669\n00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.730\nthat's why we're not so worried about\ntaking you through the whole thing.\n\n670\n00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.790\nThere's nothing much at the end,\nwe're gonna be asked to reboot.\n\n671\n00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.870\nAnd the thing's gonna be reboot and\nit's gonna be perfectly fine as well.\n\n672\n00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:01.570\nMike, any last little words of wisdom,\n\n673\n00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.830\nas far as working with HyperV\nif you're just starting?\n\n674\n00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.130\n>> I would say make sure that one,\nyou've got all of your updates for\n\n675\n00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.910\nyour host operating system,\nlike my host is running 2012R2.\n\n676\n00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:16.840\nGet all of your updates for that,\nand then install your role, and\n\n677\n00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.473\nthen go back and do your updates again.\n\n678\n00:36:18.473 --> 00:36:20.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz there are some updates for\n\n679\n00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.690\nHyperV itself that you wanna\nmake sure that you get.\n\n680\n00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.530\nAnd other than that, have fun and play,\n\n681\n00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.150\nits relatively easy to get\naround HyperV console.\n\n682\n00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.500\n>> There's only also one other thing\nthat I want to mention as well.\n\n683\n00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.770\nEven though we've kinda\nreally just shown you about,\n\n684\n00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:40.603\nof course, the Windows Server HyperV,\nMicrosoft does make a stand-alone\n\n685\n00:36:40.603 --> 00:36:44.150\nHyperV product itself you can go and\ndownload for free.\n\n686\n00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.270\nBut when you do that, it's really gonna\nbring you to a command line prompt.\n\n687\n00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:50.570\nSo that's what we didn't really\nfocus in on for the beginning here.\n\n688\n00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.255\n>> And there's some very good\nadvantages to that right?\n\n689\n00:36:53.255 --> 00:36:57.570\nWe've talked about how resources have to\nget divided up between all the VM's that\n\n690\n00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.750\nyou're running.\n\n691\n00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:02.600\nPart of that goes to the host or what\nthey call the parent operating system.\n\n692\n00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:08.555\nWell if I'm running server 2012R2 with\na GUI and I'm installing HyperV on that,\n\n693\n00:37:08.555 --> 00:37:12.240\nthat host is taking up at\na minimum 512 megs of RAM.\n\n694\n00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:18.320\nIf I installed just HyperV on the bare\nmetal, I lose all that overhead,\n\n695\n00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.880\nwhich means there's more resources\nI can dedicate to virtual machines.\n\n696\n00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.710\nSo maybe that's an option you want.\n\n697\n00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.740\nAnother thing we didn't mention\nis we do have client HyperV.\n\n698\n00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:32.360\nYou can install the same product, HyperV,\non your Windows 8 or your Windows 10 box.\n\n699\n00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.410\nSo if you wanna play around with it maybe\nyou do that, maybe you're not running\n\n700\n00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:39.140\nthe server operating system, all the\nwizards are gonna look exactly the same.\n\n701\n00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.900\nAnd in fact they're identical.\n\n702\n00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.830\nSo that means I can develop a machine\non my client operating system, and\n\n703\n00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.920\nthen export it out and\ngive it to my production team, and\n\n704\n00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.760\nthey can import it into their\nHyperV on their servers if I want.\n\n705\n00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.130\nSo it's a really tight product.\n\n706\n00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:54.970\nIt's very cool.\n\n707\n00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:58.080\n>> Now, Mike, since you've mentioned\nthe client just briefly here, that's still\n\n708\n00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.260\na type one hypervisor, or is that\na type two hypervisor with the client?\n\n709\n00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.130\n>> It is a type two.\nYou're gonna\n\n710\n00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.960\nhave to reboot the system\ntwice to get that installed.\n\n711\n00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.900\n>> All right.\n\n712\n00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:05.890\nWell Mike, Thank you again.\n\n713\n00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:06.760\n>> Wait, did I say type two?\n\n714\n00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.870\n>> Yes.\n>> I meant type one.\n\n715\n00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.000\nIt's a type one hypervisor.\n\n716\n00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.324\nSo you're gonna reboot a couple\ntimes to get that slipped in under\n\n717\n00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:15.030\nthe operating system.\n\n718\n00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.000\n>> All right then, Mike.\n\n719\n00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.250\nAgain, thank you for all that you've\nactually demonstrated for us today.\n\n720\n00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.150\nThank you for joining us.\n\n721\n00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:23.900\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n722\n00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.130\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n723\n00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:29.905\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n724\n00:38:29.905 --> 00:38:32.030\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.330\nI'm you host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.989\nwe're gonna be moving through\nvirtualization technologies, and what\n\n5\n00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.430\nwe're gonna be looking at specifically\ntoday is something known as VMWare ESXI.\n\n6\n00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.280\nNow that was a former name and you might\nhave heard it called today VSphere, and\n\n7\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.060\nwe have none other than Mr.\nRonnie Wong here to help us out.\n\n8\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.020\nHow you doing Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.230\n>> I am doing fine.\n\n10\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.962\nWe are now jumping into the world of,\nwell, more virtualization technology.\n\n11\n00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:44.246\nIn previous episodes, we've already taken\na look at some type two hypervisors,\n\n12\n00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:49.072\nand what we're talking about specifically\nthere of course is being able to\n\n13\n00:00:49.072 --> 00:00:52.921\ninstall and configure and\nmanage VirtualBox types of VMs.\n\n14\n00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:57.109\nBeing able to also use the VMWare\nWorkstation 11, and doing the same thing,\n\n15\n00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.553\nlearning how to install it, configuring a\nVM there, as well as taking a look at some\n\n16\n00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:04.726\nof the management features that\nalso offers these too, and\n\n17\n00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:08.217\nnow we're moving into what we call\nour type one hypervisors, and\n\n18\n00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:11.040\nwe're actually getting\nready to do the same thing.\n\n19\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.410\nWe're gonna install, we're gonna\ntake a look at configuring, and\n\n20\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.720\nalso managing those types of VMs too.\n\n21\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.920\nSo let's go ahead and\nget our head wrapped around that idea and\n\n22\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.980\nthat difference between the type two and\nthe type one hypervisors.\n\n23\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.930\nOnce again, just as a refresher,\nlet's take a look at my screen as I\n\n24\n00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.100\nhave a diagram pulled up to help us to\ndistinguish this fact and feature as well.\n\n25\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.910\nSo from this point on, we're actually\ngoing to take a look at type one\n\n26\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.120\nhypervisors, is what we'll be\nspending the majority of our time in.\n\n27\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.100\nAnd what we wanna do is make\nsure that we understand it.\n\n28\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.810\nSo everything that we've done in\nthis series here on virtualization\n\n29\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.120\ntechnologies, really centering\naround creating VMs,\n\n30\n00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.740\nhas been based on what we\ncall the type two hypervisor.\n\n31\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.417\nNow we look from bottom up of the screen,\nremember that we have our physical\n\n32\n00:01:56.417 --> 00:02:01.780\nhardware that's actually being represented\nfor us you know by the hardware itself.\n\n33\n00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.826\nAnd normally what ends up happening is\nthat once we build our physical hardware\n\n34\n00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:09.562\nthe way that we want to, we install\nwhat we call an operating system, and\n\n35\n00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:12.962\nit's represented here in this\nlayer of green words that you see.\n\n36\n00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:16.276\nAnd so that is a layer of software\nthat we install on top and\n\n37\n00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:19.935\nit really does control access\nto the hardware, and of course,\n\n38\n00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:25.190\ncontrols the output that we get from\nthe hardware back in the software as well.\n\n39\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.060\nNormally if we're creating then\nthe virtualization technology and\n\n40\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.410\ngetting ready for VMs, we then would\ninstall our type two hypervisor,\n\n41\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.400\nand that's actually\nrepresented in the pink here.\n\n42\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.640\nThe last one that we did right here was,\n\n43\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.450\nthe last one that we actually took\na look at was the VMWare Workstation 11.\n\n44\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.960\nPreviously before that we had\ntalked about Oracle's VirtualBox.\n\n45\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.490\nThese are pretty much\ntwo of the most popular\n\n46\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.330\ntype two hypervisor\ntechnologies that are there.\n\n47\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.000\nAre there many more?\n\n48\n00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.180\nYes, but these are the two\nthat you will hear about and\n\n49\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.910\nsee about if you're actually an IT worker.\n\n50\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.050\nThese are kinda the two main\nones that you'll also see.\n\n51\n00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.260\nThen we build our VM's on top of that,\n\n52\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.210\nright, our virtual machines, whether\nthey're Windows OS running application or\n\n53\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.120\nthey're Linux OS running applications,\nperfectly fine.\n\n54\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.160\nThis makes it really very easy for\nus because then\n\n55\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.770\nI can actually be on my desktop computer,\nrun that type to Hypervisor, and\n\n56\n00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.080\nactually use that machine as my personal\nworkstation, and also create the VMs\n\n57\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.960\nrunning and doing the things that they\nneed to in the background as well.\n\n58\n00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.020\nAnd this is actually a great\nenvironment for us to work in.\n\n59\n00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.010\nNow when you take a look though, notice\nthat the operating system images that we\n\n60\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.070\nhave up here in that virtualization layer,\n\n61\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.050\nthere's two layers of software in between,\nwell, this operating system,\n\n62\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.300\nthis WinOS, and of course,\nthe physical hardware as well.\n\n63\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.740\nThat means there's a lot of overhead\nthat has to be translated before that\n\n64\n00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.530\nVM really can do and perform\nthe way that it really can perform.\n\n65\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.330\nSo one of the things that actually did\ncome at a little bit of a later cost here\n\n66\n00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.270\nis this idea of what we call\nthe type one hypervisor.\n\n67\n00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.990\nAnd so here notice the physical hardware,\nbut instead we've put in between\n\n68\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.030\nthat hypervisor what we call\nthe VMM in previous series.\n\n69\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.530\nNow if you go all the way back\nto the beginning of the series\n\n70\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.860\nwe did define some terms.\n\n71\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.240\nYou may hear the term\nvirtual machine monitor, or\n\n72\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.630\nmanager is how I'd normally describe it.\n\n73\n00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.120\nAnd now notice that there\nis no underlying host\n\n74\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.560\noperating system that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n75\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.780\nWe directly install that particular\nlayer on top of the hardware.\n\n76\n00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.315\nAnd this is where another term is, and I\ndidn't actually bring this up in previous\n\n77\n00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:45.210\nepisodes here, but you may also hear\nthe term bare metal hypervisor.\n\n78\n00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.635\nAnd that bare metal\nhypervisor is something that\n\n79\n00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:47.754\nwe're actually gonna take a look at.\n\n80\n00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:50.940\n>> Now Ronnie,\nlet me see if I understand this right.\n\n81\n00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.530\nWith the type twos that\nwe been looking at,\n\n82\n00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.180\nwe've got a couple layers of abstraction,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.710\nWe've got the native operating\nsystem that's running, or\n\n84\n00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.910\nthe host operating system,\nthat's running on the machine.\n\n85\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.230\nThen we got the hypervisor that's\nessentially running inside of that, so\n\n86\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.620\nwe got a few layers or\na couple layers of abstraction.\n\n87\n00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.930\nIt seems like if you've only got that\nsingle hypervisor on the bare metal like\n\n88\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.530\nyou mentioned, it seems like\nthat would improve performance.\n\n89\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.130\nAm I in the right location here?\n\n90\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.840\n>> You are absolutely correct\non that basic assumption.\n\n91\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.490\nAnd the reason why is that we no\nlonger have to split off resources\n\n92\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.810\nwith that host operating system.\n\n93\n00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.374\nSo now every machine that actually runs\ncan get access to, really the majority,\n\n94\n00:05:27.374 --> 00:05:30.500\nif not just about all\nthe resources that are available,\n\n95\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.865\nsuch as RAM, and of course, hard drive\nspace, and everything else, right?\n\n96\n00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:37.670\nWhereas before we had to install\nthe operating system that would take up\n\n97\n00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.730\na certain amount of RAM,\ncertain amount of hard drive space, and\n\n98\n00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.710\nthen whatever was left over, in theory,\nthen I could divide among the VMs.\n\n99\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.500\nBy using this idea of bare metal\nhypervisor, or type one hypervisor,\n\n100\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.420\nwhat we're actually doing instead is we're\ngonna take a little bit of resources to\n\n101\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.480\nrun that hypervisor, but\nthen we can directly start installing\n\n102\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.490\nthe operating systems inside of\nVMs the way that we want to, and\n\n103\n00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.720\nthey can have access to just about\nthe majority of the hardware, if not all.\n\n104\n00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.200\nNow it depends on the hypervisor.\n\n105\n00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.990\nEach one actually does have\ndifferent requirements to them\n\n106\n00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.660\ndepending on where they run.\n\n107\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.650\nAnd that's where we want to\nfocus in on on this episode.\n\n108\n00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.480\nWe'll talk about installing them.\n\n109\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.820\nSo not every machine can actually\nrun this type of hypervisor as well.\n\n110\n00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.520\nSo some of the technologies that\nwe've talked about in other episodes,\n\n111\n00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.090\nsuch as the Intel VT technology, or\nwhat you may also hear is the term\n\n112\n00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.190\nhardware assisted\nvirtualization technology.\n\n113\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.480\nThese are essential to the bare\nmetal hypervisors, and\n\n114\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.960\nthat is because they really do it,\nthey absolutely map the actual\n\n115\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.260\nlocations that we actually have\non CPUs and inside of RAM.\n\n116\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.030\nAnd instead of actually having to\ntranslate them into different language,\n\n117\n00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.740\nwhat ends up happening is the hypervisor\nsays, I'll just mimic what\n\n118\n00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.300\nyou're telling me, and I will create\nit right there in the hypervisor and\n\n119\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.460\npass that on to the operating system\nas it is actually direct here.\n\n120\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.550\nSo the operating system is running\naside of that virtualization layer\n\n121\n00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.600\ninstead of them having to translate it\ninto some of that the hypervisor knows and\n\n122\n00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.300\nthen it translates to then to the new\nhardware, it just passes it on through,\n\n123\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.460\nit actually makes it much more efficient,\nmuch better and much faster.\n\n124\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.130\nAnd that's why these type one\nhypervisors are normally preferred\n\n125\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.980\ninside of the production environment too.\n\n126\n00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.010\nInside that production environment, that\nruns 24 hours a day, seven days a week for\n\n127\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:36.210\nyour business, the type one\nhypervisor is a layer of software\n\n128\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:42.280\nthat very little of it actually goes\nto doing ten, 20, 30 different things.\n\n129\n00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.580\nIts only desire, its only job and\n\n130\n00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.850\nits only duty is to make sure that\na hypervisor does what it needs to do.\n\n131\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.170\nAnd that's not a very complex type\nof software, so it generally runs,\n\n132\n00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.497\nit might not take more than a couple\nhundred, maybe 500 megabytes.\n\n133\n00:07:57.497 --> 00:08:02.544\nAt most in terms of hard drive space and\nlot of times not even\n\n134\n00:08:02.544 --> 00:08:08.690\n256 megs of RAM does it take to\nrun just the hypervisor itself.\n\n135\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.430\nSo it really is a very efficient\ntype of system and that means\n\n136\n00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.790\nall of the actual extra hardware that you\nhave, it can be put in and that should be\n\n137\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.440\nused as a resource pool for all of your\nother VMs that you are going to create.\n\n138\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.550\nNow, we're specifically gonna take a look\nhere at using probably the most popular\n\n139\n00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:33.220\none that's actually been out there in the\nworld, which is gonna be the VMware ESXi,\n\n140\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.080\ntold you I was gonna murder\nthis all the way through, and\n\n141\n00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:43.110\nthat is base on the original hypervisor\ntechnology that VMware, put out there.\n\n142\n00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.090\nNow this particular technology at one\npoint was by far one of the most expensive\n\n143\n00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.640\ntechnologies that you can\nactually end up purchasing, but\n\n144\n00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.310\nyour companies relied on it and\nit's because it is rock solid.\n\n145\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.745\nIt absolutely has been out there and\nactually been performing\n\n146\n00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:01.916\nwell in just about every organization\nout there probably ends up using it.\n\n147\n00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:06.777\nAnd that's because it is by\nfar the industry default or\n\n148\n00:09:06.777 --> 00:09:09.910\nde facto type of standard.\n\n149\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.250\nThen at one point, they decided to\nmake the hypervisor itself free.\n\n150\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.690\nSo don't get me wrong,\nthe management side of this is not free.\n\n151\n00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:22.460\nBut the hypervisor technology itself, and\nthey also made that one free now too, and\n\n152\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.800\nthey've put a little i over it and\nthat's why it's called ESXi instead.\n\n153\n00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.580\nAnd you may go like I've\nnever heard that term, ESXi.\n\n154\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.600\nYou've heard the term v sphere and\nWes was just mentioning that.\n\n155\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.390\nThat there is a newer term out there.\n\n156\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.090\nSo if you heard vsphere,\nhypervisor, or hypervisor vsphere,\n\n157\n00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.900\nwhatever you call it,\nit's really referring to the same thing.\n\n158\n00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.070\nSo that is what we're\nreally focusing in on.\n\n159\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.580\nIf you remember when that\ntechnology came out, and\n\n160\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.120\nI remember the first time, the day that\nit came out and it was absolutely free,\n\n161\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.970\nwe were installing it on\nmachines that very day.\n\n162\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.520\nAnd so I still hold dear to that term and\nlooking at.\n\n163\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.379\nAnd to tell you the truth when I see\nthe interface I'd tell you the truth,\n\n164\n00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:11.478\nit really looks like the very\nfirst day that I install it and\n\n165\n00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:13.706\nnow it's actually up to version 6.0.\n\n166\n00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:18.540\nSo what do we need to do when we start\ntalking about getting it installed on to\n\n167\n00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.790\na machine and\nmaking it run the way that we need to.\n\n168\n00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.950\nWell one, we need to understand\nthat minimum requirement.\n\n169\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.940\nThat that is what we're gonna\ncall the bare minimum and\n\n170\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.130\nonce we do that, no big deal.\n\n171\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.260\nWe can actually install it but\n\n172\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.860\nthat doesn't mean that it's gonna actually\nhost any other machines that are there.\n\n173\n00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.930\nSo the good thing is, and the,\nthe good thing and the problem,\n\n174\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.800\nright, is that most machines today\nabsolutely can support anything.\n\n175\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:50.400\nAnd you can install VMware ESXi\non anything that you want to.\n\n176\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.750\nBut VMware though has a recommendation or\nwhat they call compatibility guides,\n\n177\n00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.790\nthat you can check out\ninstead if you're not sure.\n\n178\n00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.200\nWell let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n179\n00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.020\nSo, inside of VMWare's website right,\nyou can go and\n\n180\n00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.740\nregister for a free account and\nthat will give you access in.\n\n181\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.020\nAnd, actually, I think these compatibility\nguides you don't even have to register,\n\n182\n00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.830\nbut it's always nice to have that\nbecause it also will give you some\n\n183\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.880\nemails of course that will let you\nknow when new features come out and\n\n184\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.280\nnew things are happening here.\n\n185\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.560\nBut if you go to their website and\n\n186\n00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.560\nyou look at compatibility guides,\nit's a bit of interactive feature.\n\n187\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.660\nIt's not just static reading here.\n\n188\n00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.840\nSo let's take for an example here it\nsays certified compatibility guides.\n\n189\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.110\nIf I come down here to\nthe community-supported hardware and\n\n190\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.480\nsoftware right here we can take,\n\n191\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.550\nlet me verify that I'm actually\ntelling you the right one here.\n\n192\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.650\nSo I think I selected the right one.\n\n193\n00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.609\nYeah, this one is actually about\nthe compatibility guide here, and\n\n194\n00:11:48.609 --> 00:11:52.070\nyou'll notice that you can actually\nchoose some of the different ones.\n\n195\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:59.259\nSo search the compatibility guides for\nESX, which I'm not gonna be able to say,\n\n196\n00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:03.289\nESX, and\nthe newest one is actually like 6.\n\n197\n00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:07.872\nAnd there's actually even another one in,\nit's actually listed right here as a 6.0,\n\n198\n00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:11.307\nU1 is update one, and then they can go,\nand then they can search for\n\n199\n00:12:11.307 --> 00:12:15.468\nall of the hardware that's actually gonna\nbe compatible with this thing if I had,\n\n200\n00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:17.220\nif it didn't lock up here.\n\n201\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.990\nSo, it looks like it actually gotten\nreally slow in doing that thing\n\n202\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.300\nthat it needs to do.\n\n203\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.770\nLet me get out of that and\ncome back in instead.\n\n204\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.520\nSo we can actually use,\nsuch as this drop down list right here.\n\n205\n00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.850\nAnd then if I wanna take a look,\n\n206\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:34.620\nlet's say that for instance,\nWes, I have a Dell server.\n\n207\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.130\nI'm just gonna scroll down here\nunder Partner Name and pick Dell.\n\n208\n00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.570\nI can select Dell, and let's say the one\nthat I have is not an actual rack mounted,\n\n209\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:47.480\nbut it's actually just a regular tower\nsystem, an older one that I have there.\n\n210\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.250\nAnd I'm just gonna see all other features.\n\n211\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.800\nI may have some but\nI may not have any, for all I know.\n\n212\n00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.730\nAnd then, you can start putting in\nthe specifications for your system.\n\n213\n00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.770\nSo as far as the memory goes,\nthis one says minimum certified memory,\n\n214\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.130\nthe maximum certified memory here.\n\n215\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:04.810\nLet's see.\n\n216\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.410\nThis is way higher.\n\n217\n00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.230\nSo this one actually starts\nat terabytes of memory.\n\n218\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.940\nLet's say I don't even have that.\n\n219\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.580\nSockets.\n\n220\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.010\nIt's asking me how many physical\nsockets are on my motherboard.\n\n221\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.530\nLet's say I have two.\n\n222\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.740\nAnd then each core.\n\n223\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.350\nIt's an older one.\n\n224\n00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.210\nLet's say that each one's actually\na dual core processor at this point.\n\n225\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.760\nAnd then I can select\nthe CPU series if I want to.\n\n226\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.270\nAnd go down and pick which one that I\nwant, I don't remember which one I have.\n\n227\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.870\nBut then, I can select view\nthe results and the updates.\n\n228\n00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.050\nAnd at this point,\nit says nothing was actually matching, so\n\n229\n00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.310\nI probably was a little\nbit too specific here.\n\n230\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.560\nLet me just make it more general and\nI'll just choose Dell.\n\n231\n00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.330\nIt's probably being a little bit too,\nthere we go.\n\n232\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.900\nSo give us a few results more here.\n\n233\n00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.010\nSo notice that depending\non the PowerEdges I have,\n\n234\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.820\nI might have actually been able\nto type in the specific model.\n\n235\n00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.800\nAnd I know that I have some, actually l\none of these is sitting right outside of\n\n236\n00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.920\nour door right here, a PowerEdge T330.\n\n237\n00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.700\nSo this one has a single socket and\nit has four cores per socket.\n\n238\n00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.200\nAnd then, I can see what's supported.\n\n239\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.820\nSo right over here I have it\nwill support version 6.0,\n\n240\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:16.720\nupdate 1 and I have 5.5,\nupdate 3 that we can actually support.\n\n241\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.680\nSo what do you do from that\npoint once you have that?\n\n242\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.840\nWell once you have that,\nthen you can go back and\n\n243\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.450\nnow go into that particular location,\nwhere you can download this.\n\n244\n00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.540\nNow I'm trying to be careful here,\n\n245\n00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.430\nbecause I do have an actual license number\nthat I'm trying to hide at the same time.\n\n246\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.810\nSo when you select it, and you registered\nin, and you do have a license for\n\n247\n00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.080\nthis thing, then you can go in here, and\n\n248\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.254\nthere it is,\nVMware vSphere Hypervisor 6.0, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:45.254 --> 00:14:50.100\nAnd so that is the correct name,\nand Wes is, he was saying,\n\n250\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.230\nwhy in the world do I still it that?\n\n251\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.880\nCuz I'm old.\n\n252\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.550\nOkay, that's what it comes down to.\n\n253\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.640\nAnd most of the time,\n\n254\n00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.040\ninside the work environment is where\nyou first encountered that technology.\n\n255\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.220\nThat's what you're gonna call it too.\n\n256\n00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.090\nBut notice it says this one.\n\n257\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:09.660\nBoot your server with this image in order\nto install or upgrade to ESXi, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.030\nAnd if you're gonna be running ESXi\nthe key here is to remember that it\n\n259\n00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.090\nactually requires a 64\nbit machine to do that.\n\n260\n00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.090\nThis image also includes\nthose VMware tools and\n\n261\n00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.440\nthis is actually again\nextra tools over there.\n\n262\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.590\nAnd of course, these MD5's and\nthese checked sums that we have here.\n\n263\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.810\nNow, Wes, do you know about these\nchecked sums and what they're for?\n\n264\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.190\n>> Well in some of\nthe things that I've known,\n\n265\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:37.060\nlike for instance, I'll take Linux\ndistributions for an example.\n\n266\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.114\nYou want to make sure that if you're\ngoing to download this software,\n\n267\n00:15:40.114 --> 00:15:43.423\nyou want to be able to check, and I know\nit gets a little redundant check sum,\n\n268\n00:15:43.423 --> 00:15:47.029\nyou wanna be able to check the integrity\nof the software that you have downloaded.\n\n269\n00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:50.998\nAnd I can only imagine Ronnie, where we're\ntalking about a type-1 hypervisor that\n\n270\n00:15:50.998 --> 00:15:53.598\nmost likely will be put into\na production environment.\n\n271\n00:15:53.598 --> 00:15:56.070\nYou don't want any bugs in that software.\n\n272\n00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.685\nYou don't want any changes whether\nit be malicious changes or just,\n\n273\n00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:02.440\nthrough just normal network\ntransmission errors.\n\n274\n00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.620\nSo what I'm thinking here is that you can\nverify that the integrity of the software\n\n275\n00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.610\nhas been maintained after\nit's been downloaded.\n\n276\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.210\n>> That's right.\n\n277\n00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.370\nThat's the whole goal behind it.\n\n278\n00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.500\nRemember that one type one hypervisors,\nyou are going to make sure that\n\n279\n00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.550\neverything that you download is\nexactly what it needs to be.\n\n280\n00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.620\nThese check sims are actually\ndesigned to do that for you.\n\n281\n00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.988\nWhere will you download it.\n\n282\n00:16:20.988 --> 00:16:23.900\nYou actually can download it and then\ncheck it against these numbers here by\n\n283\n00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.960\nrunning it through a hash and\nthey should actually match up.\n\n284\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.100\nThe one that you downloaded and\nbeing able to actually match up\n\n285\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.070\nto the one that they swear\nthat's on their site as well.\n\n286\n00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.250\nNow traditionally right, you don't\nactually do it versus these numbers that\n\n287\n00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.260\nyou get directly off that\nsite that you still download.\n\n288\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.760\nSo in theory, what should happen\nis you get these numbers and\n\n289\n00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.790\nlet's say that you went out and you\ndownloaded off of some third party website\n\n290\n00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.970\nand you say hey I wanna see if\nthis is actually the right one.\n\n291\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.050\nYou should be able to run some hashing\nsoftware and get this number and see if\n\n292\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.450\nyour file actually does match up to this\nwhen you run it through the same thing.\n\n293\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.370\nShould be ready to go\nif everything matches.\n\n294\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.970\nNow, you can do it off of the same one\nbecause this is from a trusted location,\n\n295\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.130\na trusted source.\n\n296\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.545\nIt's directly from VMware.\n\n297\n00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:07.444\nThey're saying, if you download it,\nyou wanna make sure you check this and\n\n298\n00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:10.700\nverify that every single bit is there,\nand that's what you're doing.\n\n299\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.490\nSo when you do this, you wanna make sure\nthat you get the actual ISO image, and\n\n300\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:19.670\nnotice again there,\nthey call it ESXI ISO image.\n\n301\n00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.580\nAnd this is just a file that is\ngoing to be able to be downloaded.\n\n302\n00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.843\nAnd then you can either mount it,\nor a lot of times what ends\n\n303\n00:17:27.843 --> 00:17:32.804\nup happening is you burn it to an actual\nphysical media such as a DVD or\n\n304\n00:17:32.804 --> 00:17:36.129\na CD here, in this case, 352 megabytes.\n\n305\n00:17:36.129 --> 00:17:39.680\nAnd then it can boot up, and\nthen you can install from there.\n\n306\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.220\nNotice they also add in what we\ncall this VMware vSphere client.\n\n307\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.330\nThis is your first management\nutility that you also have,\n\n308\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.450\nthen, that will allow you to manage us.\n\n309\n00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.910\nNow, this is something that we haven't\nseen in the type two hypervisors before\n\n310\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.810\nWes where it actually requires a client.\n\n311\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.190\nIn other words,\nit requires another system.\n\n312\n00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.725\nYou cannot do what we've been\ndoing in the type two hypervisors.\n\n313\n00:18:02.725 --> 00:18:06.310\nBe sitting directly at the machine where\nare all the VMs are actually running and\n\n314\n00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.970\neverything, and\nthen manage those same things as well.\n\n315\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.665\nYou always have to actually go to\na different machine to do so, and\n\n316\n00:18:12.665 --> 00:18:15.100\nthis is one of the softwares\nyou can do to use that.\n\n317\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.688\n>> So this is a big departure.\n\n318\n00:18:16.688 --> 00:18:20.451\nWe've seen all-inclusive software where\neverything was just included right in\n\n319\n00:18:20.451 --> 00:18:24.170\nthe package and now they're again getting\ninto like a production environment.\n\n320\n00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.795\nAnd this type one hypervisor it seems\nlike you need the server side element and\n\n321\n00:18:27.795 --> 00:18:31.770\nyou need the client side element in\norder for both of them to work together.\n\n322\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.350\n>> Yeah you really will do that, and\nthat first one that we see that says\n\n323\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.860\nthe vSphere client, this is where you\nalso have to know a little bit more.\n\n324\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.450\nLet me show you again here.\n\n325\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.280\nWhere it says vSphere,\nVMware vSphere client.\n\n326\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:49.320\nThis is a simple management client for\nyou, and it's great as long as you only\n\n327\n00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:56.220\nhave one server that you're gonna be\ninstalling this vSphere on, or the ESXI.\n\n328\n00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.780\nOkay, now if you're or\nactually going to be running multiple\n\n329\n00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.640\nservers that you are installing this on,\nthis will not be sufficient.\n\n330\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.430\nSo this is great for one.\n\n331\n00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.540\nBut it's not great if you now are running\ntwo or three or ten or 15 of them.\n\n332\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.460\nThis will not be sufficient.\n\n333\n00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.380\nIf you are going to do that,\ninstead you want to scroll down here and\n\n334\n00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.970\nactually include in the V center.\n\n335\n00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.360\nActually, it's not on this one here.\n\n336\n00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.050\nOh, had to go to a different location.\n\n337\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:30.570\nThere's actually gonna be\na software that's called V server,\n\n338\n00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.620\nI keep saying V center, but\nit may be called V center, but\n\n339\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:40.330\nits actually what we call\nvirtualization server software instead.\n\n340\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.240\nSo it's like this particular\nkind of stripped down product.\n\n341\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.920\nBut actually with you know\neverything on steroids.\n\n342\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.220\nIt gives you access to\neverything else that you need.\n\n343\n00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.670\nSo multiple ones you'd actually\nbe doing that V Server, and\n\n344\n00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.750\non a single one you'd actually be\nusing this V client to do that.\n\n345\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.730\n>> So that's kind of like a for instance,\nand again going back to like a Linux\n\n346\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.020\ndistro there, where you can\ndo a minimalistic install and\n\n347\n00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.480\nthen you have to add\nthe packages you want so.\n\n348\n00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.490\nLooks like you might say,\n\n349\n00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:09.000\nwell maybe, why would I use just a minimal\ninstall versus maybe the full install?\n\n350\n00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.430\nMaybe you want complete customization\nof the entire environment versus\n\n351\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.650\nI don't have to customize it and\nfigure it out.\n\n352\n00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.800\nThis way I get everything and\nthen it's available for\n\n353\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.860\nme the moment the installation is done.\n\n354\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.550\n>> That is definitely correct there.\n\n355\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.870\nSo we do need to be aware\nof what we're doing.\n\n356\n00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.540\nIn our instance and what we're going to be\nshowing you is gonna be a single install\n\n357\n00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.350\non a single machine.\n\n358\n00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.480\nSo we'll probably be able to use that\nsingle client for the majority of it, but\n\n359\n00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.720\nas we actually need to do\na little bit more complex things,\n\n360\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.860\nwe'll actually end up seeing that server\nproduct instead and we'll do that too.\n\n361\n00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.960\nNow the only other thing\nyou have to worry about,\n\n362\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.740\nright, is what are you\ngoing to manage this on?\n\n363\n00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.660\nWell, it actually allows you to\nmanage it on Linux or Windows.\n\n364\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.780\nI was about to say Lunix or\n\n365\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.660\nsomething like that,\nwhich was not gonna be correct at all.\n\n366\n00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.640\nBut you can't do it on a Mac computer,\nokay?\n\n367\n00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.340\nSo you either are gonna go\nto a Windows workstation, or\n\n368\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.770\nyou're gonna go to\na Linux base workstation.\n\n369\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.930\nAnd they have the client for\nboth of those, right?\n\n370\n00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.191\nSo make sure you download\nthe Linux one for the Linux,\n\n371\n00:21:08.191 --> 00:21:10.712\nmake sure you download the Windows\nclient for the Windows.\n\n372\n00:21:10.712 --> 00:21:13.672\nAnd that way you can actually\ninstall it and once you do that,\n\n373\n00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:17.920\nthen you can get connected in and be\nable to manage the way that you want to.\n\n374\n00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.990\nYou do not have access to it from\na Mac though, so that is a limitation\n\n375\n00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.700\nthat you'll have to deal with if that's\nwhat's gonna end up happening, okay.\n\n376\n00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.910\nThe only other thing of course is well\nwhat can you actually install in these?\n\n377\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.440\nYou can install just about\nanything that you want to\n\n378\n00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.840\ninside of the VMs that you\nrun inside of the ESXI.\n\n379\n00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.210\nThe only limitation right now,\n\n380\n00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.810\nright, is gonna be of course do\nyou have the proper licensing?\n\n381\n00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:47.340\nAnd that's always a key component\nof someone working in IT.\n\n382\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.330\nIt's easy to kind of say look\nI'm only testing this, I don't\n\n383\n00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:55.800\ncare about licensing, but that is not\nsomething you want to actually be doing.\n\n384\n00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.750\nSo make sure when you do\ninstall this either grab\n\n385\n00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.890\nevaluation copies if you're\njust testing this out.\n\n386\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.750\nOr make sure you actually do\nhave the proper licensing for\n\n387\n00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:10.430\neach and every operating system you're\ngonna end up installing in a VM for\n\n388\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.430\nyour environment that you have.\n\n389\n00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.120\nThat's a very critical and important part\nof the IT industry and it's nothing that\n\n390\n00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.670\nwe need to just kind of bypass here, so\nwe need to make sure that we can do that.\n\n391\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.170\nSo understanding the basic compatibility,\n\n392\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.090\nunderstanding that we're now moving\non to that type one hypervisor,\n\n393\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.270\nthat we're gonna actually install\nit directly on the hardware itself.\n\n394\n00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.090\nWe don't need another operating\nsystem installed on there and\n\n395\n00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.040\nthen we actually need to go ahead and\ndo some base configuration\n\n396\n00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.750\nbefore we can get managed, so it's just\nabout time for us to get started here.\n\n397\n00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.310\nSo remember that what you want\nto do is you wanna download\n\n398\n00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.300\nwhich of those you're actually gonna use.\n\n399\n00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.880\nAnd I've already downloaded them for\nme to be able to do this.\n\n400\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.210\nNow that way that you do it is\nthat once you download the ISO,\n\n401\n00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.150\nyou're gonna burn it to a DVD or a CD.\n\n402\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.220\nOr if you're willing to take the time and\n\n403\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.580\nthis is where it becomes\na little bit more challenging,\n\n404\n00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:04.800\nif you're willing to take the time you\ncan create a goodable USB drive, okay?\n\n405\n00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.360\nAnd that is my recommendation.\n\n406\n00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.140\nIt's normally a faster install because\nit's actually reading directly off USB\n\n407\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.400\ninstead of having to spin\nup an actual DVD or CD.\n\n408\n00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.880\nSo you can do that and\nreboot the computer and\n\n409\n00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.110\nthen you'll follow\nthe instructions through.\n\n410\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.530\nSo let's go ahead and get started Wes.\n\n411\n00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.010\n>> All right, sounds good.\n\n412\n00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.440\nReady to see an installation\nof the ESXI software.\n\n413\n00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.152\nVery good Ronnie, so what do we got here?\n\n414\n00:23:27.152 --> 00:23:29.220\n>> All right, so\nwe're going to get started here.\n\n415\n00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.440\nI've got a machine right next to me.\n\n416\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.970\nAnd I've got my install disk, right?\n\n417\n00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.430\nThe ISO that I've downloaded,\nand I went ahead and\n\n418\n00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.650\nput it on a USB and made it bootable and\nI've got that stuck in.\n\n419\n00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.570\nThe only thing I need to do now\nis actually get ready to start\n\n420\n00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:44.130\nturn on my machine.\n\n421\n00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:44.900\nWhat do you think, Wes?\n\n422\n00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.419\nShould we start?\n\n423\n00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:46.539\n>> Yeah, I think that's a great idea.\n\n424\n00:23:46.539 --> 00:23:49.658\nAnd one of the things you're gonna keep\nin mind that it doesn't matter what\n\n425\n00:23:49.658 --> 00:23:51.604\nthe installation media\nis that you've used.\n\n426\n00:23:51.604 --> 00:23:57.453\n>> Whether it's gonna be a DVD,\noptical drive, CD.\n\n427\n00:23:57.453 --> 00:24:00.745\nFor instance, if it fits the size there.\n\n428\n00:24:00.745 --> 00:24:03.950\nBut whatever installation medium you have,\n\n429\n00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.926\njust make sure that you have\nit prepared and ready to go.\n\n430\n00:24:07.926 --> 00:24:12.442\n>> Now what I just hit there, I believe I\nhit the F12 key that should actually bring\n\n431\n00:24:12.442 --> 00:24:14.779\nme to the different boot options as well.\n\n432\n00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:18.852\nSo while Wes was talking, I went ahead and\nstarted up the actual computer.\n\n433\n00:24:18.852 --> 00:24:22.341\nRemember, I've got that bootable usb\nkey in there and you're actually seeing\n\n434\n00:24:22.341 --> 00:24:25.620\nthe list of different bootable\ndevices that we're seeing here.\n\n435\n00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.340\nSo notice that there's a couple\nof hard drives in here.\n\n436\n00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.721\nThere's actually the onboard,\nlooks like CD.\n\n437\n00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:32.497\nAnd of course, the network adaptor.\n\n438\n00:24:32.497 --> 00:24:37.647\nThe one that I'm looking for\nis right there on the USB device, because\n\n439\n00:24:37.647 --> 00:24:43.337\nthat's where I have that ESXI ISO ready\nto actually be able to go and install.\n\n440\n00:24:43.337 --> 00:24:45.515\nNow I built this off of a Mac machine, so\n\n441\n00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:49.081\nyou'll see that it actually has\na little installer right here.\n\n442\n00:24:49.081 --> 00:24:52.103\nThis U boot in install and\nI'd leave it at default,\n\n443\n00:24:52.103 --> 00:24:56.741\nthis is just gonna continue to count up\nand then give me that menu option again,\n\n444\n00:24:56.741 --> 00:25:01.311\nbut what I want is actually that second\noption there and you'll see the name of\n\n445\n00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:05.770\nthe actual ISO that I downloaded and\nthe installer that it needs.\n\n446\n00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.736\nSo from this point, I simply press Enter,\ncuz I need to select that and\n\n447\n00:25:09.736 --> 00:25:12.234\nthis is where we begin\nthe install process.\n\n448\n00:25:12.234 --> 00:25:14.806\nNow right before the show\nI was telling Wes here,\n\n449\n00:25:14.806 --> 00:25:18.005\nbecause I do remember that\nthe very first time this came out,\n\n450\n00:25:18.005 --> 00:25:21.097\nthe installer really doesn't\nlook that much different.\n\n451\n00:25:21.097 --> 00:25:23.362\nThere may have some\ndifferent file names in, but\n\n452\n00:25:23.362 --> 00:25:26.855\nI remember the very first time I was\ninstalling this on that very first day.\n\n453\n00:25:26.855 --> 00:25:31.000\nIt really does look just about identical\nto the day that I remember it.\n\n454\n00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.256\nAnd so as loading up all the things that\nneeds to in RAM, all the files that needs\n\n455\n00:25:35.256 --> 00:25:39.657\nto be a little install and do everything\nelse as it actually continues to do that.\n\n456\n00:25:39.657 --> 00:25:43.304\nWe're gonna see this process and\nthen I have to answer several different\n\n457\n00:25:43.304 --> 00:25:46.964\nquestions along the way to get it\nfully installed, the way they want to.\n\n458\n00:25:46.964 --> 00:25:50.981\nNow even as we talk like that, it sounds\nlike an incredibly manual process.\n\n459\n00:25:50.981 --> 00:25:54.408\nAnd in a large environment,\nyou might be doing this to 10,\n\n460\n00:25:54.408 --> 00:25:58.120\n20 may be even a 100 different\nmachines that sounds boring.\n\n461\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.720\nThe good thing is because of the way\nthe ESX is actually designed,\n\n462\n00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.701\nyou can do this and\n\n463\n00:26:02.701 --> 00:26:07.041\nscript it out to where all those answers\nare gonna be provided for you instead.\n\n464\n00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:07.563\nOkay?\n\n465\n00:26:07.563 --> 00:26:09.461\nSo let's go back to our\nscreen here just for\n\n466\n00:26:09.461 --> 00:26:11.957\na moment as we start seeing\nsome of the install process.\n\n467\n00:26:11.957 --> 00:26:14.991\nThat bar across the bottom\nactually indicates, of course,\n\n468\n00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:17.502\nhow long we have until\nit's actually fully done.\n\n469\n00:26:17.502 --> 00:26:21.634\nAt the top the key for you in your\norganization is to make sure that you're\n\n470\n00:26:21.634 --> 00:26:25.024\nactually installing the version\nnumber that you need and so\n\n471\n00:26:25.024 --> 00:26:29.117\nmake sure they actually or\nyou're actually installing the right one.\n\n472\n00:26:29.117 --> 00:26:33.500\nOrganizations do not always\ntend to upgrade to the latest\n\n473\n00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.439\nedition of their hypervisor\nsoftware right away.\n\n474\n00:26:37.439 --> 00:26:40.719\nSo it may be where you might\nbe running on lets say,\n\n475\n00:26:40.719 --> 00:26:44.717\n5.5 or 5.0 and\nthat may be the one that you get instead.\n\n476\n00:26:44.717 --> 00:26:48.179\nThe only thing that you'll see is that\nyou'll see that the whole thing really\n\n477\n00:26:48.179 --> 00:26:51.747\ndoes look fairly similar while this one\nthe number at the top is actually gonna be\n\n478\n00:26:51.747 --> 00:26:52.860\ndifferent.\n\n479\n00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.700\nAlso notice the report is the actual\nhardware that you see up there, as well.\n\n480\n00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.596\nSo this process right here might just take\na few minutes as we actually wait on this\n\n481\n00:27:01.596 --> 00:27:06.348\nto complete, part of the install until we\nget that next portion where we need to\n\n482\n00:27:06.348 --> 00:27:07.725\nmake some decisions.\n\n483\n00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:12.135\nWe're actually at the next decision that\nwe need to make, so we've gotten pass out\n\n484\n00:27:12.135 --> 00:27:16.482\nthe yellow and that gray kind of screen\nand here is there's a saying, hey, look,\n\n485\n00:27:16.482 --> 00:27:19.260\nthe process is now actually\nofficially beginning.\n\n486\n00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.459\nWhat we saw before is just really\nloading up all of the software or\n\n487\n00:27:22.459 --> 00:27:26.428\nall of the files then these right at the\nbeginning into the RAM on your computer,\n\n488\n00:27:26.428 --> 00:27:27.925\nso it can work with it faster.\n\n489\n00:27:27.925 --> 00:27:30.903\nAnd now it's actually saying,\nhey, here's the install process,\n\n490\n00:27:30.903 --> 00:27:32.348\ndo you really want to begin here?\n\n491\n00:27:32.348 --> 00:27:36.086\nI'm simply going to press Enter\nto really begin the installation.\n\n492\n00:27:36.086 --> 00:27:38.393\nNow this next part is always important and\nWes,\n\n493\n00:27:38.393 --> 00:27:40.822\nI'm pretty sure you being\nas diligent as you are.\n\n494\n00:27:40.822 --> 00:27:44.127\nYou always read what we call that\nend user licensing agreement and\n\n495\n00:27:44.127 --> 00:27:47.266\nit may take you 5 minutes,\nit may take you 10, 15 hours.\n\n496\n00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:49.691\nBut I know Wes Bryan, you probably\nread every single one of those.\n\n497\n00:27:49.691 --> 00:27:53.620\n>> Oh, you better believe it with\nall the clause, subsection A.\n\n498\n00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.222\nIt is a good thing, keep in mind.\n\n499\n00:27:55.222 --> 00:27:57.439\nJust because something says open source.\n\n500\n00:27:57.439 --> 00:27:58.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A lot of times,\n\n501\n00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.611\nwe associate open source\nwith being free and\n\n502\n00:28:00.611 --> 00:28:03.416\nthat might not be the case\nin a commercial environment.\n\n503\n00:28:03.416 --> 00:28:07.848\nSo you really do have to pay attention\nto the EULAs even if I'm not reading\n\n504\n00:28:07.848 --> 00:28:12.062\nthe whole thing, because is it free for\nthings like commercial use,\n\n505\n00:28:12.062 --> 00:28:13.532\nnon-commercial use.\n\n506\n00:28:13.532 --> 00:28:18.184\nSo definitely pay attention to that and we\nwill hope that Ronnie's not actually gonna\n\n507\n00:28:18.184 --> 00:28:20.395\ntest me on that by the end of the episode.\n\n508\n00:28:20.395 --> 00:28:25.196\n>> So I'm just gonna simply follow\nthe prompt and press F11 to continue,\n\n509\n00:28:25.196 --> 00:28:26.938\nat least I think I am here.\n\n510\n00:28:26.938 --> 00:28:27.904\nOh, there it goes.\n\n511\n00:28:27.904 --> 00:28:29.134\nSo it's actually just gonna take a moment.\n\n512\n00:28:29.134 --> 00:28:31.957\nSometimes I get a little bit panicked\nwhen that doesn't happen, but\n\n513\n00:28:31.957 --> 00:28:34.546\nwe were talking about it a little\nbit that a lot of times you are.\n\n514\n00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:38.223\nAll you're doing is actually waiting in\nbetween these different segments here.\n\n515\n00:28:38.223 --> 00:28:41.704\nSo a good portion of your it career\nis actually hurry up and wait.\n\n516\n00:28:41.704 --> 00:28:44.388\nNow here is saying, hey,\nlook we need to install this.\n\n517\n00:28:44.388 --> 00:28:48.408\nNow this is where it got a little bit\ntricky on me the very first time that I\n\n518\n00:28:48.408 --> 00:28:49.280\ndid this here.\n\n519\n00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.104\nBecause I tried to install this on\na machine, not the very first time, but\n\n520\n00:28:53.104 --> 00:28:56.743\nlet's say, the first time today that\nI tried to install it is that I had\n\n521\n00:28:56.743 --> 00:28:58.675\nthis machine in a simple raid array.\n\n522\n00:28:58.675 --> 00:29:02.830\nIn other words, it was a striped disk and\nit did not like that install.\n\n523\n00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:07.053\nSo I had to go back and separate out these\ndisks, because at the very beginning,\n\n524\n00:29:07.053 --> 00:29:09.712\nyou probably saw where it\nshowed two hard drives.\n\n525\n00:29:09.712 --> 00:29:12.447\nAnd so instead when you\nactually do put them in raid,\n\n526\n00:29:12.447 --> 00:29:16.317\nit shows up as a single drive and\nit's actually going across both of them.\n\n527\n00:29:16.317 --> 00:29:18.614\nThe installer did not like that process.\n\n528\n00:29:18.614 --> 00:29:20.836\nSo instead, it's showing me that I have,\n\n529\n00:29:20.836 --> 00:29:23.320\nhere's that installer\ndrive that I'm using.\n\n530\n00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.556\nThe one that's holding that USB ISO\nwith the installer on it and\n\n531\n00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:28.999\nhere is one of those drives\nthat I had striped and\n\n532\n00:29:28.999 --> 00:29:31.766\nhere's the other drive that I had striped,\nas well.\n\n533\n00:29:31.766 --> 00:29:34.460\nAnd I'm simply gonna select\nthat first drive again, so\n\n534\n00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.650\nwe'll actually install just on that drive.\n\n535\n00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.269\nNow I won't be able to access that second\ndrive yet and in a simple install,\n\n536\n00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:43.830\nwe're not gonna actually do a lot of\nconfiguration changes right now, so\n\n537\n00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.370\nwe're simply gonna be using\nthis first drive here.\n\n538\n00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:51.056\nAnd once I select that first drive,\nI need to go ahead and press Enter and\n\n539\n00:29:51.056 --> 00:29:52.238\nthen there it is.\n\n540\n00:29:52.238 --> 00:29:55.700\nIt's now going to begin to write\nthe information that I need and\n\n541\n00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.583\nthis is the one that I need\nto choose here on this one.\n\n542\n00:29:58.583 --> 00:30:02.836\nNow it's asking me which of these options\nthat I want to be able to pick and\n\n543\n00:30:02.836 --> 00:30:05.852\nI'm gonna choose this third option for\nright now.\n\n544\n00:30:05.852 --> 00:30:07.767\nAnd at least,\nI hope I choose that third option.\n\n545\n00:30:07.767 --> 00:30:11.187\nIf not, it will probably complain\nabout something that I have there.\n\n546\n00:30:11.187 --> 00:30:14.978\nAnd now, it's actually gonna take a little\nbit of time as it continues on through\n\n547\n00:30:14.978 --> 00:30:17.010\nthe rest of this process and\nwhat it needs.\n\n548\n00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:22.373\nSo the only thing I've done right is I've\naccepted the end user licensing agreement,\n\n549\n00:30:22.373 --> 00:30:26.854\nI've selected the hard drive that I'm\ngonna be installing ESXi onto and\n\n550\n00:30:26.854 --> 00:30:30.919\nthen told it to overwrite the options\nthat I have already preset.\n\n551\n00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:32.359\nAnd you're probably saying\nwhy are you overwriting?\n\n552\n00:30:32.359 --> 00:30:36.238\nBecause this is not the first time this\nhas been installed on this machine,\n\n553\n00:30:36.238 --> 00:30:39.257\nwe're actually just scratching\nit all the way to blank and\n\n554\n00:30:39.257 --> 00:30:43.740\nwe're starting brand new for our show\nhere, so that we see the entire process.\n\n555\n00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.134\nSo that means that what it's probably\ndoing in the background right now is just\n\n556\n00:30:48.134 --> 00:30:50.732\nsimply, it's probably\nwiping that drive and\n\n557\n00:30:50.732 --> 00:30:54.927\nthen installing at least beginning\nthe process of installing ESXi on it and\n\n558\n00:30:54.927 --> 00:30:59.341\nwe're just actually gonna have to wait\nhere a few minutes as it does its thing.\n\n559\n00:30:59.341 --> 00:31:02.186\nSo what you're actually seeing here is,\nit's asking me about an upgrade and\n\n560\n00:31:02.186 --> 00:31:05.057\nyou're probably wondering, well,\nyou're not upgrading it or anything.\n\n561\n00:31:05.057 --> 00:31:09.828\nWell, it sees it as a new install process\nand it thinks it's actually a new upgrade.\n\n562\n00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:13.348\nSo instead,\nwhat I'm gonna do is actually go ahead and\n\n563\n00:31:13.348 --> 00:31:16.954\npress F11 I believe to\nconfigure that final upgrade.\n\n564\n00:31:16.954 --> 00:31:20.310\nAnd this particular process,\nI can't remember, it actually takes any,\n\n565\n00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.467\nit looks like it's actually doing\npretty fast here as we continue on.\n\n566\n00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:26.242\nBut now, it's actually taking a look and\ncomparing the differences.\n\n567\n00:31:26.242 --> 00:31:30.333\nIf there is anything that's different file\nby file as it goes through, it will go\n\n568\n00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:34.017\nall right, here's a newer version and\nit will probably upgrade those.\n\n569\n00:31:34.017 --> 00:31:37.117\nIf the file is probably identical,\nit will probably leave it alone and\n\n570\n00:31:37.117 --> 00:31:38.649\ncontinue on that process as well.\n\n571\n00:31:38.649 --> 00:31:41.012\nSo this process can be fairly quick or\n\n572\n00:31:41.012 --> 00:31:45.445\nit may even take a little bit of time\nhere, depending on what we have.\n\n573\n00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:49.332\nNow sometimes I've seen this where it does\ntake a long time and just sits there,\n\n574\n00:31:49.332 --> 00:31:51.670\nsometimes it just sits there for\na few minutes.\n\n575\n00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.068\nAnd then all of the sudden,\nit finishes the rest of the process.\n\n576\n00:31:54.068 --> 00:31:55.223\nReally quickly and\n\n577\n00:31:55.223 --> 00:32:00.061\nthat looks like what's happening here is\nthat it did compare a good portion of it\n\n578\n00:32:00.061 --> 00:32:03.900\nand it found all of the actual\nfiles to be just about identical.\n\n579\n00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.220\nIt should find it as actually being\ntotally identical at this point as well.\n\n580\n00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.120\nNow here it is,\nit actually is no longer complaining.\n\n581\n00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.811\nIt is saying, hey, you are done and\nyou are ready to go.\n\n582\n00:32:14.811 --> 00:32:18.175\nAnd what I need here is a final reboot and\nso if I go ahead and press\n\n583\n00:32:18.175 --> 00:32:22.623\nEnter from here, as long as that actually\nconfirms and does everything we need to,\n\n584\n00:32:22.623 --> 00:32:25.607\nyou might hear in the background\na little bit of noise and\n\n585\n00:32:25.607 --> 00:32:28.400\nthat's kicking the actual DVD drive out.\n\n586\n00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.220\nWhy is it doing that?\n\n587\n00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.400\nBecause it's expecting me to go ahead and\ntake the DVD drive out and\n\n588\n00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.928\nit's gonna reboot the machine at this\npoint is why we're actually doing that.\n\n589\n00:32:36.928 --> 00:32:39.250\nSo we're gonna actually\nlet the machine reboot and\n\n590\n00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.200\ncome back up is what\nwe're going to do here.\n\n591\n00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.542\nAnd there it goes, so the machine's\ngonna actually reboot this time.\n\n592\n00:32:45.542 --> 00:32:48.010\nI'm gonna try and\nmake sure I don't touch it and\n\n593\n00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:52.670\nlet it actually reboot into\nthe hypervisor that installed.\n\n594\n00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.260\nSo remember, traditionally\nthe way that we would do this,\n\n595\n00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.850\nright, is we'd put a DVD in there or\nwhatever we'd actually have,\n\n596\n00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:02.600\nand it actually rebooted into the actual\nUSB key, no matter what I chose.\n\n597\n00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.900\nSo I'm gonna actually do a,\n\n598\n00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.770\nlet me see if I can get out this\nparticular system here, there we go.\n\n599\n00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:12.010\nAnd this time we can press the Option\nhere to get into the boot menu and\n\n600\n00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:15.130\nactually tell it to boot\nup to a hard drive instead.\n\n601\n00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.300\nSo it was defaulting, of course, to that\nUSB cuz I had already picked it before.\n\n602\n00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.280\nAll right, so\nwe've now actually restarted the computer.\n\n603\n00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.620\nNow there was a time, right,\nwhen it actually did restart,\n\n604\n00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.210\nand it looked like it was\ngonna reinstall everything.\n\n605\n00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:31.830\nJust be patient, give it a moment or two,\nand just let it do what it needs to do.\n\n606\n00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.530\nWhen it does, what you should end up\nseeing is what we're gonna show you on\n\n607\n00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.070\nthe screen right now.\n\n608\n00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:39.690\nSo on the actual PC screen, we should end\nup seeing something that looks like this,\n\n609\n00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:40.990\nand you're like, oh, what's happened?\n\n610\n00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.000\nWell it's in power saving mode because\nwe actually held it on for a moment.\n\n611\n00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.330\nI just pressed the up arrow and\n\n612\n00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:49.480\nnow this is what you normally see\nas once it finishes installing.\n\n613\n00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.010\nNow the kind of thing that actually\nworries you a little bit is\n\n614\n00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.890\nright there in the yellow, okay?\n\n615\n00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:58.500\nThis is also something else that can\nhappen as a mistake at the beginning\n\n616\n00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.080\nis that we want that machine to\nbe plugged into the network.\n\n617\n00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.410\nAnd the reason why you want to do that is\ncuz you can't actually manage the actual\n\n618\n00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.030\nESXi, you can't manage it from here.\n\n619\n00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.540\nThe only thing it's really giving you\nis right here at the very beginning.\n\n620\n00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.230\nAnd by trying to actually do it from here\nit's gonna be a little bit more impossible\n\n621\n00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.580\nfor us to do this.\n\n622\n00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.800\nAnd that's because it really is\nsupposed to be minimalistic,\n\n623\n00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.180\nwe're supposed to manage this\nfrom that vSphere client instead.\n\n624\n00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.040\nSo the only thing that you really\nneed is actually in that second line,\n\n625\n00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.290\nI believe that's where the IP address is.\n\n626\n00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:34.488\nThat's telling you, hey, you're gonna\nactually connect into this IP address,\n\n627\n00:34:34.488 --> 00:34:35.137\nthat .183.\n\n628\n00:34:35.137 --> 00:34:40.068\nAnd when you do that it's gonna bring up a\nweb page that's gonna allow us to download\n\n629\n00:34:40.068 --> 00:34:44.480\nthe vSphere client that we talked\nabout and that will give us the.\n\n630\n00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.830\nAnd there is, you see that it actually\nkinda went to the black again, and\n\n631\n00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.530\nbecause it doesn't need to be up.\n\n632\n00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:54.000\nCuz normally once we have that up, right,\nthat's probably the last time after\n\n633\n00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.620\njust a few configurations options\nthat we need to be able to set it up.\n\n634\n00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.050\nI still need to set up things\nlike a username and password, but\n\n635\n00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:04.220\nthose are things that\nyou can easily set up.\n\n636\n00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.100\nAnd if you are using this in a production\nenvironment, we would change that IP\n\n637\n00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:13.430\naddress from a DHCP given\naddress to a static one.\n\n638\n00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.100\nThat's about the only thing that\nwe would normally need to do.\n\n639\n00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.240\nBut now that we have it up and\n\n640\n00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:21.460\ninstalled, that's the process that it\ntakes to get everything ready to go.\n\n641\n00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.090\nSo you do need to pay attention, but\n\n642\n00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:26.680\nonce you're actually done with that,\nyou have that, and now it's time for\n\n643\n00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.080\nus to move into some of the configuration\nand managing parts as well.\n\n644\n00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.840\nBut, that's great for another show.\n\n645\n00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.550\n>> All right, very good,\ngreat information.\n\n646\n00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.470\nNow in this episode some of the things\nthat we've looked at are the hardware\n\n647\n00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.180\nrequirements for the ESXi software.\n\n648\n00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.300\nWe've also looked at what\nare the host requirements,\n\n649\n00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.560\nwhat if you don't know\nwhat the requirements are?\n\n650\n00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.780\nRemember we spent some time\nlooking at the website so\n\n651\n00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:51.240\nthat you can get some of that information\nand they've got a relatively good database\n\n652\n00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.190\nwith a lot of information out there,\nso make sure that you check it out.\n\n653\n00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:57.643\nWe've also showed you how to do\nthe installation of the software as well.\n\n654\n00:35:57.643 --> 00:35:59.590\nRonnie, any final thoughts?\n\n655\n00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.670\n>> Well, just getting started, right,\nmay be a little bit frustrated.\n\n656\n00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.640\nIt's frustrating I should say because\nit does tend to pause an do some\n\n657\n00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.600\ndifferent things and when you reboot,\n\n658\n00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.230\nit does actually still have to\nfinish the installation part.\n\n659\n00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.250\nSo you may get a little bit flustered and\n\n660\n00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.340\na little bit upset that it's not\ndoing everything that you want, but\n\n661\n00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.550\nif you'll give it enough time, a little\nbit of patience really goes a long way.\n\n662\n00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.800\nWe still have a lot to go through, right?\n\n663\n00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.250\nWe still need to set up\nthat management side of it.\n\n664\n00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.000\nWe still need to configure the IP\naddress and the authorization.\n\n665\n00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.920\nBut at least getting the installation\npart shows that it's actually up and\n\n666\n00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.480\nready to go.\n\n667\n00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.190\nIf you're connected to\nthe network at this point,\n\n668\n00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.470\nthen you're ready to proceed\non to that very next step.\n\n669\n00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:40.930\n>> All right, great information, and\n\n670\n00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.110\nit does look like we've come\nto the end of another episode.\n\n671\n00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.305\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n672\n00:36:46.305 --> 00:36:48.280\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n673\n00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.100\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n674\n00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.449\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n675\n00:36:51.449 --> 00:36:56.790\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.120\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.660\nIn this episode we're gonna be\ncontinuing along in virtualization.\n\n5\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.200\nAnd one of the things that we're gonna\ntalking about today is configuring\n\n6\n00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.650\nESXi virtualization technologies.\n\n7\n00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.180\nNow, in a previous episode we showed\nyou how to install the software.\n\n8\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.350\nWell, now we've got the software\ninstalled, but by itself it's not gonna do\n\n9\n00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.880\nus any good until we get it configured so\nthat we can bring this machine online, and\n\n10\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.950\nwe have Ronnie Wong here\nto help us out with that.\n\n11\n00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.110\nRonnie, how are you doing today?\n\n12\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.080\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.150\nAs we continue to take a look at VMWare's\nESXi, the installation process itself\n\n14\n00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.110\ndid take a little bit of\na challenge in terms of time.\n\n15\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.880\nRight, we're actually not used to\nwaiting as long as we have to.\n\n16\n00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.730\nBut getting it installed is really kind\nof the bare minimum part that we need.\n\n17\n00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.740\nBut the problem is right now it's\nactually working just as a paper weight.\n\n18\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.180\nThe very fact that we got it installed\nis a great accomplishment, but\n\n19\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.370\nI cannot directly, by sitting at that\nmachine, load up a virtual machine or\n\n20\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.000\neven create a virtual machine directly.\n\n21\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000\nWhat I now need to do is\nconfigure the other side of it, so\n\n22\n00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.880\nnow that Type I Hypervisor\nis sitting there on my desk.\n\n23\n00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.450\nAnd it's actually turned on,\nand ready for me to connect to.\n\n24\n00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.046\nAnd when I connect to it,\n\n25\n00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:27.686\nit's gonna give me the options to\nbegin to get started with ESXi, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.110\nSo that is what we're gonna do.\n\n27\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.060\nSo here it is.\n\n28\n00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.990\nI'm actually using my\nWindows machine here.\n\n29\n00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.500\nSo I'm running Windows 10.\n\n30\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.200\nAnd I now need to get\nconnected to my ESXi server.\n\n31\n00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.040\nAnd the way that we do that is actually\njust through the web browser and\n\n32\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.060\nthe IP address that we saw\nin that previous episode.\n\n33\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.940\nIf I go ahead and\nclick on the web browser, I'm gonna go and\n\n34\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.700\nuse this fancy new browser in\nWindows 10 called Microsoft Edge.\n\n35\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.900\nAnd in that search address,\nI'm simply gonna type in 10.1.230.183,\n\n36\n00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.490\nwhich is actually the IP\naddress of my ESXi server.\n\n37\n00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.620\nNow, I could have changed that particular\naddress when I first installed it.\n\n38\n00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.900\nBut right now I've just left it as\nis just to make it simple here.\n\n39\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.850\nAnd then I'm simply gonna press Enter, and\n\n40\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.320\nthis is the first thing\nit's going to give me.\n\n41\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.364\nThe server that was actually installed,\nonce I actually installed ESXi,\n\n42\n00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:26.084\nit also has, of course, a web server\non it that's actually ready for\n\n43\n00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:27.452\nme to make a connection.\n\n44\n00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:31.500\nNow, it's not designed for us to\nactually be running interactive content.\n\n45\n00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.710\nIt's really just designed for\n\n46\n00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.090\nme to connect and get access to the\nutilities that I need to do my install.\n\n47\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.020\nSo even though it says there's a problem\nwith this website's certificate,\n\n48\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.320\nit's inside of my network.\n\n49\n00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.750\nI know exactly the IP address I went to.\n\n50\n00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.930\nSo I'm simply gonna continue this webpage,\neven though it's not recommended.\n\n51\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.914\nNow when I do that,\nat this particular page here,\n\n52\n00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:57.197\na lot of times it was the very\nfirst time you connected.\n\n53\n00:02:57.197 --> 00:03:01.485\nIt will pop up a little dialog\nbox that asks if you want\n\n54\n00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:05.590\nto install the certificate\nfrom that web server.\n\n55\n00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.530\nThat way you don't get prompted\nabout that each and every time.\n\n56\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.550\nAnd you can do that, but\n\n57\n00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.420\nit's not necessary unless you\nreally just need to have it done.\n\n58\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.940\nSo notice that I am now connected in and\nthere it is.\n\n59\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.590\nThere is a static webpage that\nyou're seeing right here and\n\n60\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.890\nit says to get started, there's\na couple of things that I need to do.\n\n61\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.570\nAnd I have two options, and\n\n62\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.300\nthat's what we're gonna look at\nright here on the left hand side.\n\n63\n00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.150\nI can download the VSphere client for\nWindows.\n\n64\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.630\nOkay, if I'm running a Windows operating\nsystem that is definitely the one that I\n\n65\n00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.368\nwant to install, but remember that\nwhen I choose this option here.\n\n66\n00:03:39.368 --> 00:03:44.398\nIt actually designed to allow me to\ninstall it on a single system such as my\n\n67\n00:03:44.398 --> 00:03:50.030\nworkstation and designed to really\nonly connect to one ESX server.\n\n68\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.400\nNow when I say that doesn't\nmatter which one, no.\n\n69\n00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.560\nSo in theory I could actually go ahead and\nalso install ESX on another server, but\n\n70\n00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.700\nthen I can go to another workstation and\ninstall this client and\n\n71\n00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.420\nactually connect to that one and\nthis is designed to only connect to one.\n\n72\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.540\nNow I can put that on\nunlimited number of servers\n\n73\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.800\nas long as I'm willing only to connect\nto one server through that one client.\n\n74\n00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.160\nBut, if you have multiple VMware\nservers that you are actually\n\n75\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.290\nmanaging for your company or for yourself,\nyou're gonna choose a second option,\n\n76\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.730\nand this one is the one\nthat's called the vCenter.\n\n77\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.910\nI think I was calling it\nvServer in earlier episodes.\n\n78\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.090\nBut it is called vCenter.\n\n79\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.870\nvCenter allows us to go to manage,\nwell multiple ESXi\n\n80\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.950\nservers instead from one\nmanagement console, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.800\nSo this one is actually the one\nthat you will end up seeing\n\n82\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.540\non most production environments because\n\n83\n00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.280\nusually running one virtualization server\nis probably not going to be enough.\n\n84\n00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.960\nYou're probably gonna run\nat least two of them for\n\n85\n00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.390\nthe idea of redundancy if you need to.\n\n86\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.830\nSo those are the two options\nthat we have ahead of us,\n\n87\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.596\nwhen we actually are going\nto make a choice here.\n\n88\n00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:09.090\nSo being able to actually understand that\nI can connect directly to that server and\n\n89\n00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.230\nget access to these utilities and I can\ndownload it from that server as well.\n\n90\n00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.450\nSo I choose this first one up here.\n\n91\n00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.690\nI click on the link, and\nnow you can see it's going to go ahead and\n\n92\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.366\nstart downloading that\nparticular software for us.\n\n93\n00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:25.480\nNow, that's downloading in the background,\nI've already got it downloaded here so\n\n94\n00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.820\nI'm gonna cancel it out.\n\n95\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.460\nBut you can actually leave it there.\n\n96\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.130\nBut notice that there's also a couple of\nother options that we want to explore.\n\n97\n00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.750\nvSphere remote command line.\n\n98\n00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.380\nThe remote command line allows\nyou to use the command line tools\n\n99\n00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.120\nto manage vSphere from a client machine.\n\n100\n00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.660\nThese tools can be used in shell scripts\nto automate day to day applications.\n\n101\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.570\nSo it gives me that ability as\nwell to do something like that.\n\n102\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.160\nNow when we start talking about something\nlike that, now you're talking about\n\n103\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.030\nscripting out some of the things that\nyou need to do inside of vSphere.\n\n104\n00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.110\nSo instead of us actually downloading\na nice GUI client that we can interact\n\n105\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.150\nwith it, it's saying hey,\nthere's a full command line utility\n\n106\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.160\nthat has it in the form of what\nwe call a virtual appliance.\n\n107\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.080\nNow what the heck is\na virtual appliance here?\n\n108\n00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:19.410\nA virtual appliance is essentially\na prebuilt VM, a prebuilt virtual machine.\n\n109\n00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.720\nAnd its whole design is to run this\nidea of this virtual command line for\n\n110\n00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.040\nus without us ever having to worry\nabout where it's actually gonna run or\n\n111\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.350\nwhat it's gonna do.\n\n112\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.150\nYou end up seeing that also in this\n\n113\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.800\nVMware center download that's also\ndesigned to download as an ISO.\n\n114\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.780\nNow, when we installed ESXi,\nwe actually downloaded and\n\n115\n00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.170\nISO and actually made an installation\nthat really was a Hypervisor.\n\n116\n00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.740\nSo this vCenter itself is also\nable to be run as its own vCenter,\n\n117\n00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.620\nin other words, its own virtual machine if\nit needs to, and install that way as well.\n\n118\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.700\nSo you also have an installer here.\n\n119\n00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.380\nThe other one of course is\na web based data store browser.\n\n120\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.480\nNow the data store is\nthe storage that is available\n\n121\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.630\non that ESX server right then and there.\n\n122\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.855\nIf I wanted to browse into that server,\nI click on this link, and\n\n123\n00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:18.238\nnow it's gonna ask me for\na username and password.\n\n124\n00:07:20.477 --> 00:07:22.158\nAnd let's see if it\nactually gives me access or\n\n125\n00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:23.950\nI typed in the wrong password here.\n\n126\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.680\nAnd if it actually allows\nme to get in there,\n\n127\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.940\nit will actually see, so\nit did not like that one.\n\n128\n00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.120\nLet's see if it actually\nallows me in on this one here.\n\n129\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.180\nSo I actually had to create\na couple of different passwords,\n\n130\n00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.340\ncuz it wasn't doing that, or\nI'm probably just mistyping it.\n\n131\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.720\nBut it would give me a kind of\na browser structure file there\n\n132\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.450\nto be able to do that as well.\n\n133\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.770\nSo it's not gonna let me get in there for\nright now.\n\n134\n00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.620\nBut as you actually see it,\nright, that's all you'll see.\n\n135\n00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.555\nIt's just, it looks like Explorer a little\nbit, very basic, and then you can,\n\n136\n00:07:55.555 --> 00:07:59.710\nfrom that point here, upload files\ninto that server if you need to.\n\n137\n00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.360\nAs well as be able to\nmanage files around there.\n\n138\n00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.084\nSo if you're moving VMs from\none ESX server to another one,\n\n139\n00:08:06.084 --> 00:08:10.580\nyou can do that even from just\na simple web interface if needed.\n\n140\n00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.920\nAnd of course there's some other ones\nhere for developers that are creating\n\n141\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.440\napplications that will help you\nto be able to also manage ESXi.\n\n142\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.220\nSo once you actually have\nthat thing downloaded,\n\n143\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.790\nthen you simply run the installer.\n\n144\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.140\nI told you I already downloaded it, let me\nverify that I know exactly where it is.\n\n145\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.340\nLet me see if I put it in my downloads.\n\n146\n00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.110\nIf I didn't, I know where I put it,\nwhich is not there.\n\n147\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:41.966\nIt is inside my VMware shared folder, and\nthen if I scroll down here, this is it.\n\n148\n00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:44.700\nThis is the VMware-viclient, and\n\n149\n00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.850\nI'm simply gonna double-click on that and\nget the installer to work, and\n\n150\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.350\nwe'll simply follow the instructions\nthrough on installing.\n\n151\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.920\nNow once it installs it's gonna\nactually bring up a nice interface and\n\n152\n00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.350\nwe're gonna explore the interface so\nthat we understand what we're seeing, and\n\n153\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.160\nthen we'll actually see\nthe management features.\n\n154\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.350\nNow remember that we're actually on\na different machine than that ESX server,\n\n155\n00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.290\nand the whole thing is actually connecting\nvia the network connection instead,\n\n156\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.800\nand this is why it's very important\nthat we have a network connection.\n\n157\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.700\nIt's also why the best practice for\nour ESX server,\n\n158\n00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.570\nthough, is to actually assign\nit a static IP address.\n\n159\n00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.070\nIf we leave it at DHCP, in theory,\nthere's a chance that that\n\n160\n00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.240\nIP address could change and\nthen we have to go and find it again, but\n\n161\n00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.060\nI just left it here because I know that\nnobody else has that address right now.\n\n162\n00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.360\nSo I'm simply gonna follow\nthrough the installation process\n\n163\n00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.790\nexcept the end user licensing agreement,\nand then leave it at the default path for\n\n164\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.540\nthe install as I click Next through here.\n\n165\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.260\nAnd now it's gonna begin\nthe installation process, and\n\n166\n00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.360\nit has to install in a few different\nitems to make sure that this works.\n\n167\n00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.210\nThe key here of course is the Visual C++,\nand so this process here might\n\n168\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.570\nactually several minutes before we\nfinish the install process as well.\n\n169\n00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.690\nit just finished its installation process,\n\n170\n00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.280\nso I had to install a few things which\ndelayed it just a little bit here.\n\n171\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.880\nBut then I'm gonna go ahead and\nclick Finish, and\n\n172\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.449\non my desktop you should see the icon or\nthe shortcut for\n\n173\n00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:19.220\nVMware vSphere client, and I'm simply\ngoing to start the actual vSphere client.\n\n174\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.040\nAnd here is where we need a little\nbit of information here, right?\n\n175\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.400\nSo on that IP address unless I really\ncan't remember what my password is,\n\n176\n00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.490\nwhich is very possible\nat this point in time,\n\n177\n00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.268\ncuz I'm getting a little\nbit more paranoid here.\n\n178\n00:10:31.268 --> 00:10:33.904\n[LAUGH] All right, let's see.\n\n179\n00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:40.026\nSo it allows me to connect in, so\nthere's that certificate warning so\n\n180\n00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:41.180\nyou might also see this.\n\n181\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.378\nI'm gonna ignore it for right now and\nlet's see if it gives me a connection.\n\n182\n00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:46.188\nIf it doesn't I'll need to go and\n\n183\n00:10:46.188 --> 00:10:49.790\nfigure out what my actual\npassword is going to be here.\n\n184\n00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.590\nSo on this connection it is now taking its\ntime here, but we should end up doing it.\n\n185\n00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:02.762\nAnd let me see, let me try one other\npassword before I try and see here.\n\n186\n00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:05.064\nAt least, I think this is the password\nI had to change it to, and\n\n187\n00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.639\nit asked me if I would\nchange the password.\n\n188\n00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:08.720\nNow it looks like it's loading,\nthere we go.\n\n189\n00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.080\nSo you can tell right away that I've\nactually ran this addition right now\n\n190\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.370\nas an evaluation license.\n\n191\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:20.800\nNow, I just installed it, so you can go\nout and download that evaluation copy,\n\n192\n00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.260\nand then you can insert a license\nin after that that will allow it to\n\n193\n00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.330\nactually be there for the length of time,\nwhatever your license is going to be.\n\n194\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.790\nSo if I clicked here I could\nassign a license to that host, and\n\n195\n00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.820\nnotice it's actually going to here.\n\n196\n00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.490\nAnd then you would actually get that\nlicense and mine's actually inside,\n\n197\n00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.580\nI'm not gonna type that on the screen for\nyou right now.\n\n198\n00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.720\nBut you can see that this is\nwhere you'd actually go ahead and\n\n199\n00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.850\ndo that hosted evaluation and actually\nfill in the license that you need to.\n\n200\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.473\nEverything would be up and good.\n\n201\n00:11:51.473 --> 00:11:56.153\nSo here is the vSphere client,\nand I am connected to,\n\n202\n00:11:56.153 --> 00:12:01.357\nif I select inventory, that 10.1.230.183.\n\n203\n00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:04.506\nSo it allows me to have access to, well,\n\n204\n00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:09.047\none particular server, and\nthen if I select that server,\n\n205\n00:12:09.047 --> 00:12:15.620\nnotice I have these different tabs that\nshow me the details of that machine.\n\n206\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.770\nSo here it is just describing what\nthat host machine is all about, and\n\n207\n00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.830\nthen if I wanted to get started right\naway about creating a virtual machine,\n\n208\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.340\nwe could do it from right there.\n\n209\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.460\nIt gives me summary information, so I can\nsee all the resources that are available,\n\n210\n00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.448\nand right now there's nothing\nthat's actually fault tolerant.\n\n211\n00:12:32.448 --> 00:12:35.560\nNotice that there's actually some\ndifferent commands that I have access to\n\n212\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.020\nfrom this menu.\n\n213\n00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.060\nAny virtual machines I've created,\n\n214\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.380\nhere's one that I actually I\ndid create just as an example.\n\n215\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.270\nWe're actually gonna walk through and\ncreate our own as well.\n\n216\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.670\nAnd of course resource allocation,\nhow many or\n\n217\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.980\nhow am I gonna divide the resources\nup between my virtual machines?\n\n218\n00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.590\nIf I want to right now, notice that I've\ngot unlimited on this CPU right now.\n\n219\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.720\nShares are normal,\nit actually can use 100% of it.\n\n220\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.160\nPerformance wise,\nwe also have some live monitoring,\n\n221\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.410\nsome additional configuration and\nbeing able to see some logging,\n\n222\n00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:14.350\nof course, users, events and\neven additional permissions here.\n\n223\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.330\nSo the basic idea is fairly simple, right?\n\n224\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.940\nAs more and more machines get populated, I\njust simply select on the next machine and\n\n225\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:27.470\nthe next machine and the next machine, and\nthen, we can go ahead and continue on.\n\n226\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.050\nI should be able to manage each and\n\n227\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.790\nevery one of them the way that\nwe actually want to, okay?\n\n228\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.600\nSo remember that when we talk about\ncreating a virtual machine, right,\n\n229\n00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.480\nit's not really talking about the idea\nof installing an operating system yet.\n\n230\n00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.711\nIt's just talking about\nthe actual hardware, so\n\n231\n00:13:42.711 --> 00:13:44.153\nlet me give you an example here.\n\n232\n00:13:44.153 --> 00:13:48.504\nSo here is one that I did create just\na little bit earlier called the test02.\n\n233\n00:13:48.504 --> 00:13:53.133\nAnd if i click on the Summary,\nI can now see that this is designed for\n\n234\n00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:56.540\nserver 2008, it's actually VMware 11.\n\n235\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.470\nIt's got one virtual CPU and\nabout 4 gigs of memory, and\n\n236\n00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.180\ncurrently the VMware tools\nare not installed on it.\n\n237\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.730\nSo that is just what the VM is,\nit's the configuration file\n\n238\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.850\nthat represents what the physical\nhardware that were on here.\n\n239\n00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.540\nThen later on we'll go back in and\n\n240\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.450\ninstall the operating system\nafter we configure that.\n\n241\n00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.003\nSo, let's go ahead and\ncreate a virtual machine and\n\n242\n00:14:21.003 --> 00:14:26.116\nthat will kinda be the easiest one for\nus to go ahead and take a look at doing.\n\n243\n00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:29.867\nSo when we talk about creating\nthe virtual machine, let's go ahead and\n\n244\n00:14:29.867 --> 00:14:33.992\nuse the menu that they give us here,\nwhich is, I'm gonna click on the server,\n\n245\n00:14:33.992 --> 00:14:36.805\ngetting started and\nthen I'm gonna scroll down, and\n\n246\n00:14:36.805 --> 00:14:40.331\nnotice the most basic task here is\nto create a new virtual machine.\n\n247\n00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:42.445\nI'm gonna click on the link and\n\n248\n00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:46.276\nthen it's gonna give me this\nvirtual machine console.\n\n249\n00:14:46.276 --> 00:14:51.537\nIf you actually did take a look back\nat a couple of different episodes,\n\n250\n00:14:51.537 --> 00:14:57.600\nespecially the one that you and I, we\nactually went over in VMware Workstation,\n\n251\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.987\nokay, the layout is\nfairly similar to the way\n\n252\n00:15:00.987 --> 00:15:05.742\nthat the VMware Workstation lays\nout in creating an actual VM.\n\n253\n00:15:05.742 --> 00:15:07.889\n>> One of the things that I\nwas gonna say there, Ronnie,\n\n254\n00:15:07.889 --> 00:15:09.950\nit looks like you got typical and custom.\n\n255\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.070\nNow a lot of these software installers,\nmaybe not in the virtualization\n\n256\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:18.440\ntechnologies I've seen is that typical\ninstall if you just wanna, almost like\n\n257\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:23.180\na template, a fast way to create a virtual\nmachine, get it online you can do that.\n\n258\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.440\nYou don't have to go through\na lot of configurations here.\n\n259\n00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.070\nBut if you wanna get really granular on\nwhat you do and configure each individual\n\n260\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:35.070\ncomponent, you can go with the longer\nroute, the more scenic approach giving you\n\n261\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.240\nmore that flexibility and customizations\nthere through well, what it says, custom.\n\n262\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.810\n>> Right, the very fact is you're probably\ngonna use the typical route if you're\n\n263\n00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.670\ntrying to get something up and\nrunning as quickly as you can.\n\n264\n00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:50.192\nOn the custom one it may be because\nyou already got the hardware specs\n\n265\n00:15:50.192 --> 00:15:52.267\nspecced out for what you want.\n\n266\n00:15:52.267 --> 00:15:54.893\nYou're not actually having\nto make it on your own,\n\n267\n00:15:54.893 --> 00:15:58.741\nyou're having to do it according to\nsomebody's policy in the way that they\n\n268\n00:15:58.741 --> 00:16:01.566\nwant you to create the actual\nvirtual machine itself.\n\n269\n00:16:01.566 --> 00:16:06.750\nSo we're gonna leave it at the Typical at\nthis point and click Next here, all right?\n\n270\n00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.420\nNow once I do that,\nI'm gonna also give it a name as well.\n\n271\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.880\nAnd so on this one, and I will create\nkind of the same idea here with\n\n272\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.970\nServer 2008 machine, but\nwe'll call this one Lab05.\n\n273\n00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:22.360\nI'm just making up numbers\nright now instead, and\n\n274\n00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.530\nnow it says it can contain up to 80\ncharacters and it should be unique.\n\n275\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.320\nThe reason again is descriptive\nnames are actually fairly important\n\n276\n00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.090\nwhen you actually start dealing with\nlet's say 50 or 60 servers, right.\n\n277\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.140\nAnd you might, or 50 or\n60 virtual machines.\n\n278\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.360\nAnd you might actually want to\ninclude in instead some type of\n\n279\n00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.840\nnaming convention which might include in\na location, as well as the type of server.\n\n280\n00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.560\nAnd maybe even the operating\nsystem name if you needed to,\n\n281\n00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.010\nand whether or\nnot it's an addition of that.\n\n282\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.300\nSo for example, even though we tend to do\nit in a small environment where we might\n\n283\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.120\nname it something like DNS one,\nand DNS two, and DNS three.\n\n284\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.140\nThat might work as long as your whole\norganization is centered around that, but\n\n285\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:07.090\nwhat if you have, well,\ngeographically distributed DNS servers\n\n286\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.190\nthat you're naming DNS one,\nDNS two, DNS three.\n\n287\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.000\nWell you might include in the north,\nsouth, east, and\n\n288\n00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.240\nthen you might include in you know\nwhat department it might be in.\n\n289\n00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.340\nSo you do want to make sure that you\ndo add in the name that you need.\n\n290\n00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.790\n>> Yeah,\none of the companies that I worked for\n\n291\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.920\nthe naming convention would\nhave been the domain.\n\n292\n00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.210\nIn this case, they were running a domain.\n\n293\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.430\nSo the first part of the name\nwould have been the domain.\n\n294\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.110\nSo they could tell right\naway which domain,\n\n295\n00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.900\nActive Directory domain more\nspecifically it belonged to.\n\n296\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.170\nAnd then the next portion of the host name\nwould be for instance, CL for a client,\n\n297\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.820\nor SVR for a server, and then the final\npart would just be the number.\n\n298\n00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.490\nSo like you were mentioning DNS01.\n\n299\n00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.437\nI might have an 01, 02, 03.\n\n300\n00:17:44.437 --> 00:17:48.653\nIt could tell me that we're here in\nGainesville, if we're in another state, or\n\n301\n00:17:48.653 --> 00:17:50.700\neven a completely different country.\n\n302\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.830\nRight away, in that name, looking through\nthat list, you could tell what domain,\n\n303\n00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.630\nwhat it was, a client versus a server,\nand then what number it was.\n\n304\n00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.710\n>> Yeah, and that will help out,\n\n305\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.242\nespecially because a lot of times\ninside of this virtual environment,\n\n306\n00:18:03.242 --> 00:18:07.950\nif you start actually running multiple ESX\nservers together, where they're clustered.\n\n307\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.910\nIn other words, they start sharing\nresources between those machines,\n\n308\n00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.170\nyou do not actually physically know\nwhere that machine is going to reside.\n\n309\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.780\nBut if you actually know that it's\nsuppose to service a particular site,\n\n310\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.650\nit really does help.\n\n311\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.830\nThat way you can pull\nall that information and\n\n312\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.940\nit's actually gonna be able\nto be identified by the name.\n\n313\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.060\n>> So we could say something like,\nfor instance, yeah,\n\n314\n00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.090\nthe name that you put here is arbitrary,\nbut when it comes down to it,\n\n315\n00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.810\nit doesn't sound like that\nwould be good advice.\n\n316\n00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.920\nYou'd want something easily identifiable,\nuser-friendly, so you can just take\n\n317\n00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.690\na quick look at whichever 1 to 100 or\nmore of these VMs are in that list.\n\n318\n00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.480\nKnow exactly what machine it is,\n\n319\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.310\nwhat role, what functionality\nit's performing on your networks.\n\n320\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.090\nAnd you don't have to sit there and\nstress over that,\n\n321\n00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.920\nreducing some of\nthe administrative complexities.\n\n322\n00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.510\n>> That is true here.\n\n323\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.010\nSo let's go ahead and select Next and\nthen we will click here.\n\n324\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.880\nAnd now notice it's saying, hey where\nis this actually going to be stored.\n\n325\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.550\nNow this is gonna become more and\n\n326\n00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.730\nmore important depending on where that\nESX server is gonna be installed.\n\n327\n00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.340\nMine, there's only one hard drive on it.\n\n328\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.800\nSo that's the only one I have access to.\n\n329\n00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.290\nBut in a real production environment,\n\n330\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.120\nyou might see multiple\ndifferent storage devices.\n\n331\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.710\nAnd so you need to make sure you get\nthe name of that device that you\n\n332\n00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:24.210\nneed to go ahead and be able to put,\nto add in it in there.\n\n333\n00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.860\nNow, that doesn't mean that it will\nactually reside there forever.\n\n334\n00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.050\nIf that particular\nenvironment is clustered,\n\n335\n00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.020\nit can move it around to where\nit needs to move it around, but\n\n336\n00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.070\nwhat you're actually going to is\nwhat we call a home server, right.\n\n337\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.100\nYou're actually saying, hey,\nlook, if nothing else, right,\n\n338\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.610\nif all else is actually playing,\n\n339\n00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:44.390\nthis is gonna become the home that it's\nactually gonna stick itself to instead.\n\n340\n00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.430\nBut for me, I only have one,\nand that's perfectly fine.\n\n341\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.750\nBut if you do have multiple ones,\n\n342\n00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.210\nyou do need to make sure you pick one or\nthe other.\n\n343\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.520\nSometimes, it really doesn't matter,\nbut in the end,\n\n344\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.200\nyou're just assigning it\nthat idea of the home,\n\n345\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.910\nif you do have multiple storage devices\nthat you have to worry about, all right.\n\n346\n00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.770\nSo I'm just gonna select\nthe first one that's there,\n\n347\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.360\nbecause it's the only one that\nI have there, that makes sense.\n\n348\n00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.270\nClick Next, and now it's asking me about\nthe operating system because I picked that\n\n349\n00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.150\ntypical install,\nit's asking me right away.\n\n350\n00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.250\nIf I pick custom, I could select to later\non to actually choose which one here.\n\n351\n00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.590\nThe whole goal here, of course,\nis to go ahead and actually pre-assign\n\n352\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:25.310\nlike the RAM and the hard drive space\nthat we need and maybe even the CPU.\n\n353\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.850\nSo I'm gonna choose this Windows here.\n\n354\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:32.227\nAnd we choose this Server 2008 R2 cuz\nI have evaluation copy of that one,\n\n355\n00:20:32.227 --> 00:20:34.530\nso I can install that one.\n\n356\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.890\nAnd then I'm gonna click Next here\non the guest operating system.\n\n357\n00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.790\nAnd now it's asking me how many\nNICs do I want to assign, so\n\n358\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.090\nhow many network adapters here.\n\n359\n00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:47.660\nBy default, it gives me four, I believe I\nknow I can actually create more than this\n\n360\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.692\nbut this is the one that you want.\n\n361\n00:20:48.692 --> 00:20:52.712\nIt says if supported by\nthe virtual machine version, so\n\n362\n00:20:52.712 --> 00:20:57.230\nit actually depends on\nthe actual VMware Workstation.\n\n363\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.120\nMore than four NICs can be\nadded after it's created and\n\n364\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.370\nyou only have to edit the settings,\nyou can add in more.\n\n365\n00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.130\nRight now, you're actually seeing\na couple of different things that we\n\n366\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.700\nreally haven't seen before in\nthe other editions here and\n\n367\n00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.182\nit maybe because I just\ndidn't emphasize it.\n\n368\n00:21:12.182 --> 00:21:15.750\nNICs are not something that we tend to\nvirtualize off of every single PC and\n\n369\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.440\nthe reason why you don't\nintend to see a lot of that\n\n370\n00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.100\nis because most them do\nexactly the same thing.\n\n371\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.350\nBut the very fact is, there are so\nmany different manufacturers\n\n372\n00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.740\nout there that it's almost impossible\nto virtualize every single one of them.\n\n373\n00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.150\nSo instead, what VMware and a lot of\nthe vendors do is that they say, hey,\n\n374\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:39.350\nhere is the most generic types of network\nadapters that you're likely to see here.\n\n375\n00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:44.229\nAnd this one also based on the name E1000\nis telling me like it's an ethernet,\n\n376\n00:21:44.229 --> 00:21:46.640\nbut probably a gigabit\nethernet adapter and\n\n377\n00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.690\nit's based off of the most generic\nhardware that's out there.\n\n378\n00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:50.320\nAnd then, of course,\n\n379\n00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:56.810\nyou have these actual virtualized type\nof network adapters instead as well.\n\n380\n00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.678\nNow, you have the option to actually\nconnect it when you power on or\n\n381\n00:22:00.678 --> 00:22:03.873\nyou can actually leave it\ndisconnected if you want to.\n\n382\n00:22:03.873 --> 00:22:07.561\nSo I normally actually just leave it at\nits default, which is powered on, and\n\n383\n00:22:07.561 --> 00:22:11.250\nnow here's the name of that network\nthat it's gonna connect to.\n\n384\n00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.960\nNow that network actually represents\nwhat we call a virtual switch.\n\n385\n00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.700\nSo just like you would actually\ntake three or four machines and\n\n386\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.320\nactually pull a physical switch and\nput them in the center and tie.\n\n387\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:27.800\nOr have each one have a cable and\nplug it into that switch, well this one,\n\n388\n00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.550\nyou simply do it by the name.\n\n389\n00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.690\nIf I create four or five different VMs and\nI want to attach them to the same network,\n\n390\n00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.370\nI just simply go out and I look for\nthe name that's been created right here.\n\n391\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.400\nAnd I just assign it that name, and that\nwill automatically put those networks or\n\n392\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.870\nthose machines, those VMs,\non that same network as well.\n\n393\n00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.400\nI'm gonna click Next here and\nnow here's where the first time we're\n\n394\n00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.680\nactually starting to see some\nunusual terminology, right?\n\n395\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.140\nAs I load this VM, and\nit's actually gonna be a Windows VM,\n\n396\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.050\nit actually says\nthe Virtual Hard Drive is 40 gigs,\n\n397\n00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.690\nI can change that number depending on what\nI want, I'm gonna leave it at the default.\n\n398\n00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.166\nBut now we have this weird wording here.\n\n399\n00:23:06.166 --> 00:23:13.240\nThick Provision Lazy Zeroed,\n[LAUGH] that sounds awesome.\n\n400\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.750\nThick Provision Eager Zeroed,\nnow that sounds even more confusing.\n\n401\n00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.410\nAnd then Thin Provision,\nwell that's weird.\n\n402\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.370\nTwo thick provisionings and\none thin provision,\n\n403\n00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.240\nwhat the heck is this about, okay?\n\n404\n00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.560\nWell, notice the default.\n\n405\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.690\nThe default's exactly what you and\nI would normally think.\n\n406\n00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.940\nIf we are gonna create just\na regular environment, right, for\n\n407\n00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.690\na PC, that we need to install\nan operating system on,\n\n408\n00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.060\nthink about what you have to\ndo to the hard drive, okay?\n\n409\n00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.540\nNormally, for that hard drive,\nright, there's no file system on it.\n\n410\n00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.730\nYou gotta put a file system on it and\nready to be able to go, okay?\n\n411\n00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:51.500\nSo in that regular one, thick provision\nhere says, look, we're gonna do this here.\n\n412\n00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.518\nWe're gonna take that hard drive but\n\n413\n00:23:53.518 --> 00:23:57.629\nwe're only gonna provision what we\nneed to install the operating system.\n\n414\n00:23:57.629 --> 00:24:01.011\nSo even if I were to give it\nlet's say a terabyte hard drive,\n\n415\n00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:05.071\nif it only really takes 40 gigs to\ninstall the hard drive We're really\n\n416\n00:24:05.071 --> 00:24:07.930\nonly gonna provision and\nonly zero out 40 gigs.\n\n417\n00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:12.120\nWe're gonna leave the rest of it really\nunpartitioned at that point, okay?\n\n418\n00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.970\nNow it doesn't mean that\nyou have to do it that way.\n\n419\n00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.070\nNotice I have this thick provision eager,\nwhich says, look,\n\n420\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.190\nif you actually tell me it's gonna be a\n400 gig hard drive, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n421\n00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.480\npartition what,\nthe entire 400 gigs here and\n\n422\n00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.590\nzero that whole thing out so\nI can actually write to it immediately.\n\n423\n00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:33.940\nSo normally the default is right here\ninstead, is that this is what they choose.\n\n424\n00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.610\nThin provisioning is just saying, look,\nI'll partition when I need to, but\n\n425\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.990\nI'm not gonna worry about actually\ndoing the rest of it as well.\n\n426\n00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:43.660\nSo those are the options that you have and\nI'm just gonna leave it at the default.\n\n427\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.410\nI'm gonna click Next here, and\n\n428\n00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:50.870\nnow it's giving me a nice summary\nof creating a virtual machine.\n\n429\n00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.060\nSo once I actually select that and\nsee everything, notice that I can also\n\n430\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.920\nedit the virtual machine before\nits completion if I need to.\n\n431\n00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.850\nIf I wanna go back and then change any of\nthe other options before its completion,\n\n432\n00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:07.110\nI'm just gonna click Continue, and now\nit's asking me about different properties,\n\n433\n00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.230\nif I want to adjust\nanything in terms of RAM.\n\n434\n00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.820\nAnd this one actually says four gigs, and\n\n435\n00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.970\nnotice that it says that this\nthe default recommended for\n\n436\n00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.530\nthat virtual machine as well,\nwhich is four gigs, that's pretty hefty.\n\n437\n00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.520\nMaximum, it says for\nbest performance though, eight gigs.\n\n438\n00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.451\nWell, I only have eight on this machine,\nso\n\n439\n00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:29.397\nI'm gonna reduce this down to two instead.\n\n440\n00:25:29.397 --> 00:25:33.530\nI can leave it at four cuz I'm not gonna\nrun the other one that I created there, so\n\n441\n00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.010\nI'll just leave it at\nthe default right there.\n\n442\n00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.840\nCPUs, we've talked about\nthis just briefly, but\n\n443\n00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.840\nnot too much in earlier\nvirtualization episodes.\n\n444\n00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.460\nThis is the one you have\nto be careful of too.\n\n445\n00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:49.410\nThe very fact is as long as your operating\nsystem can access more than one CPU\n\n446\n00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.170\nat a time, this is logical CPUs.\n\n447\n00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:56.400\nThen yes, you should actually configure\nthis to actually be more than one.\n\n448\n00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.860\nBut if your operating system and\nyour applications can't do it\n\n449\n00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.060\nthen setting it at more than one\nprobably isn't gonna be helpful.\n\n450\n00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.960\nMost of the time even with servers,\n\n451\n00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.630\nleaving it at one is\nprobably perfectly fine.\n\n452\n00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.980\nBecause a lot of times our\nservers that we tend to run,\n\n453\n00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.710\nunless it's something intensive like\na database server of some sort or\n\n454\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:20.570\nan email server, we really don't end up\nusing most of the CPU processes anyways,\n\n455\n00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.230\nso leaving it at one is probably\nnot gonna hurt us too much.\n\n456\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:27.490\nBut if I really want this to be\na higher performing machine,\n\n457\n00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.130\nI may say instead that here it is\non number of sockets on my machine.\n\n458\n00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.790\nLet's say it's a quad core processor and\nI'm gonna leave it at the virtual sockets\n\n459\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.220\nhere which is 1, here as well,\nnumber of cores is 4.\n\n460\n00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.650\nVirtual sockets if it's hyper threaded or\n\n461\n00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.810\nsomething we may do that or\nsomething like that here.\n\n462\n00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:53.810\nAnd there it is, number of cores here,\nyep, that's all I can do.\n\n463\n00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.410\nSo they actually just have it\nchanged around on sockets and\n\n464\n00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.710\nof course cores per socket as well.\n\n465\n00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:03.060\nSo I think I only have one actual sockets,\nand\n\n466\n00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.960\nthen that means that's a quad\ncore processor, there we go.\n\n467\n00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.550\nSo I had them backward when I was\ndoing this just a moment ago.\n\n468\n00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:15.040\nSo changing number of virtual CPUs after\nthe guest install might make it unstable.\n\n469\n00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.680\nSo they are saying, look,\nwe recommend that you set this up now but\n\n470\n00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.670\nremember it'll probably work just fine.\n\n471\n00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:25.210\nMost of the newer operating\nsystems can handle it perfectly.\n\n472\n00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.550\nThe video card, of course, you can specify\ncustom settings here, how many displays\n\n473\n00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:35.180\nyou want it to go across and even some\nother features here, CDs, you name it.\n\n474\n00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.150\nThere's several of them that we have,\nthat we can take a look at and see.\n\n475\n00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.480\nSo, once we have all that,\nI'm gonna go ahead and click Finish, and\n\n476\n00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.275\nnow you'll see that in my pane over\nhere on the left hand side, there it is.\n\n477\n00:27:48.275 --> 00:27:52.480\nThere's my representation\nof a new virtual machine.\n\n478\n00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.340\nAnd now this virtual machine, right,\n\n479\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:59.170\nhas all the hardware configuration that\nI told it that I want it to virtualize.\n\n480\n00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:03.590\nAt this point the only thing we're\ngonna do is we're gonna attach an ISO\n\n481\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.730\nto that virtual machine through its\nadapter, and then boot it up and\n\n482\n00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.110\nallow the install,\njust like we would on a physical machine.\n\n483\n00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:15.420\nJust like you sliding the DVD player\nout and you putting in an ISO or\n\n484\n00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.350\na DVD on there, like this one right here,\n\n485\n00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:23.040\nyou putting it in there and letting it\ninstall, that's the rest of the process.\n\n486\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.790\nAnd that's what we have to\ndo to get it up and running.\n\n487\n00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:29.260\nEven after that right, right, we still\na little bit of configuration to go, but\n\n488\n00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:33.410\nthat is what we would normally end up\ndoing, is actually creating that machine,\n\n489\n00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.290\nturning it on, making sure it actually\nis doing everything that we need to.\n\n490\n00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.020\n>> Well thank you, Ronnie.\n\n491\n00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:42.300\nSo we've looked in this episode at\nconfiguring the VMware ESXi interface.\n\n492\n00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.290\nWe've looked at connecting to the client\nafter you already have it installed, or\n\n493\n00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:50.700\nconnecting to the web interface I should\nsay, and then installing the client and\n\n494\n00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.170\nthen once the client's installed,\nexploring that client,\n\n495\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.530\naround that client a little bit.\n\n496\n00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.130\nI want you to keep in mind, remember,\nyou've got a Windows client and\n\n497\n00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.410\nas we've seen you also have a Linux\nclient, so you can use either or\n\n498\n00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.380\ndepending on what kind of\nmachine you're supporting.\n\n499\n00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:08.005\nWe've also shown you how to create\na VM inside of that client as well.\n\n500\n00:29:08.005 --> 00:29:09.438\nRonnie, got anything else for us today?\n\n501\n00:29:09.438 --> 00:29:12.810\n>> Well just kinda remember\nthat at least at the beginning,\n\n502\n00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:17.380\nright, we've really just showed you\nthe process of just installing the ESX and\n\n503\n00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:22.620\nthen figuring out how to connect to it and\ngetting started in building VMs.\n\n504\n00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.310\nWe still need to actually do a little\nbit more on the management side\n\n505\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.160\nin showing how a VM actually is\noperational inside of it and\n\n506\n00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.220\nthen doing a little bit\nof customization to it.\n\n507\n00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.432\nBut besides that though, you actually\nhave seen the majority of what we're so\n\n508\n00:29:36.432 --> 00:29:38.959\nwe're talking about managing\nVMs at this point, but\n\n509\n00:29:38.959 --> 00:29:41.901\nthat actually looks like it's gonna be for\nanother show Wes.\n\n510\n00:29:41.901 --> 00:29:42.482\n>> All right.\n\n511\n00:29:42.482 --> 00:29:43.340\n>> [CROSSTALK] I gonna talk too much.\n\n512\n00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.736\n>> [LAUGH] Very good, so I look forward to\nseeing the installation of the operating\n\n513\n00:29:46.736 --> 00:29:48.287\nsystem through the client itself.\n\n514\n00:29:48.287 --> 00:29:51.804\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n515\n00:29:51.804 --> 00:29:53.185\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n516\n00:29:53.185 --> 00:29:53.964\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n517\n00:29:53.964 --> 00:29:55.344\n>> And we'll see you next

Bryan.\n\n3\n00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:19.170\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\nbe continuing along in our\n\n4\n00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.030\ntopic of virtualization.\n\n5\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.940\nNow in previous episodes,\nwe've talked about a technology,\n\n6\n00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.710\na type one hypervisor known as ESXi.\n\n7\n00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.700\nWe've showed you how to\ninstall the software,\n\n8\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.870\nwe've also showed you how to configure\nthe software to bring those VMs online.\n\n9\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.200\nToday what we're gonna be looking at\nis how to manage your VMs in ESXi, and\n\n10\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.800\nwe have Ronnie Wong here for us.\n\n11\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.600\nHow you doing, Ronnie?\n\n12\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.580\n>> I'm doing fine.\n\n13\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.160\nAs we continue on taking a look at our\nseries here, kind of a miniseries and\n\n14\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.220\nthe overall virtualization technology\nfocusing in on of course VMware's ESXi,\n\n15\n00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.350\nor you might hear\nthe term vSphere as well.\n\n16\n00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.220\nSo we're actually dealing with that\nvSphere hypervisor and in a previous\n\n17\n00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.500\nepisode where we ended up leaving off\nwas that we had just created that\n\n18\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.740\nvirtual machine itself but we didn't get\na chance to install the operating system.\n\n19\n00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.530\nSo we did take a look just a little\nbit around inside of the management\n\n20\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.790\nconsole that we have.\n\n21\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.720\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nwhat we'll be dealing with today.\n\n22\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.130\nSo if you remember that ESXi right,\nit actually gets involved into\n\n23\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.030\ntwo different parts for us, one we have\nto install, essentially, the host server.\n\n24\n00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.290\nThe one way we actually\ninstall ESXi on and\n\n25\n00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.630\nthat when actually now becomes\nessentially, a standalone machine.\n\n26\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.370\nAfter the initial installation and\n\n27\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.160\nsome basic configuration, normally in\na production network most of the time\n\n28\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.000\nwe don't really ever\nhave to look at it again.\n\n29\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.110\nThe only time we really need to\ngo to that host machine again\n\n30\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.120\nis if there is something\nseriously wrong or\n\n31\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.440\nwe're actually having to reconfigure\nit for maybe another network.\n\n32\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.730\nBesides that though, the majority and\nthe management and the creation of VMs and\n\n33\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.720\nanything else that we're doing, really\nneeds to take place from a client machine,\n\n34\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.360\nand that means somewhere else.\n\n35\n00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.470\nSomewhere else on that network as long\nas we have network connections to that\n\n36\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.270\nserver, then we can actually\nconnect in and begin managing VM's.\n\n37\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.860\nAnd so\nlet's take a look at my machine here and\n\n38\n00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.550\nlet's make sure that we understand.\n\n39\n00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.350\nSo here it is.\n\n40\n00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.350\nOn this particular machine I've installed\nsomething called the vSphere client, and\n\n41\n00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.530\nthe vSphere client is\nfairly simply downloaded.\n\n42\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.370\nAnd you can actually download it directly\nfrom VMware itself or when you install\n\n43\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.050\nESXi, remember that you can go to\nthe web page that's on that server and\n\n44\n00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.890\nbegin the download process there and\nthen install it onto your machine.\n\n45\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.470\nSo remember that this particular type\nof hypervisor that we're talking about\n\n46\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.360\nactually really requires two different\nmachines so that we can manage it.\n\n47\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.050\nOne that hosts the machine,\n\n48\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.910\nand now an actual client that we're\nactually using software to manage it from.\n\n49\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.730\n>> Great.\nNow in that previous episode,\n\n50\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.750\nyou showed us that it was relatively\neasy to acquire the software.\n\n51\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.770\nYou have to pay attention\nto your licensing, but\n\n52\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.270\none of the things that you did mention is\nthat when it comes in to the preparation\n\n53\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.570\nfor your VMs, you really have to\nkinda think carefully about what\n\n54\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.870\nyou're gonna do when you build your VMs,\nwhat kinda software you're gonna have,\n\n55\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.860\nwhat operating system\nyou're gonna support.\n\n56\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.650\nIs it gonna be 32-bit,\nis it gonna be 64-bit?\n\n57\n00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.020\nSo, same thing here Ronnie,\n\n58\n00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.530\nwe're gonna have to make sure that\nif we're gonna configure and install\n\n59\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.620\nan operating system we kinda have to prep\nthat up before we even start, right?\n\n60\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.800\n>> You definitely wanna make sure that\nyou're doing that and the reason why,\n\n61\n00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.600\nis it's very easy to run out of\nresources that are available to you\n\n62\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.060\nif you're not monitoring this.\n\n63\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.300\nSo monitor it fairly closely, and the good\nthing is if you go out to the VMware\n\n64\n00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.675\nwebsite and you look up documentation on\nyour particular edition of vSphere or\n\n65\n00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:32.519\nESXI, what you're gonna find out is\nthat they normally have in their\n\n66\n00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.080\ndocumentation where they call\na little planning guide.\n\n67\n00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.760\nThat gives you that ability to\ngo ahead and write things out so\n\n68\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.830\nthat you know what it is that you're\nplanning for your guest machines.\n\n69\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.300\nSo if we go back to my machine here,\n\n70\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.680\nlet's pick up where we left off\non the previous episode here.\n\n71\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.240\nWhat we had just done is we had\ncreated this Lab05 VM, right.\n\n72\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.590\nAnd we're trying to emphasize the very\nfact that the VM is not necessarily\n\n73\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.680\na running operating system, it is\nthe virtualized machine itself where it\n\n74\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.000\nstores all the hardware, and\nwhat it represents for us.\n\n75\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.550\nBut we didn't get to the point where we\nwere able to install the operating system.\n\n76\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.970\nSo if I were to turn that machine on\nright now it would actually really not\n\n77\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.370\ndo anything, but just kinda let me know\nthat there was no operating system found.\n\n78\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.650\nSo what do we need to do?\n\n79\n00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.570\nWe need to now go ahead and\n\n80\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.990\nactually begin the install process\nof an operating system onto this VM.\n\n81\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.960\nSo, let's show you how\nthat actually begins here.\n\n82\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.668\nSo with this Lab05 machine,\nlet me make sure I do that.\n\n83\n00:04:31.668 --> 00:04:34.140\nI'm gonna right-click on that machine and\n\n84\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.500\nthen I'm gonna go down to\nwhere it say Edit Settings.\n\n85\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.150\nIf I select Edit Settings, it's\nactually letting me know that hey look,\n\n86\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.150\nthere's some different settings here,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n87\n00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.370\nYou can also restrict\nthese settings as well.\n\n88\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.530\nI'm just gonna click OK and\n\n89\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.410\nthat's fine it's just letting\nme know that I have that option.\n\n90\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.330\nNow the thing that I want is actually\nwhere it says CD and DVD drive right here.\n\n91\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.630\nAnd the reason why is because I\nhave what we call and ISO, right.\n\n92\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.320\nThat's gonna be a copied down image of the\noperating system that I want to install.\n\n93\n00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.130\nAnd you can go ahead and download those\nISO's from whatever vendor that you want.\n\n94\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.500\nRemember that what is key here even inside\nof VMware's ESXi, is the licensing.\n\n95\n00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.210\nIn other words if you're gonna be\ninstalling this for example, let's just\n\n96\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.930\npick on Microsoft cuz they're the ones\nthat we're normally focusing in on.\n\n97\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.870\nWe're gonna talk about licensing.\n\n98\n00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.120\nWell the very fact is it's gonna require\na license at some point during the install\n\n99\n00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.720\nor after the install that you're gonna\nhave to put in there to activate.\n\n100\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.910\nAnd that's their anti-piracy stuff and\nthat's why we want to pay attention.\n\n101\n00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.440\nIn a testing environment remember\nthat it's very easy to go oh,\n\n102\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.910\nit doesn't really matter that much.\n\n103\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.070\nBut in reality,\nas a professional IT worker now,\n\n104\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.520\nyou do need to pay attention\nto that stuff as well.\n\n105\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.480\nSo if I wanted to install, usually it\ncomes in the form of either you bought it\n\n106\n00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.470\nin a box store and it's on a disc or\ntoday you tend to download those ISOs.\n\n107\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.690\nSo if I download the ISO,\nI can select the CD/DVD drive and\n\n108\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.990\nI have a couple of options here.\n\n109\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.060\nNotice I have a device type\nthat I can have access to.\n\n110\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.850\nAnd this is actually where it becomes\na little bit tricky if you haven't dealt\n\n111\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.890\nwith a type one hypervisor.\n\n112\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.280\nIn theory, if I select this client device,\nwell what am I saying there?\n\n113\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.900\nI'm saying that on my laptop, the one\nthat I'm actually using to manage that\n\n114\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.280\nESX server well, I can go ahead and\nburn my DVD there.\n\n115\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.890\nAnd I can put it into my DVD tray on\nmy laptop and tell that host machine\n\n116\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.400\nthat's running ESXi, when it actually\nbegins the install process to use my DVD.\n\n117\n00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.930\nThat's pretty snazzy at least from what\nI would actually think about doing.\n\n118\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.310\nSo in other words, if I didn't have\na chance to go to that server, or\n\n119\n00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.000\nlet's say that a server is behind a locked\ndoor, well the good thing is I actually\n\n120\n00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.320\nhave that ability to do it right here if\nI want to, to have it go across network.\n\n121\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.420\nNow when you do so,\nit again may be a bit slower than\n\n122\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.210\nwhat you'd like because it has to\ngo across the network to do so and\n\n123\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.600\nthings do tend to slow down\nwhen it goes across network.\n\n124\n00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.890\nBut it is possible for you, so\n\n125\n00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.030\nit makes the installation\nprocess incredibly flexible.\n\n126\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.740\nThe other one,\n\n127\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.590\nof course, is to actually be able to\nget access to that machine itself.\n\n128\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.470\nAnd then put your own install media\ndirectly on that machine too, okay.\n\n129\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.460\nSo if you can do that it can also\nrecognize the physical device that's right\n\n130\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.750\nthere, and also use that device as well.\n\n131\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.540\nAnd that's great, and that's wonderful and\nthat's one of the best things that you can\n\n132\n00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.530\ndo is to be able to have\nphysical access to that device.\n\n133\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.480\nBut you've gotta remember that anything\nthat's physical like this that require\n\n134\n00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.505\nsome spin up whether it's on my machine or\non even the host machine there,\n\n135\n00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:38.780\nit's gonna be a little bit\nof a slower install process.\n\n136\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:44.610\nOne of the better ways to do it though is\nto actually have your datastore ISO file.\n\n137\n00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.554\nThe datastore ISO file is\nexactly what it sounds like,\n\n138\n00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:51.462\nthe entire installation media saved\nas a file and not as a physical disk.\n\n139\n00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:54.790\nSo it doesn't have to spin up a DVD or\na CD drive,\n\n140\n00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.477\nit actually can sit directly on\nto your storage device somewhere.\n\n141\n00:07:59.477 --> 00:08:03.421\nNow here inside of VMware,\nthey call it a data store.\n\n142\n00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:07.911\nData stores can exist anywhere, they can\nexist on what we call a virtual SAN or\n\n143\n00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:10.470\na storage appliance somewhere.\n\n144\n00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.920\nAnd that can actually be great, or\n\n145\n00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.550\nyou can actually have it exist\njust on that machine as well.\n\n146\n00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.520\nAnd that's what I've done here, is I've\nuploaded the actual file that I want.\n\n147\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.580\nIn other words, the ISO for\nmy Windows 2012 Server,\n\n148\n00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.560\nI've uploaded that directly\ninto the data store itself.\n\n149\n00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.370\nAnd so I can select that and\nI can actually use that as well,\n\n150\n00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.160\nand it will actually boot right up and\nspin right up for me to do that.\n\n151\n00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.392\nNow, when you actually do something like\nthat, that actually works fairly well\n\n152\n00:08:40.392 --> 00:08:42.877\nbecause now you're actually\nrunning it off that same drive.\n\n153\n00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:45.519\nNow you will have a little\nbit of discontention,\n\n154\n00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:50.031\nspecially when you have one drive but most\nof the time when we're installing ESXi,\n\n155\n00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:53.769\nwe're probably installing across\na raid array a lot of times here and\n\n156\n00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:56.905\nwe're not really having to\nworry about it too much here.\n\n157\n00:08:56.905 --> 00:09:00.910\nSo, you do actually end up\ndealing with some of it.\n\n158\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.140\nSo once I select that and\nnow I have that file stored up there,\n\n159\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.360\nI just want to turn on\nthe actual machine now.\n\n160\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.764\nSo if I go ahead and\nselect the little Play button that I see,\n\n161\n00:09:13.764 --> 00:09:17.476\nI should now see where\nthe Power On button went to.\n\n162\n00:09:17.476 --> 00:09:20.840\nAnd now it's actually saying it gives\nme the ability to power it off.\n\n163\n00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.650\nAnd I should be able to hit this Console\ntab here, and in a moment there you go.\n\n164\n00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.210\nYou see it beginning\nthe start up process here.\n\n165\n00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.330\nAnd now it's beginning to load up all\nthe files into RAM that it needs to\n\n166\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.600\nto begin the install process and\nnow here it is.\n\n167\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.010\nAnd now I simply follow the instructions\nthrough on the installation.\n\n168\n00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:43.580\nNow, here I'm using\nthe Windows 2012 email edition\n\n169\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.360\nof the software and my mouse is not\ngonna line up exactly right, and\n\n170\n00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.250\nthat's because it's having to readjust and\nrescale.\n\n171\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.660\nSo what you'll end up seeing\nat times is that I'll kind of\n\n172\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.610\nbe a little hesitant because the mouse\nis not moving the way that I want it to.\n\n173\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.850\nAnd that will always happen\ninside of this console here.\n\n174\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.050\nSo the console is not\na direct relationship.\n\n175\n00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.265\nSometimes you have to\nkind of guide it along.\n\n176\n00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:10.675\nAnd then, like this one is now just\nkind of floating around like crazy, and\n\n177\n00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:15.240\nI'm trying to do my best to make sure\nI select the addition that I want.\n\n178\n00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.210\nI'm just gonna do the standard\nevaluation edition.\n\n179\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.040\nAnd click Next here to get\nthe install process going.\n\n180\n00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.090\nYou of course are gonna accept\nthe End User Licensing Agreement, and\n\n181\n00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.610\nthen from that point you can\ninstall the operating system, and\n\n182\n00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.320\nI'm just gonna leave it at\nthe defaults right now.\n\n183\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.310\nWe're not actually trying to make\nany super special changes here, and\n\n184\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.050\nthere it goes.\n\n185\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.970\nThe install process will\ncontinue to happen.\n\n186\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.130\nNow the good thing is, it will install\njust like a regular physical machine and\n\n187\n00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:47.230\nwe've also seen in the process on type\nII hypervisors earlier in our series.\n\n188\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.110\nSo if you're not sure about that,\nmake sure you go back and\n\n189\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.970\ncheck those episodes out and\ntake a look at that.\n\n190\n00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.920\nBut here, at least for\nthe hypervisor for ESXi,\n\n191\n00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.965\nit really does work the same way where the\nrest of the process should go smoothly.\n\n192\n00:11:00.965 --> 00:11:07.620\nIt'll reboot a couple of times and then\nwe'll have an operating Windows Server\n\n193\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.600\n2012 VM actually going and ready to go.\n\n194\n00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.386\nNow we're not gonna wait for\nthis entire process and\n\n195\n00:11:15.386 --> 00:11:19.183\nthat's why I had previously also\nbuilt up another virtual machine, so\n\n196\n00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:21.794\nthat we can actually see\nthe end result process.\n\n197\n00:11:21.794 --> 00:11:27.768\nLab04 is at 2012 opera system and\nI select console over here and\n\n198\n00:11:27.768 --> 00:11:33.130\nI will give it a moment and\nlet it kind of focus in, there we go.\n\n199\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.330\nYou actually see that I was in\nthis one just a little ago.\n\n200\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.930\nAnd so here it is,\nit's an operating system and it is up and\n\n201\n00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.740\nrunning and just about everything\nthat we need it to do.\n\n202\n00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.700\nNow one of the things that we want to\nactually do at the very beginning here is\n\n203\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.720\nif we get it up and operating we\nwant to install those VMware tools,\n\n204\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.210\nis what we want to do.\n\n205\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.330\nNow on this machine I've\nalready installed it okay?\n\n206\n00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.920\nAnd the way that you can tell this\nespecially if you're actually inside this\n\n207\n00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.320\nmadram console is notice how\nI'm actually moving in and\n\n208\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.600\nout of that virtual machine, right here.\n\n209\n00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.020\nAnd all I'm doing is\nI'm using my track pad.\n\n210\n00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.330\nIf I go back to Lab05 even during\nthe installation process here and\n\n211\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.650\nlet me click in this window.\n\n212\n00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:23.360\nNow I'm trying to actually move\noutside of that blue area and\n\n213\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.250\nit's not letting me actually\nmove outside of it.\n\n214\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.810\nUntil I hit my host key\ncombination my CTRL+Alt,\n\n215\n00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.440\nthen notice you actually see\ntwo cursors right here instead.\n\n216\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.830\nSo on the other machine I already got it\ninstalled but I do wanna show you where\n\n217\n00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.940\nthe installation process begins and\nif this thing finishes we'll go and\n\n218\n00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.550\ninstall it here but if not you'll\nat least know where it begins.\n\n219\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.282\nSo I'm gonna go back to Lab04.\n\n220\n00:12:44.282 --> 00:12:46.446\nSo the operating system has to be up and\n\n221\n00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:50.140\nrunning when you choose to\ninstall the VMware tools.\n\n222\n00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:55.140\nFrom here, once you actually have it up\nand running you can then go to Inventory,\n\n223\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.490\nVirtual Machine, and\nthen you're gonna select Guest.\n\n224\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:06.030\nAnd here is where the option is,\nInstall or Upgrade VMware tools.\n\n225\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.620\nYou might be wondering like\nwhat's the upgrade thing about?\n\n226\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.640\nI understand install.\n\n227\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.910\nWell, you install you\nfollow the wizard through.\n\n228\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.610\nIt will ask you to reboot and\n\n229\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.820\nthat will give you that ability to move\nthat integration and also be able to full\n\n230\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.070\nscreen your machine, be able to do a few\nother things with the network adapter.\n\n231\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.040\nYou name it.\nYou always want to do that.\n\n232\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.190\nI do not know of a con, something\nagainst you actually installing this.\n\n233\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.580\nSo there is nothing that I know that\nshould tell you never install this.\n\n234\n00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.297\n>> Right.\nNow, Ronnie, when you say VMware tools,\n\n235\n00:13:36.297 --> 00:13:41.230\nright, it seems like everyone, every\nhypervisor or virtualization technology\n\n236\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.540\nthat we've looked at it almost seems\nlike they've got their own names.\n\n237\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.290\nSo let me just make sure\nI understand this right.\n\n238\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.520\nFor instance,\nHyper V's got integration services.\n\n239\n00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.544\n>> Right.\n>> Virtualbox has,\n\n240\n00:13:49.544 --> 00:13:52.490\nI believe they call them\nVirtualbox add-ons, right?\n\n241\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.200\n>> Additions.\n\n242\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.810\n>> Or additions.\n\n243\n00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.640\nAre we talking pretty much\nabout the same thing?\n\n244\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.940\nWe're talking about what helps\nthe hypervisor communicate\n\n245\n00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.260\nwith the virtual machine, helps us\nwith that pointer integration, and\n\n246\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.690\njust essentially makes the VM and\nthe hypervisor work better together.\n\n247\n00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.490\n>> It really is the same thing.\n\n248\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:14.120\nAnd to tell you the truth, between\nsomething like VMware Workstation and\n\n249\n00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.570\nthe actual VMware ESX,\nthe tools are essentially the same.\n\n250\n00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.440\nThey're not even different tools here.\n\n251\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.720\nIt is all about making sure\nthat they integrate better so\n\n252\n00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.990\nthat we can actually manage and\nuse our virtual machines much better.\n\n253\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.000\nSo it's always best, Tim,\nto make sure that you do that.\n\n254\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.530\nAnother key that I've also emphasized in\nevery other technology that we've looked\n\n255\n00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:37.648\nat, is that if you do upgrade,\nlet's say that next edition of ESXI\n\n256\n00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:42.600\n6.1 or 7 comes out whatever they\nactually choose to come out with.\n\n257\n00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.170\nYou'll see a lot times that when you\nlaunch your virtual machines that already\n\n258\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.660\nhave those tools installed on a newer\naddition of it if it gets separated.\n\n259\n00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.360\nNormally the first time you launch it\nup it may ask you do you want to go and\n\n260\n00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.630\nupgrade those tools as well,\nif it doesn't.\n\n261\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.330\nThe idea is fairly simple.\n\n262\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.380\nYou want to go ahead and uninstall those\nVMware tools on your current virtual\n\n263\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.520\nmachine and whatever the level is,\nand then make sure you go back and\n\n264\n00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.120\ninstall if it doesn't give you an upgrade\nfeature to the newest set that you have.\n\n265\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.960\nSo keeping that in line right, so\nyour VMware tools and your VMware number,\n\n266\n00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.760\nthat should actually match up.\n\n267\n00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.000\nAnd give you though the same\nlatest edition that you want here.\n\n268\n00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.070\nAlways make sure that those match up.\n\n269\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.160\nIt doesn't mean it's gonna work\nworse at times, but it can depending\n\n270\n00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.980\non the features that they've actually\nadded into the new VMware tools, it\n\n271\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.420\ncould be that the new one actually breaks\nsome of the features from the old one.\n\n272\n00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.070\nSo it's always better that you do\nmake sure that it matches up on\n\n273\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.300\nthose version numbers.\n\n274\n00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.090\n>> Now we're using a Type\n1 hypervisor here.\n\n275\n00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.880\nAnd I would assume with\nthe Type 1 hypervisor and\n\n276\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.820\nthe bare metal hypervisor, you're gonna\nsee that more in a production environment.\n\n277\n00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.394\nAnd in the example that you're\ngiving here, you're running servers.\n\n278\n00:15:50.394 --> 00:15:54.757\nSo I could imagine that if you do\nan upgrade to the VMware tools that you do\n\n279\n00:15:54.757 --> 00:15:58.051\nhave a potential for\na reboot that might be required.\n\n280\n00:15:58.051 --> 00:16:01.678\nAnd if you are in a production environment\nwhere we don't like to turn servers on.\n\n281\n00:16:01.678 --> 00:16:03.388\nNow you probably should be prepared for\nthat, right?\n\n282\n00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:06.758\n>> Yep, you definitely gotta know that\nthat may be something that happens.\n\n283\n00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:09.134\nSo, of course,\nin a regular production environment,\n\n284\n00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:11.570\nyou're gonna do those during\nthe low times that you can.\n\n285\n00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.348\nAnd most of the time,\nyou probably can actually reboot and\n\n286\n00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:18.159\nmost people aren't gonna notice,\nespecially if we have redundancies set up.\n\n287\n00:16:18.159 --> 00:16:21.970\nBut there are possibilities, there are\nchances, that you will have to do that.\n\n288\n00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.221\nUntil that point, though,\njust make sure you try and\n\n289\n00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:28.554\nkeep those things updated as\nlate as possible as well.\n\n290\n00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:32.200\nAll right, so now that we're\nactually kind of seeing that the end\n\n291\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.578\nresult of the install process should give\nme an operating system that works and\n\n292\n00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:37.923\nallows me to do things.\n\n293\n00:16:37.923 --> 00:16:42.144\nWell, what are some of the things I\nneed to worry about in terms of managing\n\n294\n00:16:42.144 --> 00:16:43.245\nthe VM's as well?\n\n295\n00:16:43.245 --> 00:16:45.787\nSo let's take for an example\nthat I don't have just two here.\n\n296\n00:16:45.787 --> 00:16:48.005\nLet's say I have ten or 20 VM's.\n\n297\n00:16:48.005 --> 00:16:52.794\nWell I need to be able to at least look\nat the performance of these devices if I\n\n298\n00:16:52.794 --> 00:16:55.086\nwere to actually be managing them.\n\n299\n00:16:55.086 --> 00:16:58.502\nAnd the nice thing is they have a nice\ngraphical environment for us here.\n\n300\n00:16:58.502 --> 00:17:03.574\nAnd well if mine doesn't, apparently my\nmachine is just locked up here just for\n\n301\n00:17:03.574 --> 00:17:06.160\na moment but, and I am not joking there.\n\n302\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.867\nIt has just locked up there as well.\n\n303\n00:17:08.867 --> 00:17:10.028\nBut in a moment, oh there it goes.\n\n304\n00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:12.828\nFinally, I was gonna say maybe it's\njust because I'm being a little bit too\n\n305\n00:17:12.828 --> 00:17:13.370\naggressive.\n\n306\n00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.870\nAnd that's me, all right.\n\n307\n00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.530\nSo notice that I have\nthese tabs right here and\n\n308\n00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.706\nwe have gone over some of these tabs.\n\n309\n00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:24.414\nBut one of the ones that we'd like to\nactually pay attention to is the one right\n\n310\n00:17:24.414 --> 00:17:26.740\nhere for performance as well, okay?\n\n311\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:32.399\nSo when you actually do have performance\nyou can actually select something like\n\n312\n00:17:32.399 --> 00:17:37.558\nthe data store or the CPU and actually\ntake a look at the usage of that CPU.\n\n313\n00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:41.700\nAnd then you can compare it to well,\nthe other CPUs if you need to.\n\n314\n00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.220\nSo if I selected number five and\nwent to Performance.\n\n315\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.538\nAnd let me see if I can\nactually spur that on here.\n\n316\n00:17:49.538 --> 00:17:52.670\nSo I'm just refreshing\nthe screen is what I'm doing.\n\n317\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:58.046\nYou'll see that it's actually giving some\ndata and some usage for us, depending on\n\n318\n00:17:58.046 --> 00:18:03.510\nwhether the CPU, the disk and we're taking\na look here on the disk i/o, the memory.\n\n319\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.369\nWe're actually looking at networking\nconnections, you name it,\n\n320\n00:18:07.369 --> 00:18:11.375\nactually can bring you that status\nthat you need right then and there.\n\n321\n00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:14.535\nAnd so if you do think that you're\nactually experiencing performance\n\n322\n00:18:14.535 --> 00:18:17.640\nproblems, and let's say that you\nthink it's actually happening so\n\n323\n00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.389\nbadly that maybe your console's\nnot allowing you to log in.\n\n324\n00:18:20.389 --> 00:18:23.920\nCome over to the Performance tab and\ncheck out what you need.\n\n325\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.554\nAnd that way, you might see that\nyou're pegged out at 100% of that CPU\n\n326\n00:18:28.554 --> 00:18:31.038\nusage inside of that virtual machine.\n\n327\n00:18:31.038 --> 00:18:31.745\nYou never know.\n\n328\n00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:33.860\nAt least performance here actually\ngives you a way to monitor.\n\n329\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.476\n>> Yeah, and\n\n330\n00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:39.410\nyou've been explaining as well that we\nget the ability to test the software.\n\n331\n00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.790\nAnd in testing the software, maybe I am\ntesting something like a SQL database.\n\n332\n00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.300\nWhere you can come into that performance\ntab and maybe you find out that the disc\n\n333\n00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.230\nhas heavy write IOs going on, and\nit's not performing adequately.\n\n334\n00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.110\nNow you've also showed us that you can\nchange those preferences after you've\n\n335\n00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.430\nhave the virtual machine created.\n\n336\n00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.911\nSo that performance tab looks like it\nwould be a great way so that if I am\n\n337\n00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:04.177\ntesting a specific piece of software and\nexpecting a specific performance, that if\n\n338\n00:19:04.177 --> 00:19:08.465\nit's not that meeting that criteria I can\ngo back and configure it different after.\n\n339\n00:19:08.465 --> 00:19:13.008\n>> Yeah, hopefully you can you know\nagain it does depend on the need of that\n\n340\n00:19:13.008 --> 00:19:14.231\nmachine, right?\n\n341\n00:19:14.231 --> 00:19:17.292\nSometimes you may just have to\nwait until that point where\n\n342\n00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:21.696\nyou can actually readjust it because when\nyou start making configuration changes\n\n343\n00:19:21.696 --> 00:19:25.968\nlike that you may end up seeing that all\nof a sudden that machine doesn't respond\n\n344\n00:19:25.968 --> 00:19:28.490\nas well after you make those changes.\n\n345\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:33.535\nSo it may be where you instead go ahead\nand you make a clone of that machine and\n\n346\n00:19:33.535 --> 00:19:37.237\nthen you test it on that\nbefore you make those changes.\n\n347\n00:19:37.237 --> 00:19:40.599\nNow the good thing is that's really\nbeyond what we're normally gonna be\n\n348\n00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:41.379\nassigned to do.\n\n349\n00:19:41.379 --> 00:19:42.877\nBut at the same time you\ndo have that ability.\n\n350\n00:19:42.877 --> 00:19:46.059\nNow the other thing that's\nactually gonna be great for\n\n351\n00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:48.559\nus at beginning is this\nEvents tab as well.\n\n352\n00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:53.260\nSometimes you might actually think hey,\nwas this machine recently rebooted?\n\n353\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:58.361\nAnd you just don't know what\nthe Events tab really does actually\n\n354\n00:19:58.361 --> 00:20:03.185\ngive you the actual you know,\nnotifications here, right?\n\n355\n00:20:03.185 --> 00:20:06.010\nVirtual machine on\nlocalhost was powered on.\n\n356\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.440\nSo if you're starting to notice this and\n\n357\n00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.480\nyou're actually getting time stamps along\nwith it, it can really help you out.\n\n358\n00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.014\nNotice that it actually shows\nwhen this been reconfigured.\n\n359\n00:20:14.014 --> 00:20:18.554\nIt was created here on this day and it\ncan continue to keep a nice little track\n\n360\n00:20:18.554 --> 00:20:23.760\nof things that may actually allow you to\nknow whether or not you need to reboot.\n\n361\n00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.403\nLet's say that you think it's time for\na reboot because things started performing\n\n362\n00:20:27.403 --> 00:20:30.072\nslowly and you weren't the last\none that was logged in here.\n\n363\n00:20:30.072 --> 00:20:32.942\nWell you can come in here and all of\na sudden you might actually look back and\n\n364\n00:20:32.942 --> 00:20:36.160\nrealize something, somebody had actually\njust rebooted this thing an hour ago.\n\n365\n00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.236\nWell do you wanna reboot it again?\n\n366\n00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:41.995\nYou can, I'm not saying you can't, but\nyou may want to check with that particular\n\n367\n00:20:41.995 --> 00:20:45.180\nperson, and hopefully you'll\nactually see who actually logged on.\n\n368\n00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.161\nThis one's root and\n\n369\n00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:49.283\nthat's the only one that I have\nan account here on this machine.\n\n370\n00:20:49.283 --> 00:20:52.970\nBut using this events tab is\nalso something that is great for\n\n371\n00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.804\nus to take a look at when we're\nactually trying to manage these\n\n372\n00:20:56.804 --> 00:20:59.698\nmachines between them,\nit really does help.\n\n373\n00:20:59.698 --> 00:21:03.757\nWhen you start seeing all of them actually\nhave powered on at same time more than\n\n374\n00:21:03.757 --> 00:21:08.062\nlikely that might indicate that the entire\nhost was actually having to power back on\n\n375\n00:21:08.062 --> 00:21:08.570\nas well.\n\n376\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.050\n>> And for security purposes Ronnie if\nwe wanna make sure that we're truly\n\n377\n00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.472\nimplementing like the principle least\nprivilege and I come in here and\n\n378\n00:21:15.472 --> 00:21:19.184\nif you are the root admin, you're the only\none that has the root password and\n\n379\n00:21:19.184 --> 00:21:21.330\nusername, you know that that would be you.\n\n380\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.950\nBut if you see other names in here,\nyou might have to recheck\n\n381\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.560\nthat principle of least privilege, maybe\nyou're giving somebody a little bit too\n\n382\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.760\nmuch access to even be able to\nturn these servers on and off.\n\n383\n00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.328\nWould that be the case?\n\n384\n00:21:31.328 --> 00:21:34.766\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt there that\nyou might find that out, where you go,\n\n385\n00:21:34.766 --> 00:21:37.400\nyou find out that Wes actually\nrebooted this an hour ago.\n\n386\n00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.861\nWell, it might be that you\ndid give them permission but\n\n387\n00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:42.214\nit gives you at least now\nthe ability to go and call and\n\n388\n00:21:42.214 --> 00:21:45.550\nsay, hey Wes, I noticed that you just\nrebooted this machine an hour ago.\n\n389\n00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.120\nWas it a performance problem?\n\n390\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.340\nOr why was it rebooted?\n\n391\n00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.880\nAnd so\nyou can at least check in on that too.\n\n392\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.680\nNow, there are a few other options\nhere that we were talking about.\n\n393\n00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.580\nSuch as your resource\nallocation tab as well.\n\n394\n00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.548\nSo notice that you can see\nhow much of that processor\n\n395\n00:22:00.548 --> 00:22:02.690\nis being consumed right here.\n\n396\n00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.750\nSo this one looks like it's\ntaking about 535 megahertz.\n\n397\n00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.954\nIn terms of host memory I have\nabout four gigs assigned and\n\n398\n00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:12.850\nin guess memory it says it's about\nfour gigs is being used right now.\n\n399\n00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.425\nSo notice there is no\nlimitations overall so\n\n400\n00:22:15.425 --> 00:22:19.330\neverything is actually kind of\nalmost powered all the way up here.\n\n401\n00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.360\nNothing in reservation, you name it.\n\n402\n00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.233\nThis machine's getting pegged out pretty\nharshly, and there's a reason for that.\n\n403\n00:22:25.233 --> 00:22:29.213\nAnd that's because both of these machines\nare really set to actually what,\n\n404\n00:22:29.213 --> 00:22:33.460\nwell their actually set to four gigs each\nif I actually remember correctly here.\n\n405\n00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.773\nAnd so the thing is I think on this\nmachine there's only eight gigs of ram,\n\n406\n00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:40.720\nand so you're probably wondering what\nhow the heck is that thing operating?\n\n407\n00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.500\nWell remember that not,\nthat machine's not taking up all of it.\n\n408\n00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.380\nBut it's pretty close and the hypervisor's\nstill running fine underneath it.\n\n409\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.793\nSo it does let you know the power and\nthe incredible efficiency of\n\n410\n00:22:52.793 --> 00:22:56.560\nthat hypervisor as a resource\nutilization right now.\n\n411\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.226\nThat it really is,\nit's running on such a tiny amount of RAM.\n\n412\n00:23:00.226 --> 00:23:04.836\nAnd it's allowing essentially both of\nthese hosts that have four gigs of RAM\n\n413\n00:23:04.836 --> 00:23:09.460\nassigned to it on a machine that only has\neight gigs of RAM to run pretty well.\n\n414\n00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.053\n>> On a Performance tab It seems like\nyou're just viewing the virtual machine on\n\n415\n00:23:13.053 --> 00:23:15.635\nthe Performance tab or\nthe tab we're just looking at.\n\n416\n00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:16.661\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now you get a chance to see\n\n417\n00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:18.756\nthe physical device that these\nmachines are running on.\n\n418\n00:23:18.756 --> 00:23:20.603\nSo Performance tab is\nthe virtual machine and\n\n419\n00:23:20.603 --> 00:23:23.421\nthe tab you're looking at now is\nactually a combination of the both,\n\n420\n00:23:23.421 --> 00:23:26.790\nnot too much performance but more just the\nresources that are running on the host.\n\n421\n00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.892\n>> Yeah, that way you can tell whether or\n\n422\n00:23:28.892 --> 00:23:32.578\nnot it is consuming too much resources\non the host machine as well.\n\n423\n00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:35.790\nSo just kind of be able to see\nstuff like that will also help.\n\n424\n00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:40.426\nNow, there was one another thing I wanted\nto point out here and let me make sure I\n\n425\n00:23:40.426 --> 00:23:45.080\ncan tell you where to go here on this one\nwhich is going to be the configuration.\n\n426\n00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.074\nSo I'm gonna click back on the server\nright here that the IP address\n\n427\n00:23:50.074 --> 00:23:51.420\nof my ESX server.\n\n428\n00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:56.870\nAnd notice I also get tabs here too\nthat are really about the server itself.\n\n429\n00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.595\nSo here's a summary of the machine.\n\n430\n00:23:58.595 --> 00:24:04.266\nHere's the OptiPlex 980 and it shows\nit's a dual-core or a processor as well.\n\n431\n00:24:04.266 --> 00:24:07.716\nAnd it shows how many logical\nprocessors that we have.\n\n432\n00:24:07.716 --> 00:24:14.339\nMemory usage right now is about 6 gigs,\nokay?\n\n433\n00:24:14.339 --> 00:24:15.820\nLet's go ahead and round that up here.\n\n434\n00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:20.640\n6 gigs of memory is being used and\nit has 8 gigs all together.\n\n435\n00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.160\nAnd right now one of those\nmachines is spiking pretty hard,\n\n436\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.180\nit's probably because it's finishing up,\nthe install is what we're seeing here.\n\n437\n00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.400\nBut we can see some of that, and\nthen of course you now have this and\n\n438\n00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:35.720\nthere it is notice that on lab zero\nfive 97% usage of the guest memory here.\n\n439\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.280\nWell if I'm starting to see something like\nthat just right here from that management\n\n440\n00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.070\nside, I can go to that virtual machine and\nmaybe I do need to shut that machine down\n\n441\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.680\nor start to explore why it's\nactually doing that as well.\n\n442\n00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.100\nAnd here's the performance overall for\nthat host machine.\n\n443\n00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.130\nSo it gives you that same ability to take\na look at all of that information and\n\n444\n00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.390\nalso what's happened here too.\n\n445\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:05.270\nThat's what I was gonna try and show,\nokay, is a couple of other things that\n\n446\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:10.280\nI really just kind of, I hate to say it,\nI ignore some of the stuff sometimes here.\n\n447\n00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.650\nBut there's some different options\nthat we also have available for\n\n448\n00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.920\nus here that we also have in\nthe type two hypervisor as well.\n\n449\n00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.970\nSo just like we talked about in type two\nhypervisors about things like snap shots,\n\n450\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.660\nwell we can also do that here too.\n\n451\n00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.080\nSo if I right click let's say on lab-05.\n\n452\n00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.260\nNotice I have the ability to\ntake a snap shot as well.\n\n453\n00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:34.150\nAnd at this snapshot manager that will\nallow me to also be able to do that and\n\n454\n00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.885\nbe able to track those changes.\n\n455\n00:25:35.885 --> 00:25:40.220\nRemember what a snapshot is is it actually\ntakes a picture of that machine in\n\n456\n00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.770\nthat particular time period\n\n457\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.800\nmaking sure that all of those changes\nare saved the way that we want to.\n\n458\n00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.970\nAfter that point,\nif I wanted to experiment and\n\n459\n00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:53.620\nmake some changes I could experiment and\nmake those types of changes.\n\n460\n00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.180\nAnd then, when I realize those\nchanges cause some adverse effect,\n\n461\n00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.860\nI can always instead go back and\nrevert to that last snapshot that will\n\n462\n00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.450\nclear out all the new changes and leave\nme with that state that I want it to.\n\n463\n00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:10.970\nIt prevents me, or saves me, excuse me,\nalso not only from losing changes that I\n\n464\n00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:16.550\nwanted to keep, but it also saves me from\nhaving to start all over again as well.\n\n465\n00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:21.080\nSo we can actually use things like\nsnapshots right here to also help us up.\n\n466\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.920\nThe other things of course that we can\ndo are the same things that we also\n\n467\n00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.400\nsaw on those other virtual machine as\nwell so you can actually shut them down,\n\n468\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.860\nyou can power then up.\n\n469\n00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.780\nYou can do all that.\n\n470\n00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.290\nBut remember that when you start\ntalking about ESXi, though,\n\n471\n00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.570\nwhen you're actually getting\ninto this type of machine,\n\n472\n00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.750\nit normally is gonna be running\non its own machine by itself.\n\n473\n00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.700\nAnd we're gonna be managing it\nform a different machine as well.\n\n474\n00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.490\nSo there are so\nmany things that you can actually do here.\n\n475\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:52.190\nAnd one last thing,\nespecially on power cuz\n\n476\n00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.540\nI think this is the thing that I always\nignore, and I don't really mean to.\n\n477\n00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.000\nIn virtual machines there's normally a\ncouple of different things that you can do\n\n478\n00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.940\nwhen you start talking about\nthe power down states, right?\n\n479\n00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.000\nThe ideal way to always power\ndown a virtual machine is what we\n\n480\n00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.690\ncall a graceful shutdown.\n\n481\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.380\nOkay?\n\n482\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.060\nA graceful shutdown is when we go\ninto the operating system itself, and\n\n483\n00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.010\nwe tell the operating\nsystem to shut itself down.\n\n484\n00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.820\nSo that ensures that the operating system\nsays okay, all reads and writes are done,\n\n485\n00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.770\neverything that I want is off is off,\nand then it powers down the machine.\n\n486\n00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.800\nThat is the best way to do it.\n\n487\n00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.200\nThe other thing that you have, of course,\nis the ability to just go to power off.\n\n488\n00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.080\nPower off is the same as if you pulled\nthe plug on that machine itself and\n\n489\n00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.600\nyou just yanked that power out.\n\n490\n00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.720\nNow, you might be going,\nis that really a bad thing?\n\n491\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.550\nWell, it is, because remember that your\nmachine could be in the middle of writing\n\n492\n00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:47.490\nsomething to the hard drive, and\nnow you've essentially yanked the power,\n\n493\n00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:51.410\nthere is a potential for power loss\nwhen you do something like that as well.\n\n494\n00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.170\nSuspend is another one\nthat you also have here.\n\n495\n00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:00.580\nSuspend is almost like what we'd call a\nhibernate state here where what it does is\n\n496\n00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.560\nwhatever is actually in RAM at this point,\nyou will also end up trying to save that\n\n497\n00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:11.360\nto that hard drive state and\nthen it will shut the machine down.\n\n498\n00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.730\nWhen you go ahead and you tell it to power\nback on, it will then reverse itself,\n\n499\n00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:21.110\npull all the information where it saved\nthat particular file that was in RAM,\n\n500\n00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.970\npull it up into RAM again and\n\n501\n00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.310\nyou won't go through the boot up\nprocess again is what you'll see.\n\n502\n00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.090\nAnd, of course, reset is telling you hey,\njust go ahead and\n\n503\n00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.760\ndo a nice soft reboot for\nme to be able to do that.\n\n504\n00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.310\nAnd then you have the restart guess\nwhich is, hey, let's go ahead and\n\n505\n00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.950\nmake sure everything's shut down and\nthen restart it again if we need to.\n\n506\n00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:39.500\nAnd, of course,\n\n507\n00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.740\nthe shutdown is that graceful shutdown\nif we can't get access into the machine.\n\n508\n00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.940\nSo unlike us, where we normally\nhave to go into the machine and\n\n509\n00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.610\nthen shut it down, we can also issue\nthis graceful shutdown from here.\n\n510\n00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.685\nAnd let's see if I can do that right here\nand that'll be kind of a neat thing.\n\n511\n00:28:53.685 --> 00:28:59.051\nSo even though it's in the middle of\nthis process where I have to still enter\n\n512\n00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:04.076\nin information, at this point I think\nI can still go into Inventory and\n\n513\n00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:06.650\nthen guest, or not guest, power.\n\n514\n00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.902\nYou can't see it.\n\n515\n00:29:07.902 --> 00:29:10.782\nAnd then select shutdown guest.\n\n516\n00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:12.120\nAnd it says it can't doubt.\n\n517\n00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.030\nIt's because I don't have\nthe VMWare tools integrated here.\n\n518\n00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.640\nLet me go to this one, and then I do\ncuz this one actually does have it.\n\n519\n00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.050\nSo if I select this one,\n\n520\n00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:23.530\nlet's see if I can get the virtual\nmachine to come back on.\n\n521\n00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.169\nInventory virtual machine power,\nand then select shutdown guest.\n\n522\n00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:30.940\nAnd there it goes.\n\n523\n00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.840\nAre you sure I want to do that?\n\n524\n00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.370\nGo ahead and do that, and notice there it\nis inside of Windows it's saying hey we're\n\n525\n00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.410\ndoing a graceful shut down right now.\n\n526\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.390\nAnd I didn't even really have to\nbe in that machine to do so and\n\n527\n00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.960\nit can actually do that.\n\n528\n00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.430\nSo, learning how to power down these\nmachines is important because you don't\n\n529\n00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:47.330\nwant to ever lose data.\n\n530\n00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.800\nEven though it's virtualized and it's easy\nto go, well, I don't really care about it.\n\n531\n00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.150\nWell in a testing environment that\nmight be the way that you go,\n\n532\n00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.230\nbut in a production\nenvironment treat each and\n\n533\n00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.390\nevery one of these as if they're\nactually a physical machine.\n\n534\n00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:00.070\nAnd that's true whether\nyou're talking about power,\n\n535\n00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.860\nwhether you're talking about maintenance,\nand\n\n536\n00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.960\nwhether you're talking\nabout security as well.\n\n537\n00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.410\nTreat each and every one as if\nit's another physical machine.\n\n538\n00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.720\n>> That's some great advice Ronnie yeah.\n\n539\n00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.360\nSo in this episode we've\nlooked at how to manage and\n\n540\n00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.700\nmaintain your VMs inside\nof the ESXi software.\n\n541\n00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.600\nNotice that we've also talked\nthat you have to determine what\n\n542\n00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.920\noperating system you're gonna\ninstall in the VM beforehand and\n\n543\n00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.600\nalso pay attention to what Ronnie's\nsaying here with your licensing.\n\n544\n00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.120\nDon't think because it's just so\neasy to copy, cut, and paste and\n\n545\n00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.540\ncreate one of these VMs from scratch\nthat the licensing doesn't apply to you.\n\n546\n00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.390\nMake sure you pay attention\nto the licensing for\n\n547\n00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:34.220\nwhatever software it is that you're using.\n\n548\n00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.490\nWe also looked at things\nlike the media location,\n\n549\n00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.500\nonce you've determined the media\nwhere are you gonna store this?\n\n550\n00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.160\nAre you gonna use the local machine\nthat you're using the management\n\n551\n00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.590\ninterface from,\nare you gonna use the host machine?\n\n552\n00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.840\nIf you use the host machine where's\nthat information gonna be stored?\n\n553\n00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.560\nWe've showed you how you can put that\ninformation in the data store so\n\n554\n00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.210\nyou have the ISOs in the format\nhandy way to install your machines.\n\n555\n00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.370\nNow we've also talked\nabout the VMWare tools.\n\n556\n00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.980\nRemember the VMWare tools help\nthe hypervisor to communicate\n\n557\n00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.930\nwith the virtual machine\nthat you're running.\n\n558\n00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.710\nIt also allows you some extra\noptions like pointer integration,\n\n559\n00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.600\nyou don't actually have to worry\nabout that pointer capturing\n\n560\n00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.805\nthe mouse from you and\nthen you can't find it.\n\n561\n00:31:10.805 --> 00:31:13.760\nAlso look at the performance\nmonitoring tab as well.\n\n562\n00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.910\nThat's a really good piece of\ninformation if you are testing software.\n\n563\n00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.940\nIf you're testing a specific piece\nof software on a machine and\n\n564\n00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.300\nyou want to know how it's gonna perform\nwhen you're running that software.\n\n565\n00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.550\nWe've also looked at the host\nresource monitoring.\n\n566\n00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:32.240\nRemember the host, you can only run so\nmany VMs as what your host has available,\n\n567\n00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.870\nso it's good to have that information.\n\n568\n00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.460\nAnd then finally, looking at the power\nstates, because that's important.\n\n569\n00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:42.600\nYou gotta determine do I want to send that\ntraditional ACPI shutdown signal, or do\n\n570\n00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.130\nwe want to allow it to perform a graceful\nshutdown so that we don't lose any data.\n\n571\n00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.730\nRonnie, got anything else for us?\n\n572\n00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:52.780\n>> Just remember that we're talking now\nthat working with type one hypervisor and\n\n573\n00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.020\nas an IT worker you do need\nto be familiar with that\n\n574\n00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.690\nwhen you actually enter into\na production environment.\n\n575\n00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:02.800\nYou're likely to see more type one\nhypervisor in a working environment\n\n576\n00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.820\nthan you are inside a testing environment\nwhich you're gonna generally see those\n\n577\n00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.720\ntype twos.\n\n578\n00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.195\nBut getting familiar at least with\nthe concepts that we've told you about in\n\n579\n00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:14.160\nESXi Is really gonna\nhelp you in your future,\n\n580\n00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.910\nas you continue to work more and\nmore with virtualization.\n\n581\n00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.680\nYou're likely to see this more often\nthan you're likely to see just\n\n582\n00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.170\nabout anything else out there.\n\n583\n00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:25.810\nSo just kinda realize that this is a part\nof us becoming better IT professions.\n\n584\n00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:26.620\n>> Well thank you Ronnie.\n\n585\n00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.770\nAs always it's a pleasure to have you\nhere, but it looks like we've come to\n\n586\n00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:33.440\nthe end of another exiting episode,\nso we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n587\n00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.470\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n588\n00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.450\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n589\n00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.264\n>> And we'll seen you next time.\n\n590\n00:32:37.264 --> 00:32:43.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

technologies.\n\n10\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.115\nWe're now moving into kind of a little\nbe more advanced virtualization here,\n\n11\n00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:40.040\nwhereas what we've actually seen before,\nhas all been what we call a G-U-I based,\n\n12\n00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.980\nI always call it GUI-based, here.\n\n13\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.870\nGUI of course is\nthe graphic user interface.\n\n14\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.830\nAnd what does that mean for\nus in our virtualization technologies?\n\n15\n00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.620\nWell, it meant that we were\nable to point and click and\n\n16\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.530\nfollow wizard to really help to guide\nus through a lot of the installation\n\n17\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.460\nprocess as well as actually even\ncreating virtual machines too.\n\n18\n00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.552\n>> So, so far we've been looking at\na lot of ones that have those intuitive\n\n19\n00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:05.415\npoint-click wizards and\nthis one's not gonna be that way.\n\n20\n00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:07.650\nThis not gonna be quite so\nintuitive here and\n\n21\n00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440\nwe're gonna have to dig\na little bit deeper.\n\n22\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.550\nSo this one might, to some people,\n\n23\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.620\npresent a little bit of a challenge or\njust seem more a little intimidating.\n\n24\n00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.810\n>> There's no doubt, if you're used\nto working in the Windows world,\n\n25\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.400\nwhat we're about to do though is gonna\nbe creating essentially the packages,\n\n26\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.840\nor actually downloading the packages\nthat we need to to get it installed but\n\n27\n00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.790\nwe're doing it inside of our\nLinux based distros instead.\n\n28\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.540\nAnd so what we are actually doing, is that\nwe are going to be doing a lot of our\n\n29\n00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.240\ncommand line building is what\nwe are going to do here.\n\n30\n00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.950\nSo the beginning of doing this is of\ncourse all command line and then we will\n\n31\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.440\nactually be using a little bit of a GUI\nto allow us to see the management of it.\n\n32\n00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.990\nNow, before we get started there,\nwe are familiar with things.\n\n33\n00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.340\nIf you've been in the IT industry for\nany amount of time at all,\n\n34\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.110\nyou've probably heard about\nOracle's Virtual Box.\n\n35\n00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.700\nOr if you've been around for a long time,\n\n36\n00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.380\nmaybe even Microsoft Virtual PC,\nwhich is a really older product.\n\n37\n00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.870\nOr Microsoft Virtual Server 2005,\nwe really haven't touched on any of those.\n\n38\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.390\nIn this series because you don't tend\nto see them around too much any more.\n\n39\n00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.000\nBut we did actually touch on the Oracle's\nVirtual Box, as well as VMware Workstation\n\n40\n00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.160\n11, and we even took a look at\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V as well\n\n41\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.410\nas of course the idea of VMware's ESX,\nor today known as vSphere.\n\n42\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.180\nSo some of them are of course\nthe type two hypervisors,\n\n43\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.160\nsome of them are also\nthe type one hypervisors.\n\n44\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.080\nAnd remember that of the products that we\nhave, there's really only been one that's\n\n45\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.990\nreally free at this point,\nwhich is gonna be Oracle's VirtualBox.\n\n46\n00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.870\nNow that's a type two hypervisor and\n\n47\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.510\nwe don't tend to see a lot of\nthose that's actually fairly free.\n\n48\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.010\nSo like even the one that I'm running on\nmy laptop right now is actually one called\n\n49\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.990\nFusion, VMWare Fusion, and does cost\na little bit of money to actually\n\n50\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.160\nbe able to install and run, but\nit is a nice little product.\n\n51\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.420\nBut when you start getting\ninto the production level,\n\n52\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.350\na lot of times the hypervisor itself may\nbe free, but the management software of it\n\n53\n00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.850\nmay not be free as well, and that's where\nyou actually have to kinda take a stand.\n\n54\n00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.100\nBecause normally inside of\na production environment,\n\n55\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.650\neven the management of virtualization\ndoes cost a little bit of money and\n\n56\n00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.040\nthey all depend on\ndifferent licensing models.\n\n57\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.240\nSo when it comes down to it,\nyou have to worry about that.\n\n58\n00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.129\nWhen we come th KVM, we'll see\nsomething a little bit different.\n\n59\n00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.742\n>> Now you mentioned type\none hypervisor on this one,\n\n60\n00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:32.085\nand we've discussed in some of\nthe previous episodes, Ronnie,\n\n61\n00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:35.549\nhow that type two hypervisor adds\nan extra layer of abstraction, so\n\n62\n00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.480\nif you're in a production environment,\nmight not be the best choice here.\n\n63\n00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.580\nSo what we're looking at different\nthan Oracle's VirtualBox,\n\n64\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.230\nis something type one hypervisor,\na bare metal hypervisor,\n\n65\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.030\nsomething that might be a little bit\nbetter for a production environment.\n\n66\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.830\n>> That's exactly what we're\nseeing here is that today,\n\n67\n00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.670\nbecause all of these different\nvirtualization products that we've already\n\n68\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.380\ntalked about, they are actually\nbeing used in one way or another.\n\n69\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.560\nThe problem that we have with those is\nthose licensing models can get a little\n\n70\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.660\nbit expensive, a little bit pricey, and\nthey can become incredibly complex.\n\n71\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.310\nWhen it comes to your production\nenvironment, though, people more and\n\n72\n00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.810\nmore are actually moving their server\nenvironments away from things that really\n\n73\n00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.320\ndo cost a ton of money to things\nlike some of the Linux distros\n\n74\n00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.430\nthat are rock solid distributions\nthat are out there.\n\n75\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.080\nAnd also the virtualization technology\nthat we're about to jump into as well.\n\n76\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.790\nAnd the reason why is because this is\nactually what we call an open source\n\n77\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.690\ntype of virtualization model.\n\n78\n00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.420\nAnd in the end result, it is really\na cost savings for most companies.\n\n79\n00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.750\nAnd the reason why is that\nthe management of this,\n\n80\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.040\nas well as of course the idea\nof the hypervisor itself,\n\n81\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.200\ngenerally becomes a bit of a free\nproduct for most companies out there\n\n82\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.990\nthat are actually trying to do this type\nof virtualization in their networks.\n\n83\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.050\nYou do end up getting kind of the same\nfunctionalities that you have with\n\n84\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.520\nthe ones that we've already seen\npreviously in our series here, but\n\n85\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.180\nit does take a bit more technical\nskill to be able to do so.\n\n86\n00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.830\nAnd so this is something we really\nwant to at least introduce you to\n\n87\n00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.222\nif you haven't seen it yet.\n\n88\n00:05:09.222 --> 00:05:14.190\n>> And also going back to some of those\nother hypervisors that we have been using,\n\n89\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.810\nkeep in mind that a lot of the software\nit's all a single component\n\n90\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.870\nbuilt into a single piece of software.\n\n91\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.220\nRonnie in this one if I understand,\nyou're talking about there are a couple of\n\n92\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.210\ncomponents that you need to be aware\nof before you can get this running or\n\n93\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.180\neven use it, right?\n\n94\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.910\n>> Right.\nSo\n\n95\n00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.030\nwhen it comes down to\nwhat we're talking about,\n\n96\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.950\nit's called KVM which stands for\nkernel based virtual machines.\n\n97\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.737\nAnd really, since like the Linux\nkernel came to like 2.6 and\n\n98\n00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:42.524\nprior whatever the other minor in\nnumber is actually gonna be or\n\n99\n00:05:42.524 --> 00:05:47.454\nthe build numbers actually gonna be at\nthat point, it's probably been around for\n\n100\n00:05:47.454 --> 00:05:49.546\na long time for the majority of us.\n\n101\n00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:53.624\nAnd we just haven't used it and that's\nbecause vendors have actually specialized\n\n102\n00:05:53.624 --> 00:05:57.060\nin these products, but more and\nmore because this is a cost savings for\n\n103\n00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.380\ncompanies and they found it to\nbe rock solid technologies.\n\n104\n00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.220\nYou tend to find companies like RedHat\nsupporting it, Dell supporting it,\n\n105\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.490\nIBM actually really big into this, because\nit doesn't require them to actually\n\n106\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.420\ndevelop a lot more than they need to.\n\n107\n00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.550\nWhat they've actually done, and what\nLinux has done is actually depended on\n\n108\n00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.990\nthe kernel to provide for\nthat virtualization support.\n\n109\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.620\nSo, if your computer supports that Intel,\nor the CPU and\n\n110\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.120\nthen the computer,\nsupports the Intel VT or the AMD-V,\n\n111\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.930\nthe good thing is KVM would\ngenerally run on those machines.\n\n112\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.570\nAnd that is what this natively designed\ndo, are those two architecture, or\n\n113\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.360\nthat one architecture I should say,\nthe x86 architecture.\n\n114\n00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.840\nNow, can it run on things like ARM and\nsome other ones that are out there?\n\n115\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.840\nIt is possible, but natively,\nwhen it comes down to it, this is\n\n116\n00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.630\nwhat it was designed to do is on those\n32-bit or 64-bit processors that you and\n\n117\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.150\nI would normally see in regular desktops\nas well as server environments.\n\n118\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.860\nSo this is actually a nice function.\n\n119\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.030\nIt's not an added in feature,\nit's actually built on top of the kernel\n\n120\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.850\nitself, which is actually right there,\nthat is directly on\n\n121\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.180\ntop of that CPU, and that's why\nit's actually becoming so popular.\n\n122\n00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.930\nIt's not a very heavy overhead value\nto it, it really does take a bit\n\n123\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.420\nthough more of command line\nunderstanding to be able to do so.\n\n124\n00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.530\nBut once you understand that,\n\n125\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.150\nthen you're actually fine with\nbeing able to do what you need to.\n\n126\n00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.360\nSo you do actually have to understand that\nit's really based around that architecture\n\n127\n00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.330\nthat allows for the access into the CPU\nto be able to write and to be able\n\n128\n00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.500\nto virtualize the actual passages or\npathways whatever you want to call them,\n\n129\n00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.510\nthe addresses, that's actually on your\nCPU back into that virtualization layer.\n\n130\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.790\nAnd KVM does it very well and\ndoes very fine with what it needs to.\n\n131\n00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.680\nNow for it to do that, you do have\nto have a couple of things in place.\n\n132\n00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.180\nLike we said, the Intel VT is pretty\nmuch the big one that we have to have.\n\n133\n00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.320\nBut then there's also another piece and\n\n134\n00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.490\ncomponent to the technology\nitself as well.\n\n135\n00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.939\nWhich is something that\nwe call the QEMU and\n\n136\n00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:03.213\nnormally you actually see it\nreturn in capital letters.\n\n137\n00:08:03.213 --> 00:08:05.671\nAnd that stands for quick emulator.\n\n138\n00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:10.560\nSo in Linux technologies or Linux-based\ntypes of virtualization technologies,\n\n139\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.535\nquick emulators have been around for\na long time.\n\n140\n00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:18.008\nIt allows you to emulate what the function\nof that device should be doing and\n\n141\n00:08:18.008 --> 00:08:19.504\neverything else, too.\n\n142\n00:08:19.504 --> 00:08:23.437\nBy itself, that particular type of\nemulation that doesn't take your hardware\n\n143\n00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:24.440\nand virtualize it.\n\n144\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.150\nIt actually says,\nhere's what I'm gonna represent and\n\n145\n00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.545\nthen you actually tend to work with\nthat and that's perfectly fine.\n\n146\n00:08:29.545 --> 00:08:33.920\nBut by itself,\nthat QEMU is actually just a Type 2\n\n147\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.100\nhypervisor that really is just saying,\nhere's the hardware I'm gonna report to,\n\n148\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.500\nwhatever software that\nshe needs it to say.\n\n149\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.870\nThen when it's combined together with KBM,\nthe kernel-based virtual machines though,\n\n150\n00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.651\nit turns both of those features in\nto the Type I hypervisor that will\n\n151\n00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:56.040\nallow us to build the virtual\nmachines that we need to.\n\n152\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.270\nThe QEMU really does allow\nus to have very good,\n\n153\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.280\nalmost native types of performance, even\nthough it's actually a Type 2 hypervisor.\n\n154\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.950\nBut along with the KVM it's actually\neven better, they call it near parity\n\n155\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.040\ntypes of performance that we\ncan get out of it as well.\n\n156\n00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.090\nSo that's why you tend to see this.\n\n157\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.970\nNow the thing you don't tend to see\nare a lot of people actually going in and\n\n158\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.320\nshowing you kinda this nice\nGUI because it's really done\n\n159\n00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.460\nthrough that command prompt\nmore than anything else.\n\n160\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.820\nSo that's what we're gonna\nstick with today, so\n\n161\n00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.400\nwe're not trying to get into all the\ntechnicalities in the background of KVM.\n\n162\n00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.390\nBut we do want you to see how\nit's generally installed and\n\n163\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.260\nsome of the, I hate to say it, some of\nthe heartache that you have to go through\n\n164\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.470\nif you're not familiar with the command\nline to help you to do this.\n\n165\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:46.450\nSo let's go ahead and get started here as\nwell and we'll take a look at my machine.\n\n166\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.460\nSo on my machine I'm running\nAscent OS 6.5 is what I'm running and\n\n167\n00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.500\nit really doesn't matter on\nthe version number so much.\n\n168\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.260\nYou may find a few commands to\nbe different if you're an older\n\n169\n00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.400\nversion number.\n\n170\n00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.842\nBut usually even like the other ones\nthat's out there like seven is actually\n\n171\n00:10:01.842 --> 00:10:05.065\nout there now and whatever other\nbuild number's out there right now.\n\n172\n00:10:05.065 --> 00:10:09.740\n6.5 is kinda one of the stable ones that's\nbeen out there for a while now and so\n\n173\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.550\nthat's why I chose 6.5 as well.\n\n174\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.190\nNow, the first thing that we are going to\ndo is we are gonna check out whether or\n\n175\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.350\nnot my machine can handle this.\n\n176\n00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.800\nSo I have a remote desktop\nconnection into my machine here, and\n\n177\n00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.910\nif I go up to Applications > System Tools\nand Terminal, let me go into\n\n178\n00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.540\nfull screen this Terminal a little bit so\nthat we can see it better here.\n\n179\n00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.450\nHere it is, so the first thing that I want\nto do is make sure that I go ahead and\n\n180\n00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:38.450\nperform a check here to verify whether or\nnot my machine can handle this.\n\n181\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.490\nNow like all the other virutalization\ntechnologies that we looked at that\n\n182\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.250\nare Type I hypervisors,\n\n183\n00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:48.180\nthey will allow us to do some\nover allocation of our resources.\n\n184\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.320\nAnd that means even though I'm limited\nby the amount of resources that I\n\n185\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.950\nhave on the physical machine, I can\n\n186\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:59.010\nover allocate as long as I don't actually\nover allocate exactly at the same time.\n\n187\n00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.680\nSo if I have a machine with 8 gigs of RAM\n\n188\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.680\ncan I build a virtual\nmachine with 6 gigs of RAM?\n\n189\n00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.760\nSure thing.\n\n190\n00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.990\nAnd can I build another\none with 6 gigs of RAM?\n\n191\n00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.040\nSure thing as long as you don't turn on\nboth of those virtual machines at the same\n\n192\n00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.640\ntime, you're probably gonna be fine.\n\n193\n00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.190\nSo it will allow you to kind of overdo\n\n194\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.510\nwhat you have the ability\nto do at one time.\n\n195\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.970\nBut just as long as you're not\nusing it at the same time.\n\n196\n00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.990\nSo you do wanna make sure\nthat you understand that too.\n\n197\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.110\nAll right, so\n\n198\n00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.960\nnow that I've got this command line up,\nwhat is the command that we want.\n\n199\n00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.520\nWe'll actually do what we\ncall a grep command here and\n\n200\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.300\nwe're gonna use the enhanced grep here so\negrep and\n\n201\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.240\nthen if I type this incorrectly here,\nI have to use my cheats here.\n\n202\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.250\nHelp me out.\n\n203\n00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:44.310\nI'm going to grep what we call\nvmx here and that is actually\n\n204\n00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.307\nthe little command that is a flag\ninside a Linux the set OS here\n\n205\n00:11:49.307 --> 00:11:54.500\nthat signifies whether or\nnot intel VT is actually running or\n\n206\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:00.510\nif this is an AMD machine I would actually\ntype in svm, is what I would do here.\n\n207\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.400\nSo I'm telling it to search for\n\n208\n00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.690\neither one of these two commands\nhere is what I'm telling it to do.\n\n209\n00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:13.010\nAnd I'm telling it to search inside\nof processes and one called cpuinfo.\n\n210\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:19.320\nAll right, so when I do that and\nI get the output that comes out,\n\n211\n00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.690\nwhat I'm looking for in this area that's\ncalled flags here is that somewhere\n\n212\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:30.460\nalong this line I am looking for\nsomething that we call the vmx here.\n\n213\n00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.620\nSo as you look through here, and\n\n214\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.000\nthis is where it becomes\nmore of a search of things.\n\n215\n00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.750\nBut here you go,\nhere's vmx here on this particular flag.\n\n216\n00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.170\nHere is vmx here on this\nother flag that we see.\n\n217\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.850\nHere's vmx here on this flag,\nand here it is here.\n\n218\n00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.770\nAnd the reason that I'm pointing\nout the vmx is I know that\n\n219\n00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.560\nthese are intel processors.\n\n220\n00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.720\nBut notice there's that\nsmx right beside it, smx,\n\n221\n00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.480\nI'm gonna make sure I say that right,\nright beside there.\n\n222\n00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:03.020\nSo as long as I see those flags ready and\navailable there, it will actually sa,\n\n223\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.680\nhey, you will actually have a great\nperforming machine as long as those\n\n224\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.400\nspecs are okay and can actually handle\nhow many virtual machines that you want.\n\n225\n00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.870\nIntel VT, the AMDV,\nis gonna help you out here.\n\n226\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:17.670\nSo that's what you want.\n\n227\n00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.860\nNow the weird thing about this OS is that\neven though this is wanna check actually\n\n228\n00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.910\nsay look I wanna put this into a\nproduction environment you definitely want\n\n229\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:31.710\nthis, KVM will allow you to install this,\neven if your machine will not support it.\n\n230\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.650\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n231\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.230\nThat means it doesn't\nreally need to use it.\n\n232\n00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.850\nSo the only other place\nthat we really saw this in\n\n233\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.830\nother hypervisors that we were looking at\nis really probably inside the virtual box,\n\n234\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:47.020\nas well as the actual\nVMWare workstation too,\n\n235\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.760\nwhere we could un-check this if we didn't\nwant that virtual machine to do it.\n\n236\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.510\nBut what KVM actually says is look,\nI definitely want to use it.\n\n237\n00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:59.080\nBut if you go in and try and install\nthose packages that we need inside of\n\n238\n00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.480\nCentOS to run KVM and you don't have it,\nI'll still actually run it for\n\n239\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.990\nyou but\nit can not guarantee the performance.\n\n240\n00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.830\nSo it's pretty neat.\n\n241\n00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.990\n>> Now let me just step back and\nplay devil's advocate.\n\n242\n00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:13.500\nMaybe you want to go put this into\na production environment, but\n\n243\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.310\ncertainly don't wanna wait til you're\ninstalling the software to figure out do\n\n244\n00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.860\nI have,\ndoes my CPU have the Intel VT technology?\n\n245\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.550\nDoes my CPU have the AMD-V technology.\n\n246\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.750\nRonnie, can I go to\nthe manufacturers website?\n\n247\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.560\nCan I do kinda like a tech spec before\nI even install this just to verify it\n\n248\n00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.891\nrather than waiting to check\nin the operating system?\n\n249\n00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:35.193\n[CROSSTALK] That is always one of\nthe great things you can do, but\n\n250\n00:14:35.193 --> 00:14:36.953\nremember a lot of times, right.\n\n251\n00:14:36.953 --> 00:14:41.492\nIt's easy to actually say,\nI'll go ahead and do that, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:41.492 --> 00:14:44.710\nIt's a lot harder to make sure that\nyou go out and find that spec.\n\n253\n00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.640\nBut if you can,\nyou find the specs for your CPU.\n\n254\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.670\nYou can always go out to AMD or\neven Intel, and\n\n255\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.130\nIntel has the requirements, and\nif you find out the actual model number,\n\n256\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.560\nit will tell you whether or\nnot it will support it.\n\n257\n00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.630\nBut remember if you really wanna test\nright then because you go, I think I'm\n\n258\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:05.040\ngonna install it here, you can always at\nleast run this test to verify that your\n\n259\n00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.890\nCPU is ready for action to be able to\ninstall what you need to, all right?\n\n260\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.690\nSo once we have this okay, and\n\n261\n00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.980\nwe go all right we are now ready,\nwe now need to actually install multiple\n\n262\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.790\npackages to be able to get this\nrunning the way that we want to.\n\n263\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.020\nNow inside of sent OS and\n\n264\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:30.120\nthose of you that are great at,\nyou know, working with Linux as well,\n\n265\n00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.670\nyou know that you can actually just\nkind of concatenate all those commands.\n\n266\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.520\nIn other words, you can actually install\nmultiple packages through one line.\n\n267\n00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.900\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna install\njust one at a time so that we see it, and\n\n268\n00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.040\nwe understand what we're actually\ninstalling here as well, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.430\nSo the first thing that I'm going to\ndo is I'm gonna notice something,\n\n270\n00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.990\nthat I'm right here and it actually\nsays me as Ronnie, which is fine.\n\n271\n00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.880\nBut normally when we need to,\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n272\n00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.540\ninstall this as the, supervisor as well.\n\n273\n00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.374\nSo I'm simply gonna elevate my privileges\nand actually get essentially logged in as\n\n274\n00:16:03.374 --> 00:16:06.296\nRoot, is what it's doing,\nas I've switched my context here.\n\n275\n00:16:06.296 --> 00:16:08.537\nAnd notice that it\nactually says I am root,\n\n276\n00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:12.480\nwhich is essentially the administrator for\nthis machine instead.\n\n277\n00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.620\nThat way I'm not going to be asked for\nprivileges every time.\n\n278\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.860\nCan I do this through the sudo\ncommand if I want to?\n\n279\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.520\nYes I pretty much can.\n\n280\n00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.580\nBut just doing this is probably going to\nhelp me out without having to worry about\n\n281\n00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.560\nit as well.\n\n282\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.630\nSo is it the best practice, no.\n\n283\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.070\nInside of your environment,\nyou do what your supervisor says to do.\n\n284\n00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:35.940\nDon't do it like this, this is just to\nhelp save me the time to do this, right.\n\n285\n00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.910\nSo the first thing that we do is we\ngo to our repository here, yum, and\n\n286\n00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.000\nthen we do install, and\nthen we do kvm, okay?\n\n287\n00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.970\nSo when we start talking about this,\nthis is the main package, right?\n\n288\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.820\nThis is like software inside\nof windows that we go to,\n\n289\n00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.670\nand I don't have to actually go and\ndownload it somewhere myself and\n\n290\n00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.240\nthen double click on it to install.\n\n291\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.160\nNotice it actually downloads and then asks\nme whether or not I want to install it and\n\n292\n00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.720\nI simply type yes.\n\n293\n00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.490\nAnd heres all of the other dependencies\nthat it's installing for me.\n\n294\n00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.210\nSo not only do I get this qemu-kvm,\n\n295\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.870\nremember that I told you that\nit works together, okay?\n\n296\n00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:18.190\nAnd then there it is, it's gonna\nbe about 14 megabytes installed.\n\n297\n00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.760\nAnd there it goes, it's actually\nbeginning the install process for us.\n\n298\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.290\nSo that is the first initial\npackage that I need,\n\n299\n00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.200\nand it's not gonna take a long time here.\n\n300\n00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.510\nIt's actually just going through, it's\nactually got ten of 12 right now as well.\n\n301\n00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.980\nSo, we should see if finish\nit installing here, and\n\n302\n00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.184\nverifying that those\npackages got installed.\n\n303\n00:17:36.184 --> 00:17:41.420\n>> So if you're in server 2012 r2 and we\nare going to install a roel that we have,\n\n304\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.860\nand we've done this before and it asks\nyou need these additional features,\n\n305\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.580\nyou want to go ahead and install them.\n\n306\n00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.510\nThat's kind of nice here, it almost looks\nlike the same thing that if you do that\n\n307\n00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.680\nyum install and it does have\na dependency it's gonna let you know and\n\n308\n00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.670\nit's gonna say hey you need to install\nthese required dependencies for\n\n309\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.990\nthis software to even work.\n\n310\n00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.860\n>> It really does, it goes ahead and\nchecks for us, and if it does need it,\n\n311\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.160\nit says let me go ahead and\n\n312\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.810\nfind those dependencies, make sure\nthat they're installed as well, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.050\nSo now that we have the base\npackage installed, what do we need?\n\n314\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.000\nWell our next idea of course is to be able\nto build and create virtual machines.\n\n315\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.920\nBut we can't do so without the programming\nlanguage that we need installed here.\n\n316\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:23.150\nSo yum install python-virtinst\nis actually the next package.\n\n317\n00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:28.800\nAnd that's what this does,\nthis allows us to be able to build and\n\n318\n00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.140\ncreate virtual machines here.\n\n319\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.450\nAnd it's based off a library\nthat we call libvirt,\n\n320\n00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.120\nis what it actually is based off of.\n\n321\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.720\nAnd that's perfectly fine cuz\nthat's what we actually want here.\n\n322\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.810\nSo we actually can install that.\n\n323\n00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.170\nNow remember what I said at the beginning,\nif you're saying, man,\n\n324\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.120\nwhy didn't he just do\nthat all in one line?\n\n325\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.050\nBecause we want people that are actually\nfirst starting out to understand what's\n\n326\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.150\ngoing on here, so we're adding them in\njust a little bit one at a time here.\n\n327\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.070\nThen, of course, we need that ticker\nlibrary I was just mentioning, and\n\n328\n00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:01.620\nI'm going to tell it yum install libvirt.\n\n329\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.410\nVirt hopefully you're starting to\nrealize that means virtualization.\n\n330\n00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.310\nAnd this one is actually used for\nthat basic virtualization.\n\n331\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.760\nSo it is actually putting in in the\nbackground all the stuff that KVM would\n\n332\n00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.850\nneed to define the virtualization and do\neverything else that we need to as well.\n\n333\n00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.380\nAnd you're seeing it's adding\nall of those extra packages and\n\n334\n00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.820\nI'm just actually typing\nin really one word, right?\n\n335\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.590\nOver and over differently, right?\n\n336\n00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.100\nYUM installed, but that install,\nthat libvirt, went out and\n\n337\n00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.430\nfound all these additional packages\nthat it needs to bring it in.\n\n338\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.490\nSo the good thing is you and\nI don't have to find that.\n\n339\n00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.180\nIt just goes ahead and\n\n340\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.880\ndoes it and it's actually doing it\nbased out of the internet as well.\n\n341\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.692\n>> And, of course, there's another\none that fairly similar here which\n\n342\n00:19:41.692 --> 00:19:46.240\nthe libvirt-python because it's\nactually based on Python as well,\n\n343\n00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.520\nallows now for Python applications so\nthat we can actually\n\n344\n00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.330\nuse those types of applications\nto manage our virtual machines.\n\n345\n00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.980\nSo it's even giving us that ability,\nand it says look.\n\n346\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.920\nYou've already installed it.\n\n347\n00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.180\nAnd so that's another benefit right here,\nusing these package installers,\n\n348\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.440\nis that if it's already installed\nit's not gonna do it again too.\n\n349\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.330\nSo this one got installed\neven with the last one and\n\n350\n00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.300\nnow we need a management console.\n\n351\n00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.760\nSo yum install and\n\n352\n00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:19.850\nvirt manager is actually one that we can\nuse here, make sure I'm telling you this.\n\n353\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.940\nSo this again,\nwe'll actually use that lib virt\n\n354\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.530\nto be able to manage our\nvirtual machines as well.\n\n355\n00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.670\nAnd so\nonce that actually finishes installing,\n\n356\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.900\nwe've got a couple of more that we need to\ninstall as well, but then we'll be done.\n\n357\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.170\nSo there is six or\nseven different packages, and\n\n358\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.050\nyou're probably wondering Ronnie,\nhow am I gonna remember all of these?\n\n359\n00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.490\nWell, the good thing is you can go out and\nsearch the Internet And it will give you\n\n360\n00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.060\na list of the ones that need to be\ninstalled on there for it to work.\n\n361\n00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.170\nNow remember you don't have to worry.\n\n362\n00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:53.270\nYou may find six or seven different lists\nout there depending on who actually\n\n363\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.990\nwrites the list, and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n364\n00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.950\nAnd if you do end up where they're\nduplicating, they're not gonna actually\n\n365\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.090\ninstall some of them if they end\nup duplicated so you're finding.\n\n366\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.940\nAnd there is another one\nhere called yum install\n\n367\n00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.570\nlibguestfs for something like file system,\ntools is what we want.\n\n368\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.040\nSo now this for accessing,\nof course, the file\n\n369\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.000\nsystem inside of our virtual machines and\nthat one actually took a while.\n\n370\n00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.440\nMan, that one just flew by,\nthat's about 10MB it's gonna install, and\n\n371\n00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.980\nthe good thing is most of these are\nactually installing incredibly quickly.\n\n372\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.980\nIt doesn't look like it takes a ton\nof time to get installed here.\n\n373\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.940\nBut we do need all of these packages\nto make sure that we're gonna be able\n\n374\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.900\nto do what we need.\n\n375\n00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.880\n>> Now that's a lot of\nlines of information inside\n\n376\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.200\nthe command line interface, and\n\n377\n00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.340\nyou can see there's no way that I'd be\nable to remember hey, did I install this?\n\n378\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.670\nDo I have this present?\n\n379\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.390\nIs this technology here?\n\n380\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.940\nDo we have the ability that once\nwe install these packages we need\n\n381\n00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.180\na way to turn around and confirm, hey do\nI even have them installed in the machine\n\n382\n00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.730\ncuz I can tell you right now there's\nno way in heck I'd be able to remember\n\n383\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.150\nall those lines of information\nthat are going by.\n\n384\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.780\n>> There's no doubt, but\nthe good thing is when they're actually\n\n385\n00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.630\nsuccessfully installed at the end\n>> It tells you it's complete or\n\n386\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.290\nit was successfully installed, but\n\n387\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.700\nwe're gonna run another tool that actually\nverifies that all those virtualization\n\n388\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.720\ntechnologies that we wanted in here\nabsolutely did get installed as well.\n\n389\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.250\nAnd I've got one more, and\nthis is not essential here, but\n\n390\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.650\nthis is one we do want to see.\n\n391\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.740\nAnd this is virt -viewer.\n\n392\n00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.830\nThis allows us to view the virtual\nmachines through a nice little\n\n393\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.830\nGUI if we want to.\n\n394\n00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.270\nNow this is not the fanciest thing\nin the world, don't get me wrong.\n\n395\n00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:36.960\nBut it at least gives you a little\nGUI interface that you can see kinda\n\n396\n00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.310\neach virtual machine that's\nactually one that computer,\n\n397\n00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.180\nwhich really does help us to match up\nwith what we've already seen before.\n\n398\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.350\nIn our previous looks at all\nthe hypervisors that we've been\n\n399\n00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.390\nlooking at as well.\n\n400\n00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:54.300\nSo I'm gonna select that one, and\nI'll also just type in a y and\n\n401\n00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:59.000\nallow that install process to\ncontinue to go through as well, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.380\nSo once this is done, and\nI believe that I've actually added in\n\n403\n00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.290\nall the ones that I need,\nI need to check out those packages, and\n\n404\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:10.700\nthen I can type an RPM for\nthe red hot package manager here.\n\n405\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.830\nAnd then we're gonna do a QA to\nhelp us to query everything.\n\n406\n00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.620\nAnd then we're gonna do our pipe command,\negrep here.\n\n407\n00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.370\nSo we're also doing some filtering and\nwe're telling that,\n\n408\n00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:26.150\nhey report all of the actual\npackets on my machine here.\n\n409\n00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:31.820\nThat have the word virt, or\nthe letters virt, or kvm in them.\n\n410\n00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.390\nAnd now we'll get a list.\n\n411\n00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.750\nNow your list may differ, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.820\nBut here's all of the actual\npackages that we're looking for.\n\n413\n00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.640\nThat kvm there, the viewer.\n\n414\n00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.480\nSo this actually tells me that I\nactually installed these packages,\n\n415\n00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.360\nnotice I didn't even have to actually\ntype in those version numbers,\n\n416\n00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.300\nwhich is absolutely cool for me.\n\n417\n00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.660\nBut you will actually be able to see\nall the ones that you just installed\n\n418\n00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.440\nthat included in either one of those two,\nand that they're actually complete and\n\n419\n00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.510\nthat they're ready to go.\n\n420\n00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:01.178\n>> So, if I'm not standing\nby the command line here,\n\n421\n00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:05.587\nmaybe I'm the one that's gonna go in and\ndo some configurations after the fact, and\n\n422\n00:24:05.587 --> 00:24:10.086\nI didn't see all of those people, Being\ninstalled during the time of installation.\n\n423\n00:24:10.086 --> 00:24:12.582\nThis is a way that I can\ngo back after the fact and\n\n424\n00:24:12.582 --> 00:24:14.758\nverify that those packages are ready and\n\n425\n00:24:14.758 --> 00:24:18.921\nwe're ready to move on and doing\nthe configuration and installation of KVM.\n\n426\n00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:20.370\n>> You to a point right?\n\n427\n00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:24.410\nSo just like everything else in\nthe world of command line stuff\n\n428\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.490\neven though it says it's installed doesn't\nmean that the actual machine itself is\n\n429\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.300\nready to go right away.\n\n430\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.170\nAnd the reason why is that it has\nto actually require a reboot.\n\n431\n00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.630\nIn the years past, right, it used to be\nafter you installed everything you'd go\n\n432\n00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.020\nall right, we automatically reboot\nto make everything ready to go.\n\n433\n00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.900\nWell, in Windows they've tried to reduce\nthe number of reboots which is fine, and\n\n434\n00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.150\nwe've gotten used to that.\n\n435\n00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.700\nBut in the Linux world though, it's\nsomething you really want to make sure of.\n\n436\n00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.140\nSo at this point, you do want to\nmake sure you reboot the machine.\n\n437\n00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.610\nAnd in this sent OS here\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n438\n00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:59.510\nreboot and now the system is\nactually going to, like mine here,\n\n439\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.250\nit disconnected from that remote desktop\nand in a moment it should reboot.\n\n440\n00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.710\nAnd we should be up and ready to go.\n\n441\n00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.910\nSo this is actually gonna be\nan important point for us as it reboots.\n\n442\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.700\nAnd then in a moment here I'll go ahead\nand we'll reconnect to that again.\n\n443\n00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.920\nBut we're still not done yet,\n\n444\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.070\nbecause there's still some other\nconfiguration for us to do.\n\n445\n00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.730\nBut that's one of the big things right\nthere, is making sure that we understand\n\n446\n00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:26.700\nthat it has to be installed through\nthe actually packages there.\n\n447\n00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.440\nAnd then once we do that we reboot it.\n\n448\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.680\nand then we still have a little bit of\nconfiguration to go before we can actually\n\n449\n00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.980\nbuild our very first virtual machine.\n\n450\n00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.400\nMy machine has now successfully rebooted.\n\n451\n00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.430\nIt did take a few minutes for\nme to be able to do that.\n\n452\n00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.350\nBut once everything is\nactually back up and\n\n453\n00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.610\nready, well now I know that\nthose packages have been kind of\n\n454\n00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:50.300\nintegrated in the way that I want to and\nhow can I just see some of these things?\n\n455\n00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.380\nWell, one of the initial ways that\nyou can verify that KVM is there and\n\n456\n00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.220\ninstalled, we can go back in and run that\nkind of command again and verify that\n\n457\n00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:03.320\nthere's packages are there, but there is a\ngraphical way to be able to see this too.\n\n458\n00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.750\nIf I click on applications, and\n\n459\n00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.490\nthen I come down to system tools, well,\nright here was where I launched the actual\n\n460\n00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.270\nterminal from where we entered\nin all those commands.\n\n461\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:18.560\nBut notice that now directly underneath\nit is Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n462\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.405\nSo if I select this thing right here,\n\n463\n00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:25.675\nyou are actually now seeing that it's\nsearching for the available hyper visors.\n\n464\n00:26:25.675 --> 00:26:28.835\nNow what is also going to\nhappen here unless it fails\n\n465\n00:26:28.835 --> 00:26:30.875\nis that it's actually\nshowing something here.\n\n466\n00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:34.375\nIt says system policy prevents management\nof localized virtual machines.\n\n467\n00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:37.675\nBut if I want to do it again\nbecause this is just saying hey,\n\n468\n00:26:37.675 --> 00:26:40.190\nsecurity wise you don't\nreally want to do this.\n\n469\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:44.190\nBut notice that what it\nsees in itself is itself.\n\n470\n00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:50.640\nSo the first virtual machine that it sees\nis the host itself which is kinda neat.\n\n471\n00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.640\nAnd this is where we saw something about\nthe type one hyper visor that we also saw\n\n472\n00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.570\ninside of Microsoft Hyper-V\nis where we saw this as well.\n\n473\n00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:04.190\nThat we were able to see it from\nVirtual Server 2012 installed.\n\n474\n00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.920\nWe launch that role of the hypervisor.\n\n475\n00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.450\nAnd what I kind of explain there was that\neven though the hypervisor is residing\n\n476\n00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.300\nthere, the first thing that it does\nis it reboots to install the role\n\n477\n00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.090\ninto the operating system.\n\n478\n00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.120\nAnd then you may see a lot of\ntimes where it will reboot again.\n\n479\n00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.930\nAnd what it's doing then is\ntaking that hypervisor, and\n\n480\n00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:26.010\nmaking the actual host machine\nnow a virtual machine.\n\n481\n00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.900\nSo essentially flipping it\nover now is what we have.\n\n482\n00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.640\nAnd that's exactly what we're\nseeing right here as well.\n\n483\n00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:36.560\nSo now, even though it seemed like\nI am on that host sent OS machine,\n\n484\n00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.200\nit is saying actually you're inside\nof your own virtual machine.\n\n485\n00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.410\nCuz I didn't create his\nduring tha time of rebooting.\n\n486\n00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.600\nWhat did it,\nKBM actually is the one that did it.\n\n487\n00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.440\nAnd now in this little viewer that we had,\n\n488\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.450\nremember we had that vert viewer\nthat we actually took a look at.\n\n489\n00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:54.280\nHere it is, it's actually showing\nus that little virtual machine.\n\n490\n00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.870\nNow, even though I could go ahead and\nstart creating some virtual machines,\n\n491\n00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.610\nthe problem we have is\nthat inside of sent OS and\n\n492\n00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:05.850\nthe way that this is done with KVM,\nit's not as easy nor as intuitive.\n\n493\n00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.430\nTo get everything the way that we want to.\n\n494\n00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.920\nWe've seen in previous episodes,\nright, where we could go in and\n\n495\n00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.150\ncreate a virtual machine and\nthen Wes, look,\n\n496\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:21.200\nI need to add in another component here,\nvery easy to do so.\n\n497\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.840\nInside of the KVM though,\njust about everything that we do,\n\n498\n00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.920\nif we're gonna do it\nfrom the command line.\n\n499\n00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.990\nIt actually requires a manual\nconfiguration for us.\n\n500\n00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:33.270\nSo what that actually means though is\nthat we'll have to actually go in and\n\n501\n00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:39.080\nbuild some of these components\ninside of our install of Cent OS,\n\n502\n00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.280\nand then we'll get the virtual\nmachines attached to them as well.\n\n503\n00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.220\n>> We've seen in some of the past\nhypervisors and virtualization software\n\n504\n00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.310\nthat we've been working with that\nwhen you are creating for instance,\n\n505\n00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.380\na virtual hard disk, a virtual had drive,\n\n506\n00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.770\ndepending on what technology your in,\nthat we have a couple of options, right?\n\n507\n00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.960\nWe have the ability to create a static or\na fixed drive, right?\n\n508\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.290\nIt allocates the whole entire\nportion of that drive.\n\n509\n00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.500\nTo that virtual machine at that time.\n\n510\n00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.320\nWe also have the ability to\ncreate the dynamic disks.\n\n511\n00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.950\nRight?\nIt doesn't allocate and\n\n512\n00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.770\nreserve all, the whole portion or\ncapacity of the drive right away, but\n\n513\n00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.490\nas it grows over time,\nit can expand up to that.\n\n514\n00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:18.676\nSo here inside KVM,\nwhat options do we have Ronny?\n\n515\n00:29:18.676 --> 00:29:23.340\n>> You have one option, which is that\nit does the static file size for\n\n516\n00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.400\nthat initial drive image that we have.\n\n517\n00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.060\nSo they don't like to\ncall them hard drive,\n\n518\n00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.770\nthey essentially call them image files,\nis what they call them.\n\n519\n00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.150\nBut it works in the same way.\n\n520\n00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:36.860\nSo just like what we've been calling\nas a virtual hard drives, or VHD files,\n\n521\n00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.060\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n522\n00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.550\nHere inside of VirtualBox,\nthey'll call them image files,\n\n523\n00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.420\nis what they'll call them.\n\n524\n00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.830\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n525\n00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.470\nIt works the same way.\n\n526\n00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:49.810\nBut when you create this, it really\ndoes allocate the space right away.\n\n527\n00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.430\nSo it doesn't actually say\nI'll dynamically fill it.\n\n528\n00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.870\nIt is really designed for that production\nenvironment, where it says look,\n\n529\n00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.590\nwe're not gonna play around with this,\nand then later on try and\n\n530\n00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.900\nchange it and configure it.\n\n531\n00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.690\nIt really wants to actually hit\nyou with that initial performance.\n\n532\n00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.160\n>> So\nit's kind of like having options only not.\n\n533\n00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.780\n>> Yeah.\n\n534\n00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.280\nYeah to a point when you\ntake a look at it that way.\n\n535\n00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.430\nSo what you're probably seeing is\nthat even though you can run this\n\n536\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.490\nin a test environment it means you have\nto pay more attention to the amount of\n\n537\n00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.330\nresources that you have if you're actually\ngonna be building these machines and\n\n538\n00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:23.940\nassigning it pretty large of\nimage file sizes instead.\n\n539\n00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:28.150\nSo, it does require a little bit more\nmonitoring at the very beginning, and\n\n540\n00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.760\nrequires you to kind of allocate a little\nbit more carefully, but it is designed for\n\n541\n00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.725\noverall performance, and we do want\nto make sure that we understand that.\n\n542\n00:30:36.725 --> 00:30:39.280\nKVM, as neat as it is to learn, and\n\n543\n00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.210\nsomething that you can do your probably\nnot gonna make more than two or\n\n544\n00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:46.090\nthree VMs, but in a real production\nenvironment, you may be making 50 or\n\n545\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.090\n60 of these things, and so we can still do\nsome of those other things that we would\n\n546\n00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.680\ndo with the other types of hypervisors,\nsuch as cloning and doing other things.\n\n547\n00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.920\nBut remember that if you're gonna clone\nand you're gonna say I'm gonna make a 200\n\n548\n00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.540\ngig hard drive, it's gonna clone and\ncreate a 200 gig hard drive again.\n\n549\n00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.000\nAnd you go, I wanna clone it again.\n\n550\n00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.360\nIt's gonna create another one.\n\n551\n00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.520\nAnd pretty soon you're gonna run out\nof dry space if you're not careful.\n\n552\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.490\nSo you do need to make sure you understand\nthat those resource requirements\n\n553\n00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:13.430\nare gonna be static,\nis what we actually have to think about.\n\n554\n00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.910\nAnd rarely do we see the idea\nof dynamically expanding or\n\n555\n00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.420\nshrinking of these drives when\nwe start dealing with them.\n\n556\n00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.440\nSo initial of the caviendo,\nyou start to actually feel and\n\n557\n00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.790\nsee that, hey,\nthis is at a different level.\n\n558\n00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:32.010\nAnd it's not at a different level\nin terms of so much better, right?\n\n559\n00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.650\nIt's just different in the way that\nwe have to get started and managed.\n\n560\n00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.810\nIt's no longer just install the file and\nwalk through the wizard.\n\n561\n00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.120\nWes, is the one that you go,\n\n562\n00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.750\nall right, I need to learn these commands,\nI need to be a little bit patient and\n\n563\n00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:50.700\ntype in this stuff, and watch it actually\ninstall, and still control it but\n\n564\n00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:54.210\nthe good things is the overhead is so\nsmall than the production environment,\n\n565\n00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:58.400\nmore and more people are using it because,\nwell, it's actually open source as well.\n\n566\n00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.920\nSo that's what you're actually\nstarting to see here.\n\n567\n00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.000\nAnd now we're almost there, but we're\nnot completely done with the hardware\n\n568\n00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.990\nconfiguration because it does require you\nto setup a few thing if you want that\n\n569\n00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:14.460\nmachine to actually not have an image\nfile that works as a hard drive, but\n\n570\n00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.230\nif you want it to also connect\nout to rest of the world,\n\n571\n00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.370\nif you also need to make\nsome different ones.\n\n572\n00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.200\nIt means, you just have to go in and\nyou have to manually actually identify\n\n573\n00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:28.470\nhow this is gonna be done, but we need\nto save that for a different episode,\n\n574\n00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.485\nbecause Wes,\nyou let me talk too long again.\n\n575\n00:32:30.485 --> 00:32:32.260\n>> [LAUGH] Well,\nI can't interrupt you on that one.\n\n576\n00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.120\nGreat information.\n\n577\n00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.410\nKeep in mind one of the things that we\nhave been mentioning consistently through\n\n578\n00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:39.470\nthis series is that if you are going\nto make a virtual machine,\n\n579\n00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.760\nyou need to plan accordingly.\n\n580\n00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.690\nAnd like Ronnie has showed us here,\nyou really gotta prepare accordingly for\n\n581\n00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.850\nthis one,\nbecause that static drive image, or\n\n582\n00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.850\nthe static image itself; it can\naccrue a lot of hard drive space.\n\n583\n00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:54.440\nWe've also looked at what\nare the hardware requirements for\n\n584\n00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.480\nthe KVM software, and\nhow to verify that you do\n\n585\n00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.330\nhave the hardware requirements inside of\nyour system before you go to install it.\n\n586\n00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.130\nKeeping that in mind.\n\n587\n00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.200\nRemember, KVM, you can install it and\nnot have the requirement so\n\n588\n00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.550\nyou also have to make sure\nthat you do your research.\n\n589\n00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.030\nWe've also looked at things\nlike packet installation.\n\n590\n00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.260\nOnce you install the software,\n\n591\n00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.760\na lot of the other hypervisors have\nall of the software ready to go.\n\n592\n00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.660\nAll you have to do is click\non a couple of buttons.\n\n593\n00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.030\nIt's not gonna be that easy here in KVM so\n\n594\n00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.686\nyou're gonna have to-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n595\n00:33:20.686 --> 00:33:22.104\n>> Make sure that you install\n\n596\n00:33:22.104 --> 00:33:26.681\nthe appropriate packages once you've\ndownloaded them, that they are present, so\n\n597\n00:33:26.681 --> 00:33:29.200\nthat you can start working\nwith the software.\n\n598\n00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.690\nRonnie anything else for us on this one?\n\n599\n00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.940\n>> Well, just kind of remember,\nit does take a little bit of time.\n\n600\n00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:37.270\nIf you're really good at the bash command\nline, this is probably gonna be second\n\n601\n00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.530\nhat to you and\nit's not gonna be anything different.\n\n602\n00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:43.570\nIf you're used to working that graphical\nuser environment don't get me wrong,\n\n603\n00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:47.670\nthere are third party utilities out there\nthat might make some things a little easy,\n\n604\n00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.740\nbut the process I've just showed\nyou is not gonna get any easier.\n\n605\n00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.870\nSo you need to at least learn that much if\nyou know that you're gonna be working in\n\n606\n00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:55.920\nthe KVM environment.\n\n607\n00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.240\nFrom that point,\nyou can actually pick and choose flavors.\n\n608\n00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.000\nAnd we'll see that in a future\nepisode where we talk about\n\n609\n00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.020\na few of those different types of\nmanagers that are out there as well.\n\n610\n00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.640\nSo don't think we're actually\nanywhere close to the end.\n\n611\n00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:11.150\n>> Ronnie, thanks as always for being\nhere with us and exploring the software.\n\n612\n00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.190\nBut it looks like we have come to\nthe end of another great episode here.\n\n613\n00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.240\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off,\nand I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n614\n00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.080\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n615\n00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.218\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n616\n00:34:19.218 --> 00:34:25.090\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "description": "In this episode Ronnie and Wes continue their discussion on Kernel-based Virtual Machine or KVM. They look at how to set up network communication by creating a bridged network adapter. They show how to configure forwarding in IPTables for the KVM platform.

00:00:16.697\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in this episode,\n\n4\n00:00:16.697 --> 00:00:18.795\nwe're gonna be moving\nalong in virtualization.\n\n5\n00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.465\nAnd this is actually a part two to\nthe kernel-based virtual machines.\n\n6\n00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:24.205\nIn the first part of this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:28.480\nwe showed you how to\nInstall the KVM software,\n\n8\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.700\nhow to verity package installation, how\nto perform the package installation, but\n\n9\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.140\nwe haven't done the configuration yet, so\nwe got Ronnie Wong here to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.150\nRonnie, how you doing today, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.790\n>> I'm doing fine as we continue to\ntake a look at using the Linux KVM,\n\n12\n00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.150\nthat virtualization technology that really\nis part of the Linux kernel itself today.\n\n13\n00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.460\nSo the neat thing about that, right,\n\n14\n00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.140\nis that we're not having to\ndownload any additional tools.\n\n15\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.460\nIt really does fall more in line with like\nthe Microsoft Hyper-V which is part of\n\n16\n00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.980\nthe operating system itself.\n\n17\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.920\nWell today with KVM it's\nactually kinda built into\n\n18\n00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.090\nthe Linux distro itself as well.\n\n19\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.460\nAs long as you have the Intel VT or\nthe AMDV then you can go ahead and\n\n20\n00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.382\nactually turn those features on Download\nthe packages that you need to and\n\n21\n00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:14.540\nypur new [INAUDIBLE] machine will work\n\n22\n00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.280\nperfectly fine, allow you to run\nvirtual machines on them as well.\n\n23\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.820\nNow remember that even though this is one\nof the higher, I don't want to say that.\n\n24\n00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.580\nIt's one of the neatest and\n\n25\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.530\nalso of course one of these high\nperformance types of [INAUDIBLE] that we\n\n26\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.030\nhave I don't want to compare it in terms\nof super performance because everybody\n\n27\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.710\nwill always argue their particular\nmachine versus mine and stuff like that.\n\n28\n00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.420\nIt is one of those high performance\n\n29\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.880\nend type of virtualization\ntechnologies that we have.\n\n30\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.340\nThe key behind this though,\n\n31\n00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.010\nis to remember that most people like\nit and organizations are moving to it.\n\n32\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.620\nBecause it is an open source\ntype of virtualization\n\n33\n00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.570\nthat is by far the most popular one and\nthat means that most companies can deal\n\n34\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.940\nwith it because it cost over utilization\nof it is really low by comparison.\n\n35\n00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.920\nNow when we say that right the time\nwere actually comes a little bit\n\n36\n00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.340\nmore expensive not in dollar cost but\nin time and\n\n37\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.100\ntraining Is that in the beginning\nin building virtual machines,\n\n38\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.990\na lot of times it does requires somebody\nto be fairly handy with the command line\n\n39\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.170\ninside of Linux and if you're not, then\nit becomes a little bit more challenging.\n\n40\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.330\nAnd so now,\nit start slowing down your progress\n\n41\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330\nin terms of getting virtual\nmachines up and running.\n\n42\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.440\nSo we did take a look at\nthe process of installing.\n\n43\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.530\nKVM at the beginning but we're not done\nyet and the reason why is that it is\n\n44\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.350\na little bit more complicated to get\nstarted in building a virtual machine and\n\n45\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.400\nthat is because a hardware really\ndoes need to be considered\n\n46\n00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.800\nright from the beginning here where\nyou're not able to just go in and go out.\n\n47\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.020\nWe'll just do a default config and\nthen will change it later.\n\n48\n00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.740\nA lot of times, your default config is\nactually something that you're gonna stick\n\n49\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.190\nwith inside of Linux.\n\n50\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.860\nAnd to tell you the truth, there isn't\nactually a default configuration wizard\n\n51\n00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.960\nfor us that we just say typical or\nwe just click and go on through and\n\n52\n00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.150\ndo whatever we want to.\n\n53\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.420\nYou really do have to assign\nthe resources that you want,\n\n54\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.220\nand a lot of times you have to do\nthat right at the beginning and\n\n55\n00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.570\nthen you're not gonna be\nchanging them once it's over.\n\n56\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.950\n>> Now you had mentioned in that the first\npart of this episode here that when you do\n\n57\n00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.790\nspeaking of assigning those resources that\n\n58\n00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.420\nthe KVM software makes\na static disc image.\n\n59\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.700\nAnd one of the things that was\nrunning was mentioned if you say,\n\n60\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.510\nokay I'm gonna create\na 200 gig disc image.\n\n61\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.060\nYou don't get the dynamic aspect, you\ndon't get the ability to have it grow over\n\n62\n00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.940\ntime, so if you haven't even installed\nanything, you're gonna be at 200 gigs, so\n\n63\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.410\nyou have to plan carefully, right Ronnie?\n\n64\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.230\n>> You do, planning is really kinda\nthe key here to making it work\n\n65\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.530\nmuch more efficiently when\nyou start dealing with KVM.\n\n66\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.350\nSo if your organization is dealing with\nit, you understand at least those aspects.\n\n67\n00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.190\nThe good thing is, you and I, we're just\nbeginning in virtualization technology.\n\n68\n00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.960\nThis is probably not the first\none we would end up choosing, but\n\n69\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.990\nit is something you're gonna probably\nend up seeing or dealing with.\n\n70\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.920\nAnd sometimes, once that's done right,\n\n71\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.290\nyou at least have a,\nonce we're done, excuse me.\n\n72\n00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.020\nOnce we're done with this series,\nyou will at least have an understanding\n\n73\n00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.850\nof what goes into making\nKVM at least start for you.\n\n74\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.470\nAnd how a basic creation of\na virtual machine begins.\n\n75\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.990\nSo that's where we're heading now,\nis now that we finished getting\n\n76\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.690\nthat KVM installed, we now need to do\nsome of the hardware considerations for\n\n77\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.570\nthe virtual machines that you and\nI will be creating.\n\n78\n00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.800\nAnd one of those has to of course\nbe the network adapter right away.\n\n79\n00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.080\nAnd the reason for that is because\nof the only default that's set for\n\n80\n00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.180\nthe hardware A lot of times is gonna\nbe the network adapter and KVM.\n\n81\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.540\nAnd that means we have to change it.\n\n82\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.800\nWell, why?\n\n83\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.600\nBecause default configurations for the\nnetwork adapter that we use inside of KVM,\n\n84\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.340\nfor our virtual machines, is going\nto allow all the virtual machines to\n\n85\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.810\ncommunicate with, well,\nthe other virtual machines, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.710\nIt will also generally allow for the\ncommunication between the guest operating\n\n87\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.260\nsystem the virtual machine, and the host\nmachine that is also running on as well.\n\n88\n00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.150\nSo it will actually allow for\nboth of those to go on.\n\n89\n00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.950\nBut the problem that we have is it's\nnot gonna allow for communication\n\n90\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.550\nAnywhere else in order to another network\ndevice or even out to the internet.\n\n91\n00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.320\n>> Now you mentioned that this is not as\nintuitive as some of the other hypervisors\n\n92\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.230\nthat we've seen and you know, based on\nthat explanation and the first thing I can\n\n93\n00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.912\nthink of it is if you're in Windows Server\n2012 R2 and you install the Hyper-V role.\n\n94\n00:05:32.912 --> 00:05:33.440\nRight?\n\n95\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.530\nThe moment you install Hyper-V role\nyou already have network access.\n\n96\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.970\nThe operating system, the server it\ncan communicate with the network and\n\n97\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.910\nwe don't really have to configure it as\nfar as the host operating system goes.\n\n98\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.980\nSo this does look like it\nis a big departure for\n\n99\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.920\nsome of the technologies we've seen.\n\n100\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.440\n>> It really is an unusual\ndeparture in this way but\n\n101\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.320\nwith the way of actually\nworking a command line.\n\n102\n00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.040\nIt's because they expect\nyou to control everything.\n\n103\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.520\nSo that is the first\nthing we are going to do.\n\n104\n00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.310\nIs we are actually going to end up\ncreating what we call a bridged\n\n105\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.440\nnetwork adapter.\n\n106\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.250\nIs what's going to end up happening here.\n\n107\n00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.530\nAnd we're going to change the standard\nnetwork adapter profile to allow for\n\n108\n00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.400\nthis bridge connection to work.\n\n109\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.620\nSo remember what a bridged\nadapter really turns out to be.\n\n110\n00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.090\nIt's a virtual network adapter, which\nmeans that it allows my virtual machine to\n\n111\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.370\nclaim itself as a network adapter but\nthen we bridge it to the actual\n\n112\n00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.320\nphysical adapter so\nthat it can communicate out onto network.\n\n113\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.160\nGenerally the way that bridge\nnetwork adapters end up working is\n\n114\n00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.600\nthat your host machine\nhas its own IP address.\n\n115\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.830\nAnd then when you have a bridged\nadapter the bridged adapter also gets\n\n116\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.000\nanother IP address on the network\nthat you're plugged into.\n\n117\n00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.330\nSo even though you're running\noff of one physical machine.\n\n118\n00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.010\nin essence, what ends up happening with\na bridge network adapter is the network\n\n119\n00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.080\nactually sees two machines running because\nyou have one for your guest operating\n\n120\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.790\nsystem and you have one of course for\nyour host machine working and so\n\n121\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.380\nif we need that guest VM to\nbe able to connect out to\n\n122\n00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.730\nnetwork in the KVM, we have to create\nwhat we call a bridged adapter.\n\n123\n00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.600\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee the process of doing this.\n\n124\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.370\nAnd so remember,\nwe're actually configuring the hardware\n\n125\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.260\nto make it match up so that when we create\nthe VMs, we can attach it directly there.\n\n126\n00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.100\nSo the default network adapter we\nare essentially going to change here\n\n127\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.320\nto allow this.\n\n128\n00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.690\nHere it is on my machine.\n\n129\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.288\nI'm gonna open up that command line,\nthat terminal and\n\n130\n00:07:27.288 --> 00:07:29.750\nthen give myself supervisor access.\n\n131\n00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.170\nAnd now we're gonna open\nup that network adapter.\n\n132\n00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.230\nTo find that network adapter,\n\n133\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.260\nyou need this number right\nhere where it says System.\n\n134\n00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.320\nAnd there it is, F0.\n\n135\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.580\nAnd it's actually located\nin a certain location.\n\n136\n00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.430\nAnd we have to use a text editor.\n\n137\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.220\nSo the text that I'm using is\nactually VI I always call it vi.\n\n138\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.490\nI think they actually call it VI.\n\n139\n00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.768\nAnd then it's inside of etc.\n\n140\n00:07:53.768 --> 00:07:58.508\nSysconfig and this time it's\nnetwork dash Scripts is the one,\n\n141\n00:07:58.508 --> 00:08:03.150\nI've mistyped this before and\ntyped in network script.\n\n142\n00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.600\nThat will open up nothing, so\njust kind of make sure you know that.\n\n143\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:13.110\nMake sure it's network scripts here and\nthen CFG and then at zero.\n\n144\n00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.660\nAnd when I do that,\nnotice that there it is.\n\n145\n00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.220\nThere's the configuration file for\n\n146\n00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.860\nthat network adapter that's\nactually in not my virtual machine.\n\n147\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.910\nBut actually in the machine itself, and\n\n148\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.430\nyou see the actual device\ntype that we have.\n\n149\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.230\nI need to change this to the network\nmonitor being controlled to no, and\n\n150\n00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.280\nI need to create a bridge that this\nis going to recognize as well.\n\n151\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:33.890\nSo what I'm doing,\n\n152\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.010\nis I'm telling that physical network\nadapter to also recognize the bridge.\n\n153\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.190\nNow, once I'm actually inside of\nVI to be able to change stuff,\n\n154\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.140\nI type in the letter i.\n\n155\n00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:49.040\nI can come down here to NM_CONTROLLED\nusing my arrow keys, and then no.\n\n156\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.700\nAnd then I need to add in\nthe name of a new bridge,\n\n157\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.550\nI'm just gonna add it in at the end here.\n\n158\n00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.830\nAnd I'll type in the word BRIDGE=br0\n\n159\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.540\nis what I'm going to call it so that's\ngonna be the initial bridge that we have.\n\n160\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.380\nTo get out of this I do an escape and\nthen a capital Z Z and\n\n161\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.440\nthat kicks me out of thar files and\nsaves the changes at the same time.\n\n162\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.480\nSo that's what we want\nto make sure that we do.\n\n163\n00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.960\nSo those changes are now saved,\nif I do a check config, or a CHK config.\n\n164\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.781\nI'm going to just make sure that\nthe network manager is off.\n\n165\n00:09:32.343 --> 00:09:35.980\nAnd I'm not getting any complaints so\nthere it is, it's actually off there.\n\n166\n00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.810\nAnd then the other one is I want\nto verify that the network is on.\n\n167\n00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.540\nSo it's gonna be chkconfig,\nand then network.\n\n168\n00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:51.050\nVerify that that is now on, and\nthen we're gonna go ahead and\n\n169\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.990\nstop the network manager service.\n\n170\n00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.950\nAnd all of this, of course,\nis gonna be case sensitive.\n\n171\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.260\nSo you do want to make\nsure that you do that.\n\n172\n00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.280\nSo let me make sure here, and network\nservice is stopped is what we want.\n\n173\n00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.755\nAnd notice,\nthere it is stopping the network daemon.\n\n174\n00:10:08.755 --> 00:10:11.280\nOkay is what we have here and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n175\n00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.760\nAnd then I want to take\nthe service network and\n\n176\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.130\nthen start the overall network service.\n\n177\n00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.090\nSo now everything is good.\n\n178\n00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.550\nSo now the network adaptor just\nkind of blinked on and off, so\n\n179\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.060\nif you were connected to something it\nmay go ahead and also disconnect you and\n\n180\n00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.730\nthen come back on, is what we have now.\n\n181\n00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:36.530\nNow that we've got that, that br0 that I\nadded in to the physical network adaptor,\n\n182\n00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.700\nI now need to create that file,\nis what I need to be able to do here.\n\n183\n00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.990\nSo I'm gonna use the same thing, I'm gonna\nuse vi and then inside that location,\n\n184\n00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.760\nthe same place where we were,\n\n185\n00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:58.260\nnetwork-scripts/ifcfg-br0.\n\n186\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.130\nThis one does not exist\nIf I now press return, and\n\n187\n00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.360\nI enter into there, you'll notice that\nthe file's actually completely blank.\n\n188\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.590\nNow, I need to describe this device,\nso the letter I to get me inserted.\n\n189\n00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.240\nAnd then I describe the device,\nand the device again,\n\n190\n00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.480\nremember that this file also\nis gonna be case sensitive.\n\n191\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:27.140\nThis is gonna be br0, and then we also\nwant to specify the boot up protocol.\n\n192\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:35.490\nNow this is BOOTPROTO, oops, PROTO= and\nthis one, we're gonna say dhcp.\n\n193\n00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.010\nNow we can set a static\nIP address if we want to.\n\n194\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.900\nIf we do that, the static IP address will\nbe a couple of different lines at follow.\n\n195\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.100\nIPAddr and\n\n196\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.920\nof course you type in your IP address as\nwell as well as netmask=, you'll do that.\n\n197\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.710\nBut since we're actually just\ndoing just boot protocol for\n\n198\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.590\nIPv4 we're not worried about.\n\n199\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.440\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nalso do IPv6 here, the reason\n\n200\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.710\nwhy is because you're than likely going\nto be seeing this in your future.\n\n201\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.590\nAnd if you do so, you need to know\nthat that is gonna be initialized and\n\n202\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:14.292\nturned on IPV6, and\n\n203\n00:12:14.292 --> 00:12:22.370\nthis is gonna be +AUTOCONFIG,\n\n204\n00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.090\nand that's telling it to go ahead and\njust do the auto configuration.\n\n205\n00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.040\nWhich is probably what\nwe're gonna actually want.\n\n206\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.766\nAnd tell it to turn it on so we don't have\nto worry about assigning it an IP address,\n\n207\n00:12:32.766 --> 00:12:33.361\neven there.\n\n208\n00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:36.524\nAnd then NM_CONTROLLED, so\n\n209\n00:12:36.524 --> 00:12:41.837\nremember we just turned\noff the network manager or\n\n210\n00:12:41.837 --> 00:12:45.260\nmonitor, and that will be a no.\n\n211\n00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.045\nAnd on boot.\n\n212\n00:12:51.045 --> 00:12:54.150\nHere, and we want it to\nactually be recognized on boot.\n\n213\n00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.551\nAnd then the type here\nis gonna be a bridge.\n\n214\n00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:04.540\nAnd then the delay is the last one, here.\n\n215\n00:13:06.978 --> 00:13:09.360\nAnd we're gonna tell\nthem the delay of zero.\n\n216\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.630\nOkay, so you might be wondering like\nwhere in the world am I gonna learn this?\n\n217\n00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.010\nThis is where you have to do a little bit\nmore searching on the internet, right?\n\n218\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.420\nSo we're just trying to\nget enough information for\n\n219\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.210\nus to build a virtual machine that can\nuse this bridge network adapter so\n\n220\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:27.010\nit can actually connect outside of our\nphysical machine once we create our VM.\n\n221\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.440\nSo it does take a bit of\nconfiguration here for us to do this.\n\n222\n00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:38.050\nSo, I'll do, and I again have escaped and\nthen Z Z to help me out.\n\n223\n00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.600\nNow you use a different editor, you of\ncourse actually know how to do that,\n\n224\n00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.450\nbut that's what it takes so if you're\nalready intimidated then I understand.\n\n225\n00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.540\nBut at least understand that\nthis is what has to be done.\n\n226\n00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.020\nIf you just create a basic VM,\n\n227\n00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.870\nthat's perfectly fine as long as you\ndon't ever need it to connect outside\n\n228\n00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.040\nof that host machine,\nthen you don't have to worry about this.\n\n229\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.160\nBut if you do,\nyou do need to create this bridge,\n\n230\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.870\nthe physical network adapter\nhave to be bridged to it.\n\n231\n00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.840\nThat's where we added in that word,\nbridge, as well,\n\n232\n00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.110\nto enter into the physical adapter.\n\n233\n00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:14.920\nIf you don't turn off the network monitor\ncontrol of the network manager control,\n\n234\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.990\nyou'll see that that element will\nalso interfere with the bridging.\n\n235\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.020\nSo you wanna make sure that\nthose elements are actually off.\n\n236\n00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.070\nSo that was kind of the hardest\npart of the physical configuration.\n\n237\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:30.010\nThat you and I have to deal with,\nbut it does have to be done okay?\n\n238\n00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.130\nSo this is not something that you can\ngo oh let me just check mark this and\n\n239\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.170\nthen switch to this adapter.\n\n240\n00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:40.170\nIt's not gonna be there and\navailable for you easily inside of KVM.\n\n241\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.150\nSo this is part of what has to be\nset up if you're gonna do this.\n\n242\n00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.660\nNow once we've got that done,\nthe nice thing is.\n\n243\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.700\nThat really is, that is the hardest\npart of the configuration.\n\n244\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.020\nNow, the other thing that we have to do\nfor our virtual machine to communicate off\n\n245\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:59.420\nof the physical machine is that we now\nneed to go ahead and add in a firewall\n\n246\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:05.170\nrule that will allow us to forward\nthat bridge traffic as what we need.\n\n247\n00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.650\nSo this is where we get into\nsomething that we call IP\n\n248\n00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.610\ntables that's normally running\nif this is what you're doing.\n\n249\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.430\nSo you type in iptables, and\nthis is the same as the firewall.\n\n250\n00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.450\nIf you were in Windows,\nyou'd do this for your Windows firewall.\n\n251\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:24.550\nAnd so you do iptables, and then a capital\nA and FORWARD, if I can spell forward.\n\n252\n00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.029\nSo remember that this is\ngonna be case sensitive.\n\n253\n00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.394\nAnd then it just depends on your\nname of your network device, so\n\n254\n00:15:32.394 --> 00:15:35.383\nI'm just saying this is gonna\nbe your physical device.\n\n255\n00:15:35.383 --> 00:15:39.523\nSo for us, this would be eth0, okay, and\n\n256\n00:15:39.523 --> 00:15:43.893\nthen we would also go ahead and\ndo a dash here.\n\n257\n00:15:43.893 --> 00:15:47.518\nAnd now you can give it a name,\n\n258\n00:15:47.518 --> 00:15:51.724\na descriptive name if you want to,\n\n259\n00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:57.100\nwhich is eth0 is bridged and\nthen you do a J.\n\n260\n00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.806\nAnd then type in the word ACCEPT.\n\n261\n00:15:58.806 --> 00:16:00.330\nSo a -j and ACCEPT.\n\n262\n00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.760\nAnd that will create a firewall rule\nthen like the one that I shared here.\n\n263\n00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.100\nSo it couldn't match for this one, so\n\n264\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.020\nit did not like something that I\ntyped in here in the one for enth0.\n\n265\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.882\nLet me see if I can actually do,\n\n266\n00:16:14.882 --> 00:16:18.410\nmaybe I should have just done\nwhat I typed in here instead.\n\n267\n00:16:20.644 --> 00:16:24.624\nSo I'm just gonna see if it will allow\nme to do a generic recognition of what I\n\n268\n00:16:24.624 --> 00:16:26.680\ntyped in earlier here.\n\n269\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.540\nThere we go.\n\n270\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.520\nSo, instead I was trying to be fancy and\nkinda give it a direct name,\n\n271\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.640\nbut I was able to look for\nthe physical device instead.\n\n272\n00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.710\nSo this way I just change it\nback to what I had typed in.\n\n273\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.940\nSo just kinda realize you have\nto open up this firewall rule.\n\n274\n00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.670\nAll right, so\nnow with that rule that we have ready and\n\n275\n00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:48.080\nset up with the IP tables, we now\nneed to initiate forwarding as well.\n\n276\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.850\nSo we have to go in and\nwe have to modify one more file here.\n\n277\n00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.550\nSo we're going to do that.\n\n278\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.880\nLet's see what I need is going to be able\nto get access into the sysconfig file.\n\n279\n00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.407\nSo I need vi, and then /etc/sysctl or\n\n280\n00:17:04.407 --> 00:17:08.600\nsystem control file.conf.\n\n281\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.690\nAnd now you can see where there's\na kernel sys configuration file.\n\n282\n00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:18.420\nAnd I need to add in inet forward,\nthere it is.\n\n283\n00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.600\nSo, you can actually see it's right here,\nit controls IP packet forwarding, and\n\n284\n00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.860\nI need to change this to a 1 is\nwhat I need to be able to do.\n\n285\n00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.610\nSo I simply type in a i,\nchange that, oops.\n\n286\n00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:36.180\nSee that's where I have to\nactually kind of be careful there.\n\n287\n00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.250\nSo net.ipv4, change this to a 1,\n\n288\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.830\nessentially telling it to\nforward those packets.\n\n289\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.240\nDo an Escape, and then z z.\n\n290\n00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.830\nAnd we are out and\nwe are ready to go here.\n\n291\n00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.226\nSo if I take a look at this\nparticular file here let see,\n\n292\n00:17:54.226 --> 00:17:58.869\nsysctl -p and\n\n293\n00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:01.910\nthen try and see if I can type this in.\n\n294\n00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.926\nMake sure I actually have it correct here.\n\n295\n00:18:09.191 --> 00:18:10.845\nIt says it couldn't do that,\n\n296\n00:18:10.845 --> 00:18:14.690\nbut there it is it's actually showing\nme that here's a way I verify.\n\n297\n00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.160\nSo I'm actually seeing where\nthis should be forwarding,\n\n298\n00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.920\neverything should be good, and\nthat's what I want as well.\n\n299\n00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.470\nSo now that we've confirmed that\nthe IP forwarding is working,\n\n300\n00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.250\nI need to restart\nthe actual network adapter.\n\n301\n00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.980\nSo I'm going to do service network restart\n\n302\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.320\nand in a moment you should see it where\nit's shutting down that bridge interface\n\n303\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.660\nthat we connected and also the ethernet\nzero, the physical adapter and\n\n304\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.980\nnow it's actually determining that and\nnow notice its bringing it up and\n\n305\n00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.350\nwe are getting and OK,\nwe're getting note OK for the bridge.\n\n306\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.324\nSo everything is good, my bridge adapter,\nmy physical adapter, everything is okay,\n\n307\n00:18:51.324 --> 00:18:53.270\neverything should be running.\n\n308\n00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.020\nNow we have one last thing that we have\nto worry about which is what we call\n\n309\n00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.200\nSE Linux.\n\n310\n00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.960\nAnd so if you're not actually doing\nanything else, believe it or not,\n\n311\n00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.100\nmost of the physical configuration\nthat will help enhance your VMs in\n\n312\n00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.610\nrunning the way that they should work,\nwe shouldn't have to go any further.\n\n313\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.100\nBut a lot of times, when we save\nour image files inside a KVM or\n\n314\n00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.160\nvirtual hard disk, inside of\nlet's say like Microsoft Hyper V.\n\n315\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.570\nThey're saving in a weird location\nthat's very difficult to find, right?\n\n316\n00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:24.490\nSo inside the Hyper-V, it's like your user\nprofile, and then inside of your documents\n\n317\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.150\nor downloads or whatever it is, and then\nthere's folder called virtual machines or\n\n318\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.600\nsomething like that,\nit actually saves somewhere like that.\n\n319\n00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.652\nBut now if you actually go\ninside of KVM here, the location\n\n320\n00:19:37.652 --> 00:19:46.070\nis actually /var/lib/libvert/images,\nso it's a bit of an unusual location.\n\n321\n00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:51.040\nSo if I wanna change this, it's also gonna\nrequire me to change the security context\n\n322\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.840\nand that means going in and\nmodifying something in SELinux.\n\n323\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.120\nSo most of us are probably\ngonna end up doing this.\n\n324\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.710\nSo if I go ahead and do a MKDIR to\nmake a new directory, I'm gonna\n\n325\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:06.010\nmake a new directory called VM and\nI'm gonna place it in the route as well.\n\n326\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.300\nSo it says it can't create and\nthe file already exists, and\n\n327\n00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.770\nthe reason why is that I had already\ncreated that particular directory\n\n328\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.920\na little bit before the show here and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n329\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.670\nSo I'm gonna actually use this instead.\n\n330\n00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.120\nSo, inside of SELinux here,\nI need to change something.\n\n331\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.270\nAnd the way that I do this is by adding\nin another package, is what I need to do.\n\n332\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:33.340\nSo I'm gonna do a yum -y, to tell it to\ngo ahead and answer a yes to the install\n\n333\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:40.920\nprocess of something that we\ncall policycoreutils-python.\n\n334\n00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.540\nAnd make sure that I\nspelled that right and\n\n335\n00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:50.130\nit looks like I did,\npolicycoreutils-python.\n\n336\n00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.850\nAnd then, press enter and now we actually\nsee where it's actually seeing that\n\n337\n00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.360\neverything is actually checking and\nit's downloading the packages so,\n\n338\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.080\nit's gonna take a moment here and\ndownload those packages.\n\n339\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.000\nAnd now, notice it's installing without\nme having to enter in anything.\n\n340\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.320\nSo, the process is beginning where\nwe're actually being able do this.\n\n341\n00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.140\nThis will give me that ability to change\nthe context of that default location,\n\n342\n00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.240\nbeing able to access what it needs to.\n\n343\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.300\nAnd now we're saying, hey, that VMs\nfolder, we're going to allow those VMs to\n\n344\n00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.750\nbe able to be accessed as well and\nused in that, too.\n\n345\n00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.250\nSo it does take a moment of time here.\n\n346\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.560\nBut once it's done installing,\nwe'll go in and\n\n347\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.370\nwe'll change that little security\ncontact with two different,\n\n348\n00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.310\nactually one command line, and then\nwe'll verify the setting here as well.\n\n349\n00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.550\nNotice it tells me that it's complete.\n\n350\n00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.850\nSo now that I have the utilities that I\nneed to, there is something that we call\n\n351\n00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:45.890\nsemanage, okay, and that's really what\nthis brings up is a management utility for\n\n352\n00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:52.416\nthe SELinux and then we're gonna\nchange the actual context here so\n\n353\n00:21:52.416 --> 00:21:58.090\nfcontext --add and\n\n354\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:02.850\nthen a t and what I'm telling you is for\nthe virtual images.\n\n355\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.095\nAnd there's gonna be -t.\n\n356\n00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.940\nAnd now I need to tell it the location\nthat I want it to do it in.\n\n357\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.720\nSo, I think this is gonna be a single\nquote, or maybe a double quote.\n\n358\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.210\nAnd then I'm gonna also\ntell it to look for\n\n359\n00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:24.090\nany of the actual subdirectories\nthat are also listed there as well.\n\n360\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.340\nNow the rest of these commands you're\nactually starting to see them, right?\n\n361\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.610\nSo all of this is actually where you start\nto see a little bit more of what we call\n\n362\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.720\nthe regular expressions, right?\n\n363\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.930\nSo there it is add this to\nthe security context, right?\n\n364\n00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.310\nIs right here beginning with bms and\n\n365\n00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.390\nthen any other sub directory\nthat we have right here.\n\n366\n00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.870\nSo anything that ends in\nwhatever that we have.\n\n367\n00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:49.580\nAnd then of course,\n\n368\n00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.860\nthere it is any characters that also\ncome after that is perfectly fine, too.\n\n369\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:59.110\nSo if I type that in correctly,\nnow we should end up seeing here,\n\n370\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.130\nit's actually gonna tell me\nit's an invalid, so it doesn't\n\n371\n00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:07.160\nlike what I did there, so I typed in\nsomething incorrectly is what happened.\n\n372\n00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:14.233\nLet me verify my [SOUND],\nmy typing is what I need.\n\n373\n00:23:14.233 --> 00:23:16.680\nSo, it is invalid.\n\n374\n00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.800\nIt may not like the dash t.\n\n375\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.860\nOh, I think that's a double for\none reason or another.\n\n376\n00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.020\nOh, I know, it's not supposed\nto be a dash, how's that?\n\n377\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.630\nLet's see, if it doesn't do it again,\n\n378\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:35.490\nthen I'll have to kind of take a look\nhere at how I mistyped something.\n\n379\n00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.970\nIt looks like it's gonna have a little\nbit of a hard, nope, there it goes.\n\n380\n00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.560\nSo it was just me, it was a typo.\n\n381\n00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.990\nSometimes I think that I can read my\nown typing correctly in my notes and\n\n382\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.160\nthen I don't.\n\n383\n00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.830\nSo there it is,\nit actually didn't complain.\n\n384\n00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:51.052\nTo verify that, semanage.\n\n385\n00:23:51.052 --> 00:23:55.583\nAnd then I can take a look in\nthat context that we need.\n\n386\n00:23:55.583 --> 00:23:59.057\nAnd tell it to go ahead and\ndo a listing of it.\n\n387\n00:23:59.057 --> 00:24:05.060\nAnd then we'll filter it out here,\nfor virt image and then t,\n\n388\n00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:12.230\nand in a moment we should see right\nhere whether or not everything is good.\n\n389\n00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.370\nAnd what I'm looking for are all the files\nthat are actually located in there, and\n\n390\n00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.020\nevery directory that's underneath that.\n\n391\n00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.730\nIf that's actually gonna work for me,\nthat's exactly what I want to see.\n\n392\n00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.400\nLast thing that's actually done then,\n\n393\n00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.050\nis to turn everything back\non in the security context.\n\n394\n00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.908\nSo, we do a restorecon -R -v, and\n\n395\n00:24:31.908 --> 00:24:36.922\nthen I'm gonna tell it\nto turn everything back\n\n396\n00:24:36.922 --> 00:24:43.496\nup to the regular settings that I had for\nthat context there.\n\n397\n00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:46.830\nNow it says unconfined,\nunconfined, and that looks fine.\n\n398\n00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:51.523\nSo it's reset everything,\nand then an -aZ, and\n\n399\n00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:55.676\nthen we'll see a VMS here,\nand there we go.\n\n400\n00:24:55.676 --> 00:25:00.861\nSo now you can actually see all the root\ncontext, everything is unconfined,\n\n401\n00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:05.806\nand there's all the permissions that\nwe actually need so that now the VM,\n\n402\n00:25:05.806 --> 00:25:09.554\nor the KVM can actually be able\nto access those files that\n\n403\n00:25:09.554 --> 00:25:11.901\nare actually inside that folder.\n\n404\n00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:15.587\nEverything is good and\nwe're now protected also by SELinux.\n\n405\n00:25:15.587 --> 00:25:18.560\nSo in every sense of the word right,\n\n406\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.623\nthis is now really the final state\nthat now we can create a VM.\n\n407\n00:25:23.623 --> 00:25:26.195\nIt should be able to get\noutside to the Internet, and\n\n408\n00:25:26.195 --> 00:25:29.411\nit should actually offer us the same\nfeatures that we normally see\n\n409\n00:25:29.411 --> 00:25:32.169\ninside of any other hypervisor\nthat we would work with.\n\n410\n00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:35.121\n>> Great information there Ronnie and\nnotice that this one's been a little bit\n\n411\n00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:38.175\ndifferent than some of the other\nhypervisors that we've been using, right?\n\n412\n00:25:38.175 --> 00:25:41.915\nFor instance, in server 2012 R2 there,\nspecifically Windows,\n\n413\n00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:44.605\nwhen I installed a Hyper V role,\nI get my network adapter ready.\n\n414\n00:25:44.605 --> 00:25:47.700\nI've got a nice little GUI, so\nnot so intuitive here, right?\n\n415\n00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.350\nYou have to get into the command line,\nyou've gotta be able to use that so\n\n416\n00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.040\nwe showed you how to\ncreate the network bridge,\n\n417\n00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.270\nas well as setting IP tables\nthat enable forwarding.\n\n418\n00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:03.270\nWe have also showed you how to use\nthe Linux Security module SE Linux\n\n419\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.690\nto implement mandatory access\ncontrol on the root location,\n\n420\n00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.820\nin this case where you're going\nto store those VM images.\n\n421\n00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.730\nRonnie, do you have anything else for\nus on this one?\n\n422\n00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:13.890\n>> Well, just remember, this is not for\n\n423\n00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.890\nthe faint at heart right at the beginning,\nbut it is something.\n\n424\n00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:21.700\nRegardless of where you are in your\nlevel of learning about virtualization,\n\n425\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.650\nexposure to this stuff should make\nyou feel a little bit more confident.\n\n426\n00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.490\nCuz you're starting to realize something,\nthat regardless of how complex it is,\n\n427\n00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.850\nsuch as KVM, if you've never actually\nworked with a command line and\n\n428\n00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.375\ndoing it, or whether you're actually\nworking with Type 2 hypervisors like\n\n429\n00:26:35.375 --> 00:26:40.640\nOracle's Virtual Box or anything else,\nit really helps you to do the same thing.\n\n430\n00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.420\nBut here we're getting better\nperformance cuz it has less overhead.\n\n431\n00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.220\nWe're also able to rely on that open\nsource technology, which again,\n\n432\n00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.240\na lot of companies really do like.\n\n433\n00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.890\nAnd because it is a little\nbit technically challenging,\n\n434\n00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.860\nit hopefully inspires you to be challenged\nto learn a little bit more about it.\n\n435\n00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.720\nVirtualization is a fun technology\nit really is, is it challenging?\n\n436\n00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.400\nYes, can it be frustrating?\n\n437\n00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.640\nLike me,\nI'm the worst typist in the world, and\n\n438\n00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.450\nyet I can still do it, I just have\nto be a little bit more careful.\n\n439\n00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.320\nAnd this is only gonna make you\na better IT technician all around.\n\n440\n00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.110\nSo jump in and you know,\n\n441\n00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.780\nmake sure you actually take advantage\nof the technology that's out there.\n\n442\n00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.510\nBecause I guarantee you the production\nenvironment's going to do it.\n\n443\n00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.210\nThe world around you is\nactually doing it as well.\n\n444\n00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:27.080\nSo you might as well go ahead and\nget up to speed on virtualization.\n\n445\n00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.430\n>> Ronnie as always, it's a pleasure\nto have you on the show here.\n\n446\n00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.817\nBut it looks like we have come to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n447\n00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:34.348\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n448\n00:27:34.348 --> 00:27:35.508\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n449\n00:27:35.508 --> 00:27:36.345\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n450\n00:27:36.345 --> 00:27:37.552\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n451\n00:27:37.552

00:00:16.025\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:19.405\nAnd in today's episode we're gonna\nbe moving through virtualization.\n\n5\n00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:22.455\nNow, in a couple of previous episodes\nwhat we've done is showed you how to get\n\n6\n00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:27.292\nthe Linux based KVM, the kernel\nbased virtual machine, installed and\n\n7\n00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:30.952\nthe packages that you need to make sure\nthat that software will run, installed and\n\n8\n00:00:30.952 --> 00:00:31.812\nverified.\n\n9\n00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:34.772\nBut what we haven't showed you yet\nis how to create a virtual machine.\n\n10\n00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:37.032\nSo, in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at creating and\n\n11\n00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:39.606\nmanaging virtual machines inside a KBM.\n\n12\n00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.206\nNow, we got Mr.\nRonnie Wong here to help us.\n\n13\n00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:42.246\nRonnie, how you doing, sir?\n\n14\n00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:45.459\n>> I'm doing fine,\nas we continue on to take a look at KVM.\n\n15\n00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:50.082\nReid, this particular product that we're\ntalking about here is a little bit more\n\n16\n00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:54.303\ntechnically challenging for us if we've\njust really started with type two\n\n17\n00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:59.110\nhypervisors like the Oracle's Virtual Box\nor even VMware's Workstation.\n\n18\n00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.630\nIn using those, we have a nice point and\nclick interface.\n\n19\n00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.500\nWell, in KVM we've kind of bypassed that,\nand\n\n20\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.060\nwe're actually moving into the realm of\nactually being able to manage and create,\n\n21\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.130\ninstall the hypervisor all\nusing the commandline.\n\n22\n00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.990\nNow, you might be wondering\nwhy are we doing that.\n\n23\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.120\nWell, it's because we're actually focusing\nin on installing some type of hypervisor\n\n24\n00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.290\nonto a Linux operating system.\n\n25\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.300\nNow, the good thing is you can actually\ntake something like a virtual box, right,\n\n26\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.220\nand actually install it in Linux.\n\n27\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.030\nYou can also take something\nlike VMWare workstation and\n\n28\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.160\nalso install that into Linux as well.\n\n29\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.730\nBut KVM is really designed for\na high performance production network.\n\n30\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.560\nIt allows you to install and\nbegin to use it just about right away.\n\n31\n00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.230\nSo, we did talk about that\nsolution a little bit, and\n\n32\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.350\nwe showed you all the things that need\nto be set up to make sure it actually\n\n33\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.370\nworks the way that it can work for\nus in that environment.\n\n34\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.640\nAnd you're starting to see more and\nmore of a push for people to adopt KVM,\n\n35\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.550\nand not to abandon the other technologies,\nbut\n\n36\n00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.940\nto actually see it as\nactually being a competitor,\n\n37\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.110\nif not actually being able to take\nover what we're actually seeing here.\n\n38\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.220\nAnd the reason why we're seeing that\npush is because it's open source, and\n\n39\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.130\nthat means it's much cheaper for\nyour company to be able to run.\n\n40\n00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.670\nIt takes a little bit more on the side\nof training to get up the speed on it,\n\n41\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.410\nbut once you're up the speed on it\nyou'll see that the performance\n\n42\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.520\nreally does actually demand\nsome great attention and\n\n43\n00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.970\nbeing able to actually install and\nget a VM up and running\n\n44\n00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.380\nis actually gonna be fairly quick once you\nactually learn the commands a little bit.\n\n45\n00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.478\nIt's not super difficult.\n\n46\n00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:34.000\n>> Ronnie and me, some of the last\nhypervisors in the previous episodes,\n\n47\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.140\nwe've dealt with type one hypervisors,\nwe've dealt with the type two hypervisors.\n\n48\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.730\nAnd one thing that it's\nalmost unanimous across all\n\n49\n00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.370\nof them is the fact that you have\nto install some kinda tool, right?\n\n50\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.990\nYou have the virtual box editions,\n\n51\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.885\nyou got integration services\nif your inside a hyper V.\n\n52\n00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:51.970\nYou've got VMware tools.\n\n53\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.290\nRonny, do we have tools in this\none that we're gonna have to use?\n\n54\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.320\n>> You're probably gonna end up seeing two\nthings here when you start talking about\n\n55\n00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.210\nthose editions.\n\n56\n00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.160\nOnce we actually create a VM inside them,\n\n57\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.800\nwe'll do that here in a moment,\nwe don't necessarily\n\n58\n00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.480\nneed those additional tools if we're gonna\nbe using a Linux based operating system.\n\n59\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.810\nAnd that is because,\n\n60\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.680\ninside of the kernel itself is built\nin those extra tools to allow you to\n\n61\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.430\nintegrate it perfectly into that\nhypervisor without you having to do much.\n\n62\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.170\nBut, if you choose to run something\nlike a Windows based operating system,\n\n63\n00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.680\nessentially anything\nthat is non-Linux based,\n\n64\n00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.240\nyou may actually need to go ahead and\ninstall in additional tools.\n\n65\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.730\nAnd the unusual thing about it is,\nof course, they don't call them tools,\n\n66\n00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.260\nthere's actually something that they\ncall the VIRTIO, V, I, R, T, I, O.\n\n67\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.660\nSo, I always pronounce it\nlike the Italian, the Virtio.\n\n68\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.660\nAnd it does take some command line\nknowledge to be able to do that.\n\n69\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.802\nBut what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna just install a simple VM using,\n\n70\n00:03:47.802 --> 00:03:51.080\nof course, our command line as well.\n\n71\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.260\nNow, I do wanna show you there\nis GUI that you can use and\n\n72\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.530\nis probably the way you're\ngonna use it more often.\n\n73\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.220\nBut this is not supposed to\nbe a dependence tool for you.\n\n74\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.130\nSo, even though that's probably\nthe way that we'll do it,\n\n75\n00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.770\nwe're gonna actually focus in on\ncreating a VM using the command line.\n\n76\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.810\nSo, let me show you the beginning process\nof both of those as we move through\n\n77\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.720\nthis technology here, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.250\nSo, here I'm on my CentOS machine and\nI'm running CentOS 6.5.\n\n79\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.810\nAnd what we're gonna be\ninstalling is CentOS 7.\n\n80\n00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.710\nSo, I've got an ISO that I've now got\ndownloaded into my downloads folder.\n\n81\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.650\nSo, one, of course,\n\n82\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.930\nthat means I definitely need\nat least a source of my files.\n\n83\n00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.320\nAnd there it is.\nThere's that CentOS folder, or\n\n84\n00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.300\nfile I should say.\n\n85\n00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.140\nThat ISO file.\n\n86\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.530\nAnd now, I wanna get that installed and\nready to go as a VM.\n\n87\n00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.300\nWell, let's go ahead and take a look\nat building our first virtual machine.\n\n88\n00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.038\nRemember that we can actually build this\nvirtual machine from using a little GUI\n\n89\n00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:53.130\nthat's actually implanted in here now that\nwe've actually installed that package.\n\n90\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.280\nIf I click on applications and\n\n91\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.680\nsystem tools,\nI can go down to virtual machine manager.\n\n92\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.660\nSo, when I select virtual machine manager,\n\n93\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.970\nit's gonna ask me to type\nin the root password.\n\n94\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.110\nAnd then, there's the two virtual\nmachines I've previously created.\n\n95\n00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.680\nNow, when you actually do something\nlike this it's perfectly fine for\n\n96\n00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.580\nyou to simply go ahead and\nclick on create a new virtual machine.\n\n97\n00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.420\nAnd then, from here we can do a test.\n\n98\n00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.240\nLet's just do 04.\n\n99\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.000\nAnd then, I can click forward.\n\n100\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.820\nNow, it's asked me where am\nI actually going to use, or\n\n101\n00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.580\nwhat am I going to use as\na source file for an install.\n\n102\n00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.290\nI do have an ISO that I've downloaded\nwhich is gonna be my set OS for\n\n103\n00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.610\nseven here.\n\n104\n00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.760\nSo, I'm going to select\nthat particular folder.\n\n105\n00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.430\nAnd then, I click forward from here, and\nit automatically sets that up for me.\n\n106\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.360\nNow, I could go backward here and\nalso select the type and\n\n107\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.160\neverything and do that as well.\n\n108\n00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.430\nAnd what that's gonna do is add in kinda\nthe generic steps here that we need\n\n109\n00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.080\nto move the process forward.\n\n110\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.760\nAnd it's gonna create a 8\ngigabyte file storage here.\n\n111\n00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.000\nNow, remember that this is gonna create\na static file about 8 gigs in size even\n\n112\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.050\nthough we don't have anything in it.\n\n113\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.110\nAnd when you actually look into it you'll\nsee it won't actually use very much.\n\n114\n00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.760\nBut it is an 8 gig file that\nyou will have on that drive.\n\n115\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.010\nSo, you do have to be careful because,\nwell,\n\n116\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.170\nyou can run out of space very quickly\nif you have a rather small drive here.\n\n117\n00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.340\nBut you can uncheck it and\nsay try it dynamically.\n\n118\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.900\nIt has this little light bulb beside it,\n\n119\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.873\nand the light bulb is\nessentially a warning us.\n\n120\n00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:34.230\nIt's saying, look, you can do this if\nyou want to, but performance is gonna\n\n121\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.510\nprobably be slower, at least\nthe installation's gonna be slower, and\n\n122\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.820\nit may cause some problems later on.\n\n123\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.970\nSo, we're gonna leave it\nat its default static size.\n\n124\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.180\nFrom that point we're gonna click forward,\n\n125\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.550\nand then you have some options that\nyou can click here on the advanced.\n\n126\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.030\nWhether you tell it to become a type\none or a type two hypervisor.\n\n127\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.320\nSo, this is something that's very neat for\nyou and\n\n128\n00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.990\nme that we don't tend to see in\nthe other systems that we have.\n\n129\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.660\nBut because of the way that KVM and\nthat QEMU, the quick emulator,\n\n130\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.790\ndo work hand in hand, we can actually\nallow it to choose which one.\n\n131\n00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.830\nOr we can assign it, I should say,\nto choose which one we want to do.\n\n132\n00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.420\nAnd you notice that in default was KVM.\n\n133\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.360\nSo, if I click finish here, it will go\nahead and create a virtual machine for\n\n134\n00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.250\nus, and we'll be off and ready to go.\n\n135\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.850\nBut that's easy enough.\n\n136\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.310\nThat's something that you might have been\nable to figure out without needing to\n\n137\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.660\nwatch the show.\n\n138\n00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.010\nSo, what we're gonna show you,\nif my typing skills will hold out here,\n\n139\n00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.640\nWes, is to actually be able to do\nthis from the command line itself.\n\n140\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.350\nSo, that's what we want to\ntake a look at instead.\n\n141\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.630\nI'm gonna kinda leave this up in the\nbackground, cuz we'll actually use that as\n\n142\n00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.870\na guide, as it's actually creating it,\nand we'll see it actually populate here.\n\n143\n00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.119\nSo, if I click back on applications and\nsystem tools,\n\n144\n00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:52.948\nI'm gonna bring up the terminal,\nis what I'm gonna try and do.\n\n145\n00:07:52.948 --> 00:07:58.413\nAnd with the terminal window open,\nI need to log in as the actual root here.\n\n146\n00:07:58.413 --> 00:08:02.435\nSo, I'm gonna do a supervisor and change\nthat up, cuz all the commands that we're\n\n147\n00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:06.399\nactually going to run are going to require\nthose elevated privileges anyways, so\n\n148\n00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:07.730\nI'm gonna log in this way.\n\n149\n00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.970\nNow you may say, Ronnie,\nwhy don't you just use sudo?\n\n150\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.800\nI could do that, but my particular\nuser's not part of the sudo or\n\n151\n00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:19.680\nsudoers group here, so I'm just gonna log\nin as root as we do these commands, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.552\nSo the utility that we're gonna use\nto create a virtual machine is one\n\n153\n00:08:24.552 --> 00:08:28.430\ncalled virt-install,\nV-I-R-T -install here.\n\n154\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.798\nAnd once I have that,\n\n155\n00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:34.588\nthat's going to actually allow us to\nbegin the virtualization process and\n\n156\n00:08:34.588 --> 00:08:39.270\nnow I need to add in all the specification\nto create that VM, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.310\nAnd inside of KVM,\n\n158\n00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:46.480\nit doesn't do the process the way that\nwe've seen the hypervisors do it before.\n\n159\n00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.670\nWell we create that configuration file and\nthen we install the operating system.\n\n160\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.230\nHere, it absolutely does all at one time.\n\n161\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.180\nSo there is not really a lot of\nchange you can do without that here.\n\n162\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.490\nSo let me see.\n\n163\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.601\nFor dash install, the first thing is\ngonna be network space bridge colon,\n\n164\n00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:11.210\nand we're gonna tell it to use the bridge\nthat we've created in earlier episode.\n\n165\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:17.584\nAnd then another double dash here and\nwe're gonna give it the name testvm03.\n\n166\n00:09:17.584 --> 00:09:21.049\nAnd then I'm gonna sign\nan amount of RAM and\n\n167\n00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:27.609\nI'm gonna do 2,048 because it actually\nadds it up at 1,024 each time.\n\n168\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:34.392\nAnd then virtual processing\nunits here is gonna\n\n169\n00:09:34.392 --> 00:09:38.300\nbe vcpus, and we're gonna actually\nmake this a double core here.\n\n170\n00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.290\nAnd then where in the world is\nthis file going to be saved here?\n\n171\n00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:48.910\nNow remember that inside of KVM, there's\na default storage location inside of var,\n\n172\n00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.150\ninside of libvirt, and\nthen another one that's there.\n\n173\n00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.880\nBut we had created a folder in\na previous episode that we called\n\n174\n00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.070\nvms attached at the root here, and that's\nwhere I also want to attach this instead.\n\n175\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.820\nSo this is disk path, and\nthat's gonna =/vms, and\n\n176\n00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.685\nthen I need to give this a name for\nthe actual hard drive that we're creating.\n\n177\n00:10:09.685 --> 00:10:14.780\ntestvm03.img, because\n\n178\n00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.780\nwe actually create image files here, and\nthat'll call them hard drives essentially.\n\n179\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.140\nAnd we're gonna tell it,\nit's gonna be a 15 GB hard drive.\n\n180\n00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:22.990\nSo size= and\n\n181\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.100\nthen the number is gonna be reported\nin gigabytes is what we're gonna see.\n\n182\n00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.770\nAnd here it was challenge that I've also\nhave here is that I am using an ISO.\n\n183\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.790\nBut we are gonna attach\nit to the CD-ROM here.\n\n184\n00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.050\nBut it's actually gonna be attached to\nan ISO, which is found inside of my home.\n\n185\n00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.740\nSign on user profile.\n\n186\n00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.190\nAnd then downloads.\n\n187\n00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.228\nAnd now the challenge is actually\ntyping in the name correctly,\n\n188\n00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:56.032\nat least that's what I\nhope the challenge is.\n\n189\n00:10:56.032 --> 00:11:02.430\n[LAUGH] -7 for our CentOS-7.\n\n190\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:08.812\nAnd then there's gonna be the -x86_64\n\n191\n00:11:08.812 --> 00:11:15.000\nbit version, DVD-1511.\n\n192\n00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.060\nNow sometimes, you may actually go,\nhey, is that actually gonna be right?\n\n193\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.146\nWell you do have to check sometimes,\nso like I do,\n\n194\n00:11:22.146 --> 00:11:25.020\nverify that I did type\nthat name in correctly.\n\n195\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.110\nSo I always come back here, and\ntry and see if I can find it.\n\n196\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.030\nOops, wrong folder.\n\n197\n00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.971\nLet me look at the Home\nfolder on my Desktop here.\n\n198\n00:11:38.757 --> 00:11:42.220\nAnd you have to add that into the .iso.\n\n199\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.790\nLet me see here.\n\n200\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.550\nDownloads and so there it is.\n\n201\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.260\nSo that's what I need to do it in\nthere to see the extension here.\n\n202\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.680\nSo that looks right, and\nthen at the end here,\n\n203\n00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.030\nI need to pop in this .iso, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.246\nSo if everything is right,\n\n205\n00:11:58.246 --> 00:12:02.670\nso I always have to say a big if because\nmy typing skills are legendarily bad here.\n\n206\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.560\nIf I haven't misspelled anything,\nthose should be the proper\n\n207\n00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.430\noptions that I'm trying to look and\nsee if I've actually done anything.\n\n208\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.790\nFrom that point, I'm gonna press Enter.\n\n209\n00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.500\nAnd now it's telling me the RAM is not,\n\n210\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.680\noh, that's because I don't need a colon\nafter the RAM, I need an equal sign.\n\n211\n00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.807\n>> Yeah, and they definitely don't\nput the word processors in there.\n\n212\n00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:23.362\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I tell you, if anything, the next\n\n213\n00:12:23.362 --> 00:12:27.068\nversions of these, or editions of these\noperating systems would help us a lot in\n\n214\n00:12:27.068 --> 00:12:30.746\nthe command line if they just throw a word\nprocessor in there and underline it.\n\n215\n00:12:30.746 --> 00:12:34.280\nAnd it'll make, [LAUGH] so that we can\nmake sure that our syntax is right.\n\n216\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.650\n>> Yeah, and\nsometimes you will see this, but\n\n217\n00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.460\nthe nice thing is it's telling\nyou what the problem is.\n\n218\n00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.128\nThe problem is, of course,\nif you have multiple typos and\n\n219\n00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:42.603\nthat's very possible with me.\n\n220\n00:12:42.603 --> 00:12:46.318\nAnd there we go, so now though it's\njust one typo, which isn't bad for me.\n\n221\n00:12:46.318 --> 00:12:47.030\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n222\n00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.840\n>> Usually it's about 10 or 15.\n\n223\n00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.160\nThat's when you start\nexperiencing problems.\n\n224\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.200\nAnd there we go, you actually see that the\ninstall process started right away from\n\n225\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.430\nthe command line.\n\n226\n00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:00.145\nAnd all I've to do is select the right\nversion and we're off and ready to go.\n\n227\n00:13:00.145 --> 00:13:03.440\n>> Now,\nyou mentioned how everything is created at\n\n228\n00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.400\none time in the other hypervisors, we\ncreate a virtualized hardware first, and\n\n229\n00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.860\nthen we go back and\nwe attach an ISO to it.\n\n230\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.690\nAn ISO file will install the operating\nsystem running, it seems like something\n\n231\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.460\nlike this where everything is done at\none time, it's all in the command-line.\n\n232\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.500\nYou could probably script this up,\ncan you?\n\n233\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.130\n>> You definitely can script it out.\n\n234\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.302\nAnd that's why I do recommend that\ninstead that you do type it out\n\n235\n00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:26.884\nin some like a text editor, and\nthen you can probably copy and paste, and\n\n236\n00:13:26.884 --> 00:13:28.742\nget it right in there and ready to go.\n\n237\n00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:31.300\nNow, you might be wondering like,\nwell why does it do it differently?\n\n238\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.380\nWell, because the whole goal behind KVM\nis not to make you learn the process,\n\n239\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.250\nit's to get what?\n\n240\n00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.030\nA VM up and\nrunning as quickly as possible.\n\n241\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.470\nAnd you see that it's already part\nway through the process here.\n\n242\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.710\nAnd let me kinda reduce that down.\n\n243\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:52.154\nAnd so here it is, I am now inside of that\nVM machine and there it is, testvm03.\n\n244\n00:13:52.154 --> 00:13:56.320\nAnd now it's asking me about, hey,\nwhat are the installation options?\n\n245\n00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.820\nSo this is where you and I would go\nthrough even if we were doing this for\n\n246\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.340\nregular hardware.\n\n247\n00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.070\nWe would go through and we would pick\nall of the different information and\n\n248\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.190\nnow it's asking me for\nthe installation destination.\n\n249\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:13.070\nThere is the 15 GB hard drive that I've\njust created from the command line and\n\n250\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:13.820\nI'm gonna click Done.\n\n251\n00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.170\nAnd once it actually verifies that\nwe have the installation, oh,\n\n252\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.860\nit says that we didn't select a disk,\nI thought I did.\n\n253\n00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.560\nSee, it has a check, and\nI'm gonna click Done.\n\n254\n00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.740\nAnd let's see, so\nI just need to verify that I do have that.\n\n255\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.660\nThere it is,\nautomatic partitioning selected.\n\n256\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.640\nOn the install selection, we're just\ngonna do this minimal install whereas\n\n257\n00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.320\nincludes all of this different\nstuff that you want.\n\n258\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.130\nMost of us, if we're gonna\nbe doing this for a desktop,\n\n259\n00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.910\nwe'll probably choose like this\nGNOME Desktop or this Plasma Workspace.\n\n260\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.580\nOr just gonna be the minimum\ninstall to help us along in time.\n\n261\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.510\nSo, now we're gonna do that and that just\nmeans this gonna give us a command line\n\n262\n00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.200\nand then,\nthat's the version we're gonna select.\n\n263\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.340\nThe other thing that you may have of\ncourse choose is the security profile, and\n\n264\n00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.170\nfrom that point on,\njust begin that installation process.\n\n265\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.610\nAnd now, I can go ahead and\nset my password while it's installing.\n\n266\n00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:11.360\nAnd if I actually typed them in correctly.\n\n267\n00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.605\nThat's just telling me I've got\na weak password, that's fine.\n\n268\n00:15:15.605 --> 00:15:18.184\nAnd now I can create my username.\n\n269\n00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.648\nAnd I'm gonna make this one\nas the administrator inside.\n\n270\n00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:30.430\nAnd I just use a standard lab password for\nright now.\n\n271\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.450\n>> Apparently dot, dot, dot, dot,\ndot is a very weak password.\n\n272\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.530\n>> Yeah, it doesn't like it.\n\n273\n00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.470\nAnd there you go, you start seeing the\nprocess is now beginning the installation\n\n274\n00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.310\nin the background and\nit will continue to work and\n\n275\n00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.310\ndo everything that we want it to do.\n\n276\n00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:48.022\nSo now that I've finished the process\nof installing an operating system,\n\n277\n00:15:48.022 --> 00:15:51.774\nand we are up, and\nessentially ready to go once it's done.\n\n278\n00:15:51.774 --> 00:15:54.198\nNow, I went ahead and\npre-staged one, right?\n\n279\n00:15:54.198 --> 00:15:57.785\nIn other words, even though that's\nrunning right now in the background doing\n\n280\n00:15:57.785 --> 00:16:00.501\nthe installation, But\nwe still actually have to do several\n\n281\n00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:04.040\nother things when we talk about\nnow that we've created a VM right?\n\n282\n00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.530\nWe also need to pay attention to,\nwell, several other things.\n\n283\n00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.530\nAnd one of those things, of course,\nis starting up that virtual machine.\n\n284\n00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:15.700\nSo I know that from this graphical\nuser interface, I can select that and\n\n285\n00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.740\nthen click on this Power\non the virtual machine and\n\n286\n00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.690\neverything will actually run and\nI'll be fine and we're ready to go.\n\n287\n00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.340\nOkay?\n\n288\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.490\nBut how do I do it if I was\nonly given the command line?\n\n289\n00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.230\nSo if I go back to my terminal here.\n\n290\n00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.710\nLet's see it's actually just installing.\n\n291\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.320\nIt's still creating it\nin the background there.\n\n292\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.780\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n293\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.310\nI'm gonna launch up another terminal.\n\n294\n00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:44.010\nAnd so from here if I wanted to\nlaunch up another virtual machine.\n\n295\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.560\nAnd I do have one called Test 02.\n\n296\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.780\nWell what we can actually do is\nnow I can do a VIR for virtual.\n\n297\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.990\nSH shell.\n\n298\n00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.650\nRight?\n\n299\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.530\nSo here's your virtual shell command.\n\n300\n00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.570\nAnd I'm gonna do a list.\n\n301\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:04.145\nAnd in a moment here,\nwe should see some of the VMs that.\n\n302\n00:17:04.145 --> 00:17:07.626\nOh, it doesn't like it because\nI've got some of them started,\n\n303\n00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.600\nsome of them not started here.\n\n304\n00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.340\nSo normally what that would show you for\nright now,\n\n305\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.670\nyou know why it's not showing me,\nbecause I'm not logged in as root.\n\n306\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.250\nI'm a silly person.\n\n307\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.320\nThat's why it's not doing it.\n\n308\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.895\nSo let me do su.\n\n309\n00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:28.373\nAnd now if I do the, oops,\nget out of this thing.\n\n310\n00:17:31.613 --> 00:17:35.720\nNow virsh list, there we go.\n\n311\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.350\nSo you actually seen the one\nthat's running right now and\n\n312\n00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.460\nthat's because actually in the install.\n\n313\n00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.420\nIf they're off, it doesn't recognizes\nbeing a virtual machine right now, so\n\n314\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.500\nyou will actually have to turn them on and\noff and stuff like that, but\n\n315\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.130\nyou can at least see the list\nof virtual machines.\n\n316\n00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.720\nIf I want to start one,\nit's the same idea from the shell.\n\n317\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:02.430\nI can now do a virsh, and\nthen I can type in start.\n\n318\n00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.760\nAnd we'll do our testvm02.\n\n319\n00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:11.340\nAnd notice it says it started,\n\n320\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.560\nand if I take a look at\nthe little application here.\n\n321\n00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.905\nOops, I did the wrong one.\n\n322\n00:18:22.656 --> 00:18:26.370\nAnd let's see, give it a moment,\nthere it is, it's hidden behind me.\n\n323\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.160\nSo now you'll see that I have both\nof these virtual machines running\n\n324\n00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.090\njust from the command line if I want to.\n\n325\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.690\nSo there's a couple of other commands that\nyou wanna make sure that you pay attention\n\n326\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.890\nto, but being on the start,\nthat's is actually one of them of course,\n\n327\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.585\nthe opposite of that is that you need\nto shut it down, it's just gonna be,\n\n328\n00:18:43.585 --> 00:18:44.270\nwell, shut down.\n\n329\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.700\nWe're not gonna do that right now cuz I\nwant that virtual machine to kick up for\n\n330\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.670\nus right now.\n\n331\n00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.738\nBut, you do have that ability to build or\nshut down one just as easily.\n\n332\n00:18:53.738 --> 00:18:57.180\nSo, V-I-R-S-H start,\n\n333\n00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.170\nthe name of your virtual machine,\nor you can shut it down.\n\n334\n00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.110\nNow also inside of KVM then,\n\n335\n00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.760\nyou have the ability to do what we\ncall an auto start as well okay?\n\n336\n00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.490\nSo if I wanted to talk about\ndoing the idea of an auto start,\n\n337\n00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.570\nwell that means that when the machine\naccidentally powers down, and\n\n338\n00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:23.540\nthat can happen I can mark it so\nthat next time it actually reboots,\n\n339\n00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.950\nthe entire physical machine reboots I can\nalso run this as well and we'll see that\n\n340\n00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.710\ncommand a little bit later on as well but\nwe're not gonna do that right now.\n\n341\n00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.840\nSo I just wanted to point out just a few\ncommands to get us up and running so\n\n342\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.670\nwhen that test03 finishes you'll see\nthat it'll actually continue to run.\n\n343\n00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.780\nSo not only do you create the virtual\nmachine and you get it installed,\n\n344\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.190\nit automatically leaves it up and\nrunning at the very beginning.\n\n345\n00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.150\nSometimes you will need to actually\nshut it down to do some other management\n\n346\n00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.110\nfeatures here but\n\n347\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.400\njust kinda realize it that is at least the\nbeginnings of some of the stuff that you\n\n348\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:01.230\nwant to pay attention to when you start\nto talk about creating a virtual machine.\n\n349\n00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.950\nSo remember that you do have\nthose two options though right.\n\n350\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.195\nYou have that little GUI utility\nthat you can use to install and\n\n351\n00:20:09.195 --> 00:20:11.210\nto do everything that you need to.\n\n352\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.830\nYou can also, of course,\ndo it from the command line.\n\n353\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.190\nThe command line a little bit more\ntechnically challenging, but it's probably\n\n354\n00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.720\nthe option that you'll see more often\nbecause this one right here as nice and\n\n355\n00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.910\na little tiny utility as it is, it really\ndoesn't offer you any real big control.\n\n356\n00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.830\nSo if you wanna install your VMs where you\nwant them to go and not where this utility\n\n357\n00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.650\nwants them to go, you're gonna have to\nuse the command line to help you out.\n\n358\n00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.055\nAnd of course, you can actually start it\nand stop it just like everything else in\n\n359\n00:20:40.055 --> 00:20:43.900\nyour sent OS here or\nwhatever edition of Linux you're running.\n\n360\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.110\nMake sure that you actually know those\ncommands to start and stop a VM, too.\n\n361\n00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.670\nSo just getting started there\nas we actually take a look.\n\n362\n00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:54.040\nIt does take a little bit of time and\nyou'll see if you're not good at typing,\n\n363\n00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.740\nit takes a lot more time than necessary,\n\n364\n00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.390\na lot of times if you're not used\nto working with a command line.\n\n365\n00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.450\nBut that will at least get us started.\n\n366\n00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.590\nNow we still have a lot to look at when we\nstart to take a look at virtual machines.\n\n367\n00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.040\nBut Wes,\n\n368\n00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.550\nI think we're actually coming close to the\ntime where I'm running out of time here.\n\n369\n00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.150\nSo we still need to look at cloning and\neven managing virtual machines and\n\n370\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.470\neven doing things like snapshots as well.\n\n371\n00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.570\nSo there is still a lot for\nus to take a look at.\n\n372\n00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.720\n>> Well, great information.\n\n373\n00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.960\nI was gonna say I can see where that\nauto start would be great because we've\n\n374\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.980\nbeen talking about the type one Hypervisor\n\n375\n00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.730\nbeing in your production environment,\nright?\n\n376\n00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.560\nYou might have a production\nmachine that you need online, and\n\n377\n00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.780\nthen you get a power outage, right?\n\n378\n00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.500\nPower outage happens,\nwell that server reboots.\n\n379\n00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.780\nThat machine reboots.\n\n380\n00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.630\nYou might want that production machine\nto start up automatically so you don't\n\n381\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.710\nhave to do the old sneaker net, walking\nover to device or a remote command.\n\n382\n00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.580\nSo I could see where\nthat would come in handy,\n\n383\n00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.730\nwell, Ronnie, all great information.\n\n384\n00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.720\nDo you have anything else for\nus in this one?\n\n385\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.710\n>> Well not anything more for\nthis one, right.\n\n386\n00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.540\nIt is a great place for us to stop\nbecause it will allow us to actually\n\n387\n00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.500\nget the rest of that machine booted up.\n\n388\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.680\nAnd then we'll be able to do some cloning.\n\n389\n00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.190\nWe'll be able to actually take a look\nagain like I said at using snapshots.\n\n390\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.940\nAnd how to manage the virtual machine\nusing the command line a little\n\n391\n00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.910\nbit as well.\n\n392\n00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:10.510\nSo there is still a lot more but not\nenough time in this particular segment but\n\n393\n00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.595\nthere is still a lot more typing\nto go a lot more typo to go.\n\n394\n00:22:14.595 --> 00:22:15.766\n>> [LAUGH] All right, very good.\n\n395\n00:22:15.766 --> 00:22:18.230\nWell, it looks like we've come\nto the end of another episode.\n\n396\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:22.290\nSo we are going to sign off here at\nIT Pro TV, i've been your host, Wess Bryan\n\n397\n00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.120\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong\n\n398\n00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.673\n>> And we'll see you next time\n\n399\n00:22:24.673 --> 00:22:30.430\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Bryan\n\n3\n00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.780\nand in this episode we're gonna\nbe moving through virtualization.\n\n4\n00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.900\nNow on a previous episode we\nstarted out with creating and\n\n5\n00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.630\nmanaging virtual machines\ninside of KVM software.\n\n6\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.050\nWell that's right,\nin this one we're back with a part two.\n\n7\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.780\nThat's right, the sequel, and we have\nRonnie Wong on hand to help us out.\n\n8\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.900\nRonnie, how you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.740\n>> I'm doing fine.\n\n10\n00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.770\nAs we continue to take a look at some of\nthe other things we need to be able to do\n\n11\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.820\nwith our KVM technology.\n\n12\n00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.680\nAnd what we're actually really\ntaking in this particular segment is\n\n13\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.890\ncan we talk about cloning an actual VM.\n\n14\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.400\nNow we solve this process in previous\neditions of, or in previous episodes,\n\n15\n00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.840\nI should say,\nof our virtualization technologies here\n\n16\n00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.650\nwhere we are able to do fairly quickly and\nactually fairly easily.\n\n17\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.895\nInside of KVM,\nit's really not that different and\n\n18\n00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:05.200\ndoes require a little bit more\ncommand line knowledge, but\n\n19\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.890\nonce you actually do get that\nknowledge in, it's easy to do so.\n\n20\n00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.900\nNow, let's go ahead and\n\n21\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.240\ntake a look at the idea of why in\nthe world we would want to clone a VM.\n\n22\n00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740\nNow Wes, you and I both built virtual\nmachines for when the processes and\n\n23\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.900\nthat takes the longest is when we\nhad to build multiple VMs, right?\n\n24\n00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.410\n>> That's right.\n\n25\n00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.590\nI've had to do this before where you know,\nyou've got a series of virtual machines\n\n26\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.360\nand we'll say server technology is\nwhere you have to set up you know,\n\n27\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.130\nlike a complex network infrastructure,\n\n28\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.730\nbefore you could even start\nworking with a certain technology.\n\n29\n00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.300\nAnd one of the things, Ronnie,\nI know that over and over and over,\n\n30\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.960\na lot of times these servers, they'll\nstart out with a base configuration,\n\n31\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.000\nand if I'm gonna configure let's say six\nVMs, well, I'm gonna need to install\n\n32\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.350\nthe operating systems six times,\ndo the configuration six times.\n\n33\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.440\nRonnie, do we got a way that you can\nmake that a little bit easier for me?\n\n34\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.700\n>> We really can and\nthat's the whole goal behind cloning.\n\n35\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.800\nA lot of times,\nexactly what Wes said is that\n\n36\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.720\nyou actually are starting off\nwith a base configuration.\n\n37\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.650\nAnd you might need multiple copies of\nthat because that's what you're gonna\n\n38\n00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.630\ndistribute throughout your organization.\n\n39\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.020\nThe other thing about the idea\nof cloning here, of course,\n\n40\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.830\nis once you get that perfect\nconfiguration that you want,\n\n41\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.250\nright, it's always difficult to\nactually recreate it manually.\n\n42\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.770\nEven if you take all good notes,\n\n43\n00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.550\nbeing able to clone it where you actually\nget an identical copy of that machine and\n\n44\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.840\nactually it works identically in\nthe same way, it really does help.\n\n45\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.707\nNow there is a caveat to\nthe idea of cloning here and\n\n46\n00:02:25.707 --> 00:02:29.160\nthat's because if you do\nclone an actual machine,\n\n47\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.076\nyou end up getting things\nlike duplicate IP addresses.\n\n48\n00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:35.677\nYou end up getting, especially in\nsomething like Windows a duplicate,\n\n49\n00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:39.840\nwhat we call SID, the security\nidentifier and then those things start\n\n50\n00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.940\nconflicting with each other when\nthey're on the same network.\n\n51\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.420\nWell, in the cloning process,\nregardless of what particular\n\n52\n00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.140\nhypervisor we've looked at, it does know\nhow to actually say, this is a clone.\n\n53\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.480\nBut we're gonna differentiate things so\n\n54\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.160\nthat you don't end up with that\nduplication and that's also what happens\n\n55\n00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.850\nhere in KVM, is that even though KVM\nactually does a duplicate of it,\n\n56\n00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.340\nit does change out where you aren't\ngonna get duplicate MAC addresses.\n\n57\n00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.430\nAnd then notice that it actually makes\nsure that things like that aren't gonna\n\n58\n00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.230\nhappen so even though you turned them\non at the same time, it will actually\n\n59\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.960\nrecognize them as two separate machines,\ninstead of a duplicate of the same one and\n\n60\n00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.830\nnot exactly know where to\nsend the information to.\n\n61\n00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.710\n>> So, in virtual box right, in the\nvirtual box Type 2 hypervisor, I've used\n\n62\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.780\nit a lot just on a basic workstation so\nthat I can get a piece of software up and\n\n63\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.030\nrunning, Ronnie, and I know when a Windows\nenvironment, the first thing I have to do,\n\n64\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.130\nafter I get that virtual machine cloned,\nI turn around and\n\n65\n00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.760\nI have to run the Windows based\nsystem preparation utility, right?\n\n66\n00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.960\nTo make sure that I don't\nhave those duplicate SID's.\n\n67\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.000\nBecause when you turn around and join\nmultiple servers that have been cloned to\n\n68\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.610\nthe active directory domain, it says\nwell wait a second, we can't do that.\n\n69\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.810\nI see all of these machines as one.\n\n70\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.100\nSo Ronnie, if I understand it right,\nit's gonna know that this is be a cloned\n\n71\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.360\nmachine and it's gonna remove that\ncomputer specific information and\n\n72\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.520\nmake sure that you don't\nhave those duplicates.\n\n73\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.260\n>> Yep,\nyou're actually gonna end up seeing that,\n\n74\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.900\nespecially on the networking side, and\nthat's pretty much the critical component\n\n75\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.790\nwhen we actually start to try and\ncommunicate there.\n\n76\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.700\nSo it knows how to actually\ndistinguish that and help you out.\n\n77\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.160\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at what\nwe need to make sure what we need to\n\n78\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.280\nunderstand when we start to clone here.\n\n79\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.820\nAnd I'm gonna type out\nthe commands this time,\n\n80\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.780\nhopefully making a little be easier for\nus as well.\n\n81\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.280\nFirst thing that we want to do if\nwe're gonna start cloning a machine\n\n82\n00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.150\nis if it's running, we need to do what\nwe call a suspend on that machine.\n\n83\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.968\nNow, when we talk about using\na suspend on the machine,\n\n84\n00:04:31.968 --> 00:04:35.970\nit's when we put that machine\nessentially to sleep, right?\n\n85\n00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.840\nEverything that's in RAM, it gets stored\nonto the file and then when you go and\n\n86\n00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.930\nstart it again or restart it,\nit actually resumes it, so we're actually\n\n87\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.090\npulling everything up and you don't\ngo through the boot process again.\n\n88\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.990\nYou can shut the machine down but,\nwhen you do so,\n\n89\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.320\nremember you have to go through\nthe boot process when it comes back up.\n\n90\n00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.820\nBut, one of the things we have to do is\ngo and stop all the writing processes and\n\n91\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.910\nall of the networking that is\ncoming to that virtual machine.\n\n92\n00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.310\nSo we want to make sure\nthat we suspend that.\n\n93\n00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.520\nAnd we're going to use a command\ncalled a VIRSH, or VIRSH.\n\n94\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.060\nAnd then suspend and then the name\nof the VM, that's if it's on.\n\n95\n00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.790\nNow can you clone a machine\nthat's totally off?\n\n96\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.230\nYou definitely can, right?\n\n97\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.430\nIt's not started,\nit's not actually getting any information.\n\n98\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.010\nIt's not changing anything.\n\n99\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.270\nSo the cloning process is really ideal if\nyou suspend it or if the machine is off.\n\n100\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.890\n>> Because we constantly have,\nfor instance, reads and rights.\n\n101\n00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.840\nThe first thing that I can\nthink of is the page file.\n\n102\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.720\nThe page file is constantly being written\nto and read from so we do have to take\n\n103\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.860\nthat machine and put it in temporary state\nso that you can make a copy of it right?\n\n104\n00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.280\n>> And\nthat's exactly what need to be done here\n\n105\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.420\n>> Now the other thing that I also put\n\n106\n00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.290\nhere on my list of making sure that\nwe get everything right here is,\n\n107\n00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.570\nI've got to run this as root.\n\n108\n00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.700\nNo matter what I do I always end\nup having a problem with this.\n\n109\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.120\nI'll type the whole command in,\n\n110\n00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.440\nit tells me I don't have\npermissions to do what I want.\n\n111\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.640\nOr that command may not be recognized\nin the way that I want it to.\n\n112\n00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.210\nSo I always make sure I go ahead and\nrun this as root.\n\n113\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.635\nAnd then we are going to use something\nthat we call the Vert Clone, or\n\n114\n00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:05.430\nvert-clone command.\n\n115\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.050\nAnd this what it will end up doing for us.\n\n116\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.580\nIt will go ahead and it will make\na clone and connect it into the system,\n\n117\n00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.900\nand then it's gonna tell me or it's gonna\nask me what machine do I want to clone.\n\n118\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.180\nAnd then what is my new name\nof the clone going to be and\n\n119\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.870\nthen where is this file\ngoing to be stored.\n\n120\n00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.770\nNow depending on the size of that virtual\nmachine, and that's really the key,\n\n121\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.980\nit may take just a few minutes,\ntwo to three, four minutes here.\n\n122\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.150\nOr it may take a longer amount of time.\n\n123\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.080\nSo it makes sense, right?\n\n124\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.890\nThe larger your virtual machine\nimage file is gonna be,\n\n125\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.310\nthe longer time it's gonna take to clone.\n\n126\n00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.720\nSo I'm just gonna copy this line out here.\n\n127\n00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.960\nAnd then at the end of that once we\nget everything up and running and\n\n128\n00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.950\nthe clone has been successfully created,\nwe'll able to see that it's actually been\n\n129\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.220\ncreated and then what we'll do is if\nthis machine was on production and\n\n130\n00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.500\nwas started originally,\nwe can resume that machine.\n\n131\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.350\nIf it wasn't then we can leave that one\noff and we're pretty much ready to go,\n\n132\n00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.280\nall right?\n\n133\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.290\nSo let me now, hopefully now that I've\ncopied that in, I'm now logged in as Root.\n\n134\n00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.580\nI went ahead and shut down this VM too.\n\n135\n00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.040\nBut remember that I can\nactually do here the suspend\n\n136\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.110\nand we'll do this one with testvm03.\n\n137\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.310\nSo that is the one that's\nrunning in the background.\n\n138\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.280\nAnd I'm going ahead and let it suspend and\nnow you can see where it's paused.\n\n139\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.850\nSo now that I have that\npause I can now clone this\n\n140\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.430\nby using that command\nthat we just typed in.\n\n141\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.550\nNow the thing that I want to do since\nthis is actually testVM03 is change\n\n142\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.190\nthe numbers here.\n\n143\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:48.730\nSo that should be testvm03,\nmake sure that's right.\n\n144\n00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.890\nI want to make sure I actually have\nthe spaces in there that I need to.\n\n145\n00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.963\nAnd I'm going to do a dash clone after so\n\n146\n00:07:57.963 --> 00:08:02.043\nI can see it there and also Change that.\n\n147\n00:08:02.043 --> 00:08:06.570\nSo if I'm running this route and I haven't\nactually had any typos, at least that's\n\n148\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.540\nwhat my hope is, the only thing I did\nwas actually have to modify a 203.\n\n149\n00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.460\nI can make a mistake in that,\nI guarantee I've done it before but\n\n150\n00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.930\nhopefully not this time.\n\n151\n00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.540\nAnd there we go, it actually said,\nit's because I misspelled original.\n\n152\n00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.220\nSo see?\n\n153\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.510\nEven if I copy and paste I can do that.\n\n154\n00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.640\nNow there it goes.\n\n155\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.030\nSo now it's starting that particular\nprocess here, where it's cloning.\n\n156\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.420\nAnd it says it's gonna take 18 minutes.\n\n157\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.830\nIf we actually,\nlet me see if I can scroll up here, or\n\n158\n00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.030\nmove that past my head so that we can\nsee that a little bit better, but\n\n159\n00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.830\nyou see the time's kinda going up and\ndown.\n\n160\n00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.840\nAnd it's not gonna take very long at all.\n\n161\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.690\nIt's down to three minutes or so.\n\n162\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.260\nBut it does take a little bit of\ntime to clone the entire machine and\n\n163\n00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.910\nnow it's jumping back up to eight.\n\n164\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.330\nSo may just take a few minutes\nbefore the clone process is done.\n\n165\n00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.340\nSo once the cloning is actually done I\nwill now end up with a new machine and\n\n166\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.520\nwe're not done with processes to and\nthere it goes so this one took,\n\n167\n00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.160\nwhat 31 seconds so that is not bad at all\nin terms of actually needing the clone.\n\n168\n00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.910\nAn actual machine here.\n\n169\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.460\nSo if we were running both of them, okay.\n\n170\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.410\nWell there it is.\n\n171\n00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.870\nNotice I have that test 03 there and\nthis pause.\n\n172\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.980\nThis is where I would do a VRSH.\n\n173\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:23.200\nAnd then I would go ahead and\nnow resume test Vm03.\n\n174\n00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.620\nAnd in a moment here, you'll actually see\nwhere it would begin to run the process.\n\n175\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.110\nAnd this should start up fairly fast,\n\n176\n00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.050\nit's only made the most\nminimal install of centOS.\n\n177\n00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:41.308\nAnd now, I would need to go ahead and\nalso start up my clone as well.\n\n178\n00:09:41.308 --> 00:09:49.310\nSo, that's testvm03-clone.\n\n179\n00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.660\nSo, everything's actually running,\n\n180\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.290\nthere it is,\nnow both of them have actually started.\n\n181\n00:09:57.405 --> 00:09:59.615\nI can do my list and you can see there's,\n\n182\n00:09:59.615 --> 00:10:03.380\nboth of those machines that\nare now currently running for us.\n\n183\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.680\nAllowing us to make sure that we now have\na clone and both of them are actually up\n\n184\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.760\nand running, and\nthey will be identified separately, too.\n\n185\n00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.470\n>> Ronnie, I one of the things that I\nknow that I've had to do before is test\n\n186\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.620\na certain piece of software.\n\n187\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.660\nAnd sometimes when you get\nthe software installed, and\n\n188\n00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.830\nnot any one specific piece of software,\nbut you get the software installed and\n\n189\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.920\nit takes four hours to do the updates for\nthe software.\n\n190\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.990\nSometimes the updates are bigger\nthan the software itself, and\n\n191\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.910\nif I'm testing the software you know one\nof the things that I don't wanna do is\n\n192\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.680\nwait four hours for the software to get\nupdated, make some configuration and\n\n193\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.100\nthen unfortunately I make\na configuration error,\n\n194\n00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.540\noh no now I have uninstall the software\nI have to start over again,\n\n195\n00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.290\nis there a way that I\ncan skip that process?\n\n196\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.790\n>> There really is, the way that we start\nto do thing like this is using what we\n\n197\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.450\ncalled snapshot, right?\n\n198\n00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:51.430\nSo cloning is one of the ways that\nreally do help us to be able to\n\n199\n00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.270\nmake the machine that we need and\nmake multiple copies of it very quickly.\n\n200\n00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.050\nDistribute them, get them into production\nthat way that we need to much quicker.\n\n201\n00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.790\nBut there's also times where we\nare actually testing software or\n\n202\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.210\nwe're testing configuration changes and\nwhat we need to do is say look I know I'm\n\n203\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.700\ngonna make this change but I don't\nknow if this is gonna blow up on me or\n\n204\n00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.220\nnot but the machine is running\nfine as it is right now and\n\n205\n00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.420\nI can't remember the last 15,20,40 changes\nI've made this machine so what can I do?\n\n206\n00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.160\nBut what I can do instead is actually\ncreate what we call snapshots.\n\n207\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.780\nSnapshots are not actually a back\nup of your virtual machine.\n\n208\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:31.610\nBut snapshots allow you to\nessentially take a picture of well,\n\n209\n00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.740\nhow your virtual machine was\nat any one point in time.\n\n210\n00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.770\nThe reason that we might wanna do that\nis before any major changes that you and\n\n211\n00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.640\nI would create, to take a snapshot of\nthat computer right then and there, and\n\n212\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.460\nthat will be a snapshot in time.\n\n213\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.550\nHere's how the hard drive\nlooked at this point in time.\n\n214\n00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.910\nThen if we make configuration changes and\nsomething blows up on us, what\n\n215\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:00.940\nwe can do is we can always go back and\nrevert that snapshot to a previous time.\n\n216\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.280\nAnd now all of the sudden\nwe've brought that back up.\n\n217\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.490\nAnd now it's just like we rolled back\nour machine to that date and time.\n\n218\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.360\nNow what it does like I\nsaid is it keeps a record,\n\n219\n00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.310\na track, of where those files\nwere located and where those\n\n220\n00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.890\nbits essentially were located at one point\nin time and it knows how to restore that.\n\n221\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.770\nSo it doesn't actually\nmake a copy of anything,\n\n222\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.860\nit's not actually backing\nanything up here.\n\n223\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.370\nIt's just saying, I know I can keep track\nof what it actually looked like on this\n\n224\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.090\nday and then when you tell me,\n\n225\n00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.400\nthis is what the machine should look like\nI can then go back and erase new bits and\n\n226\n00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.160\nmake it look like that copy that\nI had at one point in time.\n\n227\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.660\nSo snapshots are really something great\nand this is something we've seen in just\n\n228\n00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.870\nabout every technology we've looked at and\nwe're about to see it too in ours as well.\n\n229\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.500\nNow, when we start talking about creating\nsnapshots there's two different things\n\n230\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.260\nabout creating snapshots that we\nhave to be aware of here, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.620\nAnd this is something that\nis relatively unique to KVM\n\n232\n00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.060\nthat makes it complicated, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.270\nOne of the things that we have\na complication with is the format\n\n234\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.240\nof our files that we have\ninside of our virtual machines.\n\n235\n00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.270\nAnd that means that there's two different\nformats we have to pay attention to, okay.\n\n236\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.900\nIf my virtual machines\nare stored in a RAW format,\n\n237\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.070\nokay, I won't be able to create snapshots.\n\n238\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.700\nSo if you try and run snapshot\ncommands and they're not working,\n\n239\n00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.860\nyou need to check out the way that\nthe system is actually stored and\n\n240\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.780\nsee if it actually says RAW or not.\n\n241\n00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.480\nOkay, and\nwhat it does we won't be able to.\n\n242\n00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.430\nThe second option is one that's called,\nI know it sounds a little bit weird,\n\n243\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:37.380\nit's called QCow, so the letter Q C-O-W 2.\n\n244\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.100\nIt is the another format.\n\n245\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.850\nThis particular type of format allows\nus to be able to use dynamically\n\n246\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.710\nexpanding drives that we choose to but\neven in\n\n247\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.930\nthe way that we created that statistically\nexpanding drive, it's perfectly fine.\n\n248\n00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.060\nSo you can actually do that as well.\n\n249\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.130\nWhere you can actually name the format\nthat you wanted right from the beginning.\n\n250\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.270\nI didn't choose to do that,\n\n251\n00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.740\ncuz we're gonna do a conversion\nprocess is what we're gonna do.\n\n252\n00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.700\nBut I do want to show you that\nthere is a difference here right.\n\n253\n00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.380\nSo you need to make sure that\nthose are pretty much the keys and\n\n254\n00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.610\nthen we need to run of course\nthe commands for the snapshots.\n\n255\n00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.690\nSo one of the very first things that\nwe want to do is check out what ours,\n\n256\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.760\nare drives are like it.\n\n257\n00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.540\nSo if I wanted to, let's just take this\nof clone VM here that's running and\n\n258\n00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.190\nwe'll go ahead and shut this thing down.\n\n259\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:31.360\nSo we'll do a shutdown and\nthen our testvm03-clone.\n\n260\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.720\nAnd let's let that shutdown, in a moment\nI'll be able to see it shutdown.\n\n261\n00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.700\nFrom here,\nI wanna identify the file format.\n\n262\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.876\nAnd the way that I do that is by\n\n263\n00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:46.590\ntyping in qemu dash image info.\n\n264\n00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.880\nAnd then I wanna tell it the file\nthat I'm looking for the VM.\n\n265\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:56.702\nOops, oh,\nI need actual [NOISE] image file, sorry.\n\n266\n00:14:56.702 --> 00:15:01.270\nI'm in the wrong directory.\n\n267\n00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:13.573\nOh vms see my typing skill's\n\n268\n00:15:13.573 --> 00:15:19.008\njust qemu_img.info and\n\n269\n00:15:19.008 --> 00:15:25.940\ntestvm03 .img, there we go.\n\n270\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.030\nSo I was just in the wrong directory and\nthat happens to constantly.\n\n271\n00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.910\nNotice that what I'm looking at\nright here it says, raw, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.900\nSo with that raw I cannot\ncreate a snapshot.\n\n273\n00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.260\nSo if I cannot create a snapshot what\nI need to do is not go ahead and\n\n274\n00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.170\nmodify and\nessentially change this raw format into\n\n275\n00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.820\nthat QCow2 format is what we need\nto do and then we'll save it.\n\n276\n00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.480\nOkay?\n\n277\n00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.750\nSo, what do I do?\n\n278\n00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.032\nWell, the good thing is, now that I've\nshut it down, I can actually convert that\n\n279\n00:15:56.032 --> 00:15:59.281\nparticular file in order that\nfile OS system into what I need.\n\n280\n00:15:59.281 --> 00:16:02.402\nSo the way that we do that here is,\n\n281\n00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:07.643\nmake sure that I actually type\nin the correct command and\n\n282\n00:16:07.643 --> 00:16:12.345\nthat's going to be\nqemu-imgconver make sense?\n\n283\n00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:16.265\nIts actually saying what's\nthe file system and\n\n284\n00:16:16.265 --> 00:16:21.960\nthat's going to be raw and\nthat's gonna be for testvm03-clone.\n\n285\n00:16:24.815 --> 00:16:28.760\nAnd then, yeah let me do that.\n\n286\n00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.538\nSo I know I did that, yeah it said\nthe same since I made a clone of it.\n\n287\n00:16:33.538 --> 00:16:39.580\n-O and then qcow2.\n\n288\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:46.030\nSo I'm telling it to convert that\nparticular file system into this and\n\n289\n00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.795\nthen we're gonna name this\nsomething a little bit differently,\n\n290\n00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:54.560\n03-clone, and I'm simply gonna\ngive it another extension so\n\n291\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.200\nwe that we can see it\na little bit differently.\n\n292\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.280\nNow, it really doesn't matter\nwhat you name that extension,\n\n293\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.350\nyou can name it image if you want to or\nIMG.\n\n294\n00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.610\nBut that's the one that\nwe want to make sure of.\n\n295\n00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:05.430\nOops.\n\n296\n00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.910\nI know what I forgot here,\nwhich was the image file itself.\n\n297\n00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.560\nAnd then I'm going to press enter, and\n\n298\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:17.200\nit will begin that process of converting\nthat over into that new format.\n\n299\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.110\nSo that might just take a moment\nof time as it actually does\n\n300\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.590\nconvert it over to this.\n\n301\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.840\nBut this is the format that\nwill allow me to do snapshots.\n\n302\n00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.310\nWithout it, the raw will actually\nnot allow us to do it, and so\n\n303\n00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.710\nthat's what we have to keep track of,\n\n304\n00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.580\nand be realizing that it can\njust take a moment of time here.\n\n305\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.180\n>> Now Ronnie, you mentioned earlier when\nyou were cloning it in KVM where it is\n\n306\n00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.240\na fixed image, disk image, it could take\na long time if I've got a 200 gig drive,\n\n307\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.610\nit could take a very long time.\n\n308\n00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.790\nI can imagine that this would\nprobably be the same thing.\n\n309\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.910\nIf you're doing any kinda conversion.\n\n310\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.040\nWe talk about doing media conversion.\n\n311\n00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.020\nAnd it can take a long time.\n\n312\n00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.520\nIf the drive's a little bit bigger,\nyou got a bigger file,\n\n313\n00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.010\nthen this process will probably\ntake a little bit as well.\n\n314\n00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.660\n>> That's pretty much the same.\n\n315\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.220\nThat's true because it has to\nconvert all that imaging and\n\n316\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.390\nthen make sure that the files actually\nare in the same state that they were.\n\n317\n00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.190\nSo mine looks like it's actually done.\n\n318\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.060\nThe way that I verify that is\nrun that same command that I did\n\n319\n00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.870\na little bit earlier.\n\n320\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:15.729\nInfo, but this time,\nwith that test vm03-clone.\n\n321\n00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:20.020\nAnd now that qcow2.\n\n322\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:25.810\nAnd now we can see,\nI had converted that to that qcow instead.\n\n323\n00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.960\nSo I had run it on the wrong file here.\n\n324\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.850\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n325\n00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.620\nIf I just added in that\n-clone it would have been\n\n326\n00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.050\nthe same cause it was\na clone of the other one.\n\n327\n00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.090\nSo now you can see, now that we've\nactually got that new file format\n\n328\n00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.970\nwe are now ready to create snapshots,\nbut without it, you can't do it.\n\n329\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.450\nSo you do want to make\nsure you are careful\n\n330\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.360\nwhen you start taking\na look at that point.\n\n331\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:47.920\nOkay?\n\n332\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.090\nNow just when you think you're done,\nyou're not, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:56.860\nAnd the reason that you're not is\nbecause the original VM itself, right?\n\n334\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.800\nThis clone VM that I have right here,\non this test VM.\n\n335\n00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.670\nIt is by the configuration file,\nattached to what the original file, okay?\n\n336\n00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:11.140\nIt's not attached to that new one that\nI just created on that new format.\n\n337\n00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.240\nSo now this means I need to enter in and\n\n338\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.999\nedit a configuration\nfile to attach it here.\n\n339\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.690\nTo this one, instead of this one.\n\n340\n00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.830\nOkay, so\nthat is what we're going to do here.\n\n341\n00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.630\nNow for us to be able to do that,\n\n342\n00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.690\nI need to be able to get into\nthat configuration file to do so.\n\n343\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.550\nSo here is where I ask you go in and\nI edit that file.\n\n344\n00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:45.038\nSo V-I-R-S-H edit and\nthis would be testvm03-clone.\n\n345\n00:19:45.038 --> 00:19:51.830\nSo I'm actually taking a look at a\nconfiguration file and notice there it is.\n\n346\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:57.400\nHere's all the hardware configuration\nthat we're seeing here, and\n\n347\n00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.789\nwe're gonna scroll down\nto where it says devices.\n\n348\n00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.310\nAnd what I want to focus in on is\nright here where it says raw and\n\n349\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:10.220\nof course I want to change this option\nto the two new options that I have.\n\n350\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.590\nSo this is opening in up inside of the\ntext editor that's native inside of our\n\n351\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.080\nCentOS here.\n\n352\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.500\nSo for me to go ahead and\ninsert I hit the letter I.\n\n353\n00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:26.469\nAnd then we could come in here and\nchange this to qcow2.\n\n354\n00:20:26.469 --> 00:20:29.860\nMake sure that that gets changed there.\n\n355\n00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.640\nAnd then I change this also to qcow2.\n\n356\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:38.130\nAnd then I can save that command.\n\n357\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.740\nAnd there it is.\n\n358\n00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.660\nIt says been edited, and\nthat's what we want.\n\n359\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:46.240\nSo it's an XML, it's now been edited,\nand now that attaches at VM\n\n360\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.690\nnow to that new file format and that's\nwhat we wanna make sure that we use here.\n\n361\n00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:52.740\nOkay?\n\n362\n00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.180\nSo once we have that done,\n\n363\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:59.670\nand let's make sure that we verify,\neverything is still the same.\n\n364\n00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.880\nSo there it is.\n\n365\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.922\nAnd now this file is actually attached\nto the virtual machine itself.\n\n366\n00:21:07.652 --> 00:21:11.530\nWe can no go ahead and\ndo a snapshot at this point.\n\n367\n00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:16.876\nSo if I do a virsh, snapshot and\n\n368\n00:21:16.876 --> 00:21:19.660\nI'm gonna do a list here for this one.\n\n369\n00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.155\nWe don't have any snapshots but\nI just want to verify.\n\n370\n00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:23.530\ntestvm03-clone.\n\n371\n00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:29.340\nNotice I don't have any snapshots here,\nokay, perfectly fine.\n\n372\n00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:34.070\nIf I want to create one,\nI simply type in the word create\n\n373\n00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.360\nto go ahead and create that\nfirst snapshot, and that's fine.\n\n374\n00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.110\nSo once it's created,\nwe should see that as created.\n\n375\n00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:45.880\nIf I run now that list again,\nThere is my first snapshot that's created.\n\n376\n00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:51.716\nNow, can I do this if the snapshot,\nor if the virtual machine is on?\n\n377\n00:21:56.461 --> 00:22:00.640\nVm03-clone.\n\n378\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.460\nWe'll turn that one on.\n\n379\n00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.050\nSo now,\nit's actually getting turned on there.\n\n380\n00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.190\nAnd then, I go back and\nI do a snapshot here again.\n\n381\n00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.180\nSo, I can create a snapshot\nwhen the machine is off,\n\n382\n00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.820\nI can create a snapshot even\nwhen the machine is running.\n\n383\n00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.840\nBut notice it takes a longer of time, and\nit says snapshots are not normally great\n\n384\n00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.840\nEspecially in the way that I did it which\nis while the machine is actually starting\n\n385\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.980\nup and having to do as entire process and\ndoing everything right.\n\n386\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.170\nI'm telling it to do what, to try and\n\n387\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.630\ntake a snapshot in time of\nan incredibly dynamic process.\n\n388\n00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:36.220\nOkay.\n\n389\n00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.600\nBut notice it did create\nanother one here and so now,\n\n390\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.560\nif I just use my arrows and\nlet me get back up to this list here.\n\n391\n00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.120\nYou can now see those two different\nsnapshots, one actually shows the state\n\n392\n00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.690\nof the snapshot that I took\nwhile it was actually off.\n\n393\n00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.410\nThe other one shows while it\nwas running as well, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.190\nAll right, so\n\n395\n00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:01.200\nbeing able to take the snapshot, perfectly\ngreat, perfectly something we want to.\n\n396\n00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.110\nNow the one thing we cannot do though\nis we can't restore a snapshot\n\n397\n00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.560\nwhen it's running.\n\n398\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.400\nNow you can try, don't get me wrong.\n\n399\n00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.720\nAnd in theory, it does work.\n\n400\n00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.700\nIt allows you to be able to do so.\n\n401\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.580\nBut what you're trying to do if you're\ndoing it while it's running is you're\n\n402\n00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.290\ntrying to say here's a static template\non something that's constantly changing.\n\n403\n00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.990\nAnd it may work perfectly well, okay?\n\n404\n00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.150\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n405\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.400\nIdeally though, or\n\n406\n00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.320\nat least my, let's just call it Ronny's\nIdeal, is that you wouldn't do that.\n\n407\n00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.713\nSo instead you would do a shutdown.\n\n408\n00:23:38.868 --> 00:23:44.700\nAnd make sure that it's actually shutdown\nand then you would do a restore.\n\n409\n00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.440\nSo I verified that it actually\ndoes look like it shut down here.\n\n410\n00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.623\nAnd now when you do a restore,\nit's the same command just about.\n\n411\n00:23:56.106 --> 00:24:00.054\nYou do the restore,\nactually snapshot restore, excuse me.\n\n412\n00:24:00.054 --> 00:24:08.460\nSnapshot restore test vm03-clone.\n\n413\n00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.240\nSo the same machine here.\n\n414\n00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.440\nNow, I need to tell it which\nof these two snapshots and\n\n415\n00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.350\nthe way we do it is by the name\nthat's listed over here.\n\n416\n00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.280\nSo if I want the one that was\nactually on the shut down,\n\n417\n00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.456\nI can simply just copy this.\n\n418\n00:24:23.456 --> 00:24:24.249\nOops.\n\n419\n00:24:24.249 --> 00:24:26.988\nNot what I wanted to do.\n\n420\n00:24:26.988 --> 00:24:28.928\nAnd I can paste it in here.\n\n421\n00:24:30.587 --> 00:24:33.090\nOops, [LAUGH] Maybe not.\n\n422\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.660\nAll right let me try and copy this again.\n\n423\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.660\nCopy, I'm trying to be too fancy here.\n\n424\n00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.210\nPaste, there we go.\n\n425\n00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.250\nSo, it just depends on which one you need,\nright?\n\n426\n00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.352\nSo once you do that.\n\n427\n00:24:46.477 --> 00:24:50.070\nAnd now notice that it actually\ngave us this, oh this list, sorry.\n\n428\n00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.687\nI need to actually revert.\n\n429\n00:24:53.687 --> 00:24:54.662\nI was like, what the?\n\n430\n00:24:54.662 --> 00:24:55.881\nAll right.\n\n431\n00:24:55.881 --> 00:24:58.990\nSo now I actually can tell it to revert.\n\n432\n00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.470\nAnd that will now restore\nthat snapshot for me.\n\n433\n00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:03.750\nAnd it might take a little bit of time,\n\n434\n00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.840\nbecause what do you think\nit's actually doing?\n\n435\n00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.710\nIt's going through the hard drive, and\nit's comparing the differences, and\n\n436\n00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.360\nwhere ever there's\na difference it's saying,\n\n437\n00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.980\nwell I'm gonna erase it in\ncomparison to this snapshot.\n\n438\n00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.450\nAnd leave whatever actually\nwas there at the beginning.\n\n439\n00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.320\nAnd then you should be fine,\nand up and running.\n\n440\n00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.120\nSo being able to actually get access\nto this, to be able to revert it.\n\n441\n00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.991\nAnd then we would simply\ndo a virsh start our\n\n442\n00:25:27.991 --> 00:25:34.090\ntestvm03-clone.\n\n443\n00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:35.730\nAnd now it's started and\n\n444\n00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:40.260\nthat should bring it back up in the\noriginal snapshot that we reverted it to.\n\n445\n00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.320\nSo there's a lot that we can do, right?\n\n446\n00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.520\nWe can create the VM's,\nwe can actually take a look here and\n\n447\n00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.430\ngo ahead and clone a VM too.\n\n448\n00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.800\nAnd we've seen this in every technology.\n\n449\n00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.340\nKBM is really no different than that.\n\n450\n00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.520\nThat we see.\n\n451\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.500\nSo it gives us a lot of functionality,\n\n452\n00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.630\nbut all it really is in\nthe power of the command line.\n\n453\n00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.390\nI did mention that,\n\n454\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.670\nin a previous episode, that there are many\ndifferent little management utilities,\n\n455\n00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.710\nthird party utilities that you\ncan add in to do this for you.\n\n456\n00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.880\nAnd that may be the way for you to go.\n\n457\n00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.470\nBut if you want one of the basics here,\nthis is where you actually do go to\n\n458\n00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.200\nat least learn that command\nline option for you.\n\n459\n00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.910\nNow what we also want to do is be able\nto take a look at some of the simple\n\n460\n00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.690\nmanagement things that we need\nto be able to also do as well.\n\n461\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.170\nAnd the good thing is we've\nbeen doing these all along.\n\n462\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:32.620\nWe've talked about using the vrsh\nshutdown as well as start, right?\n\n463\n00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.340\nSo if I wanted to shut down\nall of my virtual, right?\n\n464\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.850\nAgain, fairly simple instead of shut down,\nmakes sense.\n\n465\n00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.745\nLet me do the testvm03.\n\n466\n00:26:45.148 --> 00:26:49.873\nAnd then, I can\n\n467\n00:26:49.873 --> 00:26:54.390\nactually shut both of those down fairly\neasily without having to do anything.\n\n468\n00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.600\nStarting of course we'll actually\nreplace the word shut down with start,\n\n469\n00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.240\nmakes it easy for us.\n\n470\n00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.710\nNow, I briefly mentioned\nthe idea of out start.\n\n471\n00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:06.610\nIf these two machines were\nactually mission critical and\n\n472\n00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.570\nyou were depending on those\nmachines to up and running and\n\n473\n00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.690\nthat you needed them to be able\nto power on automatically.\n\n474\n00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:17.260\nYou instead can actually assign that or\nmark that for autostart.\n\n475\n00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.780\nSo autostart, and\nthen we could do testvm03 here.\n\n476\n00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.920\nAnd those were actually\nmarket as autostart.\n\n477\n00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:33.930\nBut there is a chance though that you may\nnot ever want this thing to auto start\n\n478\n00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:39.250\nand you instead actually wanna make\nsure that it never starts that way.\n\n479\n00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:43.460\nWell, if that actually ends up happening,\nyou can go ahead instead and\n\n480\n00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:48.220\nactually do a -disable and that way, wait,\n\n481\n00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.500\nlet me see here,\nPSH autostart, did I misspell?\n\n482\n00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.420\nOh, testvm03,\nno it may not have liked that one.\n\n483\n00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:03.040\nWell maybe I'm lying to you,\nlet's see, let's try that one.\n\n484\n00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.300\nAll right,\nwell maybe I can't do that in this.\n\n485\n00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.120\nSo I may actually have the wrong command\nfor the wrong operating system here.\n\n486\n00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.520\nSo just kinda realize you can also have\na way where you can disable that as well.\n\n487\n00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.410\nSo, yeah.\n\n488\n00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.672\nNo that's what I have,\nthat may not be the right one, okay?\n\n489\n00:28:18.672 --> 00:28:22.030\nAll right, so,\nthere's a couple of them there so\n\n490\n00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:26.790\nmy more than likely on this last command\nis just a bad syntax at some point here.\n\n491\n00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:32.140\nUnexpected data, it didn't like\nmy clone machine of some sort.\n\n492\n00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.770\nSo let me see if I do\nit with the same one.\n\n493\n00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.360\nNope.\nIt just didn't like my command.\n\n494\n00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.960\nSo I'm not gonna worry\nabout that too much but\n\n495\n00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.430\njust kinda realize that it is possible or\nyou can say only manually start it.\n\n496\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.900\nDon't ever worry about it.\n\n497\n00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.180\nUsually remember by default they're gonna\nstart anyway so you're perfectly fine.\n\n498\n00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.290\nNow, the last one's\na little bit tricky here.\n\n499\n00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:48.910\nOkay?\n\n500\n00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:50.880\nThat I want to actually show you.\n\n501\n00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.640\nWhich is on this clone\nbecause there's a snapshot.\n\n502\n00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.957\nSo let me go ahead and\ntake a look at the snapshot again.\n\n503\n00:29:00.196 --> 00:29:07.210\nSnapshot list and\nthis was on testvm03-clone.\n\n504\n00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.750\nNotice I have these two snapshots, okay?\n\n505\n00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.800\nLet's go ahead and\nget rid of those snapshots and\n\n506\n00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.680\nclick on Applications >\nSystem Tools > End Terminal, and\n\n507\n00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.360\nthis time I'm gonna make sure\nI login in as the root user.\n\n508\n00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.100\nAnd then I'm gonna switch directories\njust because I'm getting paranoid,\n\n509\n00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.800\nwanna make sure I should get into the\nright directory there and have no issues.\n\n510\n00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:37.240\nSo now, I need to run that command, virsh,\nand I need a list of those snapshots.\n\n511\n00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.306\nSo if I do a snapshot.list.\n\n512\n00:29:41.306 --> 00:29:46.640\nFor testvm03-clone, there it is.\n\n513\n00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.180\nThere's one of the snapshots\nthat I have as well.\n\n514\n00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:50.950\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n515\n00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.030\ncopy this cuz I need this in the next\ncommand that I'm going to run.\n\n516\n00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:59.950\nSo I'm gonna highlight this,\nright click and copy.\n\n517\n00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.618\nAnd then I will do a vrsh.\n\n518\n00:30:02.618 --> 00:30:07.933\nVirsh snapshot-delete\n\n519\n00:30:07.933 --> 00:30:12.234\nthe name of the VM and\n\n520\n00:30:12.234 --> 00:30:16.289\nthen that number.\n\n521\n00:30:19.749 --> 00:30:23.086\nSo now when I've deleted it all,\nIt's perfectly fine,\n\n522\n00:30:23.086 --> 00:30:27.620\nI wanna verify that I don't have any\nsnapshots that are actually left there.\n\n523\n00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:33.440\nNow once I do that, I should be able\nto get out of this prompt here.\n\n524\n00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.160\nAnd let's see what happens now.\n\n525\n00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.120\nNow there may actually be something\nelse that ends up happening.\n\n526\n00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.990\nI don't wanna run it, so\nlet me right click and delete.\n\n527\n00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.460\nSelect delete again.\n\n528\n00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.000\nNotice this actually\ndisappeared form here.\n\n529\n00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.300\nNow when you delete it from this,\nguess what?\n\n530\n00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.290\nYou haven't actually finished everything\neven though you think you've done it here.\n\n531\n00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:00.180\nSo let me show you what I mean,\nif I've, here okay?\n\n532\n00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.890\nSo now if I change into VMS here and\ndo a list.\n\n533\n00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.620\nNotice that it did get rid\nof one of those files, but\n\n534\n00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.010\nnotice that the other one is still here.\n\n535\n00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:13.995\nSo, and that is because I ended up\ncreating those two different files\n\n536\n00:31:13.995 --> 00:31:16.125\nfrom that clone at the first time.\n\n537\n00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:19.875\nAnd then switching it to that new file\nsystem so it also means I need to come in\n\n538\n00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:23.825\nhere and also go ahead and\nget rid of this one as well.\n\n539\n00:31:23.825 --> 00:31:28.165\nNow before you do that you wanna make\nsure that it's also unassociated.\n\n540\n00:31:28.165 --> 00:31:31.710\nSo the good thing is this one\nis actually unassociated or\n\n541\n00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:36.450\nready with that VM that we just created\nbecause we attached it to that other file.\n\n542\n00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.110\nSo this one is fairly simple then.\n\n543\n00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.290\nRM for remove directory.\n\n544\n00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:46.350\nVMS and then on this one it's\ngonna be test vm03-clone.img,\n\n545\n00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.090\nif I can actually do that.\n\n546\n00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.158\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n547\n00:31:55.158 --> 00:31:57.013\nOh no, of course, it says I can't do it.\n\n548\n00:31:57.013 --> 00:31:59.540\nAnd look at the reason why\nI can't do it again Wes.\n\n549\n00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.504\nLook who I logged in as.\n\n550\n00:32:00.504 --> 00:32:04.332\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Gotta have that superglue.\n\n551\n00:32:04.332 --> 00:32:06.710\n>> Son of a gun, that is true.\n\n552\n00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:11.550\nSo that is my burden to\nbear there on that one.\n\n553\n00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:20.004\nSo now if I try and remove it again,\ntestvm03-clone.img.\n\n554\n00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.350\nYes, and there we go, if I list it up,\n\n555\n00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:31.500\nnotice now that my image file\nis now also gone as well.\n\n556\n00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.950\nSo if you try and delete it and\nyou're actually saying that, hey look,\n\n557\n00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.170\nhere's the file that won't delete,\nyou may have to go ahead and\n\n558\n00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:42.450\nundefine that connection with the config\nfile and then it will delete.\n\n559\n00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:46.355\nSometimes you will get that, but a lot\nof times it's like this where you use\n\n560\n00:32:46.355 --> 00:32:49.730\nthe management tool and\nit works perfectly fine for you.\n\n561\n00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.891\nSo being able to delete VMs,\nbeing able to clone them,\n\n562\n00:32:52.891 --> 00:32:55.780\nbeing able to actually\ncreate snapshots of them,\n\n563\n00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.215\nas well as create VMs is a pretty hefty\nthing that we can do inside of KVM here.\n\n564\n00:33:00.215 --> 00:33:03.180\nAnd it's something that we\nreally need to learn how to do.\n\n565\n00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.440\nSo we've actually seen that whole\nprocess from the command line.\n\n566\n00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:11.000\nIt does take a little bit of time, and\nsometimes even frustration like what\n\n567\n00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.970\nI have here, where you're just kinda\ngetting your syntax backward or wrong.\n\n568\n00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.560\nAnd you just have to deal with it and\nget through it, but once you do and\n\n569\n00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.680\nyou start creating them fairly quickly,\n\n570\n00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.110\nthis is one of the higher performing\ntypes of hypervisors that you can run.\n\n571\n00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:27.060\nNot as fancy, not a lot of different\nthings that you can go in and\n\n572\n00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.290\ntweak and set unless you really take\nthe time to do it in the command line, but\n\n573\n00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.680\nif you'll learn how to do it,\nall the same things that you can do\n\n574\n00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.530\nin those other type 1 hypervisors and\ntype 2 hypervisors.\n\n575\n00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:40.330\nYou can reconfigure the RAM, the CPUs, and\n\n576\n00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:44.220\nyou can even attach additional hard\ndrive spaces if you choose to as well,\n\n577\n00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.340\nbut it does take more manipulation\nin the command line and\n\n578\n00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.180\nthat's really beyond that scope of\nwhat we're talking about right now.\n\n579\n00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.980\nBut just kind of realize that it\ndoes give you at least a flavor\n\n580\n00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.180\nof what you would be dealing with in KBM.\n\n581\n00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.330\n>> Great information, Ronnie.\n\n582\n00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:00.580\nSo in this episode we've looked\nat how you can suspend the VM for\n\n583\n00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:06.600\nthe purposes of cloning it, how you can\nresume the original VM that you did clone,\n\n584\n00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.060\nas well as starting\nthe clone there itself.\n\n585\n00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.990\nWe've also looked at creating snapshots\nand restoring those snapshots.\n\n586\n00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:18.340\nPretty much managing your VMs throughout\nthe whole entire episode, and\n\n587\n00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.010\nfinally how you can delete your\nVMs all inside of the terminal.\n\n588\n00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.310\nGot anything else for us Ronnie?\n\n589\n00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:27.770\n>> Not really, with that, with the end of\nKVM here, it really does allow you to at\n\n590\n00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:31.320\nleast see, but don't think that this is,\nof course, the end of that knowledge.\n\n591\n00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.950\nThere's plenty of other\nthings that you can do\n\n592\n00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:36.230\nthat's way more advanced\nthan what we've showed you.\n\n593\n00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.870\nBut this will at least help\nyou to get your feet wet, and\n\n594\n00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.360\nas well as with the other technologies\nthat we've seen in this entire series.\n\n595\n00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.740\n>> Well Ronnie, it's been a pleasure\nhaving you here, thank you for\n\n596\n00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:45.890\nthat information.\n\n597\n00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:49.130\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis episode, I've been your host,\n\n598\n00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:49.780\nWes Bryan.\n\n599\n00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.680\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n600\n00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.973\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:34:52.973 --> 00:34:57.780\n[SOUND]\n\n",
