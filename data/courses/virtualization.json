series,\nVirtualization Technologies.\n\n4\n00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.600\nAnd Ronnie,\nwhat can we expect to see in this?\n\n5\n00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.980\n>> When we start taking a look at\nvirtualization technologies, what we're\n\n6\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.040\ngonna do of course is make sure that you\nunderstand what the basics really are.\n\n7\n00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.218\nWe're gonna talk about some different\nterminologies that you're gonna encounter.\n\n8\n00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:29.776\nWe're gonna actually make sure that\nyou understand why we actually use\n\n9\n00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:33.450\nvirtualization, as well as take a look\nat just the basic concepts between\n\n10\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.088\nthe technologies, such as type one and\ntype two high providers as well.\n\n11\n00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:39.090\nSo, we're gonna introduce you that way.\n\n12\n00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.130\nAnd then, you're gonna see in this series\nthat we're going to be walking you through\n\n13\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.680\nsome of the most popular virtualization\ntechnologies you are likely to see,\n\n14\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.573\nsuch as Oracle's VirtualBox.\n\n15\n00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:54.999\nWe're gonna take you through,\nof course, Microsoft's Hyper V,\n\n16\n00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.882\nwe're also gonna take a look\nat VMwares Workstation 2, or\n\n17\n00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:03.795\nWorkstation 11 I should say, and\nthen of course VMwares ESX or VSphere.\n\n18\n00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:07.908\nAnd lastly we're gonna take a look at\none that is a little bit more unusual,\n\n19\n00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:12.482\nespecially if you're just starting out\nin virtualization, one called KVM Kernel\n\n20\n00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:16.590\nbased virtual machines,\nthat normally runs off of Linux as well.\n\n21\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.355\nSo we'll be taking a look at all those\ndifferent technologies for us, and\n\n22\n00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:21.701\nintroducing you to them.\n\n23\n00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:23.789\nWell see, the idea here is fairly simple,\n\n24\n00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.577\nwe want you to actually feel\nlike that you can install it.\n\n25\n00:01:26.577 --> 00:01:29.337\nWe want you to be able to\ncreate a virtual machine in it,\n\n26\n00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:32.250\nas well as be able to manage\nthat virtual machine.\n\n27\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.300\nBe able to do some of the basic things\nthat anybody in the IT industry\n\n28\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.490\nwould actually be able to say hey,\nI can work with that technology.\n\n29\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.810\n>> Ronnie, now speaking of maybe just\nstarting out in a virtualization\n\n30\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.090\ntechnology, is this gonna be\nsomething that's exam based,\n\n31\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.470\nmaybe targeted towards a certain exam or\ncertification?\n\n32\n00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.560\n>> This particular set of shows that\nwe're gonna be doing are not really gonna\n\n33\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.360\nbe exam based, but they're more towards\nhelping you develop as an IT worker.\n\n34\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.090\nThe whole goal is simple, let's just\ntake for an example as a scenario,\n\n35\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.990\nthat you're getting hired for\na company and you wanna learn more about\n\n36\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.250\nvirtualization technology, because you're\ngonna be expected to know about it.\n\n37\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.845\nWell this series is perfect for you,\n\n38\n00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.930\nsince you will get an introduction\nto the basic terminology.\n\n39\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.690\nYou will also end up seeing all of those\ndifferent technologies that we've just\n\n40\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.970\nmentioned here, and show you how to\nactually work in them a little bit, so\n\n41\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.660\nthat you can feel confident\nthat as you go into a job,\n\n42\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.110\nto a production network somewhere,\nthat you're not gonna be completely lost.\n\n43\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.180\nAnd you actually have seen some\nof the very technical sides\n\n44\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.080\nof the way that we install it,\nas well as get a virtual machine up and\n\n45\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.810\nrunning and even getting rid\nof virtual machines as well.\n\n46\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.920\nSo this is actually a very good and\n\n47\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.355\nvery hands on type of series\nyou're gonna eventually see.\n\n48\n00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:51.360\n>> Now, Ronnie, if somebody is getting\ninto virtualization technologies, and\n\n49\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.068\nthey're gonna be watching our series\non virtualization technologies,\n\n50\n00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:57.236\nwho is the targeted audience for this one?\n\n51\n00:02:57.236 --> 00:03:00.881\n>> The targeted audience is really\nthe person that needs to understand more\n\n52\n00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.144\nabout virtualization.\n\n53\n00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:06.309\nWhether you're just somebody that's saying\nhey, I want to know about virtualization,\n\n54\n00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.200\nor whether you're actually somebody that\nis now working on staff at some production\n\n55\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.654\nnetwork and they're telling you you're\nabout to actually get introduced\n\n56\n00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:17.910\nmore to the virtualization technologies,\nor they want you to learn more about it.\n\n57\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.630\nWell here's where you will get a bit of a\ndive into the different technologies, and\n\n58\n00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.490\nregardless of what shop that you're\nworking in, you'll probably see one,\n\n59\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.250\nif not more than one of these\ntechnologies that we will be diving into.\n\n60\n00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.530\nSo if your goal of course is to become\na better IT worker in your skills,\n\n61\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.480\nif your goal is hey, my job is going\nto require it in the near future,\n\n62\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.670\nI need to learn more about it, or\nI'm just interested in the technology,\n\n63\n00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.630\nit will range every where\nin that different range.\n\n64\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.620\nIt doesn't get in to the most technical\naspects of every single virtualization\n\n65\n00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.200\ntechnology, but a good well-rounded\napproach to how you install it,\n\n66\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.120\nhow do you actually create a VM?\n\n67\n00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.120\nWhere do you actually get\nthe installation files from, and\n\n68\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.510\nof course,\nhow do you get it up and running?\n\n69\n00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.246\nAnd we'll actually show you all\nof that in this new series.\n\n70\n00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.411\n>> Great, and if that sounds something\nlike you might be interested in,\n\n71\n00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:10.915\nvirtualization technologies,\n\n72\n00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:13.986\nstick around cuz we've got a lot\nof great episodes coming your way.\n\n73\n00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:19.409\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
