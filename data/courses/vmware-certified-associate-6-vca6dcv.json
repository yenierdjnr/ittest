          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.701\n[SOUND] In this segment,\n\n2\n00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:09.603\nwe're gonna give you a brief overview\n\n3\n00:00:09.603 --> 00:00:16.068\nof our upcoming VCA6-DCV exam series.\n\n4\n00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:19.595\nAnd joining me here to help out with\nevery endeavors, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:22.410\nRonnie, can you help\ngive us a generalization,\n\n6\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.769\na general overview of what this is about?\n\n7\n00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.778\n>> We take a look at actually trying our\nhand here at actually doing the VCA6.\n\n8\n00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:33.505\nWhat we're trying to say is that we wanna\nget used to the technology that we're\n\n9\n00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:36.990\ngonna find inside the VMware\nespecially in vSphere version 6.\n\n10\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.330\nNormally this is gonna be for\n\n11\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.230\nsomeone that is actually a decision maker\ntrying to make a move into virtualization\n\n12\n00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.310\nthinking that it's something that they\nmight wanna do for their data center or\n\n13\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.050\nsomebody that's helping to\nmake that decision as well.\n\n14\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.670\nAnd they need to get more\nfamiliar with the topics so\n\n15\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.650\nthat they have a general understanding and\nthey can actually do a little bit\n\n16\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.350\nmore research into it, to see if\nthis is the way that they wanna go.\n\n17\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.797\nIt really does help out, of course,\nif you have a technical background,\n\n18\n00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:05.687\nyou've been working in IT for a little bit\nof time, but there is no real requirement\n\n19\n00:01:05.687 --> 00:01:08.488\nas far as the certification goes,\nbut it really does help.\n\n20\n00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:12.331\nBecause some of the concepts will cover\nof course our general concepts that we'll\n\n21\n00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.590\nfind throughout the entire IT industry.\n\n22\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.880\n>> So the intended audience for this\nseries is gonna be, anybody that wants to\n\n23\n00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.880\nknow more about virtualization in general\nand maybe even the VMware products itself.\n\n24\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.750\n>> It really is it.\n\n25\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.130\nReally does help us to be able to see how\nthose VMware products hook together and\n\n26\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.540\nbe able to work together.\n\n27\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.301\nUnderstand the technical requirements\nbehind them especially in terms of VMware,\n\n28\n00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:37.110\nvSphere 6.\n\n29\n00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.020\nSo once we have that understanding, that\nmakes it easier for the decision maker and\n\n30\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.900\nmakes it easier for somebody at\nleast trying to administrate or\n\n31\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.580\nget their hands into the administration\nof these sphere 6, as well.\n\n32\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.238\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n33\n00:01:49.238 --> 00:01:54.240\nDoes this series, is it going to\ncorrelate with any exams or tests?\n\n34\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.238\n>> It really does.\n\n35\n00:01:55.238 --> 00:01:58.150\nInside of VMware, of course,\nthey have a learning division,\n\n36\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.160\nwhich means they also have training,\nand they also have certifications.\n\n37\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.409\nSo when we start taking a look at it,\nwhat this actual series is going\n\n38\n00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.398\nto help you out in, is for\nyou to be able to earn your VCA6-DCV.\n\n39\n00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.720\nNow, what does that actually mean?\n\n40\n00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.410\nLet's take a look at my screen here for\na moment and that will help us out.\n\n41\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.330\nSo when we take a look here,\n\n42\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.030\nVMware Certified Associate 6\nData Center Virtualization Fundamentals.\n\n43\n00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.810\nSo the term fundamentals let's\nyou actually understand that,\n\n44\n00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.320\nhey, here is the exam that\nwe are actually going for.\n\n45\n00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.560\nAnd it's actually a fundamentals exam.\n\n46\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.400\nSo it actually rests heavily\nmore on the concepts.\n\n47\n00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.710\nAnd the technologies in terms of\nidentification and understanding\n\n48\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.300\nthe benefits and understanding solutions\nthat VMware provides rather than the idea\n\n49\n00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.360\nof configuration and of mastery of\nall the programs that you see there.\n\n50\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.660\nThis matches up to an exam number\nright here which is 1V0-601.\n\n51\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.670\nAnd that's what you actually wanna\ntake a look at when you start\n\n52\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.840\nto earn that certification.\n\n53\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.290\nOf course, that means that if you're\ngoing to earn that certification,\n\n54\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.600\nyou need to of course sign up and\nbe able to pass it, as well.\n\n55\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.613\nSo some of the details in\nthat is gonna actually be,\n\n56\n00:03:08.613 --> 00:03:11.830\nwell, this, the exam that you take\nis gonna be 50 questions long.\n\n57\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.077\nAnd you'll have a 75 minute duration to\nbuild to take that exam and your passing\n\n58\n00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:23.263\nscore is a 300, now they don’t tell you\nwhat the upper number is but that's what\n\n59\n00:03:23.263 --> 00:03:28.548\nthe passing score is gonna be as a 300 out\nof those 50 questions when you do that.\n\n60\n00:03:28.548 --> 00:03:33.017\nNow, the other thing occurs that most\npeople are concerned about them,\n\n61\n00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:36.532\nis that when you take a look\nthere is a price associated and\n\n62\n00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:41.364\ncurrently the price associated with\nthis is gonna be a about $120, US, so\n\n63\n00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:46.230\nmake sure you note that when you\nactually go to pay for the exam.\n\n64\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.350\nSo this exam is actually the current one\nthat gives you that associate level in\n\n65\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.060\nterms of VMware.\n\n66\n00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.060\nAnd it's actually very easy for you to\nget access to register for this exam.\n\n67\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.160\nNow, before you actually\nsay anything like, man,\n\n68\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.600\ndo I need to go to a testing center?\n\n69\n00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.340\nYou really don't because this\nparticular exam is non-proctored, and\n\n70\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.180\nthat means you can take it online.\n\n71\n00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.176\nNow, does that mean wow,\nit's an online exam, can I cheat?\n\n72\n00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:14.682\nWell, no, you really can't and\nthe reason why is that they actually take\n\n73\n00:04:14.682 --> 00:04:18.980\nscreenshots as you're actually on\nthat exam to see what's going on.\n\n74\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.250\nSo don't think that it's actually\njust unproctored and that means, hey,\n\n75\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.800\nit's an open book exam.\n\n76\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.020\nIt means that time limit is actually\nsomething they follow by very strictly and\n\n77\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.350\nthey do take screenshots of\nwhat's going on during the exam.\n\n78\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.310\nSo they'll know if you're\nactually flipping through and\n\n79\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.430\ngoing through web pages and\nwhen you're doing that.\n\n80\n00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.710\nBut yes, you won't be able to do that.\n\n81\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.090\nNow, when you register for\nthis, it's fairly simple.\n\n82\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.961\nYou'll actually notice that,\nright here on this very page,\n\n83\n00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:44.957\nis that it actually gives you this button.\n\n84\n00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:50.166\nSo if you do a search from your favorite\nbrowser, and you type in VCA6-DCV exam,\n\n85\n00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:55.072\nyou actually bring up this Register Now,\nand if you already have a Pearson VUE\n\n86\n00:04:55.072 --> 00:05:00.456\naccount, you'll just walk through, pick\nthe language that you want this to be in.\n\n87\n00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:04.278\nAnd notice there's three languages,\nEnglish, Japanese and Chinese.\n\n88\n00:05:04.278 --> 00:05:06.719\nIf you actually happen to\nbe proficient in all three,\n\n89\n00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:10.083\nI took mine in English cuz I'm not\nproficient in Japanese, I know a little\n\n90\n00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:13.555\nbit of Chinese, but overall English is\nactually gonna be my base language,\n\n91\n00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:16.580\nyou'll be able to register for\nit, and here's the key.\n\n92\n00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.582\nYou don't just get to register for\nit some time in the future,\n\n93\n00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:23.450\nwhat they actually intend for you to do is\nto get the knowledge that you need, and\n\n94\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.550\nwhen you are ready for that exam, you\nselect that register and you pay for it.\n\n95\n00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.178\nAnd it gives you two\ndays to take the exam.\n\n96\n00:05:30.178 --> 00:05:33.051\nSo you actually see that from\nthat point once you pay and\n\n97\n00:05:33.051 --> 00:05:35.924\nyou say yes,\nat the very end of that process of paying,\n\n98\n00:05:35.924 --> 00:05:39.640\nthere's gonna be a little button\nthat says start the exam.\n\n99\n00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.150\nSo if you accidentally click on that and\nstart it, you have to take the exam.\n\n100\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.600\nSo be very careful when you choose\nto register for this exam, as well.\n\n101\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.730\nNow, the neat thing is, when you actually\nstart taking a look, is that if you get to\n\n102\n00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.430\nthis page, you do have access while down\nhere underneath the Register Now button.\n\n103\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.220\nSo I recommend that you not click\non Register Now immediately after\n\n104\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.090\ngoing to this page.\n\n105\n00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.700\nYou can, you can take a look at it and\nnot register.\n\n106\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.068\nBut notice they actually\ngive you the exam topics,\n\n107\n00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:11.548\neven some suggestions on how to prepare,\nand some additional resources.\n\n108\n00:06:11.548 --> 00:06:14.850\nI recommend that you take\nadvantage of all three.\n\n109\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.700\n>> Ronnie, you actually hit on a really\ngood question here that I've got for\n\n110\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.390\nyou is, what specifically are the topics\nthat we're going to cover in the series?\n\n111\n00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.480\n>> Well, when it comes down to it,\nremember that when we take a look at this,\n\n112\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.280\nwe actually will follow the exam topics\nin the series that we'll be covering.\n\n113\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.520\nSo what we're actually going to do here\nis we take a look here on my machine.\n\n114\n00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.870\nWe'll follow these exam topics along and\n\n115\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.000\nwe'll see that there's some overlap to it\nand which we'll just cover once instead of\n\n116\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.090\nactually going through\nthem multiple times.\n\n117\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.460\nSo for example, explaining\nthe data virtualization concepts,\n\n118\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.820\nidentifying those typical\nchallenges is pretty much key.\n\n119\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.720\nAnd we'll take a look at things like,\nwhat is the data center itself and\n\n120\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.535\nwhat is data center virtualization, we'll\ntalk about the benefits of virtualization\n\n121\n00:06:59.535 --> 00:07:03.588\nas well as some of the common components\nthat we'll also see there, too.\n\n122\n00:07:03.588 --> 00:07:07.488\nAnd then, of course, we'll take a look\nat the challenges that VMware helps us\n\n123\n00:07:07.488 --> 00:07:10.738\nto resolve by taking a look at some\nof the different editions, and\n\n124\n00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:12.980\nwe'll make sure we enumerate those.\n\n125\n00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.060\nTake a look at management challenges,\nscalability, and optimization challenges\n\n126\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.230\nthat we tend to actually have to face,\nand where VMware helps us to face those.\n\n127\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.200\nAnd then, of course,\nwe get into the meat of the product,\n\n128\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.375\nwhich is to get more familiar\nwith vSphere technologies.\n\n129\n00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.774\nvSphere 6, and you'll see us in here,\n\n130\n00:07:31.774 --> 00:07:36.645\nthat we'll go over storage technologies,\nnetworking, resource management,\n\n131\n00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:40.458\navailability and even some of\nthe different products that we may\n\n132\n00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:43.938\nnot have covered anywhere else\nduring the entire course.\n\n133\n00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:47.612\nAnd then, in the end, we'll take a look\nat some of the different challenges that\n\n134\n00:07:47.612 --> 00:07:50.490\nhappen when we start talking\nabout business challenges here.\n\n135\n00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.780\nAnd usually some of the business\nchallenges happen to deal with size.\n\n136\n00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.930\nWhat size is your organization and\nwhat we actually have to expect from that.\n\n137\n00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:58.810\nThe good thing is,\n\n138\n00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.870\nduring the entire course, you'll probably\nend up seeing that we'll cover just about\n\n139\n00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.510\nevery single challenge that we normally\nwill face in the course itself.\n\n140\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.100\nAnd so, at the end it's really just\na review of everything that we need.\n\n141\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.320\nSo when you start taking a look here,\n\n142\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.280\nsome of the things that you want to\nconsider as you actually are preparing,\n\n143\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.090\nand getting ready for\nthis course is the terminology itself.\n\n144\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.280\nMaking sure, of course, that if you\nknow some of the ideas and some\n\n145\n00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.370\nof the concepts, make sure you learn the\nVMware idea and the concepts there, too.\n\n146\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.490\nAnd of course, make sure you actually\nknow the names of these products,\n\n147\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.760\ncuz this is a big one that you\nhave to pay attention to, as well.\n\n148\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.310\nSo this is why it's not the most\ntechnically challenging exam before us,\n\n149\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.180\nbut it is actually an exam that will\nchallenge you as far as the number of\n\n150\n00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.210\nproducts that we go through.\n\n151\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.230\nAnd yes, if you want to pass the exam, you\ngot to know those products, those features\n\n152\n00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.360\nand even some of the benefits of those,\nso make sure you pay careful attention\n\n153\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.860\nduring the entirety of this series\nas we actually go through this.\n\n154\n00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.360\nNow, the other thing is,\nright here on the preparation,\n\n155\n00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.500\nthey have in that nice three-hour\ntraining video for you to go through.\n\n156\n00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.570\nAnd this is their recommended training,\nand\n\n157\n00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.950\nthey even have a practice exam for you.\n\n158\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.780\nAnd all of this is for free.\n\n159\n00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.916\nNow, on the practice exam, it'll give\nyou 99 times to go through this.\n\n160\n00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:17.716\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n161\n00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:21.250\nIt doesn't mean it's the exact same exam,\nso you gotta be careful.\n\n162\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.950\nUse it only to help you assess in areas\nthat you are having problems in, and\n\n163\n00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.520\nyou'll see that if you ever\nget 100% score, you're done.\n\n164\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.470\nIt won't let you take it again.\n\n165\n00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.250\nSo it'll lock you out at that point.\n\n166\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.840\nSo always at the end, it even tells you,\nat least make one answer wrong if you're\n\n167\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.270\nnot taking the exam immediately, and\nthat way you can always go back through.\n\n168\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.730\nUse it to actually find areas\nthat you're weak in and then,\n\n169\n00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.610\nonce you actually find those weak areas,\nmake sure you go back and\n\n170\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.920\nstudy them a bit more in\ndepth when you do so.\n\n171\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.080\nThe other thing that I want you to be able\nto take advantage of, is really this last\n\n172\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.350\none right here where it says,\nTest Drive VMware vSphere Environment.\n\n173\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.590\nThis will give you access\nto a nice virtual lab\n\n174\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.060\nthat will allow you to test drive vSphere\nand take a look at all the different\n\n175\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.720\ncomponents that we talked about\nthroughout this particular series.\n\n176\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.180\nIt's really gonna help you out.\n\n177\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.560\nThe more that you get hands on with it,\nthe better off you're gonna actually\n\n178\n00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.400\nbe as you take a look at those different\nproducts that are actually offered, and\n\n179\n00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.890\nwhat vSphere really wants\nyou to be able to do.\n\n180\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:28.490\nSo there is a lot of information, but I\nthink we're actually ready to get started.\n\n181\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.680\n>> Well, Ronnie, thanks so\nmuch for that overview and\n\n182\n00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.730\nthat general assessment of what we\ncan expect in this upcoming series.\n\n183\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.354\nAnd if it sounds like something\nthat you might be interested in,\n\n184\n00:10:37.354 --> 00:10:40.790\nthen we look forward to seeing\nyou in the upcoming episodes.\n\n185\n00:10:40.790 -->

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.330\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.690\nAnd in today's episode we're\nkicking off our VCA 6 series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.160\nJoining me in the studio to help us\nout with that is our good friend and\n\n7\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.860\nmentor Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.394\nRonnie welcome to show\nsir how is going today?\n\n9\n00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.535\n>> It's going well today.\n\n10\n00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:33.085\nIt's another great day to be right\nhere as we kick off on a new\n\n11\n00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:37.180\nseries taking look at\nthe VMware VCA which it stand for\n\n12\n00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.004\nof course the VMWare Certified Associate\nand version 6 exam.\n\n13\n00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.799\nAnd what we wanna do is we wanna make\nsure that you understand some of these\n\n14\n00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:50.740\ndifferent virtualization concepts as they\nrelate to data center virtualization.\n\n15\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.790\nSo this is one of these exams that will\nreally help you to at least get started to\n\n16\n00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.130\nunderstand the concepts inside\nof data center virtualization.\n\n17\n00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.930\nBut as we get started we wanna actually\njust do a little bit of a review cuz\n\n18\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.930\nit's always great just\nto do a small review of,\n\n19\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.970\nof course,\ninitial virtualization concepts.\n\n20\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.400\nAnd you might be wondering why, we know\nthat ITProTV has a series on it, Ronnie.\n\n21\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.350\nSo why don't we watch that?\n\n22\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.260\nAbsolutely a great idea.\n\n23\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.050\nBy all means, make sure you do check\nout that series as we go through and\n\n24\n00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.640\nwe just show you some of\nthe basics in virtualization.\n\n25\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.330\nBut because we're actually beginning a new\ntopic, review's always a great thing\n\n26\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.130\nbecause we actually understand\nsomething around here at ITProTV.\n\n27\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.320\nThe idea of repetition leads to retention,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.720\n>> That's right, that's exactly right.\n\n29\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.290\nAnd it never hurts to go back over\nthings and to set the foundations,\n\n30\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.770\nset the stage as it were.\n\n31\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.180\nSo we're all fresh in our mind,\nwe've got all of our terms squared away,\n\n32\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.010\nwe're all working with\nthe same vocabulary as well.\n\n33\n00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.410\nThat always helps with that.\n\n34\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.250\nThat being said, Ronnie,\nwhere do we begin with our understanding?\n\n35\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.630\n>> Yeah, a great idea here is to\nactually simply begin with the idea of\n\n36\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.380\nphysical hardware, right.\n\n37\n00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130\nSo most of us are actually used\nto working with computers and\n\n38\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.120\neven working inside a network\nshop in which we have networking.\n\n39\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.640\nAnd we have people working on desktop\ncomputers and even servers but\n\n40\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.110\nwe may not be familiar with\nthe concept of virtualization.\n\n41\n00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.850\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n42\n00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.410\nstart right there and understand at least\nwhat we're actually gonna be doing.\n\n43\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.520\nSo when it comes down to the fundamentals,\nwe're looking at a computer or a server.\n\n44\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.500\nLet's take a look at my screen here and\n\n45\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.960\nthat way we'll talk about the diagrams\nthat will actually help us out.\n\n46\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.500\nSo when it breaks down,\n\n47\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.750\nit's not really about the hardware that\nwe're concerned about, but it's actually\n\n48\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.220\ngiving the understanding that you know\nwhat's going on, on that hardware.\n\n49\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.460\nSo we know that we have\nunderlying computer hardware.\n\n50\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.090\nWe have a single server, or a desktop\ncomputer if you want to but I'm gonna\n\n51\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.500\nuse a server in this example since\nwe're talking about data center here.\n\n52\n00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.930\nAnd we take a look at that,\n\n53\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.440\nit's the idea of the physical\nhardware that we tend to deal with.\n\n54\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.370\nWhether you're talking about\na desktop computer, or\n\n55\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.830\na server, it's stuff that you tend to buy\nfrom one of the vendors that's out there,\n\n56\n00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.520\nyou're generally gonna have CPU,\nor multiple CPUs.\n\n57\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.620\nYou're gonna have RAM.\n\n58\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.010\nNow, when it comes down to servers, you're\ngonna have a lot more RAM than what you,\n\n59\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.190\ngenerally, see in a desktop computer.\n\n60\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.680\nSo, when I start talking about RAM,\nin this size,\n\n61\n00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.890\nI'm talking about quantities, usually\nabout, at least 16, and sometimes 32, and\n\n62\n00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.700\ngoing up even higher than that as well.\n\n63\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.230\nAnd then when we take a look at storage,\nwe start actually talking about storages\n\n64\n00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.970\nin the double digits, as far as terabytes\ngo, a lot of times in today's world.\n\n65\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.457\nNow Daniel and I we actually start in days\nin which all of a sudden when we start\n\n66\n00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:27.103\ntaking a look at the idea of the CPU.\n\n67\n00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:31.631\nWe started off with a single core x86\ntypes of server environments where\n\n68\n00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:37.695\nthe maximum hard drive was 128 gigs and we\njust thought, yeah, that thing's gigantic.\n\n69\n00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:41.395\nAnd 4 gigs of RAM, and\nwe just thought it was insane.\n\n70\n00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:44.710\n>> I think my first computer\nhad 8 megs of RAM in it.\n\n71\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.235\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I was like, this is a beast.\n\n72\n00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:50.945\nThis thing is 133 MHz processor,\nthat's insane.\n\n73\n00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:52.645\nWe've come a long way, right?\n\n74\n00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:53.515\n>> Yeah, we really have.\n\n75\n00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:55.575\nWe've come an incredibly long way.\n\n76\n00:03:55.575 --> 00:03:58.830\nBut when you take a look at it,\nit's basic hardware, okay.\n\n77\n00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.060\nSo, but for you and I to be able to\noperate in that hardware, essentially what\n\n78\n00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.700\nhas to go on is that we actually interact\nwith it through a layer of software.\n\n79\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.990\nAnd so does everything else.\n\n80\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.960\nWe're talking about applications and\neverything else to do the same thing too.\n\n81\n00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.252\nSo as human interaction goes,\nif just the hardware itself,\n\n82\n00:04:15.252 --> 00:04:18.426\nyou're just taking a look at\na big gigantic paperweight.\n\n83\n00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:20.390\nWhen it comes down to it, right?\n\n84\n00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.500\nSo if you don't have anyway that you\ncan actually command the CPU to run\n\n85\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.160\noperations and you can't tell\nthe CPU to pull things out of RAM or\n\n86\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.140\nto pull things off the hard drive,\nyou can't do so.\n\n87\n00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.090\nSo an operating system is\nactually what helps you and\n\n88\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.710\nI to interact with the hardware.\n\n89\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.520\nAnd also then when we need something\nspecific to happen, we tend to of course\n\n90\n00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.600\npurchase applications that will also\ncommunicate through that operating system,\n\n91\n00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.580\nto get the hardware to do\nthe processing that it needs, okay?\n\n92\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.500\nSo when we take a look at\nsomething just like that,\n\n93\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.250\nokay, well that's the way that we\nactually understand computing.\n\n94\n00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.060\nAnd that's a great place\nto actually begin.\n\n95\n00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.640\nWithout this solid\nfoundational concept itself,\n\n96\n00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.550\nthe idea of virtualization seems\nlike magic to most people.\n\n97\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.830\nOkay, it really does.\n\n98\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.690\nBut when we start understanding this and\n\n99\n00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.740\nthis layer that I actually\nhave really in colors here.\n\n100\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.770\nAnd I'm just showing App1 App2 and App3.\n\n101\n00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.050\nIt can be any application\nthat you want to.\n\n102\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.470\nWhat ends up happening is that\nwe have exactly this result.\n\n103\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.580\nWe have a single operating\nsystem that controls access to\n\n104\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.560\nall the available hardware.\n\n105\n00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.540\nNow in that sense,\nthat works perfectly fine.\n\n106\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.490\nBut we find out something\nafter you actually start using\n\n107\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.730\nthat amount of hardware for a while.\n\n108\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.880\nMost of us do not ever tend\nto overtax the computer.\n\n109\n00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.150\nNow, if you're doing things\nlike we do here at IT Pro TV,\n\n110\n00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.620\nwe overtax computers every day.\n\n111\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.340\nAnd one of the big processes that we do,\nis we do video encoding, right?\n\n112\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.147\nSo we were looking at it the other day,\nwe had one machine so\n\n113\n00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:52.044\nslow that we were doing video encoding on,\nand we took a look at the activity\n\n114\n00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:56.197\nmonitor on that MAC and\nthe CPU itself was reading at 500%.\n\n115\n00:05:56.197 --> 00:06:02.240\nI mean that, that's pretty impressive,\n500%, now that is beyond impressive here.\n\n116\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.580\nSo that shows you that yes there is\na possibility of overtaxing machines.\n\n117\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.230\nBut in today's hardware environment,\n\n118\n00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.650\nmost desktop users aren't gonna\nover tax machines at all, okay.\n\n119\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.940\nUsually the reason why is that\nthe applications that are accessing\n\n120\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.840\nmay use a small percentage of it.\n\n121\n00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.690\nAnd the same thing with just\nthe operating system itself,\n\n122\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.960\nyou may get 15 to 20% utilization out of\nthat hardware that you have available.\n\n123\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.320\nSo, the problem that we have then when\nwe move in to the realm of production\n\n124\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.350\nenvironment is simple, is that it starts\nhappening, even at the network, and\n\n125\n00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.650\nat the server levels too.\n\n126\n00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.147\nThe very fact is, in an Active Directory\nenvironment, right, you install\n\n127\n00:06:40.147 --> 00:06:45.137\nthe operating system, you might install\none, or two roles on that one machine, and\n\n128\n00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:49.871\nthat might take up 15-20% of the actual\noperations on that one computer.\n\n129\n00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:52.560\nSomebody else says, hey we need\nto bring up another file server.\n\n130\n00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.460\nWhat do we do?\nWe go out and\n\n131\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.280\nbuy another server, we install that role,\nwe do everything that we need to.\n\n132\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.220\nBut we're really only\ntaking up that amount,\n\n133\n00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.610\nstorage is where we tend to focus in,\nmore on.\n\n134\n00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.313\nSo when we start taking a look at that,\nwhat ends up happening,\n\n135\n00:07:05.313 --> 00:07:07.713\nwhether it's a workstation or\nwhether it's a server.\n\n136\n00:07:07.713 --> 00:07:11.410\nWe end up actually not utilizing all\nof the actual performance that we\n\n137\n00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.940\nactually can have out of that computer.\n\n138\n00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.890\nOkay.\n\n139\n00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.730\nSo you might be wondering,\nwhy in the world is that important?\n\n140\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.190\nBecause that actually goes\nto gigantic overhead, right.\n\n141\n00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.790\nThe very fact you can buy five or\nsix servers and\n\n142\n00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.469\nonly after you actually buy five or\nsix are you really utilizing 100% of\n\n143\n00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:33.800\nreally the equal performance\nof one computer itself.\n\n144\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.540\nSo that's why we wanted to get\nto this point here okay and\n\n145\n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.640\nthat's what has essentially\nended up happening.\n\n146\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.530\nIs that a lot of companies ended\nup saying look we've got five or\n\n147\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.340\nsix servers but\nthey are essentially running like DNS or\n\n148\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.860\nDHCP on their own or just a file server or\njust a domain controller.\n\n149\n00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.857\nAnd don't get me wrong.\nThose roles are essential and\n\n150\n00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:57.117\nthey're important, but they really take\nup a server to be running 24 hours a day,\n\n151\n00:07:57.117 --> 00:07:57.905\n7 days a week.\n\n152\n00:07:57.905 --> 00:08:02.549\nAnd the problem is we're not actually\nutilizing it so it's a big cost overhead.\n\n153\n00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:06.363\nSo the reason why that's important in\nthe realm of virtualization is what\n\n154\n00:08:06.363 --> 00:08:08.490\nvirtualization really does.\n\n155\n00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.511\nSo if I flip on over here,\nI made it a little bit more colorful and\n\n156\n00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.285\nhopefully a little bit better here.\n\n157\n00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:18.380\nIs that we see two things happened\nduring the early stages here, right.\n\n158\n00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.802\nOne is the one that you see over\nhere on the left-hand side and\n\n159\n00:08:20.802 --> 00:08:23.080\nthis is what I remember coming for it now.\n\n160\n00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.642\nI'm not gonna say that the other one\nwasn't around cuz I don't really know\n\n161\n00:08:25.642 --> 00:08:26.545\nhistorically or not but.\n\n162\n00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:30.560\nBut what I'm gonna say is this\nI'm actually used to right here.\n\n163\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.350\nWhat started to happen is that people\nrealize that there's a lot more\n\n164\n00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.570\nutilization that you can\nget out of the hardware.\n\n165\n00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.390\nSo what they did is same thing,\nhardware and an operating system.\n\n166\n00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.620\nBut then said, look we can actually\ninstall an application that we're\n\n167\n00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.780\ngonna call a hypervisor.\n\n168\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:50.590\nAnd that hypervisor will essentially\nlie to another operating system.\n\n169\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.920\nSo that's the way that I term it,\nit will lie.\n\n170\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.650\n>> It's immoral.\n\n171\n00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.370\n>> It is kinda a little bit immoral there.\n\n172\n00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.490\nBut what it does is it tells another\noperating system that I can go ahead and\n\n173\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.930\nshow you a whole computer\neven though it's not really.\n\n174\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.480\nYou're actually still running\non one physical hardware.\n\n175\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.840\nBut it can essentially lie.\n\n176\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.600\nThe hypervisor runs in the application.\n\n177\n00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.390\nAnd then you can install another\noperating system on top of it and\n\n178\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.330\nanother operating system on top of it and\neven more.\n\n179\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.000\nAnd it depends on how much\nphysical hardware that you have.\n\n180\n00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.840\nEspecially RAM and, of course,\nstorage space goes.\n\n181\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.040\nSo that way I can do that and\n\n182\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.450\nwe use this type of hypervisor just\nabout every day here at ITProTV.\n\n183\n00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.100\nMost of us at least on the shows here,\nwe're running Mac.\n\n184\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.480\nI think all of us do now\nthat I think about it.\n\n185\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.410\nWe're running on Macs and\n\n186\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.020\nwe're using a product called\nVMWare Fusion that allows us to do that.\n\n187\n00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.145\nAnd this is exactly the product that ends\nup happening is that we install that\n\n188\n00:09:44.145 --> 00:09:48.870\nhypervisor and then we can go ahead and\nactually build these machines and\n\n189\n00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.436\nthen I can interact with them as if\nthis actually running its own machine.\n\n190\n00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:55.560\nSo that means that even though\nI have one piece of hardware,\n\n191\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.460\nI can be running three or four different\noperating systems Interacting with them,\n\n192\n00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.020\ndoing everything that I need to.\n\n193\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:01.560\nOkay?\n\n194\n00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.910\nSo that's kind of the basic\nbeginnings when we see it.\n\n195\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.193\nNow, the hard thing about it is\nthat there's still overhead.\n\n196\n00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:09.488\nYou still have to actually make room,\nof course, for\n\n197\n00:10:09.488 --> 00:10:11.324\nthe underlying operating system itself,\n\n198\n00:10:11.324 --> 00:10:14.940\nyou still actually have to actually\nrun applications in the background.\n\n199\n00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.410\nSo on mine,\nI'm still running my email client.\n\n200\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.430\nI'm still running that VMware Fusion.\n\n201\n00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.080\nI've actually got a Windows\n10 computer on there.\n\n202\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.310\nAnd I've got a server 2012 for\nSQL running a little bit later as well.\n\n203\n00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.330\nSo I mean I've got three different\noperating systems on this one computer at\n\n204\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.550\none particular time, okay.\n\n205\n00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.970\nSo that actually works and\n\n206\n00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.730\nthis is the one that I'm more familiar\nwith at least from the beginning.\n\n207\n00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.705\nI started off using the Microsoft virtual\nPC, I think 2005 at that point but\n\n208\n00:10:45.705 --> 00:10:49.804\nit's actually 2007 was the last\nedition that was out there.\n\n209\n00:10:49.804 --> 00:10:51.763\nAnd actually figuring this thing out and\n\n210\n00:10:51.763 --> 00:10:55.167\nfiguring out how I can actually do\nthat and installing applications.\n\n211\n00:10:55.167 --> 00:10:58.685\nAnd it does, it just runs like an.other\ncomputer that you're actually on and\n\n212\n00:10:58.685 --> 00:11:01.693\neverything actually works here when\nyou start taking a look at it.\n\n213\n00:11:01.693 --> 00:11:05.500\nSo when you do something like that,\nthat's what's called a hosted hypervisor.\n\n214\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.680\nNow, I'm using a particular term here.\n\n215\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.200\nOkay?\n\n216\n00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.262\nThe reason why I'm using\nhosted is because in terms of\n\n217\n00:11:11.262 --> 00:11:18.170\nthe VMWare type of vocabulary,\nthey call it hosted.\n\n218\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.530\nEverywhere else on the planet,\nyou're gonna call it a type II hypervisor.\n\n219\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.010\nBut in VMWare they call it a hosted\nhypervisor, is what you hear about.\n\n220\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.260\n>> I mean, that is a little more\ndescriptive, to be honest with you,\n\n221\n00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.490\nto say, it's hosted because,\nif you look at Ronnie's diagram,\n\n222\n00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.950\nwhat's happening there, he's saying,\nI've got my hypervisor, but\n\n223\n00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.980\nit's sitting on top of my\noperating system, right?\n\n224\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.982\nSo I've got all these other operating\nsystems that are running through my\n\n225\n00:11:39.982 --> 00:11:40.571\nhypervisor.\n\n226\n00:11:40.571 --> 00:11:44.563\nBut when it wants access to resources\nthe liar, right that we love,\n\n227\n00:11:44.563 --> 00:11:47.720\nour little liar here,\nour little hypervisor.\n\n228\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.962\nIt kinda goes back the operating system\nis like, hey can you access that RAM for\n\n229\n00:11:51.962 --> 00:11:53.447\nme and then send that back.\n\n230\n00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:57.473\nSo he's really got like in the operating\nsystem, it's he's enabler,\n\n231\n00:11:57.473 --> 00:11:58.530\nif you will right.\n\n232\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.122\nIt's enabling it to lie to\nthe other operating system so\n\n233\n00:12:01.122 --> 00:12:03.177\nyou have access to these resources for\nyou.\n\n234\n00:12:03.177 --> 00:12:07.386\nThat is what we need we say host is\nbecause there's already a host on there\n\n235\n00:12:07.386 --> 00:12:09.950\nand it's enabling the hypervisor to work.\n\n236\n00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.100\nIs that well said Ron?\n\n237\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.340\n>> Yeah that's exactly a great summary\nof what we tend to look at when we\n\n238\n00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.560\nstart seeing it.\n\n239\n00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.612\nNow of course then you start moving\ninto the realm of network support or\n\n240\n00:12:20.612 --> 00:12:24.647\ndomain support right the idea\nof domain admin support.\n\n241\n00:12:24.647 --> 00:12:28.670\nWell, you might go, well, that's great for\na desktop operating system.\n\n242\n00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.950\nIt works perfectly fine but\nI need this, but\n\n243\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.350\nI need to actually be able\nto run servers on it.\n\n244\n00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.820\nAnd when you start doing that, servers\nrequire a lot more hardware, a lot more of\n\n245\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.380\neverything to actually run because they're\noperating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n246\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.270\nThey do not turn off.\n\n247\n00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.428\nSo somebody else was actually to come\nup with the idea of what we call\n\n248\n00:12:49.428 --> 00:12:51.400\na Bare-Metal hypervisor.\n\n249\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.210\nAgain, I'm using the VMware\nterm specifically there\n\n250\n00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:58.180\ncuz when you face it on the exam,\nyou might go, well Ronnie said type I.\n\n251\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.460\nI'm not seeing type I anywhere on,\nI understand.\n\n252\n00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.580\nWell, that's called a Bare-Metal\nhypervisor in terms of VMware vocabulary.\n\n253\n00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.550\nSo make sure you note that as well.\n\n254\n00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.340\nNow notice the difference and\nI wanted to put them side-by-side so\n\n255\n00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.550\nthat we can compare them\njust a little bit as well.\n\n256\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.390\nNotice what's missing from here\nwhen you take a look at the stack.\n\n257\n00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.120\nRight, we have hardware\non the hosted one and\n\n258\n00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.220\noperating system and\nthen a hypervisor as well as apps running.\n\n259\n00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.340\nAnd then you have your, of course,\napps running on top of that hypervisor.\n\n260\n00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.440\nOver here, on the right hand side.\n\n261\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.160\nNotice this hardware, and\nthen you have a hypervisor itself.\n\n262\n00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.880\nBut notice what we're missing which\nis that underlying operating system.\n\n263\n00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.530\nSo that means, we can actually run that\n\n264\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.770\nkind of lying piece of software\nhere as exactly what it is here.\n\n265\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.180\nAnd, it actually then can run\noperating systems within it.\n\n266\n00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.420\nWell why is that important?\n\n267\n00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.570\nWell, it's important because if you\ntake a look at the minimum requirements.\n\n268\n00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.790\nLet's just say for a Windows operating\nsystems today requires at least 2 gigs of\n\n269\n00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:02.080\nRAM, requires a 60 gigs hard drive,\nrequires so much for it to run.\n\n270\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.010\nAnd that's just for it can run and then\nevery virtual machine that you're adding\n\n271\n00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.550\nfrom that point would\nalso do the some thing.\n\n272\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:14.000\nMost hypervisors tend to actually be under\n200 to 300 megabytes in size itself.\n\n273\n00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.880\nThe whole thing.\n\n274\n00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.570\nThe hypervisor itself.\n\n275\n00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:22.120\nAnd also, in the amount of RAM it takes\nis insanely minimal to the point where\n\n276\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.280\nit really doesn't even take any more than\nthat, it's usually about 256 megs of RAM.\n\n277\n00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.050\nA baremetal hypervisor tends to run and\nbe able to do everything that it can.\n\n278\n00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.810\nWhat does that give us the advantage\nto do as far as a domain admin or\n\n279\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.230\na network administrator goes as well?\n\n280\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.010\nIt means that we can actually\ncreate other machines and\n\n281\n00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.980\na lot more of them because we\nactually only have the hypervisor.\n\n282\n00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.860\nWe don't have to worry about\nadding in extra stuff here for\n\n283\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.710\nthe underlying operating system\nto actually end up running.\n\n284\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:54.730\nOkay, so notice that on the baremetal\nhypervisor, it's not depending on a host\n\n285\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.050\noperating system anymore, and\nthat means less overhead.\n\n286\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:02.270\nThe other thing that it gives us\nthe advantage to do as well as that.\n\n287\n00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.850\nIt actually gives us also kinda the same\nresource management capabilities\n\n288\n00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.910\nas what we would actually\nhave here in the hosted one.\n\n289\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.320\nBut without having to depend on\nthe operating system to run as well.\n\n290\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.080\nOkay?\n\n291\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.250\nSo if you were to take\na choice between them,\n\n292\n00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:21.830\nfrom the VMWare perspective, okay, and\nthat's where we always have to keep in\n\n293\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.050\nmind here as we're getting ready for\nthe exam.\n\n294\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.420\nWhy would you choose one over the other?\n\n295\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.310\nIf you need to access more hardware and\n\n296\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.740\nmore resources, absolutely choose\nthe bare metal hypervisor.\n\n297\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.120\nBy far,\nthat's what you're gonna choose, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.360\nBut, is there an opportunity?\n\n299\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.850\nIs there a time when you're not gonna\nchoose that bare metal hypervisor?\n\n300\n00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.555\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n301\n00:15:40.555 --> 00:15:44.477\nBut, the only real requirement here,\nwhen you start actually saying,\n\n302\n00:15:44.477 --> 00:15:48.849\nwhen would I use a Type-2 hypervisor,\nor the hosted hypervisor is going to be,\n\n303\n00:15:48.849 --> 00:15:53.220\nif you actually find out something about\nthe machine that you're running it on,\n\n304\n00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.335\nis that the bare metal hypervisor that\nyou're actually trying to install,\n\n305\n00:15:57.335 --> 00:16:00.270\nsays look,\nwe don't support that hardware, okay.\n\n306\n00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.098\nSo if you find that out, if you actually\ngo look, there's no driver support for it,\n\n307\n00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:10.330\nthere's nothing that you can do, and\nyou still need to do some virtualization.\n\n308\n00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.761\nWhat it normally is gonna mean is that\nyou're gonna install an operating system\n\n309\n00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:16.591\non that server, and then you're\ngonna run a Type II hypervisor.\n\n310\n00:16:16.591 --> 00:16:20.600\nNow, can Type II hypervisors do\njust about the same capabilities?\n\n311\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.300\nTo a point it can, okay.\n\n312\n00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.393\nBut, remember, that when you're\nin that Type II hypervisor,\n\n313\n00:16:25.393 --> 00:16:29.760\nyou are dependent upon that operating\nsystem operating the way that it needs to.\n\n314\n00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.260\nUp to date doing everything\nthat it needs to and\n\n315\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.640\nthat you're depending on that operating\nsystem to never get corrupted.\n\n316\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.550\nSo you've got a lot more\nto have to deal with.\n\n317\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.670\nBut that's usually the choices here.\n\n318\n00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.120\nSo most people do ask, when should\nI choose one over the other one?\n\n319\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.550\nUsually, here is the two\nscenarios that you have.\n\n320\n00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.900\nYou need more access to the server side,\nand\n\n321\n00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.300\nas far as more machines need to be built,\nmore stuff needs to be done,\n\n322\n00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.720\nmore than likely the choice is always\ngonna be this idea of the Bare-Metal.\n\n323\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.530\nBut if you do have hardware that's\nspecific, that's customized,\n\n324\n00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.370\nwhatever it is,\nyou don't have that ability to do so.\n\n325\n00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.000\nWell, you're probably gonna end up\nchoosing this idea of the Type II or\n\n326\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.557\nthe hosted hypervisor itself, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.950\nSo that's what we talk about in terms of\nfundamentals when you start taking a look\n\n328\n00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:16.940\nat the idea of the movement or\nthe foundation of virtualization, right?\n\n329\n00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.040\nWe take essentially Bare-Metal hardware,\nor whatever hardware it is, and\n\n330\n00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.850\nwe actually are creating essentially\na software version of that\n\n331\n00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:28.340\nin these hypervisors,\nis what we're taking a look at, okay.\n\n332\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.990\nSo the reason why that's important,\nright, is because when you think about\n\n333\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.210\nwhat a hypervisor does,\nthat's what happens here and so\n\n334\n00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:42.130\nhere's what the result should actually end\nup being inside of a hypervisor, okay?\n\n335\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.550\nIs that every VM, which is what\nwe call a virtual machine, right,\n\n336\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.489\nthat's created, what they will end\nup seeing is through the hypervisor,\n\n337\n00:17:50.489 --> 00:17:53.800\nis that they'll see their own hardware,\nokay?\n\n338\n00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.740\nEvery bit of it, they'll think that\nthey're actually on their own machine,\n\n339\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.010\non their own hardware, on everything.\n\n340\n00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.850\nAnd so it doesn't matter, as long as you\nhave the resources available on that\n\n341\n00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:08.550\nhosted physical machine, that means that\nevery machine will see its own, okay.\n\n342\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.970\nAnd it also means it's isolated.\n\n343\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.680\nIn other words,\nthe VM over on the left-hand side,\n\n344\n00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.540\ndoesn't necessarily know about\nthe VM over on the right-hand side.\n\n345\n00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.920\nSo they're not saying hey,\nlook, you're taking up my RAM.\n\n346\n00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.660\nYou're using those resources here and\nI need it back.\n\n347\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.920\nSo they're not actually in contention and\n\n348\n00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.570\nthe way that we assign that is\nreally all through software.\n\n349\n00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.690\nSo when it comes down to it,\nthe hypervisor is essentially that.\n\n350\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.870\nIt is creating a software\nversion of our hardware.\n\n351\n00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.470\nAnd when it does that, every VM actually\nlooks at that software and says, yeah,\n\n352\n00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.800\nthat's my hardware, okay?\n\n353\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.040\nSo that's why I say it lies to\nthe actual operating system.\n\n354\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.860\nCuz every operating system that\nends up running on it goes yeah,\n\n355\n00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.050\nthat's exactly right.\n\n356\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.460\nIt doesn't actually know that it's\nactually being lied to a lot of times.\n\n357\n00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.380\nAnd you might say well, what's the benefit\nof that, why would we do that?\n\n358\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.780\nWell, notice what happens here if I'm\nto do something, and let's see, Daniel,\n\n359\n00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.966\nyou know my line drawing\nability is legend domain here.\n\n360\n00:19:04.966 --> 00:19:06.283\nYeah, look at that, that's beautiful.\n\n361\n00:19:06.283 --> 00:19:08.430\nIsn't that gracious or beautiful here?\n\n362\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.948\nBut even if this VM then,\nright, happens to crash.\n\n363\n00:19:14.948 --> 00:19:19.530\nRight there, I mean,\nheaven forbid it should actually stay red.\n\n364\n00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.463\nBut even if that VM were to crash,\nnotice that what we still have is what,\n\n365\n00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:26.943\nthe physical operating system\nstill being able to operate, and\n\n366\n00:19:26.943 --> 00:19:31.160\nthe other VMs that may be out there,\nstill being able to operate.\n\n367\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.960\nIf we only had it without virtualization,\nright?\n\n368\n00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.590\nThat app may crash but\n\n369\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.750\nif the operating system crashes\nyou don't have access to anything.\n\n370\n00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.220\nSo, the idea of actually\nbeing able to do this, right?\n\n371\n00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.690\nIt has some benefits that we\ncan actually attach to it here.\n\n372\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.250\nAnd so that's some of\nthe things that we wanna make\n\n373\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.140\nsure that we understand as far as\nthe basic operations go, right?\n\n374\n00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.460\nSo by being able to do this, you start\nseeing where now, inside of a domain,\n\n375\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.960\nright, being able to create servers in\nwhich you go I can mimic essentially\n\n376\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.770\nthat server's hardware and actually run\nanother server on top of it, yes, okay.\n\n377\n00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.260\nThat is where we actually\nwant to begin here.\n\n378\n00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.600\nBecause it really does,\n\n379\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.750\nit means that as long as there's\nno physical damage here, okay.\n\n380\n00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.790\nAnd actually, even if there is, to tell\nyou the truth, the software actually\n\n381\n00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:24.470\nmimics the areas that it doesn't, it just\nsays here's a complete set of hardware\n\n382\n00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.750\nthat you actually said that needed to\nbe done and that's what has to happen.\n\n383\n00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.730\nSo even if there's some hardware failure,\n\n384\n00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.735\na lot of times even this,\nthe VMs don't actually report that hey,\n\n385\n00:20:33.735 --> 00:20:38.870\nthere's actually RAM missing or the hard\ndrive, it just tells you hey, the hard\n\n386\n00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.630\ndrive is getting smaller because you don't\nhave enough space, but that's about it.\n\n387\n00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:46.150\nSo it's one of those unusual\nthings that we have to think about\n\n388\n00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.770\nwhen we start thinking about the basics\nof virtualization here, okay.\n\n389\n00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.940\nSo when we take a look, let's take\na look at some of these ideas of\n\n390\n00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.260\nbenefits in running a model like this,\nright.\n\n391\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.820\nWhen we start taking a look\nthen at virtualization, okay,\n\n392\n00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.840\norganizations can reduce the hardware and\nuse hardware more efficiently.\n\n393\n00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.040\nAnd the reason why is that we can run\nmultiple VMs on the same physical host.\n\n394\n00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.360\nWell, this should make sense,\n\n395\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.360\nremember at the beginning we talked about\nthat when organizations weren't using\n\n396\n00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.960\nvirtualization, you might have bought\na machine for a domain control.\n\n397\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.070\nOr you might have bought one for a DNS\nserver, you might have bought one for\n\n398\n00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.710\na DHCP server and stacked them\nall up inside of your rack and\n\n399\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.560\neach one, install the same operating\nsystem on it or different, depends on you.\n\n400\n00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.990\nPut those roles on there that you needed\nto, made them operate and that was great.\n\n401\n00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.660\nAnd that was fine and\nthat actually ended up working.\n\n402\n00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.740\nBut in each one of those,\n\n403\n00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.730\nyou're only utilizing just a very small\npiece of the actual physical hardware.\n\n404\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:48.650\nSo every server, essentially,\nwas overpowered to the extreme, okay?\n\n405\n00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.030\nWell, by using something\nlike the hypervisor and\n\n406\n00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:56.420\nbeginning that concept of virtualization,\nI can now take one Bare-Metal hypervisor\n\n407\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.460\nand create my own VMware\ndomain controller.\n\n408\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:07.960\nOr, my own VM DNS server, or my own\nVM DHCP server, my own VM file server.\n\n409\n00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.470\nCreate all those, and\n\n410\n00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.980\nactually make them run on a single\nphysical machine if I want to, okay?\n\n411\n00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.510\nNow when you do that, remember,\n\n412\n00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.160\nit still can actually have that failure\nof the hardware, don't get me wrong.\n\n413\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.230\nBut overall, though, one failure of one of\nthose servers doesn't necessarily affect,\n\n414\n00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.470\nas far as the performance goes,\nthe failures of the other one.\n\n415\n00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.790\nSo it actually gives you what we\ncall a more efficient utilization\n\n416\n00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:35.350\nof that hardware and that's one of the big\nbenefits that we also have as well.\n\n417\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.000\nThe other one is what we\nalready talked about as well,\n\n418\n00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.690\nthat isolation that we actually\nwant to take a look at.\n\n419\n00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:45.340\nRemember that every machine actually\nsees their hardware as theirs.\n\n420\n00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.510\nThey do not actually have to wait for\nanybody else to actually get access to it.\n\n421\n00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.630\nEach particular machine actually\nuses it as their own, okay?\n\n422\n00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.490\nAnd, apparently, I doubled that up,\nso we didn't need that.\n\n423\n00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.190\nAnd then lastly, what we're also going\nto see here as well when we start taking\n\n424\n00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.970\na look at it, is that there are also,\nof course, business cases for\n\n425\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.820\nthis that will actually help\nout tremendously as well.\n\n426\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.840\nSo when you start seeing the idea\nof each isolation there and\n\n427\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.855\nyou start turning it around\nin terms of benefits for\n\n428\n00:23:11.855 --> 00:23:15.370\na business, there are a few of\nthem that we can actually do here.\n\n429\n00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.240\nAnd I did not type these in,\nwhich I probably should have, but\n\n430\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.240\nlet's go ahead and\ntalk about them as we're going along.\n\n431\n00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:26.357\nOkay, so one of the other ones here, let\nme get the same one, is Arial, I think.\n\n432\n00:23:26.357 --> 00:23:27.911\nOops, well maybe not.\n\n433\n00:23:27.911 --> 00:23:33.461\nArial, if I can find it,\nArial Hebrew, how's that.\n\n434\n00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:35.325\nNo, no that one won't work for me.\n\n435\n00:23:35.325 --> 00:23:36.590\nThere we go.\n\n436\n00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:40.160\nArial and, of course,\nit's black, why wouldn't it be?\n\n437\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.699\nSo here, let's talk about Testing and\nDevelopment.\n\n438\n00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:49.280\nI'll just add that one\nin here just briefly.\n\n439\n00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.709\nSo when you start taking a look at\nsome of the benefits here, okay?\n\n440\n00:23:52.709 --> 00:23:56.507\nDaniel, if you were to come to me today,\nor actually,\n\n441\n00:23:56.507 --> 00:23:58.747\nlet's move back ten years ago.\n\n442\n00:23:58.747 --> 00:24:03.276\nAnd you would say, Ronnie, we need\nto set up some different servers for\n\n443\n00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:06.084\ntesting this new application deployment.\n\n444\n00:24:06.084 --> 00:24:10.201\nAnd you told me about five or\nsix different applications to do something\n\n445\n00:24:10.201 --> 00:24:14.522\nlike that, I would actually have to go\nabout it by getting applications and\n\n446\n00:24:14.522 --> 00:24:16.340\nmultiple servers, right?\n\n447\n00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.780\n>> Yeah,\nyou'd have to buy all the hardware.\n\n448\n00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.860\nYou'd have to get the operating\nsystems installed on said hardware.\n\n449\n00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.650\nThen, not only that, you'd need\nthe development environment necessary to\n\n450\n00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.610\ncreate the development\nstuff that you want to do.\n\n451\n00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.730\nIf you're trying to code in C++ or Java or\n\n452\n00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.110\nwhatever, all that's gotta be put on\nthere and that's gotta be done by you.\n\n453\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.710\nThat's gonna take up resources.\n\n454\n00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.780\nYou gotta rack it in the server rack.\n\n455\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.260\n>> Space.\n>> Takes time, takes space, takes power,\n\n456\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.140\nyou gotta plug it in,\nturn it on, run extra cables,\n\n457\n00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.250\nget it hooked up to the network.\n\n458\n00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.990\nI'm talking about a lot\nof administrative effort\n\n459\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.020\njust to get that test bed set up for you.\n\n460\n00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:51.560\n>> Yeah, it is amazing that when you think\nabout it, as far as a business goes,\n\n461\n00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.500\nif somebody said we really need to\nrun this testing environment cause we\n\n462\n00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.820\nwant to get in to this area of\nthe business or whatever it is.\n\n463\n00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:02.480\nIt could really cost a ton of money just\ngetting that testing environment set up.\n\n464\n00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.580\nWell by using something like\nvirtualization instead I have\n\n465\n00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.660\nplenty of space on my server\nthat's actually available right.\n\n466\n00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.610\nAnd all we actually need,\n\n467\n00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.680\nif everything is actually coordinated in\nthe way that needs to- the networking is\n\n468\n00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.624\nthere, the hardware's there, well now all\nRonnie has to do is spin up maybe three or\n\n469\n00:25:18.624 --> 00:25:22.100\nfour different server VMs and\nrun them at the same time.\n\n470\n00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.280\nI can even put them on\na different virtual network so\n\n471\n00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.260\nthey don't affect my business traffic,\nmy actual production network as well.\n\n472\n00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.190\nSo now, all of a sudden, you start going,\nwait a minute, we can do that?\n\n473\n00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.880\nYes, you can do it, and\nisolate that particular network by itself.\n\n474\n00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.370\nAnd that way, you do not have to worry.\n\n475\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.240\nSo, even in a testing and development\nenvironment, this is the way to go.\n\n476\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.040\nThis is what we do at ITProTV,\n\n477\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.990\nwhen we start doing things\nlike the server shows, right?\n\n478\n00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.710\nIn the server shows, you're running two or\nthree different servers,\n\n479\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.340\nand you're working alone with a client.\n\n480\n00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.800\nWhat we're actually doing a testing\nenvironment to prove the concept\n\n481\n00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.490\nthat we're actually trying to develop and\ntrying to show you as well, and\n\n482\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.180\nit really does.\n\n483\n00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.830\nIt's either that or what we have to\ndo we have to pull out some machines,\n\n484\n00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.520\nget them all set up over on the wall,\n\n485\n00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.150\nmake sure they're networked together,\nverify that we can connect to them.\n\n486\n00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.250\nInstead using that virtualized\nenvironment, we simply\n\n487\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.310\nalready have all that stuff connected\nbecause it's all done through software.\n\n488\n00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.830\nAnd that actually does\nhelp us out tremendously.\n\n489\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.390\n>> And Ronnie,\none of the cool things about that is,\n\n490\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:25.230\nonce I create that Virtual Machine,\nit's kind of like a file.\n\n491\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.820\nIt's this self-contained entity.\n\n492\n00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.060\nAnd if I've got the storage capacity,\nI can make it copy that file,\n\n493\n00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.740\nand I can stick it over my storage.\n\n494\n00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.300\nSo when my dev team gets done testing\ntheir environment, you say, okay,\n\n495\n00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.970\nwe're done with that,\nyou can blow it away!\n\n496\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.530\nWell, I still have a copy of that if they\nsay, hey now we want to test it in Python.\n\n497\n00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.140\nCould you build us a Python?\n\n498\n00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.460\nSure, not a problem.\n\n499\n00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.630\nI've already got the base\nvirtual machine that I need.\n\n500\n00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.260\nI just throw that on there and\nPython to it.\n\n501\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.130\nAnd I'm also even faster than I was before\n\n502\n00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.920\nbecause I didn't have to\nbuild the operating system.\n\n503\n00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.280\nSo there's another speed advantage\nwith working with virtual machine.\n\n504\n00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.138\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt, and the speed\nadvantage is what we're also talking about\n\n505\n00:26:59.138 --> 00:27:01.080\nwhen it comes down to the business case.\n\n506\n00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.600\nEven though testing a development\nenvironment that might take weeks for\n\n507\n00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.960\nus to actually do, most of the time\nespecially in a production environment,\n\n508\n00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.410\nwhen we need to bring up a server It did.\n\n509\n00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.590\nIt took us ordering that server,\nwaiting for\n\n510\n00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:16.010\nit to come in, making sure that\nthe operating system was actually\n\n511\n00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.860\ndone the way that we getting\neverything all together.\n\n512\n00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.710\nInstalling it, putting it in\nthe server rack, hooking up network,\n\n513\n00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.520\nverifying IP addresses, getting everything\ndone the way that we wanted to.\n\n514\n00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.450\nAnd that took a lot of time.\n\n515\n00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:30.410\nWell in today, the way that the actual\nvirtualization helps us to work\n\n516\n00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.730\na bit faster, is that all that is done and\nwe configure the software.\n\n517\n00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.570\nWe tell the virtual machine\nhow many CPUs we need.\n\n518\n00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.450\nWe tell the virtual machine how much\nRAM we want this thing to run in.\n\n519\n00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:45.910\nAnd we tell it how much hard drive\nspace are we willing to work with, and\n\n520\n00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.240\nthen if we everything set up, like through\na deployment server, we can deploy it\n\n521\n00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.090\nright to that thing without ever having\nto actually buy any additional software.\n\n522\n00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.650\nGet it up and running probably\nwithin a couple of hours and\n\n523\n00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.560\nnow you are ready to go.\n\n524\n00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.180\nSo, there are actually\nspeed cases here and\n\n525\n00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.910\nbusiness cases that we might see\nthe idea of rapid deployment.\n\n526\n00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:08.320\nThe idea of actually being able to\ntake on the environment that we have\n\n527\n00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.280\nin which we might actually\nbought an application, right?\n\n528\n00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.130\nAnd that ran insanely slow on\nregular desktop computers,\n\n529\n00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.410\nlet's just do that,\nthat's a great case scenario here.\n\n530\n00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.190\nAn application in like\neverybody's desktop computer this\n\n531\n00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.230\napplication is just overwhelming,\nwe can't run it, okay.\n\n532\n00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.220\nWe know we need to upgrade\neverybody's desktops.\n\n533\n00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.970\nWell we might even be able to go\nlook let's virtualize the thing.\n\n534\n00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:37.225\nGive that particular VM whatever that she\nneeds and allow people to do a remote\n\n535\n00:28:37.225 --> 00:28:40.891\ndesktop connection into it,\nturning it into a terminal server and\n\n536\n00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:45.539\nnow that application says, look, I've got\nfour CPUs, I've got four gigs of ram,\n\n537\n00:28:45.539 --> 00:28:48.379\nI've got everything that\nI actually wanted here.\n\n538\n00:28:48.379 --> 00:28:51.883\nAnd now we actually go ahead and\neverybody actually has access to that and\n\n539\n00:28:51.883 --> 00:28:54.310\nthat's what they actually feel and see.\n\n540\n00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.100\nAnd so, so you have that business case.\n\n541\n00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.250\nAnd of course what we're\nactually focusing in on, okay,\n\n542\n00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.580\nas far as our show goes\nis what we call DCV.\n\n543\n00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:09.426\nNow I want you to get familiar\nwith that acronym here,\n\n544\n00:29:09.426 --> 00:29:12.548\nbecause of course in VMware here,\n\n545\n00:29:12.548 --> 00:29:17.405\nthat stands for\nData Center Virtualization, okay.\n\n546\n00:29:17.405 --> 00:29:22.073\nNow the reason I'm actually doing it like\nthis here is that we want to establish\n\n547\n00:29:22.073 --> 00:29:26.528\nthis idea of benefits here is that we\nfocused in on really the idea the server\n\n548\n00:29:26.528 --> 00:29:30.900\nright an isolated unit right or\na desktop a very isolated unit.\n\n549\n00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.060\nBut data center virtualization Means that\n\n550\n00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:39.630\nwe can actually virtualize more\nthan just the idea of a single VM.\n\n551\n00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.940\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n552\n00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:46.850\nA VM is kinda the core,\nfundamental technology that we need.\n\n553\n00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.830\nIt really is,\nit's all about those VMs actually running.\n\n554\n00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.050\nBut believe or not, when we start talking\nabout data center virtualization,\n\n555\n00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.390\nyou're now actually moving\njust away from just a VMs\n\n556\n00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:00.530\nto now talk about virtualized networking,\nvirtualized storage,\n\n557\n00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:05.450\nvirtualized management of platforms\nthat are just incredible.\n\n558\n00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.080\n>> It's a private cloud environment,\nreally.\n\n559\n00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.310\n>> It is a private cloud environment\nin which that that sense here.\n\n560\n00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:15.470\nIt means that you can actually\nmanage it very easily as well okay.\n\n561\n00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:19.990\nSo that is the whole goal of\nvirtualization as far as the benefits goes\n\n562\n00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.940\nis that when we ask you trying to\nwork with everything in the physical\n\n563\n00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:27.140\nlevel right is each iteration\neach server I've got to touch but\n\n564\n00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.200\nwhen it come down to virtualization\na management console\n\n565\n00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.880\nregardless of where it is on the planet\nnow, where it is in my network.\n\n566\n00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.780\nWhether it's, you know,\non the other side of the country or\n\n567\n00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.850\nwhether it's here I can open up\na single management portal inside of\n\n568\n00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:45.080\nthat virtualization be able to access it\nand manage it all at one time as well.\n\n569\n00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.006\nSo there's tons of benefits to\nthe idea of actually starting and\n\n570\n00:30:49.006 --> 00:30:51.993\nestablishing the concepts\nof virtualization.\n\n571\n00:30:51.993 --> 00:30:56.375\nAnd what we're gonna end up finding out is\nthat VMWare is one of those solutions that\n\n572\n00:30:56.375 --> 00:31:00.257\nwe can absolutely use here as far as\nvirtualization goes that may actually\n\n573\n00:31:00.257 --> 00:31:03.900\nshow us the benefit beyond what\nwe could have actually imagined.\n\n574\n00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.000\n>> And a great solution at that a work\nof VMWare for quite sometime now and\n\n575\n00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.610\nit's been a wonderful environment to play\naround and I'm looking forward to doing\n\n576\n00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.920\nthe show with you Ronnie and\nnow that we're all on the same page.\n\n577\n00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.740\nWe understand all the terminology.\n\n578\n00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.360\nOur language is going to be consistent.\n\n579\n00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.280\nWe can now really begin to dig in and\nsee what VMware has to offer for us.\n\n580\n00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.220\nSo look forward to that, Ronnie.\n\n581\n00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.230\nIs there anything else you'd like\nto add before we close the show?\n\n582\n00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.770\n>> Well, not in this episode.\n\n583\n00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.980\nBut we still have a little bit more of\nfundamentals that we're gonna cover\n\n584\n00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.720\nas we get more into the data center\nvirtualization side and show that.\n\n585\n00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.190\nCuz we really did focus in\non isolating that one unit.\n\n586\n00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.050\nWe're gonna talk about that\nconcept a little bit more, and\n\n587\n00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:42.860\nthen we're gonna jump into\nsome VMWare stuff, and again,\n\n588\n00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.620\ngetting familiar with it is the key to\nactually being successful on the exam, so\n\n589\n00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.040\nwe're gonna dive into showing you all the\nmanagement concepts that are there too,\n\n590\n00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.660\nat least briefly, and\nmake sure that you understand them.\n\n591\n00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.270\n>> All right.\nWell thanks for stopping by Ronnie.\n\n592\n00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.800\nThanks for explaining these concepts and\nterminology to us.\n\n593\n00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.450\nHopefully, you guys got a lot\nout of this episode and\n\n594\n00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:02.090\nwe look forward to seeing you\nat the upcoming episodes.\n\n595\n00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.940\nJoin us then.\n\n596\n00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.990\nAs to this episode,\nwe're gonna ahead and sign off.\n\n597\n00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.480\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n598\n00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.350\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n599\n00:32:08.350 -->

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.710\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.180\nIn today's episode, we're continuing on\nwith our VC, what is it again Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.680\nVC-\n>> VCA6.\n\n6\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.930\n>> VCA, that's it.\n\n7\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.991\nI wanna say VCD, but that's VCA,\n\n8\n00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:26.954\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:29.334\n>> Version 6 series we've been working on.\n\n10\n00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:30.224\nAnd as you can see,\n\n11\n00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:33.455\njoining us today is none other than\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:34.628\nRonnie welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:34.628 --> 00:00:36.498\n>> Well thank you for having me back,\n\n14\n00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:40.637\nas we take a look at more of the VCA6.\nRemember that stands for VMware Certified\n\n15\n00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:44.047\nAssociate, and it's in version 6.\nThat's because there was actually\n\n16\n00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:46.065\nan original version 5\nthat they had out there.\n\n17\n00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:48.111\nAnd this particular exam is actually\n\n18\n00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:52.203\ndesigned to help you to feel confident\nof course, about some of the VMware\n\n19\n00:00:52.203 --> 00:00:56.493\ntechnologies that you're actually going\nto be using, especially if you get\n\n20\n00:00:56.493 --> 00:01:00.155\ninto data center virtualization.\nSo in a previous episode right,\n\n21\n00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:04.355\nwe've already taken a look at some of the\nfundamental concepts of virtualization and\n\n22\n00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:06.510\nwe’re actually doing\na little bit of review.\n\n23\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.750\nAnd we ended that particular series by\ntalking about one of the things that we\n\n24\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.730\ncan actually think about virtualizing\nas far as a benefit goes,\n\n25\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.410\nis to move into the realm of what\nwe call data center virtualization.\n\n26\n00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.209\nSo when we, that's where we wanna pick up,\nis that idea of data center virtualization\n\n27\n00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:26.841\nand to take a look at that, and\nwhy is that concept needed as well.\n\n28\n00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:30.364\nOkay, so, let's go ahead and\ntake a look on my screen, and\n\n29\n00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:32.555\nthis will help us to get started too.\n\n30\n00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:36.324\nSo, what I've done is I've created\na small drawing of a data center.\n\n31\n00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:39.842\nI probably took a little bit more\ntime on this than I should have here.\n\n32\n00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:43.614\nBut I'd started, it's one of those things,\nyou start off and then it’s like I wanna\n\n33\n00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:46.939\nadd this in there, I wanna add this, and\nall of sudden when I was done I was like,\n\n34\n00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.000\nman, I took more time on\nthat than I should have.\n\n35\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.006\nBut when you start taking a look at it,\n\n36\n00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:54.040\nremember that data center\nvirtualization then, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.640\nWhen we started talking about the idea\nof just regular virtualization,\n\n38\n00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.570\nwe were pretty much saying one PC,\none server.\n\n39\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.142\nAnd then you can of course go to\nmultiple servers when you do that.\n\n40\n00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:05.497\nBut when you talk about\ndata center virtualization,\n\n41\n00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:08.018\nwell now you’re actually\ntaking a look at more, right?\n\n42\n00:02:08.018 --> 00:02:12.261\nSo when we take a look at the idea of a\ndata center, right, we’re actually talking\n\n43\n00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:15.990\nabout the conglomeration of multiple\ntechnologies together, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.090\nWe may have servers that still run\nthe applications that we need,\n\n45\n00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.900\nthe services that we need, that respond\nto everything that we actually have\n\n46\n00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.170\nout there that everybody in our\nnetwork needs to get access to, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.490\nAt the same time, we also may\nhave different storage devices.\n\n48\n00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.084\nAnd storage,\n\n49\n00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:35.264\nof course, has become a little bit more\ncomplicated over the years as well.\n\n50\n00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:40.521\nWe've moved from hard drives that\nare just on those servers themselves,\n\n51\n00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:44.421\nto NASs, SANs,\ndirect-attached storage, iSCSI,\n\n52\n00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:48.517\nFibre Channel,\nFibre Channel over Ethernet, jiminy.\n\n53\n00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:51.785\nI mean you keep naming it, and every time\nyou go into a different data center,\n\n54\n00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:54.699\nyou actually see where people go,\nno, we used that last year and\n\n55\n00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.035\nnow we've changed this year.\n\n56\n00:02:56.035 --> 00:02:59.615\nAnd you’re, wait a minute,\nI just got used to that technology, and\n\n57\n00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:01.862\nit continues to change and evolve as well.\n\n58\n00:03:01.862 --> 00:03:05.127\nAnd of course you have security,\nyou have networking devices,\n\n59\n00:03:05.127 --> 00:03:07.250\nrouters, and switches and everything.\n\n60\n00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.196\nWhen I think about of the idea of managing\nthat, and I didn't even include in\n\n61\n00:03:11.196 --> 00:03:14.958\nthe Internet connection, right,\nthe actual connection out to WANs and\n\n62\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.983\nstuff like that, I mean, there's a ton\nof different things in here, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:18.983 --> 00:03:24.270\nNow, when we start taking a look at\nthe management side of all this stuff,\n\n64\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.213\nit can become a little bit\nmore overwhelming, right?\n\n65\n00:03:28.213 --> 00:03:32.695\nSo this is where inside of your data\ncenter, I'm saying dada center.\n\n66\n00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:35.449\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Data center, [LAUGH] Or data center,\n\n67\n00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.816\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n68\n00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:40.533\nInside of your data center,\nyou might have specializations, right?\n\n69\n00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:42.390\nYou might have networking folks, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.681\nThey absolutely deal with the routers and\nthe switches,\n\n71\n00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.310\nensuring that everything goes\non the way that we need to.\n\n72\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.520\nWe verify the technology is up to date.\n\n73\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.300\nWe have configurations.\n\n74\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.920\nSo, let's say that those might be people\nlike Cisco folks, that may come in and\n\n75\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.750\nhelp us to manage that.\n\n76\n00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.230\nWe now also of course have some\nsecurity specialist that comes in and\n\n77\n00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.660\ndeals with our firewall, and\n\n78\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.860\nof course all the security settings\nthat we have to take in mind.\n\n79\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.700\nWe may of course have Microsoft experts\nthat deal with active directory and\n\n80\n00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.690\nmanaging networks.\n\n81\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.368\nAnd then storage appliance guys that\nreally know how to deal with this idea of\n\n82\n00:04:13.368 --> 00:04:14.630\nthe storage network.\n\n83\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.310\nAnd then of course you have\na facilities manager that\n\n84\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.030\nknows how to deal with all that.\n\n85\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.510\nWhen it comes down to it in\nthe business sense of the world,\n\n86\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.620\nright, when it comes down to a single\nbusiness doing this, this is,\n\n87\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.230\nin the business terms that\nwe have to know about for\n\n88\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.970\nthe VMware 6 exam here,\nis what you call a cost center, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.563\nEverything about this screams cost, right?\n\n90\n00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:43.510\nOkay, you spend a lot of money\non the servers, cost, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.220\nYou buy the technology that hooks\nthem together, the switches, cost.\n\n92\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.380\nThe cabling, cost.\n\n93\n00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.781\nThe air conditioning, the cost.\n\n94\n00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:53.260\nYou name it,\nthis is what they call a cost center.\n\n95\n00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.450\nNow just when you go,\nall right, that's done.\n\n96\n00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.390\nWell, now, remember we talked about the\nsupporting technologies behind it, right?\n\n97\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.830\nThe experts, like Daniel,\nand of course, me.\n\n98\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.391\nNo, I'm joking.\n[LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:02.899\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n100\n00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:04.370\n>> No, the experts, like, Daniel.\n\n101\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.457\nThey come in, and\n\n102\n00:05:05.457 --> 00:05:09.947\nthey also cost to maintain, right?\nMaintenance of these things is of utmost\n\n103\n00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:13.791\nimportance to big organizations.\nNow, Daniel worked for\n\n104\n00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:18.462\na huge insurance company.\nDaniel, maintenance on servers?\n\n105\n00:05:18.462 --> 00:05:19.906\n>> Big time, right?\n\n106\n00:05:19.906 --> 00:05:21.322\nWhen Ronnie said it was costs,\n\n107\n00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:24.293\nhe’s not kidding around.\nDon't forget warranties,\n\n108\n00:05:24.293 --> 00:05:28.652\nbuying new warranties, don't forget\nbacking all that up, I got to have\n\n109\n00:05:28.652 --> 00:05:33.583\na tape system to make sure all that is\nmaking, if something happens, God forbid,\n\n110\n00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:37.320\nI can run to my tape and restore.\nThere's a lot of infrastructure that goes\n\n111\n00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.750\nalong in putting this together.\n\n112\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.240\nNot even to mention the biggest\none we tend to forget,\n\n113\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.790\nit takes electricity to run these things.\n\n114\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.240\nYou got to plug it into\nthe wall somewhere.\n\n115\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.260\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it gets power,\n\n116\n00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.050\nand when you've got rack of 200 servers,\nguess how much power that's taking up?\n\n117\n00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.140\nA lot.\n\n118\n00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.054\nBut that's where one of the main benefits,\nand I'm sure we'll get into that,\n\n119\n00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:55.530\nof virtualization.\n\n120\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.020\n>> That's one of the things that\nwe don't figure out, right?\n\n121\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.750\nIf we're used to working, like I am,\na small guy, that ended up working on\n\n122\n00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.440\nsmall LAN networks, you really don't\nunderstand the overall impact of\n\n123\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.910\na data center until you start breaking it\ndown and realizing, just like Daniel has,\n\n124\n00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.420\ncuz he's worked in the bigger center, is\nrealize how much cost there is involved.\n\n125\n00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.170\nAnd just the idea of servers being in\na single room, and all the stuff that it\n\n126\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.670\nactually takes just to power them on,\nto keep them running 24 hours a day.\n\n127\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.460\nIt takes a lot there.\n\n128\n00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.260\nSo the reason why this is important, is we\nwanna actually make sure that we focus in\n\n129\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.070\non the need then, for\ndata center virtualization, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.250\nSo when we actually start\nthinking about that,\n\n131\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.750\nit really breaks down into multiple areas.\n\n132\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.000\nAnd we're gonna break these down again,\nso let me see if\n\n133\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.290\nI can focus in on this just a little\nbit here, when we do this, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.460\nSo I'm gonna just try\nnot to give everybody\n\n135\n00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.880\nseasickness here as I'm\nmoving my screen around.\n\n136\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.850\nWhen we start taking a look at some of\nthe things that we have to deal with,\n\n137\n00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.930\nokay, one of the big things,\noverwhelmingly,\n\n138\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.710\nthat every center has to deal with is\nwhat is called an infrastructure sprawl.\n\n139\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.160\nNow I want you to make sure that\nyou focus in on that terminology.\n\n140\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.160\nMost of us, we don't think about\nthe term Sprawl, but this actually\n\n141\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.090\nhappens inside of data centers and even\nhappens in virtualization land as well.\n\n142\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.375\nBut when it comes down to it,\n\n143\n00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:21.540\nit's just like the data center that\nI just showed you here, right?\n\n144\n00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.700\nThe very fact is, as this company\ncontinues to grow, there's gonna be what?\n\n145\n00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.150\nMore servers, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.130\nAnd if we actually start another rack,\nthere's probably gonna be more switches\n\n147\n00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.980\nthat actually get attached to that, and\nmaybe even upgraded switches in between at\n\n148\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.570\nthe distribution layer, and\nmaybe even more at the DMZ layer.\n\n149\n00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.960\nAs you start actually thinking about it,\nwhat ends up happening is more and more,\n\n150\n00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.830\nyou actually get more infrastructure,\nand the cost never goes down, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.350\nAnd that's what they mean\nby infrastructure sprawl.\n\n152\n00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.710\nIs that everytime you take a look at it,\nthere's more stuff that actually appears,\n\n153\n00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.580\nand there doesn't seem to be a way to\nactually get rid of anything, right?\n\n154\n00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.265\nAnd so\nwe'd actually had that situation happen.\n\n155\n00:07:59.265 --> 00:08:03.169\nAnd it can happen even inside,\nlike I said, of the virtualization world\n\n156\n00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:07.841\nsometimes, where all of the sudden you're\nlike, why do we have 46 virtual machines\n\n157\n00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:11.810\nrunning, [LAUGH] and no one, actually,\nclaims these virtual machines.\n\n158\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.931\nThey go, I don't know what that's for.\n\n159\n00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:13.551\nIt's just there.\n\n160\n00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.870\nOkay, what's it there for?\n\n161\n00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.650\nAnd, after awhile,\nyou start shitting them down.\n\n162\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.445\n>> Well,\nI log into this virtual machine [LAUGH] so\n\n163\n00:08:19.445 --> 00:08:21.855\nI can remote desktop into\nthat virtual machine.\n\n164\n00:08:21.855 --> 00:08:23.885\nDude why don't you just\nremote desktop directly.\n\n165\n00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:24.945\nBecause that's not the way we do it.\n\n166\n00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:27.815\nThat's the kind of thing\nthat happens a lot.\n\n167\n00:08:27.815 --> 00:08:30.325\n>> Yeah, and you start seeing that\nespecially with hardware though.\n\n168\n00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:33.855\nRight at the beginning, that's one of the\nthings that we actually think about here.\n\n169\n00:08:33.855 --> 00:08:38.580\nIs the very fact that a lot of the budget,\nokay, that we have in terms of maintenance\n\n170\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.170\nhas to do with what we call\nthe infrastructure sprawl idea.\n\n171\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.020\nAnd the reason for that sprawl\nthat ends up happening sometimes,\n\n172\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.450\nreally has to do with what we\ncall these different servers.\n\n173\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.470\nSo most of the server machines\nthat we base ourselves around,\n\n174\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.240\nthe CPU is what we call an X86 CPU.\n\n175\n00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.400\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n176\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.190\nThat means it was designed to\nrun one operating system on that\n\n177\n00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.330\nparticular piece of hardware,\nand that was pretty much it.\n\n178\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.840\nIt wasn't designed for\nvirtualization, and that's the idea.\n\n179\n00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.280\nSo every time you need a new service\nyou tend to add a different server.\n\n180\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.250\nYou tend to add in more\ninfrastructure into the environment.\n\n181\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.490\nNow when stuff like that happens then,\nyou also of course\n\n182\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:21.830\nhave expenses that also go on and so\nwhen you start taking a look at things,\n\n183\n00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.360\none of the big expenses is what we talked\nabout right here at the beginning.\n\n184\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.990\nNow, here is again terminology that\nyou need to be familiar with or\n\n185\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.790\nbecause I was joking with Daniel about\nbefore the show here, is that Daniel,\n\n186\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.550\nwhen is the last time that you actually\nheard me talk about capital expenditures\n\n187\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.710\nand operational expenditures.\n\n188\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.540\nI don't use this terminology\nevery day do I, Daniel?\n\n189\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.160\n>> That's in Ronnie's daily vocabulary.\n\n190\n00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.360\nHe loves those words.\n\n191\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:44.990\nNo, of course not.\n\n192\n00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.580\nWe don't use these terms,\nespecially as tech guy people.\n\n193\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.390\nWe're tech people, we make servers run.\n\n194\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.450\nWe make computers run.\n\n195\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.770\nWe're not all about, but\nwhen you get into the datacenter\n\n196\n00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.890\nlevel environment, these things do\nstart become a part of you because\n\n197\n00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.750\nwe don't have infinite amounts of money.\n\n198\n00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.830\nWe don't have the ability to just\nbuild an environment as we see fit.\n\n199\n00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.380\nWe have to stick with a budget.\n\n200\n00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.370\nAnd that's when words like this do\nstart creeping into our vocabulary.\n\n201\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.450\nSo this is kinda why they want you\nto see how this can benefit you\n\n202\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.292\nmonetarily which is normally where people\nstart to really, okay, well tell me more.\n\n203\n00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:24.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> About this wonderful,\n\n204\n00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.600\nexciting device that you have for me.\n\n205\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.030\nSo, that's why we have to kinda\nbring in into our vocabulary.\n\n206\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.100\n>> It really is, it's one of these\nthings that you'll find out,\n\n207\n00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.050\nespecially as you get toward the exam,\nyou got to know their vocabulary,\n\n208\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.130\nyou gotta know the language VMware likes\nusing these languages because, well,\n\n209\n00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.600\nit actually does hit\nthe impact on decision maker.\n\n210\n00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.980\nAnd that's what it comes down to is\nthat when you're making decisions and\n\n211\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.670\nyou know whether or not you're gonna do\nthis or that, most of the time when you\n\n212\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.670\ngrab people's attentions that are decision\nmakers and when you start talking about,\n\n213\n00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.170\nwell what's you initial layout\nto this data center here.\n\n214\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.790\nAs far as the cost goes, and\nit's usually pretty hot, okay?\n\n215\n00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.466\nSo that front end buying the equipment\nthat you need to form your own first\n\n216\n00:11:02.466 --> 00:11:06.563\ndata center based on your business need is\nwhat we call the capital expenditure at\n\n217\n00:11:06.563 --> 00:11:07.604\nthis point, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:07.604 --> 00:11:12.721\nOr capital expenses, it's usually very,\nvery high is what we also talk about.\n\n219\n00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:16.297\nAnd then what we were mentioning\nearlier as well, is that\n\n220\n00:11:16.297 --> 00:11:21.212\nmost of the actual things that go on as\nfar as the human resource side of things,\n\n221\n00:11:21.212 --> 00:11:25.370\nis also what we call the idea\nof operational expenses as well.\n\n222\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.860\nOkay, the major cost in data center and\noperational expenses is due to operational\n\n223\n00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.730\nexpenses for maintenance, more than\nanything else that we tend to do.\n\n224\n00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.660\nSo when they start talking they say,\nthey usually mention a figure about 70%\n\n225\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.550\nof your operational expense for your data\ncenter has to deal with maintenance.\n\n226\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.300\nNow, imagine that, you're not talking\nabout innovating something new.\n\n227\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.120\nYou're not talking about testing and\ndevelopment.\n\n228\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.920\nYou're not talking about\ndeveloping the business arm.\n\n229\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.490\nYou're just talking about\nmaintaining that data center and\n\n230\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.110\nthat could actually be 70% of your time,\nof your money, of every bit of your\n\n231\n00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.940\neffort, well, that means that you only\nhave 30% to think about innovation and\n\n232\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.001\nthink about reducing costs,\nto think about doing all these others.\n\n233\n00:12:08.001 --> 00:12:09.516\nMost of the time, we're saying,\n\n234\n00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:12.232\nwe just need to make sure that\nthese things are up and running,\n\n235\n00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:16.280\nbecause we are a 24 hour a day shop,\nwe can't afford to let anything go down.\n\n236\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.420\nSo, the idea of this expenditures\nare really heavy and so\n\n237\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.410\nwhen you start thinking about it more and\nmore,\n\n238\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.370\nthat's why we actually we wanna start\nthing about data center virtualization,\n\n239\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.460\nand we're gonna get into this\na little bit more later on.\n\n240\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.990\nBut that's the initial idea that is very\nexpensive to run a physical data center.\n\n241\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:38.650\nThe other thing of course is the now\nwe start talking about availability.\n\n242\n00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.440\nNow we start taking a look at\navailability, this is when applications\n\n243\n00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.060\nneed to be up and running regardless\nof what happens to our data centers.\n\n244\n00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.340\nThat's why we have redundancy, that's\nwhy we have disaster recovery centers,\n\n245\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.640\nthat's why we have a lot of\nstuff that we have going on.\n\n246\n00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.900\nBut in a physical data center,\nyou may have hardware limitations, right?\n\n247\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.630\nThe very fact is that piece of\nhardware might be the only one that is\n\n248\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.780\nstill working.\n\n249\n00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.270\nAnd the only reason you actually\nnoticed it is it went down.\n\n250\n00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.470\nOkay, you didn't have enough time\nto actually check on everything, so\n\n251\n00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.750\nyou don't know if you have\nthe availability that you need.\n\n252\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.540\nAnd that could be it as well.\n\n253\n00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:16.300\nAlso the idea of the time it takes to\nrestart an application that has to come\n\n254\n00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:22.710\nback up that may actually cost you time in\nterms of business and there are companies\n\n255\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.790\nthat absolutely boil it down to like,\nhere's how much it costs each hour run.\n\n256\n00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.010\nHere's how much it costs each\nquarter hour to run, in minutes.\n\n257\n00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.960\nThey actually know that if it's down,\nit's costing them\n\n258\n00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.280\nthis much money; how much money they're\nactually losing, as they're down.\n\n259\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.800\nAnd so, a lot of times, in the physical\nsense; what if we do have a piece of\n\n260\n00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.490\nhardware that's about to fail, and go,\nwe think it'll hold one more day and\n\n261\n00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.090\nit doesn't hold one more day and\nthen you're down.\n\n262\n00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.990\nThat means availability also\nis a big reason, because\n\n263\n00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:56.120\ndata centers as far as the virtualization\nside goes, there's technology there that\n\n264\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.690\ncan help you actually be just\nabout 100% available all the time.\n\n265\n00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:05.050\nAnd of course the idea of\ndisaster recovery is a big one.\n\n266\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.090\nAnd so this is where you\nsee the terminology again,\n\n267\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.290\nthe business continuity.\n\n268\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.080\nI didn't remember the last time I actually\nused the term business continuity except\n\n269\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.610\nin security types of venues overall,\n\n270\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.160\nbut we actually worry about\nthings like this as well.\n\n271\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.240\nSomebody operating a data\ncenter is also a big one.\n\n272\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.680\nDisaster recovery is also technology that\nwe also have to actually worry about and\n\n273\n00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.350\nwhich is very expensive part\nof a data center, right?\n\n274\n00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.060\n>> Yeah, you gonna make sure that,\nI always tell people,\n\n275\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.805\nhow much is your data worth to you.\n\n276\n00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you lost everything today,\n\n277\n00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.550\nif your website went down or\n\n278\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.480\nyour company records were lost,\nwhat would that cost you in dollars?\n\n279\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.410\nIt would cost a lot.\n\n280\n00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.990\nIf you're a web driven company,\nit would cost you just about everything.\n\n281\n00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:49.080\nYou'd be losing all those day's\nprofits for as long as you were down.\n\n282\n00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.730\nSo, keeping that business continuity.\n\n283\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:56.530\nMaking sure that everything is working\naccording to plan is a high priority for\n\n284\n00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.030\njust about anybody associated\nwith the executive level.\n\n285\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.390\nI don't care if it's a small business or\n\n286\n00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.880\na large business, somebody is running the\nstinking company and they care whether or\n\n287\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.510\nnot data is being lost and\nprofits are being lost.\n\n288\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.130\nYou're in business to make money and\nthat's nothing bad.\n\n289\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:10.750\nIt's a good thing.\n\n290\n00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.290\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n291\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.240\nAnd let's do everything we can to\nmake sure that that is happening.\n\n292\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.950\nWhen we use virtualization, it helps\nus have that business continuity, and\n\n293\n00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.220\nit helps us keep that up\ntime as high as possible,\n\n294\n00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.130\nbecause we have a lot\nless points of failure.\n\n295\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:24.970\n>> We really do.\n\n296\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.410\nAnd, the other thing that we also have, of\ncourse, is the way that it tends to work,\n\n297\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.620\nsince you had, actually,\nmentioned a little bit earlier,\n\n298\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.680\nthe idea of a Cloud infrastructure\nis what you're building.\n\n299\n00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.920\nWhich means we can actually have these\nideas of the disaster recovery be\n\n300\n00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.240\nanywhere, it doesn't really matter as\nlong as we actually have access to them.\n\n301\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.290\nSo we have that ability as well.\n\n302\n00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.970\nAlso limited productivity, remember that\na lot of the things that we do inside of\n\n303\n00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.630\na regular physical data center,\nhas to do with management task more than\n\n304\n00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:58.460\nstuff that really might need to get to\nthat can help further our business.\n\n305\n00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.300\nAs well as maintenance.\n\n306\n00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.431\nSo that's a little bit repetitive but\nactually it does work.\n\n307\n00:16:02.431 --> 00:16:05.854\nAnd then of course they're maybe\nlimited responsiveness as well.\n\n308\n00:16:05.854 --> 00:16:10.172\nNow in terms of limited responsiveness,\nthis is where we get into the growing side\n\n309\n00:16:10.172 --> 00:16:13.991\nof business The very fact is we can\nactually have businesses scale out and\n\n310\n00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:15.500\nscale up.\n\n311\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.510\nScale up to meet the business\ndemand that we have.\n\n312\n00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.090\nScale out to actually increase\nthe footprint that we have\n\n313\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.330\nin terms of the marketplace that we have.\n\n314\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.770\nMost of the time,\ncompanies may fail at this, and why?\n\n315\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.120\nCAPEX, very expensive.\n\n316\n00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.740\nAnd then as soon as CAPEX is done,\nwe actually have operational expenses, so,\n\n317\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.910\nyou might realize something.\n\n318\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.390\nYou might be able to actually expand, but\nnot at the rate you need to to keep up\n\n319\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.750\nwith the marketplace, cuz you just don't\nhave enough capital there to help you out.\n\n320\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:45.130\nThe same thing with scaling up to meet\neven more orders at the same time.\n\n321\n00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.390\nYou may, actually, go, look, I need to\norder five more servers tomorrow, and\n\n322\n00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.610\nthey go,\nwe can't build them by tomorrow, and\n\n323\n00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.200\nget them out to you And\nnow it actually delays a little bit.\n\n324\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.380\nSo you may end up finding\nout that on the physical\n\n325\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.330\nside there is a limited responsiveness\nin terms of scalability.\n\n326\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:09.450\nAnd even on the scalability side, right\nwith the, what was the term that use here?\n\n327\n00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:10.640\nThe idea of scaling out and\n\n328\n00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.320\nscaling up, even with that, it's\nfairly slow when you start doing that.\n\n329\n00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.170\nAnd also the other thing is that it\nmay actually not be time sensitive.\n\n330\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.530\nIn other words, you may not be able to\nrespond as quickly as you'd like to\n\n331\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.900\nbecause you just didn't notice it.\n\n332\n00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.490\nAnd why, most of us are just\nhappy that the stuff works.\n\n333\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.325\nOkay, that we're like,\nhey it's working and then tomorrow,\n\n334\n00:17:32.325 --> 00:17:34.385\nyou get an extra 15,000 orders.\n\n335\n00:17:34.385 --> 00:17:38.946\nThat wasn't expected and\nthings like that you don't think about.\n\n336\n00:17:38.946 --> 00:17:42.977\nI know I didn't think about it but\nwhen we actually got into ITProTV and\n\n337\n00:17:42.977 --> 00:17:47.076\nwe start realizing like the very fact\nis that we're a growing company,\n\n338\n00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:50.120\nhey maybe that one web\nserver is not enough.\n\n339\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.830\nAnd so you bring up two and\ngo well maybe we need three and\n\n340\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.710\nthen all of sudden in\n30 minutes you're four.\n\n341\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.617\nWell how do you actually respond that?\n\n342\n00:17:58.617 --> 00:18:03.094\nYou can't just stop every 15, 20 minutes\ngoing I guess I better bring up another\n\n343\n00:18:03.094 --> 00:18:05.700\nserver I guess I better\nbring up another server.\n\n344\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.360\nWell the way that we do it is that we use\na cloud based technology that says look\n\n345\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.925\nwhen more demand we spin up\nservers automatically for you.\n\n346\n00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.050\nWell, the same thing here.\n\n347\n00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.640\nIf you have physical servers,\nyou can't just do that.\n\n348\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.640\nNo, just bring another one online and\nlet it come up.\n\n349\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.290\nBut in a virtualized environment,\nis that possible?\n\n350\n00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:22.910\nHeck, yeah.\n\n351\n00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.780\nStuff like that is possible.\n\n352\n00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.990\nSo that's where we start talking\nabout the need for the data center.\n\n353\n00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.140\nVirtualization technology\nis pretty much out there.\n\n354\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.110\nAnd we want to make sure that we have\nthat in front of us as well, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.840\nSo when it comes down then to\nthe idea of virtualization for\n\n356\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.840\ndata centers,\nwell what is it that we can virtualize?\n\n357\n00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.870\nOkay, well when we take a look,\nokay, we can virtualize servers.\n\n358\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.545\nWe already talked about this as well.\n\n359\n00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:53.640\nVMs are pretty much the key here, and\nwhat we're trying to do, remember,\n\n360\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.420\nis actually the idea of control what we\ncall server sprawl as much as possible.\n\n361\n00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.310\nSo instead of having that single\nutilization, what we wanna\n\n362\n00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.810\ndo is be able to run multiple VMs on one\nphysical host and that actually allows us\n\n363\n00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:10.880\nto actually get better utilization\nout of that one install instead.\n\n364\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.740\nAnd now we're actually doing power\nconsumption because we can run less\n\n365\n00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.520\nmachines, okay, and actually have more\nservers running on that one machine and\n\n366\n00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.280\nactually utilizing it better.\n\n367\n00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.790\nWell that's a great thing all around.\n\n368\n00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:23.900\nMost people,\n\n369\n00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.770\nmost people in the server environment\nwould love to actually say that.\n\n370\n00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:32.680\nWe're actually getting the use of 80, 90,\nmaybe even 100% of our server out there,\n\n371\n00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.570\nrather than saying,\nyeah no I've got eight gigs on it.\n\n372\n00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.960\nBut DCP is only using a gig and a half.\n\n373\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.680\nI mean, that kind of stuff, like why did\nyou actually need a server that big,\n\n374\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.320\nthat's the smallest one that they saw,\nyou're gonna have to go with it.\n\n375\n00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.650\nSo, that's what you actually see.\n\n376\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:55.740\nSo, VMs are really kind of\nthe heart behind what we can,\n\n377\n00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.760\nis really the idea of virtualization, but\n\n378\n00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.510\nbeyond that we of course can actually talk\nabout the idea of storage here, okay?\n\n379\n00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.280\nNow, unlike our traditional storage\nin terms of local storage as far as\n\n380\n00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:07.800\nhard drives go.\n\n381\n00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.391\nWe can still use that but\nwhen we start talking about virtualizing,\n\n382\n00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:13.727\ncan I virtualize\nthe storage on my network?\n\n383\n00:20:13.727 --> 00:20:18.661\nYou better believe it, in data center\nvirtualization, you can actually take\n\n384\n00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:23.460\neven different types of storage devices\nand essentially virtualize them.\n\n385\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.390\nNow remember what we talked about in\nterms of what virtualization means.\n\n386\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.270\nWe take the capacities of those, and\n\n387\n00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.430\nwe essentially represent them in\nsoftware and then the software,\n\n388\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:38.310\nthe VMware software, can actually utilize\nand manage that however they want to.\n\n389\n00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:43.570\nSo regardless of whether you have NASs and\nSANs and iSCSI devices connected in, well,\n\n390\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.970\nin terms of the way you're actually\ngonna see it in the virtualization world\n\n391\n00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.990\nis that it just looks like one\nbig resource capacity pool and\n\n392\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.190\nit can actually utilize\nit however it wants to.\n\n393\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.910\nSo it can turn that around for everything\nand that way you're not saying, well,\n\n394\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.700\nis that technology going\nto meld with this one?\n\n395\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.580\nIs that gonna actually work with this one?\n\n396\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.630\nWell software is software.\n\n397\n00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:03.630\nAnd it actually says,\n\n398\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.990\nlet me resource assign it this way as\njust a storage thing, and it can do it.\n\n399\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.550\nCan you utilize all this technology?\n\n400\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.010\nYou better believe it.\n\n401\n00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.250\nThe stuff that we actually are gonna\ntake a look at in terms of VMware,\n\n402\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.200\nsince that's where our focus is,\nVMware-centric,\n\n403\n00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.270\nwe're gonna see that VMware actually\nallows us to connect to all these devices.\n\n404\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.370\nAnd it says, it's storage, I don't care\nwhether it's SAN, or whether it's NAS, or\n\n405\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.930\nwhether it's iSCSI.\n\n406\n00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.940\nIt's storage and let me handle the way\nthat you wanna actually distribute that\n\n407\n00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.990\nout and we'll do it.\n\n408\n00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.120\nThe nice thing about his type of storage,\nremember that what we're really talking\n\n409\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.310\nabout a lot of times, these are devices\nthat stand on their own not dependent upon\n\n410\n00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.770\nsome other machine standing\nout there as well.\n\n411\n00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.690\nSo we're gonna see that there's technology\nthat helps us to virtualize this.\n\n412\n00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.070\nSo not only do we have\nthe idea of servers and\n\n413\n00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:53.710\nstorage, but even networking\nwe can actually end up doing.\n\n414\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.670\nSo here I have an example of routers and\nswitches\n\n415\n00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.900\neven inside of that virtualization\nmanagement technology for data centers.\n\n416\n00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.070\nYou're gonna see that even all this\nstuff can actually be virtualized.\n\n417\n00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.640\nThere's even what they\ncall a virtual wire, okay,\n\n418\n00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.300\nand that just means it's in software.\n\n419\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.420\nYou just say I'm connecting to this\ndevice, I'm connecting to this device,\n\n420\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.950\ndo I have to actually physically go and\nplug it in?\n\n421\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.610\nNo, okay, but inside of that software,\nyou can do it, okay.\n\n422\n00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.310\nThe nice thing about virtualizing\nthe software is that it\n\n423\n00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.940\ndoes help to eliminate a lot of clutter.\n\n424\n00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:29.140\nImagine and, actually I can tell Daniel,\nour server closet here,\n\n425\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.530\nI worked on it from the very beginning and\nit just, over time, any server closet,\n\n426\n00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.670\nit is not managed daily,\nyou're gonna end up seeing what?\n\n427\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.330\nSpaghetti wire everywhere.\n\n428\n00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.240\n>> They look crazy.\n\n429\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.450\nI've been in employee data centers and\njust about every one you go into,\n\n430\n00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.640\nthey look like some madman was in there\njust plugging cables in at random.\n\n431\n00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.910\nYou're like there's no way\nany of this works, but\n\n432\n00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.080\nit does because it tends to grow.\n\n433\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.690\nYou start off, everything looked\nbeautiful, it's nice and organized and\n\n434\n00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.040\nafter six months it just\nlooks like spaghetti.\n\n435\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n436\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.230\nthat's one of the things we\nwant to get rid of as well.\n\n437\n00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.762\nThe ability to say, hey look, we're\nreducing the number of cables [CROSSTALK]\n\n438\n00:23:04.762 --> 00:23:05.786\n>> Which you have to buy.\n\n439\n00:23:05.786 --> 00:23:07.220\n>> Which you do have to buy.\n\n440\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.120\nAnd then you actually have\nto be able to manage,\n\n441\n00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.060\nyou have to be able to run, you name it.\n\n442\n00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.080\nThere's a ton of different\nthings dealing with that.\n\n443\n00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.270\nAs well as the switching\nthat's actually involved, too.\n\n444\n00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.490\nNow the nice thing about\nvirtualizing things like switching,\n\n445\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.790\nis that there's actually different\nways that you can actually do this.\n\n446\n00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.370\nThey literally can pull together\nthe networking resources, again.\n\n447\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.710\nAnd actually create what they\ncall a distributed switch.\n\n448\n00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.600\nMultiple switches that, again, they can\nactually say, let me just re-assign it\n\n449\n00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.950\nhow I want to re-assign it and make it\nwork the way that I need to make it work.\n\n450\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.520\nIt is amazing about how much\nmore control that you can have.\n\n451\n00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.700\nNow you might be saying,\nwell, do I really need that?\n\n452\n00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.074\nWell it depends on what you really need,\nbut\n\n453\n00:23:46.074 --> 00:23:49.490\noverall though you don't need\nanother specialist to do it.\n\n454\n00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:54.430\nYou need somebody who understands VMware,\nin their management capabilities.\n\n455\n00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.969\nBut, it means you really don't have to\ngo out and hire that Cisco expert if\n\n456\n00:23:57.969 --> 00:24:00.878\nyou don't want to, to come in and\nhelp you out a lot of times,\n\n457\n00:24:00.878 --> 00:24:03.931\nif you can also trust that it's\nactually going to be out there.\n\n458\n00:24:03.931 --> 00:24:07.749\nAnd of course, lastly, there's a couple\nof other things then at the end user\n\n459\n00:24:07.749 --> 00:24:12.118\nside that you're gonna see or that they'll\nnever notice which is also good too, okay?\n\n460\n00:24:12.118 --> 00:24:15.011\nRemember that regular desktop computers,\nright.\n\n461\n00:24:15.011 --> 00:24:19.222\nUsually companies end up replacing them\non a life cycle basis like every three\n\n462\n00:24:19.222 --> 00:24:19.952\nyears or so.\n\n463\n00:24:19.952 --> 00:24:22.870\nI know The Department of Defense it\ndoesn't matter if that computer's been\n\n464\n00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:23.960\nsitting there for two years,\n\n465\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.400\nnobody's been sitting at it,\nthey'll replace it in that third year.\n\n466\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.650\nYeah, it’s gone.\n\n467\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.680\nEvery three years they get a new one.\n\n468\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.520\nNot every company will do that.\n\n469\n00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.560\nThe companies that do that,\nwhat do they realize?\n\n470\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.200\nIndividual PCs, right?\n\n471\n00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.220\nThey're gonna continue to actually have\nbetter processors, more RAM, more storage,\n\n472\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.620\nwhich means cost is gonna continue\nto actually rise at some point here.\n\n473\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:49.050\nAnd so everybody actually has stuff\nlike that, but the ones that don't,\n\n474\n00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:52.790\nwhat ends up happening is newer\napplications demand higher resources.\n\n475\n00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.670\nWell, how you deal with stuff like that?\n\n476\n00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.120\nWell, you end up buying people new PCs\nafter you bought this new application.\n\n477\n00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.390\nWell, instead, right, being able to\nvirtualize what we call desktops, turns us\n\n478\n00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:07.460\ninto more of a terminal server environment\nwhich is actually a good thing but\n\n479\n00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.650\nit allows people to have their own\nindividual desktops, it's virtualized.\n\n480\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.160\nThe nice thing about the virtualization\nis that, that desktop believes what?\n\n481\n00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.850\nIt's running on a server hardware.\n\n482\n00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:20.460\nIt's got the quad core with the,\nyou know, processor in it.\n\n483\n00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.730\nYou know, it's got two gigs of RAM,\nevery single machine,\n\n484\n00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.640\nwhatever you actually want.\n\n485\n00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.260\nBeing able to do that ensures that\nthat application is going to run\n\n486\n00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.860\nat the efficiency that it\nbelieves it needs to run at.\n\n487\n00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.770\nIt's going to be able\nto do that very well.\n\n488\n00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.980\n>> And Ronnie, I've actually used this\nto leverage to get rid of viruses.\n\n489\n00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.060\n>> Yeah.\n>> My users, they will download a virus.\n\n490\n00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.550\nThey love to get malware\non their computers.\n\n491\n00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.400\nSo, what we did, we said,\nwell, you know what?\n\n492\n00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.160\nYou're gonna log into\nthese thin terminals,\n\n493\n00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.020\nand you'll get a virtualized desktop.\n\n494\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.884\nAnd every time you log in, it gives\nyou just your business applications.\n\n495\n00:25:49.884 --> 00:25:50.726\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n496\n00:25:50.726 --> 00:25:52.990\nyou can download every virus known to man.\n\n497\n00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.770\nAs soon as you reboot,\nyou get a clean slate.\n\n498\n00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.360\nEverything's gone.\n\n499\n00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.840\nYou don't have to worry about anything.\n\n500\n00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.440\nVirus cleanup becomes a thing of the past.\n\n501\n00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.530\n>> It really is kind of amazing when\nyou start thinking about some of\n\n502\n00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.370\nthe things that it can do.\n\n503\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.820\nAnd then, of course, just regular\napplications that are also out there just\n\n504\n00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.600\nlike what Daniel was talking about.\n\n505\n00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.550\nEnsures the application runs at\nthe performance level that's needed.\n\n506\n00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.110\nEnsures that people actually have\nthe desktop environment that they need,\n\n507\n00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.650\nwithout really having to worry\nabout too much of whether or\n\n508\n00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:21.640\nnot their physical hardware can handle it,\nand whatever we have in place.\n\n509\n00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.840\nSo, when you start taking that,\n\n510\n00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:28.392\nthat's actually what you can virtualize in\nthe world of data center virtualization.\n\n511\n00:26:28.392 --> 00:26:31.550\nNow, when you start saying,\nhow the heck do we do that?\n\n512\n00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:35.330\nWell, there's a few products that\nwe are going to become more and\n\n513\n00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.390\nmore familiar with in the realm of VMware.\n\n514\n00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:41.810\nI just want to make sure that I have\nactually white text on a black background\n\n515\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.600\nto help us out here.\n\n516\n00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.390\nSo VMware.\n\n517\n00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.100\nLet's talk about just a few and we're\njust gonna mention them now cuz we're\n\n518\n00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.640\ngonna go through these, so I just wanna\nmake sure that I list them out for us.\n\n519\n00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.800\nVMware, I'll call it technologies, that\nwe're gonna be familiar with here for DCV.\n\n520\n00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.350\nDVC [LAUGH].\n\n521\n00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.210\nOkay, so we'll go ahead and talk about it.\n\n522\n00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:09.040\nThe first one, of course,\nis gonna be the basic hypervisor and\n\n523\n00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.620\nis called ESXi Hypervisor.\n\n524\n00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.980\nMaybe it is, if I could actually spell\nit instead of deleting it out there.\n\n525\n00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.320\nHypervisor.\n\n526\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.990\nSo this is the basic one that allows\nus to essentially create VMs..\n\n527\n00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.800\nOkay is what we had the ability to do.\n\n528\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.820\nAnd so this hypervisor is one we're\ngonna get into a little bit later on but\n\n529\n00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.770\nwe'll show a little bit of it.\n\n530\n00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.430\nSo here is the basic technology\nthat everything is built off of\n\n531\n00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.350\nas far as the virtualization goes.\n\n532\n00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:46.280\nNow the other thing that we also are gonna\nbecome a little bit more familiar\n\n533\n00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.990\nwith is kinda the heart and\ncenter of all the management stuff and\n\n534\n00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.290\nit's called vCenter Server.\n\n535\n00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.950\nSo, this is what actually allows\nus to start managing well,\n\n536\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.920\nthings like the actual\nservers that are on ESX.\n\n537\n00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.812\nIt will also give us the ability to manage\nall those other things that we talked in\n\n538\n00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:10.140\ndata center virtualization, as well.\n\n539\n00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.230\nThe resources, the networking,\nand stuff like that.\n\n540\n00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:17.380\nThis is the kind of heart and\ncenter of what we take a look at.\n\n541\n00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:21.460\nSo it is actually kinda the interface\nbetween the hypervisor and\n\n542\n00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.980\nalso us, as well.\n\n543\n00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.140\nSo we're actually going to see\nthat one just briefly here.\n\n544\n00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.790\nBut how do we manage that\nparticular piece there too?\n\n545\n00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:37.710\nWell, really what we're going to be\nfocusing the majority of our time in\n\n546\n00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.940\nis going to be the main product here.\n\n547\n00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:46.290\nWhich is gonna be VMware,\nvSphere, okay, 6.0, okay.\n\n548\n00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.630\nAnd this is kinda the latest edition.\n\n549\n00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.570\nThat's why the exam focus\nitself is called VCA 6,\n\n550\n00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.740\nis because it focuses in on vSphere.\n\n551\n00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:00.360\nvSphere is a suite of technologies\nthat allow us to actually send command\n\n552\n00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.470\nmessages through to the vCenter which then\ncan of course influence the hypervisor and\n\n553\n00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.460\nactually manage all\nthese other components.\n\n554\n00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.340\nThis is the largest component\nthat we will tend to deal with\n\n555\n00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.150\nwhich is gonna be right here.\n\n556\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.860\nSo the main focus of what\nwe'll be doing pretty much for\n\n557\n00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:19.280\nthe remainder of the shows is really gonna\nfocus in in getting more familiar with\n\n558\n00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:24.860\nvSphere and its particular\napplications that we'll also see.\n\n559\n00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:32.120\nAnd then we'll also take a look at\nsomething that is called vRealize Suite.\n\n560\n00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.230\nNow you may, if you've actually been\nfamiliar with VMware for a while,\n\n561\n00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:45.531\nthis is actually the newer form of what\nthey called vCenter Ops, Operations.\n\n562\n00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:49.360\nOkay?\n\n563\n00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.220\nSo if you actually heard\nthe term vCenter Operations,\n\n564\n00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.340\nthey've now changed it to vRealize.\n\n565\n00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.780\nThis is actually more of the direct\nway that it actually does\n\n566\n00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.480\nintegrate the things that\nwe really want to do.\n\n567\n00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.100\nAnd so a lot of the operations management\ncomes through here in the vRealize Suite,\n\n568\n00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.180\nand there's of course\ndifferent editions of this.\n\n569\n00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.170\nAnd you'll see the same\nthing with vSphere.\n\n570\n00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.270\nThere's a standard, there's enterprise,\nthere's enterprise plus.\n\n571\n00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:18.390\nAnd we'll get access all into everything\nelse that we have available there.\n\n572\n00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.200\nBut when it comes down to it,\n\n573\n00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.960\nthat's pretty much the actual technology\nthat we're going to take a look at.\n\n574\n00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.220\nWe'll really spend the majority of\nour time here in vSphere 6.0 and\n\n575\n00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:33.000\nwe'll probably spend a little bit of time\ntaking a look at the vRealize Suite, but\n\n576\n00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.380\nthere's actually other things\nthat you actually see.\n\n577\n00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.740\nInside of vSphere you'll\nsee that there's product\n\n578\n00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.260\nmanagement types of services\nthat are out there.\n\n579\n00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:47.400\nResource management, schedulers,\nyou name it, storage management, vMotion.\n\n580\n00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.105\nThere's a ton of different things that\nthis series is gonna take us through at\n\n581\n00:30:51.105 --> 00:30:54.929\nleast being able to understand what they\ndo and what they're gonna focus in on.\n\n582\n00:30:54.929 --> 00:30:57.629\nSo the good thing is we've\nactually gone through a lot of\n\n583\n00:30:57.629 --> 00:31:00.690\nthe fundamentals here as\nfar as the very beginnings.\n\n584\n00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:04.500\nAnd that means that we're actually going\nto be ready as we actually move on through\n\n585\n00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:09.100\na new episode here,\nwhere we'll probably jump right into\n\n586\n00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.250\nsome of these different ones,\ntake a look at them much closer.\n\n587\n00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.080\n>> Ronnie, it's exciting to play\naround with new technologies and\n\n588\n00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:20.120\nI'm excited to see what we've got\ncoming up in a more ESX or more VMware.\n\n589\n00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.200\nVMware's got some really cool products.\n\n590\n00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.520\nI've worked with them for quite some time,\nfor quite a few years now, and\n\n591\n00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.730\nthey never fail to impress me with\nthe stuff that they throw out there.\n\n592\n00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.920\nI can't wait to see what\nyou got on deck for us.\n\n593\n00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.190\nAnd to learn a little bit more\nabout how virtualization can\n\n594\n00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:35.790\nhelp us in our environments.\n\n595\n00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.636\nRonnie, is there anything else that\nwe need to add to this episode\n\n596\n00:31:37.636 --> 00:31:38.530\nbefore we wrap it up?\n\n597\n00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.670\n>> Not really, right.\n\n598\n00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.740\nThe very fact is,\nthis finishes up kind of the review and\n\n599\n00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.520\nhopefully sets us up for what you're\nactually going to be seeing and\n\n600\n00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.940\nwhat you're going to need to be focusing\nin on as you prepare for the exam.\n\n601\n00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.550\nThe first two episodes if\nyou now have actually said,\n\n602\n00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.810\nI don't know if I really need them.\n\n603\n00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.930\nThat's fine, if you're familiar\nwith virtualization technology, but\n\n604\n00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.540\nthe very fact is review\nis always a good thing.\n\n605\n00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.900\nAnd some of the terminology in there, make\nsure you pay attention to terminology.\n\n606\n00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.670\nIf you know about it and\n\n607\n00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.670\nyou go, I've never used that term before,\nthere's a reason why we're mentioning it.\n\n608\n00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.210\nSo pay attention to terminology\nif you're familiar with it,\n\n609\n00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.110\nbecause we're actually going to start\nputting a v in front of everything that\n\n610\n00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.930\nwe actually end up doing here for\nthis episode.\n\n611\n00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.000\nBut you'll see.\nWe'll go over a high level view of it and\n\n612\n00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.690\nwe'll show what we can show you.\n\n613\n00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:24.870\nSo that way you have at least a little bit\nof a familiarity with the interface of\n\n614\n00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.530\nwhat you'll see and we'll talk, of course,\nabout what the features are, and\n\n615\n00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.890\nthe benefits to using it, and why we\nwould choose to use that technology.\n\n616\n00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.790\nSo we're gonna be seeing all\nthat in the next few episodes.\n\n617\n00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:36.500\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n618\n00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.950\nThanks for the VMware education so far.\n\n619\n00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.850\nAnd we are definitely going to\nbe on the edge of our seats when\n\n620\n00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.880\nit comes to the rest of what\nyou have to show for us.\n\n621\n00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.910\nThat being said,\nwe have wrapped up this great episode.\n\n622\n00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.250\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it,\nmaybe learned a little something,\n\n623\n00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.950\nand we'll see you in the next episode.\n\n624\n00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:52.910\nAs for this one,\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n625\n00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.830\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n626\n00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:56.610\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n627\n00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.353\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n628\n00:32:58.353 --> 00:33:06.370\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTv,\n\n3\n00:00:16.508 --> 00:00:18.200\nI'm your host Daniel Larry.\n\n4\n00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.890\nAnd today’s episode we're continuing\nforward with our VCA series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.430\nJoining me back in the studios again today\nto help us out with that very endeavor,\n\n6\n00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.740\nis our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.710\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.690\nHow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.590\n>> It's going great today, it's another\nbeautiful day to be right here in\n\n10\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.310\nthe studio as we continue to\ntake a look at the VCA-6.\n\n11\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.840\nRemember that's\nVMWare Certified Associate Version 6.\n\n12\n00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.720\nAnd what we're actually taking look\nat today of course is, well some of\n\n13\n00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.470\nthe benefits that we have when we talk\nabout doing data center virtualization.\n\n14\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.950\nA lot of times when somebody actually\nasks, if they haven't been dealing in\n\n15\n00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.120\nthe area of virtualization, they may\nunderstand the concept of virtualizing and\n\n16\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.530\nsaying hey, here is something that\nmy companies doing and my god,\n\n17\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040\nwe don't see where that fits in for us.\n\n18\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.260\nAnd it's not that they\ncan't see it working, but\n\n19\n00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.870\nwhat they don't understand is that\nthere's actually benefits to doing it.\n\n20\n00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.860\nAnd that's what we need to understand,\nwhat are the benefits,\n\n21\n00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.410\nwhy in the world would we choose something\nlike actually data center virtualization\n\n22\n00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.200\nwhen I don't really actually\nsee any real need for it.\n\n23\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.960\nAnd the reason why is that there is\nactually overwhelming benefit to doing it.\n\n24\n00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.010\nNow we've already mentioned\nin a couple of other shows,\n\n25\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.800\nespecially as we've been reviewing\nsome of the virtualization concepts.\n\n26\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.780\nBut we wanna actually take a look a little\nbit more at the business side of this, and\n\n27\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.180\ntalk about some of those\ndifferent types of benefits\n\n28\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.790\nthat we can actually\nstart to take a look at.\n\n29\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.410\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at my\nscreen here as we kinda get reminded of\n\n30\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.580\nwhat we're really dealing with here.\n\n31\n00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.545\nThe very fact is when we talk\nabout a physical data center,\n\n32\n00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:50.820\nremember that there's a ton of\ndifferent physical components\n\n33\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.760\nthat we have to be able to manage if\nwe're gonna be running a data center.\n\n34\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.320\nAnd this includes not only the servers but\nof course switches, routers,\n\n35\n00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.700\nfirewalls, and of course multiple servers,\ncabling, you name it.\n\n36\n00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.370\nAnd then that doesn't even include them\nthings that we haven't really mentioned\n\n37\n00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.380\nas far as the data center itself.\n\n38\n00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.345\nWhich is normally of course\nthe housing of the building.\n\n39\n00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:11.630\nHow much floor space that we need.\n\n40\n00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.930\nHow much air conditioning\ndo we need to actually run.\n\n41\n00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.060\nHow much electricity do we need to\nbring into the building to support\n\n42\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.660\neverything that we want to\nactually be able to run.\n\n43\n00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.680\nThere's a lot that goes into\nthe cost of the data center itself.\n\n44\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.630\n>> You know it's funny Ronnie,\n\n45\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.070\nback in the day a single\ncomputer took up a whole room.\n\n46\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.970\nAnd now we have a whole room filled\nup with a bunch of computers.\n\n47\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.590\nSo it's not like the data\ncenter has really shrunk,\n\n48\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.580\nit's just that we are now able to\nput more of them in the same room.\n\n49\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.620\n>> Yeah, it's amazing right, because of\nthe way that data continues to grow and\n\n50\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.010\ngrow and grow.\n\n51\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.120\nAnd, you hate to say this,\nit's like house in this point.\n\n52\n00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.530\nYou might have started off where you go\nyou know, we've only really have three\n\n53\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.240\nrooms that we have to fill with furniture\nand we have an extra bedroom, right.\n\n54\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.952\nAll the sudden, that extra bedroom,\nyou go and open the door one day and\n\n55\n00:02:54.952 --> 00:02:57.750\nit's jam-packed full of stuff, and\nyou're like, what in the world happened?\n\n56\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.940\nAnd it all actually just takes space and\nit begins to fill up.\n\n57\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.900\nAnd we started seeing that particular\nidea, again, in the physical data center.\n\n58\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.220\nWhen we talked about in terms of what we\ncalled the idea of infrastructure sprawl.\n\n59\n00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.390\nWe have space, we have a need,\nwell, do we wanna try and\n\n60\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.630\nreconfigure everything that we have so\nthat we're much more efficient.\n\n61\n00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.400\nOr is it easier just to buy a new one,\nput it in place, you're just adding\n\n62\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.000\nan addition to it and go, no, we have room\nthat we can actually make right here and\n\n63\n00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.038\nwe'll just plug that in and\nwe're off and ready to go.\n\n64\n00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:31.780\nSo it continues to stack up and\nadd up the way that we want to.\n\n65\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.725\n>> It's like cell division.\n\n66\n00:03:32.725 --> 00:03:33.500\n[LAUGH] It's very crazy.\n\n67\n00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.340\n>> It really does seem to actually work\nthat way in terms of the way that we do\n\n68\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.730\ninfrastructure.\n\n69\n00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.380\nAnd you might be wondering well,\nwhy do we do stuff like that?\n\n70\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.010\nWell, a lot of that is because we\nactually designed that data center\n\n71\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.820\nto actually be available\nas often as we can.\n\n72\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.035\nIn other words, we talked about\nthe idea of high availability.\n\n73\n00:03:51.035 --> 00:03:54.535\n24 hours a day we want our data\nto be ready and available.\n\n74\n00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:58.759\nWe want to make sure that\nthere's redundancy here,\n\n75\n00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:03.944\njust in case one machine fails,\nwe have another one ready to go.\n\n76\n00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:06.985\nWe actually start building\nall that stuff into it.\n\n77\n00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:10.035\nAnd we actually end up finding out that\nhey that's what ends up happening is this\n\n78\n00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:11.275\nidea sprawl.\n\n79\n00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:14.330\nWe just continued to actually\nhave more and more stuff but\n\n80\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.100\nis our capability really growing.\n\n81\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.830\nIs everything that we're actually doing\nreally a benefit to our business?\n\n82\n00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.680\nNot really.\n\n83\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.810\nWe've also taken a look that the very\nfact is a lot of this stuff becomes for\n\n84\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.200\nour business what we call a cost center.\n\n85\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.270\nAnd what we want to do is,\n\n86\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.790\nwe want to actually take a look at that\nidea again and start moving at more\n\n87\n00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.648\ntowards what we call an idea of a data\ncenter as being a service center instead.\n\n88\n00:04:38.648 --> 00:04:40.390\nIn other words,\none that actually does stuff for\n\n89\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.820\nour business that really does count\ninstead of just taking the cost.\n\n90\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.520\nDon't get me wrong, without it\nbeing here there's no doubt that we\n\n91\n00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.640\ncouldn't do the functions that we can do,\nbut\n\n92\n00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.740\nwhat if we actually had it optimize to\nwhere we're spending the majority of\n\n93\n00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.010\nthe time really doing the service instead\nof actually doing the maintenance\n\n94\n00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.770\nto the beast that we've actually\ncreated here in this data center idea.\n\n95\n00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.428\nSo that's what we're talking\nabout in terms of benefits.\n\n96\n00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:06.990\nSo we wanna just do a quick\nreminder here in this episode,\n\n97\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.510\nof some of those different benefits of\nwhy we would choose to actually bring up\n\n98\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.370\nthe idea of data center virtualization,\neither to those that are actually working\n\n99\n00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.380\nabove us when they say okay, so\nwhy would I choose to actually do this?\n\n100\n00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.693\nWell, we wanna make sure that you actually\nunderstand why you would choose to do\n\n101\n00:05:22.693 --> 00:05:24.328\nthat, and\nthat's what we're gonna go through today.\n\n102\n00:05:24.328 --> 00:05:27.477\n>> That's exactly right there are many,\nmany, many, many,\n\n103\n00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:29.800\nmany benefits to go into virtualizations.\n\n104\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.850\nI've seen them first hand,\nI've worked with them.\n\n105\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.410\nBecause as we've already hinted at, it's\nthe whole idea of sprawl and just servers\n\n106\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.868\ntend to start duplicating themselves\ninside instead of our data center.\n\n107\n00:05:41.868 --> 00:05:46.220\nI liken it to the fact that if\nI'm a user and I drive a car.\n\n108\n00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.270\nI have a car, I need to go to the store,\n\n109\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.010\nwell in IT world we tend to go well, I\nhave a car for going to the grocery store,\n\n110\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.070\nand I have a car for\ngoing to the clothing store.\n\n111\n00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.110\nI've got a car for\ngoing to get frozen yogurt.\n\n112\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.300\nAnd we have all these different cars,\nwhen really one car would suffice,\n\n113\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.610\nas long as it could go to\nall those different places.\n\n114\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.230\nAnd that's our idea that we're really\nthinking about when it comes to\n\n115\n00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.610\nwhere we wanna start,\nwhich is that server consolidation.\n\n116\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.750\nBring it down to having only\nwhat you need instead of having\n\n117\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.540\na bunch of servers that can do these\nthings, we can pair this down.\n\n118\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.650\nThis is the idea, right Ronnie?\n\n119\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.170\n>> It really is.\n\n120\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.190\nSo let's start off with that very\nidea of server consolidation.\n\n121\n00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.010\nCuz sometimes people don't\nunderstand that when we talk about\n\n122\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.520\nthe idea of server consolidation.\n\n123\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.210\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n124\n00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.410\nHopefully this visual will help us to\nunderstand it a little bit better.\n\n125\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.360\nSo if somebody says hey,\nwhat is this about server consolidation,\n\n126\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.880\nhow does virtualization\nreally help us out here?\n\n127\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.620\nWell, what we can do is let's say\nwe have five servers running and\n\n128\n00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.200\neach of them are actually\nrunning their separate roles.\n\n129\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.030\nLet's say that one's a domain controller,\none's DHCP server, one's an actual\n\n130\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.750\nDNS server, one's a file server, email\nserver, whatever you want to call it.\n\n131\n00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.560\nSo we have those different roles\nthat are actually running.\n\n132\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.790\nWhen we take a look at the utilization,\nyou go in there if your running,\n\n133\n00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.180\nlet's say Windows Server\n2012 in the background.\n\n134\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.900\nYou right click on the taskbar, you go and\nyou bring up of course the task manager.\n\n135\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.560\nYou take a look at CPU utilization\non your Domain Controller,\n\n136\n00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.090\nand you go wow,\nthe CPU looks like it's running at 6%.\n\n137\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.450\nI got 8 gigs of ram,\nI'm running at 2 gigs of ram.\n\n138\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.910\nAnd you start realizing that that gigantic\nterabyte hard drive that you actually had\n\n139\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.450\ninstalled in there, you're taking up let's\nsay, I'm gonna go ahead and be generous.\n\n140\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.670\nLet's say that we're gonna\ntake up 300 gigs on it.\n\n141\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.440\nThat'd be pretty gigantic.\n\n142\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.268\nBut, let's say that we\nactually do have that many and\n\n143\n00:07:33.268 --> 00:07:37.330\nit's 300 gigs, what about the rest\nof the resources that are available.\n\n144\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.820\nWell, that's where we actually\nstart running into issues.\n\n145\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.745\nIn terms of server consolidations instead,\nwhat I hope you can actually see,\n\n146\n00:07:44.745 --> 00:07:48.475\nis that you might actually put\nmoney into one fairly beefy,\n\n147\n00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:52.373\nfairly high performance server instead,\nphysical server.\n\n148\n00:07:52.373 --> 00:07:55.733\nGet up all the RAM that you actually want,\nbut\n\n149\n00:07:55.733 --> 00:08:00.430\nthen you can run individual VMs\ninside of that server instead.\n\n150\n00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.320\nAnd now what you have is actually\ninstead of five physical servers,\n\n151\n00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.480\nyou have five VMs.\n\n152\n00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.720\nIn other words, five virtual machine\nservers that can really actually highly\n\n153\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.480\noptimize the utilization of\nthat one physical machine.\n\n154\n00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.990\nNow, does it always have to be one?\n\n155\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.130\nNo, you can actually spread it out and\ncluster it out if you want to, but\n\n156\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.830\nthe very fact is this is something\nthat can actually be done and\n\n157\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.910\nwhen you start doing stuff like this.\n\n158\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.450\nThe very fact is, we eliminate what we\ncall the idea of server over provisioning,\n\n159\n00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.260\nwhich is what normally happens here.\n\n160\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.940\nAnd the way that Daniel was talking about\nit, and it's one of these situations.\n\n161\n00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:39.050\nDaniel, if a couple of years ago,\nI remember doing this is that I went to\n\n162\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.170\na place to help set up\nsome infrastructure and\n\n163\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:46.290\nthere was a server that was just turned on\nand only one person was actually using it.\n\n164\n00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.430\nAnd when I went to them,\nI said hey what is this for?\n\n165\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.310\nAnd they said it's a data base,\nit's an old data base, but\n\n166\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.430\nit's a data base that we still need up and\nrunning.\n\n167\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.630\nAnd so I said let's go ahead and\nback this thing up and\n\n168\n00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.710\nwe can restore the data base onto\nsomething else if we need to.\n\n169\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.990\nWell, they said they've already done that.\n\n170\n00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.780\nWhich was a little bit unusual that\nthey had actually went ahead and\n\n171\n00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.840\nbacked it up, and\nthey moved it off to a new server.\n\n172\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.250\nBut I remember looking in the rack and\nit was still on.\n\n173\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.250\nIt was still turned on.\n\n174\n00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.850\nIt was still just sitting there.\n\n175\n00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.930\nWell, imagine that,\nwe talk about over provisioning.\n\n176\n00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.180\nWell, we over provisioned.\n\n177\n00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.130\nAnd they were saying, well, that's just\nin case that during the testing time,\n\n178\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.020\nthat something happened to the new server.\n\n179\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.950\nAnd so what did they do?\n\n180\n00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.600\nThey just left it on.\n\n181\n00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.170\nAnd what happened?\n\n182\n00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.470\nIt got forgotten about.\n\n183\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.080\nIt's just been sitting there for\na couple years.\n\n184\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.040\nNobody even bothered to look and go you\nknow, we may just turn this thing off.\n\n185\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.080\nSo they were way over provision on a lot\nof different things that they had.\n\n186\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.210\nAnd so simply I said,\nit looks like we don't really need it.\n\n187\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.330\nNo, I need it.\n\n188\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.170\nSo what did I do?\n\n189\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.690\nI unhooked it from the network\n[LAUGH] is what I did.\n\n190\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And just said well, we'll just leave it\n\n191\n00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.690\nalone then and I just told them no big\ndeal, but we tend to over provisionalize\n\n192\n00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.960\nand by doing virtualization,\nwe eliminate that idea of over provision.\n\n193\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.710\nWhen we do so, we end up reducing the\nnumber of physical servers that we need.\n\n194\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:03.530\nWhich also mean what?\n\n195\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.690\nReduction in electricity, reduction\nin terms of cost that we have and-\n\n196\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.600\n>> Just actually maintenance.\n\n197\n00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.290\n>> Maintenance.\n\n198\n00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.170\n>> Yeah, maintenance in general.\n\n199\n00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.960\nI've actually been a part of this, right?\n\n200\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.090\nA company I worked for,\nwe had about a hundred servers.\n\n201\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.530\nAnd then we went to virtualization.\n\n202\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.080\nActually we went to ESX VMware, and\nwe went down to about 30 servers, right?\n\n203\n00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.364\nWe bought, just like what Ronnie said,\n\n204\n00:10:24.364 --> 00:10:29.064\nwe got some really high end horse powered\nbeefy servers and stuck them in there, and\n\n205\n00:10:29.064 --> 00:10:33.170\nthat took the vast majority of our\nphysical servers out of the loop.\n\n206\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.370\nThere were a few that still hung around\nbecause they needed some dedicated\n\n207\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.240\nhardware, but for\n\n208\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.110\neverything else that didn't, we threw\nthem on those servers, ran like a charm.\n\n209\n00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.010\nIt was amazing how that worked out.\n\n210\n00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.060\nWent from having five racks to two.\n\n211\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.022\nIt was a whole lot nicer.\n\n212\n00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:50.960\n>> Yes Dan, even in VMware, VMware itself\nactually says, when you actually go from\n\n213\n00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.110\nthe physical down to actually using\nthe idea of virtual machines,\n\n214\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:00.130\nmost companies end up seeing anywhere\nof a utilization of that one server.\n\n215\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:05.060\nWhich normally rides let's say about\n15% to 20% all the way up to 80% and\n\n216\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.820\neven higher of that one server.\n\n217\n00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.950\nSo notice that we are,\nwe are increasing it by almost four or\n\n218\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.400\nfive fold when we think about\nthis idea of actual utilization.\n\n219\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.910\nSo server consolidation is one of the big\nbenefits that we have when we start\n\n220\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.890\nconsidering the idea of actually moving\ntoward our data center virtualization.\n\n221\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:24.430\nWhy?\n\n222\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.171\nIt's because we actually start reducing\nthat sprawl just very easily and\n\n223\n00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:30.250\nwe actually start upgrading it.\n\n224\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.280\nThe very first one I dealt with\nwe had eight different servers,\n\n225\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.030\nwe actually ended up buying two just two\nservers that we actually replaced and\n\n226\n00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.030\nwe started virtualizing everything else.\n\n227\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.380\nWell imagine that energy consumption for\na small company going from eight machines\n\n228\n00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:49.370\nthat are running with dual power\nsupplies all the time to two servers.\n\n229\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.950\nAnd we actually had better\nperformance because\n\n230\n00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.790\nwe also ended up upgrading\nthe actual equipment.\n\n231\n00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.240\nWe had better nits,\nthe network was actually running better.\n\n232\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.384\nInstead of the older stuff that we kept\naround because we didn't know what else to\n\n233\n00:12:01.384 --> 00:12:04.060\ndo, and we just kept relying\non those things to work.\n\n234\n00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.254\nSo that was kind of one of those first\ninstances, but server consolidation by\n\n235\n00:12:08.254 --> 00:12:11.880\nfar is one of the big ones that we\nhave to think about as well, okay?\n\n236\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.110\nNow the other benefit that\nwe also want to move to,\n\n237\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.880\nespecially when you starting\ntalking about data virtualization,\n\n238\n00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.850\nis that we start to take a look,\nor data center virtualization,\n\n239\n00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:27.650\nis that businesses today are rarely\njust their on site data center, right?\n\n240\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.870\nA lot of times we actually do have\ncomponents that are on site, but\n\n241\n00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.950\nwe also have components that\nare in the cloud as some type\n\n242\n00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.780\nof infrastructure service of some sort.\n\n243\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.780\nSo you may actually have it where your\nbusiness does have servers on site, but\n\n244\n00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.990\nat the same time they may actually be\ndependent on the cloud to actually provide\n\n245\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.180\nother services.\n\n246\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.170\nSo for us, let's say here at IT Pro TV,\n\n247\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.780\nthere's a lot of services that we use that\nare cloud based, and it makes more sense.\n\n248\n00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.010\nBut there's also some of the servers\nthat we have here to keep data also\n\n249\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.730\non site as well.\n\n250\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.820\nSo when you start actually now\nhaving stuff that you have to manage\n\n251\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.400\nin the current environment, as well on\nyour local environment, as well as in\n\n252\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.760\nthe cloud, what ends up happening is that\nyou now actually end up working with two\n\n253\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.310\ndifferent management systems that\ncould be a little bit more diverse.\n\n254\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.100\nThe very fact is, you're used to\nmanaging your on site one way,\n\n255\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.400\nyou're used to managing the cloud through\nanother interface in another way.\n\n256\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.180\nWell the goal and idea of course,\ntoo, is that virtualization, being on\n\n257\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.740\na virtualized entire network, prepares\nyou to get ready for the cloud as well.\n\n258\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.290\nAnd what they want to do and\n\n259\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:35.660\nwhat VMware is really is stressing is\nwhat we call the idea of an SDDC, okay.\n\n260\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:42.078\nAnd that is a software-defined\ndata center is what\n\n261\n00:13:42.078 --> 00:13:43.940\nthey're actually talking about here.\n\n262\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.092\nNow, when we start taking a look at that,\n\n263\n00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:51.070\nwe're trying to move that model\naway from hardware maintenance.\n\n264\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.150\nFrom actually having to make sure\nthat that server is running and\n\n265\n00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.660\nthat all the switches are connected and\n\n266\n00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:00.560\neverything else, to actually managing\nthat network and instead actually being\n\n267\n00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.035\nable to do it consistently regardless\nof where those things are.\n\n268\n00:14:03.035 --> 00:14:08.190\nSo let me show you on my diagram\nagain what we're talking about.\n\n269\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.880\nSo here's what I'm going to say is\na typical layout of some of the components\n\n270\n00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.460\nthat you'll find inside of\na data center and even more.\n\n271\n00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.270\nBut when we start talking about the idea\nof a software defined data center,\n\n272\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.520\nwhat I've done here is I've blocked\nout all of those different components.\n\n273\n00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.607\nInstead, and what this means is that\nregardless of whether you're talking about\n\n274\n00:14:28.607 --> 00:14:31.387\nwhere the servers are actually are and\nwhat has to manage\n\n275\n00:14:31.387 --> 00:14:34.819\nthem in the way that you want to\nmanage them in individual networks and\n\n276\n00:14:34.819 --> 00:14:38.488\ncomponents and stuff, you instead\ncan actually use a single interface,\n\n277\n00:14:38.488 --> 00:14:42.850\nand this actually allows you to manage\nit essentially through software.\n\n278\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.170\nBy being able to do that it doesn't\nmater where those servers actually are.\n\n279\n00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.350\nThey could be part of your\ncloud infrastructure.\n\n280\n00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.410\nThey could be part of a service that you\nactually do buy a service access to,\n\n281\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.190\na subscription to.\n\n282\n00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.570\nAnd they can also be here.\n\n283\n00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:01.320\nSo by being on a move into a software\nmanagement type of system, in which yes,\n\n284\n00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.940\nyou are defining everything\ninside a software.\n\n285\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.950\nThis includes networking,\nincludes the servers,\n\n286\n00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.890\nincludes the switches,\nincludes everything.\n\n287\n00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:12.520\nWell, now you actually have a single\ninterface and you can control all of that.\n\n288\n00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.330\nAnd that is another\nbenefit that we can do.\n\n289\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.100\nWe talk about moving to a fully\nvirtualized infrastructure, and\n\n290\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.370\nhere's the three terms you've got to be\nfamiliar with in terms of VMware, okay.\n\n291\n00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:27.500\nThey talk about it in terms of compute,\nnetwork and storage.\n\n292\n00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.500\nSo those are kind of the main components.\n\n293\n00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.060\nSo down here, we had the storage\nin the lower left hand corner,\n\n294\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.460\nand what I'm saying here\nis by using this grid,\n\n295\n00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.450\nI'm saying, we're going to\nmanage that through software.\n\n296\n00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.730\nWe're not actually worried about what\nthe underlying infrastructure is,\n\n297\n00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:44.110\nwhether this is a SAN or NAS or\niSCSI device, whatever it is here.\n\n298\n00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.399\nWe, if we're actually trying to do\nthis as a data center guy well we're\n\n299\n00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:52.048\nactually only looking at through\nthat software interface.\n\n300\n00:15:52.048 --> 00:15:56.374\nThe same thing with the servers if they're\nvirtualized, we're not worried about\n\n301\n00:15:56.374 --> 00:15:59.540\nthe physical components,\nwe actually see the whole thing.\n\n302\n00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.137\nAs being the ability to build VM's\nas we need them and we actually take\n\n303\n00:16:03.137 --> 00:16:07.330\nthe capacity of it and we're managing\nthrough that interface again.\n\n304\n00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.870\nAnd even the networking, right.\n\n305\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:13.130\nWe can build virtual switches that allows\nto group things the way we want it to and\n\n306\n00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.700\nallow the traffic to pass and\ndo monitoring and\n\n307\n00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.860\nwe're all doing it through\nthe same common interface.\n\n308\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.320\nRegardless of where that\ninfrastructure ends up lying.\n\n309\n00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.700\nAnd that's what we want to get to as well.\n\n310\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.270\nNow you might actually be saying,\nwhy is this actually good?\n\n311\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.520\nBecause if you don't have this, right.\n\n312\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.160\nThis is where you do have to\ncall in that Cisco consultant.\n\n313\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.630\nThis is where you do actually have to call\nin the guy that knows how all this stuff\n\n314\n00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.510\nis stuck together and make it work.\n\n315\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.230\n>> That's right.\nIt goes from having to know ten different\n\n316\n00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:44.330\ntechnologies and know them actually\npretty well to knowing maybe one or two.\n\n317\n00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.110\nDefinitely you learn ESX,\nyou learn the VMware side of things and\n\n318\n00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.640\nyour management starts to dwindle down.\n\n319\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.890\nThe ease of management becomes\nexponentially increased.\n\n320\n00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.960\nIt's a wonderful thing to be able to sit\ndown to a console that you're familiar\n\n321\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.770\nwith, that you know, and [COUGH] excuse\nme, any kind of new concept that comes in,\n\n322\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.290\nI need to tweak the networking.\n\n323\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.010\nWell I don't have to jump into this\nCisco iOS and know all that stuff.\n\n324\n00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.910\nI can work that through virtual switches.\n\n325\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.400\nI can work that through all\nvirtualization that they allow\n\n326\n00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.850\nthrough this type of technology.\n\n327\n00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.920\nVirtualization, that's why it's\nthe hot topic to be honest with you.\n\n328\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.630\nIt's where everyone is going.\n\n329\n00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.100\nBecause of these benefits\nthat we're laying out before.\n\n330\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.180\n>> And the other thing about the data\ncenter that I don't have here but\n\n331\n00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.060\nI'm gonna move on and\n\n332\n00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.800\nshow kind of selling my screen is\nturned into something insanely more.\n\n333\n00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Busy, right.\n\n334\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.040\nIs the idea of what we call\ndisaster recover sites.\n\n335\n00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.490\nNow, as your network gets bigger,\n\n336\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.650\nyes you start relying on disaster\nrecovery sites much more, right.\n\n337\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:46.480\nYou don't ever want there\nto be a possibility that,\n\n338\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.910\nhey the main center fails and\nyou don't have a backup.\n\n339\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.530\nYou don't have anything that you\ncan actually switch on over to.\n\n340\n00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.610\nSo what normally happens is of course,\n\n341\n00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.410\nthen depending on your company's budget\nideally you would have parity, right.\n\n342\n00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.110\nIn other words,\n\n343\n00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.340\neverything that you'd set up over\nhere in your main production network.\n\n344\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.490\nYou go to your disaster recovery site and\nyou have complete parity.\n\n345\n00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.840\nOne to one, everything's ready to go, and\nyou don't have to worry about it, right.\n\n346\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.620\nBecause everything's set up the same way.\n\n347\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.700\nDaniel goes, all right, here's how\nto configure the firewall over here.\n\n348\n00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.170\nWell then, we also go to\nthe disaster recovery center and\n\n349\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.170\nwe go, just to make sure,\neven though we're not changing anything,\n\n350\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.900\nlet me go ahead and\nchange that setting over here as well.\n\n351\n00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.530\nAnd then if something does happen\nit immediately flips over and\n\n352\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.870\nthere you go, okay.\n\n353\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.210\nSo here I have it where this router\nessentially connects out into the internet\n\n354\n00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.430\nalso to the disaster recovery site.\n\n355\n00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.759\nSo if I do have a service that's coming in\npeople are in my web servers over here,\n\n356\n00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:36.920\nperfectly fine, works just great.\n\n357\n00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.810\nWell what happens though when\nthis now actually is gone.\n\n358\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.260\nBut what should also happen then is that\nthe internet right that actually come in\n\n359\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.530\nthrough our disaster recovery site\neverything is up and running.\n\n360\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.660\nNow the problem that we\nhave though is cost, right.\n\n361\n00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.830\nThat is the most expensive implementation\nof a data center you can have, okay.\n\n362\n00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.360\nAnd Daniel, so you actually work for\na big company,\n\n363\n00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.100\ndisaster recovery what do you think?\n\n364\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.435\n>> It's kind of important.\n\n365\n00:19:00.435 --> 00:19:02.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just a hair and\n\n366\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.360\nwhen we say kind of important\nI always like to say,\n\n367\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.170\nhow much does your data worth to you?\n\n368\n00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.800\nThat's really what it boils down to.\n\n369\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.060\nIf you lost everything, for\nsome reason a gas main exploded and\n\n370\n00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.640\nyour building is obliterated along\nwith your data center obviously,\n\n371\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.920\nhow much would that be worth to you?\n\n372\n00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.170\nObviously, the building is\ngonna be hard to replace.\n\n373\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:28.000\nBut that data, the thing that actually\nmakes up you as an entity, as a business,\n\n374\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.430\nif that is gone you basically no longer\nare a business, you are nothing.\n\n375\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.040\nYou don't have that data,\nyou would have to rebuild from scratch.\n\n376\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.110\nSo disaster recovery is something that\nwe spend a lot of time preparing for and\n\n377\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.640\nyeah, it costs us a lot of money.\n\n378\n00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.170\nYou got offsites, you got\nreplication going through WAN links,\n\n379\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.110\nyou've got tape backups, you name it,\nyou're probably implementing it.\n\n380\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.470\nAnd using virtualization can definitely\n\n381\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.100\nreduce the amount of management it's\ngonna take to create that scenario.\n\n382\n00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.370\n>> It really can and VMWare,\nof course says look,\n\n383\n00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.700\nnot only can we actually reduce\nthat idea of needing parity.\n\n384\n00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.120\nBut we can actually say, look what we\ncan do is, we can build a seamless\n\n385\n00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.740\ninfrastructure from your private cloud all\nthe way through to the public cloud and\n\n386\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.920\nstart building our virtualized data\ncenter up in the public cloud somewhere,\n\n387\n00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.010\nif we need to.\n\n388\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.890\nThat way, it's always up and running, it\nactually has everything that you need, so\n\n389\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.310\neven if everything goes down, and\nyou might say, well why is that good?\n\n390\n00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.270\nBecause you're really paying for\na subscription here.\n\n391\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:29.120\nAnd you actually don't have\nto actually start building up\n\n392\n00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.090\nthe same physical infrastructure and\nhaving another site somewhere else and\n\n393\n00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.680\nbeing able to do all this.\n\n394\n00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.390\nSo it actually does allow you to be\nable to actually think about this idea.\n\n395\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.990\nAnd of course there's solutions out\nthere and VMware of course says,\n\n396\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.840\nwe have the perfect solution for you,\nso you should actually buy ours.\n\n397\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.140\nAnd we're gonna talk about that a little\nbit later on much more in depth.\n\n398\n00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.730\nBut at this point,\nthat's what you're seeing, okay.\n\n399\n00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.310\nSo that's where some of\nthe benefits are too, and\n\n400\n00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.350\nremember this people are actually\nmoving more and more towards the cloud.\n\n401\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.280\nThe management that we talked about\nis just much more simple, right.\n\n402\n00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.180\nPeople get a little bit afraid and say,\n\n403\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.263\nwell if I'm actually moving to the cloud\nI've to learn a new management system.\n\n404\n00:21:06.263 --> 00:21:09.893\nWell again, with the virtualization\ntechnology, you may not have to at all.\n\n405\n00:21:09.893 --> 00:21:13.045\nYou have that one seamless interface,\neverything actually goes and\n\n406\n00:21:13.045 --> 00:21:14.570\nchanges that way, okay.\n\n407\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.820\nNow, all this is for what?\n\n408\n00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.420\nIt's for the sake of us being able to do\n\n409\n00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.060\nas far as the business goes what\nwe call business continuity, okay.\n\n410\n00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.680\nBeing able to establish a virtual type\nof disaster recovery is a big one.\n\n411\n00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.170\nBeing on a havel to call high\navailability is a big one as well.\n\n412\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.980\nAnd that's one of those benefits too.\n\n413\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.330\nNow we're gonna talk about this\na little bit more in depth.\n\n414\n00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.180\nBut essentially high availability says,\n\n415\n00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.820\nlook we want to make sure that what we\nhave is essentially no down time, okay.\n\n416\n00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.240\nFor things that we have access to.\n\n417\n00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.660\nSo there's actually even\nvirtualization technology\n\n418\n00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.985\nthat says what happens if the physical\nmachine itself fails, okay.\n\n419\n00:21:51.985 --> 00:21:55.400\nHow do we actually recover from\nthat if that's what is going on\n\n420\n00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.650\nif all my VMs are on\nthat physical machine?\n\n421\n00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.050\nWell again you do have redundancy but\n\n422\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:04.070\nthe way that the technology actually can\nwork of course it can automatically take\n\n423\n00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.910\na VM that's actually on a failed machine\nand restarted on another one, okay.\n\n424\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.860\nSo we actually are gonna look at that\na little bit more in depth as well, okay.\n\n425\n00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.610\nAlso, the way that you do backups.\n\n426\n00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.670\nThe way that you actually\nreplicate the data.\n\n427\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.740\nThe way that you do all this is actually\npart of it that you have a good business\n\n428\n00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.520\ncontinuity plan even if the physical\ncenter kind of explodes somehow and\n\n429\n00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.830\nyou can't control that and yes, you do\nend up in a disaster recovery situation.\n\n430\n00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:33.260\nIs all about that idea of making sure\nthat your business will run regardless\n\n431\n00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:38.710\nof whether we're actually worried too\nmuch about as far the infrastructure,\n\n432\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.440\nwe absolutely have as far as\nthe infrastructure the abilities say look.\n\n433\n00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.130\nThe business can continue as\nfar as the infrastructure,\n\n434\n00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.610\nyou just have to make sure that everybody\nis actually in place to continue to run.\n\n435\n00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.800\nBut overall though that's what\nthey're trying to accomplish.\n\n436\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.520\nSo when it comes down to benefits, right.\n\n437\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.220\nYou and I were technical people.\n\n438\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.390\nWe don't tend to look at\nthe business side of things.\n\n439\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.770\nOkay, if you're a business person you may\ntake a look at some of the technical side\n\n440\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.730\nand really that's what this\ncourse is designed to do as well.\n\n441\n00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.530\nIs help someone even with just\nthe business sense to say,\n\n442\n00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.420\nthis is a good advantage that\nwe wanna take a look at and\n\n443\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.170\nwe have to actually think\nabout that as well.\n\n444\n00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.980\nSo always think about in terms of business\n\n445\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:23.960\nadvantages as well as\ntechnical advantages.\n\n446\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.480\nSo there's financial benefits,\n\n447\n00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.050\nthere's business benefits, you name it\nthey're actually all out there for us.\n\n448\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.590\nTo take a look at and to think about.\n\n449\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.470\nThe biggest one for most people in\nbusiness is the reduction of cap x, right.\n\n450\n00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.830\nThat capital expenditure as well\nas the operational expenditure.\n\n451\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.450\nBy far, most people that actually making\nthe big decision on whether we're gonna do\n\n452\n00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:45.600\nit or not, it's gonna be those two.\n\n453\n00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.932\nYou can probably say,\nyeah server consolidation all day long.\n\n454\n00:23:49.932 --> 00:23:52.217\nYes, you can reduce this and this.\n\n455\n00:23:52.217 --> 00:23:56.883\nAnd but when you say look, when we start\ntalking as the way that this ends up\n\n456\n00:23:56.883 --> 00:24:00.797\nworking is that we'll reduce\nthis expenditure by this much,\n\n457\n00:24:00.797 --> 00:24:04.230\nthen their ears perk up and\nthey are ready to go.\n\n458\n00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:09.000\nSo, there's always that, that you wanna\ntake a look at and then the changing of\n\n459\n00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.950\nthe model right, that what you can do for\nyour entire business is move from the idea\n\n460\n00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:17.480\nof maintaining a data center to\nactually using it as a service.\n\n461\n00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.406\nNow it becomes a functional thing that\nyou know is not, I can't do that today,\n\n462\n00:24:22.406 --> 00:24:25.170\nbecause I've got to actually\nwork on rebuilding that server.\n\n463\n00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.390\nInstead, you actually allow\nthe virtualization take over, and\n\n464\n00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.790\nnow you have a complete\ndepartment than can actually\n\n465\n00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.660\ndo well the things that you actually\nhired them to do which is kinda neat.\n\n466\n00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.390\n>> Yeah Ronnie, I know we spend\na lot of time harping on the fact\n\n467\n00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.300\nthat this does save us a lot of money.\n\n468\n00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.910\nAnd it does, it reduces the cost\nby a very large amount.\n\n469\n00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.340\nBut as tech guys out there if you're\nwatching, this is a technical person,\n\n470\n00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.430\nmaybe not so much a business person,\nwe think of it in terms of the management,\n\n471\n00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.350\nthe ease of management.\n\n472\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.590\nThat is the biggest,\n\n473\n00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.860\nI mean think about the fact what would\nit take to spin up a new server?\n\n474\n00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.650\nWe need another DNS server.\n\n475\n00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.020\nWe need a new web Server.\n\n476\n00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.730\nI got to have that.\n\n477\n00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.340\nWe need it yesterday.\n\n478\n00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:03.930\nWhat do you do?\n\n479\n00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:10.000\nWell, I gotta get on my, go to Dell, go to\nwherever that I'm gonna buy a server from,\n\n480\n00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.280\nlook up, spec out what am I gonna need.\n\n481\n00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.410\nI'm gonna need this.\nI'm gonna need that.\n\n482\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:13.410\nI'm gonna need this much RAM.\n\n483\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.570\nI'm gonna need this much processor speed.\n\n484\n00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.190\nAlso stuff, hard drive, storage.\n\n485\n00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.860\nDon't forget that.\n\n486\n00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.880\nIt's always a hot topic.\n\n487\n00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.030\nAnd then you buy that,\nthen it's gotta ship to you,\n\n488\n00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.750\nand then you gotta plug it in,\nturn it on, install an operating system,\n\n489\n00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.680\nyou're running through a ton\nof administrative procedures.\n\n490\n00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.190\nIt's just a lot of work that you have\nto do to get this thing up and running.\n\n491\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.670\nThis is, to me,\nthe biggest advantage of virtualization.\n\n492\n00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:37.860\nI need a server yesterday.\n\n493\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.440\nOkay, what do you need on it?\n\n494\n00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.330\nThis, this, and this?\n\n495\n00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.680\nNot a problem.\nIt'll be done in ten minutes.\n\n496\n00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.150\nWe'll have it basically up and\nrunning within the next ten minutes.\n\n497\n00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:52.800\nIt's so fast, so much easier to deploy\nnew technologies and spin up new servers.\n\n498\n00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.080\nIt's not even funny, is it?\n\n499\n00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.330\n>> No.\nIt really isn't.\n\n500\n00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.830\nBecause of the way that technology works,\nit really does reduce the time that\n\n501\n00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:02.160\nsomeone that may actually be\nworking on something different.\n\n502\n00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.650\nSo for example, we assign Daniel\na project, and he's absolutely working his\n\n503\n00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.150\nhardest on that project, and you stop\nhim and go, hey we need that server.\n\n504\n00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.620\nWell that means Daniel has to\nstop the course of his project\n\n505\n00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.940\nto actually do what you need him to do.\n\n506\n00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.150\nWhich can work, don't get me wrong.\n\n507\n00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.350\nHe'll probably do it.\n\n508\n00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.250\nBut at the same time, it stops him\nfrom having anymore productivity.\n\n509\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.893\nSo, increasing the productivity allowing\nyour IT department to actually do whatever\n\n510\n00:26:25.893 --> 00:26:30.215\nservice level that they actually need to,\nallowing them to be more responsive to\n\n511\n00:26:30.215 --> 00:26:34.219\nthe things that they really need to be\nresponsive to, than instead of like I\n\n512\n00:26:34.219 --> 00:26:38.543\nsaid coming in and realizing man I can't\ndo all that stuff that's request of me,\n\n513\n00:26:38.543 --> 00:26:41.247\nbecause well three of our\nservers have gone down.\n\n514\n00:26:41.247 --> 00:26:44.439\nWe have to rebuild the whole thing, we had\nto wait for those servers to come in and\n\n515\n00:26:44.439 --> 00:26:44.975\ndo all that.\n\n516\n00:26:44.975 --> 00:26:49.049\nThey are actually are changing the way\nthat business ends up working, and\n\n517\n00:26:49.049 --> 00:26:53.256\nit makes it much more efficient much\nbetter in terms of financially as well as\n\n518\n00:26:53.256 --> 00:26:56.300\nbusiness wise,\neverybody becomes happier and it is.\n\n519\n00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.410\nIt's through that basic\ntechnology of virtualization, but\n\n520\n00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:06.750\nnow we're expanding beyond the idea of\njust a single server, beyond a single PC.\n\n521\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.670\nTo now saying, we can do this for\nthe entire data center and\n\n522\n00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.540\nthat is one of the keys here.\n\n523\n00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.720\nSo, by understanding those benefits,\nright, it allows you to be able to\n\n524\n00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.680\ntalk to people and say, hey, this is\nwhy we would choose to do this, and\n\n525\n00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.370\nwhy we should take advantage of it as a\ncompany, and so, that's the last word I'm\n\n526\n00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.730\ngonna say on that, but just kind\nof realize that it's a lot, right?\n\n527\n00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:28.290\nBut we do.\n\n528\n00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.200\nWe have to actually be convincing, and\n\n529\n00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.500\nwe have to be convinced that\nthis is the best way to go.\n\n530\n00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.270\n>> It's funny Ronnie.\n\n531\n00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:37.440\nYou mention productivity,\nthe fact that because I am now faster,\n\n532\n00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.850\nmore efficient at my job through\nvirtualization, I become more productive.\n\n533\n00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.970\nWhat does that mean to the CEO,\nthe guy that cares about the bottom line?\n\n534\n00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.710\nIs that well, we're getting more bang for\nour buck out of Daniel, because we've\n\n535\n00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:52.690\nincreased his ability to be efficient,\nwe've increased his productivity.\n\n536\n00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:57.940\nEvery dime that we're giving him to work\nhere is now giving us a bigger benefit.\n\n537\n00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:02.880\nSo even at that point, it becomes more\nabout that bottom line, and so it's easy.\n\n538\n00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.530\nIt's easy to sell anybody with\na pocketbook that makes the shock collar\n\n539\n00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:10.060\nwhen it comes to money,\nit's easy to sell them on this type of\n\n540\n00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.610\nenvironment because of how\nmuch money it does save.\n\n541\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.040\nBut, Ronnie, you've shown us a lot\nof many benefits you pointed out.\n\n542\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.460\nJust a myriad of different\nreasons why we should jump\n\n543\n00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.560\ninto virtualization using VMWare\nwhich they do a fantastic job of.\n\n544\n00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.330\n>> Right.\n>> Like I said,\n\n545\n00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.170\nI've worked with them for\nquite some time, it's amazing product.\n\n546\n00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.870\nAnything else that we want to add to\nthis episode before we wrap it up?\n\n547\n00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.200\n>> Not on this episode, but\ndo remember those terms.\n\n548\n00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.520\nIf you haven't heard some of\nthose terms that I've been using,\n\n549\n00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.070\nmake sure you pay attention that\nIt's going to actually appear again\n\n550\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.010\nwhen you actually get ready for your exam.\n\n551\n00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.030\nSo, the terminology is key.\n\n552\n00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:46.390\nEven understanding the benefits of\nvirtualization is a big key for us.\n\n553\n00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:50.230\nBecause you will also be asked about\nthose types of things as well.\n\n554\n00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.550\nI can't go any deeper than that, but\nyou've just got to be familiar with those\n\n555\n00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.760\nconcepts that are actually going\nto be available out there.\n\n556\n00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.470\nAnd it's one of those things where you do,\n\n557\n00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.760\nyou have to decide like why\nshould I choose virtualization?\n\n558\n00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.670\nYou have to know what's\nactually a true benefit.\n\n559\n00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.980\nIs a true benefit the idea of, it's neat?\n\n560\n00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.380\nIt's cool to virtualize or\ndoes it really help you to save money?\n\n561\n00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.400\nDoes it really help your productivity?\n\n562\n00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.050\nAnd you've gotta know that, you've\ngotta know what those differences are.\n\n563\n00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:16.740\n>> Awesome stuff

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:18.018\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.828\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing on\nwith our VCA series, joining us back in\n\n5\n00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:25.424\nthe studio again today to help us out with\nthat endeavor is our good friend, Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:26.090\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.690\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.550\n>> Well, thank you again for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n9\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.315\nAnd it's a great day again to actually be\nright here as we take a look at the VCA.\n\n10\n00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:37.715\nRemember, that's\nVMWare's Certified Associate version 6.\n\n11\n00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.907\nAnd we're actually getting ready for\nthat exam as well as actually\n\n12\n00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:44.669\nmaking sure you understand the concepts\nhere of data center virtualization,\n\n13\n00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:47.010\nreally kind of the foundational\nlevel of it too.\n\n14\n00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.900\nAnd so during our series so\n\n15\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.540\nfar, right, we've kinda viewed some\ndifferent virtualization concepts.\n\n16\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.400\nWe've also, of course,\n\n17\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.770\ntalked about the idea of benefits\nof data center virtualization and\n\n18\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.360\nalong with benefits then, that means\nthere's always a flip side of this.\n\n19\n00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.290\nAnd the flip side of this, of course,\nwould be challenges that we actually\n\n20\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.790\nare gonna end up facing in terms\nof data center virtualization.\n\n21\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.620\nAnd so we're gonna actually be talking\nabout those a little bit more as well.\n\n22\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.880\nBut since this is a VMware\ncentered type of show and\n\n23\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.450\nwe also want to make sure that we\nunderstand that this is part of what they\n\n24\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.000\nwant you to learn about too,\nis that essentially VMWare is saying look,\n\n25\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.240\nwhen it comes down to data center\nvirtualization we wanna be your product.\n\n26\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.652\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n27\n00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:32.140\nThey wanna make sure that\nthey are your product.\n\n28\n00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.350\nThey are so interested in that that\npart of their own business plan,\n\n29\n00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.518\ntheir goal, is to actually say look.\n\n30\n00:01:38.518 --> 00:01:42.910\nLook, we wanna become everybody's\nchoice virtualization platform and\n\n31\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.550\nso that's what they're trying to do.\n\n32\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.750\nThey don' care about what operating system\nyou're running, they don't care whether or\n\n33\n00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.050\nactually for\na particular type of business or\n\n34\n00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.060\ninsurance like Dan worked in or the idea\nof something like what we're doing.\n\n35\n00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.510\nThey say look, we wanna be that.\n\n36\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.960\nIf you had an ISP, they won't actually be\nyour choice for virtualization as well,\n\n37\n00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.200\nyou name it, they're just saying,\nlook, that's what we want to do.\n\n38\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.000\nWe wanna corner the entire\nmarket of virtualization.\n\n39\n00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.940\nSo when they start talking\nabout doing stuff like that,\n\n40\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.520\nthey actually did introduce\nseveral different products for\n\n41\n00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.370\nus, but the main product that they wanted\nto introduce to really help out with\n\n42\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.719\nthe idea of data center virtualization\nis something that we call vSphere, okay.\n\n43\n00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:27.080\nSo yep, it's exactly like it sounds\nlike a sphere, like a globe.\n\n44\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.690\nAnd then of course they just put\nthe lowercase v in front of it.\n\n45\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.886\nWhich is for one reason or\nanother stands for\n\n46\n00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:36.500\nVMWare even though VMWare is actually\ncapitalized and VM and the W there.\n\n47\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.670\nBut, a lower case v is one\nof those unusual things.\n\n48\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.080\nBut, that's the main product that\nthey are really trying to get you to\n\n49\n00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.730\nreally hook into if you are thinking about\nthe idea of data center virtualization.\n\n50\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.480\nAnd so we wanna take a look at those,\n\n51\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.350\nat the different versions of\nthose products just briefly.\n\n52\n00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.820\nAnd then we'll actually even kind of show\na little bit about the cost side of it,\n\n53\n00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.110\nwhich is not as pretty\nas you'd like it to be.\n\n54\n00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.300\nBut it depends on a little bit more of\nwhat your company business is going to be.\n\n55\n00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.918\nSo that's what we're\ntaking a look at first,\n\n56\n00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:12.910\nis we're gonna first start off with\nsome of the different editions of VMWare\n\n57\n00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.340\nthat you should be familiar with\nas you get ready for this exam.\n\n58\n00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.430\nAnd then, of course,\n\n59\n00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.470\nin a business place, you've got to be able\nto pick the right one that you also need.\n\n60\n00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.830\nThe good thing is VMWare really\nhelps us out with that and\n\n61\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.990\nwe can take a look at it\ndirectly from their website.\n\n62\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.190\nSo let's go and take a look on my screen.\n\n63\n00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.420\nAnd we'll show you what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n64\n00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.360\nSo when it comes down to what\nwe're normally looking for, right?\n\n65\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.600\nMost of the time on the technical side.\n\n66\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.680\nOkay.\nThat's where you and\n\n67\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.730\nI come in as an expert as\nsomebody as you recommend this.\n\n68\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.500\nIs that we will need to\nlook up the features.\n\n69\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.588\nBuild to compare and\nactually know what we need to do, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:46.588 --> 00:03:49.993\nAnd so the good thing is you can actually\ngo ahead and just do a search and\n\n71\n00:03:49.993 --> 00:03:51.340\nthat's what I did.\n\n72\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.080\nI search for vSphere edition,\nthis is what I did.\n\n73\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.692\nAnd that gave me right here in this\nproduct sheet here, or the vSphere and\n\n74\n00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:02.460\nthe vSphere with operations\nmanagement sheet, it came right up.\n\n75\n00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.710\nI selected the compare and\nthat way we can take a look at all three.\n\n76\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.850\nSo the three editions.\n\n77\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.150\nLet me see if I can zoom in just\na little more to help us out and\n\n78\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.880\nscroll over a little bit so\nthat we can take a look here.\n\n79\n00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.650\nThere's vSphere Standard.\n\n80\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.080\nThere's vSphere Enterprise Plus,\nwhich I can't say right now.\n\n81\n00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.620\nAnd then there's also the vSphere\nOperations Management Enterprise Plus\n\n82\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.760\nas well.\n\n83\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.440\nNow, for the exam,\nthis is what I want you to focus in on,\n\n84\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.530\nbecause this is where you may\nsee different terminology, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.320\nRight now, on the exam itself,\n\n86\n00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.570\nthis particular terminology\nhas changed a little bit.\n\n87\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.920\nBy a little bit,\n\n88\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.170\nusually what you might actually\nend up seeing is vSphere Standard.\n\n89\n00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.210\nYou might see the term\nvSphere Enterprise and\n\n90\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.170\nthen V Sphere Enterprise Plus,\nas far as the different levels go.\n\n91\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.860\nSo even though it's the latest exam that's\nactually out there, this particular\n\n92\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.900\nterminology has changed a little bit where\nno longer do you just have enterprise.\n\n93\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.465\nBut now let's actually say\nyou have Enterprise Plus and\n\n94\n00:05:04.465 --> 00:05:08.545\nnow you have vSphere with\nOperations Management Enterprise Plus.\n\n95\n00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:11.725\nSo somewhere along the line they decided\nto kinda say look, everything that we're\n\n96\n00:05:11.725 --> 00:05:15.975\ndoing is a plus, it's not just\nan Enterprise Edition itself.\n\n97\n00:05:15.975 --> 00:05:19.895\nSo you may actually see a little\nbit of a different terminology but\n\n98\n00:05:19.895 --> 00:05:22.715\nthe features match up just like this.\n\n99\n00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:25.040\nAnd so\nthey just kind of changed the naming.\n\n100\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.150\nI don't know why.\n\n101\n00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.730\nJust the way that they chose to market.\n\n102\n00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.810\nIt's what happens.\n\n103\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.570\nSo, what is the main kind of comparison\nwhen you start taking a look at\n\n104\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.470\nthe features?\n\n105\n00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.390\nWell over here on the left hand\nside then is vSphere standard.\n\n106\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.940\nWhat we really want to actually\ndo is focus in on this top line\n\n107\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.960\nwhich talks about what the actual feature\nis and what it actually does for us.\n\n108\n00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.900\nWhat does the main product do?\n\n109\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.520\nWe'll if you're really looking for\nbasic server consolidation\n\n110\n00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.940\nto help you also out with what we\ncall business continuity, right?\n\n111\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.190\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of business continuity,\n\n112\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.300\nwhat we're really saying,\nthere is no planned down time, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.110\nSo we know that things are gonna end\nup happening where servers will die.\n\n114\n00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.510\nFires happen.\n\n115\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.100\nAll that stuff.\n\n116\n00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.190\nHopefully it won't happen to you,\nbut what we're actually saying is,\n\n117\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.460\nwe don't want there to be\nmaintenance downtime, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.970\nAnd so\n\n119\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.790\none of those things in vSphere Standard is\nthis idea of being able to do everything.\n\n120\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.376\nAll your maintenance and everything\nelse can actually go on while vSphere is\n\n121\n00:06:24.376 --> 00:06:28.140\nrunning, while your virtualized data\ncenter is actually continuing to go on.\n\n122\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.616\nYou do not have to shut down\npart of your data center to\n\n123\n00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:36.068\nactually continue to have service\nthat you need for your network.\n\n124\n00:06:36.068 --> 00:06:40.880\nBut once that's actually done though\nafter that point now this is where it\n\n125\n00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.550\nactually begins to be a little bit\nmore challenging in this part.\n\n126\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.150\nYou don't have a lot of\nthe need management tools.\n\n127\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.360\nYou really don't you\nhave basic management.\n\n128\n00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.850\nYou can go in there and create VMs,\nyou can do a few things here.\n\n129\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.490\nYou can manage a few resources overall and\ncreate your own data source, but\n\n130\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.080\nwhen it comes down to it,\nthis actually is a little bit more\n\n131\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.740\nclunky than what most of\nus are going to be used to.\n\n132\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.050\nBut right out of the box, though,\nyou can at least do this stuff.\n\n133\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.710\nWhere you can set up high availability.\n\n134\n00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.370\nYou can set up your motion storage and\nall that stuff as well.\n\n135\n00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.060\nAnd so you do have that\naccess to be able to do so.\n\n136\n00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.370\nNow, of course, for it to work, notice\nthat they also put in something else,\n\n137\n00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.190\nwhich they don't tell you about yet,\nexcept for right down here.\n\n138\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.775\nIf you're gonna run this,\nyou also need to, of course,\n\n139\n00:07:26.775 --> 00:07:30.524\nhave the vCenter Server Standard\naddition to make it work.\n\n140\n00:07:30.524 --> 00:07:31.655\nAnd then, I zoomed in so\n\n141\n00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:34.777\nmuch you didn't actually see what\nwas in parenthesis over here.\n\n142\n00:07:34.777 --> 00:07:37.603\nLet me scroll over if I can,\nI really zoomed in too much,\n\n143\n00:07:37.603 --> 00:07:39.580\nlet me see if I can scroll and\nthere we go.\n\n144\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.125\nNotice that it actually\ndoes say sold separately.\n\n145\n00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:46.566\n[LAUGH] So you're actually starting to see\nthat hey price may actually kind of add\n\n146\n00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:47.104\nup here.\n\n147\n00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:51.524\nBut this is a great addition prior for\na small market a person or\n\n148\n00:07:51.524 --> 00:07:54.671\nlike a business I just\nkeep saying a person.\n\n149\n00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:58.916\nA business that says we need the basics,\nwe really need it to get it done and\n\n150\n00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:03.367\nwe need to ensure that our services are\nalways available here As far as our data\n\n151\n00:08:03.367 --> 00:08:07.790\ncenter, that's kinda the heart and\nmanagement of what we need here.\n\n152\n00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.490\nSo let's stick with that, and you'll\nprobably be perfectly fine with that and\n\n153\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.080\nactually work with it forever, and\n\n154\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.600\nprobably not have any problems\nwith it as well, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.710\nSo along with that,\nif you wanna find out more features,\n\n156\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.560\nwe're gonna be talking about several\nof these throughout our series.\n\n157\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.910\nLet me zoom in just a little bit more\nas far as the product features go.\n\n158\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.761\nWe're gonna be going over this stuff that\nyou actually talk about here, such as V,\n\n159\n00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:29.774\nI'm trying to make sure I don't\n[CROSSTALK] hover over it.\n\n160\n00:08:29.774 --> 00:08:30.535\n>> Yeah.\n\n161\n00:08:30.535 --> 00:08:32.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hover and covering everything else.\n\n162\n00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.440\nWe're gonna take a look at V Motion,\nand the storage V Motion.\n\n163\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.802\nWe'll take a look at the high availability\ndata protection and fault tolerance.\n\n164\n00:08:40.802 --> 00:08:45.589\nWe'll be focusing in on that,\nas well as the idea of Hot Add, too.\n\n165\n00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:47.857\nAnd some of these features\nthat we have available,\n\n166\n00:08:47.857 --> 00:08:50.130\nwe'll go a little bit\nmore in depth over it.\n\n167\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.560\nBut you actually see why this is\nabout the business continuity, right?\n\n168\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.120\nThe idea of V Motion, allows us to be\nable to move virtual machines from\n\n169\n00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.560\none failing server over to another one,\nusing the idea of high availability.\n\n170\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.890\nIn other words, managing it a little\nbit better and actually making it so\n\n171\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.440\nfast that it seems seamless.\n\n172\n00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.360\nIn other words, zero down time.\n\n173\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.620\nYou may not even know it's going on, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.480\nThat's the way that it goes.\n\n175\n00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.890\nAnd then issuing out fault tolerance.\n\n176\n00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.460\nAgain all these features\nare actually built in.\n\n177\n00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.200\nAnd the idea of hot add is\nkind of an amazing one.\n\n178\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.530\nEven at the most standard edition here\nDaniel, and like I said, I'll probably\n\n179\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.040\nmention it again, you'll probably go,\nI think Ronnie already mentioned that.\n\n180\n00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.155\nIt'll happen.\n\n181\n00:09:27.155 --> 00:09:33.520\nIn Hot Add Daniel, if we need to increase\nlet's say, the capacity of my VM.\n\n182\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.483\nIf I need to actually add in an additional\nnick, if I need to add in an additional\n\n183\n00:09:38.483 --> 00:09:42.033\nhardware, another virtual hard drive,\neverything.\n\n184\n00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:44.159\nI don't actually have to\npower down that VM, okay?\n\n185\n00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:46.642\nI just simply add it, and\nit will end up working and\n\n186\n00:09:46.642 --> 00:09:49.080\nshowing up without me\nhaving to turn off that VM.\n\n187\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.400\nSo that's in the middle of service.\n\n188\n00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.490\nWe can do that.\n\n189\n00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.736\nThe unusual thing though, is that if I\nwanna remove it, I have to power it down.\n\n190\n00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:57.390\n>> [LAUGH] It lets you put it there.\n\n191\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.261\n>> Yeah, it'll let you put it there,\nbut not remove it!\n\n192\n00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.895\n>> But it won't let you take it away\nwithout shutting the thing down.\n\n193\n00:10:00.895 --> 00:10:02.260\nWell, you know what though?\n\n194\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.400\nNormally, if you're decommissioning things\nI guess, it's gonna come down anyway,\n\n195\n00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.337\nbecause if I took away a nick,\n\n196\n00:10:08.337 --> 00:10:11.340\nthen it's losing some sort\nof connection to something.\n\n197\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.570\nSo, it just make sense I guess that it\nwould be powered down at that point.\n\n198\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.710\nBut having the ability to\nactually add something\n\n199\n00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.210\nwithout having to stop\nproduction on the server?\n\n200\n00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.760\n>> Cool.\n>> That is, I'm sold.\n\n201\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.870\nWhere do I sign?\n\n202\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.370\nHow much, where do I write\nthe check out to, cuz that is nice.\n\n203\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.500\n>> Yeah, that is one of the main benefits\nand features, and probably one of the best\n\n204\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.790\nthings that you can actually\nthink about for a small business.\n\n205\n00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.420\nInstead of going yeah, we're gonna have\nto bring down that server for five or\n\n206\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.150\nten minutes while we test\nout this component and see.\n\n207\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.970\nWill it show up?\n\n208\n00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.170\nAnd then it doesn't show up.\n\n209\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.370\nAnd then you have to go,\nwe have to power it down again.\n\n210\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.105\n>> And the server's down for an hour.\n\n211\n00:10:44.105 --> 00:10:45.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, the server's down for an hour.\n\n212\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.940\n>> You name it,\nit ends up happening, okay?\n\n213\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.120\nThere's also what they call\nresource prioritization.\n\n214\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.480\nNow, this is actually new\ninside of the standard edition\n\n215\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.650\nby comparison to what it once was, okay?\n\n216\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.698\nSo, even though you could actually\nget what we call virtual volumes.\n\n217\n00:10:59.698 --> 00:11:02.670\nEssentially allowing you to aggregate\ntogether all of your storage stuff,\n\n218\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.540\nwhich is perfectly great and fine.\n\n219\n00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.852\nBeing able to do what we call cost\nstorage-based policy management.\n\n220\n00:11:07.852 --> 00:11:10.979\nIn other words, Bing would actually\nassigned the way that I want to.\n\n221\n00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:14.181\nNot just because of the way\nthe configuration is, is another thing.\n\n222\n00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:17.990\nNow this actually used to only happen\nin that enterprise edition and above.\n\n223\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.590\nNow they've actually moved it on to\nthe actual standard edition here\n\n224\n00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.690\nas well, okay?\n\n225\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.690\nSo you see that they started actually,\n\n226\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.240\nkind of, all of a sudden,\nthe rest of this stuff here?\n\n227\n00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.930\nYeah, this is all insanely neat stuff\nthat you actually end up seeing\n\n228\n00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.720\nright back here,\nin terms of reliable memory,\n\n229\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.463\nBig Data Extensions for\nworking with, well, big data, right?\n\n230\n00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:39.460\n[LAUGH] Hadoop data and stuff like that.\n\n231\n00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.570\nYou see it, and all these extra kind\nof very advanced features that you see,\n\n232\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.650\nsuch as the storage\ndistributed resource scheduler,\n\n233\n00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.270\nthat allows you to manage\nit based on policy.\n\n234\n00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.920\nThere's a lot more that actually\ngoes here that's very fast.\n\n235\n00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.350\nAgain, allow for\nseamless ideas here, okay?\n\n236\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.660\nThe content library gives\nus that ability and so\n\n237\n00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.140\nI'm not gonna go through this for\nevery single one,\n\n238\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.220\nbut at least on the standard here we will,\ncuz there's a few areas here.\n\n239\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:11.210\nContent Library allows us to be able\nto have ISOs, files, and stuff.\n\n240\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.800\nAnd you might say,\nwell of course we need those things.\n\n241\n00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.870\nWell, on your server, right?\n\n242\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.200\nIf you have more than one ESX host server,\n\n243\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.350\nyou only really have one content library\nthat essentially is central repository.\n\n244\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.270\nBut the nice thing is, content library is,\nonce you actually start getting multiple\n\n245\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.790\nESX servers,\nit can become distributed, okay?\n\n246\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.520\nAnd that means it doesn't matter which\none of those servers that it's on,\n\n247\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.760\nyou can gain access to it.\n\n248\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.240\nAnd so that's why it's also\nan important feature as well.\n\n249\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.370\nSame thing with array integrations, too.\n\n250\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.320\nBeing able to add that in.\n\n251\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.880\nSo usually,\nwhen you start taking a look at features,\n\n252\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.860\nmost of us that are working\nin a fairly small office,\n\n253\n00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.440\nthe standard is probably going to be\nthe way that you end up seeing that.\n\n254\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.590\nNow here's something else that's actually\nkind of neat as well, is that when you\n\n255\n00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.920\nstart taking away that Standard Edition,\nnotice it says one per CPU.\n\n256\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.590\nOkay?\n\n257\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.633\nNow this is actually important here\nwhen we start talking about the cost and\n\n258\n00:13:06.633 --> 00:13:07.730\nthe price, right?\n\n259\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.582\nOne per CPU.\n\n260\n00:13:08.582 --> 00:13:11.696\nIt doesn't mean that,\nif I have a quad-core processor,\n\n261\n00:13:11.696 --> 00:13:14.810\nright, that I have to buy\nfour separate licenses.\n\n262\n00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.120\nIt's actually the socket itself,\nthe one CPU here.\n\n263\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.178\nBut if you happen to have multiple sockets\nthough, you're gonna pay the price for it.\n\n264\n00:13:22.178 --> 00:13:24.553\nAnd then you do need to make sure\nyou pay attention to that now.\n\n265\n00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:26.184\nNot so much for the exam,\n\n266\n00:13:26.184 --> 00:13:30.250\nbut it is something that can\nkinda get you in real life.\n\n267\n00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.280\nIf you go, no, I didn't know,\nI just bought it for my server and\n\n268\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.610\nit's only actually\nallowing me to virtualize.\n\n269\n00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.710\nWell it says that I need\nan additional license.\n\n270\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.770\nWell, that's why.\n\n271\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:40.420\nOkay?\n\n272\n00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.365\nYeah.\n>> And they're definitely starting to\n\n273\n00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:46.067\naddress the fact that they realize that\nyou have quad core processors out there.\n\n274\n00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:48.386\nAnd a lot, not just VM ware.\n\n275\n00:13:48.386 --> 00:13:49.239\nEverybody's doing it.\n\n276\n00:13:49.239 --> 00:13:50.340\n>> Everybody.\n>> They're saying, hey,\n\n277\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.720\nyou need to pay for all those cores.\n\n278\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.140\nSo look [COUGH] excuse me,\nlook for that in the future.\n\n279\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.060\n>> Right.\n\n280\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.030\nThe Enterprise Plus here,\nwhen we start taking a look at that,\n\n281\n00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.500\nthat one actually does have more\ndetailed resource management, and\n\n282\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.390\nactually can keep your applications up and\nmoving much more efficiently as well.\n\n283\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.730\nYou'll see it has all of the same features\nas what the actual standard edition does.\n\n284\n00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.980\nBut then when it comes down to\nthese resource prioritzations,\n\n285\n00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.090\nwhat is that about?\n\n286\n00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.870\nWell we realize that inside of our\nvirtualized environment, we're gonna have\n\n287\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:29.300\nsome servers that absolutely demand more\nresources than other servers ever will.\n\n288\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.796\nWell what this resource management\nactually gives us the ability to do,\n\n289\n00:14:32.796 --> 00:14:34.750\nis to say, we can assign that.\n\n290\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.475\nWe can actually pick and say, hey look,\n\n291\n00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:40.290\nhere's what we can do, we'll say that\nthis server, this server, this server,\n\n292\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.800\nis gonna be able to actually have more\nresources on demand if they want to.\n\n293\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.630\nOr I can schedule it.\n\n294\n00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.250\nLet's say I realize that there's\na certain time of day that\n\n295\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.120\neverybody is hitting our web servers.\n\n296\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.630\nI can say hey,\n\n297\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.655\nI don't want that particular server\nto have all the resources, and\n\n298\n00:14:52.655 --> 00:14:57.200\nactually even scrunch down on resources,\nwhich I know, it's not gonna be very busy.\n\n299\n00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.000\nSo imagine having that\ncapability on demand to be\n\n300\n00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.020\nable to do stuff like that as well.\n\n301\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.650\nAnd there's even more features here,\n\n302\n00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.890\nwhich we'll get into in\na later series as well, okay?\n\n303\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.080\nSo, we're gonna talk about\nvirtual volumes later on.\n\n304\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.350\nWe'll take a look at briefly\nthe storage-based management here.\n\n305\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.120\nAnd then we'll talk about storage DNS and\nstorage I/O control as well as\n\n306\n00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.130\nNetwork I/O Control that allows us\nto actually be able to manage that,\n\n307\n00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.170\nthe resource distributions the way\nthat we want to much better, too.\n\n308\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.670\nAnd again,\nthe Content Library is still there.\n\n309\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.270\nAnd this time it also gives us the ability\nto create what we call a distributed\n\n310\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.780\nswitch, instead of a standard switch.\n\n311\n00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.910\nSo we can virtualize even our switches and\nbe able to manage them\n\n312\n00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.490\nmuch more efficiently by\nusing the distributed switch.\n\n313\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.410\nWhich means they can actually\nbe connected to anywhere, and\n\n314\n00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:50.590\nallow us to be able to manage\nthe resource there as one big management.\n\n315\n00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.143\nNow, when it comes down to\nthe newest editions here,\n\n316\n00:15:53.143 --> 00:15:56.663\nthis of course is the premium edition\nthat we'll actually end up seeing,\n\n317\n00:15:56.663 --> 00:15:58.842\nlet's see if I can scroll over, I can't.\n\n318\n00:15:58.842 --> 00:16:01.534\nHere, so we might actually have to kinda-\n>> Just push over with your mouse.\n\n319\n00:16:01.534 --> 00:16:02.510\n>> Yeah, there we go.\n\n320\n00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.076\nJust a little bit more, there we go.\n\n321\n00:16:03.076 --> 00:16:04.336\nOkay.\n\n322\n00:16:04.336 --> 00:16:05.394\nSo there it is.\n\n323\n00:16:05.394 --> 00:16:06.981\nThis one has every feature.\n\n324\n00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:08.281\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n325\n00:16:08.281 --> 00:16:12.080\nIf you need everything,\nthis is the one to actually go with.\n\n326\n00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.530\nBut remember that there's still a few\nother extras that you can add in there for\n\n327\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:20.770\nan additional cost and all of this is\nalso based off of that vCenter Server\n\n328\n00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.430\nthat you'll still have\nto buy on top of that.\n\n329\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.150\nIf you need that management capability,\n\n330\n00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.180\nif you're gonna do this can\nyou actually run all these?\n\n331\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.620\nYes, but you still need to actually\npurchase all that stuff to do it.\n\n332\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.480\nNow here it does go through everything and\n\n333\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.980\nwe of course are not gonna actually be\ncovering every little bit of everything.\n\n334\n00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.240\nIf you want to actually do that, make sure\nyou go on beyond the idea of the VCA and\n\n335\n00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.590\ngo to the VCP and\neven higher if you're gonna do that.\n\n336\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:51.078\nBut just realize that those are some of\nthe different additions that you will be\n\n337\n00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:51.800\nfacing.\n\n338\n00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.970\nNow when we take a look though,\n\n339\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.160\nhere's what I also wanted us\nto focus in on a little bit.\n\n340\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.550\nNow, this is not necessarily for the exam.\n\n341\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.510\nBut, it does help you to hit home\nwhen start saying all right,\n\n342\n00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.380\nwe need to make a decision on this.\n\n343\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.700\nHow much is it gonna cost us?\n\n344\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.650\nWell, that's where you can come and\nyou can start seeing this,too.\n\n345\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.770\nSo right as of he recording of\nthis episode, here's the prices.\n\n346\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.767\nI can't tell you is not going to change,\ncuz I don't make their policies.\n\n347\n00:17:17.767 --> 00:17:21.421\nSo we'll let them make their policy cuz\nit's a great product that they have\n\n348\n00:17:21.421 --> 00:17:22.067\navailable.\n\n349\n00:17:22.067 --> 00:17:24.755\nBut you can see some of\nthese pricings here and\n\n350\n00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:28.040\nthese are all done in terms\nof US dollars for right now.\n\n351\n00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.420\nBut the baseline product,\nit starts off pretty hefty, but\n\n352\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.270\nonce you actually do that.\n\n353\n00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.680\nSo this is about a $1000 right\nhere just for that standard.\n\n354\n00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.360\nNotice that that also\nmeans one year support and\n\n355\n00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.450\nsubscription after you buy that base one,\nwell\n\n356\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.920\nnotice that you still have to actually\npay an additional yearly contract or fee.\n\n357\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.039\nIf you're gonna be doing this, and\nthen if you go to the highest one here,\n\n358\n00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.510\nthat's what [INAUDIBLE].\n\n359\n00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.710\nNow, you think $1000 is steep,\nbut remember that you\n\n360\n00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.230\nstill have to actually go back in and\neven purchase that V center.\n\n361\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.090\nAnd I can't remember, there it is, okay.\n\n362\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:06.830\nSo, all I need on top of that\nis V Center Server Standard.\n\n363\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:07.560\nLook at that.\n\n364\n00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.268\nThat's an additional five.\n\n365\n00:18:09.268 --> 00:18:12.480\nAnd then an additional\nthousand per user as well.\n\n366\n00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.100\nSo, can this stuff get costly?\n\n367\n00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.060\nYes.\n\n368\n00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.940\nBut this is a question that\nDaniel asked in other episodes.\n\n369\n00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.199\nHow much is your data worth?\n\n370\n00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:23.680\nAnd that's why companies are gonna\npay whatever they need to pay.\n\n371\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.264\nAnd the reason why is\ncuz this is the premium,\n\n372\n00:18:26.264 --> 00:18:28.930\nthis is the top of the line product here.\n\n373\n00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.710\nWe're not knocking any\nother person's product.\n\n374\n00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.740\nBut VMware what they\nspecialize in is what?\n\n375\n00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.640\nVirtualization.\n\n376\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.410\nIf you want the premium product\nit does a cost a bit here.\n\n377\n00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.314\nNow of course along with that,\n\n378\n00:18:41.314 --> 00:18:46.020\nthey actually do have some additions\nthat you might actually end up doing.\n\n379\n00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.770\nAnd this actually goes beyond\nthat standard addition here.\n\n380\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.070\nIf I scroll down, we're not really\nworried about there's a central.\n\n381\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.820\nBut you will also see it mentioned,\n\n382\n00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.090\nespecially in the exam about\nwhat we call Acceleration Kits.\n\n383\n00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.240\nAnd this is because the bigger your data\ncenter grows, the more it spreads out.\n\n384\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.360\nWell, even software has a limitation.\n\n385\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.830\nAnd so, here they're saying,\n\n386\n00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.700\nlook, you may actually end up having to\ndo what we call these Acceleration Kits.\n\n387\n00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.360\nAnd now this is where all of a sudden,\nit becomes choking\n\n388\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.470\nto actually go base license\nonly [LAUGH] is what it says.\n\n389\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:24.220\nLicense price only, and then each year you\ncan see where all of the sudden it costs.\n\n390\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.880\nAnd I'm not trying to\nscare you away from it.\n\n391\n00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.490\nHey your company, if you put the value\ninside your data center, it's worth it.\n\n392\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.430\n>> Well, Ronnie, and\nthis also comes down to the fact that\n\n393\n00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.580\na smaller shop probably is not going\nto require those acceleration features.\n\n394\n00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.830\nLarger enterprise environments, they will.\n\n395\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.680\nAnd this is still much less expensive\nthan going the traditional route.\n\n396\n00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.050\nDon't let those prices scare you off and\ngo my goodness,\n\n397\n00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.590\nI'm having heart palpitations.\n\n398\n00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:57.120\n20 something thousand dollars plus\n$6,000 a year in maintenance fees and\n\n399\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.180\nthings of that nature.\n\n400\n00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.730\nYeah, it seems like a lot but, I was\ntelling Ronnie at the insurance company I\n\n401\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.219\nworked for, our IT budget per\nyear was over $2.5 million.\n\n402\n00:20:04.219 --> 00:20:06.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that was a drop in the bucket.\n\n403\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:07.600\nIt was like yeah, so\n\n404\n00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.580\nthis is just the base stuff that we\nneed to make our environment work.\n\n405\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.810\nOkay, yeah, we get that.\n\n406\n00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:12.970\nWhat else do we need to do?\n\n407\n00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.025\nIt was an easy sign off because previous\nyears we had to make it $4 million.\n\n408\n00:20:18.025 --> 00:20:19.030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n409\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.300\n>> We had to have it.\n\n410\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.290\nWe kept trying to find ways to\nreduce costs and when ESX came out,\n\n411\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.192\nwe discovered VMware.\n\n412\n00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:29.690\nIt's just dramatically\nreduced the amount of cost.\n\n413\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.510\nWe did server consolidation.\n\n414\n00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.120\nIt saved us so much money.\n\n415\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.810\nIt's really crazy.\n\n416\n00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.720\n>> And don't forget that even though\nthat even though this is the base things\n\n417\n00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.670\nto make it really work the way\nyou want to, we're also going\n\n418\n00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.940\nto mention briefly in the rest of our\nseries here something called vRealize.\n\n419\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.145\nNow, if you're familiar with the older,\nif you've been working with it.\n\n420\n00:20:48.145 --> 00:20:53.040\nAn older edition used to be called\nvCenter Operations Manager, but\n\n421\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.610\ntoday they call it vRealize\nOperations Manager.\n\n422\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.510\nAnd so we'll see features of that,\nand that is another additional thing.\n\n423\n00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.610\nSo just thinking that, hey, I'll just\nbuy vSphere and it's going to work.\n\n424\n00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.320\nWell, remember that has to be built\non top of that vCenter and also,\n\n425\n00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.620\nof course, underlying all that\nis actually that ESX, that ESXI.\n\n426\n00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.540\nThe hypervisor itself which is\nalso something else we need\n\n427\n00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.550\nto spend a little bit of time doing.\n\n428\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.190\nNow, by just saying that,\nwell, if I buy that,\n\n429\n00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.780\nwhat does it really help me to overcome?\n\n430\n00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.690\nWhat is it that I really have to do and\nthat's what we actually wanna talk about\n\n431\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.540\nfor the remainder, cuz since we\nactually did title the show Challenges.\n\n432\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.500\n>> That's exactly right, and\nthat does bring up a good point.\n\n433\n00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.700\nNow that we understand what we would need,\nand\n\n434\n00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:40.280\nsee the different versions of VMware\nthat we might work with, vSphere.\n\n435\n00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.380\nNow it comes down to the challenges,\nhow does that become a solution.\n\n436\n00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.860\nAnd what is a solution too?\n\n437\n00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.690\nAnd what challenges does it address?\n\n438\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.310\nAnd Ronnie I guess the best place\nto start is management challenges.\n\n439\n00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:54.180\n>> Right, when we start taking a look at\nmanagement challenges, a lot of times in\n\n440\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.520\nterms of management, it's some of\nthe things that really bug us.\n\n441\n00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.940\nDaniel, let's see if this\nhas ever happened to you.\n\n442\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.770\nWe buy a piece of software, and you get\nthem installed on several machines and\n\n443\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.190\nthen six months later it needs\nto be reinstalled again.\n\n444\n00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.555\nDaniel, where's that piece of software?\n\n445\n00:22:10.555 --> 00:22:12.170\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n446\n00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:17.510\nhopefully I've got maybe an ISO on a file\nshare or something of that nature.\n\n447\n00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.740\nThat's typically what you would do.\n\n448\n00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.680\n>> Yeah, that's what you would\nthink would end up happening.\n\n449\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.150\nI start off with before the idea of ISOs\ncame along and you just have the disc.\n\n450\n00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.970\n>> Yeah.\n>> And who copies disc?\n\n451\n00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:29.777\n>> Not many anymore.\n\n452\n00:22:29.777 --> 00:22:31.687\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, not many anymore.\n\n453\n00:22:31.687 --> 00:22:35.419\nBut I remember days when we would actually\ntake that one master disc and essentially\n\n454\n00:22:35.419 --> 00:22:39.670\nmake multiple copies of it so we wouldn't\nscratch that what, that one master disc.\n\n455\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.860\nAnd that way if we were\ninstalling operating systems,\n\n456\n00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.390\nwhatever it was, we had four or five\nsitting around and all of a sudden a month\n\n457\n00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.370\nlater we see one of those discs, and\nthey're like what's this doing out here?\n\n458\n00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.850\nWe don't know, okay?\n\n459\n00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.540\nWell one of the things that is\nactually a challenge for us of course,\n\n460\n00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.860\nis what we call a repositories.\n\n461\n00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.340\nIn other words,\nwhere do we tend to store all that stuff.\n\n462\n00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.060\nAnd then how do we get it to people?\n\n463\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.450\nWell when you're off site,\nyou call up Daniel and\n\n464\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.120\nDaniel says yeah,\nI'm gonna put it in the share.\n\n465\n00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.350\nThat's what we would do today.\n\n466\n00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.860\nJust access it from the share.\n\n467\n00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:14.600\nBut back when I started it was I can\nsend you a DVD of it and it'd get there\n\n468\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.860\nin three days and hopefully you get it and\nit's not scratched and not anything else.\n\n469\n00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.240\nBut repositories are actually\nvery difficult to keep track of.\n\n470\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.720\nAnd then what if you actually setup some\ntype of replication and didn't happen.\n\n471\n00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.210\nSo, between your site and another site\nthat's actually pretty far off here\n\n472\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.950\nyou go no, it should be on the chair.\n\n473\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.340\nIt's not on the chair, it should be\non the chair it's not on the chair.\n\n474\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.060\nWell, how do you deal with\nthat replication issue.\n\n475\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.360\nWell the nice thing is,\nin the way that we actually worked today,\n\n476\n00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.160\nsome of the challenges that we have\nof course are things like that.\n\n477\n00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.960\nThe other one is licensing as well, okay?\n\n478\n00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.250\nLicensing and the ability of keeping track\nof all those licenses that we tend to\n\n479\n00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.853\nactually push out there, it's nightmarish.\n\n480\n00:23:51.853 --> 00:23:56.283\nMy first instance of this was really\nhaving to deal with the newer licensing\n\n481\n00:23:56.283 --> 00:24:00.663\nmodel that happened in Microsoft with\ntheir desktop operating systems.\n\n482\n00:24:00.663 --> 00:24:05.112\nYou had MAK keys, you had KMS keys\nThe ability to keep track of how many\n\n483\n00:24:05.112 --> 00:24:07.893\nlicences went out versus how many came in.\n\n484\n00:24:07.893 --> 00:24:10.682\nMake a little tool that says well this\nshould keep track of it for you and\n\n485\n00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:13.160\nall of a sudden you store out licenses.\n\n486\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:18.500\nWell those are some of the challenges that\nwe face inside of virtualization as well.\n\n487\n00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.940\nLicensing the idea of repositories and\n\n488\n00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.410\nbeing able to get access\nto them when we need them.\n\n489\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.610\nBig gigantic challenges\nthat are out there.\n\n490\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.892\nThe good thing is with VMWare's vSphere,\nright,\n\n491\n00:24:28.892 --> 00:24:34.210\nthey actually do build this stuff into\nthe actual vSphere component itself.\n\n492\n00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.780\nThere is something that we call\nthe content library, okay.\n\n493\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.570\nAnd we're gonna get into\nthat a little bit more.\n\n494\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.230\nBut with the content library,\n\n495\n00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.300\nwe're gonna see that that's some of\nthe features that are built into vSphere\n\n496\n00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.590\nthat really do help us to be able\nto distribute that when we need it.\n\n497\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.040\nAnd that way on the ESX host,\nit doesn't matter where that host is.\n\n498\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.480\nIf it's part of that original cluster\nthat we have, it doesn't matter.\n\n499\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.450\nWe can actually say,\nyou can get access to it,\n\n500\n00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.270\neven if it doesn't reside on that same\ndata store, that same data share.\n\n501\n00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.760\nThe idea of the content\nlibrary is a big one.\n\n502\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.030\nThe same thing here with\nthe idea of licensing.\n\n503\n00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:08.710\nThere is something that we call the PSC,\nthe Platform Services Control.\n\n504\n00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.400\nI wanna make sure I read that right.\n\n505\n00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.260\nAnd that helps you to manage\nall the licenses that you need\n\n506\n00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.990\ninside of the virtualization\nplatform as well.\n\n507\n00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.042\nThat way you're not hunting\naround like I used to do.\n\n508\n00:25:18.042 --> 00:25:22.382\nWe should just keep little sheets of\npaper and stuff it inside of a folder.\n\n509\n00:25:22.382 --> 00:25:24.490\nAnd hopefully that we could\nactually find it again.\n\n510\n00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.940\nWell, now instead of course,\nwe can use something like this.\n\n511\n00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.520\nThat can keep track of\nthe licensing expenditure\n\n512\n00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.950\nas well as what licenses are out there.\n\n513\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.410\nManagement challenges like\nthat are actually things\n\n514\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.010\naren't really related to virtualization.\n\n515\n00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.890\nBut the guys at VMWare said,\nno it really is.\n\n516\n00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.980\nIt can actually kind of affect whether or\nnot you can build a VM.\n\n517\n00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.680\nIf you don't have access\nto the right ISOs,\n\n518\n00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.680\nyou don't have access to the right files,\nthen it doesn't help.\n\n519\n00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.940\nSame thing with licenses.\n\n520\n00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.290\nYou can actually have all\nthe ISOs where you want, but\n\n521\n00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.930\nwhat if you can't track down the license?\n\n522\n00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.800\nWell, that's why we actually have this.\n\n523\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.910\nSo even inside of challenges that we\nface for data center virtualization,\n\n524\n00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.550\njust some of the management stuff that\nVMWare, vSphere really helps us do.\n\n525\n00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.480\nIt's kind of amazing.\n\n526\n00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.890\n>> Yeah,\nit's definitely an awesome product.\n\n527\n00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.770\nThey give us, they had a lot of\nforethought when they put this thing\n\n528\n00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.000\ntogether and\nthey try to address just about everything.\n\n529\n00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.900\nAnother topic that they addressed as far\nas challenges goes, is scalability and\n\n530\n00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.850\nthis is probably their bread and butter.\n\n531\n00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.460\nTheir ability to scale your\nenvironment at any given time\n\n532\n00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.550\nis incredible, right Ronnie?\n\n533\n00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.190\n>> It really is, they talk about in\nterms and these are the two terms you\n\n534\n00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.920\nwanna make sure you're familiar with,\nscaling up and scaling out.\n\n535\n00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:33.960\nNow I scale out fairly well every time I\neat a meal but scaling up not so much so.\n\n536\n00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.240\nWell, is there a real big difference?\n\n537\n00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.670\nNot overall in the result, right?\n\n538\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.180\nThe idea of scaling out of course is\nthat you wanna build your business and\n\n539\n00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.420\nbe able to scale out and\nimprove your marketplace.\n\n540\n00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.640\nThe idea of scaling up of\ncourse is meeting the demand\n\n541\n00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.860\nthat you currently have.\n\n542\n00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.900\nJust being able to do\nsome when you need to.\n\n543\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.830\nWell, inside of those, right,\nwhen we start taking a look at that idea,\n\n544\n00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.172\nwe wanna avoid of course\ndowntime as much as possible.\n\n545\n00:26:56.172 --> 00:26:59.310\nWe wanna make sure we avoid\nany extended downtime, right?\n\n546\n00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.536\nSometimes downtime happens and\n\n547\n00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:02.720\nwe actually want to address\nthis as quickly as possibly.\n\n548\n00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.888\nBut what we don't want to do is actually\ngo all right, the down time happened,\n\n549\n00:27:05.888 --> 00:27:07.830\nwe said it'd be up in five minutes.\n\n550\n00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:08.670\nWe are not up in 15.\n\n551\n00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.040\nWe are not up in an hour, but\n\n552\n00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.540\nwe wanna actually try to remove\nthat as much as we can too.\n\n553\n00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.080\nAnd then also\n\n554\n00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.990\nis all the stuff that we have available\nacross everything that want replication.\n\n555\n00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.530\nThese are also additional challenges\nas far as scalability goes.\n\n556\n00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:25.450\nNetwork utilization.\n\n557\n00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:30.120\nThe more that we scale, the smaller\nour bandwidth may actually end up\n\n558\n00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.770\nbeing kind of stretched out there as we\nutilize more of our current bandwidth.\n\n559\n00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.750\nSo, VMWare's vSphere also\nhas additional solutions for\n\n560\n00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.990\nthis in terms of high availability and\nfault tolerance to ensure\n\n561\n00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:47.210\nthat we actually don't have to worry about\nthis even as we continue to scale, right?\n\n562\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.800\nSo that our machines that\nare currently operating will always be\n\n563\n00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.080\nable to be operating\nthe way that we want to.\n\n564\n00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.300\nThere's also a technology called vSphere\nReplication that allows us to say,\n\n565\n00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.180\nhey, when we actually do scale up,\nwe can actually have all of our data\n\n566\n00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.680\nreplicated to those sites without\nhaving to worry about it as well.\n\n567\n00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.390\nAnd then incremental types of backups\nthat we call the data protection,\n\n568\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.850\nthe ability to ensure that we don't\nlose our data, even as we scale.\n\n569\n00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.670\nAnd so there's actually a lot more\nfeatures that are actually available here,\n\n570\n00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.370\nbut these are some of those challenges\nthat we have to actually deal with in\n\n571\n00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.970\nterms of scalability to make\nsure that we can meet them.\n\n572\n00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.410\nVMWare, of course,\nsays we have the solution for you.\n\n573\n00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:29.910\n>> Yeah, and as you can see, the people\nat VMWare are taking the approach of,\n\n574\n00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.130\nwe don't want you to go anywhere else.\n\n575\n00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.700\nWe want you to just come here, we have\nall your fears and woes taken care of.\n\n576\n00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.570\nJust let VMWare handle things for\nyou and you know what?\n\n577\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.440\nThey've done a really good job.\n\n578\n00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.090\nI'm not trying to like be a fan boy or\nwhatever but I'm kind of a fan boy.\n\n579\n00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:50.299\nI've used this product and\nI know how well and easy make your life,\n\n580\n00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:56.220\nwhich is exponentially grander,\nwhen you start utilizing these things.\n\n581\n00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.170\nNow we're talking about\ndifferent challenges.\n\n582\n00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.760\nAnother one of the different challenges\nthat we come across is the optimization.\n\n583\n00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.910\nRight?\nWe have to make these networks and\n\n584\n00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.260\nthese environments,\nshould I say, highly tuned.\n\n585\n00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:12.760\nWe have to put the right amount of\ngas to air ratio, right Ronnie?\n\n586\n00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.050\n>> You definitely have to, right?\n\n587\n00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.960\nThe very fact is if we don't\none center actually becomes\n\n588\n00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.600\nover utilized while another center\ndoesn't actually become utilized at all.\n\n589\n00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.200\nWell, how do you keep track of all that?\n\n590\n00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.100\nHow do actually keep monitoring all that?\n\n591\n00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:28.711\nWell, there's that Vrealize product\nthat we actually can end up using and\n\n592\n00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:33.030\ntheir operations manager is kind\nof the featured show piece, right,\n\n593\n00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.466\nof the management side or everything.\n\n594\n00:29:35.466 --> 00:29:39.463\nDon't get me wrong, vSphere itself, right,\ngives us a ton of the products that we\n\n595\n00:29:39.463 --> 00:29:42.376\nneed to ensure that we have\nthe infrastructure available and\n\n596\n00:29:42.376 --> 00:29:44.390\nto ensure the basic connections.\n\n597\n00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:48.400\nBut if you wanna tweak it and\nfine tune it like Daniel is talking about,\n\n598\n00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.110\nliterally changing those knobs to actually\nmake sure you have the proper mix and\n\n599\n00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:55.790\nratio of what needs to happen\nacross your entire data center.\n\n600\n00:29:55.790 --> 00:30:00.000\nWell that's where that vSphere operations\nmanger comes in for you as well.\n\n601\n00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.083\nSo when you need to be able to do\nthe monitoring, you need to be able to do\n\n602\n00:30:04.083 --> 00:30:08.200\nthose tuning operations,\nthat's where that idea of that vRealize.\n\n603\n00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:14.830\nRemember that the old term there is the\nvCenter operations now called vRealize.\n\n604\n00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.430\nOn each of these that we've talked about,\nwe will actually be mentioning them again.\n\n605\n00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.270\nSo if you're going, like,\nman you just zoomed through that.\n\n606\n00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.350\nIt's fine, you're gonna see in our next\nseries of episodes, we're gonna kind of\n\n607\n00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:27.520\nstop on each one, talk about them briefly,\nmake sure you understand the features.\n\n608\n00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.250\nAs well as some of the different\nthings that it helps us to do again.\n\n609\n00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:35.090\nSo we'll kinda go over this list over and\nover again is what you will hear but\n\n610\n00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.120\nmuch more in detail.\n\n611\n00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.490\nAnd we'll talk about why those features\nare actually good and grand for us.\n\n612\n00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.560\n>> Yeah, we look forward to that, Ronnie.\n\n613\n00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.520\nLooking at the clock though, and\nwe've gabbed around about VMWare for\n\n614\n00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.000\nquite some time now and our episode's\ncoming to an end quite quickly.\n\n615\n00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.785\nBut we do thank you for stopping by, we\nthank you for exploring these things with\n\n616\n00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:56.794\nus, showing us the the path that\nVMWare has laid out before us.\n\n617\n00:30:56.794 --> 00:30:58.687\nSo we can get the right solution and\n\n618\n00:30:58.687 --> 00:31:02.455\naddress those challenges that\nwe may meet in our environment.\n\n619\n00:31:02.455 --> 00:31:05.920\nI'm really looking forward to seeing a\nlittle more of the depth that we get into\n\n620\n00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.665\nin later shows.\n\n621\n00:31:06.665 --> 00:31:08.645\nWell, we thank you again for stopping by.\n\n622\n00:31:08.645 --> 00:31:09.997\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n623\n00:31:09.997 --> 00:31:12.165\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n624\n00:31:12.165 --> 00:31:13.715\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n625\n00:31:13.715 --> 00:31:14.445\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n626\n00:31:14.445 --> 00:31:15.948\n>> We will see you next time.\n\n627\n00:31:15.948 --> 00:31:24.280\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:17.877\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:21.340\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe're continuing on with our VCA series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.580\nJoining us back in the studio again for\na little help with that,\n\n6\n00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.500\nis our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.090\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.760\n>> Well thank you.\n\n9\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.960\nIt's a great day to be right here as\nwe continue on with the VCA 6 series.\n\n10\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.370\nToday we're actually jumping into the\nactual technology I've been promising that\n\n11\n00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.660\nwe're gonna jump into, which of course\nis the idea here of vSphere and\n\n12\n00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.800\nsome of the technologies\nthat we are gonna deal with.\n\n13\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.750\nAnd the reason why we have to do this, of\ncourse, is because really the whole idea,\n\n14\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.150\nright, is to get you working more\nwith actually working with vSphere.\n\n15\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.080\nBut before we do that,\n\n16\n00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.860\nwe want to make sure, of course, that you\nunderstand some of those technologies.\n\n17\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.620\nWe took a look at some of\nthe different editions and\n\n18\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.220\ntalked about some of those\ntechnologies just briefly.\n\n19\n00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.180\nToday, we're gonna get a little bit\nfurther into it, we're not going into the,\n\n20\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.945\nof course, every technicality.\n\n21\n00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:07.710\nBut I wanna make sure that you understand\nwhat these particular topics are that you\n\n22\n00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.610\ncan identify them and understand what\nthe features are behind them, and\n\n23\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210\nthat's what we're actually\ntaking a look at.\n\n24\n00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.090\nSo, let's start off in the very beginning\nhere when we start taking a look\n\n25\n00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.650\nat identifying some of these components\nfor data center virtualization.\n\n26\n00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.330\nFirst one we want to take a look at here,\nof course is the, hypervisor itself, so\n\n27\n00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.240\nlet's go ahead and do so.\n\n28\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.460\nLet's take a look at my screen, and\n\n29\n00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.310\nthat will help us to get\nsetup the way that we need.\n\n30\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.790\nNow, when it comes down to it, we've\ntalked about hypervisor in general, but\n\n31\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.745\nin terms terms of VMware,\n\n32\n00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:38.295\nyou're actually going to use\na hypervisor that's called ESXI.\n\n33\n00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:41.435\nAnd I don't know, I'm gonna start\nflipping those letters around,\n\n34\n00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.466\nI can feel it in my head.\n\n35\n00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:43.987\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That that's not actually gonna\n\n36\n00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:44.494\ncome out right.\n\n37\n00:01:44.494 --> 00:01:45.467\n>> That's gonna be bad, Ronnie.\n\n38\n00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:46.065\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know.\n\n39\n00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:47.635\nIt is.\nIt's not even the same product.\n\n40\n00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:48.675\nThat's the problem.\n\n41\n00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.507\nSo on ESXi,\nthis is our bare metal hypervisor.\n\n42\n00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:54.965\nYou wanna make sure you remember that,\nbecause there's hosted and\n\n43\n00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:57.750\nthere's bare metal,\nthis one is the bare metal hypervisor.\n\n44\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.740\nThe key, here, in understanding and\ngetting ready for also, getting prepared\n\n45\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.500\nfor all of the things that are coming up\nfor you, which includes the exam, that's\n\n46\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.936\nwhy I'm trying to emphasize it without\nsaying that, is maximum capabilities.\n\n47\n00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:13.900\nIf you go ahead and\nset VMware on a single server,\n\n48\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.000\nwhat in the world can ESXi recognize?\n\n49\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.540\nWell, you can actually have a server, and\nI've never seen this, Daniel, you may\n\n50\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.980\nhave, but I've never seen this, an actual\nserver, 480 CPUs, that's a lot of sockets.\n\n51\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.340\n>> I can't say that I've been privy\nto a 480 CPU machine in my life.\n\n52\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.440\n>> 12 terabytes of RAM on a single server.\n\n53\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.820\nYeah, see for him, 12 terabytes,\nyeah, no big deal.\n\n54\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.060\n>> Nobody's got that.\n\n55\n00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.120\n>> Yeah.\nAnd this single one can of course\n\n56\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.620\nhost 2,048 VMs on a single one.\n\n57\n00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.130\nNow, the strange thing is these\nthings can be clustered together, and\n\n58\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.210\non the maximum cluster size,\nyou can actually have up to 8,000\n\n59\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.380\nVMs in a VMWare cluster,\nin an ESXi hosted cluster.\n\n60\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.670\nSo just kind of amazing when you start\ndoing this, when you only go and\n\n61\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.780\nget the idea of ESXi, it's free.\n\n62\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.180\nYou can actually download it for free,\nit's something that you can do, but\n\n63\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.880\nyou don't get any of the other features.\n\n64\n00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.960\nSo in this particular\nmanagement interface,\n\n65\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.260\nthe only thing it's really gonna ask you\nfor is actually a username and a password.\n\n66\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.220\nAnd normally we're gonna set a static\nIP address, that's about it,\n\n67\n00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.110\nI have never actually had to do anything\nelse with just the ESXi server itself.\n\n68\n00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.975\nSo it does allow you to create an initial\ndata store when you actually run through\n\n69\n00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:36.670\nthe install it will say hey, what do you\nactually wanna create as your data store?\n\n70\n00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.930\nYou pick whatever hard drive that's\nactually available to you there and\n\n71\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.080\nthat's where you actually do it and\nthat can be locally to that machine.\n\n72\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.660\nOr it can actually be somewhere\nelse it just depend on what that\n\n73\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.880\nserver recognizes from that point.\n\n74\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.950\nSo yo have a basic client interface\nthat you can actually use and\n\n75\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.820\nyou also have a web interface.\n\n76\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.480\nSo that means once you actually get it\nsetup, you have to go to another machine\n\n77\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.980\nand this is the key kicker,\nyou can't do it from a Mac.\n\n78\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.380\nYou have to be on a Windows machine to\nactually go and do that, now I say that\n\n79\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.220\nthey've changed it if you're gonna try and\nuse this management client.\n\n80\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.120\nSo if you login to the website it's\ngonna give you the ability to download\n\n81\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.760\na management client, and you can do that,\nbut it only runs from a Windows machine.\n\n82\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.930\nIf you use the web interface though you\ncan manage it from where we want to so\n\n83\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.440\nyou can actually take that and\nthen you're up and you're ready to go.\n\n84\n00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.078\nHere is kind of one of the funny things\nhere, with version six of vSphere,\n\n85\n00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:34.740\nthe web interface is actually preferred,\nnot the client interface itself.\n\n86\n00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.020\nSo I wanted to show you that, let me see,\nthat I actually pulled the thing up,\n\n87\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.820\nI think I did here, yeah I did!\n\n88\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.770\nSo inside of, if you go to the VMware\nlearning website, you can actually\n\n89\n00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.526\nregister for this and actually have access\nwhere you can test drive VSphere six.\n\n90\n00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:56.470\nOkay, that's what I actually wanted to\nshow you here is that you can actually do\n\n91\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.960\nsomething like this and be able to\ntest drive this thing right here and\n\n92\n00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.100\nbe able to get access to it as well.\n\n93\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.780\nAnd in ESXi which, what I was trying\nto say here, on the web interface,\n\n94\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.330\nthat's what I wanted to do.\n\n95\n00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.820\nSo I'm there on the web interface,\nI wanted to show everybody something.\n\n96\n00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.160\nIf you download and\ninstall that particular client, and\n\n97\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.000\nlet's see if I can actually zoom in so\nthat you can see this.\n\n98\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.540\nAll vSphere features\nintroduced in vSphere 5.5 and\n\n99\n00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.860\nbeyond are only available\nthrough the actual Web Client.\n\n100\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.450\nSo they're saying hey look, this client is\nstill there cuz we're not changing that,\n\n101\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.970\nbut If you wanna actually use the client,\nyou're gonna see that there's\n\n102\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.440\nsome features that are not gonna\nbe available to you beyond 5.5.\n\n103\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.805\nSo they are pretty much saying,\nlook, we're kind of abandoning that.\n\n104\n00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:46.360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n105\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.780\n>> And so that way you actually just\nsimply open up the web client and\n\n106\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.450\nyou are now ready to go.\n\n107\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.910\nBut take some time and go and register\ninside of VMware's learning website and\n\n108\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.720\nyou actually see as you go through,\nyou have to look for it, but\n\n109\n00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.270\nit'll give you something like this, where\nyou can actually access that as well.\n\n110\n00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.230\nAll right, so\n\n111\n00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.170\nwhen you take a look at that, that's kinda\nthe basic feature for the idea of ESXi.\n\n112\n00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.060\nNow, I wanted to also mention this,\nso if you have your hardware and\n\n113\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.460\nyou tend to run ESXi, the terminology\nthat you're gonna become familiar with\n\n114\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.080\nis what we call an ESXi host.\n\n115\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.600\nDon't want you to mistake that when you\nsee it someplace later on in your future\n\n116\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.230\nwhen they say on this host or on this\nESXi host, what are they referring to?\n\n117\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.350\nThey're referring to what,\n\n118\n00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.810\na server that's running the hypervisor\nis what they are referring to.\n\n119\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.400\nSo don't mistake that when you hear it,\nyour not talking about a VM, that's what I\n\n120\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.950\nwanted to get to, you're actually talking\nabout the physical machine itself.\n\n121\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:48.110\nThat's kind of the underlying\nsoftware that really helps us to run\n\n122\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.320\neverything that we would\nactually have on hand to do so.\n\n123\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.370\nSo that's one of the basic\ntechnologies we should at least know.\n\n124\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.900\n>> Yeah that's right.\n\n125\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.850\nNow, obviously, we have our hypervisor.\n\n126\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.180\nWe have our client that allows\nus to connect to a hypervisor,\n\n127\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.230\nbut we also have a server software to go\nalong with this as well, right Ronnie?\n\n128\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.060\n>> We do, and you might be wondering well,\n\n129\n00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.930\nif I can manage that and create VMs just\nlike you said and build access, at least\n\n130\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.990\nat basic management consolidate and\ndo all that stuff, what else do I need?\n\n131\n00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.500\nWell, this is if your business grows.\n\n132\n00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.250\nSo let me now show you\nanother example instead here.\n\n133\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.480\nThe time that you really\ndo need vCenter Server\n\n134\n00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.020\nis if you know you're\ngonna be running vSphere.\n\n135\n00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.310\nLet's just go ahead and put that,\nif you go I know I need those\n\n136\n00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.590\nfeatures inside of vSphere you gotta\nhave vCenter, you just have to.\n\n137\n00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.880\nWithout vCenter, you don't have\naccess to any of that stuff, so\n\n138\n00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.230\nyou gotta make sure that you do purchase\nand that you are gonna run this.\n\n139\n00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.134\nThe reason why you would run this is\nif you have multiple ESXi hosts and\n\n140\n00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:48.644\nnow you want to actually be able to use\nthe management features inside of vSphere\n\n141\n00:07:48.644 --> 00:07:51.095\nto be able to control\naccess to all of them.\n\n142\n00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:54.732\nSo now you might have a single\ncentralized type of data store\n\n143\n00:07:54.732 --> 00:07:57.640\nin which you actually\ncreate all of your VMs in,\n\n144\n00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.075\nbut you can access them from\nany one of these hosts here.\n\n145\n00:08:01.075 --> 00:08:04.099\nWell the basic management that\nactually conglomerates all that\n\n146\n00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:06.899\ninformation together that gives\nyou that ability to do so,\n\n147\n00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:09.640\nis really that underlying\ntechnology as well.\n\n148\n00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.990\nSo you have now that hyper visor, and then\nif you want to conglomerate everything\n\n149\n00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.630\ntogether with multiple hosts,\ncluster them.\n\n150\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.510\nThis is where it actually begins, is right\nhere using that vCenter server as well.\n\n151\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.140\nSo this allow you to run multiple host,\nallows you to ensure security,\n\n152\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.910\navailability you name it.\n\n153\n00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.050\nManagement task and all this simplified\nbecause it's actually through here that\n\n154\n00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:35.180\nall that is aggregated together and\nthen send to this as well.\n\n155\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.970\nHelp to reduce complexity ans the reason\nwhy if it is not that means you need to go\n\n156\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:44.080\nto every single one of this ESXi\nhost to manage them on their own.\n\n157\n00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.450\nThe other thing that vSphere does at\nthe heart, or the vCenter excuse me,\n\n158\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.030\nat the heart here,\nis that can restart a failed VM, okay,\n\n159\n00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.380\nwithout user intervention.\n\n160\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.630\nSo that means if you have\na VM that locks up and\n\n161\n00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.870\nends up failing You don't\nhave to go in and restart it.\n\n162\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.200\nVcenter service, excuse me,\n\n163\n00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.460\ncan recognize when a VM actually stops\nsending what they call a heartbeat and\n\n164\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.650\nwhen it does that it can say hey I\nneed to actually restart that sucker.\n\n165\n00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.630\nSo if it doesn't sense the heartbeat\nit can actually do that as well.\n\n166\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:19.190\nMonitoring, utilization and if you start\nallocating resources in term of pools.\n\n167\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.080\nThat's where you can also go too.\n\n168\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.630\nSo this thing right here is\nactually a very essential part of\n\n169\n00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.900\neverything that goes on inside of vSphere.\n\n170\n00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.420\nSo remember, the host itself,\nESXi, and the vCenter Server,\n\n171\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.130\nyou're probably never gonna actually\nhave to touch much more besides that,\n\n172\n00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.360\nbecause when you actually launch into\nthat client, you actually did see.\n\n173\n00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.990\nLet me show you if I can see this again,\nhere.\n\n174\n00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.180\nLet me launch it from Google Chrome.\n\n175\n00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.170\nThat's the one that I like using.\n\n176\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.790\nNo, I'm lying to you.\n\n177\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.110\nI was going to say normally it\nactually just launches right up there.\n\n178\n00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.380\nThere it goes, okay.\n\n179\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.310\nSo it says vSphere web client and you\ncan see where it's actually taking you.\n\n180\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.920\nIt says VMware vCenter Sign-on.\n\n181\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.350\nSo it's actually trying to connect\ninto that software right away and\n\n182\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.950\ngive you all the management\nfeatures that you're looking for.\n\n183\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.850\nSo you can also end up\nseeing stuff like that.\n\n184\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.510\nSo there is a lot of that that's actually\nthere as far as some of the benefits and\n\n185\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.970\nsome of the features go.\n\n186\n00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.580\nBut right here these are kinda\nthe two underlying technologies.\n\n187\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.510\nNot the flashy end of things.\n\n188\n00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.190\nBut, at the same time,\nwithout this, you can't do it.\n\n189\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.570\n>> That's right, and\nthis is definitely the meat and potatoes,\n\n190\n00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:31.530\nthe basics of getting the VMware\nenvironment into your actual environment.\n\n191\n00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.060\nNow, that being said, we're talking about\nhow this is working for us, and what we\n\n192\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:40.000\nneed to know about VMware using V Sphere\nand the clients and all of the good stuff.\n\n193\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.250\nBut one of the main things that comes up\na lot, and as much as we'd like to, and\n\n194\n00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.690\nthis does help us out with consolidation,\n\n195\n00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.880\neventually you're probably\ngoing to buy another server.\n\n196\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.350\nOr you're going to have, or you're going\nto get a server that's more robust.\n\n197\n00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.200\nIt's got better hardware.\n\n198\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.887\nIt's got better processor CPU,\nor not better processor CPU.\n\n199\n00:10:55.887 --> 00:10:56.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Same thing.\n\n200\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.760\nMemory.\n\n201\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.090\nThose types of things.\n\n202\n00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.050\nAnd I want to take what I\nhave on this server and\n\n203\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.370\nI want to move it over to that one.\n\n204\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.700\nThat's the foundation of the NAS.\n\n205\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.060\nThere's many ways in which we would,\nI'm talking about migration.\n\n206\n00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.790\nI'm migrating virtual\nmachines to all sorts of\n\n207\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.590\nresources that the VMware system uses.\n\n208\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.790\nHow do I do that?\n\n209\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.446\nAnd they've really made this.\n\n210\n00:11:17.446 --> 00:11:18.328\nAlmost idiot proof.\n\n211\n00:11:18.328 --> 00:11:20.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's amazing, isn't it?\n\n212\n00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.180\n>> This is by far one of the, I think it's\none of the neatest technologies that's out\n\n213\n00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.680\nthere, when you do visualize,\nwhen you are running that vCenter server,\n\n214\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.190\nand you've got multiple\nEXI servers ready to go.\n\n215\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.550\nLet me show you what\nDaniel was mentioning.\n\n216\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.810\nWe have a technology\nunderlying everything,\n\n217\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.860\nalso that's actually built into\nvSphere that's called vMotion.\n\n218\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.440\nSo when you actually do install it,\nit gives you this ability to do this.\n\n219\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.340\nNow what Daniel's talking about,\n\n220\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.720\nis that every single virtual machine\nessentially is made of a file that\n\n221\n00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.290\nactually controls all the settings\nthat's says here's what my hardware is.\n\n222\n00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.780\nAnd it actually has another file for\n\n223\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.690\nstorage which represents it's hard drive\nis what we actually end up seeing.\n\n224\n00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.100\nSo I tried to make them a little\nbit different when we see them.\n\n225\n00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.770\nWhat Daniel is actually saying is if I\nneed to move us because that particular\n\n226\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:12.110\nmachine is failing, and I need to move it\nover to another one or even to a, oops,\n\n227\n00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:17.040\nI grab the server instead, or\nto another one instead, well,\n\n228\n00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.510\nwe can actually do that traditionally\nwhen we've actually done this.\n\n229\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.570\nIn the way that I've done is simple.\n\n230\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.580\nYou normally have to go ahead and do this.\n\n231\n00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.980\nYou first have to shutdown that VM, okay?\n\n232\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.980\nThen what you would do, is you would take\nthis file and you can actually copy, and\n\n233\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.670\nthen paste it over on\nto another ESXi server.\n\n234\n00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.420\nMake sure that that's actually done.\n\n235\n00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.720\nVerify that it's still linked\nto the actual disk file or\n\n236\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.190\ndoes this actually still show that\nsame location on that disk file.\n\n237\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.070\nIf not, it's not gonna start up.\n\n238\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.580\nVerify that it's actually still there and\nthen you can turn it back on and\n\n239\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.840\nyou are ready to go.\n\n240\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.189\nWell, what in the world\ndid vMotion end up doing?\n\n241\n00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.640\nvMotion actually ends up saying this.\n\n242\n00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.640\nWe want you to be able to do that but\nyou shouldn't actually have to worry about\n\n243\n00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.110\nturning this thing off to do it, or you\nshould have as minimal downtime as needed.\n\n244\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.830\nSo when something begins to\nhappen in terms of vMotion and\n\n245\n00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.670\nyou know that either because\nof resource utilization.\n\n246\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.300\nIn other words,\nESXi is now straining for resources.\n\n247\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.680\nvMotion side of vscript can say,\nI need to move VM1.\n\n248\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.340\nIf I move VM1,\n\n249\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.280\nI need to move it over to another one that\nactually has the capabilities available.\n\n250\n00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.100\nWell, here's a way it does it whereas it\nactually seems it's almost instantaneous.\n\n251\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.750\nInstead of actually having to move\nthe actual file as well as VMware or\n\n252\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:45.610\nVM1 here It simply goes ahead and it\ncopies what we call the system state data,\n\n253\n00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:50.560\nas well as what's in RAM, and they combine\nthat into what we would call a bitmap.\n\n254\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.810\nThey take a copy of that bitmap and\nthey go ahead and\n\n255\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.220\nthey paste it onto another location.\n\n256\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.700\nAnd while that one is running,\nright, they suspend it over here and\n\n257\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.670\nresume that over here.\n\n258\n00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.980\nSo now notice that the original\nfile is still in its location, or\n\n259\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.730\nas far as the hard drive goes.\n\n260\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.230\nAnd now that bitmap image is copied over.\n\n261\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.580\nSo instead of having to move everything,\nright, and\n\n262\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.050\nverify everything, it just says,\nhere's what I can do.\n\n263\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.450\nI can copy and paste a very small file.\n\n264\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.330\nAnd essentially move it over there and\nthe system state data resume it and\n\n265\n00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.690\nit's ready to go.\n\n266\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:29.560\nSo vMotion is one of those technologies\nthat actually makes it seem seamless, that\n\n267\n00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.550\nyou and I don't have to actually shutting\nthing down, it can do it with very minimal\n\n268\n00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:38.960\ndown time, and almost zero downtime in\nthe way that vMotion ends up working\n\n269\n00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.300\nif you have everything the background\nthat actually needs to work here.\n\n270\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.590\nSo, of course,\nthat means a high speed network.\n\n271\n00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.960\nEverything else is there.\n\n272\n00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.870\nIf you actually have like a 10 gigabit,\nit is almost instantaneous if you do it.\n\n273\n00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.310\nOkay?\nIf that's actually what's underlying\n\n274\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.910\nyour technology.\n\n275\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.010\nMost of us may not actually\nbe dealing with 10 gigs.\n\n276\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:01.090\nBut, at the same time, that's not bad\nunto itself when you really aren't.\n\n277\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.270\nNow the other technology that we\nalso want to actually think about is\n\n278\n00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:08.160\nsometimes you also have to move\nthe VM across long distances.\n\n279\n00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.680\nIn other words,\nacross WAN links at this point too.\n\n280\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.060\nIf you now have to move this across WAN\nlinks, well there's actually something\n\n281\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.000\ncalled Long Distance vMotion that does\nthe same thing we're talking about.\n\n282\n00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.200\nBut now when you do it they\ntalk about a latency of\n\n283\n00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.770\nabout 150 milliseconds is what\nthey have gone even across\n\n284\n00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:35.165\nWAN links which are generally slower so\nhere is I scroll down just a little bit\n\n285\n00:15:35.165 --> 00:15:39.620\nbecause that actually didn't kinda of zoom\nin the way I thought it was going to.\n\n286\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.350\nSo let's say that we have somebody in\nToronto we have somebody in Miami.\n\n287\n00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:47.290\nAnd this particular one needed to,\nactually, be motioned over there.\n\n288\n00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.030\nWell, again, long distance vMotion\nwould then go across a WAN link.\n\n289\n00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.806\nBut, what they're saying is, it shouldn't\ntake any more than 150 milliseconds.\n\n290\n00:15:53.806 --> 00:15:57.591\nNow, the latest figures that you can,\nactually, read on VMware's site,\n\n291\n00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:01.613\nis saying, look, we're saying,\n100 milliseconds But I can't tell you for\n\n292\n00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:04.712\nthe exam,\nwhether it's actually gonna be 100 or 150.\n\n293\n00:16:04.712 --> 00:16:08.302\nJust kind of accept that, whichever one of\nthose two that you see, in other words,\n\n294\n00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:11.380\nif the other one's excluded,\nit's probably the other one.\n\n295\n00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.950\nSo I can't sit there and go,\nhere's exactly what it is,\n\n296\n00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.970\nbut either one of those two.\n\n297\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.690\nMore than likely I think you're gonna see\nthat the exam is probably a little bit\n\n298\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.510\nolder, so you might actually take\na look at that figure as being\n\n299\n00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.930\nthe one that you'll probably see but\nI can't tell you that for sure.\n\n300\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.340\nBut just kinda realize\nthat the newer ones,\n\n301\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.600\nif you go to the website\nyou'll see 100 milliseconds.\n\n302\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.290\nI don't want you to get confused there.\n\n303\n00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:36.310\nLong Distance vMotion is a big one,\nthat's actually a technology for us too.\n\n304\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.500\nThere's also something\ncalled Storage vMotion\n\n305\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.460\nthat allows you to do the same thing with\nthe actual storage devices themselves.\n\n306\n00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.610\nSo that you don't have\nto move them as well.\n\n307\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.530\nNow it gives you the ability to\nmove them if you actually need to.\n\n308\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.250\nBut it can actually manage it for you if\nyou actually give it the ability to do so.\n\n309\n00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.060\nSo you have a manual mode and\nyou have an automatic.\n\n310\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.380\nIf you actually do the manual mode, you\ncan move it however you want to according\n\n311\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.600\nto policy or whatever, or you can actually\nsay, just automatically adjust it if\n\n312\n00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.690\nthere's actually contention or\nsomething over here.\n\n313\n00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.110\nLet's do the other thing\nthat we actually need there.\n\n314\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.640\nSo it really does allow for\nthe easiest migration possible,\n\n315\n00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.070\nthat's one of the biggest technologies\nthat we actually run across, and\n\n316\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:17.545\nto me is kinda neat that somebody\nwas smart enough to figure that out.\n\n317\n00:17:17.545 --> 00:17:18.670\nIt's not about the moving,\n\n318\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.990\nit's about making sure that you really\ndon't notice it if it actually is moved.\n\n319\n00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.780\n>> Yeah.\nAnd it's awesome to watch and\n\n320\n00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.640\nsee that actually working in real life,\nso if you ever get a chance to\n\n321\n00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.460\nplay with this stuff and use V Motion,\ndefinitely do it just so you can go wow.\n\n322\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.670\nThat is amazing.\n\n323\n00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.720\nIt's some really cool stuff.\n\n324\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.940\nNow, we're talking of VM ware here,\n\n325\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.910\none of the other things that they give\nus is they really address availability.\n\n326\n00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.070\nThey want to make sure that you're\nenvironment has as little downtime and\n\n327\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.640\nthat everybody has access to\neverything that they need access to\n\n328\n00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.950\nat every given possible moment.\n\n329\n00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.460\nNo one's 100% perfect.\n\n330\n00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.660\nBut, man, do they really come at\nthis angle really hard hitting.\n\n331\n00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.910\nDon't they, Ronnie?\n\n332\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:59.800\n>> They really do.\n\n333\n00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.828\nWhen we talk about that, they talk about\nidea of what they call vSphere HA.\n\n334\n00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:04.523\nCapital H.\n\n335\n00:18:04.523 --> 00:18:05.970\nCapital A.\n\n336\n00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.310\nAnd a lot of the time we just\ncall it high availability.\n\n337\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:12.650\nSo let's take a look at that on my drawing\nas well and that will help us out.\n\n338\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.930\nNow you actually see it's kinda\nbased around the same idea here.\n\n339\n00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:20.088\nSo, what happens to this virtual\nmachine if the hardware goes down?\n\n340\n00:18:20.088 --> 00:18:24.249\nWell, traditionally, if I only have one,\nwell that's it, I'm toast.\n\n341\n00:18:24.249 --> 00:18:27.980\nThe very fact is, if the hardware\ngoes down, that probably means what?\n\n342\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.630\nThat VM is actually gonna what?\n\n343\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.860\nShut down as well.\n\n344\n00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.280\nOkay?\nThat seems to be normal.\n\n345\n00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.370\nThat's exactly what we think about.\n\n346\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.250\nBut with high availability,\nusing V Sphere that it goes on,\n\n347\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:44.040\nwhat should happen between these is that\nwhen it senses that something is going on,\n\n348\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.140\nonce we have V Center and\nall that actually set up and\n\n349\n00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.450\nhigh availability is actually available\nto us, what should happen is,\n\n350\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.040\nthat inside of vCenter,\nthere's a heartbeat.\n\n351\n00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.010\nAll right,\nthat VMware no longer sends that, and\n\n352\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.700\nwhat that vCenter can, actually, do,\nthrough high availability, is say, look,\n\n353\n00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:08.330\nthat particular machine needs to actually\nbe started up over here, instead.\n\n354\n00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:13.320\nSo before it actually goes down, it\nmakes a copy of it and it goes ahead and\n\n355\n00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.390\nit actually allows it to actually\nmigrate and start it up over here too.\n\n356\n00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.150\nSo that way,\neven if we have a hardware failure,\n\n357\n00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.630\nthat VM automatically can start\nup over here on this side.\n\n358\n00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:31.389\nAnd that is very much amazing without\nhuman interaction needed it says high\n\n359\n00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:35.027\navailability means,\nI watch out for the entire system.\n\n360\n00:19:35.027 --> 00:19:38.998\nSo regardless if I have a hardware failure\nthen I will automatically start sensing\n\n361\n00:19:38.998 --> 00:19:42.793\nthat something is going on let me go ahead\nand make a copy of it along the other and\n\n362\n00:19:42.793 --> 00:19:47.480\nwe're up and running you don't have to\nworry about even hardware failures.\n\n363\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.440\nThe one time we absolutely worry about,\nis when nobody is actually in the office.\n\n364\n00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.580\nRight?\nSo high availability is a big one for\n\n365\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:58.340\nus that really does help in that\navailability feature as well.\n\n366\n00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:58.980\nOkay?\n\n367\n00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.320\nAlong with that, of course,\nis the idea of fault tolerance.\n\n368\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.040\nNow, you and\nI understand the idea of fault tolerance.\n\n369\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.070\nWe take one machine and\nwe have a redundancy.\n\n370\n00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.960\nRight?\nOne fails.\n\n371\n00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.160\nThe other one takes over.\n\n372\n00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.000\nOkay.\n\n373\n00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.400\nThe way this one works is to have\ninstantaneous fault tolerance.\n\n374\n00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.750\nThey way that we are used to is,\nthat machine fails,\n\n375\n00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:19.330\nthe other one takes a moment to spin up,\nthen we are connected.\n\n376\n00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:25.800\nWhen you actually make a VM on one ESXI\nserver and you've got everything set up,\n\n377\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:33.910\nit automatically creates an exact copy of\nit over on another VM ware server, okay?\n\n378\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:39.380\nAnd if you update this one over here,\nit also update this one over here, okay?\n\n379\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.030\nIt absolutely, she does all that at\nthe same time, the same thing even with\n\n380\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.370\nthe files, it will do the same thing\nas far as the hard drive goes.\n\n381\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.590\nNow, you might be wondering why\nin the world that would be true.\n\n382\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:54.750\nIf anything goes wrong with one of these,\nit doesn't matter which one, because\n\n383\n00:20:54.750 --> 00:21:00.020\nit has an exact duplicate copy that's\nalready operating, that one can go down.\n\n384\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.900\nNo bog deal.\n\n385\n00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.060\nIt goes down,\nthe other one's actually up and\n\n386\n00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:08.260\nrunning, and as an exact copy of one\nthat's actually already running.\n\n387\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.440\nSo that's why this idea of fault\ntolerance is instantaneous.\n\n388\n00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.380\nit really prevents any of that stuff that\nwe have to worry about is about latency.\n\n389\n00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.610\nNow in the background,\nthe only way that this works, though,\n\n390\n00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.890\nis if you have an insanely\nhigh speed network connection.\n\n391\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.080\nAgain, high availability would\nactually be the same way.\n\n392\n00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.690\nThe recommendation, but\n\n393\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:32.230\nnot the requirement by VMware,\nis that there is a 10 gigabyte back\n\n394\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.660\nplaying connection between these\nhosts if you're gonna do that, okay.\n\n395\n00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.710\nNow, if you don't have it,\nit doesn't mean it won't work.\n\n396\n00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.360\nNo, it means it will work, but\n\n397\n00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.330\nit will slow down the performance\nof your machines, right.\n\n398\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.440\nSo every change that's made,\n\n399\n00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.880\nit will actually have to send that\nchange across to the other one.\n\n400\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.130\nIt just has to.\n\n401\n00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:53.890\nSo, if you have a 10 gigabit connection\nin the backside, well, that's\n\n402\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.520\nthe way that you actually can ensure that\nit actually works the way that needs to.\n\n403\n00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.360\nIf it doesn't, okay, then you're gonna\nhave a lot of traffic go between.\n\n404\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.509\nThe traffic in doing this fault tolerance\nis what's called fault tolerance logging.\n\n405\n00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.133\nI'm emphasizing it for a reason, right?\n\n406\n00:22:09.133 --> 00:22:12.831\nSo fault tolerance logging is\nactually one of the key terms that\n\n407\n00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:16.828\nyou have to realize is that\nreplication traffic that goes between.\n\n408\n00:22:16.828 --> 00:22:19.336\nAnd instead of saturating\nyour entire network, right,\n\n409\n00:22:19.336 --> 00:22:22.380\nif you're actually hooked to\na regular switch and everybody elses.\n\n410\n00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.971\nIt says fault, tolerance login let's use\nthat dedicated link between these to send\n\n411\n00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:29.420\nthat traffic back and forth between.\n\n412\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.860\nSo we're not absolutely actually\nsaturating the entire network\n\n413\n00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.390\nwith this type of traffic instead.\n\n414\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.853\nSo that's what makes it very\nfast incredibly efficient and\n\n415\n00:22:39.853 --> 00:22:41.592\nmakes it with zero downtime.\n\n416\n00:22:41.592 --> 00:22:43.939\nSo high availability fault\ntolerance tend to go hand and hand.\n\n417\n00:22:43.939 --> 00:22:46.850\nSo when would we use one versus the other?\n\n418\n00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.510\nHigh availability is when\nthe physical hardware goes down.\n\n419\n00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:55.480\nIn fault tolerance, this is when that VM,\nthat operating system itself fails.\n\n420\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.050\nIn that VM it says,\nI'm not operating anymore.\n\n421\n00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.700\nThe good thing is, the other one's\nalready spun up and it's ready and going.\n\n422\n00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.770\nSo you want to make sure you\nunderstand that difference.\n\n423\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.540\nFault tolerance, Operating VM goes down,\nhigh availability,\n\n424\n00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.370\nit's because, you need that when\nthe physical hardware goes down instead.\n\n425\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.410\n>> That's right.\nNow another wonderful ability of our\n\n426\n00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:21.230\nvSphere ERX environment, is the ability\nto do clustering and resource pooling.\n\n427\n00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.290\nRonnie, like I said,\nthey've done a great job of trying\n\n428\n00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:28.940\nto find out all the ways in which you\nwould need their help and address that.\n\n429\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.840\nAnd they've done that here as well.\n\n430\n00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.470\nPutting together large storage arrays,\nmaking them look like\n\n431\n00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.980\neven larger storage array, or just working\nthem across the different platforms.\n\n432\n00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.340\nIt's really awesome stuff.\n\n433\n00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.940\n>> It really is, because when we\nstart talking about clustering,\n\n434\n00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.580\nmost of us just think of\nthe idea of storage, okay?\n\n435\n00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.153\nWell, in the EXXI, and\nin the vSphere, they, actually,\n\n436\n00:23:48.153 --> 00:23:51.508\nare clustering every resource that's\npossible in the data center, right?\n\n437\n00:23:51.508 --> 00:23:57.972\nSo, you can cluster together EXXI hosts,\ntogether into it's own cluster,\n\n438\n00:23:57.972 --> 00:24:03.550\nso that they can, actually,\nbe able to Have up to 8,000 VMs.\n\n439\n00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:07.583\nNow I actually had 64 hosts, but I think\nthat's actually four hosts instead.\n\n440\n00:24:07.583 --> 00:24:09.244\nI don't know why I put 64 in my notes.\n\n441\n00:24:09.244 --> 00:24:10.845\nI was looking at it and\nI was like that's a little bit strange.\n\n442\n00:24:10.845 --> 00:24:11.780\n>> You like to confuse yourself, Ronnie.\n\n443\n00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:12.985\n>> I apparently do.\n\n444\n00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:18.575\nSo each one you can actually\nhave up to four ESXi hosts and\n\n445\n00:24:18.575 --> 00:24:22.388\nthat means that each one of\nthose can support up to 8,000.\n\n446\n00:24:22.388 --> 00:24:26.153\nEvery cluster can support\nup to 8,000 VMs there.\n\n447\n00:24:26.153 --> 00:24:31.069\nNow remember that if you do this and\nyou start clustering that inside of that\n\n448\n00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:35.920\nparticular cluster now, every single VM,\nyou can actually turn on a VM.\n\n449\n00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.230\nI don't know why you would do this,\nbut you can.\n\n450\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.680\nYou could actually turn on a VM and\n\n451\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.280\nactually tell it that it can have\nup to 128 virtual CPUs, okay?\n\n452\n00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.960\nSo if you absolutely have an application\nthat will take 128 CPUs to make it\n\n453\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.070\noperate the way it thinks it needs to,\nyou can do that, and\n\n454\n00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:59.350\nevery single VM can have up to four\nterabytes of RAM if you need it to.\n\n455\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.160\nNow I'm not saying you don't need that,\nbut what I'm saying is I've never actually\n\n456\n00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.440\nfaced that situation where I've\nactually needed any more than two or\n\n457\n00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.620\nthree CPUs ever,\neven virtual CPUs as well.\n\n458\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:15.270\nSo, that's one of those features\nthat's actually very unique.\n\n459\n00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.380\nBecause it shows the ability\nto scale out and\n\n460\n00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.700\nscale up when you actually\nneed it to do what you need.\n\n461\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.485\nvSphere Clusters are something\nthat they're actually setup for\n\n462\n00:25:24.485 --> 00:25:27.420\nonce you actually do have\nthe things ready to go.\n\n463\n00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:32.000\nThe other thing that's also\nclustering of course is this idea\n\n464\n00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.770\nof the storage that we have access to,\nokay.\n\n465\n00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.950\nSo the good thing is once you\nactually have your ESXi cluster,\n\n466\n00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.360\nit actually begins to look for\nstorage clusters as well.\n\n467\n00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.873\nAnd one of the ones that's\nactually created or\n\n468\n00:25:44.873 --> 00:25:48.038\nthat you can create is what\nthey call a virtual SAN, okay.\n\n469\n00:25:48.038 --> 00:25:53.093\nA virtual SAN allows then\nall of these ESXi host to be\n\n470\n00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:58.880\nable to store their VMs on,\nlet's say, this data store.\n\n471\n00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:05.400\nEven if they have no actual ability to\nactually host any VMs on their own, okay?\n\n472\n00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.540\nSo it doesn't matter if ESXi\nhas their own hard drives.\n\n473\n00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.543\nIn other words, they don't have any space,\nthey can still store their VMs on this\n\n474\n00:26:13.543 --> 00:26:17.375\ndata store if they need to and that's\nbecause it's a virtual SAN that everyone\n\n475\n00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:19.779\ncan actually connect to\nover that network link.\n\n476\n00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:24.551\nSo it really is kind of neat again in\nthe very fact that clusters are actually\n\n477\n00:26:24.551 --> 00:26:27.070\nhelping us to be able to do that as well.\n\n478\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.360\nNow, clusters then, when we start taking\nthen from the standpoint of host and\n\n479\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.460\nthen you actually add in your data\nstore which becomes a virtual SAN and\n\n480\n00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.710\nyou start doing all this stuff which\nmeans that for management purposes,\n\n481\n00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.360\nwe consider them resource pools.\n\n482\n00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.720\nNow, what the heck is\na resource pool about?\n\n483\n00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.230\nSo taking whatever's remaining\nthat's available and\n\n484\n00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.490\nyou managing it however you want to.\n\n485\n00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.220\nSo it's essentially\na management container.\n\n486\n00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.825\nYou can put all of your drives or\nyou can put some of your drives.\n\n487\n00:26:53.825 --> 00:26:57.180\nAnd you can say I'm gonna actually create\nthis resource pool for these guys and\n\n488\n00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.710\nthen you can divide up that\nstorage however you want to, okay?\n\n489\n00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.620\nSo you don't have to actually worry\nwhether it's actually a different type\n\n490\n00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.380\nof storage device or not.\n\n491\n00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.160\nIt becomes one big resource pool for\nyou to do so.\n\n492\n00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.070\nSame thing with the CPU,\nto be able to distribute the CPU usage.\n\n493\n00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.114\nAs well as in networking, all of that can\nactually become part of your resource pool\n\n494\n00:27:15.114 --> 00:27:19.440\nto build and manage together and\nsay, here on these 2,000 VMs,\n\n495\n00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.710\nthey're gonna have access to this much\nnetworking, and you can actually say that.\n\n496\n00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.170\nDo you actually have all those cables?\n\n497\n00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:29.730\nNo, but if they are actually\nis the capacity that you have,\n\n498\n00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:33.880\nyou can do that in terms of the resource\npools to help you to do that.\n\n499\n00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.700\nNow the way that this is done is through\na technology that they call DRS,\n\n500\n00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.490\nright which is\nthe Distributed Resource Scheduler, okay.\n\n501\n00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.240\nThe distributed resource scheduler is what\n\n502\n00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.350\ninsures that we can actually do all the\nstuff that we need to, and still operate\n\n503\n00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:52.240\nour network the way that we need to and\nstill do the maintenance that we need to,\n\n504\n00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.680\nif we can,\nwithout having any planned downtime, okay.\n\n505\n00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.060\nWe're not talking about\nunplanned downtime,\n\n506\n00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.510\nthat stuff will happen just whenever.\n\n507\n00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.450\nBut we're saying, look,\nif we need to actually go ahead and\n\n508\n00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.420\nsay, I've gotta work on ESX 3, okay.\n\n509\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.539\nWe see that there's a failing\nstick of RAM, right?\n\n510\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.760\nThat DRS, that distributed resource\nscheduler, we can tell it either by giving\n\n511\n00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.100\nit a predetermined time, that you're\ngonna move all those VMs off of there,\n\n512\n00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:24.990\nas well as actually insure that all of\nthe actual virtual disks, which I couldn't\n\n513\n00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.750\nremember what I was gonna say, is moved\nto another data store somewhere else.\n\n514\n00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:32.890\nYou can go in and schedule that, and,\nthat way, you can turn this machine off,\n\n515\n00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.560\nreplace the RAM, do whatever else you\nneed to, bring it back online, and\n\n516\n00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.560\nthen go back into the resource scheduler,\nand tell it to, actually,\n\n517\n00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.380\nmigrate things back over, after\neverything is, actually, good and done.\n\n518\n00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.862\nAnd, imagine that.\n\n519\n00:28:44.862 --> 00:28:48.198\nI can't even imagine what it would\nactually have to be like if I had 15 or\n\n520\n00:28:48.198 --> 00:28:52.358\n20 of these servers, I'm going, you mean\nI've got 120 VMs that I've gotta move and\n\n521\n00:28:52.358 --> 00:28:55.010\nI don't have any way to\nactually do that automatically.\n\n522\n00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:59.735\nI've gotta actually find room across all\nthese different devices to do so and that\n\n523\n00:28:59.735 --> 00:29:04.473\nshould be on and operating and doing the\nperformance level checks that we need to.\n\n524\n00:29:04.473 --> 00:29:07.250\nThat's why it actually use\nsomething like vSphere all right.\n\n525\n00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.660\nSo all this technologies that we're\ntalking about we're gonna see a little bit\n\n526\n00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.800\nmore on, but those are kind of the basic\nones that we wanna make sure that we\n\n527\n00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.550\nget access into, and understand\nwhat's actually gonna be happening.\n\n528\n00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.680\nSo there is a ton of technology.\n\n529\n00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.584\nDo you have to be at least\nfamiliar with the features of it?\n\n530\n00:29:23.584 --> 00:29:27.256\nYes, so pay attention, make sure you\ngo back through this episode again,\n\n531\n00:29:27.256 --> 00:29:30.720\ncuz it really is gonna help you as\nyou actually get ready for this exam.\n\n532\n00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.798\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, obviously there's a lot\nof great features and functionality built\n\n533\n00:29:35.798 --> 00:29:40.805\ninto the ESXi and vSphere environments,\nso definitely follow Ronnie's advice,\n\n534\n00:29:40.805 --> 00:29:45.976\ngo back through these, make sure you don't\nhave to be like the guy, the vSphere guy.\n\n535\n00:29:45.976 --> 00:29:48.952\nBut, for this exam you do have\nto be familiar with them and\n\n536\n00:29:48.952 --> 00:29:51.690\njust least basically what they do and\nhow they work.\n\n537\n00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.500\nRonnie you did a great\njob of explaining that.\n\n538\n00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.970\nWe really appreciate you stopping by and\ndoing that for us.\n\n539\n00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.060\nHopefully you guys learned out there and\nif you didn't, watch again and\n\n540\n00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.020\nagain until it starts sinking in up here.\n\n541\n00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.590\nAgain, thanks for stopping by Ronnie and\nthank you guys for watching.\n\n542\n00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.396\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n543\n00:30:06.396 --> 00:30:07.452\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n544\n00:30:07.452 --> 00:30:08.451\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n545\n00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:09.717\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n546\n00:30:09.717 --> 00:30:18.520\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:18.689\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.140\nwe're continuing on with our VCA.\n\n5\n00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.310\nThat's the VMware Certified Associate,\nseries that we've been working on.\n\n6\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.000\nJoining me back in the studio again today,\n\n7\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.580\nto help us out with that,\nis our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.560\nRonnie, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.161\nHow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:31.375\n>> Well, thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:35.735\nhaving me back in the studio as we\ncontinue on to take a look at our VMware,\n\n12\n00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:41.102\nVCA, the idea here is remember, VMware VCA\nstands for the VMware Certified Associate.\n\n13\n00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:43.025\nAnd we're actually in Version 6.\n\n14\n00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:46.075\nAnd today, we're actually continuing to\nmove on through some of the different\n\n15\n00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:49.727\ntechnologies that we need to continue\nto cover and we're really talking about\n\n16\n00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:52.595\nvSphere coverage of these\ntechnologies in virtualization.\n\n17\n00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:56.157\nSo, we're gonna be talking about\nstorage technologies today,\n\n18\n00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:58.027\nis what we're actually moving into.\n\n19\n00:00:58.027 --> 00:01:01.417\nNow, when we start taking a look at\nthat idea of storage technology,\n\n20\n00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:03.657\nwell the good thing is we've\nalready covered virtualization and\n\n21\n00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:05.357\nyou understand that concept.\n\n22\n00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:09.343\nBut now, it actually begins to move\na little bit away from where we're fairly\n\n23\n00:01:09.343 --> 00:01:10.630\ncomfortable, right?\n\n24\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.995\nWe've always talked about it, at least,\nin our experience so far through the show,\n\n25\n00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:19.120\nreally from the standpoint of\nvirtualizing an actual server, right?\n\n26\n00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.960\nAnd we do understand that that\ndoes include the idea of storage.\n\n27\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.390\nBut how is it we actually\nvirtualize storage and\n\n28\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.060\nhow does vSphere also handle it as well?\n\n29\n00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.010\nSo, where we want to begin is actually\ntalk about some of the technicalities here\n\n30\n00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.640\njust briefly.\n\n31\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.940\nI'm not going to go into a super\nin depth technical study of this.\n\n32\n00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.700\nBut what I wanna actually do is talk\nabout just physical storage at this\n\n33\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.610\npoint just briefly.\n\n34\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.200\nAnd then we'll talk about the benefit\nof moving to virtual storage.\n\n35\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.050\nAnd then we'll take a look at technologies\nthat we find in vSphere, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.510\nWhen we start taking look at\nthe use of physical storage,\n\n37\n00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.290\nespecially with servers, right?\n\n38\n00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.850\nThey can actually be internal or\nexternal devices, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.400\nTraditionally on an internal storage\ndevice, just like a regular PC.\n\n40\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.190\nYou buy that thing, you go ahead and\nyou format the hard drive.\n\n41\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.020\nYou install the operating system,\nnot necessarily in that order.\n\n42\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.750\nBut, yes you go ahead and install that,\nand when you do so, right?\n\n43\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.450\nThat server itself now expect to\nhave access to that hard drive\n\n44\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.690\npretty much all the time.\n\n45\n00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.270\nIt actually says look that hard\ndrive is mine and that's it.\n\n46\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.520\nNow, normally what also ends up happening\nthough, is that you don't tend to actually\n\n47\n00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.500\nallow for that block level type of\naccess to that hard drive anymore.\n\n48\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.610\nNow you actually allow for\nfileshares to go on.\n\n49\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.710\nYes, you allow people to connect in, but\n\n50\n00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.300\nthey're not really connecting in\nto control the hardware, itself.\n\n51\n00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.590\nIf you do have another device\nthat actually says look,\n\n52\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.770\nI'm gonna take control of that,\nyou will end up losing data.\n\n53\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.050\nTwo particular machines cannot\naccess that drive at the same,\n\n54\n00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.640\nexact time in that way, or\nyou're gonna end up losing data.\n\n55\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.960\nAnd so one of the things that\nthey actually tried to do,\n\n56\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.990\nin terms of virtualization types or\nexcuse me,\n\n57\n00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.080\ndata center virtualization is to say,\nlook we know something.\n\n58\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.170\nThat if we're actually talking about\nvirtualizing the entire data center,\n\n59\n00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.980\nwe want to make sure all of\nthe storage inside of the data center\n\n60\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.010\nis gonna be available in the way\nthat we want it to be available.\n\n61\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.460\nSo, the way that they do\nthat is they abstract it or\n\n62\n00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.540\nthey essentially turn it into\na software management system instead.\n\n63\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.930\nRegardless of where that hard drive\nmay exist or wherever it might be.\n\n64\n00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.680\nThe idea of using it for virtualization\nreally does improve, first of all,\n\n65\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.500\nwhat we call our storage utilization and\nflexibility.\n\n66\n00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.320\nWhereas before, one hard drive\nreally did belong to one server,\n\n67\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.380\nnow what we can do instead through\nvirtualization is say look,\n\n68\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.090\nit doesn't matter where\nthose hard drives exist.\n\n69\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.690\nI can essentially pull them together,\n\n70\n00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.280\ncluster them together in\na virtual environment.\n\n71\n00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.170\nIn other words, software wise.\n\n72\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.840\nAnd I can actually just say look,\nthe software will direct\n\n73\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.500\nthe placement of wherever all of\nthose files actually need to be.\n\n74\n00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.510\nI don't care where it actually resides.\n\n75\n00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.510\nSo, it's very flexible and\n\n76\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.020\nthis also means that we can\nactually utilize it much better.\n\n77\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.990\nSome of the limitations we also have\nwith physical storage is location.\n\n78\n00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.871\nRemember that if I have,\nlet's say that this happens sometimes,\n\n79\n00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:06.480\nlet's say at my main site.\n\n80\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.420\nI have my main storage unit, and\nI'm starting to run low on storage.\n\n81\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.760\nBut I realize that we also bought, let's\nsay a NAS or a SAN, and we put that in\n\n82\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.060\na branch office about well, 15, 20 miles\naway, and has plenty of storage available.\n\n83\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.020\nWell that seemed like a good idea that I\ncould offload some of that storage, but\n\n84\n00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.580\nremember that's time, that's cost,\n\n85\n00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.580\nthat's energy that it takes to actually\ntransfer data all the way over there.\n\n86\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.870\nAnd now when you start having stuff like\nthat even location becomes a problem\n\n87\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.280\nwhen you start doing it so\n\n88\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.940\nyou don't tend to actually utilize that\nportion that may be 50 to 100 miles away.\n\n89\n00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.310\nYou just go okay, well we just need to buy\nanother device for our network instead.\n\n90\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.100\nSo, you might have that as well.\n\n91\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.705\nSo, in that sense topology doesn't\ntend to affect virtualization nor\n\n92\n00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:52.556\ndoes the idea of where\nlocation is gonna be.\n\n93\n00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:57.344\nAnd also, devices are also not\naffected by things like downtime too\n\n94\n00:04:57.344 --> 00:04:59.530\noften when you virtualize it.\n\n95\n00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.190\nIf you are actually virtualizing\nthe entire storage that you have inside of\n\n96\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.640\nyour data center and managing it that way,\nit allows you to be able to flexibly\n\n97\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.800\nmove data from one particular\ndevice that you go, look,\n\n98\n00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.490\nthat device is actually starting to fail,\nand move it on to another device.\n\n99\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.030\nReplace the failing components even\nwhile the network is still up and\n\n100\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.340\npeople are still accessing that data.\n\n101\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.550\nReplace all the things in there.\n\n102\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.210\nThen you can actually bring it back.\n\n103\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.980\nVirtualization helps you do that.\n\n104\n00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.770\nIn other words, try and\n\n105\n00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.620\nactually eliminate planned downtime is\nwhat the idea is actually here to do.\n\n106\n00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.760\nAnd, of course, the other nice thing about\nthe virtualization of storage is this.\n\n107\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.900\nMost of it can take advantage of\nexisting storage infrastructure.\n\n108\n00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.490\nSo, a lot of new\ntechnologies that come out,\n\n109\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.570\nall of a sudden you realize\nyou just have to switch over.\n\n110\n00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.820\nYou can't just go, all right,\n\n111\n00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.880\nwe're gonna take that technology\nthat exists right now.\n\n112\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.420\nAnd then we're gonna see if we can migrate\nthat and actually still keep it and\n\n113\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.610\nimplement it on.\n\n114\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.540\nAll of a sudden you actually realize well\nwe can't use that one anymore because it\n\n115\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.900\ndoesn't work with the newer systems.\n\n116\n00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.580\nSo, it just becomes kind an appendage, it\nbecomes an extra storage device maybe for\n\n117\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.770\nbackup somewhere.\n\n118\n00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.840\nBut we might find out that\nthe technology itself is not compatible.\n\n119\n00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.850\nThe very fact is VMware inside of vSphere\nusing that virtualization technology for\n\n120\n00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.410\nstorage, guess what?\n\n121\n00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.480\nIt can actually do that.\n\n122\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.910\nIt can take advantage of the existing\nstorage type of infrastructure that you\n\n123\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.830\nhave, and that means I can actually use\nthings like that older SAN that's there.\n\n124\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.750\nI can use things like the older NAS\nthat we may actually be retiring.\n\n125\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.930\nBut I still need that capacity and\nthat storage to be able to do things.\n\n126\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.410\nSo, I don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n127\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.000\nVMWare's vSphere really does help\nus out by being I'll say, look,\n\n128\n00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.200\nwe can take that technology virtualize\nit to use it the way that we want to and\n\n129\n00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.090\nthat's why it's actually so incredible\nbecause it actually is not just about\n\n130\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.590\nthe limitation of one device and\none machine and virtualizing that.\n\n131\n00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.110\nIt's saying,\nI can take your Data Center, and\n\n132\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.530\nactually be able to manage it better,\nbe able to use it much more efficiently.\n\n133\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.670\nAnd then you don't have to worry about\nthings like some of those planned down\n\n134\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.510\ntimes and maintenance schedules\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n135\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.265\nIt can actually handle it for you.\n\n136\n00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:14.865\n>> Ronnie,\nwould you be able to use the vSphere to\n\n137\n00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:16.645\ntake me to the hodge podge, as it were.\n\n138\n00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:21.085\nIf I had a NAS and a SAN because my\nnetwork's been growing over the millennium\n\n139\n00:07:21.085 --> 00:07:24.195\nthat we've been in business and\ncan I take all of those technologies,\n\n140\n00:07:24.195 --> 00:07:27.285\nput them all together, and\nmake them look like one virtual appliance?\n\n141\n00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:28.635\n>> It really can, okay?\n\n142\n00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:30.265\nIf you actually choose to do it that way,\n\n143\n00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:34.930\nit may not be the most efficient usage,\ncuz I'm not the greatest in terms of\n\n144\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.780\nI've actually known how to utilize all\nthe storage the way they want to, but yes.\n\n145\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:44.072\nIn theory if you have a NAS, if you have\na SAN, if you have an iSCSI storage,\n\n146\n00:07:44.072 --> 00:07:49.212\nyou've got a SCSI storage local,\nstorage direct attach storage here.\n\n147\n00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:53.428\nYou can actually use that VMware's\ntechnology to actually group all that\n\n148\n00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:56.158\nstuff together in a virtual\ntype of appliance.\n\n149\n00:07:56.158 --> 00:08:00.449\nAnd actually distribute it out the way\nyou want to, regardless of where they're\n\n150\n00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:05.071\nlocated As long as that vSphere Center,\nand the vCenter, vSphere working together.\n\n151\n00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:08.060\nThat they can actually manage it together,\nyou can do that.\n\n152\n00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.120\nAnd so we wanna actually take\na look at some of the ways\n\n153\n00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.930\nthat you can actually see this\nimplemented inside a vSphere as well.\n\n154\n00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.634\nSo we actually do have a nice example for\nus as we start taking a look\n\n155\n00:08:19.634 --> 00:08:24.060\nat some of the ways that we actually\ndo have the implementation.\n\n156\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:29.210\nSo here it is, I'm on my particular\nWeb Client here for vSphere.\n\n157\n00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.350\nAnd don't forget,\nI actually mentioned this on another show.\n\n158\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:36.390\nYou can actually go right into VMware's\nwebsite, and take a look around.\n\n159\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.510\nThere's actually a link there that says,\ntest drive vSphere.\n\n160\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.697\nAnd it gives you 50 days of access that\nyou can actually just take a look, and\n\n161\n00:08:42.697 --> 00:08:44.084\nthat's what we're using here.\n\n162\n00:08:44.084 --> 00:08:45.436\nAnd I wanted to use it during the show,\n\n163\n00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:47.085\nbecause that way if\nyou're actually saying,\n\n164\n00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:50.023\nhey, I'm really interested in knowing\na little bit more about this technology.\n\n165\n00:08:50.023 --> 00:08:52.660\nBut I can't shell out the money\nto actually do this and\n\n166\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.540\nI don't know the licensing.\n\n167\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.860\nWell they actually give\nyou this ability to do so.\n\n168\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.050\nAnd you can log right in and\njust follow it.\n\n169\n00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.360\nAnd they actually have a complete\n300 page lab manual that will\n\n170\n00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.480\nwalk you through everything.\n\n171\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.290\nWe're not gonna do that, we're just taking\na look at some of the technologies so\n\n172\n00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.920\nthat we can identify them.\n\n173\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.050\nSo when we actually log in,\nwe're actually here at the home screen.\n\n174\n00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.560\nAnd everything actually begins with\nthe idea of what we call host and\n\n175\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.770\nclusters for what we're taking a look at.\n\n176\n00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.548\nSo if I click on host and clusters, notice\nthat over here on the left-hand side,\n\n177\n00:09:21.548 --> 00:09:28.980\nthat just leaves me with this idea of\nvcsa01acorp.local, and that's fine.\n\n178\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.020\nWe can take a look at that just briefly.\n\n179\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.770\nAnd then if I click on it,\nyou actually see it doesn't actually\n\n180\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.140\nexpand out until I click\non that little arrow.\n\n181\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.830\nAnd now I have Datacenter Site A and\nDatacenter Site B.\n\n182\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.360\nAnd then I'm gonna click one more time so\n\n183\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.870\nthat we can see this,\nthat what is this doing?\n\n184\n00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.420\nWhat is this Datacenter Site A,\nDatacenter Site B?\n\n185\n00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.970\nWell it doesn't matter\nwhere they're located.\n\n186\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.850\nOne could be located in,\nwhere's the Olympic games going?\n\n187\n00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:56.850\nRio, okay?\n\n188\n00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.992\nYeah, one could be located in Rio\nanother one could be located in London,\n\n189\n00:09:59.992 --> 00:10:01.220\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n190\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.624\nI think one of these is actually\nsupposed to be located in London.\n\n191\n00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:09.497\nSo, regardless of where they are, if I\nexpand that, let's say Datacenter A here.\n\n192\n00:10:09.497 --> 00:10:13.033\nYou actually see it gives you a nice\nlittle summary, and everything that we're\n\n193\n00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:16.370\ntalking about actually begins when\nwe create what we call a cluster.\n\n194\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.350\nNow what in the world is a Cluster?\n\n195\n00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:22.110\nAnd we're not gonna create this, but\nnotice that there's virtual machines and\n\n196\n00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.610\nthat's what these little icons are.\n\n197\n00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:29.085\nAnd there's also ESX hosts that we see,\nright?\n\n198\n00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:32.765\nSo remember that this is actually the\nphysical servers that are actually running\n\n199\n00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:35.295\nESX, okay, as what we see here.\n\n200\n00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:38.575\nAnd we can actually group those\ntogether however we want to, and\n\n201\n00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:41.595\nmanage them underneath a single Cluster.\n\n202\n00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:44.960\nWhich also can be called\na single Datacenter as well.\n\n203\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.320\nAnd that way we group together\nthose resources that we need.\n\n204\n00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.240\nIf I select on Cluster Site A and\n\n205\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.370\nclick on Getting Started,\nhere's what we're taking a look at.\n\n206\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.440\nClusters enable vSphere High Availability,\nvSphere Distributed Resources,\n\n207\n00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.730\nvSphere Virtual SAN, as well.\n\n208\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.440\nSo all these solutions are actually\nenabled once you actually start\n\n209\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.530\nclustering those devices together.\n\n210\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.620\nSo if you're taking a look at this and\ngo, man,\n\n211\n00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.940\nI can't find where we mentioned some\nof these storage technologies here.\n\n212\n00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.630\nMore than likely it's because\nyou don't have a Cluster set up\n\n213\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.680\nwhen it doesn't happen.\n\n214\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.080\nSo it has to begin with actually\nimplementing a cluster.\n\n215\n00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.440\nAnd it's fairly simple,\nyou right click on the Datacenter here.\n\n216\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.490\nAnd then you actually tell it to add\nNew Cluster, you give it a name.\n\n217\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.810\nAnd afterwards you simply follow\nthe instructions through there.\n\n218\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.910\nAnd it says, will you need to add host,\ndo you need to add these devices,\n\n219\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.860\nwhat do you wanna add in here?\n\n220\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.400\nAnd it gives you that ability to do so.\n\n221\n00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.080\nBut if you don't have that you won't be\nable to see some of the things that we're\n\n222\n00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.230\nactually gonna be mentioning during\nour show today as well, okay?\n\n223\n00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.770\nSo for us we wanna make sure that\nwe understand that when we start\n\n224\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.780\nusing this type of technology here, okay?\n\n225\n00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.110\nIt is actually gonna allow us to\nactually expand the capabilities, right?\n\n226\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:01.000\nBeyond our local machine,\nbeyond even multiple machines,\n\n227\n00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.940\neven across our entire network.\n\n228\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.980\nEven though those networks may\nnot actually be anywhere close.\n\n229\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.180\nSo notice that here it is,\n\n230\n00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.640\nhere's these two different\ncenters that we're talking about.\n\n231\n00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.360\nSo once we have that cluster enabled,\n\n232\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.790\nwe will have access to things like what\nthey're talking about here, right?\n\n233\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:22.080\nOops, let me go back and click on this\nhere and make sure I show you, okay.\n\n234\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.760\nSo cluster's enabled,\nthe vSphere High Availability,\n\n235\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.940\nvSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler and\neven VSAN.\n\n236\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.970\nThere's even more that's available, but\na lot of it also may be added on editions\n\n237\n00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:38.520\nthat you have in the Enterprise Plus and\nthe Enterprise Plus with more stuff in it.\n\n238\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.797\nSo if you don't have that level as well,\nyou may have not have access to that too.\n\n239\n00:12:42.797 --> 00:12:48.000\nWhen you start taking a look here,\nsome of these particular ones here.\n\n240\n00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.590\nLet's go ahead and\n\n241\n00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.800\ntake a look at something like\nthe High Availability, okay?\n\n242\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.650\nSo once I click on Cluster and\nI wanted to implement that.\n\n243\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:58.960\nThe good thing is it tells me right away,\nhey, once I implement it, then I can come\n\n244\n00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:05.090\nhere to Manage, and\nnow you can see under Manage here.\n\n245\n00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.430\nLet me scroll over here to\nthe right just a little bit so\n\n246\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.660\nwe can see the whole thing.\n\n247\n00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.770\nYou can see the services\nthat are available.\n\n248\n00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.710\nAnd here is one of the ones that\nwe were just talking about,\n\n249\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:19.000\nwhich is this DRS,\nDistributed Resource Scheduler.\n\n250\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.940\nThis Distributed Resource Scheduler\nespecially in terms of storage, right,\n\n251\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.800\nallows us to do what you and\nI we were just talking about.\n\n252\n00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.790\nIn case of things that actually we need\nto go down for scheduled maintenance,\n\n253\n00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:36.010\nwe can use that idea of that Distributed\nResource Scheduler to really help us out.\n\n254\n00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.830\nBecause it can actually say when\nwe actually want to plan for\n\n255\n00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.860\nthe movement of these machines.\n\n256\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:46.380\nAnd we can actually go beyond this even in\nterms of Power Management as well, too.\n\n257\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.280\nSo we can actually base the movement off\nof things like scheduling if we want to.\n\n258\n00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.620\nOr also using Distributed Power\nManagement, we can actually say,\n\n259\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.520\nlook at high peak times, okay?\n\n260\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.260\nYou need to bring up another sever for\nthis cluster, and we can actually tell it,\n\n261\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.734\nhey here's what needs to happen so\nthat we have access to those resources.\n\n262\n00:14:03.734 --> 00:14:09.656\nOr, in times in which there's low power,\nif we wanna do it based on power,\n\n263\n00:14:09.656 --> 00:14:15.862\nit can consolidate VM's across that\nVMware Sphere to vCenter, right there.\n\n264\n00:14:15.862 --> 00:14:19.698\nAnd actually say, hey, let's pull\neverything over to this one ESX host, or\n\n265\n00:14:19.698 --> 00:14:23.170\nthese two, and we'll turn off\nthe third one, if we need to.\n\n266\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.510\nAnd then, when there's a high demand or\neven at, let's say midnight.\n\n267\n00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.920\nWe go, we wanna turn back on,\nit will turn back on,\n\n268\n00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.260\nredistribute the load, you name it.\n\n269\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.150\nUsing these types of resources\nis actually available.\n\n270\n00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.670\nNow we're not getting\ninto everything here but\n\n271\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.710\nI do wanna show you a couple of options,\nokay?\n\n272\n00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.340\nSo if you turn on vSphere,\n\n273\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.890\nokay, there's two options that you\nwanna make sure that you understand.\n\n274\n00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.300\nThe Partially Automated,\nFully Automated and the Manual.\n\n275\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.090\nNow we're really only talking about\nFully Automated and Manual here.\n\n276\n00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.340\nPartially means you want\nit to do some things,\n\n277\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.930\nand some things you don't want it to do,\nwell that's the same thing here, okay?\n\n278\n00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.280\nIn Manual, you get to tell it how\nyou want it to work, make sense?\n\n279\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.940\nManual you say, I want to make\nall the decisions here, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.730\nFully Automated says, look, let's do this,\n\n281\n00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.880\nall that technology that vSphere\nknows how to do, let it do it, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.211\nI like that option, Ronnie [LAUGH].\n\n283\n00:15:15.211 --> 00:15:18.410\nYeah, it may be better,\nin other words, it might actually go.\n\n284\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.111\nI can sense this cuz I have sensors going\non of when these things are actually\n\n285\n00:15:22.111 --> 00:15:22.770\nhappening.\n\n286\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.220\nWhen I'm having a power dip or\nwhen there's actually stuff like that.\n\n287\n00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.430\nSo it really does depend\non what you wanna do.\n\n288\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.926\nSo if you actually need control,\nor some control?\n\n289\n00:15:31.926 --> 00:15:35.306\nWell, you're gonna actually pick Manual or\nPartially Automated, or\n\n290\n00:15:35.306 --> 00:15:37.800\nyou're gonna pick Fully Automated.\n\n291\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.820\nSo in earlier versions there was\nreally only the Fully Automated and\n\n292\n00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:45.430\nthe Manual here, but just kind of\nremember that as far as vSphere goes.\n\n293\n00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.800\nAnd here's that other one on\nthe Power Management feature as well.\n\n294\n00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.172\nNotice the same things, that you need to\npick options, you're gonna take Manual or\n\n295\n00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:51.702\nAutomatic.\n\n296\n00:15:51.702 --> 00:15:54.092\nI'm not gonna turn that on for\nright now so\n\n297\n00:15:54.092 --> 00:15:57.932\nthat we don't mess up anything in\nmy cluster for right now, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:57.932 --> 00:16:00.806\nNow I'm gonna see if I can\ncancel out of that And\n\n299\n00:16:00.806 --> 00:16:03.988\nwe wanna talk about that\nhigh availability again.\n\n300\n00:16:03.988 --> 00:16:08.383\nNow we did spend an episode and we did\ntalk about this idea of high availability,\n\n301\n00:16:08.383 --> 00:16:10.430\nbut we didn't show you where it was.\n\n302\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:14.560\nAnd so one of the things we really wanna\ndo, right, is not just say, Ronnie told us\n\n303\n00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.840\nabout this, but is it actually really\nthere kko[Yes, it's actually right here.\n\n304\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.140\nSo don't forget that what we\nhad is actually on the cluster.\n\n305\n00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.320\nAnd then we selected Manage and\nthen I selected Edit Settings and\n\n306\n00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.610\nthere it is, there's vSphere right\nhere on the high availability.\n\n307\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:36.758\nAnd only after the cluster,\nif I click Edit, notice I can turn it on.\n\n308\n00:16:36.758 --> 00:16:39.889\nAnd this is where you actually can have\nthe extra things that you actually need\n\n309\n00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:41.040\nand available.\n\n310\n00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.950\nNow if you wanted to go into the VCP,\nright,\n\n311\n00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.600\nthe certified professional, you actually\nget all these options there, but\n\n312\n00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.490\nright now we just wanna show\nyou that they do exist and\n\n313\n00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.480\nyou do have some of these\nabilities to help you out there.\n\n314\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.920\nSo turning it on is one of the things\nit allows you to do, of course.\n\n315\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.820\nAnd then even doing the monitoring and\n\n316\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.450\nnotice failure response conditions and\ncontrols.\n\n317\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.340\nThere's that heart beat that\nwe talked about that allows\n\n318\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.747\nevery VM when you install\nthose VMWare additions,\n\n319\n00:17:09.747 --> 00:17:13.900\nthose tools that you install\nin every VM that you create.\n\n320\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.140\nIt actually sounds a heartbeat message and\n\n321\n00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.710\nhigh availability can\ntake advantage of that.\n\n322\n00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.770\nAlso, when the storage part, it's we're\nreally focusing on that right here.\n\n323\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:26.140\nIn the virtual SAN, okay as well.\n\n324\n00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.720\nLet me see if I can click on General here.\n\n325\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.740\nAnd notice that that\nfeature is also turned off.\n\n326\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.920\nIt's ready for some configuration.\n\n327\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.470\nRemember that a virtual SAN allows\nyou then to add in disks as actually\n\n328\n00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.290\nyou need to, to be able to create\nthe actual SAN environment that you want.\n\n329\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.150\nIt says all empty disks can be included\nin automatically if you wanted to.\n\n330\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.520\nAnd you can also have those controls\nthat are available as well.\n\n331\n00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.700\nSo it gives you that environment to\nbe able to do what you need to do\n\n332\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.460\nas far as storage goes.\n\n333\n00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.270\nAnd there's plenty of different\nones that are actually out there.\n\n334\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.010\nOkay?\n\n335\n00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:03.650\nSo in this particular environment, right,\nyou actually can see that availability.\n\n336\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.080\nIt's actually right there.\n\n337\n00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.468\nThe ability to turn on the virtual SAN,\nthe ability to do the DRS, you know.\n\n338\n00:18:10.468 --> 00:18:13.790\nAgain, make sure you actually\nunderstand what those functions are.\n\n339\n00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.230\nUnderstand at least those\nfeatures that are actually there.\n\n340\n00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.430\nMake sure that you can identify them.\n\n341\n00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.250\nWhen it comes down to the exam, right?\n\n342\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.228\nBecause it's actually\nthe associate level exam,\n\n343\n00:18:22.228 --> 00:18:24.352\nthey're not expecting you\nto be able to configure it.\n\n344\n00:18:24.352 --> 00:18:27.660\nThey do expect you to take\na look at some of the options.\n\n345\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.840\nSo go into VMWare if you haven't.\n\n346\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.550\nCreate an account there.\n\n347\n00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.940\nAnd then get access to this and\nplay around and\n\n348\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.350\nsee if you can actually figure\nout where those options are and\n\n349\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:43.680\nespecially understand that you're gonna\nhave choices in terms of storage.\n\n350\n00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.700\nDoesn't mean you know what all\nthose choices do at this point.\n\n351\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.932\nWe haven't shown you how to\nactually create a cluster,\n\n352\n00:18:48.932 --> 00:18:50.795\nwe haven't shown you how\nto do all that stuff.\n\n353\n00:18:50.795 --> 00:18:54.692\nBut you'll get to all that when\nyou actually move beyond this and\n\n354\n00:18:54.692 --> 00:18:56.146\ngo into the actual VCP.\n\n355\n00:18:56.146 --> 00:18:57.786\nBut just kind of at this point here,\n\n356\n00:18:57.786 --> 00:19:00.540\nbe able to identify that\nthe technology is there.\n\n357\n00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.170\nAnd the options that you have\navailable the main features,\n\n358\n00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:08.250\nyou should know that you know pretty\nmuch down pat before you take the exam.\n\n359\n00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.408\nOkay?\n>> Now Ronnie there's a few data stores\n\n360\n00:19:10.408 --> 00:19:14.190\nthat we also need to be familiar with\nwhen it come to this VCA6 exam correct?\n\n361\n00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.130\n>> There really is.\n\n362\n00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.450\nWhen it comes down to the idea\nof data storage, right.\n\n363\n00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:24.570\nWell let's make sure we understand that\nconcept here for a moment as well.\n\n364\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:30.250\nAnd so let me go back up here to the data\ncenter that we're talking about, okay.\n\n365\n00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.630\nNow when you take a look at\nthe idea of the data center\n\n366\n00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.870\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n367\n00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.071\nNotice that you could click right here,\n\n368\n00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:41.513\nand VMWare actually really did\ntry to make it ready for Ronnie.\n\n369\n00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.041\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think that's the easiest thing\n\n370\n00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:43.557\nto think about.\n\n371\n00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:44.440\n>> I like that.\n\n372\n00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.660\n>> Yeah, I think I'm ready for\nRonnie is actually the way,\n\n373\n00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.930\nbecause it's like, I need to create,\nDaniel said a data store.\n\n374\n00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.720\nIf he told me that, right, and\nI was just getting in there.\n\n375\n00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.960\nLike, how the heck do I do that?\n\n376\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.780\nWell, notice I can come\ndown here to basic tasks.\n\n377\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.040\nAnd there it is,\nI can add in a new data store and\n\n378\n00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.820\nwe're not really gonna add\nanother data store in here.\n\n379\n00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.709\nBut I wanna show you how simple it\nreally is to be able to do some of this\n\n380\n00:20:07.709 --> 00:20:09.250\nstuff, right?\n\n381\n00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.340\nSo first and foremost, it says look hey\nyou're gonna do this and it's gonna\n\n382\n00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.710\nbe where in site center A, let me reduce\nthat a little bit more so we can see it.\n\n383\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.580\nAnd then I click Next.\n\n384\n00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.800\nAnd notice this is what I mean\nby kind of Ronnie ready, right.\n\n385\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.600\nWhich one do I need?\n\n386\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.560\nNow here's where you actually have to know\na little bit more, okay, there is VMS,\n\n387\n00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.880\nI'm not gonna be able to say it, VMFS.\n\n388\n00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.100\nThe VMWares, a file system here.\n\n389\n00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:43.912\nSo create a VMFS data store on a disc or\na LUN.\n\n390\n00:20:43.912 --> 00:20:45.387\nI'm not gonna be able to do that.\n\n391\n00:20:45.387 --> 00:20:48.706\n[CROSSTALK] It's actually saying hey look,\nthat physical storage thing,\n\n392\n00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:51.139\nthat physical storage thing,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n393\n00:20:51.139 --> 00:20:52.980\nLet's just create a volume.\n\n394\n00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.990\nLet's create, what you're talking about,\nan appliance and\n\n395\n00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.070\nI don't care what it's on.\n\n396\n00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.830\nIt's on a LUN, it's on a disk,\nit's on anything.\n\n397\n00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.970\nLet's create the one that you want and\nusually,\n\n398\n00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.030\nthis is what is the basic data store for\n\n399\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.320\nstoring virtual machines, ISO files,\nany other files that we wanna store.\n\n400\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.940\nSo that we can get access\nto it from the host.\n\n401\n00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.840\nSo you can actually do\nsomething like this.\n\n402\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.680\nAnd it's a high speed type of\nformat designed by VMware,\n\n403\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.900\nof course that means what?\n\n404\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.360\nThey would love for\nyou to actually be able to use it here.\n\n405\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.300\nNow the advantage of actually doing this\nis actually in the number of devices\n\n406\n00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:32.010\nthat you can actually attach to\nwhen you take a look at VMFS, okay.\n\n407\n00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.510\nSo if you're actually going\nto do something like this,\n\n408\n00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.580\nwell what can you actually attach to?\n\n409\n00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.150\nWell, this particular type of virtual\nappliance that we're essentially creating\n\n410\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.130\non the data store,\nhere actually can be attached or\n\n411\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.800\nbe put onto things like direct\nattached storage, right?\n\n412\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.660\nWe can also add in fiber channel for those\nof you that are actually running fiber\n\n413\n00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.580\nchannel and\nfiber channel over ethernet as well.\n\n414\n00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.440\nRemember that fiber channel is\nits own proprietary technology so\n\n415\n00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.190\nit uses its own protocols and stuff.\n\n416\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.720\nIt's not bad.\n\n417\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.567\nit's actually great,\nvery expensive, but very great.\n\n418\n00:22:06.567 --> 00:22:11.130\nNow the other one though, I guess a newer\none is that fiber channel over ethernet.\n\n419\n00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.060\nThe advantage of this is instead\nof you having fiber channel and\n\n420\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:19.330\nthose fiber channel fabric, those cables\nand those switches and everything.\n\n421\n00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.652\nYou can actually use this over an actual\nswitch network like you and I.\n\n422\n00:22:23.652 --> 00:22:25.660\nI don't wanna say you and\nI, like I understand.\n\n423\n00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.360\nSo like Ronnie actually knows.\n\n424\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.741\nI don't really know anything about\nfiber channels, but you can actually\n\n425\n00:22:30.741 --> 00:22:34.410\ntake that technology and run it over just\nethernet technology instead as well.\n\n426\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.740\nAnd you might wanna like,\nshould I do that.\n\n427\n00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.650\nNot necessarily, right.\n\n428\n00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.540\nYou need someone that actually knows\na little bit more about networking to\n\n429\n00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.690\nchoose which one.\n\n430\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.140\nBut people like this because it's one\nless technology to have to master\n\n431\n00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.700\ninstead of actually going, okay ethernet.\n\n432\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.080\nWhat do you know about fiber channel?\n\n433\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.360\nI can go Daniel,\nwhat do you know about fiber channel?\n\n434\n00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.947\nAnd we're gonna look at each other and\ngo well we know how to spell it maybe.\n\n435\n00:22:54.947 --> 00:22:58.403\n>> I could write all my information that\nI know about fiber channel on the head of\n\n436\n00:22:58.403 --> 00:22:59.110\na pen, right?\n\n437\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.890\n>> Yeah, but by doing this,\n\n438\n00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.760\nright, what also ends up happening\nis that we find out something.\n\n439\n00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.070\nWe'd reduce our infrastructure\na little bit more.\n\n440\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.050\nWe can actually reduce kinda the number\nof cables that we need connecting in\n\n441\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.460\nto those devices, right.\n\n442\n00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.800\nI don't need a fiber channel NIC and\nan ethernet NIC,\n\n443\n00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.490\nI can actually just stick with ethernet.\n\n444\n00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:20.570\nSo I'm actually reducing the physical\nnumber of cables that I actually run to\n\n445\n00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.500\neach EXS host by using something like\nfiber channel or ethernet instead.\n\n446\n00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.010\nNow, is that an advantage?\n\n447\n00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.040\nI don't really know for\nsure, but it can be, okay?\n\n448\n00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.870\nSo you can actually use fiber channel over\nethernet as well, and iSCSI devices too.\n\n449\n00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.650\nYou name it, it can actually be done.\n\n450\n00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.060\nYou can even run this on a NAS,\n\n451\n00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:44.710\nbut on a NAS, you're limited by the very\nfact that you can only do IP networks.\n\n452\n00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.322\nSo if you do have existing fiber\nchannel go, I don't wanna just run IP,\n\n453\n00:23:48.322 --> 00:23:49.680\nI love my fiber channel.\n\n454\n00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.320\nWell, VMWare says what?\n\n455\n00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.707\nWe can attach to it, no big deal.\n\n456\n00:23:53.707 --> 00:23:56.846\nNow notice that the second\noption here is NFS, and\n\n457\n00:23:56.846 --> 00:23:59.852\nthis standard has been around for\na ton of time.\n\n458\n00:23:59.852 --> 00:24:04.181\nRemember that this limitation here\nis on IP networks as well, okay.\n\n459\n00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:08.790\nBut the advantage of NFS,\nno limits on the size.\n\n460\n00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.470\nYou continue to add and add and add,\nit will continue to grow with you.\n\n461\n00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.500\nYou've got plenty of time,\n\n462\n00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.380\nyou've got plenty availability that\nyou do whatever you actually want to.\n\n463\n00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:22.860\nSo it's actually being, this also of\ncourse gives you file level access.\n\n464\n00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.830\nWhereas in the VMFS,\nyou don't have file level access.\n\n465\n00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:31.330\nSo that's actually designed to help you do\nthe block storage more than anything else.\n\n466\n00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.400\nBut this one, though, means that you\ncan create a network share on it.\n\n467\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.940\nPeople can get access to it.\n\n468\n00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.520\nNo big deal at the same time.\n\n469\n00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.270\nSo it also depends on what you need.\n\n470\n00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:44.360\nNow there's also what we call\nvirtual volumes too, okay?\n\n471\n00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.770\nNow the virtual volume is kind of\na conglomeration of everything here, okay?\n\n472\n00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.080\nIt allows you now to create your own\narrays the way that you want to.\n\n473\n00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.300\nSo instead of you creating\nan appliance and you don't have.\n\n474\n00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.640\nYou can actually say look,\nI'm gonna have array level access.\n\n475\n00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.380\nIf I wanna build my own\nappliance the way I want to,\n\n476\n00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.060\nyou instead might actually\ncreate using this instead.\n\n477\n00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.350\nSo those are kind of the ones that you\nactually choose to end up doing if you do\n\n478\n00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.480\nthat and from that point, you of course,\nif you're gonna choose one of them.\n\n479\n00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.310\nYou get to choose those file locations.\n\n480\n00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.480\nYou give it a name.\n\n481\n00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.720\nIt begins to create it because\nit's all in the software.\n\n482\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.510\nWe're not walking through the whole thing.\n\n483\n00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:23.040\nBut those are some of the key points that\nyou want to make sure you understand\n\n484\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:31.220\nthe differences between the VMFS and NFS.\n\n485\n00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.960\nI don't think I'm gonna be able to\nsay more acronyms in one sentence.\n\n486\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.380\n>> You gotta be pretty happy that\nthat section of this series is over.\n\n487\n00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You better believe it.\n\n488\n00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.290\n>> Ronnie's like, I hope I don't\nhave to say VM that fast any longer.\n\n489\n00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.080\n>> No.\n>> Ever again.\n\n490\n00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.040\n>> Yes, it's like me trying to type.\n\n491\n00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.196\nI mean, that's horrendous.\n\n492\n00:25:46.196 --> 00:25:47.431\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:25:47.431 --> 00:25:48.329\n>> Well, Ronnie, what else do we gotta go\n\n494\n00:25:48.329 --> 00:25:49.770\nover?\nI know we're running\n\n495\n00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:50.840\na little short on time.\n\n496\n00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.520\nBut it's You have to do at\nleast one more concept right?\n\n497\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.220\n>> We do.\nWe have to actually talk about\n\n498\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.160\nthe use of that DRS just briefly right.\n\n499\n00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.490\nSo why would we choose to use\nthat distributed resource\n\n500\n00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.230\nscheduler if we need to?\n\n501\n00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.070\nWell the advantage of using this along\nwith the technologies that we've just\n\n502\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:13.140\ntalked about in implementing,\nwhether it's VMFS or whatever it might be\n\n503\n00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.110\nis the ability for us to actually\ndo the scheduling for you, right?\n\n504\n00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:21.440\nThe ability to place VMs in a smart way\nwhatever that actually need to across\n\n505\n00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.630\nnetwork to get the best benefit\nout of the storage infrastructure,\n\n506\n00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.850\nexcuse me, that you have on hand.\n\n507\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.770\nSo it allows you to be able to do\nload balancing if you need to do,\n\n508\n00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:35.520\nto move devices as we need to\nas we go on through there.\n\n509\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.210\nSo make sure you do take a look\nat that information completely.\n\n510\n00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.070\nBecause that's some other stuff that\nit really it does actually make the V\n\n511\n00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.110\nsphere and everything that we actually\nhave to work the way that we want to.\n\n512\n00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.420\nIs by making sure that we\nunderstand those concepts too.\n\n513\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.170\nOkay.\n\n514\n00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.970\nNow the other thing that I wanna\nshow you is this right here briefly.\n\n515\n00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:58.160\nSo Daniel I'm gonna throw you\nunder the bus just for a moment.\n\n516\n00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:58.790\n>> Okay, chuck me.\n\n517\n00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.120\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm not gonna do it too hard but, okay.\n\n518\n00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.700\nSo Daniel notice that nowhere did\nI actually show you a disk, right?\n\n519\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.800\nA physical disk.\n\n520\n00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.470\n>> That is true.\n\n521\n00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.210\n>> Yeah.\n\n522\n00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.680\nSo, this is something that's\nactually neat, in this sense.\n\n523\n00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.820\nIf you and I were having to monitor\nlike a SAN, we open it up and\n\n524\n00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.870\nwhat's the first thing that we see.\n\n525\n00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.970\nWe see disc drives, right?\n\n526\n00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:17.540\n>> A bunch of them.\n\n527\n00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.750\n>> That's what you see in\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n528\n00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.890\nAnd there's, the one that actually\nkills us is the one blinking red light.\n\n529\n00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:27.310\nAnd you're like great, you know that's\nthe going to have to be replaced later on.\n\n530\n00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.180\nWell here you're actually seeing\nthat inside of vSphere right?\n\n531\n00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.600\nSays look we're not going\nto worry about that stuff.\n\n532\n00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.060\nNot that, that stuff doesn't occur.\n\n533\n00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:35.720\nOkay?\n\n534\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.580\nThey're saying at the management level for\nsys admins like you and me, for\n\n535\n00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.950\nnetwork admins like you and me.\n\n536\n00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.410\nWhat are we worried about?\n\n537\n00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.030\nWe're worried do we have storage?\n\n538\n00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.860\nOkay?\n\n539\n00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.600\nIs that storage actually going to be\navailable when I need it to be available?\n\n540\n00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.100\nOkay?\n\n541\n00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.240\nWhen I create a VM do I need to\nknow where that device actually?\n\n542\n00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:55.850\nNo.\n\n543\n00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.660\nI really don't.\n\n544\n00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.940\nBecause inside of vSphere\nyou have this ability\n\n545\n00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.660\nto create what you need and\nhave it right there.\n\n546\n00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.750\nWe're not talking about\nthe physical devices anymore so\n\n547\n00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.200\nI didn't actually show anyone\na single physical disk.\n\n548\n00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.900\nNow here it actually says there is\na local disk and that's how you attach.\n\n549\n00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.690\nThere is this disk here.\n\n550\n00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:23.650\nBut its not really about the idea of\nthe disk itself its about say look we\n\n551\n00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:29.140\nare going to take the capacity of\nthe storage devices on my network.\n\n552\n00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.980\nAnd we're gonna manage them through this\none interface okay that's kind of a neat\n\n553\n00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:38.020\nbecause now as I create a VM I don't know\nif this on ESX host one, two, three,\n\n554\n00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.350\nfour, five, six who knows.\n\n555\n00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.930\nOkay but they is still run yes.\n\n556\n00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.640\nDo I have to worry if ESX host one\nis going down as my VM going down?\n\n557\n00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.480\nWe'll know by using distributed\nresource scheduler and\n\n558\n00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.160\nalso high availability says what,\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n559\n00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.410\nIt can monitor and move it wherever we\nactually need to, change up the location,\n\n560\n00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.440\nit will do all that for us.\n\n561\n00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.690\nAnd then in terms of adding in more and\nmore additional storage,\n\n562\n00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:07.240\nwell that's what those particular ideas\nof creating data stores are about.\n\n563\n00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.590\nYou don't have to actually go, man,\nwe're running out of storage right now.\n\n564\n00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.800\nAnd actually a funny story, right,\nwe bought a new storage appliance,\n\n565\n00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.490\nthe say that we implemented\nwe ran out of space.\n\n566\n00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.560\nThe day that we implemented\nwe ran out of space and\n\n567\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.070\nI'm like, I guess we need\nto buy the extension to it.\n\n568\n00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.410\nWell, again, adding the extension to it,\n\n569\n00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.270\nright, is something that shouldn't\ntake down the entire network.\n\n570\n00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:27.980\nOkay.\nIt's not something that should do that,\n\n571\n00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.450\nwe should be able to plug it in and\ndo that.\n\n572\n00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:35.240\nBy being able to do something that,\nwe buy that device, we plug in a network,\n\n573\n00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.100\nwe go ahead and we build particular\nvirtual data store that we want to.\n\n574\n00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.770\nAnd now we say all right,\nlets just put it into that cluster.\n\n575\n00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:43.870\nAnd watch it do what?\n\n576\n00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.050\nWatch it actually use the space.\n\n577\n00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.740\nDo you and i actually really have\nto understand all the ins and outs?\n\n578\n00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.980\nShould we?\nProbably.\n\n579\n00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.660\nBut what I'm saying is you don't have to,\nright.\n\n580\n00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.520\nIf you're actually at the management\nlevel, if you're at the domain admin\n\n581\n00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.420\nlevel, there are things which you\ngo hey Ronnie figure this out.\n\n582\n00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.570\nAnd Ronnie goes okay we'll try and\nfigure it out.\n\n583\n00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:06.290\nMay not be the best way, may not be\nthe fastest way, I'll get it done.\n\n584\n00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.240\nBut at the same time,\nif you need management and efficiency.\n\n585\n00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.850\nIf you need to be able to manage\neverything in your Data Center VMware\n\n586\n00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.110\nvSphere's says what?\n\n587\n00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.370\nLet me do it,\nwatch how I handle the storage.\n\n588\n00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.600\n>> Yeah it's so cool because basically\nonce you get the appliance on the network.\n\n589\n00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.720\nThen vSphere goes, hey,\nthere's an appliance out there.\n\n590\n00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.090\nI can talk to that appliance if you'd like\nme to, and then you build your data store.\n\n591\n00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.680\nYou put it in your clusters and\nyou get all that stuff configured and\n\n592\n00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.180\nworking like Ronnie said it.\n\n593\n00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.950\nThe great thing is the documentation for\nthis stuff is amazing.\n\n594\n00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.540\nThey make sure that you are able to\nactually configure these things cuz\n\n595\n00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.650\nwhat good's a product that no one\ncan use so it's so complex It's not.\n\n596\n00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.270\nThis is very simplistic.\n\n597\n00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.900\nthey make it as\nstraightforward as possible so\n\n598\n00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.550\nthat anybody that's really never even\nworked with the technology before\n\n599\n00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.880\nshould be able to sit down and\nget this kind of thing up and\n\n600\n00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.160\nrunning within a few days,\nif not a day, to be honest with you.\n\n601\n00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.710\n>> Yeah, a lot of it really does just,\nit's about what,\n\n602\n00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.900\nspending time in it, right.\n\n603\n00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.770\nSo, if I'm just lecturing to you which,\ndon't get me wrong, I've done\n\n604\n00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:06.130\nthat as well, but if I'm just lecturing\nto you and describing technology.\n\n605\n00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.640\nIt doesn't mean that you\nknow how it actually or\n\n606\n00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.120\nwhere it's actually gonna be found.\n\n607\n00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.760\nWell hopefully, by demonstrating that\ntoday, we at least showed you where you\n\n608\n00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.980\ncan find and actually showed you that\nvSphere does have the capability to do so.\n\n609\n00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.200\nBut it's gonna take you\ngetting in there right and\n\n610\n00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.840\nactually kind of playing around on your\nown here and being able to do this.\n\n611\n00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.840\nAnd the good thing is VMware\nagain even made that easy right.\n\n612\n00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.150\nIt's right from their site.\n\n613\n00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.900\nYou actually have the ability\nto have that free trial.\n\n614\n00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.710\nI'd take advantage of it.\n\n615\n00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:32.880\n>> Yeah I sure would too.\n\n616\n00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.000\nWell Ronny I know we have\nactually we do have quite a few\n\n617\n00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.330\nmore topics to cover in this\nover arching genre here.\n\n618\n00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:41.962\nBut our time is completely gone.\n\n619\n00:31:41.962 --> 00:31:42.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's out of here,\n\n620\n00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.750\nit's out of the ball park.\n\n621\n00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.580\nSo we're on to part two.\n\n622\n00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.010\nRonnie, look forward to seeing you\nthere and hearing what you have to say.\n\n623\n00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.940\n>> Sounds good.\n>> Teaching us lowerlings who aren't\n\n624\n00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.845\nquite on the Ron level.\n\n625\n00:31:50.845 --> 00:31:52.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we can do with VM Ware.\n\n626\n00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.390\n>> We thank you guys for joining us today.\n\n627\n00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.470\nHope to see you there as well.\n\n628\n00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.700\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT TV.\n\n629\n00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.440\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n630\n00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.340\n>> And I\"m Ronnie Wong.\n\n631\n00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:00.849\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n632\n00:32:00.849 --> 00:32:10.070\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:17.804\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:21.867\nAnd in today's episode we're\ncontinuing on with our VCA6 series,\n\n6\n00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:25.661\njoin us back in the studio for\nPart two on storage technologies.\n\n7\n00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:27.450\nIt's our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.050\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.990\n>> Well, thank you again for\n\n10\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.750\nhaving me back on as we continue\non with our storage technologies.\n\n11\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.130\nThere's a little bit more that\nwe need to take a look at and\n\n12\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.240\nthe reason why is because I talked way\ntoo long on Part one, of course, but\n\n13\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.080\nwe wanna actually continue on and take\na look at some of the technologies that\n\n14\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.610\nreally affect users more\nthan anything else.\n\n15\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.650\nOr even the network admins as\nfar as the management goes.\n\n16\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.290\nNow, one of the things that we tend to do,\nor network administrators,\n\n17\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.550\nserver administrators,\nsystem administrators,\n\n18\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.510\nwhatever you wanna call them,\nokay, is build VMs, right.\n\n19\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.360\nWell, the problem with building VMs\nwhen it comes down to storage is that\n\n20\n00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.300\nyou have a couple of different\nphilosophies here, okay.\n\n21\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.950\nOne, of course, is the system admin that\nsays, here's the server that I need.\n\n22\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.540\nAnd you ask how much\nstorage that they want.\n\n23\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.990\nAnd, Daniel, usually it's like,\nas much as you can get me.\n\n24\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.420\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n25\n00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.920\nOkay?\n\n26\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520\nAs much as you can give me.\n\n27\n00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.010\nWell, the problem with\nthat is fairly simple.\n\n28\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.540\nIs that may a tiny bit.\n\n29\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.140\nOkay?\n\n30\n00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.450\nOr it may actually be\nan incredible amount of space here.\n\n31\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.330\nBut somebody has probably\ncome up with a policy saying,\n\n32\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.700\nif you're gonna build a server, here's how\nbig of a storage space you're gonna get.\n\n33\n00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.990\n>> Be funny to hand that person\na floppy disk and say here you go,\n\n34\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.391\nthis is as much as I can give you.\n\n35\n00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:42.199\n[LAUGH]\n>> That would be funny if you could\n\n36\n00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:44.394\nactually do that and somebody-\n>> And still keep a job.\n\n37\n00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:46.250\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n38\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.220\nThat's one of the big problems right.\n\n39\n00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.930\nSo, what in the world started happening in\nthe world of virtualization was simple.\n\n40\n00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.520\nOkay?\n\n41\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.430\nIs that even as a home user, right?\n\n42\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.260\nYou go, all right.\n\n43\n00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.010\nSo here it is.\nI\"m gonna build a perfect VM of my\n\n44\n00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.810\nWindows XP or\nwhatever it might be that you wanna build.\n\n45\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.940\nAnd so\nyou actually go through the menu and\n\n46\n00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.870\nit actually offers you\nchances to actually build.\n\n47\n00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.880\nWell, you simply say it's gonna be\n60 gigs, or whatever it might be.\n\n48\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.730\nAnd then you go out and\nyou build that and you run it.\n\n49\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.920\nAnd the first time you launch into it and\nyou find out how much storage space\n\n50\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.350\nthat you have,\nit shows you that you have a potential.\n\n51\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.710\nYes, you have a 60GB hard drive, but\nyou're only using 10% of it, or something.\n\n52\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.718\nIt shows you that you're\nnot using very much.\n\n53\n00:02:27.718 --> 00:02:31.240\nAnd if you then go into your file system\nwhere you actually running that type 2\n\n54\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.840\nhypervisor.\n\n55\n00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.148\nYou actually see where the files that you\nlike very small it's maybe a gig maybe\n\n56\n00:02:37.148 --> 00:02:41.870\nthree or four gigs and like wait a minute\nI provisioned 60 gigs for this thing.\n\n57\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.830\nIt's only showing two or three and that\nis because of something that is called\n\n58\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.610\nthin provisioning it's what\nthat's technically called.\n\n59\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.420\nNow, in the Type-2 Hypervisor we'll write.\n\n60\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.350\nIn the hosted Hypervisor world,\nwe actually are clicking.\n\n61\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.890\nIt just tells you that the kind of\ndifferences between this, what we'll call\n\n62\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.880\nthick provisioning, there's what\nwe call thin provisioning, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.180\nAnd so\nwhen you start having something like that,\n\n64\n00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.630\nwell why do you choose one over the other,\nokay?\n\n65\n00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.690\nThick provisioning will do this step.\n\n66\n00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.340\nWhen you actually create that VM, okay,\n\n67\n00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.700\nwhat will end up happening is it will say,\nall right.\n\n68\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.520\nYou want a 60 gig hard drive?\n\n69\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.480\nHere's what I'm gonna do.\n\n70\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.330\nOn that particular appliance, I'm gonna\nactually make a file that's gonna be\n\n71\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.890\nthe hard drive and it's gonna be\n60 gigs in size immediately, okay.\n\n72\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.880\nAnd so you will have access to that and\nnobody else will have access to that\n\n73\n00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.890\ndisk storage space, that 60 gigs\nis yours and yours alone, okay.\n\n74\n00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.210\nSo that absolutely is something\nthat we can actually do, okay.\n\n75\n00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.060\nThin provisioning though,\nespecially on desktop appliances,\n\n76\n00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.440\nis something that's actually really\nneat because it conserves its space, and\n\n77\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.560\nit says, Ronnie, instead,\nwhen you actually create this hard drive,\n\n78\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.410\nwe're gonna actually say\nthat the 60 gigs is yours.\n\n79\n00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.320\nSo you can expand it out to 60 gigs,\nbut we're really only gonna take up\n\n80\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.540\nhow much space it's really\ntaking up right now, okay?\n\n81\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.950\nSo, in other words the machine can\nactually continue to expand up the 60 gigs\n\n82\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.050\nor if I shall ask you to remove stuff,\nit can actually collapse it down to\n\n83\n00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.360\nhow much space it actually is gonna\ntake up and take that away, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.550\nNow in this sense it actually does\nconserve then storage space and\n\n85\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.370\nthis is on that we wanna actually\nunderstand specially when we start\n\n86\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.740\ndealing with VMWare\nvSphere environment too.\n\n87\n00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.190\nSo the same thing does actually apply.\n\n88\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.140\nLet me show you here.\n\n89\n00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.780\nOkay, so when I go into my client here.\n\n90\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.620\nAnd I'm on the web\nconnection at the vSphere.\n\n91\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.330\nLet me zoom in just a little bit more.\n\n92\n00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.370\nAnd I want to create a vm.\n\n93\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.410\nThis is actually gonna be created\nright here on the cluster.\n\n94\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.560\nBecause I do have a cluster.\n\n95\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.650\nIf I right click I select new machine,\nvirtual machine, and I can select that.\n\n96\n00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.960\nAnd we're gonna walk through some of it.\n\n97\n00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.550\nWe're not going to actually create it but\nI wanted to show you the options and\n\n98\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.010\nwhere you actually do\nthe provisioning here.\n\n99\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.040\nSo its when you actually create a new\nvirtual machine that you'll do this.\n\n100\n00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.940\nSo if I click next, I'm gonna give it\na name and we'll call this one VCA6.\n\n101\n00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.360\nThat's what we'll call it.\n\n102\n00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.830\nAnd then it's asking me\nwhere do I wanna place it?\n\n103\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.940\nData center A, data center B?\n\n104\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.520\nI'm just gonna leave it at A for\nright now, and now it's gonna take a look.\n\n105\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.000\nAnd then it actually realizes\nsomething because I do not\n\n106\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.950\nhave some of the clustering technology\nturned on like DRS mode right?\n\n107\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.890\nDRS is not turned on, it's like Ronny\nyou're trying to put this on a cluster and\n\n108\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.900\nyou don't have it turned on and\n\n109\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.220\nthe problem is I'm not\ngonna allow you to do that.\n\n110\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.340\nSo what you have to do here is expand\nit out and pick one of the host.\n\n111\n00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.940\nNow if I had DRS turned on,\nI can leave it at a cluster and\n\n112\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.520\nsays I will decide where to put it,\nyou don't have to worry about it,\n\n113\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.680\nlet me decide,\nI'll put it in a best possible location.\n\n114\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.120\nSo we had all that technology turned on\nand ready to go, that's what we do but\n\n115\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.700\nbecause we don't I select the host\ncontinue on, and it makes it fairly easy.\n\n116\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.220\nI select that one and then there's\nactually other policies that are in place,\n\n117\n00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.530\nand this is what will affect us as well.\n\n118\n00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.680\nSo there's actually of course,\ndata store policies.\n\n119\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.980\nThere's a virtual volume,\nno requirements policy.\n\n120\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.840\nAnd then there's a virtual san\ndefault storage policy, you name it.\n\n121\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.311\nI'm just gonna leave it at the default and\nclick next here because I wanna us get\n\n122\n00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:06.053\nsomething else here, x could be on ESX6 cu\nthat's the actual ESX server we have and\n\n123\n00:06:06.053 --> 00:06:08.832\nthen I can select what\nother operating system and\n\n124\n00:06:08.832 --> 00:06:12.870\nlet's just do index here\njust because there.\n\n125\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.460\nNow is right here this is\nwhat I had to slow down and\n\n126\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.590\nactually kind of experience\nsomething else, okay.\n\n127\n00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.060\nNow when you take a look and say, look.\n\n128\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.290\n40 gig hard drive,\nwhat other choices would I make?\n\n129\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.780\nWell, normally with that default policy,\nyou make no other choices,\n\n130\n00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.220\nbut if I expand that out, let me now\nzoom in right here to the middle,\n\n131\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.680\nand that way we can actually take a look.\n\n132\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.930\nNotice the disprovisioning\nthat's all grayed out and\n\n133\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.130\nthat's due to one of those policies,\nright?\n\n134\n00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:43.220\nWhat VMware says is hey, let me decide\nwhat this disk should look like.\n\n135\n00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.800\nIt should expand or contract or\ndo whatever else we have.\n\n136\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.630\nAnd usually thin provisioning is that.\n\n137\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.657\nIt says if you say I\nneed a 40 gig hard drive,\n\n138\n00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:57.266\nI'll dedicate that 40 gig space to you,\nokay, but only when you really need it.\n\n139\n00:06:57.266 --> 00:07:01.547\nIf you don't need it I'm not gonna take up\na file that's gonna be your virtual hard\n\n140\n00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:05.080\ndrive here and\njust leave it at 40 gigs to take up room.\n\n141\n00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.310\nNow, can you do that?\n\n142\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.613\nYes, if you go back and\n\n143\n00:07:07.613 --> 00:07:11.523\nchoose that no requirement option\nthat will actually expand that,\n\n144\n00:07:11.523 --> 00:07:16.051\nthen let's have thick provision lazy\nzeroed and then they had Thick provision\n\n145\n00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:20.399\neager zeroed what the heck is the\ndifferent there when you have something?\n\n146\n00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:24.070\nWell, it actually depends on the drive\nthat you're gonna store this on.\n\n147\n00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.018\nIf I have data on that particular drive\nthat I'm gonna store data on, and\n\n148\n00:07:28.018 --> 00:07:30.345\nI don't want a chance of losing that data,\n\n149\n00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:34.155\nI'm gonna actually pick this\nthick provision lazy zeroed here.\n\n150\n00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:38.000\nOkay, if I want to make sure that file\nis actually expanded out to 40 gigs.\n\n151\n00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.940\nBut I wanna make sure I don't\noverwrite anybody else's data.\n\n152\n00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.150\nHere it is.\n\n153\n00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.540\nIt's actually gonna keep that data.\n\n154\n00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.604\nSo when they talk about lazy zeroed,\nand we're saying,\n\n155\n00:07:46.604 --> 00:07:48.920\nwe're not gonna overwrite\nspace that's taken up.\n\n156\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.140\nWe'll overwrite free space, but\n\n157\n00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.720\nwe're not gonna overwrite any\nspace that's already taken up.\n\n158\n00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.415\nEager zeroed it says look,\nyou need 40 gigs.\n\n159\n00:07:55.415 --> 00:07:58.334\nI'm gonna take up 40 gigs\nregardless where I put it,\n\n160\n00:07:58.334 --> 00:08:00.815\nif there's data there\nI'm gonna wipe it out.\n\n161\n00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:05.251\nI'm gonna zero it out completely and\nthat's the difference between that.\n\n162\n00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:07.675\nAnd then thin provision says,\nyou need 40 gigs.\n\n163\n00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:10.602\nThe actual appliance says,\nI'll give you 40 gigs, but\n\n164\n00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:14.500\nyou're only gonna take up the space\nthat you need up to the 40 gigs instead.\n\n165\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.650\nSo they'll provision the space but they'll\nonly really take up that much hard drive.\n\n166\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.490\nSo, here you see, by default,\nthe default policy is thin provisioning.\n\n167\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.110\nNow, this is where in our shop we probably\nwould have a little bit of a battle\n\n168\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.820\nof what we wanna do, and\nthe reason why is we found out something.\n\n169\n00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.780\nWhen you actually do this kind of,\nin Microsoft land, they call it dynamic,\n\n170\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.620\nis what they call it, right,\nbecause it expands and it contracts here.\n\n171\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.790\nWhat we found out in a production\nenvironment, that causes a lot of DiskIO,\n\n172\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:46.210\na ton of DiskIO because it's constantly\nrecalculating how much space that there\n\n173\n00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.430\nis, and that means more write cycles,\nand more compute cycles, you name it.\n\n174\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.350\nAnd so a lot of times when we actually\nbuild something for the production\n\n175\n00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.640\nenvironment, old Ronnie Wong here says\nhey, thick provision that sucker.\n\n176\n00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.040\nOkay, that's what he says.\n\n177\n00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.050\nNow, the default policy, in other words,\nVMware, guys that are smarter than me,\n\n178\n00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.100\nsay no, no, no,\nthin provisioning is the way you wanna go.\n\n179\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.720\nSo I hate to say it,\nmaybe thin provisioning is the way to go.\n\n180\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.850\nMaybe Ronnie's been wrong all this time.\n\n181\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.190\nSo you do have that issue there.\n\n182\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.500\nSo just kinda be aware if you're actually\ngonna be talking about provisioning, and\n\n183\n00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.950\nthick provisioning with them provisioning\nthat's where you actually set it up and\n\n184\n00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.060\nthat's what you have to know.\n\n185\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.320\n>> Maybe VMWare's a little better- [LAUGH]\nAt dynamic discs than Microsoft is.\n\n186\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.960\nThat very well.\n\n187\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.490\n>> No doubt.\n\n188\n00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.950\n>> You gotta remember VMWare's in\nthe business of doing virtualization.\n\n189\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.070\nMicrosoft is in the business\nof creating servers, and\n\n190\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.170\nthey do virtualization as well.\n\n191\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.060\nSo, if I had to put my money on one\nthat might have better performance,\n\n192\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.665\nI'm probably going to\ngo to the VM ware side.\n\n193\n00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:41.795\n>> [LAUGH] I would tend to agree.\n\n194\n00:09:41.795 --> 00:09:42.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n195\n00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.330\nlike I said, we've actually found that,\nwhen it comes down to what we've actually\n\n196\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.010\ndone in production, everytime we said,\ndo we want to try this?\n\n197\n00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.190\nIt does.\n\n198\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.520\nIt works so much slower than what we need.\n\n199\n00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.330\nWe normally make sure\nwe back that thing up.\n\n200\n00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.770\nWe create a new thick provision,\nand it just works so much better.\n\n201\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.570\nAnd so,\nthat's been our historical performance.\n\n202\n00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.970\nIf I get emails about Ronnie, you're\ncompletely wrong, I understand, okay?\n\n203\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.830\nBut at least historically, from what we've\ndone in the environment that we've worked\n\n204\n00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.320\nwe think provisioning is\nthe way to go onto production.\n\n205\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.670\nNow on my machine would I do that?\n\n206\n00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.570\nNo, because that would take up so\nmuch hard drive space on just VMs.\n\n207\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.320\nI wouldn't have any hard drive space left.\n\n208\n00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.800\nSo I always do thin provisioning there.\n\n209\n00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.870\n>> I believe I've actually\nseen that on Ron's computer.\n\n210\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.982\nI've never really looked at his drive.\n\n211\n00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:30.140\n[LAUGH] Not eight gigs, eight megs\nof space left, and to his credit,\n\n212\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.520\nit was still running like a champion,\nbut you did have to free some space up.\n\n213\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.540\n>> I did.\nI immediately freed space\n\n214\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.550\nup after that show.\n\n215\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.745\nBut yes, I have seen that happen, so\n\n216\n00:10:38.745 --> 00:10:42.345\nthat's one of the things that you\ndo need to think about, okay?\n\n217\n00:10:42.345 --> 00:10:43.175\nSo thin provisioning,\n\n218\n00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:46.715\nthick provision, remember that's how she\nhad the VM level as where we actually are.\n\n219\n00:10:46.715 --> 00:10:48.325\nSo we're not talking about the block,\n\n220\n00:10:48.325 --> 00:10:50.885\nwe're not talking about\nthe overall data center itself.\n\n221\n00:10:50.885 --> 00:10:53.805\nBut that's where you actually\nprovision your VM's to work.\n\n222\n00:10:53.805 --> 00:10:58.910\n>> Alright, well I guess a good\nnext stop to take this bus to,\n\n223\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.010\nis the SAN capabilities, right.\n\n224\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.850\nThis thing has a virtual SAN.\n\n225\n00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.670\nWe can use that,\nwe can make that a thing, and\n\n226\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.050\nit has some pretty cool features\nbuilt into that, right.\n\n227\n00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:08.820\n>> It really does.\n\n228\n00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.650\nWhen we start taking a look at the idea\nof implementing the virtual SAN\n\n229\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.050\nthe good thing is if you're\nrunning ESXi on it, and\n\n230\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.120\nyou do have your storage available and\nyou have multiple storage devices.\n\n231\n00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.900\nYou can actually create\nyour own virtual SAN.\n\n232\n00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.270\nAll the devices don't\nhave to be identical.\n\n233\n00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.770\nYou can actually create a SAN environment\nthe way that you want to which is actually\n\n234\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.800\na really neat thing, and\nit doesn't really cost you extra.\n\n235\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.190\nOkay now some of the things\nthat you do add into vSphere\n\n236\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.220\nIt does cost you a little bit more money.\n\n237\n00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.810\nIt does cost you a little\nbit more to make sure.\n\n238\n00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.490\nBut, when you actually end up creating\nthat cluster like we talked about,\n\n239\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.810\nit automatically gives you that ability.\n\n240\n00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.180\nSo, let's go back to my machine and\nlet's take a look, briefly again.\n\n241\n00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.140\nAnd, this is a reminder that we actually\nshowed this in an earlier episode as well.\n\n242\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.380\nSo, you remember I have this\nCluster A over here, Cluster Site A.\n\n243\n00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:57.750\nAnd, then when I select that,\nand I actually clicked on manage.\n\n244\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.740\nAnd then under settings you can\nsee here's all the services that\n\n245\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.840\nare actually available.\n\n246\n00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.430\nSo these things are turned on when you\nactually start clustering multiple EXX\n\n247\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.600\nservers together.\n\n248\n00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.440\nThere's that DRS, not turned on,\nthey actually are available to you,\n\n249\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.680\nI should say that cuz none\nof this is turned on.\n\n250\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.260\nSo DRS is available, there's that\nhigh availability and here it is.\n\n251\n00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.300\nVirtual SAN is available for you to\nactually be able to access as you need to.\n\n252\n00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.430\nSo if I click edit here, this is where\nyou can actually turn that on, and\n\n253\n00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.900\nnow you can actually take the appliances\nthat that cluster sees and\n\n254\n00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.500\ncreate your own virtual SAN, okay,\nget access to them, do what you need to.\n\n255\n00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.410\nNow you might being saying, okay, but\nwhy the heck would I choose to do that?\n\n256\n00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.870\nThe reason why you actually want\nto create this virtual SAN if you\n\n257\n00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.970\nactually have issues and problems here,\nis actually with the very fact that you\n\n258\n00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:48.910\nmight have some SANS that are older than\nother SANS and so, it's kinda strange.\n\n259\n00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:57.010\nWe have a, at least here on the network,\nwe have a SAN that has 16 drives in it and\n\n260\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:03.290\nit really has a kinda like a giga bit kind\nof connection to the rest of the network.\n\n261\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:07.120\nNow five years ago,\nthat was pretty pretty fast, okay.\n\n262\n00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.280\nNow, your kinda like, we need to\nget rid of it and go to ten gig.\n\n263\n00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.680\nGo to something else that is actually\nfaster, but at the same time,\n\n264\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.520\nwhen you start taking away you\nmight have devices like that right.\n\n265\n00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.380\nAnd you still wanna actually put\nthem into the virtual SAN and\n\n266\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.150\nbe able to create them together and\ndo that.\n\n267\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.180\nBut why, okay?\n\n268\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.480\nThe reason why is because you can\nactually take that now virtual SAN and\n\n269\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.650\nactually implement policies on it, okay?\n\n270\n00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.190\nNow why is that actually important?\n\n271\n00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.420\nIt's important especially because what you\ncan do is you can create a service level\n\n272\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.950\nkind of policy.\n\n273\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.080\nI know technically that's\nnot the actual word for it.\n\n274\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.400\nBut you can actually say look,\n\n275\n00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.940\nwhen it hits this particular\nlevel of connection or\n\n276\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.420\ndisk I/O whatever it is, you can tell the\nVirtual SAN you need to take action, okay?\n\n277\n00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.370\nSo Virtual SANs allow you\nto be able to do that.\n\n278\n00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.940\nAnd when you have some\nparticular action in which it\n\n279\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.420\nfalls below that\nprovisioning service level.\n\n280\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.270\nYou can say let's remediate that action.\n\n281\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.980\nIn other words,\nlet's see what we actually have to do and\n\n282\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.030\nmaybe move some of the data off that\nvirtual SAM on to other devices.\n\n283\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.200\nSo being able to ask to remediate\nfailures based on some type of policy\n\n284\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.710\nof non-compliance.\n\n285\n00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.370\nThat's what you're actually\ntaking a look at here.\n\n286\n00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.540\nSo virtual SAMs can be a very important\npart of your storage environment\n\n287\n00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.880\ninside a vSphere.\n\n288\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.450\nBut just kinda know that it's one of\nthe options that you have available for\n\n289\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.770\nyou, okay?\n\n290\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.540\nThe other thing, of course, is if you are\nactually one of those that really monitors\n\n291\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.590\nports, you wanna do the virtual sim, cuz\ninstead of you actually depending on that\n\n292\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.530\none interface, right,\nthat comes from the device.\n\n293\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.280\nDon't get me wrong,\nthat may give you all that you need.\n\n294\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.740\nIf you wanna take advantage of all\nthe monitoring that vSphere can do\n\n295\n00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.350\nImplement a virtual sand as well.\n\n296\n00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.460\nThat will give you kind of more, you know,\nbells and whistles and dashes and\n\n297\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.730\ndials and whatever else you wanna see.\n\n298\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:52.450\nSo if you need that monitoring that's\nwhat you also want to implement to.\n\n299\n00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.960\nSo vSans are actually the way to go.\n\n300\n00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.760\n>> Now Ronnie, you're talking about\ncapabilities and having bells and\n\n301\n00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.150\nwhistles and things to play with.\n\n302\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.410\nWe also have virtual volumes as\nsomething we need to be aware of for\n\n303\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.770\nthe VC exam as well, right?\n\n304\n00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.680\n>> Yes, virtual volumes kind of\nwork like virtual SANs do, okay?\n\n305\n00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.350\nSo it's kind of the same concept,\nof course, but it's different.\n\n306\n00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.310\nThat's the stupidest statement even,\nbut that's the way to go with it, okay?\n\n307\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.630\nVirtual sands allow us, and\nI've said this in a previous episode,\n\n308\n00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:25.770\nenable us to be able to\nhave array based access.\n\n309\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.770\nSo, if we only just want to say I want\nto pick this, and this, and this and\n\n310\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:33.060\nI want create my own arrays out of\ndevices then I'm gonna create it on tat\n\n311\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.320\nvirtual volume level instead, and\nthen I can actually manage it that way.\n\n312\n00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.530\nThe key thing here is again it\nactually goes to policy management\n\n313\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:41.560\nmore than anything.\n\n314\n00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.390\nIt's not about whether or\n\n315\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.870\nnot the device needs it, it's about\nhow you want to control it, right?\n\n316\n00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.750\nSo there's something, and\n\n317\n00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.640\nlet me make sure I get another\nacronym out here, SPBM, okay?\n\n318\n00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.444\nIt stands for\nStorage Policy Based Management.\n\n319\n00:15:54.444 --> 00:15:57.739\nAllows you now to take that virtual SAN,\nand\n\n320\n00:15:57.739 --> 00:16:02.727\nbe able to provide dynamic resources\nwhen you actually need it, so\n\n321\n00:16:02.727 --> 00:16:08.267\nthat's the key behind using the virtual\nvolume instead is that this way.\n\n322\n00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:11.014\nYou can actually take a lot\nof the information here and\n\n323\n00:16:11.014 --> 00:16:13.098\nactually create policies based off it.\n\n324\n00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:14.027\nAnd tell it,\n\n325\n00:16:14.027 --> 00:16:18.923\nhey I need to provision the storage\nbased off of the policy that I set,\n\n326\n00:16:18.923 --> 00:16:24.820\nnot off of what the ongoing or the onboard\nstuff says it should be done that way.\n\n327\n00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.550\nBut the way that I actually want\nto manage it is what you also have\n\n328\n00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.610\nthe ability to do.\n\n329\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.780\nSo volumes allow you essentially more\ncontrol than even what the virtual\n\n330\n00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.110\nSAN allows you.\n\n331\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.710\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n332\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.660\nBoth technologies are really good.\n\n333\n00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.960\nBut if you actually need\nmore detailed control,\n\n334\n00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.090\nvirtual volumes are the way to go.\n\n335\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.340\nThe storage policy based management\nis the way to also go as well.\n\n336\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.160\nRemember those two terms\ntogether is the key.\n\n337\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.700\nAnd when you're getting ready for\n\n338\n00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.560\nsomething you're actually\ngoing to face in the future.\n\n339\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.190\n>> I'm impressed.\nYou actually got storage base.\n\n340\n00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:54.990\nI can't do it.\n\n341\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.368\nYou're on a different level.\n\n342\n00:16:56.368 --> 00:16:57.910\n>> [LAUGH] I actually\nhad to look at my notes,\n\n343\n00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.860\nbecause these acronyms\nare starting to blend together.\n\n344\n00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.690\n>> They are.\nAnd it's not like they're small words.\n\n345\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.095\nIt's not four or five letter words.\n\n346\n00:17:03.095 --> 00:17:05.916\nThese are like huge chunky words\nthat you got to throw all together.\n\n347\n00:17:05.916 --> 00:17:07.982\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It can get a little confusing.\n\n348\n00:17:07.982 --> 00:17:11.450\nSo our recommendation to you as\na person studying for this exam.\n\n349\n00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.942\n>> Make sure you go over those and\nget them squared away in your head, so\n\n350\n00:17:13.942 --> 00:17:16.904\nthat when you see them on the exam,\n[SOUND] you're able to, yes, I know that.\n\n351\n00:17:16.904 --> 00:17:18.518\nThat's, what is that, storagey?\n\n352\n00:17:18.518 --> 00:17:20.026\nStoragey.\n\n353\n00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:20.746\nThat's a word.\n\n354\n00:17:20.746 --> 00:17:22.001\nI'm making things up on the fly now.\n\n355\n00:17:22.001 --> 00:17:24.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Storage policy based management.\n\n356\n00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.430\nYou wanna kinda know those\ntypes of terminology.\n\n357\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.762\nRonnie, anything else we need to know\nwhen it comes to storage and [CROSSTALK]\n\n358\n00:17:28.762 --> 00:17:30.503\n>> Absolutely, you better believe it.\n\n359\n00:17:30.503 --> 00:17:32.024\nThere's always more.\n\n360\n00:17:32.024 --> 00:17:34.404\n[CROSSTALK] There's something else.\n\n361\n00:17:34.404 --> 00:17:35.640\nAnd you're gonna love this one.\n\n362\n00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.690\nThere's something that we call\nstorage IO control, okay?\n\n363\n00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:44.610\nStorage IO control, or SOIC, or SOI, SIOC.\n\n364\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.602\nSee, I can't even remember.\n\n365\n00:17:45.602 --> 00:17:47.540\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just add a G and a F, and that's fine.\n\n366\n00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.725\n>> Yeah, add a couple more vowels,\nand we'll be there.\n\n367\n00:17:50.725 --> 00:17:52.101\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Sure, why not?\n\n368\n00:17:52.101 --> 00:17:58.441\nSo, SIOC, Storage IO, which stands for\ninput output control, okay?\n\n369\n00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:04.495\nNow, this is a technology that we do have\nwith inside of VSphere that really helps\n\n370\n00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:10.655\nus more than anything else, okay, is to\nprotect the performance levels of RVMs.\n\n371\n00:18:10.655 --> 00:18:12.873\nI know that that sounds strange but\nit's true,\n\n372\n00:18:12.873 --> 00:18:15.620\nit really helps us to protect\nthose performance levels.\n\n373\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.570\nNow, what do I mean by that?\n\n374\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.060\nWell with storage IO control,\nwhen that stuff is actually enabled,\n\n375\n00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.270\nit really does guarantee that\none particular VM is not\n\n376\n00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:32.340\ngoing to become the IO control resource\nhog as something is actually going on.\n\n377\n00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.795\nNow, we actually have a situation like\nthis happening on our encoding machine,\n\n378\n00:18:36.795 --> 00:18:37.410\nright?\n\n379\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:42.100\nEncoding is the hardest thing that\nyou will do to a computer, right.\n\n380\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.770\nIt pegs CPU, memory, hard drive,\nyou name it, it does everything.\n\n381\n00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.320\nAnd so, as far as performance goes,\nthat's what ends up happening.\n\n382\n00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.780\nWell, that can actually be,\n\n383\n00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.410\nwhen we talk about encoding, right, one\napplication saying look, the CPU is mine.\n\n384\n00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.280\nIt doesn't care what everything else does.\n\n385\n00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.850\nAnd, well,\nthink about that at an ESXI level, right.\n\n386\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.860\nI've got multiple VMs going on, okay?\n\n387\n00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.890\nAnd now one VM says what?\n\n388\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.100\nHey, I need to ramp up because I'm doing\nso much more than what you're doing.\n\n389\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:19.260\nAnd so it can take up all the IO for\nthat disk if it needs to.\n\n390\n00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.460\nAnd then what does that mean for\nthe other units?\n\n391\n00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.080\nThe same thing.\n\n392\n00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.042\nStarvation, right?\n\n393\n00:19:23.042 --> 00:19:27.000\nThe very fact is they won't be able to get\nthe IO level the way that they need to.\n\n394\n00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.970\nDoes it mean that they'll\nstop functioning?\n\n395\n00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:29.950\nNo, it doesn't mean that.\n\n396\n00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.400\nIt means that they absolutely have\nthat ability, okay, to continue on.\n\n397\n00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.550\nBut with SIOC, it can monitor for that.\n\n398\n00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.842\nAnd it could say look, okay,\n\n399\n00:19:38.842 --> 00:19:42.410\nwhat we gonna do is we're gonna\nguarantee certain levels here, okay.\n\n400\n00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.434\nOne device is not gonna always\noverpower another one, okay.\n\n401\n00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:49.014\nThe other one when I actually started\nsensing that something like that is\n\n402\n00:19:49.014 --> 00:19:53.092\nhappening, I will move it over\nto another disk, that says what?\n\n403\n00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:56.429\nThe IOs are a little better here,\nokay, we need to and try and\n\n404\n00:19:56.429 --> 00:20:00.620\nload balance them out is essentially\nwhat the storage IO does.\n\n405\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.810\nNow, when you take a look at that.\n\n406\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.210\nThis is where it actually is a little\nbit tricky in the interface.\n\n407\n00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.810\nSo let's take a look here briefly as well.\n\n408\n00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.010\nSo, everything that we've been doing has\npretty much been centered around this idea\n\n409\n00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.090\nof the cluster.\n\n410\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.100\nBut notice that up here\nin the navigation pane,\n\n411\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.550\nyou also have this little disk here,\nright?\n\n412\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.208\nThat says storage if you hover over it.\n\n413\n00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:23.207\nAnd so if I click on that now, and\nnow notice that it's actually in\n\n414\n00:20:23.207 --> 00:20:27.602\nthe site itself but now I'm focused\non only the storage device itself.\n\n415\n00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:32.951\nAnd so here is that clustered\nstorage device and if I select that,\n\n416\n00:20:32.951 --> 00:20:37.145\nnotice that in the manage tab and\nthen in settings.\n\n417\n00:20:37.145 --> 00:20:40.457\nIf I go over here,\nI can see Datastore Capabilities and\n\n418\n00:20:40.457 --> 00:20:43.460\nit says storage IO control is disabled.\n\n419\n00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.750\nIf I click edit,\nthis is where I can turn this on.\n\n420\n00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.740\nAnd so it says storage IO control\nis used to control the IO\n\n421\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:54.390\nusage of virtual machines and\ngradually enforce predefined share loads.\n\n422\n00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.837\nThat's what it is saying is that hey,\n\n423\n00:20:55.837 --> 00:20:59.980\nI can guarantee that even if that guy's\nactually saying I'm gonna hog everything,\n\n424\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.450\nwhatever level you set each VM at,\nI can manage that.\n\n425\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.940\nI can control it for you.\n\n426\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.570\nSo you want to enable that,\nyou simply select that and there it is.\n\n427\n00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.940\nAnd notice there's\nthe congestion threshold.\n\n428\n00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.120\nAnd then you can actually\nselect those levels.\n\n429\n00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.280\nAnd even include in statistics\nif you want to to actually help\n\n430\n00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.530\nmake that more granular and\nmore detailed in the way that you want.\n\n431\n00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:22.670\nSo it really is a neat\ntechnology especially when you\n\n432\n00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.190\nhave a ton of virtual machines.\n\n433\n00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.977\nNot the three or four or\nfive that I may run, but the 50 or 60 or\n\n434\n00:21:28.977 --> 00:21:31.350\n70 that you may run.\n\n435\n00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:36.070\nSomething like this is actually the one\nthat says I can manage all that stuff.\n\n436\n00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.170\nLet me do it.\n\n437\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.990\nThat's the way to actually go with\nthis idea, especially when you\n\n438\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.010\nhave a lot of virtual machines that need\naccess to all that storage and, of course,\n\n439\n00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:46.150\nhigh performance as well.\n\n440\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.100\n>> Yeah, Ronnie.\nThis really seems like the cherry on\n\n441\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.820\ntop of the proverbial cake.\n\n442\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:54.010\nHere when it comes to storage in a virtual\nenvironment using VSphere, VMware.\n\n443\n00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.820\nBecause it's saying you know what,\nI'm not gonna allow one poor little\n\n444\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.670\nappliance out there to be the one\nthat gets hammered all the time.\n\n445\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.930\nI'm gonna try to distribute that burden\nall out amongst all the other drives.\n\n446\n00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.230\nAnd say you know I'm gonna find\nan area that's not as as utilized and\n\n447\n00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.510\nlet that take some of the burden.\n\n448\n00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.150\nAll the monitoring it does is\ninsane to be honest with you.\n\n449\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.060\n>> It really is and\nthere's a technical term, of course,\n\n450\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.700\nI need to throw out there, right.\n\n451\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.340\nSo, what it really is doing for\n\n452\n00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.320\nthose virtual machines is giving it\nwhat we call preferential IO, okay?\n\n453\n00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.705\nSo, Daniel,\nI talk like this all the time, right?\n\n454\n00:22:28.705 --> 00:22:31.267\n[LAUGH] I mention preferential IO.\n\n455\n00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:32.420\n>> Daily speech.\n\n456\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.590\n>> Daily talk that we actually mention.\n\n457\n00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:40.140\nBut no, that's a term that you do want to\nassociate with storage IO control as well.\n\n458\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.920\nAgain, for your future and\nthe near future, is what I'm meaning here.\n\n459\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.270\nBut just make sure that you\nunderstand that, right?\n\n460\n00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:51.250\nThat way when you talk about making sure\nthat VMs can actually get the performance\n\n461\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.470\nthat they need regardless how all\nthe other VMs are performing,\n\n462\n00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.730\nthat's what you actually want.\n\n463\n00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.106\nIs you want to make sure\nthat that's implemented,\n\n464\n00:22:57.106 --> 00:22:58.370\nthat's one of the technologies.\n\n465\n00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.640\nYou want to understand that it's\nreally providing the VM with that\n\n466\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.370\npreferential IO type of treatment.\n\n467\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.470\nMake sure I'm saying it.\n\n468\n00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.620\nYeah.\nDuring that resource congestion,\n\n469\n00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.700\nis what happens, so as more resources\nget congested, it says, no, no.\n\n470\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:18.080\nI need to keep that amount of IO ready for\nmy VM to be ready to perform as needed,\n\n471\n00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.490\nor I can move it off to another device, if\nyou actually implemented virtual volumes.\n\n472\n00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.275\nYeah, virtual volumes,\nI couldn't remember.\n\n473\n00:23:25.275 --> 00:23:28.250\nSANs, yeah,\nall that actually works together, right?\n\n474\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.380\nSo, all the stuff we've talked\nabout in this episode and\n\n475\n00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.910\nthe previous one, they integrate together.\n\n476\n00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.860\nI couldn't have done that.\n\n477\n00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.520\nSomebody like VMWare, VSphere, they're\nlike, yeah bring it on, we've got it.\n\n478\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.630\n>> And they've done a crack\njob of that as we can see.\n\n479\n00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.850\nA lot of really cool software.\n\n480\n00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.640\nThey've done a really good job\nof trying to make this simple.\n\n481\n00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.570\nBut we do need to understand these terms.\n\n482\n00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.570\nAnd understand what\ntheir technologies are.\n\n483\n00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.160\nHow they work and what they're meant for.\n\n484\n00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.700\nSo you can pass your exam.\n\n485\n00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.630\nI want you guys to get\ncertified out there.\n\n486\n00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.330\nRonnie, anything else we need to\ncover before we wrap up the show?\n\n487\n00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.040\n>> Not in terms of covering for\nknowledge sake but just again,\n\n488\n00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.750\nI can't emphasize this enough.\n\n489\n00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.640\nIf you think that,\n\n490\n00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.520\nhey I'm just gonna listen to this and\nI'll be able to take the exam.\n\n491\n00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.380\nI'm not gonna say you can't,\nit depends on your experience.\n\n492\n00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:17.350\nBut my suggestion again, get some\nexperience inside of VMware, right?\n\n493\n00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.380\nVSphere 6, go ahead and take a look at it.\n\n494\n00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.050\nLearn where these things\nactually are located.\n\n495\n00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.160\nIt's gonna at least help prepare\nyou as you go on towards your,\n\n496\n00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.660\nwhat do I wanna say?\n\n497\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.246\nVCP, not VCP but whatever it is next, VLP.\n\n498\n00:24:30.246 --> 00:24:31.696\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n499\n00:24:31.696 --> 00:24:33.990\nthe certified professional, VCP 6.\n\n500\n00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:38.210\nIt's gonna help you there, but it will at\nleast help you to relate the concepts that\n\n501\n00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.750\nwe mentioned through this show back\nto something that's actually real,\n\n502\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.430\na real product.\n\n503\n00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:46.120\nSo the better associations, the more that\nyou actually take a look at it, the better\n\n504\n00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.920\noff you're gonna be and you're gonna\nprepared for the exam even better as well.\n\n505\n00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.460\n>> All right, well Ronnie,\nthank you so much for\n\n506\n00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.200\nsharing your knowledge with us today.\n\n507\n00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.255\nWe appreciate every time you stop by and\ndo that for\n\n508\n00:24:56.255 --> 00:25:00.327\nus so we can get prepared and\nlike you said get ready for that exam and\n\n509\n00:25:00.327 --> 00:25:03.559\nmaybe even bump it up a notch\ndown the road as it were.\n\n510\n00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:06.166\nBut we've come to the end of yet\nanother great episode.\n\n511\n00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:07.709\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n512\n00:25:07.709 --> 00:25:10.861\nAnd even learned something [LAUGH],\nGod help us all.\n\n513\n00:25:10.861 --> 00:25:11.523\n>> Maybe.\n\n514\n00:25:11.523 --> 00:25:12.404\n>> That's right.\n\n515\n00:25:12.404 --> 00:25:15.064\nThat being said,we're going to go\nahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n516\n00:25:15.064 --> 00:25:16.341\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n517\n00:25:16.341 --> 00:25:17.304\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n518\n00:25:17.304 --> 00:25:19.719\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n519\n00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:27.390\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITproTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:17.407\nI’m your host Daniel and\n\n4\n00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:21.890\ntodays episode that’s right we are moving\nforward are VCA with our six series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.000\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help lend his expertise on that very\n\n6\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.060\ntopic is our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.150\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.290\nHow's it going?\n>> Well thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.490\nhaving me back as we continue taking\na look at our VCA6 series here.\n\n10\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.310\nWhat we're actually taking a look at\ntoday of course is gonna be networking\n\n11\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.240\ntechnology that we tend to find\ninside V sphere six as well.\n\n12\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.780\nNow, in terms of networking, this is\nwhere the data center virtualization also\n\n13\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.150\nmay actually extend a little bit beyond\nthose of us that actually just only done\n\n14\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.880\nthe idea of server virtualization or,\nof course, desktop virtualization.\n\n15\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.030\nIn other words, just bringing up\none on our hosted hypervisor two,\n\n16\n00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.360\nso when we take a look at it, we've\nactually done a little bit of it,right.\n\n17\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.810\nAnd we've had any experience\nwith virtualization at all.\n\n18\n00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.460\nMore than likely what has had to happen\nis once you created your particular VM,\n\n19\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.750\nyou needed to connect it to the outside\nworld, and the nice thing is\n\n20\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.480\nmost of the hosted ones by default\nautomatically connect it for you.\n\n21\n00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.350\nSo you bring it on, you turn it on,\nyou actually know something right away.\n\n22\n00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.490\nIt gives you an IP address, which you go,\n\n23\n00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.870\nI don't know where the heck\nit got the IP address from.\n\n24\n00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.190\nBut then you actually open up a browser\nand you can connect out to the internet.\n\n25\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.210\nWell that's what we call\nvirtual networking.\n\n26\n00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940\nOkay.\nThe very fact is.\n\n27\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.840\nWhat is it doing?\n\n28\n00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.910\nOkay, inside of that particular VM, right.\n\n29\n00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.700\nIt actually includes in\nvirtualized hardware.\n\n30\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.220\nAnd one of those pieces of hardware is\nthe gonna be of course the Nick itself,\n\n31\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.870\nis what it virtualizes.\n\n32\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.290\nAnd then it also of course has\nto connect out to the world\n\n33\n00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.710\nto do all of the other things it needs to.\n\n34\n00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.090\nAnd because if you actually\ntake a look a little bit more,\n\n35\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.840\nyou actually see it ends up doing natting.\n\n36\n00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.780\nSo it actually may include a router as\nwell as a switch and everything else.\n\n37\n00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.120\nAnd you were like are you joking me?\n\n38\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.470\nNo, Inside of that particular little\nVM itself has everything built into it.\n\n39\n00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.040\nSo that's what we're\ntalking about today too.\n\n40\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.800\nNow when we get into the data\ncenter level of things we're\n\n41\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.080\nactually moving beyond that one and\nsaying that we can actually do this.\n\n42\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.310\nWhere we can actually manage\nall of those virtual machines,\n\n43\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.270\ncuz each one will actually\nend up having a nick itself.\n\n44\n00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.920\nAnd also of course, we'll have\nwhat we call virtual switches, and\n\n45\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.900\nwe may even have other virtual\ntypes of storage appliances.\n\n46\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.340\nThat or not storage, excuse me security\nappliances, router appliances,\n\n47\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.850\nyou name it, they're all out there.\n\n48\n00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.280\nThat can help us to do all of the things\nthat we need to do in terms of networking.\n\n49\n00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.990\nOkay.\n\n50\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.170\nSo remember when we compare and\ncontrast them, right.\n\n51\n00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.410\nIn a physical instance here, every\nmachine that you tend to have of course,\n\n52\n00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.210\nin terms of networking,\nwill have at least one nick, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.360\nAnd the nice thing is you can add in more.\n\n54\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.820\nAfter awhile you actually\nrun out of space, and\n\n55\n00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.490\nthe same thing will also happen\non the virtual machine too.\n\n56\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.760\nIs that you can add in just so\nmany virtual nicks, and each one of those,\n\n57\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.780\nthen you can actually attach to,\nwell another appliance.\n\n58\n00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.870\nYou can actually attach\nthat to a virtual switch.\n\n59\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.280\nWell in the physical world,\nthat's what normally also happens too.\n\n60\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.420\nYou take a niche, you add a cable into it,\nand you attach it to a switch, and\n\n61\n00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.170\nthen you're off and\nready to go at the other end.\n\n62\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.600\nSo there are actually nice parallels\nbetween the virtual world and of course,\n\n63\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.760\nthe actual physical world in terms of the\ncomponents that you need in networking.\n\n64\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.210\n>> So Ronnie we're gonna be able to\ntake our basic networking knowledge and\n\n65\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.890\njust apply that to the virtual world that\nwe have with VMware and not have to really\n\n66\n00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.320\nlearn, you don't have to relearn basic\nnetworking is what you're saying.\n\n67\n00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.900\nWhat we do need learn is VMware and\nhow VMware\n\n68\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.810\nactually handles things like switching and\nrouting and adding and all that.\n\n69\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.380\nI guess a good way to go is\nwhere should we start with that?\n\n70\n00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.620\n>> Yeah,\nwe'll start taking a look then, right.\n\n71\n00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.250\nYou wanna make sure that you\nunderstand that there are some\n\n72\n00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.360\ndifferent technologies that are actually\nbuilt into vsphere that's gonna help out.\n\n73\n00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.920\nBut it really does begin\nwith at least a concept,\n\n74\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.790\njust like what Danny was talking about.\n\n75\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.060\nIs understanding that every single VM\nthat's going to be networked at some point\n\n76\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.160\nhas to of course connect\nto a virtual NIC itself.\n\n77\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.220\nSo that NIC usually is going to\nbe kind of a software version\n\n78\n00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.400\nof the physical NIC that\nyou have in that host.\n\n79\n00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.180\nNow it doesn't always have to be,\nbut usually it is.\n\n80\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.150\nAnd most hosted software environments\nlike VMWare Workstation or\n\n81\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.950\na VMware fusion like what I'm running.\n\n82\n00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.735\nIt does,\nit essentially takes your neck, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:41.660\nAng it makes a virtual copy of it and then\nthat way it actually thinks it's actually\n\n84\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.076\nreally has it's own neck of\nthat same variety in flavor.\n\n85\n00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:50.340\nIn inside a though, you can actually\njust connect it to, well what we call,\n\n86\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.430\nwhatever the that is, whatever neck]\nthat is, you can actually connect it to\n\n87\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.050\none that actually aggregates all of\nthe actual network capacity together.\n\n88\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.780\nAnd give it much more access to more\nnetworking capability than you had,\n\n89\n00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.640\nin other words, bandwidth than,\nyes you had at the beginning.\n\n90\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.870\nSo when it comes down to it what\nare we actually doing in terms of\n\n91\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.690\nthe devices here?\n\n92\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.810\nWell let's go ahead and show you how\nthis actually integrates into VMware and\n\n93\n00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.460\nwatch and\nshow you some of the components too.\n\n94\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.830\nSo when we start talking about\nvirtual networking inside of.\n\n95\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.040\nOkay?\nSo here's our standard web client and\n\n96\n00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.070\nusually it defaults to\nthis view right here.\n\n97\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.430\nSo I'm at the home screen where\nyou actually see everything,\n\n98\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.890\nnot the home screen, but\nthe actual view here on host and clusters.\n\n99\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.170\nBut notice up here at this top bar,\n\n100\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.950\nI'm gonna go over to this little icon here\nthat says networking and when I do so\n\n101\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.450\nI'm gonna click and\nchange our view just a little bit.\n\n102\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.650\nAnd you'll see the icons change over\nhere in this navigation area as well.\n\n103\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.832\nAnd then, here's what it breaks down to.\n\n104\n00:05:46.832 --> 00:05:50.060\nI'm gonna make sure I click on\nthat very first tab here, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.360\nSo when it comes down to some of the\ndifferent things in virtual networking,\n\n106\n00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.070\nwe have what we call\nvirtual standard switches.\n\n107\n00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.220\nThe older acronym for it is lower case\nv and then SS for standard switch.\n\n108\n00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.220\nBut in todays documentation\nyou don't see that written out\n\n109\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.160\nthat way too much anymore.\n\n110\n00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.020\nSo this is kinda the first beginning here.\n\n111\n00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.680\nHow the software got representation\nof what they put inside of ESX.\n\n112\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.070\nNow, this actually means that is a virtual\nswitch running when you actually have ESX.\n\n113\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.600\nAnd every single virtual machine\nthat you create inside of EXX,\n\n114\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.830\nESXX, ESX,\nI'm not gonna be able to say that.\n\n115\n00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.750\nEvery single one that you create ends up\nattaching itself to what we call this\n\n116\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.300\nvirtual standards switch here, okay.\n\n117\n00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.610\nSo every single virtual\nmachine by default,\n\n118\n00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.060\nactually gives you that ability to\nconnect into at least one network, okay.\n\n119\n00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.450\nNow do you have to connect it?\n\n120\n00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.270\nNo.\n\n121\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:52.000\nInside of the Vmware, excuse me,\nand vmwares, vmwares.\n\n122\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.950\nThat's really gonna be\nconfusing nevermind,\n\n123\n00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.080\ninside every single virtual machine you\nactually have the ability to create from\n\n124\n00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.072\none to I think four actual virtual necks.\n\n125\n00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:07.080\nActually, I'm telling you zero to four,\nI said one.\n\n126\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.440\nBut a zero, so you can actually have none.\n\n127\n00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.030\nThat's the lowest number\nof nicks that you can have.\n\n128\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.800\nAnd then I think that you\ncan have a maximum of four.\n\n129\n00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.045\nSo every VM can actually attach between\none to four network connections if\n\n130\n00:07:18.045 --> 00:07:19.270\nyou want to.\n\n131\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.130\nAnd usually when you do,\n\n132\n00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.680\nso they attach into what we call\nthis virtual standard switch here.\n\n133\n00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.090\nThat will give them access to other VMs.\n\n134\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.190\nThat are actually representing something\nthat we call their own port group.\n\n135\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.590\nIt will also give them access to\nthe physical world that's also\n\n136\n00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.830\nout there in the world as well.\n\n137\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.315\nWhen you do select this, if you actually\ncan create these it says, a network\n\n138\n00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:44.650\nstandard, excuse me I'm just going to zoom\nin, that will make it a little bit easier.\n\n139\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.420\nA network with a standard switch\nis a network of virtual machines\n\n140\n00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.960\nrunning on a single physical machine.\n\n141\n00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.853\nSo if you're only talking about one EXS,\none ESX host.\n\n142\n00:07:53.853 --> 00:07:55.931\nI know that's gonna kill me.\n\n143\n00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:58.737\nThat's what your talking about you're\ndealing with in terms of virtual\n\n144\n00:07:58.737 --> 00:08:01.744\nnetworking is one standard switch,\nokay, is what's going to happen here.\n\n145\n00:08:01.744 --> 00:08:05.402\nAnd so you can actually see where\nthey can send data to each other\n\n146\n00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.450\nas well as actually\nconnect out to the world.\n\n147\n00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.025\nAnd this is kinda the weird thing for\n\n148\n00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:13.122\nme at the beginning cuz I didn't\nunderstand how this worked here when I\n\n149\n00:08:13.122 --> 00:08:16.926\nfirst started with virtualization is that\nI can have three or four virtual machines.\n\n150\n00:08:16.926 --> 00:08:19.860\nBut they're really only connecting\nout through one physical NIC, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.920\nAnd that's because the way\nit virtualizes it, and\n\n152\n00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.810\nthat NIC can handle\nthe traffic between them.\n\n153\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.120\nSo this is the same thing,\nis what you're seeing,\n\n154\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.990\nis essentially that\nsoftware representation\n\n155\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.540\nof the NIC that you tend to have on\nthat particular machine there, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.848\nNow the advantage of this type of NIC\nthough is that even though on most\n\n157\n00:08:38.848 --> 00:08:43.828\ndesktops here, right, you're gonna see\nthat there's gonna come a point when\n\n158\n00:08:43.828 --> 00:08:46.384\nyou can actually do too much to that NIC.\n\n159\n00:08:46.384 --> 00:08:48.080\nOkay, so in other words you can send so\n\n160\n00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.570\nmuch traffic to where it actually\ndoesn't perform well anymore.\n\n161\n00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.830\nIn theory on the standard\nswitch you can have up\n\n162\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.110\nto 120 devices connected to that one.\n\n163\n00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.836\nSo even though it actually allows\nyou to have up to 2,048 machines,\n\n164\n00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:08.338\nessentially only 120 of them are really\nactually kind of connecting to each other\n\n165\n00:09:08.338 --> 00:09:14.040\nat any one millisecond or microsecond,\nwhatever you wanna call it, at a time.\n\n166\n00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.716\nSo there is a limitation to the number\nof what they call logical ports\n\n167\n00:09:18.716 --> 00:09:20.530\nthat you have in that too.\n\n168\n00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.941\nOkay, so they can actually\ntalk between each other, and\n\n169\n00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:28.510\nyou have that 120 port instance\nthere that you have to worry about.\n\n170\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:32.270\nNow the other thing, of course,\nis if you have multiple NICs then, well,\n\n171\n00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.200\nevery single NIC that you have on\nthat host can be aggregated together.\n\n172\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.150\nSo that way, let's say for example,\n\n173\n00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.440\nif they're each gigabit network adapters,\nright?\n\n174\n00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.770\nIf you have four of them\non the physical host,\n\n175\n00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:49.470\nthat means you can actually give\nup to 4 gig connections across for\n\n176\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.240\njust about every machine that's gonna\nbe virtualized on there as well.\n\n177\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.150\nSo you can actually share that\nbandwidth across them too.\n\n178\n00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:59.255\nNow the only other thing that you have to\nworry about, right, is that there's also\n\n179\n00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:04.585\nof course to that virtual switch,\nit has to connect to the physical switch.\n\n180\n00:10:04.585 --> 00:10:05.150\nSo yes,\n\n181\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:11.040\nyou have to take up one of those 120 port\nconnections that you'd make to a VM.\n\n182\n00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.110\nSo, technically even though\nthey tell you 120 VMs,\n\n183\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:18.630\none of those ports is actually gonna be\na connection to the physical NIC itself.\n\n184\n00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:24.563\nAnd that's what they call a dvUplink\ninstead, if I remember correctly.\n\n185\n00:10:24.563 --> 00:10:27.140\nYeah, I think it's called a dvUplink.\n\n186\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.600\nSo when you start taking look at that,\n\n187\n00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.820\nthere are some things that\nactually allow you to do this.\n\n188\n00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.074\nNow, you might be wondering,\nwhy the heck is this important?\n\n189\n00:10:34.074 --> 00:10:38.391\nWell, if you're gonna connect into VMware,\nfor VMware to be able to manage ESX host,\n\n190\n00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:43.380\nright, through software, it can't manage\nthe physical NICs on every single host.\n\n191\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.600\nSo this standard switch here,\n\n192\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.530\nthis virtual machine switch essentially\nis kind of the connection point, right?\n\n193\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:55.133\nSo that your ESX host can now also have\nits networking begin to be managed by\n\n194\n00:10:55.133 --> 00:10:56.220\nvSphere.\n\n195\n00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.970\nSo that's really kind of the first\nthing here that you end up doing.\n\n196\n00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.353\nNow when you start taking look at\nswitches, right, standard switches\n\n197\n00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:09.112\nas well as physical switches, I only\nhave one drawing that I'm showing you.\n\n198\n00:11:09.112 --> 00:11:11.180\nAnd I hope this makes\na little bit more sense.\n\n199\n00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.100\nRemember that the operations\nthat happen on a switch\n\n200\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.480\nreally happen in what we call\ntwo different planes here, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.920\nIf you're talking about configuration on\nswitches, there is, of course, another\n\n202\n00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.640\nlayer of software, if you wanna call it,\nthat it's only about configuration.\n\n203\n00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.680\nSo when you actually configure a port or\n\n204\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.500\na VLAN and stuff, you're doing that in\nwhat's called the management plane, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.740\nEverything on the switch as far as data\ngoes, port forwarding, filtering, tagging,\n\n206\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.370\nVLAN tagging, you name it,\n\n207\n00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.240\nall that other stuff happens on\nwhat we call the data plane, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.090\nIn a standard switch,\nthis happens one ESX machine at a time.\n\n209\n00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.550\nSo that means if you're gonna be\nconfiguring it through vSphere,\n\n210\n00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.860\nthe standard switch, you still have\nto select that particular ESX host,\n\n211\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.780\ngo to the standard switch,\nand configure it.\n\n212\n00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.100\nSame thing again, standard switch and\nconfigure it, okay, on each one.\n\n213\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.380\nBut there is also what is called\na distributed switch as well.\n\n214\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.941\nLet me see if I can get to it here.\n\n215\n00:12:10.941 --> 00:12:13.390\nLet's see, at least I think there is.\n\n216\n00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.730\nGetting Started,\nthat will actually help out.\n\n217\n00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.630\nThere is also what is called\na distributed switch.\n\n218\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:25.141\nA distributed switch says, all right,\nvSphere actually sees multiple ESX hosts.\n\n219\n00:12:25.141 --> 00:12:29.404\nAnd it wants to manage not only each\none that's actually on the individual\n\n220\n00:12:29.404 --> 00:12:30.298\nmachines, but\n\n221\n00:12:30.298 --> 00:12:34.900\nit wants to be able to manage all of\nthe actual networking on each ESX host.\n\n222\n00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.060\nAnd the way that you do that is by\ncreating what you call this distributed\n\n223\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.810\nswitch instead.\n\n224\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.870\nIn the distributed switch the management\nplane becomes centralized\n\n225\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.740\ninside of vSphere, okay.\n\n226\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.570\nBut yet all the other data stuff\nis handled per machine okay?\n\n227\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.370\nSo those are kind of the basics\nthat you want to understand, right.\n\n228\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.588\nSo if you have configuration that needs to\nbe done between four or five different ESX\n\n229\n00:12:57.588 --> 00:13:02.007\nhosts, okay, well you're gonna actually\nprobably do that on a distributed switch.\n\n230\n00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:03.843\nIf you're talking about the traffic and\n\n231\n00:13:03.843 --> 00:13:08.060\nthe aggregation of them that's actually\ndone by the actual individual machine.\n\n232\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.620\nSo in other words, you're gonna\nactually do something like that on\n\n233\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.700\nthe standard switch, which I can't\nremember what to actually say there.\n\n234\n00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.530\nSo those are kinda the two big ones\nthat you actually think about, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.410\nAnother term that you\nwanna be familiar with,\n\n236\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.070\nespecially with the standard switch, is\nthat they talk about the idea of bridging\n\n237\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.550\ntraffic between VMs in\nthe same port group, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.730\nThat's done at the standard\nswitch level as well.\n\n239\n00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.677\nNow, what the heck does that mean?\n\n240\n00:13:33.677 --> 00:13:36.910\nThat means it connects one logical\nport to another logical port.\n\n241\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.390\nJust like we have in a physical switch\nhere, where we actually connect one to\n\n242\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.240\nthe other,\nyou actually will see that as well, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.110\nSo here it is, we have what we call\nour standard switch, in which we would\n\n244\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:52.770\nconfigure on each individual ESX host,\nand then a distributed switch instead.\n\n245\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.070\nNotice it says it actually acts\nas a single virtual switch across\n\n246\n00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.100\nassociated hosts.\n\n247\n00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.000\nThis allows virtual machines to maintain\nconsistent network configurations\n\n248\n00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.460\nacross the actual host that\nthey're actually migrated to.\n\n249\n00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.550\nAnd you have, of course,\nthe ability to actually do more and\n\n250\n00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.650\nmore management on stuff like that.\n\n251\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:15.530\nSo, it actually is kind of a neat\nconcept in the technology that we really\n\n252\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:20.580\nwant to make sure that we pay attention to\nwhen we start taking a look there, okay.\n\n253\n00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.860\nNow the other thing about, of course,\nthe distributed switch here, and\n\n254\n00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.730\nwe can actually take a look at some of the\nthings that we would need to configure.\n\n255\n00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.810\nSo let me go back here\ninstead of jumbling on here.\n\n256\n00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.402\nSo I'm gonna select the standard switch\nagain, and I'm gonna click on Manage.\n\n257\n00:14:34.402 --> 00:14:38.300\nAnd you'll actually see that this is\nwhere you configure the IP address,\n\n258\n00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.330\nis what you would actually do here, okay.\n\n259\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:45.190\nSo you'd actually select that,\nnot the permit, there we go.\n\n260\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.303\nAnd so you can actually\nassociate a network profile,\n\n261\n00:14:48.303 --> 00:14:49.973\nlet me get out of this thing.\n\n262\n00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.399\nI keep expanding out there.\n\n263\n00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:56.403\nBut this is where you would actually\nsee the associated profiles,\n\n264\n00:14:56.403 --> 00:14:58.630\nbe able to also configure those too.\n\n265\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.170\nSo on each individual host that's why\nyou'd actually do something different.\n\n266\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:08.410\nInside of the distributed switch,\nif I now select the Manage here,\n\n267\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.750\nthis is where we can actually go in and\nselect a lot more.\n\n268\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.379\nSo notice that there's a few different\naspects here that you can actually\n\n269\n00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.330\ntake a look at.\n\n270\n00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.839\nSo one of course is something\nlike the Resource Allocation.\n\n271\n00:15:20.839 --> 00:15:22.610\nHere I was about to say allegations.\n\n272\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.360\nThat wasn't actually gonna work here.\n\n273\n00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.360\nWhere you actually create network resource\npools where you can aggregate that\n\n274\n00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.110\ntraffic together, this is of course\nalso where you can go in and\n\n275\n00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.920\nadd in your port IDs for your networks.\n\n276\n00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:41.330\nBe able to also manage network protocols,\nadd in permissions as well as VLAN tags,\n\n277\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.240\nand even create alarm definitions for\npolicies that you might have set in place.\n\n278\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.471\nSo there is a lot of different\nthings essentially this\n\n279\n00:15:50.471 --> 00:15:52.639\nallows you to be able to do.\n\n280\n00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:55.414\nSo that's why we actually use those.\n\n281\n00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:58.784\nIf we're using vSphere,\nwe're gonna use the standard switches or\n\n282\n00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:01.540\nwe're gonna see distributed switches here.\n\n283\n00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.110\nDistributed switches,\nwhen you have more than one ESX host,\n\n284\n00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.770\nstandard switches when you're really only\ndealing with the individual ESX host.\n\n285\n00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.860\n>> That's very cool,\nit also lets you know that this is\n\n286\n00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.820\ngonna be able to let you have either\nvery simplistic environment, right?\n\n287\n00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.160\nWe have the standard switch for that very\npurpose, it's very simple, you don't have\n\n288\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.940\nto worry about is there a configuration\nhere or a configuration there.\n\n289\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.600\nJust turn your virtual machines on,\nthey connect and you're off to the races.\n\n290\n00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.250\nBut if you need a little more horse power,\nyou can go to the distributed switches and\n\n291\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.400\nthey will definitely give you all\nthat you need when it comes to that.\n\n292\n00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.454\nAnd Ronnie are there any concepts when it\ncomes to this virtual switches that we\n\n293\n00:16:35.454 --> 00:16:36.670\nneed to be aware of?\n\n294\n00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.940\n>> We really need to take\na look at the idea here,\n\n295\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.670\nthat it's not just about connecting them,\nright?\n\n296\n00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:46.290\nThe strange thing about networking is\nthat it really does seem that simple.\n\n297\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.709\nIs that you connect the devices and\nthey just stat working and\n\n298\n00:16:48.709 --> 00:16:49.664\nthey start doing that.\n\n299\n00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:53.022\nWell, now when you start\nhaving multiple switches and\n\n300\n00:16:53.022 --> 00:16:55.578\nmultiple network types of connections.\n\n301\n00:16:55.578 --> 00:17:00.230\nYou start realizing that you can do things\nlike over saturate the network, right?\n\n302\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.470\nBy sending too much traffic, so we might\nimplement something like we call the idea\n\n303\n00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.620\nof QOS right, Quality of Service stuff,\n\n304\n00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:11.058\non a regular network to make sure that we\nactually give everybody enough room, okay.\n\n305\n00:17:11.058 --> 00:17:14.149\nWe also want to take a look at\nthe idea of monitoring the traffic,\n\n306\n00:17:14.149 --> 00:17:17.374\nverifying that we can do all these\nthings that we need to do as well.\n\n307\n00:17:17.374 --> 00:17:21.026\nAnd that we're not actually\noversaturating one but\n\n308\n00:17:21.026 --> 00:17:25.850\nalso maybe if a device goes down that\nwe actually know about them too.\n\n309\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.210\nSo, the nice thing is a lot of\ntimes when we do stuff on that,\n\n310\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.450\nwe talk about the idea of\nimplementing policies.\n\n311\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.122\nThe strange thing is in a physical world,\nit is, it's done by device by device,\n\n312\n00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:39.080\nit's how you actually have\nto configure most of that.\n\n313\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.171\nBut inside of vSphere,\nin the virtual networking world,\n\n314\n00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:43.874\nyou instead can set policies and\n\n315\n00:17:43.874 --> 00:17:49.030\nbecause you also have created distributed\nswitches, pushes those policies right out.\n\n316\n00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.250\nLet's take a look at some of\nthe most common networking policies\n\n317\n00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.230\nthat you'll generally find.\n\n318\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:59.070\nSo, when we take a look here then,\nI'm gonna be on the networking tab, and\n\n319\n00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.780\nthen what I wanna do is,\nI wanna select one of these.\n\n320\n00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.410\nSo I'm gonna select this\nManagement Network here, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.790\nAnd this is what they call a part\nof a distributed port group,\n\n322\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.950\nwe're not really getting to port\ngroups too much here, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.430\nBut you can see it say, a portal group\nassociated with a distributed switch that\n\n324\n00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:20.330\nspecified and specify port configuration\noptions for each member of port.\n\n325\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.960\nDistributed port group define\nhow a connection is made through\n\n326\n00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.310\nthe distributed switch.\n\n327\n00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.030\nIn other words, it's just saying here's\nhow's we logically group this together to\n\n328\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.985\nactually implement policy.\n\n329\n00:18:27.985 --> 00:18:32.710\nThat's what it comes down to,\nwhen we start taking a look at that, okay.\n\n330\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:38.171\nIf I click on Manage, and then on Manage\nhere, I'm gonna select Settings and\n\n331\n00:18:38.171 --> 00:18:42.708\nnotice that there is a whole option\ndown here called Policies and\n\n332\n00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:45.380\nlet me click Edit here, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.010\nSo the most common things that we can\nactually set on each distributed one,\n\n334\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.620\nhappens to be some of\nthese common policies.\n\n335\n00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.460\nNow general is a little bit different\nhere, but when we start taking a look at\n\n336\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.870\npolicies, we normally take a look at\nthe idea of security policies, right?\n\n337\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.640\nWe can tell whether or\nnot we actually want this particular\n\n338\n00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.030\ndistributed switch here to\nactually be in promiscuous mode.\n\n339\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.200\nWe can actually change what happens\nwhen somebody actually does\n\n340\n00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.140\nMac address changes.\n\n341\n00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.054\nWe can reject them and\neven forged transmits, okay.\n\n342\n00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:17.609\nSo there's a lot of security here.\n\n343\n00:19:17.609 --> 00:19:21.375\nWhat we were mentioning earlier\nwere things like QOS policies and\n\n344\n00:19:21.375 --> 00:19:23.573\nnotice you absolutely do have these.\n\n345\n00:19:23.573 --> 00:19:27.620\nSo here's one that shapes inbound\ntraffic for traffic shaping as well and\n\n346\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.164\ntraffic shaping is just ensuring that,\nhey,\n\n347\n00:19:30.164 --> 00:19:34.450\neverybody actually is getting\nthe bandwidth that they need.\n\n348\n00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.570\nAnd of course,\nyou can actually do it on both sides,\n\n349\n00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.920\nwhether it's actually inbound or outbound.\n\n350\n00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.530\nTraffic shaping really does ensure and\nguarantee that everybody actually gets\n\n351\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:47.150\nthe traffic that they need and doesn't\ndrop any packets but it allows you that.\n\n352\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:52.130\nAnd of course VLANs,\nyou want the traditional VLAN trunking,\n\n353\n00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.560\nif you're connecting multiple\nvirtual switches together.\n\n354\n00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.540\nVLANs just regular VLANs or Private VLANs\nallowing you that even within a VLAN to\n\n355\n00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.182\nactually create another kind\nof Private VLAN within that.\n\n356\n00:20:04.182 --> 00:20:07.930\nAll right, so there is also of course\npolicies here on Teaming and failure and\n\n357\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.640\nits exactly how it sounds.\n\n358\n00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.490\nThe very fact is we can do load\nbalancing across these NICs and\n\n359\n00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.060\nyou see them right here,\nwhere they show these uplinks.\n\n360\n00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.560\nUplinks really mean how we connect\nto that physical NIC itself and\n\n361\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.140\nyou can see all four\nof these uplinks here.\n\n362\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.136\nAnd so you can see where you can do Load\nbalancing, connection failures, notify,\n\n363\n00:20:25.136 --> 00:20:26.976\nyou name it, there's a ton of these.\n\n364\n00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:31.416\nNow those are by far some of the more\ncommon types of policies that we\n\n365\n00:20:31.416 --> 00:20:36.348\ncan set in networking but I wanted to\nsave this advanced one for last here.\n\n366\n00:20:36.348 --> 00:20:41.090\nBecause you can actually see where you can\noverride what we call port policies as\n\n367\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.330\nwell, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.010\nSo this gives you the ability to do\nall that stuff just by allowing it or\n\n369\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.630\ndisallowing it.\n\n370\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.860\nNow most of us,\n\n371\n00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.240\nif we come from the networking world\nas far as physical networking, all\n\n372\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.480\nthe rest of this stuff you're like, okay,\nbut I think I really don't wanna do that.\n\n373\n00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.830\nWell, you can actually just say whether or\nnot you actually allow it or disable it,\n\n374\n00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.870\nif you actually wanted to instead.\n\n375\n00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.300\nSo this way, you can actually turn it off,\nand that way,\n\n376\n00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.120\nnobody else gets access to it.\n\n377\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.260\nYou name it, there's actually still some\ndifferent of these switch policies that\n\n378\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.380\nyou'll just need to actually understand\nthat are available out right now.\n\n379\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.720\nMost of the time,\nwhen we're talking about it for\n\n380\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.250\nthe exam, you're probably not gonna\nget that much in depth into it, okay?\n\n381\n00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.310\nBut the reason why I saw this is cuz it\nis, it's one of the exam objectives where\n\n382\n00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.440\nit says, you need to be able\nto identify the most common.\n\n383\n00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.790\nSo that security, the fail over\nstuff that we actually showed you,\n\n384\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.890\nthe idea of actually creating those VLANs.\n\n385\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.170\nThose are kinda more common policies\nthat we were taking a look at.\n\n386\n00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.011\nMake sure you actually take\na look at them again cuz, again,\n\n387\n00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:39.756\nI'm not gonna tell you that a lot and\ntraffic shaping, I think is the other one.\n\n388\n00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:44.288\nBut those are kinda the ones that you need\nto make sure that you do understand at\n\n389\n00:21:44.288 --> 00:21:48.626\nleast for the exam, as you continue\nto go on through there as well, okay?\n\n390\n00:21:48.626 --> 00:21:53.007\nSo even though a lot of this doesn't\nreally apply much to as physically\n\n391\n00:21:53.007 --> 00:21:57.849\nplugging in stuff, well, once you\nactually have those NICs up and running.\n\n392\n00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:03.849\nEvery single VM you can essentially\nattach to those types of networks,\n\n393\n00:22:03.849 --> 00:22:06.349\nso let me go back here and now,\n\n394\n00:22:06.349 --> 00:22:11.349\nif I select this Linux machine,\nand then I click on Manage.\n\n395\n00:22:11.349 --> 00:22:15.086\nLet's see if I can actually select\nthis here, and then, there it goes,\n\n396\n00:22:15.086 --> 00:22:18.750\nso you can actually see right here,\nI didn't want to do too much.\n\n397\n00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.650\nYou can see the network adapter's actually\nattached to this, what they call,\n\n398\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:26.470\nVM network and that is actually a virtual\nswitch that they've created that says,\n\n399\n00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.680\nlook here's one of the networks\nthat you can actually attach to.\n\n400\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.530\nSo that way, it actually can do\neverything that we need to without\n\n401\n00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.570\nhaving to actually buy more and\nmore additional switches.\n\n402\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.370\nWe actually can create them\non our own even if we go,\n\n403\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.950\nman I need to actually\nhave another network.\n\n404\n00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.880\nWell, usually I'd go okay Daniel, order me\nanother Cisco switch a 24 port switch and\n\n405\n00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.220\nwe're off and ready to go.\n\n406\n00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.580\nInstead, I can actually create that\nvirtually as a virtual switch,\n\n407\n00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.255\na distributed switch or even a standard\nswitch here, usually a distributed one.\n\n408\n00:22:53.255 --> 00:22:56.903\nAnd then everybody can connect to that and\nwe are off and ready to go as well.\n\n409\n00:22:56.903 --> 00:23:01.327\nSo it really does help to understand some\nof these basic technologies that you'll\n\n410\n00:23:01.327 --> 00:23:03.649\nsee in terms of virtual networking, too.\n\n411\n00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:07.093\nNow, we do have to talk\nabout one more thing,\n\n412\n00:23:07.093 --> 00:23:12.220\nwhich is of course,\nas there was a storage I/O control, right.\n\n413\n00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.390\nSo, I won't massacre that acronym\nagain [LAUGHS] a stored Java control,\n\n414\n00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.160\nthere's also a network\nI/O control as well.\n\n415\n00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.520\nNow, the network I/O control\nis about ensuring that\n\n416\n00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.520\none particular data flow doesn't\nget to saturate the whole network.\n\n417\n00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.370\nThat's what it comes down to, okay?\n\n418\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.440\nJust like we talked about in terms\nof storage where one devices says,\n\n419\n00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.030\nI need all the I/O that I need, everybody\nelse can just wait until I'm done.\n\n420\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.050\nWell, the same thing in terms\nof networking can go on, too.\n\n421\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:44.101\nSo instead, network I/O control ensures\nthat a given single data flow is not gonna\n\n422\n00:23:44.101 --> 00:23:49.311\ndominate every other traffic flow that's\nactually there So what is it really doing?\n\n423\n00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:52.542\nIt's preventing, of course,\nnetwork drops from happening.\n\n424\n00:23:52.542 --> 00:23:56.511\nIt's also preventing what we call jitter,\nthat uneven flow of the data and\n\n425\n00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:00.420\nthen we getting some things and\nwe're not getting other things too.\n\n426\n00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:05.700\nThe way it actually works here\nas far as Network I/O control\n\n427\n00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:10.080\nis it uses what we call quality\nof service to ensure and\n\n428\n00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.650\nto enforce things that we want to,\nsuch as the idea of traffic isolation.\n\n429\n00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.950\nIf we need one particular traffic\nto go one way, and we say look,\n\n430\n00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.350\nthat traffic's only gonna go here,\n\n431\n00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:24.130\nbut not onto the common network,\nwe'll do something like that.\n\n432\n00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.810\nAnd you might be like,\nwhy the heck would I use that?\n\n433\n00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.010\nWell that's what VMotion's about.\n\n434\n00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.030\nThe very fact is we want VMotion,\nwe want the fault tolerance.\n\n435\n00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.620\nWe want the fault tolerance logging,\nwe want all that to actually be on its\n\n436\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.520\nown separate network, we don't want it\nflooding over our production network.\n\n437\n00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.140\nSo the ability to actually do\nthe isolations like that as well.\n\n438\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.260\nAlso, it actually lends to predictability.\n\n439\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.310\nIf you can actually use network IO control\nto do so, you can now predict when\n\n440\n00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.500\nyou're actually gonna face very heavy\ntraffic versus when you're not, okay.\n\n441\n00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.260\nAnd that way you actually know\nwhere traffic's going and\n\n442\n00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.640\nyou can actually start configuring\nyour network for that.\n\n443\n00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.410\nAnd then of course,\noverall prioritization.\n\n444\n00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.530\nBecause you can now\nactually take a look and\n\n445\n00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.900\nmonitor that stuff, predictability and\nprioritization gives you that ability\n\n446\n00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.700\nby using that QOS again to ensure that\neverybody gets what they need to, okay?\n\n447\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.650\nSo it really can be incredibly\nhelpful when you start doing this.\n\n448\n00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.070\nSo where in the world do we turn\nsomething like that on if we need it?\n\n449\n00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:27.100\nLet me go back to this networking icon and\nfrom there, let me see here, I am\n\n450\n00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.280\ngoing to then select on the site itself,\nmake sure I actually tell you right.\n\n451\n00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.830\nAnd then inside of Manage and\nSettings, I'm gonna click on Edit.\n\n452\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:41.810\nAnd this is one of the things that\nreally kind of is neat to me, right?\n\n453\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.310\nSo all you can do here is pretty\nmuch enable it and disable it.\n\n454\n00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.480\nWell what about all of that other\nstuff that we were talking about?\n\n455\n00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.710\nYou know that you control through this,\nwell all that's done through the policies.\n\n456\n00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.760\nSo it all fits together so\nthat you can actually change it up and\n\n457\n00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.710\ndo what you need to through the policies.\n\n458\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.660\nBut what actually implements it\nis this network I/O control,\n\n459\n00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.970\nsimply by saying enable or disable you\ncan actually use it the way you want to.\n\n460\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:11.400\nMore than likely, network I/O control is\nprobably something you're gonna enable,\n\n461\n00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.730\neven if you don't actually, I don't know\nif it's actually enabled by default.\n\n462\n00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.710\nMaybe.\n\n463\n00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.920\nBut it's something that you're\nprobably gonna want to enable,\n\n464\n00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.370\nespecially if you run multiple\nVMs at the same time and\n\n465\n00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.540\nthey're all production servers,\nyou'll probably wanna implement it.\n\n466\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.310\n>> All right, Ronnie,\nwell obviously our VMware systems here\n\n467\n00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:31.110\nare quite robust when it comes to\ntheir networking capabilities.\n\n468\n00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.250\nAnd if you have a foundational\nknowledge of networking,\n\n469\n00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:36.230\nyou've ever worked with switches,\nyou've ever worked with just the basic\n\n470\n00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:40.140\nconnectivity, then you're probably not\ngonna be too far out in the weeds on this.\n\n471\n00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.800\nSo all you gotta really do is\nfigure out how vSphere does it.\n\n472\n00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.170\nHow does vSphere connect machines?\n\n473\n00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.270\nHow does VSphere do quality of service?\n\n474\n00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.600\nWell, Ronnie has walked you\nthrough just about every bell and\n\n475\n00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.350\nwhistle in that system to\nshow you how to do that.\n\n476\n00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.405\nAnd if you want to, you definitely\nshould jump over to VM Ware's website,\n\n477\n00:26:56.405 --> 00:26:59.751\nget that trial account, play around with\nthese technologies because the more you\n\n478\n00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:02.903\nhave some hands on with it, the more\nyou're going to retain that knowledge,\n\n479\n00:27:02.903 --> 00:27:06.060\nyou're going to understand what's\nhappening underneath the hood.\n\n480\n00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.150\nRonnie, thank you so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n481\n00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.882\n>> Welcome.\n>> And explaining these networking\n\n482\n00:27:09.882 --> 00:27:12.240\nconcepts using the VMware systems vSphere.\n\n483\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.700\nAnd looks like we've wrapped up yet\nanother show, and we thank you guys for\n\n484\n00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.390\njoining us today.\n\n485\n00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.420\nHopefully you've enjoyed this episode.\n\n486\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.160\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n487\n00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.560\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n488\n00:27:21.560 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.712 --> 00:00:19.150\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.800\nwell, we're continuing\non with our VCA6 series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.610\nJoining us back in the studio to\nhelp us out with that endeavour is\n\n6\n00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.650\nour good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.530\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.310\n>> It's going great,\n\n9\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.000\nit's another great day to be right here\nas we continue to take a look at VCA6.\n\n10\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920\nThat is the VM ware certified\nassociate in version 6 and what\n\n11\n00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.220\nwe're gonna be taking a look at today of\ncourse is the idea of resource management.\n\n12\n00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.360\nOne of the challenges, of course in just\na regular standard physical data center\n\n13\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.630\nis essentially resource management, right?\n\n14\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.690\nIf you think about it just in\nterms of just basic servers, okay?\n\n15\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.620\nYou buy a server and let's say that you\nactually have it on that three year life\n\n16\n00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.390\ncycle and\nmay even extend out to five years.\n\n17\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.390\nWell, those particular servers\nare still operating today, but\n\n18\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.900\nthe technology in them is about three,\nfour, five years old.\n\n19\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.300\nAnd now your newer servers,\n\n20\n00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.160\nif you think about it,\nmight actually have the capacity and\n\n21\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.940\nthe performance level, to really replace\nthose earliest servers, even all of them.\n\n22\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.780\nAnd actually how much more horsepower\nthat you have in your CPU, how much more\n\n23\n00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.020\nRAM that you have, how much more storage\nspace, you might actually be doing that.\n\n24\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.440\nAnd so what ends up happening then of\ncourse is that you get an unusual idea of\n\n25\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.430\nresource management where you're still\nactually sending stuff to these older\n\n26\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.800\nservers and you're still getting\nsome latency and some time.\n\n27\n00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.470\nAnd then on the newer ones,\nthey're actually being used but\n\n28\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.490\nthey're not used as\noptimized as they need to.\n\n29\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.790\nSo, one of things that they do inside of\nVMware and vSphere one solution that they\n\n30\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.410\noffer of course is this ability do what we\ncall a dynamic resource management, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.330\nAnd that idea's actually fairly simple,\n\n32\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.010\nthat means to be able to do it on the fly,\nautomatically\n\n33\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.110\nmaking sure that this actually is\ndone seamlessly in the background.\n\n34\n00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.260\nInstead of you and\nI having to come together for\n\n35\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.700\na meeting and realizing,\nhey those servers, those older servers, or\n\n36\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.020\nthat older Sam that's\nactually still there.\n\n37\n00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.690\nIs really where our\nbottlenecks coming from, and\n\n38\n00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.970\nright now we just don't\nknow what to do with them.\n\n39\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.220\nWhen you actually implement\nthe entirety of bringing up\n\n40\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.700\nthat data center virtualization,\nimplementing technologies like vSphere and\n\n41\n00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.450\nthe vCenter in the background and\nthen a whole host of other technologies.\n\n42\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.520\nAnd you virtualize the entire data center,\nwell this gives you the ability to\n\n43\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.180\nactually move those resources around,\nmanage them in the way that you need to,\n\n44\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.220\nand also allow for\nvSphere to do it automatically.\n\n45\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.770\nAnd that means that when\ndemand actually increases,\n\n46\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.220\nwe can actually put more resources there.\n\n47\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.360\nWhen we don't need as much,\nwe can actually move and\n\n48\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.810\nconsolidate resources as we need to.\n\n49\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.720\nSo being able to do something\nlike that's actually key.\n\n50\n00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.420\nSo what are some of those technologies\nthat we end up talking about\n\n51\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.300\nthat we might actually want to run?\n\n52\n00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.460\nWell one of the things\nthat we might actually end\n\n53\n00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.590\nup talking about here\nis the idea of the DRS.\n\n54\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.530\nOkay so make sure you understand that\nacronym, Dynamic Resource Scheduler.\n\n55\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.140\nThis is kind of the management that\nactually allows us to be able to schedule\n\n56\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.990\nthose resources on that demand\nthat we're talking about.\n\n57\n00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.840\nEither we schedule them the way that\nwe as administrators want to, or\n\n58\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.780\nwe can actually set some triggering level\nto do something like this to help us out.\n\n59\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.030\nSo that really does help us out as far as\nthe way that we might need to manage that.\n\n60\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.190\nBut along with that to help us with\nthe dynamic management part of course\n\n61\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.410\nare things like we talked about\nin terms of energy, right?\n\n62\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.320\nThe idea of power consumption, some of\nthe different things that we can do.\n\n63\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.010\nSo we might also implement of course,\nthe idea of DPF.\n\n64\n00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.220\nNow remember that I don't normally\ntalk like this all the time, but\n\n65\n00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.500\nthis is technology that we\njust have to be familiar with,\n\n66\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.130\nespecially if we're getting ready for\nan exam in the future.\n\n67\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.400\nJust understand that these acronyms\nthat are being used they do stand for\n\n68\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.140\nsomething, right?\n\n69\n00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.060\nSo DPM is the, make sure that I say this\nright, Distributed Power Management tube.\n\n70\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.470\nAnd distributed power management of course\nactually gives us a little bit more.\n\n71\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.580\nAnd we're gonna talk about that a little\nbit more in this episode as we go on.\n\n72\n00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.680\nAnd also there's the Vmotion types of\nutilities that we have the ability to do.\n\n73\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.260\nSo if we need our production network\nto maintain its availability, right?\n\n74\n00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.480\nAnd we still need to be able to move\nresources off of servers because\n\n75\n00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.940\nthe resources are actually low there or\nthe power is actually dropping.\n\n76\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.100\nWe need to move them off.\n\n77\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.950\nWe need the technology in\nthe background to help us out.\n\n78\n00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.770\nAnd tha's where V motion comes in as\nwell as the storage IO control and\n\n79\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.050\nnetwork IO control too.\n\n80\n00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.110\nNow if you're saying Ronnie I kind\nof skipped a few episodes here.\n\n81\n00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.990\nAnd man you just mentioned a lot of terms.\n\n82\n00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.540\nThat's where you actually get\nthis change now to go back and\n\n83\n00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.520\nwatch some of those episodes\nthat we talked about.\n\n84\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.410\nIn terms of the storage solutions and\n\n85\n00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.410\nof course the network solutions that\nwe have available and of course\n\n86\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.718\nthe availability solutions that we have\navailable, as well, inside of vSphere.\n\n87\n00:04:55.718 --> 00:04:58.420\nSo just kinda make sure you go back and\nyou review some of those concepts.\n\n88\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.430\nWe'll hit them again at some point in\ntime but just go back and take a look at\n\n89\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.700\nthose and understand that this is kind of\nwhat we actually need to have in places.\n\n90\n00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.730\nKind of the virtual infrastructure for\nresource management to take place.\n\n91\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.436\n>> That's right, now VM ware Ronnie,\n\n92\n00:05:13.436 --> 00:05:18.500\nthey also have a cool little bit of\nfunctionality inside of vSphere,\n\n93\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.420\nI think it's vSphere to help\naddress management of resources.\n\n94\n00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.080\nThey see the problem, and they said okay\nhere's what we're gonna help you out.\n\n95\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.600\n>> Yeah,\nthe problem happens to be too full right.\n\n96\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.090\nJust when we've talked about another.\n\n97\n00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.230\nIt's the very fact that we're physical\nmanaging a data center, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.150\nWe do tend to have actually learn\nabout those different technology.\n\n99\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.920\nSand technology like fiber channels,\nsometimes we're implementing those.\n\n100\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.250\nFiber channel or ethernet or\nice just in the storage side.\n\n101\n00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.500\nBut also of course those servers and\nhow they connect to them.\n\n102\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.780\nAnd of course, then you have networking\nstuff that you actually have to realize\n\n103\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.070\nand manage as well.\n\n104\n00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.370\nAnd where in that's a lot\nof diverse technology.\n\n105\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.160\nI'm not saying that you\nshouldn't know those.\n\n106\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.240\nThose would be great for\nyou to actually learn.\n\n107\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.640\nBut the thing about the way\nthat vSphere ends up working,\n\n108\n00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.340\nright, is that I say, look.\n\n109\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.290\nWhen we virtualize this data center,\nthe last thing we really want an admin\n\n110\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.565\nto have to do is to sit down and go, okay\nnow that we've got everything virtualized,\n\n111\n00:06:16.565 --> 00:06:19.060\nyeah, now we still have to\nmaintain the storage technology.\n\n112\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.910\nWe still have to do all that stuff.\n\n113\n00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.450\nUsually the idea here, of course,\n\n114\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.880\nis being able to manage and monitor all\nof those resources that are available.\n\n115\n00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.520\nBut through a centralized\nmanagement system and\n\n116\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.247\nthrough a very effective\ncentralized management system.\n\n117\n00:06:32.247 --> 00:06:38.350\nNow vSphere is the heart of us getting\ntogether the basics of clustering and\n\n118\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.440\nmaking sure that those resources can\nsee each other and can work together.\n\n119\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.420\nBut if you're not talking about\nthe ability to manage resources and now in\n\n120\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.880\na virtual data center since it doesn't\nmatter where the resources are Daniel.\n\n121\n00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.110\nWhether it's actually out in a public\ncloud somewhere as a infrastructure as\n\n122\n00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.620\na service or\nwhether they're in my private cloud here\n\n123\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.560\nas well it shouldn't matter\nwhere those locations are.\n\n124\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:07.660\nAnd also of course then as my data\ncenter continues to scale out or\n\n125\n00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.740\nscale up, it shouldn't matter either,\nas well, and the way that they do that\n\n126\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.730\nis vSphere has a component and that of\ncourse is a separate component, but\n\n127\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.590\nthey also consider it part of the vSphere\nsolution that they call vRealize.\n\n128\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.850\nAnd there's a whole suite of\nsolutions that are actually there for\n\n129\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.270\nus to be able to take a look at and\n\n130\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.180\nwe're gonna see that in another\nepisode in the near future here.\n\n131\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.564\nActually say, wow, when we talk about the\nability to manage everything that we need,\n\n132\n00:07:36.564 --> 00:07:40.168\nthat also means the ability to monitor,\nmeans the ability to control,\n\n133\n00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:41.870\nmeans the ability to configure.\n\n134\n00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.044\nAnd inside of vSphere,\nwhat we call the automation and\n\n135\n00:07:45.044 --> 00:07:47.114\noperations as well as the insight,\n\n136\n00:07:47.114 --> 00:07:51.530\nall of that is wrapped together inside\nof what they call the vRealize Suite,\n\n137\n00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.205\nwhich we'll take a look at like\nI said in a future episode here.\n\n138\n00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:58.295\nThat it really gives you\nthat ability to do so\n\n139\n00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:01.814\nThe amazing thing is through one console,\nokay.\n\n140\n00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.935\nSo you're not having to go,\nokay, Daniel, so\n\n141\n00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:07.609\nlet's switch on over to that particular\nscreen over there and figure that one out.\n\n142\n00:08:07.609 --> 00:08:12.323\nOn this one, you have to manually command\nline it and figure out that and then yeah,\n\n143\n00:08:12.323 --> 00:08:15.548\nhere's a new system and\nyou just got to read the book on it.\n\n144\n00:08:15.548 --> 00:08:18.669\nCuz there's nothing really that we can\ndo besides actually get the PDF and\n\n145\n00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:21.350\nstart reading about it,\nand figuring it out here.\n\n146\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.858\nWe realize says look, once we virtualize\neverything, the way we need to,\n\n147\n00:08:25.858 --> 00:08:28.949\nwe can use the V realize suite and\nit is incredible.\n\n148\n00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:33.168\nAbout the detail that you can actually do,\nand you can manage here,\n\n149\n00:08:33.168 --> 00:08:37.757\nthat will help you out in being able\nto manage all the resources across your\n\n150\n00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:40.144\nentire software define data center.\n\n151\n00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:44.985\nAnd that's really the goal and\nidea of data center virtualization,\n\n152\n00:08:44.985 --> 00:08:48.500\nis that SDDC, so that we can do that.\n\n153\n00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.540\nSo there's a bunch of amazing technology\nthat sets you right there for\n\n154\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.580\nthe management.\n\n155\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.850\nAs well as just understanding,\n\n156\n00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.890\nin the background, all these\ntechnologies do need to be there.\n\n157\n00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.600\nAnd once they're in place,\n\n158\n00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.670\nthey really are gonna help us to manage\nour resources much more effectively.\n\n159\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.380\n>> That's right,\n\n160\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.250\nyou gotta be aware that [COUGH] a lot of\ntimes when we're allocating resources.\n\n161\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.680\nI've got maybe three ESXi servers,\nI've got vSphere running and\n\n162\n00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.000\nmaybe one of my ESXi servers,\nit's lagging along.\n\n163\n00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.420\nIt's limping, it's not doing so hot.\n\n164\n00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.700\nMaybe I add another server,\nsomething to that effect.\n\n165\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.169\nMaybe, you know what,\n\n166\n00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:26.292\nI just wanna equal out what's going\non with each one of my servers.\n\n167\n00:09:26.292 --> 00:09:29.713\nI wanna have the same amount of\nvirtual machines on each one,\n\n168\n00:09:29.713 --> 00:09:31.401\njust try to make things even.\n\n169\n00:09:31.401 --> 00:09:35.519\nAnd sometimes that's gonna involve\nus actually moving VMs around,\n\n170\n00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:40.357\nwe've got to shuffle around, we've got\nto do the Three card monte with our VMs.\n\n171\n00:09:40.357 --> 00:09:43.655\nRonnie VMware, vSphere,\nthey've done a great job here as well.\n\n172\n00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:47.227\nThis is probably my favorite\nportion of the VMware,\n\n173\n00:09:47.227 --> 00:09:51.378\nsweet of software and\nthis is vMotion we're talking about.\n\n174\n00:09:51.378 --> 00:09:56.648\n>> vMotion to me just like you, it is\nthe kind of neediest thing that it does,\n\n175\n00:09:56.648 --> 00:10:02.800\nbecause if you work with virtualization\njust even on your own desktop machine.\n\n176\n00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.010\nYou kinda realize,\nespecially if you do it on a laptop,\n\n177\n00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.860\nif you're like me,\nyou don't pay attention and\n\n178\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.090\nall of the sudden you're in the middle\nof working, the battery dies.\n\n179\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.100\nAnd sometimes it does give you a warning,\n\n180\n00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.750\nsometimes if you're like me you're\nnot paying attention, it doesn't.\n\n181\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.600\nYou're in the middle of work and\nit just dies and it's gone.\n\n182\n00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.550\nSo now,\nyou have to plug everything back up and\n\n183\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.303\nbring everything back into existence\nin the way that you want to.\n\n184\n00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:25.201\nAnd of course, at the same time,\nyou're having to remember what you did and\n\n185\n00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:26.029\nwhat you didn't do.\n\n186\n00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:28.420\nDid you save it, did it not?\n\n187\n00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.860\nWell, the good thing is,\nmost of that hosted technology today,\n\n188\n00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.900\nreally does go ahead and do a save state\nfor you, even before it shuts down.\n\n189\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.610\nBut in the early days, it was just\nlike you turned off the machine by\n\n190\n00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.100\nholding the power button down and\nit was just gone, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.410\nWell, the thing about the same thing when\nyou actually think about it in a data\n\n192\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.830\ncenter level, you don't want\nanything like that to happen.\n\n193\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.270\nSo what are the concerns that\nwe have at a data center level,\n\n194\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.160\nespecially if we have, well,\nour VMs running production servers.\n\n195\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.302\nWell, it's the idea of course,\nof failure at the hardware level and\n\n196\n00:10:57.302 --> 00:10:58.880\nthe ESX host goes down, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.390\nWell, how do we actually use\n\n198\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.370\nsomething inside of the VMware\nto help us to manage that.\n\n199\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.587\nAlso, what if the operating system\nin the VM itself also goes down?\n\n200\n00:11:08.587 --> 00:11:12.463\nSo how do we actually manage\nstuff like that as well and then,\n\n201\n00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:16.795\nwhat if the only place that I can move\nit like what Daniel was saying to\n\n202\n00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:19.608\nredistribute the load or can actually say.\n\n203\n00:11:19.608 --> 00:11:22.413\nI need to move it off of this failing\ndevice over to the other one but\n\n204\n00:11:22.413 --> 00:11:25.220\nthe other one is actually\nin a different location.\n\n205\n00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.290\nBut there's a lot of technology\nthat's working in the background\n\n206\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.210\nthat's actually designed inside of\nthat vSphere suite to help us out.\n\n207\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.190\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat what we're talking about here,\n\n208\n00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.020\nI did some diagrams.\n\n209\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.590\nAnd if you've watched\nthe earlier episodes on this,\n\n210\n00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.960\nyou'll see that they're fairly similar and\n\n211\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.000\nwe're gonna kind of\nreview this very quickly.\n\n212\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.050\nBut we do wanna hit some of\nthe high points inside of vMotion,\n\n213\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.140\nwe only really talked about\nthe idea of vMotion and\n\n214\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.770\nits technicality of what\nit really does here, right.\n\n215\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:55.190\nSo what vMotion allows us to do, is to\nmigrate a VM from one host to another.\n\n216\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.025\nNow we've done this pretty\nmuch whenever we wanted to,\n\n217\n00:11:59.025 --> 00:12:03.364\nwe copied it from one server and\nthen we paste it to another one.\n\n218\n00:12:03.364 --> 00:12:06.980\nBut normally,\nwhen we do this we shut it down, okay.\n\n219\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.316\nWe shut it down, we copy the file\nthat actually represents the machine,\n\n220\n00:12:10.316 --> 00:12:12.292\nwe copy the disc that represents the file.\n\n221\n00:12:12.292 --> 00:12:14.505\nThen, once we actually\nshut that thing down,\n\n222\n00:12:14.505 --> 00:12:16.621\nwe go over to the other\nmachine that we want.\n\n223\n00:12:16.621 --> 00:12:19.962\nAnd then we simply go ahead and\nwe paste that in to a directory,\n\n224\n00:12:19.962 --> 00:12:22.482\nverify that everything\nactually paste over.\n\n225\n00:12:22.482 --> 00:12:26.084\nTurn the machine on and\nif there is no complains about it,\n\n226\n00:12:26.084 --> 00:12:29.022\nyou now have an operating VM up and\nready to go.\n\n227\n00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:32.307\nBut that time period can actually\ntake a quite a bit of time\n\n228\n00:12:32.307 --> 00:12:36.200\ndepending on the technology\nthat's in the background.\n\n229\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.240\nWell, vMotion says look,\nlet's get this and\n\n230\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.940\nmake it as much as possible something you\ndon't really have to shut down, okay.\n\n231\n00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.880\nAnd it actually does it in\nsuch a quick instance here,\n\n232\n00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.320\nthat it really looks like it\nhappens almost instantaneously.\n\n233\n00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.172\nSo the basics of vMotion here,\ndoes it still do a shut down?\n\n234\n00:12:56.172 --> 00:12:58.946\nWell, technically, it does a suspend, but\n\n235\n00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:03.329\nwhat it does is while the actually\nfile still exists on that data store.\n\n236\n00:13:03.329 --> 00:13:09.065\nIt goes ahead and\nit suspends the VM1 right here,\n\n237\n00:13:09.065 --> 00:13:16.320\nand then it only actually moves\nthat particular one over here.\n\n238\n00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.610\nSo when it does something like that and\nactually resumes that right away, well,\n\n239\n00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.740\nthis can actually happen\nalmost instantaneously.\n\n240\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.010\nWhen we do that, because we're\nnot having moved a gigantic file,\n\n241\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.370\nit is just to simply as actually copying\nover what we call, what's in RAM.\n\n242\n00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.270\nAnd the system state data copies it over,\nwe're up and ready to go and\n\n243\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.950\nit is actually running.\n\n244\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.730\nSo vMotion allows us to do that very,\nvery quickly\n\n245\n00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.900\nas of nothing else is actually happening\nas far as the suspend anything.\n\n246\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.790\nWe normally,\ndon't even realize this is going down.\n\n247\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.190\n>> Our end users are completely oblivious\nto the fact that something has occurred,\n\n248\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.110\nthey're just like, well, there's my\noperating system, it's working fine.\n\n249\n00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.210\nThere's my server it's working fine.\n\n250\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.499\nWhen really vMotion is doing this It's\nturning like a mad man to be honest\n\n251\n00:14:00.499 --> 00:14:01.144\nwith you.\n\n252\n00:14:01.144 --> 00:14:02.599\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's when,\n\n253\n00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:06.729\nyou're really taking advantage of higher\nspeed network it's the higher speed you\n\n254\n00:14:06.729 --> 00:14:10.387\ncan have, the more seamless this is going\nto look to the person at the end of\n\n255\n00:14:10.387 --> 00:14:12.766\na monitor trying to use\nthis virtual machines.\n\n256\n00:14:12.766 --> 00:14:17.293\nSo, if you do have a slow network,\nyou may see some jitter, some.\n\n257\n00:14:17.293 --> 00:14:19.789\n>> [LAUGHS] A little bit.\n\n258\n00:14:19.789 --> 00:14:22.113\n>> Yeah, a little bit of lag,\nbut if you've gone through and\n\n259\n00:14:22.113 --> 00:14:25.436\nthis is your first foray, you're probably\npurchasing everything you need to make\n\n260\n00:14:25.436 --> 00:14:27.260\nthis work as seamlessly as possible.\n\n261\n00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:32.230\nAnd if you've got the speed,\nVMware will do this very, very quickly.\n\n262\n00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.890\n>> Now, why does it do it so quickly?\n\n263\n00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.790\nThat's the key here.\n\n264\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.549\nWell, let's show you actually all of\nthe components that are involved now.\n\n265\n00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:40.173\nSo I've expanded out just a tad bit.\n\n266\n00:14:40.173 --> 00:14:41.230\n>> We've removed the veil.\n\n267\n00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.910\n>> [LAUGH] We've kind of removed the veil\njust a little bit more here, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.500\nSo in the background,\nwhen we actually start doing this and\n\n269\n00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.990\nwe start going across these different ones\nto actually be able to use vMotion, right?\n\n270\n00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.192\nWell, we normally have to go\nacross that virtual switch network\n\n271\n00:14:56.192 --> 00:14:57.153\nto help us to do so.\n\n272\n00:14:57.153 --> 00:15:00.890\nAnd when we do that there's actually a\ntechnology in the background that we call\n\n273\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.023\nCross Switch vMotion.\n\n274\n00:15:02.023 --> 00:15:06.510\nAnd we're moving it across a virtual\nswitch, that's what's going on.\n\n275\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.950\nEven though technically you and\nI experience what we call vMotion.\n\n276\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.190\nWe don't actually do anything else but\n\n277\n00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.350\nwe actually know that that's\nthe technology that's going on.\n\n278\n00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.540\nAnd I tried to kind of gray out these\nswitches here in the background, show you\n\n279\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.760\nsome virtual wires here, some virtual\ncables connecting these devices together.\n\n280\n00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.140\nWell, we can do that.\n\n281\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.800\nNow as we actually move that,\nlet me see if i can,\n\n282\n00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.420\nI have to move this one outta the way or\n\n283\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.058\nwe'll see if it actually lets me send it\nbackward there and if I grab that, I can.\n\n284\n00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:37.386\nLet's say that I move this all the way\nover here to, let me just do this one for\n\n285\n00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:40.414\nright now cuz this actually makes\nsense and then I'll move one more.\n\n286\n00:15:40.414 --> 00:15:46.823\nWell, maybe not, let me try that again,\n[SOUND] the idea of me.\n\n287\n00:15:46.823 --> 00:15:50.292\nLet me do that, now I can do this, okay.\n\n288\n00:15:50.292 --> 00:15:53.874\nSo here it is, we moved it and\nwe just don't notice it.\n\n289\n00:15:53.874 --> 00:15:58.086\nSo that works and you and I have seen\nthat before So that's not the big deal.\n\n290\n00:15:58.086 --> 00:16:03.059\nBut what if I actually end up\nmoving this to even another one\n\n291\n00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:08.460\nthat's actually located with\na different data store as well?\n\n292\n00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.150\nWill it still work?\n\n293\n00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.219\nYes, okay.\n\n294\n00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:14.247\nSo, even though the original file is\nstill here, we can actually move that and\n\n295\n00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:17.848\nhave instantaneous movement just\nabout where we don't realize it and\n\n296\n00:16:17.848 --> 00:16:19.817\nwe can do something like that as well.\n\n297\n00:16:19.817 --> 00:16:25.771\nBut, the other thing that we can also do\nif we choose to, is also migrate that\n\n298\n00:16:25.771 --> 00:16:31.590\nparticular storage from one data\ncenter over to the other one as well.\n\n299\n00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:32.370\nAnd we do that,\n\n300\n00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.104\nthat's actually a technology that we\ncall well storage vMotion as well.\n\n301\n00:16:36.104 --> 00:16:40.761\nSo I wanna migrate the virtual machine\nacross the entire network, well,\n\n302\n00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:45.358\nin the background was sets you running\nis what one cross switch vMotion.\n\n303\n00:16:45.358 --> 00:16:49.822\nAnd then also, I wanna migrate the actual\nstorage for the one that represents\n\n304\n00:16:49.822 --> 00:16:54.600\nthe hard drive across data stores, that's\ngonna be called storage vMotion too.\n\n305\n00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.190\nNow the other ones is actually\nthe one that I have these kind of\n\n306\n00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.890\nboxes to draw here, which is about\nmanagement domains more then anything.\n\n307\n00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:06.180\nLet's say that over here on\nthe left hand side, ESX1 and\n\n308\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.845\n2 actually are managed\nunder one vSphere server,\n\n309\n00:17:10.845 --> 00:17:13.389\nexcuse me vCenter,\nI'm not gonna be able to say that right.\n\n310\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:20.072\nAnd over here and ESXi3 that's\nmanaged under another vCenter.\n\n311\n00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:24.541\nWell, if I'm actually moving it\nin this way where is actually two\n\n312\n00:17:24.541 --> 00:17:28.944\ndifferent vCenter servers\nmanaging that particular cluster.\n\n313\n00:17:28.944 --> 00:17:32.580\nWell, what's actually happening\nin the background is what we call\n\n314\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.590\nCross vCenter vMotion.\n\n315\n00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.410\nSo all of this is technology that works\nseamlessly in the background while you and\n\n316\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.260\nI, we just call it vMotion.\n\n317\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:45.800\nOkay, so it's kind of neat that you and\nI just call it vMotion and we go we know,\n\n318\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.970\nit works this way but here's the basic\nbreakdown of the technology.\n\n319\n00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.010\nYou gotta know that Cross\nvCenter vMotion is there,\n\n320\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.250\nCross Switch vMotion as well\nas the Storage vMotion.\n\n321\n00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:01.720\nAll that actually makes up kind of the\nconglomeration of the vMotion technology,\n\n322\n00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.260\nthat brings everything\ntogether to help us.\n\n323\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.080\nAnd if you think about that in terms\nof resource management, right?\n\n324\n00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.690\nWe can bring these servers down or\nactually move them for any reason that we\n\n325\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:15.320\nwant to, and it happens to be because of\nresource utilization, perfectly fine.\n\n326\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.210\nThe good thing is, what?\n\n327\n00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.350\nThe technology helps us do it,\nis actually right there for\n\n328\n00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.300\nus and we do actually need\nto implement it, turn it on.\n\n329\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.140\nWe configure a little bit of it but\n\n330\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.110\njust kinda realize that's kind of\nthe technology that you're talking about.\n\n331\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.940\nSo, make sure you understand those\nparticular scenarios, right?\n\n332\n00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:36.025\nSo from one machine over to the other one,\nit's just basic vMotion and\n\n333\n00:18:36.025 --> 00:18:38.741\nwe're now also moving\nthe data store itself.\n\n334\n00:18:38.741 --> 00:18:45.131\nIt also involves the core storage vMotion,\nand we're actually now also moving it,\n\n335\n00:18:45.131 --> 00:18:49.903\nagain, even from one,\nactually from one host to another one.\n\n336\n00:18:49.903 --> 00:18:53.428\nIt's gone across that vertical switch,\nremember this idea as well,\n\n337\n00:18:53.428 --> 00:18:56.250\nthese switch vMotion\nthat's also right there.\n\n338\n00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.023\nSo, it can get a little bit confusing, but\n\n339\n00:18:58.023 --> 00:19:00.142\nI'm hoping this diagram\nhelps out a little bit, so\n\n340\n00:19:00.142 --> 00:19:03.267\nthat you can actually kind of understand\nwhats going on in the background.\n\n341\n00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:06.140\nYou and I, we'll call it vMotion, and\nwe'll probably be fine with it [LAUGH].\n\n342\n00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.102\n>> And hopefully,\nwe don,t get vMotion sickness.\n\n343\n00:19:08.102 --> 00:19:09.362\n>> Yeah, vMotion sickness.\n\n344\n00:19:09.362 --> 00:19:12.815\n>> We're moving things around, I'm not\nfeeling good, I really don't wanna move\n\n345\n00:19:12.815 --> 00:19:16.055\nthat VM over there but sometimes that's\njust the way the cookie crumbles.\n\n346\n00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:16.854\n[LAUGH]\n>> And just like\n\n347\n00:19:16.854 --> 00:19:18.476\nyou think about here, right?\n\n348\n00:19:18.476 --> 00:19:21.717\nYou and I, we might make decisions to\nmove those just because we're like,\n\n349\n00:19:21.717 --> 00:19:23.750\nI just wanna test and see if it works.\n\n350\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.670\nBut in the background with that\ndistributed resource scheduler and\n\n351\n00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.590\neverything else that goes on,\nit can happen very easily for\n\n352\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.120\nthose virtual machines.\n\n353\n00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.060\nSo they can get the performance that they\nneed or if we need to consolidate power\n\n354\n00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.340\nand save power, in those at a low\npower state at times, right?\n\n355\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.910\nThat is like, let's just move that\nVM over to this one over here, and\n\n356\n00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.760\nwe can actually even shut that\none ESX host server down, so\n\n357\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.995\nwe could save a little bit of energy for\nthis period of time.\n\n358\n00:19:51.995 --> 00:19:56.500\nSo it's amazing when all the technology is\nso well integrated that they thought about\n\n359\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.832\nhow all this stuff fits together,\nthat's what makes it neat.\n\n360\n00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:02.442\n>> Yeah, it's a pretty well-oiled machine,\nthat's for sure and Ronnie, actually,\n\n361\n00:20:02.442 --> 00:20:04.458\nyou set yourself up for\npretty good segway, to be honest with you.\n\n362\n00:20:04.458 --> 00:20:07.204\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because we need to talk about\n\n363\n00:20:07.204 --> 00:20:09.080\ndistributed resource management.\n\n364\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.965\nWe need to talk about distributed power\nmanagement and high availability.\n\n365\n00:20:11.965 --> 00:20:13.709\nSo yeah, Ronnie, take it away.\n\n366\n00:20:13.709 --> 00:20:15.021\n>> All right, yeah,\n\n367\n00:20:15.021 --> 00:20:19.622\nlet's come back to that distributed\nresources scheduler again.\n\n368\n00:20:19.622 --> 00:20:22.523\nNow remember that when we\nstart taking a look at that,\n\n369\n00:20:22.523 --> 00:20:24.266\nonce that technology is set up.\n\n370\n00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:28.746\nIt allows us pretty much to be able to\ntake all of the computing resources that\n\n371\n00:20:28.746 --> 00:20:30.222\nwe have available to us.\n\n372\n00:20:30.222 --> 00:20:33.936\nCPU, RAM, storage, you name it,\nit takes all that and\n\n373\n00:20:33.936 --> 00:20:38.850\neven the networking portion and\naggregates it into a nice capacity pool.\n\n374\n00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.340\nIn other words, you can take as much or\nas little as you need to and\n\n375\n00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.070\nit can say, look,\n\n376\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.220\nhere's what your VMs gonna have access\nto and that's what you normally need.\n\n377\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.000\nSo that means you're not limited by\nthe hardware that you installed that\n\n378\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.080\nVM on, okay?\n\n379\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.260\nSo let's say, in that example that we used\nat the very beginning of our episode here,\n\n380\n00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.890\nwhere you do have those three,\nfour, five year old servers,\n\n381\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.930\nand Daniel you created a VM on this.\n\n382\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.130\nWell, the way that I started,\nyou didn't actually get\n\n383\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.010\nto move that VM off to another\nmachine just because you wanted to.\n\n384\n00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.790\nIt was pretty much like, no,\nyou gotta keep that same hardware,\n\n385\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.760\nyou gotta make sure that it's actually\nthere or it's gonna lose it's licensing,\n\n386\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.000\nit's gonna not work\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n387\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.969\nYou name it, things could actually end\nup happening in some of that stuff but\n\n388\n00:21:21.969 --> 00:21:23.342\nnow what are they saying?\n\n389\n00:21:23.342 --> 00:21:26.692\nWell, with the distributed resource\nscheduler, you don't have to worry about\n\n390\n00:21:26.692 --> 00:21:29.513\nthings like that, because it\naggregates it into this one big pool.\n\n391\n00:21:29.513 --> 00:21:33.512\nAnd every VM that you create, that's\ngonna be created on those clusters or\n\n392\n00:21:33.512 --> 00:21:36.571\nthose management stores there\nin the way that they want.\n\n393\n00:21:36.571 --> 00:21:42.790\nThey'll essentially see kind of a generic\nresource is what they'll see, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.859\nSo what does that give us\nthe ability to do as well?\n\n395\n00:21:45.859 --> 00:21:50.081\nOnce we actually have that it means we can\nactually allocate the resources based on\n\n396\n00:21:50.081 --> 00:21:51.133\ntwo things, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:51.133 --> 00:21:54.401\nWe can actually set up pre-defined\nrules if we want to or\n\n398\n00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:56.836\nwe can actually prioritize resource, so\n\n399\n00:21:56.836 --> 00:22:02.100\nthat those that have higher demands can\nactually utilize what they need to.\n\n400\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.830\nSo, we have some applications that\nare of higher value, so let's take for\n\n401\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:05.660\nan example,\n\n402\n00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:11.500\nthe lifeblood of all networking,\ncommunications in most offices is email.\n\n403\n00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.940\nHeaven forbid an email server goes down,\nthe other one of course is printers and\n\n404\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.940\nI always make a joke about\nthat in every episode.\n\n405\n00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.867\nBut or in every show that I do, printer\ngoes down, email goes down, you might as\n\n406\n00:22:21.867 --> 00:22:25.164\nwell have just said, I'm just gonna-\n>> Don't go to work today.\n\n407\n00:22:25.164 --> 00:22:27.660\n>> Yeah, yeah,\njust don't even go to work, yeah.\n\n408\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.850\nSo you might as well have said, yeah,\n\n409\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.860\nI brought that server down on purpose,\neven if you didn't.\n\n410\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.850\nSo those are some of the things, right?\n\n411\n00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:38.400\nWell, those high availability, those\nresources that really need that access,\n\n412\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.880\ndo you wanna prioritize that?\n\n413\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.730\nVerify that they always have\nthe resource they need.\n\n414\n00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.740\nDRS is actually what\nallows you to do that.\n\n415\n00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.880\nThe goal here behind DRS is fairly simple.\n\n416\n00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.630\nNo planned down time, okay?\n\n417\n00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.270\nAnd that is the key,\nyou need to work on servers?\n\n418\n00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.770\nPerfectly fine or\nyou need to replace RAM in the ESX host?\n\n419\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.378\nPerfectly fine, okay?\n\n420\n00:23:00.378 --> 00:23:03.498\nYou simply use that dynamic resource\nscheduler and you say, well,\n\n421\n00:23:03.498 --> 00:23:05.919\nthis server's going down\nat this particular time.\n\n422\n00:23:05.919 --> 00:23:09.742\nAnd it will automatically start migrating,\nusing vMotion in the background,\n\n423\n00:23:09.742 --> 00:23:12.420\nthat should do everything\nthat we want it to.\n\n424\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.820\nAnd then, that server's gonna\nbecome free and available.\n\n425\n00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.840\nTurn it off, add in what you need to,\n\n426\n00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.420\nand then from that point on,\nyou can actually allow it to do that.\n\n427\n00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.502\nSo that dynamic resource scheduler is\nactually very cool to help us out.\n\n428\n00:23:25.502 --> 00:23:30.753\nWhen we have lower resource utilization,\nit can say look, Daniel you actually say\n\n429\n00:23:30.753 --> 00:23:36.094\nthis email server it needs this, and this\nmachine doesn't have that much RAM left.\n\n430\n00:23:36.094 --> 00:23:37.176\nIt can go all right,\n\n431\n00:23:37.176 --> 00:23:41.910\nlet's the move that across over to\nanother one that has available resources.\n\n432\n00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:46.250\nSo very impressive here about what\nthe distributed resource scheduler can\n\n433\n00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.240\nhelp us to do.\n\n434\n00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.875\n>> And what does that ultimately mean for\nour servers, Ronnie?\n\n435\n00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:53.395\n>> Yeah, well,\nwhat it ultimately means is that for us,\n\n436\n00:23:53.395 --> 00:23:56.387\nwe absolutely can have that ability,\nright?\n\n437\n00:23:56.387 --> 00:24:00.976\nTo not worry about whether one server\ngoes down or not because what,\n\n438\n00:24:00.976 --> 00:24:05.480\nthe idea of the resource manager\ntakes care of it, dynamically.\n\n439\n00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.480\nThat means Daniel,\nit's 2 o'clock in the morning,\n\n440\n00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.870\none of the servers goes down and\nDaniel just hangs up on me.\n\n441\n00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.005\nAnd the reason why he can do that-\n>> Which is what I do.\n\n442\n00:24:14.005 --> 00:24:14.505\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n443\n00:24:14.505 --> 00:24:15.245\nThe reason why he\n\n444\n00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:17.905\ncan actually afford to do that is one,\nI'm not his boss, okay,\n\n445\n00:24:17.905 --> 00:24:19.535\nwhich is probably the big one, okay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:24:19.535 --> 00:24:21.910\n>> Two is Daniel has confidence in what?\n\n447\n00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.260\nIf DRS is turned on,\nit's gonna take care of it.\n\n448\n00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.590\n>> Yeah, I like to think of it as a fixer.\n\n449\n00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.050\nRight, have you ever heard of that term,\na fixer?\n\n450\n00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.040\nA guy who's like, don't worry, I know\nyou've got a mess going on here, but\n\n451\n00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.830\nI'm gonna take care of it for you.\n\n452\n00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.160\nYou just go back to your sleeping and\nhave a good day.\n\n453\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.698\nI'm sure there are a lot of admins out\nthere that are just in love with that\n\n454\n00:24:40.698 --> 00:24:41.750\nfeature right here.\n\n455\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.030\nRonnie, what else do we need\nto know about distributed?\n\n456\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.690\n>> The distributed resource scheduler also\nworks in conjunction with not only thinks\n\n457\n00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.500\nlike vMotion to be able to move things\naround the way that we need and\n\n458\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.450\nto aggregate the pool of\nresources that we have, so\n\n459\n00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:58.580\nthat we can distribute them however we\nneed to, but also about power management.\n\n460\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.190\nOne of the strangest things in\nthe world right is to have a sender\n\n461\n00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:04.640\npower consumption.\n\n462\n00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.670\nI mean bills have to be high okay.\n\n463\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.606\nAnd so when bills are high,\npeople normally go hey,\n\n464\n00:25:09.606 --> 00:25:14.100\nhow do we conserve a little bit\nmore power in our data centres so\n\n465\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.660\nthat we can drop that bill significantly.\n\n466\n00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.710\nWell, one of those ways that\nvSphere helps us to do that,\n\n467\n00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.540\nof course, is through that DPM,\nthat Dynamic Power.\n\n468\n00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:27.790\n>> Management.\n\n469\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:28.990\n>> Distributed Power Management.\n\n470\n00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.730\nThat Dynamic Power Management.\n\n471\n00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:31.880\n>> There's so many acronyms.\n\n472\n00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.032\nIt's alphabet soup here today.\n\n473\n00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:33.623\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm going.\n\n474\n00:25:33.623 --> 00:25:34.738\nYeah. Yeah. Distributed Power Management.\n\n475\n00:25:34.738 --> 00:25:35.500\nI was like.\n\n476\n00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.535\nI'm reaching for words and\nthose aren't the right ones.\n\n477\n00:25:37.535 --> 00:25:40.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Distributive power management\n\n478\n00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.560\nis one of the neat features that\nagain works in conjunction with\n\n479\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.650\nall the rest of the stuff\nthat we've talked about.\n\n480\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.140\nSo I've been mentioning this over and over\nagain and this is also something I find\n\n481\n00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.980\nfascinating as well that you can actually\nset up this dynamic power management to\n\n482\n00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.260\ndo what we talked about, consolidation of\nservers or to power up servers as well.\n\n483\n00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.590\nIf you have everything\nkind of scheduled out,\n\n484\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.940\nif you have everything working out,\nvMotion is working fine, and\n\n485\n00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.713\nall the other things are actually working\nwell, the dynamic, the dynamic [LAUGH],\n\n486\n00:26:06.713 --> 00:26:08.745\nthe distributed power management-\n>> You're bound and\n\n487\n00:26:08.745 --> 00:26:10.376\ndetermined [CROSSTALK]-\n>> I'm going to say dynamic no\n\n488\n00:26:10.376 --> 00:26:10.970\nmatter what.\n\n489\n00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.490\nI'm going to call it that.\n\n490\n00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.390\nSo in this one,\nit can actually sit there and\n\n491\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.346\ntake a look at the data centre,\nyour VM host right.\n\n492\n00:26:18.346 --> 00:26:23.350\nIf your ESX host are actually running,\nlet's say at full steam and\n\n493\n00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.910\npower, the dynamic power schedule\nsays okay that's fine, but\n\n494\n00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.940\nif it actually can, and you can actually\nmanage this the way that you want too.\n\n495\n00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:37.360\nYou can say, when those resources\nare not required, let's do this.\n\n496\n00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.300\nLet's consolidate and\npush all those servers off to\n\n497\n00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:45.360\ntwo out of the three instead and\nthen power down that third one.\n\n498\n00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.920\nThen at a point in time, okay in other\nwords, you can actually schedule that time\n\n499\n00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.590\nor when a VM says I need to kick up some\npower, okay, it can actually say look,\n\n500\n00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.780\nbecause this VM needs power and\nit needs it's resources here,\n\n501\n00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:05.520\nit can power up that third ESX host and\n\n502\n00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.170\nthen move that using vMotion in the\nbackground, move that thing over there and\n\n503\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.150\nnow you always have it.\n\n504\n00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:15.820\nSo it actually does protect that\nability for you to conserve power but\n\n505\n00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.250\nat the same time preserve power.\n\n506\n00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:25.530\nSo kind of an unusual contrast there,\n\n507\n00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:30.480\nbut it protects power for the VM,\nbut allows you to also power\n\n508\n00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.570\ndown when you don't need that physical\nhost, so very neat technology there.\n\n509\n00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:38.190\n>> Yeah, and what's the coolest part about\nall of this when we take these distributed\n\n510\n00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:42.790\ntypes of technologies that they put\ninto vSphere is that it leads to what?\n\n511\n00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.032\nHigh availability right?\n\n512\n00:27:44.032 --> 00:27:47.510\nThey make sure that when you need\nresources, they're there and\n\n513\n00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.550\nthat it gets them and\nthat means my server's online.\n\n514\n00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.080\nThat means my systems are up and running.\n\n515\n00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.490\nAnd that's where we want to be,\nwe want to have the highest level\n\n516\n00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.516\nof availability as we can get,\nwe always talk about the five 9s,\n\n517\n00:27:59.516 --> 00:28:04.220\nthe mythical five 9s, if you can get it,\n[LAUGH] but that's what it's all about,\n\n518\n00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.610\nis trying to reach that\ngoal of high availability.\n\n519\n00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.050\n>> Yes, so when you start talking\nabout the idea of high availability,\n\n520\n00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.790\none of the key distinctions here right,\nwe normally talk about in contrast with\n\n521\n00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.940\nfault tolerance as well\n>> So let's go ahead and\n\n522\n00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.830\ndo the same thing.\n\n523\n00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.160\nLet's take a look at my screen here and\nthat will help us out.\n\n524\n00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.350\nSo in high availability,\nwhat are we really protecting?\n\n525\n00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.873\nWe're actually trying to make sure and\nsay, hey look,\n\n526\n00:28:24.873 --> 00:28:27.880\nthat VM that's doing any service\nthey want, email, web server,\n\n527\n00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.529\nwhatever it might be, so let's say it's\na web server this time, and if all of our\n\n528\n00:28:31.529 --> 00:28:35.530\ntraffic is driven there to that\nparticular web server, perfectly fine.\n\n529\n00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.040\nBut what happens when\nthat ESX host goes down?\n\n530\n00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.310\nWell without high availability,\nsame thing, okay.\n\n531\n00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:46.190\nThe host goes down, well the VM's gonna\ngo down, we're gonna lose customers.\n\n532\n00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:49.180\nPeople are not gonna be able to access\nto the material that they need or\n\n533\n00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.030\nthe resource that they need,\nthat's not a good day for anybody.\n\n534\n00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.660\nWith of course vSphere though, you can\nactually implement high availability,\n\n535\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.840\nokay, vSphere high availability and\n\n536\n00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.990\nwhen you do so,\nit protects that VM against what?\n\n537\n00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:09.845\nWell, against this, against that ESX\nhost going down because of the data,\n\n538\n00:29:09.845 --> 00:29:14.530\n[LAUGH] Distributed Power\nManagement System, right?\n\n539\n00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:18.630\nAnd the dynamic resource scheduler,\nand vMotion, and everything else that\n\n540\n00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.400\nwe've talked about in this episode,\nit can actually sense that hey,\n\n541\n00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:28.250\nsomething is happening with this server\nand say hey, at this level of agreement\n\n542\n00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:33.140\nhere, if I start sensing this,\nwe're gonna automatically use vMotion,\n\n543\n00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.270\nand just make sure then\nthat gets over there, okay?\n\n544\n00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:41.530\nSo that way, you're always actually up and\navailable and\n\n545\n00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.550\nyou don't have to worry\nabout this thing happening.\n\n546\n00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.750\nNow the other way that it does\nit to ensure that we have\n\n547\n00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.620\nthat 100% up time that we can do or\n\n548\n00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:53.640\nclose as possible is what we talked about\nhere in fault tolerance as well, okay?\n\n549\n00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.620\nThe way that this actually does that,\nso even though we might talk about\n\n550\n00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.900\nthe movement of the machines, the other\nthing that also happens is that every time\n\n551\n00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:06.690\nyou make a VM, vSphere automatically\ndoes that V Fault Tolerance for\n\n552\n00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.880\nus and gives us the ability or\nactually does it in the background.\n\n553\n00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.590\nIt creates what we call a Lock Step VM,\nokay which is\n\n554\n00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.590\ndynamically generated but\nis an exact copy of whatever your VM is.\n\n555\n00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.460\nYou update over here,\nit updates over here okay.\n\n556\n00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.370\nPerfectly fine.\n\n557\n00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.840\nNow you might be wondering why.\n\n558\n00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.040\nWhy is that good?\n\n559\n00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.780\nBecause an ESX host goes down,\nit automatically shifts it over here and\n\n560\n00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.690\nthis one's already running, okay?\n\n561\n00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.930\nSo you can actually see\nwhy that might happen.\n\n562\n00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.310\n>> It's like a mirror.\n\n563\n00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.850\n>> Yeah.\nIt really is and\n\n564\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.320\nthe hard thing about this,\nright, is that it really does.\n\n565\n00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.310\nIt creates not only that file but also,\n\n566\n00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.860\nof course,\neven these dynamic drives as well, right?\n\n567\n00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.440\nSo even those are actually\ncreated in duplicate just in case\n\n568\n00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.980\nthis one falls down, this one takes over.\n\n569\n00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.580\nNow by being able to keep this in\nlockstep in the background and\n\n570\n00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.230\nwe'll talk about this again a little\nbit later, there's a high speed ten gig\n\n571\n00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:04.240\nnetwork that you wanna actually maintain\nto make sure that you don't have that\n\n572\n00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.760\nbecause it sends a lot of traffic\nkeeping these things in lockstep.\n\n573\n00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.680\nIf it doesn't,\nnot that you can't do it but\n\n574\n00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.220\nanything less than ten gigs, you actually\nexperience that and you'll see that your\n\n575\n00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.850\nparticular one that you're actually using,\nVMware one, or VM1, it will be slow, okay?\n\n576\n00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.650\nAnd I'm not saying it's\ngoing to be dog slow, but\n\n577\n00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.170\nit's going to be slower\nthan you expect it to be.\n\n578\n00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:32.630\nYou have that ten gig backplane that's\nreally connecting them across that virtual\n\n579\n00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.640\nswitch that's actually being able to do\nthat and everything's actually set up\n\n580\n00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.250\nthe way it needs to between these, you're\nnot gonna ever notice when an actual VM\n\n581\n00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:44.560\nwent down on one server or did it go down\non the other one, you're not gonna know.\n\n582\n00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.220\nIt's pretty neat.\n\n583\n00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.260\n>> Yeah, it's awesome technology and\nwe really really like it.\n\n584\n00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.030\nWe're huge fans of the VMWare systems.\n\n585\n00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.620\nObviously, they put a lot of thought and\n\n586\n00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.190\na lot of effort into making these\nthing work as efficiently as possible.\n\n587\n00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:58.560\nIt's like they want you think\nthat their software is good.\n\n588\n00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.300\n>> Yeah.\nI think so.\n\n589\n00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.160\n>> It's amazing how that works.\n\n590\n00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.220\nWell Ronnie, it looks like we've\nwrapped up yet another episode.\n\n591\n00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.310\nI'm looking at the clock.\n\n592\n00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:05.990\nTime has dwindled away on his.\n\n593\n00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.216\nThank you for stopping by and\n\n594\n00:32:07.216 --> 00:32:10.110\nexplaining resource management\ninside of vSphere for us.\n\n595\n00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.300\nWe appreciate that.\n\n596\n00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.590\nWe thank you guys for\njoining us today and watching.\n\n597\n00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.725\nHopefully, you learned\na little something and maybe,\n\n598\n00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:17.230\nit was even a little bit entertaining.\n\n599\n00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.162\nWe're gonna ahead sign off for ITproTV.\n\n600\n00:32:19.162 --> 00:32:20.393\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n601\n00:32:20.393 --> 00:32:21.183\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n602\n00:32:21.183 --> 00:32:23.690\n>> And we'll see you next

to\nanother exciting episode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.444 --> 00:00:17.971\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:21.879\nin today's episode we're continuing on\nwith our VCA6 series Joining us back for\n\n6\n00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:25.050\na little more of that action is\nour good friend Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.840\nRonnie, welcome back to the show Sir,\nhow's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.290\n>> Well, it's going very well as\nwe continue on in our VCA6 series.\n\n9\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.160\nToday we're gonna take a look\nat what availability options and\n\n10\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.750\nfeatures that we have of\ncourse inside of V Sphere.\n\n11\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.900\nAnd the good thing is\n\n12\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.790\nby this point you're an expert at most-\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.480\n>> I say an expert.\n\n14\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.160\nYou at least know the majority\nof what we're gonna talk about.\n\n15\n00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.860\nBut there are a few more technologies\nthat we need to take a look at, as well.\n\n16\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.500\nAnd so that's what we wanna do is we\nwanna make sure that you actually\n\n17\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.040\nunderstand that there's\na breadth of technology that\n\n18\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.350\nis out there to help with\nthe idea of availability, right?\n\n19\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.220\nNow when we talk about\nthe availability for\n\n20\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.220\nmost of us at the end user level\nis that particular service,\n\n21\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.750\nmachine that we want, whatever it is,\nis absolutely going to be there.\n\n22\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.190\nIt's going to do what we\nwant when we want it.\n\n23\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.120\nAt any time that we want it,\nand that's kind of the key.\n\n24\n00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.390\nAnd normally at the network level we talk\nhigh availability more than anything else,\n\n25\n00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.790\nfault tolerance more than anything else.\n\n26\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.370\nSo when we start thinking of those two,\nwe've already discussed a lot of\n\n27\n00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.720\nthat technology and talked about the way\nthat they do work in a very basic way.\n\n28\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.170\nAnd we've actually shown even\ninside of the vSphere console,\n\n29\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.790\nwhere you can actually go and\nturn those things on.\n\n30\n00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.690\nWe're going to take a look at that\na little bit later on as well.\n\n31\n00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.120\nBut overall though,\n\n32\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.590\nwhen we start taking a look then\nat the idea of high availability.\n\n33\n00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.190\nThis has to not only include\nthat technology like that, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.830\nBut there also, of course, which is one\nof the big things inside of data centers.\n\n35\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.240\nIs how do we do back ups?\n\n36\n00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.820\nAnd so when it comes down to it, the\navailability feature that we're talking\n\n37\n00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.810\nabout that really ensures that\nwe have availability regardless,\n\n38\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.800\nno matter what, is that ability for\nus to do back ups.\n\n39\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.730\nNow, when we start taking a look then\nat the idea of backing up the computer,\n\n40\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.900\nwell we've got a couple of different\nthings that we could absolutely do here.\n\n41\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.730\nOne, we could actually run a back-up\nof the entire VM host, right?\n\n42\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.020\nThe ESX host, back up everything on it and\n\n43\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.190\nthat actually will work\nto back up the ESX host.\n\n44\n00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.860\nBut most of the time in\ntoday's environment though,\n\n45\n00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.080\nthat's kind of an unusually and\nmaybe even a pointless back-up and\n\n46\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.070\nbecause there's not a lot of configuration\nwe tend to do on the host itself.\n\n47\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.230\nOkay.\n\n48\n00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.070\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n49\n00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.210\nYou might say, well what if I have\nvirtual machines to store it?\n\n50\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.220\nYes.\nThat will back it up.\n\n51\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.770\nThat's one of the ways to do it.\n\n52\n00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.890\nEven in today's data center environments,\nusually we're actually kind of offloading\n\n53\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.870\nthe storage of even those VMs, right,\noff to some other data store that may be\n\n54\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.290\nlike a sand appliance or something\nelse that we might have available.\n\n55\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.550\nSo a lot of times just backing up\nthat host is really not what we need.\n\n56\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.350\nWhat we really need to do is we need\nto focus on the technology, right,\n\n57\n00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.150\nthat we really need to back up.\n\n58\n00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.230\nAnd when that comes down to it,\nwe are now starting to talk about\n\n59\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.400\nthe idea here of the way that we tend\nto back up VMs more than anything.\n\n60\n00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.600\nNow we do a lot of backups around here\nbecause we don't like to lose data.\n\n61\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.920\nBut backing up a VM\nactually is fairly simple\n\n62\n00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.190\nin the grand scheme of things, right.\n\n63\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.300\nBut it can be time intensive and it can\nactually be a little bit challenging\n\n64\n00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.100\nbecause of where these VMs actually reside\nand the way that we name these things.\n\n65\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.880\nSo you do want to pay attention to that\nwhen we start talking about it too.\n\n66\n00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.610\nThe manual way to do a backup of a VM,\nI think, is kind of the easiest thing.\n\n67\n00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.930\nIf I can get access to that data store,\nI simply right click it.\n\n68\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.040\nI copy it.\n\n69\n00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.980\nI put a little drive on it.\n\n70\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.860\nMove the whole thing over.\n\n71\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.030\nThere is my backup.\n\n72\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.860\nAnd will that work?\n\n73\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.950\nYou better believe it\nthat will work just fine.\n\n74\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.800\nBut now when we start talking about data\ncenters like the size that Daniel worked\n\n75\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.890\nin, me, I'm kind of a, the one,\nthe kind of very small data center, right?\n\n76\n00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.170\nFive or six servers max,\nis what I'm used to doing.\n\n77\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.900\nDaniel, how many server do\nyou think over there at\n\n78\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.380\nthe insurance company you worked at?\n\n79\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.380\n>> We had, in our data center,\nwe probably had a little over 100.\n\n80\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.500\n>> Just a little over a hundred.\n\n81\n00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.590\nSo, a little bit more in scale and size.\n\n82\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.130\nAnd to actually back up all those VMs,\n\n83\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.270\nwhich might have actually included\nI'm going to say a couple of hundred,\n\n84\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.980\nmaybe three, four, maybe a thousand VMs\nthat you might actually be running there.\n\n85\n00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.970\nWell now all of a sudden it's like yeah\nright clicking and copying a thousand\n\n86\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.230\nVMs along with those files may be\na little bit more than intensive.\n\n87\n00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.470\nSo the good thing is since\nvSphere has offered us so\n\n88\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.250\nmany different solutions another solution\nthat VMware offers us is something\n\n89\n00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.310\nthey of course call\nvSphere Data Protection.\n\n90\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.080\nOkay, vSphere Data Protection.\n\n91\n00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.390\nNow this is one that you can, I think,\nat least in the enterprise plus editions,\n\n92\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.480\nyou have access to it and\nthe standard one, not so much so.\n\n93\n00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.730\nBut in this one, right, when you start\ntaking a look, it is about the idea of\n\n94\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.520\nnow, across my data center, okay, now I\nneed to actually back up those things.\n\n95\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.850\nSo that, even in the loss\nof the entire data center,\n\n96\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.090\nwhat happens is we have a backup of it.\n\n97\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.240\nEven if that happens.\n\n98\n00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.730\nSo that's what the vSphere\ndata protection does for\n\n99\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.840\nus, is to be able to actually say, hey,\nhere's how we're going to do this.\n\n100\n00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.980\nNow, this particular type of protection,\nthough,\n\n101\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.427\nworks in conjunction with of course\nwhat is called the vSphere replication.\n\n102\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.570\nAlong with this technology it also works\ntogether with the high availability and\n\n103\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.410\nthe fault tolerance.\n\n104\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.860\nSo all that kind of comes\ntogether underneath\n\n105\n00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.340\nthe idea of data protection\nat the same time.\n\n106\n00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.700\nBut for you and me,\n\n107\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.700\nif we're just introducing, we can think of\nthis more of our backup management system.\n\n108\n00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.460\nWhen do we do backups, how do we do them,\nand what's actually gonna be effective,\n\n109\n00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.400\nand where is this actually gonna go,\nand where is this stuff gonna happen.\n\n110\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.500\nAnd to begin,\nlet's just take one VM cuz, again,\n\n111\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.530\nwith numbers, I think in the low\nnumbers I can handle, okay.\n\n112\n00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.750\nOnce you start getting above the two\ndigit sum, I'm probably not so good at.\n\n113\n00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.350\n>> More than what's on\nthe end of these sticks.\n\n114\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.650\n>> And more than what's on the ends\nof these, then all of sudden,\n\n115\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.250\nnow we're actually getting challenged.\n\n116\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.440\nAt least I am.\n\n117\n00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.940\nSo let's just take one.\n\n118\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.570\nOkay.\nSo, how does it do it?\n\n119\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.380\nWell, the way that the data protection\nworks here is that it says look,\n\n120\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.620\nwhat we're gonna do first is simple.\n\n121\n00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.750\nWe're gonna make a local copy first, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.400\nAnd you might say that's insane.\n\n123\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.290\nWhy would you ever back up something\nto the local copy, to the local drive?\n\n124\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.210\nWell, they make a local copy first, but\n\n125\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.730\nthat's where then that vSphere\nreplication comes in, right?\n\n126\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.100\nAnd then they essentially say all right,\n\n127\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.570\nnow that we have that local copy\nIt can now be relocated to our DR,\n\n128\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.490\nour disaster recovery, which is\nhopefully offsite somewhere, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.880\nSo that is the key is that it\nactually makes it first and\n\n130\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.310\nthen it replicates it over there.\n\n131\n00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.080\nSo this gives us that protection here\nthat we know that we are going to have\n\n132\n00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.080\nthat ability to do so.\n\n133\n00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.820\nAnd the good thing is,\nwith data protection we can turn it and\n\n134\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.810\nmake sure that everything is actually\ngoing to do what we need to.\n\n135\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.300\nNow, the other thing about it of course,\nit's one of the things,\n\n136\n00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.700\nthe hard concepts,\nthat especially if you are new to IT,\n\n137\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.610\nthe term backup is actually\nonly half of the job right.\n\n138\n00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.800\nIf you make a backup, perfectly fine but\nI know people that have made backups,\n\n139\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.720\nsaid, yeah I have a backup,\nand you go and restore it, and\n\n140\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.600\nit says, look, file corrupter not found,\nbackup does not exist, or\n\n141\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.175\nfile type is Is incompatible,\nwhatever it is.\n\n142\n00:07:42.175 --> 00:07:46.752\n>> I think it's at that point when\nthe beads of sweat start forming and\n\n143\n00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:48.065\nthe panic sets in.\n\n144\n00:07:48.065 --> 00:07:50.804\nYeah, I've definitely seen that happen.\n\n145\n00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:55.264\nAnd this is why normally on a typical data\ncenter environment We're backing up in\n\n146\n00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:56.783\nmultiple different ways.\n\n147\n00:07:56.783 --> 00:07:59.270\nI'm backing up using tape backup.\n\n148\n00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.880\nI've got a disaster recovery site.\n\n149\n00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.410\nI'm replicating across a WAN\nlink to a different state.\n\n150\n00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.820\nYou're doing everything you can to make\nsure that you have as much data backup and\n\n151\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.390\nas many ways as possible just\nto give us that fault tolerance.\n\n152\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.830\n>> And so if you remember the simple\nprocedure that I just said and\n\n153\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.340\nwhat Daniel just said, right?\n\n154\n00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.030\nAs many ways as possible.\n\n155\n00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.110\nThe default way automatically leaves\nyou with two backup copies, right?\n\n156\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.260\nThe one that's local, which is the one\nyou're not gonna depend on, but\n\n157\n00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.330\nthen the replication over to the backup\nto the disaster recovery site.\n\n158\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.120\nSo in other words, you really do,\nyou have two backups actually existing\n\n159\n00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.610\njust in the default way that\nthe data protection works.\n\n160\n00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.800\nNow, does that mean you will all, no.\n\n161\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.550\nMost of us know,\n\n162\n00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.190\nyou don't back up to the same exact\nhard drive that you took the backup of.\n\n163\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.040\nBut at the same time,\nit at least gives you that ability, right?\n\n164\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.780\n>> Now Ronnie, they do that,\nthey make that local backup basically for\n\n165\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.550\nspeed, right?\n\n166\n00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.010\n>> Right.\n>> Just trying to give you a high\n\n167\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.590\navailability, really quickly access But\nwe don't rely on that, right?\n\n168\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.780\n>> Correct.\nYou just want it for\n\n169\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.170\nspeed because when it's doing backup\nit does have to kind of slow down and\n\n170\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.540\ndo a little bit of a backup.\n\n171\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.730\nBut imagine if they said look, we're going\nto turn this backup on and here it is\n\n172\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.590\nRonnie, you're in Gainesville, our backup,\nour disaster recovery is in Vancouver,\n\n173\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.895\nwhich is on the other side,\non the west coast of another country.\n\n174\n00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:15.820\nWell, now all of a sudden,\n\n175\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.090\nif that's my only backup, well,\nthat's a little bit long distance.\n\n176\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.960\nAnd in-between here and\n\n177\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.210\nthere, think of how many places\nthat's possible along that way.\n\n178\n00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.640\nMaybe even just at my gateway.\n\n179\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.060\nBut let's say just anywhere along there\nthat traffic could slow down, could cause\n\n180\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.330\ndrops, could cause you name it before it\nactually arrives over there, the latency.\n\n181\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.550\nThere's just a ton of time, but\n\n182\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.320\nby making that local copy, it really does\nspeed things up, and then I said all right\n\n183\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.250\nnow that the local copy's made,\nlet me just replicate this over there.\n\n184\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.860\nAnd then in the end, hopefully you'll have\ntwo identical copies of that machine,\n\n185\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.910\nand you're ready to go.\n\n186\n00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.530\nYes, you don't depend on it.\n\n187\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.730\nBut at least you know that even during\nthat time, in the middle of the transfer,\n\n188\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.190\nright, transfer doesn't happen,\nyou still have what?\n\n189\n00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.830\nYou still have a backup, okay?\n\n190\n00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.000\nAnd when now it actually\nneeds to replicate again,\n\n191\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.020\nit will actually start doing\nit again when it needs to.\n\n192\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.560\n>> Yeah, then you can lean on it heavily.\n\n193\n00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.830\nYou can, we're not saying you don't use\nyour local backup, we're saying that,\n\n194\n00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:15.140\nif the worst has happened,\nyou've got that local copy, right?\n\n195\n00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.000\nBut if the hard drive on that local\ncopy dies, now what do you do?\n\n196\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.220\nSo that's why they make a local one.\n\n197\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.700\nThey have a local one that's nice and\nfast, like an access is,\n\n198\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:27.740\nas long as I have drive access, then I can\nrecreate my VM, or whatever has gone bad.\n\n199\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.290\nBut if the worst happens,\nthat drive fails, that backup is now gone.\n\n200\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.960\nThat's why we say you don't rely on it,\nbecause now we gotta reach out to our one\n\n201\n00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.665\nin Vancouver, or wherever,\nwe've stuck it in Iceland.\n\n202\n00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:39.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Put it on ice, right?\n\n203\n00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.510\nIt's quite green there I understand.\n\n204\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.230\n>> Yeah, it is,\nbeautiful from what I understand as well.\n\n205\n00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.490\nSo it's just one of those neat things\nthat you think the default way really did\n\n206\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.540\nautomatically leave you with a backup.\n\n207\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.470\nAnd then it replicates the backup,\nso they've thought about that idea\n\n208\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.470\nthe same way that Daniel has\nactually mentioned it, too.\n\n209\n00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.220\nNow, the other thing about it is remember\nthat that's part of, like I said,\n\n210\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.080\na backup,\nespecially when people entering IT,\n\n211\n00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.270\nthey think,\nthis is the greatest thing in the world.\n\n212\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:03.930\nAnd it is.\nOkay,\n\n213\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.890\nit absolutely will ensure that\nyour data is actually there.\n\n214\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.750\nBut the other part of it is that making\nsure that you can restore it, too, okay?\n\n215\n00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:16.780\nNow, in this restoration part, and this is\nwhere you always have the test and verify.\n\n216\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.130\nSo the good thing is,\n\n217\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.590\nit doesn't have to be restored back to\nthe actual source server again, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:27.030\nSo it allows you to actually go ahead and\ntake your replicated one and actually,\n\n219\n00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:32.800\nyou can go ahead and do a restoration to\na target, another complete other server.\n\n220\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.840\nOr you can actually replicate\nit back to the original source.\n\n221\n00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.510\nNormally we replicate back to\nthe original source if we need to.\n\n222\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.480\nBut a lot of times if we're actually just\ntesting it out we may do that randomly and\n\n223\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.070\ngo, you know what, let me just replicate\nover here, verify that it's on and\n\n224\n00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.250\nthen we'll kind of turn the thing off and\nnot worry about it.\n\n225\n00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.240\nBut that's some of the things that\nreally kinda helps out to do that.\n\n226\n00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.650\nThe other thing, of course, is because\nwe also have the VMWare tools, and\n\n227\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.770\nyou should, of course,\n\n228\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.960\nhave that installed in every VM that you\nactually do create inside of VMWare.\n\n229\n00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.500\nIt also checks those heartbeats to verify,\nokay, that hey,\n\n230\n00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.590\nthat machine's actually working and\ndoing everything that it needs to.\n\n231\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.940\nBut this is a quick way that it actually\nmakes a check of the replication and\n\n232\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.200\neverything else that goes on, and when\nyou turn it on it actually knows, hey,\n\n233\n00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.940\nthat this is a backup copy and everything.\n\n234\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.430\nSo you gotta realize that\nthat's also a part of it too.\n\n235\n00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.320\nAnd then because of\nthat duplicated backup,\n\n236\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.800\nthe very fact that it actually makes the\nbackup first and then just replicates it,\n\n237\n00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.770\nyou do, you minimize network traffic\nmore than anything else by doing this.\n\n238\n00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.110\nSo it really does.\n\n239\n00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.300\nWhoever it is and\nall those guys at VMware,\n\n240\n00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.090\nyou gotta love them because they did, they\ntried to think of everything that affects\n\n241\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.150\nwhat could happen in your data center,\nto try and minimize the impact and\n\n242\n00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.340\nstill give you all the availability and\nfeatures that you want.\n\n243\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.440\nBut this is what actually makes that\nserver's administrator's hard work kind\n\n244\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.020\nof glow a little bit because they're like\nthis is a fairly decent backup system\n\n245\n00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.900\nthat they have and the nice thing is it's\nactually done with that replication in\n\n246\n00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:05.530\nthe background, that VC replication, so\nthat you don't have to worry too much.\n\n247\n00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.830\nNow I don't have to say\nyou shouldn't check them,\n\n248\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.160\nyou should, should you restore them and\nverify them?\n\n249\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.270\nYou better believe it, but\nthey've got it figured out.\n\n250\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.450\nIt's not something that you had to come\nup with a whole new process to go man,\n\n251\n00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.820\nthis is great, and it's working, but\n\n252\n00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.470\nwe've always got to think about that idea\nof disaster recovery which you always do.\n\n253\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.440\nThey're thinking about it for you,\nso it makes it very neat, very easy.\n\n254\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.180\n>> That's right.\n\n255\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.200\nNow, don't think that the guys over\nat VMware have just stopped there.\n\n256\n00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.320\nThey are a smart group of people,\nto be honest with you,\n\n257\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.752\nI'm pretty impressed with them.\n\n258\n00:13:32.752 --> 00:13:33.264\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n259\n00:13:33.264 --> 00:13:34.450\n>> They have said, you know what?\n\n260\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.640\nWe wanna make sure that you have\nthe ability to really diversify\n\n261\n00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.050\nyour disaster recovery strategies, right.\n\n262\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.670\nWe don't want you to just be able to lean,\nor just have to lean on using backups,\n\n263\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.130\nnot that that's not a good solution,\nit is,\n\n264\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.380\nit's a fantastic one and\nthat's why most people do that.\n\n265\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.350\nBut they've really gone above and beyond,\nwent the extra mile, and given us some\n\n266\n00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.080\nextra features that we can lean on for\ndisaster recovery, right Ronnie?\n\n267\n00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.860\n>> They really have.\n\n268\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.850\nThe idea of the traditional disaster\nrecovery site is pretty expensive, right?\n\n269\n00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:07.620\nYou talk about the terms cold side and\nhot side, and stuff like that.\n\n270\n00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.730\nIt can actually range from,\nI'm gonna say, relatively inexpensive,\n\n271\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.890\nI'm not gonna say cheap because that's\nthe wrong term, to really a parody, right?\n\n272\n00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.980\nWhich is the most expensive\nway we can do everything.\n\n273\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.822\nVM ware says, look, we can actually\nimplement something in this way which\n\n274\n00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:27.488\nis to do kind of a replication and\na backup to the Cloud instead.\n\n275\n00:14:27.488 --> 00:14:33.067\nAnd so what they actually do is they have\nwhat we call vSphere Disaster, or actually\n\n276\n00:14:33.067 --> 00:14:39.030\nexcuse me VMware vCloud Air, I'm gonna\nnot say everything, Disaster Recovery.\n\n277\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.300\nSo vCloud Air Disaster Recovery.\n\n278\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.880\nAllows me to actually have my disaster\nrecovery as a Cloud based solution, okay.\n\n279\n00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.180\nNow most of us might go I don't know\nif I really should trust that or not.\n\n280\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.930\nBut it's really something that you can\nactually do and what this does is,\n\n281\n00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.995\nkind of strange here, it virtualizes\nyour entire infrastructure and\n\n282\n00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:04.860\nessentially backs it up to the Cloud.\n\n283\n00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.870\nAnd it does it through that vSphere\nreplication at the hypervisor level,\n\n284\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.130\nso it actually brings everything\nover that it can to do that.\n\n285\n00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.470\nNow, could that be expensive?\n\n286\n00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.040\nYou'd better believe it,\nthat's probably very expensive.\n\n287\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.900\nBut it's a solution that may\nabsolutely be something that\n\n288\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.920\nyou're willing to spend\na little bit of time in, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.180\nNow what about for\n\n290\n00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:29.220\nthose of us that go no way, that's not\nanywhere in the ballpark that we want.\n\n291\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.240\nWell, of course you can still do your\nown private Cloud type of disaster\n\n292\n00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.560\nrecovery as well.\n\n293\n00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.620\nAnd this is where we do count on\nthose virtualized technologies like\n\n294\n00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:43.300\nthe virtual sand technology that we talked\nabout, as well as vSphere Replication.\n\n295\n00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.892\nAnd we start doing stuff, right.\n\n296\n00:15:44.892 --> 00:15:46.120\nAnd we start creating the sands and\n\n297\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.350\nwe start actually backing\nup the machines like that.\n\n298\n00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.907\nWorks incredibly well.\n\n299\n00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:54.881\nIt works seamlessly, especially\nalso works dynamically If you also\n\n300\n00:15:54.881 --> 00:16:00.850\nimplement another solution that is\ncalled the VMware Site Recovery Manager.\n\n301\n00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.228\nOkay, the VMware Site Recovery Manager\nis exactly like it sounds,\n\n302\n00:16:04.228 --> 00:16:07.210\nit's a software solution for\ndisaster recovery.\n\n303\n00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:15.210\nIt automates the execution\nof a disaster recovery plan.\n\n304\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.840\nNow what in the world is that about?\n\n305\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.390\nOkay.\n\n306\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:24.440\nWell, in disaster recovery planning,\ndrills, being on call,\n\n307\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.060\nbeing the guy that's actually gonna\nbe there when these drills happen.\n\n308\n00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.460\nIt takes a lot of time.\n\n309\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.660\nOkay.\nAnd even just to get\n\n310\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.120\nimplemented at the start here\n\n311\n00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.300\nwell they're saying that they have\nsomething that can actually automate that\n\n312\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.320\nidea of executing the disaster recovery\nplan in a virtualized environment, okay?\n\n313\n00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.860\nSo if you actually implement all of this,\n\n314\n00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.830\neven in your private cloud solution,\nthere's a way to automate\n\n315\n00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:51.820\nthe kickoff of this if something does\nhappen to your actual primary site.\n\n316\n00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.440\nSo you can't beat that that they've\neven thought about the fact that\n\n317\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.990\nlook it could be that when you call\nRonnie at 2 o'clock in the morning\n\n318\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:04.120\nhe's not as responsive as he needs to be,\nand we can actually set those limits\n\n319\n00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.010\nset policies to make it kick\noff the way that we want it to.\n\n320\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.920\n>> Wow that's actually really cool\ncuz that is one of the most difficult\n\n321\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.030\nthings when a disaster happens,\nis to coordinate all the efforts.\n\n322\n00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.430\nMake sure that everybody gets up and\ngets moving, and starts recovery,\n\n323\n00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.840\ncuz as soon as you can get ahead\nof that problem, the better.\n\n324\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.160\nBecause you don't want to lose\nbusiness continuity, right?\n\n325\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.800\nWe're all about here talking\nabout high availability.\n\n326\n00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.930\nAs long as my site is down, as long as\nmy business is down technologically\n\n327\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.990\nI'm not making money, I'm not profiting\nmy customers, I'm losing them.\n\n328\n00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.700\nSo having another step already\ntaken care of for you,\n\n329\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.550\nright, that's one less thing\nyou have to worry about.\n\n330\n00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:48.720\nAnd again, VMware, they really have looked\nat this from the 10,000 foot view and\n\n331\n00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.750\nsaid we gotta encompass every possible\nscenario that we can, put it in software,\n\n332\n00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.700\nlet the software take it.\n\n333\n00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.750\nThat said, if we've got computers,\n\n334\n00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.120\nshouldn't they be automating things for\nus?\n\n335\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.660\nWhy are we doing all this work?\n\n336\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.200\nWe've got all this horsepower,\nlet's use it.\n\n337\n00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.560\nVMWare, that's exactly what they're doing.\n\n338\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.560\n>> It really is amazing that all\nof this can actually be done in\n\n339\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.400\nthe ways that we've talked about, okay.\n\n340\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.330\nBecause manually having to set\nup any of this stuff, right.\n\n341\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.420\nSetting up backups for every single\nserver, not something I wanna do.\n\n342\n00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.850\nI guarantee, okay, heck,\n\n343\n00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.320\nevery single VM definitely not\nsomething I wanna do as well.\n\n344\n00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.050\nBut, being able to implement\nthis in software and\n\n345\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.090\nsay yes this is how we want our VMs\nto backup and how we want it to do.\n\n346\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.240\nWe target wherever we want those\nthings to go and we're off and\n\n347\n00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.260\nwe're ready to go,\ngreat management solution for us.\n\n348\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.010\nThat VMware replication is kind of\nthe key element here too, okay?\n\n349\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:43.480\nNow I do wanna mention this\nidea of this VMware replication\n\n350\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.290\nbecause this is a little bit strange in\nthe way that this one works as well, okay?\n\n351\n00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:52.410\nSo we've talked briefly about\nthat vCenter, and, I mean,\n\n352\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.350\njust briefly about the vCenter.\n\n353\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:59.670\nEssentially, it is what ties together\nlike vSphere into the ESX host so\n\n354\n00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.750\nwe can control everything\nthat we need to do.\n\n355\n00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.760\nAnd actually,\nit is kinda the management interface for\n\n356\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.730\neverything that we do inside of vSphere,\nokay?\n\n357\n00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.590\nNow, the way that that works,\nthough, is not It's not magic.\n\n358\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.370\nThat's what I want to say.\n\n359\n00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.890\nOkay, ti's not magic.\n\n360\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.736\nThe strange thing is it actually comes in\nthe form of a virtual appliance, okay,\n\n361\n00:19:18.736 --> 00:19:19.470\nvSphere does.\n\n362\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.510\nSo in other words, it's a VM.\n\n363\n00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:26.960\nIt's a VM that you actually\nload up inside your ESX host.\n\n364\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.185\nAnd that's where it actually begins is\nthat load up of that and then you can run\n\n365\n00:19:31.185 --> 00:19:34.205\nvSphere on top of everything and\nthat actually loads up as well.\n\n366\n00:19:34.205 --> 00:19:39.630\nVSphere replication is the same thing\nas another appliance so this one\n\n367\n00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:44.720\ncosts extra money for you to actually\nbe able to use but it's actually a part\n\n368\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.860\nof it that you can actually bring in and\nit's another appliance that you have.\n\n369\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:54.300\nSo as long as your host machines\ncan run VMs, you're perfectly fine.\n\n370\n00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.660\nNow, they do have a couple of\ndifferent requirements though.\n\n371\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.360\nAnd I wanna make sure that I put this out\nthere, cuz if not I'll end up forgetting.\n\n372\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.780\nSo even though they sell an appliance,\nremember when you go in and create a VM,\n\n373\n00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.150\nyou actually have to create it\naccording to some specs here, okay?\n\n374\n00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.000\nSo one of the specs that\nthey require on the VM, or\n\n375\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.200\nthe replication here Is that it's\ngonna be a 64 bit appliance.\n\n376\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.170\nIt's gonna be a dual-core CPU.\n\n377\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.270\nSo you've gotta make sure that you\nactually have at least a dual-core\n\n378\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.970\nCPU configure there.\n\n379\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.145\nYou need at least a 10 gigabyte hard\ndrive and then you have to create another\n\n380\n00:20:26.145 --> 00:20:29.400\n2 gigabyte hard drive and\nthen you need 4 gigs of RAM, okay.\n\n381\n00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.120\nSo it doesn't have to be much but you\nhave to at least create those things and\n\n382\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:40.000\nthen you can load up that open format,\nthat OVF I think is what it is,\n\n383\n00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.210\nOpen Virtual Format, appliance or OVA.\n\n384\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.190\nAnd all of a sudden, now you have\nthat replication thing go on, and\n\n385\n00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.900\nit actually begins to\nwork in the background.\n\n386\n00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.250\nSo it is a lot of neat technology\nthat allows us management though at\n\n387\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.600\nthe virtual level, which means we, again,\n\n388\n00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.860\ndon't have to actually go into\nthe command line interface.\n\n389\n00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.660\nAnd if you're in Windows right,\nit's PowerShell and\n\n390\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.170\nconfigure all this stuff and\nget it working here.\n\n391\n00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:11.270\nA nice VM is essentially the way\nthat we can actually manage a lot of\n\n392\n00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.760\neverything that we're seeing.\n\n393\n00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.150\nMakes it very easy for us,\ngreat to actually be able to manage.\n\n394\n00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.450\nSo you do wanna take a look at that, okay.\n\n395\n00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.860\nThe last thing that we wanna\ntalk about just briefly here and\n\n396\n00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.450\nthis is something that's just\ncaught out on the objectives here\n\n397\n00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.660\nis to take a look at where we\nwould configure high availability.\n\n398\n00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.230\nNow we briefly took a look at\nit in another episode, but\n\n399\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.910\nlet's do a reminder here,\ncuz it's always great to actually do\n\n400\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.570\na little bit of a repetitious\nreminder just briefly.\n\n401\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.570\nSo here it is.\n\n402\n00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.480\nI'm on my vSphere Server\non my machine here, and\n\n403\n00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.830\nthis will kinda help us out, okay?\n\n404\n00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.650\nSo let's see it from here.\n\n405\n00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.770\nI clicked on the Home screen\nat this particular point.\n\n406\n00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.880\nAnd so you have a couple of different\noptions that you can get there if you're\n\n407\n00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.630\ntalking about implementing\na high availability.\n\n408\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.968\nSo, normally what I'm gonna do, is come\ndown here in this detail section and\n\n409\n00:22:00.968 --> 00:22:03.903\nclick on, let me see,\nlet's do host and clusters,\n\n410\n00:22:03.903 --> 00:22:06.140\nbecause that's the way I normally go.\n\n411\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.450\nAnd then, once we have a cluster right,\n\n412\n00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.600\nthis is where we can actually\nimplement a lot of new technology.\n\n413\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.300\nIf you don't have the cluster set up,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n414\n00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.020\nSo verify that you have your\ncluster set up over here.\n\n415\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.620\nIf you don't see this cluster set up or\nyou only have one ESX host in\n\n416\n00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.430\nyour environment, high availability\nis probably not gonna work for\n\n417\n00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.290\nyou the way that you want to, okay?\n\n418\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.890\nSo once you have that particular one,\nthere's the site A,\n\n419\n00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:39.772\nI'm going to just, let's see here,\nI'm gonna right click.\n\n420\n00:22:39.772 --> 00:22:42.013\nI'm lying to you,\nI'm not going to right click at all.\n\n421\n00:22:42.013 --> 00:22:43.535\nI'm going to click on manage.\n\n422\n00:22:43.535 --> 00:22:46.333\nI always look for properties.\n\n423\n00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:47.517\n>> You're a a Windows guy, right.\n\n424\n00:22:47.517 --> 00:22:51.883\n>> I always look for properties, but\nit's manage and then settings, and\n\n425\n00:22:51.883 --> 00:22:56.683\nnotice here in this kind of blue area,\nthere it is vSphere ha, which stands for\n\n426\n00:22:56.683 --> 00:23:01.190\nvSphere high availability, and\nit's currently turned off.\n\n427\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:06.560\nSo if I click on edit, here are just some\nof the basic things that I have to decide,\n\n428\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.650\nif I'm actually going to do this,\none of course is simply turning it on.\n\n429\n00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:15.620\nOkay, so now that I've got it turned on,\nlet me kinda zoom out just a little bit so\n\n430\n00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.390\nI can verify that I'm\nnot missing anything.\n\n431\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.350\nNope, nothing there.\n\n432\n00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.760\nSo then I can, nope maybe,\nthere we go, try and\n\n433\n00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.540\nmake sure we can see\neverything that we need to.\n\n434\n00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.380\nMove that over just a tad bit.\n\n435\n00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.720\nHost monitoring.\n\n436\n00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.660\nIf I need to make sure that\nI monitor on the heartbeats,\n\n437\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.770\nwe can do that, verify that that is\nactually gonna be part of the cluster that\n\n438\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.580\nI can do high availability with.\n\n439\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:42.090\nSame thing with the component\nmonitoring here as well.\n\n440\n00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:47.013\nSo, does that host have the capability\nto detect various failures that\n\n441\n00:23:47.013 --> 00:23:50.799\ndo not necessarily cause\nvirtual machines to go down.\n\n442\n00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:51.437\nOkay.\n\n443\n00:23:51.437 --> 00:23:54.397\nAnd would be unusable,\nyou could add that in.\n\n444\n00:23:54.397 --> 00:23:57.077\nAnd then, of course,\nyou can even monitor and\n\n445\n00:23:57.077 --> 00:23:59.640\nmanage the individual\nVMs if you choose to.\n\n446\n00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.330\nNow, just when you think that you're done,\nyou, of course, can expand that out,\n\n447\n00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.950\nlet me give it a moment.\n\n448\n00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.580\nAnd this will also tell you,\nof course, the default conditions\n\n449\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.890\nthat you can actually see weather or\nnot they're actually there.\n\n450\n00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:18.150\nAnd then the restart priority,\nyou can of course change that.\n\n451\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.890\nAnd you can continue to\ngo down through here and\n\n452\n00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:25.720\nchange those levels that you need to for\nthe responses that you need, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.760\nSo even though it seems as simple as just\na check box, which is what I had said in\n\n454\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.780\na previous episode,\nthere are a lot more features, now,\n\n455\n00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.590\nwe're not gonna take an entire episode and\ngo through all this feature, because\n\n456\n00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.630\nthat's when it gets in to configuration,\nbut it doesn't mean that you can't, right?\n\n457\n00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.740\nRemember, what we've also said\nin a previous episode too,\n\n458\n00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:48.300\nis that you can go and actually get access\nessentially to the same thing that I'm\n\n459\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.360\nusing right here on the show,\nyou just go into VMWare and\n\n460\n00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.940\nyou actually say hey,\nI wanna do a virtual lab of VSphere.\n\n461\n00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.950\nAnd you keep searching for it you\nhave to create a registered account.\n\n462\n00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.350\nBut once you do so\nyou'll be able to get access to it and\n\n463\n00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.890\nthen you'll be able to launch this up.\n\n464\n00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.660\nTake a look at some of those.\n\n465\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.950\nOne of the main things, and actually to\ntell you the truth in the entire exam.\n\n466\n00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.290\nThe only thing they call\nout a configuration for,\n\n467\n00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.740\nat least knowing where it's gonna be,\nis this, on high availability.\n\n468\n00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.790\nSo of all the things that\nthey could actually call out,\n\n469\n00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.250\nthis is the only one that they say hey,\n\n470\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.040\ntake a look at the configurations\nthat you have available to you.\n\n471\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.610\nKnow how to turn it on is essentially\nwhat you actually need to be able to do.\n\n472\n00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.720\nSo we wanted to make sure that we also\nshowed you that feature as well for\n\n473\n00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.680\nour particular show today.\n\n474\n00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.460\nSo a lot of different things that we can\ndo in terms of our availability features.\n\n475\n00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.460\n>> Yeah, and there's nothing\nbetter than some good hands on\n\n476\n00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.400\nto really solidify the concepts and\n\n477\n00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.730\nthe practices that we've been talking\nabout throughout these different episodes.\n\n478\n00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.570\nSo definitely avail yourself of\nthem having that free trial and\n\n479\n00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.440\nplus it's kind of fun, right?\n\n480\n00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.190\n>> It is.\n>> It's like,\n\n481\n00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.580\nyou don't have to worry about bringing\ndown an enterprise-level solution.\n\n482\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.660\nYou can just play,\nturn thing off, turn things on,\n\n483\n00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.070\nbreak it all you want and\nthen reset it back to zero and play again.\n\n484\n00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:04.330\n>> And speaking of that ride, this is\na fully featured solution just about and\n\n485\n00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.230\nthey have some on other products and\nwe'll see that in another episode again.\n\n486\n00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.300\nBut here, I mean to sit there and go, look\n\n487\n00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.970\nyou mean I have access to a virtualized\ncluster that I can actually do this?\n\n488\n00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:16.570\nAnd yes.\n\n489\n00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.510\nOkay?\n\n490\n00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.260\nWe can actually turn on, turn off?\n\n491\n00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.580\nYes.\nYou can actually do all that without you\n\n492\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.710\neven having to build your own virtual\nenvironment or having to download software\n\n493\n00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:30.040\nand install it and take hours sometimes to\ntry and just configure it just right here.\n\n494\n00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.320\nThey've got it done for you.\n\n495\n00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.480\nI would take advantage of it.\n\n496\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.110\nWhen getting ready for this exam.\n\n497\n00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.249\n>> Yeah, that's the way to fly, right.\n\n498\n00:26:35.249 --> 00:26:36.442\n>> It is.\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n499\n00:26:36.442 --> 00:26:40.060\nRonnie thanks for dropping by and\nexplaining these concepts for us today.\n\n500\n00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.660\nWe thank you guys for joining us we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n501\n00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.180\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n502\n00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.780\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n503\n00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.130\n>> And we'll

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:18.420\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.200\non today's episode we're moving\nforward with our VCA6 series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.030\nJoining us back for\n\n6\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.660\na little more of helping us out with\nthat is our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.680\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nsir, how's it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.780\n>> It is going great today.\n\n9\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.330\nThank you for having me back as we\ncontinue on to take a look at our VCA 6.\n\n10\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.090\nToday we're talking about\nsome of these different\n\n11\n00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.530\nproducts that are available for you.\n\n12\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.510\nWhen you actually start\nworking with vSphere and\n\n13\n00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.380\nsome of the things that we just haven't\ncovered so far in our series but\n\n14\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.150\nwe need to at least take a look at,\nat least know, more than anything else.\n\n15\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.800\nRight?\n\n16\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.510\nAnd so some of it actually is technology\nthat's working in the background, and\n\n17\n00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.330\nsome of it, of course, is stuff that\nwe're actually going to encounter.\n\n18\n00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.490\nSo that's where we're actually going\ntoday, is actually taking a look that and\n\n19\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.010\nso we're gonna be talking about\nthings like the VSphere NSX\n\n20\n00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.230\nin terms of the networking\nthe virtual networking technology.\n\n21\n00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.710\nWe're also gonna take a look at\nV Realeyes Operations as well.\n\n22\n00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310\nAnd these are kinda two of the main\ntechnologies that we need to\n\n23\n00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.980\ntake a look at and so\nlet's just go ahead and jump right in.\n\n24\n00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.950\nAnd that will get us started, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.070\nSo when we start talking about the idea of\nvirtualized networking we have mentioned\n\n26\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.700\nin a previous episode that one of the\nthings that they want to do is not only\n\n27\n00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.900\nthe idea of virtualizing a machine, which\nis what virtual machines are made out of,\n\n28\n00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.250\nbut in data center virtualization is\nvirtualizing every aspect of the data\n\n29\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.060\ncenter itself coming up ultimately\nwith the goal of what we call SDDC,\n\n30\n00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.280\nSoftware Defined Data Center,\n\n31\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.950\nin which all the components in our\ndata center is actually virtualized.\n\n32\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.620\nAnd this includes storage technology,\nmachines, or\n\n33\n00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.930\ncomputer servers that we have out there,\nas well as networking, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.210\nAnd so when we had mentioned the idea\nof networking inside of vSphere,\n\n35\n00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.510\nwe normally really deal with\nthe idea of virtual nics,\n\n36\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.390\nhow we actually attach virtual\nmachines to our network.\n\n37\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.490\nAnd then virtual switches.\n\n38\n00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.240\nHow we can manage and configure those\nswitches, so that they get along not only\n\n39\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.000\nwith virtual machines, but also be able\nto connect out to the rest of the world.\n\n40\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.890\nBut what is, excuse me,\n\n41\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.960\nthe underlying technology of all of that\nwhen we want it to actually be working for\n\n42\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.190\nan entire network itself inside\nof our data center itself.\n\n43\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.080\nSo what we actually have in the background\nis a technology that's called NSX,\n\n44\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.070\nthe V sphere NSX is our network technology\nthat actually does a couple of neat\n\n45\n00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.220\nthings for us.\n\n46\n00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.360\nNot only does it virtualize\nthe network infrastructure, but\n\n47\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.580\nis allows every single VM to be able to\n\n48\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.568\nkind of pretend like it has access to\nthose same networking infrastructures,\n\n49\n00:02:55.568 --> 00:02:59.460\neven though it's really\nworking in software okay.\n\n50\n00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.060\nSo that's what it does.\n\n51\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.560\nIt really is allowing that VM to\nthink that it's really connected to\n\n52\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.890\na physical network.\n\n53\n00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.500\nIt's not connected to anything else that\nis actually connecting to switches and\n\n54\n00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.270\nthen to routers through everything else\nand doing everything that we need to.\n\n55\n00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.880\nThis NSX technology is what\nallows us to be able to do that.\n\n56\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.820\nNow the benefit of this then is\na couple of different things,\n\n57\n00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.780\nespecially in the way that\nyou can manage the network.\n\n58\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.340\nIn this sense if I have my production\nnetwork with the infrastructure I normally\n\n59\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.410\nhave, switches, and then of course my\nVLANs, I have all this stuff set up, and\n\n60\n00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.060\nthen I have cables, and I have all\nthis stuff that I need that to do,\n\n61\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.050\nI have routing, and\nif I wanted to set up my own test network,\n\n62\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.650\nthere's a lot of configuration\nthat might need to go on, right.\n\n63\n00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.500\nOn the switch itself I\nmight need to go ahead and\n\n64\n00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.620\nactually create a different VLAN for\nmy testing environment.\n\n65\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.110\nIf I needed to get access maybe\neven out to the Internet.\n\n66\n00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.180\nI may even go ahead and set up\na virtual IP on my firewall saying hey,\n\n67\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.390\nhere's the default gateway,\nhere's the public IP address I wanna use,\n\n68\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.890\nnot my production network, so\nit can also get out there as well.\n\n69\n00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.590\nThen I might also have\nto configure NAT for\n\n70\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.300\nmy private network, also configure a\ndifferent IP range for my testing network.\n\n71\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.490\nMan you name it, it starts to now sound\njust in the networking portion right and\n\n72\n00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.720\nfinding cable making sure there all\nconnected, you know you name it.\n\n73\n00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.000\nIt begins to get a little\nmore hefty in that sense.\n\n74\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.350\nBy using something like NSX and\nallows us to create this in software and\n\n75\n00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.690\nwe can create our own virtual\nnetwork inside of well NSX and\n\n76\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.380\nsay here's gonna be my testing and\ndeveloping network.\n\n77\n00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.290\nAnd we create that virtual switch and\n\n78\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.930\nnow we take all those virtual NICs and\nwe attach them to that virtual network and\n\n79\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.570\nfrom that point we still have to do\nsome IP assignment, we still have to do\n\n80\n00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.910\na couple of other things but don't have\nto worry about that's actually out there.\n\n81\n00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.510\nAnd the reason why is, all of this\ncan be configured inside of software\n\n82\n00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.630\nthat actually revolves around\nthe technology built on top of NSX, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.540\nSo that is key, and the reason for\nthat is because of the way that NSX works.\n\n84\n00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.270\nIt can actually take your entire\nnetworking infrastructure,\n\n85\n00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.220\nand the bandwidth capabilities\nas well as everything else, and\n\n86\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.670\nbe able to reassign them\nhowever we want to.\n\n87\n00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.403\nSo it doesn't matter if you're actually\ndirectly connected to it or not.\n\n88\n00:05:17.403 --> 00:05:21.630\nNSX says yeah, you can use it,\nif you need to.\n\n89\n00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.310\nWe can actually make sure that this\nactually looks like it's attached to that\n\n90\n00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.940\nand it can do all that stuff.\n\n91\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.420\nIt's amazing without having to\nre-cable and redo physically.\n\n92\n00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.090\nIs the reason why, right?\n\n93\n00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.880\n>> It sounds like they are doing their\nbest to simplify a process that's normally\n\n94\n00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.410\nquite complex.\n\n95\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.830\n>> That is the whole goal, okay.\n\n96\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.730\nEverything that you actually see in VMware\nis designed to be ready for Ronnie.\n\n97\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.660\nI've mentioned that before.\n\n98\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.320\nThat's what it's really designed to be.\n\n99\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.140\nNow it doesn't mean it\ndoesn't take training, no,\n\n100\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.050\nit takes a little bit of training.\n\n101\n00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.900\nBut overall though you're not gonna\noverwhelm a network administrator that\n\n102\n00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.810\ndoesn't have a lot of experience\nin terms of let's say\n\n103\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.530\nconfiguring a firewall or configuring\nswitches or VLANs or stuff like that.\n\n104\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.280\nIt can actually be done through kind\nof a web portal interface just about.\n\n105\n00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.070\nYou got to manage in the background all\nthat stuff and be able to figure it out.\n\n106\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.230\nNow I'm not saying like I said\nthat it doesn't take training.\n\n107\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.720\nBut it's actually a lot easier for\nsomebody to walk through that and\n\n108\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.920\nactually see that then for\nsomebody to actually kind of have to\n\n109\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.780\nfigure out everything in\nthe background for them.\n\n110\n00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.400\nNow you might be like how the heck\ndoes it do it if they're not really\n\n111\n00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.860\nconnected together?\n\n112\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.570\nWell, because of the way it virtualizes\neverything in your network, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.030\nThere's a term that VMware uses\nwhen they start talking about this.\n\n114\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.100\nIs that essentially the networking\ninfrastructure, okay, is decoupled, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.070\nSo in other words, what NSX does is\n\n116\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.400\nit creates that virtual networking\nenvironment as a capacity of networking.\n\n117\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.200\nOkay?\n\n118\n00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.550\nAnd it literally does not depend on\nthe physical hardware in this location,\n\n119\n00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.140\nand everything else that it does.\n\n120\n00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.590\nIt really separates that out.\n\n121\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.530\nSo anything that we do at that\nvirtual networking level,\n\n122\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.290\ndoesn't affect how the underlying\ninfrastructure was set up.\n\n123\n00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.940\nIt just says, I'm gonna manage it in this\nway, and this is how it's actually going\n\n124\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.210\nto work instead, and\nit does a very good job at doing it.\n\n125\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.690\nSo, underlying the technology\nof virtual switches,\n\n126\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.720\nwhether they're standard virtual switches,\nor distributed virtual switches, well,\n\n127\n00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.610\nit's based on top of this NSX,\nis what it's based on.\n\n128\n00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.620\nAnd the same thing, even with your\nvirtual niches and connecting.\n\n129\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.220\nAnd even though it says,\nwe connect to a network, and\n\n130\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.810\nit seems like what we're doing is\nwe're actually attaching a cable.\n\n131\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.820\nIt's really NSX that allows\neach VM to actually think\n\n132\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.620\nthat it's on a physical network.\n\n133\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.540\nSo very neat technology.\n\n134\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.470\n>> So Ronny what are some of\nthe features that we need to be\n\n135\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.300\nfamiliarized with when it comes\nto this virtualized network?\n\n136\n00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.300\n>> Well when it comes down to it what does\nNSX create, essentially is what it does.\n\n137\n00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.370\nIt helps us to be able to do the layer\ntwo and layer three switching right.\n\n138\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.889\nSo it actually allows us to use that\ntechnology that we would normally\n\n139\n00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:01.595\nencounter in terms of switches.\n\n140\n00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:05.024\nRight there, and it allows us to build\nthose virtual switches in that way\n\n141\n00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:07.710\non layer two as well as\nlayer three switching.\n\n142\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.860\nAnd that's because we can actually\ndo that regardless of where we are.\n\n143\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.170\nAnd so we don't always have to\nhave layer three switches for\n\n144\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.370\nevery single VM that we go to, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.300\nBut we can have layer three switching\n\n146\n00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.210\nas far as some of\nthe physical infrastructure.\n\n147\n00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.570\nBut internally, every device that we have\nmay actually be able to use the layer\n\n148\n00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.920\nthree switching if we actually\nwant to do something like that.\n\n149\n00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.560\nWe can also of course create\nour own layer two gateway.\n\n150\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.450\nTo actually be able to connect this and\nwe would normally do this for\n\n151\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.040\nphysical workloads going between our\nservers, so we can also do that.\n\n152\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.367\nWe can also route data, and that means if\nI create those two virtual networks like\n\n153\n00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:47.510\nthey're talking about, not that you would\nactually do this between your testing\n\n154\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.500\nnetwork and your production network,\nbut if I wanted to create a network for\n\n155\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.930\nmarketing and then another one for\nresearch and development or\n\n156\n00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.140\nanother one for programming, right?\n\n157\n00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.800\nI can create three virtual networks,\nand when I do that,\n\n158\n00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.930\nI'm creating VLANs which also means\nrouting has to go in between.\n\n159\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.500\nWell NSX handles the routing\nthat actually goes in between\n\n160\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.550\nthe logical switches that I also set up,\ntoo.\n\n161\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.060\nSame thing with firewalls.\n\n162\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.050\nIt creates a distributed firewall instead.\n\n163\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:22.018\nSo even if I have just a single firewall,\nokay, in my entire network,\n\n164\n00:09:22.018 --> 00:09:27.325\nokay, I can actually make it look like,\nwell, every network has its own firewall,\n\n165\n00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:30.860\nokay, and that we can actually\nconfigure it the way that we need to.\n\n166\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.020\nBut, lastly and most importantly, at least\nin my eyes, okay, the thing that affects\n\n167\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.230\nevery single virtual machine, of course,\nis the idea of network performance.\n\n168\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.770\nWe've all experienced\nit at some point here\n\n169\n00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.740\nwhere even if we actually put Gigabit\nadaptors on our network, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.510\nOn our devices, it could be that we\nare actually saturating the entire network\n\n171\n00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.760\nwith our data, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.710\nAnd so\none of the things that NSX really does and\n\n173\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.010\nreally is kind of the heart of where\nend users, and when I say end users,\n\n174\n00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.385\nserver admins like you and me, and\nnetwork admins like you and me.\n\n175\n00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:09.340\nWhere really does is base job,\nis the idea of load balancing, so\n\n176\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.770\nthat all of our virtual machines,\none will never be starved.\n\n177\n00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.430\nOkay?\n\n178\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.580\nAnd one will never get to\ndominate the entire network.\n\n179\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.140\nOkay?\n\n180\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.160\nSo it absolutely can be in the background,\na load balancer across the entire\n\n181\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:29.160\ncapacity of everything that we give\nNSX the ability to be able to do.\n\n182\n00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.570\nAnd that's what really\nmakes a very powerful\n\n183\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.410\ntype of connection and\nsoftware for you and me.\n\n184\n00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.210\nIf we're just managing servers, or\n\n185\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:45.720\nif we're actually managing the entire data\ncenter itself through vSphere here, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.428\nIf we are, we can control that but if we\nabsolutely are just that server manager,\n\n187\n00:10:50.428 --> 00:10:55.139\nwe can create those VM's and treat those\nnetworks connections inside of HVM like\n\n188\n00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:58.180\nthey're connected to\na physical connection.\n\n189\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.840\nOkay.\n\n190\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.560\nThat means you got to learn a brand new\ntechnology if all you're giving access to\n\n191\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.860\nare those six or seven VMs, your servers.\n\n192\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.080\nYou actually go okay,\nare these on the right network?\n\n193\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.330\nWell, whoever is actually doing\nthe administration for that says yes,\n\n194\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.480\nhere is the networks that they're attached\nto, and you're off and you're ready to go.\n\n195\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.470\nSo it really is kind of neat where\n\n196\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.060\nyou can actually see it's not gonna affect\nsomebody that needs to work in the VMs.\n\n197\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.250\nIt's actually really going to,\nin the background,\n\n198\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.275\nsave you a lot of configuration as\nthe manager of that entire datacenter.\n\n199\n00:11:28.275 --> 00:11:30.220\n>> Now,\nthat's something we all like, right?\n\n200\n00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.630\nJust to go to one nice little area,\neverything's kind of laid out for\n\n201\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.720\nyou to try to give you\na wonderful interface, and\n\n202\n00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.900\nto work with all these different\ntypes of technologies.\n\n203\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.890\nNow speaking of technologies\ninside of VMware and\n\n204\n00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.490\nvSphere specifically,\nwe talked about this.\n\n205\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.010\nRonnie, you kind of hinted at this before,\nand it's the vRealize, right?\n\n206\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.380\nYou whet our appetite,\nnow service the main dish, if you would.\n\n207\n00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.740\n>> Yeah, when it comes down to\nthe idea of management, right?\n\n208\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.100\nSo, we're not talking about configure,\nand don't get me wrong,\n\n209\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.350\nI love the idea of actually being able to\ncreate VMs and get them up and running and\n\n210\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:09.400\nvirtual networking, all of that to me\nsounds cool and fun and love to do that.\n\n211\n00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.970\nBut, most people in the data center\nthey're, that's kind of the,\n\n212\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.500\nthat keeps them in the data center\nbecause they have to maintain that stuff.\n\n213\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.100\nBut all of our though, one of the things\nhas to happen is that data center needs\n\n214\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.420\nto run efficiently, well how do you\nrun the data center efficiently?\n\n215\n00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.490\nNow that's prior whole\nanother course here, but\n\n216\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.740\nwhen it comes down to everything else,\nright?\n\n217\n00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.680\nIs the ability for you or\nwhoever the group is,\n\n218\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.120\nright, to see data when\nthey need to see it.\n\n219\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.680\nThen to take that data and make what good\nbusiness decisions with the data that they\n\n220\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.710\nsee at that particular point in\ntime across the entire datacenter.\n\n221\n00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.210\nNot just in their specialized locations,\n\n222\n00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.990\nbut across the entire\ndatacenter if they need to.\n\n223\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.380\nAnd then take that information and\nactually do something with it.\n\n224\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.220\nSo that's what we want, right?\n\n225\n00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.320\nSo if we need to make business decisions\nand we need to make smart technical\n\n226\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.370\ndecisions here, we need some\ncomponent that allows us to see\n\n227\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:09.090\nthe entire data center itself and\nget information the way that we want to.\n\n228\n00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.370\nAnd the vRealize Suite, okay,\nis what helps us do that.\n\n229\n00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.410\nThere's a vRealize Operations Manager,\n\n230\n00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.590\njust like there's actually\na vSphere Operation Manager.\n\n231\n00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:23.310\nvRealize is kinda the next\nevolution of that to bring that up.\n\n232\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.810\nAnd then of course there's\nactually a logging in site.\n\n233\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.630\nThere's a bunch of different things,\nthat it actually pools in together, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.490\nAnd what this it's doing, is it's\nfeeding off of everything here, and\n\n235\n00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:39.120\nwe now have a single location in\nwhich that data can be brought into,\n\n236\n00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.940\nand then we can actually interpret and\nanalyze it.\n\n237\n00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.740\nSo let's take a look at that thing\njust for a moment here, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:51.300\nSo here it is, I've actually got this\none running and up and operating here.\n\n239\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.470\nSo here it is, it's called the vRealize\nConfiguration Manager, okay,\n\n240\n00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.010\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n241\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.730\nSo after you actually\nget this VM running and\n\n242\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.480\ndoing everything that it needs to\nstarted getting data sent to it.\n\n243\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.430\nWell, some of the things that you have\naccess to are all of these inside of\n\n244\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.980\nthe console and what needs to happen.\n\n245\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.110\nNow you're probably saying\nthat's a bit small.\n\n246\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.610\nLet me kind of zoom in\njust a little bit here so\n\n247\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.650\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n248\n00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:22.440\nDashboards, Alerts, Asset Extensions,\nChange Management Unex remote commands,\n\n249\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.980\nWindows remote commands,\nDomains discovered you name it.\n\n250\n00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.640\nWe're gonna spend a little\nbit of time on here.\n\n251\n00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.690\nJust describing some of these features.\n\n252\n00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.560\nNow, there's a lot more\nthat's actually available.\n\n253\n00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.330\nIn other words you could probably\ndo an entire show on just Vrealize.\n\n254\n00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:38.790\nWe're not gonna go into that.\n\n255\n00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.830\n>> But you just have that ability, right?\n\n256\n00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.020\nTo actually be able to have everything\nat your fingertip is what you need.\n\n257\n00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:49.030\nSo let's take for\nan example this idea of dashboards here.\n\n258\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:54.080\nDashboard gives us a quick view of\nthe entire data centers health and\n\n259\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.840\nof risk, as well as efficiency of\nthe entire virtual infrastructure.\n\n260\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.970\nSo instead of you having to\ngo to everything single rack.\n\n261\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.280\nOkay, instead of you having\nto go to the devices and\n\n262\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.030\npull off that stuff, these dashboards\ngive you a quick at a glance, okay.\n\n263\n00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.880\nTake a look here, are there risks that\nare actually occurring throughout my data\n\n264\n00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:19.770\ncenter, is the view of the health actually\nsomething that you take a look at?\n\n265\n00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.850\nAnd so that is dashboards\nreally do help out in that way.\n\n266\n00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.440\nThe other part of this, of course, is that\nthere's also what they call health and\n\n267\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.260\nworkload views.\n\n268\n00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.530\nSo there's a couple of different views\ninside of those dashboards and I don't\n\n269\n00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.280\nknow which one dash they pick here,\nlet's just pick the windows dashboard and\n\n270\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.140\nwe'll see, where you can actually see\nsome of these different ones, where it\n\n271\n00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.630\ngives you the analysis and the disk\ninformation, change management itself.\n\n272\n00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.953\nYou can actually take a look and what\nthat can actually do for you is identify\n\n273\n00:15:47.953 --> 00:15:51.091\nanomalies that are also happening\ninside of your data center, okay?\n\n274\n00:15:51.091 --> 00:15:53.140\nDo you have any fault stress workloads,\n\n275\n00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.885\nis there something that's actually\nimpacting the performance, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:56.885 --> 00:16:01.821\nAll this can actually be done and a lot of\nit actually does take a look at it through\n\n277\n00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:04.120\nthese different things that we see.\n\n278\n00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.751\nNow one of the things that they do point\nout specifically here is the idea of\n\n279\n00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:12.634\nalerts and what they call active or\nsmart alerts, excuse me,\n\n280\n00:16:12.634 --> 00:16:15.050\nProactive Smart Alerts here, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.290\nThese types of alerts, okay,\n\n282\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:22.080\nallow us to actually do root cause\nanalysis, okay, of something that can\n\n283\n00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.820\npotentially impact the way that our\ndata center's actually performing.\n\n284\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.780\nSo, instead, because it's actually\nreading all the sensors that we've\n\n285\n00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.460\nnow got distributed\nthroughout our network here,\n\n286\n00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.990\nwe can actually see all that information\nand once again, make reports,\n\n287\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.370\ndo all the things that we need to and\nthen, even workload details.\n\n288\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.700\nAnd some of this,\nyou have to go I think maybe even into\n\n289\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.210\nsome of these other ones down\nhere in terms of compliance.\n\n290\n00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:52.130\nNow my machine's acting really slowly and\nI don't wanna just kinda wait here\n\n291\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.420\nat some of these, but you can actually\ngo ahead and set compliance levels for,\n\n292\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.800\nis this machine performing at\nthe level that we want it to?\n\n293\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.180\nIf it's not, send me an alert, okay?\n\n294\n00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.040\nWe can do that.\n\n295\n00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.780\nYou can also manage your Active Directory\ndashboards here, sites, groups,\n\n296\n00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.460\nsecurity, create different\nreports based on machines or\n\n297\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.840\nvirtual objects here, and\nthen the administration, of course.\n\n298\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.490\nDifferent settings that we can actually\ndo on basic configuration, and\n\n299\n00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.890\nall of this is done through that vRealize.\n\n300\n00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.660\nNow remember that this is gonna be\na separate product from vSphere,\n\n301\n00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.010\nis what we normally have, and there are so\nmany other things that you can do,\n\n302\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.550\nyou can actually create heat maps.\n\n303\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.970\nYou can do a ton of different things that\nare going on in the background to check\n\n304\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.590\nfor capacity, for remediation action.\n\n305\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.890\nIf you actually know something is not\nmeeting up to the compliance that you want\n\n306\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.660\nto be able to identify them, and\n\n307\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:52.790\neven create your own custom type\nof reporting, if you need to.\n\n308\n00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:58.790\nSo, make sure you go to the,\nagain, the VMware website and\n\n309\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:03.000\nagain, take a look for\nvRealize Virtual Lab, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.370\nAnd you'll also be able to get access\nto a lab that actually allows you to\n\n311\n00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.990\ntake a look a little bit more in depth and\n\n312\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:13.130\ndetail about what you'll also see\ninside of vRealize here, too, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.810\nNow underlying, of course,\nthe vRealize operations itself,\n\n314\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.040\nokay, also helps out in this way,\n\n315\n00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.170\nis that there is something that\nwe also call vRealize Automation.\n\n316\n00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.550\nNow, what does vRealize Automation do?\n\n317\n00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.160\nvRealize Automation now\nsets up kind of an unusual\n\n318\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.800\nhelp desk type of situation in this way.\n\n319\n00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.298\nIt allows you to go ahead and\ncreate a secure portal, okay,\n\n320\n00:18:41.298 --> 00:18:44.380\nwhere now, different things\ncan actually be requested.\n\n321\n00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.710\nSo instead of me saying, let me send\nan email to Daniel cuz I need more RAM\n\n322\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.668\non this particular machine or\nI need more storage space, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:52.668 --> 00:18:55.220\nAnd I send Daniel an email.\n\n324\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.590\nAnd the way that I entitled it is what,\nRAM and Storage Space and\n\n325\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.460\nI just say, I need this on my servers,\nand Daniel's like, I've got 300 servers?\n\n326\n00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.480\nHe didn't even tell me which\nserver he wanted that on.\n\n327\n00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.400\nWell, what we can do is actually\nhave this secure portal\n\n328\n00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.120\nwhere it brings up a nice kind of,\nwhere they call it a catalog.\n\n329\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.320\nIn other words, a populated\nwebpage that I can check mark, or\n\n330\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.730\nI can say, here's the name of the machine,\n\n331\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.600\nRAM needed increased capacity, whatever\nit is, and that standardizes it, right?\n\n332\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.000\nIt gives the user like me,\nchoices that I have to make and\n\n333\n00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.890\nthen can send that over to Daniel\nas he's managing data center.\n\n334\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.270\nAnd he can take a look at that particular\nVM and go okay, I can reassign that and\n\n335\n00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.400\nactually add those resources in there.\n\n336\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.220\nAnd maybe also at the same time,\nonce he does that, clicks on it, and\n\n337\n00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.060\nsays hey, it was done and\ncompleted on this day.\n\n338\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.140\nHe doesn't have to worry about\nactually sending it back to me.\n\n339\n00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.424\nSo all that's part of that automation in\nterms of the things that we actually have\n\n340\n00:19:55.424 --> 00:19:57.460\navailable to us, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.340\nNow, there's one other thing that\nthey actually mention in the vRealize\n\n342\n00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.240\nobjectives here, which is something\nthat they call vRealize Air.\n\n343\n00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.180\nvRealize Air has changed to something but\nofficially,\n\n344\n00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.230\naccording to VMware's web page, it has\nbeen discontinued as of March 2016, okay?\n\n345\n00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:18.590\nSo essentially right before\nthe beginning of this particular show,\n\n346\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.790\nvRealize Air is not something\nthat we tended to deal with.\n\n347\n00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.990\nAnd more than likely, that's because a lot\nof the cloud technologies like the vCloud\n\n348\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.380\nstuff that we've been talking\nabout is really taking that over.\n\n349\n00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.010\nAnd also, a lot of those features\nare actually integrated into, well,\n\n350\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:36.930\nthe operations manager that we see\nin vRealize as well as in the system\n\n351\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.470\nin the vSphere operations manager.\n\n352\n00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.190\nI'm starting to call it system\ncenter configuration manager,\n\n353\n00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.570\nI'm about to completely\ncross products here.\n\n354\n00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.029\n>> The guys from VMware\nare setting up a hit right now.\n\n355\n00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.868\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n356\n00:20:48.868 --> 00:20:51.496\nface palming me right on the screen.\n\n357\n00:20:51.496 --> 00:20:57.838\n[LAUGH] But yeah, those are some of the\ndifferent things that you actually do see.\n\n358\n00:20:57.838 --> 00:21:02.261\nSo you're not gonna see that\nparticular product any more.\n\n359\n00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:06.397\nJust kinda realize that product is now\nactually officially discontinued is what\n\n360\n00:21:06.397 --> 00:21:07.140\nyou'll see.\n\n361\n00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.716\nBut anything that we talked about\nhere inside the operation manager,\n\n362\n00:21:10.716 --> 00:21:14.896\ncould have also happened from a cloud\nservice perspective is what you'd actually\n\n363\n00:21:14.896 --> 00:21:15.943\nbe able to do there.\n\n364\n00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:18.859\nAs well as from your private\ndata center perspective too,\n\n365\n00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:22.680\ninstead of having to actually\nimplement another cloud appliance.\n\n366\n00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.332\n>> Yeah, Ronnie,\nit actually sounds like with the vRealize,\n\n367\n00:21:25.332 --> 00:21:28.348\nalmost like they are trying to\ncompete with things like Solar Winds,\n\n368\n00:21:28.348 --> 00:21:30.914\nSpice Works, and\nSystem Center Configuration Manager.\n\n369\n00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:33.572\nAnd they're saying, you know what,\nif you're gonna go VMWare,\n\n370\n00:21:33.572 --> 00:21:35.849\nyou might as well just if\nyou're gonna get your toes wet,\n\n371\n00:21:35.849 --> 00:21:38.130\nmight as well jump into the deep\nend of the pool, right?\n\n372\n00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.380\nLet us take care of all those systems for\n\n373\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.510\nyou using something you're\nalready familiar with.\n\n374\n00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.220\n>> I would assume that's your goal is to\nmarket the thing, the corner of the market\n\n375\n00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.460\nso that you don't have to actually\ndepend on those tools as well.\n\n376\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.520\nIt's kind of very neat, how well that\nthis stuff is integrated together and\n\n377\n00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.620\nexpands and works, not saying that\nthose other tools are bad and\n\n378\n00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.405\nI'm not gonna ever say that.\n\n379\n00:22:01.405 --> 00:22:02.530\nThey're great tools.\n\n380\n00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.410\nBut at the same time, vRealize says look,\nwe can really do this and\n\n381\n00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.640\nwe're actually designed to work with our\nother stuff that we've already done.\n\n382\n00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.220\nSo you don't have to actually implement\nmore agents, you don't have to do a lot\n\n383\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.020\nmore stuff and try to configure, open\nmore ports, we've already got them done.\n\n384\n00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.430\n>> Yeah, and if you're already\nfamiliarized, if you've already jumped in,\n\n385\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:22.830\nyou've got vSphere going on, and\nsay you've never used Solar Winds and\n\n386\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:27.170\nsay you've never used Spice Works\nas a change management software.\n\n387\n00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.370\nYou can say, well, I'm already kinda\nfamiliar with the way VMWare does things.\n\n388\n00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.380\nIt just makes sense that I would use their\nproduct and especially, if you like it,\n\n389\n00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.550\nyou're already acclimated\nto that whole environment,\n\n390\n00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.910\nso it could make a lot of sense for you.\n\n391\n00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:46.010\n>> It really probably end up will making a\nlot of sense because in that environment,\n\n392\n00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.740\nespecially if your environment\ncontinues to scale out and\n\n393\n00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.600\nscale up, this is probably one of the\neasier solutions to implement instead of\n\n394\n00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.950\ntrying to figure out what else needs to be\ndone so that I can use this product too.\n\n395\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.510\nNow, there's two other products that\nwe need to at least mention here.\n\n396\n00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:05.675\nYou're not gonna actually get too\nmuch into these products, but\n\n397\n00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:09.362\nthere's something they call EVO:RAIL and\nEVO:RACK.\n\n398\n00:23:09.362 --> 00:23:14.010\nSo, E-V-O and then, the word rail, okay,\nand then of course, the word rack.\n\n399\n00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:20.270\nThis is designed for medium to large\nbusinesses in terms of EVO:RACK.\n\n400\n00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.090\nNow when we start doing that, the way\nthat they actually have it termed here,\n\n401\n00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:28.244\nis that this is considered\na hyper converged infrastructure.\n\n402\n00:23:28.244 --> 00:23:33.010\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] Yeah, what in the world,\na hyper converged infrastructure?\n\n403\n00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.360\n>> How do you spell that Ronnie?\n\n404\n00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's kind of one of those unusual\n\n405\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.300\nthings but the idea here is that\nthey're saying what it goes\n\n406\n00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.160\nbeyond the idea of converging networks.\n\n407\n00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.893\nThat you can actually have a management\nsystem that is really designed,\n\n408\n00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:51.549\nokay, so that you can provision\napplications the way that you need to,\n\n409\n00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:55.056\nand services at the entire\ndata center level, okay?\n\n410\n00:23:55.056 --> 00:23:58.504\nSo a lot of times, you might actually\nhave an application that you go look,\n\n411\n00:23:58.504 --> 00:24:01.646\nevery time I run this VM, it doesn't\nwork the way that we need it to.\n\n412\n00:24:01.646 --> 00:24:05.602\nThey're saying that look, using something\nlike this You can essentially just\n\n413\n00:24:05.602 --> 00:24:09.100\nvirtualize that one application and\nthat way it doesn't matter.\n\n414\n00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.890\nYou know you put it in\nthe system that you want too and\n\n415\n00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.553\nit's not dependent on any one VM but\n\n416\n00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:18.400\nessentially creates kind of a master thing\nthat they do and they run it on their own.\n\n417\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.851\nIt allows you to actually have\nthat converged insfrastructure,\n\n418\n00:24:21.851 --> 00:24:25.850\nyou have part Cloud,\npart private data center, part everything.\n\n419\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.370\nYou still need to manage it and\nyou're actually starting to scale up and\n\n420\n00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.800\nscale out,\nthey recommend a solution like this, okay.\n\n421\n00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.700\nBut what if you have a ton of sites okay?\n\n422\n00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.460\nWhat if you have a ton of sites that you\nalso need to manage, that have even their\n\n423\n00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.330\nown little Virtual infrastructures\nin-between, then you go to EVO:RAIL, okay?\n\n424\n00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:47.140\nSo this is actually ideal, they say,\nfor remote offices, financial services,\n\n425\n00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.740\nfederal governments,\nhealthcare industries,\n\n426\n00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:54.220\nhigher education, insurance, oil and\ngas, and even retail centers,\n\n427\n00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.680\nwhere you have a lot of information\nthat needs to be converged again.\n\n428\n00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.430\nThis is the technology that brings the\nmanagement of all of those things together\n\n429\n00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.900\nfor you as well.\n\n430\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.640\nSo you add that on top\nyou can actually see\n\n431\n00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.018\nwhere VMware has really thought about\nsolutions for what for every scale.\n\n432\n00:25:09.018 --> 00:25:15.290\nFrom the small to medium business market\n\n433\n00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:20.880\nas well as going from that medium to\nlarge, and then going to government size.\n\n434\n00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.370\nThey wanna be\na virtualization provider and\n\n435\n00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.820\nthat's because that is their goal, right?\n\n436\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.499\nThey don't care you know whether\nyou're running Linux or Windows.\n\n437\n00:25:29.499 --> 00:25:32.600\nThey are not in that battle,\nthey don't want that at all.\n\n438\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.900\nThey don't care if your service\nprovider is this guy or that guy.\n\n439\n00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.190\nThey want to actually be that\ninfrastructure provider of VM,\n\n440\n00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.400\nvirtualized provider for everyone.\n\n441\n00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.400\nAnd they do this not only here, but\nthe reason why they're starting to do this\n\n442\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.763\nis because when you start\ngetting that evo-level scale,\n\n443\n00:25:50.763 --> 00:25:53.820\nyou end up working with\nwhat we call big data.\n\n444\n00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.020\nBig data is data that's so\nbig they had to put a term in front of it.\n\n445\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:25:59.770\n>> Big, they call it big.\n\n446\n00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:00.940\n>> They call it big.\n\n447\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.690\nAnd so when you start working with,\nlike Hadoop data and stuff like that.\n\n448\n00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.890\nThat's what they're talking about,\nso massive amounts of data.\n\n449\n00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.560\nSo you can see where government,\nretail and stuff like that.\n\n450\n00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.620\nThey're constantly actually interacting\nwith that data all the time.\n\n451\n00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.901\nWell, on a virtualizer,\nthat can get overwhelming,\n\n452\n00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:21.660\nbut here they're saying look they've\ngot the stuff, the skill to do that.\n\n453\n00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.436\nSo if your actually going that way and\nyou're starting to see\n\n454\n00:26:24.436 --> 00:26:27.590\nthat you're starting to use big data\nthat's where those evo products come in.\n\n455\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.750\nThe evolutionary products I think is what\nthey're gonna be termed in the future.\n\n456\n00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.280\nBut right now that's what they're\ncalled EVO RACK and EVO RAIL.\n\n457\n00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.547\nPretty much large to\nenterprise to government.\n\n458\n00:26:38.547 --> 00:26:41.179\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> No matter how large or small you are,\n\n459\n00:26:41.179 --> 00:26:43.750\nthe VMware, they have a solution-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.700\n>> That's right for you.\n\n461\n00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.480\nYou just have to check out\ntheir catalog of products and\n\n462\n00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.330\nyou will be amazed [LAUGH] at\nexactly what these things can do.\n\n463\n00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.550\nAnd you know what's awesome?\n\n464\n00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.810\nIs that even if you are a smaller shop,\nthey don't just say, well,\n\n465\n00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:59.510\nyou get this little feature here and this\nlittle feature there, and you're sitting\n\n466\n00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.540\nthere going, man, they're really nice if\nI got some of those big dog features.\n\n467\n00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.940\nYou're a small shop and\nyou have vSphere and if you jump in and\n\n468\n00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:12.080\nyou start using vRealize at all,\nyou have an amazing data center going on.\n\n469\n00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.940\nI don't care if you only\nhad 20 serves in the rack.\n\n470\n00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.530\nThis thing is a fine tune\nmachine that will be the envy\n\n471\n00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.120\nof all your tech buddies around\nthe water cooler or at lunch.\n\n472\n00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.700\nIt's a really sweet piece of machinery.\n\n473\n00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.300\n>> It really is.\n\n474\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.870\nAnd so all of those different\nproducts that are actually\n\n475\n00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.670\navailable out there, right.\n\n476\n00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.080\nThe goal is what?\n\n477\n00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.220\nIs it will scale to your need and\nto your benefit.\n\n478\n00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.900\nAnd if you're the one that's\nactually researching the products,\n\n479\n00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.740\nthese are the ones that you do need to\ntake a look at much more in depth than\n\n480\n00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.510\nwhat we've told you here.\n\n481\n00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:47.610\nBut at least now you've familiarized\nyourself with them a little bit.\n\n482\n00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.920\nIf you're actually the decision maker,\nunderstanding where these things scale to\n\n483\n00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.140\nis also your goal and\nthe names of these products.\n\n484\n00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.770\nA lot of times you might actually be\nthe decision maker even though you're kind\n\n485\n00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.670\nof the chief of the technological\nside of things.\n\n486\n00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.940\nThe very fact is it doesn't mean you\nknow every single product, okay?\n\n487\n00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.920\nSo VMWare wants to make it easy for\nyou to at least have the name of some of\n\n488\n00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.115\nthose products to say, hey, I understand\na little bit more about EVO RACK.\n\n489\n00:28:16.115 --> 00:28:19.140\nDaniel, can you help me\nfind out more information?\n\n490\n00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.160\nWell, instead of me going, Daniel?\n\n491\n00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.150\nLet's see.\n\n492\n00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.940\nWe're just gonna start working\nwith big data soon and we need to\n\n493\n00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.180\nactually be able to coordinating with\nmultiple sites when data comes in.\n\n494\n00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.930\nAnd now Daniel's like, okay there's like\n10000 solutions out there, which one?\n\n495\n00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.260\nHere it is,\nit's on the tip of tongue right?\n\n496\n00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.920\nAll of sudden I mentioned EVO RAIL and\nDaniels like okay, EVO RAIL [LAUGH].\n\n497\n00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.640\nThere we go.\n\n498\n00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.330\nHe starts actually researching it.\n\n499\n00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.600\nSo yes, you should know some of these\nproducts while you also get ready for\n\n500\n00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.650\nthe exam.\n\n501\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.290\nBecause well,\nthat's a big part of it, right?\n\n502\n00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.670\nIs knowing what product really is going\nto fit the situation that you're in.\n\n503\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:53.220\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n504\n00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.730\nWell, we covered a lot of ground today.\n\n505\n00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.280\nHopefully you guys have taken it in and\n\n506\n00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.080\nit's all becoming a part of your essence,\nso that when you sit in that\n\n507\n00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.690\nexam booth you are just ready to\nhammer out answers left and right.\n\n508\n00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.640\nAnd to have an answer for\nanybody that asks you about, maybe some\n\n509\n00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.020\nvirtual machines, VM Ware products,\nyou know that stuff well and cold.\n\n510\n00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.530\nRonnie thank you for joining us

00:00:08.203\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:12.046\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.681\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:19.637\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode, we are continuing through\n\n7\n00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:22.713\nour VCA6-DCV, boy that's an acronym,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n8\n00:00:22.713 --> 00:00:24.162\n&gt;&gt; And joining us in the studios today,\n\n9\n00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:25.621\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:26.564\nRonnie, how are you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:28.183\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, thanks for\n\n12\n00:00:28.183 --> 00:00:31.677\nhaving me back in the studio as we\ncontinue to take a look at some of\n\n13\n00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:36.470\nthe different things we definitely need\nto know since the exam has been updated.\n\n14\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.600\nWe're focusing in on that particular\nobjective area that we need to,\n\n15\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.210\nto make sure we get full and good solid\ncoverage over every single objective\n\n16\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.630\nthat you'll find in getting ready for\nthe VCA6 exam.\n\n17\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.380\nSo we want to jump right into this,\nas we get started here.\n\n18\n00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.140\nWhich of course means, we need to\nunderstand how to actually see and\n\n19\n00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.720\nhow to navigate around\ninside the V center itself.\n\n20\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.805\nSo in this particular episode, we're\ngoing to really do a high level overview,\n\n21\n00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:09.700\nso that we understand\nthe structure that we're seeing.\n\n22\n00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.910\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at my\nmachine which will help us to get started.\n\n23\n00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.850\nNow we're not really installing,\n\n24\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.413\nwe're not really doing a lot of\nconfiguration in the VCA itself.\n\n25\n00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:23.071\nIf you wanna learn more about that make\nsure you jump over to the VCP shows,\n\n26\n00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:27.480\nwhere you're actually be able to do all\nthe hands on configurations in there.\n\n27\n00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.320\nBut at this point, there's a couple\nof things I wanna show you as you\n\n28\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.510\nstart logging in, and then we'll login and\n\n29\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.142\ndo some other things that you need to\nbe able to understand where we connect.\n\n30\n00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:42.190\nAnd remember in 5.5 and 5.0,\n\n31\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.540\nyou're able to download the VMware client\nthat allowed you to directly connect\n\n32\n00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.570\nin to the actual ESX host itself, and\ndo a lot of the management there.\n\n33\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.366\nAs I started to move forward beginning\nwith VMware 6 actually 5.5 and 6.\n\n34\n00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:02.502\nThey started to moving away\nfrom the client itself and\n\n35\n00:02:02.502 --> 00:02:05.504\ninto what we call of course\nthe vSphere Web Client.\n\n36\n00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:08.750\nI just want to show you the name\nright here, that's actually key.\n\n37\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.020\nSo what is called the vSphere Client which\nof course is a stand alone product and\n\n38\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.960\nthen there's a vSphere Web Client itself.\n\n39\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.010\nThose are two different and distinct ways\nthat we are actually able to manage this.\n\n40\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.840\nWhen you start to actually have to do\nthings where you're configuring and\n\n41\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.182\nwhere you're managing inside of vSphere,\nfor\n\n42\n00:02:28.182 --> 00:02:30.716\nthe different virtual\nenvironment that you have.\n\n43\n00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:36.288\nYou always, at least in 6.0, want to make\nsure that you're on the web client and\n\n44\n00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:38.770\nnot on the actual client too, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.350\nThe other thing that you also need to know\nas we get here into this Single Sign-On\n\n46\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.000\nis that it does take a lot of requirements\nto make sure that vCenter is up and\n\n47\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.760\noperational.\n\n48\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.565\nSo when you try to install this,\nthere are a well pretty hefty hardware\n\n49\n00:02:56.565 --> 00:02:59.585\nrequirements that you\nhave to make sure of.\n\n50\n00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:03.014\nOne is that if you're going\nto build this on a machine,\n\n51\n00:03:03.014 --> 00:03:08.830\nyou wanna have a machine that's at least\nDual Core, which isn't super fancy today.\n\n52\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.930\nBut at the same time, it shows that\nyou can have a single core processor.\n\n53\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.600\nIdeally, they want you to actually run it\non a multi-processor, not just multiple\n\n54\n00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.360\ncores but multi-processors itself\nhave two distinctive sockets.\n\n55\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.100\nBut it doesn't have to be that way,\nI'm running mine in a virtual machine,\n\n56\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.390\nand I just gave it two\nvirtual processors itself.\n\n57\n00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.460\nThe other thing that normally is hefty\nof course is that on that machine,\n\n58\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.360\nyou need at least 20 gigs of\nfree space just the install of\n\n59\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.780\nthe web client itself as well\nas 9 gigs of ram at a minimum.\n\n60\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.640\nNow if your on the server environment\nwhere you have a server and\n\n61\n00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.730\nyou can do that, perfectly great.\n\n62\n00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.181\nBut on my little laptop,\n\n63\n00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:53.791\nthat takes up over half the RAM\nthat's actually on my laptop.\n\n64\n00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:58.225\nAnd I've got to actually consider those\nthings, if I'm gonna get started here.\n\n65\n00:03:58.225 --> 00:04:01.548\n&gt;&gt; You mentioned that Ronnie, I'm sitting\nhere thinking as you're mentioning those\n\n66\n00:04:01.548 --> 00:04:03.289\nprerequisites cuz I'm learning here too.\n\n67\n00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.345\nYou're talking about more than\nan entire operating system.\n\n68\n00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:10.402\nSo yeah, definitely looks like you have\nto plan this out a lot, I should say.\n\n69\n00:04:10.402 --> 00:04:11.018\n&gt;&gt; You really do.\n\n70\n00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:15.482\nIt's not something where you can just say,\nif you're using a virtual machine like\n\n71\n00:04:15.482 --> 00:04:19.498\nI am, I'm using VMware Fusion,\nthat you just accept all the defaults when\n\n72\n00:04:19.498 --> 00:04:23.392\nthey give you a configured machine\nto be able to install this.\n\n73\n00:04:23.392 --> 00:04:27.830\nYou wanna make sure that you have at\nleast like I said server 2008 or higher.\n\n74\n00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.940\nAnd you also find out something\nthat's completely frustrating which I\n\n75\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.990\nalso did when I started building this for\nthe show.\n\n76\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.962\nIs I said that's fine, I have a Windows\n10 client that I can use, and\n\n77\n00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:41.069\nshould be able to install\nthe vCenter Web Client right on.\n\n78\n00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.903\nIt says, no,\nI need a server operating system too.\n\n79\n00:04:43.903 --> 00:04:48.094\nSo it's one of those very weird things\nthat you might end up encountering as\n\n80\n00:04:48.094 --> 00:04:49.220\nyou do so.\n\n81\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.340\nNow, you can actually have\nLinux version of this as well.\n\n82\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.070\nBut you'll have to download that,\nof course, directly from VMware.\n\n83\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.200\nOnce everything is installed,\nit's gonna take a little bit of time.\n\n84\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.117\nBut then you're gonna see there's a couple\nof very key credentials that can give\n\n85\n00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:05.861\nyou access to what you need.\n\n86\n00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.767\nAnd that's why I wanted to start\nhere on this log on screen.\n\n87\n00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:12.470\nSo we go back and we take a look\nat the log on screen for a moment.\n\n88\n00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.180\nYou'll see over here,\nin the left hand side,\n\n89\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.694\nwhere as simple as User Name and Password.\n\n90\n00:05:17.694 --> 00:05:23.220\nRight as you finish the installation,\nyou need to pay attention right there.\n\n91\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.631\nBecause it gives you just a short set\nof notes that says, this is the log on.\n\n92\n00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:32.354\nIn other words, the user name that\nyou have to use if you want to get\n\n93\n00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:35.140\nthe features you're looking for.\n\n94\n00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.570\nIf not it will frustrate you to\nno end as you go, wait a minute,\n\n95\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.900\nmy machine is part of a domain,\nso I'll just use what?\n\n96\n00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.560\nMy domain credentials,\nthat's the way that we always log in.\n\n97\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.570\nBut if you didn't accept that, and\nit's not actually configured for that.\n\n98\n00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.710\nPutting your domain credentials\nin here will get you logged in.\n\n99\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.222\nBut it will show you nothing of\nwhat you need to be able to do.\n\n100\n00:05:58.222 --> 00:06:00.140\nIt'll be incredibly frustrating.\n\n101\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.103\n&gt;&gt; So would that be one of those things\nwhere you would get it installed, you'd\n\n102\n00:06:03.103 --> 00:06:06.081\nlock yourself out of it, and then you\nhave to turn and blow the machine away.\n\n103\n00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.304\nAnd then come back and\nreinstall everything,\n\n104\n00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:11.327\nif you don't pay close attention\nto those login credentials.\n\n105\n00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:14.135\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, you don't have to get\nthat far where you blow everything away.\n\n106\n00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:18.318\nBut you do have to pay attention because\nif you try every other domain credential\n\n107\n00:06:18.318 --> 00:06:22.323\nthat you have, you're gonna find out\nsomething, it's not going to work.\n\n108\n00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:25.178\nSo when you actually finish\nthe installation process,\n\n109\n00:06:25.178 --> 00:06:29.199\nit will tell you one by default, if you\njust left everything that's default.\n\n110\n00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:34.054\nIf you then change anything during\nthe install process here, you\n\n111\n00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:39.181\nneed to login as administrator@vsphere,\noops, if I can spell it.\n\n112\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.289\nVsphere.local, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:45.128\nAnd that is the key.\n\n114\n00:06:45.128 --> 00:06:48.409\nThe other thing,\nif you didn't change the actual user name,\n\n115\n00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.170\nis of course whatever password you set up.\n\n116\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.100\nAnd that is by far the only one\nthat you do have to worry about,\n\n117\n00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.000\ncuz you actually type this password in for\nwhatever it is you want.\n\n118\n00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.330\nNow before I hit login,\nI wanna show you one other option though,\n\n119\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.890\nwhich you will not see very\neasily especially on our screen.\n\n120\n00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.040\nBut it's down here in\nthe lower left hand corner,\n\n121\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.100\nwhere notice that right here, it says,\nDownload Client Integration Plugin.\n\n122\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:23.314\nNow that is very important, because most\nof the time inside of your business,\n\n123\n00:07:23.314 --> 00:07:28.549\nif you really do have in that machine,\nwhere it is a domain machine.\n\n124\n00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.001\nAnd they're saying, look,\n\n125\n00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:34.540\nwe don't really want you using the\ncredentials that you used to set up here.\n\n126\n00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.516\nWe want you using the domain credentials,\n\n127\n00:07:37.516 --> 00:07:41.081\nyou must download the client\nintegration plugin.\n\n128\n00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:43.761\nYour active directory has to be up and\nrunning,\n\n129\n00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:46.610\neverything has to be set up that way.\n\n130\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.460\nOnce you do that and you install it,\n\n131\n00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.450\nthen that is the only time\non this page right here,\n\n132\n00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.390\nwill you ever actually use your\ndomain credentials to login.\n\n133\n00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.610\nBut if you don't have that\ndownload client plugin.\n\n134\n00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.538\nOr if you're trying to log on and\nit doesn't accept your domain credentials,\n\n135\n00:08:06.538 --> 00:08:10.273\nthe reason probably is that\nyou don't have this actually,\n\n136\n00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:13.580\nthe plugin added in,\nin the way it needs to.\n\n137\n00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.790\nSo I didn't add it in, because I was like,\nthat's actually a good thing to show.\n\n138\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.960\nI'm gonna click Log On, and then it's\ngonna take a moment, and it should log on.\n\n139\n00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.475\nNow mine is actually asking me for\na different set of permissions as\n\n140\n00:08:25.475 --> 00:08:29.010\nwell cuz instead of choosing server 2008,\nI chose 2012.\n\n141\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.111\nAnd it's trying to open up an application\neven though it's the web client\n\n142\n00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:33.350\napplication.\n\n143\n00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.310\nSo this is what we'll\nnormally come to by default.\n\n144\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.440\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you know one of the things\nlooking at the title here,\n\n145\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.470\nit talks about virtual object status.\n\n146\n00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.900\nAnd I can say I always do this,\nI put the carriage in front of the horse,\n\n147\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.180\ninstead of the other way around.\n\n148\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.440\nRonnie, can you help us out with,\n\n149\n00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.740\nwhat are some the objects that we might\nsee inside of this interface here?\n\n150\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's very important that we\nunderstand those key terms right away.\n\n151\n00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.410\nThe idea of the virtual objects,\nitself, is key here.\n\n152\n00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.510\nAnd understand that there's\nan infrastructure that's involved.\n\n153\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.780\nSo unlike a physical infrastructure when\nyou go into a data farm where you have\n\n154\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.800\nrows of servers and different\nstorage devices that are out there.\n\n155\n00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.880\nRight here inside of vCenter,\nyou're literally managing objects.\n\n156\n00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.250\nThey're software, of course,\n\n157\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.860\nrepresentations of the objects\nthat you tend to see.\n\n158\n00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.070\nThe objects are located inside\nof this vCenter itself.\n\n159\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.490\nAnd you'll see that over\nhere on the left-hand side\n\n160\n00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.400\nthey have this bar here\nthat's called navigator.\n\n161\n00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.840\nNow we're gonna get into\nthat a little bit later on.\n\n162\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.380\nBut whatever's listed underneath\nthe navigator is essentially what we call,\n\n163\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.480\nof course, the objects themselves,\nor the virtual objects.\n\n164\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.490\nAnd you'll see that there's\na vCenter inventory list.\n\n165\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.630\nHosts and clusters, VM and\ntemplates, storage,\n\n166\n00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.380\nnetworking, policies and profiles.\n\n167\n00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.240\nYou continue on and you'll see\na bunch of different things that\n\n168\n00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.850\nyou actually will be able to access and\nbe able to see more details into.\n\n169\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.190\nAnd that is kinda the key of what you'll\nactually begin when you start talking\n\n170\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.480\nabout managing and navigating around.\n\n171\n00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.805\nSo that you actually understand what\nyou have access to when you start to\n\n172\n00:10:08.805 --> 00:10:11.350\ntake a look at the idea\nof vSphere as well.\n\n173\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.150\nSo on the left-hand side,\nthese are all considered objects.\n\n174\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.273\nOnce you select an object, such as Home,\nwhich is the one that it came up with by\n\n175\n00:10:19.273 --> 00:10:22.097\ndefault, you'll also have\nthis pane in the middle.\n\n176\n00:10:22.097 --> 00:10:27.650\nAnd you'll kind of see something,\nwhich is a little bit redundant, okay.\n\n177\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.826\nSo I selected Home and now you'll see that\nit actually opens up the home tab and\n\n178\n00:10:31.826 --> 00:10:33.827\na home pane right here in the middle.\n\n179\n00:10:33.827 --> 00:10:38.068\nBut now notice that underneath have\ninventory of these objects, and\n\n180\n00:10:38.068 --> 00:10:41.020\nif you take a look,\nyou'll see this matchup.\n\n181\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.570\nThe first one here,\nvCenter inventory list.\n\n182\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.980\nNotice over here on the left-hand side,\nvCenter inventory list.\n\n183\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.620\nHost and clusters, host and clusters.\n\n184\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.370\nVM and templates, VM templates.\n\n185\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.830\nEverybody's kinda seeing that redundancy\nthat's you're actually getting to there.\n\n186\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.580\nThat's why I didn't try to point out\nall the different objects itself\n\n187\n00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.639\nbecause you'll see the it's\nactually redundant.\n\n188\n00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:05.750\nAnd that is because this is setup in\na higher hierarchy structure, right.\n\n189\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.804\nWithin home essentially lies\neverything that you can control and\n\n190\n00:11:09.804 --> 00:11:12.265\nthat you have access to in the objects.\n\n191\n00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:14.793\nBut notice that they divided\nup into different categories.\n\n192\n00:11:14.793 --> 00:11:19.930\nInventories that is what you actually\nhave access to as far as assets go.\n\n193\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.210\nMonitoring, of course, is actually key,\nare you able to track things?\n\n194\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:29.360\nAnd of course, administration is down\nhere where we can assign permissions and\n\n195\n00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.010\nwe can see configuration,\nlicensing as well.\n\n196\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.340\nAnd of course, like every other software\nout there, they want you to be a part of\n\n197\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.030\nthat customer experience\nimprovement program, the CEIP.\n\n198\n00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.040\nYou'll see that in just about everything.\n\n199\n00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.600\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you mentioned right here at\nthe beginning that it's important to\n\n200\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.880\nunderstand virtual infrastructure objects.\n\n201\n00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.520\nHelp me out with that term, virtual.\n\n202\n00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.070\nIs it safe for me to say that,\nin a virtual object,\n\n203\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.280\nthat we can be looking at stuff that\ndoesn't necessarily have a physical\n\n204\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.670\nhardware associated with it that it's\nreally just related to software.\n\n205\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.930\nIs that what we're seeing when we\nthink about virtual infrastructure?\n\n206\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.480\n&gt;&gt; To the majority of it,\nas far as a management perspective,\n\n207\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.020\nas far administrating,\nan administration perspective, yes.\n\n208\n00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.178\nCan there be underlying hardware still\nactually hosting that information and\n\n209\n00:12:13.178 --> 00:12:13.876\nthat stuff?\n\n210\n00:12:13.876 --> 00:12:18.530\nYes, but the way that you and I manage\nit is through a virtual infrastructure.\n\n211\n00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:23.520\nSo we don't have to go physically from\none location to another location.\n\n212\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:29.100\nTo get access to the ESXi host,\nif we don't really need to.\n\n213\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.760\nWe should be able to manage everything\nfrom right here if we actually choose to\n\n214\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.810\ndo something like this, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.370\nSo let's take a look at a couple\nof things at the very beginning.\n\n216\n00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.290\nWhen we start to take a look and\nwhen you first log in,\n\n217\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.660\nyou'll probably notice,\nlike what I have is up here at the top.\n\n218\n00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.350\nThere's gonna be some\nstatus indicators for us.\n\n219\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.880\nAnd this is kind of a big one right here\n\n220\n00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:55.040\nbecause it does actually really\nget you to notice something.\n\n221\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.390\nThere are these vCenter service\nsystems with expired or\n\n222\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.750\nexpiring licensing in your inventory.\n\n223\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.740\nSo we can manage our licenses right here.\n\n224\n00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.630\nNow this is important, inside of a lab\nenviroment, remember that you can go into\n\n225\n00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.250\nyou can go to VMware itself, and\nyou can download these trial versions.\n\n226\n00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.850\nAnd the trial versions\nare usually 30 to 90 days, or\n\n227\n00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.190\n60 days I can't remember which one I\nshould know, but I think it's 60 days.\n\n228\n00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:27.310\nIt is what you'll normally get access to\nand that's what I have access to here.\n\n229\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.790\nSo when you do something like this\nwhere you're installing vCenter,\n\n230\n00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.550\nyou'll need a license for it.\n\n231\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:38.186\nWhen you're installing ESXi, good luck in\nme saying that right two times in a row,\n\n232\n00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:42.390\nwhen you do that you'll also\nneed licensing for that as well.\n\n233\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:47.110\nAnd that will also need to be applied\nto those individual things too.\n\n234\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:52.510\nThe great thing is right here inside of\nvSphere it's telling you right away that,\n\n235\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:58.480\nif you want to have access to do anything,\nit has to be given with the licensing.\n\n236\n00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.440\nSo how in the world do we take\ncare of licensing and this key,\n\n237\n00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.120\nmake sure you know this.\n\n238\n00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.040\nIf you need to implement licensing and\n\n239\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.080\nwhat if you go, alright Ronnie,\nI read that but I click on this.\n\n240\n00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.655\nThere was a little link that said manage\nyour license that would directly take you\n\n241\n00:14:14.655 --> 00:14:16.347\nexactly where you need to go.\n\n242\n00:14:16.347 --> 00:14:20.191\nBut on exams you learn\nthere's never an easy path.\n\n243\n00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:24.154\nThey want to know if you have\nbeen in the actual software or\n\n244\n00:14:24.154 --> 00:14:27.390\nyou just kind of gone no,\nI memorized this.\n\n245\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.600\nI know, I'll just click on\nthe yellow bar and hit manage,\n\n246\n00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.190\nand we're off and ready to go.\n\n247\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.060\n&gt;&gt; So your advice maybe to anybody that\nmay be sitting this exam is you might know\n\n248\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.530\nfive different ways that you\nabsolutely love to get to this.\n\n249\n00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.430\nBut also know a couple of\nthe scenic approaches which aren't\n\n250\n00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.170\nnecessarily the shortest paths, right?.\n\n251\n00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the key is what?\n\n252\n00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:49.470\nSpending time in the software,\nso if you haven't tried to\n\n253\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.550\ndownload the versions before it,\nor the trial editions.\n\n254\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.230\nIt means you really have to take a little\nbit of time in getting hands-on.\n\n255\n00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.920\nIt doesn't mean you have\nto do it all at one time,\n\n256\n00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.910\nyou can do a little bit at a time.\n\n257\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.310\nInside of VMware learning itself,\n\n258\n00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.228\nyou'll probably see that they have\nlabs that are available for you.\n\n259\n00:15:06.228 --> 00:15:09.840\nSo you may have to download those,\ngo and spend time in those labs.\n\n260\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.970\nAnd make sure you know were\ncertain things are to do this.\n\n261\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.023\nSo that's what we wanna point out, all\nright, so let's get back to the licensing.\n\n262\n00:15:16.023 --> 00:15:18.832\nOkay cuz if not I'll ramble on forever and\never.\n\n263\n00:15:18.832 --> 00:15:22.592\nSo over here on the left-hand side,\nin the navigator,\n\n264\n00:15:22.592 --> 00:15:25.740\nI'm gonna scroll down to Administration.\n\n265\n00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.750\nNow remember that this is not the only\nplace were you can do this, but\n\n266\n00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.970\nthis is kinda the most visual place.\n\n267\n00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:35.558\nIf I select administration, I'll see\non the left-hand side as well another\n\n268\n00:15:35.558 --> 00:15:38.510\nobject that is called, Licenses here.\n\n269\n00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.300\nNow let me show you, once again, so that\nyou know that you have to actually know\n\n270\n00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.470\nwhere things are cuz they're not\ngonna tell you where things are.\n\n271\n00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.900\nYou can also appear on this blue bar next\nto where it says vSphere web client.\n\n272\n00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.510\nClick on this little house with\nthe little hamburger button that you see.\n\n273\n00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.097\nScroll down and\nselect Administration as well, and\n\n274\n00:15:56.097 --> 00:15:57.990\nthat will bring you to the same place.\n\n275\n00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.630\nBut notice there are different options for\nyou that's available.\n\n276\n00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.890\nFrom that point, you want to\nselect where it says licensing.\n\n277\n00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.510\nAnd this is what we want is right\nhere where it says getting started.\n\n278\n00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.220\nNow it's gonna tell you of course,\nand should you read through this?\n\n279\n00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.785\nAbsolutely, so you're gonna take the time\nof course as you go back through.\n\n280\n00:16:17.785 --> 00:16:21.599\nRead through this so that you understand\nwhat it is about license management here.\n\n281\n00:16:21.599 --> 00:16:24.070\nAnd all the things that you\nhave to actually be able to do.\n\n282\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.360\nAnd then I'm gonna click\non the licensing here, or\n\n283\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.110\nI'm gonna kind of,\nI know I didn't hide it very well.\n\n284\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.940\nBut I'm gonna kinda hide\nthose license keys for\n\n285\n00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.330\nright now as well and\nwe'll see what we can do to help us out.\n\n286\n00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.890\nNow when you start to do this, okay?\n\n287\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.420\nYou can actually use, and\nlet me just zoom in so you can see.\n\n288\n00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.344\nI went ahead and\nI installed two different licenses.\n\n289\n00:16:47.344 --> 00:16:50.528\nOne, of course, for\nmy vSphere vCenter here.\n\n290\n00:16:50.528 --> 00:16:52.248\nOkay, with the operations management.\n\n291\n00:16:52.248 --> 00:16:56.570\nAnd other one is for the hypervisor\nthat I'm running right here, okay?\n\n292\n00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.500\nSo both of those licenses\nhave actually been installed.\n\n293\n00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.520\nThe way that you would do that is you\nwould click on the plus sign, and\n\n294\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.030\nthen you'd enter the license keys.\n\n295\n00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.500\nThese license keys of course\ncome from VM ware so go and\n\n296\n00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.880\nget your license key,\nyou paste them in here.\n\n297\n00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.080\nAnd once you do that, you click Next,\nand you follow along.\n\n298\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.910\nAnd it will ask you if you want to\nrename them, and that's what I did here.\n\n299\n00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.160\nIs the original license\nwere named exactly,\n\n300\n00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.330\nactually on line two it was\nthe product that was named that.\n\n301\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.010\nAnd then I just copied that\nname over here to the license.\n\n302\n00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.660\nIt had a weird, funny name to it, and\nI can't remember what the actual,\n\n303\n00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.880\noriginal one was but\nyou can actually see that.\n\n304\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.390\nI didn't like whatever the name was, so\nI actually went ahead and renamed them.\n\n305\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.490\nAnd then they get installed here, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.530\nNow the other thing is\nduring your trial period\n\n307\n00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.000\nhis is where you need to\npay attention as well.\n\n308\n00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.280\nIf you have an evaluation license which\nyou;ll see on certain objects when we get\n\n309\n00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.970\nto them in a later episode,\nmake sure that if you're doing is for\n\n310\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.950\nan evaluation you choose\nthe evaluation itself, okay?\n\n311\n00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.627\nAnd that's actually gonna be key.\n\n312\n00:18:04.627 --> 00:18:09.652\nThe reason why that if you actually\nenter in the real licenses like what\n\n313\n00:18:09.652 --> 00:18:15.188\nI have here into the actual system,\nit's great, as long as they are actually\n\n314\n00:18:15.188 --> 00:18:20.915\nthe licenses that are really for that\nversion and that you've purchased them.\n\n315\n00:18:20.915 --> 00:18:22.401\nIf you've only gotten free ones,\n\n316\n00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:25.798\nyou're gonna find out something that\nthey won't let you register anything.\n\n317\n00:18:25.798 --> 00:18:29.830\nAnd even though you'll be able to get\nthem installed they won't fully function\n\n318\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.910\nthe way that you want to.\n\n319\n00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.220\nSo if you have that option when you go and\nyou now take\n\n320\n00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.810\nthese licenses that we now made the\ncenter, kind of know that they're there.\n\n321\n00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.540\nNow we had to assign those\nlicenses to different\n\n322\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.900\nobjects as what we would have to do.\n\n323\n00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.160\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, is it safe to safe\nthat the in the web client here,\n\n324\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.010\nwe have not that we have access to it,\nit has full functionality but\n\n325\n00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.040\nit was a reduced function set based on\nwhatever your tiered license model is.\n\n326\n00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you end up seeing that\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n327\n00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.690\nThe very fact is that you'll have\nan enterprise and enterprise plus.\n\n328\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.340\nAnd then there's an essentials,\n\n329\n00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.130\nthere's certain different ones that give\nyou more features that are available.\n\n330\n00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.220\nYou name it, there's a lot of\ndifferent things going on here, okay?\n\n331\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.640\nNow if I select the actions here I\nactually see some of the features.\n\n332\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.700\nWe're not gonna get that far into it for\nright now but the other thing of course is\n\n333\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.370\nthat they try to make sure that it\nwas easy for you to get around.\n\n334\n00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:32.600\nSo now that I have licences,\nI can have the different products here but\n\n335\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.060\nnotice that there are assets and\nthis is key.\n\n336\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.300\nWhen I need to assign the licences,\n\n337\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.780\nI need to come over here to this\naccess to the, I'm not gonna say.\n\n338\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.288\nAsset, [LAUGH] I'd better say it right.\n\n339\n00:19:46.288 --> 00:19:52.940\nAsset and then I can right-click and\nI can assign the license that I need.\n\n340\n00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.170\nLet me click on this for a moment so\nthat you see what's going on here.\n\n341\n00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.650\nNow I went ahead and selected this\nlicense, which is actually the evaluation\n\n342\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.170\nlicense, cuz I know that I'm\nunderneath this evaluation period here.\n\n343\n00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.430\nI don't wanna install the real license and\nthis is key.\n\n344\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.710\nThis is what will give you that ability to\nhave all of the features that you need for\n\n345\n00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.390\nevaluation.\n\n346\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.520\nAnd it even tells you that if you\nselect the evaluation that's fine.\n\n347\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.140\nBut you can actually select different\nlicences to replace whatever\n\n348\n00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.400\nthe current one is if you need to.\n\n349\n00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.270\nSo it's here, if I click the plus sign.\n\n350\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.612\nOops, it's saying I can add\nin a new one if I want to.\n\n351\n00:20:24.612 --> 00:20:27.310\nI wanna cancel that MAC out and get there.\n\n352\n00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:31.110\nSo you'll need to make\nsure that you do that.\n\n353\n00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.300\nAlways choose the evaluation\nlicense if your just evaluating.\n\n354\n00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.800\nDon't take a regular key and\ndo that because you might find yourself\n\n355\n00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.950\nlimited more than you know in a real\nsituation if your doing this for\n\n356\n00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.210\nproduction unless you really\nare limited that one.\n\n357\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.490\nBut the other thing is you\ndon't have to go and search for\n\n358\n00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.790\neverything everywhere else.\n\n359\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.918\nOn the licence things right now,\neverything that actually needs a licence\n\n360\n00:20:54.918 --> 00:20:58.090\nis also listed in these\nbuttons right here.\n\n361\n00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.890\nSo that's were they tried make\nthe related objects that appear.\n\n362\n00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.530\nVery easy for you instead of you\ngoing back to the navigator and\n\n363\n00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.350\ntrying to figure out which\none you have available.\n\n364\n00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:13.340\nSo if I select host here for\nthe VM ware host.\n\n365\n00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:18.190\nSo here is the one that you see\nright here where is my ESX server,\n\n366\n00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.200\nnote it says evaluation mode.\n\n367\n00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.700\nNow if I go ahead and select all, and\n\n368\n00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.820\nagain you still see the same\nidea of the licensing there too.\n\n369\n00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.650\nNow we're gonna be doing some of this\nlicensing in a little bit cuz I have\n\n370\n00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:35.430\nanother ESX server that we're\ngoing to actually install some\n\n371\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.368\noperating systems on.\n\n372\n00:21:36.368 --> 00:21:38.830\nSo I'm gonna wait for us to do that, but\n\n373\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:43.490\nI just wanted to show you where you would\ngo and do things like that as well.\n\n374\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.350\nAll right, a couple of other\nthings that we need to point out.\n\n375\n00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:53.310\nEvery once in a while, you're gonna\nsee that on just about everything,\n\n376\n00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.830\nthis should be, I hate to be cliche,\nalarming, right?\n\n377\n00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.420\nSo whenever something is going wrong and\n\n378\n00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.140\nstarting to show up,\nstarting to do things.\n\n379\n00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.260\nYou will get different visual types\nof indicators that will actually\n\n380\n00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.340\nshow us where something is happening\nthat's actually going to be wrong.\n\n381\n00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.070\nSo if you're in the middle of a process\nthat you have not yet completed,\n\n382\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:19.000\nit will first show up\nunder Work In Progress.\n\n383\n00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.470\nThe great thing is, if you're doing\nthis to install in a new data center or\n\n384\n00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.100\nwhatever it might be and\nyou got distracted.\n\n385\n00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.860\nYou'll take a look here and\nit will show you right there, whether or\n\n386\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.660\nnot that's actually happened.\n\n387\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.610\nIf your machine has lost power,\nfor one reason or another.\n\n388\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.820\nPower is actually a fairly common one,\nas people plug and unplug things, or\n\n389\n00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.060\nnetwork cables they got,\nyou'll end up getting\n\n390\n00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:46.410\ndifferent alarms that will pop up and\nthey will show up over here as well.\n\n391\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.410\nSo even at the middle of working just when\nlicensing of things like that happened\n\n392\n00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.730\nthat's where you'll end up seeing them to,\nokay?\n\n393\n00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:59.020\nAll right, so just a couple of\nones that we want to see to.\n\n394\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.760\nNow also on the objects themselves,\n\n395\n00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:07.500\nyou'll see little indicators like\nthis to where there's a help buttons.\n\n396\n00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.837\nAnd if something is really going wrong,\n\n397\n00:23:09.837 --> 00:23:14.659\nyou'll also see that on the asset itself\nyou'll have little colored indicators.\n\n398\n00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:18.176\nRed, green, yellow, stuff like that,\nthat will kind of show you like, hey,\n\n399\n00:23:18.176 --> 00:23:21.120\nyou might need to take care\nof something like this, too.\n\n400\n00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.660\n&gt;&gt; So when you log in,\nyou might have some, as if to say, Ronnie,\n\n401\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.220\nyou might have some of these\nstatus indicators that are more\n\n402\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.120\nglobal torture like licensing affects\nyour whole entire VM ware infrastructure.\n\n403\n00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.810\nOr you can also have some that are just\nfor a specific asset in general.\n\n404\n00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.330\nLike you said, I come in here,\n\n405\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.260\nI think of in the Windows\nworld we have device manager.\n\n406\n00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.330\nSomething isn't working in your hardware,\nyou get a little exclamation point.\n\n407\n00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.450\nSo point being in question that would be\nthey also have individual statuses for\n\n408\n00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.280\nthe objects that are inside\nof the web client as well.\n\n409\n00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah that's pretty much a great\nway to summarize what we're seeing here.\n\n410\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:57.042\nSo the key for us at this point, right,\nis having a very high level overview so\n\n411\n00:23:57.042 --> 00:23:59.620\nthat we know exactly\nwhat we're looking at.\n\n412\n00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.573\nAnd that over here on left-hand side,\nthese are gonna be our different objects.\n\n413\n00:24:03.573 --> 00:24:08.176\nAnd within each object they try and\nmake it easier for us.\n\n414\n00:24:08.176 --> 00:24:11.857\nAnd the one for the licensing didn't\nreally actually list it this way, but\n\n415\n00:24:11.857 --> 00:24:14.100\nyou can see like related objects.\n\n416\n00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.640\nSo here I just chose the actual\ndata center itself, or\n\n417\n00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.410\nthe, actually it's the vCenter itself.\n\n418\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.230\nBut if I click on itprotvdemo, which is\nthe data center that I have available.\n\n419\n00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.126\nYou can now also see that if\nI'm doing some actions and\n\n420\n00:24:29.126 --> 00:24:32.354\nI need to know if I actually\nfinished all my actions for that.\n\n421\n00:24:32.354 --> 00:24:36.680\nI can go in and\nfind the actual hierarchical breakdown.\n\n422\n00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:42.510\nTop load in different clusters, if I have\nmultiple vCenter or ESX Host together,\n\n423\n00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:47.010\nthe actual individual host itself,\nvirtual machines, templates, vApps,\n\n424\n00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:52.260\ndata storage, data clusters, and the list\ncontinue on and on all the way down.\n\n425\n00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.890\nSo I need to verify that I've\nactual configured everything,\n\n426\n00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:59.300\nyou can actually see all that\ninformation Even at the very beginning.\n\n427\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.652\nAnd this center actually makes it easy to.\n\n428\n00:25:02.652 --> 00:25:07.300\nLet me go back up here to the data\ncenter and home for a moment.\n\n429\n00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:15.240\nIf I select vCenter inventory list and\nvCenter servers in getting started.\n\n430\n00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.090\nIf you're not sure where to get started,\nthis is the best place to go,\n\n431\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.270\nit's right here.\n\n432\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.030\nIt tells you what exactly you need to do,\nand when I scroll down,\n\n433\n00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.720\nit will actually go ahead,\n\n434\n00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.750\ngive it a moment as my machine is kind\nof timing out here for just a moment.\n\n435\n00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.120\nIt will go ahead and describe everything\nthat you need to make sure that you get\n\n436\n00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.130\ndone in a timely fashion as well.\n\n437\n00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.000\nAnd then of course all these\ndifferent objects that you see.\n\n438\n00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.090\nIf they're relatable, you'll also, of\ncourse, have action buttons that will show\n\n439\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.240\nyou some of the other things you\nmight need to go ahead and set to.\n\n440\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.990\nAt the very beginning,\nyou should have access to a, one of these,\n\n441\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.266\nwhich is of course your vCenter.\n\n442\n00:25:56.266 --> 00:25:57.430\nIf you get to this point,\n\n443\n00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.311\nwhere you go to vCenter, and it's telling\nyou don't have permission to see it, or\n\n444\n00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:05.720\nyou can't actually connect to the vCenter,\neven though you're logged in to it.\n\n445\n00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.430\nMore than likely, you used the wrong\ncredentials, is pretty much the key here.\n\n446\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:14.453\nSo once you have that, at that point,\nyou would then go in and\n\n447\n00:26:14.453 --> 00:26:21.266\nyou would also create a data center that\nwould exist on top of that vCenter server.\n\n448\n00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:25.309\nAnd then once you have that data center,\nthen you can start creating VM,\n\n449\n00:26:25.309 --> 00:26:27.880\nVM's themselves or virtual machines.\n\n450\n00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.960\nThat will also be inside that data center,\nwhich will now be riding on top,\n\n451\n00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.900\nof course, of the vCenter,\nthe data center, excuse me,\n\n452\n00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.300\ndata center and then on top,\nof course, the vCenter.\n\n453\n00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:43.160\nSo that hierarchy is key in\nwhat we're trying to explore.\n\n454\n00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.510\nBut take time and go through.\n\n455\n00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.932\nYou don't have to learn\neverything right away, but\n\n456\n00:26:48.932 --> 00:26:50.704\nyou do need to know where objects are.\n\n457\n00:26:50.704 --> 00:26:55.145\nAs things are actually going to\nget much more complex as you begin\n\n458\n00:26:55.145 --> 00:26:57.560\nthe configuration of these.\n\n459\n00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.900\nBut make sure you pay attention to some\nof the indicators, red normally means,\n\n460\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.670\nof course,\nsomething needs to be taken care of.\n\n461\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.320\nAnd yellow usually means that\nthere's a warning that may happen.\n\n462\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.681\nAnd then of course, overall green,\nif anything, or if there's nothing at all,\n\n463\n00:27:11.681 --> 00:27:13.971\nprobably means everything is going fine.\n\n464\n00:27:13.971 --> 00:27:16.505\nAnd you'll probably end up\nseeing that more often than not,\n\n465\n00:27:16.505 --> 00:27:19.400\nsince everything is pretty\nmuch rock solid at this point.\n\n466\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.930\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, will you find some actions, as\nrelated to a condition maybe you've seen,\n\n467\n00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.480\nthat might be specific to a device.\n\n468\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.551\nWhere maybe it's not something that can\nbe done to every device where it's,\n\n469\n00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:31.757\nI guess you would say contact sensitive.\n\n470\n00:27:31.757 --> 00:27:34.267\nIf I'm clicking on a server\nversus a data store,\n\n471\n00:27:34.267 --> 00:27:38.850\nthat there'll be different actions applied\nto whatever the device is in question.\n\n472\n00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're definitely gonna see that.\n\n473\n00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.630\nAnd the way that you find that out, let's\ngo ahead and show you right here too.\n\n474\n00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:47.010\nSo I'm glad that Wes reminded me that,\ncuz I was about to forget here.\n\n475\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.160\nI'm gonna use this little home\nbutton instead to navigate.\n\n476\n00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.150\nAnd of course there is events.\n\n477\n00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.520\nAnd if I select on the event console,\nlet's see if anything comes up here.\n\n478\n00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.920\nThere we go.\nSo here, of course, are different events.\n\n479\n00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.370\nAnd look at that,\nI lost network connectivity, and\n\n480\n00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.308\nit showed up as an error.\n\n481\n00:28:04.308 --> 00:28:04.850\nMaybe.\n\n482\n00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.650\nLet me see if I can scroll.\n\n483\n00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:10.430\nSo you can even see that it will kind\nof show up the information right here.\n\n484\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.760\nAnd it tells you, fairly descriptively,\n\n485\n00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:18.370\nlost connectivity on the virtual\nswitch vSwitch0, Physical NIC is down.\n\n486\n00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.773\nDear, so.\n\n487\n00:28:19.773 --> 00:28:23.477\nYou can see where something like that\nhappened, and that's cuz I unplugged and\n\n488\n00:28:23.477 --> 00:28:25.540\nmoved is what happened there.\n\n489\n00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.390\nBut as you start to actually\nscroll through this information,\n\n490\n00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:29.340\nyou'll see there's other ones.\n\n491\n00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.259\nSo here's a health status change.\n\n492\n00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.810\nAnd the health of your\nvCenter is very important.\n\n493\n00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.700\nIs everything configured\nthe way that needs to?\n\n494\n00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.943\nAre there certain tasks that are undone?\n\n495\n00:28:39.943 --> 00:28:42.290\nAre there certain things\nthat need to be configured?\n\n496\n00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:46.110\nThis particular health status was when\nI was installing the actual licensing\n\n497\n00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.600\nitself, on certain things.\n\n498\n00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:53.990\nSo you can see also here an alarm change,\nlet's see if I can scroll in there.\n\n499\n00:28:53.990 --> 00:29:00.452\nHealth status changed alarm on data\ncenters triggered by that 2068 which.\n\n500\n00:29:00.452 --> 00:29:02.710\nBe sure the client's status\nchanged from yellow to green.\n\n501\n00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.660\nSo it is actually going through\nas I was rebooting the server.\n\n502\n00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.530\nIt was in yellow and\nthen it went to green.\n\n503\n00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.820\nAnd a lot of times that's what you'll get.\n\n504\n00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.560\nYou'll get messages that come up that\ntells you that something isn't started.\n\n505\n00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.267\nAnd all you have to do is go back in and\nrestart the services too.\n\n506\n00:29:18.267 --> 00:29:21.997\nSo there's a lot more for\nto learn, but all that stuff and\n\n507\n00:29:21.997 --> 00:29:27.370\nconfiguration is gonna come in the VCP6,\ninstead of the VCA at this point.\n\n508\n00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:31.256\nBut getting around at least a high\nlevel over view, is gonna be the key.\n\n509\n00:29:31.256 --> 00:29:34.620\nWe're gonna ask you to dive a little\ndeeper into it in another episode.\n\n510\n00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.140\nBut at this point, just a very,\n\n511\n00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.950\nvery high level overview is\nwhat we're actually doing.\n\n512\n00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:43.930\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, we appreciate you being here\nand letting us know and explaining to us\n\n513\n00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.542\nthose virtualized objects,\nalmost said virtualization objects.\n\n514\n00:29:47.542 --> 00:29:48.760\nBut we, looking at the time clock,\n\n515\n00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.880\ndoes look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode.\n\n516\n00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.840\nBut I know I wouldn't be doing our viewers\nany justice if I didn't give you a chance.\n\n517\n00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.910\nDo you have additional words that you\nmight wanna throw in this episode?\n\n518\n00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.138\n&gt;&gt; Well the key, again, is what?\n\n519\n00:29:59.138 --> 00:30:03.426\nHands on, making sure you feel comfortable\nin navigating around the client and\n\n520\n00:30:03.426 --> 00:30:08.040\nunderstanding where things are located\nwhen getting ready for the exam.\n\n521\n00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.260\nYou can not do this blindfolded by just\nthinking that you can learn the concept,\n\n522\n00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.510\njust by knowing what the things are.\n\n523\n00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.331\nEven though this exam is really\nknowledge based, they still expect for\n\n524\n00:30:18.331 --> 00:30:21.909\nyou to at least have seen it, and\nunderstand what you are working.\n\n525\n00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:24.249\nAnd then feel comfortable\nin navigating around it,\n\n526\n00:30:24.249 --> 00:30:28.200\nwhich is why we're gonna spend a little\nbit more time in navigation, as well.\n\n527\n00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.833\nBut at this point,\nknow about those different indicators,\n\n528\n00:30:31.833 --> 00:30:33.694\nknow what a virtual object is.\n\n529\n00:30:33.694 --> 00:30:36.150\nDo you have to memorize objects?\n\n530\n00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.770\nIt's not going to hurt you any, but\n\n531\n00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.610\nyou probably don't have\nto go into that detail.\n\n532\n00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.525\nBut just kind of realize\nof where you're going, and\n\n533\n00:30:41.525 --> 00:30:43.011\nwhat you're actually managing there.\n\n534\n00:30:43.011 --> 00:30:47.105\nAnd that idea of the hierarchy, where all\nthe objects are pretty much together and\n\n535\n00:30:47.105 --> 00:30:50.140\nthat you can see a lot of\nvisual indicators right here.\n\n536\n00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.451\nThey tried to make it much\nmore user friendly in that.\n\n537\n00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:54.180\nBut hands on is the key.\n\n538\n00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:58.583\nSo download your particular copy, or\nuse some of the online labs that you might\n\n539\n00:30:58.583 --> 00:31:01.130\nfind right there inside\nof VMwares website.\n\n540\n00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.993\nAnd make sure you go ahead,\n\n541\n00:31:02.993 --> 00:31:07.392\nand that you are actually able to\nget in there, and play around.\n\n542\n00:31:07.392 --> 00:31:07.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie,\n\n543\n00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.490\nas always we appreciate you in the studios\nwith us lending your expertise.\n\n544\n00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.520\nAnd we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n545\n00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.500\nStick around,\ncuz we do have more of the VCA6 coming up.\n\n546\n00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.260\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n547\n00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n548\n00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.504\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n549\n00:31:23.879 --> 00:31:29.602\n[MUSIC]\n\n550\n00:31:29.602 --> 00:31:32.980\nThank you for

00:00:08.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.155\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:17.225\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode here\nat ITProTV, I'm your host, Wes Bryant,\n\n6\n00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:22.163\nand in today's episode we're coming\nback at you with more of the VCA6-DCV.\n\n7\n00:00:22.163 --> 00:00:25.035\nAnd joining us in the studios for\nthis endeavor is none other than Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:25.637\nRonnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:26.735\nRonnie, how you doing, sir?\n\n10\n00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:30.568\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, thank you for having\nme back, as we continue to take a look at\n\n11\n00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:34.600\nmore of, well,\nlearning about V-center vSphere itself.\n\n12\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.550\nWe need to make sure especially\nin his episode that we\n\n13\n00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.290\nnavigate around a little bit more,\nget a little more in depth.\n\n14\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.840\nAs you watched the previous update\nshow that we did it was really\n\n15\n00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.795\nkind of the highest level\noverview that we could do.\n\n16\n00:00:46.795 --> 00:00:50.550\nBut we did hit on some important facts\nthat we're not gonna see inside of\n\n17\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.370\nthe navigation interface.\n\n18\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.340\nBut now we're going to jump in and\nwe gonna show you some of\n\n19\n00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.971\nthings you need to be able to get\naround and of course be able to do and\n\n20\n00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:06.360\nunderstand what it is that you can\ncontrol inside of vSphear 6 as well.\n\n21\n00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.959\nSo that is what we are actually going\nto start it off with when we start to\n\n22\n00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:10.633\ntake a look.\n\n23\n00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:15.815\nRemember that once you log in using, of\ncourse, vSphere, you wanna make sure that\n\n24\n00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:20.942\nyou have that proper login, which is\ngonna be administrator@vsphere.local.\n\n25\n00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:25.322\nOr if you have the client integration\ntools downloaded and installed,\n\n26\n00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:29.290\nthen you can use your domain\ncredentials to log in instead.\n\n27\n00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.020\nWe're gonna see that in another\nepisode but at this point here,\n\n28\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.800\nwe're just using the credentials that\nwe created when we first installed,\n\n29\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.280\nof course, the web client interface.\n\n30\n00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.570\nSo let's go ahead and jump in and\nsee what we are, we should be fairly\n\n31\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.260\nfamiliar with and fairly comfortable\nas we enter into the exam as well.\n\n32\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.790\n&gt;&gt; You know Ronnie, one of the episodes\nthat I was in with you, you were kind of\n\n33\n00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.040\nlooking at the overall interface and the\nfirst thing I noticed by the interface,\n\n34\n00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.920\nand probably one of the first things that\nyou'll notice when you get a successful\n\n35\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.980\nlogin is that there are a series\nof boxes across this interface.\n\n36\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.870\nCan you help us out with those different\nboxes, kind of show us around and\n\n37\n00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.930\nwhat's going on there?\n\n38\n00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, as we start to take a look\nin getting familiar with the navigation,\n\n39\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.060\nit's always great to take\nthat high level overview,\n\n40\n00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.530\nand to understand what's going on, so\nthat way we can talk about it as well.\n\n41\n00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.100\nSo let's take a look on my screen,\nthat will help us out.\n\n42\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.130\nSo when we start to see\nwhat Wes is referring to,\n\n43\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.510\nis that we see these kind of\nlittle boxy objects and shapes.\n\n44\n00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.860\nThere of course is navigator and\n\n45\n00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.200\nthen we have this center pane\nthat we generally see right here.\n\n46\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.300\nAnd we have alarms, and\n\n47\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.650\ndown at the bottom they kind of\ntuck it away is also called tasks.\n\n48\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.570\nSo when it divides up the screen for\nus, the navigator, of course,\n\n49\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.470\nis our object navigator and that allows us\nto be able to move from different objects\n\n50\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.094\nthat we need to administrate.\n\n51\n00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:49.410\nWe need to be able to control or\nconfigure and then when we get in there\n\n52\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.310\nsuch as clusters and\nwhat a host in clusters, I then select my\n\n53\n00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.690\nITProTV which is gonna be my demo\nwhich is going to be my data center.\n\n54\n00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.390\nAnd then I can select my EMS host,\nESX host,\n\n55\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.480\nEMS [LAUGH] and you can see this\nhierarchical view going down.\n\n56\n00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.990\nAnd in the center,\nthis is what we call our main work space.\n\n57\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.380\nUsually, that is where we will configure\nthe different objects that we need to.\n\n58\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.160\nSo they make it very easy for\n\n59\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.670\nus to be able to navigate using that\nhierarchical function that you see.\n\n60\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.760\nEverything, of course, begins with the V\ncenter and then within the V center we\n\n61\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.250\nhave our data center of course, and then\nwithin our data center we have, well host.\n\n62\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.600\nAnd then of course within that\nparticular ESXI host we will then\n\n63\n00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.721\nlater on create some VM, some virtual\nmachines and we'll be able to manage\n\n64\n00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:51.840\neven the individual virtual machines\ntoo inside of that drop down.\n\n65\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.650\nSo everything that we do in\nthe navigator is designed to help us to\n\n66\n00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.380\nfluidly move between different objects and\nto go between them too.\n\n67\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.650\nYou can always of course\nuse these buttons.\n\n68\n00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.350\nSo I selected the arrow up at the top and\n\n69\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.960\nthat brought me all the way back home,\nkind of at the highest level.\n\n70\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.420\nWe'll see that, and\nof course details that we have.\n\n71\n00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.600\nThe alarms and the task,\nas you start to configure and\n\n72\n00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.700\nyou start to respond to different\nthings that you're seeing,\n\n73\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.290\nthe task will always appear\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n74\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.540\nAnd this can kind of give you a little\nhistory, of what you have just done, and\n\n75\n00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.470\nsome of the things that\nmay still need to be done\n\n76\n00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.890\nas it's actually completing and finishing.\n\n77\n00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.880\nSo it's very nice to have this\nbecause if you're like me,\n\n78\n00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.180\nsometimes you can't remember exactly\nwhat was the last thing you did.\n\n79\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.760\nIt'll at least give you a list of what\nare some of those objects that you need to\n\n80\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.780\nhave available.\n\n81\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.250\nNow there's a kind of problem with\nwhat I'm showing you right here, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.720\nAnd the problem is fairly simple.\n\n83\n00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.590\nThis is a relatively fresh\ninstall of vSphere along with\n\n84\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.380\nreally an ESXI host server that I have for\nVMs.\n\n85\n00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.370\nBut there's really\nnothing in those objects,\n\n86\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.800\nthere really isn't a lot that's there.\n\n87\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.696\nAnd in that particular aspect it's not\nthe fullest and the fairest way that\n\n88\n00:05:12.696 --> 00:05:17.668\nwe can show you some of the really neat\nfeatures that are inside of vSphere and\n\n89\n00:05:17.668 --> 00:05:19.785\nwe need to talk about those too.\n\n90\n00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:24.890\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking, with the VMware here,\nit is obviously very scalable.\n\n91\n00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.970\nI mean it's an enterprise\nlevel technology.\n\n92\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.110\nNow, Ronnie, let's say I happened to\nhave 100 servers, 500 servers in here.\n\n93\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.580\nIs there a way that I can\nmake it a little bit easier?\n\n94\n00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.560\nIf I'm looking for a particular object,\nrather than than having the use of\n\n95\n00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.280\nnavigation tree that you've shown us and\nI have to click around because I love to\n\n96\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.530\nclick until I break some and\nI actually find it.\n\n97\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.660\nCan we make a little bit easier to find\na specific object within the interface?\n\n98\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.640\n&gt;&gt; Like everything else there are some\ndifferent tools that are available for us.\n\n99\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.160\nBut one of the things that you will take\nadvantage of as your vCenter and your\n\n100\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.460\ndata centers begin to grow and you start\nactually managing, let's not say three or\n\n101\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.420\nfour virtual machines but hundreds if\nnot thousands of virtual machines.\n\n102\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.100\nAnd 10, 20, maybe even 100 data centers.\n\n103\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.040\nMaybe even of course multiple\nappliances that are out there.\n\n104\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.460\nIt becomes a little bit more difficult.\n\n105\n00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.837\nAnd the reason why is each of those\nobjects, right, they show up as,\n\n106\n00:06:16.837 --> 00:06:19.187\nthink about it, a graphic, right?\n\n107\n00:06:19.187 --> 00:06:24.038\nIt's really difficult to\ndistinguish between ESXI host\n\n108\n00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:27.886\nthat's on a 46.20 versus 46.21.\n\n109\n00:06:27.886 --> 00:06:31.918\nYou don't know exactly which one is which\nbecause the objects look exactly the same,\n\n110\n00:06:31.918 --> 00:06:34.950\nunless you take the time to go in and\nrename every single object.\n\n111\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.350\nAnd even then,\nthe icons look exactly the same.\n\n112\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.920\nSo what you can do though,\nis that they have a built in search and\n\n113\n00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.980\nfind feature that really does help us out.\n\n114\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.630\nLet's take a look at that just briefly.\n\n115\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.620\nAnd this is like I said,\nwhere you kind of see that\n\n116\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.050\nthis feature's actually very neat but\nit's not a lot that I can show you.\n\n117\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.840\nBut we can at least take a look here.\n\n118\n00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.470\nSo on my machine, if you're doing a quick\nsearch you can always click up here and\n\n119\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.930\nthen type in, host.\n\n120\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.041\nSo if I start searching hosts, maybe not.\n\n121\n00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:12.109\nLet's see if it actually finds my,\nthere we go.\n\n122\n00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:16.422\nSo I now just typed in an IP address,\noop, not 10, 20.\n\n123\n00:07:16.422 --> 00:07:19.789\nOkay, so I thought I could\ntype in the word host and\n\n124\n00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:24.290\nnotice it found that particular\nESXI host automatically.\n\n125\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.920\nAnd I can just click on it and notice\nthat it brought me right directly to\n\n126\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.150\nwhere I can go ahead and start doing\nsome of the main work that I need to do.\n\n127\n00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.570\nSo it gives me that ability to find\nthat information very quickly.\n\n128\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.570\nWith one server, not exactly\nthe hardest search in the world to do.\n\n129\n00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.471\nBut if you had 10, 15, 20 of these\nthat's where you might start to do that\n\n130\n00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.986\nespecially if that navigation\npane now becomes hefty and\n\n131\n00:07:54.986 --> 00:08:00.283\nthat little search bar that you see right\nhere, it scrolls and is really tiny, okay?\n\n132\n00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:03.149\nIt can help you in doing\nsomething like that very easily.\n\n133\n00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:09.820\nNow along with that particular feature\nthough, it's not only in that one box.\n\n134\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.530\nLemme go back to home for a moment.\n\n135\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.880\nAnd I use the object navigator,\nif I scroll down the bottom,\n\n136\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.220\nunderneath where it says Tags right\nhere I can create a new search and\n\n137\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.680\neven better is the ability\nto save searches, too.\n\n138\n00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.490\nThe saving searches really can help\nif you have your data center kind of\n\n139\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.930\ngrouped in different ways that you\nreally want to actually group them in,\n\n140\n00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.360\nand you might pull them up for\ndifferent reasons.\n\n141\n00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.960\nIt might be that you actually started\ncreating, we'll talk about tags a little\n\n142\n00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.310\nbit later, but where you might actually\ntag them for Wednesday and Thursday and\n\n143\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.640\nthat way you know that each day you’re\nactually supposed to go through and\n\n144\n00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.020\ndo a search and find all the machines\nyou’re supposed to through on Wednesday.\n\n145\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.900\nYou can actually do things like that but\nI’m just gonna select the New Search.\n\n146\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.430\nAnd then, in the new search it\nlooks the same, it’s like okay,\n\n147\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.420\nwhat’s the big deal about this?\n\n148\n00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.040\nWell it’s not a big deal\nthat the search is there,\n\n149\n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.610\nit's over here on the right hand side,\nthat is really kind of the big deal.\n\n150\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.350\nWhich is where it says Advanced Search.\n\n151\n00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:16.150\nIf I select this, this is where\nwe actually have the ability to\n\n152\n00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.260\nfilter and I can go ahead and\nsearch for everything if I want to.\n\n153\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.240\nOr inside of the cluster object,\nor the data center itself.\n\n154\n00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:33.360\nOr a folder, or a host, that satisfied\nany or all of the following criteria.\n\n155\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.450\nSo notice that it gives you that ability\nto go down, and do that, and even add in\n\n156\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.980\nanother criteria, and of course,\nthe different properties we can search by.\n\n157\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.310\nSo you'll see that this is very\ngranular in its nature for\n\n158\n00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.460\nyou to really pinpoint exactly\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n159\n00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.170\nAnd even add in an additional criteria.\n\n160\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.520\nNot only search for it.\n\n161\n00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.940\nBut to save that so\nthat you can use it later on,\n\n162\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.500\ninstead of having to recreate that.\n\n163\n00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.790\nEspecially if you have four or\n\n164\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.430\nfive different criteria that\nyou're really trying to get to.\n\n165\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.500\nAnd then a week later you know\nyou gotta get to the same thing.\n\n166\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.460\nBut you have 100 objects, you have\na 1,000 objects this is the way to go.\n\n167\n00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.370\nAnd that will help speed up your process\nto be able to use that is a very\n\n168\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.980\nneat tool that we also need\nto be able to access and\n\n169\n00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.790\nuse effectively when our data\ncenter inside of VMware begins to\n\n170\n00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:29.780\ngrow beyond our wildest imagination and\nyet, it is right here\n\n171\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.350\ninside of VCenter we can image all that\nand find the information very effectively.\n\n172\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.790\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, now you're talking about\nmanaging 500 to 1,000servers.\n\n173\n00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.220\nI can imagine if you was one person,\n\n174\n00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.510\nif you were an hourly employee,\nsure no problem.\n\n175\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.520\nI have all day.\n\n176\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.860\nBut, if I am a salary employee I'm not one\nthat would be easy administrative burden\n\n177\n00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.480\non this.\n\n178\n00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.520\nIs there a way, I think of like in Active\nDirectory, right, you can do delegation,\n\n179\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.580\nI can delegate certain\ntasks out to other users.\n\n180\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.440\nIs that something that we see inside\nof this vSphere Client Interface?\n\n181\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.220\nDo we have the ability\nto perform delegation?\n\n182\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.500\nAnd if we do,\nhow would we go about doing that?\n\n183\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.350\n&gt;&gt; You do, you have this\nability where you can control\n\n184\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.970\naccess to certain objects if you want to.\n\n185\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.650\nIt really does give you that\nvery grain of control where\n\n186\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.860\nIf you're not the only person\nworking in the system, but\n\n187\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.690\nyou wanna make sure that someone\nlike Ronnie doesn't come along and\n\n188\n00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:23.260\ndelete all of your ESXi servers,\nwhat you can do instead if he's managing,\n\n189\n00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.490\nlet's say, three or four VMS, is lock him\ndown to those VMs if we want them to.\n\n190\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.570\nOr, we may also be able to say,\n\n191\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:36.420\nlook, will give Ronnie actually\npermissions to reboot a server.\n\n192\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.110\nOr to actually turn on servers that\ngot turned off accidentally, but\n\n193\n00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.030\nwe're not gonna give him\nthe ability to shut down servers.\n\n194\n00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:49.130\nAll that is actually possible when you use\na combination of things to help us along.\n\n195\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.330\nSo what we're talking about, of course,\n\n196\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.470\nthen is access control systems\nthat are actually built in,\n\n197\n00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.730\nalong with the use of different\npermissions that we're seeing.\n\n198\n00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:01.156\nLet's take a look very briefly at\nwhat we want to be able to do here.\n\n199\n00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:06.650\nSo inside of the object navigator,\nI'm gonna be able to say this one day,\n\n200\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.740\nI'm gonna scroll down and\ngo into Administration.\n\n201\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:16.332\nAnd with Administration, there\nare a couple of different objects again\n\n202\n00:12:16.332 --> 00:12:22.370\nsub-objects if you wanted to or related\nobjects that we need to pay attention to.\n\n203\n00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.480\nWe can actually assign\nusers different roles.\n\n204\n00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.180\nAnd this work is better inside that client\nintegration we have it inside inside of\n\n205\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.580\nActive Directory if we choose to do that.\n\n206\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.910\nBut we've got to realize that as\nmuch as doing something like this,\n\n207\n00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.970\nwhere we can create different roles, and\nadd them in, it really doesn't matter\n\n208\n00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.070\nuntil we attach them to different objects,\nand that is key.\n\n209\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.410\nSo, I can, for example, take Wes, and\nI can create for him as actually being\n\n210\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:55.945\nthe role of a virtual machine user for\nexample right here okay, I can do that.\n\n211\n00:12:55.945 --> 00:13:00.878\nBut it doesn't mean that Wes\nactually has access to that until I\n\n212\n00:13:00.878 --> 00:13:04.334\nactually assign him to that object, okay.\n\n213\n00:13:04.334 --> 00:13:09.000\nSo even if I limit his access and\nhe just logs on that's perfectly fine but\n\n214\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.746\nuntil that is actually useful,\nuntil we actually link them to an object,\n\n215\n00:13:13.746 --> 00:13:17.340\nvery key when you're getting ready for\nthe exam.\n\n216\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.601\nIf people are wondering why hey,\n\n217\n00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:24.202\nwe know that we created Wes as\na virtual machine user, okay, but yet\n\n218\n00:13:24.202 --> 00:13:29.732\nhe's able to actually get access to\neverything inside of vCenter instead here.\n\n219\n00:13:29.732 --> 00:13:30.775\nWhat's going on?\n\n220\n00:13:30.775 --> 00:13:34.851\nWe know we created it, well,\nit's because you forgot to attach them\n\n221\n00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:39.700\nto that particular object is kind of the\nkey, so I hope that that's exam point that\n\n222\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.600\nyou might want to make sure that\nyou pay attention to as well okay.\n\n223\n00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.800\nSo those are some of\nthe things that you can do and\n\n224\n00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.840\nthen of course there are also different\nprivileges just like we are talking\n\n225\n00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.040\nabout the ability to get access to certain\nthings over here such as the host and\n\n226\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.850\nwhether we wants so far for example\ninside of the EMS, ESX, am gonna say EMS.\n\n227\n00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.920\nESXi configuration\n\n228\n00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.690\nif I wanna that to happen get answers\nto the inventory Replication server or\n\n229\n00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.610\nthe Host profile, Inventory,\nyou name it, vApp, Virtual machine.\n\n230\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.860\nAnd then each one of these\nare different ways that we can\n\n231\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.270\nactually have not only the user role,\nwho can do whatever they need to.\n\n232\n00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.990\nBut also the privileges\nthat we assign that user.\n\n233\n00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.110\nBut remember that that doesn't really\napply until you actually apply that\n\n234\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.580\nparticular user then to that object.\n\n235\n00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.870\nYou can also have global permissions.\n\n236\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.980\nGlobal permissions is\nexactly like it sounds.\n\n237\n00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.530\nPermissions grant users or\n\n238\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.180\ngroup access to inventory objects and\ngive them rights to perform on that.\n\n239\n00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.390\nSo this is where they have\naccess to the entire VCenter\n\n240\n00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.600\nin those global permissions.\n\n241\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.780\nAnd all of those permissions apply to\nthe root, and span across VSphere.\n\n242\n00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.450\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhy is that important?\n\n243\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.880\nBecause you can have\nmore than one VCenter.\n\n244\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.980\nWhich mean it will expand the entire\nthing if you're actually not careful.\n\n245\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.200\nSo if you're going, man,\nI want to learn how to do that.\n\n246\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.250\nGo into VCP6 and you'll actually see\nthe idea of using some of these.\n\n247\n00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.000\nWe can also, of course,\nuse our single sign-on.\n\n248\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.420\nThe integration in with\nActive Directory is also key.\n\n249\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.980\nBeing able to do some different\nconfigurations, you name it.\n\n250\n00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.230\nBut this is pretty much the key is being\nable to do something like this right here.\n\n251\n00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:32.400\nSo now, If I click the plus sign and\nthen on the role name, now this\n\n252\n00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.720\nis where there's a couple of different\nones if you add in something new here.\n\n253\n00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.070\nIf you are gonna integrate\nthis with Active Directory,\n\n254\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.980\nthe name has to be the same.\n\n255\n00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.290\nSo, for example, the remote\ndesktop users in Active Directory,\n\n256\n00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.950\njust as an example, right?\n\n257\n00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.280\nYou gotta make sure it's spelled and\nit's case-sensitive.\n\n258\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.624\nSo, that is also key.\n\n259\n00:15:51.624 --> 00:15:56.692\nIf you misspell it with lowercase\nletters and the group name inside\n\n260\n00:15:56.692 --> 00:16:01.411\nof Active Directory is proper case,\nit's not going to work.\n\n261\n00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:03.628\nSo, just be aware.\n\n262\n00:16:03.628 --> 00:16:04.870\nYou assign them.\n\n263\n00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.156\nLet's just see, like Domain Admins,\n\n264\n00:16:07.156 --> 00:16:10.976\ncuz that's the one group I think I\nknow how to spell for right now.\n\n265\n00:16:10.976 --> 00:16:14.751\nThen select Privileges, is here,\nthat we can now go through,\n\n266\n00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:17.760\njust like what Wes was talking about.\n\n267\n00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.400\nAnd assign, such as being\nable to Acknowledge alarms or\n\n268\n00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.610\nDisable an alarm or Remove it,\nSet an alarm status if I wanted to.\n\n269\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.414\nIn the datacenter here,\nwe can actually say, hey,\n\n270\n00:16:31.414 --> 00:16:34.420\ndomain admins can create a datacenter.\n\n271\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.530\nWe can do just information\nlike that very easily.\n\n272\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.840\nAnd I don't have this integrated\nin with Active Directory.\n\n273\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.480\nBut now that I've added them in,\nlet's see if I have it.\n\n274\n00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.080\nThere it is.\n\n275\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.090\nSee, there's Domain admins and\nthen at this point,\n\n276\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.830\nbecause it's actually\nnot propagated anywhere.\n\n277\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.550\nWe don't have them in any object.\n\n278\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.510\nIt means, hey, there's no real use for\nthis at this point.\n\n279\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.051\nSo it's here that we need to go ahead and\n\n280\n00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:03.607\nstart to just kinda define\na few things if we wanted to.\n\n281\n00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:09.151\nAnd we can go into different objects,\nlet me see if I can access to,\n\n282\n00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:13.800\nlet's say, I think we said VM, didn't we?\n\n283\n00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.577\nBut I don't have a VM.\n\n284\n00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:23.107\nBut if I right click on just\nthe Datacenter, just for\n\n285\n00:17:23.107 --> 00:17:28.532\nexample, notice here that I\ncan select Add Permission.\n\n286\n00:17:28.532 --> 00:17:33.529\nAnd then I can click on this drop down and\nselect Domain Admins,\n\n287\n00:17:33.529 --> 00:17:35.990\nand there you go, okay?\n\n288\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.980\nSo you click Cancel,\nonly when its attached to an object,\n\n289\n00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.351\ndo those permissions really matter,\ndo they do anything at all?\n\n290\n00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:45.830\nAnd that's kind of key when we\nstart to take a look at doing this.\n\n291\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.810\nNow, the only other thing\nthat you have to worry about\n\n292\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.260\nas far as an exam detail goes here,\n\n293\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.250\nI made sure that I typed this out, is to\nbe able to modify existing permissions.\n\n294\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.628\nSo if you're not given this permission and\nyou still login vCenter,\n\n295\n00:17:59.628 --> 00:18:02.029\nI need to change somebody's\npermissions here.\n\n296\n00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:05.894\nThat was called\npermissions.modifypermissions.\n\n297\n00:18:05.894 --> 00:18:09.799\nI know it's weird, but if you don't\nhave that on your own permissions,\n\n298\n00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:13.250\nyou will not be able to edit\nthose types of permissions.\n\n299\n00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.773\nSo just remember that if you don't have\nthat particular privilege in there,\n\n300\n00:18:17.773 --> 00:18:20.975\npermissions.modify, then\nyou can't go in and say,\n\n301\n00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.284\nI'm gonna modify Wes' permissions.\n\n302\n00:18:23.284 --> 00:18:25.637\nIt's not going to give you that, so\n\n303\n00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:29.440\ndo make sure that you take\na look at that as well, okay?\n\n304\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.160\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I noticed something that\nwhen you were creating that user.\n\n305\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.270\nI didn't see any check\nmarks in those boxes,\n\n306\n00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.760\nis it safe to say that when you first\ncreate the user, it's an implicit deny.\n\n307\n00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.070\nMeaning, unless you explicitly give\nthose privileges, you can't have them.\n\n308\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.097\nAnd the other thing I would say, just as\na recap so that I understand it right.\n\n309\n00:18:46.097 --> 00:18:49.412\nEven if you do give them permissions, if\nyou don't sign them those permissions over\n\n310\n00:18:49.412 --> 00:18:51.290\nan object,\neven then they don't do anything.\n\n311\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:55.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, it's just like keeping\nthe bowling team in the back and\n\n312\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.530\nnot letting them bowl,\nis really what it's like.\n\n313\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.612\nThe very fact is,\nyou can have everybody ready to go.\n\n314\n00:19:01.612 --> 00:19:05.668\nBut the very fact is they're not actually\ngonna be able to do anything until you\n\n315\n00:19:05.668 --> 00:19:09.982\nassign them the ability to have access to\nthose different permissions too, okay?\n\n316\n00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:14.960\nAll right, so that also of course means\nthat we need to understand a little bit\n\n317\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.872\nmore about virtual\nmachines just briefly and\n\n318\n00:19:17.872 --> 00:19:21.100\nthe different files that actually exist.\n\n319\n00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.432\nNow virtual machines are going\nto act a little bit,\n\n320\n00:19:24.432 --> 00:19:29.332\nreally not super different but we do\nneed to understand where they resign.\n\n321\n00:19:29.332 --> 00:19:33.448\nIf you're fairly new to the idea of\nthe virtual machine environment,\n\n322\n00:19:33.448 --> 00:19:37.006\nit's very easy to think that you\ninstall the vSphere here and\n\n323\n00:19:37.006 --> 00:19:39.113\nthe vCenter are all on one machine.\n\n324\n00:19:39.113 --> 00:19:40.724\nAnd on that same machine,\n\n325\n00:19:40.724 --> 00:19:45.370\nyou are also going to end up having\nof course where your VMs are.\n\n326\n00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.290\nBut usually that's not\nwhere they are stored.\n\n327\n00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.250\nNormally of course,\n\n328\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.410\nvirtual machines then are stored\non what we call a hypervisor and\n\n329\n00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.670\nthat's the ESXi that I have been talking\nabout, which is a separate machine.\n\n330\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.131\nBut we can manage it through the vCenter,\n\n331\n00:20:00.131 --> 00:20:02.886\nvSphere console right\nhere in the WebClient.\n\n332\n00:20:02.886 --> 00:20:10.361\nAnd that is key for us understanding\nthe idea of managing something like that.\n\n333\n00:20:10.361 --> 00:20:15.276\nYou can try and manage the actual\nvSphere itself, or the ESXi,\n\n334\n00:20:15.276 --> 00:20:21.380\nsorry, let me bring up an example\nof what I'm talking about here.\n\n335\n00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.270\nSo that we can take a look.\n\n336\n00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.165\nThis is it.\n\n337\n00:20:24.165 --> 00:20:28.981\nWes, that is the main interface\nis what it looks like right here.\n\n338\n00:20:28.981 --> 00:20:30.722\n&gt;&gt; That looks absolutely minimalistic and\n\n339\n00:20:30.722 --> 00:20:32.446\nthe first thing I notice right-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n340\n00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:33.361\n&gt;&gt; Down there at the bottom,\n\n341\n00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:35.363\nit looks like they don't want\nyou to manage it from here.\n\n342\n00:20:35.363 --> 00:20:37.468\nBecause I do see some kind of URL.\n\n343\n00:20:37.468 --> 00:20:39.624\nCan you explain that URL for\nus there, Ronnie?\n\n344\n00:20:39.624 --> 00:20:42.314\n&gt;&gt; Let's see,\nwhich one are you talk, down here.\n\n345\n00:20:42.314 --> 00:20:43.400\nRight here where it says download tools.\n\n346\n00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n347\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.897\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nnotice that even at this point, right?\n\n348\n00:20:46.897 --> 00:20:51.896\nLook, don't try and do anything here,\nthis is really just about setting it up to\n\n349\n00:20:51.896 --> 00:20:54.705\nmake sure they set up on your network,\nokay?\n\n350\n00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:57.403\nBut once you have that you\nnormally just go to one\n\n351\n00:20:57.403 --> 00:21:00.550\nof these addresses inside of your browser.\n\n352\n00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.830\nSo let's take for example, I come here and\n\n353\n00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:11.259\nI take the http10.0.46.20, and\n\n354\n00:21:11.259 --> 00:21:18.313\nit brings you of course,\nto a website, and there you go.\n\n355\n00:21:18.313 --> 00:21:21.175\nAnd you're like, all right,\nnow I'm actually in here and\n\n356\n00:21:21.175 --> 00:21:24.720\nI'm ready to go, and\nthen you find out something, okay?\n\n357\n00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.690\nIf you need to access this host remotely,\ndownload that vSphere Client for Windows.\n\n358\n00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.300\nWell this worked great as long\nas you're in vSphere 5 or 5.1,\n\n359\n00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.738\nnot so great once you actually\nwent to vSphere 5.5 and\n\n360\n00:21:38.738 --> 00:21:42.760\n6.0 a little bit later on,\nis not gonna help you out.\n\n361\n00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.050\nThey give you some configuration\nthat you can do and\n\n362\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.630\nyou can even install\na license inside of it.\n\n363\n00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.342\nBut overall though,\nbeginning really with 5.5 and\n\n364\n00:21:51.342 --> 00:21:55.709\n6, you're probably not going to\nneed to do that at all, okay?\n\n365\n00:21:55.709 --> 00:21:56.614\nAll right, so\n\n366\n00:21:56.614 --> 00:22:01.800\nyeah, it really does not want you\ndirectly managing that thing at all.\n\n367\n00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.670\nSo that's why you need to come here\ninside of the vSphere Web Client.\n\n368\n00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.560\nFrom that point,\nif you have everything up and\n\n369\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.460\ngoing the way that you need to and that\nincludes having a vCenter server, okay?\n\n370\n00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.420\nAnd once you actually\nhave the vCenter server,\n\n371\n00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.910\nyou also need to create a data object.\n\n372\n00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.860\nSo it's right here, you'd actually select\na data object which we've already done,\n\n373\n00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.337\nwe've created a datacenter here.\n\n374\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.842\nAnd then once you have that datacenter,\nso here it is showing up.\n\n375\n00:22:28.842 --> 00:22:33.132\nIt's inside the datacenter\nthat then you add in host,\n\n376\n00:22:33.132 --> 00:22:38.180\nwhich is where your virtual machine\nfiles are gonna be located.\n\n377\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.237\nAnd mine's look like it's taking\na little bit of time trying to get him.\n\n378\n00:22:43.237 --> 00:22:46.643\nAnd what you are looking for\nof course is that Connected state and\n\n379\n00:22:46.643 --> 00:22:48.650\nof course the Normal status.\n\n380\n00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.594\nAnything besides normal means your day is\nactually gonna be a little worse of than\n\n381\n00:22:52.594 --> 00:22:53.996\nyou think it's going to be.\n\n382\n00:22:53.996 --> 00:22:58.165\nBut just understand that\nthat is where you will begin\n\n383\n00:22:58.165 --> 00:23:03.380\nthe creation at this point of\ndifferent virtual machines.\n\n384\n00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:08.130\nSo inside of this I can right-click,\nand I can create a new virtual machine\n\n385\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.580\njust by doing that and\nstart setting it up from here.\n\n386\n00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.669\nNow I'm not gonna do that because\nwhat I've just shown you, right?\n\n387\n00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:16.570\nI was running essentially this.\n\n388\n00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:23.262\nI have VMware Fusion which is VMware\nis Hyper Visor running on my MacBook.\n\n389\n00:23:23.262 --> 00:23:26.540\nI've actually got EXSi\nrunning on top of that.\n\n390\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.020\nSo it's actually a Hyper Visor\nnesting a Hyper Visor.\n\n391\n00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.610\nAnd I think I'd be pushing my luck,\nif I then tried to actually run\n\n392\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:38.000\na virtual machine inside of\na nested Hyper Visor as well.\n\n393\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.497\nI'd probably be pushing my luck beyond,\nbut at this point here,\n\n394\n00:23:41.497 --> 00:23:43.161\nit does give you that ability.\n\n395\n00:23:43.161 --> 00:23:46.810\nAnd so this is where you would go ahead\nand manage it from this point here.\n\n396\n00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.662\nAnd you can even create\none from templates and\n\n397\n00:23:50.662 --> 00:23:53.918\nlibraries that they have available to you,\nready to go.\n\n398\n00:23:53.918 --> 00:23:55.598\nThat's kind of the meat and\n\n399\n00:23:55.598 --> 00:24:00.215\npotatoes of what most of us at the VCA\nlevel are going to really end up doing.\n\n400\n00:24:00.215 --> 00:24:03.572\nIt's not that you can't be\nmanaging the entire vCenter,\n\n401\n00:24:03.572 --> 00:24:07.476\nvSphere itself You could be, but\nthe very fact is more than likely,\n\n402\n00:24:07.476 --> 00:24:12.202\nit's gonna be because you have a user, or\nyou have a department, that has a need,\n\n403\n00:24:12.202 --> 00:24:15.220\nsuch as a web server\nthey need to bring up.\n\n404\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:20.270\nYes, you're creating that particular\nweb server, assigning an IP address,\n\n405\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.410\ngiving it some space, verifying it can\nhave connectivity to that department.\n\n406\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:29.490\nThat's probably gonna be more along\nthe lines of the VCA guy that comes along.\n\n407\n00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.409\nConfiguring everything else, with\npermissions and all that, that's the VCP.\n\n408\n00:24:32.409 --> 00:24:37.070\nBut you have to at least understand\nto know Where that stuff is, okay?\n\n409\n00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.180\nSo that's just a brief understanding,\nat least of understanding the files and\n\n410\n00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.690\nthe system, and the way that the structure\nis set up for of course, virtual machines.\n\n411\n00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:50.280\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, now you showed us a powerful\nfeature there early on, on finding stuff.\n\n412\n00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.190\nLike the filters and the search options,\nvery, very great for\n\n413\n00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.230\nfinding a single object,\nif you've got a thousand.\n\n414\n00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.319\nNow what if, let's say beforehand,\nwhat if I want to compartmentalize?\n\n415\n00:24:59.319 --> 00:25:02.649\nI've got a lot of objects in here, and I\nwant something in here that somebody else,\n\n416\n00:25:02.649 --> 00:25:05.144\nthey might be arbitrary or\nmaybe they're not to our company.\n\n417\n00:25:05.144 --> 00:25:08.477\nBut I want a way to maybe categorize and\ngroup things together, so it's a little\n\n418\n00:25:08.477 --> 00:25:11.890\nmore visual for me and the employees that\nare working with this infrastructure.\n\n419\n00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.113\nIs there a way that we can do that?\n\n420\n00:25:13.113 --> 00:25:17.300\n&gt;&gt; We definitely can, and\nthat is by using what we call tags.\n\n421\n00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.934\nNow, everybody that's been working\ninside of Microsoft recently,\n\n422\n00:25:21.934 --> 00:25:23.433\nWindows and MacBook.\n\n423\n00:25:23.433 --> 00:25:31.050\nTags are kind of the, you either love them\nor hate them is pretty much what it does.\n\n424\n00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.215\nSo inside of even Windows, right?\n\n425\n00:25:33.215 --> 00:25:37.567\nYou can create a file and then down at the\nbottom of your file explore you're gonna\n\n426\n00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:41.419\nend up seeing where there's normally\na line that says, add a tag here.\n\n427\n00:25:41.419 --> 00:25:45.802\nAnd the same things can actually be\ndone inside of the vSphere as well or\n\n428\n00:25:45.802 --> 00:25:46.704\nthe vCenter.\n\n429\n00:25:46.704 --> 00:25:51.569\nAnd that gives you the ability to add\nwhat we call a metadata to those objects.\n\n430\n00:25:51.569 --> 00:25:54.529\nThe whole idea behind metadata of course,\nis to\n\n431\n00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:59.510\ngive you something that is searchable and\nsortable and that is the key.\n\n432\n00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.700\nThe reason why you need\nthat stuff is because well,\n\n433\n00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.060\nyour data center's gonna\ncontinue to grow out and up.\n\n434\n00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.210\nAnd those are also key concepts\nthat you'll see inside of VCP6\n\n435\n00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.390\nas well is that data centers\nnever really get smaller,\n\n436\n00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.400\nunless you're moving to\nanother host of some sort.\n\n437\n00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.630\nBut overall though, you'll see that\nthat is actually kind of the key,\n\n438\n00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.250\nis to make sure that you get enough\ninformation in there, where it can be\n\n439\n00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:27.620\nfound at a moment's notice just due to\ncertain words that you're looking up.\n\n440\n00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:33.030\nSo when you start to do this,\nwe can also as you create VMs or\n\n441\n00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:36.510\nas you are actually managing datacenters\nthat you can also attach tags.\n\n442\n00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.650\nLet me show you what we're talking about,\nokay?\n\n443\n00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:39.467\nSo let me click on,\n\n444\n00:26:39.467 --> 00:26:42.338\nover here on the left hand side,\nI'm gonna scroll down from Home.\n\n445\n00:26:42.338 --> 00:26:48.670\nI clicked on Home, and\nI scroll down in the object navigator.\n\n446\n00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.020\nI can click on Tags, it says,\nhey, here's how you get started.\n\n447\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:57.720\nAnd then I click on Items, and\nthere's a little tiny price tag,\n\n448\n00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.310\nI know that's kinda weird.\n\n449\n00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.410\nBut you can actually create a price tag,\nyou can also create different Categories.\n\n450\n00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:04.940\nIt's exactly like it sounds.\n\n451\n00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.187\nThe whole goal is create a bunch of little\ntags, then that can also be categorized.\n\n452\n00:27:10.187 --> 00:27:12.620\nOne of the best uses that\nwe might have especially,\n\n453\n00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.667\nwe have to keep accounting of everything.\n\n454\n00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:16.879\nAnd we have audits for this stuff,\n\n455\n00:27:16.879 --> 00:27:21.699\nis that you might find out that you\nneed to for licensing purposes, right?\n\n456\n00:27:21.699 --> 00:27:27.050\nFor your VMs, you need to find out\nhow many Windows based computers or\n\n457\n00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:31.490\nWindows servers that you have\ninside of your VM network.\n\n458\n00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.320\nAnd then how many Linux servers\nthat you have in there to.\n\n459\n00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.680\nWell both of those are operating systems,\nso\n\n460\n00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.450\ninstead you might actually create\na category that we call operating systems.\n\n461\n00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:48.245\nAnd then you might create two tags\nthat you call like windows and\n\n462\n00:27:48.245 --> 00:27:50.613\nwhat's the other one I said?\n\n463\n00:27:50.613 --> 00:27:51.294\nLinux.\n&gt;&gt; Linux.\n\n464\n00:27:51.294 --> 00:27:52.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I couldn't remember.\n\n465\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.760\nSo let's go ahead and create\na New Category and we'll do exact that.\n\n466\n00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.908\nSo we'll call this one, Operating Systems.\n\n467\n00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:07.217\nAnd from this point, let's see can\nI actually, Many tags per object,\n\n468\n00:28:07.217 --> 00:28:07.955\nif I want to?\n\n469\n00:28:07.955 --> 00:28:09.050\nSure, why not?\n\n470\n00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.310\nIt says hey,\nwhat can I associate this with?\n\n471\n00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.325\nWell for this point,\nI can uncheck All objects.\n\n472\n00:28:17.325 --> 00:28:20.940\nAnd then I might scroll down and\nselect, Virtual Machines.\n\n473\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.330\nThat way, I know I'm not just\ngetting everything that might have\n\n474\n00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.910\nWindows listed in it or Linux listed in.\n\n475\n00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.039\nI'm just, actually,\ndoing the idea of virtual machines.\n\n476\n00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.980\nI'm just trying to think of whether or\nno, let's just do one tag prerogative.\n\n477\n00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.070\nSo that means, you can only have\none tag and not multiple tags here,\n\n478\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.380\nso let's do that for right now.\n\n479\n00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.247\nSo I've created this category,\nand then I can click on Tags, and\n\n480\n00:28:45.247 --> 00:28:47.115\nI'll create a tag here.\n\n481\n00:28:47.115 --> 00:28:50.320\nAnd we'll call this one,\nlike I said, Windows.\n\n482\n00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.597\nNow you can get grand,\nyou can do Windows XP, 7, if you want to.\n\n483\n00:28:54.597 --> 00:29:01.288\nI'm just going to put Windows and on\nthe Category, Operating Systems, click OK.\n\n484\n00:29:01.288 --> 00:29:06.310\nAnd then I'll create another one here for,\nlet's just do Linux.\n\n485\n00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:11.137\nI know everybody that's a Linux like, are\nyou joking me, there's more than, I know,\n\n486\n00:29:11.137 --> 00:29:13.500\nI know, but\njust bear with me on this here.\n\n487\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.736\nAnd we'll just go OK, and\n\n488\n00:29:15.736 --> 00:29:21.237\nnow if we had a VM listed which I\ndon't have one ready for us to go.\n\n489\n00:29:21.237 --> 00:29:25.080\nBut we could go into that VM and\nadd that in as a tag.\n\n490\n00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.493\nAnd let me just show you some of\nthe places where you can add a tag in.\n\n491\n00:29:29.493 --> 00:29:32.449\nNow let me select here on host,\nhere that'll work.\n\n492\n00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:39.078\nAnd now if I select the actual ESXI host,\nif I created a tag for this.\n\n493\n00:29:39.078 --> 00:29:42.730\nNotice that on this management Tag,\nwell Tags.\n\n494\n00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.092\nAnd then we can actually\neither create a new one or\n\n495\n00:29:46.092 --> 00:29:48.806\nassign the tag that we have available.\n\n496\n00:29:48.806 --> 00:29:52.751\nAnd on this, none of them are actually\ngonna show up because I already\n\n497\n00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:54.666\nhad assigned it to only VMs only.\n\n498\n00:29:54.666 --> 00:29:57.860\nBut you can see where\nthat would actually work.\n\n499\n00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.610\nAnd the more that you create this, the\nmore granular that you can actually have\n\n500\n00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.440\nsortable things and\nof course, searchable things.\n\n501\n00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.550\nIt's really gonna help you out once\nyour datacenter begins to grow.\n\n502\n00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.843\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, let's say that I've sat down,\nand I've spent the time to to the tags and\n\n503\n00:30:09.843 --> 00:30:10.760\nthe categorization.\n\n504\n00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.562\nAnd I really rely on those, but I've got\nto bring this vSphere server offline, for\n\n505\n00:30:14.562 --> 00:30:15.446\nwhatever reason.\n\n506\n00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:18.858\nMaybe I've got to do hardware\nconfiguration on it, and\n\n507\n00:30:18.858 --> 00:30:21.405\nI need these tags to go to another server.\n\n508\n00:30:21.405 --> 00:30:23.119\nIs that something that we can do, so\n\n509\n00:30:23.119 --> 00:30:26.893\nthat I don't have to worry about losing\nall of that work that I've done in order\n\n510\n00:30:26.893 --> 00:30:30.167\nto make this a little bit more,\nI guess understandable for myself?\n\n511\n00:30:30.167 --> 00:30:31.840\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that the tags,\n\n512\n00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.726\nonce you actually have multiple different\nclusters, or you have a cluster or\n\n513\n00:30:35.726 --> 00:30:38.206\nyou have different vCenters\nthat are out there.\n\n514\n00:30:38.206 --> 00:30:42.488\nYou can migrate these tags from one\nparticular location to another.\n\n515\n00:30:42.488 --> 00:30:45.510\nSo all that is very possible\nto be able to do once you have\n\n516\n00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:50.710\neverything set up the way that you want,\nand you have the communications going on.\n\n517\n00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:55.179\nYou do have the ability to have those tags\nmove from whatever object that you need\n\n518\n00:30:55.179 --> 00:30:55.718\nto do so.\n\n519\n00:30:55.718 --> 00:30:56.940\nSure enough.\n\n520\n00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.466\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\nWell that's a lot of great information\n\n521\n00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:01.450\nabout our vSphere Center here.\n\n522\n00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:02.920\nThank you for explaining that.\n\n523\n00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.771\nNow, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n524\n00:31:04.771 --> 00:31:06.133\nBut before we do, Ronnie,\n\n525\n00:31:06.133 --> 00:31:09.869\ndo you have additional words that you\nmight need to throw to our viewers, or\n\n526\n00:31:09.869 --> 00:31:12.980\nmaybe just some pieces of advice\nyou'd like to let them know?\n\n527\n00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.730\n&gt;&gt; Once again,\n\n528\n00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:18.710\nyou've got to get in there and be able to\nsearch this thing out and be able to run\n\n529\n00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.040\nthrough some different scenarios of\nwhat you want to learn about it.\n\n530\n00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.120\nYou've got to, VCA even though as an exam\n\n531\n00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.770\nin which you really don't have to go to,\nsome exam testing place.\n\n532\n00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:37.818\nYou can do this at home, it's still\na very challenging exam, if you don't\n\n533\n00:31:37.818 --> 00:31:43.780\nhave any particular hands on experience\nin of course the vCenter itself.\n\n534\n00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.875\nSo I do recommend that you\nmake sure you get in there,\n\n535\n00:31:47.875 --> 00:31:53.663\nmake sure you follow the blueprint\nthat you'll find for the exam itself.\n\n536\n00:31:53.663 --> 00:31:57.455\nAnd make sure you go over every\nsingle one of the actual objects.\n\n537\n00:31:57.455 --> 00:32:00.230\nJust like we have actually\ndone here during our shows and\n\n538\n00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.949\nour update shows as well as the regular\npart of the show, to make sure that we\n\n539\n00:32:03.949 --> 00:32:08.440\ncover all of those different objects\nthat are actually there and available.\n\n540\n00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.570\nSometimes you actually end up seeing\nthat you may have actually heard me make\n\n541\n00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.940\na mistake as far as\nverbalizing some things.\n\n542\n00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.401\nIt does happen because I tend to use so\nmany acronyms.\n\n543\n00:32:17.401 --> 00:32:20.010\nI don't remember what every\nsingle one stands for.\n\n544\n00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:25.001\nBut just make sure you at least go through\nthat and verify what I've actually said,\n\n545\n00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:30.082\ncuz sometimes it is easy to forget with so\nmany different objects that are out there.\n\n546\n00:32:30.082 --> 00:32:32.005\nSo hands on this kind of the key,\n\n547\n00:32:32.005 --> 00:32:35.580\nremember that you can either\nuse the evaluation addition.\n\n548\n00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:40.199\nOr if you inside a VMware and you sign\nup for a learning account at VMware,\n\n549\n00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:44.896\nyou'll probably see that if you look\naround that cuz it's not a great easy\n\n550\n00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:48.230\nintuitive site, it just really isn't.\n\n551\n00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:49.557\nBut you search around that,\n\n552\n00:32:49.557 --> 00:32:53.328\nyou'll see where they actually do have\nsome labs that are hidden here and there.\n\n553\n00:32:53.328 --> 00:32:57.026\nAnd they'll give you access to everything\nset up so that you can actually do kind of\n\n554\n00:32:57.026 --> 00:33:00.150\nthe same things that we're\ndoing right here on the show.\n\n555\n00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.550\n&gt;&gt; Practice, practice, practice.\n\n556\n00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.766\nWords of wisdom from Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n557\n00:33:02.766 --> 00:33:03.428\n&gt;&gt; Yep, no doubt.\n\n558\n00:33:03.428 --> 00:33:06.410\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie, as always, we appreciate\nhaving you here in the studios and\n\n559\n00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.059\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n560\n00:33:08.059 --> 00:33:11.080\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n561\n00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:11.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n562\n00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.315\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n563\n00:33:14.315 -->

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:16.251\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:20.871\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our VCA6 DCV if I can\n\n8\n00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:22.490\nget that acronym right.\n\n9\n00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.901\nAnd joining us on the studio for\n\n10\n00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:26.132\nthis endeavor is none\nother than Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:26.132 --> 00:00:27.264\nRonnie how are you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:27.919\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.743\nThank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue to take a look at more of\n\n14\n00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:36.650\nthe different things that we need to know\nabout inside of course VMware's vCenter.\n\n15\n00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.990\nAnd today, we're really going to start off\nby talking about monitoring, of course,\n\n16\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.630\nthe ESX,\nmaybe I'll say ESXI hosts themselves.\n\n17\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.150\nAnd also some of the things we have to do\n\n18\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.920\nto make sure that virtual machines\nare also ready to be monitored, too.\n\n19\n00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.020\nSo when we begin of course it means that\n\n20\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.470\nwe have to be able to\ndo a couple of things.\n\n21\n00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.340\nOne is to really get the vCenter\nready to install virtual machines and\n\n22\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.440\nthen get the,\nwhat we call of course the VM tools.\n\n23\n00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.440\nI was trying to remember.\n\n24\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.460\nThere's so many different ones out there.\n\n25\n00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.330\nWhen you work with Virtual Box and\nVMWare and Citrix, and then you also work\n\n26\n00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.730\nwith like Hyper V that calls this tools\ndifferent things all the time and\n\n27\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.890\nI always get them confused and\nmixed up very easily.\n\n28\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.010\nSo, in VMware I'm like, is VMware\nintegration, no, that's not right.\n\n29\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.430\nIt is actually the VMware tools.\n\n30\n00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.120\nAnd this is a package of software that\nwe wanna install into the VMs, and\n\n31\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.290\nwe'll talk about some of the reasons\nwhy when we get in there.\n\n32\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.380\nBut I wanna talk about that and then of\ncourse we wanna see enabling that and\n\n33\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.320\nwhat that really helps us to do.\n\n34\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.950\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nwhat are some of the first steps?\n\n35\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.770\nIf I need to gain access to this console,\nwhere do I have to start if I\n\n36\n00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.832\nwanna go ahead and\nI wanna start working with my machines?\n\n37\n00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:59.452\n&gt;&gt; All right so, when we take a look then\nat the vCenter we need to go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.430\nlog in and\n\n39\n00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.690\nI want to show you the difference in some\nof the things you have to be able to do.\n\n40\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.280\nSo, let's take a look at\nmy machine right here.\n\n41\n00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.630\nNow, when you took a look\nat previous episodes and\n\n42\n00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.500\nwe were really starting to login,\nwe really used the default\n\n43\n00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.480\nAdministrator account that we\nbuild when we installed vCenter.\n\n44\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.620\nAnd I'll just kind of type that in here,\nvcenteradministrator,\n\n45\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.114\ntoday my hands are not working\nas well as I'd like them to,\n\n46\n00:02:29.114 --> 00:02:32.905\n.local and\nthen I had my super secret password.\n\n47\n00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:36.360\nBut there is something that we\nhad before that we didn't see,\n\n48\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.100\nwhich is right here where it says,\nUse Windows session authentication.\n\n49\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.120\nThis was actually, well, grayed out.\n\n50\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.080\nNotice that it actually changed mine for\n\n51\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.070\nme to being able to use\na domain name as well.\n\n52\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.370\nThe reason why this is important is that\nyou'll find out that if you log in with\n\n53\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.559\njust the regular account that you used\nto install you can do a lot of things.\n\n54\n00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:03.598\nBut you may not actually be able to go\nin there and actually create virtual\n\n55\n00:03:03.598 --> 00:03:09.080\nmachines inside of vCenter if you\ncan't actually do something like this.\n\n56\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.070\nNow we'll find out something here that\nI don't really have it integrated in.\n\n57\n00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.342\nIf I click Login it's gonna tell\nme authentication failure and\n\n58\n00:03:16.342 --> 00:03:20.292\nthat's because I haven't linked a domain\naccount in with the management of\n\n59\n00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:22.100\nvSphere which is perfectly fine.\n\n60\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.156\nBut we did mention in this update show\npreviously though that if you haven't\n\n61\n00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:31.817\ndone that, down in the lower left\nhand corner mine has disappeared but\n\n62\n00:03:31.817 --> 00:03:37.116\nthere was a link that said Install or\ndownload that client integration plugin.\n\n63\n00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:41.623\nAnd once you download that, yes, you need\nto install it onto your computer, and\n\n64\n00:03:41.623 --> 00:03:43.413\nthere were a couple of issues and\n\n65\n00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:47.720\nthis is where it was a little\nbit frustrating to get through.\n\n66\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.800\nThe reason this didn't work\nas well previously is because\n\n67\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.230\nit worked when they actually built\nit around a particular web browser.\n\n68\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.900\nWell, Wes, a few years ago right,\nweb browsers have changed completely.\n\n69\n00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.240\nThe idea of actually using things\nlike Java as a default are not\n\n70\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.210\nreally used anymore.\n\n71\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.680\nSo a lot of things ended up breaking when\nyou started installing this particular\n\n72\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.020\ntype of a plugin because it\nreally is based around Java and\n\n73\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.250\ngiving us more functionality in\na way that you have to do this.\n\n74\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.920\nSo the only fix that I was able to do\nat one point was when you actually\n\n75\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.347\nstarted reading the documentation it says\nit worked with like Internet Explorer 6,\n\n76\n00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:30.490\n7 and 8.\n\n77\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.120\nAnd you're like, whoa, I don't want to\nput anything like that on my computer,\n\n78\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.490\nbetter yet a server, but you may have to.\n\n79\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.850\nBut the great thing is\nthat you really don't.\n\n80\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.509\nSo even though you have\nthat client download,\n\n81\n00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.939\nif it works it'll work automatically and\njust like you saw here on my screen,\n\n82\n00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:48.930\nyou'll get where it installs in.\n\n83\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.953\nAnd then you'll actually end up using\nthe Windows session authentication if\n\n84\n00:04:51.953 --> 00:04:53.450\neverything is plugged in correctly.\n\n85\n00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.510\nIf you wanna learn about that make\nsure you check out the VCP and\n\n86\n00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.160\nhow that actually ends up working.\n\n87\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.073\nBut overall though,\nthat's what you'll end up having to do.\n\n88\n00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:06.300\nIt does take a little bit of time to get\nit installed so you have to be patient.\n\n89\n00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.342\nIt's going to regenerate\na new certificate,\n\n90\n00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:10.380\nit's gonna change everything up.\n\n91\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.320\nBut when you click back in you'll see now\nthis, it will be like mine where this\n\n92\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.970\naction no longer grayed in and\nyou'll have that option to do so.\n\n93\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.970\nFor us here, I'm simply going to use the,\noops, see if I can spell administrator.\n\n94\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.170\nAdministrator.\n\n95\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.340\nThen, vsphere.local.\n\n96\n00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.110\nAnd hopefully that is the same password,\nlet me type it in just in case and\n\n97\n00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.010\nI'm going to click Login at this point to\nget access into the web client itself.\n\n98\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.437\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie in another episode,\nif you didn't check that out,\n\n99\n00:05:43.437 --> 00:05:46.316\nlet me just go back in time\nhere with my flux capacitor.\n\n100\n00:05:46.316 --> 00:05:50.498\nDid you say that during the installation\nprocess to pay attention to that user name\n\n101\n00:05:50.498 --> 00:05:53.670\nand password or you could lock\nyourself out of your box there?\n\n102\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you will.\n\n103\n00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.960\nAnd it will be very frustrating\nif you don't remember that.\n\n104\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.350\nSometimes you change this.\n\n105\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.990\nSo if you leave it at the default,\n\n106\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.060\nwhich is what most people do\njust to get it set up, and\n\n107\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.770\nthen you change over to your domain\ncredentials, which I didn't really do yet.\n\n108\n00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.840\nBut if you change over to your\ndomain credentials at that point\n\n109\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.980\nthen it should integrate in\nwith your Active Directory.\n\n110\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.690\nAnd you should be ready to go.\n\n111\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.120\nBut if you haven't, and\nyou're like me here,\n\n112\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.760\nyou just wanted to demonstrate that it\ncould be installed and it's ready to go,\n\n113\n00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.510\nthat's what we'll end up happening is\nthat you will go ahead and do this.\n\n114\n00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.190\nAnother thing that you may also try if it\ndoesn't integrate in with your default\n\n115\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.090\nbrowser, so\n\n116\n00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.510\nmine for example here is Internet\nExplorer, it didn't want to integrate in.\n\n117\n00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.670\nNo matter what I try to do\nto get it installed, but\n\n118\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.770\ntoday it's actually installed,\nafter a couple of updates that I did.\n\n119\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.040\nYou may go ahead and\ndownload maybe another browser.\n\n120\n00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.510\nSo you might try Firefox.\n\n121\n00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.250\nYou might try Chrome.\n\n122\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.927\nI was trying to think of the other one,\nChrome and\n\n123\n00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:52.301\nif you go the the VMware website then you\nlook in their knowledge base articles,\n\n124\n00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:56.500\nyou'll see buried in there,\nI know this is kind of making you dig.\n\n125\n00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.980\nBut they'll have special download links\ninstead of using the one they give you\n\n126\n00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.780\nhere on the low left hand corner.\n\n127\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.030\nMake sure go on and use those designed for\nChrome and Firefox and\n\n128\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.460\nget that specific one and\nthat should help you out as well, okay.\n\n129\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.970\nAnd then you'll just download it and\n\n130\n00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.600\nit will integrate into your web\nclient itself Let me go ahead and\n\n131\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.020\nthen now that we're here inside of\nvCenter cuz it took a little bit of time\n\n132\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.800\nbecause it was the first time I launched\nit with that client integration.\n\n133\n00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.680\nOne of the first things we want to do of\ncourse is then say, hey let's go ahead and\n\n134\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.140\nmake sure that everything\nis actually working.\n\n135\n00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.440\nSo with that client\nplug in now I can begin\n\n136\n00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.860\nto allow us to be able to\ncreate things like VMs.\n\n137\n00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.520\nBefore if you didn't have that if\nI go into host and clusters and\n\n138\n00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.540\nI have to give it a little\nbit of time here.\n\n139\n00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.150\nMy little machine's\nworking as hard as it can.\n\n140\n00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.792\nThen I go into ITProTV\ndemo as my data center.\n\n141\n00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:58.320\nNow over on the left hand side\nI have these two ESXI hosts\n\n142\n00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.650\nthat I have Which is the 46.20 and 46.21.\n\n143\n00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:09.860\nIf I select that first one, and\nI want to build a virtual machine,\n\n144\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.850\nI can select over at Related Objects here,\nand\n\n145\n00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.520\nthen I have to click on Datastores.\n\n146\n00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.620\nOnce I'm inside of Datastores, there's,\nit's kind of a little bit of hoops that\n\n147\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.130\nyou have to jump through to get everything\narranged the way that they want to.\n\n148\n00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.450\nThey don't just allow you to put\nthings wherever you want to.\n\n149\n00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.730\nYou have to kind of do them in this order.\n\n150\n00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.170\nSo then I'm going to go ahead and\nclick inside of that data center.\n\n151\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:44.330\nAnd at this point, also select Manage,\nI think, if that's the one.\n\n152\n00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.570\nIt may not be, it maybe files here,\nlet me check and verify.\n\n153\n00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.592\nYep, that's the one I wanted,\nI always get those mistake in there.\n\n154\n00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:56.370\nGo into Manage, and then Files,\nand now inside of this Datastore,\n\n155\n00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.150\nif I want to go ahead and\nadd in something, so\n\n156\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:06.020\nlet's say that I wanna\ninstall a Windows server,\n\n157\n00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.588\nor maybe even a CentOS server.\n\n158\n00:09:08.588 --> 00:09:11.860\nThat's probably gonna be easier and\nfaster for us to be able to do this.\n\n159\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:18.470\nBut I can go ahead and add in a folder,\nwhich is what you have to do first.\n\n160\n00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.710\nAnd we'll call it ISO here,\nand then click Create.\n\n161\n00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.663\nNow, that's gonna, instead of\nactually creating a folder right\n\n162\n00:09:27.663 --> 00:09:32.528\nhere on the V-center server,\nit's gonna go over to my EXXI Alpha\n\n163\n00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:37.320\nserver that I have, and\nit's gonna create a folder over there.\n\n164\n00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.390\nI'm gonna double click, and you're\ngonna see, well, this list is empty.\n\n165\n00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.410\nIf you don't have the client\nintegration tools, and\n\n166\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.140\nI'm about to find out here if it\nactually successfully installed or not.\n\n167\n00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.690\nI know it did,\n\n168\n00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:54.660\nbecause I actually got access through that\nWindows authentication box checked in.\n\n169\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.950\nBut if I didn't, when you click here,\nwhat it's going to do is not open this,\n\n170\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.181\nwhich gives you the ability to browse to\na file, and then you can load that ISO\n\n171\n00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:08.480\nin and upload that onto your server,\nand that's actually very important.\n\n172\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.450\nBecause if you can't get that happening,\nthe only thing it's gonna do is going to\n\n173\n00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.470\nsay you didn't download that\nclient installed plugin, and\n\n174\n00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.720\nthat would drive you a little bit\nbatty if you don't know that.\n\n175\n00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.302\nSo, just make sure you pay attention.\n\n176\n00:10:22.302 --> 00:10:27.147\nIf you get to this point, and it tells you\nit didn't install, key way of doing that?\n\n177\n00:10:27.147 --> 00:10:29.732\nYou don't have access to that Windows\nauthentication screen when you\n\n178\n00:10:29.732 --> 00:10:30.810\nfirst login.\n\n179\n00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.010\nSecondly, you won't get this, okay?\n\n180\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.550\nAnd you're probably saying, well Ronnie,\n\n181\n00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.740\nyou didn't actually upload\nanything in the ISO folder.\n\n182\n00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.600\nAnd that's because the two images I used\nwere gigantic, and I didn't realize it.\n\n183\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:49.170\nSo, one was a Windows Server 2012\nimage that was five gigs almost,\n\n184\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.100\nand it took a long time and then\nthe other one was a very minimal install.\n\n185\n00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.270\nSo, I just wanted to show you where\nyou could go and create this.\n\n186\n00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.750\nYou're gonna upload your ISOs in there,\nso that you can build VMs.\n\n187\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.330\nAnd if you can't do that, well, that's\nactually kind of the first step that you\n\n188\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.460\nknow then, that client integration\npackages aren't in there.\n\n189\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.950\nSwitching over to Bravo, as you see\nover here on the left-hand side.\n\n190\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.700\nNotice I've already created an ISO folder.\n\n191\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.240\nAnd now,\nif I select inside the ISO folder,\n\n192\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.519\nyou'll see the two files that I uploaded.\n\n193\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.900\nIt would lovely to say that\nthis fast as lightning.\n\n194\n00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:29.260\nThe CentOS that was only about 331,\n\n195\n00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.900\n32 megabytes I think, went like dream.\n\n196\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.550\nThe other one though right here,\n\n197\n00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.840\nabout 4.2 gigs,\nnot as quickly as I wanted it to.\n\n198\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.140\nIt actually took quite a long time.\n\n199\n00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.080\nAnd that's why we didn't wanna\nshow you that on the actual\n\n200\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.170\nshow when we start to see this.\n\n201\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:54.460\nSo, when you have something like that, and\nyou now have your ISO folder ready to go,\n\n202\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.520\nnow you can say, hey,\nI'm gonna build a virtual machine.\n\n203\n00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.590\nAnd then when you build\nthe virtual machine,\n\n204\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.830\nyou can now attach the ISO\nto that virtual machine.\n\n205\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.045\nAnd that's where we're going.\n\n206\n00:12:04.045 --> 00:12:09.433\nOkay, so at the very beginning, the\ninstall of that client integration plugin,\n\n207\n00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:14.038\nit really first of all helps you to\ntransfer files to those locations,\n\n208\n00:12:14.038 --> 00:12:18.276\nwhere you need to, so that you can\nbegin the building of the VMs.\n\n209\n00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:21.919\nThe other thing that it\ngives you the ability to do,\n\n210\n00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:26.917\nis that once you actually get your\nVMs to that point, that you need to,\n\n211\n00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:31.523\nit will also allow you to do a little\nbit of the VM console access.\n\n212\n00:12:31.523 --> 00:12:34.117\nIt's not gonna be anything really\nfancy at the beginning here, but\n\n213\n00:12:34.117 --> 00:12:36.360\nyou'll actually see, it will get better.\n\n214\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.460\nAnd then of course, you'll be able to\nconnect into those other devices that you\n\n215\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:45.940\nneed to manage, and to be able to monitor\nthose VMs, as well and the ESXI host.\n\n216\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.790\n&gt;&gt; That plugin, Ronnie,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong here,\n\n217\n00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.050\ndoesn't it help to enhance\nsecurity as well, right?\n\n218\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:52.630\n&gt;&gt; It can.\n\n219\n00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.250\nIt really does allow you, at least at\nthis point on the client end, right?\n\n220\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.930\nIs that you're supposed to use, of course,\n\n221\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.330\nthose domain credentials to\nbe able to get access in.\n\n222\n00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.520\nBut because I'm actually\nusing the local one,\n\n223\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.710\nI may be limited in\nterms of what I can do.\n\n224\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.550\nBut at the same time, we're not really\ngetting into that idea of actually\n\n225\n00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.550\nintegrating all the accounts across an\nactive directory yet, and Kerbero stuff.\n\n226\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.878\nYou can get in that, but\nwe're not doing that right now.\n\n227\n00:13:19.878 --> 00:13:23.400\nSo, once you have that in there,\nyou'll see along the way, right?\n\n228\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.344\nThat anytime you try and\ndo something, if it blocks you, and\n\n229\n00:13:26.344 --> 00:13:30.159\nautomatically leads you to try and\ndownload that client install, that client\n\n230\n00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:34.303\nplugin that I've been talking about,\nyou'll know you didn't have it installed.\n\n231\n00:13:34.303 --> 00:13:37.413\nThe key to getting it\ninstalled though is this,\n\n232\n00:13:37.413 --> 00:13:41.476\nmake sure whatever browser you choose,\nis installed first.\n\n233\n00:13:41.476 --> 00:13:45.735\nOnce you install that, even if you\nhave vCenter actually up and running,\n\n234\n00:13:45.735 --> 00:13:49.787\nand nothing else is actually working for\nyou, close it out, wherever\n\n235\n00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:54.610\nshe downloaded that file from, right-click\non it, run it as the administrator.\n\n236\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.240\nIf you're actually running it\ninside of Windows here, and\n\n237\n00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.370\nthen let it take its time.\n\n238\n00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.070\nAnd it will take a few minutes\nof time to actually run and\n\n239\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.940\ndo everything that you need to.\n\n240\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.250\nSo, don't think it's\ngonna be anything quick.\n\n241\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.540\nI had eight gigs on this virtual machine,\nand\n\n242\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.290\nit still was chugging down pretty hard.\n\n243\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.850\nSo, don't expect it to\nactually go lightning fast.\n\n244\n00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.260\nIt's gonna take a little bit of time\nin doing everything that you need.\n\n245\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.430\nA few other things that we\nalso need to make sure of,\n\n246\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.220\nremember that you do have to watch out for\nthe browser.\n\n247\n00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.260\nThe latest recommendation in version\nsix is that Internet Explorer,\n\n248\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.690\nif you're using it,\nuse at least IE ten and eleven, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.492\nAnd then if you choose Mozilla,\nat least version 30 or higher,\n\n250\n00:14:38.492 --> 00:14:41.950\nif you're doing Chrome 35 or\nhigher, more than likely,\n\n251\n00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.047\nyou're not gonna get that much in\ndepth into it on the VCA exam itself.\n\n252\n00:14:46.047 --> 00:14:48.285\nBut just realize you do\nneed to pick a browser, and\n\n253\n00:14:48.285 --> 00:14:51.803\nif that one browser doesn't work, and\nyou think that it is the browser issue,\n\n254\n00:14:51.803 --> 00:14:55.510\nif you can't install the plugin,\nand normally is a browser issue.\n\n255\n00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:59.950\nIf it is, make sure you install\nwhatever other browser you want first.\n\n256\n00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:04.841\nGo out and search for the plugin for\nthat VMware client plugin addition, or\n\n257\n00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:10.430\nwhatever it might be inside a VMware site,\nand then install that afterwards.\n\n258\n00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.815\nDon't try and install the plugin, and\nthen go I forgot to install the browser.\n\n259\n00:15:13.815 --> 00:15:16.750\nCuz it doesn't hook in until\nthe browser's actually there, so\n\n260\n00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.760\nmake sure you know that one as well, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.790\nOnce you actually get that installed,\nthe next time you actually get\n\n262\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.430\nall the services running again, which may\ntake a few moments, you may see where you\n\n263\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.490\ntry to connect in and say,\nthe VSphere client, or\n\n264\n00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:39.970\nweb client is initializing or the Vcentral\nserver is initializing, try back shortly.\n\n265\n00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.300\nIt can be a little bit\nfrustrating waiting even for\n\n266\n00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.870\nsomething like that to happen, all right?\n\n267\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.158\nSo, that's kind of the first step in\nwhat we need to at least get done,\n\n268\n00:15:49.158 --> 00:15:54.482\nis understand that in that install of that\nclient, you're normally gonna download.\n\n269\n00:15:54.482 --> 00:16:00.304\nThe other one, of course, is installing\nwhat we call the remote console.\n\n270\n00:16:00.304 --> 00:16:05.030\nThere is another utility that if\nwhat I wanted to do instead is not\n\n271\n00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.628\nonly directly manage the VM\nfrom my view center.\n\n272\n00:16:08.628 --> 00:16:16.410\nBut I also wanted to have the ability for\nWes to manage it remotely at some point.\n\n273\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.359\nSo he just launches a tool\nto be able to do that.\n\n274\n00:16:19.359 --> 00:16:23.141\nAnd install what is called\nthe VMware Remote Console.\n\n275\n00:16:23.141 --> 00:16:26.003\nIt's essentially just a standalone\napplication that we run on\n\n276\n00:16:26.003 --> 00:16:27.300\nwhatever client.\n\n277\n00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.305\nSo if Wes is on a Windows 10 machine,\nwe can actually install it there.\n\n278\n00:16:31.305 --> 00:16:36.570\nAnd it can connect back and allow him to\nopen up that VM if we have it ready to go.\n\n279\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.180\nSo let me show you where we're\nactually going to see that, too.\n\n280\n00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.250\nSo back on my screen then.\n\n281\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:48.110\nIf I'm actually inside of that\nESX Bravo server for that,\n\n282\n00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.240\nI'm gonna click on the Related Objects.\n\n283\n00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.420\nI'm gonna click on\nthe ITProTvDemo-Srv11 so\n\n284\n00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:01.280\nthat we can see the actual management\nconsole to this VM or virtual machine.\n\n285\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.020\nSo let me see if I can\nactually click on it.\n\n286\n00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:09.310\nOn mine, too.\n\n287\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.680\nLet me go over here to the left-hand\nside and then click on Virtual Machine.\n\n288\n00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.540\nThere we go, it just took a moment here.\n\n289\n00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:21.299\nAnd then I'll select Summary.\n\n290\n00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:25.480\nAnd we'll see, hopefully,\nthe information will start populating in.\n\n291\n00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.640\nThere we go,\njust a little bit at this point.\n\n292\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.010\nSo it just took me a moment.\n\n293\n00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.770\nI don't know why it wasn't clicking\nthe way that I want it to.\n\n294\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.569\nBut we'll actually see\njust a few things here.\n\n295\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.490\nAs I scroll in just a little bit,\n\n296\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:43.630\nwhat I'm wanting to do is really\nmake you focus in right down here.\n\n297\n00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:48.947\nIf I want that ability to be able\nto have a remote management.\n\n298\n00:17:48.947 --> 00:17:53.292\nI need to download this Remote Console\nto whatever machine we're\n\n299\n00:17:53.292 --> 00:17:56.370\nactually going to install this on.\n\n300\n00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.180\nAnd be able to run that\nthere to make that happen.\n\n301\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.240\nOnce you have that, then that person can\nthen launch that application that connects\n\n302\n00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.610\nover into that virtual machine.\n\n303\n00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:11.030\nAnd they should be able to manage it is\nreally what we're ending up seeing here.\n\n304\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.243\nSo it's actually a great way to be\nable to find this stuff out and\n\n305\n00:18:15.243 --> 00:18:17.161\nto be able to download that.\n\n306\n00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:20.045\nNow the key on downloading this, though,\n\n307\n00:18:20.045 --> 00:18:23.100\nis it's not just a free\ndownload right away.\n\n308\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.855\nIf you don't have a registration\ninto the VMware website,\n\n309\n00:18:28.855 --> 00:18:33.239\nyou have to create\na VMware website account.\n\n310\n00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:34.832\nAnd then you'll be able to download it.\n\n311\n00:18:34.832 --> 00:18:37.234\nAnd it gives you the ability\nto download one for a Mac.\n\n312\n00:18:37.234 --> 00:18:38.930\nAnd I think one for Linux.\n\n313\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.500\nAnd then one for Windows.\n\n314\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.174\nSo depending on which machine you're\nactually going to run this on,\n\n315\n00:18:43.174 --> 00:18:46.970\nthat's what you also end up seeing there.\n\n316\n00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.230\nSo just remember if\nthat's what's happening.\n\n317\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.120\nSo let's talk about these\nscenarios just briefly, Wes.\n\n318\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.770\nBecause if anything, on the exam,\n\n319\n00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.870\nthat's where they're gonna get you\non which tool you actually need.\n\n320\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:04.310\nIf you need to monitor and\nto be able to see some of the information.\n\n321\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.445\nFirst and foremost,\nif you're gonna be creating VMs,\n\n322\n00:19:07.445 --> 00:19:10.191\nyou gotta have that client\nintegration plugin.\n\n323\n00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:12.215\nIf that client integration\nplugin isn't there,\n\n324\n00:19:12.215 --> 00:19:13.720\nyou won't be able to do any of that.\n\n325\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.610\nIt's just gonna continue to ask\nyou to download it and install it.\n\n326\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.976\nSecondly, if you need remote\nmanagement into that machine.\n\n327\n00:19:21.976 --> 00:19:27.720\nAnd somebody like Wes is actually saying,\nI need to manage that machine.\n\n328\n00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.295\nWell, you need to actually\ndownload that remote client for\n\n329\n00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:34.880\nWes from that console that we're\nactually seeing right there.\n\n330\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.588\nAnd that way,\nwe can stick it on Wes's computer.\n\n331\n00:19:36.588 --> 00:19:39.500\nAnd he can also manage it from there, too.\n\n332\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.650\nSo it gives him that ability to do that.\n\n333\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.500\nNow, notice we haven't really\ncreated any virtual machine.\n\n334\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.150\nI already have one created here.\n\n335\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.740\nI didn't really even install anything.\n\n336\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.660\nBecause that would just take a lot\nof time when we're really just\n\n337\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.940\ntrying to get used to the information.\n\n338\n00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.880\nBut just imagine installing it,\nrunning your own ISO.\n\n339\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.400\nConnecting it up and then booting it up\nand following directions on an install.\n\n340\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.526\nThat's exactly what we've done.\n\n341\n00:20:00.526 --> 00:20:02.454\nAnd in previous episodes for\n\n342\n00:20:02.454 --> 00:20:07.850\nthe exam objectives themselves that were\nall done, we really did that before.\n\n343\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.610\nSo make sure you check those episodes out\nif you haven't been watching those so\n\n344\n00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:12.430\nthat you can install it.\n\n345\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:17.270\nBut right here, downloading that Remote\nConsole is pretty much the key to making\n\n346\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.530\nsure that everything that we actually want\nworks the way that we want to as well.\n\n347\n00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.300\nNow once we have that,\nwhat about all the other stuff?\n\n348\n00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.115\nLike monitoring and being able to\ncontrol it a little bit better.\n\n349\n00:20:29.115 --> 00:20:31.115\nBeing able to get access to it.\n\n350\n00:20:31.115 --> 00:20:34.180\nAnd making sure that everything\nworks the way that we want to.\n\n351\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.226\nNotice this yellow bar that we\nhave right here on the screen.\n\n352\n00:20:38.226 --> 00:20:42.940\nVMware Tools is not installed\non this virtual machine.\n\n353\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:49.330\nThis is where you do want to make sure\nthat you install those VMware tools.\n\n354\n00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.150\nWhen you install those VMware tools,\n\n355\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:57.370\nthis opens up a ton of different\nenhancements for your machine.\n\n356\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.090\nSome of those greatest\nenhancements are just visually.\n\n357\n00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.780\nIf you haven't worked inside of virtual\nmachine environments before like\n\n358\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.780\nhypervisors.\n\n359\n00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.524\nOne of the most frustrating things\nat the beginning is you go and\n\n360\n00:21:06.524 --> 00:21:08.740\nhover your mouse over\nthat virtual machine.\n\n361\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.690\nAnd the actual mouse is\nover here on the screen.\n\n362\n00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.440\nAnd you're actually thinking\nthat you're down here.\n\n363\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.298\nAs you start moving it, it's not\nexactly in the place that you need.\n\n364\n00:21:16.298 --> 00:21:21.240\nOr you might find out that your mouse\nis locked inside the virtual machine.\n\n365\n00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.590\nAnd you can't move your mouse\noutside of that virtual machine.\n\n366\n00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:29.267\nYou might also find out that the video\nintegration is not the way that you\n\n367\n00:21:29.267 --> 00:21:30.355\nexpect it to be.\n\n368\n00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:34.057\nWhere everything looks a little bit\nstrange on the screen and it's locked up.\n\n369\n00:21:34.057 --> 00:21:39.370\nWell, these VMware tools really do help\nyou out with things like that as well.\n\n370\n00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.430\nThe other things that it allows you to do\nis to be able to copy from your actual\n\n371\n00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.610\nhost clipboard into your virtual machine.\n\n372\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.375\nThere are a ton of different things.\n\n373\n00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:50.660\nBut some of the stuff in the background\nthat you and I don't think about.\n\n374\n00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.630\nThe ability to suspend your machine\n\n375\n00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.890\nalso comes from adding in\nthese integration tools.\n\n376\n00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:03.020\nThe ability to access a shared folder\nthat's stored on your machine and\n\n377\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.532\nthen transfer files in is\nalso part of that, too.\n\n378\n00:22:06.532 --> 00:22:11.960\nSo there's a whole list of\nenhancements that your virtual machine\n\n379\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.010\nwill be able to have as long as you\ninstall these client integration tools.\n\n380\n00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.080\nOne of the key factors here, of course,\n\n381\n00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.670\nis that it really enhances the network\nconnectivity to your virtual machine.\n\n382\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:24.690\nAnd even though you and\n\n383\n00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:29.450\nI might not see that as far as going,\nlook at the neat feature.\n\n384\n00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.480\nYou do experience it when people\ncan connect very quickly to that\n\n385\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.720\nvirtual machine.\n\n386\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.120\nAnd that everything is working as\nsmoothly as you want to as well.\n\n387\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.620\nSome of the other parts of the process,\nof course, is that when you go to shutdown\n\n388\n00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.770\nyour virtual machine or you make\nsnapshots of your virtual machines.\n\n389\n00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.770\nAll that is not possible if you don't\nhave these client integration tools\n\n390\n00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:48.370\ninstalled in.\n\n391\n00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:53.550\nSo you wanna make sure that\nyou have those VMware tools\n\n392\n00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:58.120\nactually added in at that point, too.\n\n393\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.200\nSo how do you install it?\n\n394\n00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.101\nWell, once you have your\noperating system up and running.\n\n395\n00:23:02.101 --> 00:23:06.276\nOver here on the right hand side,\nif they're not installed,\n\n396\n00:23:06.276 --> 00:23:09.110\nyou just click Install the VMware Tools.\n\n397\n00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.870\nAnd once you do that, it tells you here's\nall the other things that it does.\n\n398\n00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.167\nGraphics, mouse, storage for VM.\n\n399\n00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:18.930\nYou can mount a disk to the VMware\ntools and the DVD drive.\n\n400\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.710\nYou can do all that stuff here.\n\n401\n00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:23.907\nMine shouldn't actually mount cuz I\ndidn't really install anything in there.\n\n402\n00:23:23.907 --> 00:23:25.410\nBut it actually did mount.\n\n403\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.160\nLook at that.\n\n404\n00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.170\nIt's actually installing it on there.\n\n405\n00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.941\nBut there's no real\ninstallation process going on.\n\n406\n00:23:30.941 --> 00:23:32.940\nCuz I don't really have\nan operating system.\n\n407\n00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.485\nNormally, you would go ahead and\nboot your operating system.\n\n408\n00:23:35.485 --> 00:23:42.330\nAnd then you could open it up and\njust follow the actual install menu along.\n\n409\n00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.230\nNow inside of Linux,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n410\n00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.450\nYou may have to download a zip file.\n\n411\n00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:52.159\nAnd then use something like unzip or\nsomething like that to actually do that.\n\n412\n00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:56.614\nAnd then, of course,\nsome bash command line stuff to be able to\n\n413\n00:23:56.614 --> 00:23:59.907\nactually unzip the actual\nVMware tools into.\n\n414\n00:23:59.907 --> 00:24:04.571\nYour virtual machine usually\nrequires a reboot after that and\n\n415\n00:24:04.571 --> 00:24:09.335\nthen your machine actually is\nvery much an enhanced type of VM.\n\n416\n00:24:09.335 --> 00:24:13.631\nAll right, if everything is\nactually installed into that VM,\n\n417\n00:24:13.631 --> 00:24:18.735\nnow notice that over here on the right\nhand side, you'll see that there's\n\n418\n00:24:18.735 --> 00:24:24.570\na bunch of different things like\nCPU USAGE, MEMORY USAGE, STORAGE USAGE.\n\n419\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.330\nAll that will become live for\n\n420\n00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:31.010\nus, and even some of the other things,\nif I go over to monitor.\n\n421\n00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.749\nYou'll be able to follow and\ntrack each virtual machine's issues,\n\n422\n00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:42.330\nperformance, if they actually have graphs\nand information, because the VMWare tools\n\n423\n00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.860\nwill be able to actually add that\ninformation in there for you.\n\n424\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:51.193\nTask and utilization, all of this stuff\nis actually what we'll begin to populate.\n\n425\n00:24:51.193 --> 00:24:52.587\nAnd you'll see right here,\n\n426\n00:24:52.587 --> 00:24:56.015\nyou'll see some of it populated but\nnot a lot of information going on,\n\n427\n00:24:56.015 --> 00:24:59.990\nbecause this particular machine\nreally isn't doing anything.\n\n428\n00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.248\nBut that's some of the stuff\nthat you will be able to see.\n\n429\n00:25:02.248 --> 00:25:06.242\nWhether it's CPU or memory or whatever it\nmight be, those are some of the things\n\n430\n00:25:06.242 --> 00:25:10.356\nyou'll actually be able to do because you\nhave those VMware additions in there and\n\n431\n00:25:10.356 --> 00:25:13.800\neverything is in installed\nthe way that you want to.\n\n432\n00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.580\nThe key aspect of this also then\nis making sure that you're a host.\n\n433\n00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:25.240\nOnce you're actually in here, such as\nthe ESXI, you'll also be able to monitor\n\n434\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:30.870\nthat through the monitoring tab and\nyou'll see performance issues here too.\n\n435\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.190\nSo, if there's actually different\nthings that are happening, so\n\n436\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:37.580\nthese are loaded in the background,\nwith that client integration services.\n\n437\n00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.770\nSo here's an example of some of\nthe information you might see,\n\n438\n00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:45.360\nthe virtual disk and the swap files,\nmultiple virtual machines running,\n\n439\n00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.500\nyou'll be able to see all\nthis information as well.\n\n440\n00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.490\nSo, the addition of these software and\nthese tools, they make it very effective\n\n441\n00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:59.070\nthen for you not only to run virtual\nmachines, which is the primary task,\n\n442\n00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:03.550\nof course, of VMware, but to be able\nto control them or to monitor them for\n\n443\n00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:07.380\ntheir performance and for everything else\nthat we need if we have to keep some type\n\n444\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.250\nof historical track of the way that that\nmachine is performing, just in case we\n\n445\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.600\nneed to move those VMs to another\nmachine so it doesn't overload one.\n\n446\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.598\nSo there's always context and scenarios in\nwhich you'd use all this information and\n\n447\n00:26:19.598 --> 00:26:24.340\nbut just kinda realize that it begins with\nthe integration of those different tools.\n\n448\n00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:28.384\nWhether we're talking about\nthe client integration plugin or\n\n449\n00:26:28.384 --> 00:26:33.341\nwhether we're talking about that remote,\nthat VM ware remote connection,\n\n450\n00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:36.714\nremote console,\nI'm gonna get this right one day.\n\n451\n00:26:36.714 --> 00:26:41.046\nAnd then of course the actual VMware\ntools, all of those are actually great\n\n452\n00:26:41.046 --> 00:26:45.860\ntools that will help enhance the way that\nyou manage of course the host themselves,\n\n453\n00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.910\nas well as the actual\nindividual virtual machines.\n\n454\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie, I could see where another\nscenario where you might use these graphs,\n\n455\n00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.630\nmaybe if I'm doing a performance baseline,\nI kinda want to see where my server is at\n\n456\n00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.365\nrelative to where my\nhost is at at the time.\n\n457\n00:26:57.365 --> 00:26:59.292\nSo it looks like a lot\nof great information and\n\n458\n00:26:59.292 --> 00:27:01.583\nspeaking of great information,\nthank you for that.\n\n459\n00:27:01.583 --> 00:27:04.777\nIt does look like we are running\na little bit short on time Ronnie, but\n\n460\n00:27:04.777 --> 00:27:08.302\nbefore we sign out, do you got any\nadditional thoughts that you might like to\n\n461\n00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:11.078\nimpart to our viewers when it\ncomes to monitoring your VMs.\n\n462\n00:27:11.078 --> 00:27:15.142\n&gt;&gt; Probably just like every other show\nthat I've done for the entire series here\n\n463\n00:27:15.142 --> 00:27:18.703\nand not just for the update,\nI've mentioned the idea, of course,\n\n464\n00:27:18.703 --> 00:27:23.630\nof making sure that you get in there and\nthat you are able to see this information.\n\n465\n00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.245\nIt's not so much that a VCA6\nis gonna be challenging and\n\n466\n00:27:26.245 --> 00:27:28.091\nexpecting you to do all of that, okay?\n\n467\n00:27:28.091 --> 00:27:30.820\nThat's where you're\ngonna get into the VCP.\n\n468\n00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:35.410\nBut you do need to feel familiar and\nconfident that you can navigate around\n\n469\n00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:40.380\nin it, so that they do ask you questions\nabout what particular tool is necessary,\n\n470\n00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.160\nespecially at this point,\nto get what you're expecting to see,\n\n471\n00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.780\nyou gotta know those tools.\n\n472\n00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.614\nAnd the only way you'll be able\nto understand that and see that,\n\n473\n00:27:48.614 --> 00:27:50.608\nof course,\nis if you actually get in there and\n\n474\n00:27:50.608 --> 00:27:52.935\nplay around with it when you\nhave the chance to do so.\n\n475\n00:27:52.935 --> 00:27:55.630\nIn a production environment,\nyou don't have the chance to play anymore,\n\n476\n00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.100\nyou're actually getting\nthings set up to do.\n\n477\n00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.563\nSo now as you're studying for\nthe exam, and you're getting familiar,\n\n478\n00:28:01.563 --> 00:28:04.478\ngreat chance to break things and\nthen to fix them on your own.\n\n479\n00:28:04.478 --> 00:28:07.470\nAnd you'll actually end up seeing\nthat you'll be the better for it.\n\n480\n00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:08.257\n&gt;&gt; Words of wisdom-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n481\n00:28:08.257 --> 00:28:09.577\n&gt;&gt; From Mr. Ronnie Wong, practice,\n\n482\n00:28:09.577 --> 00:28:10.460\npractice, practice.\n\n483\n00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.400\nWell as always, Ronnie, it's a pleasure\nhaving you in the studios with us.\n\n484\n00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.480\nAnd it's a pleasure having you,\nthe viewers, watching.\n\n485\n00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.351\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n486\n00:28:18.351 --> 00:28:19.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n487\n00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.369\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n488\n00:28:20.369 -->

00:00:12.098\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n4\n00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:15.270\nwelcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.780\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.400\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe are continuing through our VCA6 DCV.\n\n7\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.520\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\nthis very endeavor, is none other than Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.210\nRonnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.440\nRonnie, how you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.942\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, thank you for having\nme back on the show, as we continue on to\n\n11\n00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:35.104\ntake a look at some of the other things\nwe can do inside of the vCenter, and\n\n12\n00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:39.266\nvSphere and, of course, the ESXi host\nthat we have to really kind of host\n\n13\n00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.693\neverything in terms of virtualization.\n\n14\n00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:46.517\nAnd, we're at this point where we need to\nunderstand what we actually need to do\n\n15\n00:00:46.517 --> 00:00:51.125\nwell, with virtual machine operations\nmore than anything else that we have\n\n16\n00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:52.289\nthe ability to do.\n\n17\n00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.798\nAnd that means controlling\nthe virtual machines,\n\n18\n00:00:54.798 --> 00:00:57.949\nunderstanding their different\nstates that we're gonna see and\n\n19\n00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.440\nof course even installing the operating\nsystem into the virtual machine as well.\n\n20\n00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.360\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in as I\nswitch the context up just a little bit\n\n21\n00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.410\nto help us out here to see this.\n\n22\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.960\nSo, on my machine we'll actually see\nthe lab setup that I've got here.\n\n23\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.290\nNow, the great thing is if you've,\na member here at ITProTV,\n\n24\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.870\nyou also have access\nto these labs as well.\n\n25\n00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.910\nAnd this one is essentially\nvery important to us.\n\n26\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.040\nAnd the reason why it's actually very\nimportant is it gives you that ability to\n\n27\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.840\nhave a hands-on lab without you having to\ngo through all the incredible setup that\n\n28\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.810\nI had to do just to do a little\nbit of the demonstration.\n\n29\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.540\nAnd that way,\n\n30\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.140\nespecially on the more technical side\nof things in terms of seeing and\n\n31\n00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.740\nviewing, instead of just talking about\ninformation, you'll see it right here.\n\n32\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.050\nAnd you'll also able to be able to\njust work with it a little bit more,\n\n33\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.280\neven if you don't have a ton\nof different machines.\n\n34\n00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.537\nIf you take a look on left-hand side,\nyou can see it requires a bit,\n\n35\n00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:55.184\ndomain controller and\nof course a management server.\n\n36\n00:01:55.184 --> 00:02:00.207\nAnd this one actually has three different\nEXSi servers as well as a storage\n\n37\n00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:05.730\nappliance, like a virtual SAN, as well\nas of course an application server too.\n\n38\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.157\nNow you don't have to have everything\nthere, but that's set up for\n\n39\n00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:10.130\na full lab for VCP.\n\n40\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.786\nBut we're just using a portion of\nit to demonstrate what we need to,\n\n41\n00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:17.956\nwhen we start talking about the idea\nof operating task, using our for\n\n42\n00:02:17.956 --> 00:02:20.200\nyour web client ahead of us here.\n\n43\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.780\nAnd of course, understanding the virtual\nmachines and the management of them.\n\n44\n00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.050\nSo as we start to take a look at the\nmanagement of virtual machines inside of\n\n45\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.820\nthe navigator, the object navigator, I'm\ngoing to select vCenter inventory list.\n\n46\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.290\nAnd because we're really specifically\nfocusing on virtual machines,\n\n47\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.750\nthat makes sense,\nI'm going to select Virtual Machines.\n\n48\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.160\nAnd you'll see I have two different\nvirtual machines and I went ahead and\n\n49\n00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.010\npowered them both up.\n\n50\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.960\nThe reason I powered them both up is I\nwanted you to see one of the indicators\n\n51\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.245\nthat we actually want to take\na look at which is right here,\n\n52\n00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:00.450\nin this little green arrow.\n\n53\n00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.450\nWhen we start taking a look at\nthe idea of green a lot of times,\n\n54\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.960\nit means that it's ready and\nit's actually going.\n\n55\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.720\nAnd that everything is actually\nthe way that we wanted it to be.\n\n56\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.940\nMost of the time on virtual machines\ninside of this type of environment if\n\n57\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.350\nthey're servers, we normally don't\nwanna see red servers anywhere, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.140\nIf it is a client, probably it's okay.\n\n59\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.990\nBut overall though,\n\n60\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.070\njust kind of realize if they're servers\nthey're generally gonna be down.\n\n61\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.430\nThere are times though,\n\n62\n00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.460\nwhen you do need to make sure that you\nhave the virtual machines not only up and\n\n63\n00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.618\nready to go, but you also need to\nstop the virtual machines, too.\n\n64\n00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:39.990\nWell, if you selected inside of\nthe inventory list, Virtual Machines,\n\n65\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.400\nand you have your listing of them, notice\nthat they show us the objects listed here\n\n66\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.170\nin this view, where the normal\nstatus is actually right here, and\n\n67\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.630\nthe complete state right\nnow is powered on too.\n\n68\n00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.820\nI can select let's say\nthe idea of the WinClient, and\n\n69\n00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.130\nthen at the top, I have a red button,\nand it gives you a little screen tip.\n\n70\n00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.450\nSo this is, I'm not showing you\nanything that you probably don't\n\n71\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.100\nalready understand just from\nusing different buttons here.\n\n72\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.150\nBut this of course indicates a shut\ndown or a power off state too.\n\n73\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.180\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, about that power off state.\n\n74\n00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.930\nIs this almost equivalent\nto a cold boot or\n\n75\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.530\nI guess a cold power off where,\nI'm just reaching over and\n\n76\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.780\nI'm essentially pressing the virtualized\npower button on whatever the device is.\n\n77\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would be just like\nyour desktop computer where you're\n\n78\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.600\nyanking the actual power cord\nout of the back of the computer.\n\n79\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.976\nNow Wes,\nsince you're actually our hardware guy,\n\n80\n00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:35.648\nwhat are some of the issues that can go\non when somebody's, let's say working or\n\n81\n00:04:35.648 --> 00:04:38.187\nsaving information and\nwe just yank the power cord out?\n\n82\n00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:41.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the first thing I think of\nis everything in RAM is gone, so\n\n83\n00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:44.060\nanything like you said that\nwe're working on that's gone.\n\n84\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.360\nThe other thing I think about is not so\nmuch disk read operations,\n\n85\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.190\nis I think of write operations and\n\n86\n00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.700\nI know that that's maybe on my\ndesktop that's not so critical.\n\n87\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.650\nBut I can only imagine if you have\nthese virtual machines running and\n\n88\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.910\nthey're running something like a SQL\ndatabase that's maintaining a transaction\n\n89\n00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.030\nlog, that that's probably\na pretty bad day at the office.\n\n90\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.640\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n91\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.910\nSo, normally they don't recommend,\nof course,\n\n92\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.470\nthat you would use this idea\nof just stopping the power.\n\n93\n00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.340\nCuz it is equivalent to\nthe idea of yanking the power.\n\n94\n00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.370\nNormally that is our last option,\nif we are to do anything.\n\n95\n00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.890\nIf you do this, you do not actually allow\nthe operating system also to shut down to\n\n96\n00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.420\nfinish doing all the right operation,\nlike what Wes told us about here.\n\n97\n00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.140\nAnd of course,\nthat means the operating system,\n\n98\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.240\nif there's anything in the background\nthat's changing in that operating system,\n\n99\n00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.070\neven if it's a half change, guess what?\n\n100\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.130\nIt's still a half change.\n\n101\n00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.920\nAnd that can lead to corruption of the way\nthat the operating system begins to work\n\n102\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.200\nand fragmentation.\n\n103\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.790\nAnd those are keys that we\nreally don't want going on.\n\n104\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.590\nSo, it's very important that we\nunderstand that this button,\n\n105\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.180\neven though it's useful to stop it,\nit's probably not our first option that\n\n106\n00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.430\nwe should go with whenever we think about\nthe idea of stopping a virtual machine.\n\n107\n00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the things that I was\nthinking about that you've mentioned\n\n108\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.430\nin other episodes,\nheck even in some other courses\n\n109\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.720\nis that it doesn't allow you to perform\nthat legendary graceful shutdown, right?\n\n110\n00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.080\nAnd that can be a problem.\n\n111\n00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.432\n&gt;&gt; And as much as that's a problem,\n\n112\n00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:08.472\nit is a good problem to have\nas far as graceful shut downs.\n\n113\n00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:12.624\nSo the recommendation, if you're not used\nto working in a virtual environment is not\n\n114\n00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:15.464\nto come in here and\nhit the actual stop button like we said.\n\n115\n00:06:15.464 --> 00:06:20.162\nBut to go through that idea of that\ngraceful shut down where you're inside\n\n116\n00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:25.241\nthe operating system and you're either\nissuing the shut down command itself or\n\n117\n00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:28.830\ninside of Windows you're\ngoing to the Windows button.\n\n118\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.140\nAnd then, of course, looking for the power\nbutton and the option to shut down.\n\n119\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.490\nAnd that is telling the operating system,\nhey, whatever you're doing go ahead and\n\n120\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.190\nfinish all that stuff up and\nif you've seen this,\n\n121\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.530\nespecially when the machine's busy, right,\n\n122\n00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.798\nespecially in Windows it tells you,\nhey I'm performing an operation.\n\n123\n00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:49.140\nI'm not gonna let you\nshut down until what,\n\n124\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.960\nI finish performing\nthe operation I need to.\n\n125\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.360\nI know it sounds a little bit weird but,\nit really is actually\n\n126\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.520\nbeneficial to allow for those operations\nto finish doing what it's doing,\n\n127\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.700\nrather than even saying, hey,\nI don't care what it's doing.\n\n128\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.685\nShut it off immediately.\n\n129\n00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:07.970\nBecause it may be an important\nthat some of it's actually, or\n\n130\n00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.700\nmay be very important that\nit finished what it's doing.\n\n131\n00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.470\nI'm gonna get those words in the right\norder at some point in time.\n\n132\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.230\nSo just make sure you pay attention there.\n\n133\n00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.630\nSo always better.\n\n134\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.060\nMake sure that even in\na virtual environment,\n\n135\n00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.950\nshut down button they give you an option.\n\n136\n00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.850\nNot exactly our first option.\n\n137\n00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.210\nNot something that we really\nwant to have happen here.\n\n138\n00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.148\n&gt;&gt; Ronny, so have green means good.\n\n139\n00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:33.405\nGreen means go, that's what we usually\nwanna see on all of our servers or\n\n140\n00:07:33.405 --> 00:07:34.515\nour devices.\n\n141\n00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:38.385\nRed is stop, or well it could be bad\ndepending on how we implement it.\n\n142\n00:07:38.385 --> 00:07:40.415\nAre there any other states\nthat you might see?\n\n143\n00:07:40.415 --> 00:07:44.605\nAre there any other maybe color indicators\nthat we might need to be aware of if I\n\n144\n00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:46.465\nopen up this interface and I wanna use it?\n\n145\n00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:49.403\n&gt;&gt; Well like always, right,\njust like the idea of traffic signals,\n\n146\n00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:50.510\nit works in the same way.\n\n147\n00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.166\nThere is a yellowish color\nthat you can also have.\n\n148\n00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:56.440\nSo I'm gonna do something I said,\nI wasn't gonna do,\n\n149\n00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.366\nwhich is of course stop a machine And\nit gives me this option here.\n\n150\n00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:03.572\nIt says hey,\ncannot shut down is not running this,\n\n151\n00:08:03.572 --> 00:08:05.960\ndo you wanna just power it off.\n\n152\n00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.945\nSo I'm just gonna start here by\nsimply powering off the machine, so\n\n153\n00:08:09.945 --> 00:08:14.702\nit's telling me there's no graceful shut\ndown for this thing and I get impatient.\n\n154\n00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:21.000\nNow you'll start to see, now they just\nyank the actual power to that machine.\n\n155\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.850\nAnd now if I come in and I realize hey,\n\n156\n00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:28.370\nthat machine's supposed to be on, I can\nsimply start by using the power on here.\n\n157\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.870\nAnd when we do so, it'll start\ngoing through some transitions and\n\n158\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.030\nthis one came up immediately.\n\n159\n00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.530\nBut if it didn't, you'll actually see\na little yellow icon that's telling you,\n\n160\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.920\nwait before you do anything.\n\n161\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.350\nPatience is not my key but\nbecause this one just shut down,\n\n162\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.860\nit was able to come back\nup also very quickly too.\n\n163\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.880\nAnd part of that reason is because they do\nhave that cluster going in the background,\n\n164\n00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.070\nthat VSAN, that allows it to actually\nmove very quickly through this but\n\n165\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.140\nif it didn't, you also see that option.\n\n166\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.670\nNow, here's one that I can't\nreally show you right now.\n\n167\n00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.930\nBut notice that there's\nalso a restart guest\n\n168\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.720\noperating systems of\nthe selected virtual machine.\n\n169\n00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.620\nAnd this one is not available.\n\n170\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.730\nThe reason why it's not available,\n\n171\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.755\nI don't have those VMware tools\ninstalled in that virtual machine.\n\n172\n00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:14.590\n[INAUDIBLE] What,\nis that really what's hindering it?\n\n173\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.218\nThat's exactly what's hindering\nthis button from showing up.\n\n174\n00:09:17.218 --> 00:09:20.038\nBut this is a green and\nred button, so look,\n\n175\n00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:25.144\nI don't need to just shut this thing down,\nI need it to do a graceful shutdown but\n\n176\n00:09:25.144 --> 00:09:30.030\nthen automatically, gracefully also,\nrestart the machine too.\n\n177\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.790\nAnd so, if this icon is lit up that's\nwhat it also gives you that ability to do\n\n178\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.590\nis to do everything else that you need to.\n\n179\n00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.010\nSome other neat features up\nhere since we're here and\n\n180\n00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:44.390\nwe're just talking anyways is the button\nnext to that, as we hover over it it says,\n\n181\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.580\nMigrate the VM to another\ncomputer resource or datastore.\n\n182\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.420\nIf you realize let's say for example,\n\n183\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.980\nthe first datastore that you built these\nvirtual machines on is now small and\n\n184\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.020\nyou start taking a look at\nthe disc I/O on that machine.\n\n185\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.180\nYou'll realize its incredibly high.\n\n186\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.180\nWell you can go and\nfind your other VMs that you have not VMs,\n\n187\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.550\nyour ESX host that you have out there.\n\n188\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.090\nAnd you might find out that\nthere's another machine\n\n189\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.070\nthat may actually not be as over taxed.\n\n190\n00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.890\nAnd you can migrate that information\nover there if everything's set up.\n\n191\n00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.680\nSo realize that there is a lot\nof functionality that's built in\n\n192\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.620\nto just these icons that we\nare seeing right here as well.\n\n193\n00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.260\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, now with the migration I know\nthis is probably not something that you\n\n194\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.030\nreally need to know for VCA,\nI'm sure it would probably be in the VCP.\n\n195\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.410\nCan your ESXi host,\ncan they perform a live migration?\n\n196\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.070\nSo If I did notice that or\nmaybe I notice something's failing and\n\n197\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.070\nI need to move it over\ncan I do live migrations?\n\n198\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, as long as everything\nis actually there to do so.\n\n199\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.410\nYou normally have to manage it of course,\n\n200\n00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.700\nthrough something like the vSphere,\nvCenter.\n\n201\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.660\nSomething we call VMotion\nis pretty much the key\n\n202\n00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.720\nto making sure that\nsomething like that happens.\n\n203\n00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.190\nIt's as close to live time as we really\nget but it does required a super\n\n204\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:03.490\nhigh speed network in the background if we\ndon't want to drop any real connections.\n\n205\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:07.000\nSo by doing something like that you\nmight find yourself as migrating over.\n\n206\n00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.460\nIt might drop a single ping.\n\n207\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.450\nA lot of times it doesn't\neven drop a single ping.\n\n208\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:16.270\nAnd the reason why is that those machines\nthat are connected together in a virtual\n\n209\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.740\nenvironment, normally require\na 10 gigabit backplane at least\n\n210\n00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.580\nbetween those machines to\nmake it actually work.\n\n211\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.370\nSo VMotion is very great stuff,\n\n212\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.480\nbut just kinda realize that it's all\nbuilt into this tool right here.\n\n213\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.000\nAnd so the more that you\nfamiliarize yourself with this,\n\n214\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.690\nthe better off you're gonna be, especially\nwhen you start talking about operating\n\n215\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.370\nthe virtual machines themselves and\nmanaging them as well.\n\n216\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.270\n&gt;&gt; So I could see the answer could\nbe yes and no on that one Ronnie,\n\n217\n00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.350\nas long as you have\nthe infrastructure to support it,\n\n218\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.480\nthen maybe on your critical systems,\nyou might notice a little hiccup but\n\n219\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.380\nif it's a non critical system,\nthen you might not notice at all.\n\n220\n00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n221\n00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.940\nIt really is about those\ndifferent systems and whether or\n\n222\n00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.850\nnot you have everything set up correctly.\n\n223\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.480\nBut once they are, you can migrate.\n\n224\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.310\nNow even if you don't, you can still\nmigrate over but it won't be live.\n\n225\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.590\n&gt;&gt; So, it will shut down the machine,\nmove it over and then,\n\n226\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.780\nyou can also tell it of course\nto actually turn back on too.\n\n227\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.030\nNow speaking of that inside of course,\nof the actual for\n\n228\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.550\nyour web client, we also have the ability\nto do a little bit of programming,\n\n229\n00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:22.360\nespecially with a management that were to\npower management inside of the VMs too.\n\n230\n00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.101\nNow what do I mean by\nsomething like that as well?\n\n231\n00:12:25.101 --> 00:12:30.599\nWell we can actually take a VM and\nconfigure it to actually start up or\n\n232\n00:12:30.599 --> 00:12:34.370\nshut down along with\nthe idea of the ESXi host.\n\n233\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.480\nToo many vowels or too many s's and\n\n234\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.120\nx's, whatever it might be\nit's just killing me okay?\n\n235\n00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.760\nAnd this is very important.\n\n236\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.050\nI remember some of the first times\nthat I actually ended up dealing\n\n237\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.990\ninside of a virtual environment and\nthere's a clustered environment\n\n238\n00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.930\nthat we didn't have everything\nsetup the way that we needed to.\n\n239\n00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.970\nSo when we ended up losing power,\n\n240\n00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.150\neven though we had UPS\nsystems on those machines.\n\n241\n00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:05.600\nAfter about ten or 15 minutes,\nwe were able to get all the machines\n\n242\n00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.480\nkinda pop back up the way that we\nneeded to as far as the host go.\n\n243\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.910\nBut we found our that certain\nVMs didn't start back up and\n\n244\n00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.240\nother VMs did start back up.\n\n245\n00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.341\nAnd there comes a point where you've got\nto realize that especially in a domain\n\n246\n00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:24.415\nenvironment, certain order of things\nhave to actually be considered here.\n\n247\n00:13:24.415 --> 00:13:28.640\nSo, let me kinda give you a very good for\ninstance of how I sort of learned about\n\n248\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.600\nthis too, is inside of working\nwith Microsoft Exchange.\n\n249\n00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.070\nIf you bring up a Microsoft Exchange\nServer inside of a domain setting which is\n\n250\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.640\nnormally what most of\nus end up doing here.\n\n251\n00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.080\nYou've got to make sure that domain,\n\n252\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.820\nespecially the domain controller with\nDNS is already going and operating and\n\n253\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.590\nfully functional before you bring\nthat exchange server up and running.\n\n254\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.440\nIf you don't,\ndoesn't mean it's not gonna function.\n\n255\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.540\nWell, pretty much so, okay.\n\n256\n00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.240\nIt doesn't mean it can't function.\n\n257\n00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.630\nBut the idea of actually being able\nto get someplace by using the email\n\n258\n00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:10.510\nserver's name is not gonna work So\nthere are a few different things.\n\n259\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.670\nWell, what if you\nvirtualize everything and\n\n260\n00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.720\nnow you have everything starting\nup at exactly the same time?\n\n261\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.800\nWhen you have something like that,\nit could be that the exchange server\n\n262\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.890\nstarts up and gets started running\nbefore your domain controller does.\n\n263\n00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.710\nNow that's where we're actually\nin a hassle and in trouble.\n\n264\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.030\nSo the great thing is inside\nof this vSphere console,\n\n265\n00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.920\nwe have this ability to set\nup a start up sequence for\n\n266\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.370\nthe order in which virtual machines\ncan essentially be started up.\n\n267\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.600\nSo we also want to make sure we take\na look at something like that as well.\n\n268\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.870\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n269\n00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.344\nI'm going to select this WinClient.\n\n270\n00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:54.660\nOver here for a just moment just as\nan example at what we can take a look at.\n\n271\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.230\nAnd once I select that, notice that the\ncontext inside of the work environment,\n\n272\n00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.720\nthe main work area here in the center.\n\n273\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:08.039\nIf I select Manage and then Settings,\nunderneath VM Options.\n\n274\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.620\nNotice that there is Power\nmanagement right here.\n\n275\n00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.568\nSo if I click Edit, let's see if I\ncan scroll out just a little bit.\n\n276\n00:15:19.823 --> 00:15:22.541\nAnd then select VM Options again.\n\n277\n00:15:25.946 --> 00:15:29.019\nMake sure I click on that drop down,\nnotice that it says,\n\n278\n00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:31.080\nhow can the virtual machine respond?\n\n279\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:39.150\nHow should the virtual machine respond\nwhen the guest OS is suspended.\n\n280\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.230\nTo suspend the virtual machine or to put\nthe guest OS in the standby mode and\n\n281\n00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.820\nleave the virtual machine,\nwake on LAN, you name it.\n\n282\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.690\nSo, I can actually tell it\nwhat the standby mode is.\n\n283\n00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.281\nIf my internal in other words,\nif the guest OS supports wake on LAN,\n\n284\n00:15:54.281 --> 00:15:56.613\nnotice I can even do a wake on LAN but\n\n285\n00:15:56.613 --> 00:16:01.628\nif you're a guest OS that doesn't\nsupport it It doesn't really matter.\n\n286\n00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:04.374\nThe fancy boot option is also the key, and\n\n287\n00:16:04.374 --> 00:16:08.220\nthis is what I was talking about here,\ntoo.\n\n288\n00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.360\nRemember, I talked about\nthe idea of a delay.\n\n289\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.590\nThis is where I might say I want my\ndomain controller to have no delay,\n\n290\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.510\nwhen it actually boots up here.\n\n291\n00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.821\nSo whichever machine is powered on or\nreset, set the boot order four.\n\n292\n00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:26.390\nAnd I might say in milliseconds here for\nthe domain controller.\n\n293\n00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.430\nOnce the actual ESX host comes up,\ngo ahead and\n\n294\n00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.320\nstart booting that thing back up.\n\n295\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.260\nAnd then I might issue out a delay for\na lot of milliseconds\n\n296\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:41.490\nbefore I actually bring up the Exchange\nServer what I was talking about.\n\n297\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.890\nAnd this will really help out especially\nwhen you need the sequence and\n\n298\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.690\nthe order of things to do\nwhat you need to do as well.\n\n299\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.710\nSo there are some different options\nthat you want to make sure that you pay\n\n300\n00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:58.010\nattention to when you start to take a look\nat something like those options available.\n\n301\n00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.851\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, one of the things that I've\nnoticed is when a sync client base server\n\n302\n00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:02.450\nwent down.\n\n303\n00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.271\nA little bit different of a scenario, but\nwhen it finally went back on everybody was\n\n304\n00:17:06.271 --> 00:17:10.360\nauthenticating at one time, and\nit was just overburdening that server.\n\n305\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.830\nSpeaking of overburdening, if you have\na lot of VMs on this single server,\n\n306\n00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:18.480\nwould this delay help in the performance\nof the host itself and not overburdening\n\n307\n00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.670\nthe host by all of those virtual\nmachines spinning up at the same time?\n\n308\n00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.130\nOr is this really just more\nabout setting the sequence\n\n309\n00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.820\nin something like a domain environment.\n\n310\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.210\n&gt;&gt; This is a little bit more\nabout setting the sequence.\n\n311\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.610\nBut yes, it can be used in\nthat particular situation\n\n312\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:35.890\nif you're really worried about the idea of\nsomething getting overtaxed immediately.\n\n313\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.080\nThe great thing about most of those\nsituations is that they normally happen,\n\n314\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.650\nthey spike, but\nthen they settle down pretty quickly.\n\n315\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.750\nBut if you have an older machine,\nit may be something you want to take into\n\n316\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.240\nconsideration as well, and you might\nwant to think about something like that.\n\n317\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.412\nBecause a lot of times you don't and\n\n318\n00:17:52.412 --> 00:17:56.405\nthat's where you have to really\njust take a brief moment in time.\n\n319\n00:17:56.405 --> 00:18:00.964\nMake sure that everything is actually set\nup the way that you want to get everything\n\n320\n00:18:00.964 --> 00:18:02.570\ndone, okay?\n\n321\n00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.134\nSo we have that real big ability to\nmake sure that we can setup those delay\n\n322\n00:18:07.134 --> 00:18:11.486\norders that we want, making sure\nthat everything is set up as well.\n\n323\n00:18:11.486 --> 00:18:13.597\nNow if you're in a high\navailability cluster,\n\n324\n00:18:13.597 --> 00:18:16.200\nthis is something I have to make\nsure that I point out here.\n\n325\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.090\nI wanna make sure this is\nnot normally available\n\n326\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.900\nin the VM if there's a high\navailability cluster.\n\n327\n00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.528\nSo the ability for us to set up some type\nof sequence like what we're talking about\n\n328\n00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:30.013\nhere may not actually be available\nif you have that cluster.\n\n329\n00:18:30.013 --> 00:18:34.052\nSo don't try and look for it and get\neverything managed the way that you want\n\n330\n00:18:34.052 --> 00:18:38.010\nto, it's probably not gonna\nhappen that way very quickly.\n\n331\n00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.970\nAll right, we wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at,\n\n332\n00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.690\nwell some other options especially with\nthis idea of power management as well.\n\n333\n00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.350\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine.\n\n334\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.120\nAll right, let's go ahead and take a look\nat some of the other options when we\n\n335\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.130\ntalked about a sequence specifically\non what we can do here.\n\n336\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:58.940\nI'm going to navigate right back\nover into of course the home area.\n\n337\n00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.440\nFrom there,\nI need to get into one of the ESX hosts.\n\n338\n00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.620\nAnd the way that I do that is\nI select host and clusters and\n\n339\n00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.740\nat this point,\nI'm gonna actually select my ESX host.\n\n340\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.930\nAnd you'll see, it's got actually\na little yellow warning sign.\n\n341\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:18.122\nAnd this is actually from a couple of\ndifferent things that could have happened.\n\n342\n00:19:18.122 --> 00:19:20.903\nNot so\nmuch that you need to know this, but\n\n343\n00:19:20.903 --> 00:19:26.228\nnormally what has happened is either\nthe vCenter server itself has rebooted and\n\n344\n00:19:26.228 --> 00:19:30.283\neven though it's connected\nthe actual ESXi host is saying,\n\n345\n00:19:30.283 --> 00:19:35.690\nI see somebody's connecting but\nI can't really verify the connection.\n\n346\n00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:40.010\nOr it's the other way,\nthe very fact that ESXi host itself\n\n347\n00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.530\nmay have actually been up or\ndropped and it came back up.\n\n348\n00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:49.070\nAnd that's probably more likely as\nthe actual virtual field server or\n\n349\n00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.690\nthe vCenter server it has\ntried to connect back.\n\n350\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.010\nSo it saw it and it lost it and now it's\nnot reporting back that everything is\n\n351\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.960\nactually good, but\nwe're still able to access this.\n\n352\n00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.550\nSo we're gonna use it for right now.\n\n353\n00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:06.620\nSo once I select that ESXi host,\nwhat I want to do is underneath where\n\n354\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:12.280\nit says settings here,\nyou'll actually see the second option.\n\n355\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:17.160\nLet me see if I can scroll in where\nit says VM startup and shutdown.\n\n356\n00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.250\nAnd this will allow you to actually\nbe able to say what the order is and\n\n357\n00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.950\nwhat we should do.\n\n358\n00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.830\nIf the host is part of a high availability\ncluster though it's not gonna be\n\n359\n00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.400\navailable.\n\n360\n00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.750\nSo that's something that\nI had just emphasize.\n\n361\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.300\nBut I didn't show you exactly where\nthat setting actually is for right now.\n\n362\n00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:35.960\nI click Edit.\n\n363\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.210\nAnd now at this point,\nlet' see if we can scroll over here and\n\n364\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.470\nsee a little bit more.\n\n365\n00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:46.560\nSystem Influence, automatically start and\nstop virtual machines with the system and\n\n366\n00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.913\nthat means the host itself.\n\n367\n00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:52.670\nAnd this is where we can set up\nmore delays if we need to as well.\n\n368\n00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.720\nContinue immediately if VMware Tools\nactually are installed.\n\n369\n00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.440\nNow, this is a bunch of little flow\ndiagrams that you actually end up\n\n370\n00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.840\nkind of memorizing, if you're\nreally intricate into this thing.\n\n371\n00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.050\nYou can go ahead and say hey, here's\nthe way I want these machine to start up\n\n372\n00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.470\nis I want them to start up\non a start up delay, okay,\n\n373\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.600\nat 120 seconds and continue immediately.\n\n374\n00:21:17.748 --> 00:21:22.300\nIf the VMware tools automatically start,\nin other words go ahead and start this up\n\n375\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:27.120\nas soon as you sense the VMware tools\nstart let it go ahead and do its thing.\n\n376\n00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.440\nBut you may actually say\nI don't want it continue.\n\n377\n00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.530\nSo you may actually not check that up.\n\n378\n00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.260\nYou may want to get it to a point where\nit says hey, I'm about to start up.\n\n379\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.007\nAnd then you have to press\nsomething to make it continue on.\n\n380\n00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:42.550\nOf course, Shutdown Delay, how long\nbefore something actually shuts down.\n\n381\n00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.342\nAnd then, of course,\nyou have different actions.\n\n382\n00:21:44.342 --> 00:21:48.774\nAnd this is key, right, some of the\ndifferent actions that you may choose to\n\n383\n00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:52.857\ndo, depending on how that VM is\nactually shut down or started up here,\n\n384\n00:21:52.857 --> 00:21:54.970\nsomething you may choose.\n\n385\n00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:58.550\nAnd of course,\nthen you have an automatic startup order.\n\n386\n00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.680\nThere's no options available right now,\nor any order.\n\n387\n00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.620\nBut what we do have is right here,\nwhich is the manual startup.\n\n388\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.610\nIf I want to change the order so let's\nsay that this client machine right here\n\n389\n00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.510\nrepresents the let's\nsay domain controller,\n\n390\n00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.570\njust for the sake of argument here.\n\n391\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.150\nAnd then at that point,\nI go here's what I want.\n\n392\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.260\nI want to make sure that\nthis starts up first.\n\n393\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.430\nAnd then that one starts up next,\nwe can do that.\n\n394\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.290\nSo that way you can actually\ntell the order that things\n\n395\n00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.530\nare actually going to be.\n\n396\n00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.030\nI can simply move that if I want\nto by bringing it back down here.\n\n397\n00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.300\nLet's see what happens\nif I move this one up.\n\n398\n00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.020\nNotice you can do that and\nI can even move it to automatic startup.\n\n399\n00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.553\nIf this happens to of course be my\ndomain controller, I know I switched up.\n\n400\n00:22:42.553 --> 00:22:47.346\nBut if the ESX host comes on\nautomatically start this one up, too,\n\n401\n00:22:47.346 --> 00:22:52.630\nand then go through the list of\nwhatever order that I have set up here.\n\n402\n00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.680\nThe more VMs that you have, the more\noptions and you actually set those\n\n403\n00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.590\nVMs up in that particular order,\nthe way that you, you want it to go.\n\n404\n00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:05.590\nSo there's a lot of different choices\nthat you have available to you.\n\n405\n00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.190\nThe key though for you to manage this\nstuff successfully is that in every single\n\n406\n00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:15.440\nVM that you run you need to\nensure that those VM tools\n\n407\n00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.910\nare actually installed right\ninto the actual VMs themselves.\n\n408\n00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:26.780\nSo, as long as you have the ability to do\nso, whether it's inside of Windows and\n\n409\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.560\nyou simply follow the online instructions\nscreens to install that, perfectly fine,\n\n410\n00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.020\nmake sure you do that.\n\n411\n00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.810\nOr whether you actually end up\nrunning some type of Linux server, and\n\n412\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:40.290\nyou start to use command line to do so,\ninstall it if it's possible and\n\n413\n00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.560\navailable for you to do this.\n\n414\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.060\nAnd make sure that you get\nthat in there as well.\n\n415\n00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.389\nYou will even see that certain types of\nLinux operating systems even have packages\n\n416\n00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:52.034\nthat are ready to go for\nthis type on integration.\n\n417\n00:23:52.034 --> 00:23:55.513\nSo, for example, pfSense you can\nactually download a package for\n\n418\n00:23:55.513 --> 00:23:59.739\nThe VMware tools to actually be installed\nin there if you realize you're gonna be\n\n419\n00:23:59.739 --> 00:24:02.960\nrunning pfSense in a virtual\nenvironment as well.\n\n420\n00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.240\nSo, this is kind of some of the different\nmanagement options that you have.\n\n421\n00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.150\nBut Power Management is a big one.\n\n422\n00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:12.940\nIt's a feature that you will\nget tested on for the VCA exam.\n\n423\n00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.960\nSo understanding that you do have that\nability to change the start up sequence,\n\n424\n00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.370\nunderstanding you can actually delay\nthe actual boot process, you name it.\n\n425\n00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.300\nThere are a few different power\nmanagement features in there but\n\n426\n00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.990\nwe still got a bit to go here and we still\nneed to talk about things like V-App as\n\n427\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:34.470\nwell as installing a client,\na VM with a client operating system.\n\n428\n00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.980\nBut Wes,\nyou let me talk too long this time.\n\n429\n00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, everybody's gotta have a hobby,\nthat's for sure, and as you can see,\n\n430\n00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.780\nRonnie showed a lot of power,\na lot of flexibility with our\n\n431\n00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.200\nweb client interface here, Ronnie,\nas you've already mentioned.\n\n432\n00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.040\nIt does look like we're coming to the end\nof another episode, so how about this?\n\n433\n00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.020\nHow about we go ahead and\nwe'll wrap this one up.\n\n434\n00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.720\nWe'll come back for a part two.\n\n435\n00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.560\nWe'll let Ronnie explain some\nmore of the topics that he has.\n\n436\n00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.160\nHow's that sound?\n\n437\n00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:58.710\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n438\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.705\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good.\n\n439\n00:24:59.705 --> 00:25:02.860\nRonnie, do you have anything else that\nyou'd like to throw in this episode or\n\n440\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.210\ndo you wanna go ahead and\nleave it with a cliff hanger for part two?\n\n441\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.270\n&gt;&gt; Well we're definitely gonna leave\nwith a cliff hanger for part two.\n\n442\n00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.050\nYou wanna come back and see that one.\n\n443\n00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.900\nBut at the same time,\nremember that there are so\n\n444\n00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.310\nmany settings in here, and\neverything looks identical.\n\n445\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:19.540\nSo if you're gonna master, of course,\nVMware, you gotta get in there and\n\n446\n00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.840\nactually look around.\n\n447\n00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.390\nIt was very easy for me to forget\nwhere one setting was, very much so.\n\n448\n00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:29.730\nThat I was like all of this is actually\nstored with VMs and it wasn't.\n\n449\n00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.250\nYou notice I actually had to go to the ESX\nhost to find where we can set up that\n\n450\n00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.280\nboot order that I was talking about.\n\n451\n00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.610\nMake sure that you get that in there too.\n\n452\n00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.290\nSo the only way to do that?\n\n453\n00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.430\nSpending time inside, of course,\n\n454\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:46.500\nthe vSphere web client here\nis once again the key.\n\n455\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.890\nWithout that,\nthe idea of passing the exam is\n\n456\n00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:53.000\nnot exactly gonna be the easiest\nthing in the world for you.\n\n457\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.160\nBut you still have a lot of other\nconcepts that you have to go over.\n\n458\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.500\nMake sure you also review the other\nmaterial as you get set here.\n\n459\n00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.510\nBut this is one of the more, this is one\nof the more important topics, because as\n\n460\n00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:08.090\nfar as software goes, this is the software\nthat you at least have to be familiar with\n\n461\n00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:12.810\nso no getting around it, you gotta get in\nthere and take a look at these settings.\n\n462\n00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.700\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie great advice as\nalways, and we appreciate having you here\n\n463\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.360\nin the studios and\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n464\n00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.910\nKeep in mind stick around cuz\nwe're coming back with a part two.\n\n465\n00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.480\nBut until we see you, signing out for\nITProTV I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n466\n00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.240\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n467\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.601\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n468\n00:26:28.601 --> 00:26:34.129\n[MUSIC]\n\n469\n00:26:34.129 --> 00:26:36.700\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.469\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.559\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.940\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n6\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.091\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our VCA6, DCV.\n\n7\n00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:26.590\nAnd joining us in studios for a part 2,\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.890\nRonnie, how you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.330\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, as we continue\non to take look at more of the VCA6.\n\n10\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.770\nWe're really focusing in on two\nparticular technologies now.\n\n11\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.260\nOne, of course,\nis to make sure you understand how\n\n12\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.960\nto create a virtual machine, and\nthen install an operating system into it.\n\n13\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.930\nAnd then, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.850\nwe also wanna talk about the idea\nof resource management as well.\n\n15\n00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.190\nSo let's talk about the idea of resource\nmanagement first and then we'll get into,\n\n16\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.040\nof course, creating a virtual machine.\n\n17\n00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.334\nNow, the great thing is if you already\nwatched kinda the previous objectives\n\n18\n00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.788\nwe've covered in the entire VCA6 series.\n\n19\n00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:04.480\nWe did create a virtual machine before and\nwe did install the VMware tools.\n\n20\n00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.380\nBut here's kind of a nice reminder\nin which we'll do a little bit\n\n21\n00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.070\nquicker this time.\n\n22\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.430\nAnd actually just in pieces and chunks,\nand not really get that much in depth\n\n23\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.150\nin explaining the whole\nprocess as we go on through.\n\n24\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.900\nSo I'm gonna be using two different\nvirtual center environments to\n\n25\n00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.190\nhelp us out.\n\n26\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.500\nOne is to explore, of course,\nthe vApp and then the second one,\n\n27\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.975\nwe're gonna actually take a look\nat the environment that I made.\n\n28\n00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:29.109\nCuz the screen's just a little bit bigger\nand it really helps us out here, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.280\nSo if we take a look at my machine\ninside of my vSphere Web Client.\n\n30\n00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.810\nOne of the things that we'll\nactually see in the navigator.\n\n31\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.710\nLet me go back up to Home here.\n\n32\n00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.340\nIs that if I navigate all the way back\nup to Home and then I select Host and\n\n33\n00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.920\nClusters, a couple of things\nhave already been set up.\n\n34\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.850\nOne of them is actually called, well\nvApp-Demo is what one of them is called.\n\n35\n00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.830\nI'm waiting for everything to kind of\nset up here the way that I want to.\n\n36\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.770\nAnd we're gonna talk the idea\nof what we call vApp.\n\n37\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.480\nNow, most of the time when you\nthink about that term vApp, you\n\n38\n00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.780\nmight be thinking of virtual application\nthat's running that makes sense.\n\n39\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.640\nWell, this is a little bit more unusual\nthan this idea of a virtual application.\n\n40\n00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.750\nWhat it does is it helps us out\nto configure resource management\n\n41\n00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.880\nin a pool setting more than anything else.\n\n42\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.810\nSo it might be where,\ninstead, you actually\n\n43\n00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.540\nhave the same power manager settings that\nyou want but you have 50 servers, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.430\nWell, remember you can actually go in\nthere individually one at a time and\n\n45\n00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.950\nset it up the way that you want to or\nyou can create a vApp itself.\n\n46\n00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.860\nAnd then, of course, put those servers\ninto that vApp resource pool and that way\n\n47\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.200\napply all those settings to, well, those\nindividual resources at the same time.\n\n48\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.850\nSo it's really up to you and\nhow you choose to do this.\n\n49\n00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.700\nBut the way that we actually\ndo it here is in this PLAB,\n\n50\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.990\nthe practice labs vApp demo here.\n\n51\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.000\nYou can see right away that as I selected\nthat, it gives you a nice little resource\n\n52\n00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.860\nmonitor and\nusage that we can see and do here.\n\n53\n00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.680\nAnd then, I can select Monitor and\nManage is kind of the key,\n\n54\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.050\nmaybe, if I can get here.\n\n55\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.250\nAnd so, you can actually take a look\nat the CPU resources as well as, well,\n\n56\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.460\nmemory resources that you\nhave available to the setup.\n\n57\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.390\nAnd of course,\nadding in different objects.\n\n58\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.130\nSo here, virtual machines and\nthen vApps is kind of the key.\n\n59\n00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.530\nAnd it's in here that\nif I hover over these,\n\n60\n00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.330\nI wanna create a new VApp if I want it\nto say I knew the power settings here.\n\n61\n00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.260\nSo, it's from inside this new vApp I can\nselect Create a new one, guide you through\n\n62\n00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.080\ncreating this vApp to be able to\ncustomize your CPU and memory resources.\n\n63\n00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.260\nOnce I select there, I now can select\nLondon where it's gonna reside.\n\n64\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.780\nEvery object that you create\nhas to reside somewhere.\n\n65\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.170\nAnd so this is gonna be inside my London\ndata center is what it's gonna be in.\n\n66\n00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.560\nAnd then, I click Next.\n\n67\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.570\nAnd it's here,\nnotice that you can actually, well,\n\n68\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.492\nreally get down to kind of\nthe nitty gritty details.\n\n69\n00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:13.450\nIn CPU resources, whether you're allowing\ncustomized, shares of high, low, normal.\n\n70\n00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.840\nAnd of course, the reservation\nof even the actual megahertz.\n\n71\n00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.390\nIs this expandable or not?\n\n72\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.460\nLimitation and what it can actually run,\nresources as well.\n\n73\n00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.240\nSo you can actually select that where you\nmight have three or four different ones,\n\n74\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.970\nbut setting unlimited is\nprobably not what you want to do.\n\n75\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.753\nBut you can if you choose to, and\n\n76\n00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:37.874\nthen put all of those different\nVMs inside of this pool.\n\n77\n00:04:37.874 --> 00:04:42.018\nAnd that way they're actually get those\nsame types of management settings for\n\n78\n00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:42.780\nwhat we want.\n\n79\n00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.210\nClick Next here and\nnow we have that resource pool available.\n\n80\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.350\nAnd we click Finish, and\nonce we have that normal pool available,\n\n81\n00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.680\nlet me see if I select Actions.\n\n82\n00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.240\nNow, I can go to the new\nvirtual machine and\n\n83\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.850\nstart adding in virtual\nmachines in that vApp.\n\n84\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.100\nAnd that now becomes part of that pool.\n\n85\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.250\nAnd once that starts to happen, all\nthose settings will then apply to them.\n\n86\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.625\nThis is really good if you think of it\nas being a container for multiple VMs in\n\n87\n00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:15.592\nwhich you need to manage the memory\nas well as the CPU resources for.\n\n88\n00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:19.560\nOnce again, if you're saying,\nwhy don't we configure that?\n\n89\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.892\nWell, that's what you're gonna\nget into the VCP6 about.\n\n90\n00:05:21.892 --> 00:05:27.078\nBut you do at least need to know\nwhat this vApp is actually all\n\n91\n00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:32.935\nabout as far as the reason why you\nwould choose to use this instead.\n\n92\n00:05:32.935 --> 00:05:36.835\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, when you're allocating\nresources to group, that's great.\n\n93\n00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:39.859\nThat doesn't limit your ability that\nif you wanted to individually manage\n\n94\n00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:41.065\na virtual machine, you can.\n\n95\n00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:45.485\nCan you still, if you need more granular\nconfiguration on a VM within the group,\n\n96\n00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:46.625\nyou can still do that, right?\n\n97\n00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:47.265\n&gt;&gt; You can still do it.\n\n98\n00:05:47.265 --> 00:05:48.145\nBut the best option,\n\n99\n00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:50.970\nof course, is to remove it from\nthe pool if you're gonna do that.\n\n100\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.280\nSo take it out of the pool, and\nthen you manage it that way instead.\n\n101\n00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.290\nBut if you do happen to know where\nthere are gonna be a lot of servers.\n\n102\n00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.430\nAnd what you need to go ahead and\nset those same types of limitations on\n\n103\n00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.580\nin terms of the RAM and,\nof course, the CPU usage.\n\n104\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.440\nCreating that is gonna help you\nbecause all you now really need\n\n105\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.400\nto do is add in your VM into that pool.\n\n106\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.440\nAnd now it will be managed that way.\n\n107\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.680\nAnd you actually have very\neffective ways to do that.\n\n108\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.680\nAnd it's always recommended\nbecause it actually\n\n109\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.610\nreally does help eliminate a lot of\nthe granular errors that can happen.\n\n110\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.940\nDid I remember to set it this way or\ndid I not?\n\n111\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.524\nDid I do that?\n\n112\n00:06:27.524 --> 00:06:32.200\nWel, l now if you go ahead and go I know\nthat here's my pool of resources and\n\n113\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.960\nwhat they have to divide up here.\n\n114\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.740\nWell, now you can say every\nsingle computer in there and\n\n115\n00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.980\nyou know exactly what resources are\ndivided up and you don't have to worry.\n\n116\n00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.220\nAnd that's kind of the key\nin terms of vApps and\n\n117\n00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.980\nunderstanding that aspect of\ncreating something like this, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.950\nSo, that's pretty much it.\n\n119\n00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.370\nNow a lot more details?\n\n120\n00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.313\nAbsolutely, can you get\nincredibly granular and\n\n121\n00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:56.631\nmake it happen the way that you want to?\n\n122\n00:06:56.631 --> 00:07:00.360\nYes, you can control a lot of\ndifferent things this way.\n\n123\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.300\nYou can even move the vApp\nfrom one host to another.\n\n124\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.000\nThat way it applies in different ways.\n\n125\n00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.400\nIt's all available for you.\n\n126\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.260\nIt just takes a little bit more time and\n\n127\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.280\na little bit more in-depth\nunderstanding of it.\n\n128\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.010\nBut at least you know\nthe reason behind using vApp.\n\n129\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.080\nAnd that's gonna be key for the exam too.\n\n130\n00:07:17.448 --> 00:07:20.560\nSecondly, we wanna make sure that we\nspend a little bit of time of course then\n\n131\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.900\ncreating a VM, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.670\nNow, let's make sure that\n\n133\n00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.110\nwhen we do this there's two things\nthat are happening here, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.980\nWhen you and I talk about creating a VM or\na virtual machine.\n\n135\n00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.970\nWe're really not talking about\ninstalling an operating system yet.\n\n136\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.010\nWhat we're actually talking about\nis creating like a computer, right?\n\n137\n00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.010\nSo if Wes were to go out and\nbuy a hardware computer,\n\n138\n00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.040\nhe would pick out the different parts,\nthe different components.\n\n139\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.334\nMake sure it actually works,\n\n140\n00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:49.676\nthe components he wants to\nactually run and all that.\n\n141\n00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:56.432\nWell, inside of VMware you have basically\nthe same thing that you can do.\n\n142\n00:07:56.432 --> 00:08:01.221\nAnd then, we need an operating system\nthat we're gonna run on that virtualized\n\n143\n00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:04.302\nhardware, which is really\na file of information.\n\n144\n00:08:04.302 --> 00:08:06.174\nSo can a VM exist without\nan operating system?\n\n145\n00:08:06.174 --> 00:08:10.048\nYes, technically, it can.\n\n146\n00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:11.037\nIs it useful?\n\n147\n00:08:11.037 --> 00:08:12.080\nNo [LAUGH].\n\n148\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.810\nIt's not useful at all.\n\n149\n00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:18.220\nBut the very fact is it can exist without\none, and you can make that happen.\n\n150\n00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.550\nLet's show you how to actually create one,\nand then, of course,\n\n151\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.040\nwe'll start the install and\noperating system.\n\n152\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.360\nNow, I've already got the install and\noperating system starting here.\n\n153\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.370\nReason why it takes a little bit of time.\n\n154\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.310\nThat's why, okay.\n\n155\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.210\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n156\n00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.200\nNow, I switched gears,\nif you're saying hey,\n\n157\n00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.710\nthe screen looks a little bit differently.\n\n158\n00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.720\nThis time, what I've done is I've\nnavigated into one of my ESX hosts,\n\n159\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.710\nwhich I call Bravo.\n\n160\n00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.510\nAnd from this point,\nonce I'm actually inside of Bravo here.\n\n161\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.190\nI selected on the related objects and\nthen virtual machines.\n\n162\n00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.610\nOnce I select that,\nI want to create a new virtual machine.\n\n163\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.200\nNotice that I have a couple\nof different options.\n\n164\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.894\nI can use an OVF template.\n\n165\n00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:03.110\nThis is the open virtualization format.\n\n166\n00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.570\nThat is supposed to go between multiple\nvirtualization environments that are out\n\n167\n00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.510\nthere that support the open standard.\n\n168\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.190\nSo you can actually use those templates or\nyou can, of course,\n\n169\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.450\ncreate one on your own.\n\n170\n00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.150\nWe're just gonna create\nthis one on our own here.\n\n171\n00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:22.040\nAnd we simply walk through some of\nthe different menu settings that we have.\n\n172\n00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.102\nSo here I'm gonna select a creation type,\nclick Next, and\n\n173\n00:09:26.102 --> 00:09:28.144\nit's gonna ask me for a name.\n\n174\n00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:37.930\nI'm gonna do my ITProTVDemo- and I'm gonna\ndo this for Server 12 just for an example.\n\n175\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.320\nThen it's gonna say, hey,\nwhere are you gonna locate this?\n\n176\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.660\nI'm gonna put it inside of\nmy ITProTV data center.\n\n177\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.570\nRemember that you have to have a V Center,\nwhich is gonna be my Server02.\n\n178\n00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.380\nAnd inside our V center I have to have\na data center, inside a data center I have\n\n179\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.130\nto have a data store and inside of the\ndata store that's where we keep our VMs.\n\n180\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.080\nI mean, go figure our EXXOs and\nthen data stores.\n\n181\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.870\nYou name it, they kinda combine there.\n\n182\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.836\nSo it's a high hierarchy that we were\nemphasizing right at the beginning really\n\n183\n00:10:05.836 --> 00:10:08.098\nthe update shows that\nwe've been seeing it.\n\n184\n00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:15.242\nClick Next and now it's gonna ask me, hey,\nwhat server do I want to apply this to?\n\n185\n00:10:15.242 --> 00:10:17.798\nNow I have two different\nhosts on this one.\n\n186\n00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:23.275\nI have the 46.20 and 46.21,\nso I can pick either one.\n\n187\n00:10:23.275 --> 00:10:27.305\nI'm gonna pick this 21 here,\nbecause that one is actually going to\n\n188\n00:10:27.305 --> 00:10:31.000\nbe a physical server that I know\nthat I can rely on the hardware.\n\n189\n00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.090\nNow, the other one here I just created\nthis inside of VMware just to be able\n\n190\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.500\nto have an example.\n\n191\n00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.620\nCan I install it in there?\n\n192\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.900\nYes I can create a VM and\nactually install it, but\n\n193\n00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.230\nits not going to really allow\nme to run a VM very well.\n\n194\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.150\nWhy?\nBecause I'm inside of VMware Fusion,\n\n195\n00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:55.570\nwhich is a hypervisor running ESXi,\nwhich is another hypervisor,\n\n196\n00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:01.160\nand creating now a virtual machine\nin a nested hypervisor situation.\n\n197\n00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.250\nNewer technology, yes, you can do that,\non my laptop I'm probably screaming at it\n\n198\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.790\njust a little bit harder than it wants\nto if I choose something like that here.\n\n199\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.160\nSo I'm gonna choose the one\nthat's on a physical host here,\n\n200\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.890\nwhich is gonna be 46.21.\n\n201\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.552\nVerify that it has\nthe compatibility checks, okay, and\n\n202\n00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.510\nthat it's actually succeeded.\n\n203\n00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.570\nIf not, make sure you go back in and\n\n204\n00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.580\nverify everything is actually up the way\nthat you want and that you need it to.\n\n205\n00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.807\nOnce I select the next setting,\nit's gonna say,\n\n206\n00:11:29.807 --> 00:11:33.471\nwhich of the data storage are you\ngoing to be storing this on?\n\n207\n00:11:33.471 --> 00:11:39.060\nDo I have an actual EXSI alpha store?\n\n208\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.016\nI do, but it's really tiny.\n\n209\n00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:42.820\nIt's like ten gigs and\n\n210\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.400\nif I'm going to install something\nlike a Windows server on it.\n\n211\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.270\nA ten gig hard drive?\n\n212\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.110\n&gt;&gt; I don't think that's gonna work.\n\n213\n00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.920\n&gt;&gt; Not gonna work [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you need at least 20 gigs just\nto get the operating system to install,\n\n215\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.820\nlet alone any slack space you might need.\n\n216\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.195\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nyou saw where this one is not gigantic.\n\n217\n00:11:57.195 --> 00:12:02.965\nIt gives me 141 gigs, but definitely it\nsays look the other one is really so tiny.\n\n218\n00:12:02.965 --> 00:12:06.458\nI'm not even gonna list that here\nas far as the compatibility goes,\n\n219\n00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:09.971\ncuz I don't see one in which you\ncan install an operating system on.\n\n220\n00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:13.196\nSo I'm gonna select this one and\nclick next here and\n\n221\n00:12:13.196 --> 00:12:16.310\nit's gonna ask what compatibility version.\n\n222\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.013\nNormally, you pick, of course,\n\n223\n00:12:18.013 --> 00:12:20.674\nthe same version as what your\nESXI host is going to be.\n\n224\n00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:26.434\nNot always, if you're in a mixed\nenvironment you might be running 5.1,\n\n225\n00:12:26.434 --> 00:12:27.610\n5.5 and 6.\n\n226\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.750\nAnd 6 is your latest one and newest.\n\n227\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.890\nYou might go, what if I need to migrate\nthose VM from one location to another one.\n\n228\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.260\nWell, this particular point\neven if it has latest features\n\n229\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.890\nyou may have to actually go.\n\n230\n00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.740\nLet me go ahead and\nstart with 5.1 and later.\n\n231\n00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.334\nAnd that way, if you do happen to move\nthem between ESXI, a nd one's a 5.1, and\n\n232\n00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:49.945\none's a 5.5 and then 6.\n\n233\n00:12:49.945 --> 00:12:53.360\nThat will cover everything, okay.\n\n234\n00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.580\nBut if you start off at 6 and\n\n235\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:00.120\nyou try to move it backward, it may go\nI don't know if I can really do that.\n\n236\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.000\nSometimes, it may work perfectly fine.\n\n237\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.430\nYou build a second VM, it may not\nwork at all, you just never know.\n\n238\n00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.320\nSo, pick the highest level of\ncompatibility which is only going to\n\n239\n00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.828\nbe the lowest level of ESSI hosts running.\n\n240\n00:13:13.828 --> 00:13:17.063\nIn a realistic environment\nyou don't tend to just\n\n241\n00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:22.000\ntear down every single ESSI host right\naway and then rebuild them all right.\n\n242\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.710\nWhat do you do?\n\n243\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.360\nYou start with one and\nthen once that's stable, you do what?\n\n244\n00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.190\nYou go and bring everybody over and\nthen you actually rebuild that one.\n\n245\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.080\nMake it six and then you actually\ntake the third one and do that.\n\n246\n00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.070\nSo, a very realistic situation\nin which they've given you here.\n\n247\n00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.670\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I know in some other platforms,\nand this certainly isn't a Microsoft show\n\n248\n00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:43.300\nby any means, but like for instance,\npicking a version of the virtual\n\n249\n00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.460\nmachine Gen 1, Gen 2 it's something\nthat you can't go back and change.\n\n250\n00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.381\nIs this a decision that has\nto be made now versus later?\n\n251\n00:13:49.381 --> 00:13:52.680\nIs this something that I can go back and\nchange later, after the fact?\n\n252\n00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.684\nOr, do I have to make sure\nthat I'm prepared now, and\n\n253\n00:13:54.684 --> 00:13:56.569\nmake the decisions based\non what I see right here?\n\n254\n00:13:56.569 --> 00:14:01.332\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can always go back and change\nit a little bit later, ff you need to, but\n\n255\n00:14:01.332 --> 00:14:05.815\nbecause of the way that it's listed\nhere where it's like 5.0 and later,\n\n256\n00:14:05.815 --> 00:14:06.954\n5.1 and later.\n\n257\n00:14:06.954 --> 00:14:11.980\nThey're saying at least you know that if\nyou do this, it will actually travel over.\n\n258\n00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.070\nSo, you probably don't have to worry about\nit at that point, but they also give you\n\n259\n00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.000\na nice little, I don't know if it's\nan admonition or a warning here.\n\n260\n00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.335\nVirtual machine users hardware version 11,\n\n261\n00:14:23.335 --> 00:14:26.419\nprovides the best performance and\nlatest features.\n\n262\n00:14:26.419 --> 00:14:29.360\nWell, as long as you hypervisor\nprovides that, great.\n\n263\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.560\nYour hypervisor doesn't have\nthose latest features and\n\n264\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.310\nyour VM is actually with those\nlatest features, it means what?\n\n265\n00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.840\nYour VM can't take advantage\nof those latest features.\n\n266\n00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.930\nSo there is not a trade off but\nIf you did this and\n\n267\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.570\nit migrates over perfectly fine to 5.1 but\nit don't support some of the features,\n\n268\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.140\nyou're not gonna have\naccess to them anyways.\n\n269\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.823\nSo, yeah, why worry about whether or\nnot a 6.0 or not?\n\n270\n00:14:52.823 --> 00:14:56.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the key point being like you've\nalready mentioned it says and later.\n\n271\n00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.120\nSo like you said,\nif I'm decommissioning an older server and\n\n272\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.520\nmigrating to a newer one.\n\n273\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.910\nAt least making sure again, like you said,\ntake the minimum version that you\n\n274\n00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.280\nhave effective for your environment, and\nthen if you have the functionality you do,\n\n275\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.990\nif you don't at least you can\nwork with it a little bit longer.\n\n276\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.820\n&gt;&gt; That's the way to look at it.\n\n277\n00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.970\nClick Next, here and\n\n278\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.900\nthen it's going to ask me what type of\nguest operating system I want to add in.\n\n279\n00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.186\nWindows, Linux or other.\n\n280\n00:15:22.186 --> 00:15:25.548\nOf course, those are your three kind\nof major varieties that you have.\n\n281\n00:15:25.548 --> 00:15:31.873\nAnd then you can of course setup\nWindows Server and I'm gonna select 2012.\n\n282\n00:15:31.873 --> 00:15:34.228\nNow, what is this about?\n\n283\n00:15:34.228 --> 00:15:38.530\nIt's gonna pre-configure some of those\nsettings to match like the minimum\n\n284\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:43.168\nhardware settings, the compatibility that\nyou need to verify that everything is\n\n285\n00:15:43.168 --> 00:15:45.030\nactually going to be fine.\n\n286\n00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.707\nI selected the 6.0 or later.\n\n287\n00:15:46.707 --> 00:15:48.720\nIt's fine too because\nthat's what I'm running.\n\n288\n00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:55.859\nAnd now, here's where we're talking\nabout the different hardware options.\n\n289\n00:15:55.859 --> 00:16:00.218\nNow remember that all this is virtualized,\nso it's not like Wes going into a store\n\n290\n00:16:00.218 --> 00:16:03.010\nand buying exactly what he wants,\nbut it's close.\n\n291\n00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.979\nBut it's gonna virtualize\nbased off of your hardware.\n\n292\n00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:09.505\nAnd most of the time especially\nif you're running ESXI,\n\n293\n00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:12.910\nit's actually supporting in the hardware,\nright?\n\n294\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.490\nInside of the CPU and the chipset,\nthe ability to do that.\n\n295\n00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.600\nVirtualization for,\n\n296\n00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.960\nor hardware assisted virtualization\nis what we're normally seeing.\n\n297\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.150\nIf your machine can do so, when you click\nthe drop down it will tell me how many\n\n298\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.550\ncores that I actually\nhave on that machine.\n\n299\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.390\nAnd you can match those up\nin terms of virtual cores.\n\n300\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:37.400\nSo, you can see that my particular\nhardware underlying this virtual machine\n\n301\n00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.090\nis actually a, a quad core processor so,\nif you need to use all that,\n\n302\n00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.180\nthat's perfectly fine, or\nif you don't want to use it.\n\n303\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:44.840\nSo I can select 2.\n\n304\n00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.060\nThe amount of memory is only limited by\nthe amount of memory you have on your\n\n305\n00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.860\nphysical machine as well.\n\n306\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.330\nYou gotta be careful here if\nyou haven't done this before.\n\n307\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.195\nWhatever your base operating system is,\ndon't assign that, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:58.195 --> 00:16:59.554\n[LAUGH] Do not assign that.\n\n309\n00:17:01.692 --> 00:17:07.230\nMake sure that you actually to set it for\nwhat you have the ability to setup here.\n\n310\n00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.070\nSo you cannot over allocate the RAM.\n\n311\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.490\nIf you do it's going to tell you,\nyou don't have enough.\n\n312\n00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.810\nSo you have to change the setting as well.\n\n313\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:19.200\nI'm going to change that down to,\nlet's do 2 gigs.\n\n314\n00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.460\nAnd of course the hardware size, 2.\n\n315\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.320\nAnd then you have network adapter,\n\n316\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:30.000\nDVDs, you name it, there's a couple of\ndifferent ones that you may set up.\n\n317\n00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.490\nAll right here, I'm just gonna leave\nthe rest as the default for right now.\n\n318\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.260\nAnd new devices, if I actually had other\ndevices I wanted to add in to show\n\n319\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.650\na full hardware, such as adding a new hard\ndrive or making multiple hard drives.\n\n320\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.270\nAs far as a virtual hard drive goes,\nwe can do that.\n\n321\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:48.900\nIt's all right here if we wanted to.\n\n322\n00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.490\nClick Next, and now it's ready\nto complete and click Finish.\n\n323\n00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.920\nNow, as long as everything is ready and\nup and\n\n324\n00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.770\ngoing, you can see right here at\nthe bottom where the tasks are,\n\n325\n00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.070\nwe're creating this virtual machine and\nthere is the status.\n\n326\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.305\nAnd now you can see in my\nlist of related objects,\n\n327\n00:18:09.305 --> 00:18:14.486\nthere is the second virtual\nmachine right here ready to go.\n\n328\n00:18:14.486 --> 00:18:18.423\nEven if I power on that\nvirtual machine right now,\n\n329\n00:18:18.423 --> 00:18:23.317\nthere is no underlying operating\nsystem it's booting in to.\n\n330\n00:18:23.317 --> 00:18:27.328\nIt is just like buying an actual\npieces of a PC, putting it together,\n\n331\n00:18:27.328 --> 00:18:31.400\nputting the hard drive on and\nturning it on and connecting.\n\n332\n00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.030\nAnd is it on?\n\n333\n00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.640\nYeah, is it actually working hardware?\n\n334\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.640\nYes, can you do anything with it?\n\n335\n00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:42.640\nNo, [LAUGH] Okay, so that is kind of\nthe key when you start to take a look.\n\n336\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.100\nSo we've got two different\nvirtual machines.\n\n337\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.300\nOne is actually running in the background\nand the other one is paused because I\n\n338\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.020\nstarted this installation, but that's the\nnext step we also need to take a look at.\n\n339\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.320\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, would this be the same thing\nas saying that this is a virtualized\n\n340\n00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.780\nbare metal machine?\n\n341\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.420\nI mean,\nthere's no operating system here so\n\n342\n00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.710\nit's really no different than like\nyou said, the physical machine,\n\n343\n00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.680\nbut would this be like a software\nbased bare metal machine?\n\n344\n00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.090\n&gt;&gt; Well to a point, in terms of virtual\nenvironment, when you use the term\n\n345\n00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.570\nbare metal what we're normally talking\nabout is running the hypervisor directly\n\n346\n00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.740\non the hardware itself with no\nintervening operating system.\n\n347\n00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.610\nBut in logical terms yes,\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n348\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.890\nIt's like what I described here.\n\n349\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.990\nYou buying all the components and\nputting it together and\n\n350\n00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.920\ngo, I just wanna turn it on and\nsee what happens.\n\n351\n00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.230\nAnd you'll see it might boot up,\nyou'll hear the hard drive spin up,\n\n352\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.750\nyou have conventional hard drives,\nfans will kick on,\n\n353\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.148\nlights will start blinking at little bit,\nbut, then it'd come to that problem.\n\n354\n00:19:41.148 --> 00:19:45.260\nHe goes, I don't see an operating system,\nand that's kind of where you're stuck\n\n355\n00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.760\nwhen you start seeing something like this,\ninside of the M-ware.\n\n356\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.880\nNow, I just clicked on that\nsecond virtual machine and\n\n357\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:58.020\nnow I'm going to, well, not worry about\nreloading the web client at this point.\n\n358\n00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.890\nBecause I think I've dealt\nwith that issue before.\n\n359\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.210\nAnd there's a couple of things\nthat we need to see, okay.\n\n360\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.690\nNow right here it shows me that\nthe machine is powered on.\n\n361\n00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.725\nI know it's very difficult to see but\nyou can see its got the green button,\n\n362\n00:20:13.725 --> 00:20:16.520\nit's powered on, but it's right\nhere at this state where it says,\n\n363\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.285\nhey, operating system is not found.\n\n364\n00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:21.980\nYou're probably saying, Ronnie,\nyou can read that very well.\n\n365\n00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.630\nIt's because I've seen it all day long,\n\n366\n00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.630\nthat's why I can actually\nread it very well.\n\n367\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.320\nBut the reason I don't want to\nlaunch into this right now is,\n\n368\n00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.990\nnotice that it has this\nlaunch remote console.\n\n369\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:38.990\nThis is where we would actually downloaded\nthis remote console from VMware.\n\n370\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.430\nIf you don't have a registration,\nyou make sure you go and\n\n371\n00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.680\nregister then you can download and make\nsure download it for whatever operating\n\n372\n00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.000\nsystem's gonna be remotely managing\nthis then, key component, right?\n\n373\n00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.720\nSo if Wes is saying, you built\nthat virtual machine for me right?\n\n374\n00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.230\nYeah, okay.\n\n375\n00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.890\nNow you have the ISO, I want to install,\n\n376\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.720\nthe operating system I want to\ninstall in the data store, right?\n\n377\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.790\nYes I do.\n\n378\n00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.100\nGot all that set up and ready to go, okay.\n\n379\n00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.820\nSo from that point now I\ncan hand that over to Wes.\n\n380\n00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.840\nNow, before I get there, let me talk about\nthat idea of the Datastore for a moment.\n\n381\n00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.110\nWe did go over this in a previous episode,\nbut\n\n382\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.100\nyou do have to make sure that it's there.\n\n383\n00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.400\nSo, over on the left hand side,\nnotice that I have Datastore.\n\n384\n00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.750\nAnd then I'm gonna select that\nBravo DataStore for right now.\n\n385\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.450\nAnd then inside of the Bravo DataStore.\n\n386\n00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:39.390\nOops, I need to go to host for a moment.\n\n387\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.780\nLet me see now I'm kinda\ngetting ahead of myself.\n\n388\n00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.240\nI'm probably getting way out of it.\n\n389\n00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.210\nLet me go back to Home.\n\n390\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.590\nI can only find something\napparently from Home.\n\n391\n00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.180\nI can't find it any place else here.\n\n392\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.191\nLet me go back up to storage.\n\n393\n00:21:56.532 --> 00:21:58.952\nSo once I have that, I can go in here and\n\n394\n00:21:58.952 --> 00:22:03.400\nthis is where you can actually\nstart to find that other stuff.\n\n395\n00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.700\nNow we already showed you,\n\n396\n00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.430\nI'm not gonna, cuz I'm starting to say\nmaybe I didn't get you to the right place.\n\n397\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.040\nBut remember when I showed you,\nyou had to create a folder and\n\n398\n00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.060\nthat folder called ISO, and\nthat upload takes a long time.\n\n399\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.040\nI'm just about to show you that again.\n\n400\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.430\nBut we really don't need to since\nwe've already done that, okay?\n\n401\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.630\nNow, once we have that\nmanagement in place,\n\n402\n00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.680\nif we select that launch remote client,\nif this is on Wes's desktop,\n\n403\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.570\nhere's what it will normally\nend up looking like here.\n\n404\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.000\nLet me scroll out for just a moment.\n\n405\n00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.675\nBecause it actually came off of this\nserver you'll see a URL back to\n\n406\n00:22:38.675 --> 00:22:43.278\nthe V Center server here and\nthen you have to do a couple of things.\n\n407\n00:22:43.278 --> 00:22:47.734\nThe first thing you have to do is over\nhere in the upper left hand corner where\n\n408\n00:22:47.734 --> 00:22:48.601\nit says VMRC.\n\n409\n00:22:48.601 --> 00:22:52.808\nYou go to removable devices,\nyou select the CD option and\n\n410\n00:22:52.808 --> 00:22:56.110\nthen you can browse to your data score.\n\n411\n00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.880\nPick the operating system you want, okay.\n\n412\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.520\nNow once you have that done,\nyou also need to come down here to, and\n\n413\n00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:09.100\nlet me make sure I tell you Manager, it\nwas not in Preferences, it was in Manage.\n\n414\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.080\nSo it wasn't there.\n\n415\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.430\nIf I go to Manage In Virtual Machine\nSettings believe this is where it is.\n\n416\n00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:24.040\nUnder options you also wanna make sure\nthat on the general settings here that\n\n417\n00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.530\nyou have everything set up, so there's\nthe virtual machine the working demo.\n\n418\n00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.240\nSnapshots look like that they're good here\nand that's what I was trying to look for,\n\n419\n00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.180\nI was looking for this CD and DVD drive.\n\n420\n00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.940\nNow mine is in that suspended state\nbecause I was in the middle of\n\n421\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.680\nthe install, I was like I don't want\nto stop it and start all over here.\n\n422\n00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.610\nBut you want to make sure\nthat you select this option.\n\n423\n00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:50.690\nConnect at power on, not just connect it.\n\n424\n00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:54.515\nYou can connect it, but as soon as you\npower it on, it is gonna disconnect.\n\n425\n00:23:54.515 --> 00:23:59.030\nOkay, so just do connect at power on,\nthat will also help you out too.\n\n426\n00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.568\nAll right,\nverify you have your ISO image here.\n\n427\n00:24:02.568 --> 00:24:06.010\nAnd once you have that,\nyou can essentially boot the computer or\n\n428\n00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:06.720\npower it on.\n\n429\n00:24:08.883 --> 00:24:10.347\nAnd let me see if I can.\n\n430\n00:24:12.407 --> 00:24:13.758\nFull screen that for a moment.\n\n431\n00:24:17.212 --> 00:24:23.860\nI'll\n\n432\n00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:31.110\ntry.\n\n433\n00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.330\nThat's to, I'm gonna restart it.\n\n434\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.530\nSo apparently, there it goes,\nso let me reset it here.\n\n435\n00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:41.090\nSo now you'll see at the bottom,\nit's starting to load the files\n\n436\n00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.720\nto do everything, and there it goes,\nit's starting the install.\n\n437\n00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.640\nOnce everything is installed and\nready to go at this point\n\n438\n00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.890\nand there's the insulation and we're not\ngoing to walk through the whole thing.\n\n439\n00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.010\nBut you follow the instructions,\ninstall your operating system,\n\n440\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.920\nonce everything gets up and\nrunning inside that operating system.\n\n441\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.850\nAnd my machine has now kind of locked up,\njust a little bit on me.\n\n442\n00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:09.270\nBecause its running in\nthe actual background here\n\n443\n00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.350\nNow once that's actually done, right?\n\n444\n00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.580\nWe wanna now make sure that\nwhen everything gets installed.\n\n445\n00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.400\nI need to stop this or\n\n446\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.710\nit's really gonna lock me out for\ngood is what's gonna happen.\n\n447\n00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.790\nCuz I'm, yeah, I'm running out\nof RAM is what's happening here.\n\n448\n00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.510\nOkay.\n\n449\n00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:35.040\nOnce everything is done, you can go\nback into the management console.\n\n450\n00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.780\nMake sure you install the VMware tools and\nthen you get back in here,\n\n451\n00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.680\nmake sure you press Enter and\nfollow the instructions through.\n\n452\n00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.220\nMake sure it reboots and\n\n453\n00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.730\nthen you'll have all the VMware\ntools installed on there as well.\n\n454\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:51.360\nAnd you'll be up and ready to go,\ncheck your network connections.\n\n455\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.470\nVerify that everything is actually\nconnected the way that you want to.\n\n456\n00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.250\nBut at that point.\n\n457\n00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.140\nWes, if he's the only\none managing this thing.\n\n458\n00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.300\nWell, he's the only one that has access\nto this particular piece of software on\n\n459\n00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.670\nthis computer.\n\n460\n00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.050\nSo, he doesn't have to worry about it\nuntil everything is actually up and\n\n461\n00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:06.980\nready to go.\n\n462\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.190\nAt that point, he turns on remote desktop.\n\n463\n00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.580\nYou can simply close out of this.\n\n464\n00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.790\nI don't have the ability to do so\nright now.\n\n465\n00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:18.100\nBecause my RAM is getting eaten alive\nas I'm trying to do an install and\n\n466\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.960\nrun that V center server at the same time.\n\n467\n00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.480\nBut that pretty much just about locks\nup everything that we need to do,\n\n468\n00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.619\nas far as managing those.\n\n469\n00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.300\nSo once you have that done,\nyou're pretty much ready to go.\n\n470\n00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.360\nIf you add in more and\nmore ISOS into that data store,\n\n471\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.940\nyou just go back into the data\nstorage there, open that folder, and\n\n472\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.440\nthen you can normally upload\nwhatever you want to.\n\n473\n00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.790\nIt does take a bit of time depending\non your network speed as well.\n\n474\n00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.250\nAnd you'll be ready to go.\n\n475\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:53.920\nAnd you will be, excuse me, creating\noperating systems inside of VMware very\n\n476\n00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.240\nquickly as far as different VMs that you\nhave running different operating systems.\n\n477\n00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good, Ronnie.\n\n478\n00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:03.530\nLot of operations that you can\ndefinitely perform inside of your VMs.\n\n479\n00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.390\nNow if you were just joining us and\nyou're like how did they jump\n\n480\n00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.700\nright to installing an operating system,\nkeep in mind that this is a Part Two.\n\n481\n00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.500\nThere were a lot of steps that we\ntalked about in the first part.\n\n482\n00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.030\nIf your just joining us now,\ngo back and watch that first part.\n\n483\n00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.230\nAnd then come back and\n\n484\n00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.430\nwatch Ronnie demonstrate the installation\nof an operating system inside of your VMs.\n\n485\n00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.785\nNow, Ronnie, I do know that we are running\nto the end of yet another great episode.\n\n486\n00:27:24.785 --> 00:27:29.605\nBut before we do, do you have any parting\nwords that maybe you'd like to impart to\n\n487\n00:27:29.605 --> 00:27:33.435\nour viewers when it comes to\nperforming operations on your VM's?\n\n488\n00:27:33.435 --> 00:27:35.595\n&gt;&gt; Well, like anything else, right?\n\n489\n00:27:35.595 --> 00:27:38.105\nTake it slowly at the very beginning.\n\n490\n00:27:38.105 --> 00:27:41.940\nDo not skip steps even though\nI did skip some steps, right?\n\n491\n00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.490\nTry and work through the actual\nissues that you end up causing.\n\n492\n00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.540\nAnd do some research on them.\n\n493\n00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.560\nWe could fix everything and\n\n494\n00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.780\nmake our shows exactly perfect,\nthere's no doubt about it.\n\n495\n00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.080\nBut it doesn't show you some of the\nfrustrations that you have to go through\n\n496\n00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.840\nif you're not familiar\nwith the technology.\n\n497\n00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.060\nSo my recommendation is\nmake sure you get hands on,\n\n498\n00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:05.600\nmake sure you're willing to deal\nwith whatever issues that pop up and\n\n499\n00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.460\nyou'll become better at being\na VCA6 in no time as you start\n\n500\n00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.940\nresearching with all the knowledge\nbased articles that are out there.\n\n501\n00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.270\nVMware is fairly helpful.\n\n502\n00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.990\nI'm not gonna tell you it's\nincredibly intuitive help but\n\n503\n00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.350\nthey do tend to be fairly comprehensive\nat the help that they offer and\n\n504\n00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.420\nthere's a ton of people that love them.\n\n505\n00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.320\nSo, you'll read a ton of blog posts and\n\n506\n00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.440\nall that will just make you better and\nbetter.\n\n507\n00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:33.950\nBut just take the time to do so and in no\ntime you'll have that VCA6 ready to go.\n\n508\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.990\n&gt;&gt; Alright

ITProTV,\n\n3\n00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:15.718\nI’m your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:22.005\ntoday we are continuing\non with our VCA6 series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.991\nAnd joining us back in the studio again\nto help finish out that very series is\n\n6\n00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:27.840\nour good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.150\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.390\n>> Well, thank you for having me back.\n\n9\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.650\nAs we do wrap up everything in terms\nof our series today on VCA6 trying\n\n10\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.970\nto take a look at the last few of the\nremaining items that we have to deal with.\n\n11\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.600\nEarlier in another episode we actually\ntook a look at what we called some of\n\n12\n00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.540\nthe different challenges that we\nface when we talk about the idea of\n\n13\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.210\nwhy we need to implement\nData Center Virtualization, right?\n\n14\n00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.870\nThe very fact is, we've already\ntaken a look at the idea of not\n\n15\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.530\nonly those challenges but also of course,\nof different solutions, right?\n\n16\n00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.230\nWhen it comes down to a data center,\n\n17\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.520\nwe tend to face challenges in terms of\navailability, management, optimization,\n\n18\n00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.116\nscalability and different other\nsolutions that we might have available.\n\n19\n00:01:12.116 --> 00:01:15.279\nThose are kind of the big four that we\nactually need to thing about, okay?\n\n20\n00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.467\nAnd so,\nwhen we start taking a look at that,\n\n21\n00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:21.375\nremember that there are just some of\nthose different challenges that really,\n\n22\n00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:25.780\nit does take a little bit of time but\nVMware essentially has solutions for them.\n\n23\n00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.300\nSo as an example, when we start taking\na look at availability challenges,\n\n24\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.270\nwhat are we trying to avoid?\n\n25\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.570\nDown time, when it comes down to it,\nthat is what we're trying to avoid.\n\n26\n00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.960\nAnd so we mentioned different technologies\nsuch as vSpheres, fault towers and\n\n27\n00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.280\nhigh availability,\nas well as the replication technology and\n\n28\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.460\nthe data protection technology\nthat's actually right there for us.\n\n29\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.242\nSo, if you go man,\nthis does sound familiar, yes,\n\n30\n00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:50.346\nwe did take a look at earlier episodes.\n\n31\n00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:53.915\nSo make sure you take a look at and\nactually the entire show has been talking\n\n32\n00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:57.083\na little bit more in detail about\nthese bigger solutions, well,\n\n33\n00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.490\nespecially availability.\n\n34\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.250\nEven in management, some of the things\nthat we actually mention in terms of\n\n35\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.940\nchallenges were things like licensing,\nright?\n\n36\n00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.319\nAnd of the course\nthe idea of repositories,\n\n37\n00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.389\nwhere is our software actually held?\n\n38\n00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.300\nHow do we actually get it from\none location to the other?\n\n39\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.070\nLicences, how do we actually keep track of\nlicensing there and that VMware also helps\n\n40\n00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.730\nus out there, as well because we actually\nhave things like the content library.\n\n41\n00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.310\nAs well as\nthe Platform Services Controller\n\n42\n00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.260\nthat can help us to manage even those\nlicenses that we have available.\n\n43\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.602\nWe've even taken a look at\noptimization challenges as well, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:30.602 --> 00:02:34.657\nThe idea here of actually being a runsend\nlike the operations manager to help us out\n\n45\n00:02:34.657 --> 00:02:37.534\nto ensure that we can actually\ntake a look at all the data and\n\n46\n00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:39.930\ninformation that's presented to us.\n\n47\n00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.367\nMake good decisions based off it,\nas well as we realize and\n\n48\n00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:45.831\nthen of course, in scalability, okay.\n\n49\n00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:49.740\nThe ability of course, to be able\nto move and scale up and scale out.\n\n50\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.180\nWe do have vMotion that helps us do that,\nas well as the ability to keep the uptime.\n\n51\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.750\nYou name it, everything kind of boils\ndown into those different components.\n\n52\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.830\nNow, the reason why I wanted to go through\nthat, and didn't actually wanna kind of\n\n53\n00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.220\nspend time in each one,\nis that we've already done that.\n\n54\n00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.520\nBut I will make a recommendation to you,\n\n55\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.460\nsomething that you can do to help you\nto get ready for the exam as well.\n\n56\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.527\nAs you go and you start preparing,\nyou gonna end up,\n\n57\n00:03:16.527 --> 00:03:20.639\none of the things that you want to do\nbecause this is where you can do it,\n\n58\n00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.671\nis make sure you go to\nVMware's learning website.\n\n59\n00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:26.686\nAgain, something you can actually\ndo in your favorite search engine.\n\n60\n00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:31.626\nGo there, type in, learning VMware and\nthen take a look at that\n\n61\n00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:36.610\nparticular exam schedule for\nthis particular exam, right?\n\n62\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.844\nThe VCA6, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:37.844 --> 00:03:41.529\nAnd one of the things you can actually do\nright there, is that they have a three\n\n64\n00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:45.329\nhour video, of course and that's their\nrecommendation is that you take that,\n\n65\n00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.129\nuse that along with our particular\nseries to help you out.\n\n66\n00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.395\nAnd when you take a look at that, you're\ngonna actually gonna see something that\n\n67\n00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:54.460\nyou're gonna see on every exam,\nwhich is some type of scenario.\n\n68\n00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.770\nOkay, and\nin which these things are gonna help and\n\n69\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.400\nthat's what you're actually\ntaking a look at there, right?\n\n70\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.340\nIs that, all these challenges\nare never actually presented just\n\n71\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.660\nas a list of challenges, they're always\npresented in terms of scenarios.\n\n72\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.378\nMake sure you actually go through that\nscenarios on challenges and verify and\n\n73\n00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:13.341\ntake a look at some of those solutions at\nVMware, it really does help you out with.\n\n74\n00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:16.786\nAnd understand that's the type of solution\nyou would recommend to somebody that's\n\n75\n00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:18.820\nmaking a decision, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.130\nSo, when we start taking a look at that,\nthe nice thing about taking a look at all\n\n77\n00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.920\nthose challenges before and all those\nsolutions is that those things can\n\n78\n00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.800\nactually apply at every level at that\nyou're doing virtualization, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.730\nWhether you're a small business,\nor whether you're a large business\n\n80\n00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.100\nessentially the challenges that you\ntend to face and the solutions.\n\n81\n00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.740\nThis is where it becomes different, right?\n\n82\n00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.970\nThe challenges that you tend to\nface are kinda the same thing.\n\n83\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.670\nAvailability, scalability,\noptimization, you name it.\n\n84\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.730\nWhat's one?\nManagement,\n\n85\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.640\nI was trying to remember that last one,\nbut couldn't management.\n\n86\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.090\nThese are kind of very common challenges,\nokay?\n\n87\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.130\nSo, what does is matter if you're\na small and a medium business, or\n\n88\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.500\nyou're actually a large business, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.930\nWell, what it comes down to, is that\nthe challenges that are actually the same,\n\n90\n00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.000\nalso mean that you have to think\nabout the solutions, though.\n\n91\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.030\nThis is where the solutions may\nbe a little bit different, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.910\nSo when we start thinking about some\nof those challenges again and start\n\n93\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.240\ntrying to think about it in terms of small\nto medium business, versus large business.\n\n94\n00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.400\nWell, this is where it\nactually comes differently,\n\n95\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.630\ncuz you'll pick a different product\nwhen you start thinking about this idea.\n\n96\n00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.246\nSo let's take from the example that\nyou actually understand that even\n\n97\n00:05:31.246 --> 00:05:33.512\nthough we face some of\nthe same challenges,\n\n98\n00:05:33.512 --> 00:05:36.040\nthat because of the size\nof the business itself.\n\n99\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.890\nYou're actually going to pick different\nsolutions that you actually implement.\n\n100\n00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.860\nSo for example,\nif you take a look at things like\n\n101\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.670\nthe available bandwidth that\nyou have ready for you, right?\n\n102\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.237\nIn a small to medium business,\n\n103\n00:05:49.237 --> 00:05:53.402\nit doesn't necessarily mean that you're\nactually gonna take advantage of every\n\n104\n00:05:53.402 --> 00:05:56.195\nsingle feature that's\noffered inside of NSX, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:56.195 --> 00:05:57.670\nDoes it mean you can configure them?\n\n106\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.270\nSure, you can, but more than likely\n\n107\n00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.560\nthe default settings are probably\ngonna be leave most of the things at.\n\n108\n00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.555\nUnless you see a need to change them, so\nwhere as you might actually go look I just\n\n109\n00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:11.540\nneed to work and\ncreate distributed switch.\n\n110\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.520\nI just need to create be able\nto modify some of the settings\n\n111\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.450\nin the virtual standard switch.\n\n112\n00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.690\nWell, now, when you actually become a\nlarge business or an enterprise business,\n\n113\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.700\nthis is we're actually managing at\nthe NSX level may actually be the key for\n\n114\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.660\nyou, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.530\nWhen you start talking about the idea\nof available bandwidth,okay?\n\n116\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.186\nThe other thing,\n\n117\n00:06:32.186 --> 00:06:34.780\nwhen you actually think about that\nin just a very simple term, right?\n\n118\n00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.400\nA small business might actually\nonly get like a, let's say,\n\n119\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.310\na 40 megabit connection, right?\n\n120\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.029\nComing into your business and out.\n\n121\n00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:43.771\nLarge business, you might be actually\ngo up to that 100 megabit or\n\n122\n00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:45.262\neven gigabit connections instead.\n\n123\n00:06:45.262 --> 00:06:47.600\nSo it's the same thing,\nnotice it's different solutions.\n\n124\n00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.000\nNow you might say, why is that a different\nsolution, its just different capacity?\n\n125\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.990\nWell, it can be, it might be that\nyou find out that, hey, you have\n\n126\n00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.585\none solution provider that can actually\nprovide very well at the small end.\n\n127\n00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:01.000\nAnd you have another one that\nactually provides better at a large\n\n128\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.550\nend on terms of the bandwidth\nthat you have too.\n\n129\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.970\nSame thing in terms of back\nup strategies as well.\n\n130\n00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.600\nIn a large business where your\nbusiness is operating 24 hours a day.\n\n131\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.680\nThe cloud solution may be the way for\nyou to go.\n\n132\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.085\nSo being able to actually go look,\nwe need to actually think about that\n\n133\n00:07:17.085 --> 00:07:19.634\ninner disaster recovery solution,\nthat may be it.\n\n134\n00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:24.576\nIn a small business solution, you might\ngo now, we'll create our own virtual sand\n\n135\n00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:28.180\nat an offsite, be ready to go and\ndo stuff like that.\n\n136\n00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.690\nSo, that's what we're actually talking\nabout when you start thinking in\n\n137\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.460\nthose terms.\n\n138\n00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.950\nSame thing with the idea of availability,\nwhether or\n\n139\n00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.760\nnot we're actually doing long term\nvMotion or actually just making sure\n\n140\n00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.430\nthat vMotion is up and running as\nwell as fault tolerance is enough.\n\n141\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.580\nIt again, might change depending on\nthe size of your business as well and\n\n142\n00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.660\nhow you actually implement that too.\n\n143\n00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.490\nCentralized management, do you need it?\n\n144\n00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.190\nOkay, big business where you have\nmulti sites you better believe it and\n\n145\n00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.970\nthat's going to take place.\n\n146\n00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.447\nAnd the same thing with compliance and\nconfigurations, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:04.160\nThe larger your business is,\nthe more centralized you want this stuff.\n\n148\n00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.810\nIn a small one, you might go,\nyou wanna know something?\n\n149\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.660\nOur off-site offices are only\nfive miles apart and\n\n150\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.150\nit's another $15,000 for\nme to implement that.\n\n151\n00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.680\nI think we can drive to the offices or\nI can remote desktop into one or\n\n152\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.060\ndo something, so it might actually kind\nof save you a little bit of money.\n\n153\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.434\nBut that is the key is understanding\nthat there are somethings and\n\n154\n00:08:25.434 --> 00:08:29.664\nif you actually take a look at the episode\nwhere we talked about some of the products\n\n155\n00:08:29.664 --> 00:08:30.851\nthat vSphere offers.\n\n156\n00:08:30.851 --> 00:08:32.132\nYou'll see that some of them really do,\n\n157\n00:08:32.132 --> 00:08:34.900\nwhen you look at them you're like\nisn't that a little bit overkill.\n\n158\n00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.290\nYes, but is it overkill for\na gigantic office?\n\n159\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.150\nProbably not, not overkill at all,\noverkill maybe for\n\n160\n00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.550\na small office, you better believe it.\n\n161\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:48.010\nSo, that's the idea when we start talking\nabout some of these different solutions.\n\n162\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.740\nYou wanna make sure you pick the solution\nthat fits the best to the scale\n\n163\n00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.470\nof the enterprise that you're in or\nif you're in a small to medium business,\n\n164\n00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.520\npick the one that actually suits\nyour company better, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.180\nEach one has its drawbacks,\nin a small company,\n\n166\n00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.140\ncan you implement the most\nenterprise-ranging solution you want to?\n\n167\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.540\nYes, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.670\nBut may it help you?\n\n169\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.850\nIt can, but\nit may not help you as much as you think.\n\n170\n00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.080\nIn a big business,\nimplementing the small scale solution can\n\n171\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.690\nactually hinder you from getting\nall the performance that you need.\n\n172\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.210\nSo make sure you go back through and\n\n173\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.970\ntake a look at the episodes that\nwe've actually just done here.\n\n174\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.840\nSo that you can actually take advantage\nof actually understanding the business\n\n175\n00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.120\nchallenges, as well as solutions\nthat VMware offers you.\n\n176\n00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.978\nAs someones who is either making\nthe business decision for\n\n177\n00:09:35.978 --> 00:09:39.075\nvirtualization of your data center,\nor someone helping out.\n\n178\n00:09:39.075 --> 00:09:42.100\nIn order words finding out more\nabout the product themselves and\n\n179\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.300\nthen making a recommendation.\n\n180\n00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.083\nThis certification is really designed for\nyou, so that you have a better\n\n181\n00:09:48.083 --> 00:09:51.813\nunderstanding of all those products\nthat are out there and available.\n\n182\n00:09:51.813 --> 00:09:55.876\nAnd a little understanding of some of\nthe neat ways that they work together but\n\n183\n00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:57.826\nif you're actually ready for more.\n\n184\n00:09:57.826 --> 00:10:01.539\nYou're gonna actually move on to that\nidea of thatVMware Certified Professional\n\n185\n00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:04.658\ninstead that will give you more\nconfiguration and actually be able to\n\n186\n00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:08.050\nmanage it much more effectively\nthan what you'll see at this level.\n\n187\n00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.030\n>> All right, Ronnie, well, thanks for\nreminding us that we do need to, hey,\n\n188\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.310\nwe got to know these VMware products,\nso that we can pick the right tool for\n\n189\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.560\nthe right job and\nthere's no reason to overkill.\n\n190\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.755\nIf I need a scalpel,\nI'm not gonna grab a bone saw, all right.\n\n191\n00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:24.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I need to do a long distance drive,\n\n192\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.760\nI'm not gonna grab a funny\ncar because even though it's\n\n193\n00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.750\ngot a lot of horse power and\nit's really cool.\n\n194\n00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:33.198\nYou probably aren't gonna need that, you\nneed the right system for the right job.\n\n195\n00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:36.900\nThanks again, Ronnie for dropping by and\nexplaining that very fact to us and\n\n196\n00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.710\nhow we can leverage VMmare solutions for\nthat very fact.\n\n197\n00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.805\nWe thank you guys for watching,\nI know it's a short episode, but we're\n\n198\n00:10:43.805 --> 00:10:47.129\ngonna go ahead and sign off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n199\n00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:48.342\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n200\n00:10:48.342 --> 00:10:49.004\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n201\n00:10:49.004 --> 00:10:57.659\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
