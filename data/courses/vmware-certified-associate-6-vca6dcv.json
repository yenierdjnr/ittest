          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.701\n[SOUND] In this segment,\n\n2\n00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:09.603\nwe're gonna give you a brief overview\n\n3\n00:00:09.603 --> 00:00:16.068\nof our upcoming VCA6-DCV exam series.\n\n4\n00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:19.595\nAnd joining me here to help out with\nevery endeavors, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:22.410\nRonnie, can you help\ngive us a generalization,\n\n6\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.769\na general overview of what this is about?\n\n7\n00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.778\n>> We take a look at actually trying our\nhand here at actually doing the VCA6.\n\n8\n00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:33.505\nWhat we're trying to say is that we wanna\nget used to the technology that we're\n\n9\n00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:36.990\ngonna find inside the VMware\nespecially in vSphere version 6.\n\n10\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.330\nNormally this is gonna be for\n\n11\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.230\nsomeone that is actually a decision maker\ntrying to make a move into virtualization\n\n12\n00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.310\nthinking that it's something that they\nmight wanna do for their data center or\n\n13\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.050\nsomebody that's helping to\nmake that decision as well.\n\n14\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.670\nAnd they need to get more\nfamiliar with the topics so\n\n15\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.650\nthat they have a general understanding and\nthey can actually do a little bit\n\n16\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.350\nmore research into it, to see if\nthis is the way that they wanna go.\n\n17\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.797\nIt really does help out, of course,\nif you have a technical background,\n\n18\n00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:05.687\nyou've been working in IT for a little bit\nof time, but there is no real requirement\n\n19\n00:01:05.687 --> 00:01:08.488\nas far as the certification goes,\nbut it really does help.\n\n20\n00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:12.331\nBecause some of the concepts will cover\nof course our general concepts that we'll\n\n21\n00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:14.590\nfind throughout the entire IT industry.\n\n22\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.880\n>> So the intended audience for this\nseries is gonna be, anybody that wants to\n\n23\n00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.880\nknow more about virtualization in general\nand maybe even the VMware products itself.\n\n24\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.750\n>> It really is it.\n\n25\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.130\nReally does help us to be able to see how\nthose VMware products hook together and\n\n26\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.540\nbe able to work together.\n\n27\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.301\nUnderstand the technical requirements\nbehind them especially in terms of VMware,\n\n28\n00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:37.110\nvSphere 6.\n\n29\n00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.020\nSo once we have that understanding, that\nmakes it easier for the decision maker and\n\n30\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.900\nmakes it easier for somebody at\nleast trying to administrate or\n\n31\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.580\nget their hands into the administration\nof these sphere 6, as well.\n\n32\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.238\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n33\n00:01:49.238 --> 00:01:54.240\nDoes this series, is it going to\ncorrelate with any exams or tests?\n\n34\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.238\n>> It really does.\n\n35\n00:01:55.238 --> 00:01:58.150\nInside of VMware, of course,\nthey have a learning division,\n\n36\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.160\nwhich means they also have training,\nand they also have certifications.\n\n37\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.409\nSo when we start taking a look at it,\nwhat this actual series is going\n\n38\n00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.398\nto help you out in, is for\nyou to be able to earn your VCA6-DCV.\n\n39\n00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.720\nNow, what does that actually mean?\n\n40\n00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.410\nLet's take a look at my screen here for\na moment and that will help us out.\n\n41\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.330\nSo when we take a look here,\n\n42\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.030\nVMware Certified Associate 6\nData Center Virtualization Fundamentals.\n\n43\n00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.810\nSo the term fundamentals let's\nyou actually understand that,\n\n44\n00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.320\nhey, here is the exam that\nwe are actually going for.\n\n45\n00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.560\nAnd it's actually a fundamentals exam.\n\n46\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.400\nSo it actually rests heavily\nmore on the concepts.\n\n47\n00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.710\nAnd the technologies in terms of\nidentification and understanding\n\n48\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.300\nthe benefits and understanding solutions\nthat VMware provides rather than the idea\n\n49\n00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.360\nof configuration and of mastery of\nall the programs that you see there.\n\n50\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.660\nThis matches up to an exam number\nright here which is 1V0-601.\n\n51\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.670\nAnd that's what you actually wanna\ntake a look at when you start\n\n52\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.840\nto earn that certification.\n\n53\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.290\nOf course, that means that if you're\ngoing to earn that certification,\n\n54\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.600\nyou need to of course sign up and\nbe able to pass it, as well.\n\n55\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.613\nSo some of the details in\nthat is gonna actually be,\n\n56\n00:03:08.613 --> 00:03:11.830\nwell, this, the exam that you take\nis gonna be 50 questions long.\n\n57\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.077\nAnd you'll have a 75 minute duration to\nbuild to take that exam and your passing\n\n58\n00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:23.263\nscore is a 300, now they don’t tell you\nwhat the upper number is but that's what\n\n59\n00:03:23.263 --> 00:03:28.548\nthe passing score is gonna be as a 300 out\nof those 50 questions when you do that.\n\n60\n00:03:28.548 --> 00:03:33.017\nNow, the other thing occurs that most\npeople are concerned about them,\n\n61\n00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:36.532\nis that when you take a look\nthere is a price associated and\n\n62\n00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:41.364\ncurrently the price associated with\nthis is gonna be a about $120, US, so\n\n63\n00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:46.230\nmake sure you note that when you\nactually go to pay for the exam.\n\n64\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.350\nSo this exam is actually the current one\nthat gives you that associate level in\n\n65\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.060\nterms of VMware.\n\n66\n00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.060\nAnd it's actually very easy for you to\nget access to register for this exam.\n\n67\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.160\nNow, before you actually\nsay anything like, man,\n\n68\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.600\ndo I need to go to a testing center?\n\n69\n00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.340\nYou really don't because this\nparticular exam is non-proctored, and\n\n70\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.180\nthat means you can take it online.\n\n71\n00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.176\nNow, does that mean wow,\nit's an online exam, can I cheat?\n\n72\n00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:14.682\nWell, no, you really can't and\nthe reason why is that they actually take\n\n73\n00:04:14.682 --> 00:04:18.980\nscreenshots as you're actually on\nthat exam to see what's going on.\n\n74\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.250\nSo don't think that it's actually\njust unproctored and that means, hey,\n\n75\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.800\nit's an open book exam.\n\n76\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.020\nIt means that time limit is actually\nsomething they follow by very strictly and\n\n77\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.350\nthey do take screenshots of\nwhat's going on during the exam.\n\n78\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.310\nSo they'll know if you're\nactually flipping through and\n\n79\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.430\ngoing through web pages and\nwhen you're doing that.\n\n80\n00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.710\nBut yes, you won't be able to do that.\n\n81\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.090\nNow, when you register for\nthis, it's fairly simple.\n\n82\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.961\nYou'll actually notice that,\nright here on this very page,\n\n83\n00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:44.957\nis that it actually gives you this button.\n\n84\n00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:50.166\nSo if you do a search from your favorite\nbrowser, and you type in VCA6-DCV exam,\n\n85\n00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:55.072\nyou actually bring up this Register Now,\nand if you already have a Pearson VUE\n\n86\n00:04:55.072 --> 00:05:00.456\naccount, you'll just walk through, pick\nthe language that you want this to be in.\n\n87\n00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:04.278\nAnd notice there's three languages,\nEnglish, Japanese and Chinese.\n\n88\n00:05:04.278 --> 00:05:06.719\nIf you actually happen to\nbe proficient in all three,\n\n89\n00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:10.083\nI took mine in English cuz I'm not\nproficient in Japanese, I know a little\n\n90\n00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:13.555\nbit of Chinese, but overall English is\nactually gonna be my base language,\n\n91\n00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:16.580\nyou'll be able to register for\nit, and here's the key.\n\n92\n00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.582\nYou don't just get to register for\nit some time in the future,\n\n93\n00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:23.450\nwhat they actually intend for you to do is\nto get the knowledge that you need, and\n\n94\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.550\nwhen you are ready for that exam, you\nselect that register and you pay for it.\n\n95\n00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.178\nAnd it gives you two\ndays to take the exam.\n\n96\n00:05:30.178 --> 00:05:33.051\nSo you actually see that from\nthat point once you pay and\n\n97\n00:05:33.051 --> 00:05:35.924\nyou say yes,\nat the very end of that process of paying,\n\n98\n00:05:35.924 --> 00:05:39.640\nthere's gonna be a little button\nthat says start the exam.\n\n99\n00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.150\nSo if you accidentally click on that and\nstart it, you have to take the exam.\n\n100\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.600\nSo be very careful when you choose\nto register for this exam, as well.\n\n101\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.730\nNow, the neat thing is, when you actually\nstart taking a look, is that if you get to\n\n102\n00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.430\nthis page, you do have access while down\nhere underneath the Register Now button.\n\n103\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.220\nSo I recommend that you not click\non Register Now immediately after\n\n104\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.090\ngoing to this page.\n\n105\n00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.700\nYou can, you can take a look at it and\nnot register.\n\n106\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.068\nBut notice they actually\ngive you the exam topics,\n\n107\n00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:11.548\neven some suggestions on how to prepare,\nand some additional resources.\n\n108\n00:06:11.548 --> 00:06:14.850\nI recommend that you take\nadvantage of all three.\n\n109\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.700\n>> Ronnie, you actually hit on a really\ngood question here that I've got for\n\n110\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.390\nyou is, what specifically are the topics\nthat we're going to cover in the series?\n\n111\n00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.480\n>> Well, when it comes down to it,\nremember that when we take a look at this,\n\n112\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.280\nwe actually will follow the exam topics\nin the series that we'll be covering.\n\n113\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.520\nSo what we're actually going to do here\nis we take a look here on my machine.\n\n114\n00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.870\nWe'll follow these exam topics along and\n\n115\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.000\nwe'll see that there's some overlap to it\nand which we'll just cover once instead of\n\n116\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.090\nactually going through\nthem multiple times.\n\n117\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.460\nSo for example, explaining\nthe data virtualization concepts,\n\n118\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.820\nidentifying those typical\nchallenges is pretty much key.\n\n119\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.720\nAnd we'll take a look at things like,\nwhat is the data center itself and\n\n120\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.535\nwhat is data center virtualization, we'll\ntalk about the benefits of virtualization\n\n121\n00:06:59.535 --> 00:07:03.588\nas well as some of the common components\nthat we'll also see there, too.\n\n122\n00:07:03.588 --> 00:07:07.488\nAnd then, of course, we'll take a look\nat the challenges that VMware helps us\n\n123\n00:07:07.488 --> 00:07:10.738\nto resolve by taking a look at some\nof the different editions, and\n\n124\n00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:12.980\nwe'll make sure we enumerate those.\n\n125\n00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.060\nTake a look at management challenges,\nscalability, and optimization challenges\n\n126\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.230\nthat we tend to actually have to face,\nand where VMware helps us to face those.\n\n127\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.200\nAnd then, of course,\nwe get into the meat of the product,\n\n128\n00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.375\nwhich is to get more familiar\nwith vSphere technologies.\n\n129\n00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.774\nvSphere 6, and you'll see us in here,\n\n130\n00:07:31.774 --> 00:07:36.645\nthat we'll go over storage technologies,\nnetworking, resource management,\n\n131\n00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:40.458\navailability and even some of\nthe different products that we may\n\n132\n00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:43.938\nnot have covered anywhere else\nduring the entire course.\n\n133\n00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:47.612\nAnd then, in the end, we'll take a look\nat some of the different challenges that\n\n134\n00:07:47.612 --> 00:07:50.490\nhappen when we start talking\nabout business challenges here.\n\n135\n00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.780\nAnd usually some of the business\nchallenges happen to deal with size.\n\n136\n00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.930\nWhat size is your organization and\nwhat we actually have to expect from that.\n\n137\n00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:58.810\nThe good thing is,\n\n138\n00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.870\nduring the entire course, you'll probably\nend up seeing that we'll cover just about\n\n139\n00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.510\nevery single challenge that we normally\nwill face in the course itself.\n\n140\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.100\nAnd so, at the end it's really just\na review of everything that we need.\n\n141\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.320\nSo when you start taking a look here,\n\n142\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.280\nsome of the things that you want to\nconsider as you actually are preparing,\n\n143\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.090\nand getting ready for\nthis course is the terminology itself.\n\n144\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.280\nMaking sure, of course, that if you\nknow some of the ideas and some\n\n145\n00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.370\nof the concepts, make sure you learn the\nVMware idea and the concepts there, too.\n\n146\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.490\nAnd of course, make sure you actually\nknow the names of these products,\n\n147\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.760\ncuz this is a big one that you\nhave to pay attention to, as well.\n\n148\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.310\nSo this is why it's not the most\ntechnically challenging exam before us,\n\n149\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.180\nbut it is actually an exam that will\nchallenge you as far as the number of\n\n150\n00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.210\nproducts that we go through.\n\n151\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.230\nAnd yes, if you want to pass the exam, you\ngot to know those products, those features\n\n152\n00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.360\nand even some of the benefits of those,\nso make sure you pay careful attention\n\n153\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.860\nduring the entirety of this series\nas we actually go through this.\n\n154\n00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.360\nNow, the other thing is,\nright here on the preparation,\n\n155\n00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.500\nthey have in that nice three-hour\ntraining video for you to go through.\n\n156\n00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.570\nAnd this is their recommended training,\nand\n\n157\n00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.950\nthey even have a practice exam for you.\n\n158\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.780\nAnd all of this is for free.\n\n159\n00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.916\nNow, on the practice exam, it'll give\nyou 99 times to go through this.\n\n160\n00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:17.716\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n161\n00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:21.250\nIt doesn't mean it's the exact same exam,\nso you gotta be careful.\n\n162\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.950\nUse it only to help you assess in areas\nthat you are having problems in, and\n\n163\n00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.520\nyou'll see that if you ever\nget 100% score, you're done.\n\n164\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.470\nIt won't let you take it again.\n\n165\n00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.250\nSo it'll lock you out at that point.\n\n166\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.840\nSo always at the end, it even tells you,\nat least make one answer wrong if you're\n\n167\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.270\nnot taking the exam immediately, and\nthat way you can always go back through.\n\n168\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.730\nUse it to actually find areas\nthat you're weak in and then,\n\n169\n00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.610\nonce you actually find those weak areas,\nmake sure you go back and\n\n170\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.920\nstudy them a bit more in\ndepth when you do so.\n\n171\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.080\nThe other thing that I want you to be able\nto take advantage of, is really this last\n\n172\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.350\none right here where it says,\nTest Drive VMware vSphere Environment.\n\n173\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.590\nThis will give you access\nto a nice virtual lab\n\n174\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.060\nthat will allow you to test drive vSphere\nand take a look at all the different\n\n175\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.720\ncomponents that we talked about\nthroughout this particular series.\n\n176\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.180\nIt's really gonna help you out.\n\n177\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.560\nThe more that you get hands on with it,\nthe better off you're gonna actually\n\n178\n00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.400\nbe as you take a look at those different\nproducts that are actually offered, and\n\n179\n00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.890\nwhat vSphere really wants\nyou to be able to do.\n\n180\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:28.490\nSo there is a lot of information, but I\nthink we're actually ready to get started.\n\n181\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.680\n>> Well, Ronnie, thanks so\nmuch for that overview and\n\n182\n00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.730\nthat general assessment of what we\ncan expect in this upcoming series.\n\n183\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.354\nAnd if it sounds like something\nthat you might be interested in,\n\n184\n00:10:37.354 --> 00:10:40.790\nthen we look forward to seeing\nyou in the upcoming episodes.\n\n185\n00:10:40.790 -->
