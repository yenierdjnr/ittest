          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:07,505\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:12,930\nLet's take a minute to look at the VMware\nCertified Professional certification.\n\n3\n00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,600\nThe VCP is one of the most well\nknown virtualization certifications\n\n4\n00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,230\nin the IT industry.\n\n5\n00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,700\nAs a result, when somebody says they're\ngonna go and get a certification\n\n6\n00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,100\nthat relates to virtualization,\nthis is normally the one that they go for.\n\n7\n00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,110\nIt is a little more complex and\na little bit different than the other\n\n8\n00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,650\ncertifications you might be used to, so I\nwanna make sure we talk about what it is,\n\n9\n00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,790\nwho it's targeted towards, and some of\nthe little caveats that go along with it.\n\n10\n00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,130\nFirst off,\nif you're not familiar with VMware,\n\n11\n00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,800\nVMware is a company that is the market\nleader in virtualization technologies.\n\n12\n00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,760\nIf you go to work for any medium, large,\n\n13\n00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,650\nor enterprise-sized organization, you\nwill find VMware virtualization products.\n\n14\n00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,280\nThey outnumber Microsoft Hyper-V and\n\n15\n00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,030\nCitrix XenServer by just\nastronomical amounts.\n\n16\n00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,220\nThey have a huge portion of the market\nshare, and there's a good reason for it.\n\n17\n00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,870\nTheir virtualization\nproducts are top-notch.\n\n18\n00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,290\nSo if you find yourself\nworking in that market,\n\n19\n00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,440\nthe VCP certification becomes\nvery attractive to you.\n\n20\n00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,870\nIt's a way to say that you\nknow how to implement and\n\n21\n00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,790\nmaintain VMware technologies and\ndo it successfully.\n\n22\n00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,780\nSo it is a hot topic,\ndefinitely a good entry on your resume,\n\n23\n00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,610\nif that's what you're looking for.\n\n24\n00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,560\nHowever, the VCP is targeted a little\ndifferently than a lot of certifications.\n\n25\n00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,480\nVCP is not designed for\nsomebody just getting started in IT,\n\n26\n00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,510\nor somebody who's just transitioning\ntheir career over or something like that.\n\n27\n00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,760\nVCP is designed for\npeople who are already entrenched in IT.\n\n28\n00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,680\nPeople who have already been working\nwith servers and workstations,\n\n29\n00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,780\nand are entering and already working\nin the virtualization market.\n\n30\n00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,310\nWe wanna show that you know the high level\nknowledge, the really important stuff,\n\n31\n00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,520\nas far as deploying this technology and\ndeploying it correctly.\n\n32\n00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,250\nFirst off, one thing we need to\nknow about the VCP is that there's\n\n33\n00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,590\nmore than one of them, all right?\n\n34\n00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,220\nIt used to be there was only a single VCP,\nthe VMware Certified Professional.\n\n35\n00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,610\nBut as the company grew and\n\n36\n00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,300\nthey added more products,\nthey started to branch it out.\n\n37\n00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,540\nSo when go to VMware's website, and you\ngo into their certification and training\n\n38\n00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,140\nsection, you'll find where the VCP is\nactually broken down into several chunks.\n\n39\n00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,520\nThere's the VCP Data Center\nVirtualization, or DCV.\n\n40\n00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,050\nThere's Cloud, End User Computing,\n\n41\n00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,150\nNetwork Virtualization, and\nCloud Application Platform.\n\n42\n00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,160\nThese are all different types of VCP,\nand you'll see them kind of\n\n43\n00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,390\nwritten over here where\nyou've got VCP5-DCV.\n\n44\n00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,490\nThat's the most common one right there.\n\n45\n00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,240\nThat's the VMware Certified Professional\nversion five,\n\n46\n00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,370\nDCV is Data Center Virtualization.\n\n47\n00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,160\nSo when most people say, yeah, I'm a VCP,\nthat's the one they're talking about.\n\n48\n00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,030\nBut you could also be VCP Cloud or\nNetwork Virtualization, or whatever.\n\n49\n00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,070\nYou could be one of these\nother certifications based on\n\n50\n00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,510\nwhat it is that you chose to do,\nwhat certification path you followed.\n\n51\n00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,553\nSo you can see VCP Cloud,\nhere's VCP5-DT, and login.\n\n52\n00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:12,988\nThese are all variations of that\nVMWare Certified Professional.\n\n53\n00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:17,346\nBut the most common one, that's\nthe one that we're gonna be recording\n\n54\n00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:22,286\nhere at ITProTV, and that's the VMware\nCertified Professional version five,\n\n55\n00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,480\nfor a data center virtualization.\n\n56\n00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,070\nNow with VCP version five, what VMware\ndid is they did something interesting,\n\n57\n00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,670\nand it makes this a little more\nchallenging than the other certifications.\n\n58\n00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,250\nMost of the time with ITProTV, you can\ncome here and you can watch our shows,\n\n59\n00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,940\nyou can learn everything that you need to\nknow, you can go and take the exam, and\n\n60\n00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,010\nyou can get certified, all right?\n\n61\n00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,230\nThis is going to be an exception.\n\n62\n00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,620\nWatching our show is not enough to be\nable to get the VCP certification.\n\n63\n00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,370\nWe're gonna cover all the topics,\nwe'll cover all the information and\n\n64\n00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,480\nhave you prepared to take that exam.\n\n65\n00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,600\nBut in order to take the exam,\n\n66\n00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,090\nVMware requires that you attend\ntheir official certification course.\n\n67\n00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,040\nSo the only people allowed to\ntake the exams are ones who\n\n68\n00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,560\nhave taken the course from VMware,\nfrom the actual company.\n\n69\n00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,940\nSo you might ask yourself,\nwhy are we even recording this at ITProTV?\n\n70\n00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,320\nAnd the reason is not everyone is\nlooking to get that certification.\n\n71\n00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,030\nMaybe you're looking to get\nthe requisite knowledge.\n\n72\n00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,920\nVMware is very common.\n\n73\n00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,090\nIt is very widely deployed\nout there in the real world.\n\n74\n00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,480\nSo maybe you wanna learn that.\n\n75\n00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,250\nBut the official VMware course,\nit costs over $4,000, it's a lot of money.\n\n76\n00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,880\nSo maybe you wanna get the knowledge\nwithout incurring that huge hit to your\n\n77\n00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,770\npocketbook, or\ngetting the certification isn't your goal.\n\n78\n00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,050\nOr maybe it is.\n\n79\n00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,150\nMaybe you already took the official VMware\ncourse, but it's been a little while since\n\n80\n00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,120\nyou took it and the information's getting\na little rusty, and you want a refresher.\n\n81\n00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,000\nWhatever your case is,\nthe ITProTV solution is a great one.\n\n82\n00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,950\nSo just bear in mind, if you want to get\nthe certification, if you want to go and\n\n83\n00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,930\nget those letters to put on your resume,\n\n84\n00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,170\nyou will have to take\nthe official course from VMware.\n\n85\n00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,890\nThere's no way around that,\nyou've got to do it.\n\n86\n00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,230\nOtherwise, our course, our VCP little\ntrack that we're gonna do here on ITProTV,\n\n87\n00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,930\nit covers all the same content.\n\n88\n00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,290\nWe cover every bit of it.\n\n89\n00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,550\nWe go through and we make sure\nthat you've got that knowledge.\n\n90\n00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,732\nIt's also a great supplement to\npeople who have taken the course.\n\n91\n00:05:26,732 --> 00:05:30,450\nAll right, so when you go on to\nthe certification site for VMware, and\n\n92\n00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,721\nyou go into that VCP5-DCV page,\nwhen you go into there,\n\n93\n00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:37,980\nit's gonna explain a few things to you.\n\n94\n00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,880\nFirst off,\nit's got the exam blueprint, and\n\n95\n00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,600\nthat's a great to thing to download\nbecause it's gonna tell you about\n\n96\n00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,190\nall the objectives that are on the exam,\nwhat the exam covers.\n\n97\n00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,900\nAnd it covers a lot of stuff.\n\n98\n00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,220\nBut before you even dive in there,\nyou have to make a choice.\n\n99\n00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,260\nThere's actually two exams,\nthey should both be here.\n\n100\n00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,140\nWell, they mention it here, but\n\n101\n00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,900\nthey don't actually mention it\nas far as the exam numbers.\n\n102\n00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,300\nBut there are two exams.\n\n103\n00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:09,810\nThere's the VCP550,\nis the official exam number, VCP550.\n\n104\n00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,910\nAnd another one that is the VCP510.\n\n105\n00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,210\nOne exam is for the older vSphere 5,\nand then the other exams is for\n\n106\n00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,445\nthe newer vSphere 5.5.\n\n107\n00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:24,752\nSo for the ITProTV show,\nwe're covering the vSphere 5.5.\n\n108\n00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:29,699\nThere's not a ton of difference between\nthe two, and there are some new features,\n\n109\n00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,910\nthings that were added in 5.5\nthat weren't there in 5.1.\n\n110\n00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,070\nBut as far as the base functionality,\nthey're very much the same,\n\n111\n00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,240\nvery similar products.\n\n112\n00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,350\nSo we're just gonna go with the newest,\n\n113\n00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,700\nbecause why cover the old\nstuff when new stuff is out?\n\n114\n00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,980\nSo we're gonna be doing vSphere 5.5.\n\n115\n00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,624\nSo when you sign up for the exam,\nif you've taken the official course,\n\n116\n00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:53,210\nyou know which one you need to do, whether\nit's VCP510 or VCP550, based on that.\n\n117\n00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,891\nBut you'll notice right here, even right\nhere on this page if we scroll down,\n\n118\n00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:03,711\nit's got what you need to do to\ntake the VCP510 or 550 exams,\n\n119\n00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:06,050\nand it lists it right here.\n\n120\n00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,910\nIf you are just starting with\nVMware Data Center Virtualization,\n\n121\n00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,950\ntraining courses required, all right?\n\n122\n00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,340\nYou are required to take the VMware\nvSphere Install, Configure, and\n\n123\n00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,960\nManage, or the Fast Track,\nor Optimize and Scale.\n\n124\n00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,045\nYou can take any one of these courses\nto qualify to take the actual exam.\n\n125\n00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,815\nBut if you haven't taken one of\nthese official courses from VMware,\n\n126\n00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:31,913\nyou're not allowed to register for\nthe exam.\n\n127\n00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:33,595\nI can't emphasize that enough,\n\n128\n00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:36,340\nI wanna make sure everybody's\nexpectations are set.\n\n129\n00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,910\nHowever, maybe you took the VMware\nvSphere Troubleshooting Workshop.\n\n130\n00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,170\nIf you did that one,\nyou can go and take the exam.\n\n131\n00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,000\nBut that means you didn't take Install,\nConfigure, and Manage, and\n\n132\n00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,312\nthat's what we're going to\nbe doing here in this show.\n\n133\n00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:52,990\nAnd so that's another place\nwhere ITProTV can come in.\n\n134\n00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,630\nWe can supplement that knowledge so\nyou don't have to go in and\n\n135\n00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,600\ntake multiple courses\nif you don't need to.\n\n136\n00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,530\nBut there is no way around that.\n\n137\n00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,560\nYou've got to do the training course.\n\n138\n00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,284\nNow there is one exception to that,\nI suppose,\n\n139\n00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,430\nI shouldn't say there's no way around it.\n\n140\n00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,130\nIf you already have your VCP\ncertification, when you get certified,\n\n141\n00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,000\nyou have to re-certify every two years.\n\n142\n00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,300\nSo once you've got the cert, you can't\njust kick back and rest on your laurels.\n\n143\n00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,880\nEvery two years you've got to re-certify,\n\n144\n00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,620\nand the way you re-certify\nis by taking the exam again.\n\n145\n00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,370\nNow you don't have to\ntake the course again,\n\n146\n00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,490\nyou just have to take the exam again.\n\n147\n00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,920\nAnd so if you're re-certifying under 5.5,\nwell, our show will work great for you.\n\n148\n00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,280\nYou don't have to take the course again.\n\n149\n00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,370\nYou can watch our show,\ngo and take that exam.\n\n150\n00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,700\nWell, let's talk a little\nbit about the exam itself.\n\n151\n00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,050\nOn the exam certification page, you'll see\nwhere you can download the blueprint, and\n\n152\n00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,790\nthe blueprint,\n\n153\n00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,610\nit actually has a full exam guide that\ntells you all about the examination.\n\n154\n00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,600\nI've got it pulled up here.\n\n155\n00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,860\nAnd it starts off by giving you some\nbasic general information about the exam,\n\n156\n00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,702\nand then it jumps right\ninto the exam objectives.\n\n157\n00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,640\nWhat's gonna be covered on the exam,\n\n158\n00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,770\nwhat you can expect that test\nquestion to be made up from.\n\n159\n00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,735\nBut the exam itself is really\npretty straightforward.\n\n160\n00:09:10,735 --> 00:09:13,210\nIt's a predominantly multiple choice exam.\n\n161\n00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,760\nThere are some pictorial and\n\n162\n00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,590\nsimulation questions, but for\nthe most part it's multiple choice.\n\n163\n00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,560\nAnd it's made up of 135 questions.\n\n164\n00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,190\nIt's 135 questions, and\nyou get two hours, 120 minutes.\n\n165\n00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,350\nSo you need to be answering questions\nquickly, less than a minute per question.\n\n166\n00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,360\nSo it's not an exam you want to\ndally on if you can avoid it.\n\n167\n00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,680\nYou wanna answer those questions and\nmove forward, all right.\n\n168\n00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,410\nIt's graded on a scale from 100 to 500.\n\n169\n00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,198\nThe lowest score you can get is a 100.\n\n170\n00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:42,803\nThe highest score you can get is a 500.\n\n171\n00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:45,221\nA 300 is passing.\n\n172\n00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:49,170\nSo you need to score at least\na 300 to get the certification.\n\n173\n00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,320\nNow when you're in there taking that exam,\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n174\n00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,866\nThere is a short little survey at\nthe beginning, I think it's seven or\n\n175\n00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:57,958\neight questions you answer.\n\n176\n00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,433\nAnd then it goes right into it,\nand you answer your 135 questions.\n\n177\n00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,913\nIt's computer-scored,\n\n178\n00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:07,530\nso you'll know right at the end of\nexam whether you've passed or failed.\n\n179\n00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,310\nThe exam's administered by Pearson VUE,\nso if you wanna take the exam,\n\n180\n00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,550\nyou actually go to Pearson VUE's\nwebsite to register for it.\n\n181\n00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,230\nBut before you can even register, if I go\nback here, this is the VMware page again.\n\n182\n00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,710\nAnd so I'm looking at\nthe certification benefits and\n\n183\n00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,100\nother information here,\nwhat you need to do to get certified.\n\n184\n00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,470\nAnd then you've got down\nhere under Prepare for Exam,\n\n185\n00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,080\nyou've got the exam blueprint,\nstudy guide, and practice.\n\n186\n00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,620\nSo, you've got various things.\n\n187\n00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,830\nWhen you get down here to exam\nregistration though, if we go to register,\n\n188\n00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,570\nyou'll see it'll tell you about\nthe two exams, VCP550 and VCP510,\n\n189\n00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,590\nand you've got Download\nthe Exam Blueprint,\n\n190\n00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,910\nthat's what I was looking at a moment ago,\nand request authorization.\n\n191\n00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,210\nThat's that key piece.\n\n192\n00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,670\nYou can't just go to Pearson VUE and\ntake the exam.\n\n193\n00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,590\nYou've got to, oh, I'm not logged in.\n\n194\n00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,510\nYou've got to request authorization first.\n\n195\n00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,420\nAnd basically what you're doing is you're\nsaying hey, I took the official course,\n\n196\n00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,560\nhere's my registration information,\ncan I please sign up with Pearson?\n\n197\n00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,040\nAnd they'll give you a code, and you call\nup Pearson or you go to their website,\n\n198\n00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,360\nand you'll present that code to\nbe able to register for the exam.\n\n199\n00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,190\nExam.\nAll right, so\n\n200\n00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,380\nthat's a key,\nimportant part of the process there.\n\n201\n00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,530\nAnd don't think poorly of VMware\nbecause they have this restriction.\n\n202\n00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,710\nThey do it for a reason.\n\n203\n00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,380\nThey want to ensure that everyone who\ntakes that exam has the same experience,\n\n204\n00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,210\nthe same training before they go in.\n\n205\n00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,070\nAnd they wanna be very tightly\ncontrolled in that training.\n\n206\n00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,620\nAll of companies aren't like that.\n\n207\n00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,860\nMicrosoft, Cisco, CompTIA.\n\n208\n00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,880\nThey don't care who you take the course\nfrom or what course you use, or\n\n209\n00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,420\nwhether you studied from a book, whether\nyou have hands on, they don't care.\n\n210\n00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,920\nJust as long as you go in and\npass that exam, right.\n\n211\n00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,863\nBut VMware wants to ensure that everyone\ngets the same level of training and\n\n212\n00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:46,430\nexcellence.\n\n213\n00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,868\nAnd they do that by very,\nvery tightly controlling it.\n\n214\n00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,940\nSo that's why they do it.\n\n215\n00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,280\nAll right, but\nif you've taken any of those courses,\n\n216\n00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,580\nthen you can request authorization,\nyou'll get it.\n\n217\n00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,840\nYou go and take the exam, you pass it, and\n\n218\n00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,319\nyou're now a VMware Certified Professional\nfor Data Center Virtualization.\n\n219\n00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:04,560\nAll right, so for\n\n220\n00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,780\nour show, we're gonna be running through\nall the content that's on the exam.\n\n221\n00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,507\nAnd if we take a look\nat that exam blueprint,\n\n222\n00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:12,605\nit runs through some of the major areas\nthat a lot of us are gonna have to tackle.\n\n223\n00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:16,987\nBasically, we start out with simple things\nlike just getting the thing installed,\n\n224\n00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,477\nthat's kind of important.\n\n225\n00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:23,706\nSo we're gonna see getting the V Center\ninstalled, and getting VMware,\n\n226\n00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:29,880\nvSphere, the Hypervisor ESX, getting it\ninstalled, and our basic configuration.\n\n227\n00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,000\nThat's really what\nobjective one is all about.\n\n228\n00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,360\nFrom there it moves into Objective two,\nwhich is the networking side.\n\n229\n00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,260\nIt used to be that virtualization\nnetworking was a really simple thing, but\n\n230\n00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,440\nVMware has released some really,\nreally cool stuff,\n\n231\n00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,620\nlike distributed virtual switches, which\nare awesome, which makes them complex.\n\n232\n00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,440\nAnd so in Objective two,\nwe take a look at how we plan and\n\n233\n00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,229\nconfigure the networking\npiece inside of vSphere.\n\n234\n00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,080\nThen in section three,\nwe start to take a look at storage.\n\n235\n00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,990\nVMware supports a lot of different\ntypes of storages, local storage,\n\n236\n00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,360\ndirect attached storage.\n\n237\n00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,980\nThere's fiber channel SANs,\nthere's iSCSI storage,\n\n238\n00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,410\nthere's remote fiber channel SANs,\nall sorts of different things.\n\n239\n00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,670\nAnd so we'll take a look at what's\ninvolved, and getting those set up,\n\n240\n00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,219\nand how they work, and how we can use\nthem to store our virtual machines.\n\n241\n00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,240\nThen we get into section four.\n\n242\n00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,990\nIt's how we deal with\nthe virtual machines themselves.\n\n243\n00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,600\nThe first three sections are really just\nabout setting up your infrastructure.\n\n244\n00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,640\nWe haven't even created\na virtual machine yet.\n\n245\n00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,500\nSo in section four,\nwe take a look at those VMs.\n\n246\n00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,080\nWhen we create virtual machines,\n\n247\n00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,120\nthe guest operating systems that are\nrunning on our virtualization platform.\n\n248\n00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,100\nAnd we also talked a little bit\nabout V apps, virtual apps, and\n\n249\n00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,370\nthis is where the applications\nthemselves can be tracked, managed,\n\n250\n00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,340\nand failed over inside of VMware.\n\n251\n00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,660\nSo we get a chance to see a lot of that.\n\n252\n00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,400\nAll right, once we get past that,\nyou've got section five,\n\n253\n00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,980\nwhich is Establishing and\nMaintaining Service Levels.\n\n254\n00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,820\nWhen you've got everything set up,\nhow do you keep it up and running?\n\n255\n00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,670\nWe need to keep it running healthy, and we\nneed to spot problems before they occur,\n\n256\n00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,920\nand that's what this section is about.\n\n257\n00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,050\nWe take a look at VMware clusters for\ndoing failover and high availability, and\n\n258\n00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,580\na few other neat little tools that we have\ninside of VMware to provide that reliable\n\n259\n00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,900\ninfrastructure that we need, because\nwe depend on these platforms more and\n\n260\n00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,920\nmore as time goes on.\n\n261\n00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,570\nAnd then is section six,\nwe've got our troubleshooting.\n\n262\n00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,360\nSometimes things don't work the way\nthat we expect them to, and so\n\n263\n00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,070\nwe've gotta go and find out why.\n\n264\n00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,170\nSection six tackles that.\n\n265\n00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,420\nWe just go and look for the issues, run a\nstandardized troubleshooting methodology,\n\n266\n00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,880\nfind the problem, fix it, and\nget ourselves back and running.\n\n267\n00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,780\nYou know, step one is just to get\nyour services back to operational.\n\n268\n00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,510\nStep two is to fix the problem and\nget your system back to 100%.\n\n269\n00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,440\nSo we run through that process and\nget a chance to see it.\n\n270\n00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:51,080\nAll right, section seven is just\nmonitoring the implementation.\n\n271\n00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,450\nSo once it's up and running,\nhow do we keep an eye on performance and\n\n272\n00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,030\nother things?\n\n273\n00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,020\nSo that's what we talk about here,\nmonitoring the big four, disk,\n\n274\n00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,800\nmemory, network, and CPU,\nmonitoring that utilization, and\n\n275\n00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,420\nmaking sure that our hardware\nis not being over subscribed.\n\n276\n00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,650\nWe don't wanna overtax our hardware,\nit'll result in poor performance.\n\n277\n00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,810\nSo those are the main\nobjectives right there, and\n\n278\n00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,130\nthen after you've learned all that\ninformation you're ready to go and\n\n279\n00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,022\ntake that VCP5 exam,\nthe VCP550 is what we're gonna cover.\n\n280\n00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:24,990\nAll right, let's see,\nwhat else do I have to mention here?\n\n281\n00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,040\nI mentioned the re-cert,\nwhich is important.\n\n282\n00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,160\nEvery two years you've\ngot to repeat the exam.\n\n283\n00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,840\nIf you attempt the exam and you do not\npass, there is a seven day waiting period.\n\n284\n00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,680\nYou have to wait a week before\nyou can take the exam again.\n\n285\n00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,340\nNot too bad, but they do make you pause,\nnot just jump right back in.\n\n286\n00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,820\nAnd the reason they do that is not\nto be annoying, but because you can,\n\n287\n00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,230\neven unintentionally,\nyou can memorize questions on the exam.\n\n288\n00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,325\nSo if you go right back in and take it\nthe next day, a lot of those questions\n\n289\n00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:56,865\nare fresh in your mind and\nyou can move a lot faster because of it.\n\n290\n00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:58,545\nSo they make you wait a week,\n\n291\n00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:02,889\njust to ensure that short-term\nmemory isn't kicking in there, and\n\n292\n00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:05,355\nit kinda takes that advantage away\nthat you might get from that.\n\n293\n00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,150\nBut that's basically it.\n\n294\n00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,769\nThe VCP, the VMware Certified\nProfessional, especially the VCP5-DCV,\n\n295\n00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,410\nvery good certification.\n\n296\n00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,340\nIt all looks great on your resume.\n\n297\n00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,650\nDoes show that you really know VMware.\n\n298\n00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,330\nHow it works and how to support\nit in an enterprise environment.\n\n299\n00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,940\nAnd it's a very good skill to have.\n\n300\n00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,430\nSo,
