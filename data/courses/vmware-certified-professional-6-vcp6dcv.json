          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.900\n[SOUND]\n\n2\n00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.927\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:13.820\nIn this video we're going to take a look\nat the PCP6-DCV show on ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.900\nNow, in addition to having one of\nthe longest acronym names available,\n\n5\n00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.350\nit's also one of the most popular ones.\n\n6\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.370\nIt's from VM ware and\n\n7\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.750\nit focuses on Virtualization technologies\nusing the vSphere version six suite.\n\n8\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.285\nSo, let's take a look\nat what this exam is.\n\n9\n00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:32.330\nWho's going to work towards this and\nthe certification and\n\n10\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.230\nthe other things that\nare involved with this series.\n\n11\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.190\nNow it is a lot of fun and I really want\nto stress a couple of things first off.\n\n12\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.900\nThis is designed to be the starting\npoint for getting certified with VMware.\n\n13\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.300\nThey have a VCA which is kind of\nan introduction to VMware and vSphere.\n\n14\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.270\nAnd then there's the VCP which\nis what this show is based on.\n\n15\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.760\nAnd this is for people who are going\nto be implementing and deploying,\n\n16\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.600\nmaintaining VMware vSphere\nout there in the real world.\n\n17\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.390\nNow the products have\na number of different names.\n\n18\n00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.940\nAnd so when I say vSphere that\nmight not mean anything to you.\n\n19\n00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.720\nYou might know it better\nas VMware's ESX or\n\n20\n00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.960\nESXi, vCenter,\nvSphere Suite itself, vCenter.\n\n21\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.880\nLet's see, what else do we have?\n\n22\n00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.920\nHorizon View, vRealize.\n\n23\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.450\nAll these different products from\nVMware are a part of the vSphere Suite.\n\n24\n00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.360\nAnd the VCP6-DCV It actually covers\na lot of those different technologies\n\n25\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.480\nfrom a real world application standpoint.\n\n26\n00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.290\nThese are the things you're\ngoing to be using out there.\n\n27\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.470\nAll right so\nlet's take a look at the certification.\n\n28\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.640\nI've got the Mware's webpage pull up here.\n\n29\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.450\nAnd they're basically detailing\ninformation about the certification.\n\n30\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.100\nAnd the full name is\nthe VMware Certified Professional 6-\n\n31\n00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100\nData Center Virtualization.\n\n32\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.380\nPreviously we had version five,\nV sphere suite five and 5.5.\n\n33\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.220\nAnd now we're up to version 6.\n\n34\n00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.060\nBut not much has changed as far\nas the certification itself.\n\n35\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.575\nThey do have that VCA.\n\n36\n00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:54.300\nVCA6-DCV, it's kind of\nan introductory certification.\n\n37\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.820\nWe had that content on IT ProTV also.\n\n38\n00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.340\nBut a lot of people chose to skip\nover that because it is very basic,\n\n39\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.200\nvery introductory.\n\n40\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.039\nJust kind of helping you recognize\nthe products, not actually do anything.\n\n41\n00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.737\n[LAUGH].\n\n42\n00:02:06.737 --> 00:02:11.340\nSo, once you get to the VCP6, that's where\nyou're actually learning how to do stuff.\n\n43\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.920\nHow to implement Vsphere\nin your environment and\n\n44\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.810\nbe able to maintain and support it.\n\n45\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.200\nNow some of you may move on to some\nof the more advanced certifications.\n\n46\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.420\nLike the VCAP and the VCIX,\nthose are more advanced.\n\n47\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.130\nBut we're limiting ourselves right\nhere to this professional level, and\n\n48\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.040\nthere's a main reason for that.\n\n49\n00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.550\nOne of the big reasons is that a lot of\npeople watch our shows because they want\n\n50\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.260\nto get certified.\n\n51\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.890\nUnfortunately, VMware\nhas a very strict rule.\n\n52\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.490\nIf you want to take the exam, you have to\ntake an authorized course from VMware.\n\n53\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.460\nAnd I can't stress this enough,\nthe ITProTV course is a great course.\n\n54\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.440\nWe cover everything that's on the exam.\n\n55\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.930\nBut it is not an authorized\ncourse from VMware.\n\n56\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.880\nWhat that means is that if you watch\nour show from start to finish, and\n\n57\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.520\nyou learn everything and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n58\n00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.760\nYou're still not qualified\nto take the exam.\n\n59\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.220\nAnd you can see that right up here\nin the new candidate requirements.\n\n60\n00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.350\nIf you come down here, and you say I'm\nnew to VMware data center virtualization,\n\n61\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.460\nthey'll tell you the steps.\n\n62\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.990\nRight.\n\n63\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.070\nFirst off, they want you to work\nwith vSphere for at least 6 months.\n\n64\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.240\nHave a little exposure to it.\n\n65\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.040\nDon't just come in with no knowledge.\n\n66\n00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.440\nThen, attend one of\nthe required training courses.\n\n67\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.650\nYou've got to attend their\nauthorized training course.\n\n68\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.830\nAnd at the end of the course,\n\n69\n00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.040\nthey'll give you a voucher\nthat'll let you take the exam.\n\n70\n00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.580\nWe can't give you the voucher,\nbecause it's not an authorized course.\n\n71\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.759\nSo if you're just looking\nto learn about VMware,\n\n72\n00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.180\ndeploy it in your environment,\nour show is great.\n\n73\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.830\nIf you've already taken\nan authorized course, and\n\n74\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.680\nyou're looking to reaffirm that knowledge.\n\n75\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.030\nAnd get ready for the exam,\nagain, our course is great.\n\n76\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.600\nBut if you're just starting out.\n\n77\n00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.490\nAnd you're dead set on getting that exam,\n\n78\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.490\nthen the ITProTV show might\nnot be the right one for you.\n\n79\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.660\nDefinitely keep that in mind\nwhen you go to look at this.\n\n80\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.450\nAfter that, though,\nyou can complete the foundations exam or\n\n81\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.380\nyou can skip over it and\ngo right to the VCP6-DCV exam.\n\n82\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.450\nTake it, pass it and\nget your VCP certification.\n\n83\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.230\nNow the exam itself,\nlet me show you the details on it.\n\n84\n00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.080\nIt's 100 minutes, so it's little more than\nan hour and a half and it's 85 questions.\n\n85\n00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.850\nThe majority of the questions are multiple\nchoice, so it's not too challenging.\n\n86\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.040\nYou do have a couple of drag and drop, and\na couple of simulation type of questions.\n\n87\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.800\nBut most of it's multiple choice.\n\n88\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.600\nAnd you churn through, it's not terribly\nexpensive compared to some vendors.\n\n89\n00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.000\nIn each country,\nit's priced a little different.\n\n90\n00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.490\nHere in the US, it's $225.\n\n91\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.390\nAnd you can jump in and take that exam,\npass it, and get certified.\n\n92\n00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.300\nNow, you do need to renew it every\ncouple of years to stay up to date.\n\n93\n00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.190\nBut new versions of vSphere come out,\nand that's what a lot of people will do.\n\n94\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.380\nIs just take the newer versions, and\nthat renews you and keeps you current.\n\n95\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.810\nNow, the exam, itself,\ncovers a range of topics.\n\n96\n00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.740\nAnd this is what we based our show on.\n\n97\n00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.520\nWhen you watch the ITProTV show for\nVCP6-DCV,\n\n98\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.700\nwe run through each of these areas.\n\n99\n00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.290\nNow, we have rearranged\nthe topics a little bit.\n\n100\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.400\nSee, for example, how it starts right off\nwith administering vSphere 6 security.\n\n101\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.190\nWell we didn't do that.\n\n102\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.960\nWe started with getting\nthe vSphere Suite installed.\n\n103\n00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.650\nIt's kind of important to get\nthe installed before you can secure it.\n\n104\n00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.685\nSo, we arranged ours to be in\na little bit more logical order.\n\n105\n00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:04.920\nBut we do cover every single one of\nthe objectives that are listed here\n\n106\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.860\non the screen.\n\n107\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.960\nWe cover securing vSphere.\n\n108\n00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.780\nAnd that's the vCenter Server as well\nas the ESXi virtualization host,\n\n109\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.470\nwe cover securing all of that.\n\n110\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.440\nWe cover networking and\nstorage configuration.\n\n111\n00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.190\nThat's part of your infrastructure and\nthat's got to be done right.\n\n112\n00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.360\nOtherwise you're going to\nhave poor performance.\n\n113\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.125\nWe talk about doing deployments and\nupgrades.\n\n114\n00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:26.725\nYou might have an existing 5 or\n5.5 environment.\n\n115\n00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:29.515\nWe cover how to upgrade that to 6 and\nget that in place.\n\n116\n00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:32.005\nWe're talking about administering and\nmanaging our resources.\n\n117\n00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:35.367\nThis is kind of like the monitoring and\nmaintaining of vSphere.\n\n118\n00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:37.807\nWe need to keep track of all of\nour hardware and software, and\n\n119\n00:05:37.807 --> 00:05:40.417\nmake sure that it's\nperforming at its peak.\n\n120\n00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:42.677\nWe talk about backing up and\nrecovering the deployment,\n\n121\n00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:45.042\nall the different pieces\nthat go into our solution.\n\n122\n00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:46.927\nBecause there's a lot of\ndifferent components.\n\n123\n00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:48.837\nAnd we need to make sure that\nwe know how to back that up.\n\n124\n00:05:48.837 --> 00:05:50.697\nAnd to restore it in the event\nthat we have a failure.\n\n125\n00:05:51.807 --> 00:05:53.277\nWe cover troubleshooting tools.\n\n126\n00:05:53.277 --> 00:05:56.507\nThere's a ton of different tools and\ntechniques available for finding and\n\n127\n00:05:56.507 --> 00:05:58.570\nfixing problems inside of vSphere.\n\n128\n00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.870\nSo we run through a lot of those.\n\n129\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.810\nSome are obvious.\n\n130\n00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.872\nOnes that you see in the GUI, others\nare a lot more cryptic and command liney.\n\n131\n00:06:04.872 --> 00:06:08.020\nKind of buried behind the scenes but\nare incredibly useful for\n\n132\n00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.040\nwhen you're having problems.\n\n133\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.370\nWe also talk about\nconsolidating your data center.\n\n134\n00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.330\nSo what I'm really talking about here is\nconverting physical machines into virtual\n\n135\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.870\nmachines.\n\n136\n00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.370\nSo we kind of run through that process\nof using the The VMware converter\n\n137\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.920\nto convert our physical machines.\n\n138\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.590\nOr even to convert virtual\nmachines in other platforms,\n\n139\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.806\nmaybe of Hyper-V or XenServer.\n\n140\n00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:30.070\nAnd you want to bring those\nvirtual machines into a ESX so\n\n141\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.880\nwe cover how to do that.\n\n142\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.000\nWe talk about availability solutions\nlike clustering inside of vSphere.\n\n143\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.180\nAs well as replication.\n\n144\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.580\nAnd a few other techniques that we can\nuse to make sure that even if our entire\n\n145\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.710\nbuilding fails.\n\n146\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.180\nThat our virtual machines are still up and\nrunning somewhere else.\n\n147\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.550\nAnd then lastly, we talk about managing\nthe virtual machines themselves.\n\n148\n00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.630\nWhen you start speeding up VMs.\n\n149\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.060\nThere's a lot of performance concerns in\nother areas that we need to be aware of\n\n150\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.200\nto make sure that our virtual\nmachines perform as well\n\n151\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.680\nAs their physical counterparts.\n\n152\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.430\nSince that's the whole\nadvantage of virtualization.\n\n153\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.390\nIs that we can get the same level of\nperformance from non dedicated hardware.\n\n154\n00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.060\nAnd that frees us up for redundancy and\n\n155\n00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.300\nperformance improvements that you\ndefinitely want to take advantage of.\n\n156\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.980\nSo those are all the things that\nwe're going to be tackling as we\n\n157\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.040\nrun through V M ware through\nthe VCP6-DCV certification.\n\n158\n00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.640\nWe cover it all, it's a good time.\n\n159\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.040\nIf you're starting out with\nabsolutely no exposure,\n\n160\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.460\nthen I do recommend you\ncatch our VCA show.\n\n161\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.330\nIt's in the courseware library\nright beside the VCP show.\n\n162\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.780\nYou can watch the VCA and\nit's very high level.\n\n163\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.250\nAnd it just introduces you to\nall the different products.\n\n164\n00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.840\nBecause when you deploy these fier,\n\n165\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.100\nI mean there's a good ten different\nproducts in there that all work together.\n\n166\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.350\nAnd it gets really confusing.\n\n167\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.870\nSo the VCA can shed\na lot of light on that.\n\n168\n00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.680\nBut when you're ready to actually\nlearn how to implement and\n\n169\n00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.498\nuse the technologies, VCP,\nthat's the place you want to be.\n\n170\n00:07:47.498 --> 00:07:50.540\nYou're going to go right in there and\nstart deploying the technologies getting\n\n171\n00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.240\nand put in place and\nactually seeing it operating.\n\n172\n00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.150\nAnd you'll see there's\na lot of power to this.\n\n173\n00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.170\nIt's something everybody's using\nout there in the enterprise and\n\n174\n00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.310\nbusiness environments.\n\n175\n00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.107\nSo definitely something that\nyou want to take advantage of.\n\n176\n00:08:04.107 --> 00:08:04.945\nWell, if that sounds exciting to you,\nthen you are in the right place.\n\n177\n00:08:04.945 --> 00:08:10.565\nStay tuned because we've got\nepisodes of VCP6-DCV coming up next.\n\n178\n00:08:10.565 --> 00:08:19.999\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
