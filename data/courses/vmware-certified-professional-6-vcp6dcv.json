They continue show some additional troubleshooting tools found in vSphere.  Don emphasizes the importance of log files in troubleshooting and shows were to get to them.  They also take some time to show monitoring tools in vSphere that give more help to a troubleshooter for the performance issues.  Since vSphere is normally implemented in high availability and using Distributed Resource Services to help maintain the uptime and performance, Don also shows how to use and see the tools for both.  Lastly, they mention the enterprise product, vRealize that brings all these tools together as a centralized utility and tool to manage and troubleshoot a vSphere environment.",
