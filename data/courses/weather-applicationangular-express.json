Express will be used to proxy the request from the front end to the DarkSky API that is being consumed as a measure of hiding the credentials that are necessary for making the request. Moreover, Angular will interact with the proxy in order to obtain the information needed to render the application. If you want to see how this application comes together, then join us!",
